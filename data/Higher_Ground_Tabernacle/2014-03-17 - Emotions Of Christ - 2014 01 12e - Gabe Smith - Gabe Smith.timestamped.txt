[0:00] amen praise the
[0:01] Lord
[0:04] amen yeah again we're happy to be here
[0:09] this
[0:10] evening happy to be a
[0:13] Christian amen and uh I uh appreciate
[0:19] the Lord yes appreciate being here with
[0:22] you I really uh counted a privilege
[0:25] hallu amen and uh I uh I had to say uh
[0:31] uh I I love your
[0:35] pastor
[0:37] amen amen that ain't that's not lip
[0:39] service I mean I he he may never have me
[0:42] back but I still love him just the same
[0:45] ain't saying there pulling on a on on a
[0:47] pull pit I just you know sometimes you
[0:49] meet people and you just just something
[0:51] about them you know you meet many people
[0:53] in life and then there's certain people
[0:55] that kind of pop out a little bit more
[0:57] than others you know amen so uh
[1:01] appreciate brother Brooks and sister
[1:03] Ruby and the fellowship and
[1:05] hospitality and uh I uh I trust this
[1:08] evening something's going to be said to
[1:10] be a blessing to you as uh as I said
[1:14] that this morning we're going to look at
[1:17] something uh a little bit different and
[1:20] my my uh my goal this evening uh is to
[1:25] is to uh display God in flesh for
[1:31] you uh uh and you know we we think of
[1:35] Jesus and we think of God and we many
[1:37] times we put him way up
[1:39] yonder right so so uh so
[1:44] unattainable that that he that that you
[1:47] know even though we know it was God made
[1:49] flesh but sometimes we lose the we
[1:51] realize what that really means that God
[1:54] did come in flesh amen and so God felt
[1:58] everything that you felt
[2:00] yes sir amen he went through all that
[2:02] you went through and just just so you
[2:06] know what I did is is I I I studied I'd
[2:11] say off and on for about a year it was a
[2:13] private study of mine um I I I come
[2:17] across something where uh Jesus was
[2:20] expressing an emotion in the word of
[2:22] this is how he was feeling and and it
[2:25] struck me and so what I started doing it
[2:27] started compiling through the Gospels
[2:30] every time that uh Jesus spoke of
[2:33] emotion or something how he was feeling
[2:36] whether it was anger or crying or you
[2:39] know whatever it may be uh and I
[2:41] compiled it and uh just as a personal
[2:44] study but as I looked at it it it grown
[2:46] and it just turned into a message
[2:48] because uh I I I honestly believe not
[2:52] because I studied it but I really wish I
[2:55] could give every believer in the world
[2:58] this file
[3:00] because it's one thing to read it
[3:03] periodically and see Jesus but to gather
[3:06] them all together and collect them and
[3:09] then you read it at one time it'll give
[3:12] you a whole another aspect of Our Lord
[3:15] when he walked on Earth amen because you
[3:18] know uh and it'll be surprising to you
[3:21] but we'll just we'll we'll we'll we'll
[3:23] try to get into the word of the Lord
[3:24] right now uh first I'd like to
[3:27] read uh
[3:30] Mark chapter
[3:32] 3 and verse
[3:35] 5 the Bible says and when he looked
[3:39] round about on them with
[3:44] anger being
[3:47] grieved for the hardness of their hearts
[3:51] he saith unto the man stretch forth
[3:54] thine hand and he stretched it out and
[3:57] his hand was restored whole as the other
[4:01] and then Luke
[4:03] 10:21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in
[4:07] spirit and said I thank thee oh Father
[4:10] Heaven of Earth of Lord of Heaven and
[4:13] Earth that thou H has hid these things
[4:15] from the wise and prudent and H has
[4:17] revealed them unto babes even so father
[4:20] for so it seemed good in thy sight and
[4:23] then I'd like to read a quote uh brother
[4:27] Bram says this in uh 58 eight he says we
[4:31] find that our Lord never did anything
[4:35] just at
[4:36] random every move he made was ordained
[4:40] of the father we just go at random but
[4:44] he said I always do those things which
[4:47] pleases the father so every move that he
[4:52] had made had a meaning amen and it was
[4:57] to please God oh I would say here would
[5:00] it not be wonderful if we could have
[5:03] that have a have a testimony like that
[5:06] that we always do that which pleases
[5:10] God Amen and I like to speak to you this
[5:14] evening by the help of the Lord on
[5:17] emotions of Christ emotions of Christ
[5:21] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[5:24] prayer precious Lord we do love you God
[5:27] this evening and we just want to Bow
[5:28] before you and welcome you Lord to this
[5:31] portion of the service and just pray God
[5:33] that your will would come to pass Lord
[5:35] we yield to you pray that you'd have
[5:37] your perfect way Lord uh pray God that
[5:41] you'd bind my mouth if I'd say something
[5:43] contrary to your spirit and word and
[5:45] we'll be careful to give you praise we
[5:47] ask these things to be so in the name
[5:49] that's above every name our Lord and
[5:51] Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you
[5:54] you can be seated if you like and um you
[5:58] know you know I what really got me
[6:00] thinking about this and and looking at
[6:02] it is uh you know I'm an emotional
[6:08] person I just am and uh um you know I
[6:13] think many times we try to control our
[6:17] emotions that right and uh I believe
[6:21] Christ is our
[6:24] example and and so uh you know emotion
[6:28] is a very power F thing and it's and and
[6:31] so I believe that uh and and remember I
[6:35] I did the best that I could and comb the
[6:37] gospel as thorough as I could to make
[6:39] sure I wasn't I didn't leave anything
[6:41] out uh you may find a scripture or
[6:44] something where I I missed but I tried
[6:46] to be as thorough as possible and so uh
[6:49] and once I compiled this it was so
[6:52] striking to me that uh that it it it it
[6:56] said what it said you know and and and
[6:59] and so it's kind of uh and I think it's
[7:02] important that if if God put him saying
[7:05] an emotion that he's feeling it's for a
[7:08] purpose right it's not done just at
[7:10] random and and and so there's a meaning
[7:13] behind it and so in God I believe he's
[7:16] he's trying to express when I was in
[7:19] flesh this is how I was feeling right
[7:22] and and so you know emotion is is a very
[7:25] as much as we try to uh contain our
[7:28] emotions emotion uh plays a very
[7:31] important part of our lives uh you know
[7:34] it's not just we've all heard it said
[7:36] it's not just what we say but it's how
[7:39] we say it is that right uh we can we can
[7:44] as as we see that uh very little when we
[7:46] are speaking and and talking to one
[7:49] another very little of it is based upon
[7:52] what you say but there's a uh a great
[7:56] portion of your tone of voice and and
[7:59] the the way your body language is is
[8:02] that right uh it's just a small
[8:04] percentage as you see there as science
[8:06] uh is saying just 7% of your word uh 38%
[8:11] of your voice tones and 55% of your uh
[8:14] physiology and if I could give you an
[8:17] example uh to make it real to you I
[8:20] could I could I could look at uh um uh
[8:24] brother Brooks and I could say brother
[8:26] Brooks now be careful you might get hurt
[8:31] right but I could look at brother John
[8:34] and say
[8:36] careful my get
[8:41] hurt now I said the exact same
[8:45] thing I said I said brother Brooke now
[8:48] be careful and see look at was be
[8:51] careful
[8:53] but see and so so emotion is is is a is
[8:58] a uh
[8:59] uh a very important part and so when
[9:02] when God is expressing this he's trying
[9:05] to uh and I believe he's trying to
[9:07] comfort Us in this in this thing because
[9:09] you know brother brandom tells us this
[9:11] that uh uh it's been one of the most
[9:13] amazing things that I've noticed along
[9:15] the lines of my Ministry of our Lord
[9:17] Jesus is the peculiarity people and the
[9:21] study of human life is one of the one of
[9:23] the greatest things that a person can
[9:27] study to watch nature of people and and
[9:32] and I I'll be honest with you uh you
[9:34] know it wasn't so much the seals and the
[9:36] Thunders that caught me uh in in one
[9:38] sense I hope you understand but but but
[9:41] what what and I love don't get me wrong
[9:43] I love the Deep things of God and I love
[9:45] the opening of the word but but but what
[9:47] I love about the message is it helped me
[9:50] understand me and why I am the way that
[9:53] I
[9:54] am and and why I tick the way that I
[9:57] tick amen you there's so many facets of
[10:00] this message it is deep Doctrine and it
[10:02] is the opening of the word but it's also
[10:05] brother brandham gives us insight to to
[10:07] the the the way a human is and the way a
[10:10] human thinks and acts and responds and
[10:13] and all the different aspects of life I
[10:15] believe any question we have in this
[10:17] journey it's going to be found in the
[10:18] message of the hour of the word of God
[10:20] believe that with all of my heart and
[10:22] brother BR says in the different parts
[10:24] of of the nation the worlds where you go
[10:27] you'll notice that there's a different
[10:29] there's a different attitude that people
[10:30] takes towards Christ towards his service
[10:33] and towards his servants towards worship
[10:35] and one of the things has been that one
[10:37] type of meeting will just be wonderful
[10:39] in one part of the country where it
[10:41] won't work in the other part of the
[10:43] country am and uh I I hope this message
[10:46] Works in this part of the
[10:49] country if I missed it forgive me uh but
[10:53] but you know you know the Bible does
[10:54] tell us that uh to everything there is a
[10:58] season it's a time uh to every purpose
[11:01] under Heaven there's times to weep and
[11:03] there's times to laugh times to mourn
[11:05] and times to dance is that right times
[11:08] to Cast Away stones and times to gather
[11:11] Stones there's there's times to to Rend
[11:13] and times to sew a time to keep silent
[11:16] and a time to speak a time to love and a
[11:19] time to hate a time of war and a time of
[11:21] peace and so as we go through this
[11:23] saying of life it it it there there's so
[11:26] many facets to it is that right and and
[11:30] before I I I you know we think of the
[11:32] Lord Jesus as though he he was God
[11:35] manifested in flesh but we also know
[11:38] this that he was very human because he
[11:41] was
[11:42] hungry that right the Bible tells us
[11:45] that there was a time and he he was
[11:48] thirsty and there was a time you know
[11:51] where the Bible says that he was wearied
[11:53] from his journey that means he was
[11:55] exhausted with toil of burdens or grief
[11:59] and so he was all human although though
[12:01] he was God tabernacled in flesh but he
[12:04] suffered all those things and so as we
[12:06] look at his emotions this evening I
[12:09] would like to ask you a question uh
[12:12] before we get started and and just think
[12:15] it in your heart out of all the human
[12:18] emotions what do you think was the
[12:20] greatest that he expressed when he was
[12:22] on
[12:24] Earth and and and I'm sure uh there's
[12:27] probably a great portion of you that was
[12:30] uh just like myself and before I studied
[12:33] this that we would probably
[12:35] automatically top at the list would
[12:37] think
[12:39] love uh but according to the prophet
[12:42] you're
[12:42] wrong and me too because brother bham
[12:46] tells us this his eyes of fire think of
[12:50] it those eyes that were once dimmed with
[12:52] tears of sorrow and pity those eyes that
[12:55] wept with compassion at the grave of
[12:57] Lazarus those eyes that saw not the evil
[13:01] of the murderers who hanged him on a
[13:04] cross but in sorrow cried my father
[13:07] forgive them now those eyes are a flame
[13:10] of fire in the eyes of a judge who will
[13:13] recompense those who rejected him of all
[13:17] the human emotions he manifested the
[13:20] most when he appeared as the son of man
[13:24] was this
[13:26] one he wept
[13:34] often yet being that
[13:37] weeping and that
[13:39] sorrow there was still
[13:42] God and those same eyes saw visions that
[13:46] looked deep within the hearts of men and
[13:48] read their very thoughts and knew all
[13:51] their various ways blazing out of mortal
[13:53] lives was God who cried to those who him
[13:57] not who knew him not for what he
[14:01] was and so I I hope I'm sure that it it
[14:06] startles you the same as it did me to
[14:09] think uh we we think remember but but
[14:12] well I think a lot of times we get a
[14:14] false conception of what Christianity is
[14:17] that you know it's all baby blue skies
[14:19] and white puffy
[14:21] clouds you know uh but I'm sorry it's
[14:24] just not that way amen uh and and don't
[14:27] get me wrong uh uh there was uh you know
[14:30] he did Express the love quite a bit in
[14:32] his word uh but it wasn't uh I tell you
[14:35] who it was it was expressed to the most
[14:37] thank you sir it was actually to his
[14:39] bride
[14:41] amen yes sir uh because all throughout
[14:45] the Scriptures it it it expressed over
[14:47] and over the majority of it his love was
[14:49] to John his disciple amen and John types
[14:53] you yes and so thank the Lord that when
[14:57] his his love pred dominantly through the
[14:59] the scriptures what had to have been
[15:01] expressed to John because that's the
[15:03] Bride of Jesus Christ uh Mark 10 1021
[15:07] and and and and and John 131 and John
[15:12] 13:23 and and John
[15:15] 19:26 I want you to realize John did
[15:19] John actually had a revelation that
[15:21] Jesus loves
[15:23] me and you got to get a revelation
[15:25] friends that Jesus loves me yes amen I
[15:29] don't think it's coincidence that that
[15:31] he would allow John under the
[15:32] inspiration of the Holy Ghost that
[15:34] constantly refer back saying Jesus Loves
[15:37] Me amen amen and and and so all
[15:41] throughout the scriptures uh uh uh John
[15:45] 202 verse 2 he says John
[15:49] 217 uh John
[15:51] 2120 and so all throughout the
[15:53] scriptures his love was predominantly
[15:56] projected to John praise God here here's
[16:00] a here's a startling one when we think
[16:02] of
[16:05] compassion cuz he was a man full of
[16:07] compassion is that right but his
[16:12] compassion
[16:14] strangely when he saw the multitudes he
[16:17] was moved with
[16:21] compassion
[16:22] and over and over and over through the
[16:27] scriptures when he would see the ones
[16:30] that were there remember the multitude
[16:33] they were only there for fishes and
[16:34] Loaves yes sir amen
[16:40] amen Methodist Baptist
[16:44] Pentecostal first and second pool yes
[16:47] sir come on
[16:48] somebody why why would we not have the
[16:51] same if we have the spirit of God in us
[16:55] our compassion ought to be to our p this
[17:00] Breen we ought not to look at them as oh
[17:03] just a bunch of Cannon
[17:05] F sir you know that's you know that's
[17:08] predominant in the message that wasn't
[17:10] predominant in Christ life though sir
[17:13] the you can search it out friends over
[17:15] and over through the scriptures Jesus
[17:18] had come he was moved with compassion
[17:21] when he saw the hungry
[17:24] Baptist yes sir oh my don't you see how
[17:27] mess people are Miss by Miles friend and
[17:30] claim to have the Holy Ghost and can't
[17:32] even have a love for a
[17:36] Pentecostal can't even have love for
[17:39] somebody that may be a different belief
[17:40] of of a of a message rank you know this
[17:44] I don't care what you believe I still
[17:46] love you
[17:48] Hallelujah Thunders Peru whatever you
[17:50] want to neighbor better it we ought to
[17:52] still love him we ought to still have
[17:55] compassion for him Jesus said this this
[18:00] is a few places in the scripture where
[18:02] he says this is how I'm
[18:06] feeling and and it's and it's in excuse
[18:09] me it's in uh Mark
[18:13] 81 in those days the multitude being
[18:17] very great and having nothing to eat
[18:19] Jesus called his disciples unto him
[18:21] saying Toto them
[18:24] I this is what he's saying I he he
[18:28] telling us this is how I'm feeling I
[18:32] have compassion onto multitudes because
[18:36] they have now been with me three days
[18:40] and have nothing to eat the ones that
[18:43] were just there for
[18:44] handout but yet he would he he would
[18:47] look beyond that and see a soul that's
[18:49] hungry and want to feed him oh friends
[18:54] don't don't don't you see we are we got
[18:55] that's where our compassion is we can't
[18:58] just have compassion on our children and
[19:00] and our own church but it has to go
[19:02] beyond that has to go deeper than that
[19:06] amen Jesus speaking of his emotions
[19:10] brother B tells us this that remember
[19:13] Jesus as as he had in the lesson this
[19:15] morning he never used his power for
[19:18] himself he used it for others that's
[19:21] what it was sent for you think some he
[19:24] says sometime he says why would a man
[19:26] that was so full of power like him would
[19:28] ever be SI have to be sick yes sir I've
[19:31] read in some book somewhere he raised up
[19:33] that boy the Widow son from na I believe
[19:36] Prince after David and he sat on a rock
[19:37] and groan with a headache he bore our
[19:41] infirmities bear means to pack them see
[19:44] he bore and had all these things like he
[19:47] we have he he had
[19:50] sickness he had
[19:52] Temptations He had trouble he had
[19:57] fluster
[20:02] Jesus Jesus had
[20:06] frustrations just as we have
[20:10] because he had to be the right kind of a
[20:15] mediator so he had to be a partaker the
[20:20] husbandman of the fruit before he would
[20:27] know and we let frustrations take over
[20:30] and we we we discredit our testimony and
[20:33] and and Satan tries to say see you ain't
[20:35] got the Holy Ghost see you ain't a
[20:38] Christian he was God friends H and he
[20:42] had FR now oh let me make a disclaimer
[20:45] let me back up uh please uh uh don't
[20:49] don't don't take this collectively and
[20:51] try to justify your anger with a with a
[20:54] scripture you understand what I'm saying
[20:57] don't don't try to just justify your
[20:58] frustration say well Jesus was
[21:00] frustrated so I can you know you
[21:02] understand what I'm saying this is not
[21:04] this is not a a study for an excuse but
[21:07] but it's so that you can realize that
[21:09] Christ knows exactly where you're at
[21:12] amen that that that that we can see
[21:14] Christ sure he's high and lifted up but
[21:16] yet he also came down and suffered
[21:18] Humanity just like we do is that right
[21:21] and he did it for a purpose for we could
[21:24] so that we could have a high priest that
[21:26] could be touched with the feeling of our
[21:30] infirmities is that right but was in all
[21:33] points tempted like we are yet without
[21:37] sin amen so he could be
[21:39] frustrated and not be sinning amen he
[21:42] could be angry and not sinning amen
[21:46] that's right amen he could be not
[21:49] grieved but much grieved and not sin
[21:52] amen praise the Lord amen watch the and
[21:57] we find here that they says because of
[21:59] him being a high priest watch this in
[22:01] the Old Testament every high priest
[22:03] taken from the men is ordained for men
[22:05] and things pertaining to God that he may
[22:08] offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins
[22:11] who can have compassion on the ignorant
[22:13] and on them that are out of the way for
[22:16] that he himself also is compassed about
[22:18] with infirmity what's that saying and in
[22:21] the Old Testament the high priest first
[22:23] had to offer a sacrifice for himself
[22:26] amen that's right that's why Angels
[22:28] didn't come down and preach to you
[22:30] hallelujah
[22:32] amen because they wouldn't have the
[22:34] compassion they wouldn't they would not
[22:36] be able to understand what you're going
[22:38] through and Christ did the same that's
[22:41] why God came down in flesh so that he
[22:44] could understand what you're going
[22:46] through so that he could remember he
[22:49] wasn't a fallen man he was just dealing
[22:51] with Fallen Humanity we're Fallen men
[22:53] dealing with Fallen
[22:56] Humanity and he still had a headach amen
[23:01] amen praise the Lord for there is one
[23:04] God and one mediator between God and man
[23:07] that's the man Christ Jesus oh I love
[23:10] him for it Hallelujah you know God the
[23:14] Bible says that his voice wasn't heard
[23:16] in the streets but there was also times
[23:19] in Mark 6:45 where he would constrain
[23:22] them in other words he would drive them
[23:24] or force them or threaten them to get
[23:27] into the ship
[23:29] and also Bible says that Jesus cried and
[23:31] said he that believeth on me believeth
[23:33] not on him that sent me believeth but on
[23:35] him that sent me and that cry actually
[23:37] means to cry out or speak with a loud
[23:39] voice so though he was his voice wasn't
[23:42] heard in the streets there was also
[23:44] times where he' rais his voice amen
[23:47] that's exactly right and before we get
[23:49] into this too much I I I want to you may
[23:51] be wondering well uh and this was a
[23:54] shock to me I want to First focus on the
[23:57] Happy Time times of
[23:59] Jesus and and sad to say uh and I wish
[24:04] it could be a longer uh uh portion of
[24:07] this service it's going to be very
[24:11] short now remember I'm just telling you
[24:14] what when when there's emotion that he's
[24:16] feeling or we can read something and
[24:18] then say well I bet you he was feeling
[24:20] this way but remember I'm just
[24:22] collecting when it's saying this is how
[24:24] he's
[24:25] feeling okay the Bible tells us here
[24:28] that when the Centurion came before
[24:30] Jesus and we all know the story the
[24:33] Bible says when Jesus heard it he
[24:36] marveled and said unto them that that
[24:39] followed verily I say unto you I have
[24:42] not found so great a Faith No not in
[24:45] Israel but notice this marveled it
[24:48] actually means to Marvel Wonder have an
[24:52] admiration or
[24:55] admire we think the the king of
[24:59] glory but he could look at a Roman
[25:03] Centurion a
[25:08] gentile how many y'all know what I'm
[25:10] talking about you you got an elder uh
[25:13] you know no doubt uh uh we look up my
[25:16] pastor I look up to him and I admire him
[25:19] right if you you you look at your pastor
[25:22] your daddy or your grandpa or you know I
[25:25] love older people I just you know just
[25:27] something about me you know to see them
[25:28] seasoned veterans and you see a
[25:30] character in them and you see a
[25:31] solidness and an anchor and and I I
[25:34] admire old saints of God that's been
[25:36] serving the lord for years that does
[25:38] something to me and so we we we know
[25:41] that we have somebody in our life that
[25:42] we admire and like wow I would love to
[25:46] be like that I'd love to have that kind
[25:49] of Faith oh I help I hope I'm that uh
[25:52] you know I don't know about you but I
[25:54] love to see a old Sint of God that's
[25:56] just as sweet and tender and just you
[25:59] know uh uh every time I I see sister
[26:02] Marilyn Brown I think you know brother
[26:03] Brown she just I'm telling you brother
[26:05] she just gold you know you know I mean I
[26:09] mean it's just a character and a
[26:11] sweetness when you get around it you
[26:13] just you you you like you just want to
[26:15] you know patter or something just kind
[26:18] of you know what I'm talking about you
[26:19] you know what I mean it just and and so
[26:22] and so and so it's something about him
[26:24] friend that you admire that person but
[26:26] but but friend the king of kings and
[26:29] Lord of lords looked on him was like
[26:34] wow he
[26:36] admired the Roman
[26:40] Centurion and as we read at the
[26:42] beginning the Bible says in that hour
[26:45] Jesus
[26:47] rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee
[26:51] oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that
[26:53] thou H has hid these things from the
[26:55] wise and prudent and Hast revealed them
[26:57] un to babes even so fathers for so it
[27:00] seemed good in your sight and so Jesus
[27:05] what what made him
[27:07] excited is when his children caught the
[27:11] Revelation see see
[27:15] God you know you know you know you know
[27:18] this is what kills me about about about
[27:20] Minister sometimes is that is is you
[27:23] know I've seen Brothers preach and they
[27:25] ain't even preaching to the congregation
[27:27] they're preaching to the pastor and
[27:29] expressing how deep they are you know
[27:31] and trying to be so revelated but when
[27:33] the disciples broke when Jesus broke the
[27:35] bed and the disciples handed out in the
[27:37] baskets they didn't have the basket way
[27:39] up here said going brother get you
[27:41] peace huh is that right that's right
[27:44] that's right Brothers ministers are
[27:45] supposed to bring it down say go on
[27:46] brother get your get your handful that's
[27:49] what Ministry is supposed to do it say
[27:51] go on get you some brother the ministry
[27:53] is supposed to look at children go I got
[27:55] to be mindful let me say something for
[27:57] the little ones let me put a picture on
[28:00] the projector to see if they'll catch it
[28:02] is that right that's what real Ministry
[28:04] is for friends Ministry is to break it
[28:07] down and bring it down so ly can
[28:11] understand it's exactly right and Jesus
[28:15] he rejoiced when that happened because
[28:17] God is not trying to keep the Revelation
[28:19] from you he's trying to get it to you
[28:23] that's what makes God happy Hallelujah
[28:26] if he Rejoice then he'll Rejoice right
[28:30] now he rejoiced in spirit amen I want to
[28:35] make him happy don't you you imagine
[28:38] that friends it's not it's not us oh
[28:40] laboring at the computer oh I got to
[28:44] understand hallu and and and God sitting
[28:47] back
[28:48] there look
[28:50] at that's not God God
[28:54] rejoices in
[28:56] spirit is that right the Bible tells us
[28:59] he says I have no Greater Joy than to
[29:02] hear that my children walk in
[29:05] [Music]
[29:06] truth you say John said it no he didn't
[29:10] Lord Jesus said it praise God and the
[29:13] Bible also tells us in Hebrews 12:2
[29:16] looking unto Jesus the author and
[29:18] finisher of our faith who for
[29:21] the that was set before him endured the
[29:24] cross despising the shame and has sat
[29:26] down at the right hand of the the Throne
[29:27] of
[29:32] God who for the
[29:36] joy show me where there was Joy at
[29:39] Calvary if you didn't have this
[29:41] scripture didn't look like much
[29:44] joy
[29:47] huh but when he was on the cross yeah we
[29:51] were on his
[29:52] mind come on Friends it was Joy you know
[29:56] there's something about happiness
[29:58] there's something and you know uh I
[30:00] think it was last week week before last
[30:02] I stumbled across a study that was
[30:05] done uh uh recently it's a recent study
[30:09] they they did it over uh um
[30:13] um W with a study of over 700 people uh
[30:17] from Finland Sweden and Taiwan and and
[30:21] they it was they showed them uh pictures
[30:24] or slide or read them a few words and
[30:26] every time that that they saw this
[30:29] picture of this slide they they wanted
[30:31] them to express what what their body was
[30:34] feeling emotionally and and as we see
[30:37] here look at look at anger you got the
[30:41] fist see right there the heart look at
[30:44] look at uh uh Pride look at look at
[30:47] shame you got the cheeks blushed and
[30:50] what this is is kind of like a mood ring
[30:51] of the
[30:53] body right and so that when somebody
[30:56] felt it uh you know neutral surprise or
[30:59] sadness look at the lump in their throat
[31:00] you know in the eyes but but here's what
[31:03] I want you to see uh out of all of
[31:07] them

[45:16] it that's that's my nature you know
[45:18] stressful situations I I sometimes I'll
[45:20] laugh when I shouldn't laugh but it's
[45:22] just a nervousness you know so bear with
[45:24] me uh but but anyway thinking about our
[45:27] Lord so when when we go into these
[45:29] things friends what I'm saying is you
[45:32] got to get in the
[45:33] spirit you you you can't depend upon the
[45:36] song leader to preach it down and you
[45:39] can't wait for brother Brooks to preach
[45:40] it down you ought to bring it with you
[45:45] amen praise God that's true friends we
[45:48] all play a part is what I'm saying we
[45:51] all play a part and and it's so
[45:52] important so when we talking about the
[45:54] goodness of God I'm trying to I'm trying
[45:56] to uh uh get through you know when we
[45:58] thought when we and here's what I want
[45:59] to show you a couple roller coasters of
[46:01] Jesus's motions watch
[46:05] this brother now watch this Jesus says
[46:07] this now if we didn't have the brother
[46:09] brm said about when brother when Jesus
[46:11] says this and he said unto them go ye
[46:13] and tell that fox behold I cast out
[46:15] devil and I do cures tomorrow today and
[46:18] tomorrow and on the third day I shall be
[46:19] perfected brother brandham tells us the
[46:22] Lord himself had a sense ofor humor you
[46:25] know he said Herod go tell that
[46:27] fox yeah and so right here is Jesus with
[46:31] a sense of humor am right yes sir we
[46:34] wouldn't know that without a prophet
[46:38] amen but now I want I want you to see is
[46:40] verse
[46:41] 34 two verses later he says oh Jerusalem
[46:46] Jerusalem which killest the prophets and
[46:49] stonest them that are sent unto thee how
[46:52] off would I have gathered thy children
[46:54] together as a hinda gather herw on her
[46:56] wings and you would
[46:58] not and so our lord Jesus goes from a
[47:02] sense of humor to weeping over his
[47:05] church in two
[47:13] verses I he's been on the Mountaintop
[47:15] one minute and in the lowest Valley 10
[47:18] minutes later and then and then Satan
[47:21] will beats you up even more and say see
[47:23] God Don't Love You Yeah amen he look at
[47:26] you our Lord our Lord friends do you see
[47:31] why it's so important cuz we're talking
[47:33] about Humanity we're talking about our
[47:36] human emotions I don't care how tough we
[47:38] Brothers try to be we're all fragile yes
[47:41] sir that's right we're all
[47:44] emotional that's right wh watch watch
[47:46] what Jesus says here when he's talking
[47:48] about the when the woman came as and he
[47:50] at Simon Lep's house and and and she
[47:52] anoints the O and Jesus says and he and
[47:54] he Jesus said let her alone why trouble
[47:57] you her she have wrought a good work on
[48:00] me and so here here here Jesus is having
[48:04] a blessful time being being anointed by
[48:07] by by his little bride and in the middle
[48:10] of it people are changing it by rebuking
[48:13] him and he says what are you doing let
[48:15] her alone amen she's brought a good work
[48:18] on me notice this friends it's highs and
[48:21] lows praise the Lord disappointment
[48:25] watch Satan couldn't get him so he went
[48:27] after his children to try and torment
[48:30] him no wonder Jesus got so emotional in
[48:33] certain
[48:38] situations Luke
[48:40] 19:41 and when he was come near he
[48:42] beheld the city and wept over it saying
[48:46] if thou Hast known even now thou at
[48:49] least in this thy day the things which
[48:51] belong unto thy peace but now they are
[48:55] HID from Thine Eyes the day shall come
[48:57] upon thee when thy enemy shall cast a
[48:58] trench about thee and Compass thee round
[49:00] about and keep thee on every side and
[49:02] shall lay thee even with the ground and
[49:04] thy children within thee and there shall
[49:06] not leave in one thee one stone upon
[49:09] another because thou knewest not the
[49:10] time of the visitation
[49:13] watch and he went into the temple and
[49:16] began to cast them out that so doves
[49:18] therein and them that bought saying it
[49:21] is written my house shall be the House
[49:23] of Prayer but you have made it a din of
[49:27] Lees
[49:42] weeping is this all right is this
[49:45] helping you how me appreciates the word
[49:48] amen Brothers watch Jesus I read this to
[49:51] you at the beginning when Jesus saw the
[49:53] man with the withered hand Jesus when he
[49:56] saw them and and they begin to uh uh uh
[49:59] try to try to get Jesus catch Jesus and
[50:01] things and Jesus says this he said and
[50:03] he tells him he says and he said unto
[50:06] the man which had to wither hand stand
[50:07] forth and he said unto them it is lawful
[50:09] to do good on the Sabbath day or do evil
[50:11] to save life or to kill but they held
[50:13] their peace and when he had looked round
[50:16] about on them with anger being grieved
[50:19] for the hardness of their hearts he
[50:21] saith unto the man hold on just a minute
[50:24] I got to go pray for three days and fast
[50:26] and then I'll be back brother on well
[50:30] I'm not worthy cuz I've got this anger
[50:35] here oh tell me we don't go through that
[50:37] yes

[50:40] amen yes sir he didn't go on no
[50:42] three-day fast sir he didn't you know
[50:45] you know we do something wrong and we

[50:51] days huh
[50:53] and oh you know what I'm talking about
[50:56] don't tell me it we at least one person
[50:58] got to fire business day waiting period
[51:01] before they can go be spiritual
[51:03] again listen friends when you repent
[51:06] there's no five-day waiting period sir
[51:08] when you repent you ain't got to wait
[51:10] three business days and if it's a
[51:11] holiday oh man the Christmas has come so
[51:14] you ain't got to wait till the first of
[51:16] the year to be forgiven it's
[51:19] instantaneously if you repent
[51:21] automatically it goes into the bleach of
[51:23] the blood of Jesus Christ and it's for
[51:25] for given we are the ones that have the
[51:28] problem of accepting that forgiveness
[51:30] and realizing there's no waiting
[51:33] period
[51:37] hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord
[51:41] praise God truth friends it's right we
[51:44] all go through
[51:47] it talking about
[51:50] Jesus when when he saw James and John
[51:53] and them and and and wanted to call Fire
[51:55] Heaven the Bible says he turned and
[51:56] rebuked them and said ye not know what
[51:59] manner of spirit you are
[52:04] of look at this after the Resurrection
[52:07] The Bible said he abraded them with
[52:10] their unbelief and Hardness of
[52:14] Heart the Bible says on his road to
[52:17] emusu he said unto them oh fools and
[52:20] slow of heart to believe all that the
[52:21] prophets have
[52:24] spoken
[52:27] see
[52:28] Jesus the Bible says Not only was he
[52:32] displeased but the Bible says when he
[52:34] saw it look they were having a
[52:36] ministerial meeting talking about
[52:37] marriage and divorce and they thought
[52:39] they were too spiritual to have children
[52:41] come up and and have Jesus touch him and
[52:43] Jesus got so so upset he wasn't just
[52:46] displeased the Bible said he was much
[52:50] displeased and said unto them suffer ye
[52:53] little children to come unto me and
[52:54] forbid them not for such is the kingdom
[52:56] of
[52:58] God the Bible also tells us that
[53:01] whenever he he he he could there do no
[53:03] Mighty work sa that he laid his hands
[53:05] upon a a few sick folk and healed them
[53:08] and he marveled because of their
[53:10] unbelief looked at him with Wonder and
[53:12] Amor you like you got to be kidding

[53:30] not to use it to justify yourself but
[53:32] don't what I want you to understand is
[53:34] is don't let Satan discredit your

[1:03:36] anxious to distress well I love this to
[1:03:39] perplex the mind of one by suggesting
[1:03:42] Scruples or
[1:03:44] doubts Jesus had suggestions of
[1:03:48] doubts nevertheless let this
[1:03:51] cup was that a doubt yes because that
[1:03:54] was what his purpose was that was the
[1:03:57] word well you know what a scruple means
[1:03:59] if you look at the defin a scruple means
[1:04:01] to
[1:04:03] hesitate you just hesitate I don't know
[1:04:08] that's a scruple and Jesus
[1:04:11] he
[1:04:17] hesitated this is your
[1:04:20] savior thank you
[1:04:22] Lord thank you Lord see he goes through
[1:04:25] the same things he went through the same
[1:04:28] thing friends now tell me Satan don't
[1:04:30] use these same tactics and to make you
[1:04:33] discredit your your your
[1:04:36] testimony amen he does me friends amen
[1:04:39] do you do you understand why this
[1:04:41] totally transformed my thinking of Our
[1:04:42] Lord it gave me a whole new outlook
[1:04:45] because I realized God put these these
[1:04:48] emotions in here for a purpose so that
[1:04:50] we would understand he wants us to know
[1:04:54] he already felt it he don't want you to
[1:04:56] just to look say he's the high priest
[1:04:57] and be touched up by the feeling of our
[1:04:59] infirmities he put it in the gospel and
[1:05:01] wrote it out there for you so that you
[1:05:03] could see it and go oh yeah he did
[1:05:06] experience it it wasn't just a thought
[1:05:09] and you know I kind of I kind of think
[1:05:10] I'm afraid but it struck his innermost
[1:05:16] being watch this roller coaster when
[1:05:19] he's at the Last Supper he said verily I
[1:05:21] say unto you a servant is is not greater
[1:05:23] than is Lord neither he that is sent
[1:05:26] greater than he that sent him if you do
[1:05:29] these things happy happy happy are ye
[1:05:33] amen but look at here he says he talk
[1:05:37] he's talking about when when Judas is
[1:05:38] going to be received he says when Jesus
[1:05:40] had said thus he was troubled in his
[1:05:43] spirit and testify and said verily I say
[1:05:45] unto you that one of you shall betray me
[1:05:48] and that troubled is the same word I
[1:05:50] just showed
[1:05:51] you striking so here he is doing
[1:05:54] something that we should be happy about
[1:05:56] foot washing communion but immediately
[1:05:59] while that's
[1:06:04] happening
[1:06:06] Hallelujah see we have roller coasters
[1:06:09] of
[1:06:10] emotions and God knows all about it
[1:06:12] friends God knows all about it he knows
[1:06:15] what fear is about the Bible says who in
[1:06:19] the day picking it up in the yellow who
[1:06:20] in the days of his flesh when he had
[1:06:22] offered up prayers and supplication with
[1:06:24] strong crying and tears unto him that
[1:06:26] was able to save him from death and was
[1:06:28] heard in that he
[1:06:33] feared though he were a son yet learned
[1:06:36] he obedience by the things which he
[1:06:38] suffered so Christ in the Garden of
[1:06:42] Gethsemane he he he fear struck him
[1:06:45] because he realized oh if I don't
[1:06:48] go they won't be
[1:06:53] saved
[1:06:57] he offered up strong crying and tears
[1:06:59] where where the water where it was tears
[1:07:02] of blood that poured from his body and
[1:07:05] he and he feared because God heard him
[1:07:09] Ben said no doubt
[1:07:16] nevertheless I wonder if that was it
[1:07:18] with his
[1:07:20] nevertheless that fear nevertheless no
[1:07:23] no no no he caught Glimpse and no doubt
[1:07:25] the panoramic chain he like nevertheless
[1:07:28] not my
[1:07:34] will remember fear was not a dominant
[1:07:37] force in his life though he did feel it
[1:07:39] friends and we shouldn't let fear be a
[1:07:41] dominant force in
[1:07:43] ours the Bible tells us
[1:07:47] this that when he went to the grave of
[1:07:49] Lazarus he groaned in his spirit and was
[1:07:52] troubled
[1:07:54] same same same
[1:07:56] word wherein they had laid him and he
[1:07:58] said unto them Jesus Lord come see and
[1:08:01] Jesus
[1:08:03] wept then said to the Jews behold how he
[1:08:06] loved him and some of them could not
[1:08:08] this man which opened the eyes of the
[1:08:10] blind have caused that even this man
[1:08:12] should have died Jesus therefore again
[1:08:16] groaning in himself cometh to the grave
[1:08:19] and it was a cave and a stone laid upon
[1:08:21] it see though he was God in remember
[1:08:24] remember friends though he already saw
[1:08:26] the vision that Lazarus was going to be
[1:08:28] raised brother B talks about that but
[1:08:32] still there was a human element that had
[1:08:34] preeminence that he still groaned and
[1:08:38] wept don't you understand friends you
[1:08:40] are the elect of God and though we've
[1:08:43] caught the vision and know there's going
[1:08:45] to be a resurrection they still go
[1:08:48] through groanings and weepings in our
[1:08:50] own selves
[1:08:52] Glory
[1:08:54] amen amen it's the vice of
[1:09:07] [Music]
[1:09:11] Resurrection the Bible tells us in
[1:09:13] Isaiah 53 23 and 4 for he shall grow up
[1:09:18] before him as a tender plant and as a
[1:09:20] root out of dry ground he's have no form
[1:09:23] nor less and when we shall see him
[1:09:25] there's no beauty that we should desire
[1:09:27] him you know when you look at Jesus you
[1:09:30] did you know you look at a preacher and
[1:09:32] you just like
[1:09:33] wow you know you look at a preacher
[1:09:36] you're like man he looks like a preacher
[1:09:38] it's got that look you know but when you
[1:09:41] looked at Jesus you didn't look at him
[1:09:44] and go wow that's
[1:09:46] God
[1:09:48] no because the Bible says there's no
[1:09:50] comly there's no appearance there's no
[1:09:52] splendor that when you'd see him you'd
[1:09:55] go wow that's God because it was a
[1:09:57] different set of eyes that you could
[1:09:59] look at him go wow that's God cuz he hid
[1:10:02] himself in
[1:10:04] humanity he said he has despised and
[1:10:06] rejected of man A Man of Sorrows and
[1:10:10] acquainted with grief you know that
[1:10:13] Sorrows actually means physical and

[1:11:06] angel came down and strengthened
[1:11:08] him right but I want you to know that
[1:11:11] was not God's perfect will Jesus did not
[1:11:14] want an angel to come down and

[1:16:56] down brother Brook brother Brooks three
[1:16:58] and a half year Ministry and it aged him
[1:17:01] 20
[1:17:05] years he said and and he says where he
[1:17:09] probably turned gray and grim look on
[1:17:11] his face where he had suffered not so
[1:17:13] much physically but it it was Agony the
[1:17:17] Bible said that his blood and water

[1:19:01] of God you know you I understand we go

[1:20:14] will be he will come speak do signs and
[1:20:19] wonders and go away with the broken
[1:20:21] heart because people turn him
[1:20:28] down that same Jesus that I tried to
[1:20:31] bring to you this
[1:20:34] evening you have the ability right now
[1:20:38] to break his
[1:20:41] heart if you turn him down he'll go away
[1:20:46] with a broken
[1:20:51] heart see that's that's that's that's
[1:20:53] the heart of God if you turn him down he

[1:20:59] heart he don't hate you but it really
[1:21:02] hurts
[1:21:05] him friends that's the nature of God
[1:21:07] don't you see how I'll be honest with
[1:21:09] you Satan painted a picture of God that
[1:21:11] was totally wrong but the more I look
[1:21:13] into I'm thinking what my my conception
[1:21:15] of what God is and his character how he
[1:21:18] responds to my mistakes my sins my
[1:21:20] faults my failures is totally wrong
[1:21:22] wrong my my thought is my my thought of
[1:21:26] how he's reacting when I do wrong is
[1:21:28] totally
[1:21:31] wrong that's right friends we we we got
[1:21:33] to think of him like this is what what
[1:21:35] the message is all about so that we can
[1:21:38] know the nature of God God when when
[1:21:41] when we when we when we shut the door
[1:21:43] and close the door he don't say
[1:21:46] fine but it breaks his
[1:21:51] heart he goes away like man how am I how
[1:21:55] am I going to get him and then you know
[1:21:57] what he'll send brother Craig two weeks

[1:23:03] create a creation and then come down in
[1:23:06] flesh and then serve his
[1:23:10] creation see that's the nature of God
