herself ready oh my God we're going to turn to Leviticus 25 and from Leviticus 25 we're going to go to Romans 6 9:16 oh my goodness Leviticus 25 we dealt with the coming of the lord we dealt with um uh the 50th year Jubilee on Wednesday oh we had a wonderful time God didn't manifest himself and uh oh I I tell you what I just feel like pausing right now shouting amen honestly that's just the way I feel right I mean it's just just the power of God Amen that's that I feel here this morning amen amen hallelujah if it you know I know I've got a message and that's the most important thing so I got to preach it first first then I'll shout Brother Rich amen you know God is so good I don't know whether you're feeling the presence of the Lord like I I am but I trust that you are Leviticus 2511 a jubilee shall that 50th year be unto you ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy Vine undressed Romans 9:11 oh my God surely God is good to us how many of y'all believe that the Lord is soon to come you know we've heard these things for years we've heard it for years and I can remember during the time when I first first got saved I thought the Lord was to come then but never have it been so clear as it is now Romans 9:16 so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy ooo Jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for being so good to us Lord we thank you for being one in a million we thank you for allowing us to be partakers of this great event that's going on right now the rapturing of your church Lord taking us from glory to glory amen amen oh God and we thank you this morning for just being who you are amen and how merciful have you been to us Lord truly you have not dealt with us according to our sins and father we're so grateful of for you and of you and we appreciate everything you have done for us and in return we'd like to offer ourselves yes as a bond slave as a love slave as a prisoner of Christ as your servant Paul stated Lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for everything bless each and every heart here this morning we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be [Music] seated thank you sir I want to extend this a little bit from the 50th year Jubilee I kind of got a theme uh behind it three kinds of Believers but uh you know I I want to say by the grace of God that you and I are living in the greatest time ever wherein that there are a people that's going to cheat death yes sir Hallelujah the the Bible tells us that we will be changed Amen in a moment of a twinkling of an eye and you and I can't even imagine how fast that is but it is fast I was talking to brother Craig or Pastor Craig down in Lima I was just moved to call him and uh he and I and others I know are going through the same travail It's s something that's happening and and you know I'm glad about it because I'm being consumed by it and that is the coming of the Lord I I just don't want to do nothing outside of what he wants me to do and you know something else is happening and uh with us and I believe that God is going to increase it amen and when God does then the church will know but you know I I'm I'm looking at this thing because he he he he was telling me brother Craig how he had been studying on uh Billy Graham and that Billy Graham is uh will be preaching his last message in November worldwide and you know and I know that Billy Graham is the last Angel left and when those angels left Sodom the Bible tells me that they pulled lot and his family out it was a pull they had to grab lot cuzz he didn't even want to go and that's what's happening to a lot of Christians now that got a hold of the world but they don't want to let it go but listen by the grace of God Amen when when those when they cleared out of Sodom we find out that is when the fire fell we don't know how long it took for those angels to pull uh lot uh and his family out of Sodom but but remember as they were going up the mountain Miss lot turned that's right come on somebody she turned and when she turned amen she caught a glimpse of the atomic fire now I want you to know and I know you know amen that in that message three kinds of Believers the prophet tells us how those unbelievers those make Believers wait till the last minute and they reveal them themselves that Judah spirit that that spirit that that that identifies the word as being something that's false come on somebody and you and I have seen it amen with with with uh uh the many people that are falling away and and and and and and and and those movements like uh believe the sign and they have waited but it is what they're supposed to do yeah amen oh my God I'm getting excited it's what they're they can't do nothing else because they must play the role of betrayal hallelujah amen but at the same time while lot was being pulled out of Sodom amen we find Abraham Hallelujah being changed from glory to glory to glory amen to make a rapture that's why you feeling what you're feeling something is moving and you can't help yourself come on somebody amen because really this message is only for the elected it is For Those whom God has opened their eyes to uh uh this message you can't see it if you're not elected to see it Hallelujah and it's by God choosing you Amen to make cor Rapture amen that's why I read that scripture so then it is not of him that willth nor him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy amen Lord hallelujah come on somebody amen just just coming I hope I can read this it was only for the elected God's chosen and that's the way it is today not him that runthe it is God that have mercy amen it's God that does it God by his grac amen Jesus said no man can come to me except God except my father draw him and all the father has given me will come to me it's God's grace that he choose the church before the foundation of the world Amen that church will hear the word of God Amen they'll turn every Creed down yes they'll turn every organization every denomination that's contrary down and they'll serve God by the power of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah there certainly no the trumpet sound because he said my sheep Hearth my voice and a stranger they will not follow hey what are you talking about the word God's Voice Hallelujah in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God Amen but it was the voice of God Amen that's why we can't help ourselves Hallelujah God ain't looking for no organization or denomination he said I have prepared myself a body and that body is you hallelujah amen God is looking to to fill himself in you amen hallelujah sacrifice and offering thou would not but a body H has thou prepared me a body of Believers a body that's been born amen before it can be a body of human being before I could act as a human before I could walk like a human before I could talk like a human I have to be born a human amen that's right now would not on a tree how know how I acted how could he ever say don't act like that the only way he could be what he would be to be born like me amen right no matter who it is you know you say well you know you think you listen well Christians don't how do you know Christians don't act like that until you born a Christian amen a Christian is not something that you join it's not some large or some some some something that you can be part of it's some the only way you can be a Christian you must be born amen hallelujah so how can you tell me how I'm supposed to act until you born like me hallelujah hallelujah come on somebody let let let's that's like looking at a dog he said that dog shouldn't be acting like that Hallelujah you'll never know what a dog supposed to act like until you born a dog Hallelujah you and I are blessed people we ought to be so happy that there's a pull on our lives listen if your if there's not a pull on your life something is wrong yes sir if you can't sense the urgency of staying under the blood Lord something is wrong right and the only way that you're going to survive this you must be found under the blood Hallelujah come on somebody it ain't your brand brand of religion anymore come on somebody amen God once D dealt with organization because of their ignorance and the Bible said God no longer wink at ignorance why because the word of God has been restored Hallelujah come on somebody but listen to what I want to say about Billy Graham because never in history have you had two great Servants of God like William Branham and William Graham both one called Billy Graham and the other one's called Billy gr uh uh Billy brandham amen which the last was h a m at the end of their names and that H is another word for God that's right hello somebody it was the H that God attached to Abram name and Abram name was changed from Abram to Abraham amen hallelujah and when God changed his name amen God said to Abraham look up into the heavens if you can count the stars look at the sea if you can count the number of ss so shall your seed be am blessed are you Abraham because you are the father of many [Music] nations that's right now look at this thing because you got to understand if or robers is dead right the prophet of God is going off the scene the only one left amen is Graham amen and he was the last Angel Amen to what Sodom and gomorah that's why the world hears him they love his voice they got books of his all through the libraries of and everything but now he's getting ready to go off the sea right and if that be true could it be the last call could it be the closing of the Gentile door oh Lord because the next thing that came to Sodom was fire amen hello somebody so and if that be the case if fire is getting ready to destroy Sodom and gomorah amen God is getting ready to lift up his sacrifice come on somebody amen Abraham is getting ready to lift up his sacrifice come on somebody but in lifting up the sacrifice it says Abraham spare yourself I'm not the child I have provided myself a sacrifice Hallelujah in other words your human effort is not the thing that got you here Abraham I was testing you amen Abraham seed God is testing you to see amen what means more to you than anything come on where is your treasure Abraham where is your heart set Hallelujah I have tried you I have tested you and now I know you love me because you offering up your only begotten son Hallelujah I don't know what that means to you amen but I'm offering up the thing that means the most of me Hallelujah come on somebody and by doing so God said i' I provided a sacrifice for you is that all right I provided a sacrifice for you come on somebody your greatest enemy ain't the devil your greatest enemy is you Hallelujah come on somebody you your greatest his enemy is that right and see God says listen he said when you offer up the greatest thing the thing that means to most I I don't care if it's your mother your father your sister your brother your children your wife amen he said when you ready to kill it I'm ready to receive you you don't have to worry about it amen we of Abraham seed amen and just like Moses said said I ain't leaving one who di Hallelujah you know the devil want to say okay if none of my family go I'm going but that wasn't Moses attitude Moses attitude was I'm going and I'm taking everything with me hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hey come on somebody oh I'm taking everything with me you are you excited I'm excited because I believe this is the Jubilee Hallelujah since the opening of the seals since 63 it has now been 50 years we have celebrated 50 years at the opening of the seals and listen on the same date the seals were open it the it met the same dates this year amen every day was on the same day what a coincidence no it wasn't a coincidence it was the design of God 50 years you can go free or you can stay in bondage hello somebody you can go free amen or you can stay in bondage Hallelujah when that Jubilee trumpet sounded I don't care where you are if you are bondage Amen to alcohol you threw the body bottle down if you wasn't bondage to cigarettes you threw the bondage down if you was in bondage to adultery you got away from it I'm going back home I'm going back home and nothing could stop you nothing can stop you whatever had you into bondage was your year to be free this is hallelujah this is your year to free Hallelujah you can let your chains be broken today by the Holy Ghost whatever that has you in bondage you can go free this morning hallelujah hallelujah what do you mean brother Brooks we've come through seven Church ages and the son of man has appeared not a son of man the son of man Hallelujah and when the son of man appeared he came down to Abraham's seed amen come on somebody yes sir just like he did with Abraham walking in the cool of the evening there shall be light Amen in the evening time the path to Glory you will surely find Hallelujah glory to God he comes down in the evening time and he begins to talk with uh Abraham oh come on but there was a disbelieving church Sarah was in the back tent Hallelujah when the angel of the Lord talked amen with Abraham in the cool of to day he said Abraham you going to have a son am Hallelujah and oh Sarah back there in the tent probably just finished looking in the mirror saying to her oh my who is this me and my old age can it be possible that I could have pleasure with my Lord amen that same Angel saw Sarah even though his back was turned to the tent he saw Sarah and he said why did Sarah laugh and Sarah said I did not laugh what did she do she was literally lying in the face of Elohim himself amen if Sarah had not been a part of Abraham God would have Cut Her Off if you wasn't a part of Abraham God would have cut you off if you weren't the seed of God God would have cut you off cuz we all have looked at this message and we've looked at the laws of it and we've said to ourselves can this thing be it's so straight amen can you make can we make it but the Bible said it's not here that will it no he that run it but it's God who shows Mercy not by power not by might but by my spirit say the Lord and According to Hebrew the Bible said God gave Sarah [Applause] strength to receive seed hallelujah what did God do God began to change changer I don't know about you but my God is changing me Hallelujah he's changing me right now from the inside out the world can't see it Hallelujah but transformation is already started Hallelujah I might be wrapped up in this cocoon but one of these old days there's going to be an atomic explosion and I'll be changed from the inside out Hallelujah you see the world is getting ready to get their atomic explosion but it'll be the destruction of their flesh but the atomic explosion that's going to take place on the inside of me amen will change me from this Ile body into a body just like his hallelujah hallelujah what the people don't understand is that God is changing and we who are Christians we're not interested in being a mimic of Christianity we don't want to copy it and we don't want to act like we got it oh amen amen hallelujah we got to have it every bit of it Hallelujah every bit of see we want to be Bond slaves here we want to be prisoners of Christ Hallelujah in the midst of all of these things the Bible said we ought to come together the more when you see that day approaching come together the more that don't mean we got to have church every day but you ought to have church with somebody Hallelujah you ought to be fellowshipping with the with somebody Oh Glory to his name think about it somebody amen think about what I'm saying amen because here we are we are now in in a stage right now where the United States is getting ready to fold up I was talking to my son yesterday one of them and he people are so interested in their business and they com Commerce and everything else just like they were in in in the days of Sodom don't you understand what happened to Sodom Sodom is another type of the United States they increased with Goods one of their problems were amen they got so rich till they had summer houses and winter houses just like Americans amen amen they call them what what they snowbirds or whatever they call them the ones that lives up north go down south when it gets cold come on somebody they got all this luxury amen I can barely Affair afford one house more or less have two Hallelujah and listen they they they they so rich and they so increased with good and that's the TR trick of the devil every age knew what their enemy was every age many of them died Amen to stay a Christian or to declare that they were Christian but y the the enemy of this age is Easy Living amen come on somebody now I'm going to get to something in just a moment because I'm I'm going move from here to something else but I want you to understand about the grace of God hallelujah that we are free you're free amen the only way that you're in bondage is because you letting your mind keep you in bondage amen you you your your bondage is in your mind that's right because he whom the son is set free hallelujah it's free indeed and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen hallelujah yall know what I'm saying y'all remember Johnny Crow Johnny Crow

cheerleaders yet those cheerleaders are are are screaming to the top of their voices but what are they doing they're actually creating an atmosphere that's right and when that atmosphere is created amen somehow it moves from the bleaches over to the players that's right that's true amen and it anoints them and all of a sudden when they would have been cowards they become courageous amen come on somebody so that's what it is in church the atmosphere that's cre encourage the people come on somebody amen God has always been noisy God put the music before the victory Hallelujah when it came to Bringing Down the Walls of Jericho he said I want you to shout and we're getting ready to see the walls of Jericho [Music] fall come on somebody amen Ephesians p 1 Peter 4:17 for this time for the time has come that judgment must began at the house of God and if it first began at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God hallelujah hallelujah come on somebody amen judgment and remember I told you let me read Ezekiel 9:4 you don't have to turn there but I'm going read it and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the Abominations that been done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in mine earring go you after him through a city and smite let not your ey spare neither have ye pity now listen he starts at the house of God and then he goes to the city amen hallelujah why because the purpose of the church was to keep the city safe if the salt lose it savior if it lose the effect you Christians if you lose the effect of Christianity amen if you lose it then the world of this city of De Mo will be judged because of your failures l oh I'mma prove that this morning amen oh so you say what a minute listen so he says s and others he said L um don't spare slay utterly old young both Maids little children women but come not near any man upon whom is a mark and began at My Sanctuary amen then they began at the ancient men which were before the house and he said unto them listen listen close defile the house and fill the courts with the slain and God's I believe it was the Lord that spoke to me this morning he said so is it now the house of God is defiled amen with those who sat in church and have been slain by the enemy they look like they have they have a name that they live and yet they are dead they are defiling the house of God because the angel the death angel is smiting everybody that don't have the Seal of God in their forehead fill the courts with the slain and go ye forth and they went forth and slew in the city amen first Timothy 56 says but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth you talking about zombies and you don't know your Bible talks about zombies it doesn't call them zombies but in the Book of Revelation he said they death will flee from them amen they'll want to die they'll try to die no matter how maed no matter how cut up no matter how they look they'll try to die but death will flee from them come on somebody Hallelujah it won't matter what they look like maybe they might look like they ought to be dead but death will not Comfort them oh come on somebody that was quicker to me just the other day that's right that's why the world is pushing that pushing what what else are they pushing cannibalism yeah yeah they're pushing it these zombies eating people and all of that now they got all kind of drugs that can trigger that kind of Beastly thing that's in you don't tell me it ain't in you it's in you when Titus came to destroy Israel they ate their children in the times of Solomon two women who were who were prostitutes the one said let's eat your baby today and we'll eat your B my baby tomorrow Hallelujah hard times will cause the animalistic nature to come out of so-called humans but let me tell you everything Ain't Human amen hallelujah

come on somebody you better know what you're doing I that's for somebody I don't know where that went but here we are the purpose of the church was to be it means called out listen God when a third of the Angels you've heard this before when a third of the Angels fell God was alarmed but when Adam and Eve when they fell God came down right now watch this as long as Adam and Eve was on one Accord that everything was blessed the Garden of Eden was blessed it was the paradise the presence of God United with Heaven Hallelujah as one Theologian said that you know they didn't need a radio cuz they had they were they were connected amen amen because of the Dome system all they could hear in the morning was angels singing Hallelujah they didn't have to worry about flipping the channels brother amen cuz everything was coming from Heaven hallelujah amen but but when Satan came in and brought a division in the church and Eve fell from her position then God came now watch this as long as Adam and Eve was in their position the whole world was blessed soon as they moved out of their position the whole world was cursed it's never changed amen amen it's never changed amen that's why amen even in households amen when one is out of the out order it God can't bless it not like he wants to is only when they are in order God can bless them same with the church as long as the church is out of order God can't fully bless it it's only when amen you're in order God can bless the way he wants to bless judgment begins at the house of come on somebody oh Lord let's move on Judgment of God never judged Israel until they they they got out of order is come on somebody as long as Israel was with God God blessed them let's put it this way amen God here they come along going to Moab and here come balam bam said don't you know y'all all alike you can marry their sons and daughters or how y'all can marry y'all the same blood huh lot was Abraham's nephew they can go back into the history but you see God had kept them separate Israel was no better than Moab when it came to their lifestyle they did much as Sin as as Moab did come on let me put it this way message people you ain't no better than denominations why cuz you have the same battles they do is the unconditional Covenant that got you amen the smitten Rock come on somebody the pill of fire Hallelujah it is God's grace it is the Covenant that God has given you versus The Covenant that God has given them lot was saved but he had a different Covenant than Abraham amen amen hallelujah come on somebody amen we can't say they ain't saved they're saved but they had a different Covenant they come up in the white Throne judgment Hallelujah but the bride sheep takes a Rapture oh God help us here this morning now listen as long as they stayed true God never got mad with Israel balum tried to curse him and he couldn't find a way to curse him he was going every time he got up to curse Abraham seed you know here he was blessing him blessing him blessing him the kings were mad at him the kings were mad at him said listen I I've hired you to go curse them then the devil inspired him I know what you can do bring them together make them one that ain't the kind of Wess God looking for God wers is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah it ain't about organizational denominationalism it's whether you've been born again Hallelujah come on somebody and if you're born again you'll act the same ahh my so he did what caused the children of Israel to commit hold them with Bo Mo and God got angry Hallelujah listen the world wasn't even judged God could have the world would have went on and on after Adam and Eve but what happened the sons of of God saw the daughters of men they got out of line they got out of order the testimony died amen and the only thing that was left was Noah who kept the generation [Music] clean and because of it God said Noah found Grace in the eyes of God he was the only church left that stayed with the word hallelujah come on but not even his Sons stay with the word cuz they have mingled come on somebody y'all know the word but because the church had come down to such a minority God said it's time to judge it brother bam said it like this he said and God never forgave them amen for burying unbelievers is that tough enough that's the word the Bible said they were judged according to Jude according to Peter they were judged all that were sons of God you mean to tell me all those Sons and Daughters of God only eight Souls were saved hello somebody that's where we are amen is that right listen it is when the church go worldly that God brings judgment on the world there always the grace of God it is guess what the grace of God was in the days of Noah get on the ark amen that was the grace of God get on the ark now I'm giving you Grace I don't care how bad you've been but get on the ark you'll be saved am you know what the grace of God was in the days of of of Moses apply the blood now I'm coming through here the Death Angel is coming but if you want to be saved you in your house apply the blood that was the grace of God God could care less whether you a Jew or Gentile if you applied that blood you were safe hallelujah amen hello amen so was it in our day and I know this is a strange thing but I'm going tell you something God can't change his way he said I'm a God that changes not Hallelujah Hebrews 13 and8 said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday the damn forever amen you said believe preach to me Brother Bruce let me say like this I'm trying to tell you judgment began in the house of God Amen where did Jesus first go he went to Solomon's Temple he took his whip he began to beat them amen because they had made God's Gift a a house of merchandise come on buy a little come on buy this buy that buy i s this s this come on and none of the sacrifice it brought the people Amen to irreverence threw over the money table everything Hallelujah he stood out there and said Jerusalem Jerusalem I would have hovered you I would have tended to you like a hen with her Brew but you would not you rejected me Hallelujah and he said capernium capernium amen city that is called by the name of the angels I would have hovered you come on that's America now the Judgment came on Los Angeles right where zuu Street started the outpouring of the Holy Ghost that's why it's called Los Angeles the city of the Angels Where Angels were appearing but they rejected the gospel coming from from the East to the west and where the carcass is there will the eagle be gathered amen and because you would not you're going you are judged and you'll be your day will be worse than the days of Pompei Hallelujah whether you believe it or not that day is now amen that day is now if you look it up go go look can see what those people climatologist and all of these people are saying about California it ain't if it's going to happen it's when that and that Andrea's fault ain't nothing compared to this one that's on the on the side of Washington state and Portland and all that it's worse they said it's a I I forgot what the percentage is how many times worse than what happened over there in Indonesia and they said the pressure on it now right now is so great they don't know when it's going to pop but they said thousands are going to it's so silly they said thousands are going to die but my point is they say they got earthquake proof buildings Mercy Jesus but you know what caused that judgment the church the church God was pleading to the church remember in the service repent repent pleading to the church the church rejected the Judgment fell and when the church reject God judgment falls on the earth amen come on somebody is this okay that's why it's important that we live right am it's important that we serve the god the Lord Jesus with all of our heart because when you do wrong it affects this assembly right amen amen yes sir a can as long as the church was right aan was blessed but when a can thought I'm going to go out here and take a little bit of these Babylonian garments come on somebody now ain't nobody in their right mind listen I know this to be factual if you if a woman had to go see the president she'll have a certain kind of garment she'll go look for she ain't going to go up to the president with some kind of mini something on or half naked or nothing like that she going to go respectful yet we find people going to church naked and don't even know it so disrespectful to God he's holy and this well this the grace of God it ain't what's in your heart come on somebody when I was a sinner when I dressed like a sinner I knew what I put on and I knew the reason why I had it on and I was a sinner come on somebody ain't nobody going to put on no muscle shirt if they ain't got no muscles they put those shirts on to show it to attract come on somebody it's the truth it's the truth and you're trying to tell me these Sinners don't know what they doing no they think lusting is okay it's just human it's just a natural thing that we do and they fail to see that that natural thing got Eve in trouble got Adam in trouble God say kill it yes sir put it in order come on somebody amen amen help us Lord amen so we find out amen we're living in the last day and God is moving I want to get to something but I won't do that until this evening amen but let me say it anyway listen I I I Joseph y'all know Joseph right he's Perfection right and Joseph had to go through all kinds of Trials but Joseph was a blessed child amen just like you and me amen come on somebody wherever I've gone wherever I worked it blessed that place right now when I go in the grocery store it might be empty by the time I get to the register it's full when I go to a restaurant it's empty by the time I sat down people are coming like that so many times I want to go over there and tell them listen the reason why they coming is because I'm here hallelujah so wherever you go it's [Music] blessed I've seen businesses f up brother because they got rid of me look what happened to Egypt when they forgot about Joseph as long as Joseph was there the whole of Egypt was blessed amen amen hallelujah come on somebody you can't blame pifer's wife for looking at Joseph the way she did you can't blame the denominations and all of them that look at us the way they do they can't understand what's holding us they don't know the anatomy they don't understand why we stand the way we stand Hallelujah but God says not so Joseph said I'm running from here amen hallelujah why because if I stay with you you'll strip me naked that I was fresh from the throne that was fresh he knew part of his wife was there to strip him naked come on somebody and that's what the denomination is there for to strip you naked I'm running I've got a covenant W Hallelujah I've got a covenant I know that HOV God hallelujah woo and why should I mess with another man's wife amen come on somebody that's the devil's wife I don't want her that's right hey somebody so everything wherever Joseph went he was blessed I'm I'm I'm ready to quit I'm going finish this up in a in this evening but he says listen what happened was Joseph was so blessed and I'm going tell you something y'all know and I know people don't want to hear the name William brandom but almost every one of those TD J you name him women and men are feeding off of his message I've heard them I've heard them quote him verbatim and won't even tell where they getting it from what was it and what is it he's the Joseph of our day he's the one that God sent in this hour to store up the food and they com and get out the grains to feed their people but they won't tell them where they getting it from and God said amen through the prophet he said listen he said you ministers out there that's preaching this message and won't tell the people where you getting it from he said God going to judge you so a God a ignorant Hallelujah God knows what he's doing brother but you know what what they doing all they doing is making the the elect seed more hungry Hallelujah there's got to be more of this Hallelujah they'll find it they'll find it eventually they'll find it because I'm going tell you something even in my organization once we came to this message they told us oh we know him we heard of him knew it all around all along and what was it they was holding the truth in unrighteousness holding the truth and unrighteousness they don't want to lose us because of the money all of them fellas I listen to them and and and the things they say even Benny hen y'all know Ben hen knows about it CU he done mention William brand did y'all know that oh yeah and all them ones that's on these big television programs they talk about William brandom all the time that William brandom Ain that ain't that it's the god behind the man Moses never delivered anyone amen it was God in Moses Hallelujah hello so you got to understand what God is doing but you see he can't change if God sent a John the Baptist to forerun his coming the first time he must send an Elijah to R for run the second amen has to or he's changed his plans he's changed his way of doing things so when when when Jesus came on the scene guess what he said I'm knocking at your door any man over to up to me he said I come in and I suck with him right Jesus said to those Pharisees and said I don't care how much religion you got he said except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sin meaning your religion don't mean nothing I'm the one that gives it if you if you reject me you reject life oh come on somebody that's what he did now for those who didn't obey Noah or listen to Noah what happened to him folks those who didn't want to listen to to Abraham uh uh Moses and this is this is where I'm at because you don't have an option we don't have an option you don't have a second Arc to get into sir we're talking about Rapture we're not talking about salvation we're talking about bride we're talking about Rapture Now understand the food that Abraham had or the message that Abraham had was different from what Sodom had Sodom had get out of here fire is getting ready to fall Abraham message was Su with me and I'm going to change you Hallelujah I'm going to change you and let me say it like this Abraham's message changed Sarah and Abraham and even after a Sarah died Abraham had more children that's right so he could have been a grandpa we was reading that this morning I'm closing on this because uh I I finish up this evening here was the king down there in Egypt gave him sheep oxen ass all these kind of animals gave him men servants ma servants for old grandma evident Sarah must have been some beautiful this man y'all know what I'm talking about this man didn't give him one or two donkeys he gave him a all the Bible said Abraham left Egypt rich that man so wanted Sarah he gave ABR this is your sister I'm going to give you all of this I'll make you rich if you just give me your sister she shouldn't couldn't have been a humpback old woman huh she was so beautiful it made Abraham fear said listen you got to tell that man you're my sister cuz he going to see your beauty and he going to want you now listen to the story because before the king saw Sarah his servant saw Sarah and went to the king and said oh you got to come see this y'all hear what I'm saying and then and here she comes amen and the King instantly woo what do you want now she couldn't have been a old grandma what was God he it in the scriptures he changed them back young amen because a old woman could have never survived to having a baby not then not now amen huh come on somebody listen not only did he change listen Hebrew said he gave her strength to receive seed that means god changed her in her reproduction system if he had only made her young she still would have been not able to have children but God changed the reproduction come on amen God changed your reproduction system amen he took that old Spirit out of you and put you a new spirit in there put that new spirit in there so you can get the Holy Ghost and a lot of people think got a new spirit and ain't got the Holy Ghost a new spirit mean that you can cope with yourself and the Holy Ghost now but you know what a Holy Ghost is is when you changed oh come on somebody now all I can say let me close on this there's many things I want to say but but let me say it like this for those of us we don't we may not understand but let me let me say it like this there's only two marks there's the mark of the beast and the mark of the Holy Ghost the Seal of God in your in your head is not a physical seal it's a spiritual seal which in turn after the spiritual seal the the natural mock will come but the spiritual seal is to know God is in you have a understanding he said said in that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father's in me and I am in you that is the Seal of God in you the mark of the beast must be the same to know that the devil is in you and all who do not reside and cry all whether you were old or young listen what happened because of the church going bad had young kids were killed babies old people everything was slain because the church failed amen so like the prophet of God said like this he said the Bride of Jesus Christ is the blood of Jesus Christ by the spirit amen and once the Holy Ghost is gone because the Holy Ghost is the life of the blood of Jesus Christ and once that Holy Ghost is left once is is gone may God have mercy on this world I don't care who are you are young people old people whoever you may be don't you take no chances at this Holy Ghost we're talking about if you can't cope with the word you got another spirit amen because the Holy Ghost is going to say amen that's right Jesus not Jesus Christ know the words he's preaching he know the words he spoke come on somebody if you are confused he's not amen amen hallelujah come on somebody he knows what he's spoken and you know when it comes to the word of God if you don't it the hearing of the word of God is what determines who you are right Jesus said my sheep Hearth my voice so let me say it like this to show you how it's going to be such a great number in this age let me tell you when Jesus came on on the scene you know who was really saved really out of all of those people in Israel Anna Simeon the thief on the cross huh huh just a few Anna Simeon Mary Joseph a few people knew God and still knew him in a way that angels visited them and the church world was in darkness come on somebody then you got three Mii who knew more about Israel's law and the coming of the Lord than those who in Jerusalem and like the song say wise men still seeking hallelujah amen they come all the way from where the East going toward the west Hallelujah they traveled with the sun Hallelujah come on somebody so what am I trying to say we getting ready to embrace something this coming year and the following year the Randy shared some things with me and by the grace of God I'll share them with you this evening some of the things I can't I could only share with you what I see and understand but let me tell you like this if you think America is going to continue to stand the way she's standing you are willfully ignorant now I hate to say it so brly but that is the truth how on Earth trillions of dollars in debt being propped up by a straw and put it this way how are you going to be saved you've got to be saved before you got to hear this word before because he said when you see the enemy encamp us about don't go back and get your stuff and that's what most Pro our problem is your stuff is in your way and let me say it like this in America the people's belly has become their God hallelujah come on somebody that was the last test job had on him God the devil said to Jo to God let me touch him skin for skin let me touch him let's see whether he let see you don't you oh I'm a Christian but let the devil touch your flesh let the devil come after you in this but let the devil come and get you hungry hallelujah amen it won't be that there won't be any people eating there'll be a many people eating around you smelling that good food hello somebody amen and perhaps God is testing you and you haven't eaten in three days oh come on somebody y'all you w have to worry about fasting he going to put you to the test anyhow what I'm trying to say amen and and some of us who are so comfortably bathing as often as you do and now you can't bathe and you can't stand the smell of your yourself it doesn't seem like much now but when the trial and you got demons on every hand now the hole of hell is open now the lid is off did y'all know that the lid is off of H that's why Hollywood have all these monstrous things now because the lid is no longer they coming and going ascending and out of hell right now amen into your homes into your minds into your spirit amen because you allowing it to be so yes somebody you better understand you dealing with something serious here but my point is what do you have in you now that's going to be able to withstand this storm because if you're not doing well with the footman what you going to do when the Chariots come H H you get angry at the least little thing frustrated at the least little thing let things come out of your mouth that shouldn't be coming out of your mouth oh come on somebody what you going to do huh those of you who packing guns what you going to do kill somebody the Bible said no murderer would be there huh what you going to do I I don't I feel like I'm pleading to somebody right now what you going to do when they come in and try you with your children and God done said if you fight with the sword you die by the sword huh you can say well we're in a different AG let me tell you something we're in the ox the lion the the man and the eagle H every four those four anointings are anointing us now plus with Joshua we're more than conquerors what you going to do when they come out to your family oh you going to fight Lambs don't fight Lambs lay their life down Lambs keep the promise say something Jesus prophesy to us you're his body right amen he said if he did it in the green what they going to do with the dry you his body no water no food no nothing you better be have you better have your Hiding Place Hallelujah cuz Satan got you so comfortable now amen just the least little thing y'all heard me say many times you get frustrated because you can't even buy a McDonald's burger sometime nonsense what we going to do people Satan got us fat for the slaughter and I mean I mean I don't mean just naturally I mean spiritually we don't have need for nothing but you better need God see that was that was LE to's eror when she said I have need for nothing that was her error because I'm going to tell you something I don't care how rich God would make me I will always need him Hallelujah I can't live without him I can't breathe without him I can't walk without him I can't talk without him I can't do nothing without him and I don't want to do anything without it hallelujah oh praise the name of Jesus Hallelujah let's stand in his [Music] time you make all things Beau in his time oh Lord show me every day as you keeping me your way that you do just what you say in [Music] your once again in your time think about people look what God has done look what God is doing here all than beautiful in his time help us Lord Jesus Lord please show me every day as you're teaching me that you do just what you say well brother Brooks everybody Jesus look like a be El they call him be they call him a devil every prophet of God always get a bad name somebody say well I I I I saw on the internet and they said this that and other and I said somebody the other day I said don't you know in the Jews the Jews some of the Jews still believe they stole Jesus body away some of the Jews still believe that Jesus was born of fornication cuz somebody said if you believe everything you hear on or see on the internet you are in trouble and my point is people of God there are so many people amen who going to miss this Rapture because somebody has said don't y'all follow that man and they don't F they don't they don't understand that's the way God has it we're not following a man we follow the god in the man amen Jesus said follow me Moses follow Mo H hello and that's the mystery of this age nobody knew that God was going to send us a gentile Prophet huh nobody knew that it was in the word all along and they weren't expecting it but if God dealt with us like he did Israel he would have to send us a prophet amen amen he'd have to in order to get us right is that right he would have to in order to get us right look at all the denominational churches and I mean even message whatever you want to call it everybody got their interpretation and when God has plainly said my word is not is not given unto any private interpretation so if it's not a private interpretation God God that means god interprets himself so God how is God ever interpreting his word read your word every time Israel got off the word God sent a prophet with the right interpretation amen thank you Lord he sent a man of God with the signs and wonders following that always got them on the right track and what Israel did America and the world has done they always hated the prophets they killed the prophet they sold po Isaiah and Twi and and two that's what they do that is the nature of the so-called children of God but God had a few people like Mary and the woman at the well and blind bot May and come on somebody they told him to shut up shut up not so not so not so this might be my last opportunity Hallelujah thou son of David have mercy on me so you got to understand people where Jesus is there is a lot of noise think about this though in closing we're not we don't have Fine Music we don't have these awesome singers but we got the word and when you can see a people get excited about a word is greater than anything else Hallelujah understand this and they didn't have all that music in them caves in dens they didn't have nothing but what they had was their their voices and many times they had they couldn't even sing in church church cuz they didn't want them the the people on the outside to hear them and sometime they sung low but oh the spirit of God would moov in them little dens and caves Hallelujah why because it was Jewels the people of God hallelujah the Bible said they had to wear sheep skin goat skin they were destitute hallelujah what but look
