[0:02] who's the one who takes care of
[0:06] you that's what I'm thinking about right
[0:08] now amen amen you know there's times you
[0:11] have things in your life you have to
[0:13] do and you're nervous about
[0:17] it you have negative feelings and
[0:20] thoughts but if God's called you amen
[0:23] who can stop you
[0:24] amen you certainly can't stop
[0:28] yourself amen let's let's hold on to
[0:31] that this morning as we turn our turn
[0:33] our Bibles to Psalms
[0:44] 127 just couldn't quite get away from
[0:46] this thought
[0:50] here as I studied and
[0:56] prepared so I trust to be a blessing
[0:59] amen
[1:00] Psalms
[1:07] 1271 accept the
[1:11] Lord build the
[1:14] house they labor in vain that build
[1:18] it accept the
[1:20] Lord keep the
[1:24] city The Watchman waketh but in
[1:28] vain
[1:30] let's bow our heads here together as we
[1:33] pray I ask everyone to be sincere here
[1:36] with me yes let's just bow our heads
[1:39] together and unite our faith
[1:41] here Lord
[1:44] Jesus how we need you father to build
[1:46] this house
[1:48] Lord father this great economy Lord that
[1:52] we're in Lord God we need you to build
[1:54] it
[1:56] father we need you father to come this
[1:58] morning Lord
[2:00] as we are feeling in ourselves
[2:02] inadequate Lord father you're certainly
[2:04] more than able to breach that Gap Lord
[2:08] father that Gap that exists between
[2:10] where we are now and where we need to be
[2:12] Lord so Lord Jesus I pray you'd help
[2:15] each and every one of us to get out of
[2:17] your way Lord father for you are the
[2:19] Builder Lord God you are the one that
[2:21] comes Lord Jesus and you lay that brick
[2:24] you lay that mortar all we have to do
[2:25] there is help you and assist you Lord
[2:28] God stand there and hand you father
[2:30] tools that you need father to work on
[2:31] our lives Lord hand things over to you
[2:34] not hold things back but give it all to
[2:36] you Lord help us Lord we pray we need
[2:39] you father help me to get out of the way
[2:40] Lord help us all father come Lord Jesus
[2:43] we pray just now we need you Lord Jesus
[2:46] Christ's name
[2:48] amen amen you may be seated
[2:51] there
[2:55] amen amen I'd like to speak this morning
[2:58] on the economy of God
[4:01] amen think about how that scripture we
[4:03] first read in Psalms 127 there think
[4:05] about that as we go through these things
[4:07] Hallelujah the second kind of definition
[4:09] is careful management of available
[4:12] resources am amen amen so basically you
[4:17] know kind of to sum it up that I just
[4:19] kind of put it like this the wealth and
[4:21] resources of a
[4:23] nation and that's a the definition is
[4:26] the wealth and resources of a nation and
[4:28] all the means by which which it is
[4:30] created maintained and
[4:32] improved so think about that it's
[4:35] important I want to stress this here I
[4:36] take a little bit of time to stress this
[4:38] it's important that we apply and and
[4:40] bring everything back to this definition
[4:41] as we go down through all these
[4:42] scriptures and all these thoughts amen
[4:44] because that's how I had to do it to
[4:46] make it perfectly it was perfectly clear
[4:47] when I did that amen an economy consists
[4:52] of an economic system and look at this
[4:54] with spiritual eyes yes sir comprising
[4:57] the production distribution or trade and
[4:59] consumption of limited goods and
[5:00] services between two agents the agents
[5:03] can be individuals businesses
[5:04] organizations or governments
[5:06] transactions occur when both parties
[5:08] agree to the value or price of the
[5:10] transacted good commonly expressed in
[5:12] the currency amen think about this the
[5:15] currency we're going to get into and the
[5:16] economy of God is Faith amen amen amen
[5:19] I'm getting ahead of myself but that
[5:21] truly is the currency that you use to
[5:24] buy and get what you need amen amen
[5:27] think about it without faith no man can
[5:29] please God right no transactions without
[5:32] faith
[5:34] Amen Brother Richard if you don't have
[5:36] money right now can you buy anything in
[5:39] this economy in this worldly economy you
[5:42] go to the store and you say I want this
[5:43] that the other and they ask you for
[5:45] money and you say I don't have it and
[5:46] they say I'm sorry you ain't getting it
[5:48] amen amen that's right yeah that's right
[5:52] a given economy is a result of a set of
[5:55] processes that involves its culture
[5:58] values educ ation technological
[6:01] Evolution history social organization
[6:03] and so forth
[6:06] amen these factors give it context
[6:09] content and set the conditions and
[6:11] parameters which the economy functions
[6:13] yes
[6:14] right amen
[6:19] amen praise the Lord let's go back to
[6:22] the beginning here shall we
[6:25] amen I like when the Pharisees came to
[6:27] Jesus and they were talking about a hard
[6:30] hard question you know they come to him
[6:32] and tried to trick him up right and they
[6:34] tried to say you know what about this
[6:36] marriage and divorce
[6:37] thing you know and that was a hard thing
[6:39] to deal with
[6:42] right but they come to him and and I
[6:45] like Jesus basically just said go back
[6:47] to the beginning you know it's all mixed
[6:49] up right now all these variables have
[6:51] entered in through the course of time to
[6:53] create all these complex issues and
[6:56] situations it's so hard to understand go
[6:58] back to the beginning where it was
[7:00] simple am God laid it all out in the
[7:02] beginning so that's what we ought to do
[7:03] right now right we can surely see this
[7:05] economy right there in the beginning the
[7:07] economy of God
[7:09] amen amen so let's go back there in
[7:12] Genesis we're going to kind of Jump
[7:13] Around in Genesis a little bit if you
[7:15] want to jump with
[7:21] me
[7:25] amen Genesis 2
[7:28] there
[7:42] 15 and the Lord God took the man and put
[7:45] him in the Garden of Eden to dress it
[7:47] and keep it and can you imagine this God
[7:51] put the man in the climax of his
[7:55] creation on the seven all these things
[7:57] were all done then the climax of God's
[7:58] creation come
[8:00] and he creates man and puts him there
[8:02] right and he says this is this is for
[8:04] you to keep this is my great the the
[8:07] wealth I mean can you imagine just go
[8:09] down through Genesis and see all the
[8:10] rivers and the waters and all the
[8:12] vegetation all the rich Lush everything
[8:14] that was there was for them right this
[8:17] was God's place this his economy they
[8:19] put him in amen
[8:21] amen and he was in control of everything
[8:24] wasn't he sir if he didn't like the
[8:26] weather he would just speak and it would
[8:29] change amen right if he didn't like
[8:31] where this mountain was or this tree was
[8:32] he would just speak and it would move
[8:34] right so he had complete
[8:36] control I believe that's God's desire
[8:38] for us isn't it we're supposed to have
[8:41] complete control of this economy amen
[8:43] that we are in amen that's right
[8:47] amen yes sir he named all the animals
[8:50] even so he was a master scientist knew
[8:53] all the names
[8:55] right
[8:57] amen then what happened
[9:04] was in Genesis 2 let's continue reading
[9:07] there in
[9:12] 16 and the Lord commanded the man saying
[9:15] of every tree of the garden thou May
[9:16] freely eat but the tree of the knowledge
[9:18] of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of
[9:19] it for in the day thou shal eatest
[9:21] thereof Thou shalt surely
[9:24] die so we see two economies here start
[9:26] to to come out in front take root here
[9:30] take
[9:31] picture God always has freeor agency and
[9:33] we got to remember that in this economy
[9:35] amen amen God has always allowed free
[9:37] agency to be there in his spiritual
[9:40] economy so you can choose what you want
[9:42] you can choose God his economy or you
[9:45] can choose Satan in his economy right
[9:48] you can same thing in the
[9:52] beginning praise the
[9:55] Lord amen excuse me here
[10:00] so we definitely see this in the
[10:01] beginning and I want to move past this a
[10:03] little bit here I don't know why but I
[10:04] need to move
[10:13] on
[10:16] Amen you know the importance of this
[10:18] economy is is just I can't overstress it
[10:21] because this is a little thing I found
[10:22] in a
[10:23] commentary that it says that Jesus
[10:25] talked much about
[10:27] money 16 of the 38 Parables were
[10:30] concerned with how to handle money and
[10:32] possessions in the gospel an amazing one
[10:35] out of 10 verses deal directly with the
[10:37] subject of money the Bible offers 500
[10:39] verses on prayer less than 500 verses on
[10:42] faith but more than 2,000 verses on
[10:44] money and
[10:46] possessions can you imagine that I mean
[10:48] this was stressed amen this was this was
[10:51] something we're to pay attention
[10:54] to
[10:57] amen turn to John 3 with me if we would
[11:03] please thank
[11:13] you John 3:3 Jesus answered and said
[11:16] unto him verily verily I say unto thee
[11:20] except a man be born
[11:23] again he cannot see the kingdom of
[11:28] God
[11:30] so this economy is something that we
[11:33] have to understand we have to be born
[11:35] again into it
[11:40] right it's like this if you don't if
[11:42] you're not born into this
[11:44] economy there's no way you can
[11:46] understand it there's no way you can
[11:47] participate in it that's right Amen in
[11:50] this worldly economy that involves our
[11:52] uh money of currency that we buy and
[11:54] things for exchange if you don't
[11:56] understand how that works how are you
[11:58] going to participate in it how are you
[12:01] going to effectively participate in
[12:03] it so Jesus stresses here you must be
[12:07] born again or you cannot even see this
[12:09] Kingdom this economy of God right amen
[12:12] that's why it ought to be our
[12:14] goal everyone in here young people
[12:17] included it ought to be your goal to
[12:20] receive that Holy Ghost that ought to be
[12:22] your whole life's goal amen and then
[12:25] when you receive the Holy Spirit now
[12:27] you're entered into the spiritual
[12:28] economy now you can
[12:33] participate people think that's an end
[12:35] but it's not an end it's just the
[12:37] beginning amen oh my that is such a
[12:40] fallacy it is not the end the holy
[12:43] spirit is not the end right when you get
[12:46] that Holy Spirit the battle start right
[12:48] there because you are now entering into
[12:50] that economy that's been waiting for you
[12:52] before the foundations of the world Amen
[12:55] you was in God's mind before the
[12:57] foundation of the world right you were
[12:58] always there amen he always wanted you
[13:01] there you're just now realizing it right
[13:03] now amen we come to this economy this
[13:06] spiritual economy is so rich God has
[13:09] prepared for us there are so many
[13:11] promises for you that you need to buy
[13:13] with your faith amen so let's quit
[13:17] complaining and murmuring and thinking
[13:19] we can't do it because you can't God
[13:21] through you can amen that's why the
[13:23] Bible says take his faith amen it's
[13:26] God's faith that you buy he gives that
[13:29] to you but you must ask seek and knock
[13:32] amen you must desire it and that's what
[13:34] we're getting into with this spiritual
[13:36] economy that's why the Bible I'm getting
[13:38] ahead of myself again but the treasures
[13:40] of this world that's the issue with it
[13:42] it's not about having money in this
[13:44] world that's not necessarily the problem
[13:47] it's when that's what you desire that's
[13:50] the problem so desire that Faith amen
[13:53] amen because wherever your heart is
[13:56] that's where your treasure will be amen
[13:59] amen praise the Lord help us Lord we
[14:02] need God's help don't we amen break this
[14:05] yoke Lord amen the devil tries to stop
[14:08] you with so many things and purposes in
[14:10] your life he doesn't want you to
[14:12] understand this economy right Satan
[14:14] knows that if you understand this
[14:16] economy you can amass riches Beyond Your
[14:19] Wildest
[14:20] imaginations my father is Rich will get
[14:23] to that he's Rich he has all things amen
[14:26] can you imagine a man that has infinite
[14:28] amount of of riches we cannot even
[14:30] imagine that it's uncomprehended but
[14:32] that's okay you don't have to understand
[14:34] it just believe it amen it's for you
[14:37] amen Satan doesn't want that he's trying
[14:40] to hinder us right now I feel it I don't
[14:41] know there's something that's that's
[14:42] striking at me before I came out there I
[14:44] don't know I just kind of something was
[14:46] really a spiritual battle I don't know
[14:47] what's going on if it's just me or if
[14:49] there's something else going on here but
[14:51] Satan is trying to hinder this right now
[14:53] he is he tried to stumble me up at the
[14:55] beginning I don't know what's going on
[14:57] Amen so we'll just blast him on out of
[14:59] here amen so raise your faith and pull
[15:01] amen praise the Lord amen I want to be I
[15:05] want to see all you to be spiritual
[15:06] millionaires when we leave this room
[15:09] amen you got needs you pull on it here
[15:11] this morning amen God has all the faith
[15:14] you can ever need yes sir don't worry he
[15:17] ain't going to run out amen it's like
[15:19] that example of the ocean you know there
[15:21] ain't you your little fishy swimming
[15:22] around there he ain't going to drink too
[15:24] much water he ain't going to make that
[15:26] ocean go dry you're not going to make
[15:28] that ocean go dry Keith take everything
[15:31] you need amen hallelujah praise the
[15:34] Lorden yes sir Satan's not going to have
[15:37] his way this morning amen yes he's not
[15:41] God have his way
[15:43] amen praise the Lord Romans 1120 if you
[15:45] would
[15:49] please for the invisible things of him
[15:52] from the creation of the world are
[15:53] clearly seen being understood by the
[15:55] things that are made even his eternal
[15:57] power and godhead so that they are
[15:59] without excuse so we see there's
[16:01] parallels here we see God in the
[16:04] creation right we see the spiritual
[16:07] through the natural right so that's why
[16:09] I'm getting at here there are so many
[16:11] things that we can look at our natural
[16:12] economy and we can look at and compare
[16:15] and see and understand the spiritual
[16:17] economy types and shadows God's law he
[16:20] he set all these things up like that so
[16:22] we can understand our finite Minds can
[16:24] understand by looking because look we're
[16:27] human beings we've got to have tangible
[16:29] things that we can see right that's how
[16:31] we're made it's hard for that's why it's
[16:33] so hard many times for us to enter the
[16:35] spiritual realm I'm talking about myself
[16:37] here because we can't see it Paul said
[16:39] the things that are unseen are Eternal
[16:41] and the things that are seen will perish
[16:44] amen so we can use these things that we
[16:45] can see as an example to help us you
[16:48] know in our our feeble finite mind it's
[16:50] okay we can do that and God said so
[16:51] right here because he's through all the
[16:53] creation the things that we can see the
[16:55] resurrection look at the flowers and all
[16:57] the things how they come up and then
[16:58] they have life and they wilter and get
[17:00] old and die and they come right back up
[17:01] the next season right so God has set
[17:04] these things he has Mercy on us he knows
[17:06] our infallibility he knows our
[17:08] incapabilities
[17:10] right he does Amen so he has mercy so
[17:13] I'm glad that God has set these things
[17:15] up here so that we can see this
[17:17] spiritual economy through the natural
[17:19] economy amen
[17:26] amen amen
[17:30] praise the Lord 1 Corinthians
[17:35] 2:10 but God hath revealed them unto
[17:39] us by his spirit for the spirit
[17:41] searcheth all things yay yay the Deep
[17:44] things of God verse 11 for what man
[17:47] knoweth the things of man save the
[17:48] spirit of man which is in him even so
[17:51] the things of God knoweth no man but the
[17:53] spirit of God Amen you want to have eyes
[17:56] to see this spiritual economy God will
[17:58] show it to you amen that's why God works
[18:00] in you through you to show you this
[18:02] economy Ephesians
[18:06] 1:17 that the god of our Lord Jesus
[18:09] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[18:11] you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation
[18:13] in him in the knowledge of him rather
[18:16] the eyes of your understanding being
[18:19] enlightened that you may know what is
[18:21] the hope of his calling amen and the
[18:24] riches of the glory of this inheritance
[18:28] in the Saints and what is the exceeding
[18:31] greatness of his power to us word who
[18:33] believe amen according to the working of
[18:35] his mighty power you see that amen he
[18:39] this is this is something amen yes
[18:42] sir let's go to Saul in company and
[18:46] let's look at them for a minute let's
[18:48] let's see for a minute how that Saul he
[18:50] had some trouble seeing he did he did am
[18:54] he didn't quite have the spiritual eyes
[18:56] that David had amen and I know that God
[18:59] and believe that God put these two
[19:01] characters together Amen to show this to
[19:05] illustrate this point because this is
[19:07] exactly what we need for this spiritual
[19:08] economy we don't want to be Sauls do we
[19:11] no sir we don't want to be like that
[19:14] amen let's read that here in 2 Samuel
[19:22] 26 we have David and I'll just kind of
[19:24] paraphrase for the sake of time here but
[19:26] it's 1st Samuel 268 12 is where we're
[19:29] kind of
[19:31] at so we have Saul pursuing after David
[19:35] for no reason because of his own
[19:37] jealousy and uh you know maybe his anger
[19:40] maybe his uh lust for power and
[19:43] popularity because he saw that uh they
[19:45] ascribed to David's 10 thousands and me
[19:47] only thousands you know type of thing
[19:49] you know how he had that working on its
[19:50] heart right so there was things going on
[19:54] in the economy of Satan that was that
[19:56] Saul was heavily intertwined with that
[19:58] he could not get away from because he
[20:00] couldn't see but we have David kind of
[20:02] running from him at times kind of trying
[20:04] to stay away from him and we have them
[20:07] come in this situation here to a cave
[20:09] right I believe it was a cave and Saul
[20:11] it says in here that the Lord caused a
[20:14] deep sleep to come upon Saul and his
[20:20] people and therefore David saw this and
[20:25] his men saw this and said go in there
[20:26] and kill them there look the Lord's
[20:28] delivered him under into your hands and
[20:29] David said I will not do this I will not
[20:32] do this at all I will not touch the
[20:34] Lord's
[20:35] anointed so you see even even God brings
[20:38] this out in this in the natural with
[20:40] this deep sleep that he could not know
[20:42] he had no idea what was going on around
[20:43] him his life was in danger in perils he
[20:46] could have been killed right in this
[20:49] economy that he's in and all these
[20:51] remember now this this spiritual economy
[20:53] of Satan now there's many ways to look
[20:54] at it Satan has rule over the natural
[20:57] economy in many ways and God's involved
[20:59] in the natural economy in many ways too
[21:01] and Satan is involved in the spiritual
[21:03] economy and so is God they you know
[21:04] Satan loves to follow God he loves to to
[21:07] take what God has done and pervert it he
[21:09] loves to be a follower he's not a leader
[21:11] he's not God is a leader God is a
[21:14] supreme leader Satan always follows that
[21:16] up so that's where Satan's always
[21:17] trailing behind trying to copy right
[21:19] he's trying to pervert everything so so
[21:21] that's why there's there's there's
[21:22] there's parallels here the spiritual
[21:24] economies the natural economies so Saul
[21:26] was caught up in this in the natural
[21:27] economy No Doubt right in the spiritual
[21:29] economy as well showing that in this
[21:32] illustration he was blind he couldn't
[21:33] even see what was going on around him we
[21:34] don't want to be like that amen amen
[21:37] God's economy brings life amen praise
[21:40] the Lord how about Nicodemus in John 3
[21:43] how he comes to to God he comes to Jesus
[21:46] there and he says in verse four
[21:47] Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be
[21:50] born again when he's old can he enter
[21:52] the second time into his mother's
[21:55] womb amen so Jesus starts talking to uh
[21:58] Nicodemus here about the economy he does
[22:01] Amen you must be born again amen amen
[22:05] yes sir you that's the door of the
[22:06] spiritual
[22:09] economy how can these things be he you
[22:12] know he talks about all these things
[22:13] Jesus brings out and starts to try to
[22:14] teach him the basics of the economy the
[22:16] door the entering in of the door of this
[22:18] spiritual this great vast spiritual
[22:20] economy and Nicodemus is like wow how
[22:23] can these things be right because you
[22:26] know Nicodemus was caught up in Satan's
[22:29] economy it was blinding his eyes he
[22:31] couldn't hardly believe this this this
[22:33] thing that Jesus was telling him
[22:38] my Deuteronomy
[22:41] 15 I like to use a lot of scripture so I
[22:44] hope that's okay I
[22:46] mean I just just want to that's what I
[22:49] fall back on the scriptures you
[22:51] know I know they're infallible I know
[22:53] that there's no way that they can be
[22:55] they can't fall or fail or you know and
[22:57] if I if I think there's an there it's
[22:58] just my own lack of understanding
[23:01] amen amen so we can trust the word of
[23:04] God Amen all right Deuteronomy 15 5
[23:07] through6 is where we're at looking at
[23:09] this how that the economy of the United
[23:12] States was built upon a great economy of
[23:15] God it was it was built upon the economy
[23:16] of God in the beginning now that's why
[23:18] we that's why the United States has the
[23:20] great has had uh we we're definitely
[23:22] falling but has had the greatest economy
[23:24] the world has ever seen nothing has ever
[23:27] come close to this and we take it for
[23:30] granted because we've lived in it we've
[23:32] grown up in it a lot of us you know uh
[23:34] no doubt for a couple hundred years now
[23:35] it's been a great economy and we just
[23:37] it's so common to us but if we could
[23:39] only step outside and really look back
[23:41] in you would wow this is something I
[23:44] mean this this just breaks the all
[23:45] records of
[23:47] History so Deuteronomy 15 5-6 only if
[23:51] thou carefully hearken unto the voice of
[23:54] the Lord thy God to
[23:57] observe to observe and to do all these
[24:00] Commandments which I command you this
[24:01] day now look he set the condition this
[24:03] is what made the the the economy of the
[24:06] United States so
[24:08] great because we did verse five in the
[24:10] beginning we did verse
[24:12] five verse six for the Lord thy God
[24:15] blessed thee as he promised and thou
[24:20] shalt lend unto many nations but Thou
[24:23] shalt not borrow and thou shalt Reign
[24:25] Over many nations but they shall not re
[24:28] over thee
[24:31] amen does everyone realize that the
[24:33] United States has
[24:34] had the what do they call it the the
[24:37] currency of the world the uh what's it
[24:39] called brother
[24:40] Keith sorry I forget it's it's a reserve
[24:43] the reserve currency of the world
[24:45] everyone buys and brings our buys our
[24:47] currency so they can have that as their
[24:48] Reserve right it's like an investment
[24:50] like the Chinese they own a third of our
[24:52] United States I believe something like
[24:53] that a large portion amen because they
[24:56] have a lot of our money right so look at
[24:58] that can you see that there the
[25:00] scripture says right there if you listen
[25:01] and hearken unto the Commandments of the
[25:03] Lord
[25:05] then you'll lend to many nations right
[25:08] they'll use your money amen you won't be
[25:11] borrowing from anybody you won't need to
[25:12] because you'll be so rich right your
[25:13] economy will be so great and you'll
[25:15] Reign Over many nations but they shall
[25:16] not Reign Over You I thought that was a
[25:19] powerful scripture that really
[25:20] Illustrated this this economy the
[25:22] natural economy and the spiritual
[25:23] economy as we'll get into the spiritual
[25:25] economy was first that's why the natural
[25:28] economy could be so righteous and
[25:30] great but we're falling away from that
[25:33] Saints Psalms 112 1-3 praise ye the Lord
[25:37] blessed is the man that fearth the Lord
[25:39] that delighteth greatly in his
[25:40] Commandments his seed shall be Mighty on
[25:42] the earth the generations of the upright
[25:45] shall be blessed wealth and riches shall
[25:47] be in his house and the righteous shall
[25:48] endure forever amen oh my Hallelujah I
[25:53] hope is everyone seeing this connection
[25:55] that we're talking about here my
[26:00] praise the
[26:02] Lord so we definitely see a correlation
[26:04] here a correlation is a mutual
[26:07] relationship or connection between two
[26:09] or more
[26:11] things that word connection is a
[26:14] relationship in which a person thing or
[26:17] idea is linked or associated with
[26:19] something
[26:20] else you see that St John 14 if you
[26:23] would turn
[26:25] there so these economies I mean the and
[26:28] that's what you know Satan takes
[26:30] advantage of that he takes advantage of
[26:31] the fact that these all these things can
[26:33] be so mixed because as we said when the
[26:35] Pharisees come to Jesus and they said
[26:37] they have this great question about
[26:38] putting away your wife and this marriage
[26:40] and divorce thing right and it was and
[26:42] isn't that so complicated today I mean
[26:44] all the variables that have happened
[26:45] with the marriage and divorce all the
[26:46] other things all the circumstances and
[26:48] just poor people putting conditions and
[26:50] things that happen this is such a
[26:52] complicated
[26:53] thing but that's what Satan wants see he
[26:56] wants things to be so complicated so
[26:58] it's so hard to understand what's what's
[27:00] right and wrong black is black and white
[27:03] is white still amen no matter how much
[27:05] time goes by no matter what Satan does
[27:08] or doesn't do no matter how complicated
[27:10] things get black is black and white is
[27:13] white we've got to get back to the black
[27:15] and the white amen we do yes this
[27:19] philosophy in this day and age how
[27:21] people say that there's some you know
[27:23] there's so much intermingling there so
[27:24] much gray area going on there is nobody
[27:27] wants black white anymore and that's
[27:29] what Satan wants us to desire oh it's
[27:31] okay we can all blend together you know
[27:33] let's let's mix and match and you know
[27:35] just drop your beliefs and come to you
[27:37] know whatever the economical movement's
[27:38] doing and you know your workplace and
[27:40] all we're trying to just diversify and
[27:42] and tolerate everything I I agree with
[27:45] diversity and tolerance I do but not the
[27:47] way Satan's trying to apply it he's
[27:49] trying to take your values away he's
[27:50] trying to take the principles you hold
[27:52] true way he's trying to make black and
[27:54] white gray yeah that's right yes
[27:56] everywhere amen but but there is a
[27:58] correlation here there there truly is
[28:00] between these all these
[28:02] economies St John 14:1 15-21 is where
[28:06] we're going
[28:09] here if you love me keep my Commandments
[28:11] black and white amen if you love me I
[28:14] mean that's pretty simple isn't it Jesus
[28:15] says if you love me keep my word amen
[28:19] amen read the black and white keep that
[28:21] black and white amen that's what last
[28:24] time I checked there's some red letters
[28:25] in there too but there's a lot of black
[28:27] and white right
[28:29] amen yes sir the red letters are just
[28:32] stressing they're just saying these are
[28:33] really really important you know look at
[28:35] this amen so if you love me keep my
[28:38] Commandments and I will pray the father
[28:40] and he shall give another comforter that
[28:42] you may abide with you forever prise the
[28:44] Lord even the spirit of Truth there it
[28:47] is the spirit of truth will come to you
[28:49] amen whom the world cannot receive
[28:52] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[28:54] him amen but ye know him for he dwelleth
[28:57] in you and shall be in you yes sir I
[29:00] will not leave you comfortless I will
[29:02] come unto you yet look at this this is
[29:05] what I'm talking about as we go on here
[29:07] this is a correlation this is the
[29:09] definition is correlation Let me refresh
[29:11] it a mutual relationship or connection
[29:13] between two or more things that's what
[29:14] we're talking about see this connection
[29:16] that Jesus is talking
[29:17] about amen a relationship in which
[29:20] person's things or ideas is
[29:22] linked look at this in verse 18 and I
[29:25] will not leave you comfortless I will
[29:26] come to you yet a little while and the
[29:28] world seeth me no more because ye see me
[29:31] because I live yet ye shall live also
[29:34] amen see the corations we're talking
[29:37] about here the spiritual economy you
[29:39] will live and we'll get into this
[29:40] Satan's economy is death he tries to
[29:43] disguise himself as light as Life we'll
[29:46] get to that Lord
[29:48] willing verse 20 this is it right this
[29:51] is one of the main highlights of this
[29:53] this portion at that day you shall know
[29:57] I am in the father ye in me and I in you
[30:00] thank you Lord can't get no more
[30:01] interconnected than that we can't even
[30:04] understand that all the
[30:06] wayu
[30:08] my that's right we receive it brother
[30:10] amen verse 21 he that hath my
[30:12] Commandments and keepeth them he is is
[30:14] he that loveth me and he that loveth me
[30:16] shall be loved to my father and I will
[30:18] love him and will manifest myself unto
[30:20] him yes sir amen thank you Lord 1
[30:24] Corinthians 4:8 now you are full now you
[30:26] are rich you have reigned as kings
[30:29] without us and I would to God you did
[30:32] Reign so this is a rich economy what do
[30:34] we really have here is the question what
[30:37] do we really have because that's a lot
[30:39] of the problem we don't fully always
[30:41] realize what we really have in this
[30:43] spiritual economy because so many times
[30:46] we go running after this natural economy
[30:49] amen block out your time one time just
[30:52] once take a take a week or whatever and
[30:54] block out your time and see where you
[30:55] put all your time at C make two c
[30:58] categories the the natural economy and
[31:00] the spiritual economy do that one time
[31:02] and see what all where where all your
[31:04] time falls right I I just you know as a
[31:07] friendly challenge do that just maybe if
[31:09] you haven't already it might open your
[31:11] eyes now I'm not trying to be legalistic
[31:13] here but what I'm trying to say is let's
[31:15] put this in perspective am
[31:17] amen if you truly know and believe what
[31:20] we have then you'll pay more attention
[31:23] to that amen concept that I just
[31:26] said you'll watch where your time goes
[31:29] amen amen there's a direct correlation
[31:32] between that amen
[31:35] amen praise the
[31:38] Lord balam was a good example he didn't
[31:43] fully understand what he had right there
[31:46] because there's many of us that'll never
[31:47] interact with God like he did but he
[31:50] threw it all away because he was more
[31:52] interested in this natural economy amen
[31:55] he he did amen
[31:58] so whatever you put first that shows
[32:01] which one you believe in more right
[32:04] amen all
[32:07] right as I said in the beginning
[32:09] Revelation 2212 you can you know through
[32:11] 14 if you want to turn
[32:13] there I am the Alpha and the Omega verse
[32:16] 13 the beginning and the end the first
[32:18] and the last as I said in the beginning
[32:21] this is true my father is Rich amen he's
[32:25] the richest man there's ever been amen
[32:28] can you imagine a man so rich that he
[32:30] can continually give to his children
[32:31] down through the thousands and thousands
[32:33] of years and not even put a dent in his
[32:34] bank
[32:36] account that's something a't it he just
[32:39] he's Rich he's just so rich I we can't
[32:41] even my amen Romans
[32:44] 11:33 oh the depth and Riches of both
[32:47] the wisdom and knowledge of God how
[32:49] unsearchable are his judgments and his
[32:51] ways are PF finding out right Psalms
[32:55] 104:24 oh Lord how manif are thy Works
[32:59] in wisdom thou Hast made them all the
[33:01] Earth is full of thy riches amen so the
[33:05] Earth is full of his riches that would
[33:06] mean that heaven is so over full with
[33:08] his riches that it spills over into
[33:10] Earth right because Earth is the foot
[33:12] stol right yeah so so it overflows right
[33:15] in there and it's it just aren't you
[33:17] glad aren't you happy that that we can
[33:19] cry out to God and he can overflow us
[33:22] with his riches amen it it's not all
[33:24] kept up there in reserve and we and we
[33:25] only get to see it when we go to heaven
[33:27] you know we up there and now we can
[33:29] finally wow see the riches of God no
[33:31] it's not that way his spiritual economy
[33:34] is right now on this
[33:36] Earth as much as Satan tries to Blind
[33:38] your eyes from that it's true you know
[33:41] Satan tries to make you look at this
[33:43] natural economy and it's so real like we
[33:45] said we're beings that we we have these
[33:47] five natural senses you know and and
[33:49] whatever comes these five natural senses
[33:51] many times we battle with and making
[33:53] that our absolute like oh I see it so
[33:55] you know it has to be true right no no
[33:58] that's true no no that's not it those
[34:01] all those senses are are secondary to
[34:03] your to your faith amen your spiritual
[34:05] sense amen praise the Lord than you Lord
[34:09] yes sir
[34:11] amen praise the
[34:14] Lord so let's look a little bit more
[34:16] about what this economy is this economy
[34:18] of God is this all right here amen amen
[34:21] all right okay Ephesians 3 we'll go to
[34:24] Ephesians
[34:26] 3:7
[34:30] as your Turner let me read you a quote
[34:32] here and hear ye
[34:35] him
[34:39] 1958 the wheels of God's power and
[34:42] kingdoms can't turn because we got old
[34:45] sluggy
[34:47] dirty axle grease that don't belong
[34:51] there hallu anybody ever feel that
[34:54] wayall get get some things maybe in your
[34:56] joints you know you can't move as well
[34:59] right some old old dirt and sludge it
[35:01] shouldn't be there the byproduct of
[35:03] Satan's economy that's right yeah feel
[35:07] sluggish
[35:08] amen what we need tonight is the washing
[35:11] by the water through the word amen amen
[35:14] the holy ghost power to come back into
[35:15] the church and start the wheels of God's
[35:17] economy turning amen amen that's what we
[35:20] need a little washing by the water of
[35:22] the word amen so remember that because
[35:24] Satan's trying to keep you away from
[35:25] that he doesn't want you to be washed by
[35:27] by the water of the word he doesn't want
[35:29] you to put much time into that he
[35:31] doesn't want you to have uh time
[35:33] allocated to the spiritual economy of
[35:34] God he doesn't and he'll fight you tooth
[35:37] and nail he'll fight you every bit
[35:39] everything that he's got he'll fight you
[35:40] oh I got to do this and I got to do that
[35:42] and I got to make a living for the
[35:43] family you got to do those things yes
[35:46] but they should not be a priority they
[35:48] should not be your number one they
[35:50] should not it shouldn't be like this I'm
[35:51] going to go do this in the in the world
[35:53] and that I got to do my job and I got to
[35:55] you know spend time here and do this
[35:56] that and the other and go buy this go
[35:57] this this and then at the end of the day
[35:58] I finally if I have some time I'll
[36:02] pray that's not how it should be sir no
[36:06] no
[36:07] sir so Ephesians 3:7 we'll turn
[36:12] there wherefore I was made a minister
[36:14] according to the gift of grace of God
[36:16] given unto me by the effectual working
[36:18] of his power in this economy we'll see a
[36:21] lot about the working of God's power yes
[36:24] amen
[36:25] amen yes sir unto me Who Am less than
[36:28] the least of all the saints is the grace
[36:30] given that I should preach among the
[36:31] Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of
[36:34] Christ amen and to make all men see what
[36:37] is the Fellowship of the mystery which
[36:39] was from the beginning of the world hath
[36:40] been hid who ha created All Things by
[36:42] Jesus Christ amen so Paul was to make
[36:45] these unsearchable riches known to
[36:47] everyone right
[36:49] amen Colossians 1:26 through 28
[36:53] says even the mystery which has been
[36:56] hidden from ages and from Generations
[36:58] but now is made manifest to the Saints
[37:00] Amen in this hour this is what this
[37:03] Revelation is is coming forth the the
[37:05] you know the the word was open to us
[37:07] right the seals were broken open so now
[37:09] we have this unveiling this Revelation
[37:11] this this this manifestation to the
[37:13] Saints to whom God would make known what
[37:16] is the riches of his glory of this
[37:18] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[37:19] Christ in you the hope of glory am amen
[37:22] this economy of God is Christ in you the
[37:25] hope of glory amen
[37:28] amen that's right it's very simple
[37:32] amen amen praise the
[37:35] Lord praise the
[37:37] Lord you know I think many times we get
[37:40] so complicated on things we try to make
[37:43] things what they're not and that's
[37:45] basically all it is receive the holy
[37:47] spirit amen amen then God will do the
[37:50] rest amen you just got to get to that
[37:52] Holy Ghost so many times we you know and
[37:55] even when we get it then that's when the
[37:56] battle comes and Satan tries to make you
[37:58] think that you got to do it more you got
[38:00] to keep going on you got to do the work
[38:02] you as we said in the beginning you got
[38:03] to bridge the gap right that's what
[38:05] Satan wants you to think yeah you are an
[38:07] instrument you just yield you're a
[38:09] vessel amen God does the work he builds
[38:12] the economy amen thank you and it's so
[38:15] many times the reason why he's not
[38:17] building we think oh God why are you not
[38:18] building why is this not happening why
[38:20] is this not progressing what's going on
[38:21] here it's because you're in the
[38:24] way do you think that he think about
[38:26] this for a minute what what if you were
[38:27] at a construction
[38:29] site and you were up up there up on the
[38:32] wall right there in there were building
[38:33] this wall and you're right up on there
[38:34] on it are they going to keep building
[38:36] with you right there standing in the
[38:38] way because they'll hurt you amen
[38:41] they'll damage you they you'll be killed
[38:43] I mean whatever more I mean imagine this
[38:45] V Mass construction site that's going on
[38:47] there ain't no construction site any
[38:49] bigger than what God's doing in your
[38:50] life there ain't no there's not one
[38:53] bigger than that right so therefore get
[38:56] out of the way yes sir let the master
[38:58] builder do what he's supposed to do let
[39:00] him do his job all you got to do is
[39:03] assist him or do whatever he ask you to
[39:05] do right am you just stand by and wait
[39:08] for him to give you instructions wait
[39:10] for him to ask you for something
[39:11] whatever he needs yield yourself amen
[39:14] that's right he'll ask whatever he needs
[39:16] just that's the position we got to take
[39:18] Lord whatever you need I'll do whatever
[39:20] you want Hallelujah if he asks you to do
[39:23] something that you think you don't know
[39:24] how to do he'll train you yes sir amen
[39:27] right he'll put that in you he'll put
[39:29] that knowledge and skill in you what did
[39:31] he do when they were building the
[39:32] Tabernacle all these workers came forth
[39:35] who it said that God put wisdom and
[39:38] skill into these men to build this
[39:40] Tabernacle to Fashion all these things
[39:42] what if these men would have said hey I
[39:44] don't know how to do that I you know I I
[39:46] can't I've never done that before or I'm
[39:48] just an amateur I can't build this
[39:50] Tabernacle for God right God used these
[39:53] men it wasn't the ability of these men
[39:56] was it it was
[40:37] [Applause]
[40:58] that's right whatever part you don't
[40:59] understand uh you know I I see this that
[41:01] and the other but I don't quite see how
[41:02] these two go together he'll come over
[41:04] and explain it to you right just ask him
[41:06] amen just get on your knees and ask him
[41:09] Lord so many times we get so discouraged
[41:11] and we think that we got to understand
[41:13] everything and we think that we got to
[41:14] know exactly what this blueprint
[41:17] says we do but he'll reveal it to you
[41:21] not in your own power right lean not to
[41:23] your own understanding right amen
[41:26] sometimes we think we understand
[41:27] understand it we get ahead of ourselves
[41:29] and we get a little ahead of him too
[41:30] right we start building and we get in
[41:32] the way and then he's like oh you know
[41:34] then he has to stop construction because
[41:36] he has to stop construction hold
[41:37] everybody up on the site blow the big
[41:39] siren stop we got somebody in the way
[41:42] yeah amen help us Lord can can anyone
[41:45] relate to this yes sir am I the only one
[41:49] no God help us to get out of the way out
[41:51] of our own thinking out of our own minds
[41:53] we want the mind of Christ that's right
[41:55] we do amen amen that is how you get it
[41:58] that's how you increase the riches in
[42:00] this great economy of God you can't do
[42:02] it yourself you're a you're kind a
[42:05] natural being right now right natural
[42:07] things we can do many natural things but
[42:09] let him do the spiritual things
[42:12] amen oh my Satan tries to trip us up in
[42:16] this he truly has a false economy Satan
[42:19] does if you want to turn to Second
[42:21] Corinthians we'll show this
[42:23] here 2 Corinthians
[42:26] 11
[42:32] let me let me read this to you as you
[42:33] turn in 2 Corinthians 1113 is where
[42:36] we're going to go uh it says here in in
[42:38] uh mark of the
[42:41] beast all right and I saw a woman
[42:44] sitting Upon A Scarlet colored Beast
[42:46] rich full of names of blasphemy false
[42:49] baptism false economy Leading the People
[42:52] blindly telling them they can just come
[42:54] to church make the confession and so
[42:56] forth and do a Hail Mary do repentance
[42:59] ignorance
[43:00] nonsense yes
[43:03] sir so Satan wants you know he he's
[43:07] truly got a false economy it's it's real
[43:08] it's tangible we can we can operate in
[43:10] it we can you know we can be led by it
[43:12] we can we can it can seem so great to us
[43:14] but it's false that's right just as
[43:16] brother Brandon was saying here that's
[43:18] what this that's what the the you know
[43:20] the organization the organizational
[43:22] Church does they're leading all these
[43:23] people to a false hope a false light
[43:26] they genuinely a lot of them probably
[43:28] think they're going the right way
[43:29] they're in the right economy they're you
[43:31] know they're taking the right steps
[43:32] they're building the right way they're
[43:33] they're all there building you know look
[43:35] at that and in the world there and the
[43:36] denominations as organization it's all
[43:38] about what you can do it's your works
[43:40] right it's it's about you know you doing
[43:42] this and doing that look at how there
[43:43] are some of those churches that have
[43:45] more of a Ministry active Ministry than
[43:47] we ever do they're out here in the world
[43:49] doing this that and the other and and
[43:50] feeding the poor and doing all these
[43:52] things you know the ministry of sports
[43:54] and you know I see Sports Ministries and
[43:55] all you know think about these things
[43:57] things they're doing so much they're
[43:59] they're trying to build the wall
[44:00] themselves the problem is they're not
[44:02] letting Christ do it amen they're not
[44:05] letting the foreman do it they're trying
[44:06] to they're trying to be the foreman
[44:08] they're trying to say they know how to
[44:09] do it they're trying to interpret the
[44:10] drawing the BL blueprints right that's
[44:13] what Satan wants that's what Satan's
[44:15] trying to lead you to do he's just as
[44:17] religious as he's more religious than
[44:19] everybody else right he comes right in
[44:20] there he wants you to follow this
[44:22] religious path he'll just he'll just
[44:24] skew it quite a bit if a flight leaves
[44:26] from Los Angeles a plane leaves from Los
[44:29] Angeles and goes to New York let me just
[44:32] throw some figures out if that plane
[44:34] skews and forgive me these may not be
[44:36] exact but if that plane skews one
[44:39] degree from Los Angeles to New York it's
[44:42] going to be off hundreds and hundreds of
[44:45] miles hundreds of what A Thousand Miles
[44:47] Whatever by one
[44:51] degree follow the straight narrow way
[44:54] stay on that path that middle Road
[45:00] amen 2 Corinthians
[45:02] 11:13 for such are false Apostles
[45:05] deceitful workers transforming
[45:08] themselves into the Apostles of Christ
[45:11] and no Marvel for Satan himself is
[45:13] transformed into an angel of
[45:15] Light
[45:18] wow amen that that Greek word there is
[45:21] light fire light and fire that's what
[45:23] that word kind of translates too so
[45:25] light we know is is a very abundant
[45:28] natural resource right very abundant but
[45:31] the thing about light that we take for
[45:34] granted it says here in the definition
[45:36] light is a natural agent that stimulates
[45:38] sight and makes things
[45:43] visible so Satan you see what he's doing
[45:45] here he's transforming himself into an
[45:47] angel of Light false light false
[45:51] economy right he's and in this
[45:54] definition look at this the natural
[45:55] agent that stimulates sight so he's
[45:57] trying to be this false stimulation of
[46:01] sight and making things visible but the
[46:04] things he's making visible is false
[46:07] amen amen
[46:11] amen think about light let's go back to
[46:13] this example light is so common right we
[46:15] are so used to the sunlight being here
[46:17] we are we're so used to lights we're so
[46:20] used to them we take them for granted
[46:21] but think about how valuable light is
[46:25] think about this no light on the Earth
[46:27] Earth Gone you'd wish you had it you you
[46:31] couldn't do nothing else that'd be it
[46:34] right so it's so valuable it's one of
[46:36] the most valuable things we have we take
[46:38] it for granted it's because it's such an
[46:40] abundance so don't take this economy of
[46:43] God for granted amen amen because it is
[46:46] so abundant because it is so vast don't
[46:49] let it become common
[46:52] amen
[46:54] amen
[46:56] 1957
[46:59] life is the title here and I read an
[47:01] article in the magazine one time that I
[47:04] was on when I was on an airplane and it
[47:06] was about Hollywood and it said Life
[47:08] begins after
[47:09] midnight see that lie of the devil
[47:11] talking about Hollywood and they're
[47:13] trying to portray these you know big
[47:14] flashing life really begins after
[47:16] midnight right that's what he's saying
[47:18] here you should come down on certain
[47:21] streets and things and they had a
[47:24] picture
[47:25] uh of burkel's que and I'm not sure what
[47:29] that word means and it said like this
[47:30] how perverted that is so he's looking at
[47:32] the lights and the and the Billboards
[47:33] and the pictures right this Magazine's
[47:35] trying to portray and and and show that
[47:37] life really begins after midnight look
[47:38] at all these lights look at all this
[47:39] activity look at all these sinful things
[47:41] going on all the pleasures of the world
[47:44] right you see if Satan has a kingdom
[47:47] he's got to have a false economy he's
[47:50] got to have something that he can
[47:52] present to them to make them think
[47:53] they're living but it's absolutely on
[47:55] the vice versa side it's death in the
[47:58] form of life amen see that
[48:02] amen yeah it's
[48:04] true 2 Corinthians 4 in whom the God of
[48:08] this world hath blinded the minds of
[48:10] them which believe not lest the light of
[48:12] the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[48:14] image of God should shine unto them my
[48:18] that's his purpose with this false
[48:20] economy he's trying to Blind your
[48:23] eyes amen now think about Satan's
[48:26] natural economy
[48:27] his spiritual economy think about it how
[48:29] you get how we can get so caught up in
[48:31] these things and think about what it
[48:33] does it blinds you to what you really
[48:34] need to do it blinds you to your place
[48:35] in this economy of God it blinds you to
[48:37] what really matters in life right
[48:43] amen think about what Satan's doing this
[48:45] movement and it's Universal again let's
[48:47] look at the let's look at the uh the
[48:49] natural
[48:50] movement this this and there's good and
[48:53] bad in here remember we're talking about
[48:54] the knowledge of the tree of knowledge
[48:55] of Good and Evil that's what we were
[48:57] talking about in the beginning you had
[48:58] these two economies the the Tree of Life
[49:00] the economy of life and you had the
[49:02] economy of Good and Evil right those two
[49:04] trees in the garden right there from the
[49:06] beginning they were God allowed it for
[49:08] free moral agency if there was only the
[49:10] tree of life or the economy of God that
[49:12] was it period there'd be no free moral
[49:14] AG nothing to choose from you have one
[49:15] choice but God as we'll see had to
[49:18] express his attributes in his great
[49:20] economy to make free moral agency to do
[49:23] that right no fre moral agency God's
[49:26] attributes could not be expressed there'
[49:27] be no need for them amen there'd be no
[49:30] need for a Healer there' be no need for
[49:32] a savior there'd be no need for this
[49:34] kind of things
[49:35] right
[49:37] so Satan's taken this
[49:39] economy this this remember now it
[49:41] started out when we had all these little
[49:43] economies all over the world and now
[49:44] it's starting to be all integrated into
[49:46] one the whole world is becoming one big
[49:48] great economy they're pressing for World
[49:51] Banks and World currencies and all kinds
[49:53] of world standards and the UN making up
[49:55] all kinds of standards to regulate the
[49:56] money and a business and all kinds of
[49:58] things right Satan is wanting that and
[50:00] pressing for it because he wants it all
[50:02] to be one right he wants to have control
[50:04] over it all he wants to have massive
[50:06] control so the same is happening
[50:07] spiritually what is happening with the
[50:09] churches of today that's right just
[50:12] forget about that little Doctrine or
[50:14] this there or that black and white and
[50:16] just all come together let's all be one
[50:19] right that's what's happening today he's
[50:21] trying to unite and merge the
[50:24] economies it's what Satan wants night
[50:26] for a common purpose is what combin
[50:30] means so let me ask you something here
[50:33] how can two walk together except they be
[50:35] agreed right right how can they do
[50:39] that if
[50:41] if in order to AG to agree you have to
[50:45] take
[50:45] out uh let me read this here they have
[50:48] to take out everything that they may
[50:50] disagree on that's how you walk together
[50:52] with somebody with agree with them
[50:53] because you got to take all this either
[50:55] either you step aside and you say this
[50:57] is wrong this is right and you can't
[50:58] agree then you just kind of set part
[51:00] your ways right because you can't have
[51:01] fellowship with Darkness light can't
[51:03] have fellowship with Darkness so in
[51:04] order to walk together with two and they
[51:07] disagree you have to put aside all the
[51:09] all the things you disagree on if you do
[51:11] that it creates a characterless
[51:13] principlist valueless belief worthless
[51:16] relationship think about
[51:20] that it's
[51:23] true
[51:25] amen second Timothy
[51:27] 3 says here in verse one this know also
[51:31] that in the last days perilous times
[51:32] shall come for men shall be lovers of
[51:34] their own selves Covetous boasters proud
[51:37] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[51:39] unthankful Unholy without natural
[51:41] affection truth Breakers false accusers
[51:44] incontinent Fierce despisers of those
[51:46] that are good traitors heady high-m
[51:48] minded you seen all this lovers of
[51:50] Pleasures more than lovers of God having
[51:52] a form of godliness but denying the
[51:54] power thereof from such turn away amen
[51:57] it says in the last days so this is the
[51:59] culmination of Satan's Purpose with the
[52:02] economies that he's working with here
[52:04] that's right amen we're working closer
[52:06] and closer to this every day every day
[52:09] amen but we have to come against it
[52:11] that's right in the name of the Lord
[52:13] just as David came out against uh
[52:15] Goliath in the name of the Lord right we
[52:17] must do the same to Satan's huge
[52:21] spiritual and natural economy amen how
[52:24] do you think David felt when he came out
[52:25] to a Goliath and all these thousands of
[52:27] men were cowering I mean there had have
[52:29] been some mind battles there yeah I mean
[52:31] his natural senses were picking up this
[52:34] situation
[52:37] right and no doubt in the spiritual
[52:39] realm fear was coming fear and these
[52:42] things were coming and and it just kind
[52:43] of you know it was really fighting this
[52:45] battle here right but he came against
[52:47] him in the name of the Lord so no matter
[52:49] what's in front of you this this this
[52:51] economy that Satan has that's right no
[52:54] matter what's in front of you you've got
[52:55] to come to it and in the name of the
[52:57] Lord by faith amen right because David
[52:59] by faith and he even took past
[53:01] experiences look the Lord was with me
[53:03] when I slew that lion right the Lord was
[53:06] with me when I slew that bear I knew it
[53:08] wasn't me it was him amen because I got
[53:11] out of the way and I let him build I
[53:13] know he's the Builder of this economy
[53:14] right he did that work right there with
[53:16] that lion right it wasn't me amen amen
[53:19] so he even came with some experience and
[53:21] he allowed that to build his faith amen
[53:23] hey whatever it takes to build your
[53:24] faith Let It Be build amen and then can
[53:26] come to this great economy this thing
[53:28] that Satan has in front of us this Giant
[53:30] Goliath and you can come to it in the
[53:32] name of the Lord and slay it cut its
[53:34] head off amen amen praise the Lord
[53:38] sometimes you know we Face Temptations
[53:39] and things in this in this great economy
[53:41] that Satan has on this Earth and we just
[53:43] got to cut its head off that's right we
[53:44] just got to once and for all cut its
[53:46] head off amen
[53:48] amen kill it right there amen sometimes
[53:51] these things can be painful for us to
[53:53] sever from our lives but we've got to do
[53:55] it amen amen amen just think about that
[54:00] amen I like to call Satan's economy one
[54:02] thing I like to say is it's called the
[54:04] elosan economy amen lady oan
[54:08] economy that's truly the false
[54:11] economy because as we'll look in
[54:13] Revelations 3 that's where we're going
[54:15] to go if you want to turn there
[54:16] Revelations
[54:20] 3:14 this lady oan
[54:25] economy verse
[54:27] 15 3:15 Revelation
[54:31] 3:15 because excuse me verse 15 I Know
[54:35] Thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[54:39] hot I would that thou were cold or
[54:44] hot Satan's economy is trying to make
[54:46] you lukewarm Saints that's right amen
[54:49] he's trying to bring this lukewarm State
[54:51] upon us you know where it's not black
[54:54] and white anymore it's in the gray
[54:56] right I I did the best I could type of
[54:59] thing right that's what he wants you to
[55:04] do so then because Thou Art lukewarm in
[55:07] verse 16 neither cold nor hot I will
[55:10] spew thee out of my mouth because thou
[55:12] sayth I am rich and increase with goods
[55:15] and have need of nothing and knowest not
[55:17] thou that thou are wretched and
[55:18] miserable and poor and blind and naked I
[55:21] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried and
[55:24] fire that they may be rich with white
[55:27] rainment and thou may be clothed that
[55:30] thy shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[55:32] and anoint thy eyes with th that thou
[55:34] mayest see amen amen so you see what's
[55:38] going on here these people are rich and
[55:40] increased with Goods the natural economy
[55:43] of Satan right the spiritual economy of
[55:46] Satan's working and they're
[55:49] blind it's producing vanity That's what
[55:52] Satan wants this this this economy this
[55:54] false economy in this definition here
[55:58] producing no results that's what vain
[56:00] means producing no results in other
[56:02] words it's useless yeah amen useless
[56:06] look at this having no meaning or
[56:08] likelihood or fulfillment how many
[56:10] people do you know and how much do we
[56:12] struggle with this where we don't even
[56:13] have any purpose in life we're just
[56:15] wandering aimlessly around feeling sorry
[56:17] for ourselves maybe or some kind of
[56:19] trial hurting us or putting us down and
[56:21] we don't really do a whole lot we don't
[56:23] really have an impact on uh the impact
[56:27] that we should on Satan's economy right
[56:29] we need to impact that thing and tear it
[56:31] down and we don't have that impact that
[56:32] God's calling us to have you know as
[56:35] bride members who's going to be called
[56:37] to a higher calling than you
[56:41] right when we see people that are not
[56:43] even bride and they're out here making a
[56:44] bigger dent in Satan's economy as far as
[56:46] a negative Dent hurting it that
[56:49] shouldn't be that should not be here we
[56:52] are you know toiling away in this
[56:54] natural economy just and i' I've been so
[56:56] guilty this so many times you just feel
[56:58] like oh I'm just barely getting by I'm
[56:59] trying to keep above water it shouldn't
[57:01] be that way amen if it's that way we got
[57:03] to check up something's wrong amen we're
[57:06] not here to just struggle and barely get
[57:08] by we're here to have the victory we're
[57:10] here to overcome amen we're here to be
[57:13] rich in this economy of God am amen not
[57:16] to produce no results and be useless and
[57:19] not to have no meaning or likelihood or
[57:21] fulfillment amen but that's what Satan's
[57:23] false economy produces so that might be
[57:26] something we can check up with right
[57:27] there if we feel this way like we're
[57:29] producing no results and useless and
[57:31] having no meaning no likelihood no you
[57:32] know nothing we returning value check up
[57:34] and see where you're spent putting your
[57:35] time in your resources in right what
[57:37] economy you're working in amen right
[57:40] check up
[57:42] amen praise the Lord you can always tell
[57:45] what economy you're in by what fruit
[57:47] you're bearing right
[57:48] amenallah yeah amen whatever you're
[57:51] producing in that economy you know your
[57:53] workers in this economy you're producing
[57:54] things you know you can look at your
[57:55] prodct and see what it is and you can
[57:57] tell which economy you're working in
[57:59] amen so that's a little test for us all
[58:03] right praise the
[58:06] Lord blessed are they that hunger and
[58:08] thirst for righteousness for they shall
[58:10] be filled right so the point we're
[58:13] talking about here is you've got to
[58:14] hunger and thirst for the right economy
[58:16] amen I'm not saying to totally detach
[58:18] yourself we live in this world we're of
[58:20] you know we're in this world we have to
[58:21] we have to we have to make a living we
[58:23] have to do things in this world right
[58:25] but it's what you thirst after because
[58:27] it's a rule in the Bible right whatever
[58:29] you sow that's what you'll reap right so
[58:32] whatever you're thirsting for that's
[58:34] what you're going to get amen so the
[58:36] whole point is you got to thirst and
[58:38] hunger for the right things here the
[58:40] right economy you got to thirst for
[58:43] amen Luke 153 he that ha he hath filled
[58:47] the Hungry with good things and the rich
[58:50] he has sent away empty oh
[58:53] my that's Luke 1 153
[58:57] Luke 621 if you want to turn
[59:00] there kind of what I just said there
[59:02] blessed are ye that hunger now verse
[59:05] 21 for ye shall be filled blessed are ye
[59:09] that weep now for you shall laugh
[59:11] blessed are ye that when men hate you
[59:13] and when they shall separate you from
[59:15] their company and shall reproach you and

[59:24] sake Rejoice ye in the
[59:26] and leap for Joy for behold your reward

[59:33] prophets woe unto them that are rich for
[59:36] ye have received your consolation woe
[59:38] unto you that are full for you shall
[59:40] hunger woe unto you that laugh now for
[59:44] ye shall mourn and weep woe unto you
[59:46] when all men shall speak well of you for
[59:49] so did their fathers to the false
[59:51] prophets amen oh my so you see what's
[59:55] going on here
[59:56] it's where it's what you're Desiring if
[1:00:00] right now all you're Desiring is these
[1:00:01] is these pleasures and these Riches of
[1:00:03] the world then later you're going to be
[1:00:05] empty amen amen because now we're put on
[1:00:08] this Earth right now to build our
[1:00:10] character amen right now we're put here
[1:00:12] to build that house to build that
[1:00:15] economy right to Build That Wall yes sir
[1:00:18] this is the only opportunity you're
[1:00:19] going to get amen right now in your life
[1:00:21] right now take advantage of it amen amen
[1:00:25] make sure you hunger thirst for that
[1:00:28] righteousness praise the Lord you know
[1:00:31] riches we talk about money this economy
[1:00:33] and a lot of times our minds fixated on
[1:00:35] on physical money but riches are not
[1:00:39] only you know when the Bible goes
[1:00:40] through it here like we can turn to
[1:00:41] Proverbs 28:22 he that hasten to be rich
[1:00:45] hath an evil eye and consider not that
[1:00:48] poverty shall come upon him so a greedy
[1:00:50] man in other words in this other
[1:00:52] translation says a greedy man is in a
[1:00:53] hurry for wealth he doesn't know that
[1:00:55] poverty will come upon him right you
[1:00:57] know riches here all through these
[1:00:59] scriptures in the Bible there's so many
[1:01:00] scriptures on riches is not always you
[1:01:02] it's not always just talking about
[1:01:06] money what so what else do we hold as
[1:01:09] value because riches are something of
[1:01:10] high value do we hold anything in our
[1:01:13] lives in this economy that shouldn't be
[1:01:15] there that we reg we take in such high
[1:01:17] regard that keeps us from the economy of
[1:01:20] God in a certain
[1:01:22] way right I mean I don't you know you
[1:01:25] you can think about that am we all have
[1:01:26] those battles
[1:01:29] amen
[1:01:32] amen praise the
[1:01:34] Lord Matthew 6:24 just uh something to
[1:01:37] jot down no man can serve two masters
[1:01:39] for he'll hate the one or love the other
[1:01:41] or he will be devoted to the one and
[1:01:43] despise the other you cannot serve God
[1:01:45] and money that's right that's what mam
[1:01:47] is money
[1:01:50] am think about you know the Disciples of
[1:01:52] Jesus Christ going back to that day
[1:01:57] and they all gather around him and he
[1:01:58] says you know I got to send you out into
[1:02:02] this wicked world to preach the
[1:02:05] gospel and I know that there
[1:02:08] are the economy of Satan is so vast and
[1:02:11] great and and and all these things are
[1:02:13] going on in this economy and it's going
[1:02:15] to come against
[1:02:16] you but Jesus in Matthew Mark rather
[1:02:20] Mark 68 says and he commanded them that
[1:02:23] they should take nothing for their
[1:02:24] Journey save a staff only no script no
[1:02:27] bread no money in their
[1:02:29] purse right so he basically sends them
[1:02:33] out what in their mind might look like
[1:02:36] sheep Among Wolves right sends them out
[1:02:39] but God knew what he was doing here
[1:02:42] because going out in this vast this
[1:02:44] they're going out to face Goliath right
[1:02:46] in this vast economy of Satan to preach
[1:02:49] the economy of God to tell people about
[1:02:51] these great riches that that people have
[1:02:54] lost and he told them not even take any
[1:02:56] money because in Luke 2235 if you want
[1:03:00] to turn there it says and he said unto
[1:03:02] them when I sent you without a purse and
[1:03:05] a script and
[1:03:06] shoes lacked you anything and they said
[1:03:11] nothing we didn't lack a thing amen we
[1:03:15] lacked all these material things and we
[1:03:16] didn't have any money but but you
[1:03:18] provided all of our
[1:03:20] needs so think about that that's one of
[1:03:22] the main things about these treasures
[1:03:24] and these riches
[1:03:26] it's so hard for a rich man to enter
[1:03:28] into the Kingdom of Heaven because of
[1:03:30] all these things are a burden these
[1:03:32] natural riches and cares are such a
[1:03:34] burden there's so many temptations that
[1:03:36] come along with them and it's so
[1:03:38] difficult so God knew that he didn't
[1:03:40] want them to be HED from this purpose of
[1:03:42] preaching the the economy of God to all
[1:03:44] to all the all around them so he sent
[1:03:46] them out with nothing so they couldn't
[1:03:47] be hindered by
[1:03:49] anything a't that something
[1:03:51] amen so when God puts a task in front of
[1:03:54] you and you don't think you're in you
[1:03:56] you you don't think you're adequate
[1:03:58] enough you don't think you have what it
[1:03:59] takes you don't think that you you know
[1:04:00] you don't have the right tools or
[1:04:01] knowledge or whatever God will give that
[1:04:03] to you God's doing that for a reason so
[1:04:06] you'll trust him because right here you
[1:04:08] can hold many things up as valuable
[1:04:10] things to in your life as riches aside
[1:04:13] from money and he doesn't want that to
[1:04:15] hinder you so if you're battling with
[1:04:17] something maybe that's what's happening
[1:04:18] God's trying to strip that from you so
[1:04:20] you'll trust him
[1:04:23] amen praise the Lord
[1:04:26] his ways are above our ways that's right
[1:04:29] we we can't always understand it but we
[1:04:30] know his heart right we don't always
[1:04:32] understand his mind or his head but we
[1:04:33] know his heart amen praise the Lord his
[1:04:35] word speaks his heart to
[1:04:37] us amen praise the Lord
[1:04:42] hallu
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:47] Solomon you know the story was great
[1:04:50] about Solomon I really enjoyed when he
[1:04:52] come and he was beginning in his kingdom
[1:04:54] there this great economy that God had
[1:04:56] established for him the greatest time
[1:04:58] they've seen you know Israel has seen
[1:05:00] and and Solomon God comes to Solomon
[1:05:03] says ask whatever you want and I'll give
[1:05:05] it right what do you
[1:05:07] want and you notice how that Solomon
[1:05:10] didn't ask for riches or wealth or fame
[1:05:12] or power things like that he asked for a
[1:05:16] gift of
[1:05:18] wisdom wisdom to know how to operate in
[1:05:21] this great economy that God has set up
[1:05:23] for him amen right didn't God set that
[1:05:25] up I mean Solomon didn't set that up did
[1:05:27] he no he didn't set that the great
[1:05:30] glorious state that Israel was in at
[1:05:31] that time all those natural riches and
[1:05:33] things and the spiritual riches were
[1:05:35] flowing abundantly right Solomon didn't
[1:05:38] set that up no man set that up it was
[1:05:40] God Amen so Solomon said he recognized
[1:05:44] this God what do I do now put yourself
[1:05:46] in Solomon's shoes this is for you to
[1:05:48] learn from Solomon God what said what
[1:05:50] can I do God what do I need yes that's
[1:05:53] what I need wisdom to run this great
[1:05:56] economy to work in this great economy
[1:05:58] for your people it was a gift amen right
[1:06:01] so let's ask the same things in this
[1:06:03] great economy of God that he set up for
[1:06:04] us and he will work marvelously look at
[1:06:07] look at all the things that happened in
[1:06:08] Solomon's life there was nothing nobody
[1:06:10] ever seen anything like it the Queen of
[1:06:12] Sheba came and said the half was not
[1:06:14] even
[1:06:15] told my I find that hard to believe do
[1:06:17] you know that when gossip travels and
[1:06:19] word you know and information travels it
[1:06:21] gets greater and greater as it
[1:06:23] goes so even what she heard was probably
[1:06:26] greater than what was originally being
[1:06:28] told and still it wasn't even the half
[1:06:30] of it amen right so imagine that I mean
[1:06:36] we it's just so unfathomable the riches
[1:06:38] and he was this was a type showing the
[1:06:39] economy that God wants to establish
[1:06:41] spiritually in your lives ask for the
[1:06:44] right thing so you can help god build
[1:06:46] that economy because Solomon didn't say
[1:06:48] hey give me riches and wealth and fame
[1:06:50] and power so that I can continue to
[1:06:51] build this Kingdom he said give me
[1:06:53] wisdom so that I can work with you God
[1:06:55] because you are the author of wisdom
[1:06:57] right amen
[1:07:00] yes so that was a wonderful story
[1:07:03] amen so we ought to follow that
[1:07:08] example if you want to turn with
[1:07:11] me to Jeremiah 9 please
[1:07:15] 23 as you turn keep this in mind he that
[1:07:18] serves God for money will serve the
[1:07:20] devil for better
[1:07:23] wages so if you're all about serving God
[1:07:26] for
[1:07:26] money the devil can pay you
[1:07:30] better physical money now
[1:07:37] right let's go to Joseph too just hold
[1:07:40] your place there in the scripture Joseph
[1:07:42] said Joseph of
[1:07:44] arthea came in Matthew 27 and he had a
[1:07:49] choice because we have a choice here
[1:07:51] that's what we're getting at we have a
[1:07:52] choice you got to choose between these
[1:07:54] economies and Joseph came and saw Jesus
[1:07:57] Christ carrying this cross this heavy
[1:08:00] burden right carrying this heavy
[1:08:04] burden and he had a choice do I help him
[1:08:07] or not do I work with him or not right
[1:08:12] so he had he had an economy to choose
[1:08:14] here because this man was rich the Bible
[1:08:17] says he had many riches and he knew that
[1:08:21] if he got in there with that with that
[1:08:23] uh how do I want to say in a respectful
[1:08:26] manner that Cast Away right this crazy
[1:08:31] man this
[1:08:34] lunatic isn't that who they thought
[1:08:36] Jesus was this radical lunatic this
[1:08:39] radical young man comes along and tries
[1:08:41] to tell me a ruler how to be spiritual
[1:08:46] tries to tell me about the word of God
[1:08:49] who is this man he he come from a
[1:08:52] carpenter look at his background he
[1:08:54] doesn't he has no money he has no status
[1:08:58] he has no power he has no education that
[1:09:01] man's a lunatic he's out of his
[1:09:05] mind so imagine what Joseph was battling
[1:09:08] here he knew in his heart that was right
[1:09:10] he knew that he needed to get there and
[1:09:12] help him carry that cross they compelled
[1:09:15] him but he still had to make the
[1:09:16] decision sir God's compelling you but
[1:09:20] you still got to make the decision amen
[1:09:21] you still got to free more agency right
[1:09:25] amen amen hallelujah there's people at
[1:09:28] work you know and I I have
[1:09:31] responsibility over people uh to do
[1:09:33] functions at work and and I know right
[1:09:35] now that I can't my my style is I don't
[1:09:37] want to force people I never want to
[1:09:38] force people I mean as an absolute Last
[1:09:41] Resort if I have to if somebody really
[1:09:42] won't comply you know and even at that
[1:09:44] there's disciplinary action other things
[1:09:46] you can do but the point is you lead by
[1:09:48] love you leadership means that people
[1:09:50] follow you because they want to right
[1:09:53] because they want to that's when you get
[1:09:54] your your heart the heart the heart will
[1:09:56] come you know I don't just want it like
[1:09:59] let's say in a workplace I don't just
[1:10:01] want people's hands I could force their
[1:10:03] hands you have to do that or or I'll
[1:10:06] fire you right I not only want their
[1:10:09] hands I want their mind their head I
[1:10:12] want their heart right because there's
[1:10:14] so much more to people than just their
[1:10:16] hands well God knows that that's why he
[1:10:19] giving you free more agency because he
[1:10:20] wants all of you if he forced you all
[1:10:22] he's all he's going to get is out of
[1:10:24] legalism your hands right do works right
[1:10:27] so Joseph had a decision here he come in
[1:10:29] knowing what was right knowing the
[1:10:31] persecution knowing the ridicule knowing
[1:10:34] this great economy of Satan that was
[1:10:36] there and even the natural economy he
[1:10:38] was rich the Bible said he chose to
[1:10:40] carry that
[1:10:42] cross he chose
[1:10:51] it amen I think it was Joseph right
[1:10:56] I have the I I have the wrong scripture
[1:10:58] here but the man that came to carry the
[1:10:59] cross with Jesus Matthew 27 says the
[1:11:02] rich man of arthea named Joseph came and
[1:11:05] begged the body of Jesus I'm sorry I had
[1:11:07] the wrong example what was what was the
[1:11:09] man's name that carried the cross
[1:11:11] brother what with him that helped him
[1:11:12] they compelled Simon I'm sorry about
[1:11:14] that forgive me but still that applies
[1:11:17] too right I had I had the wrong
[1:11:19] scripture here forgive me but let's go
[1:11:21] to this scripture in Matthew 27 because
[1:11:23] this applies the same way Matthew 27:57
[1:11:27] and when evening was come a rich man
[1:11:29] from arthea named Joseph who himself was
[1:11:32] jesus' disciple he went to pilate and
[1:11:35] begged the body of Jesus then pilate
[1:11:37] commanded the body to be delivered and
[1:11:39] when Joseph had taken the body he
[1:11:40] wrapped it in a in a clean linen cloth
[1:11:43] and laid it in his own new tomb which in
[1:11:45] hun out of the Rock and rolled a great
[1:11:47] Stone to the door of the seure and
[1:11:50] departed so you see this is the same
[1:11:52] principle I'm talking about forgive me
[1:11:53] about that I'm really sorry about that
[1:11:55] so he he had a choice too he came and
[1:11:57] said hey if I choose to do this I'm
[1:11:59] going to have scorn and people are going
[1:12:00] to laugh on me because everybody thinks
[1:12:02] he's a lunatic I'll be on his side if I
[1:12:04] help him right so he came and made that
[1:12:08] choice so we have we have a choice
[1:12:11] Saints Jeremiah 9 let's go to that which
[1:12:14] we originally called out Jeremiah 9:23
[1:12:16] thus sayeth the Lord let not the wise
[1:12:18] man glory in his wisdom neither let the
[1:12:20] Mighty Man glory in his might let not
[1:12:23] the rich man glory in his richest but
[1:12:24] let him that that glorieth glory in this
[1:12:28] he that understand and knoweth me that I
[1:12:31] am the Lord God the Lord Brother which
[1:12:33] exercise loving kindness judgment and
[1:12:36] righteousness in the Earth for these
[1:12:38] things I Delight sayith the Lord you see
[1:12:40] the choice here let not the rich man
[1:12:42] pick this let not man pick this economy
[1:12:44] of Satan or this natural economy pick
[1:12:47] the spiritual economy amen Joshua said
[1:12:50] in 20 verse chapter 24 choose ye this
[1:12:52] day whom you will serve as for me and my
[1:12:55] house we're going to serve the Lord amen
[1:12:57] so we've got to make that decision right
[1:12:58] now amen who are you going to serve amen
[1:13:02] praise the
[1:13:04] Lord yes sir let me just find a place to
[1:13:07] close here we do a couple more is this
[1:13:10] all right amen amen I know this is
[1:13:13] simple I know that you know but this is
[1:13:16] where we're at right amen I think so
[1:13:18] many times this economy this this
[1:13:21] economy of God we just we're not walking
[1:13:24] in it like we should that's right right
[1:13:25] amen there's so much here for you that
[1:13:28] you can
[1:13:29] have me that I can have amen I would
[1:13:32] just thinking the other day and talking
[1:13:34] to brother Brooks about it you know I
[1:13:36] just one of the things I'm dealing with
[1:13:37] is I I want to become who God wants me
[1:13:40] to become I want to be built into this
[1:13:42] stature of a perfect man there's things
[1:13:44] in my life that I see that I got to
[1:13:46] build into I got to be built into I got
[1:13:48] to let him do the work yes sir and it's
[1:13:49] just such a fire shut up in my bones
[1:13:52] right you ever feel that way or you just
[1:13:54] ready to burst because you just you just
[1:13:56] you want to get there so bad you want to
[1:13:58] get to that point over here and you
[1:14:00] think you're not making enough progress
[1:14:02] right you think you're not moving fast
[1:14:04] enough but he'll do the work right all
[1:14:07] these principles we talked about follow
[1:14:09] these principles this is the economy of
[1:14:11] God this is how we build it and grow in
[1:14:13] it amen
[1:14:14] amen praise the
[1:14:16] Lord amen so we have to choose
[1:14:20] amen praise the Lord Satan is a god of
[1:14:23] mixing as we said and look at this
[1:14:26] definition of mix blend mix up mingle
[1:14:28] combine put together jumble fuse unite
[1:14:31] unify join
[1:14:34] marry and this what Satan's trying to do
[1:14:37] with his kingdom with his economy with
[1:14:39] you but the Lord God is a god of
[1:14:41] Separation yes sir segregation as a
[1:14:44] matter of fact look at this the
[1:14:45] segregation is the action or state of
[1:14:47] setting someone or something apart from
[1:14:51] other
[1:14:52] people or things being set apart
[1:14:57] amen
[1:14:58] yeah how many times do we say if only I
[1:15:01] had enough
[1:15:02] money I could do this or I could do that
[1:15:06] right God help us God help us you have
[1:15:10] everything you need it's already within
[1:15:12] you it's just got to be
[1:15:15] cultivated God help us we don't need the
[1:15:17] riches of Mammon to do God's
[1:15:19] work he'll provide amen yes help us
[1:15:26] amen acts
[1:15:28] 8 couple more here as we
[1:15:33] close oh
[1:15:41] my Simon acts 8:1 14-22 Simon the
[1:15:45] Sorcerer he comes among this this Holy
[1:15:48] Ghost filled group of people and he sees
[1:15:51] the things that are going on right and
[1:15:54] Simon the Sorcerer is very very used to
[1:15:55] Satan's economy he's used to working in
[1:15:58] that economy right his motives and
[1:16:00] objectives show forth the truth that's
[1:16:03] he likes to work in that false economy
[1:16:05] so he comes along and he sees these
[1:16:08] things happening in Acts 14 through 22
[1:16:10] and he says
[1:16:12] Hey I want to buy that from
[1:16:16] you how much can I give you to buy that
[1:16:18] Holy Ghost so that whoever I pray for
[1:16:20] can receive it
[1:16:22] too if only I had enough money I could
[1:16:25] do this for God and that for
[1:16:28] God this scriptures are serious here
[1:16:32] right Peter looks at him and said thy
[1:16:33] money perish with thee because thou has
[1:16:35] thought the gift of God may be purchased
[1:16:36] with
[1:16:37] money you're never going to get somebody
[1:16:39] the Holy Ghost through money sir no sir
[1:16:44] if God has a purpose in your life and he
[1:16:46] wants you to work in the kingdom of God
[1:16:48] right and he brother Isaiah probably you
[1:16:50] know definitely knows this you got
[1:16:52] travel here and travel there and do this
[1:16:53] and do that where's all this money come
[1:16:56] from where's all this funding come from
[1:16:57] where's all this resources come from God
[1:16:59] provides right so don't stand there and
[1:17:02] look at your purpose and think boy I
[1:17:03] know that God wants me to do this but I
[1:17:04] don't know how to get there and I don't
[1:17:05] have money if only I had enough money
[1:17:07] and things like that you're not going to
[1:17:09] buy that God will provide amen praise
[1:17:11] the Lord yes
[1:17:15] sir Amen Let Us stand here
[1:17:19] together stretch a little bit there and
[1:17:21] we'll we'll close in this next portion
[1:17:31] praise the
[1:17:32] Lord I'm so thankful for
[1:17:35] this what God's taught me through
[1:17:42] this we can just get out of the way
[1:17:47] right Matthew
[1:17:50] 19
[1:17:51] 23 then Jesus said unto his disciples
[1:17:57] verily I say unto
[1:17:58] you the rich man shall hardly enter into
[1:18:01] the kingdom of heaven and again I say
[1:18:04] unto you it is easier for a camel to go
[1:18:05] through the eye of an needle than for a
[1:18:08] rich man to enter into the kingdom of
[1:18:09] God but his disciples heard it and they
[1:18:12] were exceedingly amazed saying who can
[1:18:14] be saved but Jesus beheld them and said
[1:18:18] unto them with men it is
[1:18:21] impossible but With God all all things
[1:18:25] are
[1:18:27] possible take courage all things are
[1:18:30] possible through
[1:18:32] God verse 27 then Peter said unto him
[1:18:37] behold we have forsaken all to follow
[1:18:39] thee what shall we have therefore good
[1:18:43] question isn't
[1:18:45] it and Jesus said unto them verily I say
[1:18:48] unto you that ye which have followed me
[1:18:52] in the Regeneration when the son of man
[1:18:54] shall sit on the throne of his glory you
[1:18:56] shall also sit upon 12 Thrones judging
[1:18:58] the tribes 12 tribes of
[1:19:01] Israel know you not you shall judge the
[1:19:04] Earth right Saints shall judge the
[1:19:07] Earth and everyone that hath
[1:19:10] forsaken this natural
[1:19:14] economy houses or Brethren or sisters or
[1:19:17] fathers or mothers or wife or children
[1:19:20] or lands for my name's sake shall
[1:19:22] receive hundredfold and shall inherit
[1:19:24] Merit everlasting
[1:19:27] life but many that are first shall be
[1:19:30] last and the last shall be
[1:19:35] first that's what Jesus told the Rich
[1:19:38] Young Ruler as well he said you can't
[1:19:40] you can't mix these two
[1:19:42] economies he says I've done all these
[1:19:44] things you know what shall I do to
[1:19:45] inherit eternal life and Jesus starts
[1:19:48] ring off these these things of the
[1:19:49] economy of God keep you know keep these
[1:19:52] Commandments you know honor your father
[1:19:53] and other things he says all these
[1:19:54] things I've done from my youth what lack
[1:19:57] I yet and Jesus says you've got to sell
[1:20:00] all you
[1:20:03] have and follow
[1:20:06] me you've got to truly sell out
[1:20:08] everything you have and follow God Amen
[1:20:12] doesn't necessarily mean that you got to
[1:20:13] sell all your material
[1:20:15] possessions sell that desire for those
[1:20:18] material
[1:20:19] possessions right and if there's
[1:20:21] Temptations in your life you know many
[1:20:23] riches which hardly any us are you know
[1:20:25] really rich as far as uh money in our
[1:20:27] own eyes but yet the United States is
[1:20:29] Rich look compare ourselves we have so
[1:20:32] much we are so rich so don't put
[1:20:35] yourself don't think that oh I'm safe
[1:20:37] because I'm not up here in this
[1:20:38] millionaire bracket your rich is really
[1:20:41] I mean you just have abundant riches and
[1:20:42] you don't have to be a millionaire to
[1:20:43] have abundant riches compare yourself to
[1:20:45] the rest of the
[1:20:47] world so sell that out don't try to mix
[1:20:50] the
[1:20:52] two right as we close on this last
[1:20:55] scripture I just thought this was a
[1:20:56] blessing in Genesis
[1:20:58] 1421 and the king of Sodom said unto
[1:21:01] Abram give me the persons and take the
[1:21:04] goods to thyself and Abram said to the
[1:21:07] king of Solomon I have lift up mine hand
[1:21:10] unto the Lord the most high God the
[1:21:13] possessor of Heaven and Earth that I
[1:21:15] will not take from a thread even to a
[1:21:18] Sho latchet that I will and that I will
[1:21:21] not make anything that is thine I will
[1:21:25] not take anything that is thine brother
[1:21:27] lest thou should us say I have made
[1:21:29] Abram
[1:21:31] Rich amen isn't that a good scripture
[1:21:34] for this economies that we're talking
[1:21:36] about let's be like Abraham amen the
[1:21:39] father of Faith
[1:21:41] hallelu amen as we bow our heads here
[1:21:44] let's let's close on a word of
