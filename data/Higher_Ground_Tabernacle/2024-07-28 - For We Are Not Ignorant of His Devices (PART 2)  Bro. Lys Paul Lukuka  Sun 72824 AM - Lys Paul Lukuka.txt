go to the office bring my notes I left my notes in the office but we'll start with um First Peter chapter 5 verse 8 Bible says be sober of 1 Peter chapter 5 verse 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking seeking whom he may devour amen amen so that's uh the first scripture let's go to uh 2 Corinthians 29-1 the Bible says for this end also did I write chapter 2 verse 9 for this end also did I write that I may know the proof of you whether you be obedient in all things to whom you forgive anything I forgive also for if I forgive anything to whom I forget I forgave it for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ let Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices amen let's bow our head may the Lord add a blessings reading of his word Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you Lord we thank you Lord for your word we thank you for the song service Lord father the Lord Jesus Christ I Surrender myself to you Lord that you may use me Lord and speak through me Lord Jesus and may you hear through the the the congregation Lord God and Heavenly Father Lord you know what they need Lord Jesus and I commit the service into your hand Lord may you have full control of the service in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen you may your so this is going to be the second part of the I preach on this uh sermon two two Wednesdays ago and the title of it the title of it is for we are not ignorant of his devices and I took this from uh 2 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 where Paul says lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices so from this scripture we understand that there is an advantage that the devil can get over you if you are ignorant of his if you don't know how the enemy operates then the Bible tells us that Satan has an advantage over Prophet says that when a man goes to war he he he usually said they it when a country goes to war they send spies you know they try to spy into the the enemy's land to know the weapons that they use because for instance let's say um if I go to work uh if a country goes to war and we're using knives versus a country that uses uh Atomic weapons we all know that the country that uses the atomic weapon has the advantage and that would be insane for the country that uses knife to even uh try to get into war so that's why most countries they even have secret service agencies C because you got you got to inquire about your enemy even in boxing that's the same thing like before a boxer prepares for a match watches his enemy the way he operates and the way he prepares better for the and we know that in this Christian Christian Life that we live we are also living in a battle in a fight and then Paul tells us that there is an advantage that the devil can get if we are ignorant of his devic so uh the prophet says in the message revelation this is just a a short um a summary of what I preached on Wednesday before we continue so the prophet says that Satan and Satan is exposed Satan does not want himself exposed so we know Services where we we expose the the tactic of the enemy Satan does not like it he says you notice how horrible it is for Satan when when he thinks is going to get exposed watch the action of the people you watch out on the meetings just be just before Satan is going to be exposed over a certain person you'll see their face changing so according to the prophet that Satan it's it's even it's a change that's noticeable to uh uh uh he hates that kind of a meeting the Holy Spirit comes down and exposes that devil so we understand that it's it's not going to be me who is going to be exposed the devil but it's the holy spirit that exposes the devil the holy spirit is the word at the beginning was the word the Word was God and made flesh and DW Among Us so it's the word of God of our age that is going to be exposing the the the devices of the so um let's go back to the I don't think I have the definition of it but um the definition of being ignorant means having lack of knowledge or of understanding so if if we have to to break down the scripture so pretty much they're telling us Paul is telling us that if you you have lack of knowledge or knowledge or understanding of how the devil operates then he has an advantage no wonder the Bible says that my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge 46 my people are destroy for lack of knowledge there are three things that that the Devil comes to do he comes to kill steal and destroy and then in this verse is telling us that we are destroyed for lack of knowledge for being ignorant of how the devil operates the prophet says that overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his so all the devices that the enemy uses you have to know those devices in order to overcome a real devil uh he says a lot of people says there's no devil it just thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him so the prophet did not say you may recognize the devil he you must recognize the devil it very important to recognize that something is the devil you must know he's the devil and then you uh and the same time you recognize him know that he's the devil and he's against you so you have to know that his weapons whatever devices the devil is using is point pointed at you but you must also recognize that God in you is greater and mightier than he is that in you has already overcome him so the god in you is more powerful than the enemy the god in you has already overcome the devil and if if you have that Revelation that God in you is more powerful than that's your Victory that's why it is important to be filled with the Holy Ghost because God in you is the Holy Ghost according to the prophet without the Holy Ghost you cannot overcome amen so what is what is your enemy The Prophet says your enemy is something that reason for for forgive me it's a battle you've got to want your enemy you've got to know your enemy and you've got to know your armor your armor is the word and your enemy is something that reason against it anything that comes to make you reason the word of God is your enemy if God makes a promise and something else tells you that that promise is isn't isn't the way God said it your So like um last Wednesday I'm just going to skip cuz like um I've got a lot of things to talk about um okay let let's read this one here real quick so notice and don't you underestimate Jesus Christ because he's the power over all powers and then the prophet says Don't Be Afraid Of Satan but there's a condition as as long as you are in him Jesus as long as you are in Jesus Christ don't be afraid of if you are not in him you better tremble this these are the words of the prophet of our age William Mar brother he's telling you that if you not filled with the Holy Ghost you better tremble at the Devil you know the the devil the devil is no match for us uh the prophet even says that even like you cannot match the enemy I can't match it William Bram himself could not even match the devil if you are putting your Hope on William Bram to help you overcome the devil that's you'll be disappointed because he's telling you that himself he's no mat for the dev I remember but I'm but I remember I'm living under a promise that his powers has already been more than matched and conquered and cast down I'm more than than a conqueror right now not myself so that scripture that says you are more than over conquer it's not yourself you know but I'm in him who conquered him for me Jesus conquered the devil for you the prophet did not say conquer it for for himself you have the prophet preach on a message identification you have to identify yourself with the message when the prophet says but I'm in him who conquered it for me you replace me with your name the devil uh uh has been conquered for you amen amen so uh um last last Wednesday we talked about um two two way two ways that that the enemy operates reasoning the word of God and the other one is Was Fear you know the prophet says the prophet says that sometimes you watch a person that is sick the moment they get diagnosed with an illness fear takes control of them and they even Tred to go to to to die early the prophet talks about premature death he says he says that I know that death has got to strike everyone but sometime just because of unbelief we give up and we go to a premature death and another course that I had the prophet explains out because of the fear people because fear will make you disbelieve the promises of God and when you disbelieve the promises of God you can't even go you can die prematurely those are the devices of the enemy so today we'll talk about um the third device which is uh the the devil attacks the youth so um this is for everybody for the parents for the young people amen amen all right let me check this here we'll start with um um Matthew chapter 2 verse 16 uh same can you put it there I don't think I have it here so Matthew chap 2:1 16 says then Herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men he was exceeding exceeding WTH and sent forth and slow and slow all the children slew all the children that were in Bethlehem and in all the cast thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise man all right so we see that in Matthew Herod went after the children the prophet says Spirits don't die that same demon spirit that was inherited is still alive today and that spirit is doing the same thing you know uh in the message diseases and afflictions they should be in my slides one second disease and affliction yeah I have it here so the prophet says that all the Natural Things of the earth types the spiritual everything in the natural types the spiritual everything that happens on this natural life and all these natural natural happenings now they forun spiritual happenings each happening accompanies the other happening so so the reason why I I I I read this quote is um you'll have a better understanding when we go to the next chapter in in in Exodus the king of Egypt also went after the children so this is a patter we see Herod going after the the the kids and also the king of Egypt so let uh the Lord showed me something interesting about that that chapter yesterday okay it's it's it's going to be in the book of Exodus Exodus chapter 1 verse 8 to 22 we'll just take our time with the scripture same Exodus chapter one ex all right so verse uh we'll start with the verse eight but before we read that let just read this quotes real quick the prophet says God and His enemy and is his enemy he did in the natural then just like God and His enemy is doing in the spiritual now so the prophet is talking about this chapter that we're about to read pay attention he says what the enemy did in the book of Exodus he's doing that spiritually today Satan is going after the kids that's what he did here in the book of Exodus all right let's read the verse uh eight now there a rose up a new king of Egypt which knew not Joseph and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of Israel are more and mighy than we come on let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and and it come to pass that when there fth out any War they join also unto our enemies and fight against us and so get them out of the land let just pause here right so the prophet says that the the uh spiritual T the natural T the spiritual and whatever happened there is just forerunning what what is happening when I was reading this this chapter yesterday in verse 9 when it says that so let's picture this like as the United States of America if you notice here that the Egyptians so this was an immigration issue the children of Israel migrated to Egypt and then they started to multiply [Music] blessed and now the CH the the Egyptians started to fear that these people are becoming more than us isn't that what's happening today you know we in America or even in Europe I see that in France Paris they are afraid that those immigrants are becoming more than the people that that used to leave this these are just spiritual type God is God is showing us something the problem is everything that happens in the natural tiies the spiritual so just like here they were afraid that people would take over their land right and if you you notice verse 10 he says and so get them out of the land end that's massive deportation let's get them out of our land isn't that a slogan in the US now you know like let's get all those migrants out of the land the Bible says you know watch and pray you know we have to pay attention to those things we just we don't have to read the news just like the regular people we have to read the news we have to read the news with the glasses of the word of God so verse 11 therefore the deed said over them task Masters them with their burdens and they buil treasure cities and let's skip to verse 13 and the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor ver 15 and the king of Egypt speak to the Hebrew midwives of which the name of the one was Shipra and the name of the other po and he said when you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them up on the stools if it be a son then you shall kill him but if you be a daughter then she shall live that is abortion isn't that what's happening today you know they wanted to kill the the uh baby uh the son son son the baby son you know the king of Egypt told the midwives you know because because they tried to to make to to make them do the hard labor but they noticing that they keep on multiplying still so let's find a different strategy now let's go through the route abortion but you have to know that as we know these things every all the laws that happen in the land are targeted at the of Christ all the laws of the land that are contrary to the Bible is targeted at you the prophet says that you must understand that the devil he's against you against his own people I can prove this by the scripture let's go to Daniel chapter 6 and then we'll come back to exod Daniel chapter 6 uh King Darius and Daniel so verse three uh and then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because in excellent Spirit was in him and the King thought to set him over the whole realm then the president and prin sought to find occasions against uh but they could they could find none occasion nor fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found So Daniel was appointed as like so there was the king and then there were princes and presidents and Daniel was the head right after the king so he had the highest position after the king so these other people they got jealous of and they sought to find a way to just put him down but they couldn't find any fault in him that's that's what the devil ising he's trying to put down the bride but he cannot find any fault in the bride so he looks for different strategies then verse five then say these men we shall not find any occasion against Daniel except find it against him concerning the Lord these presidents and princes assembled together to the king and say th unto him King Darius I'll skip the verse seven you know they talking to the king and in verse eight uh uh verse n wherefore King arus signed the writing and the decree so this King darus he signed a law just to show you that it does never never put your Hope on a man because Daniel was be loved by this King this King loved Daniel so much but he got tricked you know if you like it doesn't matter who you friend of like the devil Prophet says that the devil is even in the white house right now so it doesn't matter if it's Joe Biden Trump Satan is after the bride so verse 10 now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house okay let's skip that one let's go to verse 11 then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making then they came near and spake before the king concerning the king's decree verse 13 then then answered they and said before the king that Daniel which is of the Children of the Captivity of Judah regardest not thee Oh King verse 14 then the King when he heard these words was so displeased with himself and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him so the king did not even have control over even making the laws of the this King loved Daniel so much but he signed a law that it seemed like it was for everybody but we just read those presidents they were targeting Daniel so an entire country changed the law just so they could get to Daniel the prophet is telling us we have to understand the the way Satan operates and he says he still uses the same tactic today so laws of a country can just be changed just they're aiming the bride all those abortion laws that are coming into place it's not for those people Satan cannot fight against himself Jesus told his kingdom will be divided he against the bride of Christ and so feeding that all these things are happening in the book of Exodus the prophet preached the message to Third Exodus we are near the third we are living in the Third Exodus very soon the Lord is coming and we be you know all these these things that are happening it was already typified in and now we seeing these things happening in the spiritual me in it's just a sign that we are close to the coming of the Lord amen and then uh verse uh let's go back to Exodus chapter 117 no let's just go to 22 I'll SK cuz I'm running out of term um Pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born uh every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save alive right so we understand that also the king of Egypt went after the kids through different ways abortion the prophet of God said he was after the seed of Moses you notice it's a son you know and then also in the in in the Matthew we see that he's going after his son and in Revelation 12 we also see that the dragon is going after his son do you know that from Genesis to to to to to this day the devil has been going after that seed he's been going after the Sun what is the bride of Christ going to do we are supposed to produce the son of of God that's what the devil is going after you know these things clearly was a shadow of what is happening today amen all right so okay yeah there's another thing that also comes to my mind notice here every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter you shall save a life you know God show me through the scripture if you notice they did not try to kill the daughters just the sons you know the son is the person that gives the seed so the tactic of the enemy he wanted to kill all the sons so that he they only remain daughters and then the hybrid they get yeah they get mixed between the Egyptians and the children of Israel you know and then and and and then that way they kill that seed because the male is the person that gives the seed if he he didn't care about the daughters because they didn't they weren't seed carriers they and then the prophet tells us the same thing in this message uh the Third Exodus notice the devil the first thing he done was get rid ofid of the children with a natural death you know and he had moved from Egypt you know uh and then he was in Rome Satan moved his seed up to Rome the first thing Rome did was to destroy it all it's the same devil you know the prophet telling now it's it's a spiritual death and today he's done the same thing under the sign of spirit now religious professing Christianity and taking our girls and marrying them to Catholic boys and make them bring their children Catholic to break the power of the other side there is your demon you see we this sermon is about exposing the the tactic of the enemy parents don't just give your daughters to anybody the devil uses that tactic to also break the the the the seed of God to break the power of the other side you know the prophet say he's using the same intellectual Tech so make sure you on when a guy comes to get your daughter make sure you know his beliefs right because we see that that's what they tried to do here they wanted to kill the son so they will use the daughters and mix them with the Egyptians to break the power of the other side and the prophet is telling us he's using the same you know they then they kill the children in the other two times the first two times with natural death and he's getting the children and kill them with spiritual death Maring and are marrying Satan is even using marriage to kill people spiritually you know breaking that power amen so now um this is just going to be I'm just going to be it's kind of like a study or just an awareness to make you to make you aware of the of what the devil does in our day this was just setting the foundation to show you actually what he's doing today so he's going up he went up to the children in with Herod and ex I'll show you this image real quick this was last year the LGBT Q group lgbtq now Satan is not even hiding anymore what is it saying we are coming for your children so these gay people they no no longer even hiding there but they're saying we are coming for your children why because they did the same thing in Exodus same in Matthew today again Satan is going for your children he's attacking the youth right and and then this here that says this is in California the teacher Union urges tools to promote drag queen story hours to help further inclusing inclusive atmosphere so Dr the drag queens are those men they they they they act like they dress like women they change to be like women now the the school's Union is saying that have promote that to your kids to further inclose him so that they feel included why does a kid need to know about those drag queens pay attention Satan is going for the bride he doesn't care about the children in the world he's going after your kids all these laws that are coming into place we saw with Daniel it was targeted at so this is targeted at the bride of Christ and you may say that's in California right this was just in Deo here last year a drug story hours at the Deo Public Library why do they want to go after kids so bad like that Noti Spirits don't die the same same tactic right demon here in the public library having kids and and men dressing like women in front of kids and this was uh two days uh last week in in California they even they they they they passed a law where if a kid go to school and he tells his teacher that he identifies as a for instance let's say a man identify as a woman now the school no longer is required to notify the parents about is that isn't that insane a child goes what does he know we are supposed to be uh leading the child those teachers are supposed to be showing them the right way now the Govern government is telling them don't tell the parents anymore so if a kid of like uh eight years old goes to the teacher and says I'm a transgender I want to change my my my gender the the parent will never know about that pay attention what you sending your kids to amen um all right so the next one uh is I had an a slide that I had here but yeah okay so this is what happened at the Olympics this was just two days ago I think those same drag queens drag que now they're making fun of the last supper and if you notice there's a child there too why why are they so obsessed with children right so Satan is coming up to your children parents be careful you have to know who your CH your children hang out with you know I'm not a parents I don't know how you guys but I'll say as a I'm talking from a a kid a young man's perspective perspective sometime as parent you need to just ask them why did they teach you at school you you got you just got to check those stuff the prophet talks about parents delinquency right and uh yeah let's just read that here no before we go into parental D let's go into the next so last Sunday brother Jesse was here and he preached on uh one of the things he also preached about was pornography right he did not even know I already had this in my notes since last Wednesday I just didn't get to finish it last Wednesday and he spoke about that so that means that and and then don't take this by that means god is actually God actually cares for you and want you to be deliver so this is uh this thing about this stat that I found about I know it's too small I won't say too much since you already spoke about spoke a lot the pornography industry generates more income than the combined revenues of ABC NBC and CBS and more than the combined revenues of the NFL NBA MLB in the USA land at between 15 billion to 97 billion a [Music] year every second $3,000 is being spent on pornography more people viewed internet pornography every month than Netflix Amazon and Twitter combined in 2016 people watch 4 4.6 billion hours of pornography at just one of the more than 42 million pornographic website 42 million pornograph [Music] so there are 42 million porn websites and in just one of them they spent 4.6 billion that's the equivalent of 524,000 years spent in one year now pay attention who is their their target uh audience 93% of boys and 63% of girls will be exposed to the internet point before the age of 18 the average age of first exposure is 11 years old and sometimes eight years old imagine a kid8 years old being such n that's why parents sometimes check your phon with your kids I remember uh one time I want mention the name in North Liberty years ago uh we had like a a party my at my house and there was a kid who just went on the basement he was probably 11 or 10 something like that and then I just felt like to go downstairs to talk to him and then um I just I don't know I I forgot the conversation we had in our conversation I felt late to ask him you know if um he uh watch his pornography and he denied he said no he he never he said he said he used to but he no longer does but he notice the devil doesn't like to be exposed right so I ask him when was the last time since you said you used to so when was the last time you oh just a few days ago so he was a kid of like 10 9 11 and the parents don't know it no check your your children's phone no probably not don't even give them phones when they 10 years old I'm not trying to tell you how to parent your kids I'm just trying to help you through the lens of the word and it's up to you to take it or not take it amen so uh and then this thing about pornography we we're not just going to talk about the kids even the married couples and I have a quote for that I'll read that in a second it even affects people who are married people have excuses oh no because we are married we can watch stuff but I think we are all message Believers right if I if I give you my opinion you won't you won't listen let me just read you what the prophet say then it's up to you to say Amen to it or not say Amen to it so obviously the prophet did not use the word pornography but you understand what he's talking about I don't believe in filthy living among among Pentecostal people Holiness people even if they're married I don't believe in that no sir some of this dirty stuff I get in here sometimes but I mean on times I'm I'm out in California and different places like that to see a man that will try to take his little wife and dirty filthy you understand what I mean [Music] and I'm sure you guys understand what it means you're all adults and I'm not going to We The Prophet did not go into details and I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself as a man of God you just be a husband be a sweetheart respect her like you always respect her don't any attention to some of these sexy books or these nonsense in these sexy books and things that you read about and all these stuff and everything like that get that filthy stuff out of your mind these are the word of Malachi 4 he did not use the word pornography but he talked about those sexy books because you know in that time television was not evolved like that they didn't even have cellones so pornography they had to print those on books and they to go buy to go buy those in stores and the prophet says that get that filthy stuff out of your mind the Bible said let let not one dirty conversation come among you you know and then ask he says you are my kids I got a right to say what I want to say you you are my kids you live right are we the kids of brother amen amen and he says if you identify as his children then he has the right you to get that dirty stuff out of your life amen amen all right so uh going back to parental delinquency I don't think I'll have time to finish but however God leads um so the prophet talks about he says and let me say this with reverence and with respect if these American mothers and fathers would put more time praying for their children like job did there will be less juvenile qu the trouble of it is our modern American mothers and fathers lead them to [Music] drinking and to card playing and to cigarettes smoking things of that sort which makes juvenile delinquency it really isn't juvenile delinquency it's parent delinquency neglecting to come to God and find him then trouble strikes so this is the prophet addressing you the parent we just uh uh uh uh showed you how the devil is targeting your children what are you going to do about it are you the prophet is saying it's actually not even the children's fault your your fault mama's having a little innocent fun maybe their husband were home baby setting or some hired child is taking care of their [Music] children the prophet says God gave you them children to take care of them yourselves and it's your responsibility to God you want to know your responsibility as a mother the Propet is to take care of those children not not not to hire some child to take care of your kids or have your husband stay home to take care of the kids understand circumstances happen but the thing is that we have to understand what is the priority the priority shouldn't be the money that you're making at work because while while you the husband and the wife are spending so much time working and the dragon is going after your kids and the parents are not even aware of it it's your responsibility to you know we don't have juvenile delinquency we parental they want to run to bar barrooms and carry on no wonder they grow up in the neurotic age God gave you that child to raise and to take care you want a child and when God gives you that child then you you you you you just send that child to to daycare all day or you go you go work 24/7 and by the time you come back home you don't even have time to to to take check the parents said parents neglecting you know you it's God gave you that child to raise and amen can we all say Amen to that amen um I'm not trying to go hard on on on you or anything like that I'm really just trying trying to help you and expose the tactic of tactic of the dev in in Exodus also we see that when um pH Pharaoh was about to let the children of Israel go God hardened his heart and they increased the labor the children of Israel right so so having too sometime working too much could also be just the devil keep trying to keep you from doing what God actually purposed for you to especially mothers because your responsibility is to raise those kids they took they took out our women stried them out y in the offices and driving Taxi cabs so in our day women doing door Dash Uber you not even women but mostly mothers and down the street where they ought to be at home behind the behind the stove cooking and fixing the dinners what is it it's a devil The Invasion is on Amen this is the prophet of God Prophet they see he in his in his days he even talking about mothers driving taxi caps you have little kids at home but you go to das Uber and then you leave your husband to take care of your the prophet says it's the devil we Call It by name like I didn't read that quote earlier but the prophet says that you have to recognize the devil and and call it by name the prophet say that it's not like for instance you say you say have cancer they tell you have cancer and then you say no I don't have cancer no the prophet said in order to overcome that cancer you must first know it's cancer you must first know it's the devil then you can overcome it we're exposing the way the devil is working the invasion is on and and it's and then it's so fitting that the prophet says this message the title is It's not invasion of the world it's invasion of the United States that's in the US that you really see women doing do das Uber more than even in Africa you know why it's the devil right well you you ought to be at home raising but so busy working and then and then you wonder why your kids are turning the way they are turning you don't even you don't even check uh their environment you don't even check who their friends are the prophet says her Daddy I'll I'll probably close very soon the prophet says her daddy walk in at night and L up his cigarette take a glass of beer and sit down and drink it mother is out throughout the daytime with a bunch of women in some card party how can you expect the child to be anything else look whatever environment you live in that's what you are so even in the house how do you like the prophet is saying that how do you expect the child to be any different when in the house the child is is growing seeing daddy and mommy fighting then to him he thinks that fighting is something normal you got to set the right environment in your heart in your homes don't blame the child for turning the way he's turning when yourself you take a little bitty girl little bitty boy put them out here let them live with somebody you take a man I can take my boy let him be out for a day with somebody and let me come in I can always tell you who he's been with watch that environment C we're dealing with the youth here right so pay attention who your your who are your children's friends in the message influence I don't have the prophet says there are two kind of there are two things that happen when you uh uh in the work that works uh with influence it's either uh you're going to influence somebody or that person is going to inflence and here the prophet is saying was environment because that spirites you know don't just let any kids be around your your children we we every one of us here carry Spirit the prophet even explains you go to a church you see like the church seems to have the spirit of the pastor and then it's like that the more you hang out with someone uh you you catch their Spirits so someone asked the prophet a question brother Bram what achievement should we let our pre-teenage children participate in [Music] how should we go about helping them select their Associates I love this message because about you know even how to help your children select now this is the prophet resp keep them in a Christian company as long as you possibly can you know when a child is at an age and I'll say as long as you you can that means like as long as they still leaving in your house you have the right to help them keep uh uh the good company if it's a girl keep her with Christian girls Christian boys vice versa and if she's old enough to go with a boy see that she keeps with the right kind of a boy discourage her to any boy otherwise if she's going with an unbeliever try to encourage her to go with a Believer notice he did not say force her to go with aie or beat her to go with aever encourage her there's a way you talk to a child to make you know um uh to make them to make them uh I think the Bible says parents do not uh upset your parents something U parents do not upset your kids I might be not quoting it exactly but something like that so there is a way parents are supposed to be talking to their kids yeah do not provoke your children thank you right so try to encourage them no hey I don't think you should hang out with this person because of this because of this why don't you try to go hang out with this person find a good way to encourage because the environment where they in matters right amen um so here the prophet says no okay this is even he's even talking about himself you wonder no okay someone said he he said Daddy if there was just some boys around there that had the Holy Ghost the prophet says you want wonder why I was I was getting away to Denver Colorado or somewhere somewhere like that get my children somewhere where there's a bunch of people who cry out to God that's what we need brother amen so the even the imagine how how powerful the prophet's Ministry was but he he still needed to make sure he kids were in the good you know get them with people that cry out to God we have some parents here their children they probably hang out with unbelievers more than they hang out with you know I think your parents you should encourage your children to go to the house of other children's Believers people cry out to God nowadays there are even youth camps know youth youth camps that's actually how God started working with me through a youth camp because when I came to the US I I mean I I backl when I came to the US because I was I was I I grew up in an environment where I was always like at home and the moment I came to the US I thought that was an opportunity for an opportunity for me to try out the world I was actually really happy about that and then and and you know I've always heard you know I came from a church where there's a lot of teachers nothing bad about that but I never really knew how real God could be and it's a long story but first 4 you know when God started dealing with me I started watching different youth camps and seeing young men and young young young young women like crying out to God for the holy and seeing the power of the Holy Ghost working through them I I've never seen anything like that you know this before I got saved I used to I used to think that God was not fair to me because I used to think that uh there are some people that they live in the world for 80 years they enjoy the things of the world then at 80 they give their heart to God so why is God asking me to give him my heart now I was like let me enjoy the world first and 70 80 I'll give you my life but then when I started going to those camps the power of God working through the young people it changed my thought process now I started thinking where was I all these years where would where would I have been with God if I was already filled with the Holy Ghost since I was 10 the environment plays a role when your your child is an environment where people are crying out to God the prophet says that's what we need amen amen I'll end with this thing um the next time I get an opportunity to continue I will continue God's willing there's still a lot of things that um but then I I'll end with this one here um Sam can you play that that small video of that Pale [Music] Horse so at the Olympics um two days ago there was um so the the same people that I'll show you guys the image of how they Blas The Last Supper like Satan is not even hiding anymore all right so watch this video now they doing image with a a Rider riding on a p horse just play it real quick right so this is what they're portraying to to us on the whole world watch it you see someone right on a Pale Horse we are believers of this message the prophet told us what the Pale Horse is let's go to Revelation chapter 6 apocalypse 6 Sam slides can you uh Revelation 6 verse 7 so the Bible says and when he had opened the fourth SE I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that said on him was death and Hell Followed With Him death the prophet just told us that at first it was natural death but now doing he's working spiritually and then right before that they they showed an image gay people with a child on it Satan is seeking to destroy you sat now he's not he's not hiding anymore he wants he's letting you know that there's a death angel that's going to try to kill and the prophet says that death means Eternal separation it Satan is even making a plane he's not hiding anymore why did they just choose a pale horse out of all the [Music] hores let's not be ignorant of his devic Satan is going after the bride of Christ the prophet says that this fourth seal he says that that Beast the devil turns into the beast but he says that happens after the Rapture so we know what times we're living in this death this death and Hell follow him the prophecies that's happening that's happening after the Rapture because the church will have to be raptured the bride will have to so we living in the end end days you know this death is coming and he's attacking your children what are you going to do about it no let's not be ignorant of the devil's devices amen amen
