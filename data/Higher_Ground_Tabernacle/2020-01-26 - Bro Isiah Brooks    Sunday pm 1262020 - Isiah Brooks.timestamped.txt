[1:09] Jesus
[1:11] [Music]
[1:15] when I was covered by me
[2:30] I'm covered by blood Jesus has rescued
[2:46] me
[2:50] amen praise the Lord I didn't Ben give
[2:54] anybody else any opportunity amen praise
[2:57] the Lord have a testimony or anything
[2:59] like that but Amen anybody has anything
[3:15] make me give that desktop a little bit
[3:19] of wisdom it seems so simple I can tell
[3:32] you story it happened to me on Friday or
[3:35] Saturday I guess it was I smoked big
[3:51] chunk of ice it was a blowing snow
[3:55] pulled back in the garage looked at his
[3:58] pack balls well I just have to use the
[4:03] old-fashioned way a little bit later on
[4:07] took my wife to the airport those were
[4:13] Tampa that and I went back out and
[4:21] looked at it and I look down the chute
[4:25] so simple as that cap is look down the
[4:29] chute the next time and I look down the
[4:32] chute and there is a rock about the size
[4:34] round rock about the size of my chute
[4:37] nestled in there found a place that
[4:40] shouldn't be and how a rock got in the
[4:43] middle of my driveway I have no idea but
[4:45] I there started it back up and just like
[4:51] we would expect thank you thank God for
[4:55] just two simple things and the things

[5:20] the Lord Jesus Christ we thank you Lord

[5:29] peace because you knew it the beginning

[5:38] our heart because you put it there your
[5:41] divine nature you said to seek first the

[27:09] [Music]
[27:16] [Applause]
[27:19] [Music]
[27:24] I wonder
[27:31] [Music]
[28:11] Hey
[28:14] we appreciate you tonight or today or
[28:17] this evening how we want to say it I'm
[28:19] not gonna keep you long I know you've
[28:21] been waiting for me and waiting on me oh
[28:23] by the grace of God I wanted to start on
[28:27] a little series but I'll have to wait I
[28:30] was gonna startled the Book of
[28:32] Revelations but I think I'm gonna hold
[28:34] off and just Minister a thought here by
[28:36] God's grace and I trusted it'll be a
[28:39] blessing to you in Jesus Christ's name
[28:42] you love the Lord I hope and trust that
[28:44] you had a wonderful service this morning
[28:48] amen we appreciate everything that the
[28:52] Lord is doing by the grace of God if you
[28:55] would turn with me though to the Book of
[28:57] Revelations thank God for the musician I
[29:02] both of them appreciate our March I
[29:06] brother Mario and Amy and everybody like
[29:09] he said who helped us with these chairs
[29:11] for some reason I forgot when you order
[29:14] stuff they do not come assembled so we
[29:19] had a little task and by the grace of
[29:21] God we did the best that we could and so
[29:24] to God be all the glory we just had only
[29:27] a few chairs that I lack in the back of
[29:30] them I bagged and I just assumed they're
[29:32] going to send them to us at a later date
[29:36] but anyway Revelation is 22 i I believe
[29:42] and I said this to the church this
[29:43] morning down in Iowa City I just believe
[29:46] that we're living in the last days I am
[29:49] more convinced now than ever before not
[29:53] because of all of the things that the
[29:55] world is going through and they are
[29:56] they're going through a lot of turmoil
[29:59] and you know it's falling apart
[30:02] but it's the church that I'm looking at
[30:07] because this is a time that we supposed
[30:11] to be on fire Jesus said I would that
[30:14] you be hot or cold lukewarm you get
[30:17] spewed out and it just seems like I see
[30:20] more lukewarmness that I do fire not
[30:24] saying that God is not going to catch us
[30:26] a fire they go
[30:28] go to forsake us he will not but I think
[30:31] if we come to a place where we
[30:33] understand that we have a ministry and
[30:35] this ministry cannot be done without
[30:38] Christ and Christ must have a place amen
[30:42] to work through and that place that he
[30:45] has chosen to work through is us so
[30:49] revelations 22 beginning at the
[30:51] seventeenth verse and the spirit and the
[31:01] bride says come and let him that heareth
[31:07] say come and let him that is athirst
[31:11] come and whosoever will let him take the
[31:18] water of life freely
[31:21] I love that because he says water not
[31:25] waters one water one life one God let us
[31:31] pray
[31:32] father God we thank you for your grace
[31:34] and your mercy we thank you for your
[31:37] goodness and all that you do for us Lord
[31:39] we pray father God all of the things
[31:41] that we are lacking father that you
[31:44] would give us grace to overcome Lord be
[31:48] merciful to us we are your seed we call
[31:53] upon your name and in your name we trust
[31:56] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[31:59] you may be seated
[32:06] as I was saying this morning you don't
[32:12] have to be anything in this world for
[32:17] God to use you God has already
[32:20] predetermined those who he has chosen to
[32:26] do specific works now the works in which
[32:30] God has called us to do may not
[32:33] necessarily be that thing that we hope
[32:37] to do like many of us wish we were
[32:41] musicians many of us wish we could sing
[32:43] many of us wish you know we always have
[32:45] that desire to do other things that God
[32:48] has not ordained us to do and so
[32:50] sometimes it's very difficult for us to
[32:52] settle down in the place in which God
[32:55] has ordained us to be in and you know
[32:58] that's what the Holy Ghost is here for
[33:00] because when the Holy Ghost comes in
[33:02] your life
[33:03] he positionally places you in the
[33:06] position in which you should be in I was
[33:10] reading by God's grace second Kings 5:1
[33:15] through 27 and we all know about the
[33:19] leopard call naman now naman amen was a
[33:24] Syrian and he was a rich man he was an
[33:28] intelligent man but one of the things
[33:30] that naman had he had leprosy but you
[33:34] see none of us would have known who
[33:38] naman was because he wasn't of the
[33:41] Jewish faith but he was a Gentile and
[33:46] the Bible tells us that there was a
[33:50] little girl who had no name there is no
[33:54] name given to her she was not what we
[33:58] would have looked upon as being royalty
[34:01] but in the story she literally
[34:04] represents the bride because she had a
[34:07] ministry and the thing about it because
[34:11] layman would have never known that God
[34:14] has sent a prophet or that when there
[34:15] was a prophet in the land had
[34:18] not been for this young lady hallelujah
[34:21] and you know what God never did give her
[34:25] a name hallelujah so you see by God's
[34:29] grace it's not important to have a name
[34:32] the most important thing is to know that
[34:34] you are written or your name is written
[34:36] in the Lamb's Book of Life amen and so
[34:40] here was naman who represented the
[34:43] Gentile and Gentile Church Amen that God
[34:46] had led this girl to say hey you having
[34:50] issues but I know there's a prophet in
[34:55] the land that I know that if he pray for
[34:58] you this leprosy will be undone and it's
[35:04] like just just like looks people you
[35:07] know a lot of people don't even like the
[35:09] idea of being baptized but it doesn't
[35:12] matter whether you like it or not God
[35:15] says you must be baptized and you must
[35:18] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[35:20] Jesus Christ but there are people who
[35:22] says no I'd rather be sprinkled why do I
[35:25] have to get baptized because God said so
[35:28] now naman could have said like Moses
[35:31] Moses Moses you're holy ground take off
[35:35] your shoes you are a holy ground
[35:38] what if Moses would have said up I take
[35:41] my hat off instead it never would have
[35:44] worked because God told Moses take off
[35:47] your shoes you understand what I'm going
[35:51] see because I want you to understand we
[35:54] are preparing to meet the Lord and in
[35:57] order to meet the Lord you and I must be
[35:59] in order
[36:00] his order not ours and we're going to
[36:04] find out that as we climb the letter on
[36:09] a letter or the steps of a perfect man
[36:12] the thing that hinders us from reaching
[36:16] the top is self will self will because
[36:24] that was nameless problem.we lord why
[36:28] can't I go over here
[36:31] a dip in this this this this particular
[36:33] River or the other river but God didn't
[36:36] say the other river
[36:38] he said Jordan because Jordan was a
[36:42] symbolic of judgment you're seeing is
[36:45] judged and therefore it is also symbolic
[36:50] of death you must die to yourself can I
[36:55] say like this seven times in order to be
[36:58] complete hey man if you got fear you
[37:04] can't have fear and faith at the same
[37:06] time so fear must die faith in order for
[37:11] faith to live so what happens eventually
[37:16] name and goals and he's he's literally
[37:19] he's dipping in this this water seven
[37:22] times now I want you to understand that
[37:25] Elijah's ministry was also a Ministry of
[37:29] the resurrection it was a Ministry of
[37:32] Resurrection it was a Ministry of
[37:36] restoration is that right because Elijah
[37:39] spirit went off Elijah and went into
[37:42] Elijah and Remer will remember in
[37:44] Elijah's are oh they were out there
[37:47] working and one man was cutting down a
[37:50] tree but the axe head fell off into the
[37:54] water right and what he did to the
[37:57] property told Elijah what had happened
[37:59] and what happened he logic cut a piece
[38:01] of steak off threw it into water and the
[38:04] axe head floated back up and the young
[38:06] man was able to get the axe head back
[38:09] she was a it was a restoration is that
[38:12] right
[38:12] but in Elijah's ministry it was also a
[38:17] Ministry of resurrection it was a
[38:19] Ministry of life because naman typed out
[38:23] the sinner he had leprosy and leprosy is
[38:27] a type of sin and seven church ages a
[38:31] man was represented in this one man's
[38:35] action by different seven times
[38:38] hallelujah every age had to die to their
[38:42] own way
[38:43] in order for us to come where we are in
[38:46] this age we are up there hallelujah in
[38:50] that age but you and I must dip seven
[38:53] times we must die - so veil to our will
[38:58] now I want you to know where your we're
[39:01] the strongest of your wheel lays within
[39:04] your flesh because it's your flesh that
[39:07] keeps you away from God it hides God
[39:11] from you
[39:12] that's what Paul said you must kill him
[39:15] you must die daily not every other day
[39:19] not every week every day you must kill
[39:23] him in order for Christ to live in you
[39:27] in a greater way hallelujah you love the
[39:32] Lord so what happens when name and after
[39:36] he he dips into the Jordan seven times
[39:39] he comes up and his flesh is brand new
[39:42] like a baby fresh brand new it was a
[39:47] type of the resurrection he went up went
[39:49] down up and down seven times he comes up
[39:52] amen and he's brand new it shows that
[39:56] this age because we're under the Elijah
[39:59] age when we did die to ourselves we have
[40:03] a resurrection that will give us a new
[40:06] body hallelujah now I'm just working
[40:10] with this just for the moment because I
[40:14] want you to understand that in this
[40:15] season same season you got a servant by
[40:19] the name of Gaza and Ganesha amen was a
[40:23] man who followed the Prophet around all
[40:26] the time he was a servant let's say he
[40:28] was one of the ministers of the message
[40:31] of Elijah and the thing about it is
[40:34] instead of following through with
[40:36] Elijah's message he wanted to get paid
[40:38] for it you see here's what all present
[40:42] was what are you saying
[40:42] that is the danger because understand
[40:45] that while God was allowing the
[40:50] restoration of Naamans body that's been
[40:53] his way as he was restoring the
[40:56] body of Jesus Christ guy haze' had his
[41:00] line on money that was the will of man
[41:05] he saw the will of God go free you owe
[41:09] me nothing
[41:10] but in his ministry Gaza runs after
[41:14] Mammon and says what can you offer me
[41:17] now putting it in our terms why are you
[41:20] saying that because you've got to find
[41:23] out that every every step you make will
[41:26] be your will versus God will God will
[41:30] never take your will from you you have
[41:32] to submit your will to God is that right
[41:35] even Jesus Christ when he was there in
[41:38] the Garden of Gethsemane he had to die
[41:41] to his own will and he says Lord not my
[41:46] will but thine be done
[41:48] it was in the garden that he gained the
[41:50] victory not on Calvary it was in the God
[41:53] he gained the victory therefore the
[41:55] victory was given to him in Calvary but
[41:58] he had to pray through father I don't
[42:01] want to do this but I see that your word
[42:04] requires me to do this nevertheless not
[42:08] my will but thine be done
[42:09] you understand that so when you see by
[42:12] God's grace that your will amen must
[42:16] come in junction with God's will in
[42:19] order to please God I spoke this this
[42:23] morning and I was talking about how
[42:25] David's men Davis at all if I could just
[42:29] have me a drink of water
[42:31] David never offered that water
[42:35] uh-uh you know ask his servants or his
[42:38] soldiers to get water but according to
[42:41] the private god he says even a high says
[42:44] the desires of God should become a
[42:48] commandment to us
[42:50] hallelujah just o desire and that those
[42:54] two men thought they meant through 15
[42:58] miles 15 I ain't talking about running
[43:02] I'm not even talking about walking they
[43:05] thought 15 miles to bring
[43:10] gave it a glass of water think about it
[43:13] if we compete that serious about God
[43:17] being long time to church now most of us
[43:20] don't have that problem but my poor ear
[43:22] being on time to church being of service
[43:26] of God winning are just you know there's
[43:29] things that needed to be around need to
[43:31] be done around church and we fail to do
[43:34] it because we want somebody to ask
[43:36] listen that's not the right way when you
[43:39] see the desires of God because the Word
[43:42] of God plainly tells us what he's
[43:45] looking for
[43:46] it ought to be everyman zeal to take
[43:50] that that desire and make it a
[43:52] commandment before God what did David do
[43:55] after they fought themselves it fought
[43:57] all the way 15 miles to get David a
[44:00] drink of water
[44:01] he liked type he typed Christ and he
[44:04] took that glass of water and he poured
[44:06] it on the ground thank God for that
[44:10] hallelujah you know what he was doing
[44:12] that was a free will offering that was a
[44:16] that offering was made win when they
[44:19] pierced him in the side and out came
[44:21] water and blood it was a type of Christ
[44:25] think about it
[44:26] when David was climbing that mountain
[44:28] and that little crippled man be getting
[44:31] slapped him and kicked him or whatever
[44:33] spit on him and called him a dog and
[44:35] then just one of David's soldiers were
[44:37] getting ready to take his head off is
[44:39] that right David said don't touch him
[44:41] God told him to do it how many of us
[44:45] would have done that hallelujah
[44:47] well he denied his own will you don't
[44:49] think he was embarrassed you don't think
[44:51] the pain was there but somehow David was
[44:54] in the spirit of God and he recognized
[44:57] this man could not have done that had
[45:00] not God allowed him to do it you see
[45:03] what I'm saying dying to your will means
[45:05] on your job in your school in your home
[45:07] in your church everywhere you and I are
[45:11] being tested right now everywhere we go
[45:15] my will of God's will hallelujah
[45:21] this is no matter where
[45:23] whatever you do whosoever will die like
[45:26] that because God knows those who were in
[45:30] his mind you understand me and when God
[45:33] get ready to summons you you got to go
[45:38] hallelujah you don't know why you have
[45:40] to move but you got to move I still
[45:44] marvel when Jesus began to pick his
[45:46] disciples some on their jobs and doing
[45:49] this and done that doing the other
[45:50] dropping their nets quitting a job
[45:52] leaving their homes to follow Jesus but
[45:55] there were some ins I need you I need
[46:00] you and some he just called my name and
[46:03] they followed see you when God gets the
[46:06] summers in you y'all know what that
[46:07] means it means that God has an appointed
[46:10] time for you and he has a place where
[46:14] you need to be at a certain time because
[46:17] he's going to be there so when God
[46:19] summons you huh you you understand what
[46:22] I'm saying it's what we must understand
[46:25] but how how are we going to know is God
[46:29] is like this simple my sheep hear with
[46:33] my voice and a stranger they will not
[46:36] follow you don't happen and when God
[46:39] calls you or summons you to do something
[46:41] it does not mean that everybody else is
[46:43] going to hear the call everybody else is
[46:47] not gonna even see what you see
[46:49] it's just like when Saul was on his way
[46:51] to Damascus is that right and the light
[46:54] shine from heaven hallelujah knocked him
[46:56] off the horse
[46:58] what happened everybody didn't see what
[47:01] Paul saw not today hear what Paul heard
[47:04] it was Paul's time God summons him and
[47:08] you know what the first thing Saul
[47:11] wanted to know who art thou Lord he
[47:14] wanted to know who God was
[47:17] you think Saul ever had a problem with
[47:21] knowing that he wasn't God that might
[47:27] sound like really weird but listen let
[47:29] me put it this way Saul knew that he was
[47:32] called by God he understood who that
[47:35] pilla fire art
[47:37] you understand me and he called him Lord
[47:42] we remember I read the quote last week
[47:45] but all the stars but I said we stars
[47:48] right and their stars we play our part
[47:52] at night but when the rising of the Sun
[47:55] he said we we dishonor ourselves in
[48:00] other words we move out the way right we
[48:04] move out the way why because we don't
[48:06] want to get the glory that the Sun is
[48:08] going to get we blend in with the
[48:11] sunlight the stars are still there but
[48:14] it's no longer the Stars time it's the
[48:17] sun's time that's why the prophet of God
[48:20] preached the rising of the Sun he was
[48:22] moving on the way and he was denying
[48:25] himself that we might see Jesus who's
[48:28] the true Son of God even nature teaches
[48:31] us that and I don't know why people have
[48:33] so much so much a hard time let me tell
[48:36] you something I can't help but to
[48:37] worship the man who saved me hallelujah
[48:42] you love the Lord now my point is the
[48:46] flesh must be conquered because it's in
[48:50] the flesh where the self will really
[48:53] works who you and I are made out of
[48:57] three parts right body soul and spirit
[49:02] you understand me and when we understand
[49:05] what we are and who we are just like I
[49:08] said this morning
[49:09] amen how many y'all know that Jesus is
[49:12] not on the throne in heaven and where he
[49:20] where is he there he's in your heart
[49:25] I went trying to do a trick question but
[49:27] the the throne of God is in your heart
[49:32] this is where he wants to be enthroned
[49:36] is that right
[49:38] he should not come down he said a
[49:40] confident I've got to go away but
[49:42] another comforter shall come remember I
[49:45] told you that the other day I said that
[49:47] comforter is like a UH a Georgian you
[49:51] attorneys you're an attorney he's there
[49:53] to comfort you that you're kicking has
[49:56] already been paid hallelujah
[49:59] you don't worry about anything you just
[50:02] keep pressing through the veil keep
[50:06] denying yourself don't let your flesh
[50:09] have a picnic kill it it is your
[50:14] greatest enemy brother Brennan said not
[50:16] the devil you your body y'all know what
[50:23] I tell I said this all the time if I
[50:24] didn't have this body I'd be perfect
[50:27] my greatest battles come because of this
[50:33] hallelujah he says now remember there
[50:35] was a veil a veil that hang between the
[50:38] holy and the Holies of holy in the
[50:40] Holies of holy is where Christ comes to
[50:43] sit down on your hearts throne Christ is
[50:48] enthroned he come through justification
[50:51] sanctification and then bye-bye one
[50:54] church no by one creed no by one spirit
[50:58] from here we are baptized into one body
[51:02] which is the body of Christ hallelujah
[51:06] who comes in Methodist Baptist
[51:09] Presbyterian Pentecostal whosoever will
[51:14] meaning that this is for whosoever will
[51:17] and that means whosoever will ready to
[51:23] die is that right
[51:25] jesus said first of all in order to be
[51:28] my disciples you must take up your cross
[51:30] and follow me meaning you got to die
[51:34] daily in order to follow me hallelujah
[51:40] you know God is a God of variety and God
[51:44] just doesn't we can't program him and
[51:48] he's not going to allow us to program
[51:50] him God speaks the way he wants to speak
[51:53] sometimes he gives us witnesses oh I I
[51:57] know God showed me yeah and sometimes he
[52:00] doesn't hallelujah he does his own
[52:04] because let me say it God will never
[52:06] allow us to ever put him in a box you
[52:09] understand me it comes to a place that
[52:12] we must understand when the spirit leads
[52:15] you you must go in the way that the
[52:17] spirit leads hallelujah
[52:23] these senses that we have deceives us
[52:27] these sis's that we have sometimes
[52:30] becomes our very enemy the senses of our
[52:34] spirit and the senses of our flesh our
[52:38] eyesight the way we feel oh I don't
[52:41] think I like that that has nothing to do
[52:44] with it
[52:45] hallelujah because you do not have to
[52:48] like it in order for to be right
[52:53] hallelujah think about it when God Jesus
[52:57] himself had to go by the woman at the
[53:00] well hallelujah oh my he knew that if
[53:05] anybody would see him there
[53:06] there will be critics but he was willing
[53:10] because the Spirit of the Lord led him
[53:12] that way he said I have need to go by
[53:15] Samaria hallelujah and he went by
[53:18] Samaria and brother Branham picks it up
[53:20] he said his disciples were looking
[53:22] through the bushes like what in the
[53:24] world is he doing talking to that kind
[53:26] of a woman but you see when God leads
[53:30] you to do something you've got to do it
[53:32] and guess what God always put opposition
[53:36] he never makes it easy he always puts
[53:40] something in the way but that is a
[53:43] suicide that God wants you to do
[53:46] something that right he told Moses I
[53:50] want you to deliver the children
[53:52] hallelujah never told him that Janice
[53:55] and Jambres was going to be there to
[53:56] oppose him hallelujah never told him
[54:00] that Janice and Jambres weren't going to
[54:01] have serpents - never told him never
[54:05] told him that jealous and Jambres was
[54:07] going to be able to do it a lot of the
[54:08] signs and wonders that he did they were
[54:11] able to do everything Moses did except
[54:14] create love coming
[54:17] to that because I preached on the voice
[54:19] this morning I didn't get to preach it
[54:21] like I wanted to but I want you to
[54:23] understand this is why it is important
[54:26] to press on behind the video it's
[54:31] important because that is where you need
[54:34] the Shekinah glory hallelujah
[54:38] and that Shekinah glory lives because
[54:42] that is where God is hallelujah if you
[54:46] want to look like God act like God talk
[54:49] like God walk like God you smell like
[54:52] God you got to get behind the veil Oh
[54:57] somebody help me here
[54:59] you saw what are you trying to tell me
[55:01] brother brush your wheel is the thing
[55:06] that you have to battle every day in
[55:07] order to get behind the veil and stay
[55:11] there see sometimes you can go behind
[55:13] there and you forget and you come back
[55:16] out the prophet of God said you can go
[55:18] in and out but he says at some point in
[55:21] time you did get there and closed the
[55:24] door behind you now I come back out why
[55:27] because you want God to the living you
[55:31] listen oh let me hurry up let me hurry
[55:34] up with this because I want you to know
[55:37] Amen that veil but the velum said is
[55:41] called self will do you get it the
[55:43] picture now the sense is out there the
[55:46] senses on your body the senses of your
[55:48] soul and the veil between that and the
[55:50] Holies our place the Holies of Holies
[55:52] and the only way that you can get there
[55:54] is to have self will what whosoever will
[55:58] that means you must have a will to move
[56:02] up to faith you must have a will to move
[56:05] up to knowledge you must have a will you
[56:08] must be determined and all that God can
[56:12] make you determine but you must be
[56:15] determined hallelujah that's what makes
[56:18] it fire because fire is determined a
[56:21] mented to conquer everything in his path
[56:24] hallelujah somebody help me here you and
[56:27] I must understand by God's grace
[56:29] hallelujah
[56:30] a wheel it ain't about shaking hands
[56:33] it's not about immersion
[56:34] it's not about joining church it's not
[56:37] about passing out let us know sir
[56:39] whosoever will beyond the veil
[56:42] hallelujah if you willing to go beyond
[56:45] the veil hallelujah
[56:46] put on the harm of God fight your way
[56:50] all the way hallelujah glory to God is
[56:55] that right
[56:56] you got a fight don't let these look
[57:00] Wong Christians stop you hallelujah
[57:04] because every age must produce the word
[57:08] of prophecy the word has been spoken of
[57:11] the age must come to life it must live
[57:15] [Applause]
[57:16] God is summoning us the Bible says many
[57:19] are called but few are chosen
[57:21] is that right listening the revelation
[57:24] book of Revelation chapter 42 he said oh
[57:30] my when those books were open then you
[57:37] saw thousands upon thousands hallelujah
[57:42] and we know he said the sleeping virgins
[57:46] Oh can't you see that the sleep in
[57:49] church them that went out to meet the
[57:52] bridegroom they let the oil go out of
[57:55] their lamp
[57:56] never entered into this never let Christ
[58:02] take control so he could work miracles
[58:06] and speak with tongues and do wonders
[58:10] and things super brute to prove that he
[58:12] lived in the church they never let God
[58:15] take control and this is where we are
[58:18] fighting your will and God's will will
[58:21] you allow him to take full control God
[58:24] don't want part of you he wants all of
[58:26] you hallelujah help us Jesus is that
[58:33] Alright oh my I'm not gonna be long he
[58:38] said let Christ come to those senses say
[58:41] well I ought to I don't want to
[58:44] I don't like to go to hell see that's
[58:47] not right
[58:47] I want one thing I joined the church
[58:50] alright Luke well see tell you what I
[58:53] believe that I ought to live a different
[58:56] life what I can
[58:58] st. if I say vacation at the altar you
[59:01] see no no no no all right all those
[59:03] things alright
[59:04] but then whosoever will let him pass the
[59:07] ribbon veil o Lord of God I on the other
[59:11] side hallelujah to his name-o whosoever

[59:18] his own will you gotta tell the curtain
[59:25] of your own will your will your will
[59:29] will make you put you in a place and
[59:32] then that the Word of God don't even
[59:35] affect you anymore because you've harden
[59:38] your heart too many times may the
[59:42] foolish later lord have mercy upon us is
[59:45] that right we've got the conch of the
[59:47] flesh it's not something that we've
[59:49] never heard before but I believe this is
[59:52] the time and season that we must learn
[59:55] and we you can't get there without pray
[59:58] huh
[59:59] it doesn't matter Paul says listen you
[1:00:02] can understand all the mysteries in and
[1:00:03] that's what scares me because I see many
[1:00:06] of people everywhere I go they know the
[1:00:09] depth of the word but they ain't living
[1:00:11] nothing daddy ain't gonna work
[1:00:14] Marion's a people follow the Prophet

[1:00:54] kingdom if it kept Moses beast you know
[1:00:57] that
[1:00:58] children of Israel out of the promised
[1:01:00] land it would keep you out of the
[1:01:01] promised land there is no way that
[1:01:04] you're gonna get into the Holy Ghost
[1:01:05] complaining hallelujah it's like a man
[1:01:09] coming coming home and his wife has got
[1:01:12] a rollers in her head and all of this
[1:01:14] kind of stuff looking like she just woke
[1:01:16] up and got out of the bed and all she

[1:01:47] said honey what you won't that's a real
[1:01:49] man now I'm just trying to say this is
[1:01:53] what we do with God we constantly
[1:01:55] complain let me tell you something most
[1:02:00] of the time when people say I'm hungry
[1:02:02] they lie most people don't even know
[1:02:06] what hungry is we just need we say oh I
[1:02:08] desire to eat because hungry is when you
[1:02:11] haven't eaten in a few days anybody know
[1:02:13] what I'm talking about
[1:02:14] I know what that is his brother oh yeah
[1:02:20] that's what real hunger is you saw
[1:02:24] hungry if you drank water to hurt your
[1:02:26] stomach that that's what real hunger is

[1:02:31] can't ever what brother Brooks you've
[1:02:33] been no I know what that is and so is it
[1:02:35] with God listen is that right you and I
[1:02:38] must understand that what God is doing
[1:02:40] he's trying to get us to see that we
[1:02:43] must be the reflecting light of God in
[1:02:46] the church we must be if God is on the
[1:02:50] throne anybody no apple tree or anybody
[1:02:53] know what we look like you can't you
[1:02:56] can't deceive a man who knows what we is
[1:02:58] and what a kookabura is the man know the
[1:03:01] difference the nature of the tree is
[1:03:04] different is that right
[1:03:08] you know the difference we can't say we
[1:03:11] brought if there's no
[1:03:12] reflection of him what's the difference
[1:03:15] I preached a message years ago in
[1:03:20] imitation of life and and I dealt with
[1:03:23] the plastic flowers they do it they do
[1:03:26] it they work with the material now and
[1:03:28] the flowers look so real they look so
[1:03:30] real you got to touch him
[1:03:32] you ever seen a flower like that
[1:03:34] man-made flower and it looks so real it
[1:03:37] deceives your eye so well that you got
[1:03:40] to look go over there and touch him to
[1:03:42] make you see whether they real or not
[1:03:44] yeah that's how it is with churches but
[1:03:48] the difference between the make believer
[1:03:50] and that one that's imitating it can
[1:03:54] never reproduce y'all hear what I'm
[1:03:58] saying
[1:03:59] this message is supposed to reproduce we
[1:04:03] supposed to be bearing children unto the
[1:04:06] Lord is that right
[1:04:07] Eve was supposed to bring forth a
[1:04:10] meander the offspring of God New
[1:04:13] Jerusalem supposed to be the lover of
[1:04:15] the church and we are New Jerusalem but
[1:04:22] it's Christ in us you are now the
[1:04:26] sanctuary of God when God has been
[1:04:29] thrown himself in you but what we fail
[1:04:32] to see is that we've allowed Satan to
[1:04:34] deceive us with religion and so we get
[1:04:37] complacent within ourselves and think
[1:04:40] that oh by God's grace I'm gonna make it
[1:04:42] let me say it like this if you miss the
[1:04:46] rapture I said this this morning if you
[1:04:48] missed the rapture the day of mercy is
[1:04:51] over for you so this is not a time to
[1:04:53] play with God if you should miss the
[1:04:56] rapture you have to appear before the
[1:04:59] white throne judgment and you can scream
[1:05:01] and holler God mercy no mercy for you
[1:05:06] why because the blood is off the mercy
[1:05:10] seat hallelujah if you're not where you
[1:05:13] should be you and I we all should be
[1:05:15] crying out to God make me better Lord I
[1:05:18] want to be more like you help me be
[1:05:21] diligent lord
[1:05:23] that's my mind
[1:05:24] sharp so that when Satan comes to tell
[1:05:27] me
[1:05:28] I choose your will over mouth help us
[1:05:33] Lord hallelujah hallelujah we can't even
[1:05:37] afford to allow a bitter root of
[1:05:39] bitterness to be in us
[1:05:40] hallelujah god don't have space for
[1:05:43] selfishness Oh hallelujah the Holy Ghost
[1:05:47] amen as we approach that Holies of
[1:05:50] Holies and then you understand we're
[1:05:52] justified is that right but as we
[1:05:55] sanctify it that's that song become holy
[1:05:58] holy holy unto the it's the walk of the
[1:06:00] Christian is what we supposed to be
[1:06:03] doing every day I walk should be holy
[1:06:07] holy holy unto the Lord and as I think I
[1:06:12] brother Keith and I were talking Amen
[1:06:14] with God eyes become eyes his veil is
[1:06:18] the Holy Spirit and we see holiness
[1:06:21] we're seeing in itself and then won't
[1:06:25] touch us that's where I want to be I'm
[1:06:27] not saying I'm there but I press toward
[1:06:30] the mark like Paul say I'm gonna get
[1:06:33] there ain't nothin gonna stop me you
[1:06:36] gotta have that determination you gotta
[1:06:40] have that that mindset if I'm the only
[1:06:43] one hallelujah I'm gonna make it
[1:06:47] hallelujah is that right
[1:06:49] not through some Bishop not through
[1:06:51] nothin else but from the throne of God
[1:06:54] by our revelation of the power of his
[1:06:56] resurrection making him the same
[1:06:59] yesterday today and forever
[1:07:00] that's what Paul said I don't just want
[1:07:02] to know him in his suffering I want to
[1:07:04] know him in the power of his
[1:07:05] resurrection
[1:07:06] I want to know everything about the man
[1:07:08] I love and the man that I married
[1:07:12] hallelujah

[1:07:16] yesterday in the day forever
[1:07:18] what seven stars standing there
[1:07:22] reflecting that light there's a kind of
[1:07:25] light from the Shekinah glory from the
[1:07:28] Holies of holy seven lamps on fire
[1:07:31] sitting on top of these candlesticks
[1:07:33] reflecting his light his color and of
[1:07:36] his power and of his
[1:07:38] direction right into the church when I
[1:07:41] was thinking about the beautiful rainbow
[1:07:42] when I was thinking about what Christ
[1:07:44] did he did something
[1:07:46] it's amazing how Jesus was born in a
[1:07:51] manger but the bride was born on Calvary
[1:07:55] he gave birth to her on top of the
[1:08:00] mountain Oh hallelujah so in order you
[1:08:09] talking about birth pains you talk about
[1:08:11] birth pains he went through some birth
[1:08:14] pains hallelujah by the time he got up
[1:08:18] there to Calvary Amen by the time they
[1:08:20] crucified Him Amen even historian says
[1:08:23] he didn't even look like a man do you
[1:08:25] understand it he was so disfigured so
[1:08:29] large so beaten amen and who was it for
[1:08:32] you and I every lick he got you and I
[1:08:36] cause that he died for our sins you
[1:08:40] understand me
[1:08:42] thank the prophet of God said those old
[1:08:45] mothers out there when they were having
[1:08:47] birth they gave birth to those mothers
[1:08:49] and whatever name Amen they uttered out
[1:08:51] their mouth that's what they were called
[1:08:53] he from Manasseh and you know how you
[1:08:58] were born on Calvary when Jesus uttered
[1:09:02] the words will Father forgive them for
[1:09:04] they know not what they do and a true
[1:09:09] bride member has the ability to forgive
[1:09:13] somebody helped me hear your birth under
[1:09:17] forgiveness you understand forgiveness
[1:09:21] that's how the church went through is
[1:09:23] that right it showed it was all because
[1:09:26] when Stephen was being stoned to death
[1:09:28] he said Lord hold not these things in
[1:09:31] their charge you'll never see a real
[1:09:36] born again believer cursing Lord get
[1:09:42] that fella in her mouth is always
[1:09:46] forgive them she can't help it
[1:09:52] see she she's dare to her wheel it's not
[1:09:57] like it's not like Abel Abel wanted
[1:10:00] revenge
[1:10:01] his blood cried out revenge me avenge me
[1:10:06] it's like the Jews Lord how long and
[1:10:09] they only do that because the blood of
[1:10:11] Jesus Christ has not been applied
[1:10:13] hallelujah
[1:10:15] but when the real blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:17] is applied hallelujah the life of Christ
[1:10:19] comes upon you you act like him you love
[1:10:22] like him you forgive like him
[1:10:24] you are suffer like him and your whole
[1:10:27] being is about doing the Father's will
[1:10:37] is that okay the spirit and the bride
[1:10:41] say come
[1:10:42] it's a shame Lord forgive us Lord
[1:10:48] forgive us
[1:10:53] there's so much work to be done but self
[1:10:58] and self will it's clogged our minds on
[1:11:03] what we've been called to do we have a
[1:11:07] commission go ye out there you say old
[1:11:11] Brotherhood's well a harlot about it
[1:11:13] ain't your business but my sheep hears
[1:11:16] my voice if you go out there and God and
[1:11:19] use your voice to summons them hmm I
[1:11:24] have a need to go by Samaria is that
[1:11:27] right brother Branham was so caught up
[1:11:30] with God amen he walked off that plane
[1:11:32] and God said keep on walking I love that
[1:11:36] he didn't care about his next
[1:11:38] appointment oh I might mr. brain that
[1:11:41] thought came to his mind but he heard
[1:11:43] the voice of God said keep walking that
[1:11:47] wasn't just for profit people they that
[1:11:50] are led by the Spirit of God they are
[1:11:53] the sons of God how many of us would
[1:11:57] have stood on the corner God says go
[1:11:59] over there and stand on the corner this
[1:12:00] certain lady is gonna come by he stood
[1:12:03] there until
[1:12:05] she got there not five minutes not 10
[1:12:08] minutes but it was a time that she had
[1:12:11] to wait there we would say well you know
[1:12:14] perhaps that wasn't them maybe that
[1:12:15] wasn't God hmm
[1:12:18] we let our reasoning get in the way but
[1:12:21] my sheep hear with my voice is this okay
[1:12:25] I'm almost done I wasn't gonna be long
[1:12:27] but I want to get over to you tonight
[1:12:29] that the divorce of God amen who talked
[1:12:35] to Joshua how many y'all God talks to
[1:12:39] you he talks to me I'm serving the
[1:12:43] Living God he talks to me and I talk to
[1:12:47] him
[1:12:47] if your God is not talking to you you
[1:12:50] better check it out somewhere it means
[1:12:53] something is wrong because God will talk
[1:12:57] to you he summons you when he wants you
[1:13:02] to do things he tells you what to do he
[1:13:05] doesn't leave you wondering but that
[1:13:07] comes through praying and fasting that
[1:13:10] comes to a place where you have become
[1:13:12] your relationship has become intimate
[1:13:14] with God I'm a close in just a moment as
[1:13:18] I said you do not have to be a
[1:13:22] well-known person in order for God to
[1:13:25] use you I talked about the young lady
[1:13:27] that that that led name until Elijah and
[1:13:32] what about that old Shunammite woman huh
[1:13:35] she was summons and listened God took
[1:13:39] Elijah to her she was about ready to die
[1:13:42] she and her sons but it was her
[1:13:45] appointed time for salvation y'all hear
[1:13:49] me and when it's your time for salvation
[1:13:52] or to move up the ladder she was a
[1:13:53] believer already she was ready to die
[1:13:55] she was willing to die but every time
[1:13:58] you know I used this particular story
[1:14:01] because for some reason when I thought
[1:14:04] about the shunammite woman in my earlier
[1:14:07] days I thought she's a big momma
[1:14:10] you know I thought you know she nothing
[1:14:13] I didn't realize that she was really
[1:14:15] starving
[1:14:16] for some reason it wasn't clicking my
[1:14:18] mind
[1:14:18] but you got to understand these people
[1:14:20] probably was so thin in their appearance
[1:14:24] because she said we're gonna eat this
[1:14:26] last meal and we're going to die that
[1:14:29] means they have been starving for a long
[1:14:32] time you understand me so you can
[1:14:35] understand the whole pitch of this thing
[1:14:37] that's what God will do he'll come at a
[1:14:41] time when you think you all in control
[1:14:44] and he'll ask you for your last huh oh
[1:14:50] he said to Abraham sacrifice Isaac here
[1:14:56] take the thing that means so much to you
[1:14:59] and we want to see whether you gonna
[1:15:02] give it to him the thing that is most
[1:15:06] important is the kind of thing that God
[1:15:08] will ask for what's more valuable to you
[1:15:12] than anything other than your will and
[1:15:14] God say kill it you got to give that up
[1:15:18] in order to go my way whoo and guess
[1:15:22] what here it was like I said God takes
[1:15:25] this woman give me give make my cake
[1:15:28] first and and I don't know like I said
[1:15:33] he works on both ends
[1:15:34] cuz had not he worked with that
[1:15:36] Shunammite woman it would have been some
[1:15:38] trouble but God worked on both ends she
[1:15:42] perceived that this was a man of God and
[1:15:44] I better go do what he says do right now
[1:15:48] think about wheel nothing to say
[1:15:50] something here and I may have got you
[1:15:52] the shoot of my woman and the other lady
[1:15:54] big stuff but anyway my point is even
[1:15:56] when Elijah had given this woman a son
[1:16:00] she was determined right they sent all
[1:16:05] of the trinket self of the Prophet to
[1:16:08] her laid this on the bed laid that on
[1:16:10] the bed but no she wanted the real thing
[1:16:13] and she told her servant don't you stop
[1:16:16] you see what I'm saying till I get to
[1:16:19] the Prophet now let me bring this to you
[1:16:22] don't you stop til you get to the
[1:16:25] Prophet you understand me
[1:16:28] you don't stop to you coming to a full
[1:16:31] statue of Christ
[1:16:32] you can't play with it you can't come to
[1:16:34] a place and I'm saying these things
[1:16:36] because there are times in my life I've
[1:16:38] got laxed yeah I've got laxed but now
[1:16:43] God is saying this is not a time to be
[1:16:46] latch redeem your time hurry like the
[1:16:52] brother sent me and I had seen that
[1:16:54] earlier they said it's 100 seconds to
[1:16:57] midnight because of the global warming
[1:17:00] the atomic bombs diseases just like that
[1:17:05] that new disease in China you know a
[1:17:08] brother called me said don't you know
[1:17:09] they lying to us then shutting down no
[1:17:12] country because 50 or 60 people he said
[1:17:16] there have been over 7,000 people that
[1:17:18] have died about this flu and to know
[1:17:21] that that virus is now in America is
[1:17:24] that right oh don't be afraid brother
[1:17:28] branham said it like this he said you
[1:17:29] know there going to be a disease that
[1:17:31] will eat you while you are alive and the
[1:17:34] only way that you'll be able to escape
[1:17:36] this is that you have the sealing of the
[1:17:38] Holy Ghost that's how close we are
[1:17:42] they're developing all of these germs
[1:17:44] and diseases and there's a warfare
[1:17:47] people because we got too many people
[1:17:49] and they don't know how to kill us off
[1:17:51] without destroying the world what we
[1:17:57] going to do when I see the blood I'll
[1:18:00] pass over you that's it it can't be a
[1:18:04] figment of our imagination we must have
[1:18:07] it living reality in our lives is that
[1:18:10] right hallelujah let me let me say it
[1:18:13] like this
[1:18:14] in closing when God created us he knew
[1:18:24] exactly where we would be at whatever
[1:18:28] time God has never lost track on where
[1:18:33] you are he doesn't have to turn over
[1:18:35] leaves and look through a box or some
[1:18:39] trash bag even though we were there God
[1:18:43] knows exactly where we
[1:18:46] and when he gets to calling you right
[1:18:52] that means when God calls you never
[1:18:55] gonna understand I know it because it
[1:18:59] was Peters his Lord we don't left
[1:19:02] everything we don't left our mothers our
[1:19:05] fathers our sisters our brothers
[1:19:06] everything lot we don't have nothing
[1:19:08] left now what are we gonna get in return
[1:19:11] then I almost sound like a selfish but
[1:19:14] if it had been self as Jesus would have
[1:19:16] rebuked him but he didn't he says no I
[1:19:18] don't give it to you I'm gonna give all
[1:19:21] this to you plus some troubles with it
[1:19:25] yeah you want to know what you're gonna
[1:19:27] get because this is a place where I have
[1:19:31] chosen to perfect you you understand me
[1:19:34] when we get on the other side all of
[1:19:38] this will never be seen again
[1:19:41] no this flesh that we're now living in
[1:19:44] won't be so everything that's fallen
[1:19:47] will dissipate and disappear go back to
[1:19:51] where it used to be I can't imagine it
[1:19:54] but I know it's true and the thing that
[1:19:58] people will lose heaven because they
[1:20:02] didn't want to lose their will ain't
[1:20:06] nobody gonna control me but let me tell
[1:20:10] you something God is too here to Christ
[1:20:13] and Christ is the head of the church and
[1:20:15] the woman ain't the head of nothin that
[1:20:20] sounds rough but that's the way it works
[1:20:24] Christ is our head and we are his bride
[1:20:28] and we must submit to his word mm well
[1:20:36] my wife knows she loves me but my point
[1:20:41] is faint saints of God I know I screamed
[1:20:45] it out because my voice is kind of going
[1:20:46] but I won't I'm just trying to tell you
[1:20:48] in just short short little message help
[1:20:53] us Lord that when we say Lord my will
[1:20:57] die and be done
[1:20:58] we mean it from the deaths of our heart
[1:21:01] because it is the heart cries that God
[1:21:04] hears he doesn't care about intellectual
[1:21:07] prayers or intellectual dis and I'm just
[1:21:10] saying that to myself because sometimes
[1:21:12] you just know what to say sometimes you
[1:21:14] figure if I say it like this it's going
[1:21:17] to work no it doesn't work that way
[1:21:19] what comes from the heart touches the
[1:21:21] heart hallelujah every prayer everything
[1:21:24] we do must be done in the spirit has to
[1:21:28] be if it's not done in the spirit it's
[1:21:30] not acceptable before God hallelujah and
[1:21:34] so we you and I must understand that it
[1:21:37] is important people say people and and I
[1:21:39] am closing because I said lord I don't
[1:21:43] know about you maybe I'm losing my mind
[1:21:46] which would be a good thing to do but I
[1:21:51] believe this message I got a sneeze
[1:21:56] sorry I believe this message and I
[1:22:02] believe everything God said happened you
[1:22:08] know Jesus spoken up over eight hundred
[1:22:10] years before he came up when he came he
[1:22:13] fit the scripture think about Ezekiel
[1:22:17] Ezekiel salt twenty-four Thrones but he
[1:22:21] didn't see the people in the phones but
[1:22:24] then John is caught up into Revelation
[1:22:26] caught up into a different time caught
[1:22:28] up into this day after the rapture and
[1:22:30] he sees 24 elders but though thought
[1:22:34] those wrongs were created for them they
[1:22:37] sitting on those Thrones right now
[1:22:40] nothing could alter that God wasn't
[1:22:43] going to go back and erase the names on
[1:22:45] the seats hallelujah
[1:22:48] you understand me and so is it with the
[1:22:51] bride of Jesus Christ and God when he
[1:22:53] called those elders those patriarchs did
[1:22:56] you know and we know this this is why we
[1:22:58] must come to that perfection because we
[1:23:02] are the judge
[1:23:03] we are the judge with Christ hallelujah
[1:23:08] we're the ones amen that white robes
[1:23:10] just doesn't mean
[1:23:12] and clean white rose is also symbolic of
[1:23:15] being a judge and so God will have us
[1:23:20] judging well and then those twelve
[1:23:24] tribes did twelve elders did you know
[1:23:27] they would be the ones judging the
[1:23:28] twelve tribes hallelujah the Jews as
[1:23:33] great as they were and our will be in
[1:23:36] the outer Court there'll be the guard
[1:23:39] the temple guards and here we are the
[1:23:42] bride so how can we come up short he's
[1:23:47] not gonna let us come up short and one
[1:23:50] thing I know about God he loves if you
[1:23:52] were sheep you want to be loud and not
[1:23:55] driven I want God to lead me in the
[1:24:00] paths of righteousness for his namesake
[1:24:02] whatever it takes you know and and
[1:24:07] understand in order to get where we need
[1:24:10] to go there's a lot of suffering ahead
[1:24:14] people want to follow Christ but they
[1:24:16] don't want to suffer but just like
[1:24:18] brother Branham said and I'll say it
[1:24:19] just like him I want some battle scars I
[1:24:23] don't want to get up there and be clean
[1:24:26] so clean I ain't got one scar nothing to
[1:24:28] show that I've been in a battle yes
[1:24:31] battles they hurt it's rough sometimes
[1:24:34] you seem like you're standing by
[1:24:36] yourself but staying anyhow fight the
[1:24:38] good fight of faith and I don't say like
[1:24:40] this don't be a shame of this gospel
[1:24:44] when you preach Jesus you preach it the
[1:24:48] whole book is that right he's the
[1:24:53] prophet of all prophets
[1:24:54] he's the fulfillment of all prophets
[1:24:57] hallelujah like I try to tell people I
[1:25:00] said understand this and I know it's a
[1:25:03] fine line but I don't even be looking
[1:25:07] for stuff and brother and the Lord will
[1:25:10] show me something that even the Prophet
[1:25:12] says that makes me stand even more
[1:25:16] firmer on what I believe and that is I'm
[1:25:20] gonna always worship Jesus Christ in a
[1:25:24] pure way
[1:25:25] you understand me God is in me God is in
[1:25:30] you crisis and me Christ is in you is
[1:25:34] that right a member who gets the glory
[1:25:37] when somebody's healed who gets the
[1:25:41] glory when somebody's delivered you
[1:25:44] understand me
[1:25:45] who gets the glory if you get the glory
[1:25:47] then you are wrong and if you allow
[1:25:51] people to give you the glory
[1:25:54] Paul said I ain't died for none of y'all
[1:25:58] don't baptized in my name hmm I didn't
[1:26:03] do that
[1:26:04] I only know one that did that and that's
[1:26:06] Jesus Christ what happened it wasn't
[1:26:09] that the glory of God wasn't on him he
[1:26:11] was in the Shekinah he did mighty works
[1:26:14] but he said I don't know nothing among
[1:26:16] you save Jesus Christ and him crucified
[1:26:18] I don't know I don't even know how come
[1:26:23] I have to keep saying this but I'm gonna
[1:26:25] tell you something I know what I'm
[1:26:26] working with the cause in my opinion
[1:26:30] just a small little change to make a
[1:26:36] vast difference
[1:26:41] the Bible said even in the last days
[1:26:44] they were worship the creature more than
[1:26:47] the Creator less there may be I'm going
[1:26:57] fanatical I don't know but I know if
[1:27:00] we're gonna have a revival Jesus Christ
[1:27:03] must be restored among us in such a way
[1:27:07] that the world would see that he's the
[1:27:12] same yesterday today and forever
[1:27:14] God must live to us this is not religion
[1:27:18] this is salvation this is what what God
[1:27:20] has ordained us to be word about word
[1:27:24] upon word on word expression expressed
[1:27:31] God
[1:27:33] and you
[1:27:37] Amazing Grace will always be my song the
