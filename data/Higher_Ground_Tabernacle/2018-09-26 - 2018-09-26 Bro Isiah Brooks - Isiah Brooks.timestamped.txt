[2:01] fruit of his creatures amen
[2:07] first Peter
[2:15] first chapter beginning at the 20th
[2:21] verse who verily was foreordained before
[2:30] the foundation of the world but it was
[2:33] manifested in these last times for you
[2:36] who by him do believe in God that raised
[2:40] him up from the dead and gave him glory
[2:43] that your faith and hope might be in God
[2:47] seeing you have purified your souls and
[2:50] obeying the truth through the spirit
[2:53] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren
[2:55] seeing that you love one another with a
[2:58] pure heart fervently being a born again
[3:03] not of corruptible seed but
[3:05] incorruptible by the Word of God which
[3:09] liveth and abideth for ever for all
[3:12] flesh is as grass and all the glory of
[3:15] man as the flower of grass the grass
[3:18] withereth and the flower thereof falleth
[3:20] away but the word of the Lord and do it
[3:24] forever and this is the word which the
[3:27] gospel is preached unto you let us pray
[3:31] I dear Heavenly Father we so thank you
[3:35] for your grace and your mercy we thank
[3:39] you for being so good to us
[3:41] we pray Lord God this evening that you
[3:45] would minister to our hearts forgive us
[3:48] of all our sins and our shortcomings we
[3:51] pray father God that your word be
[3:53] exalted above all things and we pray
[3:57] right now Lord God that you bless this
[3:58] assembly in a special way in Jesus
[4:02] Christ's name we pray amen
[4:04] you may be seated
[4:10] I like to just talk tonight on just a
[4:13] simple word called faith a lot of times
[4:17] we look at faith in so many ways
[4:21] sometimes faith is confused with hope
[4:26] and as we say sometimes when hope is
[4:30] present or being used as something that
[4:33] we put on our victory in a distance as
[4:38] opposing to I hope we're not certain of
[4:42] it's not a certainty but when it comes
[4:45] to faith faith is a certainty because
[4:48] the Bible said now faith is faith is not
[4:52] just a thing it is a substance it is
[4:55] something that is unseen to the naked
[4:59] eye but visible by by the effects of it
[5:05] when we talk about faith we talk about
[5:10] something that has been given by God
[5:12] because all men don't have faith faith
[5:16] in itself is a gift come from God when
[5:19] we think about faith faith is the that
[5:23] ability to take the unseen and make it
[5:27] visible all that we see here today our
[5:31] lights our chairs our automobiles
[5:33] everything that we we now can touch and
[5:36] see has a products of somebody's faith
[5:40] faith in itself has been given by God
[5:43] when we talk about all the achievements
[5:46] of man and how far we have come in the
[5:51] scientific world we understand that this
[5:54] world this scientific world could only
[5:57] be achieved by somebody's faith God
[6:00] gives him him for inspiration
[6:01] inspiration began to move in a vision
[6:05] and the vision in itself become
[6:07] materialized often time when we deal
[6:10] with this kind of a thing we know that
[6:13] everybody don't get the vision like we
[6:15] get it I mean you take for an example
[6:18] when it came to Noah Noah had a vision
[6:20] he had an inspiration he heard from the
[6:23] unseen
[6:24] and but but because he believed but
[6:28] because and because he knew that it it
[6:30] was it was God a man he moved in fear
[6:33] and the Bible said he prepared an ark
[6:35] and because of his vision eight souls
[6:39] were saved but as you can see that many
[6:42] people in his day didn't believe because
[6:45] you and I don't even know the racial of
[6:46] people that really died in that flood
[6:49] understanding when the flood took place
[6:51] the world in itself was one land you
[6:54] know it was after the flood the land
[6:56] began was divided so we don't have we
[6:59] have no idea how massive the land was
[7:02] but how big a however big it was
[7:04] somebody had a vision and we call that
[7:07] faith it is something that God gave he
[7:11] didn't deserve it the Bible doesn't say
[7:13] that he was such a great man that that
[7:17] God but God did a work we realize it was
[7:23] God's favor God I did a thing and it was
[7:26] called favor he it's because it was all
[7:31] about his will I'm taking my time
[7:34] but you know I realized by God's grace
[7:36] that it is something that you and I must
[7:39] understand our whole salvation rest upon
[7:43] our faith uh you say I'm elected how do
[7:48] you know you elected you say I'm chosen
[7:51] how do you know that your chosen faith
[7:55] has been revealed to you it is something
[7:57] that God gave you and has given you
[8:00] nobody can take it from you
[8:02] even if no one else can see it you can
[8:05] see it and this is what faith is faith
[8:08] is that thing that you see before you
[8:11] see it you see it before you see it
[8:16] Amen like Abraham he called those things
[8:19] that be not as though they were because
[8:22] he was able to see it before it
[8:25] materialized before it manifested itself
[8:28] as I said it is a gift faith is a good
[8:32] gift and the Bible said every good and
[8:34] perfect gift come from above
[8:37] so it's given to us by God even if you
[8:42] don't have faith in yourself it will it
[8:44] would determine what kind of a person
[8:46] you would be in this life you must have
[8:48] faith in yourself and when I say that
[8:52] I'm working with a Christian because we
[8:54] understand that the faith that we have
[8:56] in ourselves is the faith in God we can
[8:59] achieve all things is that right Paul
[9:02] said that we're more than conquerors
[9:03] through Christ Jesus now you have to
[9:06] have faith for that to operate in you
[9:09] even though it's in the scripture that
[9:11] God doesn't quicken that to you
[9:13] if he doesn't inspire you by that word
[9:16] amen you can never have faith in it
[9:18] but once that faith comes and once you
[9:21] in you realize that that scripture is a
[9:23] given vision to you by God you can
[9:27] conquer any and everything is that
[9:30] Alright first Peter who says who
[9:32] verily was ordained before the
[9:34] Foundation's world but was manifested in
[9:37] these last times for you who by him do
[9:40] believe in God that raised him up from
[9:43] the dead and gave him glory that your
[9:45] faith and hope might be in who God amen
[9:50] so you must realize amen that it is
[9:52] because of God you have faith and God
[9:55] has given you faith to have faith in God
[9:57] there is there's no other way you can
[10:01] can achieve this goal with that without
[10:04] God
[10:05] that's why the Bible said that when God
[10:07] when the word is preached all cannot
[10:10] believe because all do not have faith
[10:13] there are men who are deign to never
[10:16] have faith because of who they are and
[10:19] what they are they can't have a rep they
[10:23] can't have a revelation of God no more
[10:26] than Cain could have a revelation of God
[10:28] right Cain in his mental capacity
[10:32] understood he was God but listen once
[10:35] you have a true revelation of God you
[10:37] fear God it is only those who don't have
[10:41] a true revelation of God they are the
[10:46] only ones that don't fear God they're
[10:48] the ones that can accuse God there
[10:51] ones who said God doesn't exist they're
[10:53] the ones that yes sir oh i'm just angry
[10:55] with god see you don't have a real
[10:58] revelation of god when you do such
[11:03] things as that i've seen one by the name
[11:08] of Jonah and I often have wonder how
[11:11] Jonah could get such an attitude with
[11:13] God but he did and but you know it
[11:17] doesn't mean that you're not of God
[11:19] because you have an attitude but you
[11:21] haven't come to that revelation of who
[11:24] he really is
[11:26] you understand me so God even took Jonah
[11:30] Jonah went to preach for God at Nineveh
[11:33] but Jonah had a lot of things he need to
[11:35] come to know and understand himself and
[11:37] through this trial he became he
[11:40] understood who God was and at the end of
[11:42] the day Jonah
[11:45] name was put in the a feint a book a
[11:50] hall Hall of Fame a minute I'm sorry
[11:53] folks I'm just a little tired but I'll
[11:55] be all right
[11:55] God is here with me amen you understand
[11:59] the Bible goes on and says seeing you
[12:01] have purified your souls in obeying the
[12:03] truth through the spirit of unfailing
[12:06] love of the Brethren seeing that you
[12:08] love one another with a pure heart
[12:10] fervently don't you know that's faith in
[12:13] action
[12:14] you can't even love somebody without
[12:17] faith faith and love are twins they go
[12:21] together you can't even believe in God
[12:23] without love
[12:25] hello that's what makes your faith in
[12:29] believing that he is God gods ha ha ha
[12:32] the scripture go we love Him because He
[12:34] first amen
[12:37] is that right so it all works together
[12:41] amen so that we can understand it now
[12:47] how many of us believe that we were born
[12:50] again if you believe that you're born
[12:54] again that means what the seed in which
[12:58] you were born is incorruptible
[13:03] I want you to think about that the seed
[13:06] in which you were born in is
[13:10] incorruptible it can't grow oh it can't
[13:15] be defiled it can't cannot come up short
[13:19] it's going to produce the potential of
[13:23] the seed it will manifest itself in your
[13:27] day y'all understand me so what are you
[13:30] saying the incorruptible seed is Jesus
[13:32] Christ Christ in you the hope of glory
[13:36] so when we think about that you've got
[13:39] to believe it I am perfect oh my god
[13:44] yes you are perfect if the seed of God
[13:48] is in you and it has been quickened you
[13:51] are perfect no death or hell can stop
[13:56] you from reaching your goal hallelujah
[14:00] is that right
[14:02] often time we think the ability to to uh
[14:06] that's it like that we think them but
[14:09] the ability to produce Christ is in our
[14:13] efforts in her own doings and that's
[14:18] where God had the Jews in law because he
[14:22] put that log there and he told him you
[14:25] must do everything every one of these
[14:28] words must be fulfilled in your life in
[14:30] order for you to be perfect they never
[14:33] reach the goal they all stumbled they
[14:37] all fail they all came short of the
[14:40] glory of God it is only now where the
[14:44] seat of God is quicken that you and I
[14:47] can come to the perfection in which God
[14:50] has ordained for us to come to and that
[14:53] itself is by faith it is a revelation
[14:56] that I have been created to be made
[15:00] perfect perfectly in the image and
[15:03] likeness of God it is a revelation is
[15:07] that right you see because it no science
[15:11] can explain faith faith cannot be
[15:13] explained by science I don't care
[15:16] now they tried to categorize it and
[15:19] break it down and faith is a dimensional
[15:23] term it is something that is from
[15:26] another dimension and you say well what
[15:29] do you mean because before the world was
[15:32] formed the Bible says by faith so faith
[15:35] existed before the worlds were formed it
[15:39] was by faith the world was formed you
[15:42] understand me
[15:43] so by faith it's not like God got an
[15:46] instrument called faith God if there be
[15:49] a instrument it is God God Himself is
[15:53] what we call faith it is the only thing
[15:56] that there's no such thing as a perfect
[15:58] faith without it being God's faith the
[16:01] just shall live by his faith not yours
[16:04] that is why we need the quickening we
[16:07] need the Holy Ghost we need God amen
[16:10] living in us to produce his word
[16:13] otherwise it won't be produced
[16:17] even though Mary Mary
[16:19] amen was a virgin she wasn't the only
[16:22] virgin but she was the chosen version
[16:25] she was the one that was elected and I
[16:29] really believe that when God came to
[16:31] Mary she said well how can this thing be
[16:33] that was that human reasoning that was
[16:35] that way we we think how can I be dry or
[16:39] how can I make a translation or how can
[16:41] I ever be perfect it ain't up to you
[16:44] know it ain't up is nothing not up to
[16:47] you no more like Michael Mary it wasn't
[16:50] up to Mary Mary was already chosen God
[16:53] knew already he knew he already knew her
[16:56] response hallelujah and after she
[17:00] questioned he didn't say don't you worry
[17:03] about me about this Mary the Holy Ghost
[17:05] will overshadow you how was she able to
[17:09] perform the act is because the Holy
[17:11] Ghost over shadow how are you going to
[17:13] reach perfection the Holy Ghost over
[17:16] shattering a man he does that you are a
[17:19] creation a new creation just like Jesus
[17:22] Christ Himself was a creation and so are
[17:26] you and the only way will
[17:30] ever come to a full potential is by the
[17:32] holy ghost even though the body was made
[17:35] of Jesus even though he was a son he did
[17:38] things at the age of 12 but it was unto
[17:41] the age of 30 where the fullness of the
[17:44] Godhead bodily dwelt in him is that
[17:48] right why because he could not take on
[17:51] the devil just as he was he needed power
[17:57] he needed taught y'all hear me the word
[18:01] that was once letter had to be quickened
[18:03] to life hallelujah we think faith faith
[18:09] is like a trust in God and people they
[18:12] say Christianity is is made of that kind
[18:15] of faith you know in in in which we
[18:18] trust in God and in his promises and
[18:21] things like that but it goes beyond that
[18:24] because faith was introduced before
[18:27] there was any scripture written God came
[18:32] to Adam and Adam told him listen this is
[18:34] all you got out here right you can eat
[18:37] you can eat of all the trees but you not
[18:39] eat of the tree of good and not is a
[18:40] good evil at that point in time he had
[18:45] faith he never lost faith hello Adam
[18:50] wasn't deceived you understand me he
[18:54] didn't he'd never disbelieved the god
[18:56] word of God he walked out knowing he was
[19:01] breaking the word it wasn't his unbelief
[19:06] hello
[19:07] he knew he was deceived she broke it but
[19:12] when Adam walked out he knew he was
[19:15] breaking the word but he also understood
[19:17] the only way that he could save II was
[19:19] to do this he knew God meant what he
[19:27] said and said what he meant and he knew
[19:31] that God said the day you eat of this
[19:33] tree you should surely die so you got to
[19:35] understand that he willfully placed
[19:38] himself under the the authority of death
[19:44] he died for his wife by faith now I
[19:50] don't know what went on into our on the
[19:52] mind and heart of Adam but somehow Adam
[19:56] must have known God was gonna work it
[19:59] out cuz God had already given him the
[20:05] authority the word be fruitful and
[20:08] multiply so if he was to die he could
[20:12] not cook the commission would be done
[20:14] not lost so somewhere had a knew he did
[20:18] maybe didn't understand I don't know but
[20:20] he knew like they say that word is that
[20:29] word is not maybe but perhaps God you
[20:32] know how is it you know maybe there is a
[20:35] chance you know that thing is maybe
[20:38] there is a chance you know and that's
[20:40] how we work with God sometimes because
[20:42] we know him so well we think this word
[20:47] is maybe there is a possibility and with
[20:52] that thought in your mind that there is
[20:54] a possibility that I that God can keep
[20:57] this thing moving even though I've done
[21:00] wrong God keeps it moving
[21:02] and sure enough God did now we look at
[21:06] the scripture and we think about it what
[21:08] the Bible tells us now we're not under
[21:10] law the only law we are under is the law
[21:14] of life and that's God and that law in
[21:18] itself produces life in itself it is
[21:22] life it is God living in human vessels
[21:26] but God being that it was separated he
[21:29] calls law showing that there was no way
[21:31] that you and I could ever achieve the
[21:34] gold that he intended us for us to
[21:36] achieve but because of his death he
[21:38] binded up the breach he brought he did
[21:41] you know that even Jesus Christ himself
[21:44] had to have faith in his own word it was
[21:48] a revelation
[21:49] it was y'all hear me it was a revelation
[21:52] because let me say it like this perhaps
[21:55] there was a time and we
[21:57] heard this before that that when the
[22:01] devil tempted Jesus he he didn't fully
[22:05] understand or fully understand you know
[22:08] it was the devil but the thing that
[22:11] caught his attention was that was when
[22:14] the devil says I'll give you all of this
[22:20] if you bow that's when he called him
[22:24] Satan get behind me
[22:27] see when you trot when you're going
[22:31] through try us sometime negative things
[22:33] come to your mind and you're questioning
[22:35] it you know you're not certain as it is
[22:37] of God but one thing I know about the
[22:40] devil he always wants you to bow he
[22:45] wants you to bow to his authority and
[22:50] whenever Satan comes with that then you
[22:52] know that's the devil and that's when
[22:56] Jesus says no no no no Satan this is the
[22:59] deal you only worship the Lord your God
[23:01] and him only right so we realize Amen
[23:06] that when we come about faith how we
[23:08] must understand that's why we can't run
[23:10] after all of these things that that that
[23:13] are images that are set up above the
[23:17] word I don't care if his message people
[23:20] doing it
[23:20] Israel did things but because they did
[23:23] it it didn't make it right they bowed to
[23:27] bail and bouton boat Moloch and all
[23:30] these other items but those idols but
[23:33] those Christians who had a faith who had
[23:36] a revelation that there was only one God
[23:39] that God was Jehovah or that God was
[23:43] Elohim even they understood all these
[23:46] other little idols meant nothing they
[23:49] couldn't speak they couldn't hear they
[23:51] couldn't help they were dumb idols made
[23:54] up and created by man right but their
[23:58] faith even though they couldn't see God
[24:00] they saw God hallelujah and you and I
[24:04] ought to be able had to have a faith in
[24:06] God that can see God every day Oh
[24:11] therefore faith you can understand that
[24:14] that's why it's so important the Bible
[24:17] said Abraham was justified by justified
[24:19] by faith is that right he believed God
[24:23] he was in a land of idols but we need
[24:26] heard the voice of God it became a
[24:28] revelation that the god of heaven is the
[24:31] god of the God that can talk even though
[24:35] he had never seen him as of yet he
[24:37] understood that this God has to be God
[24:40] because he's the only one that's ever
[24:42] talked to me hallelujah and Abraham was
[24:47] not even circumcised yet
[24:50] hello so let me tell you some people say
[24:52] well you know God though here sinner's
[24:54] prayer I understand what that means but
[24:58] when it comes to a real seed of God God
[25:01] will hear your prayer Abraham wasn't
[25:07] circumcised let me say that again
[25:08] Abraham was not even circumcised and God
[25:11] talked to me hello people what God talk
[25:15] to me and I I know I know I'm saying
[25:17] what God talked to the serpent God
[25:23] talked to Judas did he not but that
[25:26] didn't make him seed it was the faith
[25:30] that Abraham had him in the garden spoke
[25:34] to him
[25:34] the Bible said abraham believed God and
[25:37] because he believed him it was counted
[25:39] to him as righteousness
[25:40] I believe I'm ordained to make a rapture
[25:45] I believe this because of the word who
[25:48] has sanctified me has cleared me and my
[25:51] certification is not of me it's of him
[25:54] my righteousness is not on me it's of
[25:57] him can you see it brother books
[26:02] sometimes but I know one thing that my
[26:07] life is here in here so as long as I'm
[26:10] looking at his life I'm perfect
[26:14] hallelujah is that right one thing about
[26:17] faith faith never gives up brother and
[26:20] says is like a man with muscles hair on
[26:23] his chest
[26:24] he never gives up not even death can
[26:29] strip you of faith the Bible tells us in
[26:33] Hebrew 11 that all the Saints that died
[26:36] they died in faith they had a promise
[26:39] even though the promise had not been
[26:41] fulfilled in their day it never made
[26:43] them doubt they even went to the grave
[26:46] believing God was going to do it and
[26:49] because they believed God when Jesus
[26:51] rose up from the grave their faith
[26:54] poured Jesus to them or they understand
[26:57] me he could not leave them in the grave
[27:00] because they believed that one day he
[27:04] was coming back for them so faint it's a
[27:09] powerful tool it's something that God
[27:11] gave you feyza i need more faith faith
[27:14] comes by hearing hearing the Word of God
[27:17] is that right
[27:19] how you gonna have more faith if you
[27:21] don't read how you gonna have more faith
[27:23] if the Word of God is not preached to
[27:25] you people don't come to church like
[27:26] they shoes how are you gonna have faith
[27:28] because it is bad at the preaching of
[27:31] the word when the world is quickened to
[27:34] your heart
[27:34] I don't know how God works it all I know
[27:38] is with as many of us here he's feeding
[27:40] every one of us at the same time
[27:43] hallelujah with the same bread but
[27:46] leading different needs only God can do
[27:50] that the faith is the kind that could
[27:55] believe against hope you know when hope
[27:56] is there is no hope no hope Abraham God
[27:59] waited to Abraham was dead because
[28:02] before Abraham didn't half he didn't
[28:05] have to struggle he was able to produce
[28:07] her Ishmael right but when the ability
[28:11] of him producing anything was taken away
[28:13] from him and God said you gonna have a
[28:16] son that's when Abraham left he I'll
[28:21] know that Abraham left just like Sarah
[28:23] did Sarah was already dead but Abraham
[28:27] wasn't so it's easier to have faith when
[28:31] you still got a little substance you
[28:34] understand me but when God takes that
[28:36] from you
[28:38] when it looks like all hope is gone when
[28:41] it looks like a Lazarus situation that's
[28:45] when faith comes in he comes he comes in
[28:48] like the hero say what you want to say I
[28:51] know my redeemer live y'all understand
[28:55] me and so God brings us into a place
[28:58] where when everybody's saying is
[29:01] impossible to happen you says but God
[29:04] said it will Abraham
[29:07] you've gone 20 years 25 years and you
[29:10] haven't had a baby I don't care I still
[29:12] have faith Wow because God said so see
[29:16] it goes off the word if he's off the
[29:20] word it is the word and then that gives
[29:22] faith strength hmm when faith gives the
[29:28] word strength so but so the Bible tells
[29:32] us that Abraham staggered not at the
[29:35] promise of God through unbelief but was
[29:38] strong in faith giving glory to God but
[29:42] he left hello he left the Bible said you
[29:48] know there was nothing found wrong
[29:49] Abraham didn't do no wrong but he did
[29:52] but she after going underneath the blood
[29:56] of Jesus Christ all those things he did
[30:00] back then in the Old Testament was
[30:02] thrown out somewhere in the sea of
[30:04] forgetfulness so when they were getting
[30:06] to write about Abraham according to the
[30:09] Holy Spirit Abraham was a perfect
[30:12] example hello
[30:15] you saw a brother I don't know about
[30:17] that it's the same with you look how
[30:19] many mistakes you've made and though you
[30:22] believe God you still stumble there's
[30:26] still things amen that distract you just
[30:28] like a distracted Abraham hallelujah but
[30:31] at the end of the day it's like any
[30:35] bitchu area when they began to read
[30:36] about you they read about all the good
[30:39] things they don't never mention how bad
[30:41] we were everybody when they die in the
[30:44] obituaries they write like they were
[30:46] angels
[30:49] Wow because it's a thing you always want
[30:52] to know and see the good in people
[30:54] right so is it with God when it comes to
[30:57] the end of the road you and I have been
[31:00] a perfect bride hallelujah why because
[31:06] all of the evidence of your sin has been
[31:09] washed in the blood Wow because you
[31:12] believe God you have faith enough that
[31:16] God could take away all the blemishes
[31:17] all the stains all the wicked and wrong
[31:21] things you've done in your life
[31:24] Wow saved God is able to make you is
[31:29] that right he said ah he was able to
[31:32] present us faultless go over to God why
[31:37] because he's not looking at your life
[31:40] it's not a law it's grace hallelujah the
[31:46] bow said Abraham Ben stagger but look
[31:49] how many times God told him to go right
[31:51] and he went left right it meant because
[31:54] he said God said he didn't stagger and
[31:57] then God sent you Abraham's seed God
[32:01] will say the same thing about us as he
[32:04] did Abraham we never staggered at the
[32:06] promises of God why we made mistakes but
[32:10] we were dead right winded hallelujah we
[32:13] didn't leave and we stay within
[32:14] hallelujah and like brother said even if
[32:17] you backslide he said if you if you got
[32:19] a seed of God in you if you've been
[32:21] quickened he said you'll be miserable
[32:23] out there he said you will come back to
[32:25] God and if you don't come back to God
[32:28] God will put you to sleep
[32:31] hello because he's now he won't leave he
[32:34] won't miss one understand Amen that when
[32:39] we talk about God we're talking about
[32:41] things that are dimensional and
[32:43] oftentimes we forget we're dimensional
[32:45] creatures hallelujah you say how can I
[32:48] be a dimensional creature the Bible said
[32:50] we're now living in heavenly places in
[32:52] Christ Jesus y'all look like y'all here
[32:54] at higher ground but the real you is in
[32:57] heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[32:59] hallelujah you are
[33:01] dimensional halle-loo is that right the
[33:05] probably God proved that we were
[33:06] dimensional because he was able to call
[33:09] people up or people came up and he could
[33:11] go in that dimension one two three he
[33:13] said that the age of four this happened
[33:15] to you
[33:16] a dog scared you and this is why you
[33:18] became nervous
[33:19] he showed that these dimensions what we
[33:23] call dimensions is another world that
[33:27] right that's what the browser guy said
[33:29] he said whatever you doing here is what
[33:32] you're doing there so there's another
[33:34] world we have nothing we don't know
[33:36] nothing about but he says we're there he
[33:41] said well I don't know about that well I
[33:43] can tell you among that number of people
[33:46] that ran to him and said my precious
[33:48] brother I was one of them I don't even
[33:52] remember it and perhaps I was a little
[33:54] tot when that took place but when he saw
[33:57] me I had already been washed in the
[34:02] blood of the Lamb filled with the Holy
[34:03] Ghost and then in heavenly places before
[34:06] I even came to salvation o y'all come on
[34:12] come on come on he's nothing but the
[34:13] truth
[34:14] let me go back up here as I said hey
[34:19] it's a powerful thing and there's only
[34:23] one faith one Lord one faith one baptism
[34:27] that's your word one God the Father of
[34:30] all who is above all through all and in
[34:33] you all so there's no way of getting or
[34:35] getting out of it David said if I made
[34:38] my bed in the lowest part of hell he's
[34:40] there if I took wings and I fly I flew
[34:43] off in the morning he's there there's no
[34:45] way of getting away from God he's all
[34:48] and in all is that the Word of God now
[34:52] the Bible tells us when y'all got to
[34:53] understand this everybody have eyes but
[34:55] they cannot see there are spiritual eyes
[34:59] that spirit dimensions that we can see
[35:01] that they cannot see being in a
[35:04] Christian Ram makes us see things that
[35:06] the people who are in darkness can't see
[35:08] the Bible like it is that they are there
[35:10] sitting in darkness while we are in
[35:12] light hallelujah and so therefore we can
[35:15] see things they can't see and don't
[35:17] expect them to see what you see until
[35:20] they come to the light
[35:21] it is a dimensional thing amen
[35:24] and you you say well what do you mean
[35:26] brother but let me tell you something I
[35:28] came from God in order for me to sin I
[35:32] must have had to descend I descended you
[35:36] descended and all if you descended from
[35:41] heaven if you came down from heaven
[35:43] you'll go back to heaven
[35:45] that was what although that was of what
[35:47] the blood of Christ was all about when
[35:50] you realize it that's why he gave
[35:52] Abraham unconditional faith because
[35:54] Abraham was a chosen one election of God
[35:56] there was no way Abraham could be lost
[36:00] it wasn't even in God's plan for him to
[36:02] be lost
[36:03] y'all understand me even though he came
[36:05] into a lost world Abraham came saved he
[36:11] said what do you mean because in the
[36:12] mind of God he was and God didn't have
[36:17] my I'm just wondering now even though he
[36:19] was I didn't already put his name on the
[36:21] book he's one of mine he's the father of
[36:23] nation and all these things now but if I
[36:25] send him through this thing here it
[36:27] wonder what is he gonna be saying know
[36:30] it already been finished you know it's
[36:34] like an author when you write a book he
[36:36] comes to the end nothing can be changed
[36:39] in that book what's on page 7 is on page
[36:44] 7 and though you haven't gotten to page
[36:49] 7 yet is that page 7 won't change
[36:52] because it's been written and the
[36:55] authors come to the end of the book now
[36:57] I know in the world they revamp theirs
[36:59] and it changed this Amen add a little
[37:01] more color whatever they call it to it
[37:03] admit but God doesn't do that because
[37:05] his word is perfect
[37:07] and those this is what I love about the
[37:10] salvation I don't have to hope I'm saved
[37:12] because either I am or I am NOT but if
[37:16] God has given me the ability to believe
[37:18] that I am that I am it is God who works
[37:24] this thing it is by grace and faith is
[37:27] that right
[37:28] now we look at this thing we see how
[37:32] they in the book of Matthew 17 the Mount
[37:35] Transfiguration a scene a reality struck
[37:41] those disciples now maybe we never
[37:44] thought about it but they had never seen
[37:46] anybody who was dead for hundreds of
[37:48] years living they no doubt muster up
[37:53] their eyes and everything else
[37:55] amen here this bright light shine and
[37:57] they see Jesus clothing this light and
[37:59] they see Moses and Elijah standing there
[38:02] what was it they were looking through
[38:05] another dimension you saw why would you
[38:09] say that
[38:09] just like when Saul was on his way to
[38:11] Damascus amen and the light of God
[38:14] shining down and struck everybody didn't
[38:16] see the light everybody didn't hear the
[38:19] voice my Paul was ushered into another
[38:22] dimension he heard the voice he heard
[38:25] the words of the boss he saw the light
[38:27] and he had a conversation with Jesus and
[38:29] nobody else understood another dimension
[38:32] standing right there face to face rod
[38:35] that was faith and so was it his word
[38:40] with Moses and Elijah amen that's why it
[38:43] was so real to him here was these
[38:46] division of these two men and like I
[38:49] said how did they know it was Moses
[38:51] Elijah something in them registered that
[38:55] they knew that that was Moses and Elijah
[38:58] hallelujah it's the same way when the
[39:01] dead in Christ raised there will be
[39:03] something in us that will make us know
[39:06] these people hmm is that when we get to
[39:10] heaven you know we always I did I always
[39:13] thought when I got to heaven I'm gonna
[39:15] spend all this time coming to know who
[39:17] these people are I know these people are
[39:20] ready I knew them before the foundation
[39:22] of the world we want fellowship when
[39:25] when when the church service was one
[39:27] service we one fellowship that's why we
[39:31] feel such a kindred spirit because we
[39:33] were there in the beginning
[39:39] that's faith that's what it is it's a
[39:42] revelation amen
[39:44] call those things that be now it's a
[39:45] revelation that your existence did not
[39:48] even start here it's a revelation that
[39:52] joy existence is eternal you had no
[39:54] beginning you had no end therefore I can
[39:57] scream out like Paul I cannot die
[40:03] hallelujah and that's what this
[40:07] dimension it was amazing because Peter
[40:09] and John they said should we build three
[40:13] Tabernacles hallelujah so I'm gonna go
[40:16] back to you so you can understand that
[40:18] at the end of the day in the book of
[40:20] Revelation they said there was no
[40:22] tabernacle say why because the land was
[40:24] the tabernacle you understand me so I
[40:28] can't build another tabernacle or some
[40:31] other - because there was always one we
[40:34] were always in him and at the end of
[40:37] this whole thing we will be in him he is
[40:39] the tabernacle
[40:42] am i making sense every Lincoln said
[40:45] that's why all of this idolatry these
[40:47] things that that whip that people are
[40:49] putting in a place of salvation it will
[40:52] never work it cannot save you it didn't
[40:56] make you it didn't create you thank God
[40:58] I'm not in the image of them all you
[41:03] understand me
[41:04] God made us in His image you understand
[41:07] me
[41:08] you sure we're brothers how can it be I
[41:10] know a friend right now whose wife
[41:14] Indian brother from South Africa
[41:17] Newcastle his wife mother was a one of
[41:22] those Indians in India that worship
[41:24] monkeys and and she one day kind of
[41:28] peeked into her mother's womb Wat
[41:30] mother's room while she was praying and
[41:32] while her mom was praying her face
[41:36] disfigured into a monkey's face hello
[41:41] you understand me so this demon that was
[41:44] in the image of a monkey transformed her
[41:47] face and I always think about that
[41:50] because I think if that demon was
[41:52] to transform her face into a monkey then
[41:58] that was the same that how God was able
[42:02] to transform Stephens face hallelujah
[42:07] they said he had the face of an angel
[42:12] hallelujah the light of God over
[42:14] shattered him and the very image that
[42:17] was in him reflecting itself out that's
[42:19] exactly what the devil does where
[42:21] everybody whatever demon is there it
[42:24] reflects itself whether ever say there's
[42:29] a man in adoption - he said now God did
[42:33] the same thing to his son when he took
[42:35] Jesus up on Mount Transfiguration he
[42:37] took Peter James and John up there that
[42:39] three witnesses the earth there was
[42:41] Jesus Moses and Elijah and God upon the
[42:45] mountain they they there they stood up
[42:47] there on the mountain and the first
[42:49] thing you know they looked and Jesus was
[42:52] glorified before them
[42:53] you understand me he took three
[42:55] witnesses a man from Earth and three
[42:58] witnesses from heaven to dimensions but
[43:03] they still as witnesses earth and heaven
[43:06] was witnessing the crowning of the
[43:10] glorifying of Christ
[43:12] Jana Stanley and brother Branham said
[43:15] like this when a man is fully adopted he
[43:17] said that's the same kind of adoption we
[43:19] get he said well when is that when your
[43:23] body has changed cuz that's what
[43:26] happened to him
[43:27] his body changed he was glorified oh
[43:32] come on people
[43:33] that ought to make you shout see you're
[43:38] fully full adoption doesn't come until
[43:40] your body has changed to wit
[43:45] adoption science y'all y'all y'all y'all
[43:54] tired - that's what it feels like up
[43:57] here like everybody's tired so let me
[43:59] put some action in this thing there they
[44:02] stood up there on the mountain and the
[44:04] first thing you know they looked and
[44:06] Jesus was glorified before them is that
[44:08] right how many know that the scripture
[44:11] says that he dressed him in a robe of
[44:13] immortality hey
[44:15] and he said his raiment sign like the
[44:19] Sun is that right and a cloud over shout
[44:22] at them
[44:23] not just him him and Peter and John and
[44:27] them fell on their face and they looked
[44:30] and there stood Moses and Elijah talking
[44:32] to him and Moses had been dead and
[44:34] buried in an unmarked grave for 800
[44:37] years and Elijah took a chariot ride to
[44:40] heaven 500 years before that whoa he
[44:43] said but they were still there
[44:46] hallelujah though this earthly tower now
[44:49] can be dissolved I have one waiting I
[44:52] have a building you have a building
[44:56] Christ in you and yet you're in Christ
[44:59] figure it out hallelujah
[45:02] there they talked to him see he had
[45:05] taken Jesus up to see them to see what
[45:08] he was all about to see their show him
[45:11] these things and they talked with him he
[45:14] had a conversation with them and then as
[45:17] soon as Peter looked back again and and
[45:20] the glorification was off of Jesus they
[45:22] seen Jesus only and a voice came from
[45:25] clouds and said this is my beloved son
[45:28] hear you him his name just as good as
[45:31] mine now hear ye him that's it adopted
[45:35] and place sons hallelujah and y'all
[45:38] think just the Holy Ghost is here
[45:40] that ain't it that ain't all of it
[45:41] there's a lot of people with the Holy
[45:44] Ghost some will even miss the rapture
[45:46] because amen the Holy Ghost is not in
[45:49] their soul but those Amen who's Holy
[45:53] Ghost is in their soul and they allow
[45:55] the Holy Spirit to bring them up into a
[45:57] statue
[45:58] you understand
[45:59] me and when God come and this is what I
[46:01] really see when God began to sweep one
[46:04] more time people saw where the revival
[46:06] is over maybe sold for a lot of people
[46:09] but there's another coming that God will
[46:12] work a work in a bride of Jesus Christ
[46:14] amen that would give her a rapturing
[46:17] faith it's true some of us only have
[46:19] fake to kill a headache but God will
[46:22] anoint us a man in such a power will be
[46:26] the true sons and daughters of God don't
[46:28] worry he will come he will be on time
[46:33] and he will perform everything in you
[46:36] that he promised now faith is I am a son
[46:42] of God now that's what the Bible said
[46:44] now are you sons of God and it does not
[46:47] yet appear what you shall be but when he
[46:50] shall come or when he shall appear we
[46:52] know one thing we'll be like him what
[46:54] happened when he appeared those thunders
[46:56] were loosed hallelujah and God gave us
[46:59] his divine nature and when he quickened
[47:02] us when he quickened that seed that
[47:03] divine nature cannot be stopped because
[47:07] it's a perfect seed he says it's it's
[47:12] kind of seed that can grow in any kind
[47:14] of weather
[47:16] by its dimensional over there your
[47:23] understanding so you and I must
[47:25] understand by God's grace God is doing
[47:32] the thing in us what we need to do is
[47:34] just have faith in God don't ever let
[47:38] the devil make you doubt you won't make
[47:39] a rapture you believe it you confess it
[47:43] let it be your testimony it ain't about
[47:46] what you did I did this stuff it's about
[47:48] what he does and if you have a of
[47:51] something in your heart that makes you
[47:53] believe you bribed you must confess it
[47:56] because you got to give it to the angel
[47:58] the angel has to make you come to pass
[48:01] the age of confession that right there
[48:05] is that's what brother Owen said if you
[48:07] confess it there's an angel that makes
[48:10] it come to pass
[48:11] you gotta confess it he said we each one
[48:22] count come down to the end of the road
[48:24] where we're going to give it a count for
[48:26] every word that's why we got to preach
[48:28] faith you got to call those things that
[48:31] be not as though they were about
[48:33] yourself about your loved ones
[48:35] I mean don't let doubt get in your
[48:37] spirit call it don't hope hope will help
[48:41] you none but hope only makes you
[48:43] miserable yeah you know what I hope they
[48:47] get here on time
[48:49] I hope they get here home time you can
[48:51] understand me hope makes you miserable
[48:54] but faith hallelujah makes you stand
[48:57] like the Rock of Gibraltar
[48:59] hallelujah now when we are born our
[49:02] first little cry goes on all on tape
[49:05] it's it's going to be played back again
[49:09] at the day of judgment even the clothes
[49:11] you wear would be showed in your face at
[49:14] that day of judgment even science has
[49:16] found that by television see see
[49:18] television doesn't manufacture picture
[49:20] it only channels it the color of clothes
[49:23] every time you move every thought in

[50:30] salvation see we're not going to escape
[50:33] every move in the thoughts of your heart
[50:35] is recorded right in another dimension
[50:38] here in the color of your clothes you
[50:40] wear television color television proves
[50:43] it right out pulls it out and shows the
[50:45] seat and that's just in one dimension
[50:48] from the three that we live in what he
[50:52] said we live in three you know Paul says
[51:03] like this he said we're not the children
[51:05] of Wrath
[51:06] he said beloved we are persuaded better
[51:09] things of you and the things that
[51:11] accompany salvation though we speak for
[51:14] God is not unrighteous to forget your
[51:16] work and labor of love which you have
[51:18] showed toward his name in that you have
[51:20] ministered to the Saints and do minister
[51:22] and we desire every one of you to show
[51:25] the same diligence to their full
[51:27] assurance of the hope unto the end that
[51:29] ye be not slothful but follows a bit
[51:32] through faith and patience inherit the
[51:35] promises hmm well I give up I quit
[51:38] because you know I just don't see myself
[51:40] getting better how you gonna see
[51:42] yourself getting better it's God in you
[51:46] you clothed with sinful flesh it's the
[51:50] inner man that God is looking at your
[51:54] flesh is condemned rarity is already
[51:56] judged hello it is that that day amen
[52:01] yo what your flesh will be redeemed but
[52:04] right now it is a wicked old enemy of
[52:07] yours hmm but we must know understand
[52:11] listen assess for when God made a
[52:14] promise to Abraham because he could
[52:17] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[52:22] God made a promise God made a promise to
[52:26] you brother branham said it like this
[52:29] God knew that in this day you would have
[52:32] a desire to be saying and he saved you
[52:35] but mind you he gave
[52:37] you desire to be saved thank God for the
[52:42] desire saying surely I will bless thee
[52:45] and multiply I will multiply thee and so
[52:49] forth after he had patiently endured he
[52:52] obtained the promise
[52:53] did he not the Bible said Abraham looked
[52:57] for a city whose maker was God and
[52:59] brother Branham said when he got there
[53:01] to Palestine or right there when
[53:03] Jerusalem all he needed to do was look
[53:05] up Jerusalem will stick right vet Yahoo
[53:10] Jerusalem was right above him hallelujah
[53:14] huh
[53:15] and that's what you and I understand
[53:17] heaven is not a million miles away
[53:19] heaven isn't in another dimension right
[53:21] here so what do you say I'm trying to
[53:24] tell you something you can't see God but
[53:27] God is here first of all he said were
[53:29] two or three of God that I'm in the mist
[53:31] that means he's in the middle of us he's
[53:34] right there hallelujah but even so God
[53:38] is still here he's just in another
[53:40] dimension the all-seeing what I he is
[53:45] the one that sees everything right two
[53:52] immutable things I love it I'm so glad
[53:55] that God didn't didn't didn't say ok
[53:57] according to your because you swore yeah
[54:03] we will hold him what you know swearing
[54:06] I'm you know I'm bad he didn't base my
[54:08] salvation on what I promised to do for
[54:11] him Oh God if you just saved me I do
[54:19] this how many of us has come too short
[54:27] we all have amen and our greatest
[54:31] efforts we're failures or than say we
[54:33] were born failures mmm it takes the
[54:38] grace of God both that's why I'm so
[54:39] happy you may not understand I am happy
[54:44] in my soul amen I am happy
[54:50] because I realize by God's grace it is
[54:53] not by works it is by the grace of God
[54:57] don't you understand me
[54:59] it's because he choose he has chosen to
[55:02] have favor with me not because I deserve
[55:04] it not because you think it's goodness
[55:07] he's no I always always like to go to
[55:12] the starting I'm almost done I like go
[55:14] to the start where they said there was
[55:16] no one worthy to take the book or the
[55:20] lucency is there uh out of all those
[55:24] great prophets out of all the things
[55:26] they had done of course I'm not we're
[55:28] nowhere on the scale but but I heard a
[55:32] message the other day when brother man
[55:33] said I just reached my goal I've just
[55:37] reached in honey said I just reached in
[55:43] other words he says I've got two million
[55:44] souls I've won to the Lord already 2
[55:48] million so 2 million 2 million
[55:56] understand this but understand this God
[56:00] gave him however million he won to the
[56:04] Lord it was not William Branham it was
[56:08] God now I want you to understand every
[56:11] soul you went to God it's not you but
[56:16] God rewards you because you allowed him
[56:20] to use your body these are all brothers
[56:25] that can't be right it is because when
[56:28] when when Jesus is stepped forward what
[56:31] did those 24 elders do they took the
[56:34] crown all threw them down and they fell
[56:37] to the floor what would they say every
[56:40] work every honor that I have ever
[56:42] received my sitting here my being here
[56:45] my crown everything has come because you
[56:47] did it he did it and God rewards us
[56:52] because whosoever will he wants your
[56:56] will and he rewards you for allowing him
[57:00] to use your body even though he made it
[57:06] think about it into God if God ordained
[57:12] you today would you want win one soul
[57:14] that one soul to God is just like
[57:17] brother Barron's millions because you
[57:19] fulfill your purpose it's the truth you
[57:29] know we look and I thought like that law
[57:32] that weird the time of gleaming even if
[57:35] I had a designer when thousands there's
[57:37] not thousands up there but as long as
[57:40] I'm gleaming loudly pick up five or six
[57:43] and that's what I was a day to do he was
[57:45] saying well done good and faithful
[57:50] servant
[57:52] aren't you happy about that you said
[57:57] what I want a large portion of heaven I
[57:58] don't know about you but I got me a lot
[58:00] you said what do you mean my portion is
[58:03] larges as large as brother branham's
[58:05] what because if you see receive a
[58:10] prophet a prophet you see the prophecy
[58:20] it might have been so small but my small
[58:24] part is just as valuable is if somebody
[58:26] with a big chunk right it's the truth
[58:34] everybody that got over there with
[58:36] Joshua was the reward Canaan was reward
[58:41] Joshua was the captain right and look at
[58:45] Moses even though he didn't make it
[58:46] Moses took him to that place and all
[58:49] that Joshua inherited Moses inherited
[58:55] listen I'm closing on this he says how
[58:57] many feels just all ready to go he said
[59:01] oh isn't that wonderful if the trumpet
[59:03] sound what difference does it make we
[59:06] drop a cross and receive a crown we
[59:08] can't fail I love hearing that can't
[59:12] when it comes to that kind of thing God
[59:14] already accepted us
[59:17] oh I want to be accepted know if you got
[59:20] the Holy Ghost he's already accepted you
[59:23] he said to spirit his spirit is here
[59:26] with us doing performing acting just
[59:30] exactly what he said would take place
[59:32] aren't you glad that God called you then
[59:36] you can feel sorry for those don't
[59:38] condemn them but feel sorry for those
[59:41] whose eyes are closing can't see it they
[59:45] cannot see it unless God knew they would
[59:48] see it before the foundation of the
[59:49] world for all he foreknew he called
[59:53] those we called he justified those who
[59:56] he is justified he had glorified already
[59:59] is written in the book Christ come to
[1:00:02] redeem those who God by foreknowledge
[1:00:04] knew that would receive him a man and
[1:00:08] abet isn't a wonderful thing hey I
[1:00:13] accepted Christ that eight it is Christ
[1:00:15] accepting you and to know that there are
[1:00:18] we are this afternoon just at the end
[1:00:21] time and all these great things
[1:00:23] happening and here we are safely in
[1:00:26] Christ your life proves it now if your
[1:00:29] life don't tally up to it you're
[1:00:30] deceived that's right but if you see it
[1:00:33] understand praising God for it your life
[1:00:36] is full of righteousness of God it ain't
[1:00:39] hard for you to do something like that
[1:00:41] see so you and I must understand when
[1:00:44] you this is what people where they fail
[1:00:46] you know we fail in the sense that we
[1:00:51] don't realize that the work has already
[1:00:52] been done and how thing is that when
[1:00:56] John saw the lamb he rejoiced
[1:01:00] he didn't say well what must I do to
[1:01:03] make it he saw he made it and he began
[1:01:06] to rejoice we're so much that all heaven
[1:01:08] and earth and everything heard John
[1:01:10] saying now my thought is this when a
[1:01:13] true revelation has come to your heart
[1:01:16] with this message it's done for you it
[1:01:17] will cause a joy unspeakable it will
[1:01:21] cause you to rejoice at times when
[1:01:23] everything is whipping on you you can
[1:01:26] still have a joy you can still rejoice
[1:01:28] you might be impressed
[1:01:30] but you still can say thank you Jesus
[1:01:33] see it transform you because your life
[1:01:36] is now in heavenly places and when you
[1:01:39] in heavenly places there ain't nothin
[1:01:41] joy the Bible said when you are in his
[1:01:43] presence their joy there's flawless of
[1:01:45] joy see and what it is we need to know
[1:01:49] that we need to know that the faith that
[1:01:51] we we sit we claim to have will give you
[1:01:53] vision will make you break into another
[1:01:56] dimension because you believe yeah
[1:02:00] faith will caused that dimension to come
[1:02:03] to you right they believed that they was
[1:02:07] going to have a deliverer hallelujah
[1:02:09] there were the Jews believing that a
[1:02:11] deliverer was going to come their faith
[1:02:13] reached out grab that delivering called
[1:02:16] him Moses see that that's what faith
[1:02:19] will do in a take was in that other
[1:02:21] dimension that unseen and you know the
[1:02:23] Bible said that unseen RAM is that one
[1:02:25] that's more real than any other right
[1:02:27] those things that are unseen were there
[1:02:29] before the scene right so it's not that
[1:02:33] we made this from that we made this from
[1:02:35] that somebody had a vision of it and
[1:02:38] what we're seeing here is in another
[1:02:40] dimension you say all that a to it is
[1:02:43] because when brother Branham had that
[1:02:45] dream there was a horse there was his
[1:02:47] chair there was a mansion there was a
[1:02:49] lot of things in that dimension he said
[1:02:51] the Brando's ain't never had a mansion
[1:02:53] where you got one man hallelujah it was
[1:02:56] always there hallelujah the mansion was
[1:03:00] waiting on William Branham the horse and
[1:03:03] the dog see and so we said what do you
[1:03:09] mean that same dog that came to wood
[1:03:12] that was brother Branham saw that dog
[1:03:14] had life in the other of the dimension
[1:03:18] everlasting whatever you call it I don't
[1:03:19] know what God gives the animals with all
[1:03:21] I know they were there so that dog God
[1:03:24] took that same dog brought him in this
[1:03:26] dimension
[1:03:27] he became William branham's dog so when
[1:03:29] that dog got died guess where he went
[1:03:31] where he came from back got it see how
[1:03:35] big it is only people but
[1:03:41] everything that came from God goes back
[1:03:42] to God he lose nothing nothing this this
[1:03:48] fall in time and Sid doesn't doesn't
[1:03:51] bankrupt God or cause God to go in some
[1:03:54] kind of creating a red or something no
[1:03:58] put it away the way God does it God took
[1:04:01] a job job children came job children was
[1:04:05] with Joe before he came this way when
[1:04:07] Joe children died though they were
[1:04:08] sinners they were there hi cuz Joe had
[1:04:15] an atonement he offered the blood and
[1:04:19] because of Joe's blood and faith faith
[1:04:22] in the blood his children were saved
[1:04:25] Oh somebody help me here see so you you
[1:04:30] gotta understand you got ahold faster
[1:04:32] your faith your family is depending upon
[1:04:35] you they won't get there without you
[1:04:41] they may not be bribed but they'll be
[1:04:43] there I really believe that I believe
[1:04:47] that God told the Prophet all that love
[1:04:49] you and you love will be there I believe
[1:04:52] that he's a prophet I get the same
[1:04:55] reward all they love me and all that I
[1:04:58] love will be there I believe that
[1:05:02] Deborah can take that I've seen some
[1:05:06] things on that en so no the devil can't
[1:05:08] take that you know and when you see
[1:05:11] things when you see things you gotta
[1:05:15] really believe sometimes God would give
[1:05:17] you something you said I don't know I
[1:05:18] know what I saw I know what I'm looking
[1:05:21] at that's how we say it
[1:05:22] I can't doubt no matter what it looks
[1:05:24] like I can't I know God is gonna do it
[1:05:26] because I don't know what I seen but I
[1:05:28] saw it you know you've seen it in
[1:05:30] another dimension so you can't put your
[1:05:32] finger on it but you know it's there you
[1:05:34] know it's if God is giving it to you
[1:05:36] it's like your victory or you know I I
[1:05:38] don't know how to put it but somehow God
[1:05:41] gives you an assurance gives you we call
[1:05:46] it faith but gives you that revelation
[1:05:48] it's going to happen just like I asked
[1:05:52] right
