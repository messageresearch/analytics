[46:51] Lord today amen let's turn in the Bible
[46:54] if you've got the Bible ready this
[46:56] morning
[46:57] Leviticus Amen God helping us this
[47:01] morning I want to speak to you upon the
[47:05] return to freedom the return to freedom
[47:09] amen Leviticus chapter 25 pick up verse
[47:14] 39 blessed be the Lord
[47:21] vidiq is 25 verse 39 amen let's read now
[47:30] down to verse 41 and if thy brother that
[47:35] dwelleth by they be waxing
[47:37] poor and be sold unto thee thou shalt
[47:41] not compel him to serve as a bondservant
[47:43] but as a hired servant and as a
[47:46] sojourner he shall be with thee and
[47:49] shall serve thee unto the year of
[47:52] Jubilee and then shall he depart from
[47:55] thee both he and his children with him
[47:59] and shall return unto his own family and
[48:06] unto the possession of his father's
[48:09] shall he return I want you to notice
[48:12] this theme again and again and again
[48:14] return return return now let me call
[48:18] your attention to Exodus chapter 21 if
[48:23] you'll hold your place there in
[48:24] Leviticus we'll revisit that in just a
[48:26] moment if you put your thumb or your
[48:27] finger there in your Bible or your
[48:29] marker and let's look at that in just a
[48:32] little bit but let's read Exodus 21
[48:34] verse 2 we appreciate the Lord Amen all
[48:39] his mercy to us today thank God mercy
[48:41] walked in a man and a man I like the
[48:44] song they sang
[48:45] wonderful Jesus's to me exodus chapter
[48:48] 21 verse 2 and if thou by a Hebrew
[48:51] servant 6 years he shall serve and in
[48:56] the seventh church age I mean in the
[48:58] seventh he shall go out free for nothing
[49:02] if he came in by himself he shall go out
[49:06] by himself if he were married then his
[49:09] wife shall go out with him
[49:11] this master hath given him a wife and
[49:14] she hath borne him sons or daughters the
[49:17] wife and her children shall be her
[49:20] masters and he shall go out by himself
[49:23] and if the servant shall plainly say I
[49:26] love my master my wife my children I
[49:30] will not go out free then his master
[49:33] shall bring him unto the judges and he
[49:36] shall also bring him to the door or unto
[49:40] the door post and his master shall bore
[49:43] his ear through with an awl and he shall
[49:47] serve Him forever forever amen let's
[49:52] pray together over the word Lord Jesus
[49:56] we thank you this morning for your mercy
[49:58] in your grace once again we want to say
[50:01] how grateful we are that mercy walked in
[50:03] bless us Lord and our gathering here
[50:05] today speak to us by thy word in Jesus
[50:09] Christ's name Amen
[50:10] and the Saints in a man you may be
[50:13] seated may the Lord bless you real good
[50:15] that's a that's a Pentecostal rule did
[50:18] you know that before you sit down you
[50:21] got to give a good a man it's a
[50:23] Pentecostal rule somebody said where did
[50:26] you find that out I said it's on the
[50:27] last page somewhere another a man I I
[50:30] thank the Lord for the Word of God now I
[50:34] want you to go back there to Leviticus
[50:36] 25 for just a moment and less Sun and
[50:39] also hold that place in Exodus if you
[50:42] got your Bible there just kindly catch
[50:44] both those places we're gonna look at
[50:46] them for just a little bit Leviticus 25
[50:48] in the next is 21 if you hold those
[50:50] spots for just a moment I want to dwell
[50:52] there for just a little bit so we can
[50:54] get kind of the emphasis of our thought
[50:56] now what I want you to
[50:58] here in this first part of Leviticus and
[51:02] not that verse 39 there I want you to
[51:05] notice in those first two verses we read
[51:07] 39 and 40 that if thy brother be sold
[51:11] unto another in other words if it be
[51:14] sold to another Israelite he shall not
[51:17] serve as a bondservant I want you to
[51:20] notice that carefully but in verse 40 as
[51:23] a hired servant now you think well what
[51:26] in the world is really the difference
[51:28] between the two well first of all a
[51:29] bondservant has no rights whatsoever
[51:33] that's afforded to him in life or in
[51:36] humanity he has no rights once this man
[51:39] becomes a bondservant or this woman
[51:42] becomes a bondservant they have no
[51:44] promise of freedom unless they escape or
[51:48] kill their master or some kind of a
[51:49] thing like that there's no way that they
[51:52] themselves can ever become free but has
[51:55] a hired servant they have rights and
[51:58] privileges underneath the law that was
[52:01] given by Moses and why is that because
[52:03] these people that were talking about
[52:05] they are Israelites who have been
[52:08] circumcised the eighth day are you with
[52:10] me
[52:10] amen they have been given a covenant by
[52:13] God that every place the sole of their
[52:16] foot shall tread upon God said I will
[52:18] give unto you that place so they're not
[52:21] to be treated God said as a slave as we
[52:25] would say it they're not to be treated
[52:27] as a bondservant but for example say
[52:30] that I fell into dead maybe I was
[52:33] running a farm I'm a farmer out here in
[52:35] Iowa there's a lot of farming and things
[52:36] and as I'm going about my daily business
[52:39] I have a bad year of crops and now I
[52:42] can't afford to pay my debts well I've
[52:44] got a rich uncle okay and I go to my
[52:46] rich uncle and I say listen I need you
[52:49] to help me out I'm in trouble so he
[52:51] helps me out financially with the
[52:53] burdens and the bonds and whatever the
[52:55] more that I may owe and my doing so I
[52:58] need to pay off my debt to him I may
[53:01] lose my farm I may not be able to go on
[53:03] in life but I can make it right with my
[53:06] uncle or ever who it might be a meant to
[53:08] be able to give to them the ability now
[53:12] my own physical servitude to work you
[53:15] members the story was with Jacob
[53:17] whenever Jacob was sitting there and
[53:20] Jacob wanted Rachel amen but he ended up
[53:23] getting Leah he got the ugly one before
[53:25] he got the pretty one amen and he didn't
[53:27] really love her
[53:28] Leah he loved Rachel but remember when
[53:32] he came unto Laban he worked for the
[53:35] first seven years to pay off the dowry
[53:37] so that he could get Rachel ended up
[53:40] getting Leah and then as he wanted
[53:42] Rachel he worked another seven years in
[53:44] order to get a Rachel later on so it
[53:48] proves to us that in the Old Testament
[53:50] that God had a requirement there that if
[53:54] they did wrong and I was reading this
[53:56] just the other day how that he said if
[53:58] you lose an eye and then somebody takes
[54:01] an eye then you give an eye in return
[54:03] ever what is the Equality or what is
[54:06] equitable God wanted them to work in
[54:09] that way of being fair of being just of
[54:12] being equitable one to another a man if
[54:15] a man wants to slay a beast if he fell
[54:17] into a hole or a pit the Bible said
[54:20] you're to restore to him the animal amen
[54:22] if one animal gets killed then another
[54:24] animal must repay so God is laying a
[54:27] principle in here that whatever you do
[54:30] unto others it is to be done unto you
[54:33] and I for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
[54:35] are you with me so far
[54:36] Amen am I going too fast maybe a little
[54:39] bit Amen I'll try to slow down so the
[54:41] translation can get it but a ment when
[54:43] you're in Pentecost it's hard to slow
[54:45] down boy I don't know you just have to
[54:47] hang on for dear life that's all I know
[54:49] amen but now remember the law here is
[54:52] that when he comes to the year of
[54:55] Jubilee he can work no matter what his
[54:58] amount of debt is no matter how little
[55:00] brother Marshall no matter how big it
[55:02] might be whenever he comes to that hour
[55:05] that he hears the Jubilee sound he can
[55:08] return as though he never had a debt in
[55:11] the first place are you listening to me
[55:14] amen this is a Bible principle now look
[55:17] at there again in Leviticus or excuse me
[55:19] in Exodus chapter 21 now pop back over
[55:22] there to the second verse now and look
[55:25] for just a little bit
[55:26] at the law of jewbilee and how Jubilee
[55:28] worked together now you'll notice this
[55:30] whenever he says that if the brother he
[55:33] said if a man would buy this Hebrew
[55:36] servant that it would be in the seventh
[55:38] that he would go out freed I remember it
[55:41] is in the seventh church age that is the
[55:44] year of the sounding of the jubilee
[55:47] trumpet for you and I Amen I want you to
[55:49] listen and stay with me for just a
[55:50] moment amen and I hope these that get
[55:53] this on the Internet they may the watan
[55:55] here today I hope if you listen to this
[55:57] sermon you don't miss this next point
[55:58] that I'm going to make because it's very
[56:00] important and vital to the day that
[56:02] we're living in amen and one thing that
[56:05] I want to remind you of is that as God
[56:07] was restoring the truth to us in the
[56:10] last day I want you to remember he meant
[56:13] that when Luther come and preached
[56:15] justification he preached to us the
[56:18] truth of justification but did not
[56:21] preach at all Amen when Wesley preached
[56:23] to us sanctification he preached us the
[56:26] truth of sanctification but he did not
[56:29] preach at all when pentecost arrived
[56:31] amen the restoration of the nine
[56:34] spiritual gifts many people thought this
[56:37] was the long-awaited jubilee for the
[56:40] bride of Jesus Christ but brother
[56:42] Branham tells us in the church age book
[56:44] that it was not the long-awaited return
[56:46] of the Jubilee it was only the
[56:49] restoration of the gifts are you with me
[56:52] amen so there must be a jubilee sounding
[56:55] amen in the last day a trumpet that will
[56:59] sound in the last hour hallelujah that
[57:02] will let us know it is time to return
[57:05] back to our freedom that we had in the
[57:08] beginning amen I love the Word of God I
[57:11] love how types fit together
[57:13] amen and you can go back into the Bible
[57:15] and you realize that God had commanded
[57:17] the Levites to blow their trumpet to
[57:21] sound out the sound of freedom remember
[57:24] Paul tells us that the trumpet the
[57:27] trumpet must give a certain sound
[57:31] now these Levites they wasn't just
[57:33] Commission of God to walk around and
[57:35] handout schools of Moses we are not
[57:39] Commission
[57:39] push play and obey were called to preach
[57:42] the gospel Amen somebody said I don't
[57:46] like that I said I can't help it it's
[57:47] the truth anyhow Amen God didn't call me
[57:50] as an evangelist to pack a tape recorder
[57:53] under my arm and go church to church and
[57:55] push play on the prophet of God let me
[57:57] tell you if you're a Bible believing
[57:59] Christian if you believe the message of
[58:01] the hour you should be pushing play
[58:03] every day of your life
[58:05] amen and when I come to this platform a
[58:07] man that I can preach to you something I
[58:10] can direct you I can blow a trumpet and
[58:13] you will know how to prepare yourself
[58:16] for the war that's coming
[58:18] amen our I take offense to evangelist
[58:21] being called to just go play brother
[58:23] branham's tapes I'm offended by that as
[58:25] an evangelist I am not called to just
[58:27] play tapes I play them I listen to
[58:31] brother Branham I believe the message
[58:33] with all of my heart I know that he was
[58:35] a vindicated prophet of God but I've got
[58:38] a trumpet to blow the sound is not my
[58:41] own sound the sound was given to us by
[58:45] Elijah a man who restored the mysteries
[58:48] of God in the last stage he told us what
[58:50] God expected but I am NOT commissioned
[58:54] to go around there and hand out Bibles
[58:55] I'm not commissioned to go church to
[58:58] church to church and make sure
[58:59] everybody's got a Bible who some of
[59:02] y'all was Holliday man you ain't saying
[59:03] too much now but it's the truth anyhow
[59:05] amen we are not called to play tapes
[59:08] we're called to preach the gospel
[59:11] amen how's the believing Christian I
[59:14] believe that we should read our Bible
[59:16] everyday but everybody that reads the
[59:19] Bible will not understand the sound of
[59:21] freedom everybody that hears brother
[59:23] Bibles voice will not be able to obey it
[59:26] it takes the Holy Ghost to do that amen
[59:29] now you either gonna say man or not I'm
[59:31] just gonna preach it anyhow and then
[59:32] because we're we're living in the last
[59:34] day is people have tried to tie us to
[59:37] the flesh of humanity as an outsourced
[59:40] for our freedom but my freedom is not
[59:43] attached to the flesh of any human being
[59:46] it is not attached to William Branham
[59:49] it is not attached Isaiah Brooks it is
[59:52] not attached to anybody else it is
[59:55] attached to the Lord Jesus Christ and if
[59:59] I am born again of the Holy Spirit I've
[1:00:01] got something to say I don't care if I'm
[1:00:05] the janitor I've got something to say
[1:00:07] I've got a trumpet that I can blow I've
[1:00:10] got a jubilee that I can sound if I'm a
[1:00:13] father if I'm a husband if I'm a wife if
[1:00:16] I'm a mother I've got something I can
[1:00:19] tell my Yang's a man not just push play
[1:00:23] on a tape recorder I want you all to
[1:00:25] listen to me carefully friends I don't I
[1:00:27] don't mean to sound rude but I mean to
[1:00:29] say it straight we've come to an hour
[1:00:31] where we think with our young people
[1:00:33] sitting here that if we set them down
[1:00:35] and we push play on a tape recorder
[1:00:37] that's going to give them a revelation
[1:00:38] of who they are words a man in case you
[1:00:42] forgot it we've come to a spot we think
[1:00:46] if we hand them a message book or a
[1:00:48] church age book we think that's gonna
[1:00:50] bring him to salvation oh I know what
[1:00:53] you might be thinking train up a child
[1:00:55] in the way it'll go I believe that too
[1:00:57] I believe we should train them to know
[1:01:00] what is truth and what is God's Word but
[1:01:03] if they don't have the baptism of the
[1:01:04] Holy Ghost I don't care how much you
[1:01:07] push play I don't care how much you read
[1:01:09] the Bible I don't care how much you pray
[1:01:11] over them until they get the revelation
[1:01:13] themself it ain't gonna make them be
[1:01:15] free freedom does not come because you
[1:01:19] attend a message church
[1:01:21] come on preach to me now freedom does
[1:01:25] not come because you believe brother
[1:01:27] Branham as a prophet come on now Church
[1:01:31] freedom comes because you have been
[1:01:34] liberated by the power of Almighty God
[1:01:37] and you know who you are
[1:01:41] amen as I told him and I was City last
[1:01:43] night whenever you see yourself in the
[1:01:45] looking glass of God's Word you realize
[1:01:48] that that's you
[1:01:49] he said he waved at the little boy the
[1:01:51] little boy away back he smiled at the
[1:01:53] little boy the little boy's smile back
[1:01:55] he said hey after a while arose hey
[1:01:57] mommy that's me in there
[1:01:59] and then let me tell you something how
[1:02:01] many people down through the street
[1:02:03] the time has sat and message searches
[1:02:05] played brother diamonds tapes in their
[1:02:07] car ha oh I know some of you resent that
[1:02:11] I really don't care I'm gonna preach it
[1:02:13] anyhow amen
[1:02:16] it's the truth they don't bother me a
[1:02:17] bit you can get upset if you want to but
[1:02:19] that just shows so you don't really
[1:02:21] understand what this message is all
[1:02:22] about because if you do you pushing play
[1:02:25] is the is the epitome of what this
[1:02:27] message is all about then you don't
[1:02:29] understand what brother Branham was sent
[1:02:30] here for neither Branham was not sent
[1:02:33] here so that we can tie ourselves to
[1:02:35] every little word that came out of his
[1:02:37] mouth he was here to do a job and He
[1:02:41] fulfilled that job by planning us to
[1:02:44] freedom and to the Jubilee hour where
[1:02:47] the bride could be released from
[1:02:50] everything that was contrary I was
[1:02:54] telling some of the brother last night
[1:02:56] that's the thing about the message of
[1:02:58] the hour this message stands against
[1:03:02] every organizational spirit around this
[1:03:04] world this message resists every sin
[1:03:08] that could ever be committed and you
[1:03:12] think you're going to push play and obey
[1:03:14] you need to hold a ghost to do such
[1:03:16] things because if you're not born again
[1:03:19] you're still under bondage I don't care
[1:03:22] who you are be you a preacher ever who
[1:03:24] you are hey listen I've been putting a
[1:03:26] preacher's went off with somebody else's
[1:03:27] wife then printing preachers run off
[1:03:31] with the with it with the money bag been
[1:03:34] printing of preachers live worldly and
[1:03:36] yet try to be claimed to be gospel men
[1:03:38] come on don't look at me that way
[1:03:40] they've been plenty of them nothing but
[1:03:42] a bunch of sawed-off hypocrites hey man
[1:03:46] just cause he's a preacher don't mean
[1:03:49] nothing oh he's a preacher he needs to
[1:03:51] have the Holy Ghost - I don't care if
[1:03:54] he's a deacon of Trustee oh yes you must
[1:03:56] be Brian I can that's what Jesus said
[1:03:59] you cannot avoid that you can't
[1:04:02] overwhelm that you can't overlook it you
[1:04:04] can't say well I think you don't matter
[1:04:06] what you think who cares what mirror you
[1:04:08] think that's what the word says that's
[1:04:10] what matters and then the word says
[1:04:12] we're supposed to be born again that's
[1:04:14] exactly right
[1:04:14] notice it was in the seven
[1:04:17] our that this man could go out free now
[1:04:20] watch this if while he was in servitude
[1:04:24] how this goes he fell in love with a
[1:04:29] girl and while he was in love with this
[1:04:33] girl he got married to her and they had
[1:04:36] some kids the Bible said that if he
[1:04:41] wants to go he can go but they've got to
[1:04:44] stay why they wasn't his property in the
[1:04:46] beginning now from the outside looking
[1:04:50] in what one of you brothers in love with
[1:04:53] your wife would want to say well fine
[1:04:57] I'll leave if you do you don't love her
[1:05:00] right from the natural side of looking
[1:05:05] at this naturally speaking I don't blame
[1:05:08] this man I would have stayed with my
[1:05:10] wife and children too if I could have
[1:05:13] the law gave him away you have to live
[1:05:17] in servitude
[1:05:18] so is your love worth it yes absolutely
[1:05:22] I love this woman I love these youngins
[1:05:25] what brother would want to give up his
[1:05:27] beautiful children walk away from him if
[1:05:31] it meant living in slavery he'd be
[1:05:33] willing to do it
[1:05:34] if it meant being a servant the rest of
[1:05:37] his days he loved his family so much
[1:05:39] he'd be willing to do it there's two
[1:05:41] types here I want you to see the first
[1:05:43] step it is it's the type of the Lord
[1:05:45] Jesus Christ who loved you and I so much
[1:05:48] that he was willing to become a servant
[1:05:50] Oh hallelujah he was willing to become a
[1:05:54] servant that he could win you and I amen
[1:05:58] the Bible said in Philippians he come in
[1:06:00] the likeness of sinful flesh taking upon
[1:06:04] him the farm have a servant the other
[1:06:08] type I want you to see is when the Lord
[1:06:10] Jesus went back and picked up amen this
[1:06:12] very same scenario and he said it like
[1:06:15] this but if a man will have father
[1:06:17] mother sister brother life children or
[1:06:19] anything more than me he's not worthy of
[1:06:23] the gospel there's two things you can
[1:06:24] look at here but in both cases you can
[1:06:29] see the Lord Jesus
[1:06:30] hiding in the pages of the Bible Oh
[1:06:34] hallelujah when you look at the natural
[1:06:37] side of it who was Ruth Ruth was a girl
[1:06:41] that just fell in love with Boaz she
[1:06:44] just fell in love with a man oh I know
[1:06:46] the part your God will be my god your
[1:06:49] place our Lodge for you I know all that
[1:06:51] but when you're looking at it from the
[1:06:53] natural side Ruth didn't go let herself
[1:06:55] down at the feet of Boaz and say oh I
[1:06:57] think I'll be the type of the bride now
[1:07:00] she wasn't even looking at it like that
[1:07:02] she was a girl in love with a man
[1:07:04] hallelujah to God a man but inside of
[1:07:08] her life was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:11] hiding himself in the simplicity of that
[1:07:14] young girl's life amen and she typed out
[1:07:18] she gave us an example of what it is
[1:07:22] today who are you what are you all about
[1:07:27] as far as the world is concerned nothing
[1:07:30] great now to have really any kind of big
[1:07:33] way about yourself nobody calls you on
[1:07:36] the phone to make political decisions
[1:07:39] nobody sends you emails to find out
[1:07:42] whether the banks of the America can run
[1:07:45] amen to the world you're a little bit in
[1:07:48] nobody but if Jesus is hiding inside of
[1:07:51] your life what are you you're a girl
[1:07:54] that's felling in love with a man you're
[1:07:57] a bride that has fallen in love with
[1:07:59] Jesus Christ are you with me church amen
[1:08:02] you're an individual who has fallen in
[1:08:04] love with Almighty God and because you
[1:08:08] have fallen in love with the Lord Jesus
[1:08:09] he hides himself inside of you and the
[1:08:15] devil looks at you and says who are you
[1:08:19] you ain't nobody that's true you ain't
[1:08:24] got nothing to offer you're right but
[1:08:28] I'm a girl that's fallen in love with a
[1:08:30] boy I'm a wife I'm a bride that's
[1:08:35] falling in love with a man his name is
[1:08:38] Jesus Christ and I am his wife
[1:08:41] I want you to listen to me Church the
[1:08:44] relationship
[1:08:44] I'm talking about it does not come by
[1:08:48] learning the things of the scripture it
[1:08:50] does not come by push play and obey what
[1:08:53] I'm talking comes from a relationship
[1:08:57] where you meet this God that I'm talking
[1:08:59] about there's got to be a connection I
[1:09:03] won't tell you what one of the biggest
[1:09:05] problems we got around the ring sis
[1:09:06] messages I've been at this 28 years
[1:09:09] around the world I know what I'm talking
[1:09:11] about one of the biggest problems that
[1:09:13] we got in this message is we got a lot
[1:09:15] of head knowledge about what Brigham
[1:09:16] said but we don't have any heart
[1:09:19] knowledge about who God is some people
[1:09:22] wouldn't know what a vision was if it
[1:09:23] slapped him upside the head some people
[1:09:27] wouldn't know what the supernatural
[1:09:29] touch of the Holy Spirit I'm not talking
[1:09:31] about raising the dead I'm talking about
[1:09:34] in the midnight hour when all hell's
[1:09:35] breaking loose around you and that
[1:09:37] little sweet something moves over your
[1:09:39] heart and you not raise the dead but
[1:09:41] raise up your hands and say God you are
[1:09:43] my help
[1:09:44] you are my stay you are my peace if you
[1:09:49] don't know what I'm talking about you're
[1:09:50] still in bondage something we don't
[1:09:53] preach too much of anymore it's good
[1:09:56] old-fashioned salvation we've got all
[1:10:00] the message believers but we don't have
[1:10:02] anybody saved
[1:10:05] we need salvation friends we need to
[1:10:09] come back to the grassroots to the
[1:10:11] bedrock principles that was laid to us
[1:10:14] the very thing that Malachi for respond
[1:10:18] and us was a relationship with Almighty
[1:10:24] God I want you listen to me I don't care
[1:10:27] how long you follow this message I don't
[1:10:30] care how long you say brother brems a
[1:10:32] prophet if you don't have a relationship
[1:10:35] you don't even know what I'm talking
[1:10:37] about tonight Amen that's just the truth
[1:10:41] now I want you to notice in this type a
[1:10:44] man that a person who is a Christian can
[1:10:48] also fall into former bondage I don't
[1:10:53] mean that a person necessarily will
[1:10:55] become worldly and you know I'm just
[1:10:58] God and I don't mean a vagabond I don't
[1:11:01] mean a blasphemer but we all can fall
[1:11:05] into little bondages and things
[1:11:07] throughout our lifetime now if you got
[1:11:10] your Bible turn me to galatians chapter
[1:11:11] 5 verse 1 for just a moment i want you
[1:11:14] to look here for just a little bit amen
[1:11:16] at what paul said about our liberty
[1:11:20] that's been given to us as christians
[1:11:23] look here in galatians 5 and verse 1 i
[1:11:25] listen i'm not going to hold you long so
[1:11:27] don't get nervous we've only got about
[1:11:29] three more hours to go so don't worry
[1:11:31] okay amen don't worry at all don't worry
[1:11:33] don't worry
[1:11:34] amen Galatians chapter five verse one
[1:11:36] now what stand fast Paul said therefore
[1:11:39] in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath
[1:11:42] made us free and be not entangled again
[1:11:46] with the yoke of bondage
[1:11:50] at first I want you to observe that Paul
[1:11:53] said we have been made free notice that
[1:11:55] made is past tense there amen not that
[1:11:59] you will be free not that you are
[1:12:01] waiting on freedom but you have already
[1:12:05] been made free oh god it was somebody
[1:12:09] help me preach right now hey man I want
[1:12:11] you to understand that much of the
[1:12:14] Liberty that you're looking for it's
[1:12:17] already been given to you you say but
[1:12:22] brother being I'm still struggling with
[1:12:23] things sure I still fight weird little
[1:12:27] different things in life sure you will
[1:12:31] don't never get it in your brain and as
[1:12:33] long as you live this earth you're gonna
[1:12:35] walk without mistakes faults and
[1:12:39] failures well praise the Lord
[1:12:43] well I figured once he got the
[1:12:45] translation some of you French speakers
[1:12:46] at home or a man I want you to
[1:12:52] understand our Liberty has already been
[1:12:56] given to us you say but I don't feel too
[1:13:02] free well it's not because you can't
[1:13:05] it's not because it's not there for you
[1:13:08] it's not that it's not accessible
[1:13:13] once you the word he uses for bondage is
[1:13:16] the condition of a slave slavery or
[1:13:20] bondage or the condition of a slave so
[1:13:22] Paul is saying Christ made you free so
[1:13:24] do not become entangled again with the
[1:13:29] yoke of bondage well you mean a
[1:13:32] Christian can become entangled or can
[1:13:35] you mean a Christian can backslide so
[1:13:37] can a Christian can make mistakes
[1:13:40] everyday sure do but that's the blood of
[1:13:45] Christ forgive me sure does it just
[1:13:50] depends on how you want to approach it
[1:13:52] now you have one or two choices this
[1:13:54] morning you can either look at the glass
[1:13:57] half-empty or you can look at it
[1:13:58] half-full it's up to you oh praise the
[1:14:05] Lord
[1:14:06] look here in Galatians chapter 5 verse
[1:14:09] 13 now just to prove to you that Paul
[1:14:12] wasn't talking to sinners for brethren
[1:14:26] brethren oh that means you too sis
[1:14:33] but I'm the Holy Ghost field Christian
[1:14:35] yeah sure right in your soul but your
[1:14:40] body's not born again your flesh still
[1:14:48] has the ability to do wrong every day
[1:14:52] they're not a man in here that's healthy
[1:14:54] and red-blooded but what could commit
[1:14:55] adultery tonight they're not a woman in
[1:14:58] this building but what couldn't go to a
[1:14:59] bar and physically get drunk every one
[1:15:03] of you have the potential to go down to
[1:15:04] the gas station get your pack of
[1:15:06] cigarettes
[1:15:08] your body is not born again your soul
[1:15:12] might be but your body ain't a man
[1:15:18] hallelujah praise the Lord now would be
[1:15:21] a good time for that push play thing
[1:15:22] wouldn't this is why some people what
[1:15:25] they don't want preaching cuz it gets
[1:15:27] right down in your lap but this is where
[1:15:29] we need if we want to get right with God
[1:15:30] and man this is what we need to be at
[1:15:33] for brother you have been called unto
[1:15:37] Liberty only use not Liberty for an
[1:15:42] occasion to the flesh but by love serve
[1:15:50] one another and the word of use is here
[1:15:53] for occasion is resources let me give
[1:15:56] you an example of this in first Timothy
[1:15:58] chapter 5 verse 14 Paul said I will
[1:16:01] therefore that the younger women marry
[1:16:03] bear children guide the house and give
[1:16:07] none occasion to the adversary to speak
[1:16:11] reproachfully and this word occasion is
[1:16:13] the same word to use it Galatians 5:13
[1:16:14] which simply means the resources so in
[1:16:17] other words as Paul is saying as a woman
[1:16:21] duty said you know bear children guide
[1:16:24] the home be chaste be sober and don't
[1:16:28] give an occasion to the devil
[1:16:30] don't give him resources
[1:16:35] everybody hang on real tight okay do you
[1:16:39] know where the devil gets most of his
[1:16:41] material from daddy uses from us us you
[1:16:50] know how it is Monday morning when you
[1:16:52] wake up oh this job I hate this job I
[1:17:02] hate this bed
[1:17:04] my back hurts me every night why does
[1:17:09] that guy start that engine
[1:17:10] every morning 5:00 a.m. that Sun hits me
[1:17:14] right in the eyes and the devil's going
[1:17:16] raaah branch branch come out I'm coming
[1:17:20] out where do y'all reckon the devil gets
[1:17:28] most of this from from us we give him
[1:17:32] all kinds of rear brace or somebody we
[1:17:39] give him all kinds of resources you know
[1:17:45] a lot of times I've learned that if the
[1:17:47] devil gets me in a corner and he thinks
[1:17:51] he's got me whupped you don't whoop this
[1:17:53] don't you it's during that time I don't
[1:17:58] let him know he's winning
[1:18:02] somebody say how your feelings it feels
[1:18:04] so good take to me to handle it how's it
[1:18:09] going have to sit on my hands keep from
[1:18:11] waving at everybody you learn whatever
[1:18:17] you say or whatever you show the devil
[1:18:21] is taking notes so Paul tells these
[1:18:26] women here he tells us in their nations
[1:18:28] 5:13 don't get the devil resources don't
[1:18:32] give him a reason to use anything
[1:18:34] against you
[1:18:37] amen watch it now first Peter chapter 2
[1:18:40] verse 15 now let's pick this up just a
[1:18:45] little bit further first Peter chapter 2
[1:18:46] verse 15 first
[1:18:49] it's a will of God that with while doing
[1:18:52] this is why he keeps smiling you may put
[1:18:58] to silence the ignorance of foolish men
[1:19:01] do you know son has brother sister that
[1:19:04] if the devil thinks he's got you if
[1:19:06] sometimes if people if they think
[1:19:09] they've upset you and you show them
[1:19:11] it feeds that spirit that's in them they
[1:19:16] can get you arguing and you argue back
[1:19:19] they'll come after you even more that's
[1:19:23] like they get joy out of seeing you show
[1:19:27] out where's the Lord resources now Paul
[1:19:37] said you are a Christian he said that's
[1:19:39] true you've got Liberty yes that's right
[1:19:41] but don't don't don't use your Liberty
[1:19:45] as an occasion to your flesh in other
[1:19:50] words we could say it like this
[1:19:52] well I'm born again it doesn't matter if
[1:19:54] I get angry at so-and-so you don't
[1:19:58] matter if I bless them out what I'm a
[1:20:05] Christian I'm going to heaven I've got
[1:20:11] the seal of God on my soul uh-huh and as
[1:20:14] a result of you having that said seal on
[1:20:17] said soul your daddy will said whip you
[1:20:20] the devil out of you if you are truly
[1:20:24] born again the Holy Ghost will not let
[1:20:26] you get away with nothing you deal with
[1:20:32] you he loves us enough to be able to
[1:20:35] deal with us every single day right but
[1:20:40] Paul said and now Peter's saying as well
[1:20:42] that with good well with well doing or
[1:20:45] good works as a free man watching number
[1:20:51] 16 and not using your liberty for a
[1:20:54] cloak of maliciousness but as the
[1:20:58] servants of God
[1:21:02] in other words don't say well I'm a
[1:21:03] Christian it don't hurt me to watch this
[1:21:05] little thing or listen to that little
[1:21:06] dealer you know I'm a believer Paul said
[1:21:15] don't use it for liberty I can lay out
[1:21:19] of church every now and then what's it
[1:21:20] gonna hurt a believer anyway well I
[1:21:25] ain't got to some of you yet but I keep
[1:21:27] digging I'll find somebody what I'm
[1:21:31] trying to tell you brother sister is
[1:21:32] that if we're not careful the devil get
[1:21:35] uses all kinds of resources against us
[1:21:37] and we fall into bondage in our own
[1:21:40] Christian walk let me ask you a question
[1:21:43] we're not gonna hold you much longer but
[1:21:45] let me ask you a question have you ever
[1:21:48] went to pray and it felt like a house
[1:21:49] was sitting on you you ever wonder why
[1:21:53] it's that way go back and look and see
[1:21:56] how much bondage you've allowed yourself
[1:21:57] to get into you've allowed grief or
[1:22:01] depression or some kind of old
[1:22:03] ridiculous thought or some kind of
[1:22:05] little thing to lay down when I say
[1:22:07] grief I don't mean like sorrow and loss
[1:22:09] but I mean grieving over life and
[1:22:11] grieving over everything and an old
[1:22:13] bitter type spirit that just grieved
[1:22:15] over the world just hate everybody and
[1:22:19] then you go into church and there by the
[1:22:23] preacher said let's raise our hands and
[1:22:24] you're okay ain't got enough stamina to
[1:22:30] hardly hold your hands up five minutes
[1:22:34] you're in bondage you don't realize
[1:22:36] you're in bondage you need the freedom
[1:22:40] there's a trumpet blowing right now
[1:22:43] and if you listen to what I'm saying to
[1:22:46] you you'll understand that you don't
[1:22:48] have to wait for freedom to come freedom
[1:22:52] is already here Paul said don't use your
[1:22:56] Liberty as a cloak you're not some
[1:22:58] people are when they get ready to really
[1:23:01] lay it on you you know how they do my
[1:23:03] precious brother oh look out it's coming
[1:23:09] down the pike I guarantee it well we
[1:23:13] know what the prophet of God
[1:23:18] you know that is that's using their
[1:23:20] liberty as a cloak a cloak of
[1:23:22] maliciousness hey if you got something
[1:23:25] to say don't be a snake about it be
[1:23:28] honest about it with love considering
[1:23:31] yourself also that you might be in the
[1:23:33] same spot down the road
[1:23:34] hey everybody knows how to handle
[1:23:36] everybody else's business but you need
[1:23:38] to make sure you sweep your own steps
[1:23:40] oh god y'all getting acquired are we
[1:23:44] gonna become the Methodists in here hey
[1:23:47] come on preach to me a little bit now
[1:23:49] Amen you understand what I'm trying to
[1:23:51] tell you as a child of God we fall into
[1:23:54] little bondages every single day and a
[1:24:00] lot of times it starts the moment our
[1:24:02] eyes go blink blink we'll wake up first
[1:24:07] thing in the morning you put your dress
[1:24:09] on and your dress don't fit right you're
[1:24:11] aggravated about that your brother's put
[1:24:14] your shoe on and you kick that table
[1:24:16] when you're going to put your shoe on
[1:24:20] you know what I'm talking about you
[1:24:21] walking down like mine you go to the end
[1:24:23] of the bed and you who I am I'm trying
[1:24:24] to get your shoes and then you start
[1:24:29] complaining yeah if it's gonna happen
[1:24:31] anybody's going to happen to me you're
[1:24:34] falling into bondage is every single day
[1:24:36] and you don't realize it amen let me
[1:24:40] give you an example in numbers chapter
[1:24:41] 19 verses 1 & 2 now this actual what
[1:24:46] this says here is not necessarily
[1:24:48] anything about the sacrifice and what
[1:24:50] moral as pertaining to this message but
[1:24:52] the main part I want you to see is about
[1:24:55] this yoke numbers 19 verse 1 the Lord
[1:24:58] spoke to Moses and Aaron saying this is
[1:25:00] the ordinance of the law which the LORD
[1:25:02] commanded saying speak unto the children
[1:25:05] of Israel that they may bring the red
[1:25:07] heifer without spot wearing this no
[1:25:08] blemish which is great now that that's
[1:25:10] not the main part but this is what I
[1:25:11] want you to see and upon which never
[1:25:14] came yolk now brother Branham tells us
[1:25:20] in a message Christ this has a great
[1:25:24] meaning he says he said
[1:25:28] meant that Christ was not yoked up to
[1:25:31] anything I want to ask you a question
[1:25:37] some of you young people sitting here
[1:25:39] are you yoked to what mommy and daddies
[1:25:42] talk to you about religion or do you
[1:25:45] have your own revelation some of you
[1:25:51] wives do you follow your husband just
[1:25:53] because he's a message believer or do
[1:25:56] you have your own revelation some of you
[1:25:59] husbands do you have your own revelation
[1:26:02] or do you just follow it because she's
[1:26:03] in it what's the reason you serve the
[1:26:09] Lord today because of you serving for
[1:26:13] any other reason than because you love
[1:26:17] him then you are under a yoke you are
[1:26:23] bound to a denominational spirit listen
[1:26:29] brother a denomination don't have to say
[1:26:30] Methodists and Baptists and
[1:26:31] Presbyterians be a denomination to be a
[1:26:34] denomination all you have to do is be
[1:26:36] organized some families have their own
[1:26:41] private or denominations the husband's
[1:26:45] will force those kids and force that
[1:26:47] woman you're gonna gotta charge from me
[1:26:49] or else you know what happens down the
[1:26:52] road or else is what happens them
[1:26:55] because if they don't have their own
[1:26:57] revelation if you force them in
[1:27:00] something else will force them out
[1:27:03] it's a denominational spirit amen I'm
[1:27:07] not gonna hold you long amen some of
[1:27:12] y'all are Wiggly I know why you're
[1:27:13] Wiggly because this is uncomfortable but
[1:27:16] it's good I want you to be a little
[1:27:17] uncomfortable we need to be thinking
[1:27:19] about what we're doing on a daily basis
[1:27:22] don't you agree we need to look at our
[1:27:24] daily walk with God that we can fall
[1:27:27] into these little bondages all the time
[1:27:30] why don't the church have the victory
[1:27:33] like it should brother band said it like
[1:27:38] this he talked about the Little Crow
[1:27:39] called him Johnny crow
[1:27:42] and he said he had a rope tied to his
[1:27:45] leg you go ten foot that way ten foot
[1:27:48] that way ten foot that way ten foot that
[1:27:50] way but after a while the farmer felt
[1:27:55] sorry for that little bird they cut the
[1:27:58] rope off his leg and that little bird
[1:28:02] still went ten foot that way ten foot
[1:28:04] that way ten foot that way ten foot like
[1:28:06] you know the problem was he didn't
[1:28:09] realize that he was free he still
[1:28:17] thought he was under the yoke of bondage
[1:28:21] do you know how many people through the
[1:28:24] years I've seen backslide leave God walk
[1:28:30] away from church altogether because they
[1:28:36] thought they were bound and could not be
[1:28:40] free you hear him talk about it I'll
[1:28:45] never get Liberty that's the thing you
[1:28:47] don't understand that's what I'm trying
[1:28:49] to preach to you this morning you don't
[1:28:51] have to look for a moment where you get
[1:28:54] Liberty you only have to wrath Liberty
[1:28:59] has already been offered to you you're
[1:29:04] already free you just don't realize it
[1:29:10] little further let's quit in questions
[1:29:13] actually brother Emma's asked a question
[1:29:15] now this individual we don't know if
[1:29:17] it's a man or a woman or ever who it is
[1:29:20] but when they have brother bent on this
[1:29:24] question I want you to listen out the
[1:29:27] way the Prophet answers this okay
[1:29:30] brother BAM I've lived many years in sin
[1:29:33] until I found the Lord
[1:29:36] please brother Branham I have sinned
[1:29:38] again and I'm not worthy to come before
[1:29:41] you in this holy place please tell me if
[1:29:45] I can be restored again please help me
[1:29:48] brother Bentham I have a devil in me
[1:29:50] help me he says or she and then asked
[1:29:55] what
[1:29:55] lay your hands upon me and restore me
[1:29:57] again I said here's a question I never
[1:30:00] noticed it a while ago he said but if
[1:30:02] you're president never who the person is
[1:30:04] let me read it to you rereads it again
[1:30:06] he said now you have not sinned he said
[1:30:09] yes
[1:30:09] you've not send my friends so far in God
[1:30:11] but what you could be restored if you
[1:30:15] had sin so far that you could not be
[1:30:18] restored listen you would never want to
[1:30:26] be restored what did you do prophet of
[1:30:35] God break into a vision know what you do
[1:30:39] brother Branham use discernment know
[1:30:43] what doctrine did you pull out of the
[1:30:45] Bible to diagnose this case he didn't
[1:30:51] you know how I knew this individual had
[1:30:53] not sinned so far that God was done with
[1:30:57] him because the individual himself
[1:31:00] wanted to be restored will tell you
[1:31:04] something rather you may not respect
[1:31:07] what I'm getting ready to say to you
[1:31:08] doesn't matter to me one way or another
[1:31:09] it's up to you this is in your lap not
[1:31:11] mine but at the end of the day if you
[1:31:14] don't want to be here you might as well
[1:31:16] just go and get out sitting on the fence
[1:31:23] ain't gonna do you no good
[1:31:25] God will respect you a whole lot more if
[1:31:27] you just leave the church altogether
[1:31:29] don't be a hypocrite
[1:31:32] don't be lukewarm it makes him sick if
[1:31:36] you don't want to be here if there's
[1:31:39] nothing in your that makes you want to
[1:31:41] be a Christian you might as well go on
[1:31:44] out if you want to be a Christian then
[1:31:51] you better run as hard as you can oh
[1:31:54] that got you a little bit didn't it
[1:31:57] there is no middle ground
[1:32:00] if you're lukewarm God said it makes me
[1:32:03] sick to my stomach makes me want to spew
[1:32:06] you out of my mouth that means vomit
[1:32:09] it makes God sick when people come to
[1:32:12] church and don't really want to be here
[1:32:17] are we digging this morning sister Ruby
[1:32:24] why are you here are you in church this
[1:32:28] morning because something inside of you
[1:32:31] compels you I got to know more about him
[1:32:34] I got to get closer to God I gotta know
[1:32:40] a deeper I got to have a deeper
[1:32:42] experience it's not like that brother
[1:32:48] listen to me
[1:32:49] if it ain't like that you're on your way
[1:32:51] out anyways so why not hasten it and
[1:32:57] just be honest how many churches do you
[1:33:01] go to around the ranks to this message
[1:33:03] and you walk around you look at the
[1:33:04] people in the churches you ask them when
[1:33:06] they got saved asking when they got to
[1:33:08] hold it goes well I believe the message
[1:33:12] I didn't ask you that I asked when you
[1:33:14] got born again the devil believes a
[1:33:17] message I asked you when you had the
[1:33:20] Holy Ghost if you got it then you should
[1:33:26] know when you got it or at least know
[1:33:29] when you met Jesus would he give it to
[1:33:30] you whoo come on church preach to me how
[1:33:36] many people are in bondage sitting in
[1:33:38] churches today souls in prison the only
[1:33:43] reason they sit on the pews is because
[1:33:45] it's a religious feeling and to them
[1:33:48] brother the message as far as the
[1:33:49] message goes it's just something that
[1:33:51] will keep them out of hell it's like a
[1:33:52] fire escape on a house if it's that way
[1:33:58] something's gonna take you out anyways
[1:34:01] don't stand in the meadow choose you
[1:34:05] this day whom but why did this
[1:34:10] individual here why hi what brand-new I
[1:34:17] didn't meet with him and have a
[1:34:18] conference tell me
[1:34:21] life story he was able to judge upon the
[1:34:27] desire of this individual wanting to be
[1:34:29] right and by that he was able to say
[1:34:35] everything's gonna be okay
[1:34:39] he's gone
[1:34:41] you've not sinned so far my friend so
[1:34:44] far in God but what you could not be
[1:34:46] restored he said but as long as there is
[1:34:48] that something dealing with your heart
[1:34:50] you're still in the line of restoration
[1:34:53] you know what that tells me that tells
[1:34:55] me no matter how much bondage I fall in
[1:34:57] no matter how many problems I have no
[1:34:59] matter how many downfalls and downturns
[1:35:02] I experience if there is something
[1:35:04] inside of my heart I can keep on
[1:35:09] fighting brother Keith I can keep on
[1:35:12] walking I can keep on moving forward
[1:35:16] stand with me I love this brother BAM
[1:35:26] who said you wouldn't even want to be
[1:35:27] that way or you wouldn't even ask this
[1:35:29] question
[1:35:31] he said that itself is proof that God's
[1:35:34] dealing with you he said you've probably
[1:35:36] gotten nervous the devil lyin to you
[1:35:38] telling you couldn't be restored he said
[1:35:41] but he's lying to you certainly is it's
[1:35:44] because look is there's a deep calling
[1:35:46] there's got to be a deep respond to the
[1:35:48] call listen to me again this what I'm
[1:35:54] preaching to you goes far beyond push
[1:35:56] play and obey this what I'm preaching to
[1:36:01] you goes far beyond set in a church in
[1:36:03] here in a guy preach this what I'm
[1:36:06] talking about goes beyond you reading
[1:36:07] your Bible day in and day out you could
[1:36:10] have it marked in yellow and purple and
[1:36:12] green and orange and every other color
[1:36:13] in there what I'm talking about goes
[1:36:16] beyond having a message picture of
[1:36:18] brother Branham on your wall this goes
[1:36:21] beyond having all of the little cliches
[1:36:24] and the catch phrases memorized what I'm
[1:36:29] talking about is real freedom
[1:36:34] I sure hope there's people in here today
[1:36:36] that want real freedom because if you do
[1:36:42] it's here for you
[1:36:44] you don't even have to wait for it let
[1:36:48] me tell you what brother brems said a
[1:36:50] pardon is not a pardon until when but
[1:36:58] you missed the main part until you
[1:37:01] receive it not just as a pardon but it's
[1:37:06] yours and yours and yours and yours
[1:37:11] because until you can look into the
[1:37:14] world and realize this message is what
[1:37:17] made me free
[1:37:19] this Bible the revelation of this Bible
[1:37:22] is what made me free Christ blood at
[1:37:25] Calvary is what made me free well listen
[1:37:30] carefully what good does even the blood
[1:37:33] of Jesus Christ do for you
[1:37:35] if you are not willing to receive it as
[1:37:41] your own personal possession some of you
[1:37:48] under conviction some of you're standing
[1:37:51] there saying god help me that's good
[1:37:57] because if we have the ability to feel
[1:38:02] that something inside of us then we also
[1:38:06] have the ability to return to our
[1:38:09] freedom one more remark in let's pray
[1:38:12] the jubilee trumpet is sounded I don't
[1:38:16] care what your background looks like I
[1:38:18] don't care what your past is look like I
[1:38:21] don't care what your present looks like
[1:38:22] I don't care what your future looks like
[1:38:27] the trumpet has been sounded in the last
[1:38:29] day why are people still in the bondage
[1:38:34] though it's just through be there in 30
[1:38:37] years of you and I and Isaiah and this
[1:38:39] family we've been through thick and thin
[1:38:41] 30 years knowing can you imagine we've
[1:38:45] seen it all and done it all
[1:38:47] why the people I'm preaching to still
[1:38:49] not where they need to be why do some of
[1:38:52] them still struggle with all kinds of
[1:38:54] things I'll tell you what the answer is
[1:38:57] it ain't push play and obey it ain't
[1:39:01] open up a scripture and read a bunch of
[1:39:02] scriptures I'm not throwing off on
[1:39:06] nobody I'm just trying to say those
[1:39:09] aren't our answers because let me tell
[1:39:11] you something we could start service
[1:39:13] today and I could say open your Bible
[1:39:14] Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created
[1:39:18] the heavens there six hours later I
[1:39:21] could be sitting the final a man on the
[1:39:23] book of Revelation you know what would
[1:39:25] happen you'd sit there and fall asleep
[1:39:31] but you say so where to God yes but what
[1:39:34] makes that word powerful is it when it's
[1:39:38] read or heard but when it's received oh
[1:39:43] god I hope somebody's hearing me this
[1:39:45] morning that's the problem many of the
[1:39:48] charges they have said it they have told
[1:39:51] it and the people have listened to it
[1:39:54] but they still aren't free why why in a
[1:40:02] message church will we have to preach
[1:40:03] against so many things still because
[1:40:07] people will not receive it as a party
[1:40:16] god help us let's pray
[1:40:23] Lord Jesus we thank you so much this
[1:40:26] morning for your Lord I'm not trying to
[1:40:31] be rude I'm trying to get a point across
[1:40:35] Lord in the years Lord you've allowed me
[1:40:40] to travel and preach I can think of
[1:40:45] hundreds of cases where I've watched
[1:40:49] people who seemingly would have would
[1:40:54] have been real Christians but over a
[1:41:00] matter of time little things got in the
[1:41:02] way life got in the way before they knew
[1:41:09] it Lord
[1:41:11] they doesn't quit God altogether why it
[1:41:16] wasn't in their heart to begin with
[1:41:20] father that's the problem if we sit
[1:41:25] around these churches and fool ourselves
[1:41:26] and pretend we're never going to get
[1:41:30] anywhere with you
[1:41:32] so God help each one of us this morning
[1:41:35] not to be pretenders help us to be
[1:41:39] brutally honest with ourselves that you
[1:41:44] by your grace could help us become real
[1:41:46] Christians Grennan Lord in Jesus name
[1:41:52] with your heads bowed just a moment I
[1:41:55] wonder if there be somebody here this
[1:41:57] morning I'd like to be honest before the
[1:42:00] Lord you're standing here and you're
[1:42:04] saying brother bin I know what you're
[1:42:06] saying is the truth
[1:42:08] and I certainly want to be restored back
[1:42:13] I wonder would you be willing to raise
[1:42:16] your hand to the Lord this morning and
[1:42:17] say I'm in that shape I'm in that
[1:42:21] condition and I want to be restored back
[1:42:24] God bless the hands that are going up
[1:42:26] anybody else would like to raise their
[1:42:27] hand I'm not where I need to be with the
[1:42:31] Lord I've fallen into bondage I don't
[1:42:36] pray
[1:42:36] like I used to I don't read the Bible
[1:42:37] like I used to I don't have the feeling
[1:42:40] of my heart toward others like I used to
[1:42:44] but God I'm asking this morning that
[1:42:46] you'll help me return to freedom
[1:42:49] remember little Johnny crow you don't
[1:42:52] have to wait on the farmer to cut the
[1:42:54] rope the Rope has already been cut if I
[1:42:58] was to say a percentage it looked to me
[1:43:01] like 70% of the audience raised their
[1:43:04] hand this morning
[1:43:05] maybe you out there on the internet that
[1:43:07] will catch this broadcast maybe you'd be
[1:43:09] out there and you'd say to yourself
[1:43:10] whether being I'm in that shape if
[1:43:12] you're in your living room or in your
[1:43:13] car or wherever you are why don't you
[1:43:14] just raise your hand to the Lord when
[1:43:15] you get this message I'd like to hold
[1:43:18] his spirit I want to pray for all of you
[1:43:20] right now and let the Holy Spirit fall
[1:43:22] fresh on you this morning I want you to
[1:43:25] listen to me church it's not about how
[1:43:28] loud I pray over you it's not about how
[1:43:30] loud I scream up here that's not what
[1:43:32] produces the results what's going to
[1:43:35] make the difference in you this morning
[1:43:37] is you receiving it in your heart and
[1:43:42] saying Lord Jesus I received my pardon
[1:43:45] this morning oh I feel the Holy Ghost -

[1:46:09] listen with the prophet of God said he
[1:46:11] said surest bread sister brother every
[1:46:13] who you are I lay hands on you but that
[1:46:16] wouldn't free you not even the Prophet
[1:46:20] laying his hands on him would bring
[1:46:22] freedom he said but what would for you
[1:46:26] is to understand that you're already
[1:46:27] free Christ hath made you free I could
[1:46:36] lay hands on people week in and week out
[1:46:39] but still it wouldn't do any good until
[1:46:42] you accept what Christ has done for you
[1:46:46] even brother Branham said if Jesus was
[1:46:49] standing here this morning with this
[1:46:51] suit of clothes on he couldn't heal you
[1:46:53] he couldn't save you he couldn't deliver
[1:46:55] you he said the only thing he could do

[1:46:59] and say you must accept it you must be
[1:47:04] even you must receive it Oh hallelujah
