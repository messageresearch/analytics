stand we're going to come from Jeremiah again Jeremiah the first chapter there will come from Jeremiah the second chapter those of you who were here on Wednesday we preached on the message the cry of God's heart and we just kind of want to pick up again and move with it by God's grace I believe that we're living in the last days I believe that many people are forgetting the reason why you were called the voice of Matthew 25 tells us that that we there was a bridegroom that called our virgins and I really believe that many of us have forgotten what this message have called us to and I believe that if we're not careful we may be endangering our souls or endangering ourselves to missing the rapture so let us go to Jeremiah the first chapter we'll read there at the 16th verse of that first chapter Jeremiah 116 you see brother Balaam when he left he left us a word a message and that message itself is Jesus Christ if you don't see Jesus Christ you missed the message and for Jeremiah 116 and I will out of my judgment against them touching all their wickedness who have forsaken me and have burned it sent unto other gods and worship the works of their hands Jeremiah 2:19 dine own wickedness shall corrupt thee and thy backsliding shall reprove thee know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou forsaken the LORD thy God and that my fear is not in thee and the Lord God saith the Lord God of hosts let us pray Lord we come before your Lord is humbly as we know how Lord we pray that you move us out of ourselves and we pray that you would move within us father we pray that you would speak to your people hallelujah speak to me I need you Jesus give us your grace and your mercy Lord we do believe with all of our heart that you were here this morning because you said where two or three are gathered in your name you're there in the missing forgive us and cleanse us from anything that we may have done that would hinder the service hinder the message father speak to your hearts of your people we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated one of the things that really caught my attention this morning was the very fact of one of the events that is happening out in California you see often time we feel safe and secure when we don't really know what tomorrow will bring sometimes we forget that we are children of God and we've come to make the world know that Jesus Christ lives and we we just want to say by God's grace that when it comes to respect that you and I we forget as I said on the other day Wednesday night we look at me we look at brother Brooks and sometimes we forget who's really standing in the pulpit we we we fail to see the God hides himself behind human flesh and so therefore we don't fear one another and fear is not what I want you to do when it comes to me but you ought to fear the God that I serve there's an event that just took place the other day in California and a fire and some of you may have heard about the fire started out as a campfire it went in destroyed towns this fire did but I I want to read something that these elderly people said who were trapped in this fire and God allowed them to escape this place was known for its beauty and he says on the main road that locals affectionately called the sky way to paradise and many of those trapped in the nerve-racking slow-motion evacuation Thursday morning their prayers I'm sorry that day that morning their prayers and I'm sure they prayed and they wondered is this the end the one couple said I thought this must be what hell is going to be the this was the 87 year old person says Beverly feel more who drove out of paradise with her 91 year old husband Jim they said we were going to be create cremated when we die but I thought this is it I'm going to be cremated right now and this is when I die all I could think about was the unexpected the unexpected always get us things that we don't expect when we later Lahey's and I and that's when troubles come and here were people trapped in their cars trying to escape and the fire the wind shifted and many of them died in the fire in their car trying to escape on a road that led to sky way to paradise nothing happens by chance God ordains everything but in our minds we sometimes think that we are beyond retribution beyond chastisement sometimes we think that God don't see us it is so amazing because we have had our example I think some we forget that God has feelings we become like Israel God don't care God don't see and I'm gonna get away with it remember brother Branham had the spirit of Elijah and that light that spirit also was a spirit of judgment Elijah gave Jezebel her judgment God gave Jezebel space to repent and she would not repent God will give you space to repent we did not come to establish a church and one of the things that God even wants all of us to see is that he wants us united with him Oh has failed us yo flesh will fail you but we must realize that God gets tired you say he doesn't he gets weary of repenting that's what you prophesy God gets weary of repenting we realize that brother Bantam even talked on the level of Hebrew 10 when you cross that line of no repentance when you have continually go in the way of air and God has continually warned you about it and you continually fail to repent God said he'd give you over to a reprobate mind many of us fail to see that God took Israel and used her as an example when God chose us as bride he chose us to have a love affair this message is not to be a burden it is to be an affair with God it is to be in such a union with him that you could feel him you could you would know his desires for you before we even speak you would know what he wants from you every prophet was the cry of God in the days of Noah when God tried to get the people to repent they would not they found so many things to do they loved pleasure they loved prosperity they loved everything that God was able to supply them with but they didn't love God my question is do you love him where is your heart where is your love for him that you would do anything for him can you feel what he's feeling to know that he sent Malachi for the Elijah for our day and we can't hardly see the results of that message a super Church a supernatural Church a church in his very image a church in his very likeness brother Branham said it'll be a wonder if this many out of this age would make it 10 people would make it out of this 8 which of these are you and if he said it there must be a reality to it look at all the people now that we have claiming to follow Malachi 4 or the message that he brought but how many of us sitting here this morning really know Jesus we know his name we may even know his position with God we may know him as a slave he he came to save you but is he yours the you and I must realize I'm just gonna have to quote this you and I must realize Amen that God word will not change for you God's Word will not change for me we say the rapture is coming and yet we've got ministers building big buildings and big programs and all of these things it has gotten so bad that people are confused of what the message really is the message is not books and tapes the message is you it starts out on books and tapes but if you don't eat it if you don't consume it and if it comes apart of you you must become the message that's why we have preachers so they can catch the inspiration of God is that right God said every by the way of the Prophet God said every modern day preacher is a prophet he's not a major one but he's a prophet what is he doing resounding what has already been said but putting it in a place that you can digest it that you can get the revelation of what he's saying I had to say God interprets his own word by bringing it to pass so my question is what is God bringing to pass in your life some intellectual concept just knowing the message I know what he said but are you living what he said he read about knowing the devil knows what he's saying it's about living what he said many we look we see something's happening in the spirit this thing is turning and a lot of us don't even see it we're too busy too distracted with all kinds of things is that right and there the Bible says in the day of Noah they were eating drinking being married giving him that what was those things they were distractions it wasn't anything wrong with those things is God wants you to have joy God wants you to have peace God wants you to get married but with those speeds become prioritize and above God he's not happy with it divine healing brother Ellen said this he that sins willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no sacrifice for sin Hebrews 10 I believe right is that sin willfully he that sins willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a fearful looking forward the fire to the judgment and fierce indignation which shall devour the adversaries my question my thought my thought is this you and I know that we will not make a rapture i'ma go tear without the Holy Ghost people said well how do I get it listen to the Word of God amen the prophet of God a priest I don't know how many times God provided way you want to know how to get it go listen but you don't listen just to gain knowledge you listen to act upon what you've heard hello if we had the Holy Ghost like we say we have we wouldn't have the problems that we say we had divine love is what we must reach how many of you how many of us can say we have it how many of us are trying to press into that statue of Christ where we're totally dead and rot and God is living in us or are we trying to cause division now he that what willfully he that sins and what is sin unbelief he that will turn his back on truth when it's presented to him they remain normal sacrifice for sin did you ever read that like that see he that disbelieved willfully at the truth at been presented to him because his church believe different that's when you cross the line he that seems willfully after he has received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice divine healing in 1954 now he's calling out his crying out to the church people you weren't here some of you weren't here wisdom brother man take this message did not come to shake the world it came to shake the church it came to shake the church and there is a shaking right now there is a shaking and if there is a shaking what's coming next what's coming next we sit here and we carry on and we really religiously come the church but that ain't it there are thousands of 1000s of so-called Christian that goes to church faithfully and they're going to miss this rapture God want a relationship God wants out of you out of you out of me God wants a love affair he doesn't want this religious stuff we handing him is that right the Bible said that even Israel religiously gave God what he requires and it was stench in his nostrils it made him sick but because it was religiously done God don't need your religion God wants your love hallelujah did you know that you be a prostitute without ever prostituting your physical body brother madam says listen he said prostitutions don't mean sexually every time you can prostitute your time you can prostitute your faith go out and join some cult or some old former Church you're a prostitute wait a minute he used the term formal church so if it's formal it means God ain't there huh if this formal that means God is not there because we're the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty we don't need Foreman formality in this place I'd rather see a wire fire than no fire at all that's the way God is weed this is not a classroom this is where God shows up you are see he said this is some old former church he said you're a prostitute you are you're just as guilty as she was but the same Lord Jesus that forgave her has the same pleading mercy for you tonight oh I tell you the truth we come in here and there's no joy what's wrong with the people joy is something you bring to God but we always come in like like like takers all we want to do is take from God God I need this Encarta need that and God I need that and we cannot even give God our worship or thank you into his gates with Thanksgiving into his courts with what praise the hard cry what was it those prophets heard and they felt God they knew what God was feeling because God and the property became one have you ever heard the message washing Jesus feet hallelujah or the unwelcome ha ha hey man God was crying through that prophet overwhelmed because he shows up for church and we won't even wash his feet how do you wash his feet by glorify Him your praising you you break up hallelujah you just let your emotions go with the love of God is that right you have to break through the crowd sometime you can't worry about how everybody else is seating I gotta be careful I'm trying good but we must pray through this is not a group this is not a group that God is redeeming God redeems individuals and somehow you must break through this formality overwhelm you Solomon 1 2 2 4 he says let me kiss let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is better than why because of the Savior of that good audience thy name is as ointment poured forth therefore do the Virgin's love being it doesn't seem like some starchy farmer church is going on here it seems like a relationship a fellowship and an intoxication is going on hallelujah stirred up by his presence that's the kind of relationship God wants did you know the Bible says kiss the son lest he be angry what do you mean kiss the son you better you better get this Holy Ghost or he gonna be angry draw be we were run after be the King have brought me into his chambers he will be glad and rejoice indeed we will remember thy love and more than wine the upright love thee now when the lassie brought you into his chambers or have you ever been there when God brings you into his chambers nothing else matters time doesn't matter how long I pray doesn't matter who's looking at me he doesn't matter nothing matters cuz you're caught up into that inspiration you caught up into that love hallelujah and all you want to do is please him why the Bible said it's my beloved hallelujah see we seek everything but him Jeremiah was a weeping prophet and God used him because God told Jeremiah I'm going to have you preaching and nobody is going to repent I've got a church Jeremiah for you but I've got a judge I'm just right and I've got a warning just right because I can't bring my judgments out the warning and Jeremiah I want you to preach it with all you've got spare not and cry loud right don't be afraid of their faces see when you begin to love souls like God love souls when you can feel God you began to witness the people and said don't you know the Lord is soon to come there used to be a time Amen that we we would commune with God on our beds y'all remember that do you remember how God was so precious to you that you almost couldn't go to sleep without thinking about him their time scripture would run through my head and you know that the very fact that I love God till I couldn't even sleep sometimes yeah the pray Lord just let me get a little bit to sleep I've gotta go to work now we don't even think about it we get on our knees thank you Jesus for today amen when we crawl in the bed all we say Lord I've been busy all day I'm so tired just let me lay in here and pray help us Jesus we need help the scripture said we used to meditate meditate Dave said I meditate on him both day and night I think about his goodness both day and night I can't get to where her water but God helped me this morning cuz when Jeremiah was weeping he realized that all that preaching nobody was going to repent because God told him to told him so I will have you preaching to ask if me hard hearted people matter of fact they have crossed the line my judgment is already set for them I'm seeing the king from the north his name Amen he come and it'll be Babylon Nebuchadnezzar remember prophesied for years to come but there would be nobody that will repent not even the preachers reaches it is to preach us that causes the people to air it is to lead us because they they more concerned about your money and your possesses in the tons building give me three give me two people that really love God and will shake the city we don't need all of this God don't need all where two or three are gathered I'm in the Miss we don't you got a favor by coming to church you don't do me a favor by coming to church you should come the trucks because you love God and you love him with all your heart people you say what brother will do being rough my point is this is later than you think Psalms 101 24 2 to 4 sorry Psalms 101 imma be second to the fourth verse I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way all when thou come unto me I will walk within my house with a perfect heart I will set no wicked things before mine I will help me Jesus internet TV no wicked thing hallelujah pornography no wicked thing I will set no weak I want to behave myself perfectly did you know the Bible says that if we have pleasure in those that do these evil deeds we are as guilty as they help us Jesus the point is we're all guilty of something and we all need to repent we all need to make right with God if you want to see God move you got to get right with God Paul a brother Brooks remember there was a story I can't recall exactly how it was but the Prophet tells us about how this lady came up to brother Branham and said brother Branham your message was so good that he didn't didn't he you didn't even touch me yeah and after the lady left there's another sister standing by and she said the brother Brandon the reason why your message didn't touch her is because you didn't preach on gossip says she was one of the biggest gossips around but you didn't hit that and that's exactly what people do they point fingers and they failed to see they got issues - the Bible said we all have come shot at the glory of God we need Jesus I need Jesus y'all be honest now with the amount of messages we have heard we should have taken a rapture by now you know it's true by the amount of messages we have heard preachers preach we should have taken a rapture by now hello what is the reason the Bible says they fell in the wilderness because the word they heard was not mixed with faith we still got people struggling with faith see if you get the Holy Ghost you won't have to worry about it the Holy Ghost is God and when God comes into you it's no longer your faith because you're dead it's his thing the just shall live by his faith not something here this is not his faith his faith is in you you become the faith of God that's why the Bible said all things are possible to them that believe cuz God cannot doubt his word hey but that's where the problem is Satan getting us with our eyes the things that we see the wicked things we look upon hello is that Alright listen he goes on and said a four word hard shell depart from me I will not know a wicked person you know God said I will not know a wicked person how would we've done great things in your name but you are a wicked person coming from the message it wasn't so from the beginning he said I feel sorry for people today many thousands of people in this nation that belongs to dozens of different churches trying to find where Jesus is they go down to one certain Church and they check their they go to another Church and they check their they find out that something's wrong they don't act like and believe like and worship life and there's no sound of the king in the camp yes we says there's no joy that's the sound when the king is in the camp hallelujah sure is in the cap when the King is that right even when Jesus rolled into Jerusalem on a donkey the people got excited hallelujah holds down a whole Santa blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord and when I see y'all faces and there's no joy in your camp I realized that Jesus is not in your camp at the moment hallelujah I might say this if there was one thing I find in Pentecostal people that makes me believe that they are certainly outstanding Christians it's not because of their speaking with tongues or the sign of divine healing it's the joy that they have they just have no embarrassment they just let down their hair and start to rejoicing because they've got something hallelujah they're not a shame that makes me believe that there's something else thing about them they're not a shame they just as soon as shout out there in the street as they would hear in the church and if a hundred people were laughing at them that wouldn't stop them a bit up there continue on shouting joy for when one mission fails stars - excuse me find them on the mission fields starve to death almost now what listen see because even a when they hungry they still happy find them on the mission field starved to death almost I've seen them with no shoes on their feet living off of about 30 cents a week preaching the gospel brother just as happy as you are coming to a church in a limousine they are happy but they found something that means more than creed or domination or church affiliation they found it takes to be they found what it takes to be to bring joy and a Christian should be happy we were we were praying for that our joy might be full is something about it that's real now now if we've lost the job we've lost the things and we can't find them among our kindred we can't find them then there's one thing to do is to go back where we left him at hallelujah the church should go back to the beginning where they left him and that's exactly what Mary and Joseph did they loved Jesus at the feast of Pentecost and that's where Mary and Joseph left Jesus y'all understand me so listen you say I love him it was it was a death sentence to come into the presence of the king without the joy you could not come into the presence of the king being sad hallelujah often time God is mistaken because when God have confidence in you guess what he does send you through trials Oh God why me but not you you said Lord I want to be just like you like I said the other night but the venom tells a story about this young boy and he was following his daddy and his daddy was drunk and and he was just staggering like this and and then the daddy looked around and he saw his son what was the son doing following his daddy's footsteps hello and you and I must realize if we're gonna follow Christ the steps must be straight he said don't look to the left nor to the right keep your eye like a flint know that God has sent you here for a purpose but how would anybody this is what people uh there's a church of their ankeny adding on you rarely see a Catholic Church add-on or a Methodist Church anything this form will usually stay the way it is because it's dead can't get no farmer than a dead man he may look good he may even smell good whatever the case may be but he's dead my point is let me put it this way how many people you have run to Christ since you've been a Christian you come for reproduction you the woman hello and you must reproduce Christ not just in yourself but there must be enough of him to bring another one and another one and another one that's what you're here for not just enjoy the feast but you are here by God's grace to reproduce Christ on earth Jesus I'm gonna be too much longer but I want to say this by God's but I'm not done with this God is weeping if God could weep he will be weeping look what happened there at Lazarus look who came running to Mary oh Jesus Mary and Martha who had been spent plenty of time with him seeing the miracles understood him hallelujah and they still came not believing Lord if you had been here see brother Branham said they they had the right approach because God don't have to explain anything to us but they had the right approach y'all better listen to what I'm saying y'all people let me say like this this is America and Americans can't handle it I see the devil he meant sweeping people away hallelujah cuz you're not used to these demons these demons don't play these y'all better understand America has the worst demons in all the world she might have some riches but i'ma tell you something she's got demons from Sodom and Gomorrah she's got demons from NORs day she's got all those ant alluvion demons yeah y'all better get some Holy Ghost you better get God on the inside because if you don't get God on the inside Satan is gonna wipe your way like a flood you see how these fires demolish this so-called paradise maybe you think you're on the road a paradise but judgment came at an unexpected time by way of a wind so when God have confidence in you Oh Church don't you see where you made your mistake you've been born again but you did it daily in the world so you'll be born again but you did it daily in the world and the things of the world and God can't put confidence in you hello that's the reason great gifts are not in the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostal and message I put that one on there it's because the character of the church it hasn't been pleasing to the Father I know this is hard but it's the truth let the great ransom Church of God straighten itself up and start back to believing in God the way they ought to and live like they ought to you'll see God come on the scene with everything he promised is that right break down the barriers and come in have fellowship and reason and love and preach and serve the Lord and see what will take place time-tested the Christians must be tested every son that comes to God must be first child trained tested when you go to build a building you test the material that you put in it when the great dam was built around you Jarrod you're out Jeff Lemire for the flood they tested every once tested every ounce of the dirt that winning that damn to see if it would stand the waters excuse me in God tells his children with trials and troubles tribulations to find out if they are truly his children the Bible said if we can't stand chastisement then we'll illegitimate children and not the children of God now notice then when the testing time come and they could stand the test I love that old song that people used to sing through many dangers toils and snares I have already come it was grace that brought me safe thus far and grace will take me off and then when the sons have had the order of adoption I say it like this his name was just as good on the cheque as his father's was he had anything that he wished the Bible said seek ye first the kingdom of God and it's righteousness and all of these other things will be given you said what brother books are done crying out and I don't cry out and ain't got it yet cuz you cried out and hope God ain't giving you the Holy Ghost when you crying out in hope boulder you come this is my day this is my hour I'm gonna get it don't make no appointments with nobody else but Jesus himself I don't care how long it take I don't care how long it takes I'm gonna get this Holy Ghost I don't necessarily have to speak in tongues I don't have to shout but when I get up off my knees I know I got it I know there's been a change is that all right what if you came in this room and I had a book of war bucket of water with me and I took that book water and threw it on you you would automatically know you've had a change and that's just in the natural you can't tell me if it a bucket of spiritual waters knock you come down on you there is no way you can walk away and not know there's a change beloved y'all mind if I get this one more scripture beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits where they were of God because many false prophets are come out into the world hereby know ye the Spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is the spirit of Antichrist we're about you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world let me say like this you may not even believe what I'm preaching you may not even think that what I'm saying is necessary but I ask you a question since you have become a Christian how much of your life has changed how much do you love God is your daily prayer is to be better for God is to push into his his eternal our character hello what are you doing with the life that God has given you you say you got it and the Bible says you'll notice tree by the fruit it bear hallelujah how many signs have followed you the Bible says the Bible says Amen these signs have followed them they believe I mean what is your vindication because every piece of the bride will be vindicated you understand me and then you know whip pushing into the manifestation of the full adoption of Christ where are you in walk how many ladders how many stairs have you climb to get to that perfection in Christ hello let this mind be in you it God ain't gonna force you he said let it you allow it to happen right that means you must yield to it is that right God is not a rapist God will never force himself on you this is a love affair Jeremiah father McCall close with this Jeremiah 15 forgive me I'm crying out because God is crying out I don't know who he's all he's talking to he may be talking to some he may be talking to all you know I mean all I know is that God is trying to reach somebody's heart and and you're allowing the devil to harden your heart because you think you've got time you think because I'm young I need to experience the world let me tell you something you're young people let me say this to you you better keep yourself you think you want some of that you think you want some of that you have no idea what's waiting you you leave from under this blood Satan is going to have a field day with you hello don't you understand what demon possession is it is possession that means Amen the devil will make you do whatever he wants you to do and no matter how you call on Jesus he will not let you go until Jesus says so you think you want some of the world a static and then out there in the streets you want some of this ass to prostitute out there and you you want some of the world you go ask amen that drug addict or that drunk that murderer whatever he may be that Satan has pressed himself to into because just God won't oppress himself into you Satan will oppress himself into you you gonna be one of the other you're gonna be a temple of God or a temple of the devil do you understand you've got the best parents ever you better listen you may not like it but they tell you there's a wolf out there there's a bear out there there's an intercom I want to call to end the country then bigos snakes pythons or whatever there's something out there that can swallow you up you understand me people I'm telling you if I could reverse back and take in all that my mom told me I got scars I got scars I got from the world I don't know why I'm going this way but I'm going I got scars in my life right now I would have never had a tie listen to my wife my mom and I'm going to tell you something you don't want these girls they never leave meaning that caused all the pain it caused when I got it but it's always there to remind me don't be foolish this is not a time to go back on God or even look in that direction well look at all the messes people well what you looking at them for look at yourself where are you do you really think because the Titanic went down insult that I want to sink with the Titanic I guarantee you most of those people was every man for themselves do you think amen I wanna all my loved ones is inspired I'm I just oh my god let him stay there he understand me my point here is you've got that I I don't know what else to say this is right now our selfish momentum or selfish time for you you must think of yourself when it's all over the race when it's all over is about you because let me tell you something there is no fellowship in hell and a lot of us think because we're under this message praise God ain't going to hear we got us a prophet millions of them die hmm have you received the Holy Ghost since you be Jeremiah 15 5 I'm closing on this thank you for your patience I'm gonna be working on this until God tells me to stop those of you who have not heard the message that I preached on Wednesday please get that link and listen to it then you'll be able to catch up to where we are I don't know like I said who God is talking to I believe he's talking to all of us from the pulpit to the door but if we want to see God in the way that Malachi 4 brought it we must live it and the only way we can live it is that Christ being you living it for this day so who shall have any pity upon thee O Jerusalem or who shall bemoaned be or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest thou has forsaken me said the lord thou art gone backwards therefore I will stretch out my hand against thee and destroy thee I am weary with repenting huh I am weary with repenting now you say what brother books we're the Bridewell guru Israel used to be the bride God called her a bride that can't happen to us well it will not do those who I licked it those who are chosen it will not but how No how do you know you've been chosen let's use Mary for an example we use her an example Mary came to know she was chosen because an angel came to her and said thou art favored and Mary you're going to produce a supernatural son [Music] that's it that's how the angel come to us you will be impregnated by God himself and you were produced a supernatural son a son that will come forth from you not by sex but by God's choosing hello so therefore you saying what the Christ in us is the supernatural son and he will be manifested and you and I must understand that's how you know you Brian is when the word for this day is manifested in your life and I would not stop I would not stop calling on God until I see Jesus and Jesus only no longer me but him thou has forsaken me saith the Lord for thou art going backwards therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee and destroy thee I am weary with repenting I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land I will be read them of children I will destroy my people since they returned not from their ways understand that this announcement went out to the whole of Israel and yet there was a few that this does not apply to that was Daniel there was Shadrach Meshach and Abednego if there were others I don't know but all I know is that when that king of Babylon came and y'all better understand me y'all don't even see where this whole thing is moving but I'm gonna tell you something this country and as well as the world it's really freeing to go up in a riot if you're not spiritual enough to see what this thing is mounting up to and let me tell you something you better have your goods Oh y'all think y'all you think you're not gonna be tested you think because somebody told a lie on you that's bad oh you think because some brothers sister says something bad to you and I'm totally upset you think that's all we got to deal with the squeeze is already on us the pressure in your mind to do right versus do wrong is on you every day annoying things out of hell and I know there's nobody in here that I could believe wants to go to hell how many y'all want to miss the rapture nobody wants to mr. rapture this is why we come yes it's the blood of Jesus yes he justifies us but you must bear him you must bring forth there's a balance to it God ain't gonna come in a nightclub and rap to you huh and guarding or you know God go catch you on your own your TV on yo yo yo yo yo your internet service looking at something you ain't got no business and rap to you he ain't gonna do it the God ingo rap to you you caught in the midst of a fight with your relative the rapture takes place and you get ready to somebody in God gonna rap to you it ain't happening y'all must realize that these things that Satan is putting on you is to keep you from a rapture it doesn't mean you're not saved but you and I have come to make a rapture we come to please him and I I say it like this I don't know what you're gonna do but I come to praise his name I come to make a rapture do you fight yes do you fall yes do you stumble yes but I don't give up there is no given up in me I don't give up I don't quit because times are tough let's stand now if you quit God's side what other side is there you got Satan now you saying I'm gonna leave God and go to Satan and guess what Satan only ask you to do anything he tells you God gives you your will Satan takes your will he makes you do things that you don't need a law to do hello y'all y'all act like y'all not human they ain't a person in here that can say that Satan has never made them do anything they did they won't they didn't want to do every one of us is guilty whether it be by way of a lie or some debt deception or or just looking at things that we shouldn't look we look in fashion I'm gonna tell you something about the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost don't care about fashion it's alright to have nice things but God don't care and the Holy Ghost don't either that's why brother been said I don't even care my pants and my jacket match or not especially it wasn't on these things you know God allow us to have nice things but when we get to a place where you got to have this and you've got to have that your affection is not on things above you ain't gotta have nothing like he said those missionaries that that's living off a few pennies you know how they ever get much to eat but they're happy like they ride down the street in the limousine no I didn't come to make you shout or dance or rejoice I believe the message in which God is trying to give all over to us is a message that will break your heart God delights in a broken and contrite spirit but as being a servant of the Lord I see where some of y'all hearts are so hard you don't even know what it feels like to cry at it we have become so selfish when it comes to God we won't God to give us everything and all God asked us for such little such a little thing it's worshiping praise just being faithful to the Word of God you know but yet we want God to be so faithful and when God doesn't answer us according to the way we should we we get attitudes about it may God have mercy on us He blessed us with a job blesses up with money blesses us with house blesses us with food and we so forget how good we have it I can remember the time when I was a boy I only had one pair of shoes most of the time they had holes in the bottom didn't have a change of clothes except for in the weekend we go to church my mom washed out the best that we had so that we could go to church I could remember the time I would be so hungry I didn't know what to do I would go outside and just turn the faucet on it just feel my Bettye a belly up with water it would even hurt going down because my stomach would be so empty we forget we forget just how much he's done for us in such a short period of time God likes to be remembered like everybody when you give them a gift or do something special you'd like to be remembered that you did that it's just in us I don't know where your heart is but he knows so what we're gonna do we're just going to bow in a word of Prayer Oh Lord Jesus I'm sorry [Music] forgive me Lord for prostituting your time cleanse me of all my unrighteousness Lord give me a clean heart father as we preached Lord I only you know you told you era Maya they wouldn't repent there was only a few in that group that had a contact with you Lord father help us Jesus because there's so many people around this message because that just believe and feel they're gonna make a raft because they only believe in you Malachi 4 Lord but Malachi 4 directed us to You Lord he pointed us to you and yet there's still so many who are staying with John instead of following Jesus God we need you we need your grace we need your mercy there's no words or any kind of clichéd that will be able to say to that gate thank you at the gate to get there to get in the only thing that he'll be looking for is that life that toe even as your prophet said that it is your life that character that we can take with us we can expect to go to heaven if we living like hell or living like we're living in here help us God overcome this age that we're living in where even though bride who's been called by this great message hallelujah seemed to be losing her stamina she seemed to be losing her fight help us now and refreshes Jesus Oh God let your Holy Spirit come down and break up the fowler ground Lord oh Jesus moving this place this morning may we may you grant us repentance lord have mercy on us Lord may not be Lord the way it was with his Rael Lord they had reached that place where they across the line and father you said even when you gave them opportunity to repent they would not God I believe this is our time this is our moment young people are actually angry Lord feeling like they imprison and all this kind of stuff that Satanist whispered in the ear oh lord I can't do this I can't do that I can't Lord and they can't even see that you're trying to protect them from hurt harm in danger parents Lord who seem to be losing it Lord yes Lord instead of praying with their children and trying to get them to the Holy Ghost Lord our words are not effective without God help us Jesus we can't add one cubit to our statue and that definitely not to our children Lord I pray father God that you will help us understand this is a spiritual warfare and the only way that we'll be able to defeat Satan is by way of the Spirit yo spirit your Holy Spirit Lord Jesus break this yokes of the enemy Oh God help us now many need to go to Calvary many have not gone to Calvary can't feel the death of God until you go there help us dear Jesus take these people to Calvary Lord may they see the price Lord may they see the cost of their salvation Lord I see there is something here that's grieving you I don't know who and what it is but lord I pray that your mercy be upon these individuals that have hardened their heart towards you this morning Lord let us keep going perhaps somewhere down the road the strongholds of Satan will be broken father in your name Jesus Christ we pray learning learning I'm learning to lean on Jesus [Applause] Iza finding more power there are you I'm learning to lean on Jesus [Music] oh oh I'm learning I'm learning to read on gee Oh finding more power the arbor tree I'm learning to lean on Jesus is it again
