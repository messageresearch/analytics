TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in their own way of thinking they had their own theology he means what he says and he says what he means and really if the people would have been in a place to search the scripture they would have come to knowledge or to know who christ was this is why jesus told them to search the scripture for in them you think you have eternal life but there was also another variable that that that laid in the scripture and that was god said that they would be blinded and so they could not see not that god made them blind but he saw their decisions he saw what they would do when the word would come and because of their pride and arrogance jesus had to say them say to them because you say you see your sins remain but we find that in that day only a few people came to know who he was his disciples walked with him three and a half years and didn't truly understand who he was until one day jesus brought a question to them all who do men say i the son of man am and we know the story he directed to peter and he said unto peter who do you say that i am and he said some say that thou john the baptist some say you're jeremiah zechariah one of the other prophets but jesus said who do you say that i am because we must realize that not only was jesus christ the messiah but he was also the seventh seal of his day of the old testament and that seal was broken and when that seal was broken not only was there a new message that was given to paul but there was also a resurrection that took place at that time nobody knew about it only those whom god revealed himself to because on the day of his resurrection we find out that those who resurrected with him appeared to about 500 or more and even so out of that 500 there was only 120 in the upper room so sometimes people see supernatural and even the supernatural can't bring about a conversion this is what i love about the message because we realize by god's grace that what is now has already happened nothing is new under the sun god dealt with israel and in the same like manner
