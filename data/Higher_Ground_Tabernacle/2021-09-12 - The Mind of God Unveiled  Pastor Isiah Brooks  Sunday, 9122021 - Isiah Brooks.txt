from there we'll run to philippians 8. romans 11 homage epitomes beginning at the commercial 33rd verse oh the depth of the riches excuse me oh the death of the riches both of wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgment and his ways past finding outs today for who have known the mind of the lord or who have been in his counsel or who have given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen reporting shows i really like groudon to respect amen i ask that you turn with us now to uh philippians please i wrote it down wrong but we're going to read it anyway being confident of this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ confidently my apology excuse me let us pray praise our mother prayer father we thank you for your grace for your mercy thank you for being so good to us will amen amen you may be seated as well we have been working uh basically with the seven seals and seven thunders tonight and the coming of the lord and i have introduced you send you out in my studying don't miss the truth my heart was not only joyful to drive but somewhat saddened me in time and in history and i hope by god's grace is required to speak to this morning we be able we will be able to pablo to see exactly where we are those of us who consider ourselves to be in this message i like to say in this word or in christ because god has made us free and we have been made free news and christ is the word a christian hallelujah amen now the word of god tells us nepal the trinity according to first thessalonians four at the 15th verse for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain neutral unto the coming of the lord christ do not prevent them which are asleep they want some pastor for the lord himself shall descend from heaven calvin senual remember with the shout out with the voice of an archangel and with the trump of god it was sold out and the dead in christ shall rise first kirisitso can be seen throughout the entire bible through the shadows and types don't don't they don't don't don't don't know the don't donate hallelujah now we know by god's grace to you this scripture is connected with revelations 10. one through seven i said it it it connects the creatures should connect because you and i must understand that this uh these scriptures are scriptures so basically but the victory in which we have today has come through and by god everybody hallelujah hallelujah um but we we need to see that when the lord descended coconut the bible tells us that god himself the jewelry man came to abraham in the cool of the evening don't don't don't don't don't don't don't do my time and when god came to abraham he was in the likeness of three men hallelujah amen but when abraham saw these three because hallelujah amen but at the same time no ma'am no more when these angels went down two angels went down to sodom and gomorrah saw these angels have you seen he never said lord inaudible a lot kind of a revelation going on hallelujah abraham's revelation going on yeah when you can see god in all of his manifestations and still call him one hey you have a real revelation and he could [Music] [Music] i can find 50. will you spare the city that's what you've done will you spare the city he went all the way down to the number 10. if i could the population that um in those cities hallelujah for an example by example what if you see there was only foreign you as it was in the days of lot come seated on the thunder as it was in the days of sodom city the bible says only a few will be saved hallelujah he said as it was in that day did he come to you so shall it be when the son of man shall be revealed hallelujah so we're living in a day where the gospel hallelujah amen they don't mind it in many people do not want to hear that don't live hallelujah and as every church age they don't sacrifice was required to die to the previous church in order to be born into the previous church age uh hallelujah right coming out of the catholic church and so we know by god's grace new questions that when wesley came to become wesley he had to die to what luther taught him [Music] amen into the meal called that family is not saying that everything was is wrong in the pentecostal church not saying that everything is wrong in the wesleyan church i could do a photo i'm not saying is wrong amen in the lutheran church hallelujah but you must understand god is a god of progression and you've got [Music] yes sir for example for example noah preached a message hallelujah right think about the powerful message or message moses preached have because he told the pharisees who were long stricken if you don't believe that i am he could sifu and quiet back with you you should die in your sins is that any more out of appreciation i understand what i'm saying so let me move on for those of us will soon who have come into this message you really got to be on your p's and q's you really have to be careful because if you're not careful that's good which is just like the system of pentacles what was think about it possible when god visited abraham could you ever visit abraham abraham's name had been changed from abram to abraham from sarai to sarah hallelujah and these were names given by god abraham and sarah i think abraham was somewhat like a gradual chain it did come with sean's mother changed from an old age to a new man and a new woman is that right hallelujah and what was it that change uh in abraham was was uh not just a a chemical change but it was a biological [Music] something that only god could do it wasn't something that abraham and sarah could explain what they saw she saw the gray hair turned back to its original color and no doubt that that's the way brother described it absolutely he said not only that he said they woke up one morning and they saw because when abraham and sarah [Music] to make his wife you're my sister my sir hallelujah is that all right that's crucified so you got to understand but the message of the hour is already changing you've got god on the inside so someone see who's having jewelry hallelujah amen right and what we fail to see is that there is no way to explain it brother call and exactly that's exactly what it is hallelujah is that all right so you look at this thing you said the mind of god this is it's in the denominational church i always had a hope even though the scripture says make your calling an election sure exactly what time i'm confessing i don't want to be asking god to forgive me hallelujah and i couldn't see myself coming into perfection is that right because the bible holiness without let's send it to you no man should see god solace holiness is perfection how can i be perfect how can i be holy [Music] to be able to catch the thought of god become prophets praying [Music] for a long time but if you studied the church ages it was a true genius from ephesus all the way up the last diff to the philadelphian age did your scholars defeat their feet god was saying to them i will because you're vain i will i will do this i will do that and he always put it in the future this song remember it's no longer i will come send it i will give you this but he's now standing at the door of the later she in church [Music] hallelujah this is why we have seen the cloud of god hallelujah this wasn't just some phenomena man it was god himself coming down in a cloud don't like don't [Music] we are in absolutely absolutely so when when abraham i want him going back to that oh okay it was an open show is that right when brother branham i speak was here called when god was using the prophet hallelujah it was an open show sit there come on uh i speak that is that right the baptist saw it baptism [Music] is that right that's gonna say hallelujah it's not shown in the scriptures he met up with sarah don't don't get poised sarah is pregnant [Music] [Music] hallelujah seven thunders are the virtues it is just what people say no no no no no [Music] oh come on somebody why because this is why we have to get rid of people living in the pentecostal tortoises we must go back to the word of god and see what the word of god says that's the only way you're gonna swing forth no [Applause] [Applause] with books heavy my wife and i my family more about their children because i've only a wheat on phone and uh that would have never happened sanprove james james if she lived in one state see you ever shall manifest jesus christ this is the mystery she said let me stand that the world cannot see them and the pentecostals are looking in the pontification hallelujah but they don't see me in the voip that jesus christ because jesus in the book of revelation don't believe how the third apocalypse is that jesus christ is the beginning of the creation of god lucomos mode de la creation of the jew hallelujah hallelujah where in this age of deceiver don't let this page don't sit in this corrupt age don't say that's called age where heart breathing is done god said i'm going to bring forth a pure seed i'm going to produce a word child okay in my very image hallelujah hallelujah is that right exclusive right but this has been here hidden the word of god apollo did you according to genesis tells us that adam i don't have a feminine part feminine right as hallelujah and adam knew the mind of god i don't couldn't see that paul said to you god didn't have to text him journey to the patriarchy you didn't have to call him on the telephone but there was connection but he having connects your mind of god that don't say the jews oh i don't know when the mind of god is in you you're calling upon him the will of god if you watch the scripture see boy there was a [Music] mind of god [Music] that did you adam oh i don't hallelujah you understand me amateur god i don't tell jesus and because he had the mind of god he was scientist is given to us anxiety not for just shouting about people not just dancing hallelujah and having a good time the holy ghost come to change we're being formed into the image and likeness of god to replenish the hallelujah [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] man you know you know so what did god did to adam guess girl do you have a fear i don't he broke that seal is that right that's good right adam was kind of like the type of the seventh seal i don't think uh on completely city himself and even though god memphis spoke the word in genesis 1. apparently still had to be made manifest because adam was first spoken spirit that's good i don't it was in the spirit realm it did on course and then god formed him yeah praise that truth and that left hallelujah so god made him spirit first your life oh boy then he fought him out of the dust of the ground hallelujah even though the man was manifested emma was not complete yet until god breathed in his nostrils is [Music] hallelujah is that right hallelujah for years one day that word that was spoken [Music] that's what it was all about coming on the lord that venue you said yeah the time of life don't do that i think uh the cycle of a woman is 28 days the secret of the pharmaceutical tweezers is no coincidence since you don't god came he called you it didn't end it in the cloud lasted 28 minutes amen on may 28th on may 28th uh february february 28th sorry yeah no the uh amen and uh so i'm working with the 28th i messed up on the february this is but nevertheless 28 right and so you say what do you mean and then what a prequel in the life magazine don't don't learn life magazine hallelujah with the rainbow over his head don't like la concierge which is a covenant whoo and all of a sudden he broke the seal see william branham didn't break the seal now he's gonna broke the scene oh glory to god so we understand the lord jesus christ is the seventh seal he is what you say well what do you mean brother [Music] turned jesus christ [Applause] just like the roman church used to come at least john the baptist on twitter they were getting rid of him but he was the only one john the baptist he was the only one through the second [Music] the changing of the body the shoulders because it's so much closer now it tapped off it's ever been because that's jamaica and i didn't see this i haven't seen this all along i've been recycling but after the resurrection jesus only preached to the elected jesus you understand me this whole ministry changed because in order for wesley to come out of luther in order for the pentecostals to come out of the wesleyans understand me that's a in order for the message or the word of god to come out of the pentecostal book did you start to ignore his particular is that the scripture that's because it's excuse the scripture they had to die either maria the bible says a bibliography a woman that liveth in pleasure in pharmaceuticals hallelujah and whether you see it or not a mcu right now three layers of pentecostal [Music] they can't go but so far with their revelation because they put a wall around them and if the bishop doesn't come up with a new revelation is that right it's the same old david uh with goliath hallelujah glory to god let me move on did you have one seat so what did god do guess could you put adam to sleep that word the words in genesis he put adam in a deep sleep i don't know in other words the same thing that god did to adam remember schultz could you have a favorite i don't he did to abraham remember abraham that deep sleep performed was like like death probably come here abraham descended in her dark place abraham saw his acceptance um y'all about to blow me out of here wow with excitement hallelujah but i'm telling you what i don't know whether y'all feel what i feel but he's here would you say hallelujah now the thing that we must come to understand yeah the second development to develop that when god took abraham he called you have him in the ability to sleep with that death of christ but one of the things that really catches my attention i'm working with jesus christ your pal jesus is requested he had an experience he had an experience we call it the mount transfiguration and the bible said that he took peter james and john yeah glory to god and while he was there in constitutional amount uh they appeared moses and elijah is it that power and you know moses and elijah did a long time ago hundreds of years something we know that those who are in christ when you're saving so increased we don't die hallelujah amen so when people say you're dead there's a calling on these groups you die and cry you just leave this body and samuel was still in his prophet's role hallelujah and that samuel said and samuel grady what evil have you done he said unto saul because of what you've done i closed your secretary you're going to be with me in a day or two hallelujah you understand me still a prophet did it happen hallelujah so moses is in elijah emma was a type of the old testament saints they sent the resurrection you know and elijah was of the gentiles the resurrection of the new testament they did the same to moses then the prophet god said it like this the prophet did you have a deed a true revelation a true uh mount transfigured revelation of the mountain as jesus christ now god provided way there's the only one besides you understand me and that's why you must find that provided jesus that's always jesus christ but you've got to understand and god provided place the only message 1965. where every one of us repent then that statement every one of us repent there why because we find ourselves glory on men there's only one to be glorified and that's jesus christ history they get mad at you they've got to come back at you there's see yeah well you see it there was moses you have emoise the one that died and raised again is that right does he say right moses died and and and the devil was looking for his body that's right right there was elijah when they look [Applause] [Music] purpose of our [Music] it talks about the scripture those it won't hinder us those who are remain alive you say circus we're the ones we're the ones that god and you saw him circumcised by the word is changing [Music] after the he had already gone up he didn't jump all day because before he went up he told mary don't touch me for my father came back god himself jewelry man christ themselves to open the world tells us our heart burns the word unto [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] see you know we are in an age and a time doesn't tongue let me uh we're in a uh age at a time that god is doing a great work uh that child could sit down [Music] that's exactly what jesus christ was spoken word he didn't have to die he did it in order to pay the debts like that the only way he could uh uh could pay be paid less they was all sexual born is it to to snape outer sex after the devil his plan you got it see so you and i must understand we see my different component yeah i'm almost done with this portion you know unbelief is a powerful spirit creature because what in this age we we use our mind we do don't say you don't know we don't think too much with our mind dupont no testosterone letting our heart think oh you effective and all that kind of stuff it deuces all this it's against the words because faith you don't examine you shouldn't exactly faith takes a whole lot even when you can't explain it si noe pouvei pesci what the flood really was see and then god had him to build this boat it could really everything on stream explain to me explicit more what putting blood on the dog post in a little metroid how that provided a safety about as much faith as it took sarah amen about as much faith as it took sarah oh woman baby hallelujah you understand this company so i'm bringing this to a place did not come just to raise the dead village things were absolutely [Music] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah see everybody a lot of people don't realize no [Music] amen we're going to pray for our justin martha i understand that brother john mark wife has given birth to a baby boy john mark nissan congratulations amen i got some okay so that's just our word prayer father we come before you thank you for your grace [Music] for being so good to us [Music] give them a speedy [Music] [Music] [Music] there [Music] [Music] foreign

mind god is [Music] god is good all the time something came to my mind i need to uh make an announcement um it's been some time ago and the only reason why i found that no smoke this known is because of the different schedule between this is [Music] um this is a difficult thing to say but my [Music] it was a great surprise to me as well saturn [Music] to me and i was very angry and uh i didn't say anything during the service javelin or after the service because i did not want to disturb the spirit of the holy spirit but uh so that you understand i did talk to her i met jeffy bella kid and we told her that she could not come back until her situation is changed she comes back with full repentance so that you'll know me and when i'm aware of it it comes recognizing i will make it right [Music] in my shoes god i i if if you know me see if you're more connected you'll know that i have no respect to persons [Music] we had informed them not to do such a thing and so we did correct it we got it right and so now you know i know savvy we won't have that to happen again can you not on powerful outcome should pass a lot on call if such a thing would happen seek assurance to come surpass
