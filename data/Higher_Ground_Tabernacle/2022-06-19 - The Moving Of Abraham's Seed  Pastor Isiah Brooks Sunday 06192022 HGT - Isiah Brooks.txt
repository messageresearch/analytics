[Music] you may be seated for just a moment i sang a little longer because of the ones that were still coming we appreciate the iowa city group for passing out board winner and just like i said when we announced they are coming come javier no see we are expecting us to go to them their picnic we want to have a joint meeting there for those of all all of us we're waiting on their date zones in their place and most of you don't know her but her name was margaret dingeman margaret she was about 80 years old also but in my uh being but her husband was the uh thing that was keeping her from going all the way this weekend but he would not allow her to we just somehow connected with her ten years ago and at that time god said as the devil said rather excuse me she had cancer and she was in a uh one the last stage or the next to the last stage and they had given her a short period of time but that's not what god said and god delivered her from that cancer he came back it looks like years later god delivered her again it came back years later and um but this time at sumo it was her ongoing time but she saw miracles her her granddaughter who could not have a kid or a child we pray for her at the same time we pray for sister margaret remember god bless that sister with twins in fact they came here as a testimony he's a different so we i don't know what kind of drugs he was on the drug but it really had him in a bad state of mind we pray for him at that same time and god delivered him i'm not bragging on me he's the same man and then as a testimony brother rich and i went by we prayed for her saying for her brother keith and i went by this lady was in her chair he said farmington couldn't holly move we pray for her she brought it up and she said that she feel lighter than air yeah and she began to dance in the spirit this last time we went by here she wasn't able to do much talking anything but we we did pray with her by the grace of god so you understand it was not the cancer that killed her it was the medication she overdosed uh the medication they gave her there was a certain period of time she was supposed to stop taking it and she thought she was supposed to continue to continue with the medication so that's the thing that that brought her body down regardless to the fact she left out here and like her daughter and son-in-law in this message they were the ones who were interested in her years ago they live in arkansas not they told me about uh sister dingerman uh i think it was brother keith and i can't remember brother i can't remember who went with me uh directly because those two would always go one way or the other that her mom was listening to the prophet's message every somebody when i got to the funeral yesterday he always have a little strangeness about him but he said no no he said i want you to sit by me we sat by him the whole time and he turned over and he said to me turn to look at me he said i know for sure did you see something you are a true man of god and then he began to say a cool breeze came through the room and when the breeze came to the room it took her with him you know i told my wife i said it's a it's a strange thing she's doing my pharmaceutical that lady laid up in that casket as and she looked like she was asleep and so blood was still running in the vein concealer i don't understand it but i get i i i was hoping their relatives would have come tonight this morning they're on their way only just a few times he just had an opportunity to come to what we call a message he had faith to believe what the message was saying [Music] and she stayed true to the lord and god is my witness she was the only this is a this is a a a a similarly a god church just said you need as a testimony so she was a testimony even to those people and you know what the pastor said that old time stand it amen so we thank god for his goodness why you got that white suit on question it's in honor of my wife and in honor of my father there's only one true father and that's god himself this is jude remember when i got married i was and when i got married the second time i was married in white oh y'all didn't know that huh i married jesus [Laughter] i knew i got off [Laughter] hallelujah god is so good to us we um listen i couldn't have been a good father [Music] if i had never gotten really you know married being married together and i want to say to the fathers today this is not a traditional thing this is something we we don't not necessarily celebrate see texas couldn't say that but i want to say to you the only thing you can do as a father is to give it your best see there is no perfect fathers the only perfect one is christ himself but we have an example in this example that we should go by and live by you know everything so we thank god for that also i had a battle wearing this suit because of the color i had a suit this color in my closet in my closet mama galduro for for about 20 years and i was always afraid to wear it it got so old i had to give it up so i took it to the salvation army and the suit that i have it was not planned but by god's grace god gave it to me and i'm saying all of this to say don't look at my suit no i got the best that god has given me and think that this is your tithing i know how people think she said come on pause but no no no this was not yours and from you no this was from someone else i said all of that to clear up your mind god is good to us maybe that was carnal and what it should not have been said but i think i just need to say things like that people when they see the pastor doing better while pastors but you know when when anybody prospers it's because of jesus christ and we thank god for his grace and his mercy now i'm coming to have a good time i'm trusting that you're you're going to open your hearts and mind to the holy spirit this morning and i know as you say and all of the promises of this bible and this message hallelujah i i was thinking about brother branham as we stand japan i was thinking about him and and and and i was thinking about how tough it was to preach what he was preaching the british at the time he lived on earth because oscar uh back in that day you couldn't see what we see now and so that's why when we hear the message it's like the prophet is here right now the voice of god is speaking to us literally right now that's what makes it real because we see the reality of the message and we're definitely living it right now you are either a believer or make-believer or an unbeliever that's the way it works but i trusted everybody in here are believers envision yourself as a believer i don't care what you go through never never ever let the devil make you think you are a foolish virgin for that you are lost never ever let him get in your mind to convince you of those those evil things because god chose you and he loves you for who you are hallelujah amen in that while we were yet sinners he starting at the tenth verse i got three passages of scriptures that i like to read hebrews 11 and 10. speaking of abraham ballooned abraham for he looked for a city which have foundation whose builder and maker is god through faith also sarah herself received strength to receive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised me we're going to read there the first chapter and we'll read the third and fourth verses in order to read this book you have to be really spiritual minded so but i'm going to just take a portion here you see uh from third verse to the fourth because of the savior of the good ointments that thy name is as ointment poured forth therefore do the virgins love thee liquid he says thy name is as oi man poured forth therefore do the virgins we will run after thee the king have brought me into his chamber we will be glad and rejoice in thee we will remember thy love more than wine the upright love thee 19 apocalypse beginning at the seventh verse let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of god and i failed at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus christ i love that brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy dear jesus the god who is of heaven the jew this year the god who of of earth you drew that down and the god who is of me lord you dwell within us your bride your church you have made us your tabernacles and we worship you lord we thank you oh god for being so good to us lord beyond measures your love has been expressed to us so much so it's very it's hard to comprehend just how much but i pray this morning that as we speak your word hallelujah as we speak your word father that you will anoint the hearts that's what you want in the mind of the people because you said by your prophet we we thank you oh god because i realize a man that we are living in a time what god has done and is doing in this day it's good you have faith it could fail he's not come to establish another institution uh like the church age uh established institution but he comes to inject himself into a people that they will become one with him amen you know in the songs of solomon and and they are expressing is extreme the very name of god is like like a stipulation if it does something to to these virgins and then they said you know we love him we love him we love his expressions we love his feelings we love everything about him and then and that's what jesus said it's excruciating all that the father has drawn all that the father has called the belt will come hallelujah but this is the part i love is that he said the king hath brought me into his chambers hallelujah oh my god the king has brought me into his chambers and we realized this morning the only way you could ever truly worship god you must worship god in spirit and in and truth see that is what it is lacking among us it's not the truth it's the spirit of the truth it is the anointing of god we seem to be afraid of don't know but this is not something that you should be afraid of this is something that you must embrace and this annoying is thing welcoming anointing is that right you must welcome jesus is that right you must worship him and welcome him hallelujah see the bride is moving the lord spoke that to my heart the other day he's moving there's some who are standing still there are some who are confused but the bride of jesus christ god is literally changing her from the inside out that god hallelujah but i'm telling you what i'm feasting on i'm feasting on that bread of life that was beyond beyond the veil hallelujah that bread behind the veil never would grow old even if you were dead when you laid back there that that kind of glory there's only one place of worship hallelujah and the only way you're going to be able to worship him you must find that one place let me tell you something most of them this message has literally struck destroyed strike you it's something of yesterday it may have been yesterday my god because he's the saying yesterday yeah today and forever is jesus hallelujah however they acted on the day of pentecost that's how they should be acting now oh but they said why are they doing something we're beyond that i don't know about you he [Music] the first place of worship is in his chambers he don't see you know i entitled my message of abraham seed hallelujah the bride of jesus christ she moves like abraham because she is abraham's seed not the natural seed but the spiritual seed of abraham where is your life right now i'm putting you god is more than a until first you hallelujah y'all understand what he's saying oh let me let me say this church can't save you synthetic that's right because the lamb is a heat and not a that was the only place in worship it wasn't the temple of the pharisees it wasn't the temple of the sadducees hallelujah it wasn't even peter hallelujah there was only one place of worship and god himself says the jew remembers hallelujah this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased to dwell in places pointed to the right [Music] [Applause] of the spirit of god he's not like a black bird putting on peacock feathers is the reason why and come to understand what we figure to salvation it's almost done something you don't see people running to the message anymore you see them running away from the message hallelujah because when you break connection with jesus when you don't pray you follow me when you trust in what we call the message now i may explain that when you trust those schools in the system of this message to save you there's a message you're no different than the pentecostals hello god said to nicodemus you must be born again don't you say that too loud but that's the truth there's only one savior the concern and that's jesus christ hallelujah even john pointed to him he says listen that's coming look i'm not even worthy to unleash his shoes somebody help me here man it's the truth say why god is talking about your religion islam had religion for hundreds and thousands of years islam what about israel israel has religion and then when jesus came they called him a devil hallelujah it's the same thing i'm sure even in this message but if y'all don't get up in the message if y'all don't get up in in in and listen i know what i'm preaching y'all might think i don't know what i'm saying football secretary i don't boast on me i'm just saying that's right i think about uh brother branham and the and the and and in the age he had to deal with the way he preached he told those people yo speaking in tongues a threat you don't see people they did not think that brother branham was a threat he was saying he didn't mean us he was not in the department but the voice of god hallelujah yes sir they sent out what they did the um fbi it's own word sent them into his meeting to see how genuine he was you know they went back and says really nothing's to him and the world is still shaking is that right they thought jesus wasn't a threat we killed him they say don't you come here what they did not see there was a resurrection coming hallelujah supposed to do having the same power this is not a sunday school that's it called the demons well you're just coming in and just set so still and quiet you're afraid more than once and you know what nobody has to say y'all come dancing start the music don't sit on celebrity and everybody in their seat they get up and they move it's the most i saw some brothers with some moves i didn't even know they could move like that but you see it's it's it's the anointing of the wedding that comes with it that makes you want to lose no i don't know this is what is happening now this is a this wedding an invisible union what could happen to you just now if you open your heart and mine whatever blessings you got for me just this morning i want them to those at least i get some sound out of you x-ray and they'll never be able to see it x-rays it's impossible but once that seed is quicken it becomes visible hallelujah i think about how often we imprison ourselves during the week and we we we condemn ourselves all day long oh god i did that's wrong oh god i did that wrong how can i be bribed and i do all this well you never could be bribed based on your words your work should never get you there look how paul says paul says i'm blameless there's nothing against me but at the same token he's the old wretched man that i am who shall [Music] romans 6 2 2 oh man four six two two it says as david also described the blessed blessedness of the man unto whom god imputed righteousness without works did you remember that video oh [Music] where god will not charge that's what the blood did for you glory to god that's what the blood did for you but you know what we have these old self-righteous spirits like whips you know better let me tell you something and i don't want to point amen if it wasn't for the holy ghost you'll be singing all the time and don't tell me you better than me because you wash with a different smelling soup in this cleansing power we call the blood of jesus christ and if they're all washed away see something that means i'm sinless so that's the picture oh my god see we we you know we look at this thing and i don't think i don't if you really catch the revelation you think i don't go through trials you can't waiver it back on you there's no unbelief in god hallelujah come on somebody john ryan didn't have the faith that he needed to have jean aveda because he was raised in some of these uh church something like some of us been raised he hadn't seen a miracle in a long time because he was catholic so he didn't know that he could grab faith and so brother said there [Music] [Applause] [Music] his eyes and his name is jesus christ it's hard to get christians see who knew they weren't worthy you're sick they were in their healing you know why we we know what have i done wrong what have i done wrong oh somebody got a curse on me or somebody did this or somebody somebody did nothing that's foolishness said that you know see if he jumped maybe one of my friends did something no it was a test it was a trial that only job could go through that day that plane was getting ready to go down i heard the scripture quoted to me it went out the window and i knew everything was going through all right and guess what we landed without a correction don't tell me don't tell me guess what guess what you know what i was doing when that happened i was listening to brother branham i was listening to the voice on the table hallelujah and that one a flight attendant she saw something above my head whatever it i'm sorry you don't have a testimony just reduce it don't look at me like i'm lying don't look at me like i'm lying if you ain't got no testimony that's yours you need to serve god then you can tell it like i'm telling you what jesus christ is doing for me about the scriptures all i'm trying to relate to you said the volatility some of y'all looking at me well i don't believe i don't believe that well you can't experience the joy i'm experiencing fights you're the one that's hallelujah you got to be watching me thinking in here gotta tell on you the reason why many can't see it right but there are those who are changing yeah the transformers you can truly say i'm not where i used to be i'm close to god now hallelujah i've seen where god has delivered me from this [Applause] [Music] you know the [Applause] hallelujah he says now listen it's revealed to her you know he's talking to the ones that that's been it's been revealed too and then he's talking to the ones that will it will be revealed hallelujah without not because in your mind hello i hope i'm stirring some of you all up getting all the trash hallelujah faith is something the foreskin that has been revealed to you like it was to abraham call anything contrary keep your application revealed to him that we're in the midst of the rapture how many of y'all believe this god is changing us right now and the only reason why you are here is because you had representation [Applause] whatever [Music] a voice in christ he's just moving into her christ hallelujah this is the hour she becomes him hallelujah and she's free she knows that in christ exactly she has her freedom never to be in bondage again hallelujah is that the truth but you see that's what happens instead of the holy ghost take this over the church we have allowed man to take over the church we've done the same thing fixing all the others dead hallelujah is that right it's the holy ghost see the sentence be that's what the oil in those lamps represent and the oil and the lamps where the holy spirit is leading through the church candelabra the fullness of the anointing the fullness of the candlestick is now given to the bride of jesus christ hallelujah am i screaming too loud i can't help it now what is christ i'm coming to where i need to be now what is christ what is it now what is it you say christ coming to his body he is giving us christ is the word oh no the anointing is christ long sex on the word is and as soon as somebody's moved by the holy spirit you look over there and says if a person falls [Music] you're totally insane jesus said who's going to love me the most the one who's forgiven a little as he says worship yourself from some other thing but they still know how to worship with the worship so i come to lyme ohio and i mean you talking about um uh four years got four years got home i would come home aching in my body you know trying to get him to see he said you're fine i'm trying to say lord and i took my hands off of it is it the video because i can't change you it should be professional only the anointing of god that's right thank you one thing that uh my precious brother i won't call his name he said to me one day which is but you can't save him a light turned on so true but pastors in your heart see the connection there until the church at this age let me send your power don't you you can't just read brother brown's message you've got to ask god to open your heart become when i was going through what they call a change of life for men i started at the age of 40. i was crying almost every day he platform [Music] he knows how to make you believe a lie he's he he's living in that life and you know it was terrible she did it was so this woman was going through her change of life and he says sister you're going through your change of life you just ask the lord am i going to make it and when he said that lord [Music] never been the and if god says something you see jude it'll happen it's a complete i fail i don't know why i gotta tell you i was running when i was in lima i was running and i crossed a pavement somewhere i crushed something in my neck they wanted i was at tim pruitt's meeting was great my wife and i were sitting in the back [Applause] when the spirit is [Music] is that right how would you have felt if god would have took clay on it and put it in your eye see listen brother branham understood how god works because i see it vaguely in my mind but you know it was it was uh dealing with those two boys was that was healed and one was a beautiful ripe apple is that correct or some kind of fruit candy candy yeah and the other thing the other candy was really built bitter and nasty look indeed and he had to eat the candy you hear what i'm saying we've got to come into this place where we trust god with everything we got too many of our own thoughts none of us are worthy of the holy ghost if you ever approached it with that thought in your mind and it's got to come from your heart and not my your head doesn't even a mother come on man before your doorstep waiting wait a minute you don't know what i'm thinking about a possum i know people think about it don't even trick me don't trick me but my point is brother prayed for the apostle the prophet she got up and said luffy talk to her babies you know back into her pouch across the street look back to say thank you guys we got all of these thoughts that and we it's all kano you know at least mary believed in the resurrection maria she said lord we know when you come you know i [Applause] hallelujah you know i'm gonna tell you like this you know i'm telling you what i'm having faith in judy my my children half of them serve god and have don't i want yourself but i'm claiming let the devil do what he wants [Music] [Music] is let me read there's one more quote now i'll let you go listen you know y'all got me into this i usually just preach we all need to read more quotes now i'm reading okay let's go with it hallelujah you're the lord amen coming from the message our chosen place of worship and the message is it's a message come out of this mess salty that's why so many of us can't grow up in this message y'all understand me we're so worried about everybody else we don't even see ourselves look at somebody else this is a time right now let everybody do what they gonna do this has nothing to do with culture hallelujah [Music] it's as much fault as any of the rest of you know what i'm saying so many people believe it i gotta go there you don't drink like oh no see hallelujah hallelujah everybody want to believe in a holy man just don't be the holy man holy woman is that right that's the difference when they crossed over where god said moses is dead but joshua josh would do make his confusion all the people and said we're going to march it's no longer going to be just a one-man message of jesus christ amen but there's one place i can take you to my instagram to because you replace the name of jesus this is i'm not saying nothing negative about brothers jesus [Music] in the name of jesus christ i knew something was wrong you seek your kids for a long time especially when i had a brother tried to tell me that the new name of god that was her sickness to me like to do this that's what i'm doing this morning you know [Laughter] god is good to us folks [Laughter] whoa let me hurry up um i don't know about you but i feel the uh the same god foreign [Music] the place that god came into him came into you remember well in him this is my beloved son i am pleased to dwell in keys tabernacle jesus jesus christ in which he tabernacled himself hallelujah and in that tabernacle you don't shoot around that club one more i'm gonna let you go i don't want to talk to you but jesus christ what what i'm trying to say where his his is his living existence whose existence is seen because he is with us improves himself by physical signs and wonders that he promised that he would do to show it so much then there's a pillow fire that led the children of israel through the wilderness israel with us today even having this picture taken from i'm not going to read this quote but brother bradley says people must believe this message in order to make a rapture and when he talks about the coming of christ he said the message brother said not me but must become flesh [Music] oh there is [Music] is will be free power is [Music] is here is i'm so nice oh jesus jesus victory oh oh i got it i can't explain it i can't believe me so oh [Music] bye my [Music] but you must realize you're not coming to me you're coming to him i'm just a vessel that he uses but i believe god measures [Music] i know what he can do she says it could profound i've seen him do it [Music] ain't nothing too hard for my god [Music] [Music] i i refuse to let satan win the lord it's not my battle it's the lord [Music] having faith that he is the victorious [Music] everything that i've asked god for he's [Music] [Music] difficult [Music] and just to know some of y'all know uh how god delivered me from afflictions [Music] that was jesus [Music] m [Music] i sing out a love song to jesus [Music] [Music] i [Music] see [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] lord [Music] like these
