TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so they could be bound to us and therefore we give them honor a man just four weig into the scriptures you know that's why we set aside a day for Mother's Day you know there's a saying in the English language that says familiarity breeds contempt you know and and what that is basically saying is that when you become familiar with something when you become familiar with something that gives birth to the ability to take it for granted that gives birth to the ability to treat with disrespect amen so we set aside this day to honor our mothers because we have become familiar with them but we don't want to treat them with disrespect we want to take this time to honor them and to give honor where honor is due amen amen so we just this morning we say to the mothers thank you for all that you have done thank you for who you are what you are what you've done for us we do appreciate it amen let's just stand and let's just before we get into the word let's just bow our heads and just give a blessing for our mothers amen Heavenly Father we just want to take this day Lord to set aside father as we said Lord familiarity breeds contempt and we don't want to be guilty Lord Lord so we give on or to our mothers Lord and we just thank you for them father for they have done more for us than we will ever know there are many things that we don't even know about that they did for us and we never will know on this side what they went through to do to be a good mother for us so Lord we thank you we thank you for providing us with good mothers and Heavenly Father we just pray Lord that you would just give them a special blessing on this day Lord make their life a little easier along life's journey Lord and may they always have a solace in you that they'd always find them find a a path to you Lord and I thank you for forum Lord may you bless them and keep them in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen let's turn our Bibles to Romans chapter five let's start with the we'll just read the first verse there Amen thanks to the musicians I appreciate all that you do we spent so many years without musicians I'll never take it for granted I will never take it for granted amen Romans chapter five just read the first verse Sara says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ amen that's a big Scripture I'm gonna read that again therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ that's a big scripture mlss bar hasn't prayer once more Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your word may we always hold it in reverence and honor Lord let's do unto it Lord and I pray Lord that this morning you would take this word and break it open to us that when we leave out of here we'll say we never saw it that way before but you the great teacher has searched the deep things of God and has brought to us through your ministry Lord and revealed to us and for that we thank you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated amen you know with that that that statement we made familiarity breeds contempt and I just kind of want to focus on that a little bit this morning but not just in respect to our mothers but respect to all things for you know we take a scripture like this and most of us know this scripture most of us have read this scripture many times it's so easy to take these scriptures that we know and just gloss over them but yeah we here we have a promise that if if all we had in this life was this verse alone that would be good enough for me if all we had in this and if we didn't have eat of the rest of the Bible but we had this verse alone that somehow that we had a knowledge that we were justified by our faith in God and that this justification amen bring us peace with God through who through our Lord Jesus Christ that we could walk away with that satisfied knowing that we had peace with our Creator a man knowing that with that that we were not separated away from him knowing that we we were we were united with him amen amen I think about you know Adam he may not have realized what a great peace with God that he had Amen well he was created there he was as God was creating everything in his and his sight and placing him there and in the Garden of Eden and and he had peace with God a man as he walked day by day in the morning with his with his creator he had peace with God amen he didn't know what that was all he didn't know what he owned he did not know what he possessed Amen he just had it he just owned it sometimes I wish that we could get to the place where we had that same great confidence that Adam had hey man because we have a word that we've gone back to the Garden of Eden it was like it was before the fall Amen we have a word given to us by a prophet that by the by the by the blood by the sacrifice upon Calvary it has now been revealed to us that we have been changed back that we've been redeemed back to the Garden of Eden like it was before the fall amen so therefore having that great promise we ought to be able to go and see well what did Adam have before the fall one thing that he possessed one thing that he was he had peace with God amen he could he just knew it it's not something he had to guess it not something he had to think about not something he had to wonder about wonder if he had it today and lost it tomorrow but no he just had peace with God he just had communion with God him and God had become one they were co-owners of Eden they're co-operators they they were they were joint heirs amen they both had an interest in the things of the Garden of Eden amen Adam and his creator both had an interest in the Garden of Eden amen so that if there was an issue they need to be taken care of Adam and God will work together to see that was taken care of amen so now let's go back let's go over to Genesis I just going to read that through real quick let's go to Genesis chapter 2 verse 18 on their and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I will make a help meet for him you know we've been through before here God had said everything was good up to this time I mean everything that God had created was good was good was good was good amen but now we get to Adam Adam is alone and God the first time God starts saying something along something negative here he says it is not good that man should dwell alone he says I will make a help meet for him and was God do how the ground Lord God formed every beast of the field every fowl of the air and brought them to Adam to see what he would call him this this scripture this scripture always just something about it you know there is a deeper meaning here than then I don't then I know I mean I I hope the Lord fully reveals this to me before I get out of here amen but he forms every beast of the field every fowl of the air and remember wait what's he doing he's looking for a helpmeet for Adam amen and he starts bringing all these animals across by Adams field of view amen and he starts bringing them through past Adam to see cuz God wants to see what Adam will call them so as Adam do he starts giving names to them you know as I was reading the scripture last night us thinking about how we give names to things you know when you have a child when you give birth to a child when a mother or father had bring a child into the house they and they alone have the rights to name that child you know no one else has rights you know like right now if I have to go down to the National Park Service in Washington DC and go up to the Washington Monument and said I'm gonna change the name to big white stick in the ground the they would say you have no leg to stand on you have no ownership in this matter this this does not belong to you Amen but for some reason Adam it's not God naming the animals but but God is bringing the animals by by Adam to see what haddem would name them amen you know no one else had rights to name my children but only my wife and I had rights to name my children so God is taking Adam and showing Adam that you and me are joint heirs together we both have ownership over this you or Mia both have ownership over this garden we both belong here we live here we work together amen and I want you to partake in this creation I want you to partake in this and name the animals amen so it's Adam and what's in verse 18 that says and to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not a helpmate for him amen and you know the rest of the story amen so Adam took ownership in God's creation now we've been brought back to the Garden of Eden like it was before the fall amen and like I said the titleist event of this message is familiarity breeds contempt now Adam was given a great possession but he didn't treat you with the respect that it was due to it amen now as we read there in Romans chapter 5 we have peace with God right now what are you doing with the peace that God has given you there's another phrase out there that goes men or fools fools will walk with hobnail shoes were angels fear to tribe fools will walk with cleated shoes where angels fear to tread angels wouldn't even do some of the things that we do you know we can't you know if we were to if there's someone who had never heard of their creator before if they didn't know that they were created by a God Almighty in heaven if they didn't know that that God had taken an interest in them if they didn't know that that God had died to save them from their sins if they didn't know that God would come and meet them and and you went to witness to him news we've told them the gospel story about how Jesus Christ died for their sins how Jesus Christ died to set them free and then you went and you expressed this to him and you told him that 2,000 years ago Jesus Christ died for them but yet he was coming in his visiting in this little room every Sunday and every Wednesday revealing his word to his people revealing his promises to his people I'd like oh my can I come and when he came and he had opened that glass door there and he had come into this room and he had parted the curtain and he be like my I'm walking into the place where God Almighty well there was a certain awe they would come over him because he would know he sit down one of these chairs that you sit in and he'd be expecting that the words that come out of the minister's mouth will be words from the Almighty God amen now because of that guys of that person's expectation he would get what he was desiring amen hey man the Bible says that the Holy Spirit is a teacher a man that the Holy Spirit will go and search out the deep things of God and then the Holy Spirit will come and take those deep things of God and he gives it and reveals it to the ministry amen and then in this in this ministry he has pastors teachers evangelists prophets amen and he get on those those pastors in those minute that ministry gives out the the vision to the people amen and you are beneficiaries of that this morning amen but familiarity can breed contempt amen so as we walk through those curtains on day one there's a certain expectation that we are going to meet with Jehovah we walked through those curtains for the thousandth time we tend to lose it's a human nature that we lose that expectation a man how many remembers the story of Eli the high priests Amen there was a high priest back in the Old Testament that he was born a high uh priest amen he was born a Levite he was raised up as a child to be a priest his father who was a priest before him taught him every single thing every sacrifice a sacrifice for this a sacrifice for that and as he grew up older and older a man that he in fitted to the duties and he rose up to the position of being a high priest over the land amen but as he had children he began to take things for granted amen and here is he had children he didn't teach his children to have the same respect for the temple that his father had taught to him amen so even though he himself had been brought up to give respect under the temple to give respect to the sacrifices he didn't pass that knowledge down to his children so now his children grew up and they did not have any respect for the tip amen and as so and so as Eli began to get older and older and it came to be that his children became to be the age that they were to take over the high priest that they were to take over that lineage that they began to sin and they began to pollute the high place amen they began to do things that even the heathens wouldn't do in their temples and they so thoroughly polluted the temples that God Himself took a mental Ark of the Covenant out of the hands of the people he meant and and Eli died an old man ninety years old having ruined the very thing that he was given to take care of why because he didn't respect the place where God came to visit he didn't respect God's temple he didn't respect the place of god's visitation amen now we have a few places of god's visitation amen we have in the natural we have this room amen in the natural we have this room now now now we have to give respect unto this place amen we owe our respects to this church because this is the place where we gather our together all of our temples we gather together in one place and god said that wherever two or three are gathered together okay I will come there in the midst of them and I all visit you right there a man therefore we owe our respects to this natural building amen we owe our respects to not let our children run through this place we owe our respects to that when we part that curtain that we come in here early and in time to pray amen that we come in here with a right frame of mind to receive whatever the ministry that God has placed what to receive whatever comes out from behind the pulpit anything we come in what are we coming here we come in here with the same attitude that Joshua and cable okay amen because Joshua and Caleb were given a promise that you will enter into that land and you will be given something as a possession amen and we have been given a promise as a possession that where were two or three gather in my name I will be there in the midst of you that is a possession that has been given to us amen and we have to fight to inherit that possession I mean we have to fight to enter into this room amen and to have in our mind ordered a presence in our mind that that will enter into his courts with Thanksgiving will enter into his gates with praise why because we're entering to the place where God will meet us amen and we can't treat that with from that that we're it's a familiar place to us we've all been here before amen but the more often you visit a place and you begin to treat it with contempt you begin to lose respect for that place and we don't ever want to get to the place like Eli did to where he lost the respect for the high place he didn't pass that respect on down to his children a man slow when his children grow up grew up in the tabernacle they just committed whatever sin they ever wanted they wanted to do why they even to the point I've taken other men's wives and and having relations with them there in the tabernacle my why because they were not taught to reverence the tabernacle of the Most High God they were not taught to reverence the place where God and would meet them now we have that here in the natural this is a place where God has chosen to meet with his corporal body to be where his people gather together and we have to treat this place with respect amen but because of familiarity it's human nature that we would begin to treat this place with just a commonality amen a man by Saurus is so in the spirit where where Paul says that know ye not that ye are temples of the Most High God amen we treat this heart any ole way when cause it's our body we're familiar with our body we know what our body is capable of we know what it does but yet we forget that when we took the vows amen when we took our vows that Lord I commit my life unto you lord I am going down into the waters of baptism I am repenting of all my sins and I'm coming back up out of here claiming that I'm gonna follow you all the way everywhere you everywher you leave me a man when you repent of your sins you say Lord I'm sorry for my sins forgive me Lord amen and you enter into a new life saying Lord my life has now belongs to you amen and all my life I give to you amen but as time goes on there's a familiarity with your body that you forget that this bardic body is now dedicated to the Lord Jesus Christ amen you know is that nursers that there's that Sunday school song that we used to sing Oh be careful little eyes what you see Oh be careful little eyes what you see for the father up above he is looking down in love Oh be careful little eyes what you see why why do we do that because when you cease enters into the mine they God has given you amen but when we let any old thing we will just take a look at any old thing that we're not being careful with the body God has given us God has given us a temple of the Most High God you now he has create all each one of us he is created to be kings and priests unto Him when you take the vows and you vow and dedicate your life to the Lord Jesus Christ when you go down into the waters of baptism and come back up again you are now in possession you are building a temple where the Most High God will come and fill with this Holy Ghost you are doing the same thing that they Bette did back in Solomon's day where you now are building a temple of the Most High God amen you're being brought back to the Garden of Eden like it was before the fall amen and God is looking to fill his temple but what place will you build him a mint when familiarity breeds contempt amen what place will you build him will you take the time now remember remember back in the days of Moses they were given a promised land now that Promised Land was given to him but they had to fight every inch of the way I think about it when they left Egypt Moses says I am bringing you to a land that flows with milk and honey it will be you will no longer be slaves you won't have to toil for it amen but you oh you'll glitcher data be your land you will possess it be right to fight for every inch of it that's better than living in Egypt in my book that's better than leaving in Egypt amen and now we are given the same promise where we are given a promised where you know it's not just that now think about faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness the Holy Spirit the presence of the Most High God what could you do with that what could you do with that hey oh and we think you know you know you get your this idea in your mind that this is something I have to attain to but no those are just those are gifts that are given to you a man people think well there's old there's the law there that I have to attain to it that's not the law those aren't rules those aren't Commandments those are opportunities that are given to you amen amen just like the ten commandments the Ten Commandments are not Commandments they're invitations amen you don't have to be a liar you don't have to be a adulterer you don't have to be a an evil person you don't have to do wickedness no you have an opportunity for righteousness you have an invitation to have the Most High God come and live inside of you it's not a commandment be filled with the Holy Ghost it's an opportunity why don't you come and let the Holy Spirit fill you why don't you come let the Holy Spirit live inside of you amen but it's that familiarity that breeds the contempt it's that familiarity when you when you've been on this on this gospel path so long that you forget that God forgave you from your sins Amen when if you went down on the street and you were to explain this this business opportunity to someone this lifestyle opportunity to someone and they and they had never heard of them before and then you can explain to him the opportunity that Christ himself has gone has left this earth he's got into the heavens to prepare a place for you so that when you die on this earth when you close your eyes here you'll open them up there and you'll forever be with the Lord what an opportunity but yet we will sit here with that opportunity and we just treat it like any old common thing by what a what a shame what a shame amen amen but we've been given possession of something how many times we read the book of Genesis and we think about Adam and Eve how could you do that how could you lose something that was of great value to you yeah you know what Adam and Eve were giving up you know you know you I see the tourism brochures of these you know of Tahiti and and Fiji and all these places will feel like oh boy I wish I could take a vacation they're young you're and there's something in your heart that desires especially in these cold Iowa winters to go and if you could just be transported in a moment in a twinkling and I to go to the some exotic beach somewhere and you wish you could be there but yet I hadn't lost that amen and we've been giving it back it's ours as an inheritance amen but you're gonna fight every inch of the way amen you're gonna fight every inch of the way the very thing that people spend ten thousand dollars or whatever to go on a vacation has been given to us as an inheritance amen it's been given to you as an inheritance Viette we treat it with such a common thing well you think about oh how could Adam do that Adam by his decision to leave with his wife he could they sent amen they sent by that sin every one of us has lost our position by one man billions and billions lost their position by one sin one man's disobedience every man lost his position but by one man's obedience every woman has been given the opportunity to come back a man and there therein lies what will you do with this opportunity that's been given to you amen amen we treat these things as Christ died for my sins as such clichés I don't know but you he didn't just die for your sin well he died one time one time he died for your sins and you think why just accept it once you know and then you'll struggle with these with these burdens in your life not realizing that Christ died for that hey Ben you have these temptations that every time Satan comes along and pushes the button you fall the Satan has this little button in your life that every time you you think you're doing good and Satan comes across your life and he pushes that button and you stumble again it's then you'll be doing good for a while and Satan comes and pushes the button and you and you stumble again well Christ died to take that button away from you amen Christ died to remove that button out of your life and casas away as far as the East is from the West and Christ died for that amen he didn't die multiple times he died one time 2,000 years ago and that's an inheritance to you and you when you fight for it it's yours amen but if you will not fight for it you will not win Amen but it's been given to you as an inheritance but you will fight every inch of the way we can look at those at the children of Israel in Egypt there wandering around the desert for forty years we can look at and say why would you don't just walk into the Promised Land why would you not just go in there and take over but the same thing is laying before each one of us but because of familiarity we just let those things lay in our lives well let that little button just stay right there in our lives and we'll do good for a while but Satan comes and pushes the button and there you go again there are you stumble again but you know what Christ died to take that button away from you the whole purpose he died for was to set you free from these things and to give you the opportunity to walk up each step of it each step through faith to virtue through knowledge a man through temperance through patients through godliness to brotherly kindness so that you can be a walking living epistle read known of all men Jesus Christ is walking on this earth again oh it's not Jesus Christ himself it's now you with Christ in you the very hope of the glory that we're looking for Christ is now in you a man it's an inheritance that's given to you and you'll walk through the desert for 40 years because of familiarity and a lack of respect the thing has become too common to you and you lose the respect of it because you've heard about it just so many times you've heard about the promises so many times that you never will actually reach out and grab ahold of them yourself do you hear that Christ is a deliverer and you have things you need deliverance from but you just can never bring yourself to reach out and grab them because you've just heard about that deliverance just too many times and it's become a common thing to you and so you no longer will actually get to the place that God has called you to and you wonder around the desert for 40 years and yet you look back at that story of the children of Israel Moses and you think why would they do that and yet we will go and do the same things when Christ died for your sins amen now when Christ died for your sins he didn't die just so you could say oh thank you Lord for forgiving me though he died to actually set you free from those permanently he died to take those sins away from you he died so that you don't have to be in an adulterer he dies that you don't have to have this lust demon he died so she don't have to have the sickness he died so that you don't have to have this lack of faith amen he died so you don't have to have this laissez-faire attitude Amen he died so you don't have to take this thing so common Amen while he died to set you free from that so that you can be exactly what he had in his mind when he died it for you on the cross when Christ died for you on Calvary he had a picture of you in his mind Amen and that picture is what you what you what you were supposed to be before the foundation of the world amen in here moved every barrier standing between you and what that picture was but you will fight every step of the way you will fight every step of the way aim it but just like Joshua just like Caleb what do you do you cut it to go along and you count those things as dung amen you see this is standing in the way of me getting my mountain now what is it when Joshua and Caleb had said that statement amen think about it when they left Egypt they hadn't seen the mountain yet amen but they believed when they were walking through the desert they hadn't seen the mountain yet but yet they believed when they got to Kadesh Barnea they were given an opportunity to cross over as one of the spies and they walked through land and they saw the opportunity that was before them God was revealing to his children the potential of what they could be and when they came back and they began to start testifying and they said the land is good it is fruitful it is possible Jehovah is behind us we can take it over but because of the miracles of God had become too common to the people that were with them they had seen so many miracles so we signed to so many wonders that they just began well just you know back when they are slaving underneath the whips in Egypt they were said we will march right over and take over I don't care if I live I don't care if I die I will take over that mountain but once they got over there to the borderland I don't know they've been so far removed from the whips of the enemy that they just things of God have become just too common to it that they just no longer had the desire to march right in and take over even though they knew they should have known that God we bit with them every step of the way and there's Joshua and Caleb saying our God is more than able to take over us though the enemy be strong though they may be mighty we can take over the land give me my Mountain you have same opportunity lays before every single one of us give me my pyramid give me my temple give me my Mountain give me my temperance give me my knowledge give me my patience Lord I've been lacking it Lord I'm Tim I'm taking it away amen you know Satan came and push the button again but Lord get this button away from me amen why because God has a mountain for us he has a temple for us to be a part of the Most High God to be at peace with God but you're gonna fight for every step of it if if you can find it worthy in your mind to fight for it and therein lies the battle therein lies the battle you have to decide in your own mind whether this promise is worthy fighting for or not because if you decide in your mind that this promise is not worthy fighting for then you will die in the wilderness like the children of Israel Amen even though God has shown you that he is a healer even though God has shown you that he is a deliverer you've heard the testimonies you've heard all all the things that God has done in our day you've heard you've seen what he's capable of but because in your mind you think well it's just has become so common to you I just don't feel like fighting for it then you will die in the wilderness but if you like Joshua and Caleb say I don't care what it is I don't care what it is and then you and your mind make that choice to say you I am gonna fight every step of the way I know that he has gone to prepare a place for me and if he has gone to prepare a place for me he will come again and receive me unto himself and me and Jesus Christ will be united together the one who these days in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I will be changed from this vile body into a bita body like his glorious body and I will be forever with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words amen Thessalonians we will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we're gonna be changed from this mortal body to be like is good if you could find it worthy in your mind to fight for it because you will fight every step of the way you will fight every step of the way a man has given to you as a gift but you're gonna fight every step of the way if you can find the willingness if any man will let them come to me Amen that's what G those are the words of Jesus if any man will let him come to me the human will there's where there's where the problem lies if any man can take the will of his own mind the determination the valor to reach out and grab a hold of things the Lord to press in to the kingdom of God then the kingdom of God is for you Amen but the choice is up to you whether you will climb this mountain or whether you're not a man the choice is up to you amen if Satan has that button in your life where he can push it and you'll fall the choice is up to you amen why because Christ died for your sins that death is still available to you some people say that because he died for my sins 2000 years ago it's just I just can't reach it it's just too far away but know that death is right here Amen it's right here you reach out and grab it pull to yourself take the blood of Lord Jesus Christ claim it as your victory a man claiming as your deliverance Lord by your grace by your blood I have peace with God through what the Lord Jesus Christ has done for me amen let's go back and read that again in Romans 5 we're gonna go through this real slowly here Romans 5:1 therefore I remember why do they say about the word therefore when you see the word therefore in the Bible you gotta go back a few verses to see what's there for and so so it says therefore why is he saying that because two verses earlier it says but unto us also for whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead so that's verse chapter 4 verse 24 if we believed on him the raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead Amen can you believe on them can you believe them can you really believe on the one that rise up Jesus from the dead for you okay if you can believe on him therefore verse 5 of chapter 5 verse 1 therefore being justified by faith Oh so that belief really did do something that belief really did do something that faith you had when you believed on the Lord Jesus Christ did something to you it justified you amen it justified you it took away your sins as far as the East is from the West it set you free from the things that you wants did therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ peace with God what is peace with God you're standing in the Garden of Eden like Adam was joint heirs with him amen joint heirs with him you're now given a free moral agency you can choose do you want to be filled with his presence do you want to be that temple the Most High God the whole whole why the opportunity is wide open to you why is it wide open to you because you've been justified freely forgiven you've been set free from everything to separate you from anything you want and now you are a candidate for being a temple of the Most High God fill with his almighty power filled with his almighty and grace fill with his love you can love one for another why because you are now filled with love a man you can have mercy was you are now filled with mercy amen amen verse two by whom also we have access by faith into this grace where we stand and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God amen and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh faith or worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us we've been given an opportunity a chance to be like Jesus Christ if we can treat it with the respect that is due to it every single one of us has given been given an opportunity to be like Jesus Christ if we will just form it in our mind to reach out and grab a hold of it and say yes I accept it Lord yes I believe it Lord and to fight against every single thing that is contrary to that amen you will be a living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place you will be the place on earth where God dwells they now as the days get darker and darker and darker and darker as the world gets more and more evil you will be the place on this earth where Christ can still be at peace where the Son of God can lay his head a man Jesus Christ said the son of man has no place to lay his head where can he lay say when Son of Man returns will he find faith on the earth but will you returns he will have a place to lay his head a man why because as the capstone comes down amen that's the head it comes down it has a pyramid that's already built for it amen so he will have a place to lay his head when he returns to the earth amen why because of the battle that you fought the victory that you want by formula in your mind that I will win I will overcome and I will go forward amen a man one man sinned and by him all of us died but one man won the victory therefore all of us live amen amen let's just stand amen if if Eli and his sons would have realized what they've been given a man if Adam and Eve have been rely I've realized what they had been given a man if if those that those that went down into Laodicea amen those that the Nicene counseling realize what they've been given they wouldn't have chosen the ways of man amen and so also we if we would just realize what we've been given and not treat it as a common thing a tree with the respect that is due unto it then we would see God moving if we really knew that we had peace with God we would act differently amen if we really knew what these bodies were given to us for we would treat them differently these bodies were given to us to be a temple of the Holy Ghost God like in the days of Solomon is building a temple again on the earth we are living in the days of Solomon God is rebuilding his temple Jesus told them tear this temple down I will rebuild it in three days that body was resurrected they tore the temple down amen the Jews took that temple and nailed it to the cross they tore down the very temple that they were supposed to respect they didn't know that Jesus Christ was the temple and they tore it down they didn't know Jesus told him tear this temple down I will rebuild in three days and they said we were building this temple for 46 years but they didn't realize the Bible says they didn't realize that the temple that he spoke of was his own body now who is the body of Christ think about it he was speaking they didn't realize that he was speaking of his own body so he did rebuild the temple they tore it down they crucified it on Calvary but by that death he rebuilt the temple well where is that temple that was rebuilt where is that temple that was rebuilt upon Calvary where is that temple that raised again now I remember one man tore the temple down Adam right Adam the temple sinned and died the day that you sin the day you eat thereof that day you shall die his temple went down into the dust by one man the temple was destroyed but the second Adam comes it says tear this temple down and unlike Adam but now the second Adam will resurrect and the temple will be rebuilt again in three days so what is it you say no no he's talking about Jesus's body aren't you the body of Christ that means there is a temple that has been built don't you know don't you realize it's not oh I'm going to be the temple off in the future no you were given that at Calvary Christ gave that to you at Calvary that you would be the temple the Most High God it was given to you as an inheritance you are the temple the Most High God he died for you he gave it to you as a gift at Calvary it's yours what will you do with this precious gift you think oh this body it's just just a body of flesh I can treat it any old way Paul said don't commit adultery don't you realize that when you committing adultery you're joining Christ with the harlot Paul said when you commit adultery you're joining Christ with a prostitute now how could you do that because he didn't realize what this body was you say is that true brother Paul said it was true Paul said we had to respect our bodies and we sometimes we make things so supernatural that we forget that these natural things really do mean something don't you realize that this body we are the body of Christ say oh brother that's just talking about the spirit brother don't don't be good don't be talking about your soul don't be talking about he's trying to do that to this flesh but this body was given to me it was given to me by Jehovah and it is a spirit it is a temple a place it is a house where the Spirit of God will dwell and how will you treat this temple that God has given to you and we treat these things so common we'll let those buttons sit in our lives when we don't realize what God has given to us when Christ died on Calvary he died for your sins he died not just for your sins so for when you were accepted 20 years ago or 10 years ago he died right now so that you could be free from these things if you'll just fight for it and accept it by making the decision in your mind that I will claim this promise for myself amen familiarity breeds contempt like I say with Mother's Day that's why we have a Mother's Day because we become so familiar with our mothers that we forget to give them the respect that they are due same thing with Christ we forget to give Christ the respect as do unto them because it comes so familiar amen that we have to take a time a day to to re-orientate ourselves Lord forgive me for treating you with disrespect I come back again I receive you to myself I will be that place that you spoke of that when I returned we'll have a place to land the Dove is brooding over the earth again like you did in Genesis chapter 1 the Spirit of God is brooding over the waters just like he did in Genesis get 1 verse 3 looking for a place to land a man can heal and in your life amen that is the question amen if you will make the decision to be that temple to keep your temple clean to keep a pure amen he is ready for you amen let's just pray Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for all things for giving us this opportunity Lord to be the temple of the Most High God in a dark and evil land Lord and these evil times father weather getting worse and worse that there is a place where there is a lighting Goshen Lord there is a place where your spirit will dwell and it's in me I am your body Lord come and live in me walk to me live move have your being

just thank you Lord for all things and the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen a man as brother as it comes Amen to finish out the service I just want to say God bless you happy Mother's Day amen if anybody desires prayer we're welcome to pray with you you know we don't have to treat the Lord with disrespect a man just like Mother's Day we can have a day with Lord Jesus Christ now is the day of salvation if you have treated the loire with disrespect if you've been disrespecting his temple you can repent right now he died for that to give you that opportunity amen and don't let this opportunity go because the promise has been given to you if you're willing to fight for it amen god bless you aren't you glad God's always on time he paid a debt he did not owe I owed a debt I could
