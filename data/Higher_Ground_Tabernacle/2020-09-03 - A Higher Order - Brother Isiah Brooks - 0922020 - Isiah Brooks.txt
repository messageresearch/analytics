us we thank the lord for his amazing grace thank him for allowing us to be here tonight this truly is the grace of god the more i think about uh what he has done for me in particular and i say us it does something on the inside words cannot express actually the gratitude that i have toward my savior and i am so thankful i'll say it again remember also my wife uh well she's just down there for a time that we're not sure when she's gonna return she's taking care of her mom and uh mom's blood pressure's getting better she's gaining weight and uh so hey let's see what god is doing she's counting the victory she's counting uh and claiming her healing and as long as she wanted she's claiming it we're going to claim it too no matter what it takes god knows what he's doing anyway let us turn to john 17. there's a lot of thoughts that that are uh this is cut off for something okay there's a lot of thoughts it's fine there's a lot of thoughts things i would like to say tonight we trust that god's perfect will be done give me the utterance to say what i need to say and like i said i love john 17 it's one of my favorite chapters in the bible because it basically shows me the relationship between my savior my god and uh revelation 17 23 i and them endow in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me father i will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou loveth me before the foundation of the world that's scriptures of identification amen one more scripture uh passage matthew 10. uh try not to get a whole year too long here but uh we want to read this because i want to show something uh to you on at the end of the message the lord's willing if the lord leads me that way matthew 10 beginning at the 16th verse behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the council and they will scourge you in their synagogues ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake for testimony against them and the gentiles but when they deliver you up take no thoughts how or what ye should speak for it shall be given you in the same hour what ye shall speak for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you i like that speaketh in you and the brothers shall deliver up brothers to death and the father the children and the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that endureth for the to the end shall be saved but when they persecute you in the city flee into another for verily i say unto you ye shall not have gone over the cities of israel till the son of man become ain't god good one more scripture please romans 9 22 through 24 9 29 excuse me 9 22-24 if god willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endure with much long suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he have before prepared unto glory even us whom he have called not of the jews only but also of the gentiles let us pray father god we come before you lord jesus as humbly as we know how we thank you for your mercy and your grace we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for revealing your word and your will for us is our god i pray father that you forgive us of all our sins trespasses and we pray that you would your word will minister to us tonight and we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we like to uh give a title to this message a higher order and we like a sub-topic our destiny the throne room we have been dealing with uh the end time message according to god's up the seals and uttering the seven thunders and i just want to make it clear tonight because it was that at that time when the church age changed up to that point brother branham was actually the seventh angel messenger to the seven church ages he uh was an eos malachi 4. uh revelation 10 7. we know that uh he also what is what we call uh a covenant angel in other words he dealt with two ages overlapping each other seventh church age as well as the bride age we call that the eternal age we have been taught by the prophet of god that what worked for luther will not work for wesley what worked with wesley would not work for the pentecostals and what worked for the pentecostals will not work for the broad age god always made turns he turned corners he's not building a wall he's building a building now for those of us who want to just remain in the seventh church age please feel free to do so but the bride of jesus christ she has one goal in her mind and understand she's the only one that can see the change and hear the change she's the only one that can receive the change everybody in luther's age could not receive what wesley preached everybody in wesley's age could not receive the pentecostal age so therefore everybody in the pentecostal age will not be able to receive the bride age uh we are at a place in time that god is doing such a mighty thing and we look at the chaotic the chaotic system that we're working with we understand by god's grace that we're at a time where the vassals of wrath seem to be controlling all things but understand these vessels is what the prophet god called cannon father they have been if i could say at the backdrop of the background of your glory because sometimes it takes the black tasper street of the night to show the glory of the stars and so god has allowed this chaotic time to to show that there is order even in satan's eden there is a light and lights that shine in the midst of all of this darkness and every light that shine has been predestinated to shine has been created by god to shine now the prophet god tells us that we are now living at the evening time the earthly body is now ready to be dissolved and we're preparing to enter into the heavenly and we now feel the strange call of god to go to this great eden now i don't know whether you feel it but i do there is a pull something moving on the inside that will not allow me to be satisfied in a condition of lukewarmness remember it was a lay of the sea and age that had fallen into lukewarmness i said this is the last time i minister the layers of sea and age or the spirit of laodicea is not a place or a thing it is condition and it's a condition where the people have left their first love and now they are in a lukewarm condition by way of the world and by way of the world and they're trying to hibery something amen to make it work but it cannot be worked but it cannot work god is calling for his bride uh to uh come to a total separation from all unbelief now we realize amen he says now and before we can be born here our little bodies cry out something that had to be provided or we be an afflicted child here if we wasn't god has no afflictions up there there everyone perfectly line up and the bride the bride just exactly like the groom was the word manifested in his season god granted tonight hallelujah children each and every one of you there is a heaven to go to and also there is a hell to stay away from you and i must understand that the work of that we're talking about is not human effort everything that we are experiencing is is because god quickens us that's what makes him so great uh you could be setting somewhere and and and maybe your mind is in a distance but when the holy ghost come he'll quicken you all right in other words he brings to life the seed that's in you by way of his presence and by way of his knowledge now notice when the great moving power of god comes into a son of god it quickens him hallelujah the spirit of life enters into him then what does he do it seats them in heavenly places right now so first of all we must understand if you have been quickened you are you are now sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus every man can't hear this message every christian can't see it that's why the book of revelation says blessed is a man that heareth and seeth you're blessed just being able to see that god has a message for this day and that this message is to prepare you for a translation hallelujah what we were getting in denominationalism and and in just in the seven church ages was not enough to translate us we needed him we needed the very person of the resurrection y'all understand what i'm saying because coming out of the system it's a it's a it's a in type a resurrection because you have been raised from the dead right and now you're living in another age we call eternal the bible tells us that when god quickens us immediately we are now setting in heavenly places right not tomorrow right now that's why the bible said ye are the sons of god now ye are the sons of god not tomorrow right but today whenever the birth takes place you are immediately a son of god or daughter of god but what happens we let the enemy take that away from us and we forget like james say we look into the mirror of the word and we forget what kind of man we ought to be hallelujah and it takes the word of god to do what the spirit of god to quicken you back to yourself is that right come on somebody that's why we repent every day that's why we ask god to forgive us every day because it is the quickening power that brings us back to our senses every time we fall every time we come short it is the quickening power that makes us confess and makes us make it right hallelujah it's not your ability it's god's grace hallelujah that's right it quickens him that spirit of life enters into him and it and it brings you into a heavenly place right we are now not we're already resurrected the dynamics and the mechanics is gone to the work quickening us and we're quickened up into the presence of god where his spirit is did you all hear what i said it says now we are already resurrected oh you say what do you mean i'm already there not that i'm trying to get there i'm already there there's a part of me that's there and there's a part of me that's here and one of these old days this part will meet that part and we'll be won hallelujah amen that's what jesus said he said the son of man how could he be in heaven and on earth at the same time you've heard me talk about relative relativity amen you've heard me how einstein was able to see that as a scientist being able to see that you can be in one place more than one place at at the same time hallelujah it is what it is now you you and i must understand that the word of god comes by faith hallelujah y'all heard about the little girl who was confronted by uh this old old man who thought he he had all uh the answer to her so-called problem uh when he questioned her and he asked her um you believe this bible and she says all of it and he says well you really believe that jonah was swallowed by a whale she says and he says how can you believe that other than by faith hallelujah she says i ask jonah when i get there and he says but what if jonah is not there she said then you ask him hallelujah and she basically shut him up with his reasoning because god said he he literally he created a special fish because he was trying to say you know the the well esophagus a throat is about that big how can god uh fit jonah through there god can do it if he wants to if he means he gotta shrink him and bring him back he can do whatever he wants to he's god like prophet god said if if the bible said jonah swallowed the well i believe it but i'm saying these things because i want you to understand that everything we preach tonight must be received by the faith of god that's in you that's in you now we are seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus in christ jesus setting in there see that great seat that's already fired up been raised from the dead we are part of it and if you are a part of the bride you are because the bride is not of the groom you know so we'll find out that it's the same thing and she'll do just exactly what's predicted for her to do in this day so we don't need to worry if you predict it if god has predestinated you as the bride of jesus christ you will do exactly what he says you say well what do you mean well just you don't want to do it or maybe you're like a jonah running from the presence of god see god has a way of of allowing you to fit into his plan hallelujah and it's not something that god has to scratch his head about because the fish was already prepared before jonah got into the water god knew what he was going to do god knows exactly what you know what we're all going to do what we're going to do and this is a beautiful thing about it god will give you the holy ghost knowing you're going to fall knowing there are times you'll do iniquity i said it knowing you'll do iniquity and yet he still gives us a holy ghost what is iniquity when you know to do good and do it that's not hallelujah you love the lord now we're talking about the throne room how in the world are you going to be part of that but jesus said you would he said if you overcome i'll grant you to sit in my throne even as i have sat in my father's throne now understand the throne in itself is figurative yeah how many of you you know you think you're going to have this big chair up there with a number that can't be number it's going to be sitting in this big chair no you sat in his throne room jesus said i've sat in my father's throne you've never seen jesus carrying a chair no he was talking about their position of authority you will have the authority as i even had the authority hallelujah is that right that's why he said in saint john father i would there be one even as we are one hallelujah is that right and the day jesus was on the time that jesus resurrected from the dead he said all power in heaven and earth is given unto me think about it is that right brother branham see people when you start saying figuratively people think well what are you saying well brother random preached a message revelation is the book of symbols a lot of things are symbolic right like i said you're not going to see jesus up there flipping pages because of the book of life hello he is the book he is the bread he is the book is that right in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god hallelujah and in order to be in the book you have had to be a part of his attributes from the foundation of the world hallelujah before time began you had to be there before god even said let there be light you had to have been there because god is a spirit and god god god was breaking forth and unfolding himself by way of his attributes you know he didn't become god until he created angels because god the word god means to to worship and if there was no angels or anything to worship him he was not yet god but he was also elohim god the existing one hallelujah and don't you know even though he created angels he still was not yet a father he had to have children in order to be a father so god comes down and he unfolds himself like i said the other day and then elohim then from elohim came the word right the word began but you see the word in itself became flesh that was another unfolding of god hallelujah why you say that because jesus said when you see me you have seen the father hallelujah that means god amen the unv invisible god who could not be seen all of a sudden he formed himself into the logo he spoke and the logos came we call that a birth hallelujah that's what we call the sun you understand me not the s-u-n the s-o-n and from that son amen was the beginning of god's creation hallelujah what was it god amen in his infinite wisdom amen sought amen to create himself a human fleshly body to live in so he could fellowship with his creation that's what made the mystery of god so beautiful in the book of genesis because here was adam and the bible said god made him male and female hallelujah now we've seen the male part hallelujah but now it's time to see the female part hallelujah and just like god cut open amen the first adam sighed and brought out bone and that was eve we call her e because she fell but her actual name was adam she bought the very name of her husband hallelujah and so god comes along and he cuts jesus's side by a roman spear he allow it to happen and out come who miss jesus christ but it has taken seven days six days however you want to but my point is in the process of the church ages he had been forming the bride of jesus christ hallelujah and that's why this is important you need to know what part of the body you are somebody help me here see we're living and i'll come back to that in a moment we're in in in the last days there is not another church age that will come after us and when the prophet god was here actually the lay of the syrian age was the very last call he said this is the last warning there will not be another the throne room has been set up the 12 foundations has been laid the streets of gold have been paved the gates of gigantic pearls are raised and hanged like a pyramid she stands so fair and glorious the heavenly being who have prepared her watched breathlessly god was having fun breathlessly yes amen uh uh uh and he's working is out for she glistens and shines with the story of amazing grace in jesus love see that's why i say every stone in the city has a testimony somebody help me here every stone when john says behold the lamb's wife and that new jerusalem comes down glistening with the glory of god and every one of those stones represents somebody's testimony hallelujah for she glistens and shines with the glory that is unearthly every facet of her beauty tells a story of amazing grace and jesus is love she is a city prepared for a pair of prepared people she awaits only for her inhabitants and soon they were thrown her streets with joy the city you know the city awaits me hallelujah i wish you the inhabitants it's it's waiting on us he says it's done it's finished and it's waiting on us see god didn't like us you know finishes up everything at the last minute he's he's got it already prepared y'all hear what i'm saying and now the city is waiting on who the redeemed the bride of jesus christ but we've got just a little bit more work to do hallelujah we must put the devil under our feet hallelujah we do not leave out of here as fair yes we leave out of here as conquerors even so paul said we're more than conquerors hallelujah yes it's the last call the spirit will not speak in another age the ages are over hallelujah that's the leadership church age is that all right let's read revelation the third chapter i've quoted it a little bit already 21st through the 22nd uh verses and it reads to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even i i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne now god didn't let jesus christ bypass nothing he had to overcome i think about it sometimes when they slapped him in the face when they sped on him and the bible said he he didn't open his mouth he could not because the scripture said he would not he was a lamb led to the slaughter can god lead you as a lamb to the slaughter hallelujah yeah he said what's been done in the green shall also be done in the drive hallelujah there's a persecution coming there's a pressure coming and god is is expecting us to overcome hallelujah how with me sweetness and meekness oh we don't pick up a sword like like like uh our brother did peter hallelujah we're not here to fight with the natural things our weapon and our warfare is spiritual not carnal spiritual guess where the sword is in your mouth he that have an ear let him hear what the spirits say to the church now the prophet god now understand that this message is given to a special class of people everybody can't get it and when the devil tells you you ain't nothing tell him i'm sorry god has already called me special hey god called me special y'all understand me i didn't get those words are not mine those words are years i receive that i'm a special i'm a special class of people hallelujah let me tell you something god will work with you individually every day if you allow him to i've seen god do things that i guess i don't feel like i don't i don't need to tell you but i can tell you something a lot of times people think well we're waiting on the third pool hello the third pool is here you're a part of it oh my god you're a part of it what are we waiting on what was the sign to lao to see a church agent you know what the sign was a prophet did y'all know that that was a the sign to the laodicean age was a prophet whenever you see a prophet first of all he comes to straighten you out he comes amen with judgment right every time israel had a prophet it came god brought him to bring them out of something and take him into something for example moses brought him out of egypt and the intent was to take him into the promised land is that right no it took him out of the anteluvian world and brought him into a new world but before he could bring him into judgment had to strike hallelujah 1962 judgment struck the west coast and now we're seeing it rumbling and thundering our way and basically it's hitting the world at large right because when it left the west coast it headed back to the east hallelujah and now you see earthquakes famines pestilence floods hurricanes you name it every natural disaster that can possibly hit the earth is now hitting the earth and even china right now is suffering see you say well what do you mean god will raise up a man as judgment to the church put pressure on them put some persecution on them and then after god uses that man he's a vessel of dishonor never believed god never received god and god does what he wants to do with him afterwards he said you can recall that i mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make the this book real it is going to take the operation of the holy ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with a prophetic insight and it requires the ability to hear from god it will require supernatural instructions not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear this is what i'm saying and yet the churches want to get rid of the holy ghost we need it because no matter how much i preach from here if the holy ghost do not anoint your heart and ears you won't be able to see what i'm trying to say that's why so many people walk out and don't come back to the next week because the bible has this word come together when you see that day approaching come together the more i'm still looking for the more yet more people in the church i'm still looking amen because they're not getting it and the reason why is because they don't see the season they're living in hello let me tell you something there's been an exodus already out of denominationalism organizationalism hallelujah and we're part of that huh y'all hear what i'm saying and why did we come out of that because we heard his voice come out of her my people be not partakers of her sin hallelujah is that right oh yes i had a very supernatural experience with that when i was in the organization amen i was up on the choir singing i forgot what song we were singing i mean the power of god was in the place i heard come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sin people i didn't even know that was in the book of revelation we worked hard not to read the book of revelation and to my discovery we find out that it's in the book of revelation god spoke to me now you don't have to believe that but he did and guess what i came out god who in sunday at times and in davis man of spake and time pass unto the fathers by the prophets and it may look like i'm trying i'm trying to get take her somewhere just bear with me and have in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he have appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world and i apologize as hebrew the first chapter one through three who being the brightness of his glory hallelujah and the expressed image of his person and up holding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins set down on the right hand of the majesty on eye hallelujah do you mind if i read the uh amplified just for a little bit in many separations in many separate revelations each of which set forth a portion of the truth and in different ways god spoke of oh to our forefathers and in and by the prophets i like that different ways he unfolded himself jehovah jireh jehovah nisi jehovah shalom different ways he he broke it open by way of the prophets revealing himself now remember it was israel's business to know the father it was the gentiles business to know the son in the holy spirit the bride's business to know the holy spirit y'all hear what i'm saying this is why uh a layer of seer spirit was able to do the church by saying that the evidence of the holy ghost is speaking in tongues it doesn't mean that the holy ghost doesn't speak in tongues but it's not the evidence that means every time i see somebody speaking in tongues that's the that's the holy ghost not so not so amen the tongues is a is a gift of god matter of fact according to paul it is the least of the gifts but the bride knows that hallelujah she understand the difference between the the the counterfeit and the real one because the real holy ghost brings about a change hallelujah you can say i got the holy ghost all you want to and they haven't been a change in your life something's wrong hallelujah and i'm not saying you ain't got it maybe you just got it on your spirit on your flesh and you haven't allowed to break a birth in your soul now get me right being that we are bride doesn't mean that we become sin free or sin less hallelujah the bible said if you say you have not sinned then you make him a liar but we understand that our sin freedness if you want to say it comes by his justification he justifies us hallelujah that's what makes the difference y'all understand me he sanctify us that's what makes the difference your flesh will never be sanctified until god changes it and that is at the coming of the lord hallelujah but in the last days he has spoken to us in the person of a son whom he appointed heir and lawful owner of all things also by and through whom he created the worlds and re and the in the and the reaches of space and the age of time he made produced built operated arranged them in order in other words he did it all the same god is that right in the beginning was a word the word was with god the word was god the bible tells us that everything that was made was made by him hallelujah amen hallelujah one thing about signs jesus christ even gave john a sign to identify him because always a sign come before the voice and john had already been told that this would be jesus christ the one you see the dove descending now mind you though there were other people around john they did not see the dove descending they didn't see the light is that right remember the voice of god is given to the elected even when paul fell from his horse called saul amen paul heard the voice of god and those around him only heard thunder hallelujah and that's how it is in the message there are those who have heard thunder but they have not heard the voice in other words the book becomes sealed still yet until we can hear the voice y'all hear what i'm saying the voice must speak can i say it like this the vision must speak and when the vision speaks it becomes plain to the man who can hear hallelujah you know god wise god is a god of wisdom he said he have hidden it hidden these revelations from the wise and the prudent hallelujah if you feel like you're nobody you're the one god wants to use you're the one god wants to reveal this word to you because see you don't see feel like you're too mighty you're not so great you understand that everything that i have come by the grace of god and i'm explaining to you what i mean by hearing because you know you and i we we understand the the seven seals and the seven thunders how it brother battle began to break the word open to us but the saddest part about this is that when that cloud appeared in 1963 and i meant to bring my book but that's okay we failed to see that something changed remember i said that also that brother branham before 63 he was an angel would come to him he see visions not meaning that these things stopped but something changed when that sword hit his hand something changed that was when god recognized him as a matured son of god literally giving him the king's sword and then brother branham likens the king's sword to the seven thunders the opening of the word the third pull go go read that's what he said and if that king's sword listen it goes right back to the word because that's what the king sword was the reveal word for the hour hallelujah and each and every one of us has to eat the book because the prophet god said we were a type of john y'all understood me john was a type of the bride so you got to eat the book what book the very words that he has spoken since then not just you say what do you mean i mean for your day i'm losing somebody because you're not you're not following me don't worry about your theology right now just listen to if god got me here as a minister listen to what i'm trying to tell you stop blocking what i'm trying to say because you and i must understand the life of christ must feel you and how on earth are you going to know what is required for you if you don't know your position i got quotes to back me up on that you got to understand there's a position the bride must take and maintain hallelujah we must come to a place where jesus himself will say that he's pleased to dwell in us is that right father would there be one even as we are one what was it as i said the last minute time the flesh in itself still has to be redeemed but that's the part god came to redeem it was the soul as well but the soul in the spirit has already been redeemed it is your flesh that god wants that was that third that was that part of god that that that fell right come on y'all where's the high breeding it ain't in your soul it's in your flesh why don't you have control what made it so that you felt you you liked the control of your flesh because when satan gained control of the earth he gained control of your flesh because your flesh came from his earth the dust of the earth and therefore he has been ruling this flesh for 2 000 or 6 000 and it took jesus christ to come redeem back the body hallelujah to wit god was in christ hallelujah with the redemption of your body to witness the redemption of your body this is what god comes to do to redeem your body that's why you fight with it every day and paul says kill it don't dwell with the inhabitants come on somebody is that right that was part of the promised land y'all know that right joshua was a part of the holy the promised land he went into the prophecy they they over the uh uh jordan which means death comes over there and and now you've got to die in this land and while you're dying you got to conquer so what do you mean die you got to die to your will those 10 spies came back with their own will instead of submitting to the will of god they came back with a false report and until you relinquish your will and give it to god you're going to always come back with a false report god i can't do it when god says you can greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world hallelujah paul said we're more than conquerors through christ jesus we're able to take the land is that right that's what brother brahma said he said joshua you know parallels ephesians and ephesians is there amen telling us to take the land know who you are know what you are this is what this message came to do right remember it was god who called you out of laodicea hallelujah that means he's chosen you to be bride somebody help me here he's chosen you to be bride you've heard his voice you came out and let god do the work now hallelujah right and i'm saying all of this because so many people down the cloud if you down the cloud get rid of the cloud you've gotten rid of the message of the eighth day you've gotten rid of amen the age the self the eternal age you you've gotten rid of the word that gonna bring you to a perfection you have gotten rid of the word that's gonna bring the invisible union you say brother books that ain't no brother ben was doing something great he said you cannot teach supernatural things to pentecostal babies what was he talking about he was talking about the age of pentecost pentecostal babies they didn't grow no no better no bigger no larger no they never matured ever remain babies because they fail to eat the word that was given to them and because of that hello is that right revelation the third chapter jesus christ is outside of the church age knocking trying to get back in because what the lay of the sins put them out this age that we're dealing with look at look at look at the apostasy they don't even know right from wrong anymore hallelujah things that they would not allow they allow now what god knows it's amazing grace and god is love where the bible tells me not only is he love but he's a consuming fire he's a god of judgment they don't want to preach judgment you preach judgment they're going to put you out oh that's too hard not for a true son and daughter of god bring it on correct me now hallelujah let me get sanctified now let me get filled with the holy ghost now let me move on up i need his correction so so you can understand what did god do he tells us that in the scriptures we'll see him face to face and the only thing i know of is that when i look in the mirror i look in the mirror and i see face to face coming into the very image and likeness of god by looking into the mirror of the word hallelujah that you are so covered with the blood of jesus christ that only the only face god can see is the face of jesus christ hallelujah you understand me why was the prophet caught up into the head what was it that he was getting from the head he wasn't caught up into the eyes he was caught up into the mind of god that's where it was hidden because no no man nor no angel knew what was there and at that point in time god began to unfold to the prophet god even when he came from that experience what was what was god doing that was a sign that was the beginning of his coming back is that right because he told them he says in like manna when jesus began to resurrect when he rose from after talking with the disciples the bible said that he was received up into the clouds he said what you gazing at what you looking at i'm going to come again in like manner and he did but that's the beginning not the ending but that was a sign to you that he didn't forget about you that was a sign to you it's time to move the mighty ages on the move hallelujah he's now got you out and he's seeking his bride among the ones that did come out hallelujah no egg cans are in this no he can't he says now science took the picture of it you've seen it went on associated press they didn't know what it was there's a cloud hanging 26 miles high that 15 miles or 20 above even where vapor is at they don't know what it is what it's all going about and they are trying to investigate it and there right under it i was standing and those seven angels roaring out their voices hello roaring out their voices of those seven seals standing there and to witness three of us as a witness of the things that were prophesied on this tape sir what is the time and there now there you're listen look how down the road we are over 50 years since this been happening and we're now waking up why he said that the message was ahead of everything history has to catch up somebody it's the truth we have to that's why god holding it is that right they were on their road to emmaus and jesus was preaching to him and he held their eyes to they could not see who he was until he broke the bread hello and god is holding our eyes on a lot of things but now something moved i'm trying to tell you something is moving and the bride of jesus christ is going to get it you've been ordained to get it hallelujah i ain't trying to put no fear in you i'm not even trying to think you think you're going to you got to do this and do that the bible says not by power not by might but by my holy spirit it is god it's not him who will it though he that run it but it's god who shows mercy hallelujah hallelujah scientists knows it's everything that's why i try to tell people i said these these people who stood around this message all years 30 years 40 years amen and now they they get they've gone why because they only had an intellectual conception they never had a real birth what you're talking about i know a brother who was a close friend of mine travel overseas when it came to preaching and breaking into the word amen you know at least what we call it amen and i don't think nobody could preach serpent seed like that man could where is he now denouncing this message the man who taught me one of the main men taught me through the scriptures this message is now no longer believing it am i to die i'm supposed to faint like i try to tell people i knew jesus before i knew them and god has never failed me yet and he never will he never will my point is this pressure is coming squeeze is coming hallelujah you're going to turn your back on god when you don't have rent a car payment huh what you going to do he's still god don't limit god even if you get hungry he's still a bread maker god can bring money from nowhere we're serving the real god you've got to know where you are and guess what the greatest battle ever fought is in your mind because that's where you come from out of the mind of god that's why the word of god says let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus what who thought it not robbery to be equal with god i went through this the other day most of us feel you're so scared you're so scared to even claim that because you feel like maybe maybe maybe i'm moving into idolatry or maybe i'm moving into something that's bigger than me it's been ordained this is who you are this is what you are and it's unbelief if you can't claim it uh is something wrong with you if you don't go after it hallelujah is that right the prophet god said listen this message is full of blessings he said if i wasn't tall enough to go get it he said i climb up a ladder i find a way to get my blessings i find a way to get those things that are my inheritance hallelujah maybe y'all don't remember these and maybe you never did it but mama used to put the candy on a high shelf and that high chef amen amen was always a struggle hi i'm gonna get that candy when mama ain't looking but you know that old smart little boy gonna find something to get on top of y'all understand me he gonna get that candy and mom said how in the world did you get up there because you know what you do you hide you put away the thing that you helped that helped you like a stool or chair or whatever oh y'all don't know what i'm talking about right y'all been christian little babies hallelujah but you know it's the truth amen sometime when they put things in places that was not for you to go you went anywhere you found a way of getting into it but this has been put there for you to get into it let me ask you a question there is only one god now how you going to sit in his throne except you be a part of him oh my god hallelujah you've got to accept your portion of the godhead if i can say it like that i'm not trying to stumble nobody but i'm trying to tell you that that man was an unfolding of god we'll see the pill of fire we see that but we fail to see the man part and what did god make adam he made him a god and what did god call the prophets gods whom the word of god comes to hallelujah and guess what we're priests and kings hallelujah not of america but of that new jerusalem hallelujah and now god is trying to get our minds cleared up this thing is about grace hallelujah you know paul paul never became that that first messenger of that angel amen because of his studies he studied under gamalia he was a straight a student but paul said i've got to die to that i gotta count all of my teachings as dung in order for me to learn jesus christ for me to know him and paul did it for me to die his gain he says i must die to my will my ways and everything i must die that i might gain christ recognizing the part of the body you fit in and if you the bride the bride is a part of the husband the only place that you ever recognize it is recognize what part of the husband the word you are or you can't recognize being the bride hello are you a part of laodicea or you're a part of the capstone somebody help y'all so you're scared to even say it you're part of the capstone you say well what that's why when jesus christ do come again after the resurrection he brings his bride with him she's part of him but in just different bodies somebody help me here hallelujah the only place that you'll ever recognize it is recognize what part of that husband the word you are or you can't recognize being the bride how many sees that you know what that comes from the future home you've got to recognize what part right we're in the intelligence of god brother branham represented the eyes but the eyes took us away here the intelligence let this mind be in you why you think paul said that that was also in christ jesus he was the intelligence of god he was a mind of god why because god was in him you're the only people that god will ever share his mind with it's a covenant it's a unity do you know when you marry somebody it's a bond to death do us part it's a bonding y'all hear what i'm saying it's a union hallelujah he said in that day you'll know i'm in the father of the fathers in me and i am in you a union now i'm going to tell you something when i in the father father and me he and me and everything and when you look at me you just see one i don't grow three heads hallelujah just one man that's why jesus said if you know me you know the father somebody help me here what is it what you here for it's a manifest calvary to show the devil that god won he still wins he is the victor he conquered death hell in the grave for who his bride hallelujah roman romeo and juliet can't touch this hallelujah snow white and the seven dwarf can't touch this there ain't no story men can make up that can touch the love affair of god even solomon when he wrote the songs of solomon he did the best he could but let me tell you something you can't even understand that without revelation that was god inspired but that same songs of solomon need meditation and revelation because if you read songs of solomon you cannot you in trouble now that's the truth you can't recognize somebody else's day what if moses would have come with noah's message and noah was part of it but it wouldn't have worked what if jesus would have come with moses message it wouldn't have worked see it was different age it was a different prophecy a different part of the word had to be fulfilled there was there was in another day of the week they were in another day of the week y'all understand me that's why pentecost won't work here we're in the age of perfection am i am something wrong you and i must understand this is what a lot of the message believers have caught they got us standing there at pentecost let me tell you like this there's nothing wrong with the gifts i believe that the gifts should be in the church some people may not believe that but i believe but most of all right the statue of a perfect man must be the very very can i say it like this the very motive and move of god in you right because without the statue of a peru man the headstone cannot connect this is why so many people god is still unconnected see there has not been a union only by mouth but the union of god brings you into jesus in you hallelujah it is in that time amen you and christ become really one and the very work she did on earth is what you and i supposed to do now hey there is no laziness in god there is no slaughterness in god there is no lukewarmness in god it's fired up those early saints of god when the holy ghost filled them they were on fire you said what do you mean let me tell you something god sanctified them that's why they were able to get the holy ghost on the day of pentecost he said i breathed on you and they were sanctified we need some breathing we need some wind blowing hallelujah amen john said 14 5-7 thomas said unto him lord we know whether thou got and how can we know the way jesus says i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto me unto the father but by me huh you'll never know the father until you come by jesus because at some point in time jesus says listen i'm gonna go i'm leaving you but i'm going to be what i was before i came what was he before he came to the earth he was a pill of fire because when paul saw him on the on the road to damascus who art thou lord l o capital l i am jesus hallelujah when he stood there as a man he said i came in my father's name and ye will not receive me but to them that will receive me i gave them power to become the sons of god i gave them the authority listen there is always going to be a majority of people that's going to reject him there's going to be a majority of people that's going to come back with a false report but understand god didn't do all of this for nothing he's going to get those who he came for hallelujah i believe joshua and caleb was just a shadow and type to know that there's going to be a few hallelujah is that right because the headstone goes up is that what brother bam said he said and as the age goes he said fewer and fewer and fewer people will be saved now they can't be there to lay of the seal because that's a big platform but as it goes up it gets narrower and narrower hallelujah anyhow what what's the problem with us we need to really believe and accept the message whatever brother says and whatever god said through him we ought to say amen we need to learn how to meditate on it we need to stop looking at ourselves as just sinners are saved by grace we are but we have a position in christ now hallelujah is that right i cannot imagine amen rahab always talking about what happened to her in jericho her life changed somebody helped me i'ma say it again her life changed her family changed everything changed jesus said in 14 20 of john he said at that day you'll know that i am in my father ye and me and i in you but the comforter john 14 26 which is the holy ghost whom the father will sin in my name he shall teach you all things now isn't that amazing the holy ghost got the same name jesus god and the father got the same name jesus god hallelujah that means they all named jesus why because it's just three manifestations of the same god i'm a husband i'm a preacher i'm a grandfather but my name is isaiah brooks because of my positions my name doesn't change and that's the way it is it's so simple but the intellectuals have made it difficult because they brought in the babylonian doctrine of trinity into the christianity is this okay i'm trying to get us if i can get you to see what i'm all i know is you know i've been doing a lot of crying just because i can see things i had never seen before and i'm not saying nobody else ain't preaching this i'm just saying i'm seeing something about me i'm seeing something that god has done for me that i didn't know i hadn't recognized it now i'm beginning to recognize and then really the fully the the message from me it's more than speaking in tongues it's more than shouting and dancing it's more than that it's maturing it's it's literally allowing the the the divine nature to take control so much so and i i love this quote what brother brahm said the early church was so in tune with god all he had to do was nod his head and they knew what to do that's what i'm saying maybe i'm dumb but i put it this way i want to know god so much and so well that all he has to do is nod i can just feel it and interpret and interpret his body movement and know what he wants me to do he see see that's what the church is doing today for jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the bride is a part of the groom therefore the word that is to be fulfilled now are we being called out to a marriage is that right it's matthew 25 and is what's happening we've been called out to go into a marriage is that right so listen and if you are if he is the brah if he's a groom that means you're the bride right remember the word is always male i don't care what people say today they want to make god a woman that's nonsense only the word the word always represents the male part of god the flesh represents the bride part of god i got a quote for that but anyway that's why i was bold enough to say it hallelujah why because the word could never fall but the flesh fell amen huh that's why brother woman said that adam didn't fall in that sense he walked out willfully that's why you can't be deceived because you're the word if it was possible which is not you can't not be deceived i ain't talking about your flesh i'm talking about your soul hallelujah is that right because jesus said to the woman at the well i'm gonna give you living waters i'm gonna give you water amen and you'll never thirst again that's why we're not looking for some other man of god we've met jesus christ there's no releasing us from this message we're not going to walk from it we're not no sir we're anchored and our souls are anchored behind the veil it is people he's got your soul anchored your flesh might want to quit but god won't let you quit i give up god says like give up what you ain't going nowhere right he'll let you wander a little bit he'll snatch you right on back huh he can quicken you amen which is a real loving thing to do or he can spank you and run you back home he's got ways to do it hallelujah therefore the word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day i'm going to say it again why do you think the message has been crucified afresh because of you and we know what moses did he broke the continuity of the word but at the same time we understand that the bride must go through some of the same things that jesus went through and she'll still have the same power i understand what i'm trying to say now you're at a mature you're you're in a mature place a mature age right you mean to tell me you're going to let the earlier church before you out do you no and it's not a competition but what i'm trying to say amen a strong tree can hold more apples than a young one the strength is in the tree and the strength of god's supposed to be in you y'all understand me you are the tree of life because he is i learned something and uh i haven't searched it out yet but i had a brother call me the other day and you know he said brother books have you ever noticed that a fig tree doesn't have a female tree i'm like what yeah they're male and female one tree that's what i was told they don't pollinate that one tree the fig tree produces whatever it needs to produce male and female to bring forth figs quite interesting because that's jesus himself hallelujah and he calls israel what the fig tree well jesus christ didn't say come on bride ah y'all see we're two but we're one it was one in him he was male and female and that male and female produce what is that right the new jerusalem the mother of us all that's your bible hallelujah when god separated adam i just a little bit long i know i'm almost done i let you go at 9. he was bought he was both we found out adam was spirit to begin with he made man in his own image created male and female and then genesis 2 on he created man out of the dust of the earth man was created in god's image god is a spirit so he's a spirit man then when he become flesh out of the flesh on the earth he is he is showing portraying here the bride the fleshy part he never taken and made another being but he took part of adam the original creation took him from him a real from the side and took the feminist spirit out of the atom and left the masculine spirit in there and placed it into the feminist part y'all understand what he did he took the natural part and the spiritual part to make the woman hallelujah therefore part of the spirit part of his body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life and that's the way the bride is to christ you know why i'm kind of like going down sleep teaching a little bit kind of slowly because one day i i'm looking i'm expecting to preach it but i want to make sure you know where i'm getting this from because amen this is exciting to me to know that god has done a thing with us and now my eyes are opening my spiritual eyes are beginning to see amen exactly who i am and what i am right remember i said this the other day god didn't brother brahma didn't say when when the bride recognized who jesus is he did not say when the bride recognized who the father is the he said when the bride recognized who she is the rapture will then take place we're the last part of redemption when the bride is fully redeemed it's over it's over time really will be no more right i heard the prophet god said that when jesus christ come he said time will be no more just today in his corporal so this this this what we see in the visual in the in the clouds amen it's the beginning of this huh what happens eliezer introduces us to isaac and we're caught up to meet him in the air is that right she leaped off of her holy ghost holy ghost camel right and she met him brother said when she leaped off that was a type of her going into the air that's what this message is doing he said hey when everybody's denying the cloud he said but that's my lord the same thing john did that's my lord i get goosebumps up here i don't know what y'all feeling out there but this thing is really moving me amen he said he said listen he said that's why the rapture of the royal seed has to come first and the rest of the dead lived not for a thousand years then they were brought up at the white throne judgment see there is no judgment to the royal seed or predestinated seed of abraham if you'll take saint john 5 24 listen to this he that heareth my word and abideth on him believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life in closing for tonight lord willing i'll be here sunday he's at a wicked and adulterous generation that's matthew 16 4. seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet jonas and he left them and departed brethren said that was a sign of the resurrection first of all when the prophet of god came one of the greater things that he needed to do he showed the church world that jesus christ is risen his whole ministry he kept trying to tell the people don't look at me i'm not here to proclaim myself i came to proclaim the one who's who died for me he said that's jesus christ he said if i could heal all of you he said i would but i can't heal i don't have no power to heal you if i had power to heal you therefore i would have power to save you he said but i came to declare that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever not william branham y'all i tell you the two and i want you to understand when i say things like that god knows my heart i'm not saying anything against the prophet i'm just trying to tell you what the prophet has tried to do and we have allowed men to take the glory of god and put it on the prophet when he thought all of his life practically trying the people trying to get the people not to do that then we come around and do the very thing once he leave he left right now it's now now now the bible says according to hebrew when the veil is lifted is when they turn to the lord once you turn back to the lord jesus christ knowing that everything that did happen it was jesus christ knowing that the prophet of god had his place but jesus christ is your headship it is he who you fall in love with hallelujah it is he who you marry it is he you enjoying to is he a man who who save you or is he who's coming back for you hallelujah and this message is more than books and tapes it's a life and you and i must come somewhere we must come into a place where that life must enter into us if it does not we make no rapture amen you love the lord i've got to stop there but you and i must understand there's a there's a when israel traveled when they left the uh promised land they didn't just stop there in canaan only there was a mountain they had to possess y'all hear what i'm saying that's the type of the thunders and everything else amen and so cain uh uh uh joshua and caleb at the end of the day oh man joshua will say i still got my strength how long you been in the ho in god you still got your strength he said i got as much strength as i had when i was young what i need and what i want is my mountain give me my mountain and that's what we should understand we have a mountain you call it mount zion where the bride of jesus christ was set on the top of it with her husband oh my god i can't even father in my mind it's beyond me but i tell you what as long as we sit still and think god is just oh i'm just sitting still i'm going to be just ease in zion right god hates that he basically calls it lukewarm not the bride he said i would that you'd be hotter cold and if we're not hot you need to ask god to give you some hot give you some heat i pray all the time i want him i don't care i'm crazy looking right i don't care what i look like to other people i don't care if i lose all my friends or relatives and whatever more i don't care there's only one thing that i want and i'll let nothing stop me from getting it that ought to be your attitude hallelujah amen esther said if i perish let me perish i'm going to see the king and i'm telling you if you don't have that attitude about you you need to ask god to give it because i'm going to tell you what the pressure is going to come and if you're not rooted and grounded in your belief i ain't saying you got to be the strongest person because he said amen in our weakness he is our strength hallelujah god ain't going to let you go down if your bride he ain't gonna let can i say it again he's not going to let you go down we have not been ordained to go down we've been ordained to go up but you've got to have confidence that he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it i don't know how he's going to do it but he promised he promised me he promised you let's stand he promised standing on the promises of christ my king can you can we sing that and then i wanted to show you this little thing it's about 11 minutes and i just forgot about it but it's something i showed uh today and i'm not going to say that this is uh uh accurate or whatever uh you may be seated just a moment i forgot about it if troy would play that for me just something that somebody showed me i want you to understand if it doesn't happen this way it's happening and we must understand that we are in this thing where the one world order is going to take over now how far into this thing we will go i don't know we understand that this chip and everything that they're doing that's not the mark of the beast how many all know that hello that's not the mark of the beast but i still ain't taking it understand me and all i've heard with my own ears different states massachusetts is now trying to pass laws where it must be a mandate compulsory for you to take the vaccine i don't take a flu vaccine so how you gonna make me do anything else let me ask you a question before this young man before we start how many of us are willing to give up our freedom god made you free you think god gonna bring you out and then put you on another pharaoh and listen the prophet of god said well you better believe it he said ramses he's coming ramsay is coming that was my phone sorry about that you go ahead brother i've taken too much time i feel led to do this you know because i want people to give some kind of idea you know of what we're getting ready to deal with and like i said if all of this is not true understand something's moving and it's pretty dark and it's not just our government it's the whole world y'all understand what i'm saying what am i trying to say get scared no i'm saying make your calling in the election sure this is your time to make your calling an election sure right go ahead brother y'all know they say that the world ain't going back to where it was and they calling it the new normal been seeing it all over the news and some of y'all still out here voting can y'all we're going to a different place which is a new normal a new normal a new normal new normal a new normal new normal embrace the new normal the new normal the new normal the new normal new normal this new normal is going to look very very different not normal but a new normal the new normal new normal there will be a new normal a new normal new normal a new normal than you know a neo-normal this is the new normal this is our new normal our new normal a new normal our new normal new normal of the new normal our new normal we will transition into the new normal this will be the new normal until a vaccine is developed i'm teresa greenfield and in iowa we take care of our own but really teresa greenfield takes care of herself as an executive greenfield helped run a home building company into bankruptcy it's very hard to do something the first time it is very easy to do something the second time what does a magician want you to do when he's doing a trick he wants you to look at the hand that's not doing the trick so you don't see the hand that's doing it they just want human consciousness to go in a certain way problem reaction solution problem reaction solution ladies and gentlemen that's how they do it you create the problem you get the reaction from the public on the basis of the way you've explained the problem which is not actually what happened and then you offer the solutions to the problems you have created something else that i said problem reaction solution was that the protests they needed the protest in order to justify the second wave bang what's matter protest pulling down statues the whole focus of attention has gone somewhere else there are other reasons for that but it's taken the focus away when the real focus should be look at the economic devastation of these lockdowns on every community any that should be the focus this happened just at the right time that they wanted it to get exactly the reaction that they wanted so maybe there's more to know about this and it's not just only what you see and i think there is more to come out about all that i really do it's kind of freaky folks you know when you see that sort of stuff you can see how long they've had this plan in the making you know worldwide economic forum rolling out their whole plan to restructure the world the great reset that we need to combat this terrible crisis and the terrible state of police brutality that we find ourselves in everything that these people who run the world economic forum have done and now they're offering us their solution which is to basically lock everybody into a smart prison the thing that will get us back is the vaccine until we have a vaccine zero tolerance so every time we see a case we basically pounce on it the vaccine vaccine the vaccine the vaccine to all seven billion people almost every expert agrees a vaccine is the fastest way to get our world back you know it's so important to get not just hundreds of millions but literally billions of those vaccines legislative amendments that would make vaccinations mandatory for public school students unless they have a medical exemption the vaccine is the thing that will change things the vaccine the vaccine on the issue of the vaccine which you've said in the past could take a year to 18 months will we have to wait for a vaccine to hug our family and friends who are outside of our bubble you know we'll have to prepare for the next one that will get attention this time they're really pushing the second wave but this is just the beginning folks it's not going to go away i said that months ago this is not going to go away they're going to release the lock down a little bit and then they're going to ramp it up even more what they want to do you know the kovi past pass that everybody needs to have to show their infection free all the stuff they want to do they're trialling it in africa now they're calling it a trust pass to make sure you're vaccinated a vaccination record payment system is what they're talking about this is the payment system they want you to be scanned retinal scan facial scan biometric scans and that's how you're going to be paying you won't need cash anymore you won't even need your smartphone anymore you will be paying with your face and of course you'll need a record of vaccination in order to enter the store to begin with a cashless economy where people make purchases with their faces a giant network of surveillance cameras with facial recognition helps police monitor citizens ready for the new era of big brother this time is super surveillance maybe for your own good temperature a couple of years ago i did a show called giving life to lucifer when i talked about the whole role out of this smart grid the ais system and i said that in 2025 we are set to be in a very very different reality to where we are now by 2025 the whole system will be controlled by ai that's the way it's going if you can understand ai you can understand that ai is working to gain control for itself and you understand how these computer models work and why they're so now over the top and so the figures were so wrong but if you can think of a way of controlling and corralling human beings then it all begins to make sense it doesn't matter if the figures are wrong they just want human consciousness to go in a certain way and they want to merge us with the machine and you know the question is who is they and when you look at it folks it's like they is now ai the ai is already there you know we're waiting for artificial intelligence to emerge but really it's already emerged folks it's already there online we're just not looking at things the right way and what it's doing is it's basically creating a system whereby we are going to be completely dependent upon artificial intelligence in order to survive in order to perform everyday activities even going outside and purchasing a meal you're going to need the whole thing controlled by artificial intelligence to be able to move through that reality through the new world they're creating when you look at things such as the industrial revolution and you look at the periodic changes that society goes through every 50 to 100 years even more so every 200 years there's always the birth of a new reality comes from the one before a new beginning if you will but what is the new beginning we're moving into it's really going to be a reality that is totally controlled by ai if we're not careful yeah the politicians i don't even think the politicians know exactly what they're doing i think too many people who've been involved in setting this up really bargained for what they were going to be getting it's like all the rock stars and the pop stars and all the superstars and all the sports stars and all these people that kept society distracted for so many years i said yeah a few weeks ago the miley cyruses and the madonnas and all these people have been used to keep us distracted they're all finding themselves on equal par now you know that video that madonna did in the bath when she was saying well we're all equal now if one goes down we all go down you know synonymous with the whole of society i mean because all the people all the rock stars and all the people that they paid all these exorbitant amount of money to keep us distracted they don't care about them they're all going down too i said that a few weeks ago you know it'd be a bit of a shock for these people to find themselves all locked in their own houses all having to deal with social distancing forget all that rock star world all the pop star world concerts and sports games and all that sort of stuff it's not going to happen folks it's not going back to normal people think that you know this is just a temporary thing no it's not there's also a new action called protect our neighbors folks you know they're wonderful aren't they they want you to spy on your neighbors basically folks like i said all the sleeping masses are the ones who are going to drag us into this if we're not careful so there's now a new program whereby you can protect your neighbors by keeping an eye on them making sure they're social distancing basically spying on them and dubbing them menu if they're doing the wrong thing under the guise of protecting them you know now is the time for everybody to realize that you know there's a war being waged against us and we have a lot of tools that we can use to fight this war and we can fight on the digital battlefield hit twitter hit facebook hit everywhere you can do everything you can to get the word out to people folks because there's nothing more important than this issue our whole world is changing it's not going to go back we're at a time in history where we find ourselves on the front line all of us we're on the front line here folks that's the thing older people just don't realize world war iii has already started it's a war that's being waged against the people of the world by the politicians of the world the problem is that people don't realize it's happening this response to this this social isolation this removal of even our oxygen we're not wearing masks this is such but like i said it's complete everything they're doing to us is to make us sick folks and that will be your second wave and the second wave will be fear and paranoia driven more than anything else i mean the first wave is fear and paranoia driven i mean how can i even have a second wave there wasn't a first wave there hasn't ever been a it's all been about this legislation it's all been about this police state the whole thing ladies and gentlemen these parasitic morons that we have masquerading as government what matters is that we realize what's happening and we realize the steps we need to take to get ourselves out of what's happening those steps we need to take to find freedom again i'm teresa greenfield and in iowa we take care hey man we appreciate your patience you might probably think it wasn't necessary but i just basically wanted to uh update you on some things and like i said if all is true that's fine we at least know where the world is headed nothing that we should fear but i think that we should understand that the time we're living in and i'll just give you a scripture because malachi 4 says that when that elijah would come what comes after it elijah has been going over 50 years now judgment firefall that's what made you know the elijah of malachi 3 john the baptist because the malachi 4 brings judgment and it was this this prophet of god that stood there and said i indict this generation god brought judgment west coast 1962 and then alaska almost sunk now we're at a time where everybody's you know busy busy busy it's a trick of the enemy and and you better understand we better refocus our lives amen and to make sure that you're right with god in your heart one of the worst things we could ever experience as individuals is to be left behind because we know no more truth than anybody else and so i i like i said i'm not i'm just trying to bring in more concern in the hearts of the people that they may understand that this thing is nothing to play with when a government can something can shut down the whole world put a fear on the entire world and understand if they didn't have the internet and have had the the circuits of of news and things like that they could have never done it but because they uh have the ability to do this we know that it's time because brother branham and the word of god says that even when those two prophets are killed in jerusalem that the whole world will be able to see so we know it is a is in an era where electronics and it's made possible by way of vision and television and all of that stuff we're in the last days and i read that scripture there in uh matthew amen to to under so you can understand that it's gonna get so bad and that was for the jews but it's you know a lot of scripture have dual meanings and that scripture is for us too uh i i had you know people get frustrated when you're trying to help them because you know we've had so much stuff propaganda and everything and sometimes you don't know what to listen to listen to the heart if god is dealing with you understand that it's later than you think it really is later than you think i'm not saying quit school quit jobs plant your potatoes have faith in god but understand listen if it comes shorter than what you expected that's okay because heaven will make up for it you understand me i don't want you to get slack in nothing whatever you giving your heart to as far as uh uh work and school and all of these other things if you've got something in your mind you want to achieve i'm not saying give those things up but at the same time understand the season that you're living in and the position in the body of christ this is why the battles are so great here okay you love the lord thank you for your patience let's stand i'm so glad that the lord brought me out i'm so glad that the law brought me out [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
