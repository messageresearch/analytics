[25:40] god is good to us as we stand we'll go
[25:45] right into the word of the Lord to
[25:51] passage of Scripture would be coming
[25:54] from Acts the first chapter to read the
[26:03] eighth verse of that chapter and then
[26:07] we're going to read mark 16 acts when
[26:17] everybody says it can't be done God's
[26:19] Word says when everybody says impossible
[26:24] God says all things are possible we have
[26:29] the victory hallelujah not by might not
[26:34] by power but by his that God has given
[26:38] us the victory acts 1:8 says but you
[26:44] shall receive power after that the Holy
[26:47] Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be
[26:50] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[26:54] all Judea and in Samaria and unto the
[26:59] uttermost part of the earth one more
[27:03] scripture mark 16 please we're going
[27:07] right there with a portion of it they
[27:09] say it's not inspired I say if God can
[27:15] work miracles by the uninspired word
[27:18] what can he do with the inspired word
[27:20] mark 16 beginning at the 15th for us a
[27:28] fifteenth verse 16
[27:36] so yeah I'm in the wrong place sorry
[27:38] 16:15 and he said to them go ye into all
[27:43] the world and preach the gospel to every
[27:45] creature he that believeth and is
[27:48] baptized shall be saved but he that
[27:50] believeth not shall be damned
[27:53] these signs shall follow them that
[27:56] believe in my name shall they cast out
[27:58] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[28:01] they should take up serpents and if they
[28:04] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[28:06] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[28:09] and they shall recover have any father
[28:15] we thank you for the reading of your
[28:17] word we thank you for being so good to
[28:20] us
[28:21] Lord and without you we are nothing we
[28:25] know that we're living in a time of
[28:27] tests and trials and so we glorify you
[28:30] even in our tests and trials we glorify
[28:34] you and I in our strong times we glorify
[28:37] you in our weak times because we realize
[28:40] that even when we'll weak you are strong
[28:42] thank your father for being our strength
[28:45] Lord bless the service tonight in a
[28:49] special way in Jesus Christ's name we
[28:50] pray amen you may be seated
[28:54] seem like a man we appreciate the Lord
[29:08] for allowing us to be here tonight I was
[29:14] actually in my bed halfway sleep asleep
[29:18] when the word of the Lord began and God
[29:22] began to deal with me on possessing the
[29:26] authority of the word I think if we
[29:30] really realized basically God what God
[29:32] is saying to us possessing it it's not
[29:39] hoping
[29:40] to have it but it's something that you
[29:43] have in the kind of possession that God
[29:47] was I believe bring across to be in my
[29:51] mind was the kind of possession that you
[29:57] see among the sinners when sinners are
[30:00] being possessed by certain demons those
[30:05] who are possessed by what we call crack
[30:09] a crack demon is noticeable because the
[30:15] demon in itself began to impress itself
[30:18] through the flesh or fleshly body of
[30:21] that particular person is not difficult
[30:24] to identify a man who is an alcoholic
[30:32] because of the alcoholic demon it not
[30:36] only bears an impression on the human
[30:40] flesh or body but it also has a way of
[30:48] identifying itself and when it comes to
[30:53] possessing that kind of possessing I'm
[30:57] not talking about something that you
[30:59] hold in your hands but something that
[31:03] God holds in his hands so much so that
[31:08] God has complete control of you instead
[31:12] of being controlled by demons you're
[31:15] being controlled by God but when we
[31:20] think about it in the Old Testament you
[31:23] and I must understand that even in the
[31:26] Old Testament we saw by way of prophets
[31:31] sometime other people that God would use
[31:34] to to do something as I said you and I
[31:38] we are God's hand we're his physical
[31:42] body here he uses our hands he uses our
[31:46] eyes he uses our mind he he uses
[31:49] everything that we have or have offered
[31:53] him to you
[31:54] he'll use it when we think about
[31:57] somebody like David who was possessed of
[32:02] God David even in the Psalms tells us
[32:06] that he meditate both day and night on
[32:08] the Lord it was he was consumed by God
[32:11] if he wasn't singing he was praying and
[32:14] so therefore David had had a possession
[32:18] and it was that possession was the
[32:21] possession of God or God possessed him
[32:24] and therefore when God possessed you you
[32:28] actually have the authority of God
[32:30] living in you it's not you with the
[32:35] authority but it's God that's living in
[32:37] you that has the authority and then
[32:39] therefore you become John joint-heirs of
[32:42] that authority you take David as I said
[32:45] when he ran after the lion and the bear
[32:49] David had to be under the influence of
[32:52] something it was not David's own wheel
[32:56] it was not David's ego it was God
[33:00] because no man in his in his right mind
[33:04] would ever chase a bear or a lion many
[33:09] of us wouldn't even chase a big dog but
[33:12] under the inspiration of of God God
[33:17] possessing David - David himself had the
[33:23] authority he had the power that could
[33:26] conquer the lion and the bear yay though
[33:31] I walk through the valleys and shadows
[33:33] of death David said I feel no evil
[33:35] because thou art with me when we talk
[33:39] about having authority we're talking
[33:42] about not only we talk about a legal
[33:43] person somebody who's legally in power
[33:46] to make or to enforce some kind of law
[33:49] we talk about it in this in in in in in
[33:53] in the function of government a
[33:56] policeman or Sheriff we understand by
[34:01] God's grace that you know some of them
[34:03] physically are not so much threatening
[34:05] but it's the uniform that they
[34:07] where is the thing the car they drive
[34:10] it's it's the outward appearance of what
[34:13] what what what they represents that we
[34:17] fear because we realize it's just not
[34:19] one person behind the badge it's a whole
[34:22] army of people that that stands with him
[34:25] and that authority is not just a single
[34:28] man Authority yet he you and he uses
[34:31] that authority as though the government
[34:34] is on the side because he realized the
[34:36] government is on the side and once we
[34:39] come to see that the authority in which
[34:42] God has given to us is not just a one
[34:45] man Authority it is Authority that even
[34:49] heaven has to recognize even demons have
[34:53] to recognize that that the authority of
[34:55] it in you is that right because the
[34:57] Bible says that at the name of Jesus
[35:00] every knee shall bow and every tongue
[35:03] shall confess that that Jesus not you
[35:07] but Jesus is Lord to the glory of the
[35:12] Father see it is God in you that the
[35:16] demons recognize not only three demons
[35:19] but all heaven must recognize Jesus in
[35:24] you hallelujah and understand when you
[35:28] have Jesus in you you have the word
[35:30] because the Bible said in the beginning
[35:33] was the word the Word was made flesh and
[35:35] that same were right became flesh right
[35:41] in the beginning was the word in the
[35:42] Word was with God that word became flesh
[35:47] hallelujah
[35:48] that was in the body of Jesus but now
[35:52] the flesh has become word in this hour
[35:56] the same Jesus Hebrews 13 today says
[36:00] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[36:02] forever he is a God that cannot change
[36:05] hey man he is God and everything that we
[36:10] see see taste feel smell even things
[36:17] we can even pick up with our natural
[36:19] senses belong to him and he is the akka
[36:24] of it all
[36:27] he is the only potentate y'all know what
[36:29] I'm saying he is the only authority the
[36:34] Bible says neither is there salvation in
[36:36] any other but there is no other name
[36:39] given among men whereby we must be saved
[36:42] and that that name oh nice it's got
[36:49] about so what would you what are you
[36:51] going with brother I'm trying to say
[36:54] that the same Jesus that conquered
[36:58] Legion the same Jesus that turned water
[37:01] into wine the same Jesus that raised
[37:05] Lazarus from the dead the same cheeses
[37:09] that opened up the eyes of the blind he
[37:12] still lives and where does he live he
[37:16] lives in you and me is that right but
[37:21] what we need to do is that that Jesus
[37:24] possess us let him control us is that
[37:28] right Paul says I'm a prisoner of Christ
[37:32] hallelujah in other words I cannot do
[37:35] what I want to do I can't go where I
[37:38] want to go I have no freedom and guess
[37:41] what I won't no freedom let my liver to
[37:45] be in him because he whom the Sun is set
[37:48] free is free indeed hallelujah and where
[37:52] the Spirit of the Lord is there is
[37:54] Liberty think about it sometimes we get
[37:59] off course but one thing for certain
[38:02] those whom God has chosen to be bride
[38:05] for this day there is no way you can get
[38:07] around being what God wants you to be
[38:10] not only was you predestined a brother
[38:13] and says predestinated is not such of a
[38:15] good word but because of God for
[38:18] knowledge hallelujah for knowledge look
[38:22] back to election and I think election
[38:24] looks back to destiny how every works it
[38:28] was because God saw
[38:30] you knew you understood you chose you
[38:33] birth you
[38:37] it can't be born again until God gives
[38:41] you birth it's not him who will it know
[38:45] he that run it is God who showed mercy
[38:48] God gives you birth think about it
[38:53] Samson got off of course but you see he
[38:55] still had a word
[39:00] was chosen to destroy the Philistines
[39:03] and God allowed Samson I love it
[39:09] to fail he had a season of failure but
[39:17] he still was chosen by God to conquer
[39:20] the Philistines Peter had a season of
[39:25] failure but he still was the man who was
[39:30] to preach and open up the New Testament
[39:33] move of God on the day of Pentecost
[39:36] y'all hear what I'm saying I'm saying
[39:38] throughout the Bible you see failures
[39:41] and failures and failures but you see
[39:43] you must understand God has an appointed
[39:46] time and often time we get ahead of God
[39:50] right Moses Moses got a here to God
[39:54] hallelujah but as I brother said he
[39:57] meant at times his season God waited to
[40:00] bring it back around again see that's
[40:02] why I like the song there's no turning
[40:05] back there is no giving up hallelujah
[40:07] all I know is that when I fall he helps
[40:11] me up all I gotta do is wait till my
[40:16] change comes in the change will come but
[40:22] the random preach the message about
[40:23] possessing the gates of your enemy and
[40:26] you and I know that the reason why we
[40:29] can possess the gates of our enemy we
[40:31] can come with such an authority that the
[40:34] gates must fall or the gates must open
[40:37] why because we're not speaking by our
[40:39] own voice we're speaking the voice of
[40:42] God that has been given to us to speak
[40:45] is that right because all we're doing
[40:48] now is just echoing what's already been
[40:52] preached echoing what has already been
[40:55] sounded we just resounded it and however
[40:59] it sounded in the beginning the
[41:01] resounding is just as powerful as the
[41:05] sounding
[41:09] maintaining control and that's what we
[41:11] must learn how not just to bring in
[41:13] ourselves into a controlling of God but
[41:16] maintaining it I believe brother Branham
[41:19] said it like this
[41:20] he said getting me high in the veil and
[41:22] staying shutting the curtain don't come
[41:27] out
[41:27] stay behind me whether Shekinah glory
[41:30] can completely possess and control you
[41:34] hallelujah and the scripture you and I
[41:39] must realize a man that this scripture
[41:41] March 16 wasn't just given to Paul and
[41:44] Peter and John it was given to the whole
[41:47] body of Christ that word was to last
[41:50] until Jesus come right from Aegeus he
[41:54] said I'll never leave you nor will I
[41:57] forsake you you know I thought for a
[41:59] long time that when Jesus spoke that you
[42:01] know he was just speaking you know Oh
[42:03] like I was gonna feel him but his word
[42:05] is his word that will never leave you
[42:08] it's his word that will never forsake
[42:11] you hallelujah
[42:13] even when you're in trouble your word
[42:16] his word will never forsake you he even
[42:19] when you sin his word will never forsake
[42:22] you when you come short in life his word
[42:25] will never forsake you hallelujah
[42:30] David described him a friend above our
[42:32] friends hallelujah glory to God what are
[42:38] you saying that authority possessing you
[42:41] know letting it possess you hallelujah
[42:44] United States the truth Isis I've seen
[42:48] people like that you know you got the
[42:50] policeman and then you got the policeman
[42:53] you ever seen a policeman that seemed to
[42:56] be the opposite which oh man he he
[43:00] overdo it you know he know but he
[43:02] doesn't it is absolutely that's the way
[43:05] it should be
[43:06] the policeman supposed to be a policeman
[43:08] it is supposed to possess him he
[43:14] is supposed to become what the word says
[43:17] he is or what the law says he's supposed
[43:19] to be think about it if we could just
[43:26] allow the del our God to possess us like
[43:30] we allow these strange spirits at times
[43:33] to possess us we'll be ok hmm it's
[43:38] amazing how I'm just just saying it it's
[43:41] amazing how a lot spirit can make you do
[43:44] anything
[43:45] and then God has a hard time getting us
[43:49] to do what he wants us to do teeth but
[43:53] God wants us if we have a channel to
[43:56] open ourselves to unless we ought to
[43:58] have our channel open for Christ for the
[44:01] Holy Ghost to deny it to shut the door
[44:06] hallelujah John says a man can receive
[44:14] nothing except it be given him from
[44:17] heaven John 327 so it ain't something
[44:21] you can just say oh I'm gonna get it but
[44:24] you know we know who can give it
[44:26] he said we have not because we ask not
[44:29] if you ask of good things from God he
[44:32] will not give you bad things is that
[44:34] right he said if you ask for bread he
[44:36] will not give you a surprise hallelujah
[44:40] and so therefore you and I must
[44:42] understand when good things come we
[44:45] should treasure them when God gives you
[44:47] visually anything you should treasure
[44:49] that hallelujah because you did not do
[44:52] it it was a Christ in you it was a
[44:55] possession of the Holy Ghost here we in
[45:02] recognizing he says now we are fully
[45:05] acquainted we people who search the
[45:08] Scriptures day and night and read our
[45:10] papers and hear the news commentators
[45:13] that this world is now standing in the
[45:16] grip of two great spiritual forces and
[45:19] they are both religious forces I believe
[45:22] that these great forces are soon coming
[45:24] to a head and both of these great forces
[45:27] was represented in these two sons of
[45:30] Isaac how that God in His infinite
[45:33] wisdom had for shouted all things to us
[45:36] that we might buy these things know of
[45:39] certain what leads before us y'all hear
[45:43] me two forces you're gonna either here
[45:47] to one or the other
[45:49] Christ or Antichrist hallelujah me it's
[45:54] so plain made it so plain that God in
[45:57] His Word and the nature and his universe
[46:00] is so perfectly a race together that
[46:02] even the sinner can see something's
[46:05] fixing to take place God has so arranged
[46:09] it no one will be without an excuse
[46:14] hallelujah
[46:15] none of us will be without it all God I
[46:18] didn't know here he says even the sinner
[46:20] knows everybody feels the tension right
[46:25] now everybody feel a little nervous out
[46:27] there because they know something is
[46:29] about to happen but they don't know what

[54:09] everlasting contempt and they that be
[54:12] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[54:14] the firmament for the answer that's the
[54:16] rapture and that's what to fall because
[54:19] so will awake

[54:23] hallelujah
[54:24] we'll catch him up there's another
[54:26] awakening hallelujah and that is the
[54:30] white throne judgment hallelujah there
[54:32] is a second resurrection but you better
[54:35] make sure you make that first one
[54:37] hallelujah hey man is that right what is
[54:41] it people who are possessed if you ever
[54:45] want to be possessed by a spirit
[54:46] you oughta want to be possessed by the
[54:48] Holy Spirit hallelujah
[54:50] because when the Holy Spirit live in you
[54:52] he will live holy
[54:53] oh but all Daniel shut up the words seal
[54:58] the book even to the time of the end
[55:00] hallelujah Daniel had a book to seal up
[55:04] hallelujah because you got to understand
[55:06] that when the Word of God was open in
[55:09] this day
[55:09] it not only released those who would
[55:11] make a rapture but he also released
[55:13] those that would come up at the second
[55:15] age second time hallelujah
[55:19] ain't God good to us ha because there is
[55:23] history
[55:25] it is the air
[55:28] it is the end and all these things
[55:34] overlaps each other until they come to a
[55:37] maturity until they come into a head is
[55:39] that right o people why the seven seals
[55:43] are not open hello is open but you said
[55:47] why worry what do you mean listen it
[55:48] opened long enough to tell you there
[55:51] were silence hallelujah is that right
[55:55] had it not open you would not have known
[55:58] but it was open that you might know that
[56:01] the seventh was open but there was
[56:03] silence and weathermen said he's here
[56:05] basically that's working with the
[56:06] rapture that's what he said
[56:08] no man know the day nor the hour we know
[56:11] the season hallelujah and we know the
[56:14] word that telling us he's coming so we
[56:18] what we make ourselves ready hmm how do
[56:22] you know how do you make yourself ready
[56:24] by taking the word and let that word
[56:26] possess you hallelujah meditate on it
[56:30] hallelujah meditate on it think on these
[56:34] things whatsoever is lovely
[56:37] whatsoever is pure whatsoever is honest
[56:39] what's whoever's of a good report feed
[56:41] on these things hallelujah and so you
[56:45] know I was realizing that every time the
[56:47] negativity stuff comes to your mind that
[56:50] is not of God because the Bible said
[56:53] love thinketh no evil hallelujah
[56:57] negative stuff will bring you down in
[57:00] your spirit and you find out all of a
[57:04] sudden that Holy Spirit is being
[57:05] oppressed I'll press down and now you
[57:07] got a prayer a depression spirit working
[57:10] with you doesn't mean you don't have the
[57:12] Holy Ghost but you didn't allow the Holy
[57:14] Ghost to possess you know huh it's like
[57:18] you're allowing this depression and
[57:20] there is no depression in heaven so
[57:22] where is the spirit coming from straight
[57:25] out of hell hmm many things
[57:32] that way God is desiring for certain
[57:34] people to see and others cannot see oh I
[57:38] love that when God in his eminent wisdom
[57:41] has predestinated or for Dane for
[57:44] certain things to happen it could happen
[57:46] to to the person sitting right next to
[57:49] you and you will know nothing about it
[57:52] look at Dalton when elijah was down at
[57:55] Dalton and they all and they were all
[57:59] surrounded there by the aliens that come
[58:02] in the Syrian army looking for Elisha
[58:05] the prophet for when they began to find
[58:07] out every time the Syrians would come
[58:09] over to Israel to make war why the
[58:12] Israel area life would be laying in
[58:15] ambush for them what was it God was
[58:18] telling the Israelites something by way
[58:20] of a prophet hallelujah a million and
[58:25] when Elijah went diamonds his Lord Amen
[58:28] you know and smoke them blind he was
[58:31] leading them all around and they never
[58:33] knew it was he like that's how it is now
[58:37] God comes in the church he preaches a
[58:40] message and people that don't only
[58:41] recognize a God some do and some don't
[58:45] setting right next to each other and
[58:47] don't see God and the other man to see
[58:50] God and this one won't see God and this
[58:52] is God hallelujah and this one goes out
[58:54] and said what is it same message same
[58:58] word for some can see sometimes things
[59:02] that others cannot see it happens
[59:04] heating everywhere of I ever go help us
[59:08] Jesus other bodies a search the
[59:11] scripture for in them you think you have
[59:14] eternal life
[59:14] and they are they which testify of me
[59:17] don't you know if the devil can get you
[59:19] oppressed if he can get to you depressed
[59:21] or he knows he's working he's got an
[59:24] atmosphere to create an illusion in you
[59:29] he can make you think God don't love you
[59:32] God don't care cuz he's gonna saying
[59:34] that blues to you he'll there but when
[59:38] you're setting in heavenly places you
[59:41] realize that the joy of the Lord is
[59:43] Mustang
[59:44] in God dwells in his praises in the
[59:52] praise of his people hallelujah
[59:54] and see that's what the devil he try to
[59:55] keep you from praising God because he
[59:57] realized once you stop praising him
[59:59] you're moving right on out of that
[1:00:01] presence and now he can slip his tricky
[1:00:04] hmm how you gonna cast out Devils and
[1:00:08] you're not even happy you know you have
[1:00:10] no authority you've losing you know you
[1:00:12] stripped your uniform off per say you
[1:00:15] understand what I'm saying Amen but if
[1:00:17] you keep that uniform on hallelujah if
[1:00:20] you allow the Holy Spirit to possess
[1:00:23] every fiber of your being like brother
[1:00:27] bear don't say people can't understand
[1:00:28] it why some can just stay happy all the
[1:00:31] time it's because of where their
[1:00:33] dwelling huh some are dwelling in there
[1:00:38] any in the Holies of Holies and some are
[1:00:40] in and out of the Holies of Holies and
[1:00:42] then some are out in the court and some
[1:00:44] out here you know it depends on where
[1:00:45] your dwelling that's just where your joy
[1:00:47] is cause of that press to order mark of
[1:00:52] the high calling which is in Christ
[1:00:54] Jesus but the hour cometh and now is
[1:00:57] when the true worshipers shall worship
[1:01:00] the father in what spirit and in truth
[1:01:03] you can't worship God in spirit and not
[1:01:06] truth as truth and not spirit he must
[1:01:09] worship in spirit and in truth for the
[1:01:12] father what he's looking for it seek it
[1:01:16] knows that means he continue to look for
[1:01:18] those kind that's gonna worship Him when
[1:01:21] they're high worshiping when he's low
[1:01:23] worship when you're by yourself
[1:01:26] worship Him amen in a crowd no matter
[1:01:29] where you are he gonna worship God God
[1:01:36] is a spirit and they that worship Him
[1:01:40] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:01:46] y'all think I tell you what folks I go
[1:01:49] through battles all the time I really do
[1:01:51] but you know who picks me up he does
[1:01:55] hallelujah you know and it's the truth
[1:01:57] if I find myself getting a little little
[1:01:59] you know too much in the wrong spirit
[1:02:01] sometime I call people just to talk cuz
[1:02:04] I know somewhere they gonna give me a
[1:02:05] word of encouragement hallelujah we feed
[1:02:09] each other's people we strengthen one
[1:02:12] another we are we and we are at army we
[1:02:15] are a body so you don't allow yourself
[1:02:19] to be isolated that's the trick of the
[1:02:23] enemy I'm almost done second Corinthians
[1:02:27] three 13 through 18 says and not as
[1:02:29] Moses would put a veil over his face
[1:02:32] that the children of Israel could not
[1:02:34] stedfastly look to the end of that which
[1:02:37] is abolished but their minds were
[1:02:40] blinded until this day remain that the
[1:02:44] same they are untaken away in the
[1:02:46] reading of the Old Testament which Vail
[1:02:48] has done away in Christ but even unto
[1:02:51] this day when Moses is read the Vail is
[1:02:53] upon their heart nevertheless when it
[1:02:56] shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be
[1:02:58] taken away now the Lord is that spirit
[1:03:01] and where the Spirit of the Lord is
[1:03:03] there is Liberty and we are with open
[1:03:07] face beholding as a glass the glory of
[1:03:10] the Lord are changed into the same image
[1:03:15] from glory to glory even as by the
[1:03:18] Spirit hallelujah
[1:03:22] are you saying brother Brooks I'm just
[1:03:25] saying you know when people people
[1:03:28] people until you know people is there
[1:03:30] some people who are resting on on
[1:03:31] brother branham y'all y'all get me wrong
[1:03:33] I respect the Prophet I love the Prophet
[1:03:35] I thank God for the Prophet but you
[1:03:37] cannot hold him in a place he's not
[1:03:39] supposed to be and see what happened let
[1:03:42] me tell you let me say like this when
[1:03:44] the children of Israel were Moses when
[1:03:46] they were in the wilderness what did
[1:03:50] they do they erected up a system and
[1:03:53] they they brought a goal they made a
[1:03:54] golden calf and everything else and that
[1:03:57] golden calf what was it it was the
[1:03:59] spirit of
[1:04:00] Daltry it was the spirit of fornication
[1:04:03] it was the spirit of Farley it was the
[1:04:06] spirit of partying hello
[1:04:09] and how many honest with you I see that
[1:04:12] all over the message I see the spirit of
[1:04:15] partying the spirit of fornication and
[1:04:19] adultery I see all of that and you know
[1:04:23] why because they have made them a sister
[1:04:25] but you got to understand that every
[1:04:27] system you know bril don't call it
[1:04:29] broken sister yes a sister and system
[1:04:33] insane difference
[1:04:34] yeah it's something that's controlled
[1:04:36] right but when they come back to Jesus
[1:04:39] Christ when they come back to the Holy
[1:04:42] Ghost then they're fine the liberty
[1:04:44] they've been looking for
[1:04:45] they find a power they've been looking
[1:04:48] for hallelujah
[1:04:50] they're seen by God's grace amen they've
[1:04:53] been veiled all this time the veil must
[1:04:57] be lifted every believer must come back
[1:05:00] to the Lord Christ when they come back
[1:05:04] to the Lord then they'll see Amen that
[1:05:06] they are really free they'll not have
[1:05:08] the strength that did what happened that
[1:05:11] they would have until they come back to
[1:05:12] Christ
[1:05:15] it happened in Israel it happened with
[1:05:18] them and it has happened in this message
[1:05:20] I'm telling you and I don't care if the
[1:05:21] people say Brotherhood you're not you're
[1:05:23] not preaching it like I don't care what
[1:05:25] folks says I know who I am I know where
[1:05:27] I come from and I know where I'm going
[1:05:29] and my thing is I see the spirit of that
[1:05:32] Antichrist
[1:05:33] that's literally blinding the people and
[1:05:35] making them think that they're right
[1:05:37] when their own because they have become
[1:05:39] like the Pharisees we are the ultimate
[1:05:43] of the message of the word then God
[1:05:47] takes somebody like an adulterous woman
[1:05:51] a woman at the whale huh
[1:05:55] somebody no bagger to them raised him up
[1:05:59] in a position why they still
[1:06:03] can how can he have anything to do with
[1:06:05] these publicans and sinners and Jesus
[1:06:07] said yes but these public concerns and
[1:06:10] sinners will enter in way far faster way
[1:06:14] before you do they wanted to stone him
[1:06:17] not Estonia but he told him the truth
[1:06:23] what we don't understand it this best it
[1:06:25] ain't no system it shouldn't be what
[1:06:28] happens on the inside of this church
[1:06:29] ain't nobody else's business
[1:06:31] hello I'm not connected to nobody but
[1:06:35] Christ yeah I'm in charge its sovereign
[1:06:38] time himself and the truth of the matter
[1:06:41] is it's all right to have somebody for
[1:06:44] accountability but the truth of the
[1:06:47] matter is we are joined to Christ Christ
[1:06:50] only and what everybody else is doing
[1:06:53] does not dictate to us of what we should
[1:06:56] be doing ah because we should be being
[1:07:00] led by the Holy Spirit
[1:07:04] hmm is that right today the Church of
[1:07:08] the Living God has the privilege of
[1:07:10] standing and seeing the conquering
[1:07:12] resurrected Jesus Christ the Son of the
[1:07:15] Living God standing present living in
[1:07:18] his church doing the same thing he did
[1:07:22] then then we we possess the gates of the
[1:07:27] enemy i'ma turn to a scripture a brother
