TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and Jesus Christ himself had to pray hallelujah God in flesh but he still had to go to Calvary he still had to go to - to - to the Mount of Olives he still had to go to the Garden of Gethsemane he had to go there even though he was a son of God God in flesh we're no exemption we sing that song wherever he leaves me I'll follow the very word redeemed means to bring back is that right redeem is something to redeem anything is to bring back to its original place that's what I'm talking about if you are redeemed what are you afraid about yeah when God redeems you that means it is up to him to bring you back to your original place those old saints of God they may not have had what we call the depths of the word but they knew the power and understood the resurrection of Jesus Christ they knew what Jesus did they knew Redemption was there they knew deliverance was there they knew everything they needed to take another world was in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah is that right it's true they didn't know the opening of the word they knew nothing about the seals they knew nothing about the seven thunders hallelujah they knew nothing about that but they knew him they knew the Jesus Christ hallelujah now let me say it like this all the Prophet did was restored through his ministry the Lord Jesus Christ that the people in the book of Acts knew about he did not bring another Jesus he brought the same Jesus the same word that Paul preached you understand what I'm saying it is this Lord this Jesus that brings us into a rapture it is his seed that was planted in us hallelujah his seed come on somebody you got to realize that John the Baptist his seed though it be called by God it was not the same seed if I could say it like that that was planted in Jesus John was born by the set by as daddy Zachariah Jesus was born by his daddy God somebody help me here so you got to understand you could be born like Eli you could be born like John the Baptist but you still got to be born of the Holy Ghost but in Jesus Christ like I said this morning he was the miracles today he was Claude in flesh he was the Elohim you said Oh what do you say I'm saying it was that's why you know the proper creature message who is this my cancer that because the same encounter deck that was in Jesus Christ was now in him it wasn't the Prophet he was the housing he was the 16 elements somebody help me because my candidate came in the time of sodom and gomorrha jumped into that 16 elements and went back to where he came from hallelujah in this last day he jumped into the William ramen jumped back out but it wasn't the man who was Makassar dick it was God in him and he was only doing the work of the cathodic because he prophesied it would be so it help us Jesus you and I were just the housing of God you can't say oh I'm God oh I'm Ellingham the only way you can say that is that that God is in you or Emma Hill is in you it's not you it's caught in you Christ in you the hope of glory whoo listen first Corinthians 15 is the fiftieth versus now this I say brethren the flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption so let me say like this let me break it down when a corn is planted that corn does not have to go to the grocery store to buy anything it doesn't have to go to any man-made system to clothe itself everything that corn needs is in the seed yeah Young's doing them saying let me say it like this we find ourselves trying to add Christ you cannot add Christ Christ adds to you you must understand that everything in the seed as it matures and develops in you it becomes more like the image not your flesh flesh and blood cannot even enter into the kingdom of God it's Christ in you every little listen they say when a baby is born I don't know how it is they said but when a baby is born he or she cannot see clearly it is a few days as they began to adjust to the light then they began to see because when they're born they can only see the shadow hallelujah I don't know how they know that but that's what they say and the point is amen as they grow the shadow became comes clearer and clearer and clearer to live eventually they see who mama is and daddy is hallelujah but think about this that child cannot even see the image of Mama and Daddy in them until they mature somebody else may be able to see it all you look just like mama but they cannot see that until they mature so easy with a believer sometimes we cannot see image hallelujah somebody else can see more Jesus in you than you can but there come a time in your life when you began to see Jesus in you you'll begin to see the image of God shaped and form into you hallelujah and it's at that time you begin to act and carry on just like your daddy hallelujah is that true it's true when you first get saved and then you've got to turn your head and turn your head and turn your head because of the different lust but as the the veil of God began to grow and grow and grow and grow that means the LasVegas to diminish diminish diminish after why the lust veil is gone and all you see is the veil of God you're seeing through his eyes he's seeing through your eyes you see what he sees and he sees what you see and it's all holy holy holy unto the Lord hallelujah I'm so grateful for God I'm so grateful I don't have to do it I'm so great grateful that the seed in me is the one that's working in me hallelujah is that right the Bible said if that seed being you you cannot sin if there's in you you catch it come on he didn't say you can't make mistakes he said you can't said that sin means you can't disbelieve it I believe it Lord I may not be able to perform everything but I believe everything hallelujah nothing can harm you nothing can stop you huh is that right God don't ever have spiritual abortions hey come on God don't ever have premature children that was days gone by hallelujah but now God calls for perfection hmm I'll show you a mystery this is what I love about it we thought so many times in our lives Oh when I get over there and get that crown it's gonna be more than just a crown like this you know what we've been crowned with we're crown with his life we're crown with his glory we're being crowned with his glory thought but history often the word body is your crown the theophany that God gives you is crowned by glory is that right the Bride of Christ is now coming down with the glory of God that's your crown eternal life is your crown come on somebody what can penetrate eternal life nothing what can stop eternal life nothing in order for you to live eternally God must crown you with himself because there is no other eternal crown except for God Himself I love it I love it because even in nature the Bible tells us that when wheat itself it's green you know when wheat is green is not beautiful to me when I see fields of green out there with wheat it's almost sickening but as it grows and mature not only does it change from green into that beautiful golden look it begins to bow right only the tears stand like okay I got it yeah all under control oh but the wheat hummus' itself and wait for the harvest time whoo Jesus buddy you said what do you mean the closer you get to God the closer you become to this rapture the more humble you become mm I ain't gonna be long crown with this glory that's what Jesus said in the seventeenth chapter of Matthew Lord I would the day the glory that we had with you that you beget you give that to them give them their glory the same glory you gave to me give it to him Oh what glory the glory of God was so great on Jesus that married the tumor of Jesus couldn't even recognize him thought he was a gardener hallelujah when he walked on the road to Emmaus they didn't recognize him hallelujah because the glory of God was all over in somebody helped me here they didn't recognize him hallelujah think about it when the glory of God comes amen you think by God's grace and I thank God that in that day won't be no lust it won't be anything of the flesh everything would be beautiful hallelujah no sack stop nothing none of that nasty stuff everything will be hold on talk about a change the devil didn't know it but when Jesus dropped his head and said it's finished the devil didn't understand the devil thought oh I got him now hallelujah he descended down into the lower region of hell he began to preach to the dr-dos in the in the days of knowing and the ant alluvion day and asked him why did not you receive Noah's message you understand me see because what they did not understand that was not Noah preaching that was God in Noah hello and God tied himself into the profit hallelujah you understand what I'm saying but that wasn't God who after the flood drank and got drunk that was a land but when he was preaching that was God somebody help me here listen when we make mistakes that's man but when we're in the will of God that's God hallelujah yeah he goes down and he preached to the day those chosen in in Hell by God's grace amen and everybody that believed know as a message was ratchet you don't know that everybody that was in the grave that believed Noah's message when Jesus got up they got up - hallelujah come on somebody but you see what it was it was Christ in Noah and you said what do you mean brother rooks now you know Noah's sons knew that was not daddy talking to them to build an ark somewhere the revelation struck them this is God I know this man has my daddy's face but that's God who's now using him and I'm gonna follow through with it y'all understand me hallelujah because you know what even though himself had to get on the ark huh he's all I have to say it brothers I don't need the Holy Ghost even William Branham had to get the Holy Ghost and if he has to get the Holy Ghost you got to get it mm when the changes come is that right Paul had to get the Holy Ghost and everybody that Paul preached had to get the Holy Ghost all right when they met John's disciples they said who baptism was you baptized under where we believe that better John baptism and he baptized unto repentance is there but that ain't good enough you've got to be rebaptised you've got to know the name of Jesus Christ because that's his way the power is is in the name of the Lord Jesus that is the only place where sins can be remitted somebody helped me here y'all know we're gonna get a new name everybody that sticks with Christ right now there's a new name coming you and I don't know what it is but when it comes it's gonna be glorious hallelujah all glory to God and I'm gonna tell you like this amen there is another group of people that God was saying hello and you said what do you mean there's another group of people there's a hundred and forty-four thousand who God will save before destroying the world is that right we call them Jews because they are but the real Jews guess what they've got to have the Holy Ghost in one day the Bible said there be bored again whoa you're surely if God could give it 144,000 he can give it to me somebody help me here so you and I must realize that in the midst of all this God got his eyes on Naomi and Ruth somebody help me here because cow redeemed us both hallelujah we'll help me Jesus so if kalbarri redeemed us in order for God to prove that you have been redeemed he must seal you with the Holy Ghost that is your proof that's why Paul said make your calling and election sure that's how you make it sure when God seals you with the Holy Ghost you are sure mmm hey man that's right there's another group like the Bible said and these are in the bride taken from among the Gentiles that group they are before his throne day and night they serve him in the temple they are the special care of the Lord they are his bride what are you saying brother grunts ah I said like this when God has called you to be bride you ought to act like your bride love him like your bride even that woman is Simon's house didn't even know who she was at the time but she carried on with him like she was his bride she got down and she washed his feet amen kiss his feet rubbed his oh my it was an awesome time and don't you tell me Jesus didn't enjoy it yes he did I talking about in some filthy way but surely he had feelings in his feet y'all better hear me it was a conflict a moment for him because he was rejected nobody washed his feet nobody ignored his head and here is this woman who's a ill-fame person comes riding in says I appreciate you Lord there's only one thing I desire for you I want to be saved hallelujah what is it she was anointed she was predestinated and nobody else could have fit that place but her under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and she didn't even know about it now she's in the history of God hallelujah I'm gonna tell you something he's these little things that you do for the bride of Jesus Christ you don't even know that God is writing those things down we think there's got to be something grand and God takes those a little moment he said the least of these the least of these what you do to the least of these you've done it unto me and God comes along and write all of these things down that you have done you don't even know you do something is inspiring to do it not even realizing it's God that got you doing it so that he can reward you at the end God wants everybody to get rewards hallelujah there's that all right he said I write upon him the name of my God in the name of the city of my god and what is the name of my god well he was God with us Emmanuel but that was not his given name thou shalt call his name Jesus yeah so right now the bride of Jesus Christ is carrying upon her forehead the name of Jesus Christ oh I felt like running just now something happened just now what because you gotta realize we can't have that it's the name of Jesus Christ we love we can't help in this in our fall hand is it our being is who we are is our DNA do you now should call his name Jesus hey jesus said I came into my father's name and you see me not therefore the name of God is Jesus but that is the name he came in he is Lord Jesus Christ and what name does a woman take when she married the man she takes his name it would be his name that is given unto the bride when he takes her to himself you mean to tell me you say your bride of Jesus Christ and you can't stand the name of Jesus that's the name of my husband that's the name of my Savior that's what the Bible said your Redeemer your husband hallelujah whoo revelation 21 one through four says and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven in the first earth with passed away and there was more snow see and I saw John the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband hallelujah and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men boom the tabernacle of God is with me hallelujah and he would dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the father former things are passed away let me polish it because this is the way the Holy Spirit is moving me what we must understand is that this world is just the beginning God has Wells on top of worlds Suns and moons and stars hallelujah but it was God's design his way to do what he did so that his seed his children were no good from evil hallelujah so you're not so you'll know they'll never come another Lucifer in the new world then I don't care Iran's out the eons they'll never come another Lucifer there'll never be another devil there'll never be no more death no more pain anything that was connected as well everything that's why the Bible says heaven and earth everything would be on fire all the demons were burned everything will go back to his purity God just brought us here as a training station that's it that's all it's about this is child training that when we get over we come to a maturity we come to the place that Lucifer fell from man does not live by bread alone but by every word proceeds out of the mouth of God I will write a new name upon him and my new name when all becomes new then will I take upon him a new name and that name will be the name of the bride also well when everything becomes new he don't even tell us the name one day he might he may but it won't be something that you can broadcast it'll never be something you saw I know the new name it'll never be anything like that it'll be something like the prophet of God say you have to take to your grave with you see that's what I understand people don't understand brother Branham didn't tell us everything there's a lot of things he took to his grave you and I wouldn't have understood it anyway Oh somebody help me here you know what and what we fail to see that's why God said here wipe away all the tears from our eyes because when we have born into this world we think we all came from the same place we did not come from the same place there's an upper world and there's an underworld Lucifer of all can I say it like this and then everybody that comes from the underworld was with Lucifer in his revolting demonic powers they fallen angels they rebelled against God and therefore we see the influence of these fallen angels the reflection of these fallen angels you saw all Beyonce Beyonce is a fallen angel what are they doing ministering to the world and what do they minister they minister the death sentence is all about sex why can't people see that's where the fall came because their ministers our ministry everything that seduces everything that that that Lucifer said would happen she's worship as a God somebody help me here and the whole time they're ministering the very act that Lucifer minister to Eve and they bring it across the television channels and stations like it is the way of life when it's really the way of death hmm y'all better hear me that's why we have to be careful and everything we do everything must be pure the preaching the music the singing everything I didn't give a person get up here and sing and it sounds wonderful to the year but if they get up here singing and their own ability it's not of God it must be the anointing of God God must be glorified in everything y'all hear what I'm saying listen revealing of the son of man can only would could only come in the days of Sodom but what what was he coming to do Sodom had already been judged Abraham says Lord if you'd be fine knew fine fine and before God would destroy it had to be less than ten and it was so hallelujah it dropped all the way down to three y'all hear what I'm sayin so as it wasn't that they were you said well ain't nobody gonna say is it possible here is God ministering through you and me this message the world is about to ear they think you're crazy why because science has told them that they can get in a flying saucer and run to another world when the Bible tells us that all heaven the heavens will be on fire how you gonna escape the judgment of God you can run to the mountain education came haja nothing can hide from the wrath of God revealing in the human flesh what was it so that you can you and I they let to see could see that this man that came in this last day was not just a man but God used him in meketa they come right in there is that right because the candidate was the one who's sitting there in the time of Abraham and said why did Sarah laugh let's put it this way if you don't want to say like that let's say it like Elohim did it what's the difference right Ella him stepped in 16 elements walked in the cool of the evening Abraham saw three and said it was one lapse all three and said it was three Lords right but a prophet can see what are you saying it o if people could see even being a prophet was a gift he didn't make himself that he was born that can i is that right listen or old medium and people don't like me to say this old medium saw brother branham on a bus and he told the medium said to brother branham you know you pretty much special she basically told him say you know what you were born on the actual day that Jesus was born a witch told brother Brennan that he was born on Jesus birthday and see y'all don't want to have Christmas in April do you what my point is he didn't make no deal about it he didn't go stolen my fight you hardly ever hear him saying anything about it hallelujah and even though he was born on that day I'm sure there's a many people who was born on that day but something happened that to him that nobody else got a pillar fire came through the window hallelujah humming over the baby mama and daddy didn't even know what was going on but the God of heaven knew what was going on and that day was a day of omoro memorial that God was getting ready to end the time of man howdy God is getting ready to destroy this world and bring us into a new hour you talk about a new age hallelujah we're living in a new age hallelujah this thing is absolutely priceless everybody thought oh God have mercy what Michelangelo did amen when Moses was a masterpiece but this is the greatest masterpiece ever God took his own son hallelujah beat him so totally didn't even look human whipped him and striped him and everything else why because he was dying for you and me it was our sins our transgressions so how can you go to hell when God has already paid the price all you've got to do is accept what he's done believe what he's done and count on him to do what he said he will do and he said he that begun a good work in you its faithful to complete it I love that scripture because when I don't feel safe I know I still AM Holly when I don't feel holy brother I know I'm holy what I don't feel strength of heart I know I'm sanctified Wow because he gave me his sanctification I traded him my fealty rolled and he gave me a robe of righteousness hallelujah whoo Jesus or the God it ain't about what you feel is what he has already declared glory to God God don't never change I'm so glad that when God told Peter say you're gonna be the Sportsman's on the day of Pentecost seemed like Peter would have walked a straight line but God also told Peter you're gonna die now me three times and God didn't say to Peter well you know you messed up three times boy I gotta give this thing to somebody else but in the mind of God nobody could preach like Peter Peter preached on the day of Pentecost three thousand souls will say I'd love to see that rolling in three thousand we think about it ooh but that same Jesus did a greater thing he came in a little Kentuckian preached out there in Africa India and everything else he meant some was thirty thousand some was more than that hallelujah one shot one sermon with all kinds of interpretation but when the Holy Ghost is in it nothing can stop it hallelujah it doesn't matter where the seeds are the Holy Ghost will find them who the bride knows where she's standing and that's what predestination brings you to a place where you know where you stand in mmm-hmm you say oh okay now you know I don't dial three times I've been shipwrecked you doubt him beat me up you don't stole me but who's gonna separate me I don't went through the ringer but who's gonna separate me I go through my storms in this day this age every day but who's gonna separate man it ain't about what theology saying somebody else think about you their mother and we know for a fact there are many people who didn't even like Paul Paul who he Paul helped be converted amen was with Paul Paul brought the gospel and those same preachers left him Paul says none of these things move me I love that none of these things move me it doesn't matter what men think about you is what you think of yourself and who you know what God thinks of you is that okay you got to know that when God brought in David and Goliath and all the things yeah what was the name of that prophet I just heard him say it but you know what even when it comes to the Prophet God expects you to step in those shoes when it comes to whipping the devil I'll have to bring it to you I left that quote behind me but let's say like this David is a prophet and probably God said I wish we had more David what was he saying that the same attitude the same spirit that anointed David is here to launch you to destroy the the Goliath of your day you understand me those words weren't just given to the prophets they were examples because they were leaders they were leaders they were there to show the others what to do that's why God put David there and what those who were around saw what David did they then took the courage and ran after the Philistines that's what they here for and you never seen David roll back his sleeve he never blessed himself it was the people that cause corruption hallelujah is that right it was the people who brought division between David and Saul hallelujah Saul a thousand and David King taught me that's what people do that's what the anointing that's what they measure ministry and Saul and David was two different kinds of people Saul was chosen by the people and David was a prophet chose by God you can't compare those two ministries but that's what people do and sometimes people think because God then used him in such a great way there greater you know greater none of us are greater than the other piece of the same pot all saved by grace whosoever heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life it is written it is written it is written see that's the order it is written and when you take the Word of God and you realize it is written the devil can't work with you no more when you're standing on it is written he knows he defeated when you stand that only cuz you know if you don't know the word is God the devil knows the word is gone Alleluia oh yes that old ever comes amen galosh David says listen I'm taking your head off and that's what we got to stop being scared of the devil we need to start talking back hallelujah you doing what you doing but let me tell you what I'm gonna do because I know who's living in me I know he's living in me and he says in that day you'll know that I'm in the father the father's in me and I am in you and when you know that you're truly saying I don't care if it's just a little not or not that that much of God you just that same amount of God is all of God because God can be deduced oh one drop is just as important as the ocean huh y'all believe that oh it's true when listen listen so you can fully understand listen in 1st Samuel when David was fighting Goliath guess what guess what he said in the 47 verse and all the similes shall know they said listen I want you to understand this ain't me even David telling the people they say this is not me he said and this and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saved was sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and he would give you give you into our hands that's what he told Elias I want you to know and everybody around here it's not me who's defeating the diet but my God he's the one that's doing it I can't defeat a giant I can't defeat the least of demons but the name of Jesus came hallelujah who I represent he came who God's people when you backed up in a corner that's where God wants you but he wants you to come out swinging y'all hear what I'm sayin he wants you to come and grab the battle ax what have you got you know what I'm saying Jam God took McBride wet wet he took a little stick with a piece of metal hood it he whooped him down stacked him up like nothing here's one stack here's another stack here's another stack ripping him down with just a stick it had a little optical illusion something that you say come on get on he took that that's all he had you say all brothers what about David huh right Goliath let me say like this he comes along and he comes alone he gets her uh the jawbone of an ass and he whips them down you see god don't care what you got in your hand as long as you're using in faith one little stone brought the giant down one little revelation Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever will bring the China down every time it'll bring him down this is the faith of the elect we have to depend on this this is all we have this is the recipe to God's victory to our victory rather hmm this is God wonderful that he will leave this on record for you and me and all he says is that you've got to just believe it take it as it is and I'll bring it to pass is that right hallelujah sometimes you don't get just a word sometimes you just get an inspiration hallelujah like the woman with the issue of blood she had no word no record Amen where God never healed like she was bitten getting ready to be healed but some inspiration called her and said oh if I could just touch the hem of His garment I'll know I'll be made whole some of us that would have dismissed that like you know that angle make no sense and if I get down there how I'm gonna get up didn't care she did not Erie's anit that's the point she didn't let anything she knew something was taking place no enemy can stand in your way right right thou shalt say in that heart disease move from my child disease move from my body in the name of the Lord Jesus and don't doubt right there the good germs take on a new armor and a new weapon and the enemy began to back up he is defeated because Christ in the drinking of his murder cavalry defeated the devil and every one of his power hallelujah that mah represent the poison of the devil and he stripped him out everything he had and he has nothing but a bluff he can go through he can go through with it and he'll do it so what what are you saying when you realize that even the myrrh even that bit of vinegar and everything else that they tried to give was something in symbol some it was symbolic of something that old nasty thing he wasn't water hallelujah could see when you have bled like Jesus bled you won't water because water will clot alright it will help stop but they wanted to give him vinegar yeah somebody help me here but you see we must understand that when God refused that he refused every trick every disease everything the devil was gonna put on us and he rather choose death than to choose our way out somebody help me here so you say well you mean brother Brooks that's why he could say I am the waters of life I'm the one that can quench your thirst isolde hallelujah when you wounded by the devil drink of me I bring a clot to you I'll stop the hurt I'll stop the pain hallelujah glory God no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper in every tongue that show rise up against you in judgment shell thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the service of the Lord and their righteousness is of me said the Lord if they're so crane okay let me get down to something here in just a minute I'm a clothes I read this to a brother don't you know you're the lights of the world you know those dogs up there in heaven had nothing to do with their creation or what position they fell in those who are in the Orion they didn't make it was in their choice God in his own mind decided where to stop those stars in order to bring that constellation to pass y'all hear what I'm saying every star is in its place and in its purpose and nothing can stop it from being there ever since God said hold your peace hold and stand there they're still there you've heard me say this many times some stars are just radiant feeling like this and some star blinking and blinking out yeah but it doesn't matter they still stars matter of fact is those ones that blink in and blink out they seem to attract you the most some of them turn from red to green to yellow ya'll you've seen the colors of the stars exchange as you look at them but that's their glory every star is different and some have a little white light made you stare hmm nevertheless they ministers of night Bella they are the ones that makes the night look beautiful lights of the night come on somebody there you show what do you mean brother Brooks because when the Sun comes up it doesn't matter how many stars that's in the night sky they disappear in other words they make way of the Sun so they would have no honor of their own somebody help me did you hear that they disappear because they don't want no honor of their own because at night they just a reflection of the Sun to let you know there is a Sun and the real creator a real light somewhere and when the real light comes those stars of the night disappear they bow to the sunlight you understand me still there those stars are still there but all you do is see the sunlight oh somebody help me that's the way it was with the seven stars in his right hand they were only pointing us to the sunlight hallelujah when the sunlight came up they went down that's why brother branham's Eddie it is the rising of the Sun hallelujah it was the rising of the Sun and if that was the rising of the Sun that means the Stars had to disappear and I'm gonna read this for you coming from the great shining light he said you are star every Christian is a star to guide the Lost to guide the weary the foot of the to those who are seeking then the star cannot be guarded by itself it must be led by the spirit it must reflect the brilliancy of God in its life to abstain from the things of the world and to live godly and soberly in the presence of life it must reflect the light of its great one that shines what are we to do then - rise and shine the light of God to the dying in the depth darkness of this world we ought to reflect and shine the presence of the Lord Jesus in his resurrecting power as he is yesterday so is he today to reflect him but remember then the star again when it's finished his course it takes no honor the star just brought the man to their destination and showed them the perfect light is that right John said behold the lamb of God I must decrease he must increase right listen goes on it says and we as members of the body of Christ this morning friends we are God's light but we take no honor to ourselves when we got out our paying our persons that we're leading when we got them we must dishonor ourselves and lead them to the great and perfect light which shining - to light the way of every man that comes in the world the Lord Jesus Christ that is our purpose to direct people to the Lord Jesus Christ and then when we get them there we do not seek honor we move out the way so they can see that it's all about the Lord Jesus Christ and not about us less dead just keep on praying all the Lord is not just keep on praying he'll cry for the Lord has promised and it would is true top keep on playing it he'll answer you tears keep on playin all the Lord is not just keep on freeing your craw well the Lord is Thomas and his word is true keep on begging he'll answer you Oh early in the morning oh the Lord is nigh yes early in the morning he'll cry for the Lord Thomas and his word is true just keep on playin he'll answer you in the midnight hour for the Lord is not in the midnight hour hear your cries for the Lord has Palmer and his word is true keep breaking he'll answer you wait shanks keep on free yes hey the Lord is not we're just people free hear your cry oh the Lord is parvis in the midnight just keep just keep on hallelujah let me read one more quote if it's okay hallelujah God is so good to us I just appreciate the Lord hallelujah I think God for everything that he's doing it has done for us so did you realize that God don't care nothing about what you think about organization and denomination and somehow even in this message we have gotten to the place where we will discriminate and we shouldn't we know we're different there's like your left hand and your right hand they're not the same but they're part of you we don't know where everybody is located in the body of Christ we don't know what's in people's heart but one thing we know according to Revelation the Bible tells us come out of her my people so therefore his people are somewhere in there and it's up to God to call them out but how did God call them out except by us y'all hear me we're the ones that went down amen to Jericho we're the ones that spied out the land we're the ones that talked to rehab somebody help me here and told her the only way you going to escape is that you have to put this scarlet ribbon out your window let people know the token has been applied hallelujah and it's so amazing that she didn't even come out until God destroyed Jericho but she was saved in her house the kingdom is an everlasting or eternal Kingdom y'all know that see God is no respecter person but he honored those in every nation who desired to serve Him in righteousness though you be in error this is what got me he said though you be in error yet in the righteousness or the projective of your heart that you desire to serve God he said God will honor that see it ain't your era it's what's in your heart though therefore denomination has no lies that they can set it this is you with Baptist Methodist pinochle whatever no denomination can put lines there so if you don't belong here you're not ours mm-hmm he says listen it's watching the man heart no matter where they are is in the heart God's business is to pull them out but we are supposed to tell them right he says listen therefore he says no denomination has no laws that can be consent that stops God to any certain Creed because God will look upon the motive of the human heart and there he will work from that spot hmm I mean come on what was Ruth she was part of a denomination she was a part of Moab but it took me home and her sons that go through all kinds of stuff to tell her so that you can see there's a real God there's a blood sacrifice that hogs were already been made you don't have to sacrifice these babies y'all understand me I'm not taking you from I'm just quoting what the Prophet said you believe it you got to believe it all look at us maybe some of y'all with more i wasn't born in the message I was out in the world I went from the nomination to the nomination but for certain there was something in my heart that respected God and I wanted him and God used that Wow cuz he put it in my heart I didn't all of a sudden say well you know I'm gonna see God no God put that respect in my heart I didn't have to struggle with Trinity I knew God was one God revealed that to me in a Baptist Church I knew that God didn't appreciate women preach us in a Baptist Church she when you the seed of God it ain't you those revelations that come it ain't you it's the seed in you that's revealing this thing to you Peter flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but my father went to the heaven he has reason his thing and that's the way God always worked he's the one that reveals father do you thank God for the seed of God blessed and God is the reveal of the word he's the one you have people amen studying and got their masters DVDs LD DS and still don't know as much as you do why because they for learning it's not correct but if any man seek out the God he said for man hunger and thirst after after me I will feel him that's God's law hallelujah I don't God don't care if you born within the handout of prostitution them or whatever it God don't care if there's a seed in you God or save you the blood of Jesus Christ is the saving power of God oh I love the Lord God don't care about your background hallelujah all he cares about what he did for you and God will see that seed that's why I love him because the Bible said that the Lord Nord them that are he is who praise the name of the Lord predestination we ought to thank God for word every day to realize hey man I have passed from death unto life and nothing can stop me from making heaven not because of me it's it's all why is his word he promised me you said well what about all of the others I'm so sorry I don't fully understand everything but I know what Redemption means every deem means to bring back get back that which once was yours and I'm so glad that I can hear you see millions billions of people Amen they don't even know that Jesus Christ is the savior some thinks he's a prophet you know means some think he's just a good man but I know him as my Lord and Savior my Redeemer my husband I look forward to our translation and I tell you what I believe with all my heart we don't have much longer i love the lord i love you lord and I leave my voice to worship you O my soul read or take all my
