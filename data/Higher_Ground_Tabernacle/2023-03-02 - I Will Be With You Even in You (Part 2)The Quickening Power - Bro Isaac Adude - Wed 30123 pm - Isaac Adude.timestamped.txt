[42:28] with the same thought so it'll be the
[42:30] part two
[42:34] so the titles I will be with you even in
[42:38] you
[42:40] yeah
[42:47] man let's uh turn to John Chapter 14
[42:50] verse 13 to 20.
[42:55] when the Bible says
[42:59] and whatsoever you shall ask in my name
[43:01] doubt will I do that the father may be
[43:04] glorified in the son is
[43:10] if you if if you shall ask anything in
[43:14] my name I will do it
[43:17] if you love me keep my Commandments
[43:21] now verse 16 it says that and I will
[43:23] pray the father and he shall give you
[43:26] another comforter that he may abide with
[43:28] you forever the verse says
[43:32] [Music]
[43:35] even the spirit of Truth whom the world
[43:39] cannot receive because he seeth him not
[43:43] neither nor was him but he nor him amen
[43:46] for he dwells with you and shall be in
[43:49] you veritas
[43:58] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[44:02] come to you
[44:05] had a little while and the world seeth
[44:08] me no more by ye see me because I leave
[44:11] you shall live also
[44:18] at that day you shall know that I am in
[44:21] my father and ye in me and I in you
[44:27] um
[44:30] here in verse 16 when Jesus said I will
[44:33] pray the father to send you another
[44:35] conference
[44:41] he wasn't talking about the second
[44:43] person
[44:45] he was talking about himself changing
[44:48] forms
[44:51] amen let's let's go to Romans chapter 8
[44:54] verse 9 to verse 11.
[44:58] almost
[45:01] verses
[45:07] Romans chapter 8 verse 9 to verse 11.
[45:12] the Bible says that by you are not in
[45:16] the flesh but in the spirit
[45:18] if so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[45:22] you now if any man have not the spirit
[45:25] of Christ he is none of his
[45:30] friend
[45:35] and if Christ be in you the body is dead
[45:39] because of sin but the spirit is life
[45:42] because of righteousness is
[45:51] verse 11 and this is where I took my
[45:54] subtitles
[45:57] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[46:00] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[46:03] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[46:05] also Quicken your mortal Body by his
[46:08] Spirit at dwells amen
[46:23] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[46:27] in you he that raised their Christ from
[46:30] the dead shall also Quicken your moral
[46:32] bodies by his spirit that dwells in amen
[46:48] father God will come down the vinyl Lord
[46:51] in your presence tonight

[47:16] continue to be with us this evening
[47:20] and
[47:21] may may US Lord father God let us
[47:25] experience that quickening power
[47:28] Lord I pray father God that you be with
[47:31] me Lord
[47:32] that you take me out of the way father
[47:35] and you speak to your people
[47:38] Lord as I always say father God I pray
[47:41] that you make me so sensitive to the
[47:44] Holy Spirit father
[47:55] [Music]
[48:08] tonight we'll we'll be talking about a
[48:11] little subject uh it's called the
[48:13] quickening power there's no problems
[48:17] amen because in John chapter 14.
[48:20] amen there we see where Jesus was saying
[48:23] that I will pray the father to send you
[48:25] another comforter
[48:29] because Jesus was going to the end of
[48:33] his ministry as the son of man as Jesus
[48:36] the word made flesh that's because
[48:42] amen so he needed to change his form
[48:45] Allah
[48:47] so that he can continue to be with us
[48:51] because there was a greater promise
[48:54] coming but having gone promise so that
[48:57] the Jesus who was with us who was with
[48:59] the disciples
[49:01] now I had a promise that he has given
[49:04] that he will be in them
[49:07] in other words it will be men amen and
[49:10] God merging together
[49:17] because as we said it on on Sunday that
[49:20] in the beginning was in the beginning it
[49:22] was the word and the Word was made flesh
[49:28] and that word dwell and that word uh
[49:32] dwelled Among Us
[49:34] that word was that was Jesus Christ
[49:38] amen he
[49:43] he walked with us he did all kinds of
[49:47] things that a human Mania and human
[49:49] being can do yeah
[49:51] so that Jesus amen was still wanted to
[49:56] continue to have that fellowship with
[49:58] the human being
[50:02] so he wasn't gonna be the only Jesus
[50:05] being in one place
[50:08] being in one place at the time
[50:11] but now he gave his promise to be
[50:14] everywhere
[50:16] in other words to divide himself in
[50:19] different parts
[50:21] so that he can dwell inside of us
[50:24] it's like the prophet said that the word
[50:26] was made flesh
[50:29] and that word was Jesus is it at that
[50:32] time
[50:33] so now Jesus has died on the cross
[50:37] so he sent his Spirit back down on Earth
[50:42] so that the spirit cannot cannot can
[50:45] again become flesh focus on his
[50:47] crucified and become the bride
[50:50] because the bride and the Grooms are won
[50:54] and now he is the word made flesh
[50:58] because God can only use your feet
[51:02] God can only use your mouth
[51:06] you can only use your eyes to see in the
[51:09] book so you have become the Tabernacle
[51:12] of
[52:05] it means to be made alive after death
[52:10] meaning that you
[52:32] foreign but bear grain you may change uh
[52:37] uh uh you made a chance of wheat or of
[52:39] some other grain
[52:42] programs
[52:44] now verse 38 he says that but God giveth
[52:47] it a body as he has pleased him and to
[52:51] every seed his own body
[52:58] amen you have first to die
[53:00] and then you will and then that you will
[53:04] be quickened yeah
[53:05] so Paul Cantina University 42.
[53:09] now he's showing now the power of that
[53:12] quickening spirit
[53:15] that we can Empower him and gives you a
[53:18] Perfection
[53:20] it gives you the perfection in your body
[53:24] it says that so also is the resurrection
[53:26] of the Dead the NC on it is
[53:29] sun in corruption and
[53:43] [Music]
[54:20] your face being this
[54:33] of the resurrection of the perfect body
