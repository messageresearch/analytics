[44:31] that
[44:32] god comes down and he touches our hearts
[44:34] right god
[44:35] god has no respect for persons or
[44:37] numbers of persons he looks at faith
[44:39] amen
[44:40] and there's a quote i read brother brown
[44:41] talked about he said brother sister as
[44:42] it came down
[44:43] it would be smaller and smaller groups
[44:46] amen and you notice as you refine gold
[44:48] when you start out with that ore it's a
[44:49] big chunk but as you work it down what
[44:51] does it get finer and finer and finer
[44:54] amen and i believe that our prophet he
[44:56] spoke about
[44:57] perfect love amen and when he went
[44:59] across the curtain of time if you
[45:01] remember that story he tells
[45:03] it's not a story he was telling us a
[45:05] testimony when he went across that
[45:06] curtain of time
[45:07] and he came back to our sister he went
[45:09] where they had
[45:10] made it he went where they had made it
[45:14] and he said nothing will enter in there
[45:17] but perfect love
[45:18] yeah i'm convinced now more than ever
[45:20] that nothing will enter in there but
[45:22] perfect love
[45:22] so when i read the scripture and it says
[45:24] that you could have the the tongues of
[45:26] men and angels you could preach
[45:27] the house down brush it doesn't matter
[45:29] if you don't got love it profits you
[45:31] nothing amen so tonight we are warned
[45:33] that
[45:34] the love of many will wax cold right and
[45:37] that he asked us to go back to our first
[45:39] work so
[45:40] if you would let's just turn over to
[45:41] first john there's many familiar
[45:43] scriptures that come with
[45:44] with the love of god but we want to be
[45:46] identified and so this
[45:48] this scripture here in 1st john chapter
[45:50] 4 we're going to go through here and i
[45:52] usually have a lot of quotes and i
[45:53] apologize that
[45:54] i honestly did not know i was coming
[45:56] here so if if i say something verbatim i
[45:59] usually like to quote it just like he
[46:00] said it
[46:01] um because that's the only message we
[46:03] got brother sister
[46:04] i don't have my own message amen we have
[46:06] a messenger right
[46:07] and he was sent and signified by his
[46:09] angel onto his servant john right the
[46:11] angel's the one that set and signified
[46:13] it so if you would
[46:14] first john chapter 4 it says beloved
[46:18] believe not every spirit but try the
[46:20] spirits
[46:21] whether they are of god because many
[46:24] false prophets are gone
[46:25] out into the world right we witness that
[46:27] all around us we see what people are
[46:29] teaching what they're telling people we
[46:30] can witness it
[46:31] it says hereby know you the spirit of
[46:33] god every spirit that confesses
[46:35] that jesus christ is come in the flesh
[46:39] is of god and every spirit that
[46:41] confesseth not that jesus christ has
[46:43] come in the flesh
[46:44] is not of god and this is that spirit of
[46:47] antichrist
[46:48] wherever you have heard that it should
[46:49] come and even now already
[46:51] is it in the world ye are of god little
[46:53] children have overcome them because
[46:55] greater is he
[46:56] that is in you than he that is in the
[46:58] world
[46:59] they are of the world therefore speak
[47:01] they of the world and the world heareth
[47:03] them
[47:04] we are of god he that knoweth god
[47:07] heareth us he that is not of god heareth
[47:09] not us hereby know we the spirit of
[47:11] truth
[47:12] and the spirit of error beloved let us
[47:16] love one another isn't it interesting as
[47:18] it goes through this identification of
[47:20] what the spirit of the antichrist and
[47:21] the spirit of christ are
[47:22] he goes right into brother and said let
[47:24] us love one another
[47:26] let us love one another for love is of
[47:29] god and everyone that loveth
[47:32] is born of god and knoweth god amen
[47:36] he that loveth not knoweth not god for
[47:39] god is love amen let's bow our heads to
[47:43] gracious
[47:44] heavenly father lord god we come to you
[47:46] tonight lord
[47:47] grateful for the love of god in our
[47:48] hearts lord thanking you for this
[47:50] message you've sent to us lord for
[47:52] opening up our eyes for giving us
[47:53] ears to hear and hearts to believe lord
[47:56] this precious message father for it is a
[47:58] late hour lord and we see it
[47:59] and i just pray that do us the great
[48:01] honor of completely moving me out of the
[48:03] way
[48:04] and just speak to us by the holy spirit
[48:06] tonight father you brought us here
[48:07] together father and we know lord
[48:09] it was your perfect will for the
[48:10] footsteps of the righteous
[48:12] are ordered of the lord so we commit the
[48:14] service into your hands now and ask your
[48:16] blessings and for your grace
[48:17] and jesus christ precious name we thank
[48:19] thee and pray amen
[48:21] amen god bless you you may be seated and
[48:24] if you say amen if you shout you want to
[48:26] get up and dance or sing whatever you
[48:27] want to do brother sister
[48:28] i i believe in every gift that god has
[48:31] to give amen
[48:33] and so if if if i say anything that's
[48:35] wrong brother just please forgive me
[48:36] just counter to my ignorance like
[48:37] brother brown said just spit the pits
[48:40] out right
[48:40] all right i never stopped eating cherry
[48:42] pie because i hit a pit but so as we go
[48:44] through this brother sister beloved let
[48:46] us love one another for the love is
[48:48] of god and everyone that loveth is born
[48:50] of god
[48:51] and knoweth god and he that loveth not
[48:54] knoweth not god for god
[48:56] is love and we know that brother adam
[48:57] he'd establish the difference between
[48:58] agape and filial love
[49:00] right he said feel your love is the kind
[49:02] of love that would make you um kill a
[49:03] man if he was cheating with your wife
[49:05] he says but agape love is ramen that'll
[49:06] make you pray for your wife and that man
[49:09] right now that seems very anti-human and
[49:10] it is because it can't be the spirit of
[49:12] man that overcomes it's the spirit of
[49:14] god that overcomes my sister
[49:15] it's the love of god and in the hour
[49:18] that we're living and the devil is doing
[49:19] everything in his power to rob us of the
[49:22] love of god
[49:23] right now maybe not so much to rob us of
[49:25] going to church not to rob us a pain or
[49:27] ties not to rob us of a whole lot of
[49:29] things but if you don't have the love of
[49:30] god all those things profit us nothing
[49:32] brother sister
[49:33] the love of god is something that the
[49:34] devil is robbing people of and the
[49:36] reason
[49:36] he's robbing them of it because love
[49:38] produces
[49:40] faith you got to remember he says they
[49:42] asked him the question what's greater
[49:43] love or faith he says
[49:44] love because love produces faith but
[49:47] faith does not produce
[49:48] love right and it says do i have faith
[49:50] to move mountains but have not charity
[49:52] it profited me nothing and our prophet
[49:54] said
[49:54] if you want to know how i do all these
[49:56] things how i i'll stop these animals and
[49:58] these
[49:58] he says it's with love right we remember
[50:01] when he tells us those story he was out
[50:03] there mowing his lawn that one day
[50:04] and he hits that beehive and all the
[50:06] hornets come running out there
[50:08] and he says he didn't get scared right
[50:10] because perfect love
[50:11] casteth out all fear he didn't get angry
[50:13] because
[50:14] love is very patient it came to him
[50:17] as an anointing right that anointing
[50:20] came down and he said i
[50:21] love them right he put himself in their
[50:24] shoes little creatures
[50:26] insignificant thinks he but god's not a
[50:28] respecter of persons
[50:29] right neither was his prophet he said oh
[50:31] i'm so sorry i bumped into you
[50:33] with i'm just trying to mow my lawn i've
[50:34] been praying for the sick people there's
[50:35] a few chances i got to come out here and
[50:37] mow
[50:37] oh just would you please just go back
[50:39] and he says they lined up
[50:41] and went back into that nest what was it
[50:43] love did that
[50:45] right he didn't get up and pray some big
[50:46] prayer he didn't get he didn't call down
[50:48] fire from heaven nothing he just spoke
[50:50] to those bees and they went back into
[50:52] their nest because he had the love of
[50:54] god on the inside run sister
[50:56] when that man from portland came up to
[50:58] him that maniac and said i'm going to
[50:59] punch you into the
[51:00] the stalls back here he said he was more
[51:03] than able to do it but the rest said i
[51:04] was 150 pounds soaking wet
[51:06] but he was standing there and that
[51:08] spirit came up because it wasn't that
[51:09] man he was a spirit in that man
[51:11] that's man that's why we can love all
[51:12] people you can even love your enemies
[51:14] because you got to remember
[51:15] it's not the people it's the spirits on
[51:17] the people
[51:18] or in the people that's why we can love
[51:20] our enemies brother sister
[51:22] but that man came up to brother branham
[51:23] and he had something on him see
[51:25] he thought that spirit was right
[51:28] he thought that spirit was right and if
[51:31] someone's got a spirit on him like that
[51:33] that thinks it's right
[51:34] brother sister you fussing and fighting
[51:36] with ain't gonna do a thing with that
[51:38] spirit
[51:39] right and that spirit came up to him and
[51:40] it started cussing and yelling at him
[51:42] and screaming and threatening him and
[51:43] doing all these things
[51:44] and what did brother madame do he loved
[51:46] the man
[51:48] right he said that spirit came and it
[51:49] came down and he looked at that man he
[51:51] says this is just a man
[51:53] probably got a wife and some kids he
[51:55] don't want to be it's that spirit that's
[51:56] on him
[51:57] all right he said he loved him and what
[51:58] did it do the spirit spit in his face
[52:01] oh how many of us would pass that test
[52:03] there or help us lord
[52:06] right oh that's but that's a prophet but
[52:07] he's got the same spirit you've got to
[52:09] have
[52:10] you may have a different office he may
[52:12] have an office that's specific but
[52:13] sister you have to have the same spirit
[52:15] that he had
[52:16] amen it's the same jesus christ god
[52:18] don't give you a dip in jesus christ you
[52:20] may have a different office but you are
[52:21] called of god
[52:23] you're just as much a part of the body
[52:24] as any other part of the body i may not
[52:26] be the eye
[52:27] but if i'm the skin on the bottom of the
[52:28] feet all devils in hell are still under
[52:30] me
[52:31] right but we got to have that love right
[52:34] so he stood there and he's watching that
[52:35] man spits right in his face
[52:38] and he said i just i loved him and when
[52:41] he reached back to go punch him
[52:43] it says he said since you've challenged
[52:44] the spirit of god you'll fall before my
[52:47] feet
[52:47] it says i'll show you whose feet that
[52:49] fall reaches back
[52:52] falls right on his feet the police come
[52:53] up look at this is he healed he says no
[52:55] because he believes in that spirit he
[52:57] thinks it's right
[52:58] he says but he'll be okay and he was
[53:02] but what did it love conquered that
[53:05] spirit amen
[53:06] right love is the thing that changes the
[53:08] atmosphere in your home
[53:10] right love is god if you want god in
[53:12] your house you gotta have love in your
[53:13] house
[53:14] right too many people that come in with
[53:15] the book of rules and i believe in
[53:17] holiness and sanctity and all those
[53:18] things brother sister if you try to live
[53:20] it by a book of rules you're just as
[53:22] good as a pharisee or a sadducee
[53:23] you're going right back to the law
[53:24] you're going right back to the things
[53:26] that paul was preaching against right in
[53:28] our messenger he did not bring a
[53:29] different message that paul brought
[53:30] right he brought the same exact message
[53:32] magnified multiply brought up to our day
[53:34] and if that kind of allah had to be back
[53:36] there it's got to be in this day too
[53:38] if it's the kind of love that would send
[53:39] paul into a city after being stoned and
[53:41] go right back into and say oh he came
[53:42] back to encourage the people right they
[53:44] had killed they'd stoned him they dug
[53:46] him out of the city and thought he was
[53:47] dead and what do you do he gets right
[53:48] back up goes to another city comes right
[53:49] back and says oh i came here to
[53:51] encourage you
[53:52] why because he loved them more than his
[53:55] own life more than his own well-being
[53:56] more than his own feelings more than
[53:58] anything else he loved god and he loved
[54:01] god's
[54:02] people right we didn't get a lot of
[54:03] commandments from jesus christ we got a
[54:05] lot of the word being fulfilled but one
[54:06] of the commandments he said
[54:07] love one another as i have loved you
[54:11] right why is that so important all men
[54:13] will know you my disciples when you have
[54:14] love one for another man it seems like
[54:16] love keeps coming up a whole lot
[54:18] right and it seems to be the thing that
[54:20] the devil's fighting tooth and nail
[54:22] not just amongst brothers and sisters in
[54:24] the church but brothers and sisters in
[54:25] different churches
[54:26] right there seems to be a disunity when
[54:28] we should have one messenger right if
[54:30] we're all following the same messenger
[54:31] we should have one goal to make heaven
[54:33] our home
[54:34] well i don't care about lifting up a
[54:35] church or any church name or any group
[54:37] or in denomination
[54:38] i'm all about getting us lifted up right
[54:40] we don't edify
[54:41] a building we edify a body right a body
[54:44] of believers which brother sister
[54:46] the heart and the liver and the lungs
[54:48] are all separate
[54:49] they all do their own things but they're
[54:51] connected right but the liver don't tell
[54:53] the heart how to do its thing
[54:55] right that's why every church is
[54:56] sovereign amen i believe that every
[54:58] church is sovereign and when you have a
[55:00] love like brother branham said he said
[55:01] you should be able to
[55:02] bitterly disagree with one another and
[55:05] still love each other like brothers
[55:07] and if you can't do it i don't care how
[55:09] right you are i don't care how great
[55:11] you're doctrine
[55:11] i don't care how powerful your ministry
[55:13] i don't care how how generous you are
[55:16] all i care is do you have the love of
[55:17] god
[55:19] lord give me the love of god because all
[55:21] those other things will follow
[55:23] right because once you get the giver you
[55:25] get all the gifts
[55:27] right once you get the giver you get all
[55:28] the gifts but the gift
[55:30] the greatest gift is the love of god
[55:33] brother sister
[55:34] god is love listen
[55:37] he says and this was manifested the love
[55:39] of god toward us because that god sent
[55:41] his only begotten son into the world
[55:44] that we might
[55:45] live through him right so his love sent
[55:48] him to us
[55:50] right his love sent him to us and our
[55:53] love is what recognizes him
[55:56] right because this is a love letter and
[55:58] if it was sent to you you can only
[55:59] recognize it if you're in love with the
[56:01] sender right that's the reason some
[56:02] people can read this word of god it
[56:04] means
[56:04] absolutely nothing to them right and
[56:07] that's the same thing for the love
[56:08] letter we got in the seventh age
[56:10] right when he said that eliezer was some
[56:12] gifts down to the people so he can bring
[56:13] him back to the place that they are
[56:14] supposed to be
[56:16] right it's a restoration message right
[56:19] the restoration of what the bride tree
[56:22] right in the bride tree she bears fruit
[56:24] what's one of those fruits
[56:27] that's one of the most important ones
[56:29] right because it's
[56:30] it's one of the things the devil takes
[56:32] off first right
[56:33] those fruits of the spirit the sweetness
[56:35] the gentleman make this kind all those
[56:36] things that
[56:37] love why because when someone comes into
[56:39] a church and there's no love they'll
[56:40] leave the church
[56:41] right when someone comes into the house
[56:42] of god and they don't know god bless how
[56:44] they're going to know god
[56:45] if they don't know that god is love
[56:47] right and how can they know the love of
[56:49] god
[56:49] if they can experience god in flesh and
[56:52] anyone that says that christ comes not
[56:54] in the flesh is the spirit of antichrist
[56:57] but those who say that christ comes in
[56:58] the flesh that god fills us with the
[57:00] holy ghost that's that god still gives
[57:02] us a love that can make us turn the
[57:03] other cheek
[57:04] verses that god still has power to
[57:06] change men and women today
[57:08] are too many people that just want to
[57:09] come in to have church versus a lot of
[57:11] people come to church and they find
[57:12] religion but very few people find christ
[57:15] and there's a difference the pharisees
[57:17] had religion and they crucified christ
[57:20] but those ignorant fishermen they had a
[57:22] love for god
[57:23] they had a love and that god recognized
[57:25] it he was willing to give
[57:27] peter a man who would deny him three
[57:29] times
[57:30] cut off a man's ear go right back to the
[57:32] fission after christ
[57:33] and he still gave him the keys to the
[57:36] kingdom
[57:37] amen why because peter loved god and
[57:40] jesus christ so much
[57:41] when he asked him where else would we go
[57:43] will you leave also where else
[57:45] only you lord have the words of eternal
[57:48] life
[57:48] what would make a man stay with somebody
[57:50] who's being rejected by the church
[57:52] leaders
[57:52] whether not by the numbers of people by
[57:54] the multitudes
[57:55] who just said eat the flesh of my flesh
[57:57] and drink the blood of my blood
[57:59] or you have no part in me what would
[58:01] make you stay
[58:03] i know i've said some crazy things what
[58:04] made my waist type with me it was love
[58:07] cause she loved me she maybe didn't
[58:09] understand but he brought it all around
[58:10] the lord worked it out
[58:11] peter's standing there witnessing the
[58:13] man he loved say something that doesn't
[58:15] make any sense
[58:16] doesn't make a lick of sense but he says
[58:19] oh where else could we go
[58:22] whereas only you have the words of
[58:23] eternal life he didn't understand
[58:25] see what love does you ever done
[58:27] something you didn't understand because
[58:28] you're in love with somebody
[58:30] love is a powerful force and that's
[58:32] filial love
[58:34] that's just the that's just the shadow
[58:36] of the type
[58:37] right what about god's perfect agape
[58:40] love
[58:41] right that's why the devil fights us on
[58:43] praying and reading our bibles
[58:44] and listening to them tapes and i'm not
[58:46] just talking about playing in the
[58:47] background i'm talking about
[58:48] receiving what's coming off of them
[58:50] tapes receiving something in that prayer
[58:52] a lot of times we get down and we pray
[58:54] and we just we don't break on through
[58:57] now remember he said repent and go back
[59:00] to your first love
[59:02] oh my we're right back to love and the
[59:04] hour that we're living he says repent go
[59:05] back to your first love
[59:07] what was it he said it was that love of
[59:08] those old-fashioned pentecostal meetings
[59:11] right where the holy ghost came down
[59:12] when the fire came down oh but it's
[59:14] wednesday night we're tired we've got to
[59:15] work
[59:16] god don't care about that god wants to
[59:18] be worshipped and praised by
[59:19] who whosoever will who is ever so
[59:23] willing to worship god and to love him
[59:25] to stand up and praise him and give him
[59:27] what he do he'll do everything
[59:29] a life for love every every sister you
[59:31] have a
[59:32] duty as a christian but a duty will not
[59:35] keep you
[59:37] we have a duty as christians but i don't
[59:39] do things out of a sense of duty
[59:40] i do them because i love god
[59:44] and i tell you what love has made so
[59:46] much more of a difference in my life
[59:47] than a whole lot of other things now
[59:48] if you love god he'll make you line up
[59:50] with the word it's not some
[59:52] i'm not talking about no dodie
[59:53] grandfather love that just let you go
[59:55] out live any old life and do anything
[59:57] but sister that's not the love of god
[59:59] that's turning the grace of god into
[1:00:00] lasciviousness right
[1:00:02] what we want is the love that makes us
[1:00:06] live a life amen because you can't live
[1:00:09] that life without that life you can't do
[1:00:14] it without it
[1:00:15] you'll be miserable you'll be backslid
[1:00:18] you'll be up and down
[1:00:19] in and out you'll be wondering why can't
[1:00:21] i get the victory why can't i get the
[1:00:22] victory but sister
[1:00:23] you need to get back to the first works
[1:00:25] ready to get back to that law
[1:00:27] that's the hour that we're living in
[1:00:29] that's the thing people aren't willing
[1:00:30] to do oh i've been in this message for
[1:00:31] 20 30 40 50 years god don't care how
[1:00:33] many years you've been in this message
[1:00:35] what happened when's the last time you
[1:00:36] got experience with the holy ghost
[1:00:38] when's the last time you cried out to
[1:00:40] god the last time you got
[1:00:42] on your knees and prayed like you used
[1:00:44] to pray
[1:00:45] well god wants us to go back to those
[1:00:47] first works to remember that we ain't
[1:00:49] nothing just because we've been in a
[1:00:50] message for a couple of years
[1:00:51] that we ain't nobody because we think we
[1:00:52] know something more than somebody else
[1:00:54] brother sister we are
[1:00:55] nothing without god you know there's
[1:00:58] only one qualification
[1:00:59] to be a christian you got to be a sinner
[1:01:03] and we all qualified we all qualified
[1:01:06] but by the grace of god he's brought us
[1:01:08] here and it's by love
[1:01:10] what put him on a cross it wasn't duty
[1:01:14] it wasn't because he felt obligated it
[1:01:17] was
[1:01:18] love that put him on that cross right
[1:01:20] and what makes us serve him
[1:01:23] my sister it's love
[1:01:26] if you do it out of any other source
[1:01:28] it'll run out
[1:01:30] it'll run out if you try to do it out of
[1:01:32] a sense of duty my sister there's people
[1:01:34] that can live
[1:01:35] almost all the way up to the end of
[1:01:36] their time and then when the time comes
[1:01:38] they realize
[1:01:39] they don't have anything you can live
[1:01:42] righteous you can live holy
[1:01:44] those pharisees that rich young ruler he
[1:01:47] walked up to jesus
[1:01:49] and he said lord what must i do to
[1:01:51] inherit eternal life
[1:01:54] and jesus looked at and he loved him oh
[1:01:56] my
[1:01:57] for god so loved the world and he loved
[1:02:00] him
[1:02:00] but he looked at him he said go sell all
[1:02:02] that he says you know all the
[1:02:03] commandments
[1:02:04] honor that mother that father don't tell
[1:02:06] a lie he said i've done
[1:02:07] all of these things i don't know about
[1:02:10] you but i couldn't say that
[1:02:12] i couldn't stand there and say i've done
[1:02:13] all of these things since the days i was
[1:02:15] a child
[1:02:17] but he could he stood i've done all
[1:02:18] these things but what else must i do
[1:02:20] even he knew he was missing something
[1:02:23] amen
[1:02:25] christ looked at him says tell all thy
[1:02:26] good come follow me
[1:02:29] oh how may how many today
[1:02:32] are caught up in that old trap of not
[1:02:34] being willing
[1:02:36] to give up anything everything and come
[1:02:39] follow jesus and they said he left
[1:02:42] sorrowful and he was sorrowful because
[1:02:43] brother man says next time we saw him he
[1:02:44] was down in hell
[1:02:46] my sister that rich young ruler he
[1:02:48] didn't recognize
[1:02:50] that just being a good person just being
[1:02:52] nice just being this or
[1:02:54] being generous whatever he was sister
[1:02:56] it's more than that
[1:02:59] and we have to get back to that love of
[1:03:02] god
[1:03:03] in our churches and in our hearts and in
[1:03:05] our walk
[1:03:06] and in our homes and wherever we go and
[1:03:08] wherever our sister
[1:03:09] you only have one opportunity in all
[1:03:10] your life to save a soul it's in the
[1:03:12] hour that you're living right now
[1:03:14] to testify to somebody to reach out to
[1:03:15] somebody to be that reason that
[1:03:16] somebody's coming to church or serving
[1:03:18] the lord maybe gets baptized you never
[1:03:19] know what kind of seed you're going to
[1:03:20] plant when you go out with the love of
[1:03:22] god and demonstrate it to people
[1:03:24] people are starving to death out here
[1:03:26] they're starving to death
[1:03:28] right and some of us though we shouldn't
[1:03:30] be we're still hungry
[1:03:32] because we're not filling up like we
[1:03:33] should right we're wondering why we're
[1:03:36] our
[1:03:36] our love is waxing cold do you do you
[1:03:38] find it a little bit harder to forgive
[1:03:40] people
[1:03:41] do you find a little bit harder to to to
[1:03:44] get a little you know gracious get into
[1:03:45] the spirit
[1:03:46] find a little harder to pray i don't
[1:03:47] know about you but it seems like the
[1:03:48] devil's been fighting really really hard
[1:03:50] remember ram talked about 200 000 000
[1:03:52] demons unleashed upon the bride
[1:03:55] not the world he said upon the bride so
[1:03:57] what what what
[1:03:58] must we do brother sister let's run back
[1:04:01] to the love of god
[1:04:03] the genuine sincere love of god or when
[1:04:06] you read the word it's not just that a
[1:04:07] habit
[1:04:08] all right i know we've all done it right
[1:04:11] we've all done it
[1:04:12] you go and you read it and you did it
[1:04:14] and you're still honoring
[1:04:15] the word of god you're still doing
[1:04:17] you're out you're doing what a prophet
[1:04:18] said to do
[1:04:19] but brother and sister if you're reading
[1:04:21] it and it's not hitting you like it
[1:04:23] should
[1:04:24] go and read it again oh but i got too
[1:04:27] much to do no no something's wrong with
[1:04:29] you and the lord
[1:04:30] go back and do it again right because
[1:04:33] you don't know what time your time is
[1:04:34] going to come up bruh it says you know
[1:04:35] when the lord's going to pull your
[1:04:36] number and say it's time to come on home
[1:04:38] right make your calling and election
[1:04:41] shore
[1:04:42] right the bride has made herself
[1:04:46] she's the one who did why because she
[1:04:47] was already given everything
[1:04:49] she was given all the gifts eliza
[1:04:51] brought it all right this is what we we
[1:04:53] are dressed
[1:04:54] by the message of the hour right and
[1:04:56] that message
[1:04:57] is getting us back and if it's a return
[1:05:00] then i got to look back into the hours
[1:05:01] of
[1:05:02] that we're living which is revelation
[1:05:03] and it says repent and go
[1:05:05] back to your first works your first love
[1:05:08] right and those pentecostal meetings
[1:05:10] nowadays brother sister you could tell
[1:05:12] people don't want to worship people
[1:05:14] don't want to worship
[1:05:15] i mean worship i'm not just talking
[1:05:17] about getting loud there's a lot of
[1:05:17] people get lost i'm talking about wars
[1:05:19] you know worship is
[1:05:20] oh thank you lord thank you there's
[1:05:23] something to it it goes deeper than just
[1:05:24] making some noise
[1:05:25] you're screaming and crying out to god
[1:05:27] you're lifting your hands you're
[1:05:28] praising it why
[1:05:29] because you love the lord god almighty
[1:05:32] not because someone just told you to or
[1:05:34] the song leader said lift up your hands
[1:05:36] you should come into the house of god
[1:05:39] with the love of god
[1:05:40] and the other brothers got the love of
[1:05:42] god the other brothers got to imagine a
[1:05:43] whole church full with the love of god
[1:05:45] right every time we come in there's a
[1:05:47] problem what happens the lord just
[1:05:48] brings that love down in there we
[1:05:49] forgive one another
[1:05:51] right we build on that and that how's
[1:05:52] the church grow oh and it's got them
[1:05:55] roots brown sister
[1:05:56] and that love reaches out and they've
[1:05:58] got all those things that are coming
[1:05:59] into us but so we have an
[1:06:01] uh we have an amazing opportunity
[1:06:05] to show people in the darkest time that
[1:06:09] has ever been
[1:06:10] the light of god the love of god
[1:06:14] and people are looking for people are
[1:06:16] hungry
[1:06:17] for the love right and i'm not just
[1:06:19] talking about people that you see every
[1:06:21] day i'm talking people on the streets
[1:06:22] brother sister
[1:06:23] you don't know i was we were driving
[1:06:24] here and i i had taken out
[1:06:27] twenty dollars in cash and i didn't even
[1:06:28] know why i took it out and i just had it
[1:06:30] there and sit in my wallet sit in my
[1:06:32] wallet
[1:06:32] finally i was gonna go buy something
[1:06:33] from the gas station and as i was
[1:06:35] walking over the gas station
[1:06:36] and there was this man standing there
[1:06:39] and he was just you know he had his mask
[1:06:41] on everything and
[1:06:42] then the lord said go talk to him and i
[1:06:44] was like it's gotta match me just want
[1:06:46] people walking up to him you know it's
[1:06:48] like
[1:06:48] you know your mind works right by a
[1:06:50] little oh you start reasoning it out no
[1:06:52] but the love of god don't make sense
[1:06:53] sometimes so he said go talk to that man
[1:06:56] so i'll go and talk to him hey my name's
[1:06:57] joseph
[1:06:58] god bless you how are you doing you know
[1:07:00] just go out of your way you remember
[1:07:01] around got on sister media one time
[1:07:02] when they were walking and they he said
[1:07:05] he says hi to the
[1:07:06] sister and he says you didn't say hi to
[1:07:09] the sister
[1:07:09] she said oh i nodded he said peter
[1:07:13] say hi use your word you'll say speak
[1:07:15] acknowledge her right sometimes
[1:07:17] you you would be amazed just
[1:07:19] acknowledging someone
[1:07:20] just acknowledging them their humanity
[1:07:22] that there's somebody there standing
[1:07:24] there start talking to open up a
[1:07:25] conversation
[1:07:26] love will make you reach out love will
[1:07:28] make you look past your own pride your
[1:07:30] own awkwardness your own faith and
[1:07:31] reach out to somebody because maybe that
[1:07:33] person needs jesus christ or maybe the
[1:07:35] lord just wants to test you and see if
[1:07:36] you're willing to do it or not
[1:07:37] you don't know what the reaction is
[1:07:38] going to be you know what's going to
[1:07:39] happen all you know is maybe the lord
[1:07:41] put on your heart
[1:07:42] now you don't have to raise your hands
[1:07:44] but just think back on your life how
[1:07:45] many times maybe
[1:07:46] there was you felt maybe led to say
[1:07:47] something or to reach out or
[1:07:50] and you didn't do it
[1:07:54] help us lord help us to be so in love
[1:07:57] with god
[1:07:58] that we don't worry about ourselves and
[1:08:00] we say all right lord
[1:08:01] let's be about your business lord so i
[1:08:03] went up to this man and just started
[1:08:04] talking to him
[1:08:05] i didn't have any agent i was just
[1:08:06] talking to him i wasn't even thinking
[1:08:08] about it
[1:08:08] and just said oh god bless you how are
[1:08:10] you doing and what's going on and he was
[1:08:11] telling me about the stuff that's going
[1:08:12] around that little area
[1:08:14] and i said are you a christian he said
[1:08:15] yeah i am a christian i said i could
[1:08:17] tell
[1:08:18] and he says we have a little church
[1:08:19] right down here there's a little baptist
[1:08:21] church
[1:08:22] he says it's a prison ministry and all
[1:08:23] he says oh that's good that's good
[1:08:24] jerome
[1:08:25] he says yeah just you know i'm just i'm
[1:08:27] just hungry
[1:08:28] i'm a little hungry and i was like oh i
[1:08:30] got you jerome here you go brother
[1:08:32] and i gave him that money and as soon as
[1:08:34] i gave it to him i knew
[1:08:35] that's who it had been for the whole
[1:08:36] time right
[1:08:38] and it was just a little thing brother
[1:08:39] sister but it showed somebody
[1:08:42] love that's right why would a stranger
[1:08:44] come up to you and give you 21.
[1:08:46] right go out of their way to do it i
[1:08:48] remember i was standing in the
[1:08:49] brothers just little things but you know
[1:08:50] little god works in the little things
[1:08:52] right
[1:08:53] i was i was in a gas station once or it
[1:08:54] was a uh it was a fries it was a grocery
[1:08:58] store
[1:08:58] and we're standing there and there's two
[1:08:59] people in front of us and you could tell
[1:09:00] they're about to go camping they've got
[1:09:01] all their stuff and they're stressing
[1:09:03] out you know sometimes you just go on a
[1:09:04] big trip
[1:09:05] and they're like i heard the wife say
[1:09:06] three times don't forget the ice
[1:09:09] don't forget the ice don't forget the
[1:09:11] eye so what does he do he forgets the
[1:09:12] eyes
[1:09:13] all right and he's standing there in
[1:09:14] front of me he should have seen his
[1:09:15] countenance just dropped like oh man see
[1:09:17] this walk in front
[1:09:18] and i start going up and i say hey just
[1:09:19] go ahead and take the ice i'll pay for
[1:09:21] it
[1:09:22] i'll pay for it and the guy just turned
[1:09:24] around and says what
[1:09:26] it was such a this is just a tiny little
[1:09:29] insignificant but that just the
[1:09:31] thought just a little act show me your
[1:09:34] faith but without you i'll show you my
[1:09:35] faith by my works
[1:09:37] all right just a little tiny thing you
[1:09:38] should've seen it so probably made the
[1:09:40] whole day who knows
[1:09:41] all right you can see they're about to
[1:09:42] get into a fight but maybe it stops
[1:09:44] something who knows
[1:09:45] little things like that and they make a
[1:09:47] bigger difference than you think
[1:09:49] i'm going to tell you a story when i was
[1:09:51] a sinner
[1:09:52] i was a druggie i was a drunk i would do
[1:09:54] anything and everything
[1:09:56] not just to be honest shame the devil
[1:09:57] tell the truth right
[1:09:59] i was a filthy sinner hair down to my
[1:10:01] shoulders and i was a soil plumber
[1:10:03] and i was working with a couple of
[1:10:04] brothers who went to a message church
[1:10:06] and there was this brother
[1:10:07] named martial serrano and this brother's
[1:10:09] wife
[1:10:10] makes the best beans you've ever had in
[1:10:12] your life
[1:10:13] right and he had bean and cheese
[1:10:15] burritos brother and if you man if
[1:10:16] you're a mexican a bean cheese burrito
[1:10:18] that's just gold that's skull right
[1:10:19] there
[1:10:20] and so he he he would come over and what
[1:10:22] he would do he would sneak up on us and
[1:10:23] he would scare us because me and my
[1:10:24] buddy were doing stuff we weren't
[1:10:25] supposed to be doing at the job site
[1:10:27] and so he would come up and scare us
[1:10:28] after death and we freak out and he's
[1:10:30] awesome
[1:10:31] come here come here and he would come
[1:10:32] and he would talk to me
[1:10:35] he would talk to me like a human being
[1:10:38] he wouldn't talk to me like i was dirty
[1:10:39] or i was filthy
[1:10:41] or wasn't worth it and he fed me
[1:10:44] he fed me those little burritos and to
[1:10:46] him it was just a little burrito
[1:10:48] but to me he was showing me something
[1:10:51] that at the time
[1:10:52] i didn't understand what it was but i
[1:10:54] wanted it
[1:10:56] i wanted what he had i didn't understand
[1:10:59] what it was
[1:11:00] and later on i found out what it was it
[1:11:02] was the love of god
[1:11:03] amen reaching down to a sinner
[1:11:06] who wasn't worthy you didn't deserve it
[1:11:09] i didn't get
[1:11:10] it was the grace of god in something
[1:11:12] small
[1:11:13] and simple god hides himself in
[1:11:15] simplicity
[1:11:16] and reveals himself in the same right
[1:11:18] that's god reaching out brother sister
[1:11:20] he uses us who are the hands of god
[1:11:24] who are the feet of god who are the men
[1:11:26] we are the body of jesus christ
[1:11:29] right and we've got to display christ to
[1:11:31] our brothers
[1:11:32] and our sisters to our children to our
[1:11:35] families to our co-workers
[1:11:36] wherever we go whatever we do brother
[1:11:39] sister
[1:11:40] let's show forth the love of jesus
[1:11:43] christ
[1:11:44] this is the hour when the devil is
[1:11:46] fighting too
[1:11:47] thin nail to just bring remember this
[1:11:49] what jesus said
[1:11:50] that the foes your foes would be they of
[1:11:52] your own household
[1:11:55] they have their so how are you going to
[1:11:56] overcome that with the
[1:11:58] love of god right that's why the devil's
[1:12:01] fighting it's so hard to think
[1:12:02] just he's coming so so hard in so many
[1:12:04] different ways he gets his people
[1:12:06] fussing i bet you we sat here me and
[1:12:08] brother isaiah books go back and forth
[1:12:09] and we'd find out 50 things we could
[1:12:11] disagree on
[1:12:12] but it wouldn't matter one bit because
[1:12:13] there's one thing we do early on we both
[1:12:15] love the lord
[1:12:15] amen amen and if you love the like
[1:12:18] brother ram said if if someone says
[1:12:19] jesus christ
[1:12:20] on a god i'll fellowship around that
[1:12:22] right and if you've got love for
[1:12:22] somebody
[1:12:23] it'll look past all the differences
[1:12:26] right brother brother brother branham
[1:12:27] used to go and visit her brother
[1:12:29] all the time baptized in the name of
[1:12:31] father son and holy ghost
[1:12:32] and he kept visiting kept busy kept
[1:12:34] visiting it was brother joseph jose
[1:12:36] he said one of the hardest guys he ever
[1:12:37] got to convert from father son and holy
[1:12:39] ghost
[1:12:40] but they fellowshipped all the time they
[1:12:42] loved to go together they left to be
[1:12:43] with one another right
[1:12:44] they loved one another they had
[1:12:46] differences but the differences didn't
[1:12:48] matter when the love of god there filled
[1:12:49] all the gaps
[1:12:51] right and he said it took me forever but
[1:12:53] he finally won him over
[1:12:55] imagine if he'd had the kind of spirit
[1:12:56] something that some of us message
[1:12:57] preachers have
[1:13:00] that kind of spirit oh that brother
[1:13:01] don't see him you know i don't know
[1:13:02] about that he must be foolish
[1:13:04] oh that's i don't know who's wise or
[1:13:07] who's foolish but to me anyone who calls
[1:13:08] somebody's foolish sounds pretty foolish
[1:13:10] to me
[1:13:12] because you don't know and i don't know
[1:13:13] nobody knows except god
[1:13:15] right i believe i'm the bride of jesus
[1:13:17] christ that's where that's where i stand
[1:13:19] but i'm not here but like who is who is
[1:13:21] it because you don't know and nobody
[1:13:23] knows and if they say they know then
[1:13:24] brother sister beware false prophets
[1:13:26] try to eat the spirits right that's why
[1:13:28] we're here and the love of god will give
[1:13:30] you something on the inside that will
[1:13:31] warn you
[1:13:32] right because it is the spirit of truth
[1:13:34] right it's the spirit of truth and it'll
[1:13:37] open up your eyes and you'll see
[1:13:38] man if this is causing division because
[1:13:40] brother sister there is going to be a
[1:13:42] pulling away we know that
[1:13:44] but the bride doesn't pull away from the
[1:13:46] shuck the shuck pulls away from the
[1:13:48] wheat
[1:13:49] they went out of us for they went from
[1:13:51] us because they weren't of us but sister
[1:13:53] we don't push nobody away
[1:13:54] right you love as much as you can and
[1:13:56] that they can't stand it
[1:13:57] they'll pull away on their own and it
[1:14:00] causes heart aches and sorrows
[1:14:02] but i'm here because i love him
[1:14:06] i'm not here because i love anybody else
[1:14:07] i love everybody else but i'm not here
[1:14:09] because i love everybody else
[1:14:11] i'm here because i love god right and if
[1:14:14] i love god then i love everybody else
[1:14:16] right he says you're gonna write this
[1:14:17] you get it right this way but you can't
[1:14:19] have it right this way if you're not
[1:14:21] trying to get it right this way
[1:14:22] right so he said i will not forgive you
[1:14:26] until you forgive others that's that
[1:14:29] scripture i base that song on
[1:14:31] right forgive others what makes you
[1:14:35] forgive others
[1:14:36] you have love for them because what
[1:14:39] saved you from your sin
[1:14:40] and your filthiness and your
[1:14:42] unrighteousness and your failures and
[1:14:44] your mistakes
[1:14:45] and your sins and your iniquities it was
[1:14:47] love that reached down to you
[1:14:49] and it's love that'll take you all the
[1:14:51] way so how can we
[1:14:53] do anything less when it comes to our
[1:14:56] brothers and our sisters
[1:14:58] right and like the end of that song says
[1:15:00] your own
[1:15:01] self because we got to remember god did
[1:15:04] say
[1:15:05] love your enemies and you are your own
[1:15:08] worst enemy but you remember
[1:15:10] god loved you remember and he didn't
[1:15:12] love you at your best
[1:15:14] he loved you at your worst
[1:15:17] he loved you at your worst
[1:15:20] that's what he died he didn't die for
[1:15:21] you at your best he died for you
[1:15:23] at your most sinful right
[1:15:27] love does that loves the thing that
[1:15:29] reaches down like
[1:15:30] loves what makes you look at a brother
[1:15:32] or a sister and not say i don't think
[1:15:34] because a lot of people looked at me but
[1:15:37] i looked like that
[1:15:38] and they wrote me off but a few people
[1:15:41] looked at me with love
[1:15:43] and they said god can do anything and he
[1:15:45] did
[1:15:46] and when god can do anything because of
[1:15:48] love and sister then you'll go forth
[1:15:50] with that love
[1:15:50] willing to do anything all right when
[1:15:52] you see it happen
[1:15:54] when you see it manifest in your life
[1:15:56] when you see that love
[1:15:57] rise up and stop you i there was this
[1:15:59] one time
[1:16:01] i used to i used to live in phoenix and
[1:16:03] i don't know if you ever been to phoenix

[1:17:43] part of me
[1:17:44] was getting ready to punch this man i'm
[1:17:46] not gonna lie the human part of me was
[1:17:48] getting ready to punch
[1:17:49] and then something spoke out of me
[1:17:53] and said i'm sorry i cut you off
[1:17:56] i'm sorry i'm sorry i cut you off and
[1:17:59] the man literally
[1:18:00] choked on his words he was like
[1:18:08] and he got in his car and he drove away
[1:18:11] and i was standing there
[1:18:13] and i was like thank you

[1:18:19] was the love of god that came down and

[1:18:24] grace of god brother sister that came
[1:18:25] down and just showed
