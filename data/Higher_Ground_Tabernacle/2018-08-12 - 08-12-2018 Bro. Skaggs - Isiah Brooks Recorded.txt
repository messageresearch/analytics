TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh say he can battle he can fight but when you come to know who you are no devil can stand against you they're doing their job and they supposed to do their job but they lose us lose us that's what I'm saying somebody better say Amen that's the way I see it and you know what this joy that I have the world didn't give it to me and the world came take it away come brother I want to sing that song but I can't even I'm going to enjoy the word this morning [Applause] I think the song leader is you don't want to do with me because I turn it off I turn it on and turn it off and God bless you all it's good to see the brothers here today very funny you look better than you did yesterday you know I I've always heard that the older you get you kind of start looking a little less pretty but that's not true with you guys I see the brother here he looks very fine you look very fine brother god bless you sir I see a lady back there sister Shekinah she brings back a memory for me as I remember the last time I was here that brother Troy had preached a message in well that's first and only time I've ever heard brother Troy preach and I I don't mean it any bad way but this is just the way it was brother toys not a very good preacher he kind of stumbles around he may be different now but this was back then telling quiet can't hardly hear him I thought what on earth yeah Wow but the presence of the Lord came and brother Brooks asked me if I had something to say and I said yes and I said at the presence the Lord was there and I said if you want that presence you can have it and it nobody move nobody said anything you remember that note yet and nobody moved nobody said anything well I think the song she sung about being patient I need to do that because I'm not very patient so I said to myself I said I'm going to say it one more time and if if nobody comes to get that I'm walking out that's I that's what I did that's just what I said in myself and I said the presence of the Lord is here if you want it come and get it and nobody moved so of course the pulpit was right over there that diamond I just turned to walk off and as I turned to walk off just as she kind of come walking up here she's a little smaller then and she said I leaned down she whispered so quiet I could barely hear I gotta listen close and she said I don't think I have what you're talking about is that what you said sister's going something like that she said I want it I said well go over there and that's a little bit close to where you're at now it was up a little bit I said go over there and start praying that what you did and I told brother Troy but the toy you go over with her because I want you to realize what it is when a child receives the Holy Ghost and he began to pray the devil begin to fight and he fought but she prayed and she kept praying and I watched the Spirit of the Lord come down and they go back up and then I come down and then go back up and then all of a sudden sisters she kind of started praying she really started praying and the spirit the Lord came to her and he hit brother Troy and brother Brooks remembers his whole body was just shaken he couldn't control himself he'd just shake it and it was wonderful it was wonderful and I remember that from time to time when I tell quite a few places I go about your son yeah that's the son very nice they watched him that night and this is what happened this picture the brother Brooks put back up I believe it's the same one that was there then this pillar of fire came off for this picture and it went down and it went right on top of that boy he was a little smaller too and when it did he just went forward right over the seat dinya and I watched I said oh my and then that pillar fire came back up up and came right back up for the picture and so I walked back down and I said to the brother I said can I speak to your son he said yes and I said to him I said you see that pillar fire there he said yes I said that came down and went on top of you and he just went right over the seat again so I like those memories now what's the devil done since then but what has God done since their God is in control we'd like to take a scripture reading tonight from the book of st. mark thank you for playing the instruments thank you for the song that was very wonderful it always amazes me how that God can tell a little lady like that sing this song and she sings it and it's just right it's just right I don't that's amazing we want to turn to chapter 11 of Saint Mark do we need an interpreter tonight no we don't need an interpreter you guys speak English better than me probably do I'm not a very good speaker this brother looked at me like I know so st. mark chapter 11 verse 22 is where we want to begin reading tonight this is where G had cursed the fig tree and had a withered from the roots up and Peter was amazed at that and he said Wow remember that Jesus Jesus yeah I remember and Jesus verse 22 answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have aught against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses you may be seated a couple years I was called to a hospital where a lady lay dying she was on life support she was in a coma she had no hope of living and the daughter asked me to come and pray for the mother and I did and the Lord raised her up and so the daughter came and asked me to go speak to her one week later she was out of off life support out of the coma very coherent the disease that they had diagnosed the with sclerosis of the liver was gone and she was going to be sent home and so I went to speak to this lady a German lady and as I began to speak to her she had told me that she knew she was going to heaven based on a dream that she had had and I said well that's that's very good and as we talked a little bit I seen right in the middle of her chest a little something about that big I thought the doctors had put it there looked like a little computer or something and it was flashing and it was flashing one word da D Dada I thought well that's a strange little computer that the doctors put on this lady and I kept looking at I thought what is that thing all of a sudden he disappeared I thought oh so I said to her I said is your father still alive and she began to curse and said I hate that man I said oh why he said she this lady told me that when she was six years old her father tried to rape her three times her mother actually dragged her father off of her and then again when she was eight and nine years old and she said I will never forgive him for that but first I asked her if she had forgive him and she said I cannot and I will not forgive him for that and I said ma'am I said I'm sorry to tell you this but you're not going to heaven she said why not I said because Jesus said if you don't forgive those who have sinned against you God won't forgive you and she was laying in the bed and I was on this side of her and she turned her head like this wouldn't even look at me very probably five minutes I never said a word I just sat there I was praying I said lord I don't know what to do I don't know what to say I don't that's the Word of God I can't in awe but finally she turned and she looked at me and she said does it really say that I said yes and she turned her head back again away from me for a little bit longer and then I felt the presence of the Lord come that change did and she turned her head back and she looked at me tears running down her face and she said will you help me I said I can't but I know who can I said why don't you take this hurt that your father gave to you and you give it to Jesus and she said all right and so we prayed she gave it to him in three months later they had indeed sent her home she was well she was fine she went to bed one night and never woke up the next morning this time she went to heaven why because it was one thing did her father deserve forgiveness no but it doesn't say forgive him if they deserve it he said forgive them I think in my life and I will tell a pretty personal thing that happened to me when I was growing up we was raised in a message church I was I have seven brothers and sisters and if mom come for supper you went to supper and it didn't matter what they had you ate it it was beans and potatoes that's all it was so because those seven other people won't take your abortion if you didn't give it to if you didn't eat yours and so very poor and the church we was in was very strict very very hard it was to the point that if your hair touched your forehead you got in trouble you had to wear a yellow patch on your shirt you couldn't talk to nobody for two weeks nobody could talk to you for two weeks if you hair went down on your forehead cause mine's getting where it don't go down anywhere but and so I I thought growing up in that church that that little yellow patch on your shirt was part of your clothes because I wore it all the time and so in the school that they had they had a room and it was four foot square 6 foot tall it was painted black and if you got in so much trouble you got locked in that room for three days I was in that room for six months it wasn't fun and so one day at school of course like I said I little yellow piece of cloth that was on my shirt one day at school I did something and the teacher got angry with me and if you if you got in so much trouble at school the teacher would write on your paper what you did and you had to take it home to your parents and your parents had to punish you and write the punishment on the piece of paper and you took it back to the teacher now this was Christian teachers it was a Christian school run by the church and so I got in trouble of course I was in we called it the dark room I was already in the dark room and and so I took my piece of paper home that told what I had done the teacher lied that's that's all it is the teacher lied and said I did something I didn't do and my I give my paper to my dad you know I was 15 years old and my dad read the paper and he looked at me and he said why did you do this I said I didn't do it he said yeah you did I said well I didn't do it he said those teachers don't lie so they got the Holy Ghost I said all right of course I had to go cut my switch you know and whoever had to cut your switch we all had to I think at one time you didn't bring no little one back in you didn't want your dad going cutting a switch and so I went and cut my switch years old you know I thought I stuff I said in my mind I said whatever my dad does to me I'm not going to cry I don't care what he does I'm not going to cry at stuff I was dumb I should have cried with all I had and so my dad take your shirt off it took my shirt off and he hit me three times at that switch and it hurt but I wasn't going cry and so I turned around I looked at him I thought he was done and I said are you done well he took it to me and I was being a smart aleck I wasn't but that's the way it was took he said no I'm not so he proceeded to beat me until my back was wide open blood flying everywhere my older brother came in and punched him in the jaw knocked him off I mean in him and my dad was fighting - my other brothers grabbed me and dragged me out of there to the bathroom and washed my back out and puts I've on it fixed me up once they got done I heard my brother in there still fighting with my dad my mom screaming you know and trying to break it up and I said something I shouldn't have said I looked at my brothers and I said I'll kill that man for this they said we'll help you this is a message people this isn't a message Church I never did it I never killed him and I'm thankful I never very thankful that he died a couple years ago brain aneurysm but I struggled with that my whole life I thought I'd forgive him I thought that you know hey we patched things up we got along pretty good but yet something in me was hurt something in me didn't want to let that go one day I I found myself starting to correct my children the way my father corrected me in the very way that I said I would kill him for I found that in me I'd done some quick repentance I had to you because what I didn't forgive I turned into you that's exactly what happens I had to find out in my heart where I was wrong not where he was wrong where I was wrong and so I went to God I said God I am sorry to see my own children look at me and be afraid of me but that's what they did they were afraid of me like I had been afraid of my dad I said God please forgive me and I by God's grace forgave my dad and that thing left me I didn't go ask my dad for him to forgive me it wasn't that way I had to forgive him regardless had nothing to do with if he asked me to forgive him it had to do with my heart and that's it nobody else stands before God but you being this brother don't stand together you and your life you and your husband not your husband dear friends but when I finally faced in my heart what I had to forgive it set me free it's that mean for you I wasn't bound by that anymore and I think that just before the communion service is to be taken tonight we always look and see if I have offended somebody I think in my mind have I thought the scriptures say Terry one for another have I offended you have I offended you have I offended you have I offended whoever perhaps we should turn it around and ask have i forgiven you for offending me have i forgiven you for offending me brother Adam said that faith is based on forgiveness where in my heart in my heart in your heart in your heart and each one of your heart each person that is here tonight is there some unforgiveness something that maybe you've forgiven them but there's just a little bit of a not sure I really wish they wouldn't have done that right that really bothers me when they do that or can you do that and you forgive when they haven't asked you to forgive that's hard to do can you forgive when they keep doing it that's really hard to do let it stand or feet forgiveness it seemed like it should be so easy but it's about them it seems like we should be able to just do like Jesus did on the cross and say Father forgive them but remember it was the things that he was asking them to be forgiven of that had broke his heart in Gethsemane that broke his heart it wasn't the nail scars it wasn't the nails and the whips it was what you and I did as we bow our heads or Jesus as we are approaching the communion we are approaching the order Lord taking the bread and the wine that you gave for us to take and we feel this great serious charge in our heart and a great question from God above can you forgive those who have sinned against you can you forgive those who have hurt you the most give those who will continue to hurt you the most if we can we are set free if we can't we are bound by that or God may we as Paul said Terry for just a little bit and search our hearts and see if there's some bitter thing that has crept in and we just can't let it go it seems Lord that roads have been chosen it seems the choices have been made and it it seems that no way can it be turned around and Lord if it is you that is leading we don't want it turned around but we asked Lord before we take this road and we've chosen to go that we be clear in our heart that there is no unforgiveness in us that God we can walk down this road knowing that the things of the past are in the past and in the sea of God's forgetfulness that there is nothing that would hinder us from doing your will we ask this Lord in Jesus name Amen as we wait just a few moments for the Holy Spirit to look into your heart to each heart that's here in mind in yours and in the sister that sang in the musicians in the brother that was set free today in in these godly men and our brother and the older the younger the pastor the song leader every heart if you would allow God to look into it just a little bit what would he see there's two people that would know what's there that's you and God you know that no yeah there's sense hiding it now is it if it's there it'll come out no matter what it is and if you find an unforgiveness whether it be very small or very big will you ask God to take that from you sometimes it feels good to hold on to that sometimes we think it gives us strength to do things that we don't want to do because we feel like that person deserves to be hurt and they do but so do i but if you are willing to let God take that from you would you just raise your hand to him and say God I found something in me that I can't let go I want to hold on to this I don't want that person to be forgiven I want them to pay for what they did to me and by raising my hand to you God I commit it to you and I ask you to take it from my heart let us pray Jesus is a great rejoicing because hearts have been set free Lord every hand that raised every heart that looked up and said God I need you your forgiveness has reached down into that heart and it is to be remembered no more they are set free before your throne and we thank you for that Lord we thank you for that and God whatever road we go down from this day forth may we always remember this day that I forgave by God's grace I forgave the one who hurt me I forgave the one who tried to drive me down as you Oh God has forgiven me let it be Lord that that unforgiving place will be filled with love that when I see this one I can go my arms around them and love them with all that's in me though the road I choose to walk leads me away may be with a free heart and a clear conscience in Jesus name we pray amen let's sing that song he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the brothers know it whoever knows it is fine to sing the song because that's why he was wounded that's why he was bruised for my iniquity what is iniquity when I know to do good and I don't do it anyway he was wounded from my iniquity he I don't know give me a key there I'm sorry I might have to have the brother started he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity surely Bowl all our [Music] and by His stripes we are healed let's singing again let's raise our hands to it now he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities [Music] surely he bore all our sorrow and by His stripes we are healed let's sing

the Lord and I'm so glad he made me the way he's made me Amen I thank God for His grace and His mercy and you know God has been good so so good to us amen all I can say is thank you Jesus thank you thank you thank you amen you know it's time for communion I love communion I didn't announce it I was brought to my attention that we didn't have it last week and of course we didn't I wasn't here I loved community it's a wonderful thing when your heart is clean it's something that we have to guard all the time every day sometimes some things slip through a crack then the Holy Spirit shines the light down in there and you confess it and get rid of it there's nothing like being washed by the word is that right the Holy Ghost gets in there and you know find all those little secret chambers is that Alright sometimes sometimes you don't even know you have had an author you don't even know that you've got a problem with somebody until something comes up yeah I like to be exposed I like the devil and me to be exposed if I'm housing a devil I want him to be exposed I don't like demons living in me because I wasn't born for a demon to live in me I am the temple in the house of God that's all I want in me is God sometimes we get a squat on the owner on the land and the Holy Ghost comes and gotta kick him off I love the Word of God I am a happy man I have a great joy on the inside of my soul every one of us should is that right one of those things I always stuck devil said well see yeah you got got your crime but I tell him I said weeping me and do it for a night but joy income in the morning joy comes in the morning amen but right now there's sunshine in my soul amen yes oh yeah not at you in S Oh in shining my soul I love the word I love the word more now than I ever loved it that's that song say you keep falling in love with him over and over again as we stand we'll get right into the scripture he left on awning up here and I'm just a preacher that's all I can say I love forgiveness as the brother said you know it's not always easy but you can't have until you asked for I'd like to forgive sometimes things are difficult to forgive I've had my struggles throughout my Christian years many times I said I forgive I forgive it then her name is mentioned or presence is seen then I feel that funny feeling and every time I feel that would feel that feeling I'm like Nord is still there keep praying and keep asking God because he know how deep the thing has sankt into your soul or your spirit and he's the only one that can wash your spirit huh I depend upon him to wash and clean me because I can't do it myself but one thing about me I'm alive I'm a man like David I will acknowledge my transgressions if I know I've done wrong I will say I'm sorry if I've offended on and I don't know it or you've been offended by me then you are obligated to tell me because there's no way that I would have in you and not make it right so I think God for its mercy and I thank God for its grace you know and like I said I have offended people at times not even knowing it by saying the wrong word or gesturing and joking which is not convenient sometimes my actions may have a pick you don't know it and it's okay we all have times where we are offended or people offending and sometimes we think they know they know or they all don't know but sometimes they just don't that's why the Bible said if you've been offended off a brother of affinity and you go to him they come to you as we stand we to read coming from 1st Corinthians 2:11 chapter first Corinthians the eleventh chapter I so love God I love my people I love my children I love my lord I love my wife and I love all of you come on love you if you don't love me I can't help it I'm loved been born of all have you been born of love amen love conquers everything that's why the devil wants you to have it cuz he knows he came he came fight loving and win love will conquer every thing ah let us read and when he had given thanks he brake in and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this too and remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drinking and remembrance with me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you D show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup but he that that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body but this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep you know what that mean when you don't make it right and you take the cup anyway but it's so simple just saying Lord forgive me and if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord hallelujah that we should not be condemned with the world well for my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest I was set in order when I come let's have a word of Prayer I'll dear Heavenly Father we do thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us my god you have been better to me and better to us and we have been to ourselves what a glorious day you have wrought you've been such a awesome God and there's none like you never will be none before you and none after you we celebrate this time of your death burial resurrection by the breaking of bread and the pouring of why knowing that this is not your literal body but it is symbolic of your shedded blood of Calvary and your broken body but with your stripes we are healed father in ourselves we're not worthy to be a part of this but you made us worthy Lord we're here Lord not only to this commune one another to commemorate what you've done to thank you Lord God for what you've done it's beyond our understanding how our God so great could come down so long and sacrifice his life for such a sinner such as I bless Lord this service those who are participating let them know that he the Son and free is free indeed and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty there's no condemnation to those who walk around after the flesh but after the spirit father we thank you for being just that our Father we love you tonight Lord we in honor come to take this communion forgive us Lord if there be anything in our lives that's not we have done that wasn't pleasing in your sight cleanse us from all our iniquities Lord because we are wrong and you are right only way we can ever be righteous is that the righteous God be in us bless us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music] for those who are participating you can come forward as for the Keith would you help [Music] [Music] [Music] and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do we remember this of me let us eat after the same manner he also took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do to ye as often as she drink it in remembrance of me [Music] [Music] the so be Christ or the master call to be their hearts desire we're a fish thus he says I the hungry every time whoa command I the master Colin Amanda whoa Baby Jesus came all the time Holly little healed the multitude turn the water into wine to the homie called Amanda soon the land will tick is to be ever that is all the host of heaven with [Music] the Laureus [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] one of these old days and I don't know how he's gonna do it but we'll be sitting at a table I got my name on my chair Amy you know it's amazing what God is doing just to feel the presence of the Lord knows that there's more of it [Music] it's been a blessed weekend we're gonna now have my feet washing I wanted to say something about that picture cuz you said something yeah we gonna do that it was the only place there because okay the other picture was there it had a nail on it and that was we just haven't had a chance but I agree with you so anyway this picture here when we were no I'm sorry it wasn't this one it was a cloud when we were young in the message and brother in a consultant on was preaching he would not come down off the cross in the midst of the service the pillar fire began to move and that that cloud began it came off of the picture we got pictures of it we literally got pictures where lambs were formed and came off people were healed all kinds of things were happening back in that day but you know what we just believed we didn't have all those intellectual stuff we just needed that God did it right supernatural signs and things were happening all the time why we didn't complicate it we didn't believe it we knew that Christ could do it in Christ did it that's back in the day we would see people seeing angels and everything real manifestation of the supernatural and that day is still today you know I just know by God's grace you know that that God getting ready to do something went right in between right there - coming it ain't no three minutes no more just that time now I just want to encourage everybody we've taken communion but I want to encourage you because I want you to know why why is he doing it now all over the world everywhere I go battles like you've never seen before because he knows you just got that moment right now folks it ain't time to do nothing but get the Holy Ghost make sure you got it and you know like like the brother said I love the Lord and I learned something about receiving the Holy Ghost I learned that you know I I myself have been so used to prevailing what is the real revelation about travailing learning how to yield you travailing to yield not to scream and holler but you you know whatever it takes I don't know what makes you but learning how to yield is that right God is identified and when you surrender all of your heart he will come in that's just how simple he comes but anyway we saw the people of being filled and healed and I'm so glad to know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he has a God that changes not people do not let nobody change this message for you Christ is to say and like the brother said without Christ you have nothing even the prophet of God said that you know he sympathize with people who sympathize with the message right that ain't here you got to have the Holy Ghost Paul said it to understand all mysteries and have not love it profits you nothing you love the Lord we're gonna do our feet washing like we normally do sisters in the best rib you and brothers here and then where we can be [Music]
