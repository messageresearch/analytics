TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so we thank God for his grace amen God is surely good to us amen we're not going to prolong the time we're just going to get right into the word of God you can stand by the grace of God we appreciate uh God for being so good to us we like to uh preach a a message on uh the word Shalom uh brother bandam preached that message Shalom and his peace to the bride but I'm just going to take it from a different angle um by the grace of God and um we like to give a theme to it the battle is the Lords if we could turn by the grace of God to uh second Thessalonians please second Thessalonians second Thessalonians we going to be reading uh from the second chapter and we'll begin reading at the seventh verse for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now leth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall thy Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and Lon wonders with all deceiving thisness of righteousness in them that perish because they believe or receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God shall send them strong Del illusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but have pleasure in un righteousness but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God ha from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth where unto he called you by Our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ therefore Brethren stand stand fast and hold the tradition which ye have been taught whether by word or our epistle now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God even Our Father which have loved us and have given us everlasting consolation and Good Hope through Grace Comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work is that all right amen first Peter please first Peter the 5th chapter we'll begin reading at the six verse humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that ye may that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he carth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roar lion walth about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same Affliction are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who have called us unto eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect amen establish strengthen settle you to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen you may be seated we really appreciate the Lord and all that he does for us we realize that without him we are nothing I am grateful because I realize tonight that if any of us from the pull pit to the back of the door make a Rapture it'll be by the grace of God because he loved us before the foundation of the world when I was studying I was thinking about all that God had done I I just love the message that God brought on Sunday because of his blood I have been just bathing in those thoughts seeing all of the promises and the Freedom that God has given to his bride we who are failures to begin with should be able to really appreciate God for all that he has done for us words cannot express our gratitude tonight knowing how faulty we can all be sometime and knowing that he loved us so much that he gave his life for us now if you turn with me to second Thessalonians again please the third chapter I love the way God slips in words of encouragement in the word and how he tries to build our confidence in his word because remember now the great fall came by way of Eve losing confidence in God's word and once you lose confidence in God's word you must realize that Satan can come alone and dup you he is more than able to convince you of his thoughts and to let you know amen that his thoughts are so-called right but whoever whatever you exalt above the word of God it becomes God to you and you then becomes an idol worshipper but listen to uh 2 Thessalonians 3 beginning at the third verse it said but the Lord is faithful who shall establish you now we just read said that uh just a moment ago how we must go through our trials where God is going to take us through them to establish us and often time we say God I I want to make a Rapture but we must realize you got to suffer the get there God must send us through the fire but in all of this he still wants us to be at peace because when you trust God it brings a peace amen and the Bible said if we just only keep our minds stayed on him not at the storm not at the waves not at the anything that's occurring in your life means nothing right now am your main focus should be on a Rapture amen being transformed translated amen uh into the image of Christ is what our focus should be on amen God said so is that right seek ye first the kingdom of God or heaven and all of these other things will be added to us let us not allow Satan to uh how can I say it how let us not allow Satan to bring the word down to earth the word is above all it is God second Thessalonians second Thessalonians the 3r chapter the third verse says but the Lord is faithful who shall establish you and keep you from evil and we have confidence in the Lord touching you that ye both do and will do the things which we command you and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christen now Paul says I have confidence I believe and I have confidence that you're going to do what you're supposed to do now we realize amen that in all that we got we have to do God is the one that is directing us they that are led by the spirit of God they are they are the sons of God I'm going go through a lot of scriptures tonight that's why I'm taking my time here amen let us turn right now to Ephesians 6 please you love the Lord we're going to read Ephesians the 6th chapter uh at the sixth chapter there and we're going to start at the 10th verse we have heard this scripture many times but by the grace of God we're we we're coming to a point where we can where you can really uh understand exactly where I'm coming from because let me say like this there is only two forces in the world one is of God and one is of Satan you and I don't have nothing and whatever power we have it be of Satan or of God one is of Life the other one is of death and the Bible say choose you this day who you going to serve so we realize by the grace of God there's only really two rulers I don't care how great uh these uh dictators are presidents or popes I don't care how great they think they are they are just absolutely uh subject to a higher power amen something that is greater than they and they fail to realize amen that their ruler one day will be brought down to the pits of Hell amen so we realize that they're being ruled is that right we we'll see that in just a moment Ephesians uh 6 beginning at the 10th verse it says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of your might in the power of His might right there is no other way that we're going to be strong and powerful except It Be by way of the Holy Ghost put on the whole arm of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil amen for we Ral not against against flesh and blood but but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and I really believe that a lot of Christians forget that on a daily basis Lord that our adversary is the Unseen amen it is not that which you see it is unseen spiritual wickedness in high places and understand when Satan comes after you in any way there's a devil behind the mask you hear what I'm saying so you address the devil not the maskk right because you got to realize that this whole battle and don't get upset when people don't like you because you are a Christian they're not supposed to like you you must realize that this thing started in heaven and it came down to earth is that right now I want you to understand this whole thing is about who is God Amen or who God is however you want to put it this whole thing that we're now seeing is about Satan in his life because had not Eli the world as we know it would be different but Satan a man thought within himself that he would be God or like the most high and because of that we have now we we know there's only one true God but Satan have deceive the world that he is God and brother brandham said it like this it it is has it has been such a deception that in reality or figuratively he is the God of this evil world he is the ruler of Obama of Putin the pope he is their God if their God is not the Lord Jesus Christ their God is Satan now the Bible said put on the whole armor of God that means amen there's something to put on Amen you can't be a Christian and don't think that there's something to put on right wherefore take on you the whole arm of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore amen having your loins gir about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness now you must understand he says listen you cover your weaknesses with truth amen right everybody in here got a weakness physically I don't care how many exercises you do I can come and punch you in your stomach and you GNA feel it because right in that area is a weakness God didn't put no bones there right so you must understand that every one of us have a weakness somewhere but it is fortified is is not a weakness if it's fortified by the word amen amen right and it says girled the LA with truth is that right you and I must realize amen that the Bible is instructing us on how to defeat the Devil amen having on the breastplate of righteousness why because that that that plate is covering your heart right that word is covering your heart so when a devil aim at your heart to hit your heart there's a breast plate there right amen so you and I must recognize by the grace of God that when God is doing something when he equips us as the scripture says and as brother VanDam said he could not have given us a greater weapon outside of his word amen amen now let me move on by the grace of God so you said well brother where are why are you saying all of these things I I want you to recognize that the battle has already been thought and the Victory is already won amen that's what my Bible says now we might be journeying through time but God has already won the battle the end the Bible tells us that the devil was defeated he was thrown into the Lake of Fire all of the Demons were the bride stood in a Holiness Hallelujah the foolish came up H come on somebody I mean it's already done not one word in his in this book can be altered we're worried about whether we're going to make a Rapture and God was so sweet and kind to us he sent the prophet of God beyond the curtain of time Amen to tell us I saw you there and he knew that the bride would pick that up now some people might wonder am I there I don't know whether you're there but I know I am I can't explain it but I know that when the prophet was about to go off the scene God had the prophet to preach a message Shalom that means peace don't you worry I'm going to take care of this thing is that right he sold it in tight with Ruth and Boaz come on when Ruth laid down at boaz's feet amen he got up he said my he said you are we've heard your testimonies we I know you are a virtuous woman but you you beyond anything I imagine he said you just go on and be at peace because I'm going to take care of the rest amen when you laid down before your Boaz Jesus Christ when you surrendered your life to him amen he made a promise to you by the word don't you worry about it I'll take care of the rest and and he's doing that the battle that we're speaking on tonight started in heaven since the beginning of time and we are now a at the at the world are under the devil's thought the world the world as now is under the devil's thoughts you have heard me say that before there was no other thought outside of God's thought Lucifer thought outside of God's thoughts and therefore he was the cause of this known chaos is that right he thought right he thought God dwelt in Beauty that's what brother Ram said he actually thought that God dwelt in Beauty so he exalted himself in worldly Beauty even in heaven he did it on Earth with Cain and God rejected it amen he has done it with the church world today and go and and they don't have no idea that these mega churches all of this stuff that they're doing that seem to be so beautiful to the natural eye is nonsense with God God is already rejected it if he doesn't reject that beauty he'll have to raise up Cain and apologize right amen because Cain worked much harder according to brother brandom Cain worked much harder amen than Abel amen so don't get discouraged when you see the denominations and organization making us look like we're lazy we got a lamb we we don't have to to Earth we don't have to taller Earth come on somebody we got a lamb right so you know they they they they have been predestinated to labor in such a way and yet they will be rejected hallelujah what we fail to see is that God has always been fighting the battles for us amen thank you Lord hey somebody amen huh because he is the judge of all things we can see it through Abraham all of the mistakes that Abraham made God said and declare it was not so amen come on somebody but the devil can say well I was there when he did it and God can say who going to lay in the charge the gods he see we got to realize amen we have been we are sitting in such a place Satan don't want you to see he don't want you to see the reality of your freedom because he knows if you if you see and can really see it your love for God will overwhelm you and you will never you will never think to do evil amen come on somebody but often times Satan gets us to believe that God does not love us in the way that he says he does is that okay now we realize by the grace of God As I said God this is a religious War battle of the churches is what I thought because that's what it was now Abel didn't know he was going to he was getting ready to uh be uh get into a battle but his brother was jealous of him now every denominational Christian that see you living the way you do will automatically become jealous and when they become jealous they become critical all of that is not necessary come on somebody why you know my wife and I was talking I said only the elect of God will ever assemble themselves in a place like this because Satan has their minds Christians a lot of so-called Christians believe you have to have a multitude of people you've got to have a big choir and you got to have all of this pump and what more amen because you're blessed see and what a delusion what an delusion that Satan has placed in their minds because it is exactly what what Satan did in the beginning thinking God was going to accept Beauty over his word God don't care nothing about no Beauty amen he's the maker and creator of all things and we look at this thing and I want you to know amen that God is fighting your battles right now right now I I was thinking about some prayers I said Lord don't you know God comes along and answer people's prayers it might take a few years down the road he answered them and they miss it they literally miss it you know you almost need a prayer Journal so that when God is that right brother B had a a dream and a prophecy journal A Prayer Journal is really something good to have so when God answer your prayer you can say here it is amen God answered this prayer I prayed it three years ago but he answered it see we look at this thing and you and I must understand that God fights for you Exodus 14:14 the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace amen and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore CEST thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward that's what I'm saying tonight hold your peace amen God is fighting for you amen but he's expecting you to go forward amen not to stand still amen go forward oh God this is happening I don't know what's going to happen to me go forward why are you crying oh my God is going before you the Bible said he goes before you and he's behind you Hallelujah come on somebody listen in the message ex uh uh the revelation of Jesus Christ listen what brother brandom said and I just pulled a little piece of the quote out he says Satan is in the carnal mind and Satan is exposed and Satan does not want himself exposed so what is he saying to have a carnal mind is to have Satan in your mind amen hello you don't want Satan in your mind come on the Bible says let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus I don't want his mind I don't want Satan's mind I want God's mind Hallelujah turn with me to Daniel please Daniel 12 all Heaven is backing you the whole thing is amen we realize tonight amen that Satan amen these battles that we having you gotta you got to amen this one if you're not having mind battles right now you're dead y'all know what I'm saying I mean the battles have been so great lately I mean it's almost and you know I got to find that that message I was listening to several messages today and brother Brana was talking about the storms and you know he began to say the Revival was over he was telling somebody the Revival is over he was saying the Revival is over he said because Lord he said I'm having a rough time keeping the victories it was he said it so fast I said what so my point is that was in 19 might have been I don't know 60 something when he said it because I was looking to 64 from 63 to 65 so if the prophet was having mind battles and a fight on his hand then what about you what about us and he said now the Revival is over that's what he was saying the re rival is over for the United States y'all know what I'm saying now that's in the 60s where is the anointing now what is it many of us amen we're fighting this thing and we're moving forward we're slugging along but somehow the battles in our minds is just pulling us you know am I the only one but you got to realize amen he said don't worry I got it all under control amen you see God didn't put us in this age to see us fail it is written we are conquerors more than conquerors Hallelujah now there is no other way God cont test you is through the battles in your mind let me read Daniel first starting at the first verse and at that time M shall Michael stand up the great Prince which standed for the children of the people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to the same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contemp and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn to to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever but thou oh Daniel shut up the words seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall increase is that right brother ROM say what day was that that was this day this day now that the book has been open the mystery of iniquity is no longer a mystery am to the Bride of Jesus Amen and what is Iniquity to know to do good and do it is not so we look at these people and they say well they don't know the Bible call it iniquity he was talking about the Pentecostals he said the Pentecostal taught that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues he said they know it's wrong but they went too far with it to turn back huh so does the trinitarians they know it's not according to the word but if they go back and repent they'll lose everything see it is Iniquity they have been engaged because they saw the truth and because they did not have a love for the truth God gave them over to a strong delusion to believe a lie but they once knew the truth brother bam said before you can ever go in error you must first deny the truth is that all right amen now here the word of God came in the B message the greatest battle ever fought he said when the great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that Battleground begins in the human mind there is where the battle started the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was it it began and that is because that decision ision are made from the mind the head now they never started it from some mechanical Affair the grounds never started there therefore the organizations can never never do the work of God because the Battlegrounds where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind Hallelujah you've got to make your choice it will meet you amen so you say well what do you mean brother Brooks I'm saying this this is why the Bible said eat the whole book because you need to know the thoughts of God right amen and the Bride of Jesus Christ have studied and she knows the word of God she knows good from evil Hello and every day yet though she knows it she's tested on Which choice to make Hallelujah is that right amen and if we choose God's way he all he will always be there to reward us remember brother brandham said he had that burden on his heart he said he had that burden on his heart and while he was up there in that storm that blizzard came he said he saw those after the storm he saw those uh deer amen that he that these different ones wanted to him to kill and he said oh uh he remembered his promise he said they came so close to him he said he could have fed him out of his hands he said but he remembered the promise he said I can't do it he count a shoe off the the Jer and everything and finally they did leave and then the word of the Lord came to him and says oh you remembered your promise see what are you saying when you make a promise better believe it God going to come test you he want to see whether you are faithful Amen in that way Hallelujah is that okay and if you remember your promise he said because you remember your promise he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you I will always be with you Amen in that same course of talking speaking he said may I walk with you can you imagine God asking you or me can he walk with us that was his final test huh come on and God will allow us to make promises so if you made promises and you haven't made the promise you got to repent ask God to forgive you give you strength Amen to do the promises over whatever they may be y'all hear what I'm saying I I'm just saying the Bible tell us it's better not to make a promise than to make one and break it that is to God is that right so I look at this thing and and and you and I must understand that if God is fighting for us now that's that's like the enemy is outside my house he's coming to fight me but my big brother goes out there to attack him now I'm not I'm not I'm not over here worried about who's going to win because I know my brother's going to win right he's got all that it takes to win now I'm not going to be outside I mean inside fretting oh my God what's going to happen to me I know what's going to happen to me I'm safe amen and I don't have to worry about my brother because amen he the battle is like 10 to one right so you know I'm looking at this and I'm looking through the window and what you think I would be saying now this might sound a little connal but I'm going to say hit with the right hit him with the left kick it with the right kick it become it becomes a joyous occasion see now none of us has been in war so maybe we don't understand but I don't think the Israelites felt really bad after they slaughtered Jericho oh we shouldn't have done that y'all that was so rough but my point is when the battle is is in Array and you're battling you don't feel sorry for the devil amen he's not going to feel sorry for you now I look at this thing and I'm saying now we ought to be resting in God Amen we ought to be rested in God because here the Bible said Michael stood up and brother R said Michael is Christ amen Christ stood up and what did he do he put the enemy in their place when the seals were open the word of God came and what did it do it put the the devil in his place why because God the mighty Angel put his foot one on the land one on the sea and basically saying it's mine I'm possessing it like Joshua amen and guess what I was among that all that he possessed I was among that we look at this and we say oh brother Brooks you know I don't you know and I'm saying this because I know if your battles have been as hard as mine has been you know you you think to yourself God if it if it wasn't for your grace I don't even know what I would think of myself maybe I'm the only one but I I I I think about that I says now Lord you know and the thing that gives me consolation is when Satan says okay you going to hell I said well I can see where you are the scripture got you locked in which one you want me to turn to right I mean you you look the Bible says according to Isaiah uh 14 let's let's turn there let's turn there he's already locked in and he trying to tell me where I'm going and in the mind of God he's already there huh amen oh Lucifer you you exalted yourself is that right and you you said I will Ascend above the most high uh Heights of the clouds I will be like the most high now you got to say well brother yes you got to realize the devil in His science has gone beyond any Cloud that we know of Amen hello His science have superseded he brings forth a cloud too when he goes up but it fades away hallelujah amen but when you realize amen that this Lucifer amen has now put this world into a a place where you got to either believe God or science amen hello you look at the Millions billions of how many people that believe in this Evolution stuff and you and I look like the ignorant ones when we say we believe the creation hello come on and and and you got to realize listen the Bible said when this devil when this when this Antichrist comes up he is going to be as Pentecostal as they ever were was you know what I'm saying lyes signs and wonders and all of that he'll have all that stuff going and people go oh my goodness it got to be right my daughter just went down to a church there Sunday she was telling me how a UPC right a UPC Church was celebrating and having a great time because of the Council of churches and taking up money yeah brother random said they would do it and they are they've done it and how many of of us know really how many have done it why do they hate this message so much CU they know the truth they know the truth even that Mr Baker Pastor Baker that died a year or two go down here at this church we visited some of some of some of us spoke evil about the message right and on his dying bed he says well I hope I preach the truth hey you can't die in hope you got to die in faith you know what he told the church there amen that we were branhamites yeah yeah and he said now brother brandom he said now that that brandom he preached a lot of good things but some of those things were wrong now my point is this amen he's got all those people believing what he said and God judged him shortly after that this man died see you can't just speak any kind of way about this message and especially if God got Eagles in there amen help us Lord we're blessed if I can get this congregation you know brother Brown said if we could get on one Accord he said everybody in here will be healed he said those who don't have the Holy Ghost will have it in less than 10 minutes I didn't write the quote down because I couldn't transfer but that's what he said so people we've got to be praying at home wherever it says Lord give us wisdom show us how to get on one Accord y'all hear what I'm saying God put us together not to be separate or some separate entity he put us together to be a body amen and I believe that's what we are but we must somehow all of us from the pull pit to the back of the door you and I must get more sincere and we must come to a place and stop thinking so selfishly and start thinking about the body we got to do it that's the only way this mess this work this church this little assembly is going to work he didn't put us together to fight or to be confused about nothing he put us together to show that this message can bring a body of people to one Accord you so what brother books if he could do 120 he can do us he can do us but we got to stop praying because that's the only way it can happen prayer talking to God being concerned Hallelujah about one another second Timothy 1:9 please I I'm G have to move faster I'm sorry God someone said this to me the other day was it the name s that held him to the Cross or was it the purpose was it the nails or the purpose it was the purpose it was the purpose for which God came that kept him there he had a decision to make brother Bram said he all he had to do was move one finger he said the Angels were all in the bush trees and everywhere he said there would a total place up all he had to do but he had a purpose and he was to fulfill the father's purpose who second Timothy 1:9 who have saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works hello hello not according to your works but but according to his own works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus when before the world began amen if he didn't give it to you then he Ain giving it to you now I don't know how to say it but you got to have faith to believe that he gave it to you then brother brandom said Not only did he save us before the foundation of the world but he filled us and sealed us with the Holy Ghost before the foundation of the world and if that be true then the Holy Ghost is mine if I don't have it yet it's mine and the bride can't go nowhere until I get my ceiling see you got to think like that you got to allow God to do that and you know what a lot of time we want to hurry God but you got to understand God is not controlled by time he's not short in patience y'all hear what I'm saying he knows how to wait amen right so you don't don't get frustrated know that God is on your side Colossians 1:12 please I know I'm jumping I'm trying to encourage you here tonight Shalom peace be unto you let peace amen just flow through your mind and your spirit amen don't be so troubled amen about all these things that Satan is doing he's a liar the Bible said who going to lay anything that God's elect huh the adversary right there accusing you but how can he accuse you brother man said don't you even worry about he said God is the jury there the attorney he's everything and and everything has been settled Amen on your behalf oh my goodness people I'm not saying these things to make you lazy I'm saying these things amen that you'll love God more and want to and desire more to do his perfect will am I sit back oh I got it you know no no no I'm talking about if you really believe it you're going to say Lord let me help let me do something we can't help him but let me show do something to appreciate show you how much I appreciate your labor of love for me Colossians thank you Lord I I don't know about you but I I hurt every day because I want to do more for God I want to live closer for God I I hate this old flesh of mine am I the only one I really hate it you know the more I uh the time go on I despise it and can't hardly wait till the change come is that all right where I got you yeah first uh Colossians 1:12 please giving thanks unto the Father which have made us meat to be to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who have delivered us oh he's going to do it no ha already delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son if we can take those messages dealing with light and darkness I think about that all the time how light forces the issue light takes over light takes charge it doesn't you'll never find light running from the darkness you find light overtaking the darkness in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin huh who is the image now redeemed like brother R said that means means to buy back I like that and if we can buy he can buy us back that means we were there here is Before Time right we were always his brother said is like to put something in a pawn shop it's twice mine right and that's how it is with God we're twice Gods oh people of God this is such a wonderful thing and you know I I I feel a little weary in my flesh but I tell you what my soul is saying hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah who is the image of the invisible God the first born of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible invisible whether be Thrones or Dominion principalities or Powers all things created by Him and for him and he is before all things by him all things consist now you got to realize if that be the case it I know these little brains of ours can't I'm not I'm saying Lord let the Inner Man grab this thing let that reborn again believer inside of you hold fast to this thing he has created all things now I look at this thing brother say God even knows every every time the flea bad his eye I didn't even know a flea had a eye but that's the truth have you ever seen a flee ey no but God knows how many times B his eyl oh that's powerful to me these scientist think they know something first John 3:8 I'm G move on he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sined from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested huh for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might what destroy the works of the devil so what is the Son of God doing in your life destroying the works of the devil amen now you know when God does something for you amen come on somebody it's true it's true St John 18:37 pilot therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou say that I a king thou sayth that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I unto the world that I should bear witness of the truth amen oh everyone that is of the truth heareth my what voice so if you can hear his voice that means you are of the truth amen you can't be of the truth unless you're able to hear his voice oh my and if that's that be the truth what is going to there's no perishing for you no sir because you are the word amen what is truth the word is truth amen pilot had it right in his hand said what is truth then he go right out there and say I find no fault if he had only listen to himself he was bearing witness of the truth because truth has no fault listen how do you know when Satan's talking the Bible says John 8:44 ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it now let me put this say whenever you think you're something I did this I did that you are speaking a lie right amen now you understand what I'm saying when you are in a boastful Spirit as if you have power as if you are the one that's doing something right remember the king in the New Testament I forgot his name amen he was speaking such ha yeah speaking and he was the one that fell over and worms came out of him and everything else because he put himself in God's place the only thing that makes us God in Gods because God is in US amen y'all hear what I'm saying it is not I could never become God or a god without God being in me amen hallelujah like the scripture say basically we're just worms right but when you get into yourself and you think that you are something you like Lucifer you're speaking a lie I know that's tough but it's true brother B said I'm nothing myself he said I'm just nothing now if the prophet can say that and he wasn't saying that to be modest he was truthful when you really got God on your Li in your inside you realize you're nothing you can't even think without him allowing you to think he moves your one thought moves his hand you done you're done you finished right in the message three Witnesses he said when Jesus was taken up on the mountain by Satan he let him look through the stream of time and showed him all the world and the kingdoms thereof and said their mine is that right and I give them to you if you fall down and worship me is that right see Satan will give you anything if you fall down and worship him right Jesus know I heard this on the talk show just yesterday and they were're talking about Hollywood and how filthy Hollywood hwood is and the man was I forgot his name he said whatever you do he said don't let your children go that way he said that is the filthiest thing he said and I tried to tell you tell you this he said there is no way that you you can get into Hollywood without humbling yourself y'all know what I mean by that or being humbled you got to sell something out you got to trade y'all care y'all like you're making it hard for me I know y'all know what I'm talking about but my point is amen isn't that the way it is with Satan right he did it to eeve you're not going to get what I say unless you that was the trade if that was the trade in the beginning that's the trade in the ending you don't gain anything from Satan without giving up something amen Jesus know he inherit them anyhow he said get thee hence Satan and then over in Revelation says Rejoice ye Heavens ye holy prophets for the kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ and as long as they're controlled by Satan they've got that satanic thoughts and Powers they'll fight until Jesus come okay now how are they controlled by Satan in their thoughts in their minds hello and he said as long as they're being controlled by Satan he said they continue to fight that's what he said he said we don't have to worry about wars they going to always have them until Jesus come H because they are controlled by Satan's thoughts right and there be a stone he out of the mountain someday without hands that'll break these World Kingdom into pieces and there'll come a kingdom out of there Hallelujah he said I'm glad tonight I'm a candidate of that Kingdom he said yes sir and then there'll be no more war there'll be no more war after that now I'm saying all these things because we don't realize and I wish I could preach Calvary the way I see it because if we can see what he did for us now that was phenomenal that was powerful but when he came and he took the book according to Revelation 5 don't you realize he's saying yes Not only was I prove myself to be the true Messiah to be the true God of the earth he comes along he says but now by claiming this I Got Heaven and I got Earth I got everything Adam lost I got it back is that right because that's what brother brandham said he said when the seals were open and placed us back into the Garden of Eden before the fall now that's our power that's our right but if God can't get our minds in that place amen we're just sitting here with all his ammunition and not know what to do with it that's what it is we've got all his authority we don't have to live like we're in a cursed world Amen because the cursed world is subject to us amen come on somebody that's how Jesus lived he lived like he would live in heaven he ordered that here like he would order in heaven there was no obstacle for him everything that came his way he controlled it he spoke it or whatever he he he was a god of it am am I making sense because see that's how it is the seal has brought us back to that place and this is what God is trying to get us to see wake up because we are the gods of this Earth amen amen not by power not by might but by his Spirit there's a greater God there's more God for all of us and we've got to press into it press into it press into it because that's where God want us to be the whole creation has been groaning for this but we so busy word about our Salvation as you've heard me say when your salvation is sure sealed father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me but thou lovest me before the foundation of the world is he talking about just way down the road because you got to realize Jesus Christ received the father's Glory here so if he received the father's Glory here we supposed to receive it here before we get there Hallelujah am I making sense because you and I must realize amen that's what brother what happened with brother brandham brother brandham God took brother brandham and showed him that he even had Now understand this it's it will always be prompt by God when it comes to speaking to storms and speaking to squirrels and all of these things God has always been the instigator of that right because he knows with us we'll put things out of order yeah yeah he gave Elijah Authority and Elijah said Lord send down the fire right so you got yeah God knows us so he prompts us to do what he wants us to do and then blesses us to do it you love the Lord amen I know I can't finish this tonight it just I just wanted to encourage you just give me a few more minutes I'm not far from the end listen you have been chosen you have been chosen amen if you could have say that in your heart right now I have been chosen from the foundation of the world is that right the Bible said as he have chosen Us in him before the founds of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in what love in love love God you become blameless love him amen is that right first Peter and this is my last scripture understand Jesus Christ the whole thing has been about you the challenge of Satan to God and Isaiah was about you amen God comes down and shows that the whole thing of creation was about Eve right and then God comes along right every bad situation you know it it it takes the focus off the man and put it on the woman it shows amen basically how she was either sold out or redeemed and here God comes along and he's and he's and he's showing to us amen that you're so free and I want you to know that because you know my thing is this I always think Lord what about those people that wasting their time what if that what if what if a person was not elected but yet to make a bride but yet God got him right among that now let me ask you a question and it sound kind of crazy I don't want you to ever think that you're not elected but if I felt let me put it this way if I felt like I wasn't elected but I was among this message I would enjoy it so much I put everything I got into it because I know this is all I'm going to get but this is better than hell y'all hear what I'm saying I would give it all I got like brother BR like brother BR say may that possibility maybe there's a possibility you see and that's that's why I could never ever just allow Satan believe make me believe that I'm not bride he comes and he talks to me like you ain't right I said I can't explain it but I know I am I can't even see why I am but I am you're not taking that from me you old Thief that's what he is he's a liar and a thief and I'm not going to look at me I'm going to look at my lamb he was perfect so praise God my perfect lamb took my place 1 Peter 1:23 and I'm going to let you go I'm sorry that's not where I want w't you yes yes I do somehow I got a scripture mixed up here somewhere but I'm going to read it to it to you being born again not of corruptible seed that's Corinthians but of in incorrupt corruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever right now I'm going take you to Corinthians the 15th chapter beginning at the 4 2nd verse so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption is is raised in incorruption corruption means to be made inferior by errors or alterations or to pervert right something that comes in that destroys right now the Bible said we were sown in corruption but we're raised incorruption in incorruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power now think about it how God looks at a dead body that the ministry or whoever would touch it had to sanctify themselves and be away from the people so many days and all of that there is you know nothing like a dead body human especially nothing can smell like the human body I heard it was the worst ever of all creatures and my thing is can if it that's bad can you can you imagine the way a holy God looks at it but God hid his seed in such a mess that's the only reason why we would ever get up out of the Grave because of the seed of God remaining in usen right it ain't your flesh it'll never be your flesh that'll get you to heaven amen that's what brother brand said in the Seven Seals right at the end he talks about I use that word corrupt but he doesn't use the word corrupt he talks about in general I said like this he said you'll be as bad as you always have been but he was working with your flesh there is no conversion in your flesh until God changes it don't you wish you would had some converted flesh by now that joke I don't care how much you've learned this word and know this word he's always a rebel it is sown and dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is s a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body folks and so it is written the first man Adam I love this scripture and I don't know why I it just means so much to me because I can see it I can literally see what God has done here it is raised spiritual body there's a natural body and there's a spiritual body and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last man was made a quickening spirit how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and how after was that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven see what I'm saying now the Lord From Heaven had children amen and he redeemed every one of us now you got to reckon within yourself that you know that you know that you know that you know you did not come from Satan amen and if you didn't come from Satan where did you come from oh come on it's so simple if you know you didn't come from Satan where did you come from there's only two Gods really only one God but God of this evil age is Lucifer if you didn't come from here if you're not among his children are you among his children oh no no no so you got to realize amen you come yo y your your your Adam your your creator where you came from was from heaven and he's the Lord From Heaven as is the Earthly such are also that are Earthly and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly and as we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the that's me amen that's you amen it is a reality that we bore the image of the earthy so if we have done that and we now got the Heavenly in us what's going to stop us from boring bearing the uh Heavenly we ought to be resting Amen in our minds and pressing right going forward instead of standing still why we've got too many things tagged to us that we ought not not to have because it's not there amen all these things that you think got you tag to you is your imagination and the trickery of Satan because he whom the son has set free is free indeed and when you begin to realize that you are free everything that has you in bondage must go amen resist the devil and he'll flee from you that's the Bible resist him and he go ignore him and he'll go let's stand cuz he's lying all the time and like I said if we can just get into a prayer a prayer uh spirit of Prayer you'll be surprised how so many of the chains will fall God is looking for a bride who's completely free brother randam said only those who are not bolted down said they might be metal said but if they're bolted down they won't go up you got to be free metal when the magnet comes he ain't he ain't untying nothing he just taking everything that's loose Hallelujah free free from all of this world free from this bondage and these it's an illusion and Satan is a mastermind of Tricks but my God knows everyone he can pull out of his hat amen and we so thank God for having a God who have taken care of everything I I the more I see it the more I look at it just is so how can you say it is believable but yet so so unbelievable that God could do such a thing for me I don't know how you feel about it but I have to personalize it you know because I realize amen that without God I'm wicked without him I don't know how else to describe me this old flesh and I was telling God how how I go to church and everything else he said yeah I said yeah I I said I have to go to church I said you would be surprise on the things that flow through my head but God always builds the fence around me Hallelujah come on somebody amen he give me the strength to let don't let the birds nest there now don't let them Nest amen you got to cast them out you got to pray pray that's where I'm getting my victory folks I'm getting my victory in prayer that's where I get mine you love the Lord amen just keep on praying all the the Lord is now just keep on praying he your cry for the Lord has Pro and his word is true just keep on pray he'll answer you once again
