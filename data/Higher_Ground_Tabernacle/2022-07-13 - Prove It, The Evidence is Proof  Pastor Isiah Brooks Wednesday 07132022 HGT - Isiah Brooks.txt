truly I would not be here if it had not been for the mercies of the Lord as we stand we're going to get right into the word of the Lord we're going to ask that you turned with us to John the ninth chapter we'll read the 30th to the 30th fourth verse thank you musicians and thank you song Rita we're living in a Time that uh if not careful we are missed the very event of the coming of the Lord Satan is busy on every hand sometimes we forget how late in the day it is there are things that we must do things that we must come into I remember the last service that we preach I made a statement that brother Branham said if you don't come into the Shekinah Glory you won't make the Rapture well he did not say it exactly that way but all of us should understand that we must come into perfection and this Perfection can only be obtained by way of this message and that is through Christ because Christ Jesus is the message of the hour so we want you just to listen and you know you don't even have to say Amen tonight if you don't feel led to but if you feel led to say Amen John 9 30-34 the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvelous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he have opened mine eyes now we know that God heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshiper of God listen to the word he says but if any man be a worshiper of God and doeth his will him he heareth since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind if this man were not of God he could do nothing they answered and said it to him doubt was altogether born in sin and thus thou teach us and they cast him out 35th verse of the same chapter Jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him does thou believe on the son of God and he answered and said who is he Lord that I might believe on him and Jesus said unto him thou Hast but see seeing him and it is he that talketh with thee and he said Lord I believe and he worshiped him I like that Hebrews 13 and 8. says Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever let us pray our gracious father we come as lowly and as humble humble as we know how we realize Lord Jesus that this desk is a sacred desk and every time I stand behind it O Lord I Feel So Unworthy my worthiness come from you because you've made it so you said in your word that you became my sin that I might become your righteousness and as I stand in this Pulpit I receive your righteousness father bless the service bless the hero make us all doers of the word and Lord God we thank you Father because we know that you hear us because your word says even before we speak you have heard and Lord Jesus I thank you Father for giving us Grace to make us a tabernacle of God let your word be spoken tonight Quicken it to our hearts that we may live better Christian lives in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I was discussing today with brother Craig Bohr and he and I was like on one Accord as as if we could finish each other's statement when we were talking and he has the same thirst for God the yearning for perfection he's doing fine he and his family there in Connecticut but he is somewhat like I am his church is pretty much isolated from all of the other groups but he likes it that way and so do I one of the things that I do note is that God is moving on individual hearts in such a mighty way and it's not visible to most of the people but For Those whom God is moving in and dealing with they know that the day of translation is nearer now than it's ever been we can't explain what we feel like the animals when they know danger is coming and they began to move into a safe place of shelter and this is what True Believers are feeling now we know it's falling apart this world and we're now moving I mean of course it is according to the scripture the Bible says once the vision has been made plain let him that readeth run and you know we have a great adversary not giving praise to the devil but God made him a real adversary and his duty is to distract us and to keep us from focusing and and to keep us from recognizing the purpose for which we came in this hour God could have left us out on the street he could have left us in denominational churches and organization but he pulled us out for a specific means and that purpose amen must be fulfilled uh you've got to understand by God's grace that God will anoint those who are according to his purpose anoint them to do what he wants them to do it's not a jumping and a shouting but it's such an inspiration that you know that you know that you know that you must do what you need to do one thing about genuine Eagles of this day they know the thing that's right we understand that we can't do anything of ourselves but we know the power uh behind the word that can make us perform the word you and I must understand that in this day we must recognize that we're not just Pentecostals but we're Pentecostals Plus we are in addition to what they have and and that has it can't be just verbalized it must be manifested materialized and the only way that can be done is that God find favor and began to vindicate himself in you only faith can produce the promises of the word if you read in the book of Hebrew I believe it's the 11th chapter we call it the book of faith you find out that all the Patriots of the Old Testament was anointed by faith they achieved everything they did by faith and Faith as you have heard me say is not a thing is a person it's a revelation right remember I just read to you the scripture about the man who was born blind never had at sight and never never had a vision of any kind born that way for 30 years and according to the Jewish Customs or the way they thought their processes if someone was born like that or crippled or maimed in some way they believed that it was some generational curse or sin that caused that person to be like that and so they even asked Jesus who did Sin whether it was the mother or the father who did Sin and Jesus says neither neither of these men uh people sin but all of this was done for the glory of God can you imagine God allowing a man to be born 30 years he suffered blindness for God's glory it doesn't make sense to the Natural man but you see God is not concerned about what makes sense to you everything he does is for his own Glory and his own pleasure and so you say well what about Calvary I still think about Calvary and I wondered you know to me it is such a a a awesome strategy that God used against his adversary God himself come down like a trojan horse hidden in Jesus Christ and Satan himself was confused in all of his followers confused was confused because the Bible said if they had only knew and had only known that this Jesus Christ was God they would never have crucified him but he looked like he died he looked as if he died a loser but he was not a loser he was a winner and he still today is a winner and oftentimes God does things that we in our little Minds can't understand and we often question and say why the truth of the matter is why not we didn't make ourselves he made us and we ought to be glad to be able to experience life because you know what we don't know what life really is I think about dogs I think about cats I think about birds and all the creation of God that those animals that that just do not have souls but you'll never see them complaining a dog knows his master and he knows he loves that Master in spite of all of the abuse he may obtain from that Master that dog still loves that Master but when it comes to mankind we don't appreciate God who is our master we think sometimes he's made a mistake but God never makes mistakes but one thing I do love about God the master plan of Calvary I say it now I might say two things then is that God hid himself within a seed he planted the seeds before the foundation of the world and now we have come to harvest time and these seeds are now being anointed to be manifested these seeds in itself were seeds of faith and these Faith seeds are now coming to a place where they are beginning to see who they are and what they are you think about the trees or every seed that is planted I'm sure the the apple seed doesn't say while it's still a seed I'm an apple seed but once it's planted and began to grow and nature began to nurture it and bring it up and it begins to see what it is it begins to perform duties that it didn't even know you know he had the ability to do I mean think about it all of those seeds in one apple that's going to spread the generation of apples for Everlasting now I want to come to a place to say as I said early only faith can produce the promises of the word faith is a gift you know it's a gift from God it is a revelation something that God gives you that's personal he may not give it to no one else but when you see it it becomes a vision of a sight to you like a sixth sense you can see it when nobody else can see it you think about the man forward and and all of the other inventors you know they'd invented uh you know cars and electricity and all they discovered it they didn't invent it it was always there but God used him in the science field and and when they were trying to bring these things into a place of sight because it wasn't visible it was only visible to the man it's like an artist who was able to paint a painting because he sees a vision of something and and he knows how to put it on the canvas and but while it's in his head you can't see it but once he places on the on the canvas you begin to see oh ah that's wonderful and you think wow this God this this man is great no no no no the inspiration that gave him the vision is the great one he's just an instrument that God is placed in this dimension for you to see and to enjoy because every good and perfect gift comes from God the prophet God said the genuine Faith seed because the word of God Is by faith and he gives to Abraham now how many of us could have done what Abraham did Abraham didn't even know where he was going but the voice or the vision however God dealt with him he realized it was God he came from a place like India that had thousands of different gods and which one you know the the cow or the the elephant or the monkey or the whatever but when he heard from God he knew it was God he didn't have anything tangible he didn't have an image the only thing he had was the inspiration had not even met him yet per se as a person but he was able to follow God by that inspiration you know and the Bible says as Abraham began to walk and begin to talk with God then God at some point in time made himself visible but the thing that God spoke one thing about Abraham he knew the voice of God faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God now see that's what I'm saying that's the only way that you can see yourself as being bride it must be a revelation to you that's revealed to you that you abide you can't even explain it but something deep down in your soul testifies I'm pride in spite of all the mistakes because even as bride we have to grow and mature into a perfect man it just doesn't happen overnight which most of us wish it would have but God gets Glory and all of the things that he's doing listen but to the church even the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her now I'm going to Simply say it like this the Rapture in its Simplicity is Christ in you because at the at the at the at the uh uh Lazarus tomb Jesus said to Mary and Martha I am the resurrection and I am the life and this is why the devil do not want people to get the Holy Ghost he doesn't mind if you get religious he doesn't even mind if if you you you pay your tithes if you shout if you dance speak in tongues whatever you want to do all of those things are great but listen the thing that you must know that you know that you know is that you've been born again and even then when you're first born again you just started the journey this is a place of maturing a place of growing up a time for mistakes a time for asking for forgiveness you know a lot of times people believe that in Romans 10 9 he says you know if a man confessed with his mouth and believe with his heart you know that he's you know uh uh passed from death and to life but let me tell you something you know what comes before that repentance you've got to repent you can confess that with all your mouth your mind body and soul but if you haven't repent if you haven't come to a place where you will regret and you ask God to forgive you you see your sins you see your ugliness you see how filthy and uh undeserving you are your confession means nothing faith is a revelation so is Jesus Christ now he was a man born blind 30 years perhaps because he was going he was a church member you know did y'all know that in the church 30 years born blind that's him that's a symbol of something symbolic of something people can go 30 years serving God in the best they know how and still be blind and then Jesus came listen listen what did Jesus what did you Jesus did he opened his eyes in a slow process Jesus could say Be Thy healed and it would have happened but he mixed mud he mixed dirt and spit erupted into man's eye that means you know it needed some work but you know his sight needed some working and he worked on that man's eye told him to go wash in the pool of Salah and he did the first he didn't see just right second he you know he saw things and that's what happened we we began to see men like trees your sight is not perfect yet there's a church it's Christ Jesus himself and all Jesus said go show yourself to the priest and he goes to show himself to the priests and they they because of their jealousy because of their envy and things they began to just you know ridicule the man and this man I love him I like to shake his hand once they get there I love the way he outsmarted those Pharisees and doctors of divinity because they wanted to liken his healing as as something evil because it was done on the Sabbath day and then it was by Jesus who was supposedly being born by fornication you know it's amazing how God can still do things today and people are still call it the devil they'll see a man who was a drunkard a prostitute or a whoremonger murderer whatever he was there see him change and then liking his changes being evil because of the church he goes to because his church believed in the Supernatural because his church believed that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it is a revelation father Revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation well without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as Hallelujah glory to God as though it was it wasn't so see once it's revealed you gotta you gotta you gotta speak against it anything that's contrary to your Revelation you've got to speak against it because it's not of God um y'all looking at me like I'm crazy but let me say you you to believe bride and that Revelation is contrary to all of your five senses because your five senses will declare that you are a sinner your five senses will declare that you're still lost your fives that's why you must die and rot to yourself the church is built upon Revelation I'm coming built upon it let me say it like that did you realize what Jesus said he said I am the thine and you are the branches and you can't do nothing without me showing telling you the life that's in you must come from the Vine and that's Jesus Christ right see there's where I want to stay faith is a revelation there's just a moment it is a revelation he has revealed it to you by what his grace oh I deserve it no it's his grace Abraham was among the idolaters and God by Grace not that Abraham was a Godly Man or not that Abraham was something better than anybody else no God chose him gave him Grace and Abraham followed God that's how it is you think you're better than somebody else the Bible said we all have sinned and come short of the glory of God in the Book of Revelation they said none was worthy to open the book or to lose to seals thereof Peter Paul John James you name him Abraham Moses none not one there was only one man and that was Jesus Christ the only one still is and always will be but we look at Us in the book of Acts 16 through 2 2 through 16 he says but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel see the word must identify you and the identification comes by proof by Vindication is evident this is it on the day of Pentecost when the power of God fell it was Peter that stood up and he is the one that says this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel he was able to go into the Old Testament and pull it into the new and said these things that you call insane and crazy God is manifesting it right now in your eyes and it should come to pass in the last day say God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams let me tell y'all something that scripture is still alive but you know what kills it traditions of men and every time you say well the Lord show me this and the Lord told me that and he did and he did show them that but now people are so afraid to identify the voice that they hear and the Revelation that God gives them throughout the day they are afraid because they feel like they're going to be criticized when you know that is God you don't have to fear no man speak it that's why I testify do you know why I tell my testimonies because I used to be one of them afraid to testify because people was going to think that I was trying to be something and our sister Karen God gave her a word from the Lord and she gave me the word from the Lord and told God was displeased with me and told me not to do that anymore when he moves me to testify testify whether the people like it or not and from that time on I've been telling everybody about what God has done for me because I knew she was a spiritual sister and I knew what she said was from God ooh a sister absolutely president said Pentecost there is where you failed you thought because you were born of the spirit born of the spirit the birthright that settled it but it only starred it remember in the message hear ye hear him how that the child after he was born in the family becomes a son and if it had rights to be to the birthright but it had to be proven see that's what people don't understand oh I'm in the message I follow the prophet of God Malachi 4 you know Revelation 10 . that ain't it that's just the words vindicating that God has done something you got to prove that your seed it must be proven and the only way that that could ever happen is that you've got to be you've got to come in contact with the quickening power the seed must be quickened it ain't difficult the difficult part is that we are too proud we're arrogant we're too proud to just get there and wallow till we get it whatever it takes some may have to do that some may not have to but the point is you do not stop you can't stop until you God comes down and Vindicated that you have been a proper son or a proper daughter it's foolish to start the race and yet you didn't count the costs it's a great cause and you and I got to we must and listen you got to love the unlovable you got to love those that despitefully use you got to bless them you got to do everything Jesus said you must be a lamb and the only way you can be a lamb is that the Lamb of God is living inside of you it ought to put a desperation on our souls we ought to be a desperate people trying to move into that Veil and not yet come and not never to come out we ought to be pressing into it right because that's what brother random said he said it was death one time to go in but now it's death to stay out um and God is trying to get us there but you know what we're so busy you know it I'm talking about myself from the pulpit back to the door we allow Satan to be make us so busy and we're so distracted with all of these carnal things in your soul is at stake is all about me it ain't all about you it's about him Hallelujah see you had a right and after it was born talking about the child into the family becomes a son it had rights to be the birth to the birthright but it had to be proven child trained y'all know what that is don't do this don't do that you know no no no this is wrong this is right God in his leadership training us how to be what Kings and Priests training and those Priests of the Old Testament they were born into the Leviticus priesthood and they had to be trained they didn't say okay you you're born a Levi just go in there and figure it out no they had to be trained they had to know all of the order of the word and what to do and what not to do on various days we don't have to do that but one thing for certain we must it is a must that the Holy Spirit occupies the temple people of God I fight every day seemingly all day some battles I win and some battles I lose but one thing for certain my vision is clear I know where I'm headed and I'm going I'll know the Finishing Line when I cross it Hallelujah hear you him right it has to be proven an obedient child to the father will then it must be well it did not get the because see it become heirs it's air it aired nothing without obedience you air nothing it doesn't take away from you being a son but then over there you own nothing you're not the heir of nothing yet it was a son but he aired nothing if he wasn't interested in the father's work and that's the problem we ought to be about our father's business and so when the Holy Ghost fell upon the uh the Pentecostal people and they began to restore back the gifts and things that was in the church they thought because they were born of the spirit that settled it but but you see there is a placing of a son and after this son proved to be a real son then he was taken into the public place then was set up and changed robes and set up there and then there was a placing of the Sun that he had had the air of everything the father had and that's what people don't understand we're in trial child training and we say potentially we are joined as potentially we own everything he he owns but he'll never hand his business over to you until you come to that place of maturity look what Pentecost did with those little gifts that he gave them people are so backslid now don't think nothing about it handle it like it's their gift Hallelujah there are two spirits in the last days the church spirit of the church people and the bride Spirit of the Bride people would be so close together till it would deceive the very elected if it was possible that's how close my thing is then Peter said this is that that was spoken by Prophet Joel where is the man where is the woman that could say this is that that was spoken by Malachi 4. by the prophet William Branham where is the man where is the woman because what we're doing just doesn't look like this is that oh we got the word what we fail to see is that brother branham's sowed seeds and we took the word of God in his seed form and said we got it it's all week we got it all of being a tree we don't want just a seed we want the tree we want the tree we want the fruits we want everything the message is supposed to bring forth we want to be able to say I and the father are one we want to see it I want to see it and I'm not going to quit no turning back for me oh but then come the Pentecostals the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues they call it the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues there they called the initial evidence which brought forth what the shock but they denominated but when you come to say I and my father are one and these are the things then the shock pulls away from it see what are you saying there's a position a purpose for this message is to bring his bride to a place where she can declare I and my father are one Saint John 10 30 the same thing Jesus said and Jesus prayed in Saint John 17 father I word that there be one even as We Are One oh my God it's so it's so difficult people if you don't humble your minds and your thoughts right now you're gonna miss what God is trying to say let me tell you like this this is Grace this is the grace of God because God has given us instructions and the word of God said if you draw nigh to God He will draw nigh to you but you got to draw not to him he's the king we're the queen but when you come to say I my father one and these things then the shuck pulls away from it but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God in his fullness and in his strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever that's all I'm saying there's a genuine bride and I'm part of her notice in the womb of Mary was the seed but when the seed was delivered it said I come to do the will of him that sent me I and my father are one if I do not his works there you go see it's not say oh I'm bride I'm bride where are the works Believe Me Not there was he says if I don't do what is what the scripture says I'm supposed to do you don't have to believe me but here the word of God tells us in our day this is why you got to understand brother Benjamin's message on the message that was sent by God through him and and you got to understand what he's doing he pulled we pulled away from the shock so if we pulled away from the shop there's a message for us there's a word for us that the shock can't see or perceive it's beyond all of the the the the the the the pleasures and the shouting and the dancing God want to see maturity he wants to see real sons and daughters of God that's been that'll be able to say I come to do my father not my will I come to do his will and that's the problem we're doing all of our wills and we're not even thinking about what his will is I do not his his works if I do not his Works believe me not there was to see which one of you can condemn me of unbelief huh he says listen I stay with the word so well it manifested itself it Vindicated itself that's what Jesus said even to the blind man he said listen I'm looking for him where is he he said I'm the one talking to you and the Bible said that that the man because he was the evidence he was the proof he had already preached the message to the Pharisees and the Sadducees you've never seen in the history of Israel a man born blind receiving his sight and you say this man is of the devil and I say the word says no man who is evil can do this this man who did open my eyes he has to be sent from God and then when God Jesus Christ opened this man's eye naturally he didn't leave them closed spiritually he opened his eyes by identifying himself with the works that have been proven have been that he stood as evidence that Jesus Christ was the Messiah and this man said I believe and the Bible said he began to worship Him [Applause] help us Lord see we must understand what what was good for us message people you know years ago or whenever that's not where God is turned in a corner because he's looking for Sons and Daughters to adopt adopted and he's putting you through the ringer testing you with everything to see whether you're going to believe his word or not to see whether you just got to see it happen well when you once you see it happen he don't need your faith your faith is all right yelling at me well I believe it when I see it come on come on what no I believe it if I don't see it no I'd never seen rain but he believed it Sarah she laughed but then God gave her strength to believe God will give you strength to believe especially when you seed he's going to give it to you it's yours it's your inheritance don't ever think God is your enemy he's your friend that's what he said to Abraham I'm your friend and where Abraham seed he's our friend listen but those says Watch Seven Seals has been opened the Whirlwind is to the West now don't miss it like they did back Yonder what did they miss they missed their day of visitation when Jesus came they missed him and brother William said every messenger of God he said that that the church World always missed them and then once they're gone then they recognize them you know like St Patrick Joan of Arc who the Catholic Church killed and then once they come along I forgot how many years it took them to recognize that Joan of arch was not a witch but she was a gifted sister then they dug up the priest's bones and threw it in the river whatever they did they tried to uh recompense compensate or whatever you call it amen but the works was already done what about John the Baptist what about Jesus you think about the patience of God Here with Jesus killed and crucified and raised from the dead there in Jerusalem and 99 of the world didn't even know he existed didn't even know God had come down and visited us same thing with the message here was God in a little Kentuckian right here in Kentucky a no man's land well it used to be but the point is a man with seventh grade education that's the kind God uses sometimes our education gets us in trouble I know it's gotten me in trouble sometimes you know we let our minds reason when we shouldn't he says listen they missed him they missed John the Baptist we thought the Elijah must come John disciples his own disciples did not even recognize who he was and Jesus said well Elias has already come and you didn't know it and then they have done to him whatever they wanted to do with them and the Bible said then his disciples perceived that he would talk about John oh my God Jesus what about his disciples they didn't fully understand him no don't tell me they did because when he talked told them how he was going to be crucified how he was going to die and when the event took place they all scattered they didn't even fully understand him until they received the Holy Ghost that's when they understood that Jesus Christ was God that's why Peter could say God has made him both Lord and Christ and you and I you'll never see it oh I don't care who you are you you know I'm hoping somebody online can hear what I'm saying until you get the Holy Ghost you'll never know that Jesus Christ is God Peter had a revelation Thou Art the Christ the son of a living God but you understand that was just up here it couldn't have been here because when the pressure came he tried to kill the Roman soldier and one thing about this Holy Ghost he's not going to cause you to take nobody's head off now our attention's a little closer to our day he says now our attention a little closer to our day what does the scripture say about today and about the time we live in Jesus speaking I won't have time to take them all but I want you to take this one before we close Jesus said in Saint Luke 17 chapter the 30th verse the word himself do you believe that he said Jesus Christ the word himself made flesh spoken said what the word would be in the end time what will be the sign of the end of the world he told the Nations would rise against Nation but he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed he promised the son of man and William Branham was a son of man revealing the son of man he said I'm not him I'm not it but I'm just a covering I'm just a housing and God was revealing himself to the world and they did just the same with William Branham as they did oh people don't even like for you to call his name that's nonsense that's just a carnal mind right how can you tell about you know the flood and you don't say Noah how can you tell about the Exodus of of of of of uh uh the children of Israel and you don't say Moses what do you say the brother the brother deliver the children out of out of bondage the brother built an ark what brother the brother has a name it so amazes me because even in this last days people don't want you to say brother random but I remember when I was in the Pentecostal church we always said the bishop said the bishop said when I was in high school we had a teacher who believed in Billy Graham every phrase in Spanish she was teaching the Spanish she said Billy Graham said and we had a few devils in that class who hated the name of William Billy Graham and they they got her fired but you know what let me hurry up because I've gone too long I don't I'm trying to get to my point each hey age had a messenger Who Sold seed Luther sold the seed that just shall live by faith Wesley sold the seed of sanctification crossing over into Pentecost sold the seed of receiving of the Holy Ghost and the receiving of gift then the sower himself you understand me the sore himself came and sold seed it wasn't William Branham it was God in the man sowing Faith seeds that could produce a Rapture in a people once it's quickened foreign of the Capstone perfect love right so the soul to see and that's what what we we must understand you said what birth because I'm not where I should be it doesn't mean the seed is not there it means you have not humbled yourself so that God can Quicken it it's there otherwise you wouldn't have ears to hear that shows you are elected and you're predestinated he said my sheep Hearth my voice and a stranger they will not follow but there are procedures that we have taken out of the formula of salvation and if you take the holy ghost or the Christ and that's what brother Venom came to tell us justification made room for sanctification sanctification made room for uh the baptism of Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost making room for Christ the person Jesus himself like I said the message came in seed form we're growing up now things are becoming clearer to us that we left Eliza to join Isaac um but the Pentecostal what is it you talk about Pentecost because that's what a lot of people like to identify themselves but the real Pentecostals most of them gone they gone to Glory most of them the real ones and they they got those Renegades now they call Pentecostals so does the message is a restoration of the same kind of a grain that went into the ground at the beginning bringing back all the fullness of the power of Pentecost by the baptism of the Holy Ghost last day oh it's a great thing to look to believe and to look at now in this we're now living this age is beyond Pentecost Pentecost had settled itself into organizations and started faking whole Lots about organizations we are this and we are that that's just nature you just can't help it it's nature they'll do that it's it's the plan for them to do that but the church has moved on it's gone into greater more powerful it's the restoration of the gifts and many Pentecostal people does not believe in Divine Healing Ministry of angels and power of God right now even now you tell somebody in the message that you had a an experience with an angel like what it can't be true when did he stop it tell me when oh they only visit prophets no they visit Peter and they're historically listen what about the man a man who had a vision that Jesus Christ came and and and and and and and who you remember the drugstore man he gave the hit the medicine to the woman and when his wife reached out her hands it was the hand of Jesus pierced and everything else and and the the drug that says brother do you really believe in such things that he said yes I believe it what made us get away from the supernatural when we're born Supernatural fear not all teachers are bad there are some teachers that are really brilliant and wonderful teachers but a lot of them have taken and you got to go take it back you go to church and you got such an order that you can't even get out of order really your out of order is in order according to the scripture I remember my wife and I in a church some time ago to a concert and they you you think that you was at some kind of I don't know Auditorium where they just there to entertain you my wife and I was the only one standing up and clapping and they looking at us like what are you doing a message well that's what they call themselves right Lord y'all gonna see I ain't got to say much because when I break loose Y'all Gonna Know It that's all I'm saying it ain't going to be no oh I'm gonna show them no no no but one thing I know I got it coming I got it coming and because God said when you ask and believe you shall receive and I don't know one man throughout history who did cry out for a Revival and didn't get it it may not have happened in his time but it happened I just preached that to you right Ministry of angels and power of God many people many Pentecostals call these visions that I see the devil many organizations won't even have nothing to do with it in Pentecost see we've moved beyond that just as method is called Pentecostal crazy for speaking in tongues just as a Lutheran called Methodist crazy for shouting see but it's all a coming forth of the Holy Spirit till listen the great church is being filled and chugged full Hallelujah okay oh my god of the great power y'all know what chug means it's a hold it up like this targeting down yes chugged full Hallelujah of the great power of the almighty God until is God to a place until the very work that Jesus done is manifested in itself right in the church now and I'm not preaching this to say it's coming I'm saying it's here we're living in a living ahead of that now we are Beyond Pentecost I'm gonna keep saying that the same as we are a Methodist and Luther way up to the coming of the Lord where the minister of Jesus Christ exercised himself has to be exalted y'all understand me he said the ministry of Jesus Christ has to be a excuse me not exalted has to be exactly like the headstone on the pyramid has to be so home till every stone fit perfectly and the church has got to get in that condition to receive the headstone then take the whole thing in the resurrection see when we get in that condition that God is saying we is required us to get into we are then joined in such a way it'll cause the resurrection there must be a come a union with the bridegroom has to the character his divine nature she must become him promise of the age and what is the promise of the age that God will will will will will produce in this last days little Messiahs Hallelujah that's what the Bible says the Bible says according to Revelation 19 10 he said for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy and I want you to know I'm part of that spirit I am part of the prophecy that has been prophesied that in the last days that the mechanic and the Dynamics will come back to the church it is here but we got to get some people that's ready to to go Beyond the Veil until that church become both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so with a bride amen for he said in John 14 12 he that believeth on me the words that I do shall he also do I give him a charge of my a charge of my Dynamics in his mechanics that that the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll raise him up again in the last days see that Easter message that dynamics that mechanics together the mechanics without the Dynamics no good neither is the Dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up and down and and all you want to deny the word it won't do any good you're just crinking around the Pistons got the Sparks there to fire but no gasoline to fire it by it's only work as they come together did y'all hear that it only works when they come together amen so one will still will sit still and the other one will go up that's the only thing there is to it yet they both might look alike both claim to be churches both claim to be bride but out of mechanics but one but one excuse me has mechanics and dynamic it brings it to past of what he said is the truth it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the Dynamics come when the Dynamics come the that fire is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline and when that explodes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of God mechanisms with the Dynamics is the spirit that quickens is that right it's a spirit it's the Sparks that fire it's not the gas that fires it's the spark that fires the gas Jesus said you can't do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the word is the father living father sent me so of sent I you as the father has fired me and pushed me into everything I do only that which is pleasing to God now as he sent me so send I you with the same mechanics and it takes the same Dynamics to operate it and these signs should follow them that claim they have to have the mechanics the Dynamics will take its place now there's much more but I'm gonna stop here I just want you to see that without the Holy Ghost we're just a regular dead Church foreign feeling good shouting good singing good preaching good is more than that we're in the age of adoption well the man said the full word is to be born into the manifestation again Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when it was here on Earth full strength not letting the devil just do us any kind of way kick us all around and saying we're proud come on manifested in the same way doing the same thing that he did when it was on on here on Earth amen now I don't know about you I'm closing but that it don't make you want more you know to make you say God where where is it lead me and guide me Lord help me I want to be that that's me you speaking of I know that I know that but I'm not there Lord show me how to break through show me how to break through Lord you know let's stay brother president said then what is it now we must be about the father's business that we the wheat would cry back the grain the wheat would cry back the grain yes sir what must it do vindicate Malachi for indicate Luke vindicate Luke 17 30 vindicate hubris 13-8 vindicate Saint John 14 12 vindicate all of his word Vindicated Hebrew write 10 of the opening of the seals and the mysteries of God even to the serpent seat in all would be manifested married and divorced marriage and divorce and all of these other Mysteries that have been hid under the pillar of all these years from the theologians and so forth but it's now the hour that's the father's business Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man can come to God accept by me in other words I am the door to the Sheepfold all without a thieves he is the only approach he is the door he is the way the truth the life all that there is the only entrance the only place the only worship The Only Name everything is tied to Jesus Christ all the Old Testament is tied to him the New Testament tied to him and the church today is tied to him by the word of his commandment there is not another place or another name or anywhere where God ever promised to meet a man only in Jesus Christ his chosen place worship our heavenly father we come before you Lord we thank you for the word that has been spoken help us now I am a believer I believe your word [Music] I know what is spoken by Malachi 4 is true I see your will Lord let your will be done in US we know it's not by power nor by might but by your spirit Lord it's not him that willeth nor he that runeth but Lord Jesus is you who who shows your mercy toward us father we are living in such an evil age where Satan is battling our minds every day making us weary in our flesh and our spirit but in all of this my soul says yes to your will and your word in spite of all of the obstacles in spite of all of the spirits of unbelief that he sends my way I hold true to My Confession that this message is you and you're the same yesterday today and forever and father I believe that my day and our day where you're going to raise us up to a place the world will see that we are truly your disciples they will see o God that there's a difference between us and the organizations they'll see you Lord manifested in your fullness they won't know what to do with it but even so at that time Lord Jesus you'll take us to another dimension you'll come back in a way that will see you in we embrace you father have mercy for those of us who have been dilatory and slack I'm one of them my press Lord is weak sometimes but father look beyond my faults look beyond our faults and see our needs we need you Jesus We Adore You Lord we know your word is 100 right we say Amen to every word hallelujah father let us live every word Lord as we come to the end of the preaching I pray father God that you let every word that was spoken fall in good ground that we all would bring forth a hundredfold whether we be in this church or on the air we sow thirst for those things that Malachi spoke we believe it to the father but we know that we can never attain it without your mercy and Grace so let it be in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen there be anybody that desired prayer [Music] foreign [Music] I Feel
