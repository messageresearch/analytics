[41:22] Minister.
[41:25] [Music]
[41:33] [Music]
[42:11] I'm calling for
[42:34] I'd like to greet you all in the name of
[42:35] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[42:42] Just hope that in this uh that today
[42:47] the Lord the Lord will be with us for
[42:50] this moment.
[42:55] this moment that we're going to dedicate
[42:56] for his service
[43:00] to not take much of your time.
[43:03] I would love to open scripture.
[43:10] I think I've been here. It's been eight
[43:13] years ago. I think eight years ago I was
[43:14] here.
[43:18] And God allowed that I be here again.
[43:25] and just to have this little meeting
[43:27] that we're going to have together.
[43:32] I think God is going to help somebody
[43:33] today
[43:36] because God doesn't do anything for no
[43:38] reason.
[43:40] God does everything with a purpose.
[43:44] And if we pay attention,
[43:47] we're going to catch the vision
[43:53] and we will see what God is doing for
[43:55] us.
[44:00] I want to open our Bible in the book of
[44:02] 1st Samuel chapter 13 verse14.
[44:09] shall not continue.
[44:14] The Lord has sought him a man after his
[44:17] own heart.
[44:21] And the Lord hath commanded him to be
[44:24] captain over his people
[44:29] because thou has not kept that which the
[44:31] Lord commanded thee.
[44:36] And in the book of Act 13 verse 22
[44:42] and after rejecting him,
[44:46] he brought them to see David,
[44:51] he raised up unto them David to be their
[44:52] king, to whom also he gave testimony,
[44:58] and said, I found David the son of Jess,
[45:02] a man after my own heart,
[45:06] which shall fulfill all my will.
[45:10] Let's bow our heads for a word of
[45:11] prayer.
[45:14] Almighty God,
[45:17] with these scriptures that we just read,
[45:22] we pray that you give us the context in
[45:24] the scriptures
[45:28] because anyone can open this Bible.
[45:34] But only the spirit of God can can
[45:36] quicken the life for us.
[45:42] I chose the scriptures to speak to your
[45:44] people.
[45:47] People for whom you died on Calvary
[45:51] and you shed your blood for them.
[45:54] Now come down Lord
[45:57] and break the bread for us
[45:59] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[46:02] We asked. Amen. Amen.
[46:06] You may have your seat.
[46:13] And once more, I greet you all in the
[46:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[46:18] I am brother.
[46:24] I see a lot of familiar faces here.
[46:31] And I thank God that I see you on this
[46:33] other side here.
[46:36] For those who don't know,
[46:41] I've been a pastor for more than 40
[46:43] years
[46:46] in the Republic democra in the Republic
[46:49] Democratic Republic of Congo.
[46:56] I was here uh like seven years or eight
[46:58] years ago
[47:01] because I have my son who lives here.
[47:10] The first time I came here is when he
[47:11] graduated.
[47:17] And I came back again when he got
[47:18] married.
[47:23] And the third time I came here when he
[47:25] had two kids
[47:32] and I thank God being perfect in three.
[47:34] I think this third my third visitation
[47:36] here is a is perfection.
[47:41] And I was very happy when I was uh at
[47:43] his home.
[47:50] I was with them little my grandkids when
[47:53] they saw me the first time I they were
[47:54] really uh little
[47:59] and now now that I'm here they they're
[48:02] now talking
[48:06] and and the last one when he sees me he
[48:08] calls me grandma.
[48:12] I'm not your grandma. I'm I'm your grand
[48:14] I'm your grandma
[48:17] grandma. But he keeps calling me grandma
[48:24] because he he's used to to seeing his
[48:27] grandmother who's here.
[48:30] And so everybody that he sees, he calls
[48:32] them grandma.
[48:35] They made they made me very happy
[48:37] yesterday
[48:39] and I thank the Lord for that.
[48:48] And I was uh surprised when I saw the
[48:50] young chess here.
[48:55] I was very close very close to his
[48:57] father.
[49:00] I'm very very close to his father.
[49:03] [Music]
[49:06] When I saw the young he was very young.
[49:13] I can see him serve the Lord.
[49:16] Now I can say the Lord is great
[49:20] and I thank the Lord for that.
[49:24] I was amazed. I was surprised to see him
[49:26] here.
[49:28] May the Lord bless you richly.
[49:32] May the Lord bless all of you.
[49:37] We're going to share a little bit
[49:40] because I know that you don't you don't
[49:42] like to stay here longer. You don't like
[49:43] longer.
[49:45] And so I prepared myself to have a short
[49:47] service.
[49:50] So we're just going to have a little
[49:52] mass here
[49:54] and then we're going to finish
[49:57] because that's how it happens in
[49:58] Catholic church.
[50:00] In Catholic church, you go in there for
[50:03] then they say a Maria and then you go
[50:05] home.
[50:09] And we're going to try to do that a
[50:10] little bit here.
[50:13] [Music]
[50:15] But we pray that God uh that God gives
[50:17] us his grace
[50:22] so that every one of you be blessed.
[50:26] That's my heart's desire.
[50:32] Now this morning I'll be talking about
[50:35] reaching your destination. Your destiny
[50:39] reaching your destiny.
[50:46] We all came here so everybody can reach
[50:48] his destiny.
[50:52] I think we will reach we will get there.
[50:58] Now, if we just go back a little bit in
[51:00] the scriptures that we just read
[51:04] in First Samuel 13:14,
[51:06] [Music]
[51:08] God is saying here
[51:10] [Music]
[51:13] now referring to to Saul.
[51:16] He says, "But now,
[51:20] he says, "Thy kingdom shall not
[51:21] continue." As he was addressing Saul,
[51:26] says, "The Lord has sought has found a
[51:28] man after his own heart."
[51:31] [Music]
[51:35] Because remember Saul was not a man who
[51:36] was chosen by God.
[51:40] Saul was a was a choice of of man.
[51:47] And now he says, "The Lord hath sought
[51:49] him a man after his own heart.
[51:55] and the Lord has commanded him to be
[51:58] captain over his people.
[52:01] And so now remember he says the Lord
[52:04] commanded him
[52:06] to be captain over his people
[52:12] because thou has not kept that which the
[52:14] Lord commanded.
[52:16] And in the book of acts he said
[52:19] then he says after rejecting him
[52:22] so talking about soul
[52:27] he says he raised unto them king David
[52:32] and to whom he gave this testimony
[52:36] he says I found David the son of Jesse
[52:40] a man after my own heart
[52:44] which shall fulfill all my all my will.
[52:51] So, a man after God's own heart is one
[52:53] who fulfills all his will.
[52:58] So, now we're going to talk about
[52:59] reaching your destiny.
[53:04] Brother Ram says in the sermon, David
[53:06] the the the the mighty warrior,
[53:14] he says in paragraph two,
[53:16] He says, "Now
[53:21] the meeting of tonight is dedicated to
[53:24] David."
[53:27] And that's the same thing for me this
[53:28] morning.
[53:31] I will dedicate this this sermon here to
[53:34] David.
[53:39] He says, "David always has a special
[53:41] place in my heart."
[53:44] Because as he was,
[53:47] as God told him,
[53:49] he says, "A man after my after my own
[53:51] heart."
[53:56] He says, "I love to see people who know
[53:58] where they're standing."
[54:02] People who know where they're standing.
[54:06] people who know what they're talking
[54:08] about.
[54:11] He says, "I love to hear people talk
[54:15] to to people to people
[54:18] no matter who they are
[54:22] or no matter what they're talking about,
[54:26] if they know what they're talking
[54:27] about."
[54:28] And I love that.
[54:32] Someone who's sure, who knows what he's
[54:33] talking about.
[54:35] Paul said,
[54:37] says, "I knew in whom I have believed."
[54:42] So, we don't have a God that's
[54:46] we know what we're talking about.
[54:49] We know where we stand.
[54:53] We're not standing on the sand.
[54:57] We're not standing on the stones,
[55:01] but we're standing on the on the rock of
[55:05] And Christ is the rock of age.
[55:08] I'm going to tell somebody this morning
[55:13] that I I'm not even going to know the
[55:14] age of
[55:17] I want to know the rock of age.
[55:21] I want to stand on that rock
[55:26] to know people that know what they're
[55:27] talking about.
[55:30] To know people that know what they're
[55:31] talking about.
[55:33] So Christians today,
[55:37] they don't even know him whom they are.
[55:41] I want to encourage somebody
[55:45] to tell you that we believe in a mighty
[55:47] God.
[55:49] God who never failed.
[55:53] God who made infalluable promises. Amen.
[55:56] Amen.
[55:59] And if you believe in that God,
[56:02] That means there is no other power above
[56:04] that God and that God.
[56:09] He has a specific destiny for
[56:14] I want you to understand today
[56:18] that God chose David.
[56:23] I think you noticed it in the scriptures
[56:27] says, "I have found David,
[56:30] the son of Jesse,
[56:32] a man after mine own heart
[56:36] in the first scripture we read."
[56:40] [Music]
[56:41] Indeed, the Lord has sought him a man,
[56:45] a man after his own heart,
[56:49] and the Lord commanded him.
[56:52] I want this to penetrate.
[56:56] The Lord has sought himself in
[56:59] after his own heart
[57:02] and the Lord commanded him
[57:06] to be captain over his people.
[57:09] When God makes a choice,
[57:12] he also commands.
[57:14] When he gives you a destiny,
[57:17] that destination
[57:19] is eternal.
[57:22] That destination cannot
[57:25] you have to reach that destination
[57:28] because when God chooses
[57:32] he does not choose you
[57:36] chooses you before the foundation.
[57:39] He is the God
[57:42] who knows the end before the beginning.
[57:46] So he chose David
[57:49] and he gave him a destiny.
[57:53] And so when God chose you,
[57:56] he also gave you a destiny
[58:00] to to reach a goal.
[58:02] And that's what we're going to see
[58:03] today.
[58:06] So then you have to know what you're
[58:07] talking about.
[58:09] Now notice
[58:12] the same sermon,
[58:14] paragraph 25.
[58:16] He says, "Notice,
[58:20] because we're just going to talk about
[58:21] David today." Because God,
[58:25] now you know what God does?
[58:29] God can take the life of every one of us
[58:32] and he can place that life.
[58:36] He can place that life in a character in
[58:38] the Bible
[58:41] and he can bring that character and he
[58:44] can call that character David. He can
[58:46] call that character Joseph Anna
[58:50] whatever that is
[58:52] but he takes the life
[58:55] of an individual.
[58:58] He hides that life in that the character
[59:03] When you read the story
[59:06] to the point that when you read the
[59:07] story,
[59:10] you see your life in the life of that
[59:13] character.
[59:14] So then the Bible,
[59:16] the Bible is not just a story.
[59:20] It's not just telling a story.
[59:23] The Bible is the spoken word of God.
[59:27] And God takes our lives.
[59:32] He hides our lives in the character
[59:36] to the point that when you read those
[59:38] stories,
[59:39] you can see yourself in those stories.
[59:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[59:44] So then the first thing
[59:46] when you read,
[59:49] you can see yourself in there.
[59:53] Now notice that person who has a bottle.
[59:55] Jesus called them.
[59:58] He put mud on his on his eyes.
[1:00:02] He told the person
[1:00:09] go wash in the in the in the in the pool
[1:00:11] called in the river called
[1:00:14] the man was blind.
[1:00:17] He never saw himself.
[1:00:19] He never saw anything.
[1:00:22] He's never seen creation.
[1:00:25] He was blind. And God told him, he says,
[1:00:29] "Go wash it."
[1:00:31] In that river called Silo,
[1:00:34] the man went
[1:00:36] and he found the river and he bowed
[1:00:38] down.
[1:00:40] He started washing his face.
[1:00:42] When he washed his face,
[1:00:45] his eyes began to see.
[1:00:49] But what did he see first?
[1:00:52] He saw himself first.
[1:00:55] The first thing
[1:00:57] that when you read the word,
[1:01:00] you have to see yourself
[1:01:04] before looking at something else. God
[1:01:07] places your life
[1:01:10] in the characters of the Bible
[1:01:14] to the point that when you read the
[1:01:16] characters in the Bible,
[1:01:18] you see yourself in them. You see
[1:01:20] yourself in those characters.
[1:01:23] God calls those characters. He can call
[1:01:25] them Joseph.
[1:01:28] But he doesn't just want to talk about
[1:01:30] Joseph.
[1:01:32] But he hid your he
[1:01:37] And so when you see what happened to
[1:01:39] Joseph
[1:01:41] and you also see what hap what's
[1:01:43] happened to you, you understand.
[1:01:48] I knew you before the foundation
[1:01:53] your life in the life of the character
[1:01:54] called Joseph.
[1:01:57] I was preaching the sermon one somewhere
[1:02:00] one day. I was talking about Hannah.
[1:02:05] I I I saw how Hannah
[1:02:08] I said how Hannah
[1:02:13] how Hannah was was was barren for a long
[1:02:16] time
[1:02:19] and it was a shame for her not to have
[1:02:23] it was a a subject of mockery for her
[1:02:28] because all the women in Israel
[1:02:31] were mocking
[1:02:34] because she did not have a a childar.
[1:02:37] And I made a statement
[1:02:41] and I said, "You can take you can take
[1:02:44] this Bible.
[1:02:47] You can read look at this Bible as a as
[1:02:49] a
[1:02:52] when you have an album of pictures for
[1:02:56] there are different pictures of people
[1:02:58] in your family and there
[1:03:01] and you can look at the album
[1:03:04] and you can see this is
[1:03:07] my grandmother
[1:03:09] that's my sister
[1:03:12] you can identify yourself
[1:03:17] person you saw in the album,
[1:03:21] then you can say, "I I look,
[1:03:24] I look like my brother.
[1:03:26] I look like my grandfather."
[1:03:29] So when you take the Bible,
[1:03:32] when you read the Bible as an
[1:03:36] a lot of pictures in the Bible,
[1:03:39] you can take one picture,
[1:03:42] identify yourself to that picture in
[1:03:46] and there was a sister in the
[1:03:51] she was barren for 15 years and she said
[1:03:55] he said oh God
[1:03:58] I'm identifying myself tonight
[1:04:02] she said I want to be like Hannah
[1:04:06] she was she had a lot of shame
[1:04:10] but I want that tonight
[1:04:12] God gives me a
[1:04:15] And God answered her prayer
[1:04:18] and after 15 years
[1:04:20] she gave birth. Why?
[1:04:25] Because she identified herself in the
[1:04:27] character
[1:04:29] because when God takes a character for
[1:04:32] example,
[1:04:34] he's he's speaking.
[1:04:37] If you understand it, say amen.
[1:04:40] And so he says here,
[1:04:42] He says, "Notice David."
[1:04:47] Because that's the character that we're
[1:04:48] going to focus on today.
[1:04:50] David the mighty of
[1:04:52] paragraph 22. He says, "Notice.
[1:04:57] David
[1:05:00] was called by election.
[1:05:04] He was elected.
[1:05:06] He was called
[1:05:09] anointed
[1:05:10] and placed positioned.
[1:05:15] He was called,
[1:05:17] elected,
[1:05:19] anointed,
[1:05:21] and positioned.
[1:05:24] He was elected by God.
[1:05:29] He was called from the the sheeps that
[1:05:33] he was taken care of.
[1:05:37] He was called from the sheeps that he
[1:05:39] was taking care of
[1:05:43] to be to to be become anointed. No,
[1:05:48] to become a king
[1:05:50] to become king anointed.
[1:05:56] Positioned.
[1:06:03] I want you to notice
[1:06:06] And I'm talking I'm addressing
[1:06:07] Christians.
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:11] I'm addressing people who have believed
[1:06:12] the the me the message of the end time.
[1:06:15] David David
[1:06:19] was called
[1:06:22] by election.
[1:06:25] [Music]
[1:06:27] So when God calls by election,
[1:06:31] it's not you.
[1:06:34] You're not the one who chose God.
[1:06:37] It's God who chose you.
[1:06:42] It's God who elected you.
[1:06:45] It's not me.
[1:06:47] I did not choose God,
[1:06:50] but it's God
[1:06:52] chose me.
[1:06:55] Now look in the in the Garden of Eden
[1:06:59] when Adam sinned.
[1:07:04] It's not Adam
[1:07:07] who went to look to search for God.
[1:07:11] But it's God
[1:07:13] who came down
[1:07:15] and he was crying. Adam,
[1:07:19] where are where are you?
[1:07:22] Why?
[1:07:26] Because Adam was the works of his hands.
[1:07:32] And so when God elected you,
[1:07:36] when God chose you,
[1:07:39] God can never lose you.
[1:07:45] Because he chooses through election
[1:07:49] take for example.
[1:07:51] I'm going take this piece of paper
[1:07:55] to show you election.
[1:07:58] This piece of paper
[1:08:01] It's a it's a
[1:08:04] it's a paper just like any other paper.
[1:08:07] Now God,
[1:08:12] God has a plan in his mind.
[1:08:16] He wants
[1:08:18] he wants that with a piece of paper.
[1:08:22] He wants to design to have to design
[1:08:25] something in there. But
[1:08:29] He has this this purpose in his mind,
[1:08:34] but he wants to to bring this to to
[1:08:36] bring this to a reality
[1:08:39] on this piece of paper.
[1:08:41] It's like it's like a sewer.
[1:08:44] It's a tailor. A tailor.
[1:08:47] It's like a tailor.
[1:08:51] He takes a piece of clothes.
[1:08:54] But now,
[1:08:57] he takes a model,
[1:08:59] a a model that he has. And now
[1:09:04] the model that he has,
[1:09:07] the model that he that he
[1:09:10] has that in his mind,
[1:09:13] but he wants to realize that model.
[1:09:18] He wants everybody to see what was in
[1:09:20] his mind.
[1:09:22] So what is he going to do?
[1:09:25] He takes the clothes
[1:09:31] and he put it on. He put it on the
[1:09:34] clothes.
[1:09:36] He put it on the clothes.
[1:09:38] And he takes
[1:09:41] he takes the scissors.
[1:09:44] He start cutting clothes.
[1:09:47] But notice,
[1:09:49] it's going to make you rejoice.
[1:09:52] It's the same paper.
[1:09:56] But there is parts in this paper
[1:10:00] that will fall off.
[1:10:03] But there's other parts of the paper
[1:10:07] that will stay in the design.
[1:10:13] The pieces of the paper that fall off.
[1:10:15] Now pay attention.
[1:10:18] The piece of paper that fall off did
[1:10:20] nothing to fall.
[1:10:26] And the pieces that remain in the plan.
[1:10:31] They also did nothing to remain in the
[1:10:34] plan.
[1:10:35] [Applause]
[1:10:36] Everything was done by the will of God.
[1:10:41] The ones that fell off,
[1:10:43] it was also the will of God.
[1:10:46] The ones who stayed,
[1:10:49] they were elected
[1:10:52] to make to be part
[1:10:55] to be part of
[1:10:58] to be part of the will of God.
[1:11:01] And that's what election is.
[1:11:05] God has elected you
[1:11:09] as he elected David David.
[1:11:13] Now listen
[1:11:15] he positioned he placed David
[1:11:18] [Music]
[1:11:20] elected by God.
[1:11:23] I want
[1:11:26] I want that this does not go on top of
[1:11:28] your head
[1:11:31] elected by God.
[1:11:34] Now pay attention.
[1:11:39] He was called from the the sheeps that
[1:11:42] he was taking care of.
[1:11:47] Called from the sheeps that he was
[1:11:49] hurting
[1:11:51] [Music]
[1:11:52] to become a king
[1:11:58] from the weakest position.
[1:12:03] to the highest position.
[1:12:08] God
[1:12:12] does not look at the position that you
[1:12:14] are current.
[1:12:17] God looks at the predestination.
[1:12:22] He looks at your destination.
[1:12:25] David David
[1:12:30] was a man who was hurting his sheeps.
[1:12:34] And you know
[1:12:37] to hurt your sheeps.
[1:12:41] Harding the sheeps was the the the
[1:12:43] lowest task.
[1:12:47] It was the lowest
[1:12:49] job in Israel.
[1:12:52] What was David doing?
[1:12:55] He was always in the bushes.
[1:13:00] He was eating honey and uh and bees.
[1:13:07] He he had
[1:13:10] he he was his his clothes were were were
[1:13:12] smelling he his clothes were smelling.
[1:13:20] He did not He didn't know.
[1:13:23] He didn't know how was the king.
[1:13:27] He did not know.
[1:13:30] But God
[1:13:32] when he called David,
[1:13:36] the purpose that God had for David
[1:13:41] was that David had to become a king.
[1:13:49] No matter the lowest position that he
[1:13:51] had,
[1:13:55] no matter the position that he had,
[1:13:59] But in the thought of God,
[1:14:03] God elected,
[1:14:05] he chose David
[1:14:09] to leave the position where he was
[1:14:13] to be to become a king.
[1:14:17] Now sometimes things appear to be
[1:14:19] impossible,
[1:14:20] but for God,
[1:14:22] there's no impossibilities.
[1:14:30] Now, am I making myself understood?
[1:14:33] Now, notice David.
[1:14:35] David was there. Bruce, he was in the in
[1:14:38] the in the in the bush.
[1:14:44] Now, every morning he would wake up.
[1:14:47] He'll take careard his sheets.
[1:14:52] Every morning he would wake up.
[1:14:59] you know, take away uh remove all the
[1:15:01] the the all the the animal wild animals
[1:15:04] that will that that wanted to eat his
[1:15:08] that was his job.
[1:15:12] Bible doesn't tell us how long he was
[1:15:14] doing that.
[1:15:19] I don't care how long you've been in the
[1:15:21] situation where you are,
[1:15:24] but one day will a day will come
[1:15:28] where God will put an end to it. He is
[1:15:31] God and he does not change.
[1:15:37] Every morning when David would wake up,
[1:15:41] what was David doing?
[1:15:44] He was always behind his sheeps.
[1:15:47] He was thinking.
[1:15:53] So he was thinking
[1:15:56] that that was his job.
[1:16:00] David was thinking
[1:16:05] he was thinking that there wouldn't be a
[1:16:07] change in what he was doing.
[1:16:11] He he was born
[1:16:15] and so he always had to take care of his
[1:16:16] sheeps.
[1:16:18] He was smelling the smell of his sheep.
[1:16:21] He was eating like his sheeps were
[1:16:23] eating.
[1:16:24] And that's all he knew. How
[1:16:27] he did not know that one day
[1:16:32] that there will be a change in his life.
[1:16:36] I want us to tell somebody
[1:16:39] that you can be what what you are
[1:16:42] but that's not the end.
[1:16:46] You don't know what God said.
[1:16:49] But I want to tell somebody today
[1:16:53] that you have to reach your destiny.
[1:16:58] David was there
[1:17:00] working.
[1:17:05] He was taking care of his sheeps.
[1:17:08] But he never knew.
[1:17:11] That's my good news to you.
[1:17:14] He did not know that in heaven.
[1:17:19] Someone else had a thought for him.
[1:17:24] Anyone could look at David.
[1:17:26] They they couldn't look down on him.
[1:17:32] That could think he was nothing but a
[1:17:34] person who was hurting and
[1:17:36] but in heaven
[1:17:38] there was somebody
[1:17:40] who had a different vision for him.
[1:17:44] I want that in heaven
[1:17:46] that someone thinks about you in a
[1:17:48] different way.
[1:17:53] Someone else in heaven,
[1:17:56] had a thought,
[1:17:58] had a different thought on David.
[1:18:03] He says elected by God
[1:18:09] called from the sheeps that he was
[1:18:11] hering.
[1:18:14] to become a king.
[1:18:22] He did not get into a school to become a
[1:18:25] king.
[1:18:28] He did not have a degree to become a
[1:18:30] king.
[1:18:32] But God,
[1:18:35] God who called him, God,
[1:18:39] he knew that David
[1:18:41] would become a king. And God,
[1:18:48] God could put all the possibilities,
[1:18:53] everything school could,
[1:18:57] but God could put it in David.
[1:19:00] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:05] God can change everything in a minute.
[1:19:08] I'm going to say that again.
[1:19:11] God can change everything this morning.
[1:19:17] Now look at Moses.
[1:19:19] Moses.
[1:19:22] When Moses was in Egypt
[1:19:25] for 40 years, brother Brham says,
[1:19:30] he says he he he made an effort
[1:19:35] to save the children of Israel.
[1:19:38] But that did not stand
[1:19:41] until he got scared. He fled.
[1:19:47] He he did not have enough courage. He
[1:19:49] fled from Egypt. Brother Bram says,
[1:19:55] brother says he started the business of
[1:19:58] uh of the animals
[1:20:01] but they but God
[1:20:05] but God had a different thoughts for
[1:20:06] Moses.
[1:20:09] So when Moses met God
[1:20:12] in the pillar of fire,
[1:20:15] in one minute,
[1:20:17] change me to
[1:20:20] courage came out.
[1:20:23] In one minute of meeting God,
[1:20:26] anything can change.
[1:20:29] Your entire life can change.
[1:20:35] Moses
[1:20:38] became a different person.
[1:20:43] Now notice my brethren
[1:20:45] to the point that
[1:20:49] that even God told Moses
[1:20:54] he says now that you stroke the rock
[1:20:58] and the rock gave its water.
[1:21:01] But now next time
[1:21:03] he says don't strike the rock
[1:21:06] speak to the rock
[1:21:09] because the rock has already been
[1:21:11] stroked.
[1:21:13] speak to the rock
[1:21:15] and the rock will give its water.
[1:21:18] That's a story that we all know.
[1:21:22] But I want to look at it from a
[1:21:24] different perspective.
[1:21:27] Moses came
[1:21:30] instead of speaking to the rock,
[1:21:33] he stroke the rock.
[1:21:36] Not just once,
[1:21:38] two times
[1:21:40] he stroke the rock.
[1:21:42] Now pay attention to what I'm saying.
[1:21:45] Moses
[1:21:48] disobeyed God.
[1:21:51] But
[1:21:53] what did God do?
[1:21:59] Despite Moses disobeying God,
[1:22:04] water came out of the rock still.
[1:22:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:22:12] God did not look.
[1:22:16] He did not look at the disobedience of
[1:22:18] Moses.
[1:22:19] God said, he says it's true, Moses. You
[1:22:23] disobeyed.
[1:22:26] I told you to speak,
[1:22:28] but you stroke the rock.
[1:22:31] But despite that,
[1:22:34] I'm still going to bring water from the
[1:22:35] rock so that people know that me,
[1:22:41] that I called you, that I chose you,
[1:22:44] that I commissioned you.
[1:22:46] You need to reach.
[1:22:50] I don't care what you
[1:22:53] if it's the destiny of God,
[1:22:56] you will reach your destination
[1:22:59] [Applause]
[1:23:01] because God
[1:23:05] can never change his thoughts about his
[1:23:08] word.
[1:23:10] I want somebody to say amen.
[1:23:17] Says Moses
[1:23:19] I chose you.
[1:23:22] I I'm telling you
[1:23:25] to not strike the rock but to speak.
[1:23:29] But you did not obey me.
[1:23:33] If I don't bring water out of this rock
[1:23:37] then people
[1:23:39] will mock me. They're going to say
[1:23:44] but water didn't come out of the rock.
[1:23:45] So what are we going to do?
[1:23:48] Because,
[1:23:50] because I chose you,
[1:23:53] because I elected you, because I
[1:23:56] commissioned you,
[1:23:58] water will still come out of the rock
[1:24:01] and people will see that you, Moses,
[1:24:05] that you're my servant.
[1:24:10] And people will see
[1:24:13] that my purpose never fail.
[1:24:17] Sometimes
[1:24:21] don't look at the mistakes that you
[1:24:23] made.
[1:24:25] Sometimes
[1:24:29] don't look at your past life.
[1:24:33] Leave the past behind and
[1:24:37] let's look at the future.
[1:24:41] Let's not talk about the past.
[1:24:44] Let's talk about the present and the
[1:24:46] future.
[1:24:52] God can take you.
[1:24:58] He can get you from the lowest position
[1:25:00] that you are occupying
[1:25:03] so that you
[1:25:06] so you can fulfill his purpose.
[1:25:12] You did not come into this message uh
[1:25:14] just out of nowhere.
[1:25:18] You came in this message
[1:25:21] because God has a purpose for you
[1:25:25] and God will fulfill that purpose. Let's
[1:25:28] continue the reading of the
[1:25:32] message. In the same message,
[1:25:35] he asked a question.
[1:25:36] [Music]
[1:25:39] He says, "How many Christians there are
[1:25:40] to right here?"
[1:25:44] It's still paragraph 25.
[1:25:47] He says, "How many Christians are here?"
[1:25:50] He says, "Raise your hand if you're a
[1:25:52] Christian."
[1:25:53] Now listen.
[1:25:56] Now, this makes me feel good.
[1:26:01] He says, "You're not a Christian by your
[1:26:02] desire.
[1:26:06] You're a Christian
[1:26:09] by God's desire.
[1:26:12] Amen. Brother says amen to it.
[1:26:16] You are a Christian
[1:26:20] by God's desire.
[1:26:23] It's not yourself.
[1:26:26] You did not desire to be a Christian.
[1:26:31] But God put in you
[1:26:34] a a a hunger.
[1:26:36] He put in you a hunger, a thirst.
[1:26:41] He put on in you a desire
[1:26:44] to become a Christian.
[1:26:47] He says, "No man can come to me
[1:26:51] except my father draws him first.
[1:26:56] You are elected by God.
[1:27:00] before the foundation of the world
[1:27:04] to be a Christian.
[1:27:07] He says that's the scripture.
[1:27:14] You have been elected by God
[1:27:18] before the foundation of the world
[1:27:22] to be a Christian.
[1:27:25] That's the scripture.
[1:27:31] and you will become it.
[1:27:37] Sometimes it may not work today, but
[1:27:42] because it's the purpose of God,
[1:27:45] you will become it.
[1:27:50] May I say to somebody
[1:27:53] that even even if
[1:27:56] that even if you're not a Christian
[1:27:58] right now, even if
[1:28:02] even two minutes before you die,
[1:28:06] you will become a Christian then
[1:28:09] because the purpose of God
[1:28:12] can never fail.
[1:28:15] It's him.
[1:28:19] He isn't He's the one who put in us the
[1:28:21] the the want and the the want to do
[1:28:23] something.
[1:28:26] He produc in us the want
[1:28:30] and and and the do the the the action,
[1:28:33] the doings.
[1:28:35] He's in us who produ he produces that in
[1:28:38] us.
[1:28:39] There's no one here.
[1:28:44] There's no one here who can make his own
[1:28:46] decision. I want to become a Christian.
[1:28:49] You can never do it.
[1:28:53] God,
[1:28:54] God must choose you. He must elect you
[1:29:00] to become a Christian
[1:29:02] and God will put in you
[1:29:06] everything you need
[1:29:09] for you to become that. And God will do
[1:29:12] it. He says,
[1:29:18] he says something here.
[1:29:21] He says,
[1:29:23] "In the sermon, my my angel will walk
[1:29:25] before you."
[1:29:29] 1953
[1:29:32] he says paragraph 12
[1:29:35] [Music]
[1:29:36] he says if God wants
[1:29:41] if God wants you to become a certain
[1:29:43] thing
[1:29:46] he will bring you on this earth
[1:29:50] to become that
[1:29:54] that's what you will become
[1:30:00] If God wants you to become something,
[1:30:07] he will bring you to this earth,
[1:30:11] to become that thing.
[1:30:14] That's what you will become.
[1:30:24] No matter the situation that you're
[1:30:26] going through,
[1:30:29] if that situation,
[1:30:32] [Music]
[1:30:35] if that situation is not what God
[1:30:37] predestinated for your life,
[1:30:40] that situation
[1:30:42] will finish, will end.
[1:30:45] And God,
[1:30:48] God will see it will have a change in
[1:30:50] your life.
[1:30:54] David was there.
[1:30:56] He was always behind the the the the
[1:30:58] animals.
[1:31:01] David thought that was his job.
[1:31:05] But in heaven,
[1:31:07] someone else
[1:31:10] had a different thought on David.
[1:31:17] Then he called his prophet. He said, he
[1:31:21] said, "Take your your your oil.
[1:31:26] Go in the house of Jesse."
[1:31:31] I saw in his house
[1:31:34] a man
[1:31:36] who will become king.
[1:31:40] Go anoint that man.
[1:31:46] Because if God wants you to become
[1:31:48] something,
[1:31:51] He will bring you on this earth
[1:31:54] to become that thing.
[1:31:57] And that's what you will become.
[1:32:06] God did not bring David on earth just to
[1:32:08] to to hurry his sheep. No. No.
[1:32:12] But God brought David
[1:32:16] to become a king.
[1:32:19] And when the time was fixed
[1:32:23] for David to become king,
[1:32:28] God put put his hand on the button
[1:32:35] so that everything works.
[1:32:42] Yes.
[1:32:43] [Music]
[1:32:47] God wants that. He wants that every one
[1:32:49] of us reach his destiny.
[1:32:55] I was traveling one day, brother.
[1:33:00] I was in England
[1:33:02] in Utro.
[1:33:08] Now Utro is one of the biggest airports
[1:33:10] in Europe.
[1:33:15] busy and it's a very busy airport
[1:33:19] and there's a lot of people there.
[1:33:25] And to the point that if you have a a
[1:33:27] little kid like Manathan,
[1:33:30] he's he's he's very uh he's very active
[1:33:35] and if you don't keep him with you,
[1:33:39] you can lose him in the crowd.
[1:33:43] But I noticed something.
[1:33:48] I saw a father with a child who was
[1:33:50] under 10 years 10 years old. And I
[1:33:53] noticed
[1:33:58] and I noticed that uh on the
[1:34:02] the waist of the of the of the child,
[1:34:07] he put he put a belt around that the
[1:34:09] waist of that child.
[1:34:14] And then the other side. So he he had a
[1:34:16] he had like a leash that he was uh that
[1:34:18] he was walking that that was uh that
[1:34:20] that was on the child.
[1:34:23] And so I was like, what is this father
[1:34:25] doing?
[1:34:30] He was uh holding his child as if as if
[1:34:33] as you as you hold a dog on the leash.
[1:34:37] And so I wanted to understand,
[1:34:40] I wanted to see.
[1:34:43] I saw the father.
[1:34:46] And so that that that cord was long
[1:34:49] cord.
[1:34:54] And so the father was in front of the
[1:34:56] the
[1:34:59] and he was he was filling his documents
[1:35:01] for his for his trip.
[1:35:04] And just like any young man
[1:35:09] and his young uh child was uh playing
[1:35:11] around.
[1:35:13] He was jumping on the on the the chairs
[1:35:17] [Music]
[1:35:19] on the chairs that were at the airport.
[1:35:22] He was moving playing. He was playing
[1:35:24] around
[1:35:27] and the the the father was not worried.
[1:35:32] He was not even looking paying attention
[1:35:34] to the child.
[1:35:36] [Music]
[1:35:39] But he was feeling that he was feeling
[1:35:41] an attraction in his hand.
[1:35:44] And so as long as he felt an attraction
[1:35:46] in his hand,
[1:35:49] he knew that his child was was there on
[1:35:51] on the other side. And so I looked.
[1:35:55] He said, "When the man finished,
[1:35:59] he took all his stuff.
[1:36:02] He put he he put it on on him.
[1:36:05] And so he was about to leave. And as he
[1:36:08] was about to leave,
[1:36:11] I saw that he was pressing a button on
[1:36:13] his hands.
[1:36:17] And when when he pressed the button, I
[1:36:19] think it was something like
[1:36:26] it was like a remote
[1:36:29] and he pressed it. when he pressed it,
[1:36:34] I saw the cord that was now that was now
[1:36:36] coming back to him.
[1:36:39] And as the cord was coming back to him,
[1:36:42] as he was holding the child on that
[1:36:44] leash,
[1:36:47] so the leash was coming back to with the
[1:36:49] kid
[1:36:52] and then the child got closer to him.
[1:36:55] Then he took his hand and they walked
[1:36:56] in. And where I was,
[1:37:00] I was I said, "Glory to God."
[1:37:03] I understood one thing.
[1:37:07] God put a cord of security around me.
[1:37:14] You can you can go
[1:37:18] you can go further away from God.
[1:37:21] But when God needs you,
[1:37:25] he just pressed on that remote
[1:37:28] and you're going to come back to him.
[1:37:31] The purpose of God will never fail.
[1:37:38] You have to reach your purpose.
[1:37:43] Even if you put hands in your pocket and
[1:37:46] said, "It's over with this God." But if
[1:37:51] If you have been in the mind of God, you
[1:37:54] have been chosen, elected by God,
[1:37:58] God will bring you back. No matter,
[1:38:02] no matter what, God will bring you back.
[1:38:06] [Music]
[1:38:07] Because if God wants you to become
[1:38:09] something,
[1:38:12] he will bring you on this earth,
[1:38:16] to become that thing.
[1:38:19] That's what you will becomeless.
[1:38:22] And he placed David
[1:38:25] to become king.
[1:38:31] And when time the time was when the time
[1:38:33] was right, the man in heaven,
[1:38:39] he pressed on that remote. He pressed
[1:38:41] the button on that remote
[1:38:46] and he put in action his planet.
[1:38:51] The prophets came out.
[1:38:54] You understand what I'm talking about?
[1:38:59] The prophets came out
[1:39:01] Samuel
[1:39:02] and he told Samuel,
[1:39:06] he says, "Go in the house of Jesse.
[1:39:10] I saw one of his child
[1:39:15] who has to become king
[1:39:20] during that time.
[1:39:23] David was not uh understanding it.
[1:39:28] He was always hurting his his sheets.
[1:39:33] But he did not know that someone thought
[1:39:35] otherwise of him.
[1:39:38] And that's what you are.
[1:39:40] You are taking care of what you take
[1:39:42] care of. But I came here to tell you
[1:39:46] that someone has a different thoughts
[1:39:48] for you.
[1:39:53] And he came
[1:39:57] and he went in the house of Jesse.
[1:40:01] Jesse,
[1:40:03] God brought me here.
[1:40:07] There's someone in your house
[1:40:10] who has to become king.
[1:40:13] Then Jesse said,
[1:40:16] he says, "Well, I think it's my first
[1:40:18] born."
[1:40:20] He's tall.
[1:40:24] He has a degree in the theology.
[1:40:28] I think he'll do the work. And so they
[1:40:31] brought they brought their brother when
[1:40:33] he came.
[1:40:37] Now Samuel was about to pour his oil on
[1:40:39] him. But God told him, "Stop. Stop.
[1:40:44] I have not chosen him.
[1:40:49] Despite his his height,
[1:40:52] despite his height,
[1:40:55] despite uh him having his head high, but
[1:40:59] I did not choose him."
[1:41:02] So they called the second one.
[1:41:04] Same thing repeated. They brought the
[1:41:07] third one.
[1:41:08] Same thing.
[1:41:13] That's because God does not look at the
[1:41:15] the
[1:41:17] God does not look at the outward
[1:41:18] appearance,
[1:41:20] but he looks at the heart.
[1:41:26] He He looks at the the the spirit.
[1:41:32] disposition. He looks at He looks at the
[1:41:35] the the the
[1:41:37] He looks at what you think what you
[1:41:39] think in your spirit.
[1:41:42] He looks at what you think in your
[1:41:43] heart. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:48] The fifth one came,
[1:41:52] the sixth came
[1:41:57] because Jesse had eight.
[1:42:00] The seventh came
[1:42:04] all the seven church ages went passed
[1:42:06] by.
[1:42:08] But the eighth one,
[1:42:11] the age
[1:42:13] in the age,
[1:42:17] the the the the the the
[1:42:20] little
[1:42:21] the little time,
[1:42:23] the the short time
[1:42:27] before the church leaves the earth,
[1:42:34] David came
[1:42:39] I loved
[1:42:42] now. I love what Samuel said that day
[1:42:47] and he told Jesse,
[1:42:52] he says, "Is this all your children?"
[1:43:01] I want you to understand the the
[1:43:03] comments of brother Branim on this.
[1:43:06] Brother Brham said,
[1:43:09] he says, Jesse said,
[1:43:12] he says, "Oh,
[1:43:14] that's all the children I have."
[1:43:18] He forgot David.
[1:43:27] I want to tell somebody,
[1:43:32] even if people forget about you,
[1:43:36] God does not forget about you.
[1:43:42] God does not for does not forget the per
[1:43:45] the plan that he has for you.
[1:43:49] And then
[1:43:51] and Jesse said
[1:43:54] ah
[1:43:56] he says oh yes
[1:43:58] I remember
[1:44:01] there's a little guy there
[1:44:04] but he's not here.
[1:44:06] He is uh he's in the in the in the the
[1:44:08] bushes.
[1:44:11] But look at what Samuel says. He says
[1:44:14] that's glorious my brothers. He says
[1:44:19] He says, "Let's stop everything we're
[1:44:21] doing right now.
[1:44:24] We cannot go further
[1:44:27] as long as he's not here.
[1:44:30] Go find him.
[1:44:34] God can stop his plan
[1:44:37] until you come in
[1:44:41] because you are you are the peace,
[1:44:45] the peace that has to attest.
[1:44:48] Do you understand what I'm talking
[1:44:49] about?
[1:44:51] That piece,
[1:44:53] that part, that part has to be there.
[1:44:55] Amen.
[1:44:57] The prophet, the prophet Samuel Samuel,
[1:45:03] he put he put down his uh oil, the the
[1:45:05] oil that he says, "We will not go
[1:45:08] further
[1:45:11] as long as that man is not here yet.
[1:45:17] David was able to stop the plan of God.
[1:45:22] You can stop the program of God.
[1:45:29] until you fulfill the entire will of
[1:45:31] God.
[1:45:34] And when God sees that everything is
[1:45:36] fulfilled,
[1:45:37] then he says then we can go for forward.
[1:45:40] Amen.
[1:45:42] Is this is this is this for somebody
[1:45:44] here tonight?
[1:45:48] David in that time,
[1:45:52] he was still hurting his sheeps.
[1:45:55] He was in a valley
[1:45:57] where he was hurting his sheets but on
[1:46:00] the mountain.
[1:46:03] Samuel sent somebody
[1:46:06] said go call him
[1:46:10] because we cannot walk further without
[1:46:13] him.
[1:46:16] and David where he was.
[1:46:19] He heard someone on the mountain.
[1:46:22] Someone called David. David, David,
[1:46:27] what is happening?
[1:46:29] What is there something? He says, David,
[1:46:34] I have a message for you.
[1:46:37] Someone came to tell you
[1:46:40] that the life of hurting the sheep is
[1:46:43] over.
[1:46:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:46:48] There was a message
[1:46:50] that came
[1:46:52] from the prophets.
[1:46:56] I have a message that came from the
[1:46:58] prophets that your life is over.
[1:47:03] There must be a change.
[1:47:08] No matter the lowest position that you
[1:47:10] have, God can lift you up.
[1:47:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:47:18] Whether everybody rejects
[1:47:21] whether everybody rejects you,
[1:47:25] that does not change the will of God.
[1:47:30] [Music]
[1:47:32] Whether everybody looks down on you,
[1:47:35] it does not change the plan of God.
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:40] Because if God wants you to become
[1:47:42] something,
[1:47:45] he will place you on this earth
[1:47:48] to become that thing.
[1:47:51] He says in the sermon, shame,
[1:47:56] shame because of his word. He said,
[1:48:02] he says you will always have the shame
[1:48:03] on you
[1:48:05] to be tested.
[1:48:08] Every man that comes to Christ
[1:48:13] must be first trained as a child
[1:48:20] for him to get to the purpose that God
[1:48:23] that God called him for.
[1:48:25] So then David
[1:48:29] was in training.
[1:48:32] He was being trained
[1:48:37] for the purpose that God called him for.
[1:48:41] I know that you may be in training right
[1:48:42] now.
[1:48:46] I don't know why. For what purpose?
[1:48:50] But I know that the life that you're
[1:48:51] going through right now is a training.
[1:48:56] It's for the purpose that God called you
[1:48:58] for. And remember,
[1:49:02] If you can just remain still, remember,
[1:49:09] if he called you for a purpose and
[1:49:12] listen,
[1:49:16] if he called you for a purpose,
[1:49:22] nothing can stop it from happening.
[1:49:29] May can I can I repeat it?
[1:49:34] If he called you for a purpose,
[1:49:39] there is nothing.
[1:49:42] Nothing means nothing.
[1:49:46] There is nothing that can stop it from
[1:49:49] happening.
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:54] He says there is not enough demon in a
[1:49:56] torment place
[1:50:00] to stop the word of God being
[1:50:03] manifested.
[1:50:05] You have been born with a purpose
[1:50:10] and no one can take your place.
[1:50:16] That place,
[1:50:18] that place that you have, the blessing
[1:50:20] that you have,
[1:50:22] belongs to you. It belongs to you.
[1:50:27] And no one can take it away from you. If
[1:50:30] it's yours, that means it's yours.
[1:50:33] And no one will take it away from you.
[1:50:38] There's no demon.
[1:50:40] There's no demon. Amen.
[1:50:45] I'm going to say it again. No, there is
[1:50:47] no demon.
[1:50:51] There's not enough demons
[1:50:54] in the place of torment
[1:50:57] that will be able to stop the word from
[1:50:59] from being manifested.
[1:51:03] You have been born in a purpose
[1:51:06] and no one
[1:51:09] no one
[1:51:12] Nobody can take your place.
[1:51:18] You might have impersonators
[1:51:21] and everything else,
[1:51:25] but they will never take your place.
[1:51:29] That's true.
[1:51:31] God's word will triumph.
[1:51:35] It cannot fail.
[1:51:39] Now, people can act like you.
[1:51:42] But they're not you. People can
[1:51:44] impersonate you, but they're not you.
[1:51:48] God will wait
[1:51:50] because that blessing belongs to you.
[1:51:56] That blessing will only come on you.
[1:52:00] No one will take it from you. Brother
[1:52:02] Ram says,
[1:52:06] he says that is where every Christian
[1:52:08] should stand.
[1:52:10] The the the the the trials will come
[1:52:16] and you're going to see see it in many
[1:52:18] all kinds of callers. But God, remember
[1:52:24] God has a purpose
[1:52:28] and it all will work right.
[1:52:35] It will it will it will work as as it
[1:52:37] should work.
[1:52:41] God will do
[1:52:43] God will do everything.
[1:52:46] He's going to take this thing. He's
[1:52:48] going to take that thing
[1:52:51] that he will put things together.
[1:52:55] You may see it as a as a trial,
[1:53:01] but God is preparing you for the for the
[1:53:03] purpose that he that he called you for.
[1:53:07] Do not underestimate yourself.
[1:53:11] God called you.
[1:53:13] God elected you
[1:53:16] as a as an eagle.
[1:53:19] So that you have high ambitions.
[1:53:24] You're not chickens.
[1:53:27] You need to have high ambitions
[1:53:31] now.
[1:53:33] As I'm about to finish,
[1:53:38] the Bible says in Psalm Psalm 118 verse1
[1:53:41] 17,
[1:53:45] now this is a psalm of my life.
[1:53:50] Psalm 118 verse1 17.
[1:53:53] I want this to penetrate you.
[1:53:57] The Bible says,
[1:53:59] "I shall not die,
[1:54:02] but I live
[1:54:06] and declare the works of the Lord
[1:54:11] before the purpose is reached.
[1:54:14] I refuse to die.
[1:54:17] [Music]
[1:54:20] before the purpose of God.
[1:54:23] Before that purpose of God,
[1:54:26] I refuse to die.
[1:54:29] I will live
[1:54:32] and I will tell
[1:54:34] the works of the Lord,
[1:54:38] some of you here,
[1:54:40] you have a story to tell.
[1:54:43] You have a testimony today.
[1:54:46] You have a book written. Refuse
[1:54:49] to die
[1:54:52] before you have realized your dream.
[1:55:00] You have the right to dream.
[1:55:05] And you have the right to see your
[1:55:06] dreams being realized.
[1:55:09] I refused to die.
[1:55:13] John refused to die
[1:55:17] until he wrote the book of revelations.
[1:55:21] He said,
[1:55:23] he says, "God sent me
[1:55:26] to write the books of Revelation."
[1:55:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:55:30] They took John, they put him in the oil,
[1:55:34] a hot oil. John did not die. He refused
[1:55:38] to die
[1:55:41] until he wrote the book. And tonight
[1:55:45] I refuse
[1:55:47] I refuse to die
[1:55:50] until
[1:55:53] I will tell again
[1:55:56] the things
[1:55:58] the reason why
[1:56:01] our God Jesus
[1:56:03] I refuse to die.
[1:56:06] I will continue to walk with God.
[1:56:10] I will not die.
[1:56:13] Tell somebody.
[1:56:15] Tell somebody you refuse to die.
[1:56:18] Shake your brother's hands that's next
[1:56:20] to you. Tell him.
[1:56:23] I refuse to die.
[1:56:26] You have a lot of things to tell.
[1:56:29] You have a lot of things to tell.
[1:56:32] God is still
[1:56:35] He's still writing in your life.
[1:56:38] God is still
[1:56:40] He's not done yet.
[1:56:42] He's not done writing the book.
[1:56:46] God is not done.
[1:56:49] The story continues.
[1:56:51] The road turns.
[1:56:54] Things are coming.
[1:56:57] You will reach your destiny.
[1:56:59] You will get there.
[1:57:02] Let me finish.
[1:57:04] Let me finish.
[1:57:06] In the book of Isaiah 48:18,
[1:57:11] he says, "Do not look back at past
[1:57:13] events
[1:57:17] and do not look at old things.
[1:57:20] Do not consider.
[1:57:24] Do not look at the difficult things.
[1:57:28] Do not consider
[1:57:31] and do not consider the things. Behold,
[1:57:36] I will do a new thing.
[1:57:39] I shall.
[1:57:42] Will you not know it? Now listen, my
[1:57:44] friend.
[1:57:46] I will make a way in the wilderness
[1:57:50] and rivers, in the desert.
[1:57:54] Where there is no way,
[1:57:56] God can open the way.
[1:57:59] Do not look
[1:58:01] at your mistake at your failures.
[1:58:04] Do not talk about your failures,
[1:58:07] but talk about what God has done for
[1:58:09] you.
[1:58:10] May the God of heaven bless you richly.

[2:11:31] oh God. Thank you for your hand on us,
[2:11:34] oh Lord, reminding us of what you tell
[2:11:37] us in your word, oh God, that nothing
[2:11:40] can stop us from reaching our destiny.
[2:11:42] Oh Lord, thank you father for your
[2:11:45] servant who has put himself by the side
[2:11:49] so you could come and speak to us. Oh
[2:11:51] father god, thank you Lord. Now we know
[2:11:54] without a shadow of doubt that there is
[2:11:57] not enough demons in hell
[2:12:01] that can stop us from what you have
[2:12:02] purposed for us. Oh God,
[2:12:05] look at your children, oh God, who have
[2:12:07] their hands raised.
[2:12:09] You know their different needs.
[2:12:12] Lord, you know there are different
[2:12:14] diseases. Oh God, you know each and
[2:12:17] every need that's beneath each and every
[2:12:19] raised hand. Oh God, I pray that you
[2:12:21] stretch forth your hand, oh Lord. Touch
[2:12:24] your children.
[2:12:26] Provide for your children, oh God.
[2:12:29] Give answers to your children, oh Lord,
[2:12:32] because we know you never fail.
[2:12:35] Father, we put ourselves into your
[2:12:37] hands.
[2:12:39] We have your way in our lives.
[2:12:43] No matter the obstacles,
[2:12:45] we know we will make it
[2:12:48] because we are in the master's hand.
[2:12:52] Lord, you know, Satan is always trying
[2:12:53] to come in contact
[2:12:56] to make us think that we are not bride
[2:13:00] to make us think that we are not going
[2:13:01] to make it.
[2:13:04] We thank you for your word that we are
[2:13:05] standing on
[2:13:08] because you are not a man that you
[2:13:09] should lie.
[2:13:11] Neither should you repent.
[2:13:14] So we know if your word says we will
[2:13:16] make it
[2:13:18] destination
[2:13:21] our destiny. We know nothing can stop.
[2:13:25] Oh Lord as we leave this place.
[2:13:28] Please keep that constant reminder in
[2:13:30] our hearts oh God
[2:13:32] so that we know
[2:13:35] that in our lives wherever we are
[2:13:37] walking
[2:13:39] in our workplace
[2:13:41] our boss cannot stop us from our destiny
[2:13:46] stop us from reaching our destiny
[2:13:50] we did it for David oh Lord
[2:13:53] we know you can do it in our lives
[2:13:56] we raise our hands unto you
[2:13:59] saying come and have full preeminence in
[2:14:01] our lives.
[2:14:03] We know you didn't bring us on this
[2:14:04] earth just to leave and
[2:14:07] you have a special purpose on each and
[2:14:09] every one of your children.
[2:14:12] Reveal that to us this
[2:14:16] because we want to work in your word. We
[2:14:19] want to be your purpose
[2:14:22] which can never ever be defeated
[2:14:26] in Jesus Christ's mighty name we pray.
[2:14:29] Say thank you for your servant oh Lord.
[2:14:32] Lord I pray that you restore the virtue
[2:14:35] that has left him.
