[0:00] our nose it's been wonderful I know my
[0:08] subject tonight is going to look kind of
[0:11] strange when you see the direction I'm
[0:14] going in but I ask that you turn with us
[0:18] to Hebrews 11 and 10 and Hebrews 11 and
[0:26] 10
[0:36] then we'll go to Hebrews 11 no let's
[0:41] just go Isaiah 54 from there Hebrews 11
[0:45] and 10 for he looked for a city which
[0:51] had foundations whose builder and maker
[0:56] is God Isaiah 54 for me to scripture my
[1:08] wife would have been here tonight but
[1:10] her mom is not was having issues with
[1:13] her leg so she stayed home with her by
[1:17] the way my mother-in-law is visiting us
[1:19] for about three weeks so Isaiah 54 we're
[1:26] gonna read the fifth and the sixth verse
[1:33] let's start with the fourth please fear
[1:36] not for thou shalt not be ashamed
[1:39] neither be thou confounded but thou
[1:43] shall not be put to shame without show
[1:46] for for thou shalt forget the shame of
[1:50] thy youth and shalt not remember the
[1:53] reproach of thy wood of widowhood
[1:55] anymore for thy maker his dying husband
[1:59] the Lord of Hosts is his name and the
[2:04] Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god
[2:08] of the whole earth shall he be called
[2:11] for the Lord have called thee as a woman
[2:14] Forsaken and grieved in spirit and a
[2:18] wife were youth when thou was refused
[2:20] said thy God for a small moment about
[2:24] forsaken thee but will greet great but
[2:28] with great mercy will I will I the I
[2:32] think I hear some day in a little wrath
[2:36] I hid my face from thee for a moment but
[2:40] with everlasting kindness will I have
[2:43] mercy on thee saith the LORD thy God
[2:48] let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[2:54] for your amazing grace we thank you for
[2:57] being so good to us and we pray father
[3:01] God that your perfect will be done
[3:03] tonight forgive us of our sins cleanse
[3:06] us Lord Jesus from all our righteousness
[3:09] we pray tonight Lord that that perfect
[3:11] will be done in Jesus Christ's name we
[3:14] pray amen
[3:15] you may be seated if you could cut the
[3:17] air on just a little bit gonna feel warm
[3:20] for some reason I like to entitle my
[3:25] message seeking a city in crucial times
[3:30] seeking a city in crucial times and one
[3:36] of the things that really caught my
[3:38] attention we know by God's grace that
[3:41] has been prophesied that California it
[3:44] will sink and we know by God's grace
[3:48] they have had several earthquakes in the
[3:51] last week or two the last measured
[3:56] earthquake I believe was 7.1 of course
[4:00] we would know that numbers mean a lot to
[4:02] God seven was completion and one a man
[4:07] makes eight it seemed like God is
[4:10] getting ready to do something I was
[4:13] telling the saints of God that on that
[4:19] ring of fire has has made it right its
[4:24] rounds it's you know going through
[4:27] Mexico it's going through New Zeeland
[4:31] and own up and then it made his reign
[4:34] his way back to Canada and the next dot
[4:39] was California and I was telling someone
[4:42] that that was what was going to happen
[4:45] and it happened just that way I believe
[4:49] that when this last earthquake and like
[4:51] I said I thought it was that night or
[4:54] the last 17.1 maybe it wasn't but it was
[4:58] a the the highest one
[5:02] did most the most damage and all I could
[5:06] think about was Capernaum Pompeii I
[5:13] could think about just all of the other
[5:18] things that God promised would take
[5:21] place and people ignored the warning but
[5:29] God never judges as anything without a
[5:31] warning in the time of Enoch he was
[5:38] translated the Bible says translated he
[5:42] was raptured the Bible said he was not
[5:45] found but he escaped the wrath that came
[5:50] by way of Noah and understand that Enoch
[5:54] and Noah are two representatives of two
[5:57] Christians
[5:58] Enoch represents the Christian that
[6:02] gives his whole heart to God and then
[6:05] nor represents the lukewarm line he had
[6:09] to go through the Great Tribulation
[6:11] which was the flood the Bible said that
[6:16] God called a man by the name of Abraham
[6:20] before then people lived the way they
[6:23] wanted to live but when God called Abram
[6:27] his name was Abram but he was chosen by
[6:32] God and God had a purpose for him and
[6:36] that purpose God even called him the
[6:40] father of many nations I'm not here to
[6:44] scare anyone or to but to make it known
[6:51] to us that this is a crucial time all
[6:55] scriptures are being fulfilled I mean we
[6:59] we see the days of Noah we see the
[7:02] sector days of Sodom we see these days
[7:05] combining in our generation and this day
[7:10] is called the worst of all days God has
[7:13] been put out of school God has been put
[7:15] out of
[7:15] churches God has been put out of
[7:17] politics but God promised it would be so
[7:25] but understand the Word of God for today
[7:29] did not come to shake the world the
[7:32] world has already been shaken this
[7:35] America have experienced one or more
[7:38] great revivals in the 50s was the
[7:42] greatest revival ever hit the face of
[7:44] the earth
[7:45] we know that when Martin Luther Wesley
[7:49] and all those great men of God that God
[7:52] used shook shook shook shook the world
[7:55] but in this last day God come to shake
[8:00] the church because the church is in what
[8:04] we call a lukewarm state a lair to see
[8:09] an age where everybody has their rights
[8:12] I got a right to do it the way I want to
[8:15] do it you can't tell me how to do it
[8:19] because I'm living in a day and it's
[8:21] okay because the Constitution says so
[8:25] but you and I must understand that God
[8:28] doesn't go by the man-made Constitution
[8:32] this is the only Constitution that God
[8:34] has and you and I we either do it God's
[8:39] Way or we all suffer the consequences
[8:44] God just doesn't judge a person or
[8:46] persons harshly but he always give us a
[8:51] way of escape you and I must understand
[8:56] that this day cannot be how could I say
[9:00] babied all or or God would have such
[9:04] great mercy upon us when we have a whole
[9:08] Bible to learn and to know how God
[9:11] thinks and what God will do when we
[9:14] don't obey his commandment but in all of
[9:20] this I'm saying there are people that
[9:24] are looking for an escape
[9:27] Enoch escaped no escape and each time we
[9:35] they escaped they only could escape by
[9:38] the hand of God I'm coming so you
[9:42] understand coming out of something
[9:45] doesn't necessarily mean you've escaped
[9:49] that particular thing that you have come
[9:51] out of because remember Moses came out
[9:55] of Egypt and 2 million people are more
[9:58] came out with him they came out of Egypt
[10:02] but Egypt never came out of them and
[10:06] because they allowed all of these nasty
[10:09] things to remain in them
[10:11] when Moses tried to sanctify them
[10:15] because understand when they came
[10:17] through the Red Sea that Red Sea and
[10:20] they Bobby said Moses and the children
[10:23] of Israel were baptized into Red Sea and
[10:26] so when they went into the Red Sea it
[10:28] was like a death burial and resurrection
[10:30] think about it over 2 million people
[10:34] being baptized in one day or however
[10:37] long it took them to cross that Red Sea
[10:39] but even in that baptism it wasn't
[10:43] enough that was just like a
[10:44] justification justified that means God
[10:48] chose you picked you up and was gonna
[10:50] use you but he couldn't use them until
[10:53] they went into the wilderness the Bible
[10:55] tells us that in the wilderness it was
[10:57] 40 years they stayed into the wilderness
[10:59] 40 years and God tried to sanctify them
[11:04] 40 years and they never crossed over in
[11:13] other words God dealt with these
[11:15] so-called Christians let me put it in
[11:17] modern terms for 40 years and they did
[11:22] not meet the criteria
[11:25] matter of fact they all died in the
[11:29] wilderness jesus said so and if you
[11:32] looked at died in the wilderness in the
[11:35] New Testament that means they were
[11:37] eternally separated from God
[11:40] now you said what brother books that
[11:42] just doesn't seem right well even in
[11:45] nature tells us that when it comes to
[11:48] producing or burying a child or a woman
[11:51] to get impregnated you know when the man
[11:54] gene meets the woman's egg it's about a
[11:59] million or more
[12:00] all those little fellas trying to way to
[12:04] break into that egg but out out of all
[12:06] of them only one make it so even in
[12:12] nature in the man's way is one out of a
[12:15] million if they were eight toes in those
[12:18] day was one out of million who made it
[12:20] we don't know how many was during the
[12:23] time of ena but think about it only one
[12:25] and think about the percentage of people
[12:28] that made a rapture and that's what
[12:31] Jesus said
[12:31] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[12:34] it be in the coming of the Lord so what
[12:38] do you do with all of these things that
[12:40] we're working with now I don't know
[12:43] about you but I'm toe according to
[12:46] revelation 21:27 there shall in no wise
[12:49] enter into into it anything that
[12:53] defileth neither whatsoever worketh
[12:56] abomination or make it a lie but they
[13:01] which are written in the Lamb's Book of
[13:03] Life so you must understand that the
[13:07] people that make heaven have been chosen
[13:10] to make heaven and these people who have
[13:14] been chosen to make heaven they were
[13:16] chosen before the foundation of the
[13:19] world now you can't say God God are you
[13:23] no you just not fair
[13:24] but the Bible tells us that God had
[13:26] mercy on whom he will he's God like I
[13:31] said and I've used the illustration many
[13:33] times when I was a boy I played with
[13:37] soldiers I played with Indians and
[13:41] always determined which one was going to
[13:45] win sometimes the Indians would win and
[13:48] sometimes Amen the soldiers would win
[13:50] but I was the one who determined which
[13:53] would win
[13:54] it was my choosing and that's how it is
[13:57] with God God is there's so much to him
[13:59] and in no way I can explain to you by
[14:01] God's grace all that he is to God but
[14:04] he's a God of our contrasts in other
[14:08] words he's a savior so he needed a
[14:10] sinner he's a healer so he needed
[14:13] someone sick is that right
[14:15] he's a deliverer so he needed somebody
[14:18] bound so he allows Satan to come and do
[14:23] the nut the dog park
[14:24] the contrast part and that now he didn't
[14:28] make Satan do it but that was Satan's
[14:30] choice to do it and God knew he would do
[14:32] that - listen let me go on
[14:35] so I'm saying all of these things
[14:37] because you must understand that that in
[14:40] this day if we're not careful we will
[14:43] miss it out miss out we've come out of
[14:45] organization we don't consider ourself
[14:47] an organization we don't consider
[14:49] ourselves a denomination we only
[14:51] consider ourselves that being part of
[14:53] the bottom crop body of Christ and the
[14:55] only way that you can get into the body
[14:57] of Christ that is to be baptized with
[15:00] the Holy Ghost and fire that right you
[15:04] must be born again not by the water only
[15:07] but by the water and the spirit you see
[15:10] so we realized by God's grace that that
[15:13] God is a spirit and they that worship
[15:15] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[15:19] truth I'm taking my time tonight so you
[15:22] can understand Amen that we are living
[15:25] in a crucial time of crucial time
[15:29] Laodicea which is a age that we're in is
[15:34] the last church age before the Great
[15:37] Tribulation all right the last Church
[15:40] age this is it people I don't care what
[15:43] everybody's thinking is going to happen
[15:45] this is it America has spewed her day of
[15:49] grace and she's not going to get better
[15:51] she's going to get worse that's what the
[15:54] Bible says he evil seducers shall wax
[15:56] worse and worse there's no such thing as
[15:59] a better day when our country has
[16:01] rejected God we had Israel as an example
[16:05] they rejected God and look what happened
[16:07] to
[16:08] is that right so you and I must
[16:10] understand there's not no nothing's
[16:12] gonna get better it's going to get worse
[16:13] and God will even make nature work on
[16:17] his behalf
[16:18] now let me go on because you got to
[16:22] realize Amen that just like Israel all
[16:26] that came out of Egypt was not all
[16:29] Israel think God doesn't destroy his own
[16:33] he only destroyed those who who knows
[16:36] not that I'm not here is that right
[16:39] the Bible says the Lord knoweth them
[16:41] that I hear you see what I'm saying
[16:44] and the only way you can understand that
[16:46] is to know that there are two seeds one
[16:48] seed is of God and the other seat of
[16:50] isn't of the devil there's no such thing
[16:53] as they're in between right you either
[16:55] are of God or you are of the devil is
[16:58] that right now the Bible tells us that
[17:01] there was a woman that had twins and one
[17:04] name was Esau and the other one name was
[17:07] Jacob Jacob and we find out that Jacob
[17:11] Amen in his character didn't look much
[17:13] like the seed of God but Esau constantly
[17:17] served his father Abraham did whatever
[17:19] he wanted whatever he he wanted him to
[17:22] do but we find out that it was Esau who
[17:27] was the shyster it was Esau Amen who
[17:31] hated his birthright and I'm coming to
[17:34] that in a moment because the birthright
[17:37] was the thing that Jacob lied and
[17:40] shyster his brother out of he had
[17:43] respect for the birthright y'all
[17:46] understand me is alright
[17:48] but we know that Jacob had a problem
[17:50] with lying and deceiving right and we
[17:54] find out that he went to his father his
[17:56] up his uncle's house he met Rebecca over
[17:59] there he met Leah you know them saying
[18:01] and the same tricks he pulled on Jacob
[18:04] on Esau God pulled on him is that right
[18:09] see because whatever you saw you going
[18:11] to reap and so therefore he had to see
[18:14] he reached set fourteen years
[18:20] and amen he gather two wives so that's a
[18:24] long story
[18:24] but the point is amen the Bible said
[18:28] that Jacob knew that he was not ready
[18:31] and prepared for the war there was a fun
[18:34] him and that was he had to come back to
[18:37] his country to me Esau hello and we find
[18:42] out that Jacob the Bible said wrestled
[18:44] all night now you got to understand when
[18:47] that route so that means prayer he
[18:49] prayed all night lord have mercy on me
[18:52] I'm not prepared for tomorrow y'all
[18:56] understand me see we can't get out of
[18:59] here we can't get out of this situation
[19:02] without prayer there's no way it is the
[19:05] way that God has determined it and
[19:08] that's the way we must do it in order
[19:10] for anyone to get out of Egypt guess
[19:12] what the Bible said that God said I have
[19:14] heard their cry what was it they were
[19:18] praying they were crying out and prayer
[19:20] God have mercy God deliver us God we
[19:24] need a Savior and God sent the Moses but
[19:27] you see when God send you someone it's
[19:29] never like like you wanted to be it's
[19:33] always something contrary to what you
[19:35] think is going to be and so when Moses
[19:39] came they were ready for Moses right
[19:42] consider how Moses Amen was once Pharaoh
[19:45] or next to Pharaoh he became a murderer
[19:47] is that right is that right now how many
[19:50] you would follow a murderer but God
[19:53] chose it to be that way because car take
[19:56] the foolishness of this world to
[19:58] confound the wise he always hides
[20:01] himself behind what we might call
[20:04] foolishness and you saw a cry when I
[20:07] follow a man like Moses when we know
[20:11] he's a murderer he's been dethroned
[20:13] he's a reject of Egypt he's a castaway
[20:16] but that's what God chose that's what
[20:19] God chose and and we find out that he
[20:22] led millions out of Egypt now they come
[20:26] into a place we call the wilderness did
[20:28] you know I think it was like a seven day
[20:29] journey they could have gone to Jericho
[20:32] seven days to the promised land
[20:33] but 40 years God made them work let me
[20:37] tell you something when God is trying to
[20:39] clean us and cleanse
[20:41] clean us up a man no longer no here take
[20:45] however long it takes because God is not
[20:48] governed by time he's eternal right
[20:53] somebody put tests on them for 40 years
[20:56] and they still murmured and complain I'm
[21:00] gonna tell you something that's one
[21:02] thing God won't Talib tolerate and that
[21:06] is murmuring and complaining about his
[21:08] leadership hmm
[21:11] his ways of fire pass finding out way
[21:17] beyond our ways but he took them there
[21:20] to do what he's trying to help them now
[21:22] because leading them into the wilderness
[21:25] he gave them bread to eat he every time
[21:28] they complain he gave them fouls to eat
[21:31] bird they didn't even have to hunt for
[21:33] them he sent them to their backyard
[21:35] right rain down manna from heaven the
[21:38] Bible said that clothes never got
[21:40] raggedy neither did they have to change
[21:42] shoes 40 years I came up here shoes for
[21:46] 40 years
[21:48] right and they still fail to see what
[21:52] God was doing all God ever wanted for
[21:56] his people was to trust him with all of
[22:00] their hearts that's all he tried to do
[22:04] try to get them to trust him how do you
[22:07] know when you can you trust in God when
[22:09] you're complaining cease and that's all
[22:15] he ever wanted he wanted his people to
[22:17] trust him is that the scripture trust
[22:20] the Lord with all of your heart and lean
[22:23] not to your own understanding
[22:26] acknowledge the Lord in all of your ways
[22:28] and he shall direct your path right so
[22:32] I'm coming to something in just a moment
[22:33] so now there's another Exodus there was
[22:36] an exodus in noise day right that's the
[22:39] first exit the second Exodus was Moses
[22:42] right he mainly brought them out of
[22:45] Egypt but there's a third X's God is
[22:47] three right one two three that's
[22:49] perfection he works in three right three
[22:54] dispensations a dispensation of the
[22:56] Father dispensation of the son
[22:58] disposition of the Holy Ghost but these
[23:01] three are one
[23:01] so you look at these things and so all
[23:04] brother Brooks what are you trying to
[23:05] say I'm trying to say that God and then
[23:08] he's working there's another Exodus but
[23:10] you understand whenever God brings you
[23:13] out of something he must first do what
[23:15] sanctify you when he brought the
[23:18] children out of the wilderness tried
[23:20] them and everything else he told him
[23:22] listen sanctify yourself secondly he
[23:26] said you must be reser kamsani help me
[23:31] here I'm getting stirred so I want you
[23:34] to understand by God's grace that God
[23:36] comes along and he gets to work with you
[23:38] work with what the inner man see it's
[23:41] not about all what you think you are all
[23:44] that you do they're going to be a lot of
[23:45] preachers who end up in hell thinking
[23:49] because they were preachers they were
[23:50] saved there's gonna be a lot of gospel
[23:54] singers a man end up in hell because
[23:57] they said oh I saying gospel but when
[24:01] did that become a criteria when did God
[24:04] say you got to learn how to sing gospel
[24:05] to get they ever you know what he told
[24:08] them you must be born again
[24:11] of the water and of the spirit you must
[24:14] be born again
[24:15] because the way you are now you can get
[24:18] there no flesh and blood shall enter
[24:21] into that City
[24:23] none you and I were born in iniquity
[24:27] shaped and iniquity born in sin came out
[24:31] speaking lies you don't have to tell a
[24:33] baby how to lie you don't have to tell a
[24:35] young child Hara how to be jealous or to
[24:37] hate it is in them that's the nature and
[24:40] that nature must be changed and that
[24:42] change come by fire baptism of God right
[24:47] and the only way that you can have that
[24:50] is that you've got to be sanctified
[24:53] circumcised amen listen one of the
[24:56] things that God did with Abraham April
[24:59] when his name was ABR
[25:01] a b ra m abram when God called him but
[25:06] when God began to change Abraham his
[25:09] name became Abraham that word ham means
[25:13] God God attached his name to Abram
[25:17] so Abraham became what like God is the
[25:20] father of all things Abraham became the
[25:23] father of Nations right but the
[25:26] circumcision came the change of the name
[25:29] came at the same time the circumcision
[25:32] came C so when when circumcision whether
[25:37] circumcision means to cut away the
[25:39] Serpent's part and y'all understand what
[25:42] I mean so when a man is circumcised and
[25:45] that skin is taken off it's cutting away
[25:47] the circumcircle part and then you have
[25:51] a revelation there right so you must
[25:55] understand that when God began to work
[25:58] in a man's life or a woman's life amen
[26:00] they must understand it just not I
[26:02] believe that I'm a Christian or I
[26:04] believe that Jesus Christ is our Savior
[26:06] that's the beginning but that is not
[26:09] where it stopped you must move on you do
[26:12] Paul said we must grow into grace grow
[26:15] into the knowledge of our Lord and
[26:18] Savior Jesus Christ we are on a journey
[26:20] and circumcision means not only had you
[26:24] had to clean your house physically but
[26:27] you had to clean your natural house whoo
[26:31] you had to make sure nothing was in your
[26:34] house that would defile and what is
[26:37] something that is defiling anything
[26:40] that's unclean and won't fit in heaven
[26:44] that's what the filing is if whatever
[26:47] you have you know that if you would die
[26:49] you couldn't put it in heaven it ain't
[26:52] right here because if I said let thy
[26:54] will be done in earth as it is in heaven
[26:58] right listen goddess has his church
[27:03] called and named and set aside and in
[27:07] the age that she lives he's revealed
[27:10] himself to her each and every time just
[27:13] and he says
[27:14] in Romans eighth chapter that the
[27:16] foreknowledge of predestination of God
[27:18] might stand assure you understand me in
[27:22] other words God was not surprised at the
[27:26] birth of Judah Judas Judas the Bible
[27:29] said was born the son of perdition he
[27:32] came he didn't even know where but he
[27:35] was a devil from his birth it was only
[27:38] during the time that Jesus needed Judas
[27:41] to betray him because in the Old
[27:44] Testament it tells about how he would be
[27:46] so for thirty pieces of silver and then
[27:50] Jesus come of Judas come right along and
[27:52] sell jesus for thirty pieces that
[27:58] scripture there in the Old Testament was
[28:00] Judas it just didn't have a name it was
[28:04] in the New Testament that scripture
[28:08] became a person follow me here
[28:12] the scripture had to become a person it
[28:15] had to be the Word made flesh is that
[28:20] right the Bible says according to Isaiah
[28:23] nine a virgin shall conceive right and
[28:28] so you see that that was Jesus Christ
[28:30] that was Mary first of all conceiving
[28:34] Jesus well nobody knew that was Mary and
[28:37] never nobody knew who it was going to be
[28:39] Jesus but nor did they know his name
[28:43] because about said his name shall be
[28:45] called wonderful counsellor the
[28:46] everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[28:48] you're understanding but when the age of
[28:51] met Mary and told her that this thing
[28:54] that being used of the Holy Ghost
[28:56] you understand me and his name shall be
[28:58] called Jesus that scripture became a lie
[29:02] you understand me so what I'm trying to
[29:06] say is that there are shadows and types
[29:09] of every devil in the Bible and there's
[29:13] shadows and types of you there and if
[29:19] you want to see yourself you look
[29:22] through the Scriptures and you will find
[29:23] yourself you understand what I'm saying
[29:27] because you can say oh if I was in the
[29:30] days of Jesus I would serve him well
[29:33] nope
[29:33] the only reason why you would serve him
[29:36] is that you're serving him now because
[29:40] he's still here you see what I'm saying
[29:43] oh I was in Moses day I saw the Moses no
[29:47] only if you would follow Christ now
[29:50] because it wasn't a man Moses it was
[29:53] Christ in Moses see so there will be no
[29:57] excuse let me move on now sanctification
[30:00] coming to this place and you know what
[30:02] i'ma tell you it like this and I'm
[30:03] cutting it short I'm not gonna be long
[30:05] tonight but I'm gonna tell you this
[30:06] every church age manifested its virtue
[30:11] hmm Elvis's manifested faith right it's
[30:18] right what it did it was they were
[30:21] chosen to do that they couldn't help but
[30:24] do that and when Luther was called
[30:27] Luther was justification Wesley was
[30:30] sanctification those people fell under
[30:33] that anointing and they they got so
[30:36] sanctified they believe that chewing gum
[30:38] was wrong you understand me it was the
[30:43] anointing of that age this is why we're
[30:47] different it's not that we want to be
[30:50] different but there's a message there's
[30:52] a word that's causing us to be the way
[30:54] we are acting the way we are you can't
[30:57] help it it caught it catches you for an
[31:01] example it's like a magnet it's like
[31:04] when Peter James and John Jesus witness
[31:06] they come follow me they didn't know the
[31:09] man but the Bible said they dropped
[31:14] everything and followed him now that
[31:16] sounds insane but what it was there was
[31:19] something that caught their attention
[31:22] that was greater than their eyesight the
[31:25] Bible says birds have nested and foxes
[31:29] have holes and birds have nests but the
[31:31] Son of man has no place to lay his head
[31:33] that you go follow somebody that don't
[31:36] even have a house but that's what they
[31:40] did
[31:41] they followed Jesus y'all understand me
[31:45] God always makes it that way you always
[31:48] got are you gonna look like a nut you're
[31:50] gonna look like a fruitcake something's
[31:52] wrong with this boy why would he why
[31:56] would he live like that why would he do
[31:57] that why would he follow that he can't
[32:00] help there's something that magnetized
[32:03] you if you are elected to make heaven
[32:06] you understand me we read about Abraham
[32:09] the Bible said Abraham left his country
[32:12] knowing not whether he was going and
[32:15] child II was like Babylon he was a
[32:18] flourishing place it wasn't poor
[32:22] flourishing method Abraham took his took
[32:25] his goods he wasn't leaving with one
[32:27] wagon he had a lot of things but there
[32:32] was a call on his heart from God and
[32:34] even though he couldn't explain it he
[32:36] knew he had to follow
[32:38] can you imagine what they were saying
[32:41] Abraham Abraham Abram you have fallen of
[32:46] God what he looks like I don't know have
[32:50] you ever seen him no where where can you
[32:55] find him I don't know you see because he
[32:58] was the invisible God he was a low him
[33:01] he was spirit but that spirit called a
[33:04] hold of him and somehow communicated to
[33:06] Abraham and Abraham knew he had to leave
[33:09] Babylon why because they were idolaters
[33:15] right so it is with every Christian
[33:19] that's what he said Peter James y'all
[33:21] come follow me
[33:22] they're like quit their job and they
[33:25] left followed him right so let me move
[33:30] on so we realize they meant that when it
[33:33] came to Westby them that jessilee that
[33:36] sanctification fell on then what were
[33:38] they consistently doing making sure that
[33:41] they were circumsized cleansed and this
[33:45] is what Christians do today we're not
[33:47] perfect within ourselves but we because
[33:51] we are under the blood work constantly
[33:53] confessing when
[33:54] constantly asking God to cleanse us with
[33:57] constantly asking God to fill us with
[34:00] this holy goes some things are what the
[34:04] Holy Ghost is shouting the Holy Ghost is
[34:06] dancing the Holy Ghost is speaking in
[34:08] tongues it can be all of that and yet is
[34:11] still it can be just a still small voice
[34:15] but whenever it happens it's going to
[34:19] change you because the Holy Ghost is the
[34:23] nature of God Peter says it is the
[34:26] divine nature and that has been
[34:30] administered to us through Malachi for
[34:33] you understand me these verses that we
[34:36] see up on the wall these virtues are not
[34:40] mind over matter absolutely not it is
[34:45] the gift of God and yet in his victory
[34:48] so how do you gain victory in this
[34:51] matter by yielding to God that's it you
[34:58] yield to God you decide you yield to God
[35:02] you need virtue you year to God you
[35:05] surrender says lord I need virtue and
[35:08] guess what he did give it to you and
[35:10] then he will test it hallelujah you know
[35:16] work forward the work is already
[35:18] finished but he gives us grace that we
[35:22] can ask for it listen so you must
[35:25] understand the Church of the Living God
[35:28] now is in a small number and when I say
[35:33] that if you think this is small compared
[35:37] to the Church of the whole world it's
[35:39] small hello
[35:43] you said well what do you mean I'm time
[35:46] I bribed now I'm talk about people
[35:47] that's gonna make a rapture they're
[35:50] everywhere but they're in small numbers
[35:53] because Enoch was small and you got to
[35:58] find out a mint that even those who go
[36:00] through the Great Tribulation
[36:01] they don't behold it's gonna be a great
[36:03] number compared to the numbers that have
[36:06] have lived
[36:07] on this earth but even then and to be a
[36:10] percentage comparing to the vast numbers
[36:14] of people that ever lived and so you
[36:18] must understand that election is so
[36:21] important if you say I'm bride a bride
[36:24] it must be vindicated because it can't
[36:28] be head knowledge oh I'm gonna make the
[36:30] rapture that's not that don't guarantee
[36:32] you rapture being in the message doesn't
[36:35] guarantee you the message
[36:36] there are rapture what guarantees you
[36:39] the rapture is that you come to the
[36:41] statue of Christ the very image of God
[36:44] must be revealed in you shown in you
[36:47] that is what we call the tokhes eye hmm
[36:52] you must understand Amen that here we
[36:55] are so you understand Christians like
[37:00] Israel all Israel is not Israel right I
[37:04] bet you got some real shysters yeah you
[37:07] see them in the mall someone selling
[37:10] goods and all that and if you not watch
[37:12] it watch for them beat you out your
[37:14] money representing God in Israel now
[37:18] Romans 9 6 to 13 and I'm trying to hurry
[37:21] up not as though the Word of God have
[37:23] taken more none effect but they are not
[37:26] all Israel which are of Israel neither
[37:29] because they are the seed of Abraham are
[37:32] they all children but in Isaac shall thy
[37:36] seed be called
[37:38] that is that which our are the children
[37:41] of the flesh these are not the children
[37:43] of God but the children of the promise
[37:46] are accounted for the seed so what do
[37:50] you mean by the rugs
[37:51] remember when Hitler killed a hundred
[37:54] and forty four thousand how many was six
[37:56] million I'm sorry six million when when
[37:59] Hitler killed six million Jews do you
[38:02] don't you realize that every one of
[38:04] those names God had already called they
[38:09] didn't know nothing about Jesus you know
[38:11] why they didn't know nothing about Jesus
[38:13] two things first of all when Jesus
[38:17] Christ was being crucified
[38:19] those Jews scream
[38:20] now let his blood be on us and our
[38:23] children and they're all words condemn
[38:27] them right secondly with Miriam and
[38:32] Aaron when they made fun of Moses they
[38:38] made fun of Moses Amen Marin and
[38:41] Ethiopian woman is that right and it was
[38:46] at that point Miriam was stricken with
[38:49] leprosy and leprosy is sin and she had
[38:53] to stay without the camp for seven
[38:55] church ages seven days she had to stay
[39:00] out of the camp and guess what
[39:02] before she could come back she had to be
[39:04] sanctified by a priest hallelujah and
[39:08] that's what Moses and Elijah comes in
[39:10] hallelujah
[39:11] one comes the sanctified and the other
[39:13] one comes to bring the word there's
[39:17] other things they do too but you
[39:18] understand the scripture is perfect
[39:20] shadows and types are perfect right so
[39:24] we realize amen that when they come back
[39:26] in when it's time for Miriam to come
[39:29] back into the camper into the presence
[39:31] of God the rapture takes place right so
[39:35] you understand by God's grace how close
[39:37] we are
[39:38] Israel has already come a nation she's
[39:40] already in her homeland is that right
[39:43] and we're now experiencing the fall of
[39:46] America yeah people don't think we've
[39:51] fallen we're falling and we'll never get
[39:53] back up right it has been prophesied
[39:57] that she's going to go up in smoke
[40:00] yeah Russia gonna bomb us that's why you
[40:02] see Russia and all the stuff all these
[40:05] countries she's already got the bomb
[40:06] great waiting huh y'all understand me
[40:10] for example when God tries to get a
[40:14] country to repent and they will not he
[40:16] sins he said he places our enemy over
[40:19] them when Israel would not repent guess
[40:23] what
[40:23] God sent Nebuchadnezzar he said Babylon
[40:29] to conquer his people
[40:32] they were founded over religion so are
[40:34] we and who can be more atheistic than
[40:40] Russia but she has been ordained to not
[40:46] only to destroy us but destroy the
[40:48] Vatican as well now let's go on because
[40:53] if that be the case
[40:55] being a Christian is not the outside is
[40:58] the inside right and if Christ is only
[41:03] inside he is the one that's working
[41:06] you're not working when you come into
[41:09] Christ you come into rest is that right
[41:13] for example y'all heard me say this last
[41:16] week a week before last when Joseph when
[41:19] he came among his brother the Bible said
[41:21] that Joseph had on a coat of many colors
[41:25] that was that was that was like a
[41:27] three-piece suit that was one of them
[41:30] debonair Dan Schuster expensive daddy
[41:32] made it for him so when he came into the
[41:36] company of his brothers they knew he did
[41:39] not come to work he was at rest they did
[41:45] all the work
[41:45] all he did was report back to the daddy
[41:48] right so what did they do they got so
[41:51] angry they got so jealous of him but
[41:53] what you got to understand that Joseph
[41:55] Joseph had a work he had to come through
[41:57] something Joseph had to be in check all
[42:00] the time right he had an opportunity to
[42:04] steal he had an opportunity to commit
[42:07] adultery he had all these opportunities
[42:10] and Joseph was saying no he met the test
[42:13] every time what was God doing sanctified
[42:17] circle sizing him cleansing him up
[42:20] because God had a greater position and
[42:22] that was at the right hand of Pharaoh
[42:24] right that's what there was a how who
[42:27] can I trust but this man this man is
[42:30] there anybody else in my kingdom I could
[42:32] trust like that but that that King was
[42:35] actually speaking the words of God see
[42:41] is this okay
[42:43] there is only one way of entrance and
[42:46] people said what there's you know I hate
[42:49] to say it but I'm gonna say it
[42:50] I heard TD Jake when he was with Oprah
[42:53] saying that that there's more than one
[42:57] way to make it to heaven I don't know
[42:58] what other way he's knowing cuz they
[43:01] asked her yeah she asked him the
[43:03] question is he says no there other ways
[43:05] I heard it now my question is who's
[43:09] right Jesus or TD jakes is that right
[43:15] because jesus said I am the door I am
[43:19] the door and if any man gonna come he
[43:21] must come through this door right
[43:22] there's only one way Jesus Christ is the
[43:26] way and the thing about it is this is
[43:31] why Muslims laugh at Christians because
[43:34] they haven't seen the life of Christ in
[43:36] the Christian and the life of Christ is
[43:41] supposed to be in the Christian how do
[43:45] you get this life in you by asking God
[43:47] for it we have not because we ask not
[43:53] but when you call on God see he's the
[43:56] father all there's not a child that will
[43:59] cry in the prayers of his mother father
[44:01] and his mother and father will not
[44:03] answer God is looking see we are proud
[44:08] nation we are proud people and it's hard
[44:10] for Americans
[44:11] amen to follow me knees and ask God for
[44:14] help we'd rather say he doesn't exist so
[44:22] you can understand where we are nor was
[44:26] a man of God
[44:27] you know what nor was the only man that
[44:33] God had chosen for that day let me
[44:36] reword it Noah was that day's xscape a
[44:40] flood was coming and no one knew the way
[44:43] out no other man knew it if there were
[44:46] other preachers no other preachers knew
[44:48] it right Moses he was the only way out
[44:53] of Egypt the auto deign it that way
[44:56] Jesus
[44:57] Jesus even said except the man know that
[44:59] I am he should like while dying his sin
[45:02] he was the only way out I always tell
[45:06] people I said listen you don't know who
[45:08] everybody else is but you must come to
[45:10] know who you are and if there's a pull
[45:13] on your heart of that call on your heart
[45:15] don't we don't don't reject it don't
[45:17] walk away as if it's not there Amen
[45:20] because that's God so you understand
[45:23] what I'm trying to say in the days of
[45:26] Noah when Noah was building the ark all
[45:30] of the animals did not have a pool on
[45:33] him
[45:35] there were chosen animals from God that
[45:38] had a pool on them to enter the ark huh
[45:45] and let me tell you what you know I love
[45:47] this illustration even if mr. rabbit had
[45:50] to cross the country amen to travel to
[45:53] leopard territory leopard a lion
[45:55] couldn't touch him because he was
[45:58] ordained get to get on the ark that's
[46:02] how it is with a true believer we go
[46:04] through something many of us it's like a
[46:06] lily can I say like this we're like mr.
[46:08] Lily both of most of us were born in the
[46:12] milk slide but the seed that was
[46:18] underneath that that mop in that slide
[46:21] caught the light and that light struck
[46:25] us and we pushed through the slime we
[46:26] pushed through the mud we pushed through
[46:28] it and there's nothing more beautiful
[46:30] than a beautiful pond Lily
[46:32] but it had to go through something to
[46:35] get there so is it with the Christian
[46:39] though we walk in this world we are
[46:42] growing into Christ growing into the
[46:44] knowledge growing and after a while
[46:47] these childish mistakes we've we've made
[46:49] in the past disappear but we must
[46:53] continue to ask God the Word of God says
[46:58] acknowledge the Lord in all your ways
[47:00] and he shall direct your path you love
[47:04] the Lord man consists of body soul and
[47:08] spirit did y'all know that
[47:11] body soul and spirit and I meant to draw
[47:13] that out and totally forgot I went
[47:17] through it like a circle one that's body
[47:21] spirit so like a bull's-eye in the
[47:24] middle is your soul your soul in there
[47:28] is faith or doubt here in your spirit
[47:32] are all of the other attributes like
[47:35] feelings and you know how that goes and
[47:38] in your flesh you got everything so when
[47:45] the Holy Ghost Falls it could fall on
[47:48] your flesh and you've seen people who
[47:49] they're called religious and right and
[47:51] then all of a sudden the anointing
[47:53] leaving they back to what they used to
[47:54] be then you'll have the Holy Spirit fall
[47:57] on your spirit it'll make you cry and
[47:59] they shout you might shout you may speak
[48:02] in tongues you might do all these
[48:03] glorious things but it ain't over yet
[48:07] see that's just the beginning
[48:09] you must there's a third part which we
[48:11] call the Holies of Holies in God's
[48:14] temple he had the outer Court the inner
[48:17] court and the Holies of Holies and this
[48:19] was designed like a man and in the
[48:22] Holies of Holies there was a veil right
[48:24] and that veil had to be rent in order
[48:28] for God to get there and out of for us
[48:31] to see God the veil must be read so
[48:34] that's why the Bible said Amen that when
[48:37] Jesus was crucified the veil was rent
[48:39] from top to bottom showing that it
[48:42] wasn't a man that rent the veil it was
[48:44] God who rent the veil see it's not you
[48:46] accepting God as God except in you and
[48:49] when God accepts your faith he rinsed
[48:52] the veil and he places his Holy Spirit
[48:54] behind that veil which is called the
[48:57] Holies of Holies and in that Holies of
[49:00] Holies you you change not because you
[49:04] practice it but the change come from the
[49:08] power with him see that is that's the
[49:12] Holy Ghost when you don't have to do it
[49:13] he does the work for you right and when
[49:17] you recognize he's in there to do the
[49:19] work you go to the man who could change
[49:21] you
[49:24] is that alright cuz none of us gonna add
[49:26] one cubit to our statue we can't do it I
[49:30] used to try so hard when I oh my I was
[49:34] such a heavy part of your I really was
[49:43] and I want it I want to see God with all
[49:46] my heart I wanted to stop all younger
[49:49] what partying do does for you and when
[49:55] you get all intoxicated and everything
[49:57] else you lose your bearings you do
[49:59] things you wouldn't normally do
[50:00] somebody help me here y'all know what
[50:03] I'm talking about y'all sitting up here
[50:04] so expect ammonia's but it's the truth
[50:06] you lose control and then somebody else
[50:10] takes control and then you wake up in
[50:13] the morning feeling really bad for doing
[50:15] the stuff that you've done and there's
[50:16] no way to undo it and you get tired of
[50:21] that what is it it's the devil using you
[50:24] but none of us have been we weren't made
[50:28] to be used by the devil we were made to
[50:31] be the temple of God that's what the
[50:33] Bible says
[50:34] no you not that you are the temple of
[50:36] God that's where God wants to dwell not
[50:39] in a building like this God wanna dwell
[50:41] in you so that you understand that's the
[50:45] difference between the church today in
[50:47] the church yesterday in in the days of
[50:50] Acts not only where they feel with the
[50:52] Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost but I
[50:55] think on the seventh chapter a fourth
[50:57] chapter either one they were actually
[50:59] resealed and you have to be refilled
[51:03] refilled refilled it over and over again
[51:07] why because if you're not you have a
[51:10] tendency to backslide every day all day
[51:16] it's making that connection once you
[51:20] come to see that's why I read that
[51:22] scripture my mom my Maker is my husband
[51:26] what are you talking to telling me um
[51:29] the Bible said he's not only my redeemer
[51:31] but he's my husband for example Adam was
[51:35] the Redeemer of Eve but he was also her
[51:38] husband
[51:39] but it was he who saved her from the
[51:41] wrath of God by taking her into himself
[51:46] you understand me and so that's how
[51:49] Christ saves us by taking us into him in
[51:53] him right but day by day you got to
[52:00] understand this that's true the Bible
[52:02] says they asked Jesus how to pray and
[52:05] you know confession was in that they
[52:08] wanted to know how to pray Lord every
[52:10] day forgive me of my desk hmm as I
[52:15] forgive my dead toys every day you must
[52:19] confess and forgive every day and that's
[52:26] how we make it
[52:27] she is so simple the people don't
[52:29] understand that as long as you see God
[52:32] on a daily basis asking God for his
[52:34] cleansing power for his power to
[52:36] circumcise however you want to say it
[52:39] but it is then when God can trust you
[52:43] because he realized you don't want to
[52:46] live the bad life it is then God can say
[52:49] okay you've been faithful I'm gonna seal
[52:52] you boom right and then all of a sudden
[52:56] you realize that the demons recognize
[52:59] you that right oh yeah they say Paul we
[53:03] know Peter we know but who are you
[53:08] that's why that's why the Devils be
[53:12] sitting up in church right now and and
[53:14] and the church ain't no threat to them
[53:21] because people don't have them they have
[53:23] religion they have religion they have
[53:27] religion I just recently saw the devil
[53:30] cast out of a band you know by the power
[53:33] of prayer you know how many times we've
[53:37] seen healings and deliverances in I'm a
[53:40] witness it's not by power not by might
[53:43] but by my spirit saith the Lord you know
[53:46] we don't have the plush seats and but
[53:49] you know what neither did Jesus when he
[53:51] in the manger think about what you have
[53:54] he's all I gotta have no you don't the
[53:57] early church had churches in caves they
[54:00] went house-to-house they didn't have a
[54:02] change of clothes they had all they all
[54:05] they had was Jesus let me tell you
[54:07] something if I had to make a trade give
[54:09] me Jesus give me the way they had and
[54:12] give it to me listen i'ma tell you
[54:14] something I might seem crazy right now
[54:16] but I'm gonna be crazier later because
[54:18] I'm seeking God with all my heart
[54:21] do I make mistakes yes but I do know one
[54:25] thing and God had me skip a lot of
[54:27] things but but one thing I do know
[54:29] mm-hmm is that without God we are
[54:33] nothing and you and I must know these
[54:36] are crucial times let me say let me ask
[54:38] you a question if California had really
[54:41] dropped off the map on on the other day
[54:43] how many of us would have been prepared
[54:44] and ready for you know that according to
[54:49] the sixth seal caliber that that great
[54:52] earthquake is the same earthquake that
[54:55] that brings forth the resurrection
[54:57] that's why people won't know they're
[54:58] missing because not only with this great
[55:02] earthquake shake California is going to
[55:04] shake everything Florida was saying
[55:07] England would sink the whole mass of the
[55:10] world would change places that which was
[55:14] up goes down and that which was down
[55:16] comes up and people have no idea and
[55:20] they're going to see a lot of the things
[55:22] that the Bible took foretold and told
[55:24] that did happen won't be in their face
[55:27] this wise generation who think they have
[55:31] outsmart God God will show them at the
[55:34] end of the day then what your people
[55:37] still trying to figure out where they're
[55:38] the flood never happened all over the
[55:41] world in the caves everywhere paintings
[55:44] everywhere showed it happened but the
[55:47] intellectual man want to put God out and
[55:50] don't want to acknowledge him but they
[55:52] won't have to one day because God will
[55:54] acknowledge himself so I'm giving all of
[55:57] this to say this every age produced what
[56:02] they were supposed to produce
[56:04] and this age is being required to
[56:06] produce divine love
[56:08] that's rapture material there'll be a
[56:12] lot of Christians that will make heaven
[56:15] but they won't take a rapture they've
[56:18] got to go through the Great Tribulation
[56:19] according to Matthew 25 the Bible said
[56:23] there were five wise and five foolish in
[56:25] the five that was foolish did not have
[56:27] enough oil in their lamps in other words
[56:29] they were dilatory they became
[56:32] complacent they became distracted you
[56:37] understand me it's like Oh what you
[56:39] talking about
[56:39] yes Moses was at work when Moses Amen
[56:43] was was was with the children of Israel
[56:46] and everything else Moses got so busy he
[56:50] forgot to circumcise his own son you see
[56:54] them said he was in the line of duty but
[56:55] he got so distracted and that's what a
[56:57] lot of Christians do we get so
[56:59] distracted with so many things we fail
[57:01] to see that this this is our priority we
[57:03] forget we came into this message to
[57:06] produce Christ not to build houses and
[57:09] get famous and have all of this stuff
[57:12] and all of that you understand me it's
[57:17] alright to have that but my point is we
[57:20] not were not to forget who what we come
[57:22] for we should be listen the Word of God
[57:25] said we should be hot or cold
[57:28] he said lukewarm experience out of his
[57:30] mouth we supposed to be hot or cold and
[57:33] we supposed to be in a position right
[57:35] now Amen that we should be calling out
[57:37] to the name of the Lord like it's a
[57:38] matter of life and death because it
[57:40] really is and if we don't get this
[57:43] circumcision that we supposed to have I
[57:45] mean coming into the Christ coming into
[57:47] the image of Christ because nothing that
[57:49] will defile will enter it doesn't matter
[57:52] how many time on you've been in the
[57:53] message 40 years with Moses boom what's
[57:56] what was that yeah you understand me you
[58:00] got to understand that God can't change
[58:02] them his mind about his work what he
[58:05] says is what he meant but every man has
[58:08] the opportunity of making it so I'm just
[58:12] encouraging you not tonight I want a
[58:14] different way but but the reason why I
[58:17] I'm trying to say these things because
[58:19] it is a crucial time it's a time that
[58:22] you and I should really take inventory
[58:23] and see how important it is for us to
[58:27] refocus ourselves because distractions
[58:31] comes all the time all the time I'm not
[58:35] saying you got to be like a robot no but
[58:38] they're supposed to come a relationship
[58:40] between you and God
[58:41] remember Jesus said I never knew you
[58:50] Christians people who went out we can't
[58:52] start Devils in your name we see what
[58:54] I'm saying all these miraculous things
[58:56] they did and then Jesus God says listen
[58:58] but I never knew you in other words she
[59:02] said I never had an intimate
[59:04] relationship with you that's what God
[59:06] wants he wants an intimate relationship
[59:09] not a church core whatever I want an
[59:13] intimate relationship we do something
[59:15] that you and I can have communion with
[59:18] everyday yeah that's what he wants so
[59:21] you said what do you mean but that's all
[59:23] I'm saying
[59:23] so this intimate relationship is it's a
[59:26] it's how could I say it it's not a group
[59:32] thing every man for himself
[59:35] that's what I'm trying to say you love
[59:38] the Lord I hope I said something that
[59:40] sparked your interest I've got a lot of
[59:43] notes but he didn't even let me use them
[59:46] but I do want to say one thing is that
[59:49] you and I supposed to come to grow up
[59:52] into Christ so much so two demons fear
[59:59] hmm and my trip in Arkansas being
[1:00:05] Minister down there and the Lord did
[1:00:07] some great discerning situations that
[1:00:10] were going on in the church I knew
[1:00:12] nothing about and I was saying words
[1:00:15] verbatim this is from the pastor's mouth
[1:00:17] that another minister had already said I
[1:00:20] wasn't even there he had spoken on
[1:00:23] things situations that he needed to
[1:00:26] rectify out May Cry however it was God
[1:00:30] went right there in the area and these
[1:00:34] people were were astounded it wasn't me
[1:00:39] it was a Lord Jesus God knows every
[1:00:43] situation and if you really need God or
[1:00:46] you cry out for God he will always
[1:00:48] answer and that's what God did for this
[1:00:51] particular pastor he needed to know how
[1:00:53] to remedy this thing that he was going
[1:00:55] through and God came right on the scene
[1:00:58] I don't know the half because they
[1:01:01] wouldn't tell me you know what I didn't
[1:01:04] want to know it wasn't my business it
[1:01:07] was Christ's business so I say this by
[1:01:11] the grace of God and I'm a closed cuz I
[1:01:14] heard of a brother say Dias and I
[1:01:16] believe and he said the poor was a shout
[1:01:21] and type of the church she knew that the
[1:01:26] messenger or the message had not yet
[1:01:29] circumcised her son and she went into
[1:01:33] action in other words she recognized the
[1:01:38] church recognized that so many people in
[1:01:40] the church that deal didn't have the
[1:01:42] only ghost you know we might have enough
[1:01:47] Holy Ghost to don't do this and don't do
[1:01:51] that
[1:01:52] or maybe wear a certain clothes whatever
[1:01:56] but that doesn't cut it either if you're
[1:02:01] going to be a Christian we got to go all
[1:02:04] the way people and we've got to forget
[1:02:06] what what you think people might you
[1:02:09] know they say they go say you gone crazy
[1:02:12] you losing your mind I'm not saying for
[1:02:17] me because I can't give you nothing
[1:02:21] nothing I can give you another I could
[1:02:23] preach to you I could tell you what I
[1:02:24] know he wants and that he wants full
[1:02:27] surrender and y'all know what I'm saying
[1:02:30] he wants full surrender when you fully
[1:02:34] surrender the guard gotta give you
[1:02:36] exactly what you need
[1:02:37] you know God spoiled those ones either
[1:02:40] that surrenders completely to him pause
[1:02:44] yeah that might sounds pretty bad but I
[1:02:49] asked Abraham about it he got away with
[1:02:53] some stuff you know and and you know you
[1:02:56] look at these things you said brother
[1:02:57] what are you trying to say I'm just
[1:02:58] saying it's gonna be a few I believe
[1:03:00] personally I personally believe that
[1:03:02] this earthquake is closer now than we
[1:03:04] ever thought when that 7-1 hit I thought
[1:03:07] oh Lord
[1:03:09] look at that number look at that number
[1:03:13] seven Church ages plus one and I really
[1:03:17] believe with all my heart that was God
[1:03:18] saying okay get it right get it right
[1:03:23] it's closer now than it's ever been get
[1:03:26] it right you love the Lord you can't add
[1:03:31] one cubit to your statue but I do know
[1:03:34] one thing that all of us need to learn
[1:03:37] how to let God circumcise our hearts
[1:03:41] change me or God change me all of us we
[1:03:49] know what we battle through in our minds
[1:03:51] every day sometime as a Christian I'm a
[1:03:54] shame of the thoughts that I have but I
[1:03:56] don't give up I keep pressing
[1:03:59] I know Christianity is the right thing
[1:04:01] I've seen the pillow fire you see this
[1:04:04] life I've seen that not on a picture
[1:04:07] either reality I've seen that I've seen
[1:04:10] the pillar of cloud I was in India and
[1:04:13] all of a sudden the whole place I was
[1:04:15] preaching with Hindus and everywhere I
[1:04:17] just filled up like the house was on
[1:04:19] fire and I was preaching this message
[1:04:22] and those Hindus ran to the altar to
[1:04:25] confess Jesus Christ as their Savior
[1:04:27] I've seen lights of God but you see that
[1:04:31] still don't give me nothing you
[1:04:34] understand me
[1:04:35] Israel saw far more than I did and they
[1:04:39] all died in the wilderness because they
[1:04:40] didn't believe the Bible said they would
[1:04:42] not mix it with faith so what you hear
[1:04:45] if you don't mix it with faith it won't
[1:04:47] do you any good right you gotta mix it
[1:04:51] with faith you got to believe it you
[1:04:57] love the Lord that's there
[1:05:08] let us pray dear father God we thank you
[1:05:12] for your grace in your mercy Lord I know
[1:05:16] a lot of things were said and I don't
[1:05:20] know why you just took me the way you
[1:05:22] did but I know that somehow you had your
[1:05:27] own purpose being fulfilled father I
[1:05:32] know you spoke to my heart tonight and I
[1:05:35] trusted everyone here tonight has heard
[1:05:37] from you
[1:05:39] Lord there's nothing wrong with being
[1:05:41] more sincere that's what I desire I pray
[1:05:47] father God for my family at home
[1:05:49] touching my mother-in-law revive my
[1:05:53] house Jesus I pray that you give us each
[1:05:57] and every one of us what we stand in
[1:05:59] need of time is short and running out
[1:06:02] but one thing for certain you said
[1:06:04] you've never left yourself without a
[1:06:06] witness there will be those tobe few in
[1:06:10] number that will make a rapture and all
[1:06:15] God I trust and pray that I'm one of
[1:06:17] them bless your people now in Jesus
[1:06:20] Christ's name we pray amen so that you
[1:06:24] understand there will be a lot of people
[1:06:25] missing but the world I never know
[1:06:29] especially during the time of crisis
[1:06:32] there are thousands of people missing
[1:06:35] every day never nobody knows where they
[1:06:37] are
[1:06:39] world is coming to Flying Saucer them
[1:06:41] pick them up but not like the world is
[1:06:48] saying these likes that they do see
[1:06:52] exist I remember my first time ever
[1:06:55] seeing UFOs was in 1977 I was in
[1:06:58] Columbia South Carolina screaming like a
[1:07:02] madman I knew what I saw was
[1:07:05] supernatural but I didn't understand
[1:07:08] what it really was
[1:07:09] now I see things on YouTube the exact
[1:07:13] thing I saw with my own eyes so I know
[1:07:16] other people are seeing new things now
[1:07:18] what people don't understand is that
[1:07:20] these people are this is not UFOs these
[1:07:23] are called investigating angels these
[1:07:26] are beings that God has sent to
[1:07:31] investigate this earth see is it as bad
[1:07:34] as they say that's what he did it it saw
[1:07:38] them sit down investigating angels and
[1:07:44] that's what he's doing now and once you
[1:07:47] start seeing investigating angels you
[1:07:49] know the fires about to fall this world
[1:07:53] is it's finished
[1:07:55] can't go any further from the east to
[1:07:58] the west and we ought to be happy that
[1:08:01] God has called us has chosen us to be a
[1:08:05] vessel to hear his voice in a land and a
[1:08:08] time where there's millions of voices
[1:08:11] how do you know which one is the right
[1:08:14] one because the right one will always
[1:08:20] take this Bible and declare it to be
[1:08:22] truth and we declare it that Jesus
[1:08:25] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:08:28] forever God cannot change
[1:08:48] oh geez you're a friend of mine you
[1:08:58] supply my everything my hungry soul Lord

[1:09:48] me to speak this tonight but I trust by
[1:09:52] God your grace Lord that I pleased you
