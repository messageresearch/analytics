to see everybody out here this evening as we stand let us just turn to Saint John 14. we'll be reading the 20 and the 21st verse and then we'll go to Revelations 10 9-11 John 14 20-21 at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you amen Revelations 10 beginning at the ninth verse and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people and Nations and tongues and Kings let us pray our heavenly father we come before you Lord Jesus as humbly as we know how thank you Father God for tonight thank you for the Precious Blood of your dear son Jesus Christ that washes away all of our sins father it is because of him we could stand tonight amen resting on your mercy and your grace and father we pray like to pray tonight that you bless each and every heart here tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I could feel a little tiredness in the service so we'll try our best not to be very long but I I can't help but to think about what God has done in this day I want to keep it focused I want to keep it in my heart I want to keep it in my mind I don't want it to slip away from me I don't want this message to become common to me I wanted to be a lie you know it's it's just uh you know I wanted to be real every day and so I know in order to keep that alive I must also fellowship with him every day I can't wait to the weekend or wait till Wednesday come to fellowship with him it must be a daily routine that my God and I meet together Fellowship together talk together uh in so doing I would be able to follow his leadership my my subject is come on in the door is opened and you know I was just reading the word and you know brother Branham tells us that the Book of Revelation is a book of symbols and um to really understand that if you would read Ezekiel you'll know that a lot of those things are symbolic that things that are because the writer or the the you know or the the vision that's given can only be explained in a certain way and according and God used human mentality sometimes to describe things uh but he uses that so that it can remain a mystery it literally closes the book um so I want to say that you know we when we talk about the book when we talk about the door when we talk about the bread when we talk about the water those uh things are symbolic uh of of of of of Christ because Jesus said in in in in in in the word of God he said I am that bread of life amen uh and and we know that in in John 10 9 he says I am the door amen that's right Amen in John 14 6 he says I am the way the truth and the life amen right amen he's the author and finisher of our faith according to the word of God and he says I am the word right in John 1 1. and will you and I must understand amen that everything about the Bible spells out the Lord Jesus Christ amen it's all about God it's all about his Redemption plan it's all about his love affair with the bride I get excited because when you think about Genesis how Genesis starts off with you know Adam and then Adam was lonely and then God blesses Adam with a bride that comes right out of him right that's right it's satisfy Adam and then we know according to the prophet's message that God himself amen could not be satisfied until he receive his own bride right we we basically take the loneliness if that's possible because he's got Angels up there he's got seraphims up there he's got all kinds of creatures up there but he wanted his bride there think about this book we're talking about amen it starts off with a love affair between Adam and Eve and of course that was marred it was a shadow in the type of God's love affair with his bride is that right like you've heard me say you don't know somebody loves you or how much they love you until they break a covenant or they offend you in a way Attica said now look Eve I love you I love you I love you but as long as there was no transgression he had no idea what that love was until transgression came and we found out that he was willing to give his life amen for his bride Hallelujah and in the same manner Christ died for us the Bible said if that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us amen hallelujah yes sir and the Bible says according to you know Colossians 2 and 8. we know he's Elohim and the Bible said in him dwell is the fullness of the godhead bodily so when we saw Jesus we saw God in his fullness all of the attributes of God was in Jesus Christ is that right and the Bible said in that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father's in me and I am in you is that right so we understand by the grace of God Amen that that that that God is love and and the Bible said he that have my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me y'all understand what I'm saying because you can do things for people only because of out of works but when when when is love it's a different type of thing right I mean look at the people that literally serve God out of fear with those people that serve God out of fear I mean really uh their works are in vain because he made a statement he said if you love me keep my Commandments that's right the love of God must be in your heart amen amen in order for your Works to be accepted is that right listen the Bible called the Rich Young Ruler like I said the other day the Rich Young Ruler and the Rich Young Ruler was loved by God but he still went to hell he did everything according to the law right but one thing he didn't do he he loved his Earthly possessions more than he loved God more than he loved eternal life is that right because we understand Jesus Christ was the only one that could give eternal life now when we see the book of Revelation and we've heard this so many times you are what you eat right so this message is not given to us just to memorize it's it's given to us to digest Amen to receive it and to digest it and to become it amen right so we understand is that right I mean it's amazing uh uh that that even brother Branham said that the word of God is our vitamins right it is our nutrition it is the thing that keeps us healthy amen so when we look at these things we must understand that the Bible is not for us to just look at it and observe it uh it's good to understand you know the dates and times but that's not what God is looking for in this hour God is looking for individuals who love him so much that he that they surrender their lives to him that they can become him he's looking for individuals that can come unto him in such a way that he could bring a birth in them that will be his offspring amen this is what God is looking for he's looking for little jesuses or little crisis says however you want to say it this is what God is looking for now when the word of God came and he says take it and eat it right and I wonder how often people literally take the word and eat it you know we may practice you know reading it well I read this book and I read that but it's all right that's good but there are many people who have read the Bible through and through maybe several times know all the history behind it but never received it in other words it how do you know when you're receiving the word because when you receive the word it brings changes in your life right it brings faith in your life it brings love in your life it brings a respect for God that you would normally not have amen is that right right come on in and I'm gonna say it like this I'm gonna keep saying it because Jesus says on the door and he says listen I'm knocking at the door of your heart if any man would open he said I would come in and suck right so it's just it's not just opening your mind to the message but it's it's literally inviting Christ in amen remember he preached the message doors and doors he said it's not good enough just to say hey come on in but stop in the living room oh stop in the kitchen he wants to go into the intimate part amen hallelujah because that's what he wants he wants intimacy with his bride Hallelujah glory to God like Revelations 3 and 8 says he is the door what you mean it is an open door to the believer now when I say open door that means the revelation of Christ is give being given out to those who want it those who can receive it he said I'm the only one that can open it and I'm the only one that can shut it y'all remember that remember when the word of God said the door was open and you say Well when in Matthew 25 when five wise and five foolish were called at midnight well just find out that the Five Wives went into the marriage supper of the lamb but there's a time when the five foolish was shut out yes and they came knocking open up the door but it was too late and brother Branham says that when they asked the wise God virgins to give us of your oil they said to the foolish you go pray up yeah Amen brother Brandon was a I tell you like this God in Simplicity has given you the answer to all the questions how can I make a rapture you go pray up is that right so in Revelation 10 8 the book is open and he holds it in his right hand and the Bible said the angel said uh it's to John you know take it and John went and took the book and that wasn't all it wasn't like okay I received the message he says no sir I want you to eat it Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying and it's no strange thing because that's what happened even in the book of of Exodus when the lamb was slain they had to eat the lamb yes right so the book The Bloody lamb and the book that was open is the same God yes it's the same person amen but just in book form that's why brother Brandon talks about the message being the bloody bleeding word of the Lamb it's one and the same the same person but in order to make the actions he said you've got to eat it all up you got to eat the good you got to eat the bad you got to eat the bitter whatever's in there eat it all up he said don't leave nothing hey man come on in God want to have supper time he want to have a time of dining with you is that right it's like on the road to Emmaus when those disciples sat down with Jesus they had no idea who he was he was hiding himself and yet the word of God Amen was what being revealed to them what was it the book was being open yes the Jesus Christ had risen amen the seventh seal of that that moment was being opened to them and he went and he he preached to them started with the prophets from Genesis all the way up to that time showing what how Christ must suffer and die amen he was the lamb for the sins of the world Hallelujah even in this last day when the seals were open what did we see a bloody lamb as though he had been slain from the foundation of the world same land was Jesus Christ Hallelujah and you've heard me preach this before he was a lamb bloody amen and and and and sacrificial lamb but he was the one who defeated Lucifer the dragon yes Hallelujah ferocious about a lamb the lamb is Meek the lamb is humble but this lamb knew how to be led by the father amen because he said I can't do nothing except the father showed me amen is that right I'm in the Father the father's in me I am in you and the bride won't move until she get a thus said the Lord she knows how to be led by the lamb she is a lamb and she knows that Jesus Christ is a great Shepherd amen y'all hear me it's open the revelation of the word is there for us to understand it amen if you read the word of God and you get three Gods then your Revelation is wrong amen if you get two Gods your Revelation is wrong there's only one God Amen and that one God said unto Israel oh here ye o Israel the Lord thy God is one Hallelujah is that right so that's what they even the disciples um the Jews couldn't understand Jesus according to Saint John 10 30. when he said I and my father one think about it even when he told Philip and and the others he said how could it be when you see me you see the father is that right listen this is the way we want God we want God so much in us that when people see us they see the father they see Jesus they understand amen that there's something different about us not because we come to Higher Ground Tabernacle but because we've met the Lord on the backside of the desert brother random was talking about how the Lord in his ministry proved that Jesus Christ was alive and well did you know that that even in your life as as as Believers you must prove to the world that Jesus Christ is alive and well anything about your dressing because more people there are people out there that live dress more Godly than we do sure right it ain't that it's your character amen it's the Christ character in you amen that people will recognize and when they recognize that they see Jesus himself amen right but the only way that you're going to be able to do this is that that word become you and you become the word amen hallelujah it's a union going on but the problem said it's a very invisible Union Hallelujah and that's what we're looking at amen that God oh I got a good I got a good one I got a good quote coming but God would take a little vessel like us unbroken up and messed up and whatever in all kinds of ways and put us back together again in the sanctifiers fill us with the Holy Ghost and you know he doesn't stop there he began to build character in us change us from glory to Glory Hallelujah but in order for that to happen you've got to step into that book amen hallelujah though pages of the book must live and it must live through you yes yes right amen amen here's the message here's uh what president spoke in at the ex physician of the seven show changes he said he was talking to a Hammond and woman he was telling them how Jesus Christ is the same and he says now if I can prove to you and show you that that same Jesus as he promised us that he would do signs and wonders and miracles if I could prove that to you would you then become a Christian and this woman responded Yes he said she said he said she says I accept Jesus as my savior that did it right she was healed and about ten thousand inhabitants came to Christ that day because the gospel was preached in both word and power amen amen God never told a man to labor 30 years and harvest nothing he gave us the open door of the word and Power y'all understand me this dog do we talk about Christ himself the word himself must be word and power amen and that is what we are supposed to use amen that is what what gave Paul is great and effective Ministry First Corinthians 2. 4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but demonstration of the spirit and the power you see this is what the bride is about it's not about sitting in church being preached to and you receiving it intellectually when the word comes let me tell you something I really Lima Ohio and as I preach the word of God people who were seeking the Holy Ghost received it I didn't have to lay hands on them but the Holy Ghost fell and they received the Holy Ghost and this still standing the day that's what I'm talking about the atmosphere must be energized Hallelujah it must be fire and you and I must bring our fire with us because when the atmosphere is on fire the Holy Ghost will step in Hallelujah that's exactly right I'll never forget my daughter said to me one day when she was really young she said Daddy I know why God showed up in the fire when it came to Shadrach Meshach and Abednego I said why honey she said when they heated it up seven times God could step in the fire and be comfortable [Laughter] a mediocre thing we've been giving him God God was excitement he you know it's the truth brother Brown said we come to church to entertain him not to be entertained we come to entertain him Hallelujah I'll be honest with you I was driving home the other day with my wife and we was listening to some music and all of a sudden she had to pull over and go to and it was Christian music we had to go pull over and and get something and she came back and she said can you cut that off she says that's putting me to sleep kind of a music we need anointed music Now understand me people of God you are the one that anoints him when the anointing is in you you anointer the singing is that right the anointing flows out of you Hallelujah Oh Glory right listen and I tried to tell people I don't care if it's a hymn if it's a hymn if you sing it from the soul your soul and anoint that ah that him will become something different to you Hallelujah glory to God right coming from the message Exposition again he said he never told them to go into the world and establish Bible colleges nor did he tell them to pass out literature and we're good at it we'll pass out all Brethren's material yeah they need to see life now let me say it like this you can pray for a person all day and if they don't believe nothing will happen that's right the word is given to he'll believe us to deliver believe us to say believe us amen Jesus couldn't do men Mighty Miracles especially around his hometown that's right can any good thing come out of Nazareth he couldn't do nothing because they were unbelievers Hallelujah y'all understand me even in this church nothing can be done if the people don't believe amen you got to believe that's right that's the only way God is going to move that's right you got to believe that's right amen even when it came to Tabitha amen what did Jesus do he put them all out all the unbelievers get out why he didn't want a negative atmosphere amen and neither do I I want to see God in the positive not the negative amen forget what you went through today forget all your trials forget all your failures Hallelujah we need to worship God tonight and thank him for our life health and strength Hallelujah give him the glory that's due to him sir did you know even in the Old Testament you couldn't come before a king with a sad continent that was all automatic death thank God for his mercy and Grace [Music] brother I hope I'm not going too fast brother Isaac I hope they're getting it to you so you know because I get a chance I get I get stirred I get going and sometimes I forget we got an interpreter Hallelujah anyway and when I you know I'm Southern so I preach to you in a southern English sometimes it's not British so you'll not understand me sometime forgive me okay you know when you need me to slow up just throw your hand up or something do me do something there so you catch my attention my wifey back there like so anyway help me out now those things are fine but Jesus told them to do what was to preach the gospel stick with the word and then the signs will follow the very introduction we have in the way the kingdom of God was to preach was to be preached was when he sent out 12 12 Matthew 10 1-8 he commissioned and instructed them on this wise and when he had called unto him to him his 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast out and to heal all man of sickness in all manner of diseases y'all understand me so what am I saying we can call ourselves a message or we want to but the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe now if that makes you Pentecostal you ought to say hallelujah anyhow amen because I've told message Brothers I said you better be careful yes yes how you say Pentecostal because if you say it in a negative way you could be blasphemed in the Holy Ghost God never took that away from us he literally Advanced us he took us higher but we're to never get rid of the joy that when the Holy Ghost fell on you never get rid of the joy never let the devil take your praise Hallelujah yeah I don't care what they do in America I'm concerned about what they do in heaven the Bible say they worship God all the time Hallelujah they don't have no breaks brother it's always holy holy holy and we don't know what all they're singing but one thing for certain they don't get tired we get tired because we got these old-fleshy bodies but up there they've got the theophany bodies up there they don't get tired you know like I told you before they don't even breathe that's right they don't eat don't eat they don't breathe [Applause] thank you they don't give out of breath so they can hold they can hold a note as long as they want to and it'll still be beautiful right but listen I'm gonna read this for you Hebrews 2 because I think that's what has happened one through eleven therefore Paul is saying we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things we which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip yeah but if the word is spoken by Angels were steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience receive a just recompense of reward how should we escape if we neglect so great salvation ah messy people Believers in the Malachi form Believers in Revelation 10 7. come on how are we going to escape if we neglect so greater salvation which at the first begin to be spoken of the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him amen God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will amen let me show you something you've seen me do this before but I'm gonna do it again tonight one thing about these bottles of water they're the same Jesus says I'm the alpha and omega right amen and we were taught in school we had to see the difference I mean you could have three wagons two of them read and one blue and the teacher would say Circle or draw the line to those two that are the same well you're not they may be same in every aspect except the color and that color makes a difference right because it's blue it's not equal to the red only the red one you draw a line to yeah because it's the same these two bottles are the same right I'm talking about something here because the early church in the latter Church must be the same amen Hallelujah did you know brother Brown said Ephesus had all of the gifts they even had all of the qualities the the statue you see because Ephesus was the original scene that's right amen and they couldn't lack anything The Original Seed had to be the fullness of Christ amen but the Rapture couldn't take place until the after church that's right come on the scene amen amen right but in order for the alpha Church to come on the scene the Omega Church had to be planted that's right it had to die it had to rot amen and then come up through the church ages and this last Church must be like the alpha Church y'all hear what I'm saying now this water now now if I ask you which is the difference I put off oh they look the same the same brand everything on but you see this one is different because it doesn't have as much water is not the same yeah yeah y'all understand what I'm saying and this is why brother Balon says listen if we compared ourselves to the the Pentecostal Church on the zusu street he said we look nothing like it go look it up we don't resemble it that's not right something is wrong amen amen but I believe this message right now is working on a people to translate them amen hallelujah we can't let it slip we can't listen this is an individual walk and I'm trying to tell you you can't worry and look at whatever thing oh their Message Church their message church and we're just divided as anybody else sure now I'm being honest but the word is still the word that's right amen stay with what brother Branham said and you'll be all right say he brought everything that right from the word the urum of Durham the Bible amen he said that was his quote book yes Hallelujah you love the Lord amen amen now what is man that thou art mindful of him you know the scripture goes on and said you make him Lord just just Lord a little lower than the angels say but we don't see everything that's put under his feet but the Bible said according to the ninth verse but we see Jesus who's made little a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crown with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should take touch taste death for every man amen amen I was thinking about that today and I says Lord I said this message is so real to me because no matter nobody likes to fall nobody likes to make a mistake you know none of us like getting upset or anything like that but the grace of God covers you right and you know what God didn't save you not knowing that you were going to do all of the things you've done he knew that yes just like he told Peter you're going to die me three I did not mean three times but it did not hinder the position that God had appointed for Peter before the foundation of the world Amen nothing can Dethrone the bride that's right you better hear what I'm saying nothing can Dethrone the Bride of Jesus Christ God has already set your seed in heaven your seat your chair your throne is waiting for you it doesn't matter what we do here that's right none of us like to sin but if we do the Bible said we have an advocate amen we have Jesus Christ Our Lord we have the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah who washes us and cleanses us from all of our sin we must not forget are perfect for being here in this day right we mustn't forget see in other times the cares of the world and the things that happening in the world it's all right to know the news and things like that I look at it a little bit every now and again and I not look at it it comes through my apps and stuff but my point is it's okay to know those things Jesus spokes up some things about how those people was killed in the tower you know so it's all right but my point is this don't allow anything to distract you now nothing is that right listen even at the coming of the Lord even at the Rapture of the church when the foolish versions are the the denominational church was marching to the rocking Rock and come the bride around once again and as she was stepping every step was Ascension it was taking her Higher and Higher and Higher and and we find out that those that were at the end began to look around we don't need to look around you don't need to look around keep your eyes on Jesus keep your eyes on the purpose of God lord I come to be changed Hallelujah Hebrews 1. I'm Excuse me Hebrews 11 5 says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God right come on in the book is open brother Adam said that that big old snowstorm that was hidden the place right he said he ran the people down ran the other brothers down and he was trying to get out himself and then all of a sudden a boy said to him turn back around go back and he says Ah at first I didn't you know go back that means my death but the voice says go back and then brother random realized it was God thought of this means that's my end I'm gonna go back then as he went and he received God the Holy Spirit spoke to him and says speak to the storm amen amen yes sir amen speak to the storm oh what a son of God see that's what God wants in us not that we're prophets but he wants that same Jesus that he had in US yes amen right amen and then afterwards the storm stopped with its way then the boy says can I walk with you oh Jesus y'all know what I'm saying may I walk with you and Jesus says oh Lord there is nothing greater than I would have other than for you to walk with me but you see he tells the story in several places now I'm talking about translation here I'm talking about God opening up a channel that's there already but you don't see it and he says he thought I'll go buy meaties burial site and just pay tribute to her and and he said when he was there he saw and there she stood in her young self and he said he saw himself young again and she was holding her hands our arms out to him and he was holding his arms out he said something happened I know y'all think I'm crazy but listen God gave him a a glimpse of what it is to be translated even though his body was still here he saw himself he saw her oh my God that's just something but anyway he he moves on with it comes down the mountain and finds out that God stopped the storm [Music] but God put amen not only did God Amen through him stop the storm but God gave him a vision of his wife oh my God Amen listen I'm telling y'all something the closer you get to God the more you see amen is that right I mean even brother Brown said God will take you places yeah that's it he said that amen he'll take you places and he'll tell you something the Rapture is not a group revelation the Rapture is an individual Revelation amen and brother Adam said it it was Enoch's Revelation nobody else's that's right amen and Enoch taught the bride now we find out and the message lay of the sin Church age he said now we found out that Elijah must mean this age to this church to prove that if it was Elijah Elijah after he had give his prophecy did not have to die he was translated and was taken up into heaven a type of the church at the end of this Elijah that will come at the end of his time the church will go in the rapture without going through the shadows of death amen wait a minute did he say that yes he did it'll be the rapture I believe the great Elijah the great one that's to come will be the anointed Elijah that will prophesied for the last days amen amen now he's using that you know like a third or second person but he's talking about himself he was the Elijah amen right so we know that the power that this this open book or this this word open brings the power of the word in you amen it brings the power of the word in you right and that that power is what to transform as well as to translate you amen it is the resurrection power and authority of the word amen this ain't no just denominational thing this is a message that will change you but if you don't eat it up amen You Gotta Eat It that's the only way it gets down and changes you like natural food if you have the food on the outside it'll never change you right but you got to take it in and when you take it in it breaks down and changes you amen that's right it gives you strength strength right so potentially it's in here and what is it the word promised before the foundation the world see what we we feel to see this is the mystery that's been hidden throughout all the ages from Genesis up to now the mystery of God revealed amen hallelujah when the bride herself receives portions of the godhead amen amen yes she does she becomes Queen he is the king right you say oh bring it scripturally when Elsa became Queen yes the king asked said unto her I give you half the kingdom that's right right and she was the one in Authority that put the devil in the Lake of Fire that killed Haman and all of his children got rid of all the Devils Hallelujah and that's who we are at the name of Jesus every Niche about every tongue shall confess and one of these old days they're going to kneel to Jesus and his bride and they're going to testify you were right we were wrong Hallelujah and the Bride of Jesus Christ will be the one judging the world Hallelujah this is who you are amen don't forget your purpose this is who you are Hallelujah press into it press into it don't let nothing distract you right now Hallelujah glory to God listen the word promise for the foundation of the world and around there is only reflects the negative that will reflect the positive the word see and the same thing is the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the word that's in you okay right the body will materialize around the word and the same thing did by Sarah because she had the word inside the word materialized around Sarah and the next thing you know she was turning Young [Music] it was a word it was Christ in Sarah literally creating a new body in her and that's what the word does now the Living Word that we're speeding on the matter we live is that right that's the Bible amen amen then all we have to do is just stay in the atmosphere like Aaron's Rod just stay in the atmosphere the life behind the curtain Hallelujah the life behind us so bad the skin is the one that changes you amen Oh Yes But You Gotta Have It right yes listen to two paragraph 250 he says when the when that old body that she had that first body it had to be changed in order to produce a son you get it that body could not do it this body cannot do it so it'll have to be changed the same way to receive the son how will it take place and when and where is the bride goes it it it goes to glory amen Heavenly heaven for the wedding supper just in type like Isaac and Rebecca when Rebecca went to meet Isaac remember elieza representing now the message that went forth from Abraham and elaesar went forth to find what a bride for Christ or for Isaac he found the beautiful Rebecca in the cool of the evening a little dark-skinned girl coming out with the water pot on her and Eli elieza prayed and said Lord God give me good journey now and success for my master Abraham and he said go go he said go don't take him amongst the Philistines don't don't take her get over here amongst his people showing that the bride of Christ Christ is blood relation right oh my God see you you you he can't marry him until you have a DNA change God has to change your DNA all right and so they went down in this beautiful Rebecca came out and got the water part and he prayed and and water the the camels and whatever more see you notice Rebecca had the final Choice she had to to come to Rebecca you know I I heard brother random say this and I had to listen to this message I can't tell you how many times but brother Bradham said and you can go look it up I'm not may not say it exactly like he said it but look it up in in [Music] um Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said if you re if you believe this message he said that is the new birth yeah amen see what you say you got to be born again well he's trying to tell you that you got to be born again into this message when you receive the message that you must have an experience deep deeper than what you had in Pentecost and you know what I'm saying it can't just remain in the in the inner court it's got to go into the holies of holies that's where the real birth goes and you see what what we don't understand is the Pentecostal and all the other people they don't have the revelation of the word like we do because they they have the spirit and in the place of the soul but the Bible doesn't say the spirit that sin shall surely die the Bible said the soul that sinned shall surely die amen it's all right in the word listen and Rebecca and as long as they work with the spirit they'll never see the soul it's hidden from them they don't know they need to go further Rebecca had to that's why their lives are going out that's why you see what's happening I thought to myself I I looked at a Pentecostal Church shouting and dancing and the other day and I'm like Oh my God look at all of that and the word says they're dead that's right they don't even know it they're dead with all of that they have rejected the message of the hour amen and so therefore they're dead you might have come out election is greater than Grace did y'all know that because you can have Grace all your life but if you're not elected to be bride it does nothing for you but when you're elected to be bride Grace is your inheritance amen hallelujah no weapon formed against you shall prosper Hallelujah and as soon as it was as soon as it was made to her quickly her mind was made up see that's what I try to tell people and nobody gave me the revelation of this message but Jesus Christ himself that's bad when you got to watch that talk back to you I don't understand no Revelation yeah y'all listening to my conversation because she don't understand but anyway let's go on see that's why I say you can't do nothing they know everything but anyway she made up her mind and this is what I'm saying you know you got something maybe you're not where you're supposed to be but you believe this message with all your heart that's Christ that's God in you and he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it amen he's going to complete it yes sir Hallelujah never doubt that [Music] event amen see at the end of the day I want to hear well done you know you know I walk with God and the Bible tells us amen that you know he was he had a testimony let me move on because time is getting late see the mystery of the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord and the body changed for the bride right because the the mystery was you know he came to Abraham and the next time he came to Sarah you know the bride the church and she was impregnated so what were you saying Sodom and gomar knew nothing about what was going on people out there don't know this is not given to them right it's given to a special class of people like the prophet said right so what it what what is it now now it is the most it is the most secret of all things the translation of the Bride will be given to her at the time most needed I mean I typed that in right it's like all things pertaining to God will be a personal revelation as it was to Enoch now when you say well what do you mean I I said there were two translations that we know of more than two but let me just say in the Old Testament There Was Elijah and there was Enoch right is that right Enoch type the bride nor type tribulation period but I'm sorry Enoch type the bride and of course Elijah amen type the bride but when it comes to Noah Noah type what the tribulation period right but Enoch the Bible said Enoch live before God 500 years right but there was another section people said well that's got to be wrong brother but I'm saying this that and the other but let me say it like this for 135 years amen I believe that Enoch was in a time of preparation training like now it has to go with now when the Holy Spirit when the seals were open Brother Bear in shortly passed or went on but he's here the mighty Angel is here and what is he doing he's creating his own bride he's literally changing her it's a secret nobody knows amen nobody knows but the individual that God is working on amen hallelujah glory to God you say give me some scripture the Bible says according to Psalms 81 and 7 thou call is in trouble and I delivered thee amen and I answered thee in the secret place of danda Amen right seven Thunders under their voice oh we cried out Lord there's got to be more of you and God brought the message to us I prove thee at the water of Maribeth right the bitter Waters right amen we realize by the grace of God there is God always doing something when God speaks it's a thunder amen that's the word right amen now don't don't die I'm not into all of that stuff I'm just trying to tell you what brother Brown said you and I must understand we must eat all the words we can't help what people go off on Psalms 9 and 1 and 1-8 y'all got y'all don't mind me dude right he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty [Music] I tell you what if if my hand could make a Shadow you'll see the almighty is there because I'm under the shadow of his wings I'm in a secret place amen hallelujah this message amen I'm in a secret place I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snares of the fallen and from the national and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shall thou trust amen hallelujah his trust shall be thy shield and buckler wait a minute his trust your trust right Hallelujah thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor by the era that lieth by day nor for the pestilence and now y'all know it sounds like David looking tonight in our day right in our day amen showing us don't be afraid of nothing and those of you who might need job don't worry about it God got it set up already yes sir amen he's going to give you everything you need that's right yes sir I've seen him do it yes and you some of y'all never heard this testimony but I remember when I was a young man and I've had all those little kids with me in that time and I have been a full-time missionary not working anywhere uh different churches were helping me in sponsoring me but there came a time I felt like I needed to work again and the Lord told me go choose the place go go find where you want to work now see prayer if you talk to God he'll talk back you know y'all know that we're not working with no Idol no you talk to him and you don't hear nothing and then you fabricate in your mind what you think he might have said no he speaks and and God says no you go you go you go find where you work when you will work well there's a place near my house not far and I went to that place and before I went God told me exactly what to wear see I don't know I'ma tell you something if you have to go apply for a job don't go looking like a bomb a peasant I mean you go looking like royalty yeah man make them people know that you are sure of yourself yes right don't come like the common people in the world here they go dress any kind of way no you go dressed presented yourself like a queen or a king you know you you know what I mean recognize you right they will see you right and so I I went in and I had this certain color jacket on I won't say what color it was now but I had this certain color jacket on and it was my favorite jacket and and Ty and everything I went in this plot for the job and the man said to me oh I'm so sorry we we don't even have a position that you can feel did I drop my head absolutely not I went home praising the Lord I knew God had given me that place you know how we gonna change it around my wife said you know that you just the place where you just file a application he called and said he wants you to come in come back and so when I went back he said I'm gonna tell you now we didn't have no openings we didn't have a place he said but I made a place for you [Applause] and he said I'm gonna tell you I'll tell you what really helped me he said because of the way you addressed I knew you were confidence of yourself amen amen before I became a pastor I worked in that job until then Hallelujah you see what I'm saying God see I just believe like that if I'm a son and a daughter of God the Bible said you ask what you will and it shall be given unto you amen right uh not the consuming of Your Love lost I had a need for that job for my family Hallelujah now I'm almost done just give me a few more minutes Romans 8 11-15 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your modern bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you [Applause] therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh but if you through the spirit do modify the Deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God Amen for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father and if he's your father act like he is that's right know that he is by Revelation know that he is he that comes to God must first believe that he is God and that he's a reward of them that diligently seek Him amen you got to know what you're working with I love it I love it I love it I love it David only had god with him and look how he conquered a giant with God but he said in that day you'll know that I'm in you in me it means inflation and I'm gonna tell y'all something and I know you're gonna think it's crazy I'm I'm no Prophet I'm not near a prophet but my wish my wife was here to to vindicate that I tell I'm telling you the truth I remember more than one time maybe twice at the most uh my wife and I was coming from Atlanta Georgia we lived in South Carolina Columbia and we had to drive I was so tired God we had a long meeting and I was really tired she was tired the kids were tired and I how we pray but all of a sudden now whether the tires are lifted off the pavement or not I I wasn't I didn't have a net long enough to look but my point is something happened in the car and all of a sudden a smoothness came over and we traveled all the way home in a shorter time period than we normally would now this happened twice y'all hear what I'm saying amen now I have been so drunk in this Spirit one time more than once but this time I was so drunk in the spirit brother I was circling the block trying to find my way home and somebody had to stop me they saw me that some of the church members said that ain't that brother Brooks wonder why he and my sister said he lost I was so drunk I didn't know and so they had to put me on the right road to get me home but you see you know it's just what happens at that same little church we had this picture on the wall and and a brother uh was preaching he would not come down from the cross and I don't have that picture but it still exists that same Cloud on this picture literally formed into a lamp and it came off it's like it it was it bleeded off of the picture and it's so Crystal Clear I can't explain it all I know is Supernatural things do happen right I remember you why why am I saying these things it's because I I know he's real I have Supernatural things happening in my life but I want everybody to have Supernatural things it ain't given to just a preacher I'm not a pope I'm not a priest Supernatural supposed to happen in everybody's life amen and listen you don't have to try to make it happen the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe I don't have no more Holy Ghost than you have and the same holy ghost that works with me will work for you amen who is another person translated I'm a close because I can't finish this now he said listen acts 8 39 let's turn and when they would come out of of the water the spirit of the lord caught away Philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing can you imagine he was a man not only just preached but baptized the eunuch and shortly after that he disappears what the eunuch didn't know was that God translated him there yeah translation can mean being taken to another part of the earth or to another dimension yeah it depends on God's destination point it means to be bodily moved from one place to another across time and space now I got my own little theology on this and and I said like this because I've been out to Arizona and I've seen the mountains that brother Branham had to climb I've seen finger points and all of that and I'm thinking to myself how and I've heard stories how brother Branham turns up at a meeting and was hundreds of miles away prior no way he could admit made the meeting on time by traveling by car now I'm just saying whether these things be true or not I believe personally when that squeeze come on God is going to allow us to do things in the Supernatural yes sir that we never thought was possible amen amen right one of the things Jesus did he walked through the door scientifically that that's impossible well his resurrection scientifically is impossible and what's more impossible or seen to be impossible scientifically is when you had people have been dead thousands of years that got up right see you can't limit this message and you can't limit God Amen you can't do it if you do it you either be unbelievable yes but the Bible says all things are possible how many times I've driven a car with no gas none all things are possible amen somebody got to know what I'm talking about and the needle says empty I'm almost done thank people I know you're tired it needs to be bodily moved from one place to another across time and space you literally break all laws of Science and logic and probably disappear in one place and appear in another and you can't tell me that's not possible because Elijah and Moses was upon the mountain right and then John was in our day right and Ezekiel said he took me up about my hair into the heavens now he took him and you can't breathe up there I'm just trying to tell you whatever you're going through never ever ever believe that it's not possible amen I don't even like it when people say God is able God is more than able he's God yeah amen he don't struggle God he's God Amen right yes sir all right I'm gonna leave that part I'll go to the next part the next time but I just I just want to say to you the book is open but you got to eat the book you got to take the message lay in the presence of the son like the prophet God says I was telling her sister the other day I said even if you don't feel like listening listen anyway because it's your inner man that's eating that's right not your flesh it's your inner men that's eating not your flesh so always play them play them play them play them the devil said well you done heard that one before you know that's the devil telling you that right right because I don't have no no problem with the eating a second piece of chicken or a third piece of chicken but you don't have a piece of chicken already well I want another piece so that's how it is with the word of God don't ever get tired of it you love the Lord I appreciate your coming amen let's stand oh gosh when we see what God has done for us he's done a great thing I love the Lord because he's a God that cannot change and will not change friends will change on you family will change on you but Jesus never change he's the same yesterday today and forever and I love him I love him I love him he said brother Brooks do you devil disappoint him I'm sure I do but the Bible tells me that his love for me is Everlasting and unfailing and I'm so grateful for his Mercy because his mercy endureth for all generations I love his Mercy I love his grace most of all I love his love and my desire to see that fullness of that Divine love that Divine love just just just overshadow me feel me like David said let my cup run over God I just thank you for your goodness against stirred Lord I get emotional I can't help it I see what you're doing and father I want to be in tune with your word I want to step right with you Lord in Jesus Christ's Name Lord bear ask this little assembly restore the joys of the people Lord touch their bodies o God in your name Jesus Christ we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy Have Thine Own Way Lord Bless the people May something I'm trusting something was said tonight that they'll be able to hold on to but they'll be able to grow by in your name Jesus [Music] in moments like these I'll sing out a song I'll sing out a love song to Jesus in moments like these I lived up my hands I lift up my hands to you Lord singing I Love You Lord seeing it I love you Lord singing I love you Lord I let's say one more time is a song leader come in moments like these are very divide that needs prayer
