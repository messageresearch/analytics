[0:01] Hey I felt dad that was pretty good
[0:08] thank the Lord Jesus was great save me
[0:11] here when I see the blood I'll pass ooh
[0:18] that took me somewhere thank the Lord
[0:23] for His grace glad to have everybody
[0:25] here or you man in the house of the Lord
[0:29] Amen sister seer appreciate your being
[0:32] here by God's grace always good to see
[0:34] you as we stand we're going to just go
[0:40] and read a short script you're gonna try
[0:43] to finish I don't know if I will be able
[0:45] to or what we started this morning first
[0:48] John 2 & 8 you don't be blood means more
[0:57] to me now than ever the unveiling of God
[1:01] [Laughter]
[1:04] hallelujah it in the thirst for his
[1:10] righteousness
[1:11] Amen means more to me than ever just
[1:16] want to be like it first John 2 & 8
[1:27] first John 2 & 8 it reads
[1:37] again a new commandment I write unto you
[1:41] which thing is true in him and in you
[1:47] because the darkness is past and the
[1:51] true light now shining
[1:55] let us pray father we thank you for your
[1:58] grace and your mercy we thank you for
[2:01] being so good to us you are our all in
[2:07] all and we thank you for this morning
[2:10] service we pray father God that you
[2:13] bless the service in a special way we'll
[2:16] be careful to give you the praise glory
[2:18] and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[2:20] amen
[2:21] you may be seated as we spoke this
[2:25] morning we dealt with one God and I
[2:30] tried to bring it from an angle where
[2:33] all of us can see that this God is not
[2:37] something placed in a bottle you can
[2:44] never put God just in a bottle sometimes
[2:48] we say a box but you got to understand
[2:52] that even when God was in Jesus and the
[2:55] fullness of himself
[2:57] God still was on the throne because God
[3:04] is omnipotent he's omnipresent God comes
[3:08] along and when he feels you and he feels
[3:10] me there's still more of him I like that
[3:15] because I want just as much as I can get
[3:18] of him and you must realize by God's
[3:22] grace that Jesus Christ wasn't faking it
[3:27] when he stood there and he spoke and
[3:30] said father at that the tomb of Lazarus
[3:33] his father I know you hear my prayer he
[3:37] wasn't an actor that was reality that
[3:43] was the man Christ Jesus standing there
[3:46] talking to L or him
[3:49] and you must realize that even though it
[3:51] looked like two is still one because God
[3:57] is one we look at the pillar of fire and
[4:02] we know that God was in Moses but God
[4:07] also when God stepped into Moses Moses
[4:11] still had to listen to God he still had
[4:15] to find a place to pray because God is a
[4:19] spirit God is existence without God
[4:25] there would be no existence because God
[4:29] is the one who created everything and
[4:32] the Bible says everything that was
[4:35] created and made was made by him we know
[4:39] by God's grace II we he began to unfold
[4:42] himself in dispensations he broke
[4:46] himself down so much so into a man you
[4:49] and I could understand him these little
[4:52] peanut brains amen we got parakeet
[4:54] brains you know what I'm saying when it
[4:56] comes to the intelligence of God the
[4:58] officers of God we could never
[5:00] understand him the Bible said that his
[5:04] ways of passed finding out and so God
[5:07] had to find a way so that you and I can
[5:11] understand him one of the great things
[5:13] that God loved is fellowship yeah uh you
[5:17] know I we we look and see what Adam did
[5:19] how Adam failed and failed but we we
[5:24] don't see the pain that it calls God
[5:29] even though God knew it was going to
[5:32] happen
[5:33] God has feelings and we know that we can
[5:38] grieve him but yet he still remains God
[5:44] our thought of him we we liken God we we
[5:48] sometime we we we we how can I say it
[5:52] limit God when God is unlimited we think
[5:58] sometimes our problems cannot be solved
[6:00] because they may be great too
[6:04] but even God in the book and the Old
[6:06] Testament says a nation is like a drop
[6:10] in the bucket and you and I when it
[6:13] comes to the vastness of God the power
[6:16] of God we have only scratched the
[6:19] surface do you realize that the Holy
[6:22] Ghost himself that little pinpoint in
[6:26] your heart where God seals you it's just
[6:30] a token it is just a small piece of your
[6:38] inheritance and realize that this thing
[6:42] that's in you it's transforming you into
[6:47] what he is in other words he planted a
[6:52] seed on the inside of you that would
[6:55] literally grow into himself God
[7:01] rebirthing or creating himself in you as
[7:08] we were saying this morning when the
[7:11] children of Israel when God came along
[7:14] and he he
[7:16] Christ raised from the dead he took
[7:20] those all godly Saints that died under
[7:24] be under the our sacrifice of bulls and
[7:28] goats and bull oxen you know turtledoves
[7:32] and those Amen who sacrificed and
[7:36] believed that when they died that God
[7:39] would remember them it's amazing because
[7:43] God knew exactly which grade to go to he
[7:49] never lost count of those who died in
[7:52] faith and when he rose from the dead
[7:55] those who rested in him rose with him
[7:58] and folks they didn't just go to
[8:02] paradise because paradise was done away
[8:05] with they went beyond paradise they went
[8:09] beyond the Angels quarters they were
[8:12] beyond the region of the Archangels
[8:16] man they went into a place a man that we
[8:20] we we we came comprehend with our minds
[8:24] and you and I must realize it meant that
[8:27] we did not come here to settle to be of
[8:32] some kind of a religious organization
[8:37] that organizations as a man let me say
[8:41] it like this when you and I have
[8:43] children there are our children are
[8:45] entities of us there they're part of us
[8:48] and we give them that liberty and that
[8:51] freedom amen to discover themselves and
[8:53] to know who they are and what they are
[8:56] and their potential we give them that
[8:58] and that's what God is giving us he's
[9:01] giving us that Liberty to understand who
[9:04] we are what we are where we came from
[9:06] and where we're going but if we allow if
[9:10] we set would take our children and set
[9:13] them up in a room and close them in that
[9:15] door and says listen you can't go out of
[9:17] this this room this is rude you Ruth I'm
[9:19] here to save you I'm here to keep you
[9:22] I'm here to protect you
[9:24] and so therefore I'm gonna lock you up
[9:25] in this room and you can't go beyond
[9:27] this room you know what that would do it
[9:32] protect it would particularly it would
[9:34] actually excuse me send your child
[9:37] insane a dog could do it a cat couldn't
[9:42] do it and here's a man an inquisitive
[9:45] man a man with intelligence a man who
[9:47] who can reason a man who knows that he
[9:51] has been made and created to be free
[9:54] remember I said this morning I said all
[9:58] of that to sell
[9:59] that's what denominations do that what
[10:02] organizations do they plant a wall
[10:03] around you and they hinder your growth
[10:06] you may be a son you may be a daughter
[10:08] or of God but you'll never grow to your
[10:10] full potential because you have these
[10:12] walls you have these systems that have
[10:15] now closed you in and you can only
[10:17] believe if you've never seen the
[10:20] sunshine you never was able to have
[10:22] windows that we can look out and see the
[10:24] Sun you'll never know the Sun exists
[10:26] see that's what walls do it
[10:30] Prison you you understand me this
[10:33] message has not come to imprison you it
[10:36] has come to set you free it has come to
[10:39] let you know that there are no
[10:41] limitations to who you are as there is
[10:45] no limitation to who God is
[10:47] when you get the Holy Ghost it is not
[10:50] the summit it is not at the end of your
[10:54] journey it is just only the beginning of
[10:58] your journey God has given you something
[11:01] now where you can experience and
[11:04] understand those things that you cannot
[11:06] see with your eyes smell with your with
[11:09] your nose here with your ear hallelujah
[11:12] is that right he's giving you something
[11:14] now that could come in tune you into a
[11:18] world that science is trying to tap into
[11:24] hello God amen was transporting people
[11:29] before science ever thought about it
[11:32] hallelujah God amen new time travel
[11:37] before science ever thought about it
[11:41] hallelujah God amen was trying to tell
[11:45] us that even as a son of God hallelujah
[11:47] you have power over the elements is that
[11:51] right when Jesus listen is that true the
[11:55] king says listen I have thrown or didn't
[11:59] I throw throw three men in this fiery
[12:02] furnace but now I'm looking in the sting
[12:05] and now there's four watch this now
[12:10] because the fourth one he says look like
[12:13] the Son of God hallelujah but what about
[12:17] the other three how come they will not
[12:21] consume because the fourth man in the
[12:24] fire y'all understand me these things
[12:28] that God allowed us to see amen on such
[12:32] a level with oh what a miracle it would
[12:35] have never been a miracle in heaven
[12:39] because that's the way it is in heaven
[12:42] everything is subject
[12:44] you everything is subject to God is that
[12:47] Alright all things are possible to them
[12:52] that believe is that okay so you and I
[12:57] must understand God's existence there's
[13:00] only one God at the end of all things
[13:03] there will only be one God everything
[13:08] that has called itself God
[13:10] everything that has pretended to be God
[13:12] will be done away with and the only
[13:17] thing that will be left is the holiness
[13:20] of God he is the Alpha he is the Omega
[13:27] and what we need to do that's why we
[13:30] come to church you know we come to
[13:32] church to get charged or recharged is
[13:36] that right oh absolutely that's what the
[13:39] Prophet God said he meant recharge your
[13:42] battery here in the world of God should
[13:45] recharge you so oh I don't need
[13:52] recharging well even Jesus Christ needed
[13:55] recharging and he was God himself
[13:57] manifested in the flesh he literally got
[13:59] away from his disciples so he could be
[14:01] recharged hallelujah you and I must
[14:07] understand that everything is one when
[14:16] you get to heaven you're not going to
[14:18] see three you're going to see one even
[14:22] when you get to heaven there will be a
[14:24] number
[14:25] no man can number and win it all adds up
[14:31] it will still be one bride hmm you and I
[14:41] must understand the darkness has passed
[14:45] the Bible says there shall be light in
[14:48] the evening time when we look at at what
[14:55] the
[14:56] as Davis says Davis says amen he's a
[14:59] light unto my path way he's a lamp unto
[15:02] my feet in other words when Christ comes
[15:06] in your heart and into your life you're
[15:08] no longer dwell in darkness you're
[15:12] dwelling in the light that's why the
[15:15] Bible said when Jesus come again he said
[15:18] listen you will not be overtaken like a
[15:20] thief because you're not like a thief in
[15:24] the night he says why because you're no
[15:26] longer children of the darkness but you
[15:28] are children of the light and when
[15:30] Christ is in you that light is in you he
[15:34] says now he says I am he said I am the
[15:37] light of the world he said when when
[15:38] Alan he says one day you we become the
[15:41] light of the world see since also so you
[15:44] and I must understand we have a mission
[15:47] and our mission is to be the light of
[15:51] the world we can't act like them we
[15:54] can't walk like him we can't talk like
[15:56] them we can't live like them we must be
[16:00] the standard for this day a light unto
[16:06] them how else will they see it must be a
[16:10] difference we cannot be the same we
[16:13] cannot look the same Amen light and
[16:16] darkness is two different things and I
[16:20] as I understand science describe
[16:22] darkness as the absence of light that's
[16:29] why God puts us us in various places so
[16:32] that we can know and see Amen that
[16:35] whether you be a janitor whether you be
[16:37] a teacher teacher whether you be a
[16:38] scientist whatever you are when God
[16:41] incarnates himself in you you become
[16:44] that light you become Jesus on the job
[16:50] hallelujah and if you have not become
[16:53] Jesus on the job you must allow God to
[16:56] make you Jesus on the job that's what he
[17:01] got you there for don't you realize if
[17:03] you're not Jesus on the job you're going
[17:06] to have to give an account for it
[17:08] if somebody says
[17:10] at that judgment I didn't know she was a
[17:13] Christian I didn't know he was a
[17:15] Christian the blood is on your hands
[17:18] because you've been set there is that
[17:24] right you say what do you say the Bible
[17:26] says that the family of heaven and earth
[17:29] is named after him so if you got the
[17:34] Holy Ghost on the inside you supposed to
[17:36] be the light of God to show those people
[17:40] there is a difference when everybody is
[17:44] hating and easy on each other and just
[17:46] had everybody strong you supposed to be
[17:49] the Lamb of God but they are so jealous
[18:00] of me they supposed to be you're
[18:04] supposed to be so salty wherever you are
[18:07] it ought to make them want to be like
[18:09] you and the truth of the matter is you
[18:13] supposed to tell them they can be like
[18:16] you how existence as I said we only
[18:23] exist because he exists if there was
[18:28] such thing if there was such a thing
[18:29] that God would die when he would die you
[18:31] would die because his life life is God
[18:36] God is life remember I said that this
[18:38] morning there is no other life o chão
[18:43] don't you live like that you missing out
[18:46] on life the light they're talking about
[18:49] is not life
[18:50] that's death you're not missing out on
[18:54] anything oh because you get drunk and
[18:56] throw up in the morning excuse me I'm
[18:58] missing out on that goody-goody y'all
[19:03] understand me oh because you can do the
[19:06] crack in the cocaine and get sick and
[19:08] dry up and die I missed out on that good
[19:11] oh because you can live just this kind
[19:16] of life where you can go from one person
[19:18] to another and contract all kinds of
[19:20] diseases
[19:21] oh you're missing
[19:23] jonad good I'm missing our own death
[19:29] good oh you ain't nothing but a square
[19:34] yes sir and that city is built for
[19:38] square hallelujah and unanimous
[19:46] understand by God's grace that God has a
[19:49] place for you and I mean and we must
[19:53] live it it doesn't mean you won't be
[19:57] human but God expects some soup out of
[20:02] you some super human times amen
[20:06] hallelujah jesus wept as a man he's not
[20:11] expecting you to get rid of your
[20:13] emotions jesus wept as a man but as a
[20:17] prophet of God said when he rolled back
[20:18] those shoulders and said aloud
[20:20] come forth that wasn't a man that was
[20:24] God Hey and you and I have the same
[20:28] ability but you and I must stay
[20:34] connected remember I said that it is the
[20:37] devil's business he's trying to block
[20:39] you from becoming what you supposed to
[20:42] be
[20:44] hallelujah have you ever seen people
[20:47] well I used to have a prison ministry
[20:49] and you go to the prison and you find
[20:51] these these intelligent men locked up in
[20:55] jail intelligent smart artists musicians
[20:59] whatever they may be they could have
[21:01] been such a blessing to the world but
[21:03] guess what the devil trapped them block
[21:06] them
[21:07] so therefore this this these gifts that
[21:10] they have can never be expressed to the
[21:12] world and then because they have been
[21:14] entrapped here I understand me the
[21:20] Hollywood Hollywood don't have the most
[21:23] beautiful women out there there are far
[21:27] more beautiful women than that in
[21:28] Hollywood I've seen him in charge hello
[21:33] you see these beautiful women with no
[21:36] makeup and you think to yourself what
[21:38] would they look like if they had the
[21:41] extra that the world has come on
[21:45] somebody you know I must realize Amen
[21:48] that the grade is the cream of the crop
[21:50] are those people that serving God
[21:53] they said Brotherhood you don't look
[21:55] like you 63 you know why I've been
[21:58] touched by God I don't run the streets
[22:03] hallelujah amen I live a clean life
[22:06] hallelujah glory to God I see some of my
[22:11] friends that graduate with me and they
[22:12] look 10 to 20 years older some of them
[22:15] dead why they living in a different
[22:18] world I'm living in a life a world of
[22:23] life you said what do you mean brother
[22:25] Brooks I am not supposed to be growing
[22:27] older I'm supposed to be growing younger
[22:31] and the more I grow younger guess what I
[22:34] don't know how it's going to be but I
[22:36] believe that someday these wrinkles are
[22:39] gonna disappear this gray hair is going
[22:42] to move something's going to feel back
[22:46] in my because God promised it he is a
[22:50] God of restoration you say it can't
[22:54] happen in this day it did for Abraham
[22:58] Abraham and Sarah was turned back to a
[23:01] young and man young man and young woman
[23:04] we're in their time and after Sarah died
[23:09] Abraham got married again and had more
[23:11] children it's okay it's still one if you
[23:19] and I can stay connected and see this is
[23:22] why we talking about moving up the
[23:24] ladder faith virtue knowledge temperance
[23:26] patient godliness brotherly kindness
[23:28] holy zone divine love because once you
[23:31] get behind the curtain and brother Aaron
[23:35] says you know what we need to do he
[23:37] didn't set the curtain shut it you know
[23:40] once you get in there stay there because
[23:43] that's where the eternal life starts
[23:46] you understand me it blossoms rather
[23:50] aaron's rod that was dead nobody knew
[23:52] what kind of stick that was they didn't
[23:56] know by God's grace I meant what kind of
[23:58] rod that was what kind of tree it came
[24:00] off of but once it got behind the veil
[24:04] the life of God feel that rod see you
[24:08] can't you can't be in the Holy of Holies
[24:10] and stay there hmm it's not an
[24:14] up-and-down experience once you get back
[24:17] there what you are now in heavenly
[24:20] places in Christ Jesus you understand me
[24:24] he can only produce life there is no
[24:26] depth not death don't have power over
[24:30] Shekinah hey hallelujah
[24:34] don't care how long you've been there
[24:36] get back there and all of a sudden you
[24:39] start block blooming hallelujah all of a
[24:43] sudden Amen you began to bear fruit
[24:47] hallelujah did you know that you and I
[24:50] are fruits on the Tree of Life
[24:56] hello I didn't say the tree of knowledge
[24:59] of good and evil remember I told you
[25:02] Jesus said you either make the tree good
[25:04] or make it evil you cannot make heaven
[25:08] being the tree of the knowledge of good
[25:11] and evil he meant science and mind over
[25:14] matter and I'm gonna live right and I'm
[25:17] gonna do right and I'm not gonna do this
[25:19] and I'm not gonna do that that is up the
[25:21] tree of good and evil but when you're
[25:24] born again you're born of the tree of
[25:29] life and that tree can only bring fruits
[25:33] of life whoo is that right it ain't my
[25:38] word Jesus are you either make the truth
[25:40] good or you make it evil you make it up
[25:46] God or you make it up the devil you
[25:50] understand me see when Jesus raised from
[25:53] the dead and I said that this morning
[25:54] when he raised from the dead he showed
[25:57] he was he told he told Mary Martha
[26:00] I am the resurrection that was before he
[26:03] died and he proved he was a resurrection
[26:06] and not only did he was was he
[26:08] resurrected but he also brought all of
[26:12] those saints and patriarchs that had
[26:14] been laying in the grave for hundreds of
[26:16] years I love that I love that if God can
[26:20] take gust and Reese Ormand and reshape
[26:23] it into the very image it was headed
[26:25] perfect state before it died Abraham
[26:29] didn't raise an old man Sarah didn't
[26:31] raise a whole woman Joe wasn't an old
[26:34] man he raised from the dead in his youth
[26:38] he went into heaven in his youth and
[26:41] then we worry about cancer tubercle
[26:45] whatever disease we worry about that
[26:47] when you can all you got to do is
[26:50] connect with God and God and make it all
[26:54] right hallelujah Oh glory to God is that
[26:59] okay you and I must understand we're
[27:02] talking about God he's in all above all
[27:05] through all he's everywhere you can't
[27:08] get rid of him unless said you can't get
[27:12] rid of him you not living you breathing
[27:14] this air did you know God create an air
[27:19] for you you never heard about a breath
[27:23] until God created Adam out of the dust
[27:26] and Adam lived before he was in the dust
[27:29] but once God put him in the dust God
[27:32] gave him a breath when you and your
[27:35] fearfully you don't breathe there's no
[27:38] blood in heaven flesh and blood will not
[27:42] enter that's why when you hear that
[27:46] heavenly choir to go yeah I can't hold
[27:49] it now they can hold it for as long as
[27:51] they want to because they don't have to
[27:53] they don't eat they don't have to eat
[28:02] there's no blood that need oxygen there
[28:11] hallelujah but did
[28:13] you know what breath just signifies you
[28:18] living you're dying you're gonna end
[28:22] this into that but when you're in God
[28:30] don't get me wrong
[28:31] those those Saints over there that's in
[28:34] God they're waiting to come back down
[28:36] here now I don't know what the glorified
[28:38] body is gonna consist of how it's gonna
[28:41] be but I know one thing it'll be able to
[28:43] transfer Trent
[28:46] how could I say it it'll be able to walk
[28:48] through the walls when Jesus rose from
[28:53] the dead what did he do he walks through
[28:55] walls here to be able to disappear and
[28:58] appear and yet it still be able to eat
[29:05] go to God yeah I don't know I'm having a
[29:09] good time up here why because there is
[29:12] no ending to the believer just like
[29:15] there really was never a beginning you
[29:19] did not begin here you you existed
[29:24] before you came into your mother's womb
[29:27] you know where you are you were in
[29:30] Elohim that's why you love the gospel
[29:33] that's why you can't turn it loose let
[29:36] me put it this way
[29:37] that's why he can't turn you a loose you
[29:42] returned home and what we go through
[29:46] this is a short period of time think
[29:49] about it
[29:50] James says is a vapor then happening
[29:55] you've seen a vapor it just goes comes
[29:58] and goes who was what was that
[30:00] right that's our light here and I don't
[30:03] understand what people will it will
[30:05] exchange a vapor for eternal life it
[30:09] makes no sense to me but when you come
[30:13] to know that God is God he's the God of
[30:16] heaven he's the god of Earth he's a God
[30:19] of hell and the Bible said every knee
[30:21] shall bow every tongue shall confess
[30:24] that
[30:25] is Lord to the glory of God hallelujah
[30:29] if we understood if we could understand
[30:32] when you're born into the family of God
[30:34] amen you know one thing about those
[30:37] Brooks's they all got to hear - like it
[30:39] can't help it they got their daddies
[30:43] here someone might look a little more
[30:47] like their mama but one thing about that
[30:51] head is something about their head they
[30:52] say they all look alike and it's true
[30:55] they can't help it
[30:56] that's how it is with somebody's born of
[30:58] God if you born of God you got to look
[31:01] like him you can't even help it it's in
[31:06] the genes
[31:07] Oh Lord listen what am i preaching for
[31:14] I'm trying to tell us you and I if we're
[31:18] not careful like that like that like
[31:21] that Lutheran settled and became their
[31:24] organization the Methodists settled
[31:26] became an organization the Pentecostals
[31:29] settled became an authorization the the
[31:33] message believers have settled right
[31:35] they may not organize on paper they may
[31:41] not go to the courts and do it
[31:42] spiritually they're doing things they
[31:45] shouldn't what are they doing suddenly
[31:47] this is not a time to settle like I said
[31:51] this is not the summit I got a good talk
[31:54] for you you and I must realize by the
[31:56] lens that God is trying to bring us into
[31:59] another realm
[32:00] we cannot stop here it's too much to be
[32:04] done too many things God wants to do
[32:08] through who you and I what good is the
[32:14] blood of Jesus Christ if it cannot show
[32:17] us victorious in our age Christ must be
[32:23] victorious in this age we cannot go out
[32:26] here as losers we can't go out here oh
[32:31] when you formalize or will you become
[32:33] starchy and you come to a place Amen
[32:36] that you all set oh praise God I'm in
[32:38] the message you just
[32:39] that one little notch from death hello
[32:45] you got to keep going like the like the
[32:47] Lutheran's became Methodists the
[32:49] Methodists became Pentecost Pentecost
[32:52] became the message and the message
[32:53] become who he himself you and I must
[32:58] become him manifested Christ in his
[33:03] people today Hebrews 13:8 says he's the
[33:08] same yesterday today and forever
[33:11] we are the fullness and the Bible said
[33:14] they cannot be complete without us we
[33:20] must but we must learn how to strip
[33:23] ourselves right you and I must alter we
[33:28] ought to be tired
[33:29] a man of trying to think in such a
[33:31] Pharisee way you're no better than the
[33:35] Baptist the method of the presbytery
[33:37] whatever they call themselves
[33:39] you know why we all say by grace I heard
[33:44] a brother say we're one family what
[33:50] happened to those disciples when they
[33:51] saw those people who were under John's
[33:54] ministry they went over them and says
[33:59] hey have you received the Holy Ghost
[34:01] since you believe oh they didn't say you
[34:04] weren't Christian oh you're not
[34:05] Christians no they didn't say that have
[34:07] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[34:10] believe they said we haven't heard
[34:11] whether there be a Holy Ghost then they
[34:13] say well what baptism you see what I'm
[34:15] saying bathing he Christianize him they
[34:18] took him where they were preached the
[34:20] word brought him up to today's date if
[34:24] they're real they come on if they're
[34:27] genuine they're come on if they're not
[34:32] neva perhaps that's what they were
[34:34] ordained for not on somebody see that's
[34:40] what keeps the house of God divided
[34:47] hello and Satan gonna do his job but
[34:54] Paul says you know you need to contend
[34:56] for the faith you fight you contend for
[35:00] the faith in the Corinthians say to the
[35:03] Ephesians you're not of the body and the
[35:06] Corinthians was a bad church they work
[35:10] on oh is that right Ephesians were like
[35:14] us you know we the message oh come on
[35:19] somebody but he fees you can say the
[35:23] term Corinthians you're not part of God
[35:25] or Christ because look how calling you

[35:44] Holy Spirit who's somebody help me here
[35:47] I'm trying to trying to go fast but I
[35:50] want you to understand help help us Lord
[35:55] because before we came to this message
[35:57] where were we
[35:58] now did we become seen after we came to
[36:02] the message no we will recede before
[36:05] hallelujah hey man and because we will
[36:07] see God came to you that's the way it
[36:12] goes and how how God comes you know what
[36:16] God does when he comes to you you know
[36:18] what God when God came to Abraham guess
[36:19] what he did he jumped into a man walked
[36:22] in Abraham in a man that's how God comes
[36:27] in this day in a man chapel's when he
[36:35] was up here and you can even though a
[36:36] message church was here right God came
[36:39] to you in the man or was it the other
[36:46] way around
[36:47] hi everyone you had the books writer who
[36:50] had the books okay but the point is God
[36:54] use you both right though you willing
[36:59] the message already you didn't know
[37:02] so God knows what he's doing
[37:05] God uses us even when we don't even know
[37:08] God using us can I go on just give me a
[37:14] little bit more amen hallelujah
[37:18] now he said and we know that his
[37:20] testimony is to root without error
[37:25] without fault God's testimony it's true
[37:28] right and if God said he's gonna have a
[37:31] bride it is true there is a bride is
[37:35] that Alright amen you think about Amen
[37:38] when it comes to Amen to this church in
[37:40] itself and then here it was me and Keith
[37:42] connecting and his mother's hospital
[37:45] room hello a man all the way from Des
[37:50] Moines meeting the man from sorrow hi oh
[37:55] how did I get here
[38:01] it's just okay was it God it was all God
[38:07] hallelujah He is God he knew it before
[38:12] the foundation of the world he knew it
[38:15] was going to be even with his church was
[38:17] going to be packed with people they just
[38:28] don't come like they used to
[38:31] amen but still yet the gospel doesn't go
[38:36] out void hallelujah how are the world
[38:40] going to see Jesus if they don't see him
[38:41] in US my wife and I was just at our
[38:49] restaurant here and getting some food
[38:52] and and the lady made the wrong salad
[38:54] and and because my wife didn't want no
[38:56] blue cheese on her salad
[38:58] the lady lady come up who's making the
[38:59] salad just throwing things pop pop and I
[39:02] could see the devil he wanted us to
[39:04] respond to that reaction and my wife and
[39:07] I just stood still and we called each
[39:10] other thought I didn't say nothing she
[39:12] didn't either but we saw the devil and
[39:14] we didn't give him her flat he we didn't
[39:16] give the pleasure to the devil
[39:17] we kept quiet hmm and then the lady calm
[39:21] down you understand me we could have in
[39:25] the old day oh yeah but you see the Holy
[39:32] Spirit knows how to say shame the devil
[39:39] is this okay
[39:41] now when Jesus raised this is what I
[39:43] mean let me say like this as I said it
[39:46] this morning now god of the he's God of
[39:48] the universe I can't help but to think
[39:51] about how all of those stars out there
[39:54] operating staying in place nothing's
[39:57] fallen ain't no such thing as a falling
[39:59] star that's a media or something
[40:01] something I'm kind of wrong no star
[40:04] moves out of its place once that happens
[40:08] everything else moves it's like a magnet
[40:10] one pool the other hello oh you said
[40:14] brother coach I don't know that well let
[40:15] me ask you a question how come the moon
[40:17] has such a pool on your earth you don't
[40:20] even feel it
[40:20] I don't but the tidal wave those waves
[40:23] got water out there knows Amen when the
[40:26] moon is close and when it's far away hmm
[40:29] think about it and you look at your God
[40:32] as it is you know yes God is in the Sun
[40:34] but nobody ever asks the question what
[40:38] keeps the Sun burning at the same
[40:42] temperature it has always burned there's
[40:47] a power behind that and if you move that
[40:52] Sun that natural Sun out of this place
[40:55] guess what it's going to set all of us
[40:58] if it ever go black like the scientists
[41:01] say you and I will die and everything
[41:05] else that lives that's exactly what it
[41:08] is God if God was they ever go black dye
[41:13] you and I would die too
[41:14] he is the only existence you understand
[41:18] me and God cannot lie I'm so glad to be
[41:23] part of him
[41:26] don't you understand because of him I'm
[41:29] here because of him you were here don't
[41:32] you think you understand me he had moves
[41:35] he had stars he had all of these
[41:37] Archangels and angels and Seraphim and
[41:39] cherubim and then he thought about you
[41:43] not to be a self-image share them but he
[41:47] thought of you to be a son and daughter
[41:48] of God I want you with me not like I
[41:54] said the kingdom of God the kingdom of
[41:56] Helen amen is all the churches all the
[41:58] Christians all who claim to be Christian
[42:00] lodging in this big big tree called
[42:03] Christendom but the kingdom of God only
[42:06] Holy Ghost feel people entering there
[42:09] why because they're the only ones that
[42:12] goes into the city they're the only one
[42:15] that goes in the city they sit on his
[42:18] throne with him king and queen you mean
[42:24] to tell me when God was God all by
[42:27] himself I was somewhere in there you and
[42:32] I was in the existence wherever it came
[42:35] from however he came from you and I were
[42:38] there because one thing about eternal
[42:41] life is not created you know eyes can't
[42:48] even comprehend it how can we lose
[42:51] that's why Paul said all death where is
[42:54] your sting o grave where is your victory
[42:57] thanks be to God who gives us the
[43:00] victory through our Lord and Savior
[43:02] Jesus Christ oh that's why the devil
[43:05] don't want people to get the Holy Ghost
[43:07] he doesn't care about your religion he
[43:09] just don't want you to be really born
[43:11] again he doesn't want you to get the
[43:14] power from heaven because once God
[43:16] approves you all heaven and earth must
[43:19] obey you
[43:20] is that right your position in God is
[43:23] higher and greater than the Archangel
[43:28] whew one more thought is that all right
[43:34] as they're 45 5 through 7 says I am the
[43:37] Lord there is none else there is no God
[43:40] beside me i girded thee though thou has
[43:44] not known me that they may know from the
[43:47] rising of the Sun and from the West that
[43:50] there is none beside me I am the Lord
[43:53] and there is none else is that right
[43:56] hallelujah oh oh let me say it no matter
[44:01] what it is 1 1 you get to a man and a
[44:05] woman they married guess what happened
[44:06] they become one
[44:08] that's God's perfect plan right amen
[44:14] you know her son is the husband moon is
[44:17] the wife it's always been that way
[44:21] you understand me so therefore you Adam
[44:26] Adam
[44:27] there was only Eve that came out of Adam
[44:30] and that's the way he is ds2 or one that
[44:37] lets go beyond all of our faults all of
[44:40] our disappointments everything that we
[44:42] ever have done and God's grace and mercy
[44:46] stands with us
[44:48] hallelujah and in all of this God saves
[44:53] you why it wasn't your good deed it was
[45:02] what he thought of you from the
[45:04] beginning God didn't go shopping in a
[45:08] hobby to get you he with within himself
[45:12] you were in him you understand me
[45:18] I brother I wasn't you were in him you
[45:21] you weren't part of his leg you were
[45:25] there in the heart he went in the heart
[45:28] to get you you are god's heartbeat huh
[45:34] he could have gotten you up from up here
[45:37] but he didn't want you from up here cuz
[45:39] he was going to give you that anyway is
[45:41] that right the Bible said now we have
[45:43] the mind of Christ but the mind of
[45:46] Christ was never
[45:47] his head it was in his heart as the hard
[45:50] thinking she that's where the devil
[45:55] thought he was that's what a devil start
[45:58] was in his head
[46:00] hallelujah that's why he was able to get
[46:03] lifted up but in the heart is where the
[46:07] soul is that's the real you
[46:16] and when God marries you the wedding
[46:19] takes place in your heart not in your
[46:23] head you become one with God in your
[46:28] heart that's why that's why that's why I
[46:31] David I'm fitting clothes David said I'm
[46:34] not finished with this thought because
[46:36] this is so much more I wanted to say but
[46:39] David said as the heart panted for the
[46:42] water Brooke you know my soul thirsts
[46:46] for the Living God hallelujah and your
[46:50] soul is not in your head your soul
[46:53] occupies your heart hallelujah until a
[46:58] man thirst after God from the heart he
[47:01] won't get no way you're here to quit on
[47:04] you it will faint on you but when the
[47:07] heart thirst for something y'all know
[47:09] what I'm saying
[47:10] come on somebody you and I realize most
[47:13] of us know what it's like when we were
[47:15] sinners and we had evil things in our
[47:17] heart that we thirst for we would not
[47:20] stop - we would get it
[47:23] hello under what cost
[47:26] any calls y'all right like I don't know
[47:29] what I'm talking about but that kind of
[47:33] a thirst will blind you to reality all
[47:37] you can see is what you won't if we
[47:41] could just let God take that perverted
[47:43] way and change it around to everything
[47:46] that we want is God oh you'll be all
[47:49] right will help us Jesus help us Lord it
[47:56] is okay listen we have an assurance
[48:01] the Bible says are called the
[48:03] revelations 13 and all that dwell upon
[48:05] the earth shall worship Him whose names
[48:07] are not written in the book of life of
[48:09] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[48:12] the world hmm so your name in my name
[48:16] was written in the book not just a book
[48:20] of life
[48:21] the Lamb's Book whoo the one that's
[48:26] covered by the blood huh
[48:28] the Lambs look like where God has given
[48:31] you his life and you have become a lamb
[48:36] man you know it's like this when you
[48:39] read about the Three Little Pigs you
[48:40] know you're gonna be reading about pigs
[48:42] a fox maybe in there every now and again
[48:46] but the main thought would be pigs and
[48:50] when it comes to the Lamb's Book of Life
[48:52] the main thought are Lambs ain't no
[48:55] goats in there he loved the Lord and we
[49:00] appreciate God I want you to under this
[49:05] these thoughts have cut me has a awaken
[49:08] me and kept me up for three nights three
[49:10] days in a row and I still can't get it
[49:12] like I saw it I can't seem to express it
[49:15] but I see God in a way that I've never
[49:18] seen him before you know I see God
[49:23] greater than the flesh of Jesus because
[49:30] Jesus the flesh had to rest
[49:34] y'all understand me
[49:35] so if you can see that then you can
[49:37] understand what God is trying to pour
[49:39] into you and I all that was in God he
[49:42] poured it into Christ all that was in
[49:44] Christ he's poured it into his church if
[49:45] we could see everything that means that
[49:48] I can't stay here there's a change going
[49:51] on in me I don't know what I'm changing
[49:53] into but I know at the end of the day
[49:56] I'll be just like him and I'm not gonna
[50:00] stop this change if I gotta be
[50:02] excommunicated
[50:04] eisah rejected you can look at me like
[50:10] I'm crazy losing my mind but I know what
[50:14] happen
[50:14] on the inside and this inside has a
[50:18] purpose God has a purpose for my life
[50:20] just like it has a purpose for yours
[50:23] don't stop it doesn't care doesn't
[50:26] matter if you're young or old God still
[50:29] using people he's still if he could just
[50:32] get one man or one woman in his hand
[50:33] guess what God can do exploits but most
[50:37] of the thing thing that I want more than
[50:39] anything it ain't all the signs and
[50:41] wonders let me be the one let me be the
[50:45] sign as they say let me be the billboard
[50:48] for Jesus Christ you love the Lord
[50:51] people I'm not crazy but I look all
[50:54] around and Christian oh I see every
[50:56] organization you know this and that I
[50:59] see the apostasy I've seen the way
[51:01] people have turned down Jesus and going
[51:03] everywhere every way but their own going
[51:06] in and in right in their own eyes but
[51:09] God said he never left himself without a
[51:11] witness hello
[51:14] he never left himself without a witness
[51:17] and I'm gonna tell you like this
[51:19] in closing before we go into communion
[51:21] it's a press this is not an easy way if
[51:25] you can imagine how difficult it must
[51:28] have been for your Lord and Savior to
[51:31] climb the hill of Gaga then you may have
[51:35] an ounce of understanding of what it is
[51:39] to press through this age understand
[51:42] this age has no light in it except for
[51:46] what the bride of Jesus Christ has have
[51:49] excuse me yeah see she's the only one
[51:53] and that life must shine it must reflect
[51:57] Christ hello
[51:59] remember the darkness is Egypt was so
[52:02] dark it could be felt and that's exactly
[52:07] where we are
[52:08] we're in an age where the darkness is so
[52:11] dark we could feel it less tan
[52:18] hallelujah lower that God I'll tell you
[52:25] what if I had up some musicians here
[52:27] I'll tell them to play me some dancing
[52:28] music I really can't help I tell you
[52:42] what where everybody else want to get to
[52:44] our formal coldly starchy I'm like I'm
[52:47] fired up

[53:03] surely grateful and thankful of it you
[53:06] love the Lord as we prepare when it
[53:10] comes sing
[53:20] with serving communion since for the
[53:23] toys here

[53:56] day
[54:01] [Music]
[54:14] let's go buddy
[54:21] [Music]
[54:28] and response prompted a
[54:36] that same spirit has raised funds from

[54:56] dwells in you oh it will quicken your
[55:01] mortal body if that spirit
[55:06] it well genius
[55:09] Oh whoo you gotta let go and let God
[55:16] people you can't win the battle without
[55:19] prayer and prayer is not Lord give me
[55:23] that give me this prayer it's fellowship
[55:30] prayer is it's the greatest communion
[55:33] you can have with God we call this
[55:35] communion but this is just a minute type
[55:39] the real communion is when you get down
[55:42] on your knees and you talk to Jesus
[55:44] that's fellowship did you know that's
[55:46] why he died that's why this blood of
[55:49] Jesus Christ was shared for you and I
[55:51] for fellowship that's why the devil
[55:54] makes you tired makes you sick
[55:57] or causes something to distract you from
[56:00] prayer or fellowshipping think about it
[56:04] every time you think I'm gonna think
[56:06] about Jesus the phone rings something
[56:09] happens some child comes through the
[56:11] door
[56:12] something happens it's as if the devil
[56:15] no here your time when you're gonna do
[56:17] it sometime you like the prophet of God
[56:19] said when you're getting ready to pray
[56:20] don't say tell the kid I'm going to pray
[56:22] just go pray you get a jump on him as
[56:27] soon as you tell them what you're
[56:28] getting ready to do the devil sends his
[56:31] devils right the first things he come to
[56:34] your mind you know you are you joking
[56:38] but all that you've done today the way
[56:40] you've thought you know what I'm saying
[56:43] you you guilted this and you you think
[56:45] God gonna hear you hello yes not only
[56:51] that he's heard me before I asked him is
[56:54] that right the Bible said before you
[56:56] open your mouth to ask God has already
[56:58] heard he knows exactly what you're gonna
[57:01] pray and you know what sometimes when I
[57:03] get down and I don't I feel like no I
[57:05] don't even know what to pray for I say
[57:07] pray for me Lord is that Alright
[57:12] the Bible said when you don't know what
[57:14] to pray the Spirit of the Lord would
[57:15] then intercede for you I believe that
[57:23] I'll tell you what they say I like the
[57:26] about problems God said if I'm crazy
[57:28] just leave me like this I feel so much
[57:30] better this way my favorite place to go
[57:35] was to church it really is whether I'm
[57:38] preaching or whether I'm not it is the
[57:41] favorite my favorite place to be around
[57:43] the saints of God and to feel that
[57:44] presence you love the Lord 1st
[57:47] corinthians the 11th chapter would begin
[57:53] reading at the 23rd verse well I have
[58:04] received of the Lord that which also I
[58:06] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[58:08] the same night in which he was betrayed
[58:11] took bread and we and he had given
[58:14] thanks he brake it and said take eat
[58:16] this is my body which is broken for you
[58:19] this do and remembers of me after the
[58:23] same manner also he took the cup when he
[58:26] had supped saying this cup is the New
[58:28] Testament in my blood this do ye as oft
[58:33] as she drinking and remembrance of me
[58:35] for as often as you eat this bread and
[58:37] drink this cup you do show the Lord's
[58:39] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[58:42] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[58:44] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[58:46] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[58:49] let a man examine himself and so let him
[58:51] eat of that bread and drink of that Cup
[58:53] for he that eateth and drinketh
[58:55] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[58:57] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[59:00] body but this cause many are weak and
[59:03] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[59:06] we would judge ourselves we should not
[59:09] be judged but when we are judged we are
[59:12] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[59:14] be condemned with the Lord wherefore my
[59:18] brethren when you come together to eat
[59:20] tarry one for another If any man hunger
[59:24] let him eat at home that you come not
[59:27] together unto condemnation and the rest
[59:30] will I set in order when I come
[59:37] those of you are who are participating
[59:40] they come up
[1:00:07] let us pray father God as we come before
[1:00:11] you lord we break this bread in your
[1:00:14] honor we thank you for being so good to
[1:00:18] us Lord this bread is a representation
[1:00:23] of the body broken for our sins rules
[1:00:27] Lord for our iniquities and Lord this
[1:00:30] bought bread also is a portion of you
[1:00:36] Lord in symbol form to show us that we
[1:00:39] are all part of you as we partake of
[1:00:41] this bless all the participants Lord in
[1:00:45] your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
