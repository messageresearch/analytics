========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's way too yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] even nothing I've done it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] but [Music] me happy hi this prayer please Oh again Hey man just that word Reedy is such a powerful word we're going to get right into the Word of God we appreciate our musicians we appreciate everybody being here tonight West that you would turn with us to second Thessalonians two we started on preparing for in the world we haven't finished that thought we just kind of want to give a little more thought to that and I trust by God's grace that he would bless us tonight that we'll see basically how blessed we are second Thessalonians please appreciate our Lord Jesus Christ for being so faithful to us second Thessalonians a second chapter we'll begin reading at the first verse finally brethren sorry no chapter now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto Him that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that that day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin is be revealed the son of perdition let us pray father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us and we've been to ourselves we pray on tonight that your perfect will be done break and destroy the yokes of the enemy God we realize we are living in the last days and Father we see your coming as our prophet would say we see the dust in the distance and father we standing there Lord in the door waiting and ready because you promised us Lord and though others may not be able to understand our position in you father we know because you spoke to our hearts you called us individually and father we said yes to your proposal and the Lord we thank your father because we know that you are God that keeps all of his promises blessed law tonight in a special way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as we started our thought by God's grace we started it with the the very thought in fact that we're living in a day that has been prophesied to come when this prophecy has been moving some four thousand maybe six thousand years but no matter how long it takes for it to come to pass we realized that God will always vindicate his word we're living in what we would call a world of death brother Branham said that the moment a child takes his breath in this world he begins to die and we are in ourselves physically dying but the thing is we die to live this is just not the only stopping place but there's another world and we are headed toward that world the gospel came to prepare us for that world that's why Jesus Christ told Nicodemus you must be born again he said that which is a flesh is flesh and that which is of spirit is spirit don't marvel at this new doctrine you must be born again and I fear that in our community there are so many people who are not preparing the people what good will it do you if you learn all the religious acts all of the doctrines and do everything right and miss heaven we have understood that there was a rich young ruler he came to Jesus and said good master how can i inherit heaven and brother branham said he asked in a way because he had been so used to rules laws and regulations and he was good at it because every question that Jesus asked this man he said I've done these things in other words he was a perfectionist I've done this even from my youth and the Bible says that Jesus loved him the saddest part about that is that when Jesus came to ask him to give up the thing that was most valuable to him he was not willing to give it up you see God is a discerner of the heart no matter how we appear to be on the outside God see every dark spot and that's one thing about the Word of God it goes and it penetrates and it separates the spirit the soul the joint the marrow and it goes right down to where something could be hiding ha ha he's a secret agent man you know he knows how to investigate he knows how to look in places nobody else can see and he can find the very problem see that's that's why that's why the preaching of the gospel is so important because the preaching of the gospel will we'll find you out even when you think you hiding God pulls the cover off the saddest thing is that a lot of times the people don't want to surrender even when God exposes them it grieves me to know that it's so difficult to see people in a state of repentance now crying is can be the beginning but because people shared tears doesn't mean that they are repenting I have seen so many times even even people just really booing but they're crying because they're like a child please don't take my candy from me don't take my toy away and see God knows that and so he knows that he can't give them what he desired to give them until they're ready to surrender we're preparing for a new world that rich young ruler wasn't able to give it up and he continued his like guess what and God continued to bless him one thing about the laws of God you don't have to be a Christian in order for those laws to be effective you can be a sinner and yet believe the word and the word will work on your behalf because it is a law and we find out because he didn't give it up we find him on the next side of the pages ready to retire have been blessed by God barns are full and I'm not gonna spend much more time on this but he he forgot he forgot that God had dealt with him before he wanted eternal life and he forgot he passed it by see this life life is temporal remember God even gave this rich young ruler a second chance he put Lazarus right by his steps hallelujah if he had only blessed Lazarus he would have inherit eternal life if you give the released of these a drink of water in my name see there's a reward and we find out that Lazarus the rich young ruler was so blind to his success he paid no attention to God's grace and it was Lazarus who the rich young ruler saw in the bosom of Abraham after he died and where was he see his religion didn't prepare him his religion owner prepared him how to live in the way of how to live in this life million Christians so-called ah you can't put a thing on their life and they've done everything right but they haven't been born again that's the criteria you must be born again flesh and blood cannot inter well always somebody help me here but there was another rich young ruler his name was Moses and the whole time his mom tried to tell him you're going to be a deliverer and Moses liked the idea of being a slaves son because the Bible tells us that Moses resists the idea of being the son of Pharaoh's daughter watch this now because his eyes was focused ejup every Kingdom every Kingdom and I'm telling myself it's got to fall there's only one kingdom that cannot fall and will not solve and that is the kingdom of God and the problems that the kingdom of God cannot ensure not ever be moved and what is the kingdom of God joy peace righteousness in the Holy Ghost hmm hallelujah see people if they just understood everything is a preparation things God could just snap it into being just like that but if you see by God's way of doing things in the book of Genesis you'll see that God moved at his own pace he could have said let there be and everything could just pop pop pop pop pop but it didn't work that way God moved in his own pace cuz garden is not of God of anxiety he's not he's never ancient hallelujah those are not attributes of God God is soul if I could put it this way laid out or laid back time is in his hands he's not in the hands of time he regulates everything so he he does it when he wants to even though it may seem like he's late to us God is always on time so anyway the Lord said I go to prepare a place for you the where I am there you may be also and he's talking to his disciples and it's been how many years thousands of years now over 2,000 years he told him I'm going to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also and according to the scripture of thousand years as one day so two days ago God has built a city in two days and he says I'm going to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also now understand in the future home where the rhythm tells us how God prepares the place hallelujah it must be justified it had to be sanctified it had to come to a place is that right because remember when Adam failed everything failed hallelujah the heavens and the earth fail we always look at the earth but understand heaven fell - that's why he's got to renew everything there's more than one heaven you know but I'm talking about the heaven that Adam was controlling you know that Adam control the atmosphere he controlled everything hallelujah in and everything that affected the earth Adam controlled it but the fall he lost it hallelujah let's go on so we must understand there was a preparation justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and understand the New Jerusalem was so homey it could not come down until this earth had received its fire baptism hello Jesus can't even touch the earth until this earth has received its fire baptism hallelujah therefore Jesus can't come in and dwell is king in your heart until it receives its fire baptism hello and there are so many people who don't who don't who don't want to go there but in order to see Jesus face in peace you got to go there as I said we are living in a world of death everything's death everything in order to live everything has to die some got a diet for you to live right corn wheat whatever it is beat it doesn't matter it has to die showing it is just evidence of what the world was it's a truth that we must see that God is life hallelujah and so we were born into this world we were born into what's in there I've said it a mother we were conceived in iniquity you understand me and in seeing our mothers can shaken iniquity excuse me and then seeing our mothers concede us is that right so because of what he did I'm coming to this because of what she did and Adam don't get me wrong she became the mother of death come on man born of a woman what he does what died but first you got to remember when God gave Adam and Eve her name weren't Eden it was Adam one body and two in one male and female and God to Adam Adam be fruitful and multiply and Adam at the spoken word heat and I'm going over this because remember I told you last the other service he had the spoken word and God gave him the Commission to reproduce and the second Adam wasn't even there but you gotta understand before we can ever be raptured we needed a man that consists of male and female he was the second but the first Adam was natural and he failed naturally the second Adam is what the Lord Himself a quickening spirit at what is Easter over Darla is that right he's Elohim and at the same time he's El Shaddai the breasted one hallelujah so that we can understand Adam was to speak and the children was to be formed out of the dust of the earth but they were not to be babies there'll be no babies in heaven there be no babies in the new world hallelujah the first Adam he meant was to bring them forth like God brought forth come on somebody he can't you get it but the brown said when God created the first Adam he created him spiritually and he create all of his children do you think God are creating the orphanage now or do you think they were there before and Adams job was to call for them and they will be fall from the dust of the earth just like the first Adam I'm going to prove I'm going to prove that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he cannot change so I was showing you by God's grace how are we preparing for this new world who feel like shall in the god this is why when the sons of God died in this body they can't die in the theophany so when they die they go back to the theophany body that the oppening body was hindered because of the fall when the bottom said when seeing came in we bypass our theophany and we came into this world to suffer death and all the fruits that comes with death hallelujah but God's Word could not come back void so that's why he said I have never loved lost one why because the theophany cannot be lost hallelujah he said when you hear this message you have what her from your theophany that means you've existed you were there Paul saw he is and he said though this earthly telling us to be dissolved I have what I have a building waiting for me so all of these all of the seeds yearns of God when they died at the beginning they died they died they died look like they were in the grave and just like can they ever come back will they ever come back I see everything come back but will these this man come back Joe didn't understand but there's a call it is hard to see what would happen to a man when we've died and God sent him through it and only has she as I said on the as she with all the sacrifices he was making all the bird sacrifices it was there God show Joel the resurrection the man died yet shall he live come on somebody in stir truth prove it on Mount Transfiguration there was Moses and Elijah who had been dead for hundreds of years in this dimension but over there even the Witch of Endor when she wanted to talk to Samuel saw had to call him up and there was Samuel in its prophetic robe hallelujah showing that there was another world another world hallelujah in everybody that was a part of that other world amen somehow in their day in their generation called the revelation of the blood they knew in order to get back over cross this chasm I needed somebody to stand in my place and all they had was Lambs but one day the real am the real Lamb of God I'm coming the real Lamb of God came and to show and to prove he was a real lamb when he died on the cross and said it was finished the Bible said he descended into the lower regions and he started with the days of Noah hallelujah come on somebody and he preached the gospel and his question was why did not you believe Noah Noah snow was very shocked was a type of Christ there was only one door one way I don't care how many religions they were in that world there was only one way in order to be saved you had to believe Noah's gospel and there was only one door God didn't have no back door if you got in the ark you had to come in the front door hallelujah if you got any off all the people around you had to see you go in y'all understand me is like that kids when you're baptized you're not supposed to do it in a secret it ought to be a witness day hey somebody help me here and when Jesus went down into paradise he said boys I know you waited you died in faith how do you know he said that because Hebrew says it they all died in faith not having received the promise but they knew the promise was still there hallelujah so the promise sir came down and knocked on the door hallelujah and said boys it's time to get up out of here by the blood of Jesus has already been shed I got a better place for you so paradise was done away with did you know that it was done away with because the sinner and the saint could see each other hallelujah that doesn't it hey bruh ham I mean the rich young ruler could see see our Lazarus and Lazarus could see and God said no no no no we got to do something we're going to do a better thing we're gonna set it so you'll never see this why hallelujah heaven must be heaven and hell must be hell and when the true blood of Jesus Christ came it's separated it say what are you talking about further words let me let me put it this way so what happened we preparing now but understand this ain't that this ain't this ain't the final place hallelujah is that right what the souls under the altar in the Book of Revelations is crying out Lord how long how long will you avenge us of our adversaries hello some honey amen brother Brown said even in you'll be opening he said you can you can't eat neither do you sleep while you say that brother Brooks because you don't breathe the breath of life was only given in this dimension see God don't breathe only when he's feeling you he blows because breath is time they don't know that time and once that stop your time is over hallelujah also you and I must understand they're in the theophany you don't have to worry about getting tired you and I get tired because we give out of oxygen not there God is your life and when you and I come to a place you and I must understand that they're there but they say law I enjoy eating yeah come on somebody you know God enjoy eating that was one of the first thing he taught Adam and Eve I want you to know there's a great pleasure in this thing eating Oh what happened when Abraham and conquered the first thing he did was have a feast every victory he said leave me some lame out there make when we conquer and overcome this world what we do we go sit at the Welcome Table and we eat look in the Book of Revelations you'll find out that there are fruits that would be eaten when Jesus rose from the dead in his glorified body he said go give me some fish and bread see that's why Christians like the eat see it's something about that oh let me move on my god grace there's a better place and God is preparing us for it don't miss it people don't miss it because every Kingdom you see here must fall that right how it was it has always been even in denny's that I saw stone hewn out of the mountain and that throw was riding rolling down to Babylon what was it doing crushing every kingdom I'm telling you this headstone kingdom will crush every kingdom who this is the kingdom of Jesus Christ this is the one he's building hallelujah is that right he's building that's why he's working on you let go and let God like job said if I perish I'm sorry like Esther said if I perish let me perish I'm going to see the king and job said though he slay me yeah I'll trust him why we are not of this world hallelujah that's what Jesus was trying to tell us we are not of this world we are of a different civilization come on somebody he made us priests and kings why because in the beginning we were priests in Kings just giving a message every Kingdom has to give way but the man who says in God's provided place of worship he said the woman Eve was the tree of death we all taste of her being born in this world and as sure as we're born of a woman will gut we've got to die and as sure as we're born of the man Jesus Christ will live forever see that's what I was getting o folk getting to to you because when God brought the birth of the church it was by a man hello woman had nothing to do with it it was by a man you're pulling again by who Christ Jesus hallelujah when they pierced him in the side it was at that point water and blood came out it was at that time when everything had been basically conquered she came forth but she had to suffer everything he suffered in order to overcome so don't tell me you can't overcome because if you were in him you've already done it you did it when he did it honey oh come on somebody see what we must understand is that the devil as long as he can get you to believe you don't have the Holy Ghost he's got you lit Wow it's a Pentecostal theology thing that you got you got a jerk you got a jump you got a shout all people of God you don't have to do none of that what you have to do is live the life of Christ all of that is good I like it but that is not a criteria hallelujah come on somebody you must realize that even in a day and then when Moses brought the children of Israel out of Egypt who was out there playing that Camry even playing the tambourine don't guarantee you Miriam was out there shouting dancing Moses saying a brand new song they had a glorious time and I don't even know the percentage they were Devils because that generation did not make it except for to the understand what I'm saying so that you can understand when God told Adam to replenish the earth when God told Adam to replenish the earth who did it the Serpent's that's why he could kill them all with God told Joshua and all of him go ahead and kill everything what was he saying they're not mine and they've been set here to keep you from the promise every ight well as Jimmy's ice here types whatever the ice are they are there stationed as warriors to stop you from making it to the promised land oh come on somebody you wonder how come you end up in places you don't know why you're there and so somehow some habit catches you it was stationed there it was waiting on you hallelujah but Paul said we are more than overcometh we're more than conquerors but gods facing things there in your life for you to battle but he's expecting you to overcome it halle-loo is that right oh he told the children of israil he said listen all in the promised land Oh milk and honey you tell him all the good stuff hallelujah it's like when you get mad you see all the good stuff you'll see all the bad stuff oh but it's there hallelujah but the truth of the matter is he didn't tell him there were giants over there and he got over there they got over there you know the spies the ten spies well how many was two came back and says are we more than able to take it and ten of the smile says but we can't see your confession when you confess stuff like that you don't believe God is God ain't no such thing I can't hallelujah y'all understand me Josh win Kayla when they say week is more than conquerors you know they weren't saying oh boy I don't went to school and I've got all my muscles struck you know I didn't know they understood that their God was God hallelujah and if God sent us here to defeat them we shall and will defeat them what was these giants compared to Egypt who he was the greatest force ever hallelujah greater than Russia hallelujah and God sent down one man invasion hallelujah that's what I'm trying to say God use one man so you can see God all he means is you is this okay so let me hurry up cause a lot of time people don't understand where I'm working with because we are there and yet we're here is that right jesus said if I said that the Son of Man was in heaven and on earth who understands that huh he's there but he's here here right the Bible said we're now sitting in heavenly places yeah I'll believe that we are now sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus now but you stand you sit here though you've got a representation there and it's York the Alpha me come on somebody doublet is that right it is your angel you're the operator and stand before the Lord day and night watching the moves of the devil hallelujah and when you get in trouble or when something comes that the opposite comes down says watch it the devil has a plan for you hmm telling you what the devil's plans are you can ignore him all you want to but everybody brother em say they be their people he said when they go to hell he said it'll be their very soul that will torment them because it's so know the truth hey let's move on you love the Lord so let me prove this point so I can go ahead on by God's grace you know what so what happens is when it goes to prepare place for you all right he's got all these people now all right he's got he's got the first resident the resurrection of the Old Testament Saints over there right remember they entered the gate hey who is this King of glory y'all know y'all know the story they all there and brother Balaam said when they came back to the earth they picked up their glorified bodies watch it read it that's what he said but those same glorified were able to walk through the wall and disappear somebody help me here see you soon what what do you mean Brotherhood all I can tell you is what he said but I'm gonna tell you something else amen though they've got dads we've got to get ours and guess what no flashing blood into it in that glorified body they did not have any blood other than the blood of Jesus that's why you need a blood transfusion you got to have the blood of Jesus to get in the door oh come on somebody just like I said just the other day I said when when when when God called Lazarus by one name one name for the man said if he had called anything ever he's just said would have said come forth he said the whole graveyard would have woke up hallelujah but think about it God ain't gonna say I know think about how many ideas that saved he's gonna call one name and he'll call his name oh come on somebody that's what he'll call because you got to realize when God call Adam Adam he didn't say Adam Adam he said Adam and they both turn oh god help me the whole heaven dog is named after him so when the resurrection is called here called his name my life is here we're in Christ hey there's their salvation in any other but there's no other name under heaven given by what we must be saved but the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah come on somebody we're back is that right we're burying the name of who Jesus Christ because it is the only place of worship hey somebody it ain't Baptist Methodist Catholic whatever it is it is the name of Jesus Christ and anybody who trusts in any other name you received the mark of the beast come on somebody remember the Lambs never had a name it was no name they were just Lambs but God gained this lamb thou shalt call his name Jesus and he shall save his people from their sins hey I lost somebody see people think I'm crazy no sir when Peter think about it God used a man called Peter who had the hardest temper of all the disciples ready to fight every time you look around he's he's in trouble and God told Peter he said before the crow three times Peter you will deny me all the horn no I would not I would die for you and all of us have that testimony but until you get the Holy Ghost you have failed just like Peter you can't stand up to this world and the pressure those demons without the Holy Ghost you need the Holy Ghost people need the Holy Ghost I don't care what these message people have done to it forgive me they have intellectualize this message to a place that people don't take they can't even live it is that right you talk about backslidden Jesus Christ has got their first law hello you can't even get him to worship you can't get him to come to church you can't get him to tithe you can't get him to pray up and you can't get them to do nothing I'm type of message believers and they think I'm crazy I know I've been sent by God and I don't say that that's I'm saying humbly as I can it doesn't matter that's the thing people don't recognize God they got their purpose they got their people they got their I didn't hear them to be classy I just come to preach the word hallelujah the Bible said therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new clear Chah hello all the old things are passed away we see people struggling still with all things well how can all things be there if Jesus Christ has made you new Allah we need some newness behold all things have become new the word is right let this way be right let this word be right now understand me I'm talking about desires now all your worldly desires must go temptations will come because of the flesh don't get me wrong this man will never be obedient this is hybrid this is your part of your Beast it is the truth this is what the fall brought but every desire in your heart should be toward God hello somebody it doesn't mean that the devil ain't gonna come and try to tempt you and make you fall over every case maybe and brother man say you will but one thing about a true believer he gets up but just man may fall seven times in a day but he get up and keep going there's something about it brother he can't stay down he can't even give up when he wants to give up there's something keep holding me hallelujah I'm not holding myself he's holding me nothing nothing brother I'm saying like the Word of God says like this according to Galatians 6:15 for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature so your church stood traditions don't mean nothing you got to do this you got to do that you got to do it that means nothing you must be born again you got to become a new creature in Christ hallelujah is that right the blood of Jesus Christ takes away the guilt consciousness hallelujah whoo help me Jesus like I saw like I told you the Bible tells us for there are certain men that crept in unawares and you got to understand hey man these preachers and I did people who give me the right he does these preachers creep on into the message come on somebody and because people say oh they can give me some deeper revelation with that's exactly what the serpent did to eat he gave her some deep revelation hello and because of it look where we are now God had made it so simple don't do this don't eat up this tree don't do it how complicated can that get but when you allow the devil to come in and just get in you what let me ask you something is Paul a prophet was Paul the prophet and Paul says you can understand all mysteries you can move mountains you can give all that you have to feed the poor and you have not charity you don't have a covenant with God it profits you nothing without dividing up you can forget it and what is divine love the Holy Ghost in you somebody help me here what do you say I'm telling people that we're wasting our time and that was the enemy's purpose he said he said Nathan and Cora among us he had the people who worship II he had to keep the a they were toughening what but the prophecy and listen they forgot where they were headed none of the characters changed hello and according to Deuteronomy God says I brought you in the wilderness to try you to test you so that you could see what was in your heart hmm all your tests and trials are calm is come to - what test you to see what's in your heart hallelujah when you find yourself murmuring and complaining that's not what God want to hear and all things give that hallelujah whether you understand it or not the Bible said all things work together come on somebody when you go through a trial don't you know it had to be God that the devil had to get permission he can't just do with you what he wants to he's got to ask cuz it go ahead on but I know they'll never deny me hallelujah no matter what you see them through their spear stay y'all understand me oh let me hurry up here see you must understand you got to tell the dealer this you got to say listen devil I didn't choose God he chose me and God doesn't make a mistake don't look at me like I'm a mistake don't you look at yourself like you some mistake God chose you there are many people who would love to see this and they can't see it but God is giving you grace to see it I'm not against all message people preachers or anything I'm not against any of them but I tell you what if they're not telling the people how they need to prepare themselves and what we're doing we're preparing the people how to live here what that got to do with their always it's about the parish is that right frustration said these denominating this what he said these denominational preachers he said they're building these big churches and claiming Jesus is soon to come what's he saying then it can't be in the will of God oh I get in trouble for that one but my question is this how many in their churches have the really the real true Holy Ghost because I'm gonna tell you something soon as you build fancy churches you know what happens you start compromising oh come on people gotta pay the bill you ain't gonna hit too hard like you're used to I know what I'm talking about y'all are gonna be like I don't know what I'm saying I've been around a long time I've seen things change whoo oh yeah I'm going on out that any part of my message but I just threw it in there I understand and I'm almost done with this portion because God is gathering and what people don't understand he's not gathering like we think he's gathering we're not a nation as such he gathered Israel by nation but when it came to Gentiles he called them one by one huh somebody when he when he with the Cherico when they went down to Jericho gray one because we have one at her house to be saved a little more was added when it came to the knees one because camellias amen one of this family say more at it you understand me he didn't goes at all I'm going to gather all God don't have respect of nobody's nation there's only one nation one people that God is interested in and and that is his own am I making sense God don't care by the way you'll color yo yo yo yo yo your profession God don't get nothing about that he's looking at one thing the seed God is looking for the seed he's looking for him is that right that great eagle has spread her wings and she's looking for home that's all she's looking for the seed that the egg of the child that she knows is out there and she's making cries right now searching for hers and guess what she don't care what barnyard you in she gonna find hmm is that right listen brother man says and that the law listen this covenant was not on not on condition but was unconditional Lee is that right so God had to make a covenant with his people and you know what that does it it throws the pride out the door mm-hmm hello you ain't nothin every gift God get you got God gave it to you you didn't earn it it was given to you before come on somebody in other words brothers y'all didn't just become piano players you were there before that way in heaven you know how to play it that's why you can play now that's why I was always a deep call for it I just singing that was given to me before I got here God knew how I was going to sound and everything come on about it and guess what God put in you a liking oh come on somebody she had all words together these gifts work together it's all to edify the Bride of Christ so what happened now we understand why God has to do a recreation you got to be recreated you can't enter in to heaven this way no unclean thing is going to enter in hmm everything has to be your new you got to be justified sanctified you have to receive the baptism the Holy Ghost and brother Branham brought us to the fourth step you gotta that baptism of the Holy Ghost makes room for Christ himself is that right it's got to be it must happen and guess what I love the fact that I ain't got nothing to do with it y'all don't like me to say it that way I have nothing to do with it it's all in God's hands whoo listen this what the property God said the great Greek word says new creation it's a new creation you have been recreated again from what you were to the image of the son of God and a daughter of God it's just such see it's the greatest miracle that ever happened when a sinner can be made to become a Christian hallelujah so you say what I mean that's why the problem God said when you born again he said that is just the beginning you've got the crime and rise higher y'all understand this without divine love they without us cannot be made perfect the pyramid is not complete without us hmm so you must understand you're pressing towards something when love is tested can I say like this almost done when love is tested do you know that you're gonna have trial after trial after trial after trial Oh y'all don't want that but it's true try a lot to try that's why we get more trials seem like than any age ever and our greatest trials are in our mind we are living in an age of insanity and you're fighting to keep yours I know what I'm talking about sometimes I del you feel Oh Lord look the day you know they don't even want to let it come out your mouth right because you you up so in your mind you've got these battles going on the old man things people say to you things people do to you and Satan is right at you every day without prayer you defeated without prayer you open the door for demons oh come on somebody without the Holy Ghost you take off that soldier's ear you know Peter he was really angry aiming for the head right hey man God promised it the prophecies and gods obligated to Kate take care of it so y'all know that when Jesus comes and he calls him from the dust of the earth he will do exactly what the first Adam should have done and we we call from the dust of the earth we will all be filled we were all you know what causes right you let me say like this you know when when Cain killed Abel Abel did did you ever hear Abel talking he wouldn't die but there's no record of his voice but Abel died and the Bible said he's crying still he still speaks meaning that he's not dead he's somewhere like those Jews over there still speaking under the altar Lord how long hallelujah so those who are listening what was the difference Abel was of the blood of Adam and Cain was of the blood of the serpent so it was still life in the blood of Abel and because of that you understand when I say life in the blood because he Abel's blood he meant was was represented by the Lamb you die you did basically with this blood but we live because of the life of the blood of the Lamb scuse me right that's why the life was killed the by said he was slain before the foul he was slain before the foundation of the world don't look at me like I don't know what I'm talking about I know what I'm saying it was a lamb that was named before the foundation in the world that represented Abel's life that's why he could still speak though he was dead because the blood covered him the land ma your names were put in the last book of life before the foundation of the world that blood that lamb that book covers you throughout all your life but the thing that gets me is because people are stopping short they don't want to go all the way that's what what what happened with Pentecost they thought were praise the Lord I could speak in tongues I can shout like a dance that's it and that wasn't it see it was another stage to come that's what God had to say another car for with the light of the hour and the Bible said if you walk in the light as he is in the light right the blood of Jesus Christ will do what cleanse you from all your unrighteousness and then you will have fellowship one with another our fellowship is another natural fellowship our fellowship is around the Holy Spirit and around his word people oh lord help me Jesus so you he said listen go back to Thessalonians I'm almost done with this portion that ye be not soon shaken where in your mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of Christ is at hand don't be shaken in your mind you don't have listen at the end of the day when that squeeze come on you're not gonna have a building to go to anyway so where you go to worship God hmm you ought to be worshipped him every day is that right and let me tell you something people of God I don't know whether you're doing it or not but every day you need to take a bath in the word every day there should be a circumcision God cut it off stop before it come whatever the devil has sent for me give me the grace to stand you understand me what are we here for let me see you know we are here so that this light this world can see Jesus if you're not reflecting Jesus you failing God yeah say it again if you're not reflecting Jesus Christ in your life you are failing God and the purpose for which he has you here was that tough I hope it was tough enough because it's true we're here to reflect Jesus Christ he said ye are the lights of the world don't hide this candle on the bush be the city set up on the yield where all men can see hmm it's a horrible thing when people say well I didn't know they were that's terrible if you want to put yourself in the spot you shouldn't have to tell them but if you want to make sure you keep yourself in check you tell the person when you for I'm a Christian so they can watch you don't give them a little guess but why are you so nice no I'm a Christian right God's great secret just five more minutes please has always blinded the wisdom of the world they can't get it they just don't understand it Satan don't understand it none of the rest of them understand it but the just but just those who are predestinated to understand it how God and Christ are one they can't understand it I'm lead with this quote Israel in the church part two God told Abraham I have blessed you I have made you a father not i will i am i have made you and you'll come to me in an o age let me tell you something I'm not Jeremiah but I believe God did the same for me like he did Jeremiah God could say Isaiah I knew you before he was formed in your mother's womb I call you to be a preacher my I sanctified you come on son I see you got to understand even though God didn't personally come to tell you that he did through his prophet is that right he said I have justified you as though you've never sinned in the first place now you can't get no more sanctified than that I'm almost y'all keep pulling I'm almost done I have I have made you and you come to me in an old age he's talking to Abram and you're going to be saved and I've already done it and I already said so and you haven't got nothing to do with it it's unconditional God determined how to have his church so every time he's made a covenant with man and man breaks his covenant and he does yet today man will always break his covenant with god but God can't break his covenant with man so I will so what are you saying I'm telling you now you may not be where you want to be hmm you may not be where you want to be and you might feel like you the last one in the line but you ought to thank God you in the line you may not be in spirituals you want to be but let me tell you something God will never fail you it's unconditional no matter how many times we fail don't you worry if you ever grow corn or grow some kind of wheat or whatever out there there's those little ones that comes up look like they the like they in the last place and all you need is a good rain and overnight though Stingo see that's all you need is a good rain and god's gonna bring each and every one as to that perfection y'all believe that i don't know about you I thirst for righteousness and he said if you thirst for word you shall be filled I don't like doing wrong because I don't like doing be doing wrong that means that's good brother that means I can't be of the devil the devil enjoys his evil but when you enjoy Jesus or enjoy the righteousness God will make sure you continue to have it is that right that's just a grace of God you love the Lord blessed and he's gathering us every Holy Ghost filled believer and don't you think God ain't here to fill your cup David said Lord let it run over mmm yo we need some holy we need and I'm crying out for the Holy Ghost I'm crying out for a refreshing I'm crying out for revival in this church and I just hope by God's grace that you there you hear when he comes he's coming he didn't tell me when he's gonna show up but he's coming hallelujah like I said I can't miss it cuz I'm the preacher he's gonna show up and I just pray I pray I remember brother telling me the story it was more than his doors he was actually thinking about me and he and his company and his church have been fasting and praying Darwin feeling with the Holy Ghost cuz when I went there I saw all little children worshiping God and praising the Lord and you can see it wasn't a fake it was really I think same with all of them but I knew something young kids like that and I ask myself the world dr. Church like that brother books you know what happened he said it was so strange he said we were all in the book I dismissed he says so little people left out the other group brain vision and somehow God will be just don't lock the door but he didn't work role in a fear anymore so he went in locked the door and he said we need finish locking that last door the power party he said Brotherhood to this day I don't know how I got back to the pulpit he said but the Lord fell on everybody the young and the old he said they went the scream and they went the Harland he said the people who had already left turn back around what unless what unless I'll never forget that that's how we had that revival in in Lima he can't let her to us keep us all God wait 30 minutes power God struck like that so we went all the fans to get free and I can't remember how many days how many months it's God having service more often preaching faster reaching I remember the day we was okay we've done all we could do that was a Friday that Saturday Sun Saturday and God showed up we had dinner nights with never experienced only goes running up and down that how like a man all the day Leland is a people today it wasn't brother Brooks God came when we least expect but I'm gonna tell you something [Music] here coming ain't gonna give you what you desire until you really call them and thirst for him it's gotta be more than non-super it's gotta be something coming from the heart it's gotta be something where you say God I got you I don't know how to clean up I clean up the best I know how I would just want to be in a place where we ever get like that you'll see God do something and it no man can take it from God is deadly hallelujah I'm looking for it I was telling the people of God I said you know you see you preach hard nobody comes and I'm not begging nobody but I think I know that God loves our broken in contracts so hard so full of pride so full it's something I don't know you worry we worry about what other people think get all that nonsense out of my head the devil is there to come to make you think oh you don't look like I look I don't care people like me they don't like we are worship I don't it just doesn't matter because I come to worship Him this crisis by worship that's the only place to understand God is looking for those who worship Him [Music] let us pray father God we come before you lord lord [Music] what so that forgive me stumble I hope and trust good dropping off got that it was a man game collision too happy but don't count break1 the quickie in spirit perform the greatest operation that's all up there the father said water separated from the Lord we realized that that was the first operator they cook Jesus Christ being the first we knowing that is hitting everything must odd we have skilled like babe just like I told David then give us every time Lord we have been humble ourselves when he came out Lord the leprosy with urgency in all this I don't know how Lazarus looked but I think and I believe though he was dead we don't know Lord God what is all gonna be like but I do know that when we get over there and the rewards are being given out we'll be called by a name where the rattle said perhaps gonna be that lame that we had with you before the foundational work rather bellum gives an illustration and the only way that he could give the illustration he said he called way around he said I didn't even know that I had to go up before but whatever it abhi Lord we do realize we recognize because we know that father we thank your father to know that whatever that baby is it'll be a party let the life of Christ live in us Lord I want to redirect you every day every moment of the day I don't want nobody to have a misunderstanding [Music] bless you to die quench their thirst help these people yeah legendary the only thing they could watch and wash away my [Music] oh hey [Music] [Music] there are no babies over here see there's no sin there's no Miliband talks about us living on worlds and world in the world on top of worlds and moons and stars yeah headquarters will be Jerusalem that's where the ride would be stationed but don't get it mixed up Jesus is in heaven so understand I'm not confused about what's in the city and what's out of this weather we're gonna be here there it doesn't matter as long as we're there we'll get every father I have one desire and that is to be for my bride to be wherever I am wherever he is is where we'll be and understand this brother madam taught us one thing more than one but he says everything is that meant you heaven is right he just can't see it's moving faster faster dimension right so I state all of these things what like the brother God said whatever you do don't miss it don't beat us don't don't let the enemy discourage in a huge you ain't listen you ain't there why is he telling you this if you're not why is he telling you new you're not he's a liar it's his job say thank you sir he just told me that I am right Caesar doesn't bother with you stuff that doesn't matter you met that's why he comes to you every day that's thing that again is I saw me to come again wash [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Oh baby [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music]
