[36:14] you we were we were deep in
[36:18] sin and we we didn't have a way out and
[36:21] only God's grace provided way for us
[36:26] [Music]
[36:28] and we are grateful for
[36:30] it amen uh we'll just get straight to
[36:33] the
[36:36] word oh let's open our Bibles to First
[36:41] Peter chapter
[36:52] 5 verse
[36:56] 8 and
[36:59] I'm just going to continue the same uh
[37:02] top topic that uh I preached the first
[37:04] two times
[37:08] amen um it's called for we are not
[37:11] ignorant of his
[37:15] [Music]
[37:17] devices but but tonight I will take a
[37:20] different um angle and I will talk about
[37:23] the woman
[37:28] but before I say anything let's just
[37:30] read um 1 Peter
[37:34] 5:8 be sober be vigilant because your
[37:38] adversary the devil as a roaring lion
[37:41] walketh about seeking whom he may
[37:44] [Music]
[37:52] Dev notice the Bible doesn't say um be
[37:56] asleep but it says be
[38:00] sober and be
[38:02] vigilant so you have to be
[38:06] awake because when you are sleeping you
[38:09] don't know who your your enemy is and
[38:11] you
[38:14] don't and you don't know what he's
[38:16] planning or what he he wants to
[38:20] do and um if you notice also it says as
[38:23] a roaring lion
[38:28] I think there's a scripture that says um
[38:31] a a a lion has wrote who shall fear
[38:35] something like
[38:39] that because like a roaring Lon he
[38:43] brings that brings fear upon the
[38:47] people so that's how the devil always
[38:49] tries to operate always with
[38:53] fear so let's go to the next uh uh um
[38:57] scripture 2 Corinthians 2:
[39:02] 9-1 for this end also did I write that I
[39:06] I might know the proof of you whether
[39:08] you be obedient in all things to whom
[39:11] you forgive anything I forgive
[39:20] also to CH and verse 10 to whom you
[39:24] forgive anything I forgive also for if I
[39:26] forgive anything anything to whom I
[39:28] forgave it for your sakes forgave I it
[39:31] in the person of
[39:41] Christ let Satan should get an advantage
[39:44] for us or let Satan should get an
[39:46] advantage of us for we are not ignorant
[39:49] of his devices
[39:55] amen let's bow our head
[39:58] dear heavenly father Lord we thank you
[40:00] so much for your grace
[40:03] Lord and for your love towards us Lord
[40:06] Jes Lord we realize that we are nothing
[40:09] without you
[40:10] lord and we don't want to be anything
[40:13] without
[40:14] you lord we want you to be our all in
[40:17] all
[40:18] Lord and father Lord in this service we
[40:20] invite you
[40:22] Lord knowing with the full assurance
[40:24] that your Prophet said Lord that every
[40:26] time that you are invited you always
[40:28] show up to your
[40:34] appointment heavly father Lord um Heaven
[40:36] and Earth shall pass away but your word
[40:38] will never pass
[40:42] away and we put our faith on your word
[40:44] Lord
[40:46] Jesus therefore Lord I pray that you you
[40:49] speak to us Lord God tonight
[40:52] Lord I commit myself to you Lord and I
[40:55] Surrender myself to you Lord
[40:59] may you bless the service may you hear
[41:00] through the congregation Lord and may
[41:02] you be glorified in all things Lord
[41:06] Jesus because Lord I don't want to be
[41:09] glorified and I don't want anybody else
[41:10] to be glorified by you
[41:14] Lord because father Lord God the purpose
[41:17] of preaching is to get people to you
[41:19] Lord
[41:22] God but the only way to get people to
[41:24] you is to glorify you Lord
[41:28] because you said in your word father if
[41:29] I be lifted up I will draw all men unto
[41:35] me Lord I Surrender the service into
[41:37] your hand
[41:38] Lord I curse every Spirit that's not
[41:41] confessing your name I rebuke in the
[41:43] name of Jesus
[41:47] Christ in the name of Jesus
[41:50] Christ amen you may have your
[41:54] seats like I said this is going to be
[41:56] the third part of um the sermon that I
[41:59] preached before
[42:04] here I didn't plan to have a third part
[42:07] but um like every time I preach I never
[42:10] finish so that that's why I keep on
[42:13] adding those
[42:17] parts but by the grace of God I hope
[42:20] I'll say what needs to be said to be a
[42:23] blessing to you all
[42:28] all right so we're going to talk about
[42:30] the devices of the
[42:33] enemy previously we spoke about fear how
[42:35] the devil operates through
[42:40] fear and he also uses um he attacks the
[42:43] young
[42:47] people and we today we're going to talk
[42:50] about how the devil uses a woman as a
[42:52] weapon to attack the children of God
[43:00] the prophet said in this message why are
[43:02] people so tossed
[43:06] about he said and noticing them one of
[43:08] them was money uh women
[43:16] popularity and those three
[43:19] things I noticed in the scripture that
[43:21] where it money was the prophet B bam who
[43:25] sold out his gift
[43:35] account of
[43:37] money when BAC offered so much money
[43:40] many many of you are acquainted with the
[43:47] story and to Samson it was
[43:50] Thea the woman who wed him in her lap
[43:54] until he gave away the secrets of the
[43:56] Lord to her
[44:02] and Saul it was popularity he was a
[44:07] prophet so we understand that according
[44:10] to the prophet there are three things
[44:12] that the devil uses to get man of
[44:21] God popularity women and
[44:25] money do we all believe that that's we
[44:28] just read the prophet I like reading the
[44:29] prophet to show you to show you where
[44:32] I'm taking this
[44:35] from So today we're just going to focus
[44:37] on that one part the
[44:40] woman why am I focusing on that because
[44:43] the prophet says that if you want to see
[44:45] how spiritually churches look at the
[44:51] woman let let's read this quote um if
[44:54] you want to know where the church is
[44:56] standing watch the
[45:02] women watch the morals among the
[45:07] women because she's a representation of
[45:10] the
[45:11] church when you see the pollution among
[45:14] the women you find the pollution in the
[45:20] church if we want to know how spiritual
[45:22] the Church of Higher Ground is we just
[45:24] have to look at the woman in this church
[45:31] that's the word you know in this message
[45:33] the prophet says that um uh what she
[45:36] become a painted up Jezebel just exactly
[45:40] what the church has
[45:42] [Music]
[45:47] become if you want to know where the
[45:49] church is watch the morals among the
[45:52] women
[46:00] because she is the church the church is
[46:02] a
[46:04] woman you know the prophet even goes
[46:06] deeper and even talks about in a
[46:08] marriage between a man a husband and his
[46:11] wife you you you know how spiritual a a
[46:15] husband is by looking at his
[46:23] wife because the bride reflects the
[46:25] character of a man
[46:28] [Music]
[46:30] you know for instance you cannot be um
[46:33] um a holy ghost fi
[46:37] man but what attracts you is let's say
[46:41] for instance a wife wearing
[46:45] bikinis you know you may say that you
[46:48] are a Christian but your actions is
[46:50] proving that you're not a
[46:53] Christian the prophet says that she
[46:55] reflects she reflects what's in
[47:00] him so it's very like the woman plays a
[47:03] very important role in the
[47:08] church all right so
[47:11] um let's go
[47:16] to I don't know how I printed this
[47:20] but all right we'll just use it like
[47:23] that so uh let's go to proverb 7:
[47:29] 2 the Bible talks about this one this
[47:32] like you'll have to read the whole
[47:33] chapter I just took verse 25 and
[47:40] 26 to show you the power of an ungodly
[47:46] woman that's why even you as a Christian
[47:49] even filled with the Holy Ghost you
[47:50] still have to be careful with
[47:55] women because here in verse of 25 it
[47:58] says let not thy heart decline to her
[48:04] ways go not astray in her
[48:08] path for she has cast down many
[48:12] wounded yet many strong men have been
[48:15] slain by
[48:18] her her house is the way to
[48:21] Hell going down to the chambers of
[48:24] death you know so the Bible even talks
[48:27] about many strong
[48:30] men you no wonder the prophet say said
[48:33] don't don't try to see how close you can
[48:35] get from sin but try to see how far away
[48:37] you can stay from
[48:45] sin so this and and then if you read
[48:48] this chapter they're talking about a
[48:51] prostitute a woman of ill Fame like she
[48:55] she has brought down many strong
[48:59] men this is this is just me laying the
[49:03] foundation cuz I'll be talking more
[49:06] specifically on like um high
[49:10] heels high
[49:13] heels all right um so in the message
[49:16] marriage and
[49:21] divorce the prophet
[49:24] says um but in the human race it's the
[49:27] woman that's
[49:31] pretty not the
[49:33] man if he is there is something wrong
[49:39] amen paragraph
[49:41] 121 there there is crossed up seed
[49:46] somewhere originally it's that
[49:49] way why was it done to deceive
[49:55] by heard designer
[49:59] Satan is still working on her too in
[50:02] these last
[50:06] days so we understand that Satan was the
[50:08] original designer of the
[50:12] woman but he did not stop working on
[50:17] her even in these last days Satan is
[50:20] still working on the
[50:24] woman you know and and how is he working
[50:26] his is working through Hollywood
[50:27] Hollywood for
[50:31] instance a lot of a lot of Christians
[50:33] nowadays they they they or even just
[50:36] women in general we look at Hollywood as
[50:38] our
[50:42] example no we try to make Hollywood our
[50:46] standard whatever Hollywood calls Beauty
[50:49] that's why we we think is
[50:55] beauty instead of looking oursel in the
[50:57] filter of the word what does the word
[50:59] the Bible cause
[51:04] Beauty you know Psalm 139 says for I'm
[51:07] fearfully and wonderfully
[51:14] made marvelous are are thy
[51:18] works you know but people are no longer
[51:21] satisfied with the way God made
[51:24] them why because it's the influence of
[51:28] Satan he's still working on the
[51:32] woman the prophet says the beauty of the
[51:35] Lord is in Hol Holiness and
[51:42] power not in paint and powder and shorts
[51:45] and everything else that they're trying
[51:47] to wear and do
[51:53] it sister you claim to believe the
[51:55] message
[51:58] the message is telling you that beauty
[52:00] is not wearing paints or powder or
[52:02] makeups or shorts or anything like
[52:10] [Music]
[52:11] that it's in beauty of the Holiness and
[52:19] righteousness and then I'm not don't
[52:21] think I'm trying to go at you uh the
[52:22] women I'm not trying to go um hard at
[52:25] you
[52:28] this is just um you know as I said like
[52:30] if you want to see how spiritual the
[52:32] church is you have to look at the
[52:36] women know because if someone comes in
[52:38] this church if someone who is very
[52:40] spiritual who knows this message come
[52:42] inside this
[52:46] church if you want to see how spiritual
[52:49] Higher Ground Tabernacle is he has he he
[52:51] doesn't even have to look at the pastor
[52:53] now brother Rich he has to look at you
[52:55] the women
[52:59] you reflect what is in the
[53:02] church and we we we want to we want to
[53:04] clean the the church out that's what a
[53:06] true Revival
[53:09] is true Revival is getting all the trash
[53:11] out of the of the
[53:15] church we we don't just want we don't
[53:18] want new members to come to this church
[53:20] while we have people in this church who
[53:21] don't even uh uh clean up their own
[53:23] lives
[53:28] judgment the correction begins in the
[53:30] house of the
[53:32] Lord so that's why I'm reading a lot the
[53:35] prophet because I don't want you to to
[53:37] think to to think it's me against
[53:42] you and then to really be specific even
[53:44] the prophet wasn't against the women he
[53:46] was against the spirit that's in
[53:50] them I was reading a message where the
[53:52] Prophet says it's a spirits that in them
[53:54] and they just don't they don't know it
[53:59] you can clearly see how the prophet is
[54:01] against painting or wearing like uh
[54:04] powder or anything like that but we but
[54:06] you still see women doing
[54:13] that sometimes I wonder I'm like do
[54:15] these people even listen to The Prophet
[54:17] at
[54:19] home mess you know but some they do
[54:22] listen but it just it's like a spirit of
[54:24] stubbornness yeah so
[54:29] and we are here to expose that Spirit to
[54:31] expose the
[54:33] devil Satan doesn't like to be exposed
[54:35] as I said in previous
[54:39] sermons in 1 Timothy Chapter 2 ver9 it
[54:43] says in like manner also that women
[54:45] Adorn themselves in modest appar apparel
[54:57] with shamefastness and
[55:01] sobriety not with braded hair or gold or
[55:04] pearls or or costly
[55:11] array so whatever I'm going to be saying
[55:13] today just um look at
[55:18] yourself and then where you you find
[55:21] yourself faulty let the word correct you
[55:27] the Bible the Bible says we are Washed
[55:29] by the Water of the
[55:32] word you know and even men I don't want
[55:35] you to think if this is just for the
[55:41] sisters because you as the man your wife
[55:44] is a reflection of
[55:47] you you are the head of your
[55:50] household and many places in the message
[55:53] the prophet even um when he talks about
[55:55] the women he actually takes it back to
[55:56] the man he says shame on you man for
[55:59] letting your wife go out like
[56:05] that
[56:06] Satan Satan has invaded the country the
[56:09] the the United States or the
[56:14] world you remember that Vision that the
[56:17] prophet had on the souls that are in
[56:20] prison he had a vision he went to hell
[56:22] and he saw women painted having long
[56:26] nails and all those things he saw that
[56:28] in
[56:37] hell and one time he went to J pen I
[56:39] think that was the
[56:42] store and he saw the same thing that he
[56:45] saw in
[56:46] Hell and he said hell is on earth
[56:50] now so there are two the prophet say
[56:52] there are only two influences that that
[56:54] govern the world it's either of Satan or
[57:01] God it's either of Hell or or or
[57:05] Heaven that's why Jesus taught us when
[57:08] we pray to say Let It Be On Earth as it
[57:11] is in
[57:15] heaven you know and and um let me just
[57:19] show a few um statistics here on how
[57:24] Satan is actually working on the woman
[57:27] so uh there's this thing called uh it's
[57:29] too small you probably won't be able to
[57:31] see sorry uh but it's like plastic
[57:36] surgery surgery and it's on the
[57:40] rise because and then if you notice the
[57:43] number two is a breast
[57:51] augmentation so women they want to
[57:54] increase their breast
[57:59] and then in
[58:00] 2022 there were 2 milon2 200 something
[58:04] cases of women that had breast
[58:11] augmentations compared to 2019 where
[58:13] there was 1
[58:19] 1,700 you know so the good thing at
[58:21] least is that in 2023 it kind of went
[58:23] down from 2022 all
[58:29] and why is
[58:31] that because we're trying to pattering
[58:34] after
[58:36] Hollywood people are no longer satisfied
[58:39] even we even have a uh BBL La Brazilian
[58:42] bat lift or something like
[58:45] that so women are even working on on
[58:48] their their their behinds to try to make
[58:50] themsel more attractive
[58:58] so this article that I found online says
[59:00] with the rise of social
[59:06] media but a augment augmentation has
[59:10] been tactically touted by influencers
[59:13] and celebrities who often refute any
[59:15] claims of getting work
[59:19] done influenc notably members of the
[59:23] Kardashian Clan have famously
[59:26] contributed to the procedures popularity
[59:29] with their hourglass
[59:37] figures musical artists like cardi b k
[59:41] michell have both talked about getting
[59:44] below board but
[59:49] [Music]
[59:51] injections and then they say the BBL
[59:54] became more popular in the Us in the
[59:56] middle of the last
[1:00:05] decade the American Society of plastic
[1:00:08] surgeon called uh to 2015 another year
[1:00:12] of the rear in its annual report
[1:00:26] the the the that that year there was a b
[1:00:31] there was a b hog procedure such as Le
[1:00:34] implants uh performed every 30
[1:00:41] minutes lifter
[1:00:44] implant
[1:00:46] F coincident coincidently 2015 was the
[1:00:51] year after Kim Kardashian's INF famous
[1:00:53] internet breaking cover of paper
[1:00:55] magazine where she showed off the the
[1:00:57] behind that launch 1,000 think
[1:01:07] pieces cover theer
[1:01:14] magazine and you notice like if you're
[1:01:16] on social media you'll notice that those
[1:01:18] people they call them
[1:01:22] influencers and they even paid them
[1:01:24] millions of I remember I think that was
[1:01:26] this one musician called Selena Gomez
[1:01:31] they or even Kim Kardashian she'll post
[1:01:33] they'll I think she she will make a
[1:01:35] million dollars by posting just one
[1:01:41] picture why is that they are influencers
[1:01:44] but influencers of
[1:01:47] what influences from
[1:01:51] hell and then we Christians we are
[1:01:53] trying to pattern after those people
[1:01:58] you know we got to be careful we got to
[1:02:01] be care because those things carry
[1:02:05] Spirit no wonder you come to church and
[1:02:08] then you don't understand there's just a
[1:02:09] spirit of lust in the
[1:02:13] church but it's those things that you
[1:02:15] see on social media you try to pattern
[1:02:17] yourself after those models sir and when
[1:02:19] the women come to church dressed in that
[1:02:22] manner that brings a last spirits in the
[1:02:24] church am
[1:02:35] so this one article talks about this
[1:02:36] young girl she said that as a young
[1:02:38] black te in the late 90s or early 2000s
[1:02:42] Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez were the
[1:02:44] women of the
[1:02:53] hour their bodies were were perceived as
[1:02:56] the ideal posing a stark a stark
[1:03:00] contrast to the mainstream culture of
[1:03:03] flatb seen on real thin white
[1:03:06] supermodels and
[1:03:18] [Music]
[1:03:20] celebrities Brian felt like she liked an
[1:03:24] hourglass figure and wanted a natural
[1:03:27] looking BBL to feel more
[1:03:35] womanly so by looking so by looking at
[1:03:38] Beyonce any anybody know knows Beyonce
[1:03:42] here right so by looking at Beyonce or
[1:03:45] Jennifer Lopez she felt like she wanted
[1:03:48] also to look like them to have an
[1:03:50] hourglass figure
[1:03:57] and then she's not the only one you know
[1:04:00] even in this church where have people
[1:04:02] you see a picture on social media and
[1:04:04] you're like I want to be like that
[1:04:10] person but do you even filter that
[1:04:12] picture through the word to see okay you
[1:04:15] know the Bible says it's not a bad thing
[1:04:16] to copy good
[1:04:23] things but when you try to copy
[1:04:25] something that's against the word of God
[1:04:26] that's when it's
[1:04:30] bad our example should be fil anything
[1:04:33] we do should be filtered through the
[1:04:35] word of
[1:04:37] God the way we dress should be according
[1:04:40] to the word of
[1:04:43] God and it doesn't stop there right so
[1:04:46] just bear with me I know this is a lot
[1:04:48] of um stats this is probably the last
[1:04:50] one I'll read this is not but you know
[1:04:55] sat is the prophet says he's a he's a
[1:04:59] genius because those uh uh plastic
[1:05:02] surgery cost a lot of
[1:05:10] money so now if you want to increase
[1:05:13] your breast or change your butt it's it
[1:05:15] it's 10 10,000 of of dollars you know
[1:05:17] it's a lot of money but a lot of a lot
[1:05:20] of people don't have that
[1:05:23] money remember the prophet says that is
[1:05:26] still working on the
[1:05:31] woman some women here can probably know
[1:05:35] what I'm talking about if you don't
[1:05:37] that's good
[1:05:41] but there's this thing called
[1:05:45] shapewear so it's I think it's I looked
[1:05:48] it up on Amazon it's like $30 or
[1:05:52] $40 but it's an under government that
[1:05:55] helps create a smooth silhouette and cul
[1:05:59] your figure to highlight your natural
[1:06:10] [Music]
[1:06:12] curves highlight your natural
[1:06:16] curv especially when wearing tight
[1:06:19] feeding
[1:06:24] clothing you know so now he's developing
[1:06:26] these cheap things that you put inside
[1:06:30] you won't even know you know because
[1:06:31] they put it inside their cloth it's like
[1:06:33] an under on garment but it it it creates
[1:06:36] like a smoth it creates a shape you know
[1:06:39] for the woman to make her more have a
[1:06:42] shape you know have a behind and all
[1:06:48] that you know and this I mean this I
[1:06:51] learned that from my own sister she told
[1:06:52] me about that you know she said that
[1:06:54] there are so many sister that you just
[1:06:55] see them you think that they have a form
[1:06:57] but some of them now they wear those
[1:06:59] shapew wear to make them look like they
[1:07:01] have a
[1:07:06] form why because you are no longer
[1:07:09] satisfied with the way God Made
[1:07:13] You by adding all those forms it just
[1:07:15] makes you more attractive to
[1:07:19] men and and then and then men go and
[1:07:22] last after
[1:07:24] you and then that you just take them to
[1:07:27] hell and yourself to you
[1:07:31] guilty all right this is just um it was
[1:07:34] just some of the foundation uh the
[1:07:36] Prophet The Prophet said that our women
[1:07:39] has bowed to the goddess of fashion of
[1:07:48] Hollywood and the pulpit
[1:07:51] got and the pulpit got into Hollywood
[1:07:53] through singers and so forth talented
[1:07:56] man
[1:08:06] true he said how
[1:08:08] shrew how a shrewd man that devil
[1:08:14] is this is what I was looking for the
[1:08:16] part where it says she don't know right
[1:08:18] the prophet says that the woman is a
[1:08:21] nice woman
[1:08:26] I don't say she's de
[1:08:29] demoralized but the thing of it is
[1:08:31] there's an ordinary filthy spirits on
[1:08:34] her making her do that and she don't
[1:08:35] know
[1:08:40] it when every time you try to make
[1:08:43] yourself wear those tight feding clothes
[1:08:45] and those high heels and all those
[1:08:47] things it's a spirit on
[1:08:52] you and I can tell you that spirit is
[1:08:55] not of
[1:08:57] God and you know that Spirit even can
[1:09:00] have an impact on the service if you
[1:09:02] didn't know
[1:09:04] that I'm going jump to my last quote
[1:09:06] that I had here but I think this is
[1:09:08] fitting to what I'm saying
[1:09:11] here so the prophet
[1:09:14] said um and I was I was uh sitting at a
[1:09:18] convention now long
[1:09:21] ago and he broke me down almost
[1:09:26] when everybody seemed to be just
[1:09:28] enjoying a minist
[1:09:32] [Music]
[1:09:34] talk that was standing on the
[1:09:38] platform just like a situation right now
[1:09:40] like a minister uh speaking and enjoy
[1:09:43] you enjoying the word of
[1:09:45] God and I was sitting there in a
[1:09:48] corner and a young lady come in and she
[1:09:51] was really dressed bad
[1:09:57] and she come walking up through this
[1:09:59] church as the Bible says mincing as they
[1:10:02] went as she
[1:10:13] went so let's give it in our scenario
[1:10:16] like we're preaching and then the sister
[1:10:18] comes in and she's dressed immorally
[1:10:20] like with very bad dress
[1:10:29] and um meing means more like twisting
[1:10:32] you know like um um wearing high heels
[1:10:36] she walks a certain way that makes her
[1:10:38] body shakes a certain
[1:10:44] way and the prophet said and every
[1:10:47] preacher on the platform plus the
[1:10:49] congregation
[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:10:56] everyone turning their head and looking
[1:10:58] following this
[1:11:03] girl and and uh and I thought of the
[1:11:06] scripture the sons of God looked upon
[1:11:08] the daughters of men Sinners ungodly
[1:11:11] pray women
[1:11:25] toring many a church to
[1:11:29] Pieces it's tearing this Higher Ground
[1:11:31] to
[1:11:34] Pieces it took the spirit of God
[1:11:39] away you know so there was a service
[1:11:41] going on in a minister was
[1:11:45] preaching and a woman came in dressed
[1:11:48] really
[1:11:50] bad and everybody looked at that woman
[1:11:53] that took the spirit of God away
[1:11:59] and then we wonder why we don't see the
[1:12:01] power of God in the
[1:12:03] church the way you are you dress can can
[1:12:06] grieve the holy spirit of
[1:12:10] God a way from the
[1:12:12] church remember what I said earlier
[1:12:15] everything I'll be reading let's apply
[1:12:16] that to Higher Ground
[1:12:21] Tabernacle okay now let's go to I'll
[1:12:24] talk about the high heals um no before I
[1:12:26] go there let me read this one quot um
[1:12:29] the prophet says
[1:12:32] um
[1:12:34] um but okay let's see the woman is a
[1:12:37] nice woman I don't say she is
[1:12:38] demoralized the thing of there in
[1:12:40] honorary filthy spirits on her making
[1:12:42] her do that and she don't know it but
[1:12:45] you are
[1:12:47] pretty but if you if you haven't got the
[1:12:50] Holy Spirit there to protect those
[1:12:52] morals
[1:12:56] you would have been better to be so ugly
[1:12:59] nobody would have looked at you and went
[1:13:00] to
[1:13:06] heaven so sisters God G you that
[1:13:10] beauty but if you don't uh uh if you
[1:13:14] don't have the Holy Ghost you can use
[1:13:15] that beauty to send a lot of men to
[1:13:19] hell and that and that same Beauty and
[1:13:22] that same Beauty can take you to hell
[1:13:24] too
[1:13:26] the prophet said it would even be better
[1:13:28] to be so
[1:13:31] ugly than being a beautiful woman who
[1:13:33] don't have the Holy
[1:13:38] Ghost amen right so that's why it's
[1:13:41] important to have the Holy
[1:13:44] Ghost you know we can never emphasize on
[1:13:47] the important the Holy Ghost is what we
[1:13:48] need to to walk in this
[1:13:52] journey I think there is a quote where
[1:13:54] the Prophet says that a man without the
[1:13:56] Holy Ghost is like a brute
[1:14:02] Beast don't have no
[1:14:05] morals
[1:14:08] no
[1:14:10] amen and then you know here the prophet
[1:14:12] says the same thing the girls and them
[1:14:14] young ladies they pattern after
[1:14:17] Hollywood sister this morning if you if
[1:14:21] you were patterning after
[1:14:24] Hollywood you you should you better stop
[1:14:26] doing
[1:14:28] that all right
[1:14:31] um let me skip
[1:14:35] this so the prophet says that the
[1:14:37] invasion is
[1:14:38] [Music]
[1:14:41] on and it's sweeping from house to
[1:14:45] house from place to
[1:14:48] place from church to
[1:14:51] church from Men to Men
[1:14:57] you just look at another church you see
[1:14:58] all the scandals that are happening in
[1:15:00] the chur in those churches don't think
[1:15:01] it's going to stop
[1:15:06] there it's sweeping it's sweeping from
[1:15:09] church to
[1:15:13] church from the church in the corner to
[1:15:15] Higher
[1:15:17] Ground you know but if you don't know
[1:15:21] remember this the scripture that we read
[1:15:22] earlier if you don't know the devil's uh
[1:15:25] device is he has an advantage over
[1:15:30] you that's why we have to expose
[1:15:34] him all right let's talk about how he
[1:15:36] heals now let's go to the book of Isaiah
[1:15:38] 3 verse
[1:15:52] 16 okay the Bible says moreover the Lord
[1:15:56] saith because the daughters of Zion are
[1:15:59] Hardy and walk with stretch forth necks
[1:16:03] and want eyes walking and mincing as
[1:16:06] they go and making and tinkling with
[1:16:09] their
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:22] feet so you may say that um okay brother
[1:16:26] Le here the Bible doesn't talk about
[1:16:28] high heels he doesn't even use the word
[1:16:30] high
[1:16:33] heels but you have to understand that
[1:16:36] prophets in the bi in the Bible they
[1:16:38] they use the the word that were
[1:16:39] available in in their
[1:16:43] [Music]
[1:16:46] time for instance uh in the book of n 2
[1:16:51] verse4
[1:16:59] a it's a prophecy um regarding cars that
[1:17:03] we have in our
[1:17:05] days but it did not use the word
[1:17:11] cars but when you read it the Chariots
[1:17:13] shall rage in the
[1:17:15] streets they shall just jle one against
[1:17:19] another in the
[1:17:21] Broadways they shall seem like torches
[1:17:25] uh they shall run like the
[1:17:36] lightings you know so the um the word
[1:17:41] jle in the Miriam Webster it defines it
[1:17:45] as to come in contact or into
[1:17:52] Collision so this prophet he saw because
[1:17:54] you know prophets they have been they
[1:17:56] they see way way far like they they have
[1:17:58] Eagle they're
[1:18:01] Eagles he he saw that these chariots had
[1:18:04] they had torches so those those those
[1:18:06] lights in the
[1:18:08] cars and they were driving in
[1:18:13] Broadways you know so they don't always
[1:18:16] have to use that word but you can
[1:18:18] understand the meaning so let's go back
[1:18:19] to Isaiah
[1:18:21] 3:16 and let's study this scripture
[1:18:26] so the daughters of Zion are how
[1:18:32] howdy the definition of howy is um hold
[1:18:36] on I think I have it here it's blatantly
[1:18:39] or disdain disdainfully
[1:18:49] proud having or showing an attitude of
[1:18:52] superiority or contempt for people or
[1:18:54] things perceived to be
[1:19:07] inferior so this prophet he saw these
[1:19:09] women were PR PR
[1:19:12] prideful you you can't tell them what to
[1:19:15] do they know it all you know and then
[1:19:20] let's go back to the scripture again he
[1:19:21] says they walk with stretch forth necks
[1:19:24] and want to eyes walking and meaning as
[1:19:26] the
[1:19:31] go so the strong biblical cyclopedia
[1:19:35] says that the word mincing occurs in the
[1:19:37] prophets description of the behavior of
[1:19:39] the daughters of
[1:19:49] Jerusalem and then he says the P the
[1:19:52] passage might be rendered the world and
[1:19:54] trip along although the Hebrew word has
[1:19:57] perhaps a slightly different sense yet
[1:19:59] the Gate of the females seems to have
[1:20:02] been very much like the modern practice
[1:20:04] of swaying the body in
[1:20:21] walking so whoever these women that the
[1:20:24] prophet Isaiah
[1:20:27] saw they were wearing things that were
[1:20:29] making them it was changing the way they
[1:20:33] walk you know by the the way they were
[1:20:36] walking it was they were meaning swaying
[1:20:38] their
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:43] body and the prophet says here a woman
[1:20:45] that's beautiful that beauty will fade
[1:20:47] just as sure do you just give it a few
[1:20:49] years
[1:20:58] maybe today she's twisting down the
[1:21:00] street some little half dressed woman
[1:21:03] sending more souls to Hell than any
[1:21:05] baronss in the
[1:21:19] country but she'll twist herself down
[1:21:22] the streets thinking she's something
[1:21:28] as the Bible says they'll have stretched
[1:21:30] out
[1:21:32] necks and even even the prophet says and
[1:21:35] want on mincing that means twisting so
[1:21:37] the the prophet also agrees with that
[1:21:42] definition twisting as they go in the
[1:21:45] last
[1:21:49] day fulfilling the scriptures and
[1:21:51] doesn't know it
[1:21:54] they stand in the yard with immoral
[1:21:56] immoral clothes on men looking at her
[1:21:59] and don't
[1:22:05] know she may be as virtuous to her
[1:22:07] husband or boyfriend as she can be but
[1:22:09] at the day of judgment she'll answer for
[1:22:11] committing adultery with hundreds of
[1:22:21] men a spirit on them and they don't know
[1:22:24] it
[1:22:27] all right so this next quotes the
[1:22:29] prophet talks about a dream that he
[1:22:31] had I brother Brook say right that here
[1:22:33] before
[1:22:36] too it's in the message the rising of
[1:22:38] the
[1:22:41] sun it's a lengthy quote but I'll I'll
[1:22:44] take it slowly and explain some other
[1:22:46] things
[1:22:50] willing my own mother she's gone on now
[1:22:53] paragraph 232
[1:22:56] she was a very odd
[1:23:01] woman and she was you know about a half
[1:23:04] Indian and and she was
[1:23:10] odd she only had four or five dreams all
[1:23:14] of all of her
[1:23:19] life but every time she dreamed they
[1:23:21] dreamed it was true
[1:23:28] I remember one time when I first started
[1:23:31] preaching many years ago we was living
[1:23:33] up right um right here on the
[1:23:40] road and she dreamed a dream that I was
[1:23:43] standing here by the side of three
[1:23:50] steps and I was standing preaching to
[1:23:54] everybody
[1:23:55] that they must walk walk up these three
[1:23:57] steps before they hit the
[1:24:04] highway let's really take this um let's
[1:24:07] like pay attention and listen closely so
[1:24:10] the prophet in that dream the prophet
[1:24:11] was standing preaching to everybody that
[1:24:14] they must walk up these three steps
[1:24:16] before they hit the
[1:24:20] [Music]
[1:24:22] highway and on the highway is a little
[1:24:25] pearly like white
[1:24:29] line it run right into the doors of
[1:24:32] Heaven to the Pearly
[1:24:36] Gat and and that Pearl had been
[1:24:39] stretched out to the top of these
[1:24:42] steps so it's for instance let's say
[1:24:45] heaven is where de is
[1:24:49] standing like there's a a big Highway
[1:24:53] taking to de
[1:24:56] brother and then from from in the
[1:24:58] highway there's a straight
[1:25:03] line from the door of Heaven to where
[1:25:05] I'm
[1:25:08] standing but before getting to the
[1:25:10] highway there are three
[1:25:14] steps right so we are we
[1:25:17] following all right so the prophet said
[1:25:20] there was a lady that came by
[1:25:24] you know what kind of shoes people wore
[1:25:27] 35 years
[1:25:30] ago there was a lady come by had on
[1:25:33] Great Big pair like they were today
[1:25:36] Spike healed
[1:25:45] shoes so she was wearing Spike healed
[1:25:48] shoes and she come by and I said wait a
[1:25:51] minute sister
[1:25:56] notice he called her sister she was a
[1:26:00] sister this was this wasn't no
[1:26:02] stranger this wasn't no can you can you
[1:26:06] turn that
[1:26:06] [Music]
[1:26:14] off yeah thank you so this wasn't um it
[1:26:18] wasn't no stranger it was a
[1:26:21] sister and the prophet told her you
[1:26:23] can't walk the highway with
[1:26:29] that and I said you can't do
[1:26:33] that you know so the prophet gave her a
[1:26:37] warning that with those high heel
[1:26:41] shoes she couldn't walk the highway with
[1:26:47] those the highway that has you know the
[1:26:50] Bible says there's a highway and in the
[1:26:52] highway there is a way that takes you to
[1:26:58] heaven right just like in this dream
[1:27:00] there's a highway and there's a pearly
[1:27:02] line that takes you to to
[1:27:07] heaven and she said ah she said looked
[1:27:11] around at the rest of the women said
[1:27:13] don't believe
[1:27:18] him he's a mad man remember like I said
[1:27:23] earlier every I'm reading apply that to
[1:27:27] yourself so sisters that have high heels
[1:27:30] in your
[1:27:32] homes you know I think I was reading the
[1:27:34] message the identification the prophet
[1:27:37] said that uh you have to Iden identify
[1:27:40] yourself with the word that like um
[1:27:44] whatever position you have today that's
[1:27:46] a position you would have taken in the
[1:27:47] time of Noah for instance with
[1:27:58] so your response towards the the word
[1:28:00] the prophet's message is the same
[1:28:02] response you would have given him back
[1:28:04] then if he told you the same
[1:28:09] thing I don't know who has high heels in
[1:28:11] in their homes or right now or even live
[1:28:13] streaming but apply yourself in this
[1:28:15] message identify yourself in this
[1:28:20] message so the prophet is telling you
[1:28:22] you can't walk the highway with
[1:28:26] that but remember that that woman with
[1:28:29] those High the high heel shoes the Bible
[1:28:31] calls her hardy
[1:28:33] hardy which means
[1:28:36] prideful when someone is prideful you
[1:28:38] can't really tell him what to
[1:28:41] do they claim to know it
[1:28:43] all the prophet is telling her that she
[1:28:46] cannot walk she's oh don't listen to
[1:28:48] that man he's a mad man
[1:28:54] show you I can be justified Sanctified
[1:28:56] and filled with the Holy Ghost and still
[1:28:58] walk
[1:29:03] that I know better than the prophet
[1:29:06] that's that's in other words that's what
[1:29:07] she was
[1:29:08] saying your pastor is telling you
[1:29:11] something constantly going rebuking the
[1:29:14] high heels the tight dress but you you
[1:29:17] think you know better than
[1:29:20] [Music]
[1:29:21] him you forget that God put him to as a
[1:29:25] Shepherd he sees things that you guys
[1:29:27] don't
[1:29:31] see I'll will show you I can still go to
[1:29:34] heaven because I believe the
[1:29:38] message I don't think M wearing high
[1:29:40] heel to church will take me to
[1:29:45] hell no it all
[1:29:48] Happ and the prophet said I just let her
[1:29:51] go
[1:29:54] the word of God will always warn you but
[1:29:57] then he gives you the freedom to choose
[1:29:59] what to
[1:30:04] do God is not going to constantly always
[1:30:06] comes reminding you that what you're
[1:30:08] doing is bad there will be a one day
[1:30:10] that will be the last
[1:30:14] time he will just let you go just like
[1:30:17] the prophet let this woman
[1:30:22] go so if sisters in this church you
[1:30:25] don't want to listen to when every time
[1:30:27] brother Brooks is talking about high
[1:30:33] heels he'll just let you go you know and
[1:30:36] but but then by the result you will you
[1:30:38] will know uh uh that he was
[1:30:42] right all right so continue couldn't do
[1:30:44] more about it couldn't stop
[1:30:48] her you know and she jumped on the on
[1:30:51] the highway
[1:30:54] she looked back at the sister said see I
[1:30:57] told
[1:31:01] you she jumped on the highway she
[1:31:03] started speaking in tongues she started
[1:31:05] you know she's seeing the blessings of
[1:31:06] God in her life and she's like see you
[1:31:08] know he has nothing to do with her
[1:31:14] he and then she started to run
[1:31:18] up remember the Bible says run this race
[1:31:20] so she also started running that race
[1:31:28] but remember okay let's just keep
[1:31:31] reading you know as the Bible said in
[1:31:33] Isaiah 5th chapter that they would have
[1:31:36] outstretched
[1:31:41] necks the prophet said they have to
[1:31:43] because they're pitched
[1:31:49] over for me you know and um I'll just
[1:31:52] keep a few I want to show you an
[1:31:55] image how what what does the prophet
[1:31:57] mean by they're pitched over right prove
[1:32:00] it with um high heels okay so I have
[1:32:04] this
[1:32:05] here so um on the left Sid on the left
[1:32:10] side it shows a woman wearing flight
[1:32:12] flight
[1:32:16] shoes on on the right side he says a
[1:32:19] woman wearing high
[1:32:22] heels you can clearly see the
[1:32:25] difference you know and um before I go
[1:32:29] there if this is another example
[1:32:31] too no she's pitched
[1:32:36] over because the way the woman the so
[1:32:40] the way when I'm standing like this this
[1:32:42] is I'm standing 90 Dees from the
[1:32:47] floor and when I put on high
[1:32:50] heels I'm supposed to go it depends on
[1:32:53] the the level of heels but you're
[1:32:55] supposed to like because of the law of
[1:32:57] gravity you have to
[1:33:00] fall because gravity is pulling down on
[1:33:03] you those are just the laws of God you
[1:33:05] can't there's nothing to do about
[1:33:09] it so that's why now she has to be
[1:33:12] pitched
[1:33:14] over she has to be
[1:33:17] changed in order for her not to
[1:33:20] fall and that change is making if you
[1:33:24] notice in these pictures um it's making
[1:33:26] the breast come out and the butt is
[1:33:28] going
[1:33:31] out right remember Satan is still
[1:33:34] working on
[1:33:36] her he's trying to make her more
[1:33:42] attractive you see for instance in this
[1:33:44] even in this picture you can see that
[1:33:46] you know like the breast is coming out
[1:33:48] and the behind is going out
[1:33:56] That's what Satan is doing with with the
[1:33:58] women
[1:33:59] today why he's trying to make her more
[1:34:04] attractive we just we just read in the
[1:34:07] Plastic Surgery like number two was the
[1:34:09] breast
[1:34:17] augmentation and then even you women I
[1:34:19] don't know I'm not a woman so I can't
[1:34:21] really speak on that but I'm I'm sure
[1:34:23] you can
[1:34:24] feel a difference when you're wearing
[1:34:25] high heels versus flat
[1:34:31] shoes I think I was reading somewhere
[1:34:34] someone even says it gives you that
[1:34:35] confidence when you
[1:34:42] walk that
[1:34:45] Pride that's what Isaiah was Isaiah saw
[1:34:47] this thousands years
[1:34:52] ago and the prophet says pitched over
[1:34:54] they have
[1:34:58] to let's continue reading that
[1:35:03] quote meing they have to have they have
[1:35:07] to
[1:35:08] twist imagine the way she's already
[1:35:11] designed like um you know we saw the
[1:35:13] pictures and then now you twisting your
[1:35:15] body moving all all the parts of your
[1:35:21] body and then uh the Bible says making a
[1:35:24] tinkling with their their
[1:35:30] heels scripture in Isaiah says making a
[1:35:33] tinkling with their feet
[1:35:36] right those high heels when you walk
[1:35:39] when let's let when you go to when you
[1:35:41] go into a quiet room and a woman walks
[1:35:44] with high
[1:35:51] heels you just hear go
[1:35:58] you know that's why the Bible talks
[1:36:00] about making a noise with a tinkling uh
[1:36:03] with their their
[1:36:07] feet the daughters of Zion in the last
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:12] day you
[1:36:14] know she started up the highway just as
[1:36:17] hard as she could
[1:36:23] so she was also running the
[1:36:27] race but I think she was running the
[1:36:29] wrong
[1:36:31] race because because she she she could
[1:36:34] not she did not run the race with the
[1:36:36] instructions because how can you run a
[1:36:38] race when you don't even know the
[1:36:40] instructions of of the
[1:36:45] race for instance in the in the
[1:36:48] relay you got to have a a stick
[1:36:53] you know and you got to give it to the
[1:36:55] next
[1:36:56] person but imagine if you don't know the
[1:36:58] instruction you just running with the
[1:37:01] Baton and you get to that the person you
[1:37:04] don't hand him the the
[1:37:06] Baton or or or for instance you're not
[1:37:09] supposed to to go to your to to the
[1:37:11] other um the other person's
[1:37:14] Lanes there are things that can get you
[1:37:19] disqualified she did not take the in
[1:37:21] instructions you know the prophet is a
[1:37:23] is a mouth of
[1:37:25] God no so and then and after a while the
[1:37:29] road got narrower and
[1:37:36] narrower you know the Bible talks about
[1:37:38] narrow is the is the the way right the
[1:37:41] way I was supposed to read that but I
[1:37:43] think I skipped
[1:37:46] that but but so that that Highway became
[1:37:50] narrower
[1:37:54] you know and after a while the road got
[1:37:56] near and near and then she started
[1:37:58] reeling mining like that and off she
[1:38:05] went and mother said the horrible the
[1:38:09] the horribl screams that I ever heard in
[1:38:11] my life was that woman falling into
[1:38:13] those flames and smoke going down down
[1:38:17] like
[1:38:27] so those high heels took that woman to
[1:38:30] hell you know she the prophet say she
[1:38:33] listened to everything but one
[1:38:38] word Justified Sanctified baptized with
[1:38:42] the Holy Ghost but she left one
[1:38:44] word some of the things that you think
[1:38:46] has the the least significance you have
[1:38:50] to apply the full word of God
[1:38:56] if high heels took her to
[1:38:59] hell don't think you'll take you to
[1:39:03] heaven so the Prophet The Prophet is
[1:39:05] telling you that that you cannot walk
[1:39:08] that way wearing high
[1:39:12] heels so now it's up to you to to to see
[1:39:16] what you want to do do you want to end
[1:39:17] up in
[1:39:21] hell because you think you know better
[1:39:23] than the
[1:39:25] prophet or do you want to humble
[1:39:28] yourself and throw that out of the
[1:39:31] way no I I wish more people were here
[1:39:35] today to hear
[1:39:38] this but but this this also shows the
[1:39:41] spirits that's in
[1:39:43] you because when the word of God tells
[1:39:46] you to do one thing and then you refuse
[1:39:48] to do it it shows what kind of spirit
[1:39:50] you have in you
[1:39:54] because the Holy Ghost is obedient to
[1:39:56] the Holy
[1:39:58] Ghost the Holy Ghost in you is the word
[1:40:00] in you and he has to be obedient to the
[1:40:04] word if you don't if you don't listen
[1:40:07] that that shows what kind of spirit you
[1:40:08] have in
[1:40:11] you and you probably didn't know what
[1:40:13] kind of spirit you had but then the word
[1:40:15] just exposed that it's the spirit of the
[1:40:19] devil you know the prophet says she just
[1:40:22] obeyed everything everything but one
[1:40:27] word no see everything but one
[1:40:36] word all right all right let's um I'll
[1:40:40] qu end with this
[1:40:42] um so remember how it said that we have
[1:40:46] we have to um the Bible says that let
[1:40:48] your will be on Earth as it is in heaven
[1:40:54] we just read here the daughters of
[1:40:58] Zion and then uh they were twisting you
[1:41:00] know as they were
[1:41:04] going and then let's read in another
[1:41:06] place where the Prophet also saw other
[1:41:08] kinds of daughters of Zs that were
[1:41:13] twisting over there that was Isaiah but
[1:41:16] now William Bram also had a vision
[1:41:23] that was the vision of the Bride the
[1:41:25] preview of the
[1:41:27] Bride the prophet said I was to have a
[1:41:30] preview of the
[1:41:34] church and I was taken by someone who I
[1:41:38] could not
[1:41:42] see and was set set up on like a
[1:41:51] stand and I heard the sweetest music I
[1:41:54] ever heard and I looked coming and a
[1:41:57] bunch of little ladies about um you want
[1:42:01] to
[1:42:10] read you know they they all had long
[1:42:13] hair and was fixed in different dresses
[1:42:15] type dresses and they were marching
[1:42:24] [Music]
[1:42:28] just as perfectly in step with that
[1:42:30] music as it could
[1:42:34] be and they went from my left going
[1:42:37] around this way and I watched them and I
[1:42:38] looked then to see who was talking to me
[1:42:41] and I couldn't see no
[1:42:50] one then I heard a rock and roll band
[1:42:55] coming and roll and when I looked over
[1:42:58] to my right
[1:43:01] side coming up this way coming back here
[1:43:04] come the churches of the
[1:43:09] world each one carrying their Banner
[1:43:12] from where they were
[1:43:19] from some of the dirtiest looking things
[1:43:22] I've I ever seen in my
[1:43:25] life and when the American Church come
[1:43:28] up it was the awfulest I ever
[1:43:34] seen the heavenly father is my judge
[1:43:38] they had on these tail tail TL tail gray
[1:43:46] skirts like one of these Baron girls
[1:43:49] with no back on it
[1:43:55] holding up like a gray looking piece of
[1:44:00] paper like hoola
[1:44:04] dancing and I'm going to stop here you
[1:44:07] know I've never really seen this quote
[1:44:09] like that till just when I was studying
[1:44:12] this and I I I went to do research on
[1:44:14] what is hola dancing
[1:44:21] like you know because this is the vision
[1:44:24] of the of the the the the church you
[1:44:27] know the church that was impure you know
[1:44:30] that the other daughters of
[1:44:37] Zion and and later on you'll see also
[1:44:39] talks about were twisting as
[1:44:44] well so I I will show you uh this really
[1:44:47] brought something to my attention some
[1:44:50] of you may disagree but hey take it
[1:44:52] however you want want to take it that I
[1:44:54] just that's the word you know I can't
[1:44:55] help
[1:44:56] it but hopefully that that can help you
[1:45:00] so Peter if uh can you play the go to
[1:45:03] Google and play that first video that I
[1:45:05] have on
[1:45:07] YouTube and put um so that the people
[1:45:10] can see don't play yet put it so that
[1:45:11] the people can see on the screen
[1:45:21] here John if you can go help them no but
[1:45:25] you can't see it yet you got to I want
[1:45:27] to see it here
[1:45:37] first hey John slide it to the
[1:45:49] right yeah slideing and then make it
[1:45:54] bigger I don't play yet so um make sure
[1:45:58] it's also showing on the live stream for
[1:45:59] the people to see that there all right
[1:46:01] so just this so this is the hoola
[1:46:03] dancing that the prophet was referring
[1:46:05] in that
[1:46:08] Vision bride that he saw that's the kind
[1:46:11] of dance that we're dancing
[1:46:13] so
[1:46:16] play just no sound just play the video
[1:46:18] without the sound
[1:46:25] right
[1:46:27] so so the American people may not know
[1:46:30] this some may but you can pause it now
[1:46:34] um but for the I'll just ask a simple
[1:46:37] question for the congales people what
[1:46:39] does this dance um remind you of what
[1:46:43] kind of dance does it remind you
[1:46:49] of can one person answer
[1:46:54] I see you guys laughing just
[1:46:56] answer M right now now the play the next
[1:47:00] video U make it smaller on the right
[1:47:02] there's another video so this is the
[1:47:04] hoola
[1:47:06] dancing that the prophet saw that dirty
[1:47:08] bride
[1:47:13] dancing and I played the other video
[1:47:16] that's on the right of it make it bigger
[1:47:18] video it played
[1:47:23] so I have a question to ask you can
[1:47:25] pause it
[1:47:27] now I have a question to ask you so this
[1:47:31] is what the KES people call
[1:47:34] M and the other one was H
[1:47:38] dancing which one looks worse to
[1:47:43] you or it's it's it's going to be the
[1:47:46] same or this looks
[1:47:50] worse you know it's it's interesting
[1:47:52] interesting because I did not even
[1:47:54] mention the name of the dance you
[1:47:55] already recognize the dance from Thea
[1:47:57] dance you were like
[1:48:05] this you see those are spirits from
[1:48:09] Hell influencing the
[1:48:12] church and you are not a the Satan said
[1:48:15] the the prophet says they don't know
[1:48:19] it but we are here to expose Satan
[1:48:24] right you may say that this is an
[1:48:26] African dance but the prophet saw
[1:48:28] because hoola is a Hawaiian Hawaiian
[1:48:33] dance and the prophet saw that dirty
[1:48:35] bride dancing to the Beats of rock and
[1:48:37] roll with hoola
[1:48:42] dancing we have church people using
[1:48:44] culture to dance that kind of
[1:48:50] dance no represents the Bride of
[1:48:55] Satan and you really want to use that
[1:48:58] dance that Satan was that the Bride of
[1:49:01] Satan was dancing to us that's how you
[1:49:06] enjoy it shows what kind of spirit is in
[1:49:09] you no because when you enjoy what Satan
[1:49:15] enjoys the Bible says that Satan cannot
[1:49:17] be against Satan because his kingdom is
[1:49:18] going to be divided
[1:49:24] this is not about culture this is the
[1:49:28] word brother wasn't American but he
[1:49:30] talked about he talked about a Hawaiian
[1:49:33] uh
[1:49:35] dance so that has nothing to do with
[1:49:37] culture it's the way you dance when you
[1:49:40] you twist your body that
[1:49:45] way that's an evil spirits on you and
[1:49:48] you don't know
[1:49:50] it and then the bad thing is even by
[1:49:52] doing that you are also sending other
[1:49:55] spirits to other
[1:49:59] people you know Spirit communicate with
[1:50:02] each
[1:50:03] other you know that's why sometime you
[1:50:05] see some people you like I Just Vibe
[1:50:07] better with this
[1:50:11] person because your spirits are
[1:50:13] communicating they they they get along
[1:50:17] better and then you go to parties hey
[1:50:20] dancing M worship but you don't know
[1:50:21] that Satan is
[1:50:23] using you to send more people to
[1:50:32] hell so I'll continue this qu to paint
[1:50:34] short bobbed hair smoking
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:40] cigarettes
[1:50:42] paint I don't understand when I was
[1:50:45] reading this I was like I wonder really
[1:50:47] if people listen to the prophet
[1:50:52] problem we had especially with the youth
[1:50:55] people don't listen to The Prophet at
[1:50:57] [Music]
[1:51:00] home you've made this message become
[1:51:02] like a Catholic system where you just
[1:51:03] come to church the ministers read to you
[1:51:05] the word you go home and that's
[1:51:11] it or when you listen to the prophet he
[1:51:13] just on your way to work in the
[1:51:16] car but you don't really have the time
[1:51:18] to set to set aside and literally listen
[1:51:21] to the message
[1:51:26] no it's a Spirit of St if if you
[1:51:28] actually if you listen to the prophet
[1:51:30] you see this but you're not applying
[1:51:32] this it's a spirit of stubbornness
[1:51:33] that's on
[1:51:37] you you need you need to be delivered
[1:51:40] from
[1:51:41] it know and I stood I stood there
[1:51:44] looking she passed on by and you can't
[1:51:46] imagine the back of her the back of her
[1:51:49] with nothing on holding this you know
[1:51:52] the back of her nothing
[1:51:59] on sometimes you come to church you wear
[1:52:02] a dress that showing your like your your
[1:52:04] entire back is
[1:52:09] exposed that's not
[1:52:11] modesty you know this is the house of
[1:52:14] God is the house of correction this is
[1:52:16] not against
[1:52:19] you but you reflect what is in the
[1:52:22] church
[1:52:27] so um um and it was oh yeah okay let's
[1:52:31] see and you can imagine the back of her
[1:52:33] with nothing on holding this in front of
[1:52:35] her as she went shaming by by like that
[1:52:39] to to this twist throwing her her limbs
[1:52:42] out like that you know so we saw the
[1:52:45] daughters of Zion were twisting and we
[1:52:47] see this bride the Bride of Satan is
[1:52:49] also twisting our body
[1:53:00] how she was caring on her body shaking
[1:53:02] around like
[1:53:05] that many times I've heard brother boo
[1:53:07] talk talk about how sisters or even
[1:53:10] Brothers how we when they dance in
[1:53:13] weddings shaking their their body a
[1:53:14] certain
[1:53:19] way it's an evil spirit
[1:53:23] know it is an evil spirit and we just
[1:53:25] exposed that and you have to
[1:53:29] repent in order to repent first you have
[1:53:31] to humble
[1:53:33] yourself you have to acknowledge that I
[1:53:36] was
[1:53:40] wrong Lord forgive me I didn't know this
[1:53:43] was bad like
[1:53:46] that and if I don't see it if I I still
[1:53:49] don't see it but I I was working on
[1:53:51] another message uh on like a hard
[1:53:54] surgery where the where the Prophet says
[1:53:56] that oh sorry you go
[1:54:01] ahead he said that many people can can't
[1:54:05] live a Christian life because they still
[1:54:06] have that Heart of Stone in
[1:54:10] them live a Christian
[1:54:14] Life and the Heart of Stone cannot
[1:54:17] accept the things of
[1:54:20] God your own Spirit cannot work with the
[1:54:25] spirit of
[1:54:27] God that's why the Bible says I will I
[1:54:29] will give you a new
[1:54:32] heart I will give you a new
[1:54:35] spirit and then I will put my spirit in
[1:54:39] you that's why you can't you keep
[1:54:42] reading the the the the message and you
[1:54:44] hear Brother book preaching the pulpits
[1:54:46] but no moves
[1:54:52] you you still come to church with those
[1:54:55] high heels tight wearing dress and all
[1:55:00] that you need a heart
[1:55:03] surgery you need God to operate your
[1:55:06] heart and to remove that stubbornness
[1:55:08] from
[1:55:13] you God hates a prideful Spirit you
[1:55:17] know I'm going to close here we we're
[1:55:20] already done it's 9:04
[1:55:23] we just heard and then and then the
[1:55:25] thing is I brought this in the message
[1:55:27] or the Bible if anybody disagrees with
[1:55:29] anything I said just come see me and
[1:55:32] talk about that brother Brooks or any
[1:55:35] other the
[1:55:42] ministers remember in the beginning I
[1:55:45] said everything I say apply that to
[1:55:47] yourself so now examine your lives
[1:55:56] examine your
[1:55:58] homes examine the way you
[1:56:01] dress you know because you have a
[1:56:03] powerful Ministry
[1:56:07] sisters it's God didn't choose a man to
[1:56:10] represent his bride he chose
[1:56:14] you so it's a very it's like it's like
[1:56:17] the president of a country trust you to
[1:56:20] represent him in another in another
[1:56:26] place that's the highest level of
[1:56:31] trust so don't abuse it show to the
[1:56:34] world that you are the daughters of
[1:56:37] God don't pattern after
[1:56:41] Hollywood it doesn't matter what other
[1:56:43] people
[1:56:44] do you know but I want you to come with
[1:56:46] this resolution that me and my house we
[1:56:49] shall serve the Lord
[1:56:52] I think it says choose you this day wh
[1:56:55] whom you may
[1:56:57] serve this Wednesday evening after this
[1:57:00] uh preaching on on the women the dress
[1:57:02] the high
[1:57:06] heels and they seeing this example of
[1:57:09] two we just read earlier there were
[1:57:11] there was the true bride and then the
[1:57:13] the the the Bride of
[1:57:18] Satan those two are influencing whatever
[1:57:21] is happening in this
[1:57:24] world now choose ye this
[1:57:26] day whom you want to be influenced
[1:57:30] by the Bride of
[1:57:32] Satan keep on wearing high
[1:57:35] heels dancing
[1:57:39] M well and then like wearing tight dress
[1:57:43] we I see so many sisters sometimes
[1:57:44] coming to church with like tight dress
[1:57:47] it makes it so uncomfortable for us
[1:57:49] Brothers in the back there to even do
