TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen as we stand let us turn to the scripture we'll be coming from first uh second Peter please first chapter we start at the seventh verse tonight appreciate the Lord for being so good to us amen he is God yes he is and he's always uh mindful of us by the grace of God we just want to get right into the word we'll be coming from second Peter the second chapter we're going to read the 7th through the 12th verse uh verses and uh uh we'll read it prayerfully and we've we've gone through so many things here that by the grace of God we've already gone through so we're just going to uh jump right into the godliness and brotherly kindness amen and uh it says add to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly in the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the presence truth Amen Let Us Go by the grace of God to one more scripture Romans the 8th chapter uh beginning at the 15th verse Romans 8 beginning uh reading the 15th verse for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB father the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then HS HS of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also so glorified together but I reckon that the suffering of this present times time excuse me are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vaning not willingly but by reason of him who have subjected the same in Hope because the creature self also shall be delivered from bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for your good goodness we thank you for your grace we thank you for a lovely day Lord God and we pray father that you would just continue oh God to continue work on us oh give us a spirit of humility humble keep us humble before you Lord oh God that we will be willing to do whatever you would have us to do Grant it we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated amen we're still working by the grace of God with with uh completion I was listening by the grace of God to uh uh the message once more in 1963 11:17 and brother Brandon was talking about how Samson was stripped from all his powers and said basically had been defeated by the very thing that God has sent him out to destroy he went on to say that Samson was lured Away by we know the woman Delilah and Delilah types out the world but you see what the devil don't tell you is that while he's stripping you you're actually you losing strength you're losing faith you're losing all that God had placed in you the scripture tells us that Samson had Seven Locks and he revealed those locks that in those locks was his strength Samson types out the Church of today and we understand by the grace of God that God has given us Seven Virtues to uh complete yes and then God himself comes down and caps off with the eighth so we realize amen that here Satan always move slowly he's kind of like a creeper he's one that uh if you're not watchful unto prayer he'll be right on you the first thing he did with Samson was he put out his spiritual eyes and I am afraid that so many of us uh in this message eyes have been put out because we can not see the enemy and we can't see God as well and we find out that Samson had gotten to a place amen where all he could do was reminisce on all the things that God had done for him you are in a strange place when all you can do is remember yesterday or the day before yesterday what God has done for you God is one that should uh move in your life on a daily basis amen there should be praise uh and Thanksgiving uh every day of your life am so you and I must realize Amen to be backsliding as brother brandham said doesn't mean that you going back into the world but it means that you your knees are locked and you're not going anywhere so we realize amen there was one thing that Samson thought when he within himself according to brother brandham he thought perhaps there is an opportunity that God would restore Me Maybe if I call on his name he'll restore and bring back the the holy ghost power in my life but one thing that Samson realized is that he had to die with his enemy in other words the things that are in your life that have you bound or the things that you must not only kill but you must die with it hello somebody amen you must be willing to die if you're not willing to die with the Enemy you'll never get the victory am you must be willing it is uh uh uh brother said basically you know it must be a madeup mind I have decided I will die with my enemy oh Lord have mercy on me once more and you know in that message he was really screaming out basically he said if you only knew what time it was uh and that was in 1963 he said you ought to be hollowing and crying out now I had never ever heard him say that like that before but for whatever reason God allowed that portion of the tape to catch my attention because there are so many people even in this church amen who don't believe you've got to holler and cry out but I'm going tell you something desperate ation hadn't struck you yet when desperation strikes you amen you will scream and you will holler amen for whatever you might need is that all right now we're talking about uh I had a brother tell me the other day and and and which I thought was really good he said brother Brooks I'm not going to play with it he said I'm going to start from virtue he said I know I got faith he said but I need some power hello and I thought man that is really really good because the Bible said that sometimes we have to uh uh go back to that place where we were first illuminated and the Bible says you know there are times we have to go and do our first works over hello it's better to be sure because the Bible said make your calling an elect sure he said I don't want to assume I got certain things he said I want to know that I know that I have them and I thought brother that is absolutely the mind of God because I realize amen that you don't want to get up the road and find out that your chain is still weak Amen brother Ram said that chain that hangs be over hell hello that chain is only as strong as his weakest link and if that chain is hanging you over hell and you allow it to break you are in trouble hello somebody look it up in your concordance chain hanging over hell but listen in brotherly kindness because this is where we must we must all grow uh you know it's it's it's it's it it is what it is often time we fail to put ourselves in in our brother's place or in our brother's matters because we feel like we may be up the road and of course it's not our problem and of course we don't have the kind of complexes he or she has or have so therefore we don't understand why they got to go through all these changes brotherly kindness learns how to empathize or sympathize and brotherly kindness is know how to get in there and become that individual but how you going to become that individual if you don't even know one another hello somebody you can't put yourself in a person's place if you don't even know who they are and it's so that a lot of times people look at things and I'm going tell you something there's so many people in this message feels like what I'm preaching is not even necessary but I'm going to tell you something brother ROM said if you don't have this you don't have nothing amen now I was going to read a scripture and I read it I think it was Romans 8:15 I was supposed to read it for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption in other words that spirit that you get is the spirit that brings you to adoption amen a lot of time people believe that once I get that spirit in me I got it but brother bam said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just the beginning of the journey hello that spirit is the Holy Ghost of course but the Bible according to Galatians says it's your tutor amen it is child training you it's bringing you up Hallelujah and therefore you and I are not supposed to remain just children but you and I supposed to be taught by the tutor and the prophet of God said that Holy Ghost tells the father exactly what you're doing yes sir amen so you see getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the beginning of the journey right you say I don't believe that well Jesus received the Holy Ghost on the Jordan River and the father God said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in hello he was in there and the Bible tells me that he was led into the Wilderness to do what be tempted see cuz after you get the the Holy Ghost then you're led to be what tempted or tried Hallelujah come on somebody he was Tried by the lust of the flesh to L of the eye and the pride of life and and he came to conclude with the devil man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and this is another thing he said to Satan I am your God Amen I don't worship you you worship me amen see and once you and I coming to the full statue of Christ we become the god of Satan amen that's right why because the god of Satan is in US amen amen see now brotherly kind is is is hoping someday you know we have patience with one another and Temperance and enduring with him and knowledge to understand what he believes and you know and remember it's in his heart see and that's what it is virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness and meekness to him and having faith that someday God will bring him in see that's what we're working with that God will someday bring us into that place how you going to be tried and tested you can't Grumble when God bring test on you you got to learn how to thank God and appreciate God Amen for what he's doing for you amen all right so we realize amen by the grace of God that you know throughout the Church ages of course they rejected uh uh the Capstone and in in our day they rejected the Capstone and and God so allowed us to see that that he he allowed America to put it on her on her uh dollar bill and and but there in that time period there was going to be a people who would receive it amen amen sir and understand this amen the Capstone setting down and coming down upon you it's not because you receive it it's because he receives you amen when Jesus went up on the mount Transfiguration the Bible said there Shone a light from Heaven it was God coming down and he said hear ye him this is he hear ye him amen right now realize that in the messages of adoption brother R talks about the two sons of God that's exactly what happens you'll never be fully adopted without the world knowing it or the church knowing it it makes sh out like a secret but it will be made manifest adoption see is a relationship with God which God was pleased to establish between himself and Israel in preference to all other nations in other words when God chose Israel as an adopted son he made the world know there was a difference you couldn't just treat Israel any kind of way and got away with it hello as long as Israel stayed within the word of God God made himself made manifest right because remember Janice and jambre was a church member of the wrong Church they was of the Church of the Pharaoh but they were there they had signs they had wonders come on somebody but when it came to Moses God made a distinct difference through the signs the Wonders and all that took place right amen and that's the way God is even in the early church I don't care how many Orthodox Jewish Church there were that little Christian group was manifested as the Sons and Daughters of God by signs and wonders and that's what brother R said he said there was a time when the church had power there was a time she had strength but now she's like Samson she got more muscle she's got a bigger Church she got more people but has no power why and he said God don't want your strength he wants your heart because if he can get your heart he's got everything of you so adoption also is the nature and the condition of the true disciples in Christ uh who by receiving the spirit of God in their Souls become sons of God now there is no other place uh that that that that the elected is is ordained to receive God outside of their soul and understand that's why amen that the temple as I said last we had to be rent from top to bottom because God was saying whosoever will let him come but you know God understood who will and who wouldn't and he knew that his elect people would also hear his voice and follow through with the plan is that all right sure enough it is oh my God help us Lord because you I you and I must understand that we must seek these uh qualities and Virtues Of God every day now let me say it like this if you're not born again you got to get first born again because there's nothing to build upon right when you're born again that's Jesus Christ as the foundation amen and that found Foundation is laid there amen and from that point on you at virtal knowledge tempers all the way up that's God that's you growing and maturing as a Christian amen you'll never you'll always I put it this way there's always potential to fter until you completely capped with Divine love that's right hello can I say that again because the Bible according to the word of God said love never faileth amen love seeketh not her own love is not puffed up come on somebody up to that place you are you can be you can be you can go almost all the way because remember the chain is as strong at his weakest link and divine love out of all of them is the perfect gift is when God the fullness of God steps into your body and you become a living Monument now we're here and I said last week amen that these gifts uh let me put it this way according to the statute of perect man he says the glory the power of God coming down through this welding this together and he's talking about all of Virtues all the way from Paul all the way to Le deia he said God building his church is like one person into an individual into him self so that's why the prophet of God said uh justification make room for sanctification sanctification make room for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost make room for the person of Jesus Christ himself that is why he said it the way he did because that Holy Ghost Fire Burns everything out of you step by step amen amen and wells in Christ Wells him in to you so connected you call it a fusion he fuses it in there so nothing can break through come in or out you're sealing in there is that right amen he says listen a sheep bear wool and he doesn't manufact W facture wool uh like oh I must I must pray because I know I must pray I must stop lying because I know that is what I am to do huh that's that's a crow wanting to be a peacock see we're not talking and I've said that long time ago you Cann not teach a dog how to bark a dog barks because it is a bark he is a nature it is the nature like you don't have a a cow don't go to school to practice to give milk it is the nature of that cow to give milk so is it when it comes to these virtues when it comes to God in you it ain't a practice it is what it is it's a fountain it's a it's an teasing well it comes up bringing Living Waters see and that's where a lot of the people everywhere have been guilty I'm saying I got to do this I got to do that you're just under law and you're going to fail no Ang a but about it it's going to fail until you ask God give me a Praying Spirit give me something that'll take me out of the way and put you in place of amen that's what we need that's why we fall short that's why our prayer lives many of us have dwindled because we have been doing it come on it's evidence yeah see I want you to know one thing about God he knows how to pray and when God is praying he knows what to say and you know when God is praying he's is eternal so it time has no element you know I mean we come to prayer I'm talking about prayer meeting now because when you come to prayer meeting or even prayer at home you can pray as long as you want to uh put it this way God can take you say Lord how can I pray H H all night prayer normally you can't your flesh is not going to let you you can't do it but God can see when it's God praying he can take you all night and you won't even know to the Crow listen you know I I how many of you have experienced it yes you've come on some it got to be more than me in here all night where God you done prayed and pray you don't I was down there don't even know it seem like you just been there 15 minutes only God can do that there have been times I I got up from prayer in all cuz I didn't know I was so lost in prayer one of the things I remember even when I was in denomination and I'm praying and then they ring the bell an hour up I'm like oh my God I just I couldn't even stop I had to go till he stopped see so that's that's God when you can get so lost in prayer he's taking you through it and you don't even know like the Bible said you don't even know what to ask for that Spirit do does the Holy Ghost In You Makes utterances for you that's real prayer listen he said listen he said brother when you pass between here and Y it ain't that way there Oh my he says oh he says it's all love everything is real brother everything is real sister there's no death no sorrow no jealousy no nothing nothing can enter there it's just perfection that's what I'm striving for that's what I'm placing for here's a prophet saying that's what I'm striving for that's what I'm placing for come on somebody right he says oh Lord what I I'm here at the church for trying to set the church in order telling you brother and sister there's only one thing that can ever enter that and that's perfect love not because you are loyal to Bram Tabernacle or the Methodist Church or Baptist Church them all all right you should be but oh friend you've got not because you spoke with tongues danc in the spirit because you cast out Devils or move mountain with faith that's all right for all that's all right but still unless that real perfect love is in there there's what what's we're we're perfect that's where we're perfect they have they have obtained an inheritance inheritance inherit what eternal life being predestinated how he says does every does everybody understand that did you call on God no God called on you no man never sought God God seeking man Jesus said so no man can come to the father except the father draws him first see the nature of a man is to run from God and that's what BR that's what brothers me bothers me though to preach to you people don't remain on in the same condition you've been going in change now he said hear me I say it thus say the Lord I've never called myself this I'm not but you call me your Prophet or or or Prophet the world believes that the world around millions and millions and millions of people I've spoke directly and indirectly to tens and 12 millions of people or more directly speaking I've seen tens of thousands of visions and signs and wonders and not one of them have ever failed and that's right he foretold mean that that never failed to uh happen just exactly I bring any man to trial for that that's right I don't claim to be a prophet but you listen to me thus say the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all there was there no matter how many how much religion Den demonstration how many Good Deeds you've done whatever you've done that won't count nothing on that day it'll take perfect love so whatever you do you lay aside everything else until you are just so filled with the love of God till you can love those who hate you I'm I'm just as I said this morning I the whole makeup is Grace so you got to realize amen that you and I we our time is short and he says as long he said this in 63 6465 he said it's going to be harder long as the time continue it's going to be harder to get the Holy Ghost amen the longer he carries the harder it will become to get the Holy Ghost amen so if it's going to be harder for us that's why oh I don't know why I a well how can they get it so easy because God Is Lifting his spirit amen that's right and if you don't get it amen is nobody fault but your own come on somebody now listen what he says 1 John 4:18 said there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear have torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love and that's with anything demon work job it don't make no difference when Satan can make you fear and I don't mean come on somebody you hear a dog barking all of a sudden your flesh is going to quiver but that holy ghost kicks in sir right it's like brother BR when he when the when the when the when the when the uh uh uh bull was coming out his way amen he reached for his gun right but all of a sudden the Holy Ghost come down and settled the whole man that's what divine love is and that's what we're looking for now searching and diligently seeking God and and listen you oh brother I get frustrated that's all right every pregnant woman get frustrated when she's about to bring forth the child amen it ain't easy and your flesh want to get frustrated but you keep pushing and pressing and knowing by the grace of God this is for you because if you don't believe it's for you you'll never get it you as an individual got believe that you're bride and this is for you amen he builds a church and he's now building individuals the same way every church amen every church becomes one big church is that right he means every church becomes one big church amen now listen he says ever since by faith I saw the stream that flowing wound Supply redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die is that right he said though I speak with tons of men and angels and have not love it profits me nothing though I give all my goods to feed the poor it profits me nothing though I have power to move mountains and so forth it profits me nothing where there is prophecies it'll fail where there's tongues it'll cease and where there is knowledge it'll vanish away but when perfect love is coming to the human heart all demons in hell will never be able to upset it that's right he said hey is that good enough he said no demon in hell will be able to upset iten that's right he goes on and that was in Israel at Kadesh Baria and from that time he says amen that God is Christ is all in you all to you is that right don't you miss it my brother now he talks about his experience going beyond the curtain of time he talks about eyes have not seen ears of not heard neither have entered into the hearts of men that what God has has has for them in store that love him he said I've been more determined he said since I've been there I've been more determined Amen to do what God would have me to do is that right and he used that scripture he says lo I come into the volume of the book to do thy will oh God he said every day you ought to say Lord I want to do that which is only pleasing to you I speak in the name of the Lord except you have that perfect love you'll never be there cuz nothing could ever be there without it your spirit won't be out of place there uh if it couldn't come there'll be no way for it to come no more than it would be for a grain of corn to raise up out of the ground without a germ of life in it no matter how nature it natural it would look it could not rise and that's what he's saying that Holy Ghost that life in US is is the germ of life without that being in us there is no Resurrection right hello y'all understand that I'm saying these things because I don't think we I'm I'm it's F it's really unfolding to me you know it it'll make you stop all of the foolishness you know uh H and you don't want all of that you know uh you know but I ain't going to I'm not going to pretend I want God to take it I want God to deliver uh uh me and and and and and Place himself instead of all of the other stuff now he says Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you done got all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in the Tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the Living God Dwelling Place when a man possesses these kinds of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that God's Got God you might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of Faith but when these virtue grows in as you add it to that to that then you are a living Monument you are living moving Idol but you know the Heathen they prostrate themselves before the idol the imaginary God and in an imaginary way they believe that the imagination of God speaks back to them that's heathenism that's romanism they bow before the kind of saints and everything else they have right he said West uh excuse me they have amen uh Saint sis CIA and House of God and so many different things like that they bow to that and actually believe that in an imaginary way but he ain't talking about in no imaginary way he said what a type of it is true Living God but when we got not in imaginary way but prostrate ourselves before a living God a living virtue a a living knowledge a living patience a living godliness a living power coming by the Living God makes a living man a Living Image the stature of God what he do what what he's doing the same thing that Jesus did walked the same way he walked doing the same things he did because it's not imaginary thing there's a reality that proves it see what I mean see how these virtues these Building Material types in the church Min uh Messengers with the church ages now one of these days we're going to take each one of them and you know he goes on like that but anyway he's basically saying listen this is not an imaginary thing it's a reality one of my uh friends long friends and uh I put it this way Associates she was uh just died uh about a week or two ago uh went to Brother Isaac nor Aus Church there in in uh Tucson and this is uh uh the second time that I I've uh experienced or heard about it I put this way because the first time I didn't go to the hospital and the second time this time this last time I wasn't there but they told they tell me the sister when she was she hadn't spoken for a whole week and uh when she did awake she start greeting and patting a brother and calling his name a brother who's gone on before and say when she finished greeting she left out of the room she was gone be regard now a old sister uh her husband is the assistant pastor there at brother uh Tucson T brother uh uh norus church I don't forgot the name of it I don't want to call it uh but but my point is somewhere this lady this sister had it all right she didn't go down she went up am now my point is this the Bible said make your calling and election sure so you and I don't have to wonder cuz God said you can make it sure amen and by making it sure you're allowing test and trials to come and you know what's happening to you you're acting like Jesus would act that's right that's when you know you got it when you're acting like Jesus would act in every situation amen you know you got it you don't have to worry about flying off the h and want to curse Hallelujah come on somebody amen you got it like Jesus he said that's how it is with your brothers and your sisters he said when you be behave like Jesus come on somebody he said these two classes of people today same classes that's trying to do something to save themselves each one say I got to go to church and every Sunday that's very good I want to be religious he said that's very good that's still under a law but when the other by going to church being good is not something that you do yourself it's something in you doing it for you the Holy Spirit In Your Heart amen now notice in this intercourse these people that lived inside here seem to have always Fed Up always feeling good Ezekiel said I will write my laws a knew and put in their heart and where the law used to be on stones in the ark he said the ark represents the heart then I will put my new law in their hearts in the ark the heart is the Abode of God and in the Old Testament God dwelt In His glory over the ark heart is the ark God dwells not in the head in the heart God not known by theology God not known by mental conception God not known by old fashion Sanctified excuse me God's known excuse me by old fashion Sanctified Born Again experience that's in the human heart he said yet men and women live a good life love God by a mental conception but the real hiding place is in the heart hid with Christ and when Christ the Holy Spirit comes into your heart he is in you with your Temperance yes sir he's living in his own life he he's living his own life through his own will through you am I'm going read that again he's living his own life through his own will through you Hallelujah I know it sounds awful but it's right Christ so yielded you are that Christ speak the kinds of word he speaks he thinks the kinds of thought he would think through you he does the kind of works he would do through you you are yielded and resting what a beautiful picture of a consecrated Christian yielded Christ working through you Paul said for me to live as Christ and to die as gain not me that live anymore but Christ that lives in me Christ Living in the individual soul surrendered Christ speaks through the lips thinks through the mind sees through the eye acts through the temperance Hallelujah then the things of the world has passed away how can it be anything but sweet and pleasant all the time Christ has got control amen you see it that's what it is it's Christ in you Christ in you I believe it to be the truth brother Brenham that's right it's here it has to come here why are people so tossed about and that's in 1956 God in us Soul y'all don't get scared you just got to ask God to help us amen amen that's what he said he said if you know he said you ought to be Hing out and screaming out God help us that's what this message is trying to get us to do cry out God could never help Israel in Egypt until they cried out and God can't help you until you cry out that's why he putting the pressure some of us amen don't want to give you know I used to have a boy I spank him real good and he you know what he do ball his mouth up like and you could hit him go he wouldn't make a sound he was determined to outlast that switch but that ain't what God want I wanted repentance not stubbornness the weaping was to break his spirit so he could repent that's why God sometime to us to break us so we can repent but if you're stubborn longlasting is the whipping amen amen if you don't repent cuz that's what it's all about the chastisement of the Lord is to bring repentance and in our age Jesus said according to Revelations 3 be zous to repent know it's the truth you you watch your child when they've done wrong and they really break down and say but Dad Mom you know I really didn't mean to do it you're not going to spank them cuz what they giving you is what you was looking for they already repented they don't need a weapon and that's how God listen even God said watch how fast Ahab repent and he was a he repented fast but he tried to get Jezebel to repent but she wouldn't that's right she's going to get a whooping she's been whipped ever since you know but we've been born into this eternal Church age and you know the thing about it is you don't have to fret because if you can hear the eagle scream you can respond is that right amen you know we've been almost you know the devil I'm going to tell you something when you really get serious in in prayer you know what the devil say he said you going to lose your mind and you say thank you de thank you cuz that's what I've been trying to do all these years I've been trying to lose my mind huh do you really think God is going to anoint you to cry out for him like he said do you think I give you a serpent if you ask for bread not my God I need them demons to leave Let the Fire Fall but you know we always want to get our hands on it don't think I'm preaching at you I'm talking about me too somehow we always want to help God you ever been you ever want to fast and wasn't even led to do it you can't hardly wait to eat right you get mean it's true you get mean Snappy and everything that's because God ain't leading you you're doing it on your own it's your own Works you're supposed to be sweet when God leads you on a fast you know what I'm saying but when you see yourself all mean and crabby and all that you might as well eat you a big donut or something CU you're not doing nothing it's human effort come on somebody yall know it's the truth I've been there I've done it so you and I must understand to be able to yield to the holy spirit because I'm going tell you something when God leads you on a fast

more is that all right I I don't plan to be long I want this to really sink into our hearts I can't make you cry out I can't like I said go listen to uh that message I was telling you just a few minutes ago uh uh what was it uh yeah why are people talked about yes uh I think that's the one h no once more once more once more 1963 I mean he he talks about a lot of stuff but when he gets down to the he said you ought to be hollowing and crying out now they were not they weren't you can hear the tape was quiet he said but you ought to be holling and crying out now for God to help you and I thought Lord that's what that is right there I've been thought about that thing so many years but I remember when I was in Lime Ohio that's how come people got what they got to this day cuz we holled and screamed and we sought God in a way that was Madness to the other people but they standing today and I'm not saying you got to do it in a group you can go home and do it in your closet whatever you just make sure you get what you need you'll know it nobody want to have to patch you on the back and say you got it you'll know amen come on somebody oh my God it's so true I don't know what people going to do when this when this y'all when this stop market crash when this thing go down it's going to try everything in I was telling my wife wife the other day I said y'all y'all think Hollywood the devil is crazy the Illuminati owns all that stuff and they've been feeding them people I I was at a store today and they got these little cake y'all know little bald cake things that they they sell at Starbucks what you call them lollipop cake pops or something they had them looking like eyeballs for Halloween I said but it's brainwashing you're giving them to the children and come on somebody you get somebody hungry enough huh oh it's true Israel it ain't it ain't out of mind Israel ate their own children when they were locked in by Titus they ate their own children even in the days of Solomon remember the bab the the two women came with the children and they they they the one said okay let us eat this one today and they ate her child and then the other woman tried to get you know how it was and Solomon said okay bring me a knife I cut him into two see so don't think and and Hollywood the Devils know that it's happened before and all they doing is working with zombies and eating the Flesh and vampires and and all these things and they're brainwashing the people and I'mma tell you when that blast come and the grocery stores are shut and closed y'all hear what I'm saying it ain't going to take much cuz they already there people will do anything they need to do to survive remember that that plane that crashed years and years ago what did they do they ate those dead bodies just to survive and when people don't know God they'll do it y'all better I tell you uh uhuh I tell you what that's all I think about all I I that's all I I think about everything that's coming I said God what must I do how can I warn how can I tell I mean if you want me on the corner I'll stand on the corner I look like a fool because I'm going tell you something is coming sir y'all y'all might y'all might not like this but I'm going to say it anyway there's a racial thing coming too did y'all know that oh yeah oh yeah they they can't even keep enough bullets and guns in the stores H oh yeah and I really believe you know brother bam talks about the slaughtering of the black people it's coming come on somebody y'all don't have to say Amen because it looked like it skipped it he gave his own opinion about it but that Martin Luther King Spirit thing still roams every year they you they ignites it every year and you know what it's doing building more and more hatred and y'all I know what they doing and and and and people think at the YMCA and and and and and y'all think I'm going tell you it's on both sides the black people doing it too they they they doing the karate and all of the stuff preparing themselves buying guns and y'all think they just buying them just for martial law oh come on it's a reality I I I wish I could say it thus said the Lord but I'm going tell you something is what I really believe I'm seeing and when they put that man up there in that presidency all that did was oh my God it stirred the pot it did it stirred the pot and you going to have to make all of us going to have to come down to Lord Terry and decide who my brother and my sister is you better not go by color cuz if you do you in trouble amen I told a brother that the other day I said listen they brought Jesus and his brothers and his mother came up he said your mother and your brother he said no my mother and brother brother those who do my father's will that's who my family is it ain't it ain't got nothing to do with this this chocolate stuff here or vanilla whatever you want to call it ain't got nothing to do with it come on somebody y'all better know y'all better know y'all better know cuz it's going to come down to that it's coming it's coming now how you going to escape it without those true virtues huh how are you going to Escape that without those two virtues how you going to escape saving yourself without God in you cuz remember Jesus said if you save yourself you lose it right when it when it goes down he said that's what's going to happen to the denomination that's how they get the mark of the beast oh you can continue to have your home you can continue to have your job you can continue to do this but you got to do this see all right you and I don't y well I my grandbaby she's not here but she I might might embarrass her but she like to say either I'm hungry I'm or I'm starving and now she like watermelon like her Grandpa the other day I was with her she said well Grandpa why don't we just go by Walmart and get a watermelon I told I was going to get a one so I got to get a one by tomorrow but my point is amen you know it's you look at this stuff and and I'm going tell you you see these little children don't you know the children in the people in the uh Smyrna age they had to give their children up to all kind of deaths and everything else and they couldn't even get angry they had to portray Christ huh they weren't they they weren't fighting back brother said they even ran to the slaughter because that was the anointing on them and whatever the anointed is which is Eagle if you want to call it eagle or you want to call it Joshua wherever you are that's what will anoint you is that all right I I'm just saying all these things because I don't want you to think that God's packing us with these virtues for nothing God ain't going to give you all of this for nothing am there's a reason why he said we got to have it because if we are in the Joshua Ministry we must amen come to a complete Victory conquer everything in the land he said whatever you don't conquer will become your torment amen so you and I must die with the Enemy and how you going to do that but pray you can't add a cub toe the statue but when you pray the Bible said you got to pray believing that God will give you what you ask for can I'm going read one more scripture coming from Galatians please the fourth chapter he said but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son beginning at the fourth verse made of a Woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God have sent forth the spirit of adoption into your hearts crying Our Father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ and then brother Bram comes along he says if there was a line of Angels standing in line as for a request he said who and his son comes up which one he was sent answer first he says a son so even if Heaven is busy you still be able to jump line cuz you're a son amen oh my God is that all right how be it when you knew not God ye did service unto uh them which by Nature are no Gods but now after that you have known God or rather are known of God how how turn ye again to the weak and begly elements where unto you desire again to be in bondage now ain't that amazing because he's saying listen even with that Born Again experience he was absolutely dealing with people who had a desire to turn back he said You observe days and months and times and years and that's what they do in the message Brethren I beseech you be as I am for I am as ye are ye have not injured me at all you know how through infirmities of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first my Temptation which was in my flesh ye despise not nor reject it but receive me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus where is then the blessedness ye spake of for I bear you record that if it had been possible you would have plucked out your eyes and have given them to me and that's what brother said that was Paul's Affliction it wasn't in his side it was in his eyes when the um light struck him he was blinded but when the when he received sight his eyes constantly ran you know it's kind of like having sore eyes all the time and that's why he said you would have given me your own eyes right is that okay and I am therefore become your enemy CU I tell you the truth they zealously affect you but not well yay they would exclude you that you might affect them but it is good to be zous affected always in a good thing and not only when I am present with you my little children of whom I travail in birth again unto Christ be formed in you now he said I'm travail I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you that don't mean like he's saying some praying a uh saying a prayer sound like he's praying a prayer right I desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for I stand in doubt of you tell me ye that desire to be under the law do you hear the law the do not do you not hear the law for it is written that Abraham had two sons the one by a bondman and the other by a Freeman what's he saying don't you hear the law there was w a Bond woman and there was a free the Bond woman was a type of the law the free woman amen is by Grace oh but he was uhhh but he who was of the Bond woman was born after the flesh but he that is uh of the free woman was by what promise not because you travailed but because it was promised to you that's how come you get it amen promised oh come on somebody it's promised to see knock knock Lord who is it this is your son Isaiah what you come for my promise that's how you knock on to Door my promise you promised me I've been baptized in Your Name Lord Jesus amen you promised me amen how long do you do it to you get it right like one of those whining children amen which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants for the one from the Mount Si which gender to bondage which is agar for this AAR is Mount Z and AR Arabia and answer to Jerusalem now is and is in bondage with her children and you know what I looked up Arabia Arabian it means mixed and that's exactly what the uh uh uh uh uh ishmail was he was a mix so therefore he became an Arabian hello uh come on come on somebody I'm working spiritually with this thing because I'm like you can't mix world and God you still in bondage but Jerusalem is is above is free which is the mother of us all for it is written Rejoice thou bearen that beareth not bring forth and cry thou that travaileth not for the desolate have many more children than she which have an husband now we Brethren as Isaac was are the the children of Promise are you I've been promised a Rapture I've been promised to come into the full stature of Christ I've been promised to be capped off with the ceiling of divine love I've been promised Hallelujah you promised me you swore by yourself that he that begun the good work in me is faithful to complete you swore Lord and here I am send the fire burn everything out of me build your character don't y'all feel it build your character in me step by step take me through it I know it might be tough but you said you gave me the victory through my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ but as then he was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so is it now nevertheless what sayith the scripture cast out the bonds woman and her son but the son of the bondswoman shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman and you know what brother Ram said he said po little haar say she did nothing wrong said she thought she was doing everything right say she didn't ask amen for uh Abraham it was Sarah that did that to her and all she was doing was being an obedient slave and now she being kicked out because she misunderstood that's what he said and he said but God heard her cry now if God can hear a Bond woman cry what about you he surely will do it amen in in the tribulation period when those foolish virgins crying out he's going to hear them somehow they going to make it he gave them something to die and not curse God nevertheless what sayth the scripture cast out the bonds woman her son for the son of the bonds woman shall not be AED with the son of the free woman he didn't say she wouldn't be a they just wouldn't be HS with right cuz you I tell you what look at all all what the bonds woman got over there they got all the oil Adam AR's got everything over there come on somebody they gifted they smart they they they wow did God keep his promise are they a mighty nation the scripture say there so mighty said every nation they be hated of and is that the true today everybody hate them so then brethren we are not children of the bound but of free Stand Fast therefore the Liberty whereby Christ have made us free and be not a tangle again with the Y let me ask you something do you really think any of those Arabs can be saved I'm so glad y'all know y'all word the Bible said every every tongue Kindred and Nation even when we get to heaven we'll see some pygmies there everybody will be there yes sir I forgot what message there is and I don't understand that but he said everybody in heaven Won't Be Giants either so there must be some there too I don't understand it but I heard him say it so you know every giant wasn't bad so you know what I mean it it's like Rahab coming out where she was right it's like Mo you know mo over there in Ruth and all you know they might have been mixed in up all that but the Bible said the Lord knoweth them that are his hey somebody I thank God for his grace let's stand by the grace of God we're almost done but I I want to I want to touch the next time on on uh some things that uh even brother Keith shared with me uh and and the same idea had been thought thinking about but uh I I won't even say what it is but I'll let you come look at you know I I share like this people I put it this way and he'll know what I'm talking about there's always going to be a spirit of frustration trying to frustrate you it was for Israel and it will be for you and you've got to be determined because I'm G tell I'll give you a little bit because s balet means strength and S balet was a a moabit therefore he was a real close King to the Jewish people right and you got to understand by the grace of God that this frustration don't come in a weakness it comes in strength and the whole thing is to frustrate you oh I've giving up it ain't gonna work how can I no you can't do nothing except the Lord build a house you you build in vain anyhow all right amen so understand who's building the house so and and and you know it it's amazing CU When I was looking up some of the stuff I really got excited because I can see the spirits that we're now face where even in this message people are saying these virtues of what we're doing here are trying to get over to you is not necessary and understand who tobia was you know who toaya was he was he was a fake Jew he come out of Babylon come on somebody he came out of Babylon with zerubabel which mean born in Babylon right so they come out of the churches like we did looking like us acting like us but down the road they find out that their name is not on the book amen so they go back like believe the sign and they join with Sam ballot to stop the move of Malachi for so it was at a time when the temple was being built Hallelujah so that's where we are we're at a time where the anointing of God is to build your temple don't miss the season amen because when you see what they're doing there then it gives you understanding they're coming your way to put a fear in you and you know what they did a hired prophets to bring forth lies Amen to Nehemiah that caus him to fear but he said I recognize it wasn't of God Amen and he said God you deal with them Liars yes sir amen now what else I'm going to preach now y'all pull it out of me but my point is folks this is the season it's the frustrations at a dark time like this you asking for patience and brotherly and longsuffering and all of these things is it will front but you keep building brick after brick after brick you might St let me say it like this and don't think that those bricks were were Stones were easy to live that means your prayer life ain't going to be so easy there going to be times you struggling through it but you struggle because that's what God want to see your determination you came out of isra and all he could think about was the way Israel used to be that's what brother say oh Lord once more the way it used to be bring back the glory of God Amen and he said that's what I love about it what he said Samson said it it it looks like it could be a possibility and because he believed it could be a possibility God made it possible amen and if you got just a possibility in your heart God will make it possible amen just a little bit amen this could be possible for me just a little bit and God will make it possible it'll happen that's all you need just to doubt your doubts that's all you need and God will do the rest God will do the rest that's what season we're in don't give up now amen you know they had to stop on that wall for a while but we don't have to stop we're going forward Hallelujah they said it was a time it was no breach in the wall but you know what he said he said that he said what they didn't understand I hadn't put up the doors yet Hallelujah so what you need to do is put whatever breaches that put the door up make sure the gate is up no enemy can come in and go out amen praise God ain't God good o thank you Jesus Heavenly Father we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for being so good to us making us Rapture Ready Lord oh lord it's been a real travailing and real struggle but father we cast down every evil imagination we cast down every thought and desire that's not pleasing to you father we come Lord to do only that which is pleasing in th sight Lord be merciful to us Lord God hallelujah we want to walk like you Lord we want to talk like you Lord we to do think like you Lord speak like you Lord oh God we need your help Lord and we cry out here this evening be merciful to us Lord give us a Praying Spirit In Your Name Lord Jesus we'll be careful to give you the praise the glory and the honor Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray
