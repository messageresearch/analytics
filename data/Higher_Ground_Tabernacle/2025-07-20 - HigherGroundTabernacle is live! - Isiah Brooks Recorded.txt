TRANSCRIPT
========================================
You don't get with this program without dying to yourself. Brother Benham said he said the man that has conquered himself, he said he has more power than the man that runs all over the building. Learn to conquer himself. We are as remember I can't even get past the first paragraph. He says and it's a dangerous hour. I'm going to just come down here. He says um that choice has to be made soon. He says it's a dangerous thing to wait till that last hour too because you might take on something you couldn't shake it out. Brother said, he said, "You say when that time comes, we'll we'll get out." He says, "You won't be able to." There's people, let me tell you, there's people that they've I'm going to put it this way. There's people that have spirits. Amen. Have um devils and demons working on them and in them moving, moving them. And I want to say this this morning, some people, they're absolutely fine with living that way. Because they'll still come to church. They'll act as religious as the next man or next But you always can tell the people that aren't interested in getting rid of their demons because the Holy Ghost will start to fall as the spirit of God begin moving and the altar call made or maybe there's maybe you can feel the presence of the Lord moving to you and they'll find a way to leave the sanctuary. they'll find something else to do. They'll start messing with their hair. They become uncomfortable in the presence of the Lord. Judah spirit all over again. Brother said he said Judas. He said he went through justification. He went to receive the time to do that. That same spirit today with the work. They're not going to do that. [Music] Why would the devil leave when he you made him so comfortable to stay? And I wonder sometimes because I'm talking about you might maybe one of he said one of these days you'll wish you could go to a Holy Ghost meeting. He said one of these days you'll wish you could open up that old him book again. He said, "But that time will be over." [Music] This is incredible, brother. He said, "One of these days," he said, "the rapture will have happened." Do you realize when the bride is taken up, the Holy Spirit leaves? Brother, when that bride leaves, the Holy Spirit comes, then it's poured out all the Jews. There will be no more Gentiles. After that time comes, He says, "People will go to church. They'll just keep on going to church. They'll keep doing their thing." Some said they didn't even miss the Holy Spirit in their services cuz they never had they just kept singing, preaching, and the Holy Spirit wasn't there. The missing after the rapture, he said, "The service go out to drink coffee after and say, "Brother, wasn't that a great service and have no idea that the Holy Spirit won the whole vain do they worship me, preaching for doctrines, the commandments of menop you talk about a showdown, brother, there's a showdown coming down I'll tell you what, there's going to be a lot of people surprised. Going to be a lot of people going to be shocked. But I'll tell you one group that won't be surprised. I'll tell you one group that won't be shocked. said for the true bride. He said, he said the rapture will just be a regular routine of following the routine. She's been following the sheet music the whole time. You know, a real good musician, no matter what you do, you can't throw them off. You ever notice a good musician? No matter what happens, the singer miss a note, the singer miss a word, the music don't stop. Just keep on playing. Glory to another message. God's great symptom. All right. And it's brother, the point I'm getting at is that people will wait till the last possible moment. You know the Bible says that adulterers, fornicators, it names they will not be names they will not be in heaven. If you for if you commit one of these you commit adultery or you commit that don't automatically make you an adulterer or you can repent, get right, God will forgive you and you can go on living right with God. But brother, what makes you an adulter is when you do that thing and you continue to do that and what happens after a while that spirit don't want to leave that spirit and you have become one. You are now an adulterer. You are now a fornicator. You are now this other you are now a liar, an addict or you are some brother You you want to keep that thing going. You want to get right. You want to die. Pretty soon that thing won't leave. Amen. You remember that maniac that came into brother's meeting. He said he was stormy. He was telling me I was I was a snake in the grass. Said the Holy Spirit came down and said, "Because you have challenged the Holy Spirit, tonight you'll fall over my feet." Amen, sir. Amen. Amen. Right. Remember brother brother said he fell till the deacons had to roll him off of my feet. Amen. Brother said they asked they say is he dead? He said no. He said well is that spirit God? He says he loves that spirit. said as soon as he wakes up that spirit will come right back to him because he loves brother. It goes to show you could pray a spirit off you by faith. You can pray a spirit off a person. God honors faith that thing will come. That thing will leave. But if you don't want it gone, that thing will come right back. You remember when the spirit has left, brother, this has nothing to do with when the spirit has left a person, it walks through dry places. seeking rest. It doesn't find it. It goes back to the house where it came from and it finds it swept and it's not full of anything. Here is the problem that many people empty out at the altar. Many people empty out during the service. Oh, they cry. Lord, I'll be forgiven. You should do that. You don't ever get up. And the state of that man is worse than the first. I didn't like the one demon that was in me. How about him and seven demons worse than himself? He ain't coming back alone. He came back with somebody. Amen. Remember what Jesus told her? He told that he said, "Go your way. Sin no more. Lest the worst thing come upon you." We are one that should be right. He said he said it's a dangerous thing to wait till that last hour or two because you might take on something that you could never shake out of it. Today you hear his voice hard in your heart in the days when they provoke God to anger. Don't do it. Don't do it. Oh yes. He says, you know, there is a time when you can be warned. But I believe many people are going through that time of warning right now. That's what you know that brother Vanam said, he pointed out that a New Testament prophet is a preacher to prophesy is to foretell or to tell forth. You know that every time that a God called minister is behind the pulpit preaching you, he's prophesying through you. He's telling forth this word, brother. It's to help you, to tell you when you're wrong so that you can get right. Many people leave mad after a service when the pastors really come down something and start saying, "Lord, thank you for your grace. Thank you for your mercy because I was going on to the world. Amen. Yes, sir. He says, you know, there's a time when you can be warned. Then if you step across that line of warning, then you're already marked on the other side. My advice to you, when God speaks to your heart, you act right then. Yes, sir. Amen. You say, "Well, brother, the preacher's in the middle of his message." No, you respond right. I was in a youth service one time years ago. I wasn't even married. So it's been probably 13 years back or 13 14 years back. Brother, my dad was speaking. I'm not saying it because it was my dad. He just happened to be. He was maybe 30 minutes into his message. My dad preached an hour and a half, two hours sometimes. He was maybe 30. He was maybe about a half hour in. He didn't ask for anybody to come. He didn't make an alter call. He had made a statement for brother. He said, "How many be willing to lay aside all of yourself to give all yourself to the Lord?" That's all he said. I promise you, he probably still had at least another 30, 40 minutes left. I don't know. I've never been in a service quite like that. But it was like God put a magnet at the altar. You might have not even been planning on going to the altar. He made that statement. And with my hand raised to heaven this morning, every single young person, there was probably at least 60 young people in that room. Every single young person ran to the altar. Praise God. Every one of them. Um, brother, you could have seen it. Maybe there were people pushing one another trying to get there. Who could get there quicker? There were people, you know, brother made the statement. He said, "If hell could open up its doors, he said you'd never have to make an altar call." He said, "If hell could open up," He said, "You'd never have to make an altar call. He said they would be coming out of there crawling over one another to get to the service you won't go to to get to the altar that you won't go toward. He says because they've realized there in that place just how wrong they were. just how defeated they were. He said they have the same opportunity you do tonight. They have the they have the same opportunity you do this morning. Amen. He said, "But they pass beyond mercy. They'll never be redeemed." He says, "You wouldn't want to take their place. He says, "Then why not take your place with the redeemed?" But I'm telling you this morning, I got past one page, there's a Mount Carmel experience going on right here. People are making choices. People are making decisions. Every time this word is preached, you have to make a decision. You have to make a decision whether you're going to receive it. What are you going to do about this word? You going to live it or just the parts that are easy or just the parts that are convenient to your lifestyle. Tell you what, you can't live this word of God without the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. Amen. That's the truth. Can't do it. How could you do it without the life that wrote this word in you? You couldn't. You know that God gave the children of Israel a life knowing they couldn't live it. He gave them something to keep that he know they couldn't keep. He knew the frailty of human beings. He knew they couldn't keep it. He knew they were going to fail. He knew they were going to fall. And he gave them it anyways and said keep it knowing they were true brother. Amen. Right. That's true. They were written on tables of stone. Brother, you can't roll it up like a scroll. You either keep them or you break them. There is no stone. Aren't you thankful that now the tables of the heart came? God knew you couldn't live this word. God knew you could just as much as you could make it to service on time this morning. Amen. Amen. But the lamb in you can live it. He that is born of God does not commit sin. The sea of God remains here. to go there. As a human being, I couldn't keep myself. It keeps me from sin and it keeps me. God works through the blood and he sees perfection. Amen. That's right. Hallelujah. But that's why we ought to be striving daily to get to get those in. Amen. Diligently seeking diligently working because brother without that there is no rapture for you. There is no seal. There is no adoption. That's why you find many people in and out of church all the time. In and out and out back and forth. One day they're good, one day they're mad. One day they're losing, one day they're not. I said it matters where you're eating it at. It matters if you have the Amen. Oh, we're tired of hearing that word. Sound like something familiar? Oh, we're tired of hear the pastor preach the same thing. We just preach same scripture, same old stuff. Sound like the children of Israel, same old man. Where is this life bread? All this matter was kind of this. You know when it gets old, I say, you know, when it gets old, when you don't want to hear it no more. When you don't want to hear it, it's not warmed over to you. It's just as fresh as the first day. Don't remove the ancient landmarks that were set. You know, he says, he's talking about the woman that lost that coin. He says, "We haven't lost one." He says, "We've practically lost all of them. Brother, there haven't been one landmark taken out. There's been almost all of them taken out. Where do you even find hardly anybody that'll stand for everything that this prophet said regardless of understand? You can't do that without the Holy Ghost. I promise you that. I promise you that. Thank you, Lord. Watch. She says, "We're going to let's true sign that's overlooked." 61. When Elijah then called for a showdown spectacular and called for a showdown, said, "If God be God, serve him. If Bao be God, serve him." He said, "Couldn't that be a wonderful day for Elijah today? be a wonderful thing for the Elijah today. How many knows who our Elijah was? Yes, sir. Absolutely. Look, he said, "If God's God, serve him. If Baal be God, serve him." A double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways. What Elijah, when he stepped out, he said, "How long halt you between two opinions? I bet you there's people here this morning halted between two opinions. Man made a decision on what they believe in. They're halted between two different things. You know the brother random said that God act in the beginning when the battle happened in heaven. You know that actually twothirds of the angels were deceived. Not just one because there was a group that couldn't like their minds. There was a group that was totally deceived. There was another group that couldn't quite make up their minds. And there was another group that fought with Michael. I don't know about you, but I just believe I'm one of those Michael. I'm one of those that fought with Michael. I just I just believe it that way. But there was another group that couldn't quite make up their minds. No, brother said, "The foolish virgin is absolutely deceived of the devil and doesn't know it. I'm just going to leave it there. I'm just going to leave it there. I'm just going to leave that there. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. You better choose what God you're going to serve. So, brother, I made that decision long ago. I've always believed in God. Ever since I was two years old, I believed in God. No doubt up here you believed in God. But brother, you show what you believe by what life you live. That shows what you really believe. Amen. You show what revelation you have by what life you live. Anybody can believe a lot of things up here can say a lot of things here. But you prove what it is you do believe by what kind of a life you live. By their fruits you shall know, not by what they say with their mouth. By their fruits, brother Adam said, "What we need in Jeffersonville is thousands of lived voices." We don't need a lot of people saying a lot of things. We need people a lot of things. That's the hugest hindrance to the message churches, the Christian church of today is lives that aren't lived according to what they preach. We talk about victory. We talk about Holy Ghost. We talk about a life. We talk and then go outside and live contrary to what we just said. Contrary to what we just raised our hand. Amen. Amen. Dance all you want, shout all you want, and then go inside and say something that'll split a church. Show what kind of spirit you really I might feel a lot of things as a human being, but guess what? If the spirit of God is in me, it's going to cancel all that out. You want to cancel somebody, cancel yourself. You should cancel yourself. My brother don't give me problems. My sister don't give me problems. My pastor don't give me problems. Your brother, your sister, your child, your family. Well, brother, all my family this way this way. Yeah. All the way back to Adam. You can all you can change it all the way. I don't sure, but how long are you going to blame it on Adam? Amen. Yeah. I believe God gave us this message to rise above. The blood gives us power to rise above the fall. To rise above the Do you realize the new birth takes care of family curses? Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. Amen. Well, this happened and that happened. What does that have to do with you? Come on. Don't tell me you're going to get there in that day and say, "Lord, the reason I couldn't do it was because of all the hypocrites." What does that have to do with this one didn't limit and he claimed to be this couldn't do it. What did that have to do with a personal experience? No. based on what this person did to that person. You still got your eyes on Miss Jones. You still got your eyes on Miss Jones. But what about you? What are you going to do? What are you going to do when they say bow to that idol? You going to bow down with the rest of them or regardless you're going to stand. You know that brother said Daniel and Shadrach, he said they kept the victory with no home church to go to have a hym book to sing from. They didn't have a screen for him and read words. But you go to some churches, they can't even open their mouth and there's a screen with words on it. Amazing grace that people still sit there with their lips never in the right place of God. Don't tell me not to praise my God. Amen. [Music] [Music] Amen. Amen. Shut up, devil. [Applause] Amen. save my Elijah. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother, he got up there. He said, "Now, I'm going to let you go first." He said, "I'm going to let you guys go first." You guys go ahead and do your thing, and I'll wait back here and just wait for you all to be. But they got up there, they lanced themselves, they cut one another, they yelled, they scream. like a lot of pet people today in churches. Oh, sure. They scream, they shout, they cry. They do it all. Laughing against those things, brother. I I want those things in the church. Holy things. I have no problem with sitting, dancing, rolling, screaming, hopping chairs, throwing chairs. You do whatever the Holy Spirit puts on. I've seen it all, brother. I've seen people crawl around making noise. I've heard the whole night. And you know what, brother? I don't I don't mind it. As long as it's the Holy Spirit doing it in you, I don't care. Amen. But brother, when you can do all that and the God of heaven not behind anything you're doing with it, that's why brother was always on the Pentecostals, there was nothing wrong with their joy. What was wrong with it is they didn't have a life to back it up. You left the word. You've left the life. the life that was very uh brother John back there he was teaching the Sunday school earlier on Samson says you let out the secret that's why the gloryy's gone he said you let out the secret was that godly life you were living [Music] without holiness no man shall see God and brother without holiness in the church you shall not move and you One one person out alive can cause an entire church to fail. He said it could cause someone. [Music] I don't want that on my record. I just didn't feel like worship today. Then you ought to apologize to the families who kids didn't receive the Holy Ghost because you just didn't feel like worship. I didn't feel like I feel like I feel like you got to apologize to the parents that their kids didn't get what they needed to out of service because God is good. He's sovereign in spite of our failures and our misfort. Amen. Aren't you thankful for that? Many times we get nothing. We get nothing, brother sister. Yes. Amen. Lord. Oh my. Elijah, he was he was confident, brother. Amen. Let me I'll tell you the other side of this, too. Those people put forth more effort and more because the Bible says they they did that all the way to the evening sacrifices. They did all that all the way. It was time for the evening service. They cut themselves, worshiped, did all their till it was time for an evening service. But they put forth more effort and gave more of their time than most people that call themselves message believers. Amen. But if they've got anything else going on, they just ain't going to be in church. Maybe this is stuff for the pastor to say, but I'm just I'm just saying it as it comes. You got anything else going on? We just won't be at church today. I got something else. You got something else. You got something else that's more important than coming to the house. You got something else. But I want to know what you're doing. It's that much better and that much more important. I want to know what you're doing. Shoot. I'm I'm in the wrong institute. I'm I'm doing the wrong thing. I didn't know what you're doing. Apparently, it's more important and more than going to the house of the Lord. I don't know what it is. It must be the funniest thing I've ever had going on. It was much much more important than eternal life. Right. Right. Brother said it mattered where you went to church. It mattered who taught you. He said you ought to seek out the very best. That's a slap in the face to your pastor. You don't show up because you had something else you had going on. You're telling him, "I don't feel like you're the very best." Well, you want to find somewhere you like going. You got to find somewhere that you want to come to. They did their thing. Elijah tells them, "Hey, maybe your God's asleep. Maybe he's gone fishing. Maybe he's done this or that." They cry loud. Cry loud. They do. They cut each other more. Then all this stuff going on. But then it came time for the offering of the evil. Amen. It came time for the real thing. And at that time, all the things they were doing went, "Amen." All their hollering, all their screaming, all their worship went. Now it's time for God to action. And when they stop, you might come to find out, God's waiting for you to stop talking. So, he's waiting for you to stop screaming, will he? Amen. Amen. Oh, hallelujah. Yes, sir. Now came time for the evening sacri the evening time. Now it came time for the evening time. And all their thing. Now it's time for Elijah to speak. But I said, "When the lion roars in the forest, everything else shall." Now, after the lion roars, maybe it's time to prophesy. But while he's roaring, you know, when brother was here speaking, doing things, just in my mind, I believe no one else had a right to be on the field. I know they had their place, but brother the prophet of the ages on the field, it's time for me to turn my attention towards what God is speaking. But when Elijah left, guess what? It was time for Elisha to pick up on continue preaching this word and continue and continue on. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. The lion has roared. Who can but prophesy? While he's roaring, I don't want to say anything. But after he's roared, now it's time to tell forth. Time to prophesy again. Time to read the book. Listen, he was brother said he was certain of God. He was certain where he stood. When it came time, he said, "Give me put all the altar together." He rolled those stones together. There'll be no schism in the body, brother. He rolled the whole thing together. And he was so calm, he said, "Pour on some water. I don't need this thing to be dry. Go ahead and pour it on, brother." He went through three pools of water. He went through three pools of water and he poured it on. Amen. And he said, "Okay. Now we'll do that. Lord, according to your word, oh brother, sister, do you realize notice also he said, Lord God, of Abraham, Abraham, Isaac, he didn't say of Jacob. He said, "And of Israel," he didn't use his deceiver name. He used the name God had given. Oh brother, you might have the rest of the family might only remember your past and who you were. They only remember the guy that used to be old that used to be Jesus. I will do a new thing among you. I will do a new thing among you. And then I'll put your name and then I'll write it in white stone. [Applause] And the rest of the world may not know it, but you'll know it. God gave it to you. It's a personal revelation to you. I know the forgiveness of sins. Amen. Praise God. Amen. Said, "Lord, I did this all at your word. I did all this at your word. Lord, I don't know what else to do. I didn't do this of my own accord. I didn't do it cuz I woke up today and said, you know what? I'm going to go out here and just do some wonderful things. I did all this at your word, Lord. At this point, it's all up to you cuz I did everything you told me to do." Brother said, he said, "When Moses got to that Red Sea, He said it wasn't Moses's job to open up the Red Sea. No, sir. Those are things I can do. You know, everybody in this building could blow as hard as they want at a sea somewhere and that thing ain't going to open nowhere. Brother, there's things only God can do. Only God can do. He said it's not your job to open the sea. It's not your job to speak in the job speak when you met God's conditions. Call for it. Brother, if you call for fire and it don't fall, go back and check. Roll over every stone. Make sure you condition because he said if you did, you could call for a I'm not taking the prophet's place, but I do want to take mine. I don't believe in taking brother Benham's place, but I do believe in taking mine. Amen. Amen. on my gospel again. Amen. Amen. I don't want to be more than what God's called me to be, but I definitely don't want to be less than what God's called me to be. You're the man who said she'll speak and it'll flash. Did he say it? Anybody ever seen lightning flash? Pretty bright, pretty loud. They'll speak and they'll flash. like he said, "One of these days the sons of God will speak and their word will be backed." Not praying anymore. The third is not pray. We've done that for years. Hallelujah. It's a miracle every day. The Bible says when Paul and Silas [Applause] were single. Amen. Amen. The earth begin [Applause] [Applause] [Music] look at that scripture again. It says suddenly Paul inside and a couple weeks later and suddenly I sure likely wasn't even expecting it. Maybe there weren't even [Applause] for 10 days. didn't even know what it was. We didn't even know God. [Applause] Amen. Amen. Right. Gandhi [Applause] in my nose, but God's gone down somewhere this morning. Thank you, Lord. Praise God. Glory to God. Sister, I don't know what you need, but receive it right now in the name of Jesus. God is here this morning, brother. Whatever you need, you raise up this. Baby, you need a suddenly and an immediately that moment. I can't wait another day. I'm too desperate. I need something right now. Yes, sir. Where are you at this morning? Where's your faith this morning? There's a showdown right here this morning. Carnal experience going on this morning. People are making decisions. People are decision. Go see where your faith is or not. see where you're really at or not. But you can't claim all kinds of stuff and not live any of it. I want to claim what my name is on. I don't want to claim anything else. I don't want to be nothing that I ain't called to be. I tell you, the Lord is here this morning. I believe if you'll speak out loud what your need is, I believe God will need it right now wherever you at this morning. Amen. Oh, glory to God. [Music] Oh, reach out and touch the Lord with a perfect song. Yes. Oh my. Hallelujah. [Music] Reach out, touch the as he passes by. Amen. You will find he's not too busy. Amen.

[Music] Let's give God a round of applause. [Applause] We thank God for our brother Timothy. And you know God is still God. The thing that I have heard for the veterans say that many people because they refuse to go all the way. That is a scary moment never want to experience and what people don't realize is that this message is all about character. Rebecca was chosen because of her parents. Ruth was chosen because of her character. The bride of Jesus Christ is chosen because of her character. He's given us the character or the means by obtaining the character. But you must make a choice. You've got to die out and rot to yourself. being said more than once here. People of God, this is not just a regular church service. You may have said to yourself with that kind of saying a lie to you. Amen. Because it's so deep, many of us didn't even understand what he said. I don't know what he did, but I I said it like that. I believe God spoke. And God doesn't waste his time, nor effort. Somebody need to be cleansed. Somebody needs the Holy Ghost in this church. Amen. Somebody needs repent. Somebody needs deliverance. That's what the Lord said. And he gave you the opportunity to do so. But many of you did just what he said. By God's grace, those of you who stood and sat there, you'll see your heart became your altar. I have nothing against that. But I'm going tell you something. It's a possibility that you may not get another call like you did today. And I thank God for the message because you were challenged by God and you didn't even know it. You saw a young man appear. thought that sermon is not so whatever you think it can be so simple it'll pass right through it takes a spiritual mind to hear the voice of God you know and I'll say it like this many of you would have never followed But John was always putting the axe to the root of the tree. John put the axe to the root of the tree. John asked. He put the axe in the root of the tree. He cut down trees off limbs. Hallelujah. Shouting, "Oh, hallelujah." But John preached so hard. They say he had a devil. Jesus Christ preached so hard. They said he was the answer. But every word that was spoken never went back for it accomplish his purpose. And so did the message this morning. Amen. I enjoyed it, brother. Amen. It was needed. We are at that right there. where we're we're getting ready to cross over and unless the changes be made in you by the Holy Ghost, you you won't make it. Your religion will be in vain. Your brother Brandon will be in vain. Many people feel like they can follow brother Brandon without change. This message brings a change. [Music] That's how you know you follow him. Like somebody said, "Well, you don't love brother." If you love him, keep his commandments. Glory. Amen. Keep his word. Amen. You can't follow Elijah and not keep his word or the Holy Spirit. However you want, but it all works together. You love the Lord. I'm only saying these things because I love everybody in Jesus. Y'all heard what I said. I said I want to see you there. I'm going to be there. That's all I'm saying, you know, because this life is not even worth it. Look at all those little kids that got killed there out there. All it takes is a moment. And I trust that somehow if you did not excuse me did not have the courage to come to the altar, I trust in your heart because it's later than what most people. You love the Lord. Let's just thank the Lord on that. Do y'all did you appreciate our precious brother? [Applause] The like there's a lot of message preachers preach the great mystery but they never preach a message [Music] that brings you to a sanctification. And you got to have it. Can't skip Luther. You can't skip. It was a restoration restoration tree, right? So you got to you got to understand you got to have a little bit of Luther, a little bit of western, a little bit of Pentecost in order to have Jesus himself. You can't step, you can't cross over the steps and that's what a lot of people in this have done. They trying to put a sinner in the headstone. That's true. I trust you understood what is that? No, I really don't feel like leaving. What's that song? I know y'all ready to go. Just kidding. All right, we we're gonna let him sing it if that's okay. Song leader coming. You can help me just, [Music] you know, I I get drunk in the Holy Ghost. Maybe you don't know I'm drunk, but I'm drunk. I enjoy Jesus just like that. And and let me say this, just the word grace ought to stir you up. Just think about what it really means. It ought to set you up. Every one of us know what we used to be. Every one of us know what we are now. And they not. Can I say it like this? Ain't nobody complain except you go by grace. [Music] Just a couple announcements before.
