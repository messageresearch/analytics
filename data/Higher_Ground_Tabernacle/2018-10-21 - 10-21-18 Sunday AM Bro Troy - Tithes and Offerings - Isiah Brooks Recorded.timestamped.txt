[0:16] read or preach message on tithes and
[0:20] offerings
[0:22] amen amen but it's really Bowl up
[0:25] there's a lot more to it than just
[0:27] tithes and offerings amens ice
[0:30] oh I struggled to put a title to this
[0:33] message because there's so much to it
[0:35] amen so let's let's turn order 1st
[0:38] Corinthians chapter 4 amen 1st
[0:45] corinthians chapter 4 we'll read from
[0:47] the sixth verse through the tenth verse
[0:52] and then from there we'll go to Genesis
[0:55] chapter 12 it says st. Paul speaking he
[1:03] says and these things brethren I having
[1:06] a figure transferred to myself and to
[1:09] Apollo's for your sake that you might
[1:12] learn in us not to think of men above
[1:14] that which is written that no one of you
[1:17] be puffed up for one against the other
[1:19] for what maketh thee to differ from
[1:22] another and what hast thou that thou
[1:26] didst not receive now if thou dis
[1:29] receive it why does thou glory as if
[1:32] thou has not received it now here full
[1:36] now you're rich you have reigned as
[1:39] kings without us and I would to God that
[1:41] ye did reign that we also might reign
[1:43] with you for I think that God has set us
[1:46] forth us Parcells apostles last as it
[1:50] were appointed to death
[1:51] for we are made a spectacle under the
[1:54] world and to angels into milk for we are
[1:57] fools for Christ's sake but year why is
[2:00] in Christ we are weak but ye are strong
[2:03] year honorable but we are despised amen
[2:08] us go to Genesis chapter 12
[2:23] you know God's patterns they do not
[2:25] change amen
[2:30] just as 12 will read the first through
[2:33] the third verse and says now the Lord
[2:38] had said unto Abram get thee out of thy
[2:41] country and from thy kindred and from
[2:44] thy father's house unto a land that I
[2:47] will show thee and I'll make of thee a
[2:50] great nation and I will bless thee and
[2:52] I'll make thy name great and thou shall
[2:54] be a blessing I'll bless them that bless
[2:57] thee and curse them that curse thee and
[2:59] in thee shall all the families of the
[3:02] earth be blessed
[3:04] let's just power has no word of Prayer
[3:06] Heavenly Father we just want to thank
[3:08] you Lord for for this day in this
[3:11] message door that you give unto us Lord
[3:13] Lord you have not left us without a
[3:15] witness Lord well here in our present
[3:17] day Lord you've given us a messenger
[3:19] father Lord you've given us a message
[3:22] that we could cling on cling ahold to
[3:25] Lord and for that we thank you father we
[3:27] thank you for all that you have done for
[3:28] us though for the patterns you've put in
[3:30] place for the systems and for the
[3:32] government's you've given to us Lord for
[3:34] the the ways that you have made us so we
[3:37] the supernatural beings here on the
[3:40] earth can come into a place and hear
[3:43] from you father Lauren we want to thank
[3:46] you for that for that ability father to
[3:49] hear from you Laura for you did not
[3:51] leave us alone
[3:52] you do not leave us without a witness
[3:53] but Lord you gave us your voice father
[3:56] and I just thank you Lord for all things
[3:58] and when we just turn this entire
[4:00] service over into your hands in the name
[4:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[4:05] amen god bless you can be seated amen so
[4:11] I just wanted to start off here with
[4:13] speaking about Abraham you know Abraham
[4:17] knows I I know I've testified several
[4:19] times about a man that was
[4:25] it's chastising me for believing on
[4:27] predestination one time as we were
[4:31] talking me in this me and this man and
[4:34] and I asked him I was like well you know
[4:38] he was talking about you know when do
[4:40] you get saved at what point you give you
[4:42] saved he didn't believe in
[4:43] predestination I said well when was
[4:46] Abraham saved you know and I just I like
[4:49] to think about that way because I'm a
[4:50] child of Abraham amen the Bible declares
[4:53] that I am a child of Abraham so however
[4:57] it was the Abraham got saved that must
[5:00] be the way that I got saved amen in the
[5:03] Bible you know the you know Abraham he
[5:05] didn't get saved when he met Macca's
[5:07] dick hey then he wasn't saved when he
[5:11] paid tithes to milk isn't it Amen he
[5:13] wasn't saved when he had a son Isaac he
[5:17] didn't he didn't become saved when when
[5:19] when God called him out of the Chaldees
[5:23] no but he was saved before the
[5:25] foundation of the world God had his hand
[5:28] upon his life amen and God had been
[5:31] watching that that seed gone down
[5:34] through generation and to generation and
[5:36] through generation amen all his father's
[5:39] before him had certain peculiarities but
[5:42] when it got to Abraham that blend became
[5:44] just right Amen God had a man upon the
[5:48] earth that had certain characteristics
[5:50] that could express something that God
[5:53] wanted to be expressed amen and God
[5:56] allowed that to come into you know
[5:58] everything that came from Abraham's
[6:01] mother and fragrance brother they all
[6:02] joined together in one body at one place
[6:05] at one time in the body of Abraham a man
[6:08] that had certain peculiarities that he
[6:11] could believe God and God carried to him
[6:14] as righteousness amen
[6:17] so now and I don't know what you know
[6:20] Abraham you know and he when God called
[6:22] him you know I think about says he's
[6:23] about 75 years old or whatever it was
[6:25] God called him out of ur of Chaldees and
[6:28] God called him out of his father's house
[6:30] amen
[6:32] but as soon as God called him his life
[6:34] was changed Amen I don't know how
[6:37] Abraham grew up
[6:39] I don't know what his what his childhood
[6:43] was like I don't know what he spent did
[6:46] the first 70 years of his life or so I
[6:48] do not know but I do know that all of a
[6:51] sudden at some point in time that God
[6:54] Himself came and started talking to him
[6:57] now that's a blessing not everybody in
[7:01] this world gets that Amen but for some
[7:04] reason there was something about Abraham
[7:07] that God was able to come down and parse
[7:10] through all the foolishness of the world
[7:12] around him all the false gods all the
[7:15] false worship services all the heathen
[7:17] traits God is able to part through that
[7:20] dark cloud and come down and speak
[7:22] directly to her hell
[7:25] that's a blessing Abraham was a blessed
[7:28] man because he was a man that God could
[7:31] speak to a man I trusted that the men
[7:36] and women here are the same caliber sons
[7:38] and daughters of Abraham a men who can
[7:41] have the foolishness of this world tip
[7:44] the clouds of Laodicea to be parted to
[7:46] where God can come down and speak to you
[7:50] amen it's a blessing to have God be able
[7:53] to speak to you did you know that God
[7:55] wants to speak to us God wants to be
[7:58] able to speak his word and haven't come
[8:01] down and come down through the sound
[8:03] waves into your ears and when it hits
[8:05] your ears your mind starts processing
[8:07] and the spirit within you receives it
[8:09] and says yes and amen
[8:11] and abraham believed God as in tributed
[8:14] it to him as righteousness amen
[8:18] attributed to his righteousness he
[8:21] believed the word of God and it was
[8:23] attributed to him as righteousness and
[8:26] you are now Abraham stinson daughter so
[8:29] therefore we must believe God and it's
[8:33] attributed to us as righteousness
[8:34] holiness how many would like to be
[8:37] righteous how many like to be white and
[8:39] pure upon that day a man whom we like to
[8:42] have their garments white was spotless
[8:44] without wrinkle without blemish a then
[8:47] on that day when he has come that's what
[8:49] he's coming he's coming for our bride
[8:51] des with our spa
[8:53] without Rico amen and when you believe
[8:55] the Word of God he attributes it to you
[8:58] as righteousness because you are a son
[9:01] daughter of Abraham what a blessing
[9:05] Amen what a blessing so Abraham when he
[9:08] received this call in Genesis chapter 12
[9:11] it changed his life he was a changed man
[9:16] he couldn't be what he was before he had
[9:21] to forsake all he forsook all now
[9:29] remember we're sons and daughters of
[9:30] Abraham amen now now a lot of people
[9:34] they try to this Christian journey and
[9:37] they want to see if they can you could
[9:41] do the Christian walk while holding on
[9:44] to the things of the pastor that's human
[9:47] nature amen that's not Abraham nature
[9:51] that's human nature
[9:52] amen human nature dictates that we will
[9:56] want to try to walk both paths at the
[9:59] same time human nature will want to try
[10:03] to serve God come to church while also
[10:08] holding a few things back so we could
[10:12] serve our our mind wants us to do that's
[10:17] human nature we haven't called to be
[10:19] humans we're not called we're not called
[10:21] to be humans God said that those that
[10:24] believe on his name - then he be gave
[10:27] power to become sons and daughters of
[10:30] God through the believing on his name
[10:33] if you receive power to become sons and
[10:36] daughters of God you have to reject
[10:39] being sons and daughters of the flesh a
[10:42] meant to be a son or daughter of Abraham
[10:45] you have to reject being the son or
[10:47] daughter of the human race amen
[10:51] so Abraham forsook all and he started
[10:54] wandering now now remember he had an
[10:56] inheritance of his father he had an
[10:59] inheritance of his father well he had to
[11:03] forsake that inheritance amen he forsook
[11:06] all he had to
[11:07] leave things behind he had to leave
[11:09] behind things behind that he had seen
[11:12] other men receive inheritances from
[11:14] their father he knew in his mind that as
[11:17] men get old they die and they leave
[11:20] whatever they have possessed throughout
[11:22] their life whether it be Hertz or land
[11:26] or gold or silver or wherever it is that
[11:29] they passed down that those children
[11:31] would get that inheritance from their
[11:35] father amens but Abraham as he was due
[11:38] to get an inheritance from his father
[11:41] Terah forsook all of his inheritance and
[11:46] followed after the word of Jesus Christ
[11:49] because he can't because he was given a
[11:52] promise of a better inheritance and so
[11:56] when he saw that there is he took the
[11:57] two inheritances the inheritance of his
[12:00] father Terah and the inheritance of his
[12:04] creator Jehovah and he counted the
[12:09] inheritance of his father Jehovah to be
[12:11] greater the inheritance of his father
[12:15] terribly
[12:15] a man so he rejected the one and
[12:18] followed after that and he left his
[12:21] father's household behind and he
[12:24] believed on the Lord Jesus Christ he
[12:26] believed on the word of Jehovah
[12:27] he believed on the name of Jehovah and
[12:30] was attributed unto him as righteousness
[12:32] he received the inheritance that
[12:35] righteousness became was the was the was
[12:39] the seal of his inheritance amen it was
[12:43] given to him as a nerts
[12:44] when he gained that righteousness
[12:45] everything else was coming right along
[12:48] amen amen he forsook all now remember he
[12:53] was quite away he became poor so he
[12:55] might become rich the Bible says a
[12:59] little bit later on that when when
[13:00] Abraham came into the promised land and
[13:03] God said wherever you tread upon this is
[13:05] all yours
[13:06] amen remember that there was a drought
[13:08] in the land and he was driven down to
[13:11] Egypt for a period of time and when he
[13:13] came back he was a Bible said as he was
[13:15] a rich man and then he was a rich man he
[13:19] had all kinds of her
[13:21] cattle and sheep amen he had gold and
[13:25] silver he had men servants women
[13:28] servants he had a large entourage that
[13:30] followed him amen when Abraham came into
[13:33] town it wasn't just him it was an entire
[13:36] city that came with a man entire camp of
[13:41] of these nomads that were going about
[13:44] the land because they knew this was
[13:45] their land
[13:46] amen and there go from place to place
[13:48] this is our land
[13:51] amen and so when Abraham came to town he
[13:54] came to town with a lot of stuff
[13:55] amen why because the Bible says he had
[13:58] become a rich man amen he had been rich
[14:01] he became poor he forsook all and but
[14:05] his his real father
[14:07] Jehovah gave him an inheritance that was
[14:10] greater than all amen now and now
[14:13] remember the November because because he
[14:16] forsook all he first took all the traits
[14:19] of his father they meant his father
[14:22] worshiped idols right he forsook all
[14:25] that he forsook all the traits of his
[14:27] father he first sucked all the all of
[14:30] his past and received the traits of his
[14:32] new father the Creator Jehovah there
[14:35] wasn't his new father BOE's revealed
[14:37] unto him that this was his father
[14:40] amen it was revealed unto Abraham that
[14:43] joy that Jehovah was his creator and was
[14:46] his father amen and he forsook all to
[14:49] follow after that amen and now by that
[14:52] he started displaying the attributes of
[14:56] his father Jehovah Amen so when his
[14:58] brother lot was captured how he
[15:01] remembers the story
[15:02] amen amen the the the his the his
[15:06] brother lot was captured him and all his
[15:09] family and they were taken off to a
[15:11] far-off country and Abraham says I'm
[15:13] going after amen
[15:16] and so he goes he goes and he goes he
[15:18] gives his three hundred of his servants
[15:21] weapons and they go and they follow
[15:23] after a lot and they're gonna save him
[15:25] they're gonna deliver amen and they're
[15:28] gonna bring him back safely a man to
[15:31] where he can live in peace and what was
[15:33] he doing he's explained the split
[15:35] the attributes of his father the
[15:36] attributes of his father had been given
[15:39] unto him as an inheritance and now he's
[15:41] beginning to enjoy his new inheritance
[15:46] amen
[15:47] these are the attributes of his new
[15:50] inheritance and now he's going to
[15:51] explain its Christ and Abraham a man
[15:55] Christ was in Abraham revealing himself
[15:58] by going after his lost brother amen so
[16:01] when when Abraham leaves the Promised
[16:04] Land goes after and saves his brother
[16:06] lot and brings him back remember how
[16:09] many King was down with him it was a you
[16:12] know five or ten kings or whatever it
[16:14] was went down with him and they fought
[16:16] the battle and when they came back the
[16:19] king of Sodom was there and all the
[16:22] other kings around about were there and
[16:23] when they came back there was they won
[16:28] the battle they had won the war and
[16:29] there were certain spoils
[16:31] there was rewards that they're ready to
[16:34] be given out amen and and the king of
[16:38] Sodom offered some of this unto Abraham
[16:41] and Abraham says I don't want I don't
[16:45] want anything that you got amen I don't
[16:47] want anything to do with Sodom I don't
[16:49] want any Asad and stuff amen and as soon
[16:53] as Abraham rejected the things of Sodom
[16:56] God no kids that came and met him on the
[16:59] scene amen and we after after the battle
[17:02] was over after he'd forsaken all after
[17:05] Sodom came back tried to offer her a
[17:07] reward he rejected the reward all
[17:10] suddenly he received a visitation of
[17:12] milk as a deck God was visiting amen now
[17:17] remember we're children of Abraham amen
[17:21] we're children of Abraham now remember
[17:24] he is the same yesterday today and
[17:27] forever
[17:29] and if our father Abraham received a
[17:33] visitation then we're doing a visitation
[17:38] it's our inheritance don't you see that
[17:42] is our inheritance we are doing it
[17:49] belongs to us as part of our inheritance
[17:52] it came with the package so we can't
[17:56] just sit there and and say boy I wish I
[17:59] could be like brother so-and-so I wish I
[18:01] could be like sister so-and-so
[18:02] no you have your own inheritance it's
[18:06] due unto you you are to commune with
[18:09] your father it belongs to you as an
[18:11] inheritance remember after the battle
[18:14] was over what did he do
[18:15] Abraham Abraham had to forsake all a man
[18:19] this is a reward of forsaking all as you
[18:22] receive a visitation mirror these
[18:25] patterns don't change hey man what'd he
[18:28] do he had received a call to leave his
[18:31] father's house and he left all he came
[18:35] into the Promised Land and the world
[18:37] offered him more he rejected everything
[18:40] of Sodom amen and so what did he do he
[18:44] received a visitation of Melchizedek and
[18:47] Milt is like that came and bless him and
[18:50] gave him Communion and there's something
[18:52] about that when you receive a revelation
[18:54] like that it caused him to talk it
[19:01] caused him to give his tidy amen I think
[19:05] about when he met when he received the
[19:07] visitation of milk Ezek he says the
[19:10] bible says he gave unto milk azdak a
[19:12] tenth of all and we are booked his next
[19:18] amen oh we're receiving a visitation
[19:20] you're receiving a visitation right now
[19:22] amen God said that he would speak his
[19:25] word to you he said I'll give unto you
[19:28] pastors teachers evangelists prophets
[19:32] apostles a meant a ministry for the
[19:37] perfecting of the saints so that you can
[19:39] come unto the unity of one body amen and
[19:43] that body will tithe on the dough why
[19:46] will she tile into job because she's
[19:49] received the visitation man amen
[19:52] what where did the Bride of Christ
[19:53] receive she received a calling out from
[19:56] the world she was called to be out
[19:59] separated from the world separated from
[20:02] all
[20:02] things separate from all the sins and
[20:05] foolishness of this world separated from
[20:08] the front from the foolishness of Sodom
[20:11] separated from Babylon we are calling
[20:14] out of that and what do we do we answer
[20:16] the call here we are and we've had a
[20:19] battle we've had a fight without a
[20:22] battle and what do we do we rejected the
[20:24] things of this world and we received
[20:27] Jesus Christ amen now now that we've
[20:32] received Jesus Christ what does he do he
[20:35] visits us he gives us a visitation he
[20:38] preaches his word to us amen as he
[20:42] preaches his word to us through the
[20:44] fivefold ministry then amen and what do
[20:47] we do he's visiting us every Sunday and
[20:49] every Wednesday Torre do we bring our
[20:52] tithes in a place the visitation amen
[20:57] hey man let's turn over to Genesis 14
[21:18] guess is 14 verse 17 that says and the
[21:26] king of Sodom went out to meet him after
[21:28] his return from the slaughter of
[21:30] chedorlaomer and of the kings that were
[21:33] with him at the vet at the ballet of
[21:35] Shiva which is the Kings Dale and milk
[21:38] his act the king of Salem brought forth
[21:41] bread and wine and he was the priest of
[21:43] the Most High God well as milk Ezek
[21:45] doing he's coming to his victors amen
[21:50] they fought the battle and he's coming
[21:53] to the victor Amen the one that won the
[21:55] victory over the world they meant and
[21:58] and his lament has neck says he blessed
[22:02] him and he said blessed be Abraham Abram
[22:05] of the Most High God possessor of heaven
[22:07] and earth I wonder if Abraham knew he
[22:11] was possessor of heaven
[22:13] that is quite an inheritance I think
[22:19] about who is milk his neck this Jesus
[22:25] Christ it's God Almighty in the flesh
[22:28] and he is now declaring unto his son his
[22:32] child you are the possessor of heaven
[22:35] and earth I don't know if Abraham knew
[22:38] this at that before this moment I don't
[22:41] know if this may have been the first
[22:43] time now he knew the guy gave him the
[22:46] land amen
[22:48] he knew that God had given him a place
[22:50] but now all of a sudden blessed be Abram
[22:53] now I remember just a few more verses
[22:55] from here God's gonna take him out he's
[22:57] God's gonna visit him another time is he
[23:00] coming to the tent where he's dwelling
[23:01] he's gonna grab him by the hand and lead
[23:04] him outside the tent door and he says
[23:06] Abraham I want to show you something and
[23:08] he says I want you to look at the Stars
[23:10] and if you can count them you can count
[23:14] how great your children will be I think
[23:18] about that that's just a few verses from
[23:20] here so eight so milk his neck meets him
[23:24] there after the battle is over and he
[23:26] says unto Abram the Most High God
[23:28] blessed be Abram of the Most High God
[23:31] he's not Abram of Terah amen he's not
[23:35] Abram of Adam and Eve but he's Abram of
[23:38] came out of come out from Abram the son
[23:42] of the Most High God amen a Nissi is the
[23:46] heir the possessor of heaven and earth
[23:51] Abraham has become a child of God a son
[23:56] of God an heir of God there's something
[24:00] about that revelation if you could ever
[24:04] get that revelation of who you are
[24:07] amen of who you are that you are not
[24:10] just a child of your parents but you are
[24:13] a son or a daughter of the Most High God
[24:15] and you're the possessor of heaven and
[24:18] earth
[24:19] that is given unto the children of
[24:21] Abraham we have become the possessors of
[24:25] heaven and of Earth amen
[24:29] we are living here in this natural world
[24:32] in the world but not of the world amen
[24:35] amen and we have been given certain
[24:38] abilities a certain inheritance that we
[24:41] are not just natural children but our
[24:43] inheritance is of the supernatural amen
[24:47] which wish which conquers all natural
[24:50] things
[24:50] amen we've been given a supernatural
[24:53] inheritance because we have become we
[24:55] have been given the power to become the
[24:57] sons and daughters of God and when
[24:59] Abraham received that revelation it
[25:02] costs him to get his timing they drove
[25:07] him to give tithing and the Bible says
[25:10] that and Abraham gave him the revelation
[25:16] was so great why now why did he give a
[25:18] tenth of all we're gonna get down to
[25:19] that in a little bit here there's
[25:22] something about that revelation that
[25:24] caused him to give a tenth of all let's
[25:27] go over to let's turn to mark 10 mark 10
[25:49] the seventeenth verse and it says and
[26:06] when he was gone forth into the way
[26:08] there came one running and kneeled to
[26:11] him and asked him good master what shall
[26:15] I do that I may inherit eternal life you
[26:19] know as many that do this same thing
[26:20] they come running to the Lord Jesus
[26:23] Christ they all kneel at an altar before
[26:26] him and ask for eternal life
[26:32] amen but you know this man did not get
[26:35] what he was looking for this man never
[26:38] received what he was looking for now
[26:40] let's find out why did he not receive
[26:42] what he was looking for good master what
[26:47] shall I do that I may inherit eternal
[26:50] life and Jesus send him why callest thou
[26:53] me good there is none good but one that
[26:56] is God thou knowest the commandments do
[26:59] not commit adultery do not kill do not
[27:01] steal do not bear false witness defraud
[27:03] not honour thy father and thy mother and
[27:06] he answered and said don't master all of
[27:08] these things I have observed for my
[27:10] youth and jesus beholding him loved him
[27:15] what's Jesus doing he's looking down
[27:18] into his spirit looking down into a soul
[27:21] seeing what is lacking he loves him he
[27:24] find he's finding out where the trouble
[27:26] is right talking with him a little bit
[27:29] they find out where the trouble is amen
[27:32] and here he finds out what the trouble
[27:35] is and he speaks right to that trouble
[27:37] he says one thing thou lackest what is
[27:41] he lacking he's lacking something
[27:43] they're given the ability to enter into
[27:46] eternal life one thing thou lackest go
[27:51] thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and
[27:54] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[27:57] treasure in heaven and come take up the
[28:00] cross and follow me he would become a
[28:02] possessor of heaven and earth he said
[28:05] you will have treasure in heaven right
[28:07] he's given him the opportunity to have
[28:10] treasure in heaven and in the earth amen
[28:14] take up the cross and follow me by
[28:17] forsaking all he will be following after
[28:20] he's run out in this flesh he was a son
[28:23] of Abraham but when he was called to do
[28:28] the same thing Abraham did he said oh oh
[28:32] I can't do what my father Abraham did I
[28:38] can't forsake all I can't do it no
[28:44] no you want me to force a call now his
[28:47] father Abraham forsook all and he was
[28:49] declaring that when he was circumcised
[28:51] he was declaring that he was the son of
[28:53] Abraham but now it comes down to the
[28:56] boiling point are you really a son of
[28:58] Abraham or not a son of Abraham no I'm
[29:05] not a son of Abraham no not a son of
[29:10] Abraham one thing thou lackest
[29:17] go thy way and sell whatsoever thou hast
[29:20] and give to the poor and thou shalt have
[29:23] treasure in heaven and come and take up
[29:26] the cross and follow me
[29:28] verse 22 and he was sad at that sing and
[29:32] went away grieved for he had great
[29:35] possessions and Jesus looked around
[29:38] about and said unto his disciples how
[29:40] hardly shall they that have riches enter
[29:44] into the kingdom of God and as disciples
[29:47] were astonished his words but jesus
[29:49] answered again and said unto them
[29:51] children how hard it is for them that
[29:54] trust in riches to enter into the
[29:57] kingdom of God now think about it it
[29:59] wasn't necessary that he had riches it
[30:02] was that he was trusting and his riches
[30:05] amen Abraham didn't trust in his riches
[30:07] he forsook all God gave him his riches
[30:11] amen
[30:12] it is easier for a camel to go through
[30:16] the eye of a needle than for a rich man
[30:18] to enter into the kingdom of God why
[30:20] because they will trust in their riches
[30:24] amen
[30:25] let's go down to verse 28 then Peter
[30:30] began to say unto Him lo we have left
[30:33] all and followed thee and jesus answered
[30:37] and said verily I say to you there is no
[30:39] man hath left house or brethren or
[30:42] sisters or father or mother or wife or
[30:45] children or lands for my sake and the
[30:48] gospel's but he shall receive a
[30:50] hundredfold now in this fashion he shall
[30:53] receive a hundredfold now in this time
[30:57] houses brethren sisters mothers children
[31:01] lands with persecutions and the world to
[31:04] come eternal life but many that are
[31:09] first shall be last and the last first
[31:13] amen he would not become a son of
[31:16] Abraham now Jesus Christ is the same
[31:19] yesterday today and forever
[31:21] he changes snot you know there was
[31:23] another man by the name of Zacchaeus who
[31:26] is also a rich man God did not call him
[31:30] to give up everything no but when Zach
[31:32] he when Jesus said to Zacchaeus come
[31:34] down out of that tree for I must sup
[31:37] with you that night
[31:38] and when Zacchaeus was sitting at the
[31:40] supper and the joy of the Lord became
[31:42] his strength he said lo Lord 1/2 that I
[31:46] have I give unto the poor and if I have
[31:48] defrauded anyone I'll give restore to
[31:50] them for full and God did not tell them
[31:53] no no no hat's not good enough you you
[31:55] have to give it all now now the rich
[31:58] young ruler had to give all but
[32:00] Zacchaeus only had to give hat what was
[32:03] it it was not the amount that they gave
[32:05] but as a fact that they are testifying
[32:07] unto the Lord Jesus Christ I am not
[32:10] trusting in my riches I am trusting in
[32:12] Jehovah I am trusting in the one I have
[32:15] lifted my hand unto Jehovah Amen now now
[32:18] let's go back to Genesis 12 Genesis 14
[32:24] [Music]
[32:28] amen now where maquette or Melchizedek
[32:31] is meeting him after the battle Genesis
[32:35] 14 and then eighteenth verse it says and
[32:38] milk isn't it king of Salem brought
[32:42] forth bread and wine and he was the
[32:44] priest of the Most High God that's what
[32:47] he was this is milk his next British
[32:49] physician he was the priest of the Most
[32:52] High God amen
[32:54] and he said he blessed and it said
[32:56] blessed be Abram the mode of the Most
[32:58] High God possessor of heaven and earth
[33:01] amen and he blessed the Most High God
[33:05] which had delivered thine enemies into a
[33:08] hand and he gave him tithes of
[33:11] all amen Abraham gave tithe on the milk
[33:14] is heaven amen and the king of Sodom
[33:17] sent Abram give me the persons and take
[33:20] the goods to thyself these are the goods
[33:22] that originally belonged to these other
[33:24] kings Sodom and all the other kings and
[33:27] now they're being offered unto Abraham
[33:29] that you can have these as your own and
[33:31] Abraham said in verse 22 and Abraham
[33:34] said to the king of Sodom
[33:35] I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah
[33:39] unto the Lord the Most High God and the
[33:43] possessor of heaven and earth and that I
[33:45] will not take from a thread even to a
[33:48] shoe latchet from you and and that I
[33:50] will not take anything that is done lest
[33:53] you should say that I have made abram
[33:55] rich amen and then at verse 51 and after
[34:01] these things the word of the Lord came
[34:02] and Abraham in a vision
[34:04] fear not Abraham I am thy shield and I
[34:07] exceeding great reward after he had he
[34:11] forsook everything he has offered the
[34:14] riches of the world he rejected them he
[34:17] said and he declared unto the world
[34:19] I have lifted my hand unto Jehovah unto
[34:23] him I tie they give a tenth of all and
[34:25] he is mine he has made me the possessor
[34:27] of heaven if a man that is our testimony
[34:30] yes we testify that unto saw him amen
[34:34] amen they after that and the neighbor
[34:36] had said Lord what will thou do the
[34:38] scene I am childless
[34:40] amen and you have given me a no seed and
[34:42] then what inverse son
[34:47] we're not get over that part but it's
[34:51] later on we're where God leads him out
[34:53] of ten says look I want you to look up
[34:56] you see the stars of heaven that is your
[34:59] inheritance
[35:00] amen amen he forsook all he forsook
[35:04] Saudi you know the rich young ruler was
[35:07] given an opportunity to declare that he
[35:10] was a son of Abraham he wouldn't do it
[35:12] amen even so we are given our
[35:15] opportunity to declare that we are the
[35:17] sons and daughters of Abraham when were
[35:19] we saved well he wrote our book upon the
[35:23] Lamb's Book of Life
[35:24] what do we do we receive a call come out
[35:27] of her my people the ER not partakers of
[35:29] her sins and we reject mr. Babylon we
[35:33] reject all the riches of mr. Babylon
[35:35] amen you don't have to necessarily sell
[35:37] our you have but you cannot put your
[35:39] trust in your riches amen and when you
[35:42] reject tithes and offerings you are
[35:45] trusting in your riches more than you
[35:48] are trusting in Jehovah your God
[35:51] Wayne us when a person who declares when
[35:55] someone declares that they are the son
[35:57] of Abraham the son of the Most High God
[35:59] but refuses to do the things that
[36:02] Abraham did you're bearing false witness
[36:05] of your own testimony they meant if you
[36:09] do not bring tithes and offerings like
[36:12] your father Abraham did then you were
[36:13] bearing false witness of your own
[36:15] testimony amen now let's let's go that
[36:20] was the revelation of Abraham that's
[36:22] supposed to be our revelation let's go
[36:25] over to our numbers chapter 18 how do we
[36:41] pay our tithe amen where is Melchizedek
[36:48] [Music]
[36:55] where is Melchizedek hey how do we pay
[36:59] tithes to
[37:08] numbers chapter 18 verse 20 this is
[37:14] speaking to Aaron and also do about the
[37:17] Levites remember they were the priests
[37:19] when the when the children of Israel
[37:23] left Egypt and they came coming back to
[37:25] the promised land God gave a Porsche
[37:28] took a tithing of the people and gave
[37:31] them reserve them unto himself God
[37:33] always wants a portion reserved unto
[37:36] himself a mint so he took a portion of
[37:39] the people and reserve the sons of Aaron
[37:41] and the sons of and the sons of Levi and
[37:44] gave them unto himself they were his
[37:47] verse 20 and the Lord spake unto Aaron
[37:50] thou shalt have no inheritance in their
[37:54] land no inheritance now Abraham was a
[37:58] son of Abraham he was to be possessor of
[38:01] heaven and earth but now the Lord is
[38:05] speaking unto Aaron and saying you will
[38:08] have no inheritance in the very place
[38:12] where I said you would have an
[38:13] inheritance that's a sacrifice that is a
[38:19] sacrifice you know Aaron Aaron giving up
[38:23] isn't by it being a child of Abraham he
[38:26] was to be possessor of heaven and earth
[38:28] and wants to have the inheritance of
[38:30] that land and Aaron forsook that
[38:33] inheritance to serve Jehovah that's
[38:38] given right here
[38:39] he forsook that inheritance he had a
[38:42] right to that land amen they meant Aaron
[38:45] had her right to the promised land he
[38:48] had a right to have crops raised a
[38:51] family he had a right to that he gave
[38:56] that up to be obedient to the oval Amen
[39:00] let's read that again and the Lord spake
[39:03] unto Aaron thou shall have no
[39:05] inheritance in their land neither shall
[39:09] you have any part among them and he says
[39:13] I am thy part and thine inheritance
[39:16] among the children visitor
[39:19] that's an okay trade-off amen that's
[39:23] quite a trade-off I can I can I can do
[39:26] that I can give up the land yup as long
[39:29] as you're with me Lord well as long as
[39:31] you're with me Lord that's okay as long
[39:34] as as long as you're with me just don't
[39:36] leave me Lord that's okay
[39:38] amen and behold verse 21 and behold I
[39:42] have given the churn of Levi all the
[39:44] tenth in Israel for an inheritance for
[39:47] their service which they serve even in
[39:50] the service of the tabernacle of the
[39:52] congregation so they do have an
[39:54] inheritance their inheritance is the
[39:58] title Aaron and his sons and the Levites
[40:02] their inheritance is the tithing name
[40:05] and it belongs to them who gave it to
[40:07] him it wasn't you that's right it was
[40:10] God gave God took away their inheritance
[40:15] out of the land their portion of the
[40:18] physical land and their took it out away
[40:21] he called them to serve Him and because
[40:25] of that sacrifice he gave unto them the
[40:28] tenth of his children the children
[40:32] Israel and if you are his children then
[40:37] your tithing belongs to the ministry and
[40:40] if you reject that then you are it's
[40:43] doing the same thing that rich young
[40:44] ruler did and you're trusting in your
[40:46] riches instead of trusting in the Most
[40:51] High God possessor of heaven and earth
[40:53] you see where we stand yes
[40:57] that's where we stand and then that is
[41:00] that is how important tithing is you
[41:04] know brother Bram said that there that
[41:07] every proper service they must have an
[41:10] offering in order for it to be a
[41:12] complete church service the offering has
[41:15] to be taken up a mint that's why we take
[41:19] up the offer that's why we bring our
[41:21] tithing in why the brother brand said
[41:23] that is not a full and complete service
[41:27] church service unless the offering is
[41:29] taken up that's why we
[41:32] sebastien a meant to be to give honor
[41:35] unto our Lord to be obedient to his call
[41:38] what to give our tithing unto the
[41:39] ministry where we where the God meets us
[41:42] where his word comes forth that now
[41:44] who's speaking right now I did not come
[41:46] up with this message by myself in order
[41:51] for me to come up with this message I
[41:55] you know what had to happen
[41:58] I had to quiet myself before the Lord so
[42:03] why because I cuz I have a fear that I
[42:06] might come up here and speak my own
[42:09] thoughts and that's a great fear that
[42:12] every true minister has there is always
[42:15] this fear that somehow someway you might
[42:18] speak your own thoughts and not his
[42:20] thoughts and that is what we have to be
[42:22] careful about always making sure Lord is
[42:24] this from you or I just want to say what
[42:26] you I don't write anything down in my
[42:28] notes less I feel led to I learned that
[42:30] lesson when I first start preaching that
[42:32] if I if I write down some nifty thing
[42:35] that I read somewhere hurts somewhere
[42:36] like that could be neat that very thing
[42:38] will stumble me when I get up here I
[42:40] have to only write down things in my
[42:42] notes that he gives me amen amen
[42:46] so what is it as part of the ministry
[42:48] that's so so you then you're not here to
[42:51] listen to me because I'm not worth
[42:53] listening to you're here to listen to
[42:55] him amen so when you give tithing you're
[42:58] not giving your tithing necessary to
[43:00] meet you give it to him but that
[43:03] inheritance is to the pulpit is to the
[43:06] work is to the ministry amen amen now
[43:16] let's keep going we read let's read
[43:20] again for verse 21 and behold I've given
[43:23] the children of Levi all the tenth in
[43:25] Israel for an inheritance for their
[43:27] service which they served even the
[43:30] service of the tabernacle of the
[43:31] congregation neither must the Chum of
[43:34] Israel henceforth come nigh to the
[43:36] tabernacle the congregation lest they
[43:38] bear sin and die amen
[43:40] but the Levites shall do the service of
[43:43] the tabernacle of the congregation and
[43:44] they shall bear their
[43:46] we shall be a statute forever throughout
[43:48] your generations and among the children
[43:50] of Israel that they have no inheritance
[43:54] but the tithes of the children of Israel
[43:56] which they offer as a heave offering
[43:59] unto the Lord I have given to the
[44:01] Levites to inherit therefore I have said
[44:04] unto them among the turn of Israel they
[44:06] shall have no inheritance so when you
[44:10] bring your ties and your offerings into
[44:12] the house of the Lord you were bringing
[44:14] a heave offering unto the Lord amen and
[44:17] you give it unto Jesus Christ the one
[44:20] that called you the one that saved you
[44:22] the one that made you a possessor of
[44:24] heaven earth and what do you do you are
[44:26] forsaking all your testifying I am a son
[44:28] of Abraham I am not trusting in my
[44:31] riches but I have not trouble it I'm not
[44:33] trusting in the riches of Sodom but I
[44:35] have lifted my hand under Most High God
[44:37] possessor of heaven and earth and I am
[44:39] giving my off reading in my ties under
[44:41] lore as the heave offering and God
[44:43] reciprocates and gives that back to the
[44:45] ministry as their inheritance for their
[44:50] sacrifice in their service where they
[44:52] gave up you know brother Isaiah went to
[44:55] college brother Isaiah was in the Air
[44:59] Force he had an opportunity you know in
[45:03] the hotel business I had an opportunity
[45:06] in the Air Force
[45:07] yet he forsook all amen amen
[45:12] he forsook all for the ministry
[45:16] amen and we we have seen the fruits of
[45:20] his ministry his ministry has come with
[45:23] fruits a man it's not he has a in his
[45:26] ministry has been properly vindicated
[45:30] amen
[45:31] that he is part of the fivefold ministry
[45:33] amen and so when we come into this house
[45:36] we are expecting to draw from that
[45:39] ministry that's why we come here why
[45:42] because God has called us a man he said
[45:44] that to assemble yourselves the more as
[45:47] you see the Day approaching
[45:48] amen and so we do we assemble into this
[45:51] room expecting to hear the voice of God
[45:54] through a vessel that has been called
[45:57] has been set apart
[45:58] he has been shown
[46:00] a part of the fivefold ministry amen and
[46:03] he has given up his his rights in this
[46:06] land he has given up the American dream
[46:08] as we say he has given that up the the
[46:11] chance to develop his career amen and he
[46:14] has given all rejected all that Andres
[46:17] tend to to live according to the
[46:19] Ministry of the gospel and God has
[46:24] reciprocated that minute that that
[46:26] sacrifice by giving him an inheritance
[46:29] not just a supernatural inheritance but
[46:33] a natural inheritance God has given unto
[46:36] brother Isaiah you were tight God gave
[46:42] it to him now what happens if you hold
[46:45] back your tithing you are a robber
[46:53] because God gave that to the ministry
[46:56] here as a gift and we hold back your
[46:59] tithing you are not robbing man you are
[47:03] robbing God and you're not tenta you're
[47:07] testifying that you're not a son or
[47:08] daughter of Abraham which is the only
[47:11] way that we can be safe my this is a
[47:16] serious thing amen this is a serious
[47:19] thing you must this is part of the
[47:21] church service this is part of the
[47:22] service you must bring your tithes and
[47:24] offerings under the Lord head amen amen
[47:31] now let's turn over to Ephesians chapter
[47:34] 4
[47:38] [Applause]
[47:47] Pease in chapter 4 verse 8 right and it
[47:58] says wherefore he saith when he ascended
[48:01] up on high that's Jesus when Jesus
[48:03] ascended when he ascended up on high he
[48:07] led captivity captive wasn't that nice
[48:10] of them amen aren't you glad he did that
[48:14] he led captivity captive we don't have
[48:17] to be bound why we became become the
[48:21] possessor of heaven earth by the actions
[48:25] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[48:26] he has laid the paths that we might
[48:29] become possessors of heaven earth he led
[48:31] captivity captive we don't have to be
[48:33] captive say Amen we've been set free
[48:35] we're not bound amen so as he ascended
[48:43] he led captivity captive he took it away
[48:46] from us amen amen the Bible says he
[48:50] rebuked the devourer for our sakes amen
[48:53] as Satan came to kill steal and destroy
[48:56] seeking whom he may devour
[48:58] so he led captivity captive but also as
[49:02] he was ascending what did he do he came
[49:05] he gave back gifts unto men that was on
[49:11] the day of Pentecost that's when it
[49:13] started how did he do it he sent the
[49:16] Holy Ghost

[49:47] apostles some prophets and some
[49:51] evangelists and some pastors and
[49:54] teachers why'd he give these gifts for

[50:04] the sons and daughters of Abraham he

[52:00] speaking out now that comes to every one
[52:02] of us amen but we've been given a power
[52:05] that is to make us overcomers of all
[52:08] that amen but speaking the truth in love

[53:05] write our tithe check and we Rob God
[53:08] when we don't

[53:24] chapter 3 I got about a few more
[53:28] scriptures here to go through we want to
[53:35] be obedient you know there's fear
[53:36] there's blessings and obedience that
[53:43] cannot be measured blessings and
[53:49] obedience I cannot be measured amen
[53:52] Malachi chapter 3 verse 8 it says will a
[53:58] man Rob God are you thankful how could
[54:02] that be
[54:03] how can a man Rob God how is it possible
[54:08] yet ye have robbed me no they didn't rob
[54:11] the Levites they didn't rob the house
[54:15] the sons of Aaron they robbed God how
[54:18] did they rob God they stole something
[54:20] from God why because God was
[54:23] transferring a gift from himself unto
[54:25] the Levites through you and
[54:28] you grabbed a hold of it trusting in
[54:30] your riches declaring that you're not a
[54:32] son or daughter of Abraham and held it
[54:34] back Robbie go but ye say wherein have
[54:41] we robbed thee and G and God says in
[54:44] tithes and offerings ye are cursed with
[54:49] a curse for ye have robbed me even this
[54:52] whole nation so because they robbed God
[54:55] they were cursed with the curt's Wow
[54:58] this is serious this is really serious
[55:03] this is no joke we gotta be sons and
[55:06] daughters of Abraham yeah why we've been
[55:08] called we know we don't want to go back

[55:17] into the one that saved us bring me all
[55:24] the tithes into the storehouse that
[55:28] there may be meat in mine house and
[55:29] prove me now herewith says Lord if I
[55:33] will not open you the windows of heaven
[55:35] and pour you out a blessing and there
[55:38] shall not be room enough to receive it
[55:40] and furthermore and I will rebuke the
[55:44] Devourer for your sake and he shall not
[55:48] destroy the fruit of your ground
[55:49] neither shall your vine casts our fruit
[55:51] before the time in the field saith the
[55:55] Lord of hosts and all nations shall call
[55:56] you a blessing call you blessed for you
[55:59] should be a delight some land saith the
[56:01] Lord amen I will rebuke the Devourer for
[56:06] your sakes amen
[56:09] now what is Satan do he comes to kill
[56:11] steal and destroy he has come to what he
[56:15] is he has gone forth Satan himself as
[56:19] God forth as a lion as a lion seeking
[56:23] whom he may devour amen he has come by
[56:27] your house he was in your house too
[56:30] sweet the lion was coming by your house
[56:32] this week what was he doing he is
[56:35] looking at who he could devour a man but
[56:37] God said I will rebuke the Devourer for
[56:41] your
[56:41] so the he wanna touch your house why
[56:44] would it if you will pay your tithes
[56:46] under the ministry now I thought peut
[56:52] rise is just a natural thing we did or
[56:54] just a tradition or something like that
[56:57] I thought was optional a lot of people
[57:00] think it's optional
[57:03] amen would you like to devour to be
[57:05] rebuked a man wouldn't you like that
[57:07] wouldn't you like to not have to fight
[57:09] the lion by yourself
[57:10] Luther wants to fight a lion with your
[57:13] bare hands
[57:13] oh you're now the Lions coming amen he's
[57:18] coming to your house the lion is coming
[57:21] to your door but he can be rebuked right

[57:31] the Devourer for your sakes and he will
[57:33] not destroy the fruits of your ground
[57:36] you're gonna be blessed amen
[57:40] now I mean that in a Pentecostal
[57:42] domination away amen let's turn over to
[57:48] Deuteronomy chapter 12 I would encourage
[58:03] all of you to read this entire chapter
[58:06] we won't do it today

[58:20] Deuteronomy chapter 12 these are the
[58:26] statutes and judgments which he shall
[58:28] observe to do and all the land in the
[58:31] land which the Lord God of thy father's
[58:33] giveth thee to possess it all the days
[58:36] that you shall live upon the earth
[58:38] they many may hear living upon the earth
[58:40] amen
[58:41] you shall utterly destroy all the places
[58:44] wherein the nation's that ye shall
[58:45] possess serve their gods amen and upon
[58:49] all the high mountains upon the hills
[58:51] and under every Green Tree ye shall
[58:53] overthrow the
[58:54] alters he shall break their pillars burn
[58:58] down their groves with fire he shall hew
[59:01] down the graven images of their gods and
[59:03] he shall destroy the names of them out
[59:06] of that place
[59:09] amen we've all been called to do that in
[59:13] our own land when you are called to
[59:16] serve Jehovah you have to forsake all
[59:19] and burn down all the things you used to
[59:22] worship cue down the trees were used to
[59:25] worship and forsake all this if you used
[59:27] to worship your riches or sports or
[59:30] where all is you've got a shoe all that
[59:32] down forsake all to serve them and all
[59:37] the names of them out of your life amen
[59:43] and you shall not serve God like that
[59:45] amen verse 7 verse 4 you shall not do so
[59:48] under the Lord your God but unto the
[59:50] place which the Lord your God shall
[59:52] choose have all of your tribes to put
[59:55] his name there even unto his habitation
[59:58] shall you see and thither shalt thou
[1:00:01] come and thither he shall bring your
[1:00:04] burnt offerings and your sacrifices and
[1:00:07] your tithes and your heave offering of
[1:00:09] your hand and your vows and your
[1:00:12] freewill offerings and the firstlings of
[1:00:14] your herds and of your flocks and there
[1:00:17] now watch verse 6 that says and thither
[1:00:20] verse 7 says and there that means you're
[1:00:23] going somewhere where are you going
[1:00:26] you're going toward the ministry is your
[1:00:30] traveling
[1:00:32] watch that verse six and thither ye
[1:00:35] shall bring verse seven and there you
[1:00:38] shall eat before the Lord your God he
[1:00:41] shall rejoice and all that you put your
[1:00:43] hand done to you and your household
[1:00:45] wearing the LORD thy God hath blessed
[1:00:48] thee you're coming somewhere what are
[1:00:51] you doing you're leaving your house
[1:00:55] people say oh I can stay home on the
[1:00:58] internet and I can just mail my check
[1:01:00] off I think of my tithe check off over
[1:01:02] here no no no you have to leave your
[1:01:05] house then come unto the place
[1:01:08] where God has placed his name in the
[1:01:11] ministry where the Word of God comes
[1:01:14] forth what was God has his ministers we
[1:01:18] read there in Ephesians that he's when
[1:01:20] he was ascending up on high as he was
[1:01:23] ascending he threw down some gifts unto
[1:01:25] men amen
[1:01:27] it started on the day of Pentecost and
[1:01:29] it's still going into this day that made
[1:01:31] her being anointed hey man what do you
[1:01:34] do you find that place in your local
[1:01:37] area where God has given that unto you
[1:01:39] as to a gift I believe that every true
[1:01:42] child of God that God has given that
[1:01:44] gift to Amen you ought to have a pastor
[1:01:47] why because if God has given you a gift
[1:01:50] then you should have it if you don't
[1:01:53] have a pastor then why are you why don't
[1:01:56] you have something that God gave to you
[1:01:59] if God gave you a pat he said right
[1:02:01] there in the Bible he gave unto you a
[1:02:03] gift of a pastor and if you say oh I
[1:02:05] don't have a pastor why don't you have a
[1:02:07] pastor God gave them to you why don't
[1:02:11] you have it the pattern is and thither
[1:02:13] you'll leave and there you will go but
[1:02:17] if you will not go then you have a gift
[1:02:19] somewhere that you're missing you're
[1:02:21] missing something God gave it to you but
[1:02:23] you're missing it
[1:02:24] you're missing out amen God gave you a
[1:02:27] ministry amen and there you shall eat
[1:02:32] before the Lord your God verse 7 now
[1:02:38] first let's go to verse 10 verse 10
[1:02:44] after the battles over after all the
[1:02:46] wandering the wilderness comes to verse
[1:02:48] 10 but when he go over Jordan and dwell
[1:02:51] in the land which the Lord God your God
[1:02:53] giveth you to inherit and when he giveth
[1:02:56] you rest from all of your enemies round
[1:02:58] about so you shall dwell in safety what
[1:03:01] are you doing you're coming into the
[1:03:02] house of the Lord
[1:03:03] you're being projected from the devour
[1:03:04] you've come into this church under the
[1:03:07] protection of Jehovah God protects the
[1:03:11] body of the Lord Jesus Christ then there
[1:03:15] shall be a place there will be a place
[1:03:22] which the Lord your God shall choose to
[1:03:25] cause his name to dwell there thither
[1:03:28] shall ye bring all that I command you
[1:03:31] your burnt offerings and your sacrifices
[1:03:34] your tithe and heave offering of your
[1:03:37] hand and all your choice vows which ye
[1:03:40] shall bow unto the Lord and ye shall
[1:03:42] rejoice before the Lord where do you
[1:03:44] rejoice before the Lord
[1:03:46] people say oh no that's a sense all of a
[1:03:49] supernatural thing but when you come
[1:03:51] into this house you're testifying this
[1:03:53] is where you can't Amen why because
[1:03:56] there's a connection here this this
[1:03:58] sanctuary really does mean something we
[1:04:01] say oh it's just a natural building
[1:04:03] doesn't mean anything and I don't have
[1:04:04] to that's just an excuse so you have to
[1:04:06] pay your time
[1:04:07] so you hear your test find you know the
[1:04:10] son or daughter of Abraham amen
[1:04:16] thither shall ye bring all that I
[1:04:19] command you now verse 12 and he shall
[1:04:22] rejoice before the Lord your God ye and
[1:04:25] your sons and your daughters and all
[1:04:26] your men servants and your maidservants
[1:04:28] and a Levite those within your gates for
[1:04:31] as much as he hath no part or no
[1:04:33] inheritance with you you're going to go
[1:04:35] and rejoice with the Levite that God
[1:04:37] gave you God gave you a Levite you got
[1:04:42] to go leave your house and rejoice with
[1:04:43] them that sounds like church to me Amen
[1:04:46] and when you go and rejoice with them
[1:04:48] you have to bring your tithes and your
[1:04:51] offerings and your rejoicing
[1:04:54] sounds like Church to me that's Church
[1:04:57] amen amen
[1:05:06] now verse 13 take heed to thyself that
[1:05:12] thou offer not thy burnt offerings in
[1:05:16] every place that thou seest so there's a
[1:05:23] special place it's not just anywhere
[1:05:26] it's not just on the Gulf over here pay
[1:05:28] tithes over here this week I'm gonna go
[1:05:30] off over there and pay ties this week
[1:05:31] no God gave you a pass
[1:05:34] amen God gave you a pastor you know I
[1:05:38] think I'm gonna pay half of my tithes
[1:05:44] over to Jeffersonville or I'm gonna pay
[1:05:48] half of my ties over to Johnson City and
[1:05:52] I'm gonna bring the other half here to
[1:05:55] Des Moines
[1:05:57] what are you what is the word tithe mean
[1:06:01] it means a tenth if you bring nine
[1:06:06] percent of your of your increase is that
[1:06:12] tithing
[1:06:13] that's not tithing will God reward it no
[1:06:18] your as disobedience nine percent is not
[1:06:23] a tenth nine percent is not ten percent
[1:06:31] gross your increase your tiny ten
[1:06:36] percent where do you bring it verse 13
[1:06:40] take heed watch out be careful take heed
[1:06:44] to thyself that thou offer not my burnt
[1:06:48] offering in every place that they'll see
[1:06:50] us but in the place that the Lord shall
[1:06:52] choose in one of my tribes which is the
[1:06:56] ministry that's the ministry he who God
[1:07:00] sent down the gift upon bring find out
[1:07:04] who is your pastor and pay tithes unto
[1:07:06] him 10 percent there so you offer thy
[1:07:12] burnt offerings and there thou shalt do
[1:07:14] all that I command thee amen
[1:07:21] now let's go to verse 17 now may is not
[1:07:26] God pursue that some people will try and
[1:07:28] do this thou mayst not eat within thy
[1:07:32] gates that's your house the tide of thy
[1:07:35] corn or of thy wine or the oil of thy
[1:07:39] firstlings or of thy hurts or of thy
[1:07:41] flock or of a thy vows that was nor of
[1:07:44] thy free will offerings or the heave
[1:07:46] offering of thy hand
[1:07:47] so if you have the 10% of your income
[1:07:50] that God has already promised to give
[1:07:52] unto your pastor and you hold it back
[1:07:55] and Rob God and then you use that money
[1:07:58] to go out and buy something at
[1:08:01] McDonald's and bring it back to your
[1:08:02] house and eat it there you're in
[1:08:04] disobedience to this verse if you use
[1:08:08] that because God already that tithing
[1:08:10] never doesn't belong to you it belongs
[1:08:12] to God into his ministry and if you hold
[1:08:15] it back and Rob God and then use it for
[1:08:17] something else in your household in your
[1:08:19] gates then this verse is against you
[1:08:23] amen thou mayst not verse 17 thou mayst
[1:08:27] not eat within thy gates the tithe of
[1:08:30] thy corn or of thy wine or the oil or
[1:08:32] the first things that I herds or
[1:08:34] LifeLock or every near the bowels of the
[1:08:36] house nor the free will offerings or the
[1:08:39] heave offering of thine hand but thou
[1:08:42] must verse 18 but thou must eat them
[1:08:47] before the LORD thy God in the place
[1:08:49] that the LORD thy God shall choose now
[1:08:52] and thy son and thy daughter and I'm
[1:08:54] answer it and I made servant and the
[1:08:57] Levite those within thy gates now this
[1:09:00] is just completely natural talking here
[1:09:03] brother Isaiah where does his food come
[1:09:07] from it just think him as his natural
[1:09:12] food he goes to high V goes to Walmart
[1:09:14] buy some food where did that food come
[1:09:17] from the Lord God gave him a 10% of the
[1:09:23] bride of Lord Jesus Christ of all the
[1:09:27] blessings that she has received upon
[1:09:28] this earth all the natural blessings all
[1:09:31] of her increased everything that is
[1:09:33] given to her by somebody else and when
[1:09:36] she receives it she marks off the 10%
[1:09:38] and that that 10% is something that God
[1:09:42] has reserved unto her ministry amen and
[1:09:45] he eats of that partakes of that and his
[1:09:49] body has been completely created by the
[1:09:51] DNA that he has purchased
[1:09:53] as has been sustained by the food that
[1:09:58] he has purchased with your tithing amen
[1:10:01] when he comes into this he is not weak
[1:10:03] he is not tired he is not hungry he is
[1:10:06] not worn down why because he has had
[1:10:08] enough to sustain himself to have a
[1:10:11] shelter over his head
[1:10:12] amen to have a shelter over his head to
[1:10:15] have food that he can go eat and provide
[1:10:17] for his children why because that is his
[1:10:19] inheritance and if you hold that back
[1:10:21] from you've robbed God so you must come
[1:10:25] and eat with eat the word in this house
[1:10:28] and the word comes out brother Isaiah's
[1:10:30] mouth due to the strength that he has
[1:10:33] received by the food that he is eating
[1:10:36] out of your hand verse 19 take heed to
[1:10:49] thyself watch out be careful take heed
[1:10:53] to thyself that thou forsake not the
[1:10:56] Levite as long as they liveth upon the
[1:10:59] earth be careful watch out be very very
[1:11:07] careful that you don't miss out make
[1:11:14] sure that you're giving your tithe in
[1:11:18] unto the Levite that is closest to your
[1:11:22] house Amen God when he ascended up on
[1:11:29] high gave gifts unto many and he is
[1:11:34] foreseeing that that gift was right here
[1:11:37] in your neighborhood a place a
[1:11:41] mouthpiece where the Word of God can
[1:11:43] leave his mouth where he can be inspired
[1:11:47] by the holy spirit and living God and
[1:11:49] preached unto you and verse 19
[1:11:53] Deuteronomy 12 verse 19 be very very
[1:11:56] careful take heed to thyself that you
[1:11:59] forsake not the Levite as long as now
[1:12:03] limits upon yours all the days of your
[1:12:06] life be careful make sure that you're
[1:12:08] paying your tithes under the ministry
[1:12:11] not out of your house
[1:12:14] not somewhere on the internet not some
[1:12:17] town far off but 10% of whatever man
[1:12:20] gives unto you of whatever God blesses
[1:12:22] with you you mark that 10% and you bring
[1:12:25] it unto the gift that God has given you
[1:12:27] which in this sound brother Isaiah
[1:12:29] Brooks that's the gospel amen tithes and
[1:12:36] offerings that's the gospel and God will
[1:12:42] see to it
[1:12:43] watch out let's go back now okay Malachi
[1:12:51] 3 verse 10 bring me all the tithes not
[1:13:05] some of them bring the 10% into the
[1:13:08] storehouse that there may be meat in
[1:13:11] mine house spiritual food in due season
[1:13:14] right here
[1:13:16] God you know brother Isaiah listens to
[1:13:19] the message every day it was like he's
[1:13:21] told me he says I listen to a message
[1:13:23] every single day and the Holy Spirit
[1:13:27] that he reads his Bible he prays he
[1:13:31] listens to the tapes the Holy Spirit
[1:13:33] gathers out of that since is what is the
[1:13:35] need of this local congregation and
[1:13:38] gives it out through his mouth and we
[1:13:43] are perfected by that a men I know I
[1:13:46] have I hope you have a men bring you all
[1:13:52] the tithes into the storehouse that
[1:13:54] there may be meat in mine house and
[1:13:56] prove me now herewith saith Lord of
[1:13:58] Hosts if I will not open to you the
[1:14:00] windows of heaven and pour you out a
[1:14:03] blessing that there shall be not room
[1:14:05] enough to receive it and I will rebuke
[1:14:07] the Devourer for your sakes guess the
[1:14:11] Saint is going like a roaring lion
[1:14:12] seeking you made about amen that's first
[1:14:17] Peter 5:8
[1:14:18] amen amen we've become heirs of God and
[1:14:24] the 10% of all that man gives
[1:14:28] belongs under the ministry that God has
[1:14:31] given us amen
[1:14:33] that true we believe that Saints amen
[1:14:36] amen
[1:14:37] we have lifted our hand unto Jehovah the
[1:14:39] Most High God we have rejected all the
[1:14:42] things of Sodom and Gomorrah and they
[1:14:46] have not made us rich everything we have
[1:14:48] has come to us from God
[1:14:49] what do you have that you did not first
[1:14:52] receive if you did receive it why would
[1:14:55] you be prideful of seeking that my own
[1:14:57] education or my own resources or my own
[1:15:00] intelligence has given me this good job
[1:15:03] this good career or this whatever no you
[1:15:07] receive that because God gave that to
[1:15:09] you
[1:15:10] and when God gave that to you 10% of
[1:15:12] that was just a pass on through onto the
[1:15:14] MIT local ministry in your neighborhood
[1:15:17] amen
[1:15:18] now in this church we have the tithing
[1:15:20] basket is right here
[1:15:22] this is the tithing basket amen
[1:15:26] and the 10% goes into the tithing basket
[1:15:28] that and that only you know what that is
[1:15:30] for that is for the ministry but it's
[1:15:34] not for this building amen it is for the
[1:15:37] ministry this is God himself said he
[1:15:40] said bring in the tithing so that there
[1:15:42] might be meat in my house amen you say
[1:15:45] oh I wish I wish there was deepness I
[1:15:48] wish that the mess is one more deep have
[1:15:50] you paid your tithing amen you pay your
[1:15:56] tithing God will bring you the desires
[1:15:58] of your heart the deep that you're
[1:16:00] looking for
[1:16:01] amen that is the mystery amen I know
[1:16:04] that evangelist and everything comes out
[1:16:07] of that is the ministry it's for the
[1:16:09] ministry amen and the offerings we pass
[1:16:12] the basket right there for the offerings
[1:16:14] the offering pays for the lights and it
[1:16:17] pays for this building the rent for the
[1:16:19] insurance policies that we have and just
[1:16:22] all the natural things to do with
[1:16:23] running this church and it goes that
[1:16:26] goes to the trustee the trustee writes
[1:16:29] out the checks and distributes it as the
[1:16:32] church has neat so we gotta have a nice
[1:16:34] place that we could come into this place
[1:16:37] and rejoice with our Levi
[1:16:41] brother Isaiah who has been chosen by
[1:16:44] God to be a pastor over this local
[1:16:47] hospital why so we might be perfected
[1:16:49] and coming to the unity of the body of
[1:16:51] Christ because if we didn't have this
[1:16:54] place really how could people say oh
[1:17:00] it's all supernatural I can stay at home
[1:17:03] I can do this I can do that how in the
[1:17:06] world are you going to be do you not
[1:17:07] believe when the Bible says iron
[1:17:09] sharpens iron and it only does that when
[1:17:12] it contacts a man only sharpens iron
[1:17:15] when it makes contact iron sharpens iron
[1:17:18] and it begins right here amen you have a
[1:17:23] ministry to the Bride of Christ yourself
[1:17:25] by bringing your lick of fire into this
[1:17:27] place
[1:17:28] amen to rejoice before the Lord the
[1:17:31] Bible linked tithing and rejoicing
[1:17:33] together amen so wherever it is you come
[1:17:36] to rejoice with the gift that God gave
[1:17:39] you you owe your tithing to where you
[1:17:41] get the word and you bro you're offering
[1:17:44] there the tithing is 10% of all the man
[1:17:47] gives you a mint all the gods bless with
[1:17:50] you with a mint and and also the honor
[1:17:53] above that and offering a free will he
[1:17:56] bought offering them to the Lord amen
[1:17:59] and a rejoicing amen we owe to God why
[1:18:04] because we've lifted up our hand like
[1:18:05] our father Abraham he called me he chose
[1:18:10] me he drew me out for the things of the
[1:18:13] world he separated me from all the
[1:18:16] foolishness of Laodicea and he set me
[1:18:19] here in a seat he gave me a ministry he
[1:18:22] gave me a job
[1:18:23] he gave me an increase I have marked
[1:18:26] that tenth I had given unto the ministry
[1:18:28] and the Ministry has thrived here amen
[1:18:30] and I have been perfected by it my
[1:18:33] garment is lost by what is white about
[1:18:37] spot without wrinkle because it has been
[1:18:41] intruded into me as righteousness
[1:18:43] because I believe the Lord and all in
[1:18:46] the fullness of what was word I believed
[1:18:48] him that's been attributed unto me a for
[1:18:50] righteousness and now I'm a possessor of
[1:18:52] the heavens and the earth one
[1:18:55] inheritance and I got like I heard about
[1:18:59] this inheritance because of the ministry
[1:19:01] and it wasn't a weak ministry as a
[1:19:04] powerful ministry and the ministry
[1:19:07] didn't have to worry about about about
[1:19:10] you know all the natural things why
[1:19:12] because the inheritance that they
[1:19:14] received of their own they didn't they
[1:19:16] rejected their natural careers to give
[1:19:19] their entire time over to the ministry I
[1:19:21] benefit from it and I get my tithe and
[1:19:24] offering so they might have free reign
[1:19:26] we have a local church or my children
[1:19:29] can be raised in the nurture and the
[1:19:31] admonition of the Lord amen and the same
[1:19:35] goes unto you
[1:19:37] that's why we bring our tithes the 10%
[1:19:40] and that's why we bring our offering if
[1:19:43] we don't do that then how can we say
[1:19:44] that we are sons and daughters of
[1:19:46] Abraham how can we say that we are
[1:19:48] possessors of heaven and earth how can
[1:19:50] we say that we are the bride of Lord
[1:19:52] Jesus Christ if we won't do the things
[1:19:54] that he told us to do it Amen let's just
[1:19:57] an obedience brings faith and faith
[1:20:06] we'll give you all things Amen let's
[1:20:10] just bow our heads in word prayer
[1:20:12] Heavenly Father I just want to thank you
[1:20:14] Lord for this divine appointment or for
[1:20:17] leading us through this word a Laura

[1:20:26] years Lord and it has never failed me
[1:20:28] yet or and I thank you for it Lord or
[1:20:31] forgiving me this gospel but more than

[1:22:42] strong body full of grace and truth
[1:22:45] that we could be the ministers of
