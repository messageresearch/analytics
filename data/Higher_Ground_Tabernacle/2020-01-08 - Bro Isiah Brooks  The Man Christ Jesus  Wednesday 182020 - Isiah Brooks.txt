we got a special friend of ours here you know our brother will we come to know him as a real brother in Christ close friend amen we so funny I don't know whether you know there's realize this but brother Troy this is the brother I thought was the brother I met in Visio and brother brother Troy and I was like going back and forth back and forth he he is no brother I'm sorry he's not yes he then I found out Troy was right but you know God is good to us and I'm so glad to have brothers in Christ like that he's you'll be leaving out tomorrow morning came in Monday be out here leave out tomorrow

going to minister something for you tonight that would be a real blessing to you so let's stand by God's grace and you know as I don't know whether everybody is seeing this but I was telling brother Troy tonight the thing that they constantly seem to be exploding in my heart and my mind is that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God and that's not my message tonight but I do want to touch on that in just a bit but you know it's just amazing because I realized by God's grace that there's only one perfect one and that is Jesus Christ and of course without him we we won't make it but we made it because of his salvation plan what he has already done and I thank God for that so but as we stand let us turn to our to passage of scripture Matthew 1:21 which is a scripture that we we know because usually around Christmas time this scripture is read pretty often and then we'll we'll go to Matthew 17 5 through 8 so we're going to have you turn to for for passage of scripture Matthew Matthew first Timothy and in Zachariah Matthew 1:21 it reads and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins the word is never wrong never ever wrong the word is always right Matthew 17 5 through 8 means interpretation may be wrong but God that way is wrong Matthew 17 5 through 8 while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and we're so afraid Jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid but when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only first Timothy 2nd chapter we are such a blessed people huh if you ever think about it you think about the many people who desire to go beyond the last veil which is the Holies of Holies every high priest didn't get that opportunity but there were those who did and because you know even if you were priests you could not be found with any blemishes anything that would reflect something that was imperfect so even the outward appearance of a priest had to appear perfectly and so therefore they were ordered to wash to cleanse themselves they also had to be examined as if they were the lamb and of course if there were some spots something that appeared on them during the time that they were supposed to do a service then of course they weren't able to do it so we ought to thank God for the lamb especially the Lamb of God who was without spot or blemish 1st Timothy 2:5 and 6 it reads for there is one God one mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time I love that because the testimony of this man and of this mediator was set for tying to be Zechariah please the ninth chapter will read the 16th through the 17th verse appreciate you all just coming out I know that we're living in the last days and everything is at a confused State brother branham basically said in a message he called it the world is falling apart and and it is and we see that nobody understands why is falling apart but we know that it's falling of a carpod because men rejected the gospel Zechariah 9 16 and the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people for those they shall be as the stones of a crown you see you don't put any kind of stones in the crown those crowns are those stones are perfected they shaped they've been cut before placing into the crown lift it up as an ensign upon his land for how great is his goodness and how great is his beauty let us pray father God we come before you and we thank you Lord Jesus for being so good to us you have been better to us than we've been to our sails lord I pray tonight that you bless the service bless the word give us Lord that what we need Lord we appreciate you you're greater than anything we've ever come to know your ways of past finding out and Lord how we love you Father forgive us for any and everything we may Seiler done they would have not been pleasing in the nice sight Lord you be our advocate tonight we will always give you the praise in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated when I think about the Bible I think about what God has done the Bible you know we find that in our day people are trying to change the gender of the Bible they want to make it a she but you see God can never be a she in that way because she has not the ability to reproduce it you know it's the only the man who is able to bring forth seed and if you understand god's creation you find out that the earth itself was a she because it was where God planted the seed to reproduce the Bible as we understand represents the man hello in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God who was that Jesus but the church represents the woman because that's why Adam could not be deceived but the woman she could be the seed it is not the word that leads people in the error is the woman the church that leads people into error now I'm not preaching against a woman but what I'm trying to tell you is that this Bible represents you and me it represents God and his bride it's male and female y'all hear me because that's the way God started it out he fer first Amen introduced Adam and the Bible tells us that Adam was made in the image and likeness of God it was then after Adam had been made God unveiled if I could say it like that the seventh seal under the sixth because man was created or woman and man was created on the sixth day and we find out that Eve came under that seal when God ripped or did that operation on Adam he unfolded a secret that I believe that even the Angels did not know but God just didn't become a el shadi I he was always el Sharia which is the breast at one it was a hidden thing that that God hid from even his angels until we find April ham toes enough God and now God is using Abraham to unfold his mysteries himself amen throughout the time and ages you and I must understand by God's grace that this book must become you hallelujah because if we can understand this week we know that before God even manifested Eve God told Adam male to be fruitful and multiply and we've said these things before my subject tonight is the man Christ Jesus I think sometimes we just just failed to see who he really is oh I was saying this - hey brother wheel tonight I said think about this there are those who have been great man and called great man I think Josiah was one that God called and named him before he was even born but only a few men get that type of announcements or enter into the world Amen with the name preceding them but when it came to Jesus Mary didn't name him neither did Joseph name him but it was the Holy Ghost who named him and it's so amazing because we would never have known the name of the Holy Ghost if Jesus had not said I come in my father's name so we understand he came in his father's name so his father's name was Jesus as well hallelujah you know I've got another Isaiah and I'm an idea of an Isaiah and I came in my father's name hallelujah so it's an honor to come in your father's name but we find out that when the angel came to Mary and told Mary what she was going to conceive I can't imagine what she must have felt like knowing that this prophecy had been given hundreds of years before and God waited for her time to call her and she had no idea where she was born raised up as a teenage girl not even knowing that she was in the book hallelujah and we find out Amen that here it comes and I can't imagine what she must have felt like and you know I don't think she could perhaps fully grasp even after the angel told her that this thing that being you is of the Holy Ghost and it is the son of God it will be the Christ and it will a man save his people from their sins I could not imagine what she must have felt like it's amazing that she was able to wait to go to see Elizabeth yeah hallelujah with news like that you want to run and tell it you know what I mean even if people don't can't see it you you just want to run and tell it that I'm the one that Isaiah spoke of a virgin shall conceive I'm the one and you know what with that testimony you without the vindication of God God didn't leave her Testament are testifying just empty as soon as she called on the name of Jesus and spoke the word Jesus amen what happened Elizabeth's child John y'all understand me because Jesus was the god of John somebody helped me here and you got to realize Amen that even God had Elizabeth to name John because John wasn't a family name John meet the beloved of God and God amen had to make sure that when that child was born it had to how could I said farm itself into the beloved of God now Jesus himself the Bible said he learned who he was I'm sure he he learned him obedience through his veins he suffered but it was the scripture that identified who he was and somehow the revelation came to him my father is not Joseph and neither is my mother Mary because when they found him wandering there in Jerusalem here he was among the elders of the Pharisees and he was teaching them and marrying Joseph was a little wrong with him in it and they said in other words where have you been don't you know you're my your father and I we've been looking for you and Jesus being the word immediately say a woman don't you know I be about my father's business I don't even know whether he poured it up with a knife but I can almost see the child I did defying his Heavenly Father as his father somebody helped me here see but you gotta understand that God he is just so wise in all that he he he do he knows it the beginning from the ending and he doesn't make a mistake and sometime we can look at the things that he's he's doing we can't even figure it out how can this how can it work but it works and everything that God says works it takes faith to move it and to make it but it'll work it'll never come back to him void why because what we have is God's master plan because you got to realize I will have finite minds we cannot comprehend God you can go to the greatest schools in the world and you'll never be able to be educated the school's theology they can never educate you into God you'll never understand God by education I mean all it brings is a good argument we know that the Pharisees and the Sadducees describes all of them the Greeks and the Hebrews they always argued the Word of God because they tried to comprehend God with their minds hallelujah how can you comprehend such a great thing in such a peanut brain you can't do it that's why God put this thing in such a way that it is revealed I love this because revelation a man is not in the head is in the heart it's something that God designed he designed the heart to be a to receive revelation hello me and a brother we were talking the other day and we were talking about the kingdom of God and he has to be the question what who what is the kingdom of God I say the kingdom of God is the king but of course he had some other thoughts to it but then as I said King I said that's right because even in this place I said you can't have a kingdom without a king it takes a king to make a kingdom and a king is a ruler he is in his Providence in his area he is the only potentate it is whatever he says goes in his kingdom and with us if he says something to do and you don't do it normally there are penalties right oh you sure what do you mean let's take Nebuchadnezzar for an example when he being the king said if you don't bow to the image you will be destroyed and the Bible says that even in the natural they said the words of a king once it's gone out cannot be distracted it can't be taken back right a man even in the days of King as a surah when Esther when when the King had already ordered that all the Jews be killed he himself could not say okay let's take that back but they had to make a way another another word another thing a law that could get around that one law I called that second law the law of grace is that right cause the law that God gave was that the day that you eat of this tree you should surely die but there was another law and we called that law grace and truth and that law grace and truth with Jesus Christ but according to the original law the king made it he told Adam and Eve the day that you eat of this tree you should surely die see Adam was a king but he wasn't the king of kings it was God who was the king of kings somebody helped me here so I want to say this by God's grace you and I must understand that without the man crack that's why the Bible wants to water down the name of Jesus and impulses listen there are Jesus's there many of them you know in every system has a Jesus but listen there's only one and that one can only be revealed to you hello somebody I'm coming that only that one can only be revealed to you and without that revelation you lost is that right Jesus told the Pharisees except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sins hey somebody and those people thought they were serving the same God and he was God standing in flesh right among them and they were denying him why because they had an intellectual revelation of who God should be hallelujah and God always reveal himself in simplicity I often one that says Lord here was Abraham in the cool of the day him and Sarah out there in the heat of the day and you know the cool of the day and amen and Here Come three men walking up out of the dusters from somewhere he couldn't tell where they started he didn't know where they came from and I don't think they even ever look like they were tired and worn out from walking in the desert so Abraham knew somethings about these people hallelujah what was it Abraham says one two three and when they got to him Abraham says my lord lor D why did he say my Lords because the revelation came to him these three men represents God himself see that's what people don't understand God is the amorphic he can do what he wants to do hallelujah is that Alright folks don't him understand Amen that that even Jesus oh he call him Christ he was there before the foundation of the world yep that's viable Hebrew says everything that was made everything that was created was created by him and the reason why people can't understand it because they can't understand the pre-existence of Jesus of God you understand me he was the logos from the logos he formed himself a body that the body was created but the god of the creation was in him and the creator nation had to call the creator father because the body was Jesus but the spirit in him was Christ see and that wasn't didn't make him to God it made a one this night you got body soul and spirit you one person and if you lose one part of the other you'll never function the same hello let me sit like this you can't recognize God until God allows you to recognize him God was revealed to you when he's near when he's in you or when he's about you is that right remember now Elijah when he was with uh those men he smoked them blind it was a serious he smoked them flying and he was right in front of him leading them and guiding them everywhere and they could not see who that was they were looking for Elijah and he was the one in there saying I come this way come to that he could have and listen even his servants say should we slay them he says nonsense I'm in control of all these things why should i slay them let's feed him and send him away see what you gotta understand is that God is always in control hallelujah but if you truly want to see God he will show himself to you he will reveal to you who he really is he said what are you saying let me just even go to the birth of Jesus the birth of him right he had was Amen Bethlehem Jerusalem all of these religious people and they didn't even know that the Christ child had been born two and a half years later some wise men came maybe they were Arabs or something like that but these men had been educated about the Star of David that was just appear through the school of Daniel the wise man of Babylon like the Harvard of today and they were expecting the star to appear but we find out that all of the church never knew what was going on but it was a time it was a time of war I'm saying something here it was a time of war and confusion Jerusalem Amen was under the attack of the Romans hallelujah everything was in chaos for the people of God but it was at that time the star appeared hallelujah and in that time everybody didn't see him it was only the humble God first revealed himself Amen to the shepherds those who were looked down upon right that group of people that that that didn't know what was happening but then God did what revealed to the Shepherd's what was happening during that time what about the doctors of divinity what about the describes the Pharisees the Herodians and all those great means in Jerusalem they didn't even know that the Christ child had been born so I'm saying all of these things to say let's update it the world is in chaos the war is being fought right now it is the Christian in its principles even who the world is fighting against oh let me tell you something it's going to come knocking on your door one way or the other but it was during that time God revealed himself hallelujah it was at that time Jesus Christ the man became God the man it's something about it you know we don't understand how election works but we know that God does it he chose you you didn't choose him but it's something how when that season comes when he wants to reveal himself to us he is elect he makes it happen like annan in Zachariah in the temple maybe 60 70 80 years old people but they've been testifying for years that they're going to see the Messiah before they allelujah she is something about things that God makes you do without you realizing what you're doing and I believe that the bride will have an inspiration now I'm going to make a rapture she don't even know why she's saying it she doesn't even know why because in the eyes in her eyes she's not perfect or anything but something on the inside lets her know she's going to make a rapture it's a compulsion like when they were there in the temple I know I'm going to see it here was a blind blind blind but somehow God was gonna reveal to them hallelujah is that right soon as Mary came in there with a little Jesus baby hallelujah some inspiration says keep on walking keep on walking hallelujah himmat can I hold your baby huh come on somebody they may have allowed a lot of boy babies to move by them but this one had a certain Chi this one had a certain sound to it was they picked that baby all of a sudden prophecy came through hallelujah oh my goodness I can die now because I'm now seeing the Christ child my mission is over now because he's here y'all understand me is something about Jesus he doesn't leave his work up and up to amateurs hallelujah he is the quickening spirit he knows how to quicken us like I was telling them brother the other day I say you can hope to be to have faith but faith is not hope faith is a revelation from God it is God that gives you the fellows the faith to be healed it is God that gives you the faith to be delivered it is God who gives you the faith to be saved you don't do that on your own by your own mental capacity it is the grace god that gives you all of this ha because it is he who said he they begun the good working you is faithful to complete it you and I have never been faithful to God hello we're always making mistakes we always make him promises and we break them everyone thank God for the grace of God will help us Jesus that's right why are you why is God like the script says who is man that God is so mindful of him hallelujah and the whole time in our walk with Christ he's trying to reveal to us that he you and I are part of him we just didn't begin right our our life on earth is significant we have a purpose here it may be a small purpose but he designed it he for deigned it and he's going to make sure it come to pass listen I really don't believe that young boy who had those few fishes of loaf few fish is a fish and a few loaves of bread thought that morning I'm going home and I'm gone I'm going to hear this Jesus and I'm a feet five feet feet five thousand three thousand it never entered his mind because he just only had a little substance he did not have a man's meal somebody help me his laws were not like that little something right but God had ordained him huh y'all got to understand this because I want you to understand it's just like the woman when the logic came to that woman and said make me a cake first hallelujah see I always imagined this later it was healthy you know kind of plump no she and her kids were about they were starving hadn't had eaten in a long time they probably looked like holy cause people face all something here come on this was their last meal and they were going to die can you imagine God asking the impossible to the man to the woman you mean to tell me you gonna ask me to bake you a cake first you as if though you can't see that you gotta understand Elijah did not look understand because he had been fed by the Raven you understand me he's standing in a healthier position than the woman in her kid and then he asks you feed me first when how our attitudes would have been but you see God anointed her just like he anointed him something quickened to her this must be a man of God let me go do what he says do and surely she went and she did it and the Bible said the cruse of oil in the meal never ran out you understand me it was God orchestrating these things but why was he doing this sort of you and I can read it and have faith in Him because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changed not he's a God that changes not and God is more than able God is the Creator he that's what he was trying to show through the proper God he didn't need anything to create Alleluia Jesus himself amen had water he turned into wine he had fish that was already made bread that was already made he multiplied it but in this day Jesus takes another leap hallelujah it wasn't the Prophet the man who did it God used his vessel like he wants to use your vessel he used his vessel to show you I'm the same yesterday today forever in this day when the pressure comes you're not gonna have nothing but that doesn't mean you won't have nothing you have a learner and when I inspire you to say what I say what you need to say you say it say anything and it shall come to pass that's what the third pool is about having nothing and being able to prove to Satan that Kaveri works that the sons of God are now being made manifest you got him under pressure but I want to show you what they are under pressure y'all understand me when Jesus was under pressure when they were trying to crew them when they crucified him whipping him and spit they're doing everything what was he doing he was trying Satan was trying to break the lamb's nature but he doesn't get on the stage this nature was him he is the lamb is that right he proved that when Abraham took Isaac up on the mountain and Isaac was being ready getting ready to slay a date excuse me Abraham was getting ready to say Isaac and God says stay your hands Abraham aah have precipitous prepared myself this meets what we said as a sacrifice that RAM was just a sacrifice but God was saying I I myself have become the RAM in the bush somebody help me here see that's what people don't let me say it like this that's why they had to crown Jesus with the for a crown of thorns he was the ram in the thicket hallelujah that same y'all heard me say this before but even then God was showing he was the same to hole that met Abraham on the mountain and even then that realm on the mountain was being crowned king [Laughter] hallelujah and then the real king who the Bible said he shall save his people from their sins that's why it's so important to pre now because without prayer you figure you missed the inspiration of God God trying to get us to be connected to him so whenever he sends something by way of wiring or by by way of texting or by way of whatever you want to call it you'll be able to catch it hallelujah did you not know God designed us to go back to where we fallen from God intends for us to be found when he come living in the Holies of Holies somebody help me here now listen what I'm trying to tell you is the devil's work is to keep you distracted the devil's work is to keep your mind off of God the devil's work is to keep your mind off the of the intent that God has for you is that right because he heard in the word says I know you're in and it isn't expected in hallelujah my thoughts about you a good thoughts they're not bad I didn't come to save you to lose you your names were putting in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world nothing nothing that I have saved can be lost woo any man that's a real Christian who's born-again knows since he was a kid right a little girl either that there was something in you that hungered for God every one of us can say it we can look back and says there was something even when I was a little kid that hunger for God I didn't know him but there was something that I wanted I didn't know where to find and I went from charge to charge from place to place but when I heard his voice said that's what makes this thing so wonderful can listen to the voice on the tape and other people said ah I don't believe what that man say but the ones who are ordained can hear the voice within the voice something soothing about it something that satisfies the taste yeah you can't explain it all you know is that you have arrived I've arrived this what I've been looking for all my life did you know God has something in there that says if a man has a will to do good God has already counted it as being done whoa you may not even accomplish it but you have a will to do it I understand a lot of oh that makes me want to shout just having the wheel to live perfect God counted as being done I must say that again just having the wheel and desire to be perfect God counted as being done oh come on somebody now I'm going to get to the scripture of me one of the brothers we we you know brother Derek yeah y'all know him but we were talking last night so he gave me the script and I didn't know I was going to use it because he he might come and preach the same thing but I'll say but I want you to understand he just threw some things out at us and it was really good and he used he says there is a brother he was just so excited he was literally tearing up and I was catching it but I couldn't tear up it was like it was it was an explosion going off and boom he was just something happening and you know I'm a very emotional person but I thought still waters run deep and it was just it was just it was just great so I hope it happens to you tonight but when I saw this thing the scripture says he said did you not know that in the Bible when he says the law says I'm going to send you a comforter he said that same word comforter is the same word advocate in first John 2 marita since my little children these things I write unto you that you see not and if any man sin we have an advocate somebody help me here I'm gonna break it down in just a minute he said whip the father Jesus Christ the righteous hmm let me read that again so you can catch it we have advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous now you got to understand if that same word is the same as confident we think oh when the comforter has come that means if I'm feeling bad he gonna Pat me on my back and he gonna rock me and make me feel good that ain't what it is I'm sure that's included but this comforter this advocate Amen is a word and I didn't type it in there but it means a person who speaks all right in support or defense of a person of cause in other words he's your attorney that's why the Bible said that he was tempted in every way in other words everything you've gone through he's gone through it himself and every time you says Oh God forgive me for the sin a lot I didn't mean to what was that man that went up before the Lord I just preached on it last week or two weeks ago I'm thinking John Ryan it wasn't John the man who who had the dream he died and he whipped before the light there it is Danny something there which I'll remember the man who I'm trying to tell you about and he said he said that in that light he said you couldn't lie he said the light was so bright you couldn't lie everything that you thought was a small became large and the law says have you ever stolen he said I thought for a moment oh yes Lord I'm stolen have you ever lied and he realized yeah there been some shady deals in my life and she said you know there has a question when he could only answer yes I'm guilty but he said just as he thought he was going to hear the voice of God saying depart from me you workers of iniquity he said from behind me I heard the sweetest voice ever sweeter than a mother's voice and that force is Lord when Danny was on earth he stood for me young mr. hasni see that was that advocate that was that attorney said Lord I've watched him he stood for me I've seen him even though he didn't have that Holy Ghost like he should have had it somebody over here he stood for me on earth and I'll stand for him now see so were you saying that's why the Bible says if you confess your sins he is just and he will forgive you of your sins he will cleanse you from all unrighteousness you see Jesus Christ what did he do the very judge became the attorney he became the jury he became everything you are in a case that's been thrown out I don't know where you're getting it now maybe you don't understand there is nothing against you oh let me say because of Jesus Christ there is nothing against you that's the only way you'll make a rapture because the blood of Jesus Christ does in your defense oh Jesus help us Lord must I read it he said but in this case the judge himself becomes our attorney God became man there was no attorney could do it we couldn't find one Moses in the law the prophets nothing could do it so the judge became both jury attorney and judge himself and took the Justice of the law in his own hands and paid the price of it you understand me that's what cabin was all about paying your price all of the stuff you've never done has been paying for y'all think about it meant like the Bible said Sayla meditate only think about it because the devil is an accuser and he's accusing you everyday and to think that he's telling you you ain't gonna make no rapture you a righteous you ain't even holy God ain't quick on your holiness he's not requiring your righteousness he became my sin that we might become his righteousness it is a gift just like everything else is how much more Kosuke secure could we be there's no need to feel insecure insecure right now not at this time you gotta trust God he said if you believe in me hallelujah he said you're passed from death unto life is that right if you believe in me I want you to also believe I in my father's house there are many mansions and if it wasn't so I wouldn't told you I to prepare place for you that where I am there you may be also listen if you believed in me he didn't say you gotta do this you got to do that you got to do this you got to do that he said if you believe in me in my father's house it takes the sting out of death and it takes the power out of law somebody help me here we live the way we live because we want to show him how we appreciate what he's done hallelujah you can't be saving lost at the same time once he saved you you're saying hallelujah it ain't based upon somebody else opinion of you it's who you are before the foundation of the world and God knows how to clear your case is that right the woman caught in adultery hallelujah caught caught hallelujah among those who had the law the Pharisees and everything they wanted to stone hear her hallelujah Jesus rolled in the ground on the ground I don't know what he wrote but whatever he wrote hallelujah those Pharisees looked down and walked away I often wonder what it was maybe it was dates and times and names hallelujah he says who my let him who has without seeing cast the first stone everybody start peeling away what was it case dismissed case dismissed he became the judge the jury and the attorney hallelujah and he said to the woman will be your accuser hallelujah Wow all day she said there are Tennessee he said then I won't be accused of either you go your way be free don't say no more come on come on somebody this this the salvation is not halfway down it's perfect but note this there is no salvation in any other but there's no other name among men given under heaven among men where we must be saved but the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah is that right he there was no salvation in Moses Moses wasn't the Saviour God was - Savior though God was in Moses you understand me Noah wasn't a savior because the Bible said eight souls were saved in that eight Souls would included Noah and that ain't souls were saved by God somebody help me here oh no man can save himself they even made that accusation with jesus said if you be the Christ come down and save yourself Jesus couldn't even save himself he was the sacrifice had he saved himself we all would have been lost hallelujah he was the only perfect one he was the only one that had God's blood hallelujah but the devil didn't know that because of that when God went down in the ground he came back up that resurrection declared he was gone and to prove that he was still God on the day of Pentecost he sit down the same Holy Ghost that got him about the ground hallelujah and Paul wrote and he said if that same spirit being you that was in Christ Jesus quicken his body he's gonna quicken no more about it hallelujah hallelujah and sometimes you don't even feel like he's there but he'll always be there he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake him hallelujah when you in the valley he's there when you own the mountain he's there through the storms through the rain through the fire he's there hallelujah hey man that's what he told Israel he said when the waters come I'll be there when the fires come I'll be there hallelujah God I'll never forsake you y'all hear me oh my oh my I love it because that same God even when Stephen was being stoned hallelujah we would have known it all we was thinking myself oh man those stones must have heard him boy that must have been a rock and here God sent the Prophet says no it went like that and anointing struck in and while the stones were hit hitting him you know banging on his body he looked up and he says I see God I see Jesus standing on the right hand of God you understand he was in another dimension somebody help me here and God just rocked him to sleep because I'm gonna tell you something it is so true it is so true I've heard people said I did I didn't feel no pain why because God was there cushioning them mmm I know of a story and this was before I heard brother Branham say those old Pentecost because in the organization that I was in there was a man who hated that his wife was apostolic Pentecostal y'all understand me he went to that church and he started shooting shoot new golf was the place Lucar South Carolina's where it happened and the bullets they would they were in the spirit and the bullets just bounced off the people they were so in the spirit that was that was in they weren't an organization at that time but they became one you understand me they were free they believed God they were in their true anointing of God and the bullets bounced right off oh it's true is true is true it's just like you said brothers you are insane all I know is that my wife and I was coming from Chicago and we would look like we've gotten ready to be in a great wreck all of a sudden Amen I'm saying Jesus she's saying Jesus and next thing we know the cars were on the other side of us we don't know what happened it should have been a pileup and both my wife and I just got quiet could we didn't know this is some supernatural happening right now we should have been dead hallelujah but God was on the scene yo y'all you mean when God comes on the scene the devil have to shut up keep quiet and still hallelujah hallelujah oh my goodness listen people people think I'm crazy but I'm not crazy you know they think I'm seeing something different but I'm gonna tell you something I'm seeing what is right right hallelujah somebody said Jesus Christ in the form of William Branham hallelujah we're gonna baptize in his name after a while oh I shouldn't have gone there but I did hallelujah there's only one name one name that's how it is so if it was possible it would deceive the very elect but it's not possible hallelujah because she's made her connections somebody helped me here oh she pulled back the veil and she looked behind the veil and what did she see god those badges kids there wasn't God it was God behind the badger skins y'all help me nobody was worshiping the badger skins it was the Shekinah glory behind the binder skin that's what we're talkin about if you can't see that you'll never see the potential that God has in store for you that same God wants to come behind your veil and you got to see it because if you keep putting it on the Prophet old brother I'm did this he did do it whatever God God did through him but he always tell us listening I didn't do anything it was God in me it was him he did it that same feel of fire he did it I can't discern he discerned I just say what he wants me to say what is wrong with the people they don't understand it wasn't the bruise it wasn't the brazen serpent that saved him it was obedient to what God said oh and then all of a sudden they start worshipping the brazen serpent and God got angry with them because that same thing that God helped heal them with they think it made it and I Dow and that's what they do it now and they look at me like I'm blaspheming the holy ghost I know what's working through me you can't you can't blaspheme the Holy Ghost when you're preaching his truth Paul says listen uh-uh-uh-uh-uh don't you come to worship me Paul said I didn't say none of y'all you're not gonna even baptized in my name is that right Paul said my goal he said I come to do one thing to know Christ in his suffering and the power of his resurrection that's what I come that's my ambition you understand me now what good if it is if John says there behold the lamb of God and you stay there with John like some did you got to move on the bride the bride must move on it's not taking anything away from John John did was supposed to do he came to introduce us to the real Messiah the real Jesus because there's so many out there he came to into use us - the one that says Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ it's the same yesterday today and forever that's what he come to do now you can stay with John if you want to or you can move on with Jesus hallelujah because John didn't promise you a house he didn't promise you a mansion Jesus did hallelujah glory to God you now must understand almost I'm almost done because I want you to realize by God's grace this attorney is our high priest and the Bible said he could be touched by the feelings of our infirmities we had no idea the beauty of this thing that God did you know I'm saying when he took on human flesh he took on human flesh to know you to know me to know your temptations to know your sorrows your pain he wanted to know all about you in the flesh because God is a spirit hallelujah but Jesus who suffered for us he was the one tempted the man Jesus he was the one that suffered the man Jesus had headaches the man Jesus got sick the man Jesus got tired hallelujah he got weary the man Jesus felt overcrowded sometime and he went into the wilderness somebody wanted a piece of mine Oh somebody help me God saw what you're going through so whenever you come up shot he says Lord I've been there I've heard that confessions and I stand in their stand Hey the devil is mad because he don't want you to get that revelation he don't want you to understand that you are free because he whom the son sets free is free indeed and the Bible said there is no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit look what the Bible says about Jesus in Hebrews it says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears under him that was able to save him from death and was her in that he feared though he was a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered see that's why it's so important that you get the Holy Ghost because it's the Holy Ghost that that brings you to perfection because he's perfect he's been accepted so he knows the same spirit that brought him to that perfection is the same spirit that'll bring you to the perfection y'all understand me and so once you get the seal of the Holy Ghost God counted as done because God is going to complete that work hallelujah oh is that right oh my goodness it's just like the shoe you know when she was about ready to die she wouldn't in she's made up a meal offering did you know the meal offer and represented Christ and that all represented the Holy Spirit is that right and we formed that little that little fire with the cross there and put that fire in the middle in it just hallelujah it was a whole Kaveri seen done in shadow and tied hallelujah and even in that he meant the Bible said that they all in the meal meal would not run out somebody help me here once you get the Holy Ghost you don't have to worry about it running out hallelujah you'll never have to worry about being dried up and dead hallelujah why because you're in the presence of the Shekinah whoa Christ in you the hope of glory ooh we're here to reflect Jesus huh we're here to reflect the Lord Jesus Christ and you'd have heard me say this before all it is is that you and I will like Samson I love that message I love it oh Lord once more once more Lord you know because it was after the seals and everything else so it represented the bride of Jesus Christ how she would get worldly well she was already cast out but she was gonna get worldly she was gonna be distracted she was gonna do exactly what Samson did lost his power hallelujah but after that that old good dug the Philistines and the restaurant start kicking her around him around harlot is something quick in here so wait a minute I got the Holy Ghost has got to be still there ha maybe it's not bidding for us right now admit but all Lord once more help me Jesus revive my soul oh my god ie God did just dead he died it may have taken a while for him to die but as soon as he died he got up you said what do you mean because when you die in God you don't die five minutes less more or less you in the presence of the Lord hallelujah and he proved that God he God proved he's living because he put him in the Hall of Fame he looked like a failure but he whipped the devil at the end you whip him cuz you are danger whip him hallelujah god help us cheese that man in Christ Jesus I could preach on him all night but I you know I look at him as his Lord I said listen y'all know it's the truth God is never forsaken you many times we we know we're not worthy of his presence and then when we think oh it's all washed up when you think ain't guarding it just Here Come God putting a little desire in you you know Lord I want to do better and we don't even think about that desire we think always just ELISA but don't you understand without God giving it to you you wouldn't have it God gave you that desire to get up out of the dust and move forward God you say ya'll said God does not desire Lord make it come make it blue market blossom make it bring forth fruit bring this Jesus in me hallelujah mare don't make no difference that we look like a fanatic it's alright but I'm gonna keep it keep this desire until I see this desire become Jesus himself woo I'm gonna trust how can you you know the thing is if you lose trust in God you might as well what there's nothing there's nothing in this world let's go satisfy you like Jesus nothing and you lose I don't care how weak you are we know they're weak Christians but till a week Christian is greater than Satan that's right Satan still don't what do we Christian to pray hallelujah even it's your weakest point you're strong because Jesus in you he's there for you he whipped the devil hallelujah I love this I love this I love this touch not my anointed nor do my prophets any harm y'all understand me and you are in there right in that scripture touch not my anointed my anointed amen that's the Word of God is that right he can't destroy you because the Word of God said it in Revelation do whatever you can do but don't touch the oil in the way don't touch that Holy Ghost you can do whatever but don't you try to break that seal Satan can't break it I don't care how low you feel and how how alone you lonely you feel God got something for you you say old brother Brooks what are you saying all I'm saying is that we need to get back in line because the power of the Antichrist is not playing y'all hear me the power the Antichrist is moving just like Christ is moving right they move like this Jacob and Esau right they move just like this and so you got to realize that that that Antichrist is moving to and anything that is against Christ it's an anti you can't put whoa but we God don't do that no more God does exactly what he says he's gonna do if he said I'm the same yesterday today and forever that means God can do it God will do it you just need somebody that's gonna believe it hallelujah and because you don't see it doesn't mean it's not real hmm God works miracles hallelujah the problem is when situations arise we fail to ask God for faith to conquer it or conquer them we try to handle our situations ourselves hallelujah human effort we'll never defeat the devil right just like the Lord showed me that even when you spank your children if you don't pray dumb devil ain't going nowhere right they may resist doing whatever they doing so they won't get spanked again but you believe it's still there no rod cast out Devils no rod can break a devil spirit y'all understand me it is the anointing is that the word the Bob said it is the anointing that destroys the yoke hallelujah mental power does not cast out devils hallelujah it is one power that cast out devils and that's faith in God and only that faith can come back God and you and I must realize they men when we need help we need to ask God for it's nothing wrong with saying god I don't have the faith but give me the faith hey when the struggle you struggle hallelujah but you don't have to struggle says Lord take away the struggle give me what I need to conquer the devil and some time it is just one something small something small like a little stone like even had to destroy a great giant hallelujah you love the Lord listen the Bible said don't be shaken in mind according to second Thessalonians I'll be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as they as that the day of Christ is at hand he said don't even be shaken in your mind all of the things that come oh lord have mercy what I'm gonna do don't fret yourself it's coming it's gonna happen God is in control is that right listen God put you in such a position sometimes but he want to see how much faith you got right he said listen Paul he said when you get on that seat it's going to storm and it's gonna your ship is going to wreck right he said but whatever you do don't get off the ship stay on the boat cuz sometimes we think getting off the ship getting off the boat it's the safe place not when it comes to God if God says stand still stand still don't move stay right there and the Bible said that the ship with them break it up and everybody that stayed on the ship was saying God got a strange way of doing things but when you trust him like you say brother when you know you've heard from God because I'm gonna tell you something when you hear from God few old things are getting worse Fox is not you just prayed you just pray that ain't getting washed it looks like that but in the spirit of mine is not getting worse he's getting better God than answer your prayer and the devil is kicking up because he knows he's got to go but the moment you say is getting washed it gets worse but when you see it worse you ought to say thank God he's getting bad that's the truth when the woman's having a baby it gets worse before it gets better it ain't getting worse it's getting better I don't trade and that devil just got my eyes looking at stuff that's not but Abraham called those things that be not as though they were he looked me on all of that trouble there's no Sun God says so God says so oh my god ain't God good let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away and people don't understand you when you fall away from the word you got nothing on your side the word is the only thing that can keep you and you must understand you got to believe all of God's Word not some of it because man does not live by bread alone but every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and when you take God at His Word you don't know how he's going to do it I can tell you I can ask you a question and not one of us can answer it right now I can ask you a question and I'm going to ask you how does the world spin on his axle and wrote Rick rotate around the Sun and not drop into darkness what's holding it up what's got it turning have you seen the motor have you seen the belt have you seen anything that that makes it happen why is it and I can take this tambourine and let it go into a drop I can try to spin it in are never spending the same orbit or the same spin in one place same place at one time yet this earth is still spinning in the same place that God ordained it to spin and it's rotating around and moving the stars are still in its place yeah somebody help me here now if God can do that can he has answered your little bitty problem listen he probably need us microscope just just to find it but to us is great you know even the mountain ain't number two and here to God but to us we look at it you know why because God God could have made us giant when he made us small so we can believe big and I'll say it like this yo God ain't no bigger than the faith that you have if you got big faith for God he's big if your faith is a little he's little hallelujah I'm almost done you know God is real so I'll say this by God's grace keep watch and prayer it's a struggle now I know I struggle every day anybody know I struggle every day I fight Satan and let's put this way instead of fighting him I resist him every day that's what I do I don't fight him because I can but I will resist him that's what the Bible said you resist the devil he'll flee from you and all of us resisting oh come on folks you think you're going listen.you in a war how many about anybody y'all know been ever in a war in Iraq or whatever anybody ever said oh I woke up every morning with such courage I was ready to fight and all you've heard all night was bombs and everything screams and hollows you know let's get real you was just hoping somebody wasn't seeing you shaking no you can be in the war and not scared and you have to pray God give me faith Lord don't let me be a coward right don't let me don't let me run a war now we look at a Wallace as it's really bad because it is but you've got to understand I'm sure every man in a war faces that kind of a temptation getting out of the area where there but to be a man you got to stand there knowing that at some point in time you can become a victim of that war but what makes a man stand is because he must remember what he's fighting for the cause of what he's fighting for hallelujah that's what makes him go forward and you gotta remember what you're fighting for the cause of your fight and then what is it you want a new wild you want a new life you want to do you want to be what God wants you to be and I'm gonna fight for him I'm not gonna let Satan defeat me in this dimension hallelujah y'all understand me that's what I love about Jesus he was the warrior of all times and he defeated death hell and the grave for us the greatest of all enemies everything else was just foot soldiers whatever you want to call it but if God conquered the greater man the greater demons what about these little things that we fighting right like I've heard somebody say Israel was looking at how great and how big Goliath the giant was and David was looking at how big his God was and that's what we must keep in our hearts and our mind we're not cowards matter of fact we've got the strength of the Lord in us less than Oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
