[18:21] [Music]
[18:26] hey
[18:28] wherever yonder is i'm going
[18:32] we love the lord
[18:34] we're just gonna get right on into the
[18:35] word of god we do thank you
[18:38] appreciate
[18:40] all of you for being here
[18:51] uh just a simple message just tonight
[18:54] but simple but
[18:56] but
[18:57] i believe
[18:59] uh if we could see it
[19:02] it would be a great blessing to us
[19:05] to understand it
[19:08] we appreciate uh
[19:11] god for just being so real to us
[19:14] i think he's more real now to me than
[19:16] he's ever been in my entire life
[19:19] and i'm grateful because
[19:22] it's nothing that i've done to deserve
[19:24] this goodness
[19:26] i was speaking with a sister today
[19:30] and i was just telling her that with the
[19:32] way god has been dealing with me
[19:34] uh it's i'm surprised that i'm still
[19:37] standing here because sometimes i feel
[19:39] like an explosion
[19:41] and
[19:43] i thank god if he would give me
[19:44] everything the way he gives
[19:47] my god where would i be
[19:49] now we realize by god grace
[19:52] that
[19:53] we're living in the last days and
[19:55] everything is
[19:56] tough
[19:59] you know
[20:02] don't expect it to get any better
[20:07] if we're living in the days if we're
[20:09] living in the last days
[20:14] take god at his word
[20:16] and trust him
[20:18] turn with me now to luke the 11th
[20:21] chapter
[20:23] uh beginning at the first verse
[20:26] uh
[20:27] so that you understand everybody is
[20:29] going through tremendous battles right
[20:31] now
[20:32] we just had a sister call me today and
[20:36] um
[20:37] we're going to pray for her at the at
[20:39] the end of the service but
[20:41] the enemy is attacking her business that
[20:43] she's had for years
[20:46] don't want to go into detail but
[20:48] except
[20:49] unless god intervenes
[20:51] uh you know we really don't know what
[20:54] it's going to be like
[20:56] but she was telling me today regardless
[20:58] to what happens
[21:00] truly she will continue to serve god
[21:04] it's it's a real
[21:06] big situation where
[21:08] uh basically
[21:11] uh she wasn't expecting it as far as i
[21:14] know of
[21:17] and
[21:18] and you know the government
[21:20] has a way of doing things
[21:23] but you know when you stand for
[21:24] christianity
[21:26] uh you're putting yourself in harm's way
[21:29] when it comes to the world
[21:32] but
[21:33] christianity is it's it's not
[21:36] a religion it's a life
[21:38] it's a life
[21:40] so before i get into the message let us
[21:42] turn to luke 11th chapter
[21:47] i've been trying to rush with thoughts
[21:50] i was on my way down to the church and
[21:52] while i was driving thoughts were coming
[21:54] there was no way i could
[21:56] type these things down or write these
[21:58] things down and i missed a few of them
[22:00] and
[22:01] i thought you know i've got to find a
[22:02] way of
[22:03] a machine that i could just talk to
[22:06] while i'm driving
[22:08] because sometimes things come to mind
[22:11] and if you don't get it right then
[22:13] you seem to miss it
[22:15] but i hope by god's grace that god will
[22:19] give us what he wants us to have tonight
[22:24] i was gleaning from some other notes
[22:26] that i had and
[22:28] trying to pull everything together
[22:32] i'm not the fastest typist in the world
[22:34] and i feel somewhat embarrassed
[22:36] sometimes
[22:39] but i do know where i'm going
[22:41] uh when god helped me to preach the word
[22:44] uh sometimes you get back in that room
[22:46] and then new thoughts comes and
[22:49] it just continues
[22:51] but luke 11 1-13
[22:54] amen we're going to read there
[22:57] everybody's there
[22:59] amen
[23:02] and it came to pass that as he was
[23:05] praying in a certain place when he
[23:08] ceased one of his disciples said unto
[23:10] him lord
[23:12] teach us to pray
[23:13] as john also taught his disciples
[23:17] and he said unto them when ye pray say
[23:20] our father which art in heaven hallowed
[23:22] be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[23:25] done in earth as it is in heaven give us
[23:27] this day out by day our daily bread and
[23:31] forgive us of our sins for we also
[23:34] forgive everyone that is indebted to us
[23:37] and lead us not into temptation but
[23:39] deliver us from evil
[23:43] and he said unto them which of you shall
[23:45] have a friend
[23:47] and shall go
[23:48] unto him at midnight
[23:51] and say unto him friend
[23:53] lend me three loaves
[23:56] for a friend of mine in his journey has
[23:58] come to me and i have nothing to set
[24:01] before him
[24:03] and he from within shall answer and say
[24:05] trouble me not
[24:07] the door is now shut
[24:09] my children are with me in bed
[24:12] i cannot rise and give thee
[24:15] i say unto you though he will not rise
[24:18] and give him
[24:19] because he is his friend yet because of
[24:22] his impotunity he will rise and give him
[24:26] as many as he needed
[24:28] and i say unto you ask and it shall be
[24:31] given
[24:32] you seek
[24:34] and ye shall find
[24:36] knock
[24:37] and it shall be opened
[24:39] unto you
[24:41] now if
[24:43] if you realize what jesus is saying
[24:46] there is a door there's a way there's an
[24:48] entrance
[24:49] into prayer and he is the door he said
[24:52] if you ask and you seek and you knock on
[24:55] my door
[24:58] it will be open unto you
[25:00] and everyone that seek it everyone that
[25:02] asks us receive it
[25:06] and he that seeketh find it
[25:08] and to him that knock it it shall
[25:11] be opened
[25:15] you love the lord
[25:17] if a son shall ask bread of any of you
[25:20] that he is a father
[25:22] will he give him a stone
[25:25] or if he asks a fish
[25:28] will he
[25:30] for a fish give him a serpent
[25:32] or if he asks an egg will he offer him a
[25:36] scorpion
[25:39] if ye then being evil know how to give
[25:42] good gifts unto your children
[25:44] how much more shall your heavenly father
[25:47] give the holy spirit to them
[25:50] that ask him amen
[25:53] let us pray
[25:55] father god we thank you for your grace
[25:57] and your mercy
[25:59] we thank you for being so good to us
[26:02] lord we thank you father for being who
[26:04] you are
[26:06] you've chosen us from the foundation of
[26:08] the world to
[26:09] be
[26:10] your temple your body in this day
[26:13] and i pray father that you will open our
[26:16] eyes and
[26:17] give us greater revelation of
[26:19] who we are and what we are to be
[26:22] in these last days
[26:24] lord we thank you for being
[26:28] the god
[26:30] the only true living god
[26:32] that has made yourself known unto us
[26:36] have thine on the way in the service in
[26:38] your lovely name jesus christ we pray
[26:41] amen we may be seated
[26:48] when it comes to prayer
[26:51] prayer is a
[26:54] a real serious situation it's a thing
[26:56] that
[26:58] some people really think they know how
[27:03] but prayer is not the multitude of words
[27:07] or the
[27:12] the way a person may say it
[27:16] i can recall the time with brother
[27:17] brannon when he
[27:18] first met god he says lord i don't even
[27:21] know how to pray
[27:24] and he began to say abcdefg and he said
[27:27] listen
[27:28] god knew exactly what he meant
