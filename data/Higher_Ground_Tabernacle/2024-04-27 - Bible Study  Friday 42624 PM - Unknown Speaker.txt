TRANSCRIPT
========================================
e e e e e all right does this TV work no it doesn't work anymore yes sure well God bless you all and thank you for being here um we'll guess brother books is not around so that I'm having to fill in for him today so uh we'll start by word of prayer um let's bow our head dear Lord Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you Lord and we we are thankful Lord for all that you do for us Lord father you woke us up this morning Lord and you brought us to this house to study your word Lord Jesus and to Fellowship around your word Lord father I commit myself to you and I commit everybody that'll be participating in the Bible study and those that'll be live streaming Lord that that father Lord God you be glorified in all that we do Lord Jesus father the Bible says that uh when the spirit of truth shall come he shall teach you all all things Lord Jesus father let that the Holy Spirit teach us this morning Lord uh this evening Lord and just be glorified in all that we do father Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ I pray Lord amen amen all right so um I'm just going to be we're just going to be reading um the book of isra or Ezra um my mic is a little bit too loud yeah so we'll just um if we can open our Bible to Ezra so um it's pretty much just talking about the temple um like the con like rebuilding the second temple um Ezra chapter 3 can can you put that here it's after the the it's after second chronicles and when when if everybody's there we'll just get started are we all there all right praise God let's get started um it says and when the seventh month month was come and the children of Israel were in the cities the people of God uh the children of Israel wereing this is the people gather them El together as one man to Jerusalem then stood up Jo Joshua the son of Jos and his Brethren and the priest and zerubabel the son of Shel Tiel and his Brethren and builded the altar of of the god of Israel to offer burn of to offer burnt offerings thereon as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God so what we're going to be doing is we're just going to be like commenting like verse after verse you know so here like to to to talk about what what is happening here is that um the children of Israel we've been studying on the book of Jeremiah lately and um like I'm just fast forwarding after Jeremiah they went into captivity in Babylon and then after the Captivity um this is like after they came back from captivity and uh they wanted to rebuild the Temple you know cuz like when the the Babylonians took over the cities of Jerusalem they had destroyed the first temple that King Solomon had built and here now we see that they had a desire to restore the the the AL the the temple you know and the first step here in restoring or rebuilding the temple we see that they had builted the altar in verse two he says and build building the altar of the god of Israel to offer burnt offerings thereon as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God so we understand here that the first step when building uh the temple of God was to build the altar you know and um and we're also going to try to apply it in a spiritual sense too you know we're not just going to talk about the physical because this is the shadow of of what is happening in the spiritual right so like um the prophet of God says in this quote um he says in Christianity versus I idolatry says may he be the one that fills their Temple he was praying and he was and he said and then the power and fire of the Holy Ghost will fall on the altar of their heart there is where the real altar is Lord is on the hearts of each individual you know so the real the real altar we understand that is in the heart of every individual you know so um our body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost you know and then the the devil like just like the devil destroyed the first temple he tried to destroy this Temple and now God wants to build this Temple you know he wants to build a spiritual uh house where he can come and dwell in the first step to building that we understand is is to build the altar you know that's what the that's what uh the children of Israel did and the altar is in your hearts you know the next quote also I have another quote he says um then they come to the first altar and the first altar is where they is where they burns the sacrifice and where the Lord met them there in forgiveness of sins and cleanse them from all their unrighteousness and the burning altar the Brazen altar burns the Beast and the blood from the Beast that was the second court so on that first altar the prophet is saying that's where they were burning the sacrifice you know uh like uh that that's where they met the Lord for forgiveness of their sins you know clean them from all their unrighteousness so the first step when you're trying to rebuild this Temple of the Lord you have to meet God where do you meet God you meet him in your heart you know in your heart and then you ask him to forgive him to forgive you for your sins you know and you ask him to cleanse you that's the first step and uh if we keep reading um uh verse three he says and they said the altar in the book of isra can you put isra do you say isra or Ezra Ezra okay can you put Ezra chapter 3:3 here we go and they said the altar upon his bases for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries and they offered burn offerings there on unto the Lord even burn offerings morning and evening they kept also the Feast of the Tabernacles as it is written and offered the daily I I'll just skip forward to I'll I'll skip to verse six it says uh from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord but the foundation of the Temple of the Lord was not yet laid you know so we understand that they were they they had built an altar but yet the foundation of the of the Temple of the Lord was not yet laid and they gave money also unto the Masons and to the carpers and um Can someone else read this like uh brother brother Isaac can you read this they gave money also the Mas to the Carpenters and meat and drink and oil unto them of zidon and to them of Ty to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the Sea of Jaa according to the grant that they had of Cyrus King of Persia what verse is that okay can we skip to verse n yeah thenu Kel and his sons the sons of Judah together to set for set forward the workmen in the house of God Sons ofad with their sons and their the Levites okay verse um 11 no actually verse 10 sorry yeah and when the builders laid the foundation of the Temple of the Lord they set the priest in their apparel with trumpets and the Levites the sons of Assa with symbols to praise the Lord after the ordinance of David king of Israel okay so here like they when the the the builders laid the foundation of the Temple of the Lord the Bible is telling us that they started singing they started praising rejoicing right and verse 12 it says but many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid Before Their Eyes they wept with a loud voice and many shout shouted aloud for Joy so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of Joy from the noise of the Weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard a far off so like verse 12 here it's telling us that there were some people ancient men like people that had like they they they old people you know they they experienced the first temple they they saw the glory of like we'll read the book of hegi right after this he he explains more what what is happening in this chapter CU like the chapter of the book of hegi Zechariah uh Ezra all those like it is happening around the same time so like verse 12 those ancient men they started weeping you know they started weeping because uh yeah we'll understand why they start they were weeping when we read the next uh uh book but um but what kept my attention here is that he says that uh there was a like they couldn't tell between the shout of joy and the Weeping there was a confusion you know there was like something like like some it was an uncertain sound like they they couldn't tell which one you know uh there was a confusion and what what was the confusion happening around that was at laying of the foundation right the Bible says that's when the builders laid the foundation on verse 10 after that then some people were crying and some other people were rejoicing but they couldn't tell which like what the sound was you know that's the same thing that's happening like that that that cuz we we're going to try to look at it physical and spiritual at the same time that's the same thing that's happening in our like in our day Lord like when the the Bible what the foundation of the Lord let just read uh the book of um I have this in my notes Here one second U chap Matthew chapter 16 verse1 17 and 18 cuz we're talking about laying the foundation right and then the Bible now let's let's see what the foundation is like in the Book of Matthew uh chapter 16:1 17 and 18 and the Bible says and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou Simon bjah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven can you uh go to the next one and I say unto thee that thou are Peter and up on this rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so we understand that the revelation of Jesus Christ of who Jesus Christ is is the foundation because Christ is building his church up on the revelation of who he is right so just like here there was a confusion there that's the same thing that that that's why like the devil tried to to change that that Foundation oh the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost or or like all those those those those things happening around the name of Jesus Christ right confusion but then we have a prophet that came and you know um showed us that like it's it's only one name it's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so uh that kind of caught my attention that verse you know that that there was a confusion when they were laying the foundation and um um uh if we go to if we keep reading the book of Ezra chapter 4 um because we understand that in chapter 4 there came like ad adversary adversity or opposition to the children of Israel you know like when they started building in the temple uh then they came like like they had to fight you know because like let just read what the Bible says verse one now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the Captivity builded the temple unto the Lord God of Israel then they came to zerubabel and to the chief of the fathers and said unto them let us build with you for we seek your God as ye do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of aseron king of Asher which brought us up here you know so we understand that there came like like the Bible called them adversaries in another uh version of the Bible I think the NIV says enemies you know the enemies of the children of Israel came they wanted to join them you know that's that's a tactic of the devil you know the prophet uh we'll read this one quotes where the Prophet says that Satan comes and tries to to use un Unity as his tactic you know we want to use the United Church they won't let us builds together after all we seek we serve the same God you see the Bible says here they say for we seek your God as you do you know they're saying that let us just unite because we after all we serving the same God right and uh uh like and that's that's what the devil is doing too in our in our day and um let's just read his quotes here chur Chans right exactly amen amen exactly so like like like let's read this one quote here where it says that um okay I have this here he says notice his plans is to build a super denominational Church the World Council of churches see a super denominate so that all the world will worship Him the Beast under the name of United Christianity that's what that's what these people Tred to do they were like they're saying we we we seeking the same God as you do but later on like the Bible says by their fruits you shall know who they are later on you you will see how they reacted toward the children of Israel it proved that they weren't serving the same God you know and um cuz like they like just like brother Isaac says oh come join this church come join this church and they they they try to to get us to believe that we are serving the same God we are actually not because in the Book of Revelation Christ is on the outside knocking you know he's knocking he's like he want to come in so then if he's on the outside then who are they worshiping right you know the the the devil has put them under that illusion that they're they're worshiping God they think they're worshiping God but they're not worshiping God right like the prophet says in the Satan's e and he says the God of this world today the the worshiped person of this world today is Satan and the people are ignorant of worshiping Satan but it's Satan impersonating himself as the church see as the church they worship Satan thinking that they are worshiping the god worshiping God through the church but it's the way Satan has done it right so like the prophet is telling out that those people they out there worshiping Satan but they think that they're worshiping God you know U okay let's see they think cuz and then that that that is um like I won't I won't quote it but it's in Revelation chapter 3:14 to20 where Jesus says that behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in uh to him and will stop with him and hear with me you know so we understand that Christ is on the outside right and um um second can you go to Second Thessalon Thessalonians uh chapter 2 verse 3- 4 where it says let let no man deceive you by any means for that they shall not come except there come except there come a falling away first and the man of sin be revealed the son of predition the no it says the man of sin be revealed so can you you go to the next verse here who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God Seth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God that's what that that's who they are worshiping that person who is like showing him himself as if he God he's impersonating God and those people without Revelation they are thinking that they are worshiping Christ but Christ is on the outside you know and who is Christ Christ is the word you know right so the word is on the outside knocking trying to get in but they have their own illusion that's so and they want to use the the same tactic let's we all Christian after all we're serving the same God no the word of God calls for separation with all unbelief God is a god of Separation right so if we continue to book of Ezra verse three but zerubabel um and Joshua and the rest of the of the chief of the fathers of Israel said unto them ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel as king Cyrus the King of Persia has commanded us so we understand that zerubabel told them that you have nothing to do with us you know this is our inheritance this is what we're supposed to do right so he turned down um uh the offer from the world right so let's let's move on verse four and six uh can someone read verse four and six um any volunteer yeah you can then people of the land weak of people of Judah them build and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus King of Persia even until the re of Darius King of Persia right yeah so so now we see what their their int intentions were right because you don't you we you don't want to join us then they they weaken the hands of the people you know hire counselor against them to frustr their purpose isn't that what the council ecumenical ecumenical council will do if we don't join us then you guys cannot worship anymore you you can we'll close the churches the Bible the prophet says that they'll be there'll be like the the pressure The Squeeze will be on on for the bride right you know they'll TR they'll start pressuring us because they were not of us in from the beginning you know so that's the same thing that's happening here and if we skip to verse 11 um interesting there says and they H counselors like lawyers right right con amen amen amen yeah so if we Skip and and we like I want read everything but like we understand that they are um so they they wrote a letter to the king you know to again like say negative things about the children of Israel and verse 11 it says this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him even unto Ares the king thy servant the man on his side be known unto the king that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem building the rebellious in the bad City and have set up the walls I think I'll just skip this uh it just it's a lot of accusation false accusations against the children of Israel and um let's skip to verse 23 and verse 24 now when the copy of King of the king's letter was read before rum and shimshai The Scribe and their companions they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews and made them to cease by force and power then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem so he ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius King of Persia you know so and then they oh after all we seeking the same God let us build the house of the Lord together no you guys wanted them to ceased because now because you couldn't work together then you the work of the house of God ceased you know it stopped pretty much right and um if we continue verse uh chapter 5 verse one then the prophet hegi the prophet and Zachariah the son of Ido prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the god of Israel even unto them then rose up zurubabel the son of Shel and Joshua the son of jedak and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem and with them were the prophet of God helping them right so like uh and and to understand the word that God uh spoke through the prophet hegi let's go to the book of hegi uh chapter one there go chapter one so we understand that if we like for instance Ezra chap chapter 5 verse 2 it says that then rose up Zer zerubabel the son of Shel you know and um and they started building the house of the Lord but the word that encouraged them was hegi chapter 2 verse one in the seventh month in the 1 and 20th day of the month came the word of the Lord by the prophet hegi saying speak now to zer the son of Shel governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of joseth the high priest and to the resid of the people saying who is left among you that saw this house in her first uh glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing and this I think from from what my Bible is referring like it's giving reference to Ezra chapter 3:12 so it's like when the the ancient men were crying you know for what they were seeing so like the B God is saying that who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison as nothing yet now be strong oh Zer sayth the Lord and be strong oh oh I was read reading I was reading chapter 2 so I meant to read chapter 3 so chap this chapter 2 was in reference to like I said earlier Ezra 3:12 but let's go to uh chapter 3 actually that's what I meant to read wait chapter 1 verse three hey chapter 1 verse3 yeah because we we stopped at Ezra chapter 5 verse one where the Bible says that you know there that cease to uh the work of the work of the temple and then the prophet had and Zechariah prophesied and then zerubabel started building the Temple so now let's read the word of that prophecy um chapter 1 verse 2 thus speaketh the Lord of host saying these people say the time is not come the time that the Lord's House should be built so that's what the children of Israel were saying when the the the work ceased they started thinking that oh the time is not come yet to build the Temple of the Lord you know now God didn't didn't like that God rebuked them because in verse three God is saying then came the word of the Lord by hegi the prophet saying is it time is it time for you or ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste you know now therefore thus sayith the Lord of host consider your ways you know go like the children of Israel they were just their priorities were not straight their priorities were just like taking care of their own houses you know and God is saying you guys are dwelling in Seal sealed houses and then my house is lying laying waste you know and he says ye verse six ye have sown much and bringing little ye eat but you have not enough you drink but you are not filled with drink you clothe you but there is none warm and he that earnthenecklace sayith the Lord of hosts consider your ways right so he's saying that like you you never you're not satisfied you drink you're not satisfied you eat you're not satisfied and and then you work but then it's like all the money that that that you work you just you can't even save you can't even do nothing with your money why because your prior their priorities were not straight you know the God was saying that you they should have taken care of also the house of the building the house of the Lord you know that's the same thing that's happening to there even with the spiritual house you know if you if you don't many of us we we we only like we're so worried about the things of like our like making sure that the garden the the grass is well taken care in the house you know the house is clean but what about this spiritual house God also want us to be to to work on this spiritual house to you know to build this house you know and um that so that was the same thing because I mean and then God told them consider your ways right go up to the mountain and bring wood and build a house and I will take pleasure in it and I will be glorified sayth the Lord so we understand that God is glorified and takes pleasure when we invest in building this this this house right you know this Temple and you look you look for much and L it came too little and when you brought it home I did blow it up on it why sayth the Lord of hosts because of mine house that is waste and you run every man onto his own house you know I like to read this in the NIV version like I just like the way he um he explained that uh NIV version okay let me go here so verse seven all right so let's go verse seven this is what the Lord Almighty says give careful thoughts to your ways go up into the mountains and break bring down Timber and build my house so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored sayth the Lord you expected much but see you turn out to be little what you brought home I blew away why declares the Lord Almighty because of my house which remains in ruin while each of you is busy with your own house you know I like the way he said it here each of you is busy with your own house oh yeah house amen bring into the amen we all worried about our own building our own amen amen amen any other comments amen so but that so that that's that's pretty much it right you know we we God is honor and pleased when we we invested in spiritual things you know like set your affection on things above right and and if we continue reading here it says that uh therefore Because Of You the heavens have withheld their due and the Earth its crops I called for a draw on the field and the mountains on the grain the new wine the olive oil and everything else the ground produces on people and livestock and on all the labor of your hands right so God you can even create a drought you know on on the works of your hand just because you you you not setting your priorities on things of above you know he God wants us to build this house you know to build this spiritual house you know and um yeah let's go back to um Ezra I think we almost at the endend uh Peter can I get the charger for my laptop it's about to go there but I'll just send this to my iPad so I can use it from my iPad yeah I'll just do it from here sorry about that so we are chapter 5 Ezra okay can someone read chapter 5 yes the first verse I believe is that where we left off three no I don't think we read three yet cuz that's talking about the Govern oh okay okay okay yes yes yes can you please at the same time to them T governor on this side of this side of the river and sheth BOS and their Companions and said thus unto them who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up this wall then said we unto them after this manner what are the names of the men that make this building the eyes of their God was upon the Elders of the Jews that they could not cause them toase till the matter came to Darius and then they returned answer by letter concerning this man right so so we see that like despite so like because the after the the work of the Lord had ceased God we just read the rebuke that God rebuked the children of Israel because they they were thinking that oh it's not time to BU at the house of the Lord yet but they had time to build their own houses right and then when the word of the Lord said that um zerubba was encouraged and he started building the the temple again right zerubabel and Joshua but then an opposition came again to show you that every time you want to work on build this Temple of the lord the devil will always try to fight you you know and like like we just read this time around that was another governor who said who gave you who who has commanded you to build this house then he wrote another letter to the king and we won't have time to read the entire letter I think it's in verse seven that they said they they sent a letter unto him wherein was written thus unto darus the king of all peace and then let's skip to verse 17 Ezra 5:1 17 now therefore if it seem good to the king Let There Be search made in the king's treasure okay now let's read verse oh yeah verse 17 so this is after they send the letter to the king you know the the the king he asked um zerubabel and Joshua you know like like I heard about this and that what are you guys saying and this is no this is the letter that they sent to the king saying to the king that if it seem good to the king Let There Be search made in the king's Treasure's house which is there at Babylon whether it be so that a decree was made of Cyrus the king King to build this house of God in Jerusalem and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter so what they were saying is that search because God God you know when God ask you to do anything he's he's provided he's given you everything you need already you know like God had inspired King Cyrus to write a decree and to store it in the treasures house because he knew that one day King s will will be dead but then his writing will be what will will counts right and but I what I love the most is when you go back to chapter one you know you just said it was King Cyrus but his word was inspired by the Lord you know so like the B because the Bible the Bible says in chapter one if you can read just like the first verse I think chapter one of that same book now the in the first year of Cyrus King of Persia that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be for fulfilled the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia you know that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put in also in writing saying right so it was the Lord that led King Cyrus to so it was it was an inspiration from the Lord in other words and and we know that the Bible says that all scripture is written you know by inspiration right so like and if we go back to this chapter five then zerubabel he asked okay let's search in the scriptures you know we want to build this Temple of the Lord there there's going to be an adversity that's going to arise and every time the adversity arises let's do like zobel let's let's refer back to the scripture what does the scripture what what does the decree say about this house this this this house right that's what they did and then later on on chapter six uh then Darius the king made a decree and search was made in the house and you can read this chapter 6 on your own but it's like amazing how like this King Darius he he even he even said he also made another decree saying that they can now build the house and that no one should add a word or or take a word take away a word from the new decree pretty much just like the re Revelation says no one should add to this word or take away from the word of God right and then they and then uh verse 14 and the Elders of the Jews builded and they prospered through the pro prophet prophesying of hegi the prophet and Zechariah the son of Ido and they build it and finished it according to the Commandment of the god of Israel and according to the Commandment of Cyrus and Darius and AR cus the King of Persia right so they they they they build it the house and they prospered through I love this they prospered through the prophesying so this the the they prospered through the spoken word through the word of God that's how they were able to build that their house the same way that they were able to build the house through the word of the prophet in the physical way we also are able to build this house upon the spoken word of God you know with the help of the spoken word of God you know that you got to keep reminding yourself scriptures you know and us it's that spoken amen true amen amen them to cease this time the second time they didn't listen they kept amen and so they had to so they kept working they had to send a letter to the king keep working amen the house amen amen amen and then and then I didn't even read the the other chap the entirety of chapter in hey but like the reason why they were able to do this is because the Lord encouraged them to tell them I am with you you know they they were fearing they they had a lot of things that were going through their mind but the Lord reassured them that I am the Lord and I'm with you and that's why now they have courage they have boldness to even write back to the king hey they they started reminding them of the promises you know and um you know like just to to to close it to summarize it like uh I was saying that this this time around we're not building physical houses or physical temples you know it's your body it's your your like let's let's go to the book of Acts 7 verse 46 um he says who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him in house how be the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as sayith the prophets Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stool what house will you build me you know sayith the Lord or what is the place of my rest so God is still looking for a house to be built for him right and um 1 Corinthians chapter 3:16-17 the Bible says that know ye not that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are you know God wants to build you into his full stature like into the stature of a perfect man and um I'll just read this um really the only thing that separate us from other denominations amen amen only God's not you're better in the amen amen God knows amen amen amen amen can you can you uh hide this uh I want to project the quotes it's not showing if if you go can you go to open LP no go to open LP where we put the songs but yeah it's it won't work but anyway let me just read read it just I I just wanted to show the the um the statue of a full perfect man and you know like that's the that's the temple that God wants to build right you know Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness broadly kindness Holy Spirit and love you know and you know we have to keep working till all these things are are there you know and God promised us that he's with us the good thing is that we not even the ones doing everything like you know the Bible says that he who started the good work his faithful to finish it you know so it's like those are the promises that we need to to remind ourselves right and um cuz that God is building a bride body you know she the prophet says she will be uh she will be the word made flesh um if can you go to the the the last quot Peter I'll just do it here open well it's not it's not but anyway uh the last quote says this it's in the message it is the rising of the sun um paragraph 111 it says and as he being the groom the bride has come forth has to come forth cuz it's part of him and he can only be the manifestation of the fulfill fulfilling of the revelations any others has spoken of the Bride it can only manifest if if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him you know so like Christ is he wants to build himself pretty much you know and uh because like the full stat of a perfect that's that's Jesus Christ right there you know that's all his character he had all this Faith virtue all that that was Jesus Christ and he want us to be like him because the bride we just read the prophecy say she is him you know the Book of Revelation chap 21: 2-3 it says and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride Adorn for her husband and I heard a great voice out of out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with man and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God right so um that's that's this study for today I encourage you guys to keep reading the book of Ezra and Zechariah um I I'll just end it here but like next time if I get a chance we'll read cuz we only read you know when they they stop building the temple the Bible says that zerubabel was encouraged by the prophesying of hegi and Zechariah right and then also Zechariah we see what happens if you can read it at home it's Zechariah Chapter 4 Verse 1-4 I love that chapter because that chapter talks pretty much even talks about the seven Church ages talks about the the SE the seventh messenger you know it's just amazing you know it talks about the two olive trees you know and then the old the prophet says he called that the Old Testament and the New Testament you know and it's just amazing next time we'll continue studying on it but I really appreciate your participation and are there any comments or questions EXC I love I loved every second
