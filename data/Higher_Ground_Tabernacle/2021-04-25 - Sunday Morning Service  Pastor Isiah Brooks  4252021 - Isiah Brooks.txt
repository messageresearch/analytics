standing won't take us long amen we have our brother john martin profile john martin we have our brother poppy from suey succeeding sioux and we have our brother jude murray and his wife elizabeth all the way from arizona arizona this is the brother who was uh and sister who i stayed with he's a real dear friend of mine and uh the lord blessed him he's traveling from chicago back home now eva about i'm still flying amen you love the lord we appreciate god for being so good to us let us turn by god's grace [Music] i just want everybody to know you are more than welcome you know um we thought wednesday would have a a bigger crowd since you guys haven't seen me in a while know wow and i also thought this morning would be a bigger crowd well one thing for certain some of you all miss me right ventral something hey we missed you we missed you as well and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and peter calling to remembrance said unto him master behold the fig tree which thou curses is withered and jesus answered said unto them have faith in god jesus [Music] for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he's saying therefore i say unto you what things so so ever ye desire when you pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them and quiet and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your transparency illustrates [Music] but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses let us pray father we so thank you for your goodness your grace and your mercy we pray father god that you will look beyond all of our faults see our needs this morning dear heavenly father shall be celeste dear precious lamb shall please sure you will open the seals but you are very very least released unto us oh the divine revelation of yourself we pray this morning that you would come and be with us elevate us lord kitchen take us higher kitchens father will be careful to give you the praise glory in jesus christ's name amen amen you may be seated god is so good to us and for those of you who were not here on wednesday we've been speaking basically on faith prior to our leaving many things happen in that way and in that area and then and then uh brother liz paul he from this paul i i taped that message to him and he said that he had been looking into faith and things of that nature and what was so marvelous is that we finally went to service there in uh arizona something because without faith is impossible to please him and you and i must understand that in faith lays our victory hello not a mind over matter not mind over matter okay we have been that we are no longer subject to the grips of the 7th church because you cannot receive this message abiding in that dimension this message submission takes us to a place nozap you cannot remain in this dimension and i explain to that that to you in a moment and expect to receive things that are of god the bible tells us that we are living in heavenly places in christ jesus on jesus christ that god didn't say we were visiting heavenly places the bible said we are living in heavenly places in christ jesus on jesus christ and so we understand that christ jesus is in a higher dimension he is literally above the sixth dimension remember the prophet of god he was in a dimension under the seventh [Music] and he wanted to see jesus jesus and the angel told him he lost ready amen that jesus was up higher oh y'all hear me now so we understand that there is a place that god is desiring his bride-to-be hallelujah remember the quote on wednesday [Music] now you may be earth in on earth in the natural hallelujah now how long it's been since you've traveled it commented on the prophet hallelujah when god wanted to show ezekiel i love ezekiel it is a very difficult book to understand the part that i do love about it is that god by the spirit [Music] and he told john is that right is it true that brother branham said that the bride john represents the bride represents hallelujah so if john had to come up i'll see john he sets on the right hand of the father that is figurative hallelujah because god's right hand is his authority what did you say to him hallelujah and when the word of god said all power in heaven and earth is given unto me that's what jesus said right [Music] as long as you listen to the fifth dimension as long as your influence is from the fifth dimension you will never climb hallelujah you see because we want to bring law into a place where god says it's grace can i say it like this it's even beyond grace it is election amen god by his foreknowledge chose you to be bribed before he gave you grace when people are still in the in being influenced by is that right confusion probably god said it like this whatever you are here is however you are there hallelujah and if if if you're in the that dimension don't sit down like that that dimensions that pulsates from hell don't pull the balance then your soul is still in prison sometimes we allow that dimension to influence our behavior sometimes we it's the places that we find comforts sometimes it's the people that we find confident in the first one hallelujah but understand this morning i are being influenced from one world or the other don't swap you're either being your knowledge from above that's what you're being influenced oh god help us here first peter 1 15 through 16. hallelujah as we were saying wednesday commodity there's nothing wrong with the message there's nothing hallelujah because the outer court uh on the other the it's where you particular you you you you're basically naked hallelujah but when you get into the hole is of holy because in heaven they don't need breath it's only in this dimension hallelujah so what is he talking about he's talking of without satan trying to influence you you might as well stop hallelujah even though christ has defeated him hallelujah he's still the ruler he continues come out but god has given the believers something major abnormal [Music] yes not like a witch of some sort but the first peter 1 15 through 16. as he which have called you is holy me so be holy in all manner of conversation because it [Music] hallelujah and when god looks at you he sees the token he's what you see he's the light and you are holy sound y'all hear what i'm saying because i god sees because you think your clothing makes you holy there are there are no such a thing to choose from this dimension as holy garments come on [Music] what makes you holy he is a devil if the devil says you've got a headache against christians you must understand that that is a lie because with his stripes [Music] but you and i must believe [Music] [Applause] is you know what i'm saying it's like when you find something funny are you kidding me yeah you can't be real no you know what i'm saying it'd be something like this threatening that's what gets me sometimes when you see a true christian and they're just so terrified spiders i said you have the liberty to leave right now but if you're here when i come back you're mine right you are mine you up yeah yeah that's how you handle demons hallelujah and when you resist the devil god fights for your [Music] and i put some peanut butter on it i know this is off the message i'm trying to tell you just like i entrap the but we the bible said perfect love casts out fear and you guys have heard me it doesn't mean that fear is not going to come so when it does there's a there's an entity there's a god inside and that's good thrust him out of your atmosphere hallelujah you love the lord let me read romans please try not to be too much longer but i want to come to something because like i said we'll be ministering this evening as well and i just got a thought i'm trying to pull together revelation that god gives you by way of the sermon [Music] this is why preaching is important i might preach a section of a message [Music] he appeared and revealed himself various people in different ways hallelujah is that right on the road to email he revealed himself as a stranger hallelujah but when they were all in one place [Music] they all knew that he was alive and well yeah that is how the seven seals work so this is what messes people's minds up to reveal his secrets to you guess what you only know that the seventh seal has been opened you're part of it [Music] by whom also we have access by faith into his grace within we stand in hope of the glory of god not only so but with glory and tribulation also knowing that the tribulation work with patience perseverance perseverance and make it not a shame oh let's be honest because the love of god is shared abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us hallelujah in other words you're going to go through something but you know when we go through these trials we are justified and the first thing we do believe god's word what did i do to deserve this. you didn't do anything and many of our trials come because we pray lord i want to be just like come on somebody don't pray that if you don't want to be just like us and if you want to be just like us understand you're giving him permission to take yoga [Music] i realize one thing [Music] that he let in he left in the word that all things that you see work it for our good in other words that which satan for destruction god means good jew is that right now i'm going to move further i should say the bible says let this mind be in you let's go which was also in christ jesus let's go let's put you down philippians 2 5 through 7 who being in the form of god form of this thought not robbery jesus christ jesus christ not robbery when esther wanted to bring in the wine banquet for the king i had us you serious hallelujah and when the king put forth his hand let her put forth her hand excuse me and she put her hand on top of the uh scepter at that time yesterday they became john s what would you have of me she said i am going to have a real shouting good wine banquet she says now i want you to know i want you to come to my place somebody help me here see that is the way prayer is supposed to be you don't have to wait to use summons to pray you ought to go in and pray [Music] hallelujah into god don't be able to until god comes down is that right that's hallelujah and what did she say lord senora i just want you to come bring hamon with you let the devil come that's good i want the devil to know how much i love you and in his presence i'm going to worship you i want him to sit on the sideline you are the sentiment of my joy us yeah he said i'm going to give you the half of the kingdom [Applause] you understand me see the problem is the department we don't know he's already given us the half of the kingdom we are the king hallelujah is that right why did jesus christ jesus christ named you after him because there is no other name under heaven where we must be saved hallelujah let this mind let's really speak jesus never was defeated jesus christ and his faith was never disturbed it's a foreign abraham had undisturbed faith abraham avi and if you are abraham's sin faith no matter what satan does you keep your eyes on the how they had so much god in them reflected the fourth man in the fire look at him it wasn't three in the fire that fire reflected his image what was that that was a different that represented jesus christ that's what i'm talking about but god can live so much of you hallelujah that when people see you you say brother brooks i don't know about that brother branham talks about that woman who needed medication her husband tried to get it that he could not give discounts the man said when he went to give her the description that he actually saw the hands of jesus he said brother you believe that when i'm too quiet hallelujah what was it that was a dimensional thing hallelujah everybody can't see it even when there was a pillow fire was in the audience you see that can't you see that everybody couldn't see it they're high enough but for those who are high in them hallelujah that's what i'm talking about so you say what happened made esther equal i'm not going to preach on that but i just wanted you here was a prophet by the name of abraham who lied hallelujah let me go head on now let's see let me read a quote to make somebody's happy say that player coming from the easter seal 1965. another soldier back he said but we do one thing and he's talking about mount transfiguration we've read this quote but when they looked around with all this power upon them [Music] don't care whether he's back backing up a denomination for you to see that glorified christ making [Music] you jesus christ jesus it didn't glorify moses didn't glorify elijah hallelujah it didn't glorify themselves didn't glorify nothing else but they sing the glorified cry and and any true believer that's what's in his heart it's a glorified jesus christ glory to jesus hallelujah amen it's not enough i see to have his pictures on the wall somebody help me here because you wear a cross around your neck does [Music] the bible says that neither is their salvation [Music] hallelujah given to me hallelujah about the name of jesus christ i make a lot of people mad when i started getting on this level you got to come up higher if you're really going to marry him oh somebody help me here you got to come up into another dimension yes it's the truth it's the truth you know this is why paul in hebrews both don't listen therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on into perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and faith toward god it's amazing dead works your works are dead your works are dead there for some month well i do this and i do that your works are dead dead works just on these over months one of these dave we're going to understand how free we are learn decisions we're going to understand and see that's why when you don't believe that you're free yeah when you think it's your works hallelujah you're going to be sad because you're going to make mistakes every day yes anybody in here that don't you you there yet let's go no mistakes where are you i want to know how you're doing that hallelujah of the doctrine of baptisms and the laying of hands and hands and the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment i'm not in that dimension i'm not [Music] was your judgment i'll tell you when my was deal when i was willing to yield to the holy spirit when i confess that jesus christ was my lord and savior you're here to stay in his presence hallelujah let me hurry up because this is the part that i really want to get the message is more about the ain't about keeping up uh uh up with the time and the calendar heading with the message about uh the message you know a lot of people say well when this kid had this happen then i get right you know many of us trying to wait for the california earthquake or something i don't know oh you know the message is not watching israel but that's not your time piece to know when i need to get right back but we look at these things and we say oh that's it's not in the regard not not this life eternal life and that came by the opening [Music] you know being a message preacher don't even make you in the message oh i'm a preacher that's what the pharisees and the sadducees [Music] it's always good to know what you should do and what you shouldn't do on earth that didn't make heaven either hallelujah the more truth you don't have to be mean to preach the word you don't have to be mean to preach the word like i was telling somebody the word is the word [Music] you know and it's true i've been you see what the fifth dimension doing to us now so this is good stirring up here you all hear me and i'm gonna tell you something brother the political and i'm not going to preach on politics but he said they both are rotting to the core looking at people like oh my hero there's [Music] it was when jesus left off the scene brother talks about it and when he left off the scene the disciples forgot he was in the ship them it said ye of little faith there you go where did you doubt so let me let me show you where god is please stop listen brother spoke he prayed for those who had crossed [Music] eyeshadow hallelujah he created things that created the show by speaking the words and those squirrels came into existence you understand me [Music] you've already excuse me i said he's just here but in the rising of the sun don't do the video he said when jesus was resurrected amen amen hallelujah so what are you saying you are the resurrection amen but when you receive the holy ghost you have already resurrected amen hallelujah that was what he wanted to see not some garment of sackcloth and ashes god wants to see a garment of prey [Music] [Music] i'm going to see the king amen see god is more concerned about your inner man with appearance he told the pharisees to clean up the cups i'm talking about his righteousness as long as that desire is there yes lord is i'll stop here on this one i know y'all going to just rush on out the building and go home all of that you know what it ain't happening because y'all going to go right out there and you're going to talk about 30 to 40 minutes you know i need the time y'all i just need the time so just give me a few more minutes and then you can go get amen let's turn to luke 12. what i want you to understand aim to release you from feeling oh god can i can i live righteous enough how many of y'all can live righteously enough the bible said that our righteousness is oh a treasure in the heavens that faileth not resort where no thief approaches neither moth corrupt where your treasure is will your most people are not challenged until god requires you to give some of your stuff away the greatest challenge of the rich young ruler was to give his stuff away [Music] y'all don't believe it let me tell you show you how much mind power you have this month you will ride down the road not even hungry and burger king burger king popeyes or something voip your favorite food you're not even hungry but just to show you how easy it is for the devil to take your will away and just a whoop of that whiff of that smell and then all of a sudden you see that beautiful fried chicken on the side what happened the devil just took your will away i'm just trying to show you how he manipulates us every day oh this is my last donut yeah y'all understand me but your last donut is not your last name and i'm not trying to be funny i'm just trying to show you how easy it is to be manipulated manipulation we'll see somebody on need in need the holy ghost says stop and give that beggar twenty dollars you know in the devil you know he got more money somewhere your twenty dollar ain't the only one he's getting today and then oh no he ain't getting my twenty dollars you know but we failed to see why 99 of the time i won't say i've been perfect no no but when the holy ghost inspires me you say well how do you know it's the holy ghost because when you pass that person she is a virgin because she knows no man creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be made manifest so understand this everything that god is looking for [Music] says leave it to me it was less what christ is saying leave it to me don't you worry of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be made manifest in the virgin manifesto everything he promised that will occur in the bride it is happening hallelujah why because it's a word of promise abraham i promise you abrahams hallelujah jesus promised us jesus hallelujah so he works according to his promise but we must come up higher all right let me show you what i'm trying to say i'm just going to leave this right off we'll finish this evening by the grace of god the holy ghost is supposed to take away the condemnation from you ain't got god in you if you don't feel convicted if you're doing wrong if you can just willfully go out here and sin and don't feel no condemnation because the holy ghost is always right amen so but how can this message ever live if you just believe in it with your head you understand me so if your prayer life is lacking you you've you've you've been told a lie by the devil christ himself oh jesus christ it's going to tell you to pray without ceasing he didn't say cease from prayer but pray without ceasing and how in the world we think we're going anywhere of this hour is not to pray with your experience y'all better hear what i'm saying for the abomination done in the city we'll finish up this evening that we've got to look through this message and see the promises if one we must allow god to quicken this day to us this is the only way it's gonna come that's why i don't pay attention to what other people are doing i concentrate on this man hallelujah because people are going to do what they want to do well they're supposed to be in the message hallelujah you know i look at this thing and i'm just so i guess it shows thanking god for his grace and his mercy didn't mean to go so long somebody to sing that song for us and i hope you got time for another song do you one more song and i promise you it'll be one of those songs you won't be able to sit down the song we sang
