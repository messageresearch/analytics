to god as we said we have our brother simon smith we appreciate him when i was in lima the lord blessed him to be part of the ministry there some of y'all know his brother jesse and his other brother cam the smith brothers they are well known and we appreciated everything that god is doing one thing i know i was just crying out this morning because something's coming and you better have the goods if all you have is an intellectual revelation of this message you're not going to be able to stand if all you have is a revelation that god sent a prophet [Music] i'm looking forward to the translation i don't live more hallelujah in the presence as our brother come on [Music] prince of peace [Music] amazing [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] in [Music] oh he's wonderful [Music] three [Music] [Music] it was the most holy the most serious time [Music] guaranteed tomorrow [Music] but when we come into the house of god we look here to amen and that's our sole purpose everything that took place before this morning yesterday gone i explained to the saints of god who showed up last night i'm not a singer i'm just speaking with saying i'm so thankful for this brother here i don't have that kind of gift okay all right so if you guys want to be seated there we'll go right into the word of god being that we're going to go through an interpreter this morning i'm going to do my best here to stay right here in in and brother isaiah a wonderful man of god [Music] when i prayed for truth for three and a half months i said lord if this is not the truth send me the truth no matter how crazy it is i believe it three and a half months later within that time range he sent me underneath brother brooks a man a real serious man of god unknown amen so let's get started here everybody got their bibles their word ready to go amen now this is uh a story here that uh you see uh sometimes you there's questions in the bible you read things and you just wonder what they mean and you gotta wait for an answer from god i'm a man that has a spiritual shelf that can just hold everything lord i don't know this and i don't understand what about this and what about this person king shelf over here captain shelf all right so this study came to me a city a minister had come to our assembly and i was speaking with him afterwards and he said unto me he said he said uh a certain thing he said a certain sentence here but he shared this sentence and i actually disagreed with it [Music] and i said no i think it's you see and i thought lord why did he say that and i put it on a shelf so i'm going to show you what the lord brought off the shelf in revelations 5 apocalypse and for the sake of time and the i don't want anything get lost in the translation we'll read just a couple verses all right in revelation 5 verse 1. and i saw on the right hand of him and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof was able to open the book neither to look they're wrong [Music] and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book and to read the book neither to look they're wrong and one of the elders sayeth unto me he said weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven seals thereof that has taken place already so that would place us in those days and if we could go to revelations 10 verses 1 we'll read two verses and we'll say a word of prayer and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven close with a cloud and and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth let's say a word of prayer dearly father lord jesus lord we surely appreciate your lord and we are grateful to you lord god we want to magnify you today and lord we want to lift only the name of jesus christ lord that is the only name of the heaven where might be the same saved god i can point to thee and lord jesus lord just anoint my brother here exactly beside me here god and lord knowing me god lord jesus christ get beside ourselves your god convey your thought lord for this morning your man the lord may they receive it lord with his joy and lord bless every soul that gives you shall come in the name of jesus christ jesus christ amen amen amen you have received us all i explained there last night how i'm uh i just stayed i would just say you know there's we don't we're taught about you know the five-fold ministry pastors evangelists those sort of brothers and then there's that little one that little teacher that they have and they even even when they break it down in the hand you know that you know how they go and then they say the teacher is that one that's just hanging there on the edge you know i'm trusting everyone's studied they they've heard the sermons they've heard the message and if you're a visitor this morning i just the reason i brought those scriptures in revelations 5. because we want to show a position here something that has taken place in time the god there was actually an act that took place back all the way back in 1963 there was a man of god here you see and if you he felt a poll all the way back in 1960 and he said he said the reason we're preaching it he says so we can get to see what the spirit have to say about it and as he preached those sermons one by one we've seen what the spirit unfolded and some people may be uh against or or not for the the church age book yeah you know well the church age book is written different than the sermons the tapes but remember in the very first service the revelation of jesus christ of jesus christ the man of god said he said i'm going to preach this you see he said but the book would be written out in more detail amen and all that came up to pass right there and then in 1963 now the prophets feel the pole there's something huge and as the spirit would lead him now he come now to the point of the breaking of the seven seals we're not up in heaven right now but we're actually in heavenly places down here on earth we're still trying to get along with one another [Music] some of the things that the word of god would say would take place in the time of the open book now one of the things i want to talk about here is in revelations 10 verse 6 in revelations 10 verse 6 he says and and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and all things that are therein are in the earth and the things that that there in our and the sea later and the things that are which are therein that time should be no longer it's over opening of the book marked the time or the season that this thing is going to end in the sixties it only [Music] god was setting the stage now for something great there is a promise for the rapture there is a promise for the body change but the time is over it's running out literally we are done now i want to get into this in i'm going to try and do my best here by the grace of god yes sure okay in ezekiel 1. did you know ezekiel 1 if you read that whole chapter the entire book relieved there are many many things hidden in that book that in fact god hand picked this man his name was ezekiel and the very name ezekiel you know what the name ezekiel means god will strengthen the prophet he said he said remember he said he said then the bride when he said he's the bride would look like it's just slugging along but god will strengthen you the bible says to wait on the lord my pastor back home was dealing with the seven attributes the statue of perfect man and when he got to the virtue you know what patience is all really about passions have patience with jesus christ of christ have patience with god but in ezekiel now here's how my story went okay had said this thing to me and it didn't set well with me i got to sleep in everybody knows sleeping in like you sleep a little bit longer than you should do [Music] i got a rest and i woke up and he lives by a man-made lake and when i'm driving so i saw the name amber amber and i went my mind went it write to me in the book of ezekiel ezekiel saw god the color amber yes amen now and as we saw like i instantly i was like whoa i i ran back to brother randy's house i sat down of why this brother would say a certain thing to me i'm not condemning this brother i know the influences amen now so let's run through do you mind taking a little trip with me through ezekiel see what's in there what else is going to happen now when when ezekiel had come and the revelation to come and and he caught the revelation of the open book ezekiel was in captivity as well and that open book was sent to him amen and it was hand delivered to the prophet and he ate the book and god said he said it's full of woes and lamentations there's hard things written in there and he said he said i've said this book so you can eat it that is you don't see the so hard i can't even take the mark of the beast amen now so we see as we as we if you when you get home read the book of ezekiel i see what it's for that day but i do not know what it was for this day but in chapter five at the coming destruction of israel destruction israel and now remember all the gentiles will trod over that holy city for three and a half years and then in chapter six it shows judgment striking amen amen now notice here in ezekiel 7. it says he says moreover the word the lord came unto me he says also thou son of man thus saith the lord god unto the land of israel israel and end the end has come upon the four corners of the land it's coming and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth i thank you for watching but now as we move further in now into verse three notice the word of god now declares that as he's eaten the book the end has come he says this now remember as as he comes he's going to switch from high priest what to judge i'll remind you this took place a year ago one year ago september is when god kind of opened this up to me [Applause] at this time it is over and he says a great evil is coming an evil that can only come from satan himself does not care about any form of life but the judgment strike right away in the book of ezekiel it did not strike right away there is a time of lingering because the prophet had called the word of god he had blasted it out now what will the people do remember the man that was here to try the people where they do everything that god commanded us to do as the time draws closer and closer as he says the evil is coming he actually tells us what is going to happen in verse 10 says behold the day behold it is come the morning has gone forth the rod has blossomed la verger flurry and pride had blooded the people who received the word of god in this day have we become puffed up and they said that the the phrase now is brian pride some of you argue do they walk around the world in their their lives the word to me has pride butted in our hearts simple now let's move on here you have one song after god pronounces in chapter 7 that a great evil a great evil great evil is coming now remember the bible says the judgment it must come to the house of god first and he takes him to the house of god he does not take him in our day to the vatican doesn't take him to the white house but he takes him to jerusalem the very land that god gave abraham the very land that was called the promised land and that is where the house of god was supposed to be set up all of israel would come to jerusalem and put that blood for a covering of their sins but even in this day as god would take the prophet now to the house of prophets now remember it was not in the house of god the image was propped out outside on the other side so the first thing we saw when we come to the house of god was that image city but notice that image was not on the east side it wasn't on the west side of esther it was not on the south side but it was on the north side and they said like and god calls it an image of jealousy and the bible said that god will share his glory with no one let's see here he called it an image of jealousy saints of god we must be very careful on what we lift up will there be a man whatever the first thing when we come to the house of god we must be worshiping jesus christ on pleasing him or worshiping him on glorifying our god amen amen okay now and god said that was an abomination he called that image in abomination but you know what he said he said let me show you something greater abomination and what was worse than that they had this image and the people would come to the house of god and say oh look at this thing that the people did not even notice that the house of god was blocked they could not even get into the house of god but god said ezekiel break it open uh dig through it he's going through it easy and he found the door and god said now open that door and go and see something worse than that image um what i'm saying here excuse me apply to our day the bible says it just takes a little bit of wisdom to rev to understand who revelation 17 is they foreign who revelation 17 was before the malachi 4. you know in the book of revelations chapter 2 foreign he said he must have been like one of those believers that lived james too because remember he was in the seat in the house of satan himself antipas means anti-papa he was anti-pope hey man i like that uh praise the lord now so as ezekiel now busts through this door i want to show you what he finds a different way here of teaching by the grace of god let me find the scripture here in ezekiel 8 9. now remember he's coming to the house of god that was dedicated by salomon it was broken down this is where we're supposed to find the very mind of god remember if you went to the holy holies without them bells and pomegranates saying holy holy holy yeah and if you forgot to bring the blood you were dead but as he goes now first into the first chamber in verse 9. he said unto me [Applause] and the uniting of christianity with babylonians he says the net results there are actually three i taught a study on staying away from the appearance of evil and the scripture says the appearance so it's something we can see you don't even have to hear it remember the serpent in the garden of eden in genesis 3. was there an action before he spoke that serpent had to move himself out from outside the garden and he had to make his way into the garden of eden why is the serpent going into the garden the appearance of evil you know the prophet of god said there's three things that the there are deeds and nicolaitans he said the first one is they form groups groups of ministers groups you know what that means they've drawn their circle much like ezekiel and the second one is within their groups the man of god said that they start ranking one another and this man will preach on a friday and this one will never get a friday but he'll get a thursday or sunday morning saturday morning but always saturday service oh selfies let the lord lead you and guide you on that amen i'm going to stop right there in the days of the open book as this time would linger on but continue but as the true house of god now notice this was not a babylonian church he's dealing with the word of god that come in this day had those that received the open book and we see that after god shows him the the degradation there in the house of god in the late 1800s and their testimony says it was divine intervention but even back in the 1920s he found out a certain man was a jesuit and went to his house hello sir well hello hey are you his whole basement walls were lined with files file cabinets did you were born on such and such and such visiting [Music] you've worked here and here and here you've got baptized here and here and here you're married to so-and-so and so us and here's what's more scary missing the rapture hey man now is that okay i'm always trying to okay i'm just telling you the this is the time notice it says the abomination is done in the city in jerusalem there are lost people in the message there are lost people attending and the bible says to cry out for the people and we have to be led of the spirit this had to be a leader of god and those who died allowed to get into that spirit of i was like this calling out for your brother is [Music] two times in the message the prophet said yeah the prophet everybody got he said raise your hands if you got the holy ghost with memphis he said he said everybody raise your hand he said now let me test you listen he said who here sighs and cries for vampires he says how many hands would go up then [Music] god help us god help us say ma'am so as we move on here i find my spot here i want to show you this by the grace of god you know the prophet of god you know there's a way to weaken what did they do with our food here in america just confess they stripped the vitamins and nutrients they stripped it and that leaves us weakened and you can actually do that spiritually as well you see and then uh i'll say like this 1965 does god ever change his mind about the words and he said he says balaam succeeded in weakening israel israel he said he weakened their camp and you know the bra the prophet of god said it was the prophet he said it was a doctrine he says when some doctrine starts certainly now what i'll say like this what did that brother tell me a year ago i'm going to tell you what he has told me because i'm not saying i'm captain discernment or anything captain the the sermon and the brother was quoting this quote and and now remember i came in the i came to message 2001 2002. i have been serving god as best i can for 20 years and when we came in i thought i thought george w was the guy in prosperity kicks and i'm thinking lord how much time do we have and we're talking about how man businesses are going well we've been looking for him right now it could be 500 years old it could be a thousand years and if i was to say to you today we have plenty of time you know the prophet said it could be 50 more years i'll be in glory by then but what would that do to me it felt like he was trying to calm my spirit um i don't worry about it we i think we've been killed plenty of times the generation that sees the fig tree blooming they're all things and i disagreed with him i said brother i'd be surprised if we had five years later that was last that was actually a year and a half ago that's the uno and me and then i let that quote set on there why did why in fact why did this minister say this to me because i i i am at the belief that this can happen at any moment but did you know in the book of ezekiel in chapter 12 he says in the word of the lord came unto me son of man he says what is that proverb that you have in the land of israel saying the days are prolonged and every vision faileth oh my well you know ezekiel caught that revelation he that scroll came down he ate it and it's been years we got trump in here everything you see and if you actually study that chapter remember in chapter 8 of god and he actually finds three sets of men i'll say like this one set a set of women and a set of men that has defiled the house of god but this saying go build your big houses whatever you if they open books here you live you know what the prophet said about that because he called it out i'm not saying that i'm just rea he said they built these million dollar buildings because they really don't believe it because prosperity but they forget what aids when i was standing back there when brother brooks was singing the holy ghost that is more valuable just being right there in the holy ghost when you receive the holy when you talk about receiving the holy ghost you can compare [Music] see i was down at a certain camp and my brother had something and his voice cracked in this and that he's white and people say oh he but you know that was he's not a good singer and my brother nothing but divine love [Music] and the bible said he feared to go to death amen amen what time is it how long have i been can you guys go for a little bit longer could you put up the uh i want to show you another thing here okay and it's kind of the first two might be a little tricky okay i'm going to show you diagrams okay and you have to break them down all right is that okay okay remember i'm a teacher right here go to this one 24 brother yes right here now notice can everyone see that i'm sorry if i'm too okay let's do a little teaching everybody i i should teach bibles now i'm going to run a couple things and i'm going to question you okay now this is very important scripture here in first thessalonians five verses and the very god of peace and i pray god your whole spirit is soul and body vote be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ now why i am why am i going to go here now [Applause] a little bit further in the days of the open book it was sacred and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will you die oh house of israel he's talking to his children is that a converted person is in person converting no it's not no and yet they're there in ezekiel 36. verse 25 oversee [Applause] in a new heart will i give unto you spiritual going on here and the spirit will i put in a new spirit will i put in you and i'll take away the stony flesh your heart the revelation comes that he says but i will appreciate my spirit within you so in this days is the time to receive the baptism but we must cleanse ourselves thank you wonderful job you're doing here brother i'm sorry if i'm me let's go to 25 there yeah now the prophet of god is dealing with how we're built we've built three he said on the inside that man is called spirit and he has five senses right that's thanks okay then he goes the second round then the second round jump to number 26 we're gonna have a little quiz this is a little study here okay number 26 brother let's see oh oh let's start right there that's good that's good good swinging pop does everyone understand this you see this is this is visually how we're really set up okay this is what the word of god brought to us this is the true understanding notice the body realm right there this is simple and that seed is a predestinated seeds brother what is this oh guess you see i've driven i've drawn it out here this is the mat i max my art skills out right here here we have a a being this is a being here's the sinful flesh a sinful spirit realm but notice can you identify this species is this space anyone just shoot us a shout out do you know what this is crazy this is an animal sassy this is an animal notice no soul this uh dinosaur that's fine too or uh name whatever creature starts with d so now next slide here everybody understand that now that's the pattern we're going to go with okay [Applause] [Music] thousands brother that's it he says now the prophet said he says an ignorant animal not even a soul an animal doesn't know right from wrong who is this yes use your massive theology theological message thinking caps here these are two people in the bible there's two people in the bible sinless flesh holy spirit next slide brother now look at the prophet god he had the holy ghost potentially he did not have the holy ghost he had a place for it okay next slide who is this notice we moved on here sinful flesh sinful spirit notice not just faith but now we have faith this is the unconverted next notice here what the scripture says there is a difference also between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman cares for the things of the world or sorry for the things of the lord that she may be holy in body and spirit offended consent due to because when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost john you just got to keep two realms clean yes next slide brother who is this a person faith and unbelief dwelling in the soul realm and as we say we as we teach bible studies how did that seed ever get through he said he got through the prophet said to god he said he's that that seedline got through the ark through the woman cain got through eve got through to the women he said next slide next slide who is this is could you go to slideshow and hit start at at a certain location oh they're doing the best they can god bless them okay who is this person sinless flesh sinless spirit no unbelief only faith next slide brother next slide this is all teaching stuff here next slide next slide keep going right there no no next slide who is this he says and notice there is a red seal around here and not only a seal but there's something else genetically involved with this person genetics totally different genetics even though there's only one thing different you know some forms of cheese are one molecule from plastic so you could form a cheese that's the truth this is a holy ghost filled believer right here is next slide why is it so important to receive the holy ghost because if you read matthew 25 matthew 25 is the marriage supper it's a marriage move jesus is coming for a bride it's a marriage ceremony it's in ceremony it's a marriage scene and if he's looking for someone like him he can only bring he can only marry someone of his kind of space he can only marry someone that's similar in genetics he will not choose anyone that's not like him amen amen and that should do for that form of teaching now i want to hit one more thing here so in the days of the open book the baptism the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost the mystery but that we know is not a converted person but why does he give you a new heart and a new spirit the prophet of god says so eat so you can get along with the holy ghost well the last things i want to show you in this day's the open book how many have won a soul to the lord this year isaiah how about the last two years there we go winning three praise god god where i'll take this where are the droves how come there's billions of people and no one wants god in ezekiel 14. the bible said it would be like this very very few people saved it would be extremely tough to save an individual is he says or if i bring a sword upon the land and say sword go through the land so that i cut off man and beast from it next and notice what the word of god though noah they shall deliver neither son nor daughter even fear they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness in the days of the open book it would be so bad he daniel the one who interceded for his people daniel job the one that laid the sacrifices for his children um they knew how to get people saved in the darkest of times but the bible says also we have greater more exceeding promises the bible says when you read to be baptized in the name of jesus christ that promise should be to your your family vote for me your loved ones and to all that are far off god will give us what we desire i believe i believe and the spirit of god said they'll be back when the evening shadows fall once these things start getting bad brother said the other day and it was a phenomenal statement he said look at 911 he probably told me 911. church is packed only those that have the baptism of the holy spirit living breathing through you will be worthy to escape judgment [Applause] but remember that time that just lingered thank you don't continue if you have any fire in you if you have any burden for the soul keep [Music] [Applause] [Music] don't let anyone try and cool you down [Music] there's [Music] [Music] [Music] lord [Music] this is [Music] [Music] [Music] wrong with a horse you
