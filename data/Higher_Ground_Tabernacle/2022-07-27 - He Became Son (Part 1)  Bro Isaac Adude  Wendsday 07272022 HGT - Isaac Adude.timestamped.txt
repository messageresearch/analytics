[36:22] more time
[36:24] amen without uh taking too much time
[36:27] let's go straight to the word
[36:30] director
[36:31] amen we will open our bibles in the book
[36:34] of john saint john chapter 1
[36:38] amen we read this verse uh on sunday
[36:41] when we preached
[36:43] with demons
[36:45] amen will try to continue with the same
[36:47] thought john construct
[36:49] amen and we'll start from here saint
[36:52] john chapter one we read the verse 1 and
[36:54] the verse 14.
[37:00] of the same chapter
[37:04] amen the bible says that in the
[37:06] beginning was the word and the word was
[37:08] with god and the word was god.
[37:15] now verse 14 the bible says again and
[37:17] the word and the word was made flesh and
[37:20] dwelt among us and we beheld this glory
[37:23] the glory of the only begotten of the
[37:25] father full of grace and truth
[37:34] in glory
[37:49] zombies says young version
[37:51] first timothy chapter three verse 16.
[37:56] amen the bible says and with that
[37:58] controversy great is the mystery of
[38:00] godliness god was manifest in the flesh
[38:03] justifying the spirit
[38:05] sin of angels preached unto the gentiles
[38:08] believed
[38:09] believed on in the world received up
[38:12] into glory
[38:31] or to say thank you
[38:33] for the mercy lord thank you for
[38:35] everything that you have done for us
[38:39] lord we pray father god that the same
[38:41] spirit o father
[38:45] lord that god
[38:46] with us so father god during the song
[38:47] service
[38:50] lord be with us lord again
[38:53] but we pray father god that you have the
[38:54] preeminence of the service of god
[38:58] lord and you'll be exalted above all
[39:01] lord i pray father god that you help me
[39:03] lord man
[39:05] lord to be so sensitive to the holy
[39:06] spirit
[39:08] lord so that i can say whatever you want
[39:10] me to say lord
[39:11] lord i pray for the hearts that will
[39:13] hear the word
[39:16] don't let this word just be a knowledge
[39:20] or something that will help us
[39:22] understanding only okay
[39:24] the lord let us father god change our
[39:26] hearts
[39:37] this evening uh we have a little subject
[39:39] a little subject that we wanted to talk
[39:41] about
[39:45] i intelligent he became son
[39:50] when he became son
[39:53] amen still going with the same uh
[39:56] thought that we had last sunday when we
[39:58] praised continue
[40:02] amen as a review uh of what we preached
[40:04] on sunday
[40:24] amen before everything was created
[40:27] amen before even time began
[40:30] when god was a thought dreading amen and
[40:33] then that thought expressed itself he
[40:36] said
[40:43] and from that time that's when time
[40:45] began it is
[40:46] likely
[40:47] amen that's when john wrote here in john
[40:50] chapter one verse one that in the
[40:52] beginning was the word
[40:57] amen that was when god spoke the word
[41:00] that's when time began
[41:03] amen and then that same god is
[41:05] remembered amen who was a thought
[41:08] amen who became the word
[41:11] has now become flesh
[41:16] and then has lived with us
[41:26] amen will try to go by the grace of god
[41:28] with that word with that uh idea it's a
[41:30] long constructivity amen of god
[42:00] being the eternal god who was mercury
[42:07] amen because the bible says that men
[42:08] cancer they had no beginning of time and
[42:10] no end of days
[42:14] amen so it was impossible for mercury to
[42:17] feel what we were feeling
[42:22] it was impossible for him to be sick
[42:26] and it was impossible for him to be
[42:28] hungry
[42:35] became flesh as john is telling us here
[42:38] in chapter 1 verse 14.
[42:56] feel
[42:58] meant to be tempted as we are tempted
[43:02] to be tried as we are trying
[43:05] to be hungry as we get hungry
[43:08] it meant to be sick as we are sick
[43:25] sinless
[43:27] and him and he didn't have a house
[43:30] so that we can have a house
[43:33] he didn't have a family or nobody
[43:35] received him
[43:37] he was rejected of his own brothers
[43:40] women to accept he has his bride
[43:43] that's the reason why he had to become
[43:45] son
[43:47] that's the reason why he had to become a
[43:49] flesh
[43:52] for us
[44:20] foreign
[44:25] that we have a great high priest
[44:28] that is passed into the heavens jesus
[44:30] the son of god
[44:32] let us hold first our profession
[44:35] [Music]
[44:46] which cannot be attached with the
[44:48] feelings of our infirmities
[44:55] but was in no points tempted like as we
[44:58] are yet without sin
[45:05] so now let us therefore come boldly
[45:08] unto the throne of grace that we may
[45:10] obtain mercy and find grace to help in
[45:14] time of need
[45:30] with the feelings of our infirmities
[45:34] amen whatever whenever you hurt hello
[45:36] chuck of him and jesus is church
[45:40] whenever you're sick visit my life amen
[45:42] he is touched
[45:44] he knows exactly what you're going
[45:46] through he takes like the most
[45:48] he knows exactly amen what sickness
[45:50] you're dealing with exactly
[45:53] he knows exactly what is going on with
[45:54] your life he takes like the most sick
[45:56] man so we just have to come as the bible
[45:59] said boldly to that throne of grace
[46:04] whatever that belongs to us
[46:07] remember we have to come boldly
[46:10] blame our rights
[46:25] that means that your forgiveness was
[46:27] fulfilled
[46:29] that means that your healing was
[46:30] fulfilled
[46:32] so when you find yourself sick
[46:34] you just have to go back to that calvary
[46:38] you're just gonna have to go back to
[46:39] that tree
[46:54] that belongs to you
[46:57] and he became he became man he came by
[46:59] the woman he lived
[47:02] but he wasn't of the woman
[47:05] even he came by the woman
[47:08] he wasn't
[47:49] shall be with a child
[47:51] [Music]
[48:04] is god god with us
[48:09] jesus was god with us jesus
[48:12] that word that john said
[48:15] when he became flesh
[48:18] amen and dwelt among
[48:32] own feasts i mean he had to become a son
[48:35] of peace amen so that's why that's what
[48:37] we have that's why the trinitarians are
[48:40] confused
[48:43] people who believe in trinity they're
[48:45] all confused
[48:51] some of them will say well we only
[48:52] believe in one god but the father is
[48:54] different from the son and the son
[48:56] different from the spirit yes
[49:54] he says that in the message the water
[49:56] baptism uh paragraph 146 to 147.
[50:03] he says
[50:04] now in this the father son and the holy
[50:07] ghost
[50:39] amen and the prophet said that the
[50:40] largest is that pillar of fire the
[50:42] prophet
[50:44] even so now the prophet he says that
[50:46] after he dwelt in that pill of fire
[50:52] then came down and made himself a body
[50:56] a man brought himself down to a tent
[51:00] down a ton of human flesh and dwelt in
[51:04] it
[51:19] without controversy paul speaking paul
[51:22] paula great is the mystery of godliness
[51:27] for god was made before god was manifest
[51:30] in the flesh
[51:32] see the creator became savior
[52:02] couldn't even get around where where he
[52:04] was at
[52:07] me then he became son appreciated
[52:11] that we could touch him
[52:16] and he was
[52:50] because the scene of the human race
[52:52] because of the scene of the human race
[52:58] amen
[52:59] great great is the mystery of godliness
[53:03] amen let's read it again i think it's in
[53:05] first timothy chapter um chapter 3
[53:12] without controversy it's uncontrolled
[53:14] great is the mystery of godliness let me
[53:16] self-defeat go amen you see here the
[53:18] bible says that god was manifest in
[53:21] flesh
[53:24] manifesting
[53:25] amen god was manifest jew city
[53:28] manifested in he's not the bible is not
[53:30] talking about another being or another
[53:33] person
[53:38] that there is three persons in korean
[53:39] god
[53:55] seen of angels he defeated his own women
[53:57] the same god remember women was preached
[54:00] unto the gentiles
[54:02] the same god
[54:04] amen we believed on his word we will
[54:06] believe done in the world
[54:15] amen so now god coming then now god had
[54:18] to come under three sons name amen
[54:49] so we see that the son of man his first
[54:51] coming
[54:54] woman he had to come as the son of man
[54:57] amen talking about jesus
[54:59] jesus the son of man is a prophet
[55:03] amen it's found in ezekiel
[55:05] chapter 12 verse 1 to 6.
[55:13] amen you see here that ezekiel was
[55:15] called the son of man
[55:18] and every prophet is shocked prophet
[55:21] he's considered as the son of man he
[55:23] considered
[55:24] amen that's why you will see that when
[55:26] god visited abraham well because
[55:30] the prophet says that that was god that
[55:32] was the theophany that was the word the
[55:34] prophet
[55:37] the word going to a son of man who was
[55:39] abraham
[55:43] because abraham was a prophet
[55:46] amen the word goes to the prophet says
[55:50] the same type that has to go throughout
[55:53] 38
[55:54] ages
[55:57] and the bible says that the word of the
[55:58] lord also came unto me saying that
[56:11] which have eyes to see and see not they
[56:14] have ears to hear and hear or not
[56:20] for they are a rebellious house
[56:22] constitution
[56:24] therefore thou son of man
[56:26] prepare thee still for removing
[56:31] and remove by day in their side and thou
[56:33] shalt remove
[56:35] from thy place to another place in their
[56:37] side
[56:41] of
[56:56] ezekiel was called the son of man
[57:01] amen as a prophet
[57:03] amen
[57:05] he had to calm down
[57:08] as the son of man confessed to lamb amen
[57:10] because the bible says
[57:13] amen moses says
[57:15] that he will uh uh uh
[57:18] uh uh uh and there shall be a prophet
[57:21] like unto layla
[57:23] you shall raise up a prophet that come
[57:25] to me
[57:29] amen talking about jesus who was
[57:31] supposed to come under jesus
[57:33] you see that jesus was the son of man
[57:36] jesus was the son of man
[57:39] man he was different than all the son of
[57:41] man
[57:44] amen because those sons of men
[57:46] amen they have they had to wait for a
[57:48] certain revelation
[57:50] amen but jesus himself was the word
[57:53] jesus
[57:54] he knew everything
[57:57] so now the bible says here i mean
[57:59] you see that when jesus came into the
[58:01] coast of caesarea he lost which is real
[58:04] if you don't don't do
[58:22] you understand that if you read the
[58:24] entire bible
[58:27] or when jesus was still alive
[58:31] you'll see that jesus never called
[58:33] himself as the son of god
[58:37] feasts
[58:38] jesus never called himself as the son of
[58:40] god
[58:42] he called himself as the son of man
[58:46] now you asked but what's the difference
[58:49] between son of man and son of god if
[58:51] there's demons
[58:52] unconfessed
[58:53] amen the son of man confused when you
[58:56] see jesus jesus flesh and blood
[59:00] amen a human being walking through
[59:05] amen but when he came down velocity did
[59:08] this andrea man he wasn't the son of god
[59:11] he was the son of man
[59:13] because for him to be the become a son
[59:15] of god
[59:28] so he couldn't come as the son of god as
[59:30] being in the human flesh
[59:35] so that's why when he came down as the
[59:37] holy ghost
[59:40] he came as the son of god
[59:43] being in the spirit as god is in the
[59:44] spirit he don't don't don't only speak
[59:46] i'm jewish so that's the reason why you
[59:48] will never find jesus referring himself
[59:50] as a son of god
[59:55] because the word of god is perfect
[59:58] because there is
[1:00:11] of the heart
[1:00:26] amen revealing this the ministry of the
[1:00:28] son of man to the jews
[1:00:33] amen but there is no way in the bible or
[1:00:36] nowhere in the bible
[1:00:38] that jesus shows that same ministry to
[1:00:40] the gentiles
[1:00:45] because when he first came
[1:00:47] to blackpool he didn't come for the
[1:00:49] gentiles
[1:00:51] he came for his brothers
[1:00:54] he promised
[1:01:16] it's found it's found it's found in luke
[1:01:17] chapter 1 chapter 21 verse 24.
[1:01:22] the bible says that
[1:01:37] that and there shall fall by the age of
[1:01:38] the sword
[1:01:41] and it shall be led away captive into
[1:01:43] all nations
[1:01:47] and jesus shall be thrown down by the
[1:01:50] gentiles
[1:02:00] amen if you go to matthew chapter 24
[1:02:02] verse 36 to 34 uh 37.
[1:02:15] but of that day
[1:02:17] an hour no worth
[1:02:56] amen that's why you will see what i
[1:02:58] because
[1:02:58] amen
[1:03:00] the same things that jesus did remember
[1:03:06] it again
[1:03:08] amen i'm looking for that quote um
[1:03:16] amen you'll see that jesus
[1:03:18] jesus as the son of man that's as the
[1:03:21] son of man
[1:03:23] amen he tell that woman
[1:03:26] from secret of her heart
[1:03:35] amen in john chapter 4 verse 15 to 19
[1:03:37] we're not going to read it
[1:03:40] jesus that was jesus doing the ministry
[1:03:42] of the son of man see this is a
[1:03:44] complication
[1:03:45] so the same gift
[1:03:48] the same son of man gift
[1:03:52] brother
[1:03:53] amen
[1:03:55] also a woman
[1:04:10] amen who
[1:04:56] excuse me sister excuse me sir i have to
[1:04:59] relax my mind once in a while
[1:05:03] relax
[1:05:06] now
[1:05:10] i see that you're strictly a stranger to
[1:05:12] me
[1:05:15] meaning that he doesn't know her
[1:05:18] and he doesn't know anything about her
[1:05:20] concerns
[1:05:23] now he started saying that you from you
[1:05:25] from you from away from here
[1:05:28] emma you've come from another city
[1:05:32] you've got a lot of trouble on your
[1:05:34] heart
[1:05:47] i see a black sheep keep following you
[1:05:50] like that
[1:05:54] oh it's a lie
[1:05:56] somebody stole the light on you
[1:06:00] and that was a man professing divine
[1:06:02] healing

[1:06:48] she said yes sir that's with me
[1:06:50] sister don't pay no attention to what
[1:06:53] them people tell you
[1:06:58] they are lying in mountains and the only
[1:07:01] things wrong with your heart elasticized

[1:07:16] and god bless you to be nice you're all

[1:07:20] amen i feel like reading the the this
[1:07:23] verse that i told that i said that we're
[1:07:24] not going to read it
[1:08:14] amen and and then that woman amen that
[1:08:16] woman replied and then she said that
[1:08:21] how is it that
[1:08:23] thou being a jew
[1:08:27] drink of me with the montreal
[1:08:29] in which the jews and samaria
[1:08:32] you know something was going wrong
[1:08:33] between them
[1:08:36] amen then jesus answered and said unto
[1:08:38] her
[1:08:40] if that knew was the gift of god
[1:08:43] and who is that saith who who it is that
[1:08:46] saith to thee
[1:08:49] give me to drink
[1:08:51] that would
[1:08:52] have acts of me and he would uh and he
[1:08:56] would have given the living water
[1:09:01] amen so verse 14.
[1:09:04] but whosoever drinketh of the water
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:08] that that i shall give him shall never
[1:09:11] thirst
[1:09:14] by the water that i shall give him shall
[1:09:17] be in him a well of water springing up
[1:09:20] into the everlasting life
[1:09:26] so now the woman says unto him sir
[1:09:30] give me this water don't waste
[1:09:42] now jesus here he's now uh uh discerning
[1:09:45] her heart
[1:10:00] even the woman answered and said i have
[1:10:02] no husband the family foundation
[1:10:05] jesus said unto her jesus
[1:10:08] that was well said
[1:10:10] i have no husbands
[1:10:12] for thou has
[1:10:13] now has had five
[1:10:36] amen it was that ministry that jesus has
[1:10:39] to revere
[1:10:42] of being a prophet
[1:10:44] and prophet even of being the son of man
[1:10:47] amen you'll find it again in john
[1:10:49] chapter 1 verse 48
[1:10:53] amen
[1:10:59] what he was doing previously
[1:11:01] what he was doing before coming to him
[1:11:06] and you will see that the prophet did
[1:11:08] the same thing by by the grace of god
[1:11:11] that gifted the same thing in the
[1:11:12] prophets
[1:11:16] in the message the deep call it to the
[1:11:17] deep the message
[1:11:19] i mean if you read the paragraph 51 and
[1:11:21] 52.
[1:11:24] amen you will see that the prophet did
[1:11:25] the same thing
[1:11:28] telling telling telling the uh uh uh
[1:11:31] telling that person what it was doing
[1:11:33] before in the previous time

[1:11:45] father's his father's name
[1:11:48] you know when he first met him when he
[1:11:50] first met him
[1:11:52] jesus didn't know
[1:12:07] to the deep civilization
[1:12:09] the prophet says that i know there is a
[1:12:11] dark spirit the prophet
[1:12:14] is seeing hanging hanging hanging at you

[1:23:31] jesus is praying for himself
[1:24:07] amen you see that jesus is still praying
[1:24:09] for him

[1:24:41] simon
[1:24:42] behold
[1:24:56] for them
[1:24:58] that thy faith fell not i thank you for
[1:25:01] the fire and when they were converted
[1:25:05] to strengthen thy brethren
[1:25:07] amen simon i have prayed for you
[1:25:10] even i know hard
[1:25:23] i know that all these things are coming
[1:25:52] you can keep the faith and when you

[1:25:58] holy spirit
[1:26:00] women will go and strengthen your
[1:26:01] brethren
[1:26:02] because being converted
[1:26:05] it doesn't mean that you you a penguin
[1:26:07] pentecost or you were in the catholic
[1:26:09] church and you joined the message
[1:26:13] that's not being converted
[1:26:15] being converted

[1:26:19] where you you didn't believe uh you you
[1:26:21] weren't going to church and now you
[1:26:22] start going to church
[1:26:25] that's not being converted

[1:26:57] you gave me to be one
[1:26:59] to god amen because i haven't lost any
[1:27:02] of them
[1:27:16] it means that you receive the holy
[1:27:17] spirit because of the holy spirit god
[1:27:19] dwells inside of you
[1:27:21] and as we said it last sunday
[1:27:24] you received the holy spirit
[1:27:26] amen you are born again

[1:28:02] when you come forward
[1:28:04] strengthen your breath
[1:28:06] because that's the only way you can do
[1:28:08] that
[1:28:10] if you're converted
[1:28:12] because that won't be you living by god
[1:28:14] living inside of you

[1:29:31] he did all of that
[1:29:33] to save you
[1:29:35] and he had to go through all these
[1:29:37] things
[1:29:39] to save you
[1:29:41] i don't take it lightly
[1:29:43] amen because the prophet says
[1:29:46] that jesus is not the eternal son of god
[1:30:18] any forgiveness of sin anymore
[1:30:21] hey so when there is still time
[1:30:24] they may run into the ark
