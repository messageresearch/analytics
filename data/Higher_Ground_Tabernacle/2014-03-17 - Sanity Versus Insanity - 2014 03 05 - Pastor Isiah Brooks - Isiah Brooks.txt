me amen amen we have to learn that one all the way over and all the way through amen you love the Lord amen we realize amen we're living in the last days amen amen there was a song in here that came to me just at the last minute and uh you may be seated if you like I appreciate everybody tonight I'm still having a little rough time with that computer trying to get it all together but slowly but surely it's coming there nothing wrong with the computer it's the man who's operating it amen hallelujah I'm almost there I come to the garden alone while the D is still on the rose and the voice I he falling on my KNE the son of God disclos Moes and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own and the joy we share has we take [Music] no other has ever no he speaks and at the sound of his voice is so sweet the bird H there [Music] singing and the man de that he gave to me within my heart is ringing and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own and the joy we share as we tell there no another has ever known I'll stay in the garden with him though the night all around me is falling but he B me go through the voice of w his voice to me is call and and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own and the joy we share as we te there none other has ever known and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am he on and the joy we share as we tear that none other has ever amen hallelujah amen God is in the process of restoring my voice it's not there yet but I thank God for what I got ain't God good amen surely God is good amen as we stand you know I tell you what I've had to write out a lot of stuff cu but by the grace of God I'm not complaining I just almost forgot how to write amen you know how your hand can't hardly move that's a shame you know amen you love God surely you're insane if you don't amen because that's my message insanity and uh my subtopic would be The Keeper of the Mind Hallelujah let's turn to acts 24 please acts 24 acts 24 and4 this is Paul speaking but this I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship I the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets Hallelujah I'm going to believe it all amen second Timothy please second Timothy uh we'll start at the first chapter that's where I want you to go glad to have everybody here today tonight and you know it's something else when you come out on Wednesday night it's like coming out on Sunday evening whenever you can amen we appreciate all of you and by the grace of God let us read from the seventh verse for God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sound mind now I want you to repeat that with me for God have not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind is that all right be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partakers taker of the Affliction of The Gospel According to the power of God who have saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus oh I love this before the world began but is now made manifest by the preaching of Our Savior Jesus Christ who have abolished death and have brought life and immortality to life through the gospel is that all right amen so we realize by the grace of God Amen we're working with sanity versus Insanity uh let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord Jesus we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord you been been so good to us you've been better to us Lord than we've been to ourselves there's no place no place Lord nowhere I can express my gratitude Lord the English language cannot even express Lord what I feel in my heart but I'm so thankful that you know what my heart speak and we pray tonight Lord that you bless the service this this evening bless each and every one of us the hearer of the word oh God the doers of the word oh God bless those who who are visiting being blessed Lord I pray that you give us eyes to see ears to hear and a heart to receive in Jesus Christ name we pray amen you may be seated I just want to say by the grace of God that uh I I I'm just going to try to take my time so that you can fully understand uh where we're going we realize amen according to the message of the hour that uh the world uh at large would be totally insane and the only people who will not be insane are those who are following the truth of the word of God now you say well Brothers what do you mean uh we're living in a society or in a world Amen where people are calling right wrong and wrong right amen America as a as is a as a leading nation has Bas basically spread her Insanity uh all over the world and we realize amen that we're living in a people a a time and an age where people don't even know they're insane it's like the like like the Bible said according to Revelations 3 blind and don't know it naked and don't know it amen and if you was to tell them that they were blind or naked they would be very offended uh with and by those words and will act more than likely in a rational way it's only because are insane you know I believe that scripture where it says lay suddenly your hands on no man because God knew that in our age people would be H H uh so demon possessed to they really believe that the demons are themselves now I want you to realize and I'm going to be reading some stuff here so I I want you to know that I'm going on on two sides of this thing so I'm I'm depending on the Holy Ghost to to to let me preaching the way he gave it to me amen because we are living in a day where Insanity a lot of time people don't uh you know I I'll be honest with you I I call people insane that drop jumps out of airplanes just for the fun I mean to me that makes no sense to me that's tempting God you know but people are so uh you know involved in that they they love that Adrenaline Rush well you know when I was a boy before I got got saved I used to dream falling off of a cliff and I didn't like that Adrenaline Rush not even in my dream so why would I do it while while awake you know what I'm saying the only way I would drop out of a plane or jump out of a plane is is that is going down and I've got a parachute and a prayer right so you know you look at these things and you say well brother Brooks you know it's okay I mean what what would make a Man spent so much time uh uh in his life climbing Mount Everest and if he wanted to find God he could easily find him in the word you know but we find out that people don't they don't have a balance nowadays and and it's the people who are insane that gets most of the credit I could remember the time when my wife was having Gracie and she had a rough time and we was reading the scriptures amen when when uh HH and the and the doctor got upset and my wife and I was rejoicing saying thank you Jesus thank you Jesus for delivering the baby he said Jesus didn't deliver that baby he said I did and to this day I wonder where that doctor is I I I know now that he was insane because only an insane person can make such a statement as that y'all hear what I'm saying now insanity or to be insane is not to is is one that is not of a sound mind you know mentally deranged and often time we think that the people who are in the insane as silent are the ones that are insane but really our government is insane I mean you think about the people who are now gambling and playing Russian roulette with the lives of the world with nuclear weapons and nuclear bombs as if they're God themselves Hitler was insane though he was an intelligent man he was insane come on somebody now I I want you to realize because I want you to understand there's another kind of insanity but there a good crazy right there's another kind there's a flip side to the one one is a negative the other one is a positive all right Paul said I worship in the way that they call heresy that word mean crazy I worship in the way that the world the caral Mind call crazy and if it it it's okay it's all right to be that kind of crazy crazy for Jesus crazy for the blood crazy for the cross it's all right about that but when we find out and uh we were talking Brother Rich earlier day I forgot what's the lady name who who put prayer out of school y'all heard him because I can't even say it but she it's a known fact that she was so against Christianity till she in prayer and all those things in school she petition and won what was so ironic about the whole thing is that her son later on in life became a Christian and then they found her somewhere dead cut up in pieces now if she got that treatment on Earth what do you think her treatment will be in hell because you must realize that Disobedience to the word of God is insanity willful Disobedience to the word of God is insanity you derin you're out of your mind because you're not thinking about the consequence quences hello don't get quiet on me now Paul the word of God tells us to Timothy he says now God has not given us a spirit of fear cuz fear is torment torment makes you insane when something's tormenting you you make ra uh rational or irrational decisions sometime we do anything to stop the devil from tormenting us sometime those things that we'll do are are not right with the word come on and at that point in time he put you in a temporary insane position because at that moment you'll not right in your mind come on somebody you look at the way the world is driving the young people into Insanity where they loving to keep and you know you know the more violent the the the the game is the the the happier they are it it just seemed like it f feel it feels something on the inside what it is they got an insane demon hello somebody amen whenever you can get to the place where you have no fear in taking another man's life you are insane whether it's by listen the Bible said that you'll be judged not by just what you do but by having pleasure in those that do the evil oh come on somebody is the truth amen listen what the prophet of God says in demonology he said many times you can see a person maybe of insanity now they may be a converted person filled with the Holy Spirit and yet be totally insane see that's right that has nothing to do with the soul it's a Tormentor Now understand he's going to say what he see sometimes that Tormentor them or God sometimes permits Satan to put sickness on you as a whip to bring you back to the house of God when you dis disobey him so he gives us torment us he will allow torment to torment you until you get back on your knees and say God forgive me in other words God will allow a devil to drive Insanity the spirit of insanity on you until you realize because understand it's your spirit that he's working with but your soul is say anybody you know what I'm talking about God is The Keeper of the Mind Isaiah 26 and3 says Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee huh amen if we trust God and do whatever we could do to keep our minds on him God will give us perfect peace hallu you see I experience that even today just keeping my mind stared on him and it's been a peaceful day it doesn't mean that the winds have been blowing and the storms have been coming but by the grace of God my mind has been kept in peace see and like I said there's a good worship you know you look at people and you know you can see they're not happy you know you can see the the torment on the inside you know and and and and and and they just don't know what to do with themselves you know it's like you know and and and I don't I don't know I hope nobody have any tattoos and I'm I'm not I'm not against you but as a as a person I I realize that people they they don't take their bodies as being sacred anymore there was a time your body was a sacred thing whether you were saved or not God saved something about your body you cherished but now people are so insane they're so empty they they they don't know what else to do and they're writing all kinds of graffiti on their bodies they call them tattoos but if you go to the inner city and see all that stuff on the wall what do you think this is ghetto right this is where violence lay this is a dangerous city here you see what I'm saying why because it's Lawless they're out of control come on somebody and so when you see these things and these people get into these things they don't realize that mentally they're out of control one of the favorite things that children are tell people grown-ups now I can remember the time when I was a boy and I'm I'm going to get into it folks but I was boy I remember the time you just couldn't say anything you wanted to to a grown person some I say grown but if they're 2 three years older than you and there your babysitter that's Mama and Daddy's word you just couldn't say anything because even in that day they had the privilege or they had the power rather to whoop you you got a whooping from them and you got a whooping from your mama and your daddy nowadays people are so insane when the babysit or whoever is trying to correct that child mom and daddy said don't you touch my child unless you want to touch me they will fight you why they're insane y'all looking at me like I'm is it all right I'm I'm trying to tell you amen that this insanity if you're not careful will anoint you h it anoint you it it it's it's a l to Sheen Spirit it is a spirit that that that becomes dor you know what do insane people do just in the same Pace in the same Circle in the same motion they just don't know what to do they're out of control now I know a girl a friend of ours and my wife we know this uh uh a young lady she used to be a beautiful woman and when we was in the apostolic church and she basically cursed the bishop out guess what happened to her a month or two later totally insane lost all of her beauty she was so insane amen that she literally tried to cut the baby that she was carrying out of her H I don't care if he saw you cannot be foolish to touch sa's garment and we told her I was going to call her name we told her I said it for sure you shouldn't have never said that she thought it was something good she said I said first of all you have no right to rebuke an elder come on somebody amen the word of God is effective right and to this day I don't know where she's at but Lord the way she the demon trans formed and you know what she told me she said I could hear the demon tell me what to do I had to do what he told me to do there was no way I could stop it even though it was causing me pain hello y'all better listen to me y'all better listen to this God ain't bringing this for nothing amen because that's what's on the rampid that's what's happening people are falling away why because they're giving over to the spirit of insanity they don't want to hear sound Doctrine because a sound mind goes with a sound Doctrine and a sound Doctrine goes with a sound mind sound stable right disciplined and people don't want to be disciplined anymore you can preach the word of God on things that'll make them discipline or discipline them in their lives and they walk out thinking that you pointing their fingers at you at them yes it's God pointing his finger not cuz I can't afford to point fingers I'm saved by the grace of God too I'm coming to something in just a moment amen so you say well what do you mean brother Brooks let us turn to First Timothy please 1 8-10 I want you to understand amen when we talk about how we ought to dress and how we ought to behave ourselves people look oh yeah that all that ain't necessary you ain't got to do all of that that's what the devil told Eve that's the same thing he was the first one that gave der deranged her mind she literally was insane because she thought she was doing right call it deception whatever you want to call it but she was deranged when the devil finished talking to her she was out of her mind and into her mind and not out in in God's mind 1 Timothy 1 8-10 says but we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully see a lot of time people we're not under the law no we're not but the law is good the law keep you out of trouble if you listen to it ain't nobody going to tell me what to do okay I wish I could act like brother brother Diggs I wish I could put it on like him I can almost hear him sometime when I'm preaching amen know know this that the law is not made for a righteous man for but for the Lawless and disobedient so because if you're disobedient then then the law will affect you but if you're obedient what is the law to you you're doing it amen right for the law Lawless and the disobedient for the ungodly and for The Sinner and for ungodly and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers for manslayers for horong us for them that defile themselves with mankind for men Stealers for liars for prej persons and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound Doctrine hello America who was first based upon Bible PR principles and I hope y'all don't mind me saying a word it over there in in in in in um Washington state do you know beology is legalized did you know just recently a man married a dog now if that's not Insanity folks it's been happening all along all along now I want you to know how vile that is but listen man is doing it they are totally insane we won't go all the other places but think about it your your politicians and everybody else you don't know we don't know what they doing I know this sound really but I I put it this way people of God is happening everywhere you have been protected but like I said with all this fake all this bad Insanity that's going on God is keeping somebody's mind amen you know it's really an insane person that don't want to worship God you said why would you say that the devil is a worshipper and he loves worship but he'll make his make the Believers who say they believe in Jesus Christ he'll make them not worship he'll make them look like they're the ones insane glory to God look what the prophet God said he said and then the Deep began to call to the deep and y'all know what this is you'll see where we going now oh down in my heart he said I could say I said God here I am way up here supposed to be hunting see so you can let go anytime you want to you can be insane in the in in the grocery store if you like as long as you go crazy for Jesus people used to do it they get to thinking about God and they didn't care where they were it made no difference Hallelujah I remember being in University of South Carolina and the lord gave me the answers to the question and here I was speaking in tongues right at my task I don't know if anybody heard me I didn't care I just got so happy I spoke in tongues you know back in that day and I got happy and I sat down my gun and I ran around and around the tree I would just are shouting as hard as I could somebody up there they have put me in a in a in a Institution for Insanity he said oh I was having a glorious time now that's the kind of insanity I like I just like it amen when people just lose it for Jesus that what I'm saying if you're going to let a ghost or a spirit take you out let it be the Holy Ghost yes let it be the Holy Ghost you know we find out and I'm thinking it's true because when you get to heaven you know ain't nobody going to I don't know how you're going to be doing but it's going to be so much noise nobody's going to say shut that person up why are they screaming so loud it's going to be such a roar God would have to give you perfect ears otherwise you come out there yeah now now I'm looking at this because I want you to understand if we're not careful we will find ourself drifting where do you first drift in your mind your mind amen brings you right into your spirit right and that's where you first drift that's where the devil gets you off track he moves you from the soundness of the word hello into some fraction something that could possibly cause division huh you so oh oh oh oh oh brother Bruce what all galileans or Galatians who have bewit you right you once believed the cross you once believed the blood and now you want to go back to the law he said you'll be witched what is he saying you're insane you don't have the right mind something has happened to you when you C when you think amen that anything can save you outside of the grace of God oh come on somebody it's true he says they talking about Jesus you know the Lord Jesus had a reputation of being crazy so much so they say you know he got a devil he's be above you know what be about being Lord of the Flies lord of the dung heill that's what they call Jesus he's crazy he thinks he's the Messiah oh he didn't think it he knew he was Hallelujah like they say you crazy if you really think you're the Bride of Jesus well I'm crazy then hallelujah because not only do I think it I know it is hallelujah he makes it a no so Hallelujah come on somebody to the car of mind you're going to always look insane you never want to appear normal to them because when you become normal to the caral mind or the unbeliever you're compromising somewhere woo come on they that Li live Godly in Jesus Christ will suffer persecution mhm they took his body down wrapped it in some linen and laid it in in in in in in in the grave and said that's finished that's the finish of that fanatic crazy and I can go out there and I could put a bull head on me stop making all kinds of noise and I'm sa but if I put on a Jesus Christ my shirt or carry my Bible hello now those ain't things ain't necessary but I'm just trying to tell you how the world look at you you're insane you poor little decrepid person you couldn't you couldn't make this world on your own you had to find a crutch by the name of Jesus Christ you can't be a strong person you got to find religion Hallelujah no I don't have to find religion it found me Hallelujah I didn't go looking for Jesus he came looking for me how did the world was against him they said he was a Holy Roller he was insane he was a fanatic and so forth the disciples were crazy is that right that's the truth amen according to history they said those disciples were so crazy they was out there eating Jesus body and drinking his blood yeah that's what history said because they did not understand what Jesus said in the communion he said if you drink my blood and eat my flesh you'll have Parton me so the saying went out these disciples amen ate his body insane now now I want you to know by the grace of God that a lot of times demons come upon us amen because amen of somebody else is sin sometime we we feel like you know well why is this coming on me or why uh did this happen to me it could go way back right okay I'm going to read something to you in just a moment I'm working with something because really amen when God called you and I to this gospel he came to free us from every bondage amen and many of us when we came to Jesus we were so demon-possessed anybody know what I'm talking about somebody said hey I had Legion I don't know what more than Legion is and what you would call it but I think I had a little bit more than Legion oh come on come on see what it is you just didn't know what all you had cuz God saved you before you you tested the ERS but I guarantee you you was packing a lot of devils before you came to Jesus and some of us might need to still get rid of some you hear what I'm saying amen we're at a place by the grace of God that what's going to cleanse us from our sin like they said nothing but the blood of Jesus we're at the right place if you want a sound mind you've got to have a sound doctrin amen you got to know where your help and healing come from oh my can I can I can I go on in the healing line he said isn't that the truth now he's talking to a young man he's talking to a young man he said now you know no one knows that but God Alone what does he work with hidden sin hidden weaknesses that only God knows he never exposed it but he said listen you know what it is y'all listen cuz this is really good he said is that right is if that's right hold up your hand now that's a demon that's tormenting you son and never get rid of it and you'll never get rid of it there's no medicine in the world could touch it because it's supernatural he said no medison can touch this what I'm working with you on hello somebody you know amen tormentors when is in your flesh and you know it when is in your spirit and no medicine can get rid of that which is in your spirit all it can do is cover it up camouflage it or whatever but it'll never get rid of it y'all know what I'm saying he said do you believe that God gives the Comm mission to his church to cast out Devils now you know where I'm going with this because all of us must become more consecrated we must in order to help one another the body of Jesus Christ need healing Hallelujah and we must if those of us who are suffering in the spirit with something amen that only you and God knows there's healing for you there's Deliverance for you I don't care if you can't touch it with your hand God can touch it Hallelujah and you believe in this church all around here will bind their prayers with me I circled I underlined that bind bind their prayers with me and pray for you you hear what I'm saying you know what bind it it means to tie it up so it can't get a loose right taking your faith and you and I all of us binding our faith together Amen to deliver up brother or deliver a sister and won't let it go amen devil you'll never have free course in this person's life again and don't doubt amen if it's done in sincerity he says he says listen bind their prayers with me and pray for you that that demon will leave you and never bother you no more he said it's a horrible thing it'll drive you insane come on somebody y'all knows those spiritual afflictions that we suffer through the day a sufferer has been suffering all these years you know if God don't do something about it it will drive you insane why because the Bible said evil seduces evils will get worse sicknesses if held long enough doesn't they don't get better it gets worse if it's not attend to it gets worse you know that you've been bothered with it all along it's something here's the key point cuz I'm tired of the devil blaming you see the devil will blame you you're the reason why this is happened he said no no no no no it's something that's handed down to you somewhere in the family sin was committed and the lot fell on you how you going to get rid of it you can't get rid of it unless Jesus get rid of it for you come on somebody I I don't know nobody see you're insane if you don't want to be delivered nothing can take place only God will you believe it if I ask you God I he said listen I can't heal you son it it it can't leave it can leave leave you now see oh I I want to be delivered tomorrow no he said it can leave you now that's right he couldn't stand before he speaking of the devil couldn't stand before a sincere prayer no sir why he's exposed he cannot stand before a sincere prayer I don't care he said this boy had this demon whatever it was tormenting him ever since he was a boy can you imagine amen that child going through life not trying to keep it a secret whatever it was it was spiritual but here God comes along cuz he knows and can be touched by the feelings of your infirmities wo come on somebody he's a high priest hallelujah amen I'd rather believe that God can heal me that to take the doctor's word you got to be in some Institute or on some brain medication amen come on I think God preaching to everybody in here hallelujah if I'm going to be insane let it be for Jesus Hallelujah was it John Ryan he was insane he went amen down there to that prayer meeting got up in the line and the prophet of God said you healed you can see he got out of the prayer line he couldn't see no more than a bat Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying amen and he come back up in the line he said brother R I thought you said I could see brother R said I thought you said you believe Hallelujah he says you see what it was he was a Catholic and he didn't have the kind of Faith he needed to come up the ladder so he was a newspaper boy Hallelujah he got that on the corner he's said extra extra read all about it I'm he oh he kept that up for days am people come by said oh I hear you been down to that crazy holy rooll meeting I heard that he told you you was you was healed and you con see he said exra exra Read All About It amen I I'm here I think John Ryan thought well I might as well go to the barber shop oh I can see this I think I even dreamed about it one time he said I think I go to the Bible shop and when he got in the Bible shop and got in the Bible sh they start picking on it say yeah I hear you've been down there to that Holy Roller meeting but what they didn't understand is that John Ryan had done cross over now he's insane but in the good way Hallelujah he's insane about Jesus he's insane about the promises of God hallelujah he's believing it he's trusting it amen and he knows nothing else about it other than to trust God so now he's living in the way and worship in the way they call heresy Hallelujah in the way they call crazy say man you went down there and let that man fool you he says not so he said extra extra read all about it I'm here when he said that his eyes popped open he jumped up out of the barber stair and ran down the high ran down the road out of the out of the bar I can't even get it out out of the Barber's door down the road the barber following him running behind him hey somebody if I'm going to be insane let me be insane for the Lord Jesus huh they going to call me something anyhow yes Hallelujah is that okay 1 Peter please 1 13 people people don't want to be labored insane or crazy man he's a fanatic she's a fanatic but they gonna call you something anyhow might as well call you

Jesus Christ Christ called by his grace Chosen and elected before the foundation of the world that's who I am I'm not of this world though I might be in it I'm not of this world and when you and I have come to the place we feel like the world got the best of you gotten to the place where it's ruling you you know what you need to do the best place to start is on your knees God loves a broken and

God he's a sword he's a word he go down to the marrow of the bone he discerned the spirits he's there he's a light that'll drive out all darkness in your life that's why nobody will be able to stand before God and says God I couldn't overcome and he says he'll say why I gave you the medicine for it I sent my son Jesus Christ to deliver you why if God can go down to Hell conquer death Hell In The Grave amen whip the devil on his ground open up the doors of paradise Ascend into heaven Hallelujah bring the whole crew with him you think God can't get rid of those little demons and Devils out you

lips running from something that's chasing me and I can't see it Hallelujah come on somebody amen I won't have to worry about you won't see me dress in any kind of way I'm sound y'all hear what I'm saying and that's what I'm say listen it is so bad now I I I I was in the uh Panera the other day and the and and and the man he had a little limp to his hair but I can't understand how these women they she had all this design cutting her hair it was that long all in the front and in the back she had a little piece you know the saddest thing about it she just doesn't know that she's insane and what she has done has put her out of the economy of God in that sense and if she doesn't come to the knowledge of the truth and die that way she'll come before a angry judge now you show our brother H let me tell you something your conscience if you ain't got the word God will give you a sharp enough conscience ience to know when you're right or wrong now you'll have to push over it come on you sure what brother I don't believe that let me tell you something the first time I put on shorts I knew I was wrong I remember when we had to dress out in gym how naked I felt didn't have enough strength to fight it oh come on you push over it your conscience tell you when you're wrong hello somebody and it'll be your soul the prop God said it be your own soul tormenting you in hell your own soul your own image standing there before you told you I told you I told you I told you who help us Lord I'm not trying to beat you up I'm trying to say hey let's get our minds right Hallelujah you don't follow the lord Jesus you were insane it's true if you aren't you soon will be Judas was insane when when the devil entered into him say you betray him you go to the high priest and tell on him what that was just the there was this insane demon and where did the Insane Demon drive him to Suicide come on somebody let me go on and let me say this en closing you said well brother you know people can't be like that in church yes sir here was Saul the king of Israel and what did Saul do he was disobedient to God's word the prophet Samuel told him you wait till I get back here now Saul done already messed up cuz he he did he took the best of the goods and God told him to kill everything even the king kill it all right like God told us kill all the inhabitants of the land lust Pride whatever falls under those three things kill it all if you don't kill it all it will kill you and that's what Saul did he said listen I I'd say the best you know how sometime people think that character something God got to use you see what I'm saying in other words they might like me for instance people say I can sing now if I don't die to that when I come to God I must die to the fact that I think that I can sing right cuz that's an inhabitant that's something amen that if I'm not careful of I'll think that that's something that that God God needs or you know if I offer this up to the Lord he said kill everything and that's true if I was holding on to singing and music and all that stuff I wouldn't be here but I had to die out to all of that oh come on somebody why because I want to be obedient what makes more sense than anything else is to stand on the word of God there's a lot of singers and dancers and shouters and all that in hell but you got to come to God in you got to empty everything out and say I'm a worthless good for nothing nobody and nothing I got to can offer good to you I'm a sinner right that's how you got to break yourself all the way down before God can take you up so anyhow amen Saul Save the King Samuel come and says you've done the will of God he says yes and that's how a lot of people think well yeah I've done everything just like I told somebody I said when you surrender 100% to God you'll get the Holy Ghost yeah you'll get the Holy Ghost if you surrender all to God you'll get it right so I told him I said listen I said you know you find out here Saul says listen I've done all and then Samuel said well what what what what is that I hear them in come on all that squeaking and squealing come on I hear all those sounds and all you got to do is listen to a person just hold on conversation with them and you'll know whether they holding on to a few things sir that they shouldn't be holding on to Hallelujah you say you've done the will of God but what is this noise I hear in the background and let me tell you something if you don't kill the king he's going to raise up another Army against you you got to kill the king and who is that your husband before you marry Jesus am Satan must die in your life he must become dead cuz if he don't become dead if you still like a few things that he puts out to you you're flirting with him and all that kind of stuff he ain't dead yet and Samuel saying I'm hearing the noise right and so what happened amen because of his Disobedience amen God said by way of Samuel stubbornness is as witchcraft huh oh and she's stubborn that God said it's like witchcraft you've been Bewitched when you want to be stubborn against the will of God you are Bewitched you are insane and you need your sanity only God can give it to you help us Lord and what happened he tried to hold on to Samuel and he tore His Garment he ripped it and God said Samuel turned around and said just as you ripped my garet the kingdom of God has been ripped out of your hands and God is going to give it to another he was saved but he was likened unto the tribulation Saint he was killed in the battle y'all hear what I'm saying he's likened to the tribulation things he was killed in the battle but God saved him Hallelujah come on and God said I'm looking for somebody a man after my own heart Hallelujah you know what made David so great David knew how to repent David knew how to cry out whenever he would fall in the ditch he' cry out Lord deliver me from the ditch he knew he knew himself and he knew how frail he was but he knew how powerful his savior was he said the Lord is the light of my salvation who shall I fear the lord is the strength of my life who shall I be afraid see he understood his position with God and you and I must understand our position with God that's what makes us sane that's what makes us sane when we can see the position of God in our lives he's Lord he's King he's savior he has Dominion he must have preeminence he must be the number one in your life I'm almost done so what happens Saul goes insane turn with me to 1st Samuel 16 I'm not going to keep you much longer I'm almost done I want to show you if you're not obedient to God God will let a demon get on you to torment you he will whip you back in shame thank God for his grace and his Mercy huh thank God for his grace and his Mercy 1 Samuel 16 beginning at the 14th verse but the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him the Holy Spirit departed from him and he let a demon come in his place huh God said I'll never leave you nor forsake you brother Bram said he will go off on a limb till the goat nature is gone you come back to be a sheep for a lamb hello somebody amen let's go on down to 1st Samuel 18 and10 this okay I'm almost done we surrender all God will give you all First 1st Samuel 18:10 and it came to pass on the marrow that the evil spirit from God Came Upon Saul and he prophesied in the midst of the of the House of uh in the in the midst of the house now he he was under uh evil spirit and he's yet prophesied right and David played with his hand as other times and there was a javelin in Saul's hand what was Saul going to do with that Javelin that's when you know you got an evil spirit when you start javing people it's the truth I don't mean to be F and I didn't mean but that's the truth when you start go in front of them right amen and one thing about a javelin you don't have to get close to the person you can throw it from afar right and why am I saying that because the Bible said bless and curse not you start cursing your brothers and your sisters in the spirit you throwing a javing because I'm going tell you something if Elijah's word worked on no children your word will work and a lot of Christians are suffering things because other Christians have placed it upon them by their words curse bless and curse not because when you start cursing that's why the prophet God said if you can't say something good about somebody don't say nothing at all hello somebody I've been guilty anybody know what I'm talking about all of us us have so let's move on by the grace of God is that all right let's drop down Amen to 1st Samuel 19 I'm almost done 19 and9 and the e evil spirit from the Lord was upon Saul as he sat in the house with his javelin in his hand and David played with his hand and Saul sought to Smite David even to the wall with the javelin now come on he wasn't playing no games he wanted to strike him so hard that the javelin would penetrate trate through him and pin him to the wall that that was anger now what did David do to deserve that nothing you know what started that jealousy he realized amen the anointing and I'm going tell you something whenever you let an evil jealousy come on you that is a demon you are insane cuz jealousy was the thing that caused Cain to kill Abel God said no murderer come before me yall understand that amen you love the Lord yeah he tried to kill him he wanted to kill him and Saul sought to Smite David even to the wall with the javelin but He Slipped Away out of Saul's Pres pres and he smoked the javelin into the wall and David fled and escaped that night hello that's what Insanity to do for you that's what Disobedience will bring us to hello somebody and David almost allowed that same Spirit to come on him when he found Saul in the cave his man said you ought to kill him he deserved to die look what he did to you right and Saul David in his own mind thought well I just cut a piece of this garment he was wrong touch not my anointing neither do my Prophet no harm come on somebody and I want you to know that just don't go for a prophet that goes for every one of us here we have no business to touching each other in that way uh uh up it's true anyhow amen so what happens amen David thought I'll cut His Garment and then he shows saw but he r repented he said oh my God have mercy on me what have I done you see what I'm saying and that that that's the way it is sometime we slip up and do something but we ought to immediately repent because we are the anointing of God listen we and each and every one of us are as important to God as Jesus Christ was to him himself but we are Sons and Daughters of God y'all hear what I'm saying oh people may God help us tonight I'm closing on this I want you to understand press curdle up The Lawns of your mind amen the devil is trying to tell you you not a son or daughter of God the devil is telling you not worth anything what are you talking about God paid his price for you Hallelujah there was no rubies no diamonds no gold amen that could buy you he took his own blood and he purchase you and me you tell me I ain't worth the devil come on somebody when God come down himself and paid the price for My Soul Your Soul Hallelujah I'm more than worth it nothing in heaven could pay for my soul outside of Jesus Christ himself and the devil tell you it ain't worth it you going you ain't going to make it and this and that I already unmade it so have you just keep trusting in God keep pressing on Amen making letting your mind fall in line with this ver is God help me take away the insanity take away the desire to do wicked things or evil things just drive everything away from me God Lord help me show me how to surrender everything Hallelujah you on the right road then amen and then after you surrender you say God cleanse me every day Lord search me oh God try me if there be any wicked thing in me take it out Lord hallelujah I want to be just like you oh let's stand
