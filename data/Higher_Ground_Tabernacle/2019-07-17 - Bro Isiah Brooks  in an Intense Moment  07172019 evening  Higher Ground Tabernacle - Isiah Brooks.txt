John the Tim chapter beginning at the seventh verse st. John 10 beginning at the seventh verse Saint John 10 beginning at the seventh verse then said Jesus unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the Sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door By Me If any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly I am The Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep one more scripture Matthew 26 we began reading at the 36th verse Matthew 26 and we'll begin reading at the 36th verse then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit here while I go and pray yonder and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy then said he unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me now think about it Jesus so and he sorrowful he's heavy the feelings of a man is now surfacing in our Lord's life and went a little further and fell on his face and phrase saying oh my God if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt and he cometh unto the disciples and finding them asleep and said unto Peter what could ye not watch with me one hour watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak he went away again the second time and prayed saying O my father if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy don't you understand in an intense moment the people were sleepy sleepy and he left them and went away and prayed the third time saying the same words then cometh he to his disciples and said unto them sleep on now take your rest behold the hours at hand and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners let us pray father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves and Lord you have laid out the way of the word and you have shown us by your amazing grace what is required of us father give us wisdom we know that our is coming and father I want to be ready lord help us now to be ready and your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray you may be seated I do apologize I thought had had my Bible with me and I didn't bring it but by God's grace we'll work with what we have I don't like coming in the pulpit without my by the way no matter what kind of technology I have but you know I love the Lord and I believe that this message came from God one thing I know for certain you and I must realize and understand by God's grace that every Christian that call themselves Christian it's not and will not be wrapped already we must understand that some Christians will come up at the first resurrection and then some will come up at the second resurrection but those of us who have been ordained to be in the first resurrection I believe have been called according to Matthew 25 brother Craig ministered I believe a little bit on the foolish virgins and the wise virgins and as the time goes on we can truly understand what what makes one foolish it's because we see the time in the season we have heard the call and yet we find ourselves da Latorre we find ourselves moving slowly or moving without excitement failing to see that the call was a matter of life and death we understand by God's grace that there's a certain character and we've been preaching on that the we were talking about the origin of our origin would talk about you know the Empire we've been talking about the Holy Ghost we've been talking about the sealing of the Holy Ghost we've been talking about the characteristics of the Holy Ghost which is God's divine nature and we've been telling everybody and been trying to get invited refocus and see that without the divine nature you do not dwell within the city all right and you and I must understand that there's this the divine nature is not something you can work at it is not something that you can add to yourself it asks to you the Bible tells us by God's grace that we it talks about adding but brother Branham said this thing it is is the seed it adds to you but you must be quickened the seed must be quickened in order for it to add in other words that's the only way you can grow in Christ is that that seed germ of life is quickened within you now we realize a man that we have gone through this message we've gone through a great deal of revivals every little ism has had its revival and what has it produced we don't see no more Jesus than we've seen in a long time but we realize a man that it must come and it must be present now so there is because the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ left never left himself without a witness you and I must understand we cannot afford to look at others or watch others when you win when we must understand that our own lives are on display we are all Amen marching or being presented amen to Christ at this moment we are literally walking and being judged by those that judge you are either in step or you out of step this message is calling us to get back in line when I think about Amen how we have come and I think about the the amount of thank you brother the amount of time that has been wasted and each and every one of us perhaps could say Lord I've wasted a lot of time yet is still the mercies of God has been with us this is what we call an intense moment that's my message intense moment a time Amen that that that where where everything is to its extreme something is occurring and it's just moving so fast that you can hardly keep up with it remember Amen the scripture says the vision will be made plain and let him that read it run because why God will not tarry once the mate once the word has been open and it has been God is not in a tarrying mode it's literally moving faster than we can explain or even see with our own eyes but the coming of the Lord is closer now than it ever been before but the random preached a message called desperation and when you are desperate it means that you you are is to the extreme you you are excessive you know you know that that that you got to do something you know it's it's it's your ultimate AAA there are effort to get whatever you desiring to get we know by God's grace that the world is falling apart I consider myself so blessed not because I've been such a great Christian I'm ashamed of myself I wish I was a better Christian but I do know one thing that I am one and I know that this world is falling apart and and there's nothing can stop it it is the very will of God the Word of God being made manifest now the tension is beginning to get stronger all along it's like a woman having a baby you know when she's in her first a few or whatever they call it trimesters or whatever they call it amen when she's going through that labor and and you know she's not ready yet but we know that as the baby begins to come down the channel and come into that place a position of being borning born we realize that everything gets more difficult everything becomes a strain everything become test where the pain may have been a two or three now it's a seven or eight or whatever they need to push that baby through and you and I must understand that God is going to push you if you can't lead you he will push you and his methods are pushing you is to intensify trials in your life it is to bring you to a place that you look up for help God himself did not even spare himself but think about Jesus Christ who was God manifested in the flesh who chose to go to Calvary and as we said before amen it was an intense moment here was a man and you know just like brother Brandon said God didn't allow Jesus to go to Calvary as God he went to Calvary as a man that's why he said my God my God why has thou forsaken me not the pit by not by the power of the Holy Spirit it was his man person when he's nailed there in God's emanate and it was intense in an hour that he knew was there he had already arrived and he got his disciples and said pray with me just pray with me one hour and the Bible said that the disciples could not even pray with him one hour it's like now and what we don't see is that their work they were not trying to be lazy but the demonic powers we're gathering for a great crucifixion and that demonic power amen was literally putting the followers of Christ to sleep at a time he needed them the most we better thank God for Gethsemane because I'm gonna tell you something guys 70 prayed not for himself but for us as well without that prayer he would not have made it because you see even as a man he had to make a decision in an intense time and he understood his suffering it was the worst of all the sufferings that the Romans had crucifixion crucifixion something that you and I can't even comprehend but God even before the foundation of the world chose that kind of a suffering it was the worst on the planet worse than being beheaded worse than being thrown to lions it was worse than the Endicott it was a slow death a painful death and you better believe it that Jesus's crucifixion was worse than any man ever no man had been beaten like that before no man had to suffer like that before it was an intense moment but he had to decide within that moment am I gonna do the will of the Father or am I gonna surrender brother branham said even when he was on the cross all he had to do was move one thing said the angels were there all in the trees waiting for command from him but the Bible said he said his face like a flint people y'all understand what I'm saying if you've never suffered him you ever heard have had any kind of pain let me tell you something your pain cannot be compared to that suffering no matter how bad your pain was it cannot be compared to the suffering that Jesus Christ suffered Oh Calvary and he chose to do it because he loves you he chose to do it because he realized he'd meant without him that would have never been a resurrection without him heaven that was built for us would not have been ever everything that had been done for us after this layer after this world would have come to naught it would have stopped and Satan would have won you know what he would have won he would have won the fact that we the sons of God never replenished the earth it would have brought God's Word to avoid and then God would have no longer been God he couldn't stop the word there was something on the inside of Jesus regardless looking at all the pain he realized he meant what he had to do oh my god and he went through it in an intense moment in an intense moment in that moment when he knew and then that something was happening and Here Come Judas the man amen that's going to betray him and he comes along and in an intense moment he still had to show Judas how much he loved him and not only did he allow Judas to kiss him but he also told Judas that he loved him you understand me so even in these moments that we feel like we have a right not to love somebody god it requires us to love them that's why I said love your enemies do good to them that despitefully use you pray for them you see he's not asking you something asking you to do something that he himself never did he did it in an intense moment God always put the pressure on you he said ordered ever now God allows it God ordains it because he wants you to see what's in you and what's not in you and when we see what's not in us he wants us to see what needs to be in us in order to make heaven he always and he's good at it from the Old Testament healing to the new God has always put his people in battle why because he's a warrior God loves to war and he was and he fights through us so that we can see how great he is come on somebody but God will not spare you he's not gonna put cushions in your battles he wants you to feel he wants you to understand the pain he wants you to go through all of that but when you go through it guess what's at the end a greater revelation of who you are and who God is right though the true Church of God used to be such a supernatural church got it out of the day of Pentecost all the kinds of miracles and signs and wonders were done and and there has such an abundance of gifts and the Paul had to put them all in order now the church can't you can't hardly find anything but it's not it's not it's not the word that's wrong it's the people that's wrong we failed and we folded under pressure we didn't stand when we should have been standing and it's so bad and then in this day the Bible said the love the love of many shall wax cold that's the area that's the time and you must understand what is this it's intensed you must watch and pray all the time why we're dealing with demons Devils press you they will oppress you they will defeat you if they can't they're whole a job and ambition in this realm is to stop the bride of Jesus Christ to bring her to nought but she can't be brought to nought she's protected by the word and she will rise back to her glory no matter what Satan has tried throughout the ages this ride no matter what you look like you will come out as a conqueror you will defeat the devil sometimes we lose battles but but we won't lose the war the problem God said the whole system of Methodist Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterian the whole religious system is falling apart it is why is it they can't take the pressure and right now God is pressurizing his bride is that right if you are an astronaut you must be pressurized God is putting the pressure under you let me tell you something we can always praise God when things are going well but when things are going bad that's when you can tell somebody knows who they serve hallelujah oh it's the truth when things are going bad you need to praise him anyhow it disturbs the devil it shakes him up it confuses him when you praise God when you're going through a real battle oh and God don't always give you what you want and you will never manipulate him you will never by your emotions and by your way of acting and everything else make God do something he doesn't want to do now we as people you may be able to get next to us but not to God God will spank you like the prophet of God said God sometimes feel like kicking us around because of our unbelief in our nonsense but God has a divine purpose and he's more concerned about his divine purpose than he is about your attitude hello the truth oho come on when Jonah went to Nineveh and God didn't do it the way he wanted to he had an attitude God could have wiped him off the face of the earth but you know what God did built him a gorg gorge hid him from the heat of the day right took care of him in spite of why cuz God had a purpose and sometimes we as human we just don't make the right decisions when we are under pressure and God is gonna keep putting the pressure there until you get the answers right mmm the whole religious system is falling apart we know that's the truth our national political world is falling apart the whole thing is at the end hello just help what how many earthquakes and what people you know serum saying right now you ought to be under some kind of pressure and when you find out that all of these things are happening and there is no pressure there is nothing says oh my god the Lord is soon to come and let's get ready something's wrong with your vision spiritually you like the three disciples in the hour that you should be praying you're sleeping hallelujah and you know what Jesus said wake up wake up wake up because he says listen the hour of this darkness is coming and it's coming quickly think about it in one hour the darkness was there this darkness was so heavy it caused Peter to react in a natural and tried to cut a man's head off the same Peter that was right there in Jesus's Bible study when he said thou shalt not kill see this pressure that we're now experiencing it is the demonic darkness amen our team was out of the room you freight these demons of the antediluvian days divas Amen that's all they know what they're doing and you must understand that we're not dealing with any amateurs and I'm gonna tell you something I got to tell you and you know my thing is I don't know how to tell you but I'm gonna tell you like this if you don't have that desire to serve God with all of your heart you need to go somewhere and pray you need to say Lord thou is now that I must die in write to all my dears all my thoughts no matter what it takes I must live because this is a matter of life and death and God has given us a grace by the way of this message to see the season he said it won't come unto you like a feed your children of the light everybody know it men wouldn't want to begin to have birth pain the worst was a further down the road and sometimes you know how it is you can think she could be one or two centimeters you walk down the hall in there 5 10 minutes and she's going to eight you can never judge it and so what I'm saying is we don't know I just know brother Branham in the 6th seal he brings out the fact that there was a great earthquake and even on Good Friday there was a great earthquake right and he ties the resurrection into this great earthquake who's to say and then this coming Good Friday is not it we know we've got greater signs listen that last earthquake why was it 7.1 something people is like not not wake up because if you don't begin to pray and stay in the anointing where Jesus will pray is that right if Jesus Christ had to pray you got the break if he recognized his hour you must recognize his hour and his hour was this the Son of Man will be betrayed is that right he said whatever they did it in the green they will do it in the dry hello and you amen in spirit and in truth you are the son of man which will be betrayed because the World Council of Churches will come together against little flocks like this one what you're going to do in their tense moment when they tell you you got to deny this and you got to do die this and you don't know no no no this is Jesus Christ's name baptism we lit he said I'm saying but we know even in the sixth seal Amen it was those three unclean fogs right that came out of the river Euphrates and those three unclean frogs always look back to where does niacin counseled unclean that swept the world with the Trinity doctrine look at what they're producing look no matter how much word they're getting naked her and naked her all the time unclean hello and then during the time you you your God dropped the walnuts because we wouldn't repent what did he do he brought three beaters for beetles out of the river you I say the river how deliver poo there were demons they were the ones who really inspired the rock and roll now the whole world is polluted and guess what they're doing they're getting naked her and thanking her and taking all their clothes off because rock and roll makes you do that people think is just a beat it's a spirit hello somebody what are you saying this is an intense moment you gotta have it are you you lost yes none of us want to go through the Great Tribulation but how do you know you're not gonna go God said make your call and election shoe you can be sure sealed with the Holy Ghost I'm not saying you're not a Christian but like I said all Christians won't make the rapture this world is falling apart and everybody knows something's gotta happen y'all think America is the only country that's confused it's all over the world all the nations are confused and because this is the hour of confusion all the nations and you must understand not only other nations confused but we find out that even the charges are confused Christians are confused because they're not looking at the hour that you're living in when Malachi 4 went off the scene it should have put us in such a intense time because first of all God cannot come back to the brightest maturity he can't make a move until we mature that's the long sufferings God waited in the days of Noah long-suffering of God because we're overdue with the coming of the Lord it's the truth people even something has to happen all the systems are messed up I think it's on that message is uh was it just listened to it Israel in the church part - I believe it is brother Branham tells us that Russia will control America hello and she's moving in it already now mr. hos yeah I'm the prophet and already told us and he goes on this out say that in some places he said those Russians soldiers would come on our soil and ravage our women he says it People of God and here the world is saying it ain't happening Russia had nothing to do with nothing whether they did or not they come in they're coming and the churches is laying straight there the Bride of Christ I mean what's gonna shake up it's the saddest thing but the Prophet God said God has to bring a squeeze we won't move we just won't move we know what we need to do but like I said Peter James and John knew they needed to pray but instead they gave over to slumber and sleep demonic pressure the tense times it's not a time to sleep or slumber you understand what I'm saying we realized by God's grace that God has given us the greatest message ever hid the face and we are the greatest people those of us a men who keep pushing and I'm telling you make mistakes that's all right God don't look at your mistakes but he wants you to keep pushing he wanted to keep moving you won't Christ in you that's the only way we'll be able to face even even Jacob knew he could not face he saw in the condition he was in he understood that he needed something supernatural knowing the word in your mind is not enough you need the supernatural quickening of God that'll make you walk right talk right live right love right whatever you need that change if it needs to rest a long night we need to do it hallelujah the world is falling apart we're watching it we're seeing it we think that we've got some special deal with God God special deal is his word and obedience to his word hallelujah it is one word misplaced Amen caused this chaos in the world howdy you think that you're gonna misplace a word and expect to make a rapture no no no you've got to come to the fool obedience to the word hmm your Brotherhood I can't do it all yes you can the Bible says repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost is your fool paint it huh but how do you know whether you've got the real one or not because the real one will always say amen to his word always oh I feel like shouting look at it the schools are corrupt everything is corrupt they cannot get better even seducers shall wax worse and worse ah the charges can't get better they don't even know what to do because the Holy Ghost they said has power don't have no power they can speak in tongues they can shout they can dance they can do all of that but they can't live it hello but the real Holy Ghost the real Holy Ghost is birth into a person by the word and not by emotions Oh somebody help me I gotta say that again the real Holy Ghost is brought into a person by the word and not by emotions cause you wouldn't have all those emotions is that right brother and said he went over over to the Africa they were speaking in tongues and shouting and dancing all that interpreting and everything and they were worshipping Devils see so those things are not evidence of the Holy Ghost even though the Holy Ghost may do it you and I need a change in our soul that'll make us love those that hate us speak well of those that persecute us we need more Jesus I don't know about you but I don't want to be caught without the goods and God is gonna test you ain't no ifs ands or buts about it testing time will come mmm all the nations know that's why they're trying to all put together there's been one there's be one they're gonna set rules and regulations right you can't even have a church unless you powder this and then if you do have a church and get caught you're gonna be put in prison or persecuted something's going to happen because you're not with with the system don't tell me about the system because you and I know what the system is like the system then got everybody so to everybody think they private you're never private as long as you got a phone or car they know where you live they know your language they record everything you know say you know boy they'll tell us another story about this woman in Jefferson Field how her son little fella a man he you know just had an issue he was like let me read it a lady was taught walking in a 10-cent store and had a little boy in her arm and she was going through the counter and getting hysterically she could she would pick up something and show it to the little boy and he would just sit and stare does that sound for me don't stare at me because but don't that sound for me you go to these churches and you preach as hard as you can they go they stare won't even say Amen you shake everything you drop yourself you do something's wrong see you go to another town and pick up something and shows it to a little boy he was just there and after a while she picked up a little bell and began to jingle it and a little boy just stand and she stands started screaming and threw up her hands and the people in the tensage store was watching her so they went to her to find out what was wrong and she says my little boy said he is only three years old all of it once a a year ago he'd take and just sit and stare in space and I took him to the doctor and said and the doctor prescribed certain treatments and things and said the doctor was the doctor told me today that he thought he was better but said he isn't better i've shook everything before him that ought to attract a little boy of his age tension everything that would attract a little boy's child of his age I've shook it before him and he just sit and stare in space he is no better right that's something like the Pentecostal church God has shook every gift in the Bible before them and they still sit and stare in space just like it was something wrong it's time that we woke up friends for it gets too late remember God don't gunshot shake those gifts unless he is trying to attract your attention and when God bring a preacher and he's thundering the Word of God to you he's trying to get your attention not the preacher God and when he just constantly pouring his heart out and can't get a reaction there's something wrong like Jesus went to his disciple said can you not pray with me one hour this is intense moment you're saying attack time to relax and get be at ease in Zion no wrong wrong wrong spirit wrong anointing wrong wrong wrong right this is not what God wants when Jesus knew it was his time you know before this time Jesus went fishing Jesus went out and rest in the wilderness he did a lot of things but now it's intense the hour is come and he recognized this hour why because he can see everything in the vision gathered together he knew when he told Judas go do what you must do and do it quickly he understood that Judas was coming back with the soldiers he understood that this pressure Amen that's coming on him this thing that this decision he must make must be tall he must be totally sold out to it he couldn't be 99% or 98 or 95 he had to be a hundred percent is that right because the Bible said after he prayed he said he prayed and he prayed and he prayed and the Bible said his sweat was like two drops of blood and then after all of that the angel came in straight so you gotta understand he poured all out all out but he gave more back and when he whipped the cavalry he was ready for it you and I must be ready for the squeeze we gotta prepare now and the only way we can prepare is my way of prayer that's the way Jesus prepared but you know what he prepared the thing that got me he didn't want to go through it but he said Lord not my will but thine be done and that's what he did he surrendered his total wheel to God intense we fail to see that God has always vindicated himself you know we look at the doctors symbol Amen with the serpentine serpentine the pole and everything the world looks right at it and don't I understand what it's all about but the serpent on the pole is a type of what Jesus came into the earth to accomplish he was made flesh and ordered to take upon himself the judgment of God for sin the foundation of the altar of sacrifice was solid brass typifying the lamb slain from the foundation of the world judgment had already passed upon him when as yet there was no sinner salvation did y'all hear that judgment was already passed on the lamb when there was no sinner he was slain before the foundation of the world do you understand me before you got here he fixed the problem they helped me here yes and you and I must understand this salvation we should never lose the joy of our salvation I know the devil fights us but come on think about Calvary when it gets so bad think about what he did for us the Bible said the suffering of this world can not even be compared right judgment had already been passed upon him when as yet there was no sinner salvation being entirely of the Lord whoa right it ain't you is him but if you don't accept and receive what he's done you'll miss out on it you can't say I can't do it you can and you're right but when you know you can't where do you go David said I go toward I look to Underhill for which cometh my help my help comes from the Lord who's the make of heaven Eli's no I cannot do it but he can he puts us in that those kind of situations so that we can look to him he knows you can't do it from the beginning he knows your failure to begin with but he put you in those hot situations so that you can run to him and he'll come out like a Superman that's what God wants us to do he wants us to see his glory he wants to vindicate his love his power his strength his ability to deliver his ability to hear he wants us to see those things but the only way he can do it he must put us in those intense time oh I love it brother Craig preached on that on that job and that's so true it was an intense time for Joel and you and I haven't had no idea how long job had to suffer who but everything is falling apart and many of us would have thought God hated us if we had gone through that but job searched itself and he kept his integrity that's one thing I love about sister Johnson y'all don't know sister Johnson my sister Johnson from Lima every time I see her she was praising God but you know she had a little moment and I didn't know it she said to brother Craig one day she said brother Craig do you think God is angry with me and I don't know whether it was before it was after then she had a dream of some sort and God showed her you in the palm of my hand Wow somebody help me right and just prior to her death amen by a witness that witness says sister Johnson said [Music] see she had the loss of eyesight she lost her legs she lost a few of her fingers but she never stopped loving God she was concerned about the way God felt about her is God is that Alright and God had that question come up so that he could answer it mm-hmm that's the God I'm talking about he puts us in those situations I was just listening to the prophet of God he said I was so afraid of death he said not afraid to die he said but I just didn't want to become a little cloud I lost something you know see brother Neverland say hey how you doing brother Neville he says her brother but I couldn't shake his hand he was just a cloud he said that's the part I didn't like he said I didn't want to die because I wanted a resurrection I wanted a body I had no idea what it was gonna be like that was intense moment for him and then all of a sudden he was translated or vision or whatever you want to call it whatever you want to call it I was there he said I saw women and men running to me my precious brother hugging me and everything else he said there was a lady there was 97 years old she died but she died a Christian and here she was 20-something years oh he says she was beautiful and never would change the game hallelujah what was it God took that fear by revelation gave him the little thing that he was so concerned about God heard it took him there showed him there will be people they men who would believe your message and there be there to woo somebody said and you know what I'm saying when I say believe it I mean receive it I mean acting upon it hearing and acting upon it hallelujah y'all know that right if you don't have the Holy Ghost the gates won't open for you the gates only open for the Holy Ghost field know hallelujah you love the Lord Oh what is the church is all about the churches are supposed to do what reflect the presence of God while the Sun is gone then when the Sun comes up the moon gone but just before they did you ever notice the moon gets real pale and it goes out and I'll tell you the churches already turned pale its anemic it's got away from the blood you understand me what is the blood the Holy Spirit the life of the blood is a Holy Spirit and that's the problem people have gotten away from the blood that you know everybody won't the culture but don't you understand amen if you're not careful it your starchiness can bring into the mark of the beast hey somebody sho nuff oh yes being starch is not a good thing get me get me people were letting my nature how are you right that's the problem we got the wrong nature if God can take those started use and make them run up the street and jump out of windows I am so sorry the intellectuals of this message have been spoiled it and the only reason why we're not getting the same results that William Branham got is because somewhere something's been mixed but if the word is pill you get the same results we got too many people and then being concerned about their character a demon nature we don't want your nature and God don't want your nature God wants to hold it off it doesn't mean you gotta shout all the time and run up and down the hall all the time but when God comes in here's a job unspeakable you gonna do something I don't care what they say I haven't seen too many people that he didn't have emotions he men cried the game-day they jumped they screamed they're Hollow it may not even last a long time but you're gonna do something now you came face your salvation about that but if there's a change in your life if your life has been changed you got a right to do what your father I don't care if you do cartwheels you gotta write thinking about heaven you ought to do a few every now and again oh you know you look at this thing and I think what it is the Holy Ghost will relieve you of all the tension all the stress is that right don't people listen God knew Peter James and John was gonna be thrown into jail why didn't he stop him there was a purpose they were so filled with the Holy Ghost when they got there thank God and oh they're the testimony service thank you thank God he counted us worthy a man to suffer for his name's sake didn't have to do it but he did who didn't have to do it buddy be hallelujah oh come on he did shucks they shucks they shook heaven in all of hell all of a sudden heaven came down and glory feuless ol Rock that jail they men and all the doors of hell woke a jail opened up y'all hear them saying what I'm trying to say is your praises your worship will open the prison doors of a lot of people who were who are not expecting it to open for them don't think about it let me move on I just got a few more thoughts I'm told money intends time God takes the Hebrew boys it's not God no Dan you knew he was a of God Daniel knew that God called him Daniel knew Amen that he was there in Babylon for a purpose but did you thank God let Daniel just sweep through Babylon Daniel was faithful Danny was faithful far faithful than me hello far faithful then I have a I don't know but I know one thing he was so faithful he got written in the book and God still say try him you know the devil something and y'all gotta realize you're in a warfare and there is no way that you're gonna come through this life without a war hallelujah but you gotta realize who you are you don't have to feel like who you are you understand what I'm saying oh I'm so happy today I feel like a man I am a man I said that because you may not always feel like a god but you are you are a mature God but you need to know that you need to know that your son and daughter of God Alleluia and God's gonna put you to the test but he puts you to the test to see if you trust him then you say oh you can say whatever you want to say about me amen I'm gonna do what God wants me to do I'm gonna keep praying whether you told me not to do it or not matter of fact I'm rolling up my window so you won't have to peek tonight I want you to see me pray right he wasn't afraid let me tell y'all something when Jesus finished Calvary there was no fear in him he did not go to Calvary in fear and no matter how they whipped him never did feel conquer him in that same Conklin he did a fear that's in us if crisis in you perfect love casts out fear we don't have to fear the devil's tactics we know that God is in us and he's on our side Oh God help us Lord I'm not the perfect one he's the perfect one you're not the perfect one he's the perfect one I'm almost done but Daniel was tested he wasn't afraid of the lion he didn't care those things of God in the time of persecution according to history they didn't run from the Lions they ran to the Lions they weren't afraid they knew the next step was glory Paul in an intense moment you think oh my goodness Paul would be falling apart oh I'm gonna die at me rose chopping block no Paul was courageous he had faith all the way to the end and it was an intense moment but Paul wasn't nervous he laughed Oh death where is your sting o grave where is your victory and see that's what we do Oh the doctor say you got this and the doctor say you got that and you go who call on the name of Jesus if you got a call on the name of Jesus like you're mad man if you call on him in desperation it is his love he will answer I've been there before you can't just quietly talk to God dear Jesus in times of desperation you go crazy you just caught you don't care what people think you don't even care if their next-door neighbor hear you praying you need an answer and you know God hears you he's waiting to hear your cry this is not a cry Jesus that's not a cry whisper that's a cry different times I've had to pray with the pillar Jeeva oh yeah somebody else might be sleeping but I ain't y'all know what I'm trying to say what I'm trying to say when these moments come upon you chiraq me shaking little brother Brown said that they prayed and never got an answer but they knew God was able see sometimes we pray and got you don't even hear God is silent what you gonna do to him do win reasons when he's silent anything this is the key if you ask anything in my name believing that you will receive it he says is yours hello the world is already too glad is yours and you want to feel him I gotta hear a voice the voice is the word is that okay those three he bought three Hebrew boys is not I don't care what you do throws in the fiery furnace and I love the way brother Branham said it he said God don't always rush he just moved slowly now where is God they should have known because even though hah no matter how hot and how heated up the fire was it wasn't they weren't feeling here or singeing or anything but then they could look to the side and the people that's carrying them in sweating and eventually the fire consumes them and they're like wow this is nice you understand me and then they look around yo I'm gonna take you somewhere I don't know how they says I don't know how they stood still and let Jesus talk to him because I dove in jumping you know who said something would have been going on your thing but you see when Jesus got in there they had a conversation going on brother and when the King got this a dead weight loss so in three how come I see four let me tell you what it's always another man in the fire whenever you go through something God is always in the fire hallelujah the Bible said the agent of the Lord isn't kept about them that served and loved him don't you ever think you by yourself you're never alone God said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you O Lord you must understand that God loves to display his powers and that's what he does when he's gone taking you through something he's displaying his powers so that you can see it and when you burden when you don't fail and you don't sin and you've done all these wicked things and the devil saying you don't done so much you can't be changed you can't be forgiven he is a liar alright just tell the devil I'm not your son so you can't talk to me like that right it's the devil sauce that's going to hell not the sons of God it is okay I'm almost done think about it to the end of the message here was Peter God and told Peter now you going to deny me three times before the crow you gonna deny me Peter says ain't gonna happen I've been with you all these years and I ain't giving it up it's not going to happen Jesus I rebuke you devil because you see when once the word go out you can't say it's not going to happen if God said so it's going to happen and then you can do about it whether you disagree with I don't believe the world is coming to hear that don't make no sense no difference I don't care how many times Hollywood bring out films about the end of the world it ain't happening like that it's going to happen just like the Bible saying it ain't no big old comic only hit the earth and whatever they say I don't know but the point is they're always trying to deter people from the word that is their making of the devil the Bible says this earth is going to burn and it's going to burn the Bible said there's gonna come a cosplay like never before the Bible says Amen that during that time and then they're gonna be hell stolen stones of a hail what a hundred pounds apiece forget your car these better trust you're not out there you help you know what I'm saying and instead of repenting you know what the people are gonna do get angry with God that's just what they're doing now well if that was God why he let this happen talk to the devil he's the one doing it but here was Peter caught him at 3:26 saying I'm not gonna now you but you got to understand when you are under pressure I'm Peter fail to be pressurized when Jesus told him to pray he didn't frame he's left so because of his sleep he's now being challenged and because he was he's now wasn't ready for that hour you gotta be ready for this oh brother don't say the squeeze is coming we gonna have a squeeze and you must be ready for that squeeze and that's the only way is being ready is that you're gonna have to have a prayer life intimate life with Christ you know why because i'ma tell you something the devil is smart you know what he tell you you might as well give me and you lost anyway he'll tell you these things oh you see that the under the squeeze you might make a mistake he says see there you ain't ready but if you don't understand the mystery of it what are you talking about I've been born ready even when I was a sinner I was ready because my name was written in the land with the life and when Christ saved the world when he died on Calvary I was there and he saved me he saved you but the devil is smart he gonna talk he gonna test you and try you till you give your life but you know what I love the Lord because he don't let us cross Jordan alone oh my god yes you love the Lord I do I remember being in California at California but uh Arizona and in the brothers the sister was their brother Isaac Noriega and and she was dying and they wanted the minister to go pray for the Lord told me not to go this happened twice to be my life that she was going on to be of the Lord and when when they went to the hospital somehow God had gathered all the children in nobody called her one of the other she was there laying there and when they all got in there she comes out of her coma and she says all it was beautiful and she began to tell the children trying to bless them and help them along because some of them have been backslidden and all of a sudden she broke out an amazing grace lay back down and went on home I'll have said when I heard that I say see that's what I'm talking about Jesus if I gotta die let me die like that you know what I'm saying so so that not only I I know where I'm going but I'm point is that other people don't know that my living has not been in vain you love the Lord who I love stuff like that but when Peter the Bible said when Peter saw that he had forsaken and denied Jesus Christ to his face the Bob said he wept bitterly hello did Jesus Christ hate him afterwards did he hold a grudge hello why because he was ordained to do exactly what he did he couldn't have got around and if he wanted to and then after the resurrection what did Jesus say make sure you go get Peter God didn't take the keys from him he still had the keys and what I'm trying to tell you is yes even in our failures God still gonna use us to his glory but what happened in these intense moment and you and I must understand they're coming I left some things out but you and I must know it's coming hello right now sometimes people that you live with people that you work with people that you love amen they want to put you in a place where you got to decide on what to do right or wrong whether you're gonna do the thing that's right or whether you're gonna do the thing wrong intense moments because you got to come out with the right answer cuz you the one that's being tested you the one that's being tried and God is watching you scouring your grades you know the Lord never give up the word for something else the word is always right and brother man say before we can go bad before we do wrong we must reject the truth first that's tan the Lord is good I just want to encourage my friends I don't know whether they be looking at me and South Africa at some point in time but I just want them to keep the faith times are in tensed and somebody that's going through an operation of some sort you know that life is in the hands of God and we could always remember that fear is the thing that torments us faith is the thing that gives us victory I just believe when you ask God for anything and if you believe it you hold that you hold fast to that that right yeah you hold fast to it because that's that victory it's like like okay home Moses hold it right and you got to understand Joshua Lord stand still let the Sun stand still and all we have to do some time is just stand still and God will do the rest it's what we started working and trying to work it out somebody call me the other day trying to figure out something that I said brother I can't I can't this can't be done this ain't gonna work by figuring it out we need God God will do the work you and I can't do it we can reason with in our minds that everything and come up with a solution but who's to say that solution is right the right solution is cast your cares upon him for he cares for you that's the solution Oh Lord ah it's good to us me Jean Grae how sweet the sound there say all right like me I was was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I just listen to a message just evening and brother venom says when we ever taught whenever we tried to fix a problem by reason we've already gone wrong faith is what fixes every problem reasoning he said that's the thing they got even the trouble in the beginning trying to reason it out you can't you you we don't know why certain things happen to this that or the other but you got to understand God is in control we must remember God is in control hallelujah when we been there ten thousand years bright shining on the Sun we know less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun and remember God and I'll always tell you things sometimes God do things because he wanted to him he didn't tell the Prophet everything when that woman a man's son had died she come running to him and he lied you had no idea what was going on hello God don't tell us everything and you and I must understand he doesn't he won't always do what we want him to do he does what he wants to do but he looks some time to see our response guess what there was tension on Elijah God hadn't shown now what am I supposed to do go find out what's going on with this lady give him a bra ha giving my kill my dad and none of it worked and the lady says I ain't turning around from this brain Elisha Roger came down and he laid himself on that that by that time God gave him the vision of what to do you understand me it's like when brother branham pray for that death daughter that young lady and she died God didn't show him that she was supposed to be dead about 10 years before but when she was younger she drowned right and God spared that lady's life that she got saved and ready to change to go cross then he took her life well that's it said to God you owe me an explanation God don't owe nobody no explanation he's God and you and I must understand that when God began to do things with us sometime he does sometimes he doesn't she shared this tend the other but in all that he does we must always recognize God in the midst of it if we fail to see God we missed the whole thing you love the Lord please God please God please God please God please God please God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God race car I Love You Lord and I live my lord to worship you O my soul rejoice take joy my king in what you may be a sweet sweet sound in your ear oh I Love You Lord and I live my lord to worship you O my soul rejoice take joy my king in what you you may be a sweet sweet sound in your love the Lord we pray over the offering father we thank you we thank
