and Lord breaking every fat of the enemy lifting us up on the higher ground father just take me out of the way and Lord use me just as a vessel and Lord willever you speak to us we shall give back the glory and honor to you in Jesus Christ Name Lord we pray amen amen amen we want to read from the book of Genesis and chapter one and we want read from verse 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish Over the Sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created him male and female created he them amen amen so we are in the image of God not this flesh but our souls amen amen and also I want to read from the book of John uh chapter one John chapter 1 and you won't read from we can read from verse one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and we can jump to verse 12 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of [Music] God oh my amen amen amen amen amen I always tell the church that whether my mother was there or not there or my father was there or not there I was going to be [Music] here amen amen because we are born not by the will of Flesh not by the will of man but by the will of God amen amen amen amen so you must know who you are amen amen amen amen and then we are also reading from The Book of Romans uh Romans chapter 8 R and you want to read from verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption where we cry AB father and the spirit is bear witness with with our spirit amen amen the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God so let nobody tell you it's not somebody to tell you amen amen but the spirit of God and then your spirit must bear witness that you are a child of God you know when we used to be in denominations the Catholic would come and tell you you are all the children of God but the Bible says amen the spirit of God hallelujah must bear witness that you are a son of God you are a ad of God amen amen amen amen thank you Lord oh praise God you and if children is it are we there yes amen and if children then hairs hairs of God Amen and join hairs with Christ amen if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified for I Rec that the suffering of this present time are not whether to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us not revealed to us the glory is in us the glory which shall be revealed in US amen amen wow I love that amen amen for the what is that 19 for the honest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made uh subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who are subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself uh also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption in the Glorious Liberty of the children of God bless may the Lord blessing of his wife you can be seated for a while I just want to speak about manifested sons of God in the end time amen amen amen amen the Bible is telling us amen amen we were made in the IM of God when God said let us make man in our image you were in the mind of God you were in the gene of God Amen but then of course we know the fall put us out of Amen but now in the end time that's the time that you are living in amen the Bible says the sons of God must be manifested and all the creatures all the animals all nature they want to know who the sons of God are and this is the time when the sons of God can be manifested all those even the devil didn't know who the Son of God is but today in the time that we are living in Hallelujah it is a time of manifestation it's a time that even the nature all the creatures they must know who you are amen amen amen uh in the message brother Bram says here um adoption adoption [Music] amen amen paragraph 19 par is that French yes quite a bit different all right brother says tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested out of this time now when were there ever a time in the history there was to manifest the time to deliver all nature the nature itself is growing waiting for the time of the manifestation before the the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out before all the Old Testament on down there there couldn't have been manifestation it had to wait till this time now all things have been brought coming shaping up to a headstone manifestation of the sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into this man so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ till it will join him and his CH together amen this is the time when the fullness of the what has come to manifestation as he say in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when it shall begin to sound then the mystery hallelujah hallelujah the mystery of who God is the mystery of who you are the mystery of redemption hallelujah hallelujah all shall be made manifest and that's why in the time that we are living in oh hallelujah hallelujah we have known every mystery that was hidden in the Bible amen and that Myster is God himself amen amen because God the Bible says in the beginning there was a word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and those who believed in his word he gave them power to be sons of God Amen so it the message of the hour the revealing of the Mysteries the opening of The Seven Seals the sounding of the seven Thunders hallelujah hallelujah make you to recognize who you are amen am hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen now you can know who you are because the word which was hidden has now been made manifest amen amen amen amen oh praise God am amen amen in the message that seed amen amen uh paragraph 149 amen amen the prophet says here God has hid it from the wise from the eyes of the wise and prudent and promise to reveal it to the sons of God amen amen so this word is only revealed to the sons of God to manifest who they are amen and that's why those who are not the sons of God even if you give them this message even if you preach to them they cannot understand it because they are not from God this word is only to manifest who you are that the sons of God Sons Daughters of God who come from heaven and they are going back to heaven and why are we here why are you here brother to manifest the world to manifest the creatures that you are a son of God amen amen amen amen God wanted to know you I mean the world to know amen amen amen that you are the Son of God amen amen amen amen let me repeat again God has hid it from the eyes of the wise and The Prudent and promise to reveal it the sons of God in the last days when the sons of God will be made manifest when God Sons that Rejoice even before the the world when the Great revelation of the godhead and things would be brought down in the last days you Manifest this thing through the sons of God hallelujah hallelujah that's why you find out amen the the those who are not sons of God they said they are three gods [Music] because they don't know who their father is hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah why because the mystery of who God is is not revealed to them amen but thank God you are being manifested by the revealing of the word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah this word comes to manifest who you are and from today you must know who you are not just people of God no we are not people of God we are Sons and Daughters of God you amen amen you know was giving us the the the par brother was giving us like a parable amen amen he said a farmer got an egg and he said this egg is it for a kite is it for a crow what is it for the only thing for me to realize to know what it is let me put it under the hand and when it hatches I will know what it is so he took he took the egg under the hand and then the the cheek was hated under the the hand this iglet was HED on the head amen amen and then uh it was also scratching the ground like the cheeks but its nature its nature was different it also tried to to eat worms but it could not eat because its nature was different Hallelujah but one day the mother eagle said I must have laid my egg somewhere I must go to look for that egg it must haveed by this time and he started crying out hallelujah hallelujah baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and then you said amen baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you said amen amen no preacher you say Amen am hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my amen amen original of sin no the the the the woman not sleep with a serpent the snake no it was a man walking in the garden [Applause] and then he said amen hallelujah hallelujah amen amen why you are manifesting who you are by raling the word by receiving the word amen that that iglet identified the mother because they were the same nature and that's why when the world is coming out it's only looking for the sons and the of God amen amen amen amen you know I I was I was traveling somewhere in the taxi amen amen so I started sharing the word with with the the people who were traveling with me so talked about God godhead oh they say oh sure sure sure oh sure sure then we went very far they were enjoying the I I discover that he was a Pentecostal then he said no pastor I kept quiet you know no Pastor more of the word then the told me now speak about the serpen seed so when I start to speak about the serpen seed no no no no no no it can't be how can how can a snake sleep with a with a with a woman I said no it was not a snake a snake came after the [Music] cast but he was a working man the garden he was he was even talking Hallelujah that's why when God came down Hallelujah he never talked about the trees from the garden he talked about production Hallelujah in pain you should bring forth children in pain you shall bring forth children why because it was reproduction Hallelujah hallu I say the Bible says it were the trees in the garden and John says they they axate under the tree he was not talking about the natural trees he was talking about human beings and Jesus comes and says I am the vine you are the branches hallelujah hallelujah then Jesus comes and says you know I speak in Mysteries so that you the Son of God you can know and understand but to them are outside things are spoken in Parable so that they can hear and not understand hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so the sons of God are supposed to understand every mystery every mystery in the days of the voice of the seven Angel When shall begin to sound all the mystery all the mystery shall be revealed hallelujah hallelujah do you believe that brother amen am so this is the time of the manifestation of of God I believe Al the Sons of Satan are supposed to be manifested amen amen amen so brother you must know who you are amen amen and where you come from and why you are here that's true amen amen Jesus says I Come From Heaven and I go back to Heaven amen amen they are sons of God amen amen they are supposed to be born by the word of God Amen born not by the will of the man nor of the will of the flesh or the will of the blood amen amen it must be by the word so you must be born again am amen amen I think let me just use this one so that we can go quickly amen First Peter 1 verse 23 amen amen amen being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which leaveth an abidance forever amen amen for All Flesh is grass and all the glory of man as the flow of grass the grass wither and the flower there Falls away but the word of the Lord in you in me and your forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you amen amen you know when Jesus told uh Nicodemus you must be born again Oh my he looked at Jesus and said a big man like me maybe he had a very big stomach Amen to be born again to enter into my mother's room that's impossible no we are speak speak of spiritual things Hallelujah Hallelujah by Revelation you must understand that you must be born again born by the word of God the incorruptable word of God meaning that you must be born of God amen amen amen amen then you can know who your father is and who your God is and whom to worship do you know Brothers many people even don't know who God is they don't know they don't know who their father is you ask them oh who you worship I worship God I God but they don't know who they worship amen amen and you must know who you woring amen amen in the in the world Jesus and the Samaritan amen amen the woman said that we watch for this mountain and watch for that mountain Jesus told her you don't know whom you worship but we know whom we worship because salvation come from the Jews salvation com from the Jews amen amen and he says but the time is coming and now is the time when the true worshipers amen who worship the father in the spirit and in the truth amen amen amen amen they are here now because they have known who they father amen amen amen am you tell somebody who is your god who is your God oh God my God my God my God is a Creator you know even the Jews even the the the the the Pharisees the phes they didn't know who their God was amen amen but they were religious people they worship to church they were priests but they didn't know who their father is hallelujah hallelujah and today brother did you know who your father is you say God God which God is that there are many gods Hallelujah there are many gods you must know who your God is even Satan wanted to be worshiped as God and I want to say this today many churches many worshipers they worship the devil in the church without knowing amen hallelujah hallelujah so I say brother you must know whom you worship you must know who your father is hallelujah hallelujah oh my so one time I tell somebody that do you know God my God the one I [Music] worship amen he is the word the god I worship is the word he said what are you saying I said I worship God who is the word in the beginning there was a and the was with God and the was God hallelujah hallelujah so if you give somebody the word and he doesn't believe the word he's not woring God heing the devil Hallelujah oh Hallelujah did you know in the G of Eden the devil just took the word that God has spoken and just changed it and then the fall came in is that right so meaning that now those people started worshiping the devil instead of worshiping God but we thank God Amen God came quickly and slew the lamb and the L amen and redeemed Adam Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah hallu so today people worship the devil without knowing that is true amen amen for example for example the Bible says baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus and if somebody baptized in name of the father son and is who is he worshiping the devil amen amen very plain very plain brother the Bible says no woman preacher is that right I don't per a woman to preach or to accept author of a man and then Paul goes on and says amen amen him who who has understand should understand that these things are the Commandments of God but if he doesn't have H is it understanding or wisdom or something like that let him be like that hallelujah hallelujah and now if you see a woman preacher who is sheing without knowing hallelujah oh my oh my am are you seeing now today now brother sister if the word says this and you do this you are worshiping the devil without knowing hallelujah hallelujah if the Bible says men should have short hair and then you see a man with long hair even if he says he believes the message he doesn't know he worshiping hallelujah hallelujah oh praise God the beginning there was a word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made manifest and those who believe in that word they become the manifested Son and the daughters of God Amen so the purpose of this message hallelujah hallelujah is to manifest the sons of God Amen they'll believe the word and the word will live in them and they manifest the character of the father amen amen amen amen praise God amen amen amen ah maybe just for to go quickly can we go to Christ The Mystery of God [Music] reveal amen amen paragraph 233 I might just jump some other things here amen amen amen I would have readen from John chapter 8 but I think let us just leave it amen amen it takes a revelation amen amen now watch blessed are thou Simon Jonah says which means son of Jonah see blessed are thou for flesh and blood never revealed this to you you never it from some school you never but my Father which is in heaven has revealed it to you notice what he said this rock that's the predestinated seed of God that has received this light and given the keys to the kingdom Upon This Rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ is amen of who the word is he is the the full manifested God Upon This Rock not the father Son and Holy Ghost and him being the second person I build my church and the Gates of Hell will never shake it down never Prevail against I'll build my church Upon This Rock a revelation of Jesus Christ and that's why the prophet says in the church ook must know the importance of Revelation of Revelation to a Christian than anything that you are looking and you pray for Revelation the revelation of the word hallelujah hallelujah look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation Christ life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the all things what God is trying to do Hallelujah to make you to be a revelation of who Christ is Christ in you the hope of Glory Hallelujah when the word of God comes the sons of God hallelujah that's when they can manifest amen amen the character of their father amen amen amen amen then you start manifesting amen the character of the father because the the life of the father is in you Lord amen amen amen amen you can you can hear the word amen amen even without the Bible oh Hallelujah Hallelujah you understand amen and that's why the prophet says even Abel and Cain didn't have a bible to read but it was revealed to Abel by faith which is a revelation Abel offered to God a more ex sacrifice than that of Cain godi that it was right yes is that right is that right brother Revelation is a manifestation of the character of the father in the son is that right so this Revelation must come from your father that's what Jesus told them amen he says Flesh and Blood have not revealed the things it's my Father in heaven so the word of God Amen is not revealed to a person by education no not for school no it is God to reveal it to you and he reveals it only only only to his son amen amen so what's a revelation then brother a revelation is a supernatural element amen amen amen given by a superatural being amen amen and given to Asal people for Asal purpose I want to repeat again what's a revelation a revelation is a supernatural element given by a supernatural being to Asal people for Supernatural purpose and what's the purpose manifestation of the sons of God amen amen Christ in you amen amen amen amen is the hope of glory when you get a revelation it means that the blood of the father is in you then you walk like your father you talk like your father you forgive like your father hallelujah hallelujah amen am you talk like your father amen you forgive like your father amen amen hallelujah hallelujah you dress like your father young men will Mar like their father young men will Mar like their father hallelujah hallelujah that's what a revelation is is that right Brothers amen amen amen amen the character of the father will be in you because the blood of the father will be in you amen amen and you'll be reflecting the character of the life of your father amen amen ah let us read this uh paragraph 350 state of a perfect man 350 amen amen amen 350 the prophet says here if you die you take the blood out of a man you emal him the trouble of it is a lot of them never got embalmed you take the blood out of the
