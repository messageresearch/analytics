[21:26] the secret in enjoying a song is when
[21:32] you can remove yourself and you and the
[21:35] song becomes one and then at that point
[21:40] in time you feel exactly what the writer
[21:44] was feeling we need when he he wrote the
[21:49] song when he was caught up you get
[21:51] caught up to understand that every song
[21:54] has a spirit behind you
[21:56] when you catch it oh you just ride it
[22:00] and the reality of that song fuel and
[22:07] floods your soul you love the Lord thank
[22:11] you brother
[22:12] Amen I tell you what I do appreciate our
[22:15] musicians you heard me I said shines for
[22:22] the marshal I like teasing him God is
[22:31] good to us
[22:32] I appreciate the Lord I love brother
[22:35] Basha I know he has this thing about
[22:37] himself I think he judges himself so
[22:40] strict and so harshly sometimes he can
[22:43] hardly overcome there were twists things
[22:46] on him but you know the grace of God is
[22:49] always with him I see him pressing
[22:52] through it all all of us have mind
[22:54] battles but some mind battles are
[22:56] tougher than others and when you see a
[22:59] person just pressing through all those
[23:01] mind battles and yes surely God ordained
[23:04] his battles and gotta see him victorious
[23:07] at the end he loved the Lord I do oh my
[23:16] god he God is good to us we're gonna do
[23:20] another want to work with a thought here
[23:23] we'll be coming from Matthew 28 thank
[23:35] you Corinthians 3:16 I love people
[23:44] sometimes I get in trouble cuz I love
[23:47] him so much but that's okay I'd rather
[23:51] be that way than to be hateful I was
[23:57] telling brother Troy back in the back
[24:00] but the random talked about a man who
[24:03] was um kind of like fellow homeless he's
[24:08] got he got hit by a car the ambulance
[24:12] and all claim day they were talking and
[24:18] they said he overheard them say why we
[24:24] wasting our time he's no good he's not
[24:27] even worth nothing the man kind of came
[24:32] out of what he was going through he says
[24:33] I am or something because Jesus Christ
[24:37] purchased me with his blood I think
[24:42] about how the devil thought we were
[24:43] worth nothing none of us turn out to be
[24:48] like a Michael Jackson or Beyonce thank
[24:52] God we would worth nothing he's been all
[24:58] that time with us if we still turn our
[25:01] backs on him
[25:02] we found a greater and a better partner
[25:05] Jesus Christ himself when the devil
[25:09] thought that we were nothing God say he
[25:11] is worth something she is worth
[25:13] something
[25:14] matter of fact one of them was worth ten
[25:17] thousand world's whoo so I thank God for
[25:22] him who say we are worth something
[25:25] thought it was worth paying the
[25:29] price for us Matthew 28:19 and Jesus
[25:37] came and spake unto him saying all power
[25:40] is given unto me in heaven and earth not
[25:48] some all 2nd Corinthians 3:16 2nd
[25:59] Corinthians 3:16 and 17 the devil tells
[26:11] you you not worth something anything you
[26:13] let him know he's looking in the wrong
[26:17] book because in God's book I was worth
[26:19] something worth more than we can explain
[26:26] or even know that the God of heaven were
[26:30] fashioned himself like a man and come
[26:33] down and die for us huh the God of
[26:37] heaven 2nd Corinthians 3:16 nevertheless
[26:46] when it shall turn to the Lord the veil
[26:50] shall be taken away but we all with open
[26:55] face beholding as in a glass the glory
[26:59] of the Lord are changed into the same
[27:03] image from glory to glory I just love
[27:08] that word glory even as by the Spirit of
[27:12] the Lord am I read that one again but we
[27:17] all with open face beholding as in a
[27:22] glass open face beholding as in a glass
[27:28] the glory of the Lord are changed into
[27:34] the same image from glory to glory even
[27:41] as by one spirit of the Lord showing God
[27:51] changing us as we behold his change is
[28:01] that we're being transformed as we stare
[28:04] into his face let us pray father we
[28:11] thank you for your amazing grace we
[28:19] thank you for being so good to us
[28:24] you have given us strength to fight and
[28:27] courage to continue on you have routed
[28:33] us in this magnificent word of yours you
[28:41] have taught us and you have real
[28:44] revealed to us there is only one God and
[28:48] you are that true and living God you
[28:51] have shown us your face we thank you
[28:56] lord
[28:57] be merciful to us and may we continue to
[29:02] humble ourselves as we approach your
[29:05] holy throne thank you Lord for the
[29:10] reading of the word bless each and every
[29:12] heart here tonight in Jesus Christ's
[29:14] name we pray amen you may be seated
[29:19] it is amazing how God is
[29:31] so amazing and God I think God for
[29:39] excuse me excuse me I tried to warn you
[29:46] I felt it coming up but just to see how
[29:51] God has brought us and given us this
[29:57] opportunity to see things that even the
[30:00] prophets of old wanted to see and then
[30:08] we find out that all of the things that
[30:11] our prophet of the day did see he goes
[30:17] on to say that if he if it was up to him
[30:20] he would rather live in this day he
[30:24] wanted to live to see the translation of
[30:28] the saints he wanted to be in that last
[30:31] and final battle yet God has given us
[30:36] the opportunity that will see this
[30:41] wicked for of ours openly put to shame I
[30:47] can imagine how he must have felt when
[30:50] he tried to hold Enoch back no doubt he
[30:57] he talked to Enoch I'm talking about the
[30:59] enemy you know death had power on the
[31:01] earth before Calvary and that was his
[31:06] tool or his weapon tree of fear and
[31:10] everybody during that time fear death
[31:13] because nobody knew how it was there was
[31:17] nobody who came back or would come back
[31:19] and say hey I was on the other side and
[31:21] it's all right but there was no one
[31:23] oh no matter how great the men of God
[31:29] was at that time from Adam all the way
[31:32] up there was nobody who would come back
[31:34] and say there is a land and
[31:40] we find out that in the history when
[31:43] Christ came and Daryl Mount
[31:45] Transfiguration he stood there not I
[31:48] can't imagine how those disciples felt
[31:51] not only were they in the presence of
[31:54] Jesus but now they seem to you ever
[31:57] thought about it two of the greatest men
[32:01] ever stood on the face of the earth
[32:02] Moses and Elijah there with Jesus and
[32:05] guess what they knew them Jesus did not
[32:11] have to say that this is Moses or this
[32:15] is Elijah but they knew them immediately
[32:21] Peter got so excited he said let us
[32:24] build three Tabernacles and then Jesus
[32:28] had to correct his theology and Moses
[32:33] and Elijah disappeared and Jesus stood
[32:37] and then the voice of God thundered out
[32:40] of the heavens and said this is my
[32:42] beloved son hear ye him they call it a
[32:46] revelation that this man that they came
[32:50] to pray with whether just a man
[32:53] well he was Lord of Heaven and we find
[32:58] out by God's grace they they they
[33:01] perhaps never was the same had not even
[33:05] been to Pentecost yet but they saw
[33:09] something that no other man had ever
[33:10] seen throughout all history and they
[33:13] were told keep it a secret
[33:17] remember to the time when Jesus was on
[33:19] the earth when he would heal people he
[33:22] tell him go tell nobody don't doubt
[33:23] nobody soon as they could see some party
[33:27] they were telling it and Jesus wasn't
[33:31] just saying that the Bible said he was a
[33:33] man of no reputation he wasn't trying to
[33:36] build his own kingdom he was not trying
[33:38] to build his own reputation because he
[33:40] knew all of us at the end of the day it
[33:43] was all he is anyhow but he came to do
[33:49] the Father's will and his purpose was to
[33:54] Claire that this invisible God he's
[33:57] alive and well that he is the same
[34:01] yesterday today and forever he change
[34:04] his nod I want to in it I want to to to
[34:12] uh read something here before I give the
[34:17] title the prophet of God said see
[34:23] everything will be finished Oh scuse me
[34:25] that's not the code I want Lord by your
[34:30] grace by your help
[34:33] I claim everyone that hears this message
[34:39] this is the token message
[34:42] I claim bill for God I pray thee Lord
[34:45] both here this morning and those that
[34:49] were here on tape thank God for the
[34:52] tapes and if there be a seed anywhere
[34:57] that's predestinated Lord to hear the
[35:00] word of this last day may they come now
[35:03] sweetly and humbly and lay their
[35:07] trophies down at the cross or their
[35:11] cells as a trophy of the grace of God
[35:14] that called them may they be filled with
[35:17] the Holy Spirit and display the token of
[35:23] the life of Jesus Christ in his
[35:26] resurrection as long as they remain on
[35:29] earth granted he said Lord I claim and I
[35:38] looked up the word claim it means to you
[35:42] know how people write a claim a cause of
[35:44] claim they have a post or have a post
[35:47] that will signify all the land that is
[35:50] theirs and and then nail it in the
[35:53] ground that says I was here first or
[35:55] boom this is my land
[35:57] that means nobody else can take it it's
[35:59] mine they may go by way of the legal
[36:02] aspect but it's their land for instance
[36:05] if all of a sudden you know
[36:07] you've been living on this land all your
[36:09] life and all of a sudden you you you're
[36:13] hunting and your bullets strike oil
[36:21] but that oil is yours on your land and
[36:28] whatever that all is worth your worth
[36:32] you may have been beat men price as
[36:35] nothing before but now you got a billion
[36:39] dollars worth of oil coming out of your
[36:41] field in one instance you have become a
[36:45] billionaire and because you've got a
[36:47] claim on it you got paperwork you got
[36:49] the law on your hand not on your side
[36:52] nobody can take it from you the only
[36:54] thing they could do is offer you
[36:55] something maybe a price and it's up to
[36:59] you and what you want to do with it
[37:02] but when you claim something there is
[37:05] something that you you know it's yours
[37:07] right we we've heard many times naming
[37:11] and clean it right you claim it you know
[37:13] you is yours of course you're part of
[37:15] your inheritance is that right remember
[37:19] the Bible says that at the opening of
[37:23] the word Jesus comes to claim that which
[37:31] he purchased and what did he purchase he
[37:35] purchased his bride back his intent
[37:39] inheritance his territory that's what he
[37:42] came to purchase back because we lost it
[37:47] in the beginning when even Adam and Eve
[37:50] fell we lost it but Jesus came back and
[37:53] purchased it and you and I know the
[37:55] story of the kids new redeemer he had to
[37:59] be a kinsman like I was telling my son
[38:02] one time I said that's just right there
[38:05] would be a nice sister for you person
[38:07] for you to marry he said but i reaiiy
[38:10] was raised up with her she feel like my
[38:12] sister i said who else she's supposed to
[38:13] feel like when you marry somebody in the
[38:18] church who do you marry your sister
[38:22] in the Lord Yahoo what I'm saying when
[38:25] they before God brought the law amen you
[38:28] must understand everybody brought
[38:30] married a sister who Abraham married
[38:33] okay that's all I'm saying
[38:35] and all that was was was tying into
[38:39] what's the relationship or or the
[38:42] kinsmen ship that you and you and that
[38:44] young lady had I'm your brother by birth
[38:48] not naturally spiritually and our Father
[38:53] is the same God or our God is our Father
[38:57] right that's why we call each other
[39:00] brothers and sisters and we're not
[39:03] supposed to marry outside of the family
[39:07] that's the truth we're not supposed to
[39:10] marry another man in that I'm work was
[39:13] Satan you don't marry a guy go out there
[39:16] and marry among the world because you
[39:17] might get something different than what
[39:22] the family is producing see so you and I
[39:25] must understand that claim that God had
[39:29] meant God claimed you and when God gives
[39:34] you the Holy Ghost you know what he did
[39:36] he put his stake poo into your heart
[39:41] when he gave you the Holy Ghost he was
[39:44] signifying this is mine and Satan touch
[39:48] not they all in the wine I staked my
[39:54] claim on the claim that the Prophet
[39:58] claimed not only that I'm going to hear
[40:05] this word but I'm gonna also come to a
[40:08] place where I will manifest Jesus Christ
[40:11] and he'll alone but the devil don't want
[40:18] us to see this but when that seal let's
[40:20] say for example Amen who was the seventh
[40:23] seal to the Old Testament church it was
[40:25] Jesus Christ himself
[40:27] and when that she'll was broken
[40:30] what happened Thunder roll
[40:34] hallelujah it should be earth and the
[40:38] resurrection took place when the seal of
[40:44] this day was open
[40:45] what was it producing a resurrection Oh
[40:50] commotion about a transformation now we
[40:56] realize they made the completion of
[40:58] crisis come into view and he's producing
[41:01] himself over again in the form of a
[41:04] bride she will be just like him she will
[41:08] act like him she would walk like him she
[41:10] talk like him hallelujah
[41:12] why because he placed his spirit in her
[41:18] you could never do it on your own but we
[41:22] need a god to claim us oh come on
[41:26] somebody you got to realize how
[41:29] important it is to be sealed with the
[41:31] Holy Ghost because when you seal by God
[41:33] hallelujah that means he's placed you
[41:34] and we had a property tell us amen
[41:37] no matter what the devil tries to do
[41:39] that seal cannot be broken
[41:43] Hey that means we're coming and we are a
[41:47] journey and we're on our way
[41:49] amen to a perfection and then then the
[41:51] devil cannot stop us why because the
[41:56] life is in the root is that what about
[42:02] says he was the root and offspring of
[42:06] David Hellfire yeah and who was a real
[42:10] David Jesus Christ himself he is the
[42:15] root remember the Bible said though
[42:17] she's dead but there were those who did
[42:19] not stand because they had no root
[42:22] hallelujah amen and all the reason why
[42:25] were you know the root is it's just that
[42:26] thing that shows where you came from
[42:34] well where are your roots where did you
[42:37] come from where did you begin and you
[42:44] I see by God's grace it meant that we
[42:47] must claim as we must put our stake down
[42:49] in it and says I'm not moving off of it
[42:52] because God has given me your faith to
[42:55] stand and to know no matter what I look
[42:57] like I'm still part of him mmm
[43:01] y'all know it's true it's not what you
[43:04] look like at the outside this thing
[43:07] works from the inside out that's why I
[43:10] brought up about that Lynn who looked
[43:12] like he was of no value the world threw
[43:15] him out the devil cast him out it even
[43:17] said hey he worth no good but one thing
[43:19] about that man he could care less on how
[43:21] poor and radley he was he knew that God
[43:24] had purchased his salvation that's what
[43:28] I'm talking about
[43:29] like I said this morning I believe I
[43:32] said I want to meet Lazarus who who was
[43:34] there at the rich man table he had to
[43:38] read there in in the scriptures where
[43:40] the Word of God says never have I seen
[43:42] the righteous forsaken nor his seed
[43:44] begging bread he was a Jew this this
[43:47] Lazarus he was a real convert and no
[43:52] doubt he must have thought to himself
[43:54] never had seen the righteous forsaken
[43:55] nor see baby bread but Lord look at this
[43:59] you know the devil was in his mind at
[44:03] times but you know what somehow he kept
[44:06] his integrity he stayed right there no
[44:09] matter how poor and no matter how hungry
[44:11] he became he knew that God was God and
[44:15] he wasn't gonna worship nobody else oh I
[44:18] want to talk to him when I get over
[44:19] there I want to know his story cuz when
[44:24] it look like even God wasn't on his side
[44:26] he stayed there is that right you know
[44:29] why because God had already claimed him
[44:31] he was already God's that's what God
[44:36] knew where he was going before he closed
[44:39] his eyes to sleep
[44:43] God knew even the rich man or the rich
[44:46] young ruler whoever he was Amen that
[44:48] rather have his business and rather
[44:50] carry on than the Father Christ he also
[44:53] knew where he was going to God even
[44:56] packed him with the gift of
[44:58] preaching but he didn't even want to
[44:59] preach hello somebody but when you claim
[45:07] something you know it means you claim it
[45:11] is to to demand you know a BIOS by
[45:16] virtue or by right so you saying this is

[47:07] he saw this girl she didn't look so hot
[47:09] forgive me for saying like that
[47:11] you didn't look so well right it wasn't
[47:15] her body that he was after it wasn't

[47:19] faces all kinds of dress and fan Dingles
[47:23] or whatever she didn't have all of that
[47:24] matter of fact she looked just like she
[47:26] was she was just a dishwasher it wasn't
[47:32] her money and her inheritance from this
[47:34] world that attracted her it was her
[47:36] characters you want to make a wrap job
[47:39] you must have the character that God is
[47:42] looking for I love you no matter what
[47:48] I'm claiming this thing I'm staking my
[47:50] claim my poles are already in there
[47:54] hallelujah cry because he's in me he's
[47:59] the one he meant
[48:00] lord have mercy when I learned by
[48:03] revelation no man can keep it so God
[48:06] it's the keeper of the soul I don't know
[48:10] maybe nilly maybe I don't know what I'm
[48:12] talking about but I would not be here
[48:14] today have not God kept me I didn't keep
[48:18] myself I've never kept myself but it's
[48:21] been God who has been my protector it is
[48:24] God he's been my provider it is God who
[48:26] have run roblox for me times when I
[48:33] would have done evil he stopped it
[48:37] somebody help me here see it has always
[48:41] been God never me I'm just glad to be in
[48:45] the place that I am right now
[48:52] hey God good
[48:54] to us he said everything he finishes
[48:58] they see everything would be finished
[49:00] for the Gentiles Church when he is
[49:02] brought when his bride is taken from the
[49:04] earth the Spirit of God leaves the earth
[49:06] he's that filthiest filthy steel he's
[49:09] that his righteous righteous steel he
[49:11] that his holy his holy steel in other
[49:14] words the sanctuary becomes smoky where
[49:16] the attorney stands it to plead the case
[49:19] Christ leave the sanctuary his day of
[49:22] mediatory is over you don't want that to
[49:24] happen you don't want that to happen I
[49:29] know people say well it's already happen
[49:32] I beg your pardon
[49:34] you better hope it's not because all of
[49:38] your faults that you are things you have
[49:40] done there's nothing to plead your case
[49:41] with let the blood stay on the altar as
[49:44] long as you can you understand me
[49:49] if the blood is not still on on the
[49:51] mercy seat you know what's happening
[49:53] there are people who are falsely being
[49:56] saved because once the blood is off the
[50:00] mercy seat God turns from the Gentiles
[50:02] and go to the Jew see people don't
[50:05] understand know that the thunders they
[50:07] don't understand Amen what what he was
[50:09] saying and when God raised up he didn't
[50:11] understand there's more than one soul to
[50:13] this thing and every every every church
[50:17] age overlaps the other if he's off the
[50:22] nurses he's been why would he give us a
[50:24] message to prepare us watch the Prophet
[50:30] he pleaded the blood even to the last
[50:32] day he always talked about the blood of
[50:36] Jesus Christ and if it was off the mercy
[50:38] seat it will be one day but the Jews are
[50:42] not properly right yet and guess what
[50:45] neither is the bride God ain't waiting
[50:49] for his word the word is waiting on us
[50:53] he's the one that we God want us to have
[50:56] divine law anybody know what that is
[51:00] hallelujah it's a place we've never been
[51:03] why because we've been birthed into a
[51:05] world of evil hatred and lies and deceit
[51:09] and that's all we've ever known but God
[51:12] said there's another world way beyond
[51:15] this he said no only way you're gonna
[51:17] get there you must have eternal life
[51:20] activity of divine love hmm
[51:25] you got it I got it
[51:28] I just got to move more out of the way
[51:31] somebody help me here see because
[51:33] there's only one love and God is love
[51:37] and when God gives you the only God you
[51:40] know how you felt who you just love
[51:42] everybody and everything you want to
[51:45] kiss the flowers and kiss the rocks
[51:48] y'all didn't feel that way
[51:50] I did Oh Lord oh Lord
[51:55] it's a place you don't even want to come
[51:57] down from somebody help me one moment
[52:01] you're crying and the next time you're
[52:03] laughing in the next time you're just
[52:04] shouting and dancing and then you're
[52:06] crying all over again then how was my
[52:08] experience your experience may be
[52:10] different but when you have it you're
[52:12] gonna know you've been changed mm oh I
[52:19] tell you one time we were there in Lima
[52:20] Ohio and God refilled me and I said Lord
[52:23] God showed me how to get behind the
[52:25] curtain how to get international of
[52:28] glory and then the Holy Spirit spoke to
[52:29] me you cannot come to me in sackcloth
[52:31] and ashes
[52:32] I said that's on the outer court you
[52:36] want to get into the inner court you got
[52:37] to come by way of praise mm he said you
[52:43] just start thinking me for all I've done
[52:45] for you and what I've done for you and
[52:47] what I call you you tell me you believe
[52:49] it oh god I can't I'm just telling you
[52:52] I'm just trying to tell you how it was I
[52:53] can't really tell you all I know that
[52:55] was my instruction and I went at it I
[52:57] went at it
[52:59] [Music]
[53:00] well all I can say God is no no no my
[53:03] heart I I didn't see no man I did but I
[53:06] was caught up into a light that was
[53:08] brighter than anything that I ever and I
[53:09] all I heard was God's worship and then
[53:12] God began to the Lord began to talk to
[53:14] me about what he felt toward me I've
[53:17] heard him saying more than once and why
[53:20] I'm so the way I am gotta have something
[53:23] gotta have something gotta have
[53:24] something all I know is that I came out
[53:27] of that place
[53:28] Oh Lord for a whole month I wept and I
[53:32] cried I laughed I wept at crying I
[53:34] laughed and I thought my god have you
[53:35] keep going this way i'ma goin saying I
[53:38] felt by one one command I can end the
[53:42] world I'll create one I'm just telling
[53:44] you that's how I felt that doesn't mean
[53:46] you have to feel that way but whatever
[53:48] it is you gonna know you have changed I
[53:53] didn't know God was preparing me for
[53:55] something because shortly after that I
[53:57] had about three sisters and one I might
[53:58] die within the space of six months but
[54:03] that kept me you know you know you look
[54:07] at these things and you say you know
[54:09] brother well you ought to be where you
[54:10] ought to be I'm like I don't know why
[54:12] I'm going through what I go I'm going
[54:14] through but one thing I want to be seen
[54:16] I want this face that you see to become
[54:26] the face of God you off your rocker
[54:31] Elijah was the face of God Moses was the
[54:36] face of God
[54:37] hello oh come on somebody if you his
[54:42] tabernacle he's looking through your
[54:44] eyes he's speaking by way of your voice
[54:49] that's why Jesus said when Philip says
[54:51] show us the father and jesus says have I
[54:56] not long have I been with you so long
[54:59] you don't even know me when you see me
[55:04] you see the father
[55:07] yeah hallelujah y'all don't believe
[55:16] they're all I can say is Noah was the
[55:19] face of God and we know I preached it
[55:27] wasn't nowhere to send it down into the
[55:29] region of the loss it was Jesus in the
[55:32] reaches of laws and he says why didn't
[55:33] you hear my preaching but Lord with you
[55:36] and then we're with Noah preached that
[55:37] was me when the seals when God showed
[55:43] his faith y'all know it's true when God
[55:47] showed his face who was who made his
[55:49] face up you and I hallelujah oh come on
[56:00] even in eternity when they come to see
[56:04] the face of God who's because God is a
[56:10] spirit gee that'll be there this is what
[56:15] I loved about it before Eve was ever
[56:20] manifested she was in Adam and Adam was
[56:24] the god of Earth and when you walked up
[56:28] to out of any animal and they looked
[56:30] into the face of Adam it was missing
[56:32] looking into the face of God that was
[56:36] not only in the face of God but that was
[56:38] the face of II see what we must realize
[56:49] by God's grace it meant that God is
[56:51] bringing us to a place we don't know
[56:53] what it is this scene has blocked our
[56:56] vision but the message came to awaken us
[57:01] that we're not just animals
[57:03] God did not even though we we have hands
[57:07] like a like a monk in feed like a bear
[57:10] yet is still on the inside of this clay
[57:13] house is God himself
[57:15] Oh help me Jesus that's why God is
[57:22] taking this and he must pour him sea
[57:24] spirit in you he's got to have because
[57:26] that's what he's looking at not your
[57:28] face he don't want you your face to be
[57:31] seen
[57:32] that's his glory hallelujah and I don't
[57:36] know how it's gonna be but the Bible
[57:38] says that she'll come down from heaven
[57:41] with the glory of God I love that
[57:43] scripture oh that's okay
[57:51] you and I must understand by God's grace
[57:55] everything is so perfect you know what
[58:01] you can't miss heaven if you try that's
[58:05] if you have been elected by God well
[58:09] first of all he says I never lost one
[58:13] jesus never did anyone sin nothing he
[58:16] never said to enable him to lose one
[58:20] joshua lost with you because sin was
[58:24] found in the camp and when he is river
[58:27] fight anybody there was no death in
[58:30] israel as long as israel was with god's
[58:33] word when they would beat those who
[58:36] would die is because somewhere sin came
[58:39] in the camp but as long as they was with
[58:42] jehovah and his rod not war listen they
[58:46] would weapon killing this guy thousands
[58:48] of people and the whole army of Israel
[58:50] will return back home I love this I love
[58:56] this why because you must understand
[58:59] Jesus fought for us he whipped the devil
[59:03] for everything with everything he got
[59:05] and then he come back and make us more
[59:07] than conquerors why are we more than
[59:12] conquerors because he got the victory
[59:14] for us and we are enjoying what they
[59:18] call it when you win you didn't see
[59:19] somebody the spoils
[59:21] [Laughter]
[59:23] somebody help me here it's so perfect
[59:27] I love
[59:29] is how brother Elam said Jesus Christ
[59:32] being the head of Christ being the head
[59:34] of the body and when the hair got up the
[59:36] body BIA - ha ha ha
[59:39] he just didn't raise his head his whole
[59:42] body raised and because he raised me
[59:46] arisen
[59:50] brother BAM said watch a perfect God
[59:53] with the perfect heart keep a perfect
[59:55] promise by His perfect word which he is
[59:58] shot which is sharper than a two-edged
[1:00:00] sword and the discern of the thoughts of
[1:00:02] the heart what we're coming down to the
[1:00:04] perfection because the people has to
[1:00:06] come to this in order to for the rapture
[1:00:10] huh that's what he said in perfect faith
[1:00:14] we've got to come to this in order to be
[1:00:16] raptured
[1:00:19] then what's holding it right away now
[1:00:22] right now is waiting for that church to
[1:00:25] come into that perfect rapture - faith
[1:00:28] looking for it it means a lot of shaving
[1:00:33] down for me it means a lot for you but
[1:00:37] together we'll make it by the grace of
[1:00:39] God hallelujah you know that shaving
[1:00:43] down that means you got too much world
[1:00:45] on you hey he gonna shave you up
[1:00:50] I don't care Lord take it all take every
[1:00:55] part of me take it off whoa just shake
[1:00:59] me up that I have rapturing faith
[1:01:02] somebody I feel like a kid in a candy
[1:01:07] shop right now yeah whatever
[1:01:14] you must understand he's looking he's
[1:01:16] looking for people that's gonna have
[1:01:17] those dynamics he's left there people
[1:01:20] say well that's Pentecostal you better
[1:01:22] be Pentecostal and I'm not talking about
[1:01:25] Pentecostal denomination I'm talking
[1:01:27] about experiencing believing that he's
[1:01:29] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:01:31] believing that signs and wonders and
[1:01:33] miracles are still yet today and there
[1:01:36] are people who believe it and not only
[1:01:38] did that but there are people who allow
[1:01:40] still being performing it
[1:01:42] in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:01:45] don't let this moment pass you by we've
[1:01:48] seen God and we know how the devil he
[1:01:50] acts up him and he cuts up remember that
[1:01:52] old man Amen that our boy that was being
[1:01:55] thrown in the fire and Jesus say come
[1:01:58] out of him that devil had to come out
[1:02:00] but what did he do before we game out he
[1:02:03] cut up he make me think it's gonna get
[1:02:06] worse you know in our carnal minds we'll
[1:02:08] look at that things oh my god is getting
[1:02:10] worse you've messed up hallelujah you
[1:02:14] keep your mouth shut you keep your
[1:02:16] thoughts to yourself and you said Lord
[1:02:18] you know I'm trusting in you hallelujah
[1:02:22] and that devil got to go he might toss
[1:02:25] that child or whatever he might take it
[1:02:27] this way in that way and they look like
[1:02:29] it's getting worse but the prophet of
[1:02:30] God said when it looks like that that's
[1:02:32] when it's getting better
[1:02:34] somebody help me mmm yeah can you don't
[1:02:44] taste that that's sweet
[1:02:47] I'm not making this up I'm really
[1:02:49] happening an experience of here Alleluia
[1:02:57] and the Bible said witness you're
[1:02:59] turning to the Lord and see that's what
[1:03:01] people don't understand as long as you
[1:03:03] saw Moses Moses was there veiled Moses
[1:03:05] became a blindness a blind spot for them
[1:03:08] right is that right because all they
[1:03:11] could see was Moses but they couldn't
[1:03:12] see that the power that was in Moses was
[1:03:14] to be transferred to them but our
[1:03:16] property came here and said to us all
[1:03:18] that was in Christ all there was in God
[1:03:20] he pulled into Christ all that was in
[1:03:22] Christ pulling in the church so so that
[1:03:25] we can understand that all that was in
[1:03:27] God it's now in the bride that's where
[1:03:30] he belongs in us hallelujah and see so
[1:03:34] now when we see that we realize amen the
[1:03:37] same dynamics that the early church had
[1:03:40] you and I must have them today you say
[1:03:44] but it ain't happening well I tell you
[1:03:46] what it like like this is up to you to
[1:03:48] make it happen you say what do you mean
[1:03:52] if you don't see it nowhere in your life
[1:03:56] then you supposed to take that promise
[1:03:57] and apply to yourself whoo
[1:04:03] if it ain't happening Lord let me is
[1:04:06] that right
[1:04:06] Gideon said Lord if you'd be with us
[1:04:11] we'll be all the miracles now if God the
[1:04:16] God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I haven't
[1:04:19] heard about you I've seen and heard
[1:04:21] about you with william branham 'god if
[1:04:24] you'd be with us well be all the
[1:04:26] miracles the first person god made a
[1:04:30] believer was Gideon Yahoo wouldn't say
[1:04:37] because K no miracles happen in the end
[1:04:40] do you believe they will first of all
[1:04:44] you got to see something happen in you
[1:04:45] and when you see God working on your
[1:04:48] behalf then you can see and bring the
[1:04:50] devil down where he should be
[1:04:52] is that right right Judah so you're not
[1:04:59] realized by God's grace Amen that God is
[1:05:02] more than evil
[1:05:04] why he's staking his claim he's kind of
[1:05:09] like putting us in a job at him have you
[1:05:14] considered my wife Miss Jesus Christ in
[1:05:18] this Laodicean age but lie you got a
[1:05:23] hint about see God knew that no matter
[1:05:31] what Satan would put on you you would
[1:05:33] never look turn your back on him at the
[1:05:37] end of the day guess what job stood in
[1:05:40] spite of all the affliction that he has
[1:05:43] gone through hallelujah
[1:05:44] not only was he saved is that Alright
[1:05:47] understand every trial you go through
[1:05:50] gonna bring a greater revelation of God

[1:05:56] God in a greater way hallelujah and job

[1:08:45] jealous you know
[1:08:46] is he gonna flirt with anybody flirt
[1:08:48] with Jesus hey man just all going to
[1:08:55] mean love all over there oh honey you
[1:08:57] know I love you Lord Jesus you're my
[1:08:59] apple of my eye I better look to the
[1:09:04] left side you know make him jealous
[1:09:11] okay Oh Lord think about the people of
[1:09:15] God but if that's Spirit this is what I
[1:09:17] love this is yeah people have been
[1:09:19] talking about Oh the mysteries of the
[1:09:21] thunders and you heard me say that you
[1:09:23] know why didn't make God's Word so
[1:09:25] complicated
[1:09:26] God can't change God is revealing
[1:09:29] simplicity and every every every message
[1:09:32] every word that brother Branham brought
[1:09:35] you go find it somewhere you can find in
[1:09:37] the Bible somewhere it might be an
[1:09:40] elevated revelation but is there in seed
[1:09:43] form hmm but if that spirit of him that
[1:09:48] raised up Jesus from the dead what
[1:09:51] spirit the same spirit that Adam lost if
[1:09:57] they didn't lose it they wouldn't been
[1:09:58] able to die but there's a theophany body
[1:10:04] and a glorified body that Theogony body
[1:10:08] is the word body probably God said that
[1:10:11] knows all things I wondered what that
[1:10:13] was about when jesus said to his
[1:10:16] disciples now knoweth all things I know
[1:10:20] that raised a question because I'm sure
[1:10:21] some of them thought about the things
[1:10:22] they didn't know at that time but Jesus
[1:10:25] told him you know all things and when he
[1:10:28] said that he was working with his
[1:10:30] theophany there theophany right
[1:10:33] because the problem God said even when
[1:10:35] we get to heaven did y'all know this he
[1:10:37] said we won't have I was telling the
[1:10:39] church yesterday because I'm learning to
[1:10:41] speak a little French you know hey and I
[1:10:47] spoke some French to them and they were
[1:10:48] like oh they got excited but my point is
[1:10:51] I was learning how to speak Spanish -
[1:10:53] I'm not to speak a little bit of both
[1:10:54] now but my point is we won't have to go
[1:10:58] up to our brother says well brother
[1:11:03] what's your name
[1:11:04] no he said when we get there we will
[1:11:08] know everybody immediately God will give
[1:11:12] us a little emissions that comes with
[1:11:16] the promise do you mean if mold is I've
[1:11:20] been reading about your boss my turn oh
[1:11:28] god we can't imagine lord knows I'm not
[1:11:31] trying to play but I get excited when I
[1:11:33] think about how glorious is gonna be
[1:11:35] because some of us gonna be so changed
[1:11:38] we're gonna happen to each other y'all
[1:11:47] better know it
[1:11:48] hey God is gonna you know what I was
[1:11:51] telling the church I said don't you know
[1:11:52] brother Baron says that everything
[1:11:53] that's in pudding and he's gonna take
[1:11:55] God gonna take it out whatever curse the
[1:11:57] curse brought upon you as a natural man
[1:11:59] God is gonna take away all that would be
[1:12:02] taken away hallelujah you know I would
[1:12:06] say listen like I said just wanted we
[1:12:08] won't need any teeth toothbrush we would
[1:12:11] have to floss we won't have to do any of
[1:12:15] that
[1:12:17] everything that scientific won't be
[1:12:19] there will be no automobiles so that
[1:12:24] means no traffic tickets brothers no
[1:12:30] police sirens coming after you because
[1:12:32] you're speeding well is that it in
[1:12:35] heaven we'll be travelling like a dot
[1:12:41] brother BAM said there's world
[1:12:44] upon worlds upon worlds wherever we want
[1:12:47] to go vacation if there is such a thing
[1:12:51] [Laughter]
[1:12:52] hallelujah
[1:12:54] we just think about it in there oh god I
[1:12:59] can't imagine it because what we see in
[1:13:02] this dimension we are locked in but that
[1:13:04] dimension is a dimension it's just is
[1:13:10] that right
[1:13:10] Jesus was in it they was up in that
[1:13:13] upper room Amen Jesus just walked
[1:13:15] through the wall
[1:13:18] none of this stuff would hold us back
[1:13:21] we'll see heaven like idiots because oh
[1:13:23] oh it's a big in miles away that planet
[1:13:26] is brother Anthony not so they're gone
[1:13:29] in a circle and he said this heaven we
[1:13:32] talk about is just right above us that's
[1:13:36] what he said it's just in another
[1:13:38] dimension now if you go down I don't
[1:13:43] know where that is but if you're going
[1:13:46] up without notice that way not far from
[1:13:49] you is that right
[1:13:50] you say what do you mean I wonder when
[1:13:52] the scripture says don't you know said
[1:13:54] that um we are are encompassed about
[1:13:57] with so great a cloud of witnesses like
[1:14:00] where are they right here God is right
[1:14:06] here he's in another dimension he sees
[1:14:09] everything we're doing right now in his
[1:14:12] name he knows what we're thinking right
[1:14:15] now he's here give me a few more minutes
[1:14:24] it's okay hmm just working with Genesis
[1:14:30] and I love this because once you bear it
[1:14:35] in Christ that's where you buried
[1:14:40] hallelujah and I'm gonna give you
[1:14:42] understate oh I'm saying
[1:14:43] Genesis 47 and the time through 9 that
[1:14:47] Israel must die and he called his son
[1:14:49] Joseph and said unto Him if now I have
[1:14:52] found grace in that sight I pray thee my
[1:14:55] hand
[1:14:57] under my thigh and deal kindly and truly
[1:15:01] with me bury me not I pray in Egypt
[1:15:06] hallelujah but I will live with my
[1:15:10] father's and thou shall carry me out of
[1:15:12] Egypt and bury me in their burial place
[1:15:15] and he said I will do as thou hath said
[1:15:19] and he said swear unto me and he sware
[1:15:23] unto Him and Israel bowed himself upon
[1:15:26] the Bears head is that all right he said
[1:15:30] whatever you do don't let me don't let
[1:15:32] me stay in Egypt because when the
[1:15:34] resurrection come it ain't coming by way
[1:15:37] of a joke hallelujah everything gonna be
[1:15:42] around Jerusalem way Bethlehem way over
[1:15:46] there in the Holy Land
[1:15:48] can y'all imagine that all over the
[1:15:51] world when the resurrection happened it
[1:15:53] happened in Israel but that's just a few
[1:16:03] people absolutely that's the way it's
[1:16:05] going to be in our day how many people
[1:16:08] in this entire world when Jesus was on
[1:16:10] earth knew he was here it was such a
[1:16:15] secret y'all hear what I'm saying that
[1:16:20] even a lot of the Jews didn't know he
[1:16:23] was born they didn't even know he had
[1:16:26] lived 33 years didn't know who he was
[1:16:31] and yet he walked the earth for 37 years
[1:16:36] think about it that's how this raptures
[1:16:40] taking place now people looking at us
[1:16:43] are y'all so crazy believing in the
[1:16:44] Prophet hey y'all crazy girl you don't
[1:16:47] believe
[1:16:54] I don't mean we got no but the truth I
[1:17:03] [Laughter]
[1:17:05] won't say this but you know what we look
[1:17:08] at this thing in y'all I'm telling you
[1:17:09] don't expect this thing to be worldwide
[1:17:12] and everybody see it
[1:17:13] no sure that's not the way God did it I
[1:17:17] don't even know who all in hi how Noah
[1:17:21] preached to all those people only how
[1:17:23] only one thing I know is that there's no
[1:17:25] time of Noah the lamb was one master
[1:17:27] plan did you know that there was no such
[1:17:33] thing as the continent over here in the
[1:17:34] continent there was one massive land and
[1:17:37] that land was laid out that way so Noah
[1:17:40] could preach he didn't have to catch no
[1:17:44] boat but knowing God he may have have
[1:17:49] traveled around that world seven times
[1:17:53] that's how God works seven is completion
[1:17:58] but in the end of the day these I just
[1:18:03] saw the YouTube there I look at things
[1:18:06] sometimes and now they're discovering
[1:18:08] your civilization palaces and everything
[1:18:10] else in the Antarctic it's a real it's a
[1:18:13] real true story even America is involved
[1:18:15] in it today they're finding things out
[1:18:17] the day perhaps didn't know exists I can
[1:18:19] imagine what they sing because now
[1:18:22] whatever be still finding their finding
[1:18:24] also men you understand me and you know
[1:18:26] scientists they get it a DNA and what's
[1:18:29] this man but they're getting things they
[1:18:31] didn't know existed and now they're
[1:18:33] scaring them now they're saying millions
[1:18:37] of years ago I'll go I could tell them
[1:18:39] folks I can take it right to the Word of
[1:18:40] God I said I do know when that happened
[1:18:45] when they don't disobeyed Noah and
[1:18:50] that's just some a few thousands of
[1:18:52] years ago don't tell me me is a years
[1:18:54] ago no millions of years about 6,000
[1:18:58] years ago this happened and why God is
[1:19:02] relying to melt to show you that you hid
[1:19:05] it for another catastrophe
[1:19:08] another apocalypse but this time it's
[1:19:11] going to be fire but they're rather
[1:19:13] scientific fired and says near Zoar
[1:19:16] years ago
[1:19:16] a friend of mine we got in a little
[1:19:19] little but I stopped when I saw he was
[1:19:21] getting a little heated he's trying to
[1:19:22] tell me that those dinosaurs was eating
[1:19:24] flesh I said what do you mean well you
[1:19:28] can tell by the teeth
[1:19:29] I said maybe God gave them that teeth to
[1:19:32] break in trees ooh
[1:19:36] I merely pointed that neat little thing
[1:19:38] a little too thin I said what is that
[1:19:40] and so you eat meat and you trying to
[1:19:44] tell me that God gave you that that
[1:19:46] little tooth right there on the side
[1:19:47] that look a little wanted to break me
[1:19:49] I say you brah I say I agreed there were
[1:19:57] dinosaurs probably God said they were
[1:20:00] scientists have said they were but
[1:20:02] brother man said they didn't look like
[1:20:03] they say they look there were some that
[1:20:05] I just looked at this way I identified
[1:20:09] himself but then there's some they just
[1:20:10] found bones too and they just fixed it
[1:20:13] the way they want to fixed it I said
[1:20:16] don't you understand I mean he thought
[1:20:17] Obama don't say they're working I said
[1:20:21] no he doesn't I said but I take it true
[1:20:24] if there was dinosaurs and there was
[1:20:26] eating meat we would have been running
[1:20:27] and somebody would have told a story too
[1:20:32] it's the truth I was trying to get him
[1:20:36] to see reality how you have messed up in
[1:20:39] your mind God put in the Bible
[1:20:40] everything we need to know and then he
[1:20:43] said well it doesn't say they they ate
[1:20:45] vegetables I said but it doesn't say
[1:20:47] they eat may eat meat and I said but the
[1:20:49] Bible tells us when men began to eat
[1:20:50] meat so men was the head of the whole
[1:20:52] situation so when they started eating
[1:20:54] meat animals started eating meat too
[1:20:57] it came by the fall it was after the
[1:21:02] flood when Nimrod began to hunt and
[1:21:05] Nimrod was a devil I said
[1:21:13] Nevada they can prove the dinosaurs and
[1:21:16] man walked the earth at the same time
[1:21:18] because they have found dinosaur
[1:21:20] footprints and man footprints in the
[1:21:22] same place I want you to know that they
[1:21:28] love doing the movies they love and all
[1:21:32] this drama to it so you could pose Oh
[1:21:36] going to God it that's alright um I
[1:21:39] thought but you know I had to say there
[1:21:42] because you know I this there was always
[1:21:45] been something in me that loved that
[1:21:46] science fiction and that's being science
[1:21:48] lives you know and they know how they
[1:21:52] can dramatize all this stuff but let me
[1:21:54] tell you all something man is wrong
[1:21:57] almost a hundred percent and what do you
[1:22:00] think happened and if you are a Volusia
[1:22:06] NIST
[1:22:07] you're not even a Christian if you
[1:22:10] believe science the way they teach it
[1:22:15] over the Word of God
[1:22:17] you're not even Christian
[1:22:20] well they got evidence I got some
[1:22:22] evidence too
[1:22:24] and this is greater than that anyway let
[1:22:27] me go uh forgive me my point is let me
[1:22:31] move on don't you know we have a body
[1:22:35] I'm staking my claim because over there
[1:22:38] I'm not gonna wear this suit there's a
[1:22:44] natural body is this electro body and
[1:22:47] there's a glorified body and I'm gonna
[1:22:50] be wearing my glorify and my celestial
[1:22:54] did you know that this theophany will
[1:22:58] step into my glorify what other part of
[1:23:04] me would be all God somebody help me
[1:23:08] here that's my claim that's my
[1:23:11] inheritance that's what the blood of
[1:23:13] Jesus Christ did for me hallelujah
[1:23:16] people say well I'm saved by the blood
[1:23:19] I'm saved by the grace of God the blood
[1:23:22] keeps me sane
[1:23:26] whoo yeah understand me the blood was
[1:23:30] the purchasing power brother branham
[1:23:31] said that he said you know you're not
[1:23:33] saved by the blood you saved by grace he
[1:23:36] said it's the blood of Jesus Christ that
[1:23:38] keeps you sane
[1:23:40] in what way I'm hidden can I read this
[1:23:49] quoting and I'll let you go I never did
[1:23:52] get where I want to go but now that I
[1:23:53] have Lord bless you we have three
[1:23:56] different bodies we dwell in I think I
[1:23:59] read this earlier one in this the human
[1:24:01] the other way is celestial and the other
[1:24:05] one is the glorified and then we know
[1:24:09] one another in human body the body body
[1:24:13] how much more will we know it each other
[1:24:17] in the glorified body it's like it's if
[1:24:22] the law could produce a good thing how
[1:24:25] much greater then great day then that
[1:24:27] how much greater thing can grace produce
[1:24:30] because it's greater than the law and
[1:24:34] and now it's just like as I say we keep
[1:24:38] growing in knowledge so what are you
[1:24:40] saying we keep growing I love the way
[1:24:45] that that how we shape that mountain you
[1:24:49] know because it reminds me of a volcano
[1:24:54] when you you're not did y'all know we'll
[1:24:57] never have to take place you go to have
[1:24:58] a pain if you still live in there'll be
[1:25:01] a short quick pain you will explode like
[1:25:05] a volcano there will be an explosion
[1:25:10] take place in you that would transform
[1:25:12] you because you got to work with the
[1:25:15] energy that you can't now packing on the
[1:25:17] inside there's got a match what's coming
[1:25:20] that you got to be clothed in
[1:25:27] short quick word do y'all mind the pain
[1:25:31] I don't care anything in this world when
[1:25:39] it's birth
[1:25:40] brings pain and when you birth out of
[1:25:44] this world you go birth pain will take
[1:25:46] place can you imagine a instant change
[1:25:49] in your body and you feel nothing
[1:25:51] no you're gonna feel it I can't imagine
[1:25:55] how it was when Jesus was laying on that
[1:25:58] that that piece of slab bayonet in that
[1:26:00] tomb and all of a sudden an explosion
[1:26:03] took place
[1:26:04] did y'all know that it rocked the whole
[1:26:09] place around there
[1:26:11] so much soul to keep Israel amen that
[1:26:20] problem you know let me stop it's okay
[1:26:26] God made me fimo and the whole human
[1:26:33] race gets wiser but live in a better
[1:26:36] house now than your grandfather did and
[1:26:40] probably your children will live in a
[1:26:42] better house then you have now and you
[1:26:47] know and I know that's the way it goes
[1:26:51] from those old Hut's to from the teepees
[1:26:56] to grand buildings and like you heard me
[1:27:00] say when it's all said and done Adam and
[1:27:05] Eve was their own house in their own
[1:27:08] paradise there was no rain no storms
[1:27:12] they didn't have to have no shelter you
[1:27:15] know it was peace glorious beyond
[1:27:19] anything we could imagine he said what
[1:27:22] brother branham got a mansion and you
[1:27:24] will too and whatever dimension that is
[1:27:28] cuz he said he didn't know but he
[1:27:32] understood he wasn't exactly where he
[1:27:34] was but there is a dimension that God
[1:27:38] would give us physical
[1:27:40] things but the beauty of heaven won't be
[1:27:43] that the beauty of heaven will be you Oh
[1:27:51] Lord
[1:27:53] huh Oh y'all don't believe it
[1:27:56] let me bring you some scripture
[1:27:58] enclosing King Asura who was the king of
[1:28:04] Persia stars off in the story where
[1:28:10] where it was an age of man's glory like
[1:28:15] it is now and King in surah he he had a
[1:28:21] beautiful queen by the name of bast died
[1:28:27] but before he would introduce her he
[1:28:30] introduced and showed them all his gold
[1:28:33] and his purple curtains and his silver
[1:28:35] all these things he showed them the
[1:28:38] majestic or the majesty of his kingdom
[1:28:41] but the greatest thing the beauty of all
[1:28:45] of that was his wife if you think this
[1:28:50] is fantastic or hard to believe that it
[1:28:55] exists I want you to show you our real
[1:28:58] beauty and he calls for his wife and
[1:29:02] fast I was so into herself she had a
[1:29:08] whole revival like the churches are
[1:29:11] doing today the churches are doing that
[1:29:14] women are like churches right and they
[1:29:18] now having they all revival Jesus ain't
[1:29:20] even there the King a even there they
[1:29:22] just glorifying themselves look how big
[1:29:25] my church is and I've got a fantastic
[1:29:27] choir and old my goodness look at a
[1:29:29] stained-glass windows okay yeah you got
[1:29:32] makeup on your church the whole time
[1:29:39] Jesus knocking at the door trying to get
[1:29:41] their attention he said that all rise
[1:29:46] Chamberlain says oh you got to put them
[1:29:49] up put her away
[1:29:50] ooh and I'm closing it right now but God
[1:29:57] went out of the kingdom and found this
[1:29:59] old this uh this uh young Jewish woman
[1:30:07] Odessa
[1:30:09] nobody do you know her dessa
[1:30:14] she wasn't somebody well-known ah but
[1:30:22] God knew her she didn't care about the
[1:30:27] fancy things all of those she she didn't
[1:30:29] even know she was going to be the key
[1:30:30] why but after all that God chose her why
[1:30:36] he wanted somebody to that's what King
[1:30:40] Warren
[1:30:40] the King wanted somebody to love him for
[1:30:42] who he was not glorified we're not here
[1:30:46] to receive glory he's not our glory
[1:30:50] yes he's dressed us in the way he had
[1:30:52] but we're not here to lift ourselves up
[1:30:54] we're here to lift him up by showing the
[1:30:59] world he chose me he told you how a
[1:31:04] glory goes back to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:10] now congeniality question was Odessa if
[1:31:27] the king
[1:31:28] you have his kingdom what would it mean
[1:31:34] to you I can see myself saying Lord if
[1:31:45] you would give me the half of all you
[1:31:46] own it would mean nothing to me if
[1:31:52] you're not there with me
[1:31:55] that's why I think some kind of question
[1:31:58] was asked like that and then when when
[1:32:00] the king of her he heard that is always
[1:32:03] who dad she's the one she's the one ha
[1:32:09] because she treasured me more then she
[1:32:12] treasured the things of the world less
[1:32:15] than oh Lord I love the Lord sometimes I
[1:32:24] feel like a kid and I don't mean to I
[1:32:26] just feel like a child
[1:32:28] a sheep brother not a kid I do I just
[1:32:36] get beside myself and it just comes to
[1:32:41] me and I say it like it comes but this
[1:32:44] this world is beautiful if you see it as
[1:32:49] being beautiful and when I say that it's
[1:32:53] beautiful because you in Christ has made
[1:32:55] it beautiful so what do you mean brother
[1:32:59] books remember the story of that little
[1:33:02] poor couple that got married there was a
[1:33:09] rich couple in the hill father was a
[1:33:11] millionaire and they had all that stuff
[1:33:13] this cool couple was down there at the
[1:33:16] train track living in one of those old
[1:33:18] abandoned trains
[1:33:19] brother and snook down there one day
[1:33:21] just to see how they was doing if column
[1:33:23] this would overhear fussing and carrying
[1:33:24] on it about jealousy but this one he
[1:33:27] comes up he feeds that cardboard box
[1:33:30] door and he sees that young lady perhaps
[1:33:33] not dressed so nice sitting on his lap
[1:33:35] and he at the table there counting out
[1:33:38] the change he says
[1:33:41] but I bought this dress for you she said
[1:33:43] oh I don't need this dress I got a dress
[1:33:45] honey in other words her interest was
[1:33:48] his interest what he should be she wants
[1:33:52] she was more concerned about him getting
[1:33:54] all the bills paid then for her to get a
[1:33:56] new dress oh you know I bought you know
[1:34:00] but I don't need it honey I'm late lord

[1:34:10] ain't got a thing Holly could make in
[1:34:12] meat but they loved each other
[1:34:19] and that's what and that's what really
[1:34:22] stands the test of time when you really

[1:39:40] on the inside and they found that all of
[1:39:44] them were cancerous they've given him
[1:39:46] six months to live I say the doctors has
[1:39:51] given him six months to live
