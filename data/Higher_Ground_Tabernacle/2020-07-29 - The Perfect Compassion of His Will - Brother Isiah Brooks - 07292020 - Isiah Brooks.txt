wonderful [Music] what a beautiful song the Guardia that was beautiful actually goes with the message and sister Grace your song as well it just seems like God knew exactly what we needed as we stand let us turn to Psalms 145 return to 145 Psalms 112 and 4 and then we'll take you to Hebrews 4. we know by God's grace as we spoke the last time we are living under a greater anointing and a greater inspiration you know our anointing that we're dealing with you know you may shout you may sing you know all of those things are good but the anointing that we are now being inspired with is that anointing to come into a completion with God to to embrace uh the Capstone and and we understand by God's grace that uh we're living in that day now it has taken us a long time uh to come to this recognition to see exactly what Malachi 4 was all about uh choosing of a bride we've heard the messages sir what time is it um and I believe with all my heart that many of the scriptures that uh were to be fulfilled has already been fulfilled uh the last episode of this uh entire book is you I mean the focus is on you and you know I liken that uh as God put Adam to sleep no one knew how that sister Adam or Miss Adam or you know Eve was inside but that was the drama of of Genesis because it not only uh shook the animals but it probably shook Heaven too because now it was revealed to to to to to to to to to to the angels in heaven that God consisted of male and female because remember he said I'll make them in my image and my likeness and that was the reason why Adam when he began to uh uh uh speak to Eve he began to tell her where she came from who she was born of his bone and flesh of his flesh and and our messenger has come to do the same thing speaking on the behalf of Elohim and I am so happy to know that nothing can change his plan about you about us nothing nothing that ought to have a people shouting nothing can change his plan about us no matter how much we fail no matter how much we come short of uh he has how could I say it he has wrapped his Perfection around us it's his Perfection and not ours let's go to Psalms 145 and 8. I do believe that when we see what God has done it Grant it'll give us such perfect peace you know I just want to remind Gario he told me he wanted me to sing a song I'm here so I don't want him to forget I'm just messing with him right now but you know God is good to us and I I love when God inspired songwriters just like I enjoy when God inspires the word to preach us because once it's inspired it it makes the book come alive in a real song of God always make something come alive now if you don't ever forget anything else about that song you understand if you don't know anything else about the message tonight understand that God can't change his plan about you that ought to be an encouragement a word as it is Psalms 145 8-9 the Lord is gracious and full of compassion slow to anger and of great Mercy can anybody say Amen to that a in the Amplified it says abounding in Mercy and loving kindness to occur or exist in a great quantity of numbers this is what that's what abounding means it's not that God is barely giving anything out his his Mercy uh David explained it it says is it it endure to all generation I mean God just doesn't run out of it not for his elected Hallelujah the Lord is good to all and his Tender Mercies Are Over All his works now I don't know about you but I'm I'm a part of his words amen Psalms 1 12 and 4. unto the upright their eyes is light in the Darkness so we may fail but when God look at us he sees us upright is that all right he is gracious and full of compassion and righteous Hallelujah understand only the elect of God are born upright and the serpent is born on his belly just to give your thought because remember God has to go back to the original and when Adam was created he was standing upright so you love the Lord let us pray father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we thank you Father for all that you are doing for us and all that you will do we understand father that we're in the midst of something that has already been finished and something that has already been completed even the land was slain before the foundation of the world and Lord we are in that time where you are to glorify yourself in US and we pray father God that you will be merciful and kind of compassionate to us that we will do all that's within us to do your perfect will in your perfect will Lord we stand tonight in Jesus Christ's name Have Thine Own Way amen you may be seated you know when we talk about compassion and that's my thought tonight the perfect compassion of his will because oftentimes when we talk about compassion we think about the way men thinks about it a feeling of deep sympathy and sorrow for another one who is stricken or by Misfortune or accompanied by a strong desire of alleviating the the suffering you know we it's like we even in the hospital we look for a doctor who has compassion who may be able to enter into your suffering and and do it you know so much so that he he'll try to do his best to make you well and you and I must understand that compassion even with men doesn't come easy and many people in our day have lost compassion because the Bible said that the love of many shall wax cold but God's compassion is quite different from ours God have mercy on whom he will and what we look at when God began to have compassion we might think that it's not just our not even fair and to come show you what I'm speaking of when it came to compassion God in the form of Jesus Christ went to the pool of Bethesda and there was a lot of people who were sick and Afflicted and he didn't even go to the worst he went to a man who could actually pick up his bed and walk matter of fact the Jesus asked him you know his problem he said well every time I tried to get into the pool so you could see he was able to walk do something he said every time I tried to get into the pool he said another one would beat me there now think about it there were people from everywhere wanting to get into the pool of Bethesda into that pool because they knew that at a certain season that the angel of the Lord would come down and Trouble the waters Hallelujah see I believe it like that and I also believe it in the spiritual aspect that when Jesus shows up at church he comes to bring a healing to somebody and is up to the individuals to step into the water when you see the water's troubled it's about you and God Hallelujah don't wait on Susie or Josie or whatever it's your time your turn and your day Hallelujah the thing that I love about it is that Jesus Christ knew exactly what he was doing because he said I can't do nothing except I see the father do it when I see him do it that's what I do remember it's always an inspiration amen sometimes it's by Vision sometimes it's by thought you know sometimes it's because you know that you know that you know but whatever it is God will inspire you right and when God inspires you you ought to do what God is inspiring you to do regardless to those who are around who may judge you as being ignorant or Holy Roller huh y'all hear what I'm saying how many times have we missed God because God would tell us to witness to someone you the only one with the inspiration but instead of moving with the inspiration of God we fall back see until we learn to hear and know what God wants us to do we have not obtained the perfection in which God wants us to obtain Hallelujah because remember I told you that Perfection is not your do's and don't it's not the touch not taste not hand or not Perfection is winning is within your heart when it's in your heart to do the perfect will of God that is perfection now here with the prophet of God says according to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said his soul is compassion he said we'll take it up later on in this week those things that he said but human compassion and compassion of God Is So contrary we feel so horribly bad for different uh people who are afflicted and who are sick and who are having troubles and sometimes we don't understand what we're feeling bad about because remember this was the difference between the ministry of William Branham and the ministry of Oral Roberts and the rest they would just heal and lay hands and command the devil to leave not knowing why the condition was there Hallelujah and we know that when you when a devil is cast out or or demon is removed without the approval of God that individual is the one who gets in trouble Hallelujah brother Randall said I look to see what the problems and where did it start I looked to see what caused it because first of all I want to make sure I don't remove something that God has placed on them Hallelujah that is the kind of compassion that is the kind of perfection that God wants us to have remember in the Ephesus age the prophet of God said that emphasis had all of the virtues starting from faith on up and he said all God had to do was not and they knew exactly what he wanted them to do compassion it's like when Peter heard the voice of God and said go back this is your time to die Hallelujah remember Peter was a coward before he was converted but when he got converted his life was a perfected life is that right he could not have told you anything else this is why God placed him with the virtues how to from Faith to to Virtue to knowledge and own up because he had that experience of Christ growing up into him Hallelujah and when it came to his death Peter died a perfect man he said what do you mean it wasn't the day start taste not touch not it because we all make mistakes but one thing God is looking for a perfect heart the heart that says no matter what I'm gonna do the will of God and understand that's God's compassion that's our compassion toward you and then God uses us to show his compassion for others right so we we see that his compassion is different as the prophet God said it is so contrary to what we think that's why the devil said that's how the devil says oh if you got the gift of healing go over there to the hospital and and cure everybody that ain't God's compassion God compassion will keep you broke I mean not broke with her but our compassion Will Keep Us broke hello the poor will be with you always but do you feel like you got to give your money to everybody that's poor you ain't not broke they that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God I'm talking about something tonight because I want you to understand as long as we try to perfect the flesh we'll never be able to God to excuse me God won't be able to perfect the spirit or the soul you understand me two laws working and one is contrary to the other and we must come to understand the message if we have been Justified as though we've never sinned in the first place we must believe that if we have our names have been placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world we must believe that like the brother song says nothing can change his plan about us not nothing that's why Paul said who shall separate us from the love of God what can anything can any situation separate us from the love of God I don't think so no I know so nothing but we must understand the power of the blood the power of the blood is not an eraser the power of the blood actually takes everything away so much so there is no evidence of the thing ever being there before is that right brother Brandon describe it as a bleach it literally takes the sin away so much so there because with an eraser you can see the imprint but not with God he gets rid of all of the evidence he so sanctifies you and justifies you as though you've never sinned in the first place this is your joy this is your joy this is your power this is your your Battleground to know that I stand perfect not by power not by might but by the spirit of God Hallelujah is not not what you think and I'm gonna get into that in just a moment because you and I must understand amen if we're going to make a rapture we must have the mind of Christ and in order to have the mind of Christ you must understand that's that that mind is given to you and and how is it given it is given to you by the word this is why brother Brandon came he came to give us the mind of Christ for our day y'all understand in other words whatever the word says we are that's who we are that's his mind that's his thought toward us he hasn't given us an in a end of Destruction he said I've given you an expected end but the devil will always come to make you look at your failures and your your airing ways and make you feel bad and take away your joy and take away your peace and all these things and I wonder how God feels when it comes to those things and you thinking knows things about yourself when those things are not the things that he's thinking of you you know what churches would be full of joy it would be running over if we really held the word of God in our heart the way we should you didn't save yourself he saved you you couldn't Choose Yourself and the Bible tells us no man can add one Cuba to his statue if you have matured it ain't you it's the Christ in you is that right because Paul said grow up into him a seed had to be dramatized alive had to be brought forth Hallelujah guess what a lily is not formed on the top of the water a lilies give birth in the mud and it has to press its way through the muck and the mirror come on some of us still pressing through the monkey tomorrow but don't you worry there's a sun on the other side of this thing there's a victory that God has already ordained for you and you've got to believe that you're you're the Lily you're a lily coming up through this nasty laodicea Hallelujah and if this is that all right so we realize that God will always put you in a place of adversities he's a man of war he loves that he loves to put you in a place but he also wants you to know that his Mercy remember I preached on the inspiration we need inspiration and you need to keep a prayer life in order to keep her inspiration hmm oh it's true if if there's a pool in your life you need to find out what the pool is about why is this thing nagging me remember brother random when it came to the seals and all that this thing was nagging him and he wanted to know what it was so he went to McDonald's no he sought the Lord huh he put his whole heart into it because you know what he wanted to do the perfect will of God I love brothers because he was a straight shooter as I said the last time he couldn't settle for a a Target that was off it had to be a bull's-eye in the bullseye I still wonder how in the world he would shoot squirrels in the middle of in between I I still don't understand that one but perhaps it was like David who did Goliath that way Hallelujah so understand that they'll come to Perfection we have been set for the Perfection that God has for us is not a man the law if you approach God by the law he will handle you according to the law just like he did the Rich Young Ruler what must I do to be saved hey somebody president said there is nothing you can do it is not what you do is what he's done for you and when we approach God in the law he has to answer that's how you approached him but when it came to the Rich Young Ruler Zacchaeus Zachy has heard the word Zach it was ashamed of himself conviction was already uh on Zacchaeus and he climbs up into the tree trying to hide God said come down too much pride up there bring yourself down right and guess what when Zach is he could say Lord I ain't coming out of this street no but when he came out of the tree God says listen Zacchaeus I'm having dinner with you tonight see so you and I must understand God resists the proud and he Cleaves to the humble all we have to do is really a sweet way of going it's a sweet way keeping humble is the sweetest way Hallelujah is that right that's what brother Brown said he said Jesus Christ fought and Destroy Satan's work with sweetness and meekness I'll never forget that sweetness and meekness Hallelujah see the devil the serpent he loves to fight he's a murderer he's a killer but he doesn't know what to do with sweetness he doesn't know what to do with humility so when somebody revile you the Bible said revile not that that's the law but you see if you give the get the law Giver on the inside he will do it for you Hallelujah is that what Paul said Paul said I I it ain't me that's living now it's not I that live but it's the Christ that lives in me and people of God this is why so many people amen they don't know what the Holy Ghost is hallelujah it's a change is when God comes into your heart and your life change your desire change is that right it starts off like a baby and the mature is up into a grown man that's why Paul rebuked Corinthians say wait a minute you should be past the stage you acting like babies is that righty that's what he said he said in all he said here it is you're still drinking milk when you ought to be over here teaching me hallelujah what what what now that we say we're full and grown what are we supposed to be teaching um we should be past the thought okay you shouldn't wear this you shouldn't wear that you shouldn't go here and you shouldn't go there that's that's law and that's very that's milky that's milk for the babies Hallelujah because it is the baby it's the young ones that you've got to constantly tell don't do this today but once that Holy Ghost comes in Hallelujah is that all right one scripture I forgot to read but I'm gonna read it now Hebrews 4 let us therefore fear less a promise being left us of entering into the his rest any of you should seem to come short of it now you know God he speaks and when he's speaking he's speaking to two kinds of people he's speaking to the elected and he's also speaking to the none elect those who are make-believers because he knows that the meat Believers is not going to allow themselves to come short while they have the anointing of Jacob huh and no matter what I'm going to get the birthright no matter what I am if I gotta face Esau I am going to get my inheritance I'm going to get this see there's something that drives you it's an inspiration of the hour that keeps you moving forward y'all understand me oh it's not you oh I've got a will your will if you've got a will is because God gave it to you is that right and I'm gonna show you that even the Jesus Christ who was the son of God full of grace and truth his last test his last test was in the garden he conquered the devil in the garden not when he was being crucified not when he was going up Mount uh Calvary and all that no no no he had already conquered the devil but what did he conquer what made him the perfect son is when he said father not my will but thine be done when he surrendered his will that was his heart speaking there his flesh and already said I don't want to go there but his heart overruled why because there was God in the heart not my will but dying will be done that's what we need to look at look beyond the brain look behind the Mind look beyond the reason and let your heart speak Lord not my will but let thine be done like David because when you when you want to see God Victorious and you know even even the scripture says if you've Fallen if you've made mistakes he says you are you are a Revenge Revenge once God wake you up Revenge your adversary right make right do just the opposite show the devil that you have you're in battle right you just don't sit back and say que sera sera no sir you're actually moving the battle and says okay you made me fall this time but you won't do it another time y'all understand me that's the battle that's the why because you know it's God's Victory even if you fall he you know is God victory for you to be a Victor not a coward not somebody to run away from the battle Hallelujah we don't go AWOL here Hallelujah we fight we have been designed to fight right like I said it ain't the size of the dog is the size of the fighting the dog Hallelujah you can find some big cowardly dogs and then you can find some Chihuahuas that'll carry on like they're gonna eat you alive Hallelujah that little man attitude right so you and I must understand that when it comes to God's perfect will his perfect will and you know if you pray God I want to do your perfect will every day God will make sure that is being done he'll make sure yes I he'll keep you awake he'll keep you alive is that all right now let's let's move on the Bible says let us therefore Fearless a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it found to us with the gospel preach as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them nor being mixed with faith in them that heard it okay so we understand that faith is not a thing faith is a person and once faith is in you it cannot doubt his own word Hallelujah no matter what's coming faith says amen hallelujah oh all of the things that are around you so what faith says amen this is why I believe I'm going to be translated I don't care how many times I've falled how many times I I I'm standing on a promise y'all understand me he that begun the good work in US is faithful to complete it I'm resting if that's the only Stone I got in my sling the devil is going to get it he goes on to understand you know because we you know we're living in a time it's hard for the elders and it's definitely hard for the young people in the message perfection says what the worshiper once purged the purgative of the blood of the Lamb once thoroughly sweet out cleans out the worshiper the very conscience of sin is gone he said think it think of it the word conscious in the right interpretation that we should use here this is the King James version in English England he said it means a conscience in here it it it would mean the desire to worshiper once purged by the purgative of Christ at the calvary has no more desire of sin old things have passed away and all things have become new and this is where we battle because Satan will anoint your spirit with a desire to sin but your soul will say no Hallelujah and if Satan get victory in your spirit your soul repents y'all understand me because your soul is where the strong man is is where Christ is but because we're in this flesh we do make mistakes Hallelujah and guess what it still can't change God's mind it still can't change God's plan the devil got two good licks denied you know because I want you to realize amen by God's grace you and I we're in a place that with God wants that Joy the Bible says when when you you believe God the joy of the Lord is your strength when you believe his word the Bible says in that right at his right hand is fullness of joy when you believe his word then what happens it it becomes a force field where Satan can't come through it's a force field why this man just screamed at you and I've had that experience somebody's screaming and hollering at me and the whole time the Holy Ghost is saying don't answer don't say one word right see that that was not from the head that was from the heart and God dealt with that and guess who got Victory I did because God gave me the victory by keeping me by me keeping my mouth shut what that was God's compassion right because listen there's an angel angry Christian you can call fire down from heaven you see what I'm saying that's why the Bible said curse not and bless we're here to bless not to curse y'all hear what I'm saying oh it's the truth we're here to forgive not the whole grudges we're here to to let Christ how can I say it Christ is life Prince reflects through us let's go on see the word conscious in the in the right interpretation that we would use here this is the King James version and we said it runs down into the desire the word worshiper once purged by the purgative of Christ at the Cavalry has no more desire of sin one thing has passed away and all things have become new now we you can sing like a lot and still have hatred malice and strife in your body in your soul you can shout like I don't know what you still have it you can dance in the spirit you can speak with tongues you can prophesy Hallelujah you can preach any of those things and still have malice Envy Strife in your heart but when the real truth for ordained nation of God Eternal Word when your name was written there and the blood ever purges that person the very thought of it condemns him on the track where he is standing at Hallelujah no True Believer is going to constantly think evil and revenge and whatever about any individual God will stop you in your track and you'll say Lord forgive me for thinking such a thing Hallelujah Hallelujah see I said don't condemn me oh that don't condemn me no no no no see I go these places I I don't I don't condemn me why doesn't it it's a negative you're a negative worshiper has never been purged by the blood of Jesus Christ a negative worshiper I'd never heard of such a thing a negative worshiper and we do we have negative worshipers you know I just heard the prophet God said back there on that on that message Perfection he said if you take substances for medication for your nerves you know what he said when you stop taking it it's going to make your nerves worse it gets worse why not take the real sedative let God heal you from the inside y'all believe that remember I told you about how God cast God perfect love cast out Devils Hallelujah is that right is fear a devil perfect love casts out fear well who is perfect love but God himself when you're in that realm he's with you Hallelujah and when he sees you fearing and you don't have control he comes on the scene and he cast that fear out it ain't you it'll never be you is that right he fought for Israel that's why Israel said he's my battle ax Hallelujah he's my sword he's my shield he's the same God he fight for his bride in every instance in every instance you love the Lord I'm trying to show us here we're talking about a Capstone Ministry which is a Ministry of perfection it really is and how you going to get there then if you don't take God at his word you think you go you know because you fast and pray all the time and nothing wrong with these things as I do right I fast and I pray there's nothing wrong but I'm trying to direct you to something and I'll get there in just a moment could you guys you can do all of that and it'd be just religion right I don't think we suffer for those from those things but I want everybody to understand there is a difference between you doing it and God doing it how many of you have ever tried to fast on your own you know I just need to fast and every time you pass McDonald's or something your stomach is growling and you turning like a dog sniffing I can't get an inside I can at least get the smell of it whatever it is you need and well go get it because you're not fasting God ain't even leading you because when God leaves you you don't get hungry now that doesn't justify a lot of people who don't fast because I believe fashion is good for the spiritual man I mean it really is somehow whatever it does it Tunes us more into God it does for me listen but we're not legalists either and legalists you know uh how can I say it uh legalists can be uh how can I say it I'm not a legalist but I I'm a faithful one I want to but if you're faithful sometime it can look like it's legalism but it's not because when you're faithful it's the inside working and not not the mind okay let's move on legalists got a hold of this idea Hallelujah I'll wear my dresses down to this way my dress is down this way and I let my hair grow long and I'll be all right brother bam says that's a lie and they point back to the women with short hair and with short dresses and say she's going to hell brother Branham says I can't say that but I think those things are all right I'm not condemning them but when you rest your Eternal hopes and salvation upon that that Doctrine you are damned with it and how many people in the message who has adopted this system and they condemned everybody that don't look like them brother Adam said that's legalism and you are damned by it somebody help me here y'all hear what I'm saying it ain't law it ain't a system it's life it's life not your life his life in you the man or woman it doesn't matter whether you're this that or the other you come to the fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's vein let the purgative of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ Purge your sins and every one of us know what those things are Hallelujah don't let the Holy Ghost come to you to set you free and you say oh God I don't want to go free I want to stay remember that's a dangerous ground to be on brother uh it it won't matter you know I go walking every morning now and I have such a good time good time me in the Lord sometimes I can even cry and really have a good time crying because I'm sweating so hard nobody will never know Hallelujah but I have a great time with the Lord Jesus in the mornings Hallelujah I mean he's a plan of tape sometimes I'm praying why I'm playing it y'all hear me it's a it's a communion it's a fellowship I need that and I love it I love it when those kind of things become addictive I gotta have it if you're going to ever see me frustrated it's at times when I can't get to my word or is that time when I can't Pray when I want to pray I get a little frustrated I get a little annoyed because I'm an addict I love his presence I love his word I love I you want to call me a Jesus Freak that's what I am but the truth of the matter is I so enjoy it it it makes me feel y'all you know what the clean feeling that God gives you nothing can give you like that Holy Ghost I don't care you can wash all day Hallelujah with these scientific products but nothing can make you feel clean like God can Hallelujah brother it won't matter you can still have dresses so long you could still not wear a short sleeve shirt young men and those things or whatever you want to but if you still got malice and envy and strife you might have run danced spoken tongue shouted preached the gospel or anything but you're lost until the blood has cleansed you and set in the Divine love of the Lord Jesus Christ in where your heart and leaving the life Prince of Christ behind that's what I wanted entitle is the life Prince Prince y'all don't talk about p-r-i-n-t-s where Christ has come in you remember the story amen about uh the the young man who who who Footprints in the Sand and then there was a time there was only one set of footprints and the young man asked Jesus what what happened here where why did you you know deserve me he says no I didn't desert you I was carrying you and see so time sometimes there's only one set of footprints and those Footprints is when God is carrying you you understand me you're going to make it because you have already made it you say well what do you mean brother let me say it like this amen it may be even a little figurative all I know is that those 24 Elders had 24 sheets waiting for them places of Dominion is that right brother random because you have chosen the heart away because you have chosen the narrow way you've chosen a straight way they're they're awaits for you a huge y'all When God Says huge When God Says huge wait a minute see y'all don't get it when God says huge portion away for you don't you understand I'm part of that huge and you're part of that huge whatever that you did we're part of it Hallelujah because when you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet you guess the prophet reward you love the Lord so what do you what are you saying all I know is there is a man of God who came prior to my time he said I was beyond the curtain and I saw you there now I don't know whether you can put your name in you but my name is in there it ain't about my goodness it never was my goodness the prophet God said we were born failures we were born we come as a failure into the world from the beginning Hallelujah if we could understand the blood of Jesus Christ and know that the power of the blood has never lost never lost his power he can't lose it and that devil he just ain't smart enough to understand that no matter no matter what he thinks it'll never go his way Darkness can never defeat light ever defeat light you understand me and we're resting today as legalist upon some legal thing that we've done why when I was a sinner I was a leopard the more I tried to quit this and quit that I only made my spots brighter I was a hypocrite with it and so was you y'all know what I'm talking about oh I ain't gonna do this no more I ain't gonna do those no more somebody put on a straight jacket as soon as that straight jacket come off you you're gonna do it James says it's gonna happen until God released that desire from you is that right it's the desire in you that you need to get rid of is that that desires us Lord take away the desire if God take away the desire you'll never want it ever again I feel like shouting it's the truth this is his compassion toward us tonight [Music] but hand or not and all you got to do is get on your knees shortcut right on down humble yourself right on down and ask the Lord to take it from you and don't go with a hope either oh Lord I just hope you stay on your knees till that thing become a reality or you stand up however you want to pray you don't have to be on your knees wherever you want to be as long as you can contact God that's the important thing Hallelujah my mom used to go in the in in the bathroom and back in that day you only had one with all those children if you didn't get in there before Mom got in there you was in trouble you had to use elsewhere y'all know what I'm saying I'm saying it was terrible especially during the winter time because my mama used to pray in there for hours brother I'm telling you there were times I would leave school to go to school and I come back my mom still praying same place crying out to God weeping before the Lord it's amazing it's amazing how inspiration and you know what she was doing praying for me I'm the only one out of my family that believed this message praying for me and before she died she told me of what was going to happen to me foreign truth told me I was going to be a preacher bad news that right didn't want to be and if I could get out of it now I would don't talk like that brother Brooks but you got to understand a true preacher don't you it's some it's just mixed feelings he hates it and love it at the same time right he's like Jonah he knows God is going to tell him to say things he don't want to say he knows it he knows that the Lord gonna get him in trouble he knows it y'all preachers y'all know that don't you God will get you in trouble yes he will but don't you understand he still be there that's when your will become his will that's how you are perfected when you do what he wants you to do and not what you want to do and his ways of past finding out Hallelujah Oh Glory to God is that right he'll have you in the corner somewhere you know right in the public praise the Lord God bless you yeah don't ever think he'll never do that because the crowd might be so big to the person he wants to get next to need a loud voice to hear you Hallelujah y'all know that's true right y'all don't know whether y'all ever heard the story about Jack Cole but Jack Cole and his mama was in the in the grocery store and here she was buying a big can of tomato y'all remember the old tomato cans now some of y'all too young to know that but the Tomato can had a big old just in case you didn't know how to read they had a big red tomato on it right and she was standing there at the register she said Jack she said I'll tell you what looking at that red tomato makes me think about the blood of Jesus Jack said when she said that he went one way and she went the next and they were shouting and praising God in the grocery store and everybody looking at them crazy and he said all of a sudden he ended up on the meat cattle and and the meat man with all of the blood on the on the apron says I guess you've been down there with them Holy Rollers haven't you he said yes sir I have and he went again Hallelujah don't you know that meat kind of man was at the altar the next night gave his heart to the Lord what seemed foolish to us is God's will Hallelujah that's what's wrong with the message people we're too starchy Hallelujah would dignified God wants some freedom you ever seen a leaf when it comes off that tree the wind blows it into it's the truth as a boy I know God orchestrates and he does what he wants to do here's I was a boy and and it had just rained now in my neighborhood when it rained we go play we go play in the water we get our little man-made boats and man made this and all of a sudden I seen a leaf thought and I saw a ant like it was waiting on the lead right when the leave came to the end the ant got on the leaf and the leaf took him Downstream he must have had an appointment huh you know what I'm saying it's the truth I don't know what what all with that about but God allowed me to see that leaf came in like as if it was ordained for that ant and that it got on that leave went down and then crossed on over the water would have downed it more than likely if God was mindful of the ant what about me what about you Hallelujah is this okay see you know the thing is which says I curse my neighbor I commit adultery I told a lie I stole lay his hands upon this dying lamb and he's talking about the the shadow what it was in the Old Testament those people did all those bad things everything Jews were just righteous people no Jews were evil they were just as evil as everybody else they did what everybody else did and God gave them the law to try to bind them up he gave them a system and understand that the system didn't work then and the system won't work now and what we in this message we caught look at the system that we have developed and let me tell you something as long as you allow yourself to live by the system you're going to remain dead Hallelujah when I was in school you know they said we're getting the cream of the cream of the cream of the crop and that's what God is doing he's getting the cream of the cream of the cream of the crop and by the time God finished won't be Holland nobody left you're gonna have your tires and you're going to have your test but I'm gonna tell you something most of all you need the Holy Ghost Hallelujah there's a system going to fail you people it's going to look what it's done throughout all the ages Oh I thought you know you know many people who never cut their hair in low dresses and everything else died in their sin huh you don't want to die in your sins you want to make sure you got the goods and these these Goods that we have has already been delivered and ministered to us you eat the word and let the word take form in you Hallelujah you love the Lord listen let me move on he said the priests examined and had to cut the little lamb throat or whatever bleeding bleeding kicking kicking and the worship was standing there and say yes that should be me but the lamb has taken my place but he went back with the same desires he would do it again just as soon as he got a chance in that way it is sometimes people leave out of church they come fast they cry and they go back back out and do the same thing it's a system it's a system that you're following and and you got to go beyond that you got to let God comes in remember brother random told a lie and went to his cave and stayed there all day praying Lord Don't Let Me Lie like that of again you got to take your sins seriously your shortcomings seriously and if you take it seriously God would then take you seriously and remove your stumbling block that's the way people do today they come in and confess and say I this that or the other and go back out and turn around and do the same thing over again join One Church another and if this one gets a little some something started and well I'll go to the this one that and you know that's why I say this is what happened to message teacher people they're the they're the most people they prosely like more than anybody I know y'all getting quiet oh it's the truth if they don't like this pastor they go the next one and if he doesn't say it the way they want him to say it they move to another one Hallelujah I told the brother who took the church for me there in in Ohio I said brother you got all these people coming in I want you to know they ain't going to stay you know why they're coming from somebody else's Church they faithful it ain't like you moving somewhere I'm just saying you're in the same city just a few blocks away y'all know what I'm trying to say I'm saying when you're faithful to God this building is almost nothing to you yo you like Corona and all that oh you know I I've heard people say they don't feel the presence of the Lord no more like they used to because they haven't gone to church what's wrong with you at any time if anywhere you ought to have a greater anointing with you now than ever you got all the distractions out of your way well you can go you and God can have a great and deeper relationship that's what's happened to me when they lock down the churches and you can't go do y'all know God tried me when I was in Lime I had I had so many musicians I had so much music and God sent me to a place that didn't have not one musician hey we didn't even have any great uh song leaders no no offense we did what we could do for years we praying Lord send some help and he did just that I look I gotta have my music I Gotta Have No no no I didn't even realize I had given that up for you know me I didn't even know it until years later I was thinking I said you know what Lord I said you know recording and music and all that I just loved it and you know I'm over here and almost I forgot how to see it you know almost I forgot how to sing but I know I'm in the perfect will of God y'all understand me Hallelujah is that the way Daniel fell then you had to feel funny you know he used to Services you know the priests and everybody rejoicing and having a great time and now he's over there having a one-man service even Shadrach Meshach and Abednego didn't even show up sometimes Hallelujah but it didn't stop Daniel he said I'm gonna pray three times not just one I'm gonna I'm gonna make sure me and God keep connected y'all understand me under that inspiration what was it Daniel and the Hebrew boys were determined to remain perfect in what way to always do the will of God that's what your Perfection is that desire and as long as you have that desire God will keep you coming you don't have to worry about making a Rapture you already wrapped it when you got that desire in your heart you already wrapped it you just waiting for the change of your body see because a lot of time we look at this shell yay I'm so glad this house of mine is not my perfection getting old and bald y'all understand me but the Inner Man I still feel like a child Hallelujah I forget sometime how old I am because I I tell you what I enjoy being saved then what happens what make the difference what's what went out of the lamb from the from the blood went went to life see the the life and the blood cell was only on his hands the life was a a circling the altar but the life of the Lamb could not come back on the worshiper though he confessed that he was wrong and the lamb took his place because a worshiper has a soul and he couldn't live as an animal you see so I I had so much other stuff I got to close but I had so much other stuff that I wanted to say but I'm gonna tell you like this people about perfectionist people like Noah the Bible said Noah was a just man and perfect in this generation I've heard people say well he was perfect in his genetics but don't you know what it took to remain perfect in his genetics when all of the sons of God was mixing with the sons of man it took something for Noah to say I'm determined I'm gonna stay with the promise see we don't see that and even though his sons mixed and married others he stayed true and you and I must understand that this this comes to a completion I was thinking about it today and I'm a coach because I have to finish later but my whole point is this it was a glorious thing when Paul said I have finished my course I've done all that he wants me to do I've laid my life down I've been Shipwrecked I've been pronounced dead about three times I've been beaten I've done everything and every time you say get up I got up and still I preach the gospel because he wanted me to do it I became a spectacle for him Hallelujah but Paul said oh I'm coming to the end of my journey and I've done all that I know to do I haven't seen nothing I've left out thank God he didn't is that right I've done it all and guess what people though my life has been rough here I've suffered many stripes and everything else he said but don't worry they'll lay up a Crown of Life For Me there's a great reward for me Hallelujah and let me tell you to the little bride don't you worry you might have to suffer you go through a lot of things and the greater of the suffering is yet to come but but determine in your heart that you're going to do the perfect will of God in every respect stay with the word of God is that all right Hallelujah you know Noah didn't do his will he did the will of of God and all of that you see the Bible said that Abraham Hallelujah you know is that right he said God God said to Abraham uh walk before me and be thou perfect many of y'all since you started it could say that you you and I mean in the mindset that we've had a perfection that you've been perfect matter of fact you and I know we're Bound for hell if we go with that law huh in our way you got genetics in you that's gonna cause you to mess up you didn't even ain't your fault your Grandmama gave it to your granddaddy genetics whatever you call it it's the truth it's going to cause you that's why Paul says listen don't trust this if you're going to stay in the will of God you must crucify this man every day tell on him tell on the devil like those old Saints say tell on the devil and shaman yeah the devil don't like your confession because if you're telling on him you're bringing him to a shame because he think he got you right he has you all right let's move on the first Peter said first Peter 5 10 11 says but the great but but the God of all Grace who have called us into an eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthens settles you the Bible said Jesus learn obedience by the things he suffered so if he had to suffer so will you it's okay it really is have you ever failed you yet he won't he won't fail you and even though it looked like you are on the bottom always understand you're on the top Hallelujah you are chosen people Hallelujah chosen God didn't make no mistake is that right but he said whatever you do do all things without murmuring and disputing you don't have to do that you don't need to go through the changes like that he said that ye may be blameless and harmless and the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom ye shine as likes as to the world in the world you love that Hallelujah I love that and I appreciate I got one more scripture and I'll let you go Hebrews 13 21 says he will make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ through whom be glory forever ever amen all right and that in that Amplified version which I like for it because of the way it works it he said he would strengthen you or complete perfect and make you what you ought to be and equip you with every good good that you may carry out his will he himself working in you and accomplishing that which is pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ the Messiah to whom be glory forever and ever to ages and ages amen a lot of words but the bottom line is the Christ in you that is the perfection that's what brings us to a complete uh surrendering to the Holy Spirit and those that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God and you don't have to worry every child of God will be chasing hey it's okay because at the end of the day it's going to yield some Peaceable fruits hallelujah we're not the children of rap people God did not choose us to be the children of Wrath but one thing we need to understand is if we are the bride we need to be calling out for everything that the bride is supposed to be equipped with y'all understand me is that right in closing brother when I used the illustration of a baby he said that's the only way that baby knows how to get what he needs from his parents is to cry out for he didn't even say get down on your knees and moan he said cry out for there is a law and there is a law that God respect and that is when you can get out of yourself and really get on your knees and cry out right was that Abigail which was the one that was crying out and and uh uh what's his name who produced Samuel Samuel's mama [Music] um Hannah Hannah okay I get a little mixed up sometimes I'm glad y'all biblical students can help me but Hannah I don't say it had to be funny it's the truth but but you know she cried out and it was the Eli you say you drunk you thought he was a she was a daughter Belial no no no no I got a request and I've sought the Lord with tears and then God drops on the prophet and then gives her a word you understand me let's stand when you have a request you could get before God and God will answer your prayer Hallelujah but you got to know you when you get down you get down to business now you understand that God didn't already answered and you one thing for certain you can't fake or cry I don't know about you but there are times I've I've been on my prayer on my knees and I have been so hardened throughout the day or through the tests and trials that I've gone through I said Lord soften me let me cry that's how I I relieve myself like that and it's just a wonderful feeling now everybody ain't crying that's okay but however you get to the place you need to get with Christ make sure you get there times as short the battles are raging I don't know about anybody here but I know I have been yeah it's been a real Battleground every day it's just been stuff but you know what I I have peace I really do I believe that if I die right now I'll be in the bosom of God because I realize it's not my righteousness became my sin but I might become the righteousness of God I love the Lord Hallelujah in moments life I'll sing out the love to Jesus Hallelujah [Music] know see here [Music] again [Music] foreign [Music] all that you do we love you Lord I trust somebody somewhere
