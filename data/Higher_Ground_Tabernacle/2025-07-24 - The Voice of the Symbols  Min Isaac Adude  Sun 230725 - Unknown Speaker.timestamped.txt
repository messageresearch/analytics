[36:07] hand. If they are too far, just wave to
[36:10] them and say, "Welcome into the house of
[36:12] the Lord."
[36:14] The house of the Lord there is liberty.

[37:10] the highest star
[37:15] and riches to
[37:19] the lowest here.
[37:23] Oh, the guilty pay

[37:39] to him,
[37:43] his
[37:44] child.

[47:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Build your hopes on things eternal.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Things that will stay forever, not
[47:54] things that will be here today and
[47:55] tomorrow that disappear.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you build your hopes on money
[48:00] and houses, cars, and all the things,
[48:03] today you might have it, but tomorrow
[48:05] you might lose it.
[48:06] Amen.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is the only person,
[48:11] &gt;&gt; the solid rock.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where we have to build our hopes.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We uh greet you all in the name of
[48:19] the Lord Jesus.
[48:22] We are so happy to be here u this
[48:25] evening.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And without taking too much time,
[48:30] let's turn our Bibles to the book of
[48:32] Numbers.
[48:35] We'll read from uh chapter numbers
[48:38] chapter 12 read from verse 6 to verse 8.
[48:46] Yes.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Numbers 12 verse 6 to verse 8.
[48:53] [Music]
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The the Bible says here,
[49:00] &gt;&gt; be ready.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Hear now, hear now my
[49:04] words. If there be a prophet among you,
[49:08] I the Lord will make myself known unto
[49:11] him in a vision, and will speak unto him
[49:14] in a dream.
[49:26] [Music]
[49:28] My servant Moses is not so who is
[49:32] faithful in all mine house.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; With him will I speak mouthto mouth even
[49:43] apparently
[49:45] and not in dark speeches. And the uh
[49:48] similitude of the Lord shall be shall he
[49:52] behold.
[50:08] Amen. So if you notice here verse six
[50:12] the Bible God here is talking it says
[50:14] that if there is a prophet
[50:19] I the Lord myself will make myself known
[50:21] unto him through dreams and visions.
[50:27] [Music]
[50:29] But when it comes to Moses,
[50:32] Amen, it's something different
[50:35] because I will speak with him mouth to
[50:37] mouth.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It won't be just visions and
[50:41] dreams.
[50:44] It will be a personal contact.
[50:48] Amen. From my mouth, my mouth and then
[50:50] he will hear straight from his ears.
[50:54] Amen. Let's uh let's turn to Revelation
[50:57] 5 6-7.
[51:03] Amen. Tonight we will try to teach a
[51:06] little bit for few minutes here.
[51:12] Amen. And uh we'll see where the Lord
[51:15] will lead us and
[51:19] I know that the time is already gone.
[51:21] It's almost 8 and will not stay here
[51:23] forever.
[51:27] All right. Revelation 5 verse 6-7.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's uh
[51:37] let's just start from verse one.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Just to get a context.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here John says here, "And I saw in
[51:46] the right hand of him that sat on the
[51:48] throne a book written within and on the
[51:52] the backside sealed with seven seals."
[52:04] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[52:07] with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to
[52:09] open the book and to lose the seals
[52:12] thereof?
[52:19] And no man in heaven, nor in earth,
[52:22] neither under the earth, was able to
[52:24] open the book, neither to look thereon.
[52:33] Amen. I And I wept much because no man
[52:37] was found worthy to open and to read the
[52:40] book.
[52:47] neither to look thereon. And verse five,
[52:50] and one of the elders says, saith unto
[52:53] me, weep not. Behold, the lion of the
[52:57] tribe of Judah, the root of David, has
[53:01] prevailed to open the book, and to lose
[53:04] the seven seals thereof.
[53:13] And not beheld. And low in the midst of
[53:16] the throne, and of the four beast, and
[53:19] in the midst of the elders stood a lamb,
[53:23] as he had been slain, having seven
[53:26] horns, and seven eyes, which are the
[53:28] seven spirits of God, sent forth into
[53:31] all the earth.
[53:43] And he came and took the book out of the
[53:46] right hand of him that sat upon the
[53:49] throne.
[53:53] Amen. Let's bow our heads. Father God,
[53:56] we come to you, Lord.
[54:00] Lord Jesus, with all our faults, Lord,
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Lord, all our burdens and everything,
[54:06] Father, just as we are,
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray, Father God, that uh you
[54:12] cleanse us, Lord.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you forgive our sins, oh God.
[54:18] Lord, that you forgive our iniquities,
[54:19] oh Lord. Lord Jesus, the word that we
[54:22] just read, oh Father,
[54:25] Lord, we pray, Father God, that you come
[54:26] and you bring the revelation to us,
[54:30] Lord, it doesn't matter how long I've
[54:32] spent studying this word,
[54:35] but if you don't
[54:38] bring this word to your feet,
[54:41] Lord, all the sacrifices will be
[54:43] meaningless.
[54:45] Lord, we
[54:48] ask you father to take the preeminence
[54:51] to help me to be so sensitive to the
[54:53] Holy Spirit
[54:56] to say only what you want me to say,
[54:57] Father.
[54:59] Lord bless every hearts in this place
[55:01] Lord
[55:02] in Jesus Christ name we say amen.
[55:06] Amen.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So tonight uh the subject will be
[55:11] the voice of the symbols.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The voice of the symbols.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh as as as a uh as a foundation
[55:24] before I get to before I get straight to
[55:26] my teaching.
[55:29] Amen. In the Old Testament or whenever
[55:33] there is no prophet
[55:37] when God needs to speak to someone
[55:38] through a dream or or a vision.
[55:44] Amen. Brother Brennham says that the
[55:45] message is clear
[55:49] when there is no prophet in the land.
[55:52] Amen. God does not speak through
[55:54] symbols.
[55:57] Amen. Look at
[55:59] Joseph.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. When God was telling to when God
[56:04] showed gave the vision or the dream to
[56:07] Joseph,
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a clear vision.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Joseph, take Mary as for your wife.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. When when God showed the vision or
[56:20] the dream to the magi,
[56:23] [Music]
[56:26] Amen. It was a clear dream.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do not return to Herod.
[56:33] Amen. Because there were no prophets in
[56:35] in the land.
[56:37] It meant nobody was there to explain.
[56:42] So God had to speak clearly.
[56:46] Amen. But when there is a prophet in the
[56:48] land,
[56:49] amen, the word of God according to MS3,
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says that the word comes
[56:56] through the prophet first.
[56:59] Amen. So God will have to reveal his
[57:01] word to the prophet.
[57:04] So when you see dreams that happen when
[57:06] the prophet is in the land,
[57:10] those people they see symbols.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. They don't understand the voice of
[57:16] it.
[57:18] Amen. They don't understand the meaning
[57:20] of it.
[57:22] Amen. They only see symbols.
[57:25] Amen. But God will have to reveal those
[57:27] symbols to a prophet.
[57:31] And the prophet will have to bring you
[57:33] the voice of those symbols.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible is full of symbols.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you look at you study the the
[57:43] book of Genesis,
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. when Moses was writing about when
[57:48] Moses was writing in Genesis chapter 3.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Genesis chapter 3 verse 23 I
[57:55] believe.
[57:57] Amen. Uh when Moses was writing this
[58:02] Amen. Moses was writing the symbols that
[58:04] he was seeing in the vision
[58:09] because notice that Moses was not there
[58:12] when the world or when the earth was
[58:14] created.
[58:17] Amen. Moses was not there when when when
[58:20] when God when Adam and Eve was there.
[58:24] Amen. So when Moses started writing
[58:28] Amen. Moses was riding at what he saw.
[58:33] Amen. He saw a tree of life.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; And Moses said there was a tree of life
[58:38] in the middle of the garden.
[58:43] Eve or the the serpent giving the fruit
[58:46] to Eve.
[58:49] Amen. Moses wrote the fruits.
[58:52] Amen. But the the meaning of it,
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. was hidden,
[58:59] Amen. until God appointed a time for
[59:02] that revelation.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; So when brother Brandham came,
[59:08] Amen, he started explaining to us,
[59:12] Amen, what Moses wrote,
[59:15] Amen, the voice behind those symbols,
[59:19] Amen, telling us that the tree of life,
[59:24] Amen, is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the fruit, Amen, was not an
[59:30] apple.
[59:34] Amen. And and the tree of good and evil,
[59:38] Amen. was not a mango or something that
[59:40] we
[59:42] said that that tree was a woman.
[59:46] Amen. So the book if the Bible is full
[59:49] of symbols.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. when uh the king uh uh in Daniel
[59:54] uh Nebuchadnezzar had a dream.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. His second dream
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; in Daniel chapter 4.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw symbols.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of a tree going up to the heavens.
[1:00:11] Amen. But he did not understand what
[1:00:13] those symbols meant.
[1:00:17] So he had to inquire.
[1:00:20] Amen. people who were able to interpret
[1:00:23] what he saw.
[1:00:27] The Bibles in Daniel chapter 4 tells us
[1:00:31] that he calls he called his magicians.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. He called the sorcerers.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He called those wise people
[1:00:40] and none of them were able to explain to
[1:00:43] the king what he saw.
[1:00:47] Even though the king gave them the
[1:00:48] symbols,
[1:00:51] But the king had to go ask for Daniel to
[1:00:54] come
[1:00:56] because Daniel was the prophet
[1:01:00] and the word could only come to the
[1:01:02] prophets.
[1:01:04] But when Daniel came and started
[1:01:06] explaining to him
[1:01:09] and he explained to him what the dream
[1:01:11] was.
[1:01:13] Amen. For the sake of time we're not
[1:01:15] going to go in detail on that.
[1:01:18] Amen. But you can find it in Daniel
[1:01:19] chapter 4.
[1:01:22] But when it comes to in Daniel chapter
[1:01:23] 2,
[1:01:26] the king had another dream.
[1:01:29] But this time, the king himself could
[1:01:33] not remember his dream.
[1:01:36] Amen. The king had a dream.
[1:01:39] Amen. But for some reason, he forgot
[1:01:41] about it.
[1:01:43] And I believe that God doesn't do things
[1:01:46] just for the sake of doing it.
[1:01:50] That dream was a type of the seventh
[1:01:52] seal.
[1:01:55] Amen. A silence.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The the king saw a dream.
[1:02:00] Amen. But he could not explain. He could
[1:02:03] not remember the dream.
[1:02:05] So he asked people to tell him what he
[1:02:08] dreamed of.
[1:02:11] Amen. He called the magicians.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He called the sorcerers.
[1:02:17] Amen. And nobody could tell him. Amen.
[1:02:20] All of them were saying, "But king, you
[1:02:22] have to tell us a little bit of what you
[1:02:23] saw.
[1:02:26] Give us an idea of what you saw."
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the king said, "I don't have I
[1:02:31] don't know it
[1:02:34] with it. I I can't remember."
[1:02:38] And the king was so frustrated.
[1:02:41] And he decided he said he had a decree
[1:02:44] to kill all those people, the wise men.
[1:02:48] But when they went to talk to Daniel,
[1:02:52] Amen. Daniel when he came,
[1:02:55] Amen. Daniel did not ask the king what
[1:02:57] he saw.
[1:02:59] Amen. But Daniel told the king, Amen.
[1:03:03] Give me time.
[1:03:05] Amen. To go and pray God.
[1:03:08] Amen. to go and ask God
[1:03:11] because he is the one who reveals grace.
[1:03:17] So he took with him Shadrach, Meshach
[1:03:19] and Abedne,
[1:03:22] he went and prayed. Amen. And when
[1:03:25] Daniel started explaining the dream,
[1:03:29] first he started telling the king what
[1:03:31] he saw.
[1:03:33] Amen. He started telling the king the
[1:03:35] symbols that he saw.
[1:03:39] Amen. Of a statue.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Having different material built
[1:03:45] with different materials.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; The head was different than the than the
[1:03:51] feet.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And a stone came and and broke it.
[1:03:57] Amen. So Daniel started telling the king
[1:04:00] the symbols that he saw.
[1:04:04] after the symbols.
[1:04:06] He gave the king the voice of those
[1:04:08] symbols.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; In other words, he gave the king the
[1:04:13] revelation
[1:04:16] of the meaning of what he saw.
[1:04:20] Amen. So that that was the case in the
[1:04:23] Old Testament.
[1:04:25] Amen. You have the same thing with
[1:04:26] Joseph
[1:04:28] when he was in prison. I believe in
[1:04:30] Genesis chapter 40. Amen.
[1:04:33] Those two prisoners, they had dreams.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And their dreams were full of
[1:04:39] symbols.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And only Joseph was there was able
[1:04:44] to interpret
[1:04:48] what those dreams, what those symbols
[1:04:50] were.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so is the book of Revelation.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The book of Revelation
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; is a book of symbols.
[1:05:03] Amen. You can take this book
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; and spend 500 years
[1:05:10] reading it every day.
[1:05:14] You will you will never be able to
[1:05:16] understand it.
[1:05:18] Amen. You will think that you have
[1:05:20] understood.
[1:05:22] Amen. But you know, you do you don't
[1:05:24] understand. You won't be able to
[1:05:25] understand it.
[1:05:28] Amen. It's like today I saw a brother
[1:05:30] posting something. Amen.
[1:05:33] A preacher was preaching is not a
[1:05:34] message believer.
[1:05:36] Amen. He was preaching about Revelation
[1:05:39] 10 1-7.
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:42] And it says that it says that the the
[1:05:44] the angel that the Bible is talking
[1:05:46] about.
[1:05:48] Amen. Had one foot on the sea
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; to control the sea
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; and one foot on the land.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. The brother turned to this church
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; and he says that that that that that
[1:06:05] angel was an animal. It wasn't it was a
[1:06:07] hippo.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the deacon that were behind
[1:06:14] the pulpit
[1:06:17] all of them saying amen. Amen.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said that when God asked Jo, he
[1:06:23] said that God asked Job
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; what was my first creation?
[1:06:30] Job said, "I don't know."
[1:06:33] And God told He said that God told Job,
[1:06:34] he was a hippo.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And people said, "Amen."
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You see that the Bible is
[1:06:42] full of symbols.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Without a prophet,
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. you will be lost.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Without a prophet,
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; and everybody will have their own
[1:06:55] interpretation.
[1:06:58] of what the Bible says.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can go to school and study
[1:07:04] about it. Amen. But you will never have
[1:07:07] the revelation.
[1:07:10] Amen. Unless that revelation comes from
[1:07:12] a prophet.
[1:07:16] Amen. You say, "Well, what do you mean?"
[1:07:20] Amen. Let's go to uh uh uh Revelation
[1:07:24] chapter 10.
[1:07:26] this.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation chapter 10 or before we
[1:07:33] go there, let's uh read u something
[1:07:35] here.
[1:07:47] All right, that's fine. Let's let's go
[1:07:49] to um uh Revelation chapter 10 verse 1-7
[1:07:52] here.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here the Bible says,
[1:08:00] "And I saw another mighty angel come
[1:08:02] down from heaven
[1:08:08] clothed with a cloud,
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; and a rainbow was upon his head.
[1:08:16] And his face was as it were the sun,
[1:08:21] and his feet as pillars of fire.
[1:08:25] And he had in his hand a little book
[1:08:28] open.
[1:08:31] And he set his right foot upon the sea,
[1:08:35] and his left foot on the earth,
[1:08:38] and cried with a loud voice, as when the
[1:08:40] lion roared.
[1:08:43] And when he had cried,
[1:08:45] seven thunders uttered their voices.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; And when the seven thunders had uttered
[1:08:52] their voices,
[1:08:56] I was about to write it. And I heard a
[1:08:59] voice from heaven, saying,
[1:09:03] "Seal up those things which the seven
[1:09:05] thunders uttered,
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; and write them not."
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the angel which I saw
[1:09:15] stand upon the sea and upon the earth
[1:09:19] lifted up his hand to heaven.
[1:09:24] And swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:09:26] ever.
[1:09:29] Who created heaven and the things that
[1:09:31] therein,
[1:09:33] and the earth and things that therein
[1:09:35] are,
[1:09:37] and the sea and the thing therein are.
[1:09:42] that there should be time no longer.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now let's pay attention to
[1:09:47] this.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. But in the days of the voice of
[1:09:52] the seventh angel,
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; when he shall begin the sound,
[1:10:00] the mystery of God shall be finished
[1:10:05] as he has declared to his servants, the
[1:10:07] prophets.
[1:10:10] Amen. So when the seventh angel,
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; amen, will be sounding,
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; amen, all the mysteries of God
[1:10:20] will be finished.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in other words,
[1:10:25] there will be no other or angel,
[1:10:30] amen, coming after this one.
[1:10:34] Amen. To reveal the mysteries.
[1:10:37] First of all, because there will be no
[1:10:39] mysteries to be revealed.
[1:10:42] Amen. Some people say that
[1:10:45] I said there are some some some stuff
[1:10:47] that are not revealed in the Bible.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Well, the question is who will come?
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was reading and someone say,
[1:10:56] "Brother Joseph,
[1:11:00] well, I don't know what you mean."
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Bible tells me
[1:11:06] Amen. That when that seventh angel,
[1:11:10] amen, shall begin to sound,
[1:11:13] amen, the mystery of God will be
[1:11:15] revealed.
[1:11:17] Amen. So there will be no other
[1:11:19] prophets.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a prophet,
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; amen, is also an angel.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this revelation chapter 10
[1:11:31] is 1 to 7.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you understand is divided in
[1:11:36] three parts.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. The first part is Revelation 10
[1:11:41] 1-4.
[1:11:44] Amen. Those that talks about the
[1:11:46] mysteries.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Revelation chapter 10 1-4
[1:11:53] is talking about three mysteries.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; The first mystery,
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. is the mystery of the mighty of
[1:12:01] the mighty angel.
[1:12:03] Amen. Who's coming down from heaven?
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the second mystery,
[1:12:09] Amen. is the mystery of the little book
[1:12:12] open.
[1:12:15] Amen. And the and and the third mystery.
[1:12:18] Amen. Is the mystery of the seven
[1:12:20] thunders.
[1:12:22] Amen. That utter their voices.
[1:12:25] That is the first part of that verse of
[1:12:27] that of that that part that portion.
[1:12:31] Amen. And the second part of it,
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. is the declaration.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's the verse five to
[1:12:39] verse six.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Saying that, showing what what
[1:12:44] that angel will do.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. What who is that angel and and his
[1:12:50] position?
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this the third part,
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. is talking about the seventh
[1:12:57] angel.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the seventh angel
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; is not that mighty angel
[1:13:05] is different than to the mighty angel.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. The seventh angel,
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. is a prophet.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of the of the seventh church age.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the mighty angel,
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who is coming down from the
[1:13:26] heaven. Amen. clothed with with the
[1:13:28] cloud.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So to go back a little bit here.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; So we have to understand
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; that when God speaks
[1:13:44] only the prophet can understand it.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Only the prophet.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham. Uh if we read uh
[1:13:54] the message the spiritual food in due
[1:13:56] season
[1:13:57] [Music]
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paragraph 116
[1:14:08] paragraph
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet here is telling the an
[1:14:12] events that happened.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Was preached in 65 uh uh July 18th
[1:14:20] in the evening.
[1:14:23] Amen. So, paragraph 116, the prophet
[1:14:25] says
[1:14:27] and I started I started to walk around.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Then I heard the voice of God speak
[1:14:35] said, "Get out of the way quickly.
[1:14:39] Roy Robertson standing there
[1:14:42] knowing he was a veteran of the waret.
[1:14:47] I put my hand on his shoulder
[1:14:51] and I said, "Brother Roy,
[1:14:53] hide as quick as you can."
[1:14:58] Then he said, "What's the matter?"
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; I said, "Get out of the way. Hide."
[1:15:05] Amen. So now noticed and just as and
[1:15:09] just started walking around,
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; put my shovel down,
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; turned around,
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; took off my hat.
[1:15:19] Amen. Because he knew that the Lord was
[1:15:21] about to speak
[1:15:24] when the Lord is about to speak. Amen.
[1:15:27] You have to show respect.
[1:15:29] Amen. That's why God told Moses,
[1:15:32] "Take off your shoes because you're
[1:15:35] standing on holy ground."
[1:15:38] That's why he told Joshua, "Take off
[1:15:40] your shoes because you're standing on
[1:15:42] holy ground."
[1:15:45] A sign of respect.
[1:15:47] So he took off his hat
[1:15:50] and here he come.
[1:15:53] Glory of God falling in a whirlwind.
[1:15:57] Amen.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; That tore the side of the mountain out
[1:16:05] like that
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; and blasted and shook the place like
[1:16:10] that.
[1:16:12] Amen. Cut the top of the bushes out
[1:16:17] just about three or four or five feet
[1:16:19] above my head.
[1:16:22] went back up like a funnel like that
[1:16:27] and blasted again.
[1:16:29] And here I come three times.
[1:16:33] Amen. Then when I when he left
[1:16:36] time,
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; brother Banks come over said
[1:16:42] that's what you was talking about.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; I said yes. Said what was it? He asked
[1:16:49] what was it?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice here
[1:16:53] both of them felt what happened.
[1:16:58] Amen. They felt the power of God.
[1:17:01] Only the prophet
[1:17:04] was able to hear the voice.
[1:17:08] Amen. Behind.
[1:17:10] Amen. The symbols that happened.
[1:17:13] Amen. If brother if if that brother came
[1:17:16] back
[1:17:18] amen. and you ask him what happened.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is he going to tell you?
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will tell you that the
[1:17:25] mountain, the top of the mountain was
[1:17:27] cut off,
[1:17:30] the bushes was cut off. Amen. He will
[1:17:32] only tell you the symbols.
[1:17:35] Amen. That he was able to see.
[1:17:39] But he will not be able to tell you the
[1:17:41] message
[1:17:44] that was hiding behind all of that.
[1:17:47] So only the prophet
[1:17:50] Amen who is able
[1:17:52] to tell you the voice
[1:17:55] of what happened.
[1:17:57] So he asked the prophet
[1:18:00] said what was it? I said God appears in
[1:18:04] whirlwinds.
[1:18:07] I didn't know whether he wanted me to
[1:18:08] tell the people or not.
[1:18:12] Then I went on and prayed a little bit.
[1:18:15] Then he told me I could tell him.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; I said judgment striking the west coast.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what brother Brandham said.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was the voice
[1:18:32] of those symbols.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those that voice was amen. The
[1:18:37] judgment
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; striking the west coast.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at her today.
[1:18:45] Look what happened a few hours ago.
[1:18:49] Alaska sunk
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; and now the whole thing is going under.
[1:18:56] We entering into the judgment.
[1:18:59] Mercy has been spawned.
[1:19:04] Amen. So without the prophet
[1:19:06] Amen there will be no interpretation of
[1:19:09] the word.
[1:19:11] There will be confusion.
[1:19:14] People bringing their own revelations,
[1:19:17] people bringing their own thoughts
[1:19:21] trying to explain.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. What's going on, Amen. But the
[1:19:26] prophet,
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. receives the message from God.
[1:19:31] Amen. The same way God told Moses,
[1:19:34] God told Miriam and Aaron,
[1:19:37] I speak through prophets. I speak to
[1:19:39] prophets. Amen. Through visions and
[1:19:42] dreams. Amen. But Moses,
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I speak to him mouth to mouth.
[1:19:49] Amen. And I believe, Amen. that in this
[1:19:51] last age, Amen. The seventh message.
[1:19:56] Amen. God did not only speak to him
[1:19:58] through visions and dreams.
[1:20:02] He spoke to him mouth to mouth.
[1:20:05] God appeared to him. Amen. But Moses
[1:20:08] could not see.
[1:20:11] Moses wanted to see the face of God.
[1:20:15] They made him saw made him see his back.
[1:20:19] But in this last age, Amen. God was kind
[1:20:23] enough.
[1:20:24] Amen. To let us see his face.
[1:20:28] Amen. He saw us his face.
[1:20:31] That's when when brother Brandham saw
[1:20:33] this picture for the first time,
[1:20:36] he said that this is the closest picture
[1:20:38] of Jesus.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why?
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Because he was able to compare it.
[1:20:47] Amen. To something he saw.
[1:20:50] Amen. Not just something that he heard.
[1:20:54] He saw the face of it. Amen. when he saw
[1:20:57] this picture,
[1:20:59] he said that this is the closest
[1:21:02] that he has sin.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to u uh steal the the the
[1:21:08] the spiritual food in due season.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Now in paragraph 84,
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You will see that even things that
[1:21:18] we do take for granted.
[1:21:27] Amen.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Even like the cloud.
[1:21:31] Amen. If the prophet was not there,
[1:21:34] nobody will be able to understand what
[1:21:36] it was.
[1:21:39] Amen. In paragraph 84 of the second
[1:21:42] season,
[1:21:50] Amen. Paragraph 84, brother.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Then when that went up,
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. talking about the cloud that 63.
[1:22:01] Amen. The big observ observatories
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; from way down in California
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; plumbed down in Mexico
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; over Texan
[1:22:16] everywhere
[1:22:17] taking the picture of it.
[1:22:20] It was a mysterious sight.
[1:22:24] Brother Fred Sman there
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; sitting right back there
[1:22:31] and I and brother Gin Norman
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; standing right there present
[1:22:40] when it went up
[1:22:42] they took the picture.
[1:22:45] Amen. Still they don't know what about
[1:22:48] it.
[1:22:49] [Music]
[1:22:51] Amen. They saw something strange. Amen.
[1:22:54] They saw something unnormal.
[1:22:58] Amen. And they took a picture of it.
[1:23:01] Amen. But they don't know what about it.
[1:23:06] Amen. Here some time ago.
[1:23:09] Everybody's saying, "Look here."
[1:23:11] Amen. This looks like this.
[1:23:14] Amen. And them angels wings
[1:23:17] and how they're folded in there.
[1:23:22] So now one day
[1:23:24] turning it to the right.
[1:23:28] Amen. Looking
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; there was Jesus Christ
[1:23:33] just as perfect as of men
[1:23:38] as of man ever drawn him.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was standing there
[1:23:46] with a white wig on
[1:23:49] [Music]
[1:23:51] Amen. Looking back down towards the
[1:23:53] earth.
[1:23:55] Amen. Showing that he is the supreme
[1:23:58] authority.
[1:24:00] Amen. The heavens declares it. Declare
[1:24:02] it. The Bible declares it. The message
[1:24:07] declares it. All the same. Amen. Supreme
[1:24:12] authority.
[1:24:14] Amen. With the white wig on.
[1:24:17] You see his black beard under
[1:24:21] he started showing you.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the message u uh um uh u um
[1:24:28] I forgot the um
[1:24:32] uh uh this scripture is fulfilled I
[1:24:35] believe.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It might be there or somewhere
[1:24:38] else. Amen. You see that brother
[1:24:40] Brennham is able to point
[1:24:43] Amen. Pointing the eyes.
[1:24:46] Amen. Pointing the nose. Amen. Pointing
[1:24:50] the mouth. Amen. He's even saying that
[1:24:53] those the white clouds that was
[1:24:55] surrounding him,
[1:24:57] Amen. were seven angels.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was able to point the seventh
[1:25:03] angel.
[1:25:04] Amen. And he says that the the angel
[1:25:07] that made that that caught his
[1:25:09] attention.
[1:25:10] Amen. It was that seventh angel.
[1:25:14] Amen. You see, nobody understood what it
[1:25:16] was.
[1:25:17] Amen. Nobody had an idea.
[1:25:21] Amen. But only the prophet. Amen. Had to
[1:25:24] receive the revelation from God.
[1:25:28] Amen. And the prophet will come and
[1:25:30] explain it to us.
[1:25:33] It says that we got it back there.
[1:25:37] Just turn it to the right.
[1:25:39] Amen. First of all, they were looking it
[1:25:41] all wrong.
[1:25:44] Amen. They were looking it all wrong.
[1:25:46] Amen. When you look at it all wrong.
[1:25:50] Amen. You can't see the right picture.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like the brother Brandham.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. They went to hunt.
[1:25:58] And the other brother was looking
[1:26:00] through the scope.
[1:26:03] Amen. And he sees three animals or three
[1:26:05] I don't remember the numbers.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was looking at all wrong.
[1:26:12] But when brother came,
[1:26:15] he was able to adjust the scope.
[1:26:19] Amen. And he was able to see only the
[1:26:21] one hand.
[1:26:23] So you need the prophet
[1:26:26] on earth,
[1:26:28] to be able to explain to you,
[1:26:32] what those symbols are.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:39] There he is. just as perfect as he was.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; It had been photographed of him.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're looking at they're looking
[1:26:50] at it from the wrong angle.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; You got to look at it in the right
[1:26:56] angle.
[1:26:59] Amen. And only the Lord can reveal which
[1:27:03] is the right angle.
[1:27:09] Amen. Only the Lord
[1:27:12] can reveal
[1:27:14] which is the right angle.
[1:27:17] Amen. And when the Lord decide to reveal
[1:27:19] the right
[1:27:22] come to brother Isaac,
[1:27:25] Amen. to reveal it to him because I am
[1:27:28] not a prophet.
[1:27:30] Amen. But he will go to the major
[1:27:33] prophet.
[1:27:35] He is the messenger of the age.
[1:27:38] He will go to him and he will reveal the
[1:27:41] right hand to him
[1:27:44] and then he will come to me.
[1:27:47] Brother Isaac, you were looking at this
[1:27:50] wrong
[1:27:52] to the right.
[1:27:54] Amen. And you will see that it is the
[1:27:57] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Only the prophet.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. There he is.
[1:28:06] just as perfect
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; if it had been photographed up there.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there is nobody else coming to
[1:28:16] reveal.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no one.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet is gone.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Which means that all the mysteries, all
[1:28:25] the mysteries in the Bible,
[1:28:28] Amen. Every single one of them,
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. have been revealed.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. including the seven thunders.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. The seventh seal.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. The trumpets.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And all those mysteries.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. All of them have been revealed.
[1:28:49] Amen. So if you don't have the
[1:28:51] understanding or the revelation,
[1:28:55] pray and ask God.
[1:28:58] Amen. To grant it to you. Amen. Because
[1:29:01] you can read what the prophet is saying.
[1:29:05] Amen. But you still can be blinded by
[1:29:07] it.
[1:29:09] Amen. Because says the word of God is
[1:29:12] like a puzzle.
[1:29:14] Amen. God will put a piece here.
[1:29:18] Amen. He'll put another piece there.
[1:29:21] Amen. He'll put another piece here.
[1:29:23] Amen. So when you're reading it,
[1:29:26] without the revelation,
[1:29:29] you won't be able to connect those
[1:29:31] pieces up.
[1:29:34] to make a perfect picture. Amen. Your
[1:29:36] picture will be wrong. Amen. So, you
[1:29:40] need the revelation.
[1:29:42] Even when you're reading the message,
[1:29:45] you still need the revelation.
[1:29:48] That's why says the revelation is a
[1:29:51] great thing that God can give to a
[1:29:53] believer.
[1:29:55] Amen. Because his own church,
[1:29:58] he's not built upon Jesus Christ.
[1:30:02] Amen. His own church. Amen. He's built.
[1:30:06] Amen. Upon the revelation,
[1:30:09] Amen. of who Jesus Christ is. Amen. So
[1:30:13] the revelation,
[1:30:15] Amen. is a great thing
[1:30:17] that God can give to you. Amen. So only
[1:30:21] God can give you the revelation.
[1:30:24] The prophet goes as far to say
[1:30:27] that even faith
[1:30:30] is a revelation.
[1:30:32] Amen. The faith that Abraham had
[1:30:36] Abraham did not take him by by himself.
[1:30:40] Amen. But that faith was given to him by
[1:30:42] God.
[1:30:44] Was revealed to him by God
[1:30:47] to endure those 25 years of waiting for
[1:30:50] Isaac.
[1:30:52] Amen. Even faith is a revelation.
[1:30:56] So without a revelation,
[1:30:58] you won't be able to go anywhere.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the message, the bridge between
[1:31:05] the seven seals, the seven church ages
[1:31:08] and the seven seals.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paragraph 40.
[1:31:18] Brother Brandham says here
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; now you see
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; I'm just not making that up.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not making it up.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; It's death is thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I will read it to you out of the
[1:31:41] book.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. The sounding of the seventh
[1:31:46] angel's message,
[1:31:51] the mystery of God should be finished
[1:31:55] that's been declared by his holy
[1:31:58] prophets.
[1:32:00] That's the prophet who has wrote the B
[1:32:03] the word.
[1:32:06] Amen. And at the sounding,
[1:32:10] the seventh church age,
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; the last church age,
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; all the loose ends,
[1:32:20] the through these church ages
[1:32:24] has been probed at.
[1:32:30] Amen. We'll be wind up together.
[1:32:34] Amen. So when the seventh angel is gone,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; the seventh messenger is gone,
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; there will be no loose end.
[1:32:46] Amen. Because when you understand the
[1:32:48] mystery of the the the the the
[1:32:52] u
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brham's uh uh uh mission,
[1:32:56] the mission of
[1:32:58] Amen. You will see that he has two
[1:33:00] parts.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. The first part
[1:33:04] was restoration.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. But because before God reveals the
[1:33:09] word,
[1:33:11] Amen, he has to make sure the foundation
[1:33:13] is solid.
[1:33:16] Amen. Because if the foundation is not
[1:33:18] solid,
[1:33:20] Amen. It will bring more trouble, more
[1:33:22] confusion.
[1:33:24] Amen. So the first part of his of his
[1:33:26] ministry,
[1:33:27] Amen, was the restoration. Amen. The
[1:33:30] same way Elijah has to restore, Amen.
[1:33:32] the ark.
[1:33:37] Amen. So did
[1:33:41] Elasha had to restore.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the altar. Thank you.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So is Malachi 4. Amen. William
[1:33:52] Brham. Amen. Has also to restore the
[1:33:55] altar. The altar. Amen. That's why he
[1:33:58] preached about marriage and divorce.
[1:34:01] That's why he preached about the serpent
[1:34:02] seed.
[1:34:04] That's why he preached about the baptism
[1:34:05] of the Holy
[1:34:08] That's why he preached about baptizing
[1:34:09] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:14] everything that the devil took away from
[1:34:20] and after the restoration is done
[1:34:23] then God will come and reveal
[1:34:27] amen those mysteries.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen to the church.
[1:34:32] Amen. So that's been declared by his
[1:34:35] holy prophets.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a prophet who has wrote the
[1:34:40] word
[1:34:41] at the sounding of the seventh church
[1:34:44] age.
[1:34:46] The last church age all the loose ends.
[1:34:50] Now through these church ages had been
[1:34:52] probed at
[1:34:56] war wind up together
[1:34:58] and then the seals are broken.
[1:35:03] Amen. So before the seals be broken.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. All everything has to
[1:35:09] be wind up together.
[1:35:12] No loose ends.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when and and when the seals
[1:35:16] are broken,
[1:35:18] the mystery is revealed.
[1:35:22] Down comes the angel.
[1:35:25] The messenger
[1:35:27] Christ
[1:35:29] sitting his foot upon the land
[1:35:33] and upon the sea
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; with a rainbow over his head.
[1:35:38] Now remember, this seventh angel is on
[1:35:42] earth.
[1:35:45] Amen. The seventh angel.
[1:35:47] Amen. That's that's Revelation 10 10:7.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. This seventh angel,
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; amen, is on earth at the time of his
[1:35:59] coming.
[1:36:01] Amen. Just as John was giving his
[1:36:03] message,
[1:36:06] the same time that Messiah come in the
[1:36:08] days.
[1:36:11] Amen. John knew he would see him.
[1:36:15] Amen. Because he was going to introduce
[1:36:18] him.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; And we realize that
[1:36:22] in the scriptures
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; over in Malachi chapter 4. Amen. There
[1:36:28] is to be one like John.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Elijah
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; to whom the word of God
[1:36:36] can come to and he is to reveal.
[1:36:41] Amen. Not only his own interpretation,
[1:36:45] not only something that he will come and
[1:36:47] make or make
[1:36:50] not a made up thought.
[1:36:52] Amen. But he will reveal
[1:36:56] by the Holy Spirit.
[1:36:59] Amen. All the mysteries of God.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Spirit.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Will reveal.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Will talk to the prophets.
[1:37:10] Prophets. Amen. Will reveal all the
[1:37:12] mysteries of God.
[1:37:14] The prophet here did not say some of the
[1:37:17] mysteries.
[1:37:19] Amen. If you read the message, the
[1:37:21] trumpets,
[1:37:23] Amen. The prophet says,
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. that the seventh angel, seventh
[1:37:27] messenger,
[1:37:29] will reveal all the mysteries of God.
[1:37:32] Amen. All the mysteries of God. Amen.
[1:37:35] Every mysteries that the Bible is
[1:37:36] talking about
[1:37:38] whether be translation
[1:37:42] whether be the second coming. Amen. All
[1:37:45] those mysteries, Amen. are supposed to
[1:37:48] be revealed.
[1:37:50] Amen. But the seventh messenger,
[1:37:54] Amen. The mysteries of God and restore
[1:37:58] the faith of the children back to the
[1:38:00] faith of the apostles.
[1:38:06] Amen. Restore back all these mysteries
[1:38:08] that proved it.
[1:38:11] through these denominational years.
[1:38:15] Now that's what the word said.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; I am just responsible
[1:38:23] for what is said.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; In other words, I cannot add
[1:38:30] or I cannot take away.
[1:38:32] Amen. I am just responsible
[1:38:35] for what the word said.
[1:38:38] Everything the word said that is what I
[1:38:41] have brought to you.
[1:38:43] Amen. Nothing more
[1:38:46] nothing less. Amen. It's written. Amen.
[1:38:50] Is right. Amen. That's what it is.
[1:38:54] Now we see that this seven seal book
[1:39:00] is the mystery of redemption.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; It's a book of redemption
[1:39:07] from God. Now all the mysteries
[1:39:12] at this time should be finished at the
[1:39:15] sounding of this message.
[1:39:20] Amen. So people today they're fuss about
[1:39:22] if the seventh seal has been remove
[1:39:30] because it was a moment of of silence.
[1:39:33] Amen. If you read the message the
[1:39:35] seventh seal
[1:39:37] the prophet himself at the end.
[1:39:40] Amen. He was wondering if the me if that
[1:39:42] was revealed or not.
[1:39:45] Amen. But here it says that all the
[1:39:47] mysteries
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. including that seventh seal.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall be revealed.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here is the angel on earth.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Verse 45, he said, "And now
[1:40:03] all the mysteries
[1:40:05] at this time shall be finished at the
[1:40:09] sounding of this messenger."
[1:40:12] Amen. Now
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; here is the angel on earth
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; and another angel
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; mighty messenger
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; come down.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; See this angel
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; was an earthly angel messenger.
[1:40:33] Amen. But here comes one down from
[1:40:36] heaven.
[1:40:39] A rainbow covenant.
[1:40:41] If only Christ
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; it could be.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. No other no man.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; No other person.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; But only Christ.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That could be.
[1:40:56] Amen. So when John saw it,
[1:40:59] John heard the seven thunders.
[1:41:02] When John was about to write it. Amen.
[1:41:05] But he heard a voice
[1:41:08] that told him, "Do not write a John.
[1:41:11] Amen. do not reveal this.
[1:41:14] Amen. This is preserved.
[1:41:17] Amen. To that seventh messenger.
[1:41:20] Amen. So John when he was writing the
[1:41:23] book of the of the revelation
[1:41:26] when he was writing the book of the of
[1:41:29] the seventh seal.
[1:41:31] Amen. John could only write what he saw.
[1:41:35] Amen. Remember in Revelation chapter 6.
[1:41:40] Amen. Verse one.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says here,
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; "And I saw when the when the lamb open
[1:41:48] one of the seals,
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; and I heard as he were the noise of
[1:41:54] thunder."
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; No, you jumped verse verse one. And I
[1:42:01] saw when the lamb opened one of the
[1:42:04] seals,
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; and I heard as he were the noise of the
[1:42:10] thunder of thunder.
[1:42:13] Oh, sorry. One of the four beasts
[1:42:15] saying, "Come and see."
[1:42:21] Amen. John heard the voice.
[1:42:25] Amen. Of a of thunder.
[1:42:28] Amen. Then
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; one of the one of the beasts, one of the
[1:42:32] four beasts,
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; amen, told him to come and see.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; So John did both. He saw
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; and he heard, but was only allowed
[1:42:47] to ride what he saw.
[1:42:50] Amen. And what did John see?
[1:42:53] Amen. John saw the the horse rider.
[1:42:58] That was what John saw.
[1:43:01] And that's what he wrote.
[1:43:03] Amen. And I saw, and behold, a white
[1:43:06] horse.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; And he that sat on it had a bow,
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; and a crown was given unto him,
[1:43:15] and he went forth conquering and and to
[1:43:18] conquer.
[1:43:20] Amen. So John heard,
[1:43:23] heard the thunder. And now what is a
[1:43:26] thunder?
[1:43:27] A thunder is a voice of God.
[1:43:31] Amen. A thunder is a voice of God.
[1:43:35] When God was giving the laws to Moses,
[1:43:39] Amen. Moses was receiving the ten
[1:43:40] commandments.
[1:43:43] When God was speaking the first
[1:43:44] commandment,
[1:43:46] I am the Lord thy God.
[1:43:49] When Moses heard, I am the Lord thy God.
[1:43:53] But the people who were stubborn
[1:43:56] because they didn't want to hear from
[1:43:58] Moses.
[1:44:00] Amen. But they wanted to take the place
[1:44:01] of the prophet.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; When Moses brought them to that
[1:44:06] mountain,
[1:44:08] everything they could hear.
[1:44:10] Amen. Was thunders
[1:44:13] lightnings
[1:44:15] loud trumpets.
[1:44:17] They couldn't understand what it was.
[1:44:21] So only Moses
[1:44:23] was able to hear
[1:44:26] Amen. The voice. Amen. All the symbols.
[1:44:30] Amen. Was able to hear. Amen. I
[1:44:33] understand what those thunders were.
[1:44:36] Amen. Was the voice of God.
[1:44:39] Amen. God speaking, "Amen." In John
[1:44:42] chapter 12,
[1:44:44] I believe verse 33.
[1:44:46] Amen. When Jesus said,
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; "Amen, now it's time to glorify." It
[1:44:51] said that glorify my uh I don't I don't
[1:44:54] have it memorized. Let me let me read it
[1:44:56] for you. John 12:23.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says that and and Jesus
[1:45:03] answered them saying,
[1:45:06] "The hour has come.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; The son of man should be glorified."
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if we jump,
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 27,
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "And now is my soul
[1:45:19] troubled.
[1:45:21] And what shall I say?
[1:45:24] Save me from this hour.
[1:45:27] For this cause
[1:45:29] came I unto this hour.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Father glorify thy name.
[1:45:35] Then came father glor father glorify thy
[1:45:39] name.
[1:45:41] Then came a voice from heaven
[1:45:45] saying, "I have both glorified
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; and will glorified."
[1:45:52] Amen. That is what the voice from heaven
[1:45:54] said.
[1:45:56] But the people that were with Jesus,
[1:46:00] the people that stood by
[1:46:03] and heard it, they said it thundered.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when Jesus heard it, I was as
[1:46:11] clear
[1:46:13] as day.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Father glorify glorified
[1:46:19] glorified
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; and I'll glorify it again.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So a thunder,
[1:46:25] Amen. is nothing but the voice of God.
[1:46:28] Amen. So when John saw
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; when John heard
[1:46:33] a thunder,
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the the the the elders the one
[1:46:39] of the elders told him
[1:46:42] to come see
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; and what he saw.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw symbols.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; That's why John wrote symbols.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. The seven seals. Amen. John only
[1:46:55] wrote what he saw.
[1:46:58] Amen. When Daniel heard the seven
[1:46:59] thunders
[1:47:02] and he wanted to write it down, the
[1:47:04] angel told him not to write
[1:47:07] because this was revealed.
[1:47:10] Because this had to be revealed
[1:47:13] at this time. Amen. For you and me.
[1:47:18] Amen. To give us the rapturing face.
[1:47:22] Amen. To bring the bride closer to him.
[1:47:26] This did not come to bring confusion.
[1:47:30] Amen. But he came to bring us closer to
[1:47:32] him.
[1:47:34] Amen. I think time is way past.
[1:47:39] Amen. I wasn't able to teach what I
[1:47:41] wanted. I preaching.
[1:47:46] I hope everything was clear.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Next time we will start now on the
[1:47:53] the seven seals.
[1:47:57] Amen. Starting from the first
[1:48:00] explaining
[1:48:01] the voice of those symbols.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. What John saw.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. The first horse rider.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the prophet was was
[1:48:11] revealing.
[1:48:13] Amen. He says that that's Antichrist.
[1:48:16] Amen. That's the first the first horse
[1:48:18] rider. Amen. Was a white horse.
[1:48:22] Amen. to be confused with the white
[1:48:24] horse from Revelation 19
[1:48:28] [Music]
[1:48:29] because people think that's Christ in in
[1:48:32] Revelation chapter 6.
[1:48:35] Amen. But that is not Christ. Amen.
[1:48:38] Christ is a white horse in Revelation
[1:48:40] 191.
[1:48:44] Amen. You will say that he has no name.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has no name.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; He has he has no name. He has been given
[1:48:53] a crown.
[1:48:55] Amen. That he couldn't wear. Amen. He
[1:48:58] has a He has a He has an arc.
[1:49:02] Amen. But he doesn't have the bow
[1:49:07] flesh.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. All of these were
[1:49:10] symbols.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; And those symbols,
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; they mean something.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; They have a meaning.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God just did not God God
[1:49:22] does not write things just like that.
[1:49:25] Amen. All of these have meanings. Amen.
[1:49:28] Because of time, we won't be able to go
[1:49:29] through all of this.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh uh let me read one last
[1:49:36] quote and then uh we'll close with this.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the first seal,
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; paragraph 146, prophet says to you.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; I wanted to explain what uh why John
[1:50:03] wept.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh Amen. These are these are
[1:50:13] some good stuff.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's hard to stop. Amen. When I
[1:50:19] was uh studying this all night, I was
[1:50:21] studying this.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I stayed up all night. I did not
[1:50:24] even sleep.
[1:50:27] Amen. And when I went to work and now
[1:50:28] all the tiredness started out hitting
[1:50:32] but when I was studying this, it was
[1:50:34] able to keep me up.
[1:50:37] Amen. Because this brings this brings
[1:50:40] Amen. Amen. It's it's the wine and the
[1:50:42] oil.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. It brings stimulation.
[1:50:47] Amen. When you hear the word of God
[1:50:49] revealed to you,
[1:50:52] Amen. It brings stimulation.
[1:50:54] Amen. It makes you want to shout. It
[1:50:56] makes you want to dance.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He makes you want to say
[1:50:59] hallelujah and praise the Lord.
[1:51:04] Amen. Amen. And by the grace of God,
[1:51:06] we're just going to stop here.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; And if God's will next time, we'll go
[1:51:12] through it again.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Senior
[1:51:30] Roger.

[1:51:59] with you.

[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. because we have an understanding
[1:52:14] of of what's happening today.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; And so we're not in the dark. We're
[1:52:18] children of light.

[1:52:27] for the sacrifice of our brother.
