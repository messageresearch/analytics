taking too much time let's go straight to the word let's turn to First Peter read verse one um chapter 1 verse3 First Peter 1 verse 13 the Bible says wherefore G up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you and the revelation of Jesus Christ amen Let's uh turn to Philippians chapter 4 we read the verse 8 and verse 9 Philippians 4:8 and verse 9 ammen the Bible says that finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatso ever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these [Music] [Music] things amen uh uh verse 9 he says those things which he have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do yes and uh uh and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you amen amen let's B heads father God we thank you Lord for your Lord we just pray father God that you be with us Lord this Lord we we we we thank you Father for everything Lord you you've been good to us Lord you protected us father God and Lord here we are in your presence father Lord we just pray father God that you take us out of the way and you speak to your people Lord Lord I pray that you help me to be so sensitive to the to the Holy Spirit oh God lord so that I can only say what you want me to say father lordess the heart that will hear the word and take control of everything Lord in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen amen you may be seated amen uh this evening we have a little subject that we wanted to share with you amen that we entitle it a No Man's Land a No Man's Land amen because uh um a No Man's a no man's land is a land that is unoccupied amen it's a land that doesn't belong to anybody amen because back in the old back in the ancient world Amen when two countries or two uh regions were fighting against each other amen this the fights were not taking place in the City where everybody lives amen they weren't choosing a place amen that's where will be fighting and that place was called a no man's land so they could fight and destroy that land it wouldn't hurt anybody so by God's grace tonight we will try to talk about this amen because uh if you read the prophet I believe in the message uh the greatest battle ever fought or uh the conflict between Christ and Satan he says that the first battle that started was in heaven amen he called it an Angelic battle it was between Angels Lucifer and Michael yeah and and then and then when that that battle when Lucifer was kicked out of heaven he came down on Earth he took that Angelic battle made it a human battle human battle and the place he chose to have those battles amen it's our mind that's why the prophet called our mind in no man's land doesn't belong to anybody so meaning that the devil can come and bring thought amen the devil can come and bring anything that he wants amen and God also can come and bring thoughts so our mind is always in constant battle we only on Earth we only have two influences we are either influenced by Heavens or we influenced by by Satan by hell so the one that will win it's the one that you will listen to like the brother I believe the brother or sister that came to brother brandham he say brother brandham in me I feel like there's two dogs fighting constantly fighting and one is White and the other one is dark and and they're constantly fighting opposite to each other amen so I don't know which one will win and the prophet looked at him and he said that the one that will win is the one that will that you will feed the most because the devil devil can come and bar our minds and give our minds any type of thoughts that he want the only way to give him the victory it will be for you to stop and to listen to him it will be for you to stop and to pay attention to whatever he's saying amen here the prophet says in the greatest battle every F par 75 it says that if this church right now could be put [Music] together and neither together with such that every person will be in one Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere he says that there will not be a feeble person in our there will not be a feble person in our MS in the in another five minute there will not be nobody here Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would receive it if you could just get that certain thing fixed now there is where the battle begins right in your mind it said that it said that whether you will uh and I just stop there so that's where that's where the battle begins it's in your mind if you even if you go to the Natural you go to the military the way they train amen you see that they train their physical body and they also train the mental the Mind amen because they know that the the quickest way to break someone with your Minden you can't be tortured somebody will endure torture and it will not break when you with the Mind usually it's quicker than than physical torture the mind your mind is a gate to everything your mind is a door that opens everything your mind is a door that will open doubt that will let in doubt that will let in faith your mind your mind is a door that will let him fear that will let in Joy and Pain and everything amen he will let in fear Faith amen that's the tactic that the devil used if we go to uh uh Genesis chapter 3 amen here's the uh the the conversation between the serpent and and and Eve amen here if you read this this chapter that we're about to read here you'll understand that when the serpent went to Eve the serpent did not misquote the word the serpent did not try to change the word or or to to to to to say something that was contrary to the word what he tried to do what he did amen he tried it pushed if to start thinking about what God Said start reasoning about the word Prophet says that the very same moment that you start reasoning about the word at that moment that you lose your faith it's at that moment that doubt start to to get in amen Genesis chap 3 ver1 the Bible says here that now the serpent was more Sab than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay has God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden amen so here notice that Eve knew the word so if the devil if Satan just came and then misquoted the word she would have picked up on that saying that this is not what Adam has taught me and this is not what God has said amen so here the Devil comes and then say that you shall not eat of every tree of the [Music] garden asking her as a question amen but that was the very same thing that God told them eat of every fruit of every tree of the garden but except for this one the the one with the knowledge of of evil and good and evil so here the devil the the serpent is trying to check and see if Eve knows her word now in verse two she answers back and she said that the Bible say and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of every fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die here in verse one he stated the same thing but he kind of questioned [Music] it amen so now verse 2 and three the woman with all boldness and the word that she knew and she quoted that very quick so now verse four the Bible says that and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die amen now he started to make her reason amen but God said that you will die amen he didn't say that he didn't come up straight up and say that you won't dieen he said that you shall not surely die in other words that God meant something else by saying this this is the exact same thing that happens to us now you read the quote of the prophet read something that the prophet has saying because you're not happy with it saying that well the prophet did not mean this Prophet meant this and he meant this other thing amen the word means exactly what it's saying if God says that don't eat it because you will die that means don't eat it you will [Music] die not surely in God's word am he came and he said the serpent says that you shall not surely die Amen in verse five he says that for God does know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as God's knowing good and evil here he's giving a woman that Eve in opportunity to be equal with God God gave you that word because he just want to keep you you know want to keep you blinden he doesn't want you to know everything he doesn't want you to be like him that's why that's why he gave you this word why he's trying to control you he's trying to dictate the way you have to leave he's trying to dictate the way you have to dress he trying to dictate the songs that you have to listen to he's trying to dictate the things that you have to watch is not trying to tell you that if you do this you will be like him amen you will have the same knowledge as him you will be equal to God Amen he gave him that opportunity the woman started reasoning about the word she started reasoning about everything that she knew and the same moment that we start reasoning about the word we start losing our faith we don't believe 100% anymore amen it's like you go to the doctor you know very well the Bible says that by your stps I'm Healed let's say that you go to a church and somebody gave a prophecy or something about your sickness amen and then you go to the doctor the doctor say that well this is getting worse amen you only have a week life to leave so now the choice will be up to you are you either going to take God's word or the doctor's word very same moment you decide to take the doctor's word at that moment you started losing your faith because you brought in reasoning the doctors has you know as more as experience he has all those machines and everything and you know he can prove that the cancer is gone it's worse but but what I have it's only this word I don't know if I if it was really for me or for some somebody else maybe God wants me to take this pill and I will be healed or maybe that propy or that word means that I have to go through this surgery the same the very same moment you start bringing the reasoning amen you start that same moment you start you be welcoming your defeat Amen in verse six the Bible says that and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree and the tree to be desired to be desired to make one wise she took the fruit she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband and he did itat amen she s that the fruit was good was good for food even though God told them not to eat it amen but reasoning brought something else amen because you also we can also you also I can have faith in the what the devil is saying the devil will bring you to have faith in his word the same thing that he the same thing he did with Eve God said not to eat it but he went and he saw he show Eve how the food was good the the fruit was good for food and the B said that and the tree to be desired to make one wise God never asked us to be wise about about about about his word God never asked us to to to try to even understand the word amen he asked us to believe amen he asked us to believe amen not to reason Amen to say that well this is not worth it's not you know it's not sounding good or bad or whatever you reason you can come up with am God ask us to believe the word amen and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sued uh uh uh fig leaves together and made them and made themselves up Amen to cover the nudity cover that shame that they had amen because one person decided to stop and to listen to the devil one person decided to stop amen and to doubt the word of God amen the doubt on on one word of God one word amen brought the fall to the human race amen that's what Paul says to have your mind GED up amen with the word uh where's the first Peter amen he says that First Peter chapter 1 verse verse 13 He said that g up the Lo of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you by the revelation of Jesus Christ G up the loins of your mind and the only way to do that is with the word of God amen that's why God gave us his word amen as the best attack amen that's the only way you have to overcome the devil that's the only way you will have to overcome Temptation only way you have to overcome that battle the word of God so why did he give us the word of God because the word of God is etal and the word of God is himself if he overcame the devil up there in heaven amen and he gave us himself amen so that with that word amen we will still overcome the same devil the prophet says now let's diagnose that down amen like the chemistry of the blood or the chemistry of water he said why did he give the word he said that the word is eternal see and if God made a promise that is [Music] eternal and there is nothing nowhere can stop it that turn every every atom upside up upside down they turn every every Adam upside down and and and turn it backwards and could never pierce the word of God one little word see Jesus said both heavens and earth will pass away but word shall never fail that's the best weapon there is the word of the Eternal God now what is the word of God the word of God is God himself God gave the believer himself God himself he gave the believer himself to attack the Enemy by in other words his father and the word is God in other word his father and the word is God then the word is our father we're born by the word and he's standing that we're born by the word and he's standing in the Forefront for his children amen there you are am standing out there for his children what are we scared about amen the Rapture is sure the coming is sureen every blessing that's been promised is ours you take the word with you if you open your mind to the word of God open your mind to his promises will make the rupture sure he will make every promises sure he will make make every every word in the Bible sure for you amen we have to open our minds to his word amen stop listening to the devil amen stop listening to the to the black the black dog amen keep on feding your mind with the word of God your mind the word of God and he will start reacting by itself the devil will bring one thought and right the way the scripture will come to you if you if you have your if you have the your mind you know filled with the word of God because the devil knows that that's the way he takes the children of God it doesn't matter how many words how many scriptures you can quote it doesn't matter how many how many quotes of the Bible of the Prophet you know he knows that our mind amen is the Gateway of everything the prophet brother Brandon when he lost his wife and and his daughter the devil try the way the way the devil was trying to to to have him doubt the word he was with reasoning the devil knew very well that he wouldn't come to brother Bram said that God doesn't care for you God wasn't real amen but what he tried to doen he's trying to show brother Bram that God doesn't care for him trying to show him how God took his wife amen how God took his daughter brother bam certainly prayed for for for for his family for both of them amen I'm pretty sure maybe he fasted amen he gave his all amen but the devil came and said that look God did not even listen to your prayers God doesn't care for you amen he was trying to get him through his mind amen but he had the word of God with him he had the word of God to fight back the only way to overcome word because the prophet said that he's got to come in your mind and you have to accept it amen it can't B it can't B again against you amen but he can't get to you until you accept it when Satan walked up to Eve said you know the fruit is Pleasant she stepped for a moment and and that's when she made a mistake she stopped for a moment so when those mind when those mind were when those uh mind battles will be coming to you amen don't stop not even for a second because it's something that comes to everyone it doesn't matter how spiritual you are it doesn't matter how filled with the Holy Spirit you are the devil will always come to your mind to do the same thing with Jesus him who is the creator of everything am who created the heavens and earth but the devil came and tried to make him doubt this word at first he tried to make him create turn the stone to a bread to make Him worship Him amen that was in the beginning of his ministry and then at the end of his ministry he's trying to be came and trying to show him how painful it was to go through the cross trying to show him the better way to handle this you can only drink from the cup if you can only there is another way to do it you don't have to go through it if it try if he was he dared to go to God to Jesus Christ himself to try to make him doubt his own words what about you and me are battles that we go through every day same moment you wake up the devil will come with his first attack the the prophet said that he can batter amen I looked at that word batter in the dictionary dictionary it says that to strike repeatedly with hard [Music] blows amen so meaning that the devil will keep on striking he will not rest he will keep on trying he will keep on giving you thought that you not saved you don't have the holy spirit amen Look to You sin yesterday amen God doesn't love you God doesn't care for you if God cared for you you wouldn't have gone through this uh uh this journey if God cared for you amen he would have given you all your prayers if God cared for you would have heed Your Body by now if God cared for you would have saved your [Music] wife that's the tactic of the devil he will come every day every moment the prophet said that repeatedly with hards Amen to try to get you to to accept it and the only way to give him Victory if you do like Eve you stop for a moment that will be the biggest mistake of your life to stop and to listen to him am so every time he comes because we know that he will come amen even right now amen the devil will come amen trying to bring you different thoughts keep you distracted but you always have to have the word of God with you have to fight him back because the word of God is your Fortress so you stay with the word that's the only way to overcome amen the devil will come to you and say that you don't have the holy spirit amen you know very well that you had an experience with God you know very well that God gave you the holy spirit amen but he will come to you and say that you don't have it amen amen amen I received the Holy Spirit when I was 17 amen but when I moved to the US amen that transition was a little hard on me amen so the devil kept on coming to me and say that you're not saved and you don't have the holy spirit amen he he he get me for he got me for a while amen amen I kept on coming to different prayer lines and asking for the Holy Spirit and it's amen he kept on saying that well look you're not even you know you're not the same as you used to be and and look where you are now and look what you're doing and and everything amen so when we went to we went to the camp Louisiana Camp it was with Lis Paul's friend Nathan so at that time the devil was constantly coming to me and saying that you don't you're not saved and you don't have the Holy Spirit so I went with that camp I went to that camp I was like Lord I just need something from you to show me that I have it and I will stop I won't come anymore asking for it amen so it happens that uh uh uh Nate L Paul's brother L Paul's friend amen uh uh God was working through him amen so when he went to the prayer line after that couple you know couple young Brothers started praying for that for that brother and he started the devil start you know those Spirit started talking through him man the spirit you know that do devils and and Spirits started talking through him and some people in the church when they were praying they started having conversation with him so it wasn't him technically talking but it was those Spirits inside of him responding amen so after that you know the church P they prayed and we thought that you know he was delivered and everything so on our way back to uh to our rooms am man those same Spirits came back on him and he started acting up and throwing the Bible and and and and you know acting up weird amen so we weren't there with our mentors with our Mentor uh uh I believe they're called counselors or something so he made him sit amen and then he asked him that what are you seeing in my eyes what are you seeing in me he replied back and said that you know I he couldn't even look at his eyes and he replied back and said that I'm seeing Fire coming out of you amen then he looked at him again and he said that you know look at everyone here surrounding you and tell me who is your friend amen so when he asked that question am I knew very well what I was going through the devil kept on sing me that hey you don't have the Holy Spirit and you're not filled and what you have whatever experience you had was FAL and blah blah blah the scripture in the Bible where it says that Paul we know Jesus we know Paul we know about you you don't we don't know you amen that very that scripture came to me that at that same moment and I was like oh Lord you know I'm about to be exposed right now man I was like well cuz the Bible says that you know the devil knows who are here so he'll be to point at me and say that you know this this one is my friend wow I was like well I'm about to be exposed I started shaking up a little bit so then he he looked at all of us it was me uh Le gel and John believe couple Brothers amen he looked at every one of us like from the from his left to his right and then he looked at that brother he said that I'm not seeing my friend here then then then right the way a peace came to my heart and I was like wow the devil you are you are a liar [Music] gave you an opportunity to expose or to tell me if if I don't really have the Holy Spirit but you you did you said that you're not seeing your friend here don't and says that and say that I'm not filled with the holy spirit anymore and from that time on am man the devil has never came never come came back and try to say that I don't have the Holy Spirit this amen amen because he will start with your mind first the prophet says that don't reason believe amen no matter the circumstances don't pay attention to circumstances you just believe amen don't reason believe no matter what the circumstances don't pay attention to it you just believe amen close your mind to your five senses amen close your mind to your sense of taste see smell touch and hear and everything as long as those senses are not lining up with the word you close your mind to them amen don't pay attention to them you've been prayed for amen even though your body is not feeling like it stop praising God Amen be like Abraham amen God gave him the word his body did not feel young at the same the same moment sah body didn't become young overnight Abraham did not stop to listen to whatever they were saying the devil came through the devil came to Abraham through Sarah trying to give him atitude Abraham maybe God did not say that you only have to have that kid with me take the servant man you will still have you still have hair you still have a child amen amen people neighbors certainly they were saying but well Abra it's been 20 years since you said that God talked to you about where is the kid did not stop but he kept on believing against all hope amen against against all against all reasoning all odd words were against him he kept on believing God say it and that settles it and I believe it amen God said it amen I don't know when I'm going to have that kid why that promise will come to pass but I know one thing God said it and I believe it amen I don't have to understand iten it doesn't have to make sense to me I don't have to know how to explain it to you first of all I don't have to explain it to you because when God talked to me he talked to me personally did not talk to you or God did not tell me to go explain it to people he asked me to believe his word that's what I'm doing amen it doesn't matter what the devil will come it doesn't matter what thought the devil will try to bring in me what God Said Amen and I believe it and I'm sticking with it the prophet said that but after you become a Christian then you are fortified with the word by the word and any promise in the Worden he said that I didn't know that I was going to say that see when you become a Christian you're placed behind the word of God there is your Fortress safety your safety oh my every promise in that is yours only thing you have to do is just reach and get it and go right on with it amen how you know it's going to work I don't know I don't know how it's going to work explain to me I don't know only thing I know that God gave his children the best attack that they could have and the best thing to attack with because he knows we work With the [Music] Enemy amen he knows he knows the working of the enemy he knows that he always come to through our mind amen so he gave us a best attack that is the word of God Amen you just have to stand behind it let the word of God Build That Wall of safety the word of God Be Your Shield amen you're the shield of the word and stand behind it every thought of the devil will hit that shield and return won be to pierce you because you built the shield of the word so the reason why people have doubt is because they don't know where they're standing amen I read the last one last quote of the Prophet here in the message the images of Christ paragraph 31 it says that I and I believe that before anybody can ever move or have a real confidential faith [Music] he say first they have to know where they stand and how to stand after they make their stand I believe that's essential for you cannot just head long head long plunge into something long into something with when you don't know where you plunging amen you've got to know and if our faith is set right and in the right position it gives a constant satisfaction amen you have to know where you standing amen and if your faith is set right in the right position it gives a constant satisfaction amen it's like that woman that was losing blood amen she was losing blood for years amen she went to different doctors the bible say that she used up all her money amen and people certainly were saying that she did something and and was she was paying back whatever she did was the consequences of her life or something people named her you know gave her names and and called her names and and so forth amen I was sitting one day and trying to think about that verse amen she was losing blood you know for months I mean for years amen but look at look at now if you come to the Natural amen amen somebody who's losing blood for for for years amen first of all that person is not strong enough that person would not have strength amen so Jesus when Jesus was passing by amen Jesus was not near her amen and to get to Jesus she first had to go through the crowd which means that it wasn't something easy normally amen the way the devil Works amen first of all he will try to show you all the obstacles that you have to cross devil will try to show you how impossible it is to get whatever you get you trying to get amen but she had her mind in the she opened her mind to the word of God she was standing in the right position she knew where she was standing she knew that that one touch amen was able to save her so whatever the devil was coming to the devil was putting in her mind ignored everything amen and she started to break through amen because faith will break through every barriers it doesn't matter how thick that barrier is amen your faith will break through it amen your faith will break through it you just know what you have Fai in you just know what you believing in amen and with that your faith will help you to break through it you will be like Joshua and Caleb they went to that City where God told them to go they saw how milk and honey was flowing how beautiful that city was when they came back with the report other people were scared amen other people start reasoning well we know that God told us that we go through it but look at the fact amen here you have Giants amen and we not you know we're not even seen you know compared to them so how are we going to fight how are we going to fight how are we going to overcome amen they stopped and listen to the devil amen they stopped and they let the Satan have control over their mind that was the mistake that they made that was the same mistake that the devil that Eve made amen was to stop and to listen to the to the serpent amen that's what the devil will always do to you Amen in Philippians 4: 8 and 9 we read this in the beginning amen the Bible said that finally and finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think of those [Music] things amen that's the key for us to to have victory over our mind think on those things amen whatsoever things are true amen we know that the entire Bible is true amen whatsoever things are honest amen God is always honest amen if he gives you a word amen he will have to accomplish it it will have to come it will have to make it will have to make it pass amen whatsoever things are pure amen the word of God is pure amen whatsoever things are lovely amen the word of God is lovely the more you read it and the more you know you get in love with it and the you know the sweeter you becomes whatsoever things are of good of of of good report the word of God the Bible is filled with good report there any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things Amen Let It Be Your every the thought of your everyday life think about the word every day of your life morning when you wake up amen think about the word amen at noon think about the word [Music] amen at night before you sleep you will see that that will change you you will no longer have nightmares amen you will no longer have mind battles that will go for that will go on forever you will have victory in everything in your prayers all your prayers will come will be you know God will hear your prayers and it will come to pass amen because he says here that those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me it says that do those things and the God of Peace shall be with you amen the God of Peace will will fight your battles because the greatest battle that would the the greatest battle ever fought it's in your mind amen that battle started in heaven amen it came down on Earth amen it's happening in your mind your mind no man's land amen amen it doesn't belong to anybody amen but the the thing that will occupy your mind amen is the thing that you will feed it with amen that's why that's why back in in the early '90s I think 1950s amen people starting to create uh how do you call it um uh the ads amen and the way to do it to make people buy their product amen they were sending subliminal messages amen something that you won't be able to see with your eyes but it will go straight to your mind to your subconscious and it will make you act you know the way they want you to act that's the way the devil controls the word the devil controls the world that's the way the devil get to influence everybody when you listen to a song or watch something he knows where to put those messages you won't be able to see it go through straight to your mind and it'll make you act crazy that's the reason you have many shootings the shootings amen that's the reason why you have many things happening in the word people are not understanding why they're doing it because the devil knows how to get to you Dev knows how to take control of your body amen so if by listening to his things amen if by watching his things amen he's able to take control of your body amen so what about reading the word of God listening to the word of God every day amen that will allow God to also take control of your body whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things of of are just think of that amen think about the word every dayen and you will have victory over everything amen God bless you [Applause] we just be briefly but I really want to thank the Lord for the word it truly spoke to my soul truly was a blessing and you know one thing for certain God knows how to expose the enemy so we appreciate our brother for listening to the word
