are gone and when i meet the scoffers who ask me where [Music] as far removed as darkness is from god oh in the sea of god's forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise my god are gone [Music] but the old time altar where god came in my heart and now my sins are gone the lord took full position the devil did depart i'm glad my sins are gone where are they oh they're underneath the blood of the

in the sea of god forgetfulness that's good enough for me [Music] [Music] amen surely god is good to us and we thank the lord jesus christ for being here thank god for our brother lunga being here in the service he and his church we appreciate your coming brother amen always welcome always we know that uh we're living in the last days amen and we're such a blessed people um we're just gonna get right into the word of god i was searching for a song but nothing came to mind but we thank god for the musicians and song leader all of you um we we know that god is god and we must understand our identity with him he's just not an idol or something far off that can be reached or touched is uh since the seals have been open and we're now living and standing in the face of an open book where god is revealing his secrets to his bride i am so happy about that uh because i realize amen that without him will be stuck just like everybody else because the bible says without a vision of people perish and brother branham didn't just come to give us our words of excellency he literally gave us a vision an image by god's grace he gave us a word that now we can press toward because amen we realize amen that we're not just a church we are called the bride and we know according to what the prophet said uh we must be just like him and not one of us can add a cubit to us our statute but we do know the man who can as we stand let us turn to colossians 2 and 9. we're going to read there colossians 2 9 and then we'll read first john 5 11. colossians 2 9. and it reads for him him dwelleth all the fullness of the head bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power john first john 5 1st john 5. first john 5 we're going to read the 11th verse and this is the record that god has given us given to us eternal life and this life is in his son let us pray heavenly father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us surely you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves and lord there is one thing we can do and that's thank you and praise you for all that you've done for us lord as our days flow forward we realize oh god everything is still controlled by you and we ask in your name lord jesus that you remember us as we said not that you can forget lord but the promises that you promised that would happen to us in this day we ask you to perform it oh god granted in your name jesus christ we pray amen you may see that you know i thought about this subject the other day and i was listening to a message as always um basically that's where i get most of my inspiration from and uh i thought about the subject the truth of life it has been hidden from millions of people throughout the ages so many people died thinking that they had life there were those who like ponce de leon who searched for the fountain of youth literally there was something crying out in man uh because he realized that this could not be it you're born today and died tomorrow there's got to be more to it than this we see by god's grace how god breathed in the nostrils of adam the bible said adam became a living soul i like to say this today we had a wonderful service the other day last weekend and i mean many people were touched by the lord the holy spirit really came into the place uh but when you think about the holy ghost and receiving the holy ghost you must understand it's just the beginning when we were in the pentecostal system in the pentecostal world and and we some of us may have spoken in tongues and some of us may have may have shouted or whatever the case may be we all thought that was it for the moment but when we saw that there wasn't a change let me tell you something i don't care what your experiences are what they you know what you encounter in this life when it comes to god when god comes he changes and i thank god for the prophet of god because he made us know that satan was the most evil thing that exists in this age uh not that i'm in that age anymore but this age called laodicea is the most wicked and most evil age ever it's the darkest thank god for the lord pulling us out of that uh but one thing that we feel and we understand is that life is comes back to one person and that's god jesus christ the lord jesus christ is the only life and the reason why he is life is because elohim embodies him amen throughout the time of history and through the time of israel we realize hey man they they were a chosen people and life to them was behind a veil they never did come to see what the real life was about and uh you know it's a sad to say because you know the rituals of their of their ceremonies became a system and there was a time when they thought that that if god wasn't behind the veil i mean with the fire burning that god wasn't with them and that's why they were so easily deterred and easily persuaded by the enemy to do devilish things but let me say it like this god sees all paul described him as all and in all paul said you know when i i live i breathe i walk i talk everything i do is in him amen and so there's really no way to get rid of god i laugh at that because some people think that because they disbelieve that they're getting rid of god or because they want to say god doesn't exist they're getting rid of god that that is a nonsense and it's a real trick of the devil because at the end of the day all of us got to face him one thing i love about this god there is nothing impossible think about the most impossible thing that you think a good thing that god can't do he can do it we have a record you know when jesus christ was on earth he just didn't you know walk around and and did nothing his whole life was uh to express the invisible god father i come to do thy will and we understand that we as christians those of us who are part of the bride how long have we we went through life thinking that throughout our christian walk we had to hope but i hope i'm saved i hope i make the rapture i hope and we did not realize that the rapture in itself was tangible something that you could hold for yourself we didn't understand the mystery of it and what's going on now until the god to the lord opened the seven seals amen to the almighty angel of revelation 10 came down there was a change there was a a real change god was rocking leila to see her to speak and at the same time he was smiting or smitten a bride was being smitten out of her come out of her my people a new journey a time that you and i are now experiencing because we've never gone this way before amen like i said the other day it was time out for the black and white dog jesus said you make the tree either good or you make it evil there's not this is not the time of the tree of knowledge of good and evil god want either good or evil [Music] there's only one way to make that tree good is to have the good god on the inside [Music] paul says according to acts 17 28 for in him we live and move and have our beings as certain also your poets have have said for we are also his offspring if that don't choke or intellectual nothing will how can you and i be the offspring of god we would have never known amen not in pentecost not in the baptist methodist or anything we did not know our relationship with god even though we said we were sons and daughters of god we never seen ourselves as amateur god or messiahs or messiahs you know what i mean but in this day god unveiled the word to the bride of jesus christ and i want to say this to the young people those of you who have not experienced the holy ghost it's beyond anything you could imagine but it's just the beginning of it it gets sweeter as the days go by when you really grab a hold to this message then you become such a free entity you become such a free man or free woman you begin to hear directly from god yes he talks to you a brother said the other day and i told him i was going to use this he said being a christian is not an extracurricular activity yeah some people think that though being a christian i'll be a christian on sunday i'll be a christian on wednesday you know what i mean but being a christian is not some activity it is life it is not like a group or society no it's nothing like that it's you being as our brother said the housing of god the tabernacle of god and god living through you expressing himself for this day i'm not talking about yesterday i'm talking about today what are you to be today the word expressed brother branham said in the church age book and men of that age and he was talking about the philadelphian age but i want you to listen to what he says because i want you to understand that jesus christ is god hello he is god and you'll find a lot of theologians that will argue with you the bible said he's so much god that the heaven and earth is named after him the whole family of god there's more to that there's more to that but we didn't understand the relationship but paul said we're the offspring and the bible said as he is so are we in this world amen right now oh people could understand let me tell you something no drugs no cigarettes no lust or any sexual activity could ever bring you up to the place where god when god baptizes you with the holy ghost i don't come they can come with crack crack crack and it still won't work still could never measure up to what jesus christ gives you he takes you to another level as i've been saying recently he takes you to a new dimension he says and as the jews took refuge in the synagogues form of worship so in the philadelphian age they were think taking refuge in the church he says it is not the joining a church that counts oh i belong to the message that means nothing it's no different to say i'm baptist i'm messing this i'm pentecostal i'm holiness it means nothing amen amen it's not joining a church that counts the life is not in the church the life is in christ this is the record that god has given to us eternal life and this life is in his son amen he that hath the son hath life and he that have not the son of god hath not life man is made holy by the spirit amen capital s it is the spirit of holiness that raised jesus from the dead that indwells us and makes us holy with his holiness that's right y'all understand that so you got to have the holy ghost in order to be holy you can't be holy on your own and the devil said you don't need that that's in the days go by all i know is god came to restore you can't jump all the way up to the headstone and not be justified you can't jump all the way up to the headstone and not be sanctified you can't jump all the way up to the uh headstone without the holy ghost and brother branham said then the holy ghost makes room for the holy ghost himself person of jesus christ there he stands the holy one and we will stand with him clothed in righteousness his righteousness holy with his holiness i like that holy with his holiness now this age is the sixth age in the eyes of god time is drawing out now he's talking about philadelphia like i said to our clothes he will soon be coming back soon the cry would go forth as he come and he watched he he did the cry come absolutely at midnight the cry came hallelujah and what was that cry behold the bride coming now i don't understand why people can literally speak that and not tell you when did the bridegroom come it's in the scripture eliza had already told rebecca about isaac gave her gifts and everything and then when rebecca saw isaac in the field she says who is that and when that revelation struck that's the man she leaked brother branham typed that as the rapture and you and i must understand this is a process and when you if you don't fully get into the process of it you will miss it it doesn't matter if you know william branham is a prophet of this age it won't it won't because remember amen when she leaped off of that off that campbell eliza was on the other side she said who is that and elijah said that's my master hallelujah that's my lord hello and when brother branham looked at the cloud he says what that's my lord amen come on just say it amen and you and i must understand that this is a progress a progression this is what makes it such a mystery yeah all right people say well you'll be changing the moment of the twinkling of an eye yeah god quickens you and he changes you and that change brings you what to the full stature of christ and there coming a literal changing from one dimension to another but it's always in his own time now he said and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still revelation 22 oh i am so glad that my holiness is not of myself help us jesus would we be in bad shape if our holiness was of ourselves come on not one of us can produce it jesus have mercy y'all i'm trying to hold on to this pool kid because i want you to understand by god's grace this is a beautiful situation that's why i keep saying saints we got to change we can't change on our own but without prayer how can you change brother branham said you have to lay in the presence of the son and what is that that's that message you got to stay there and let that message break off they call that greenery out of here amen you gotta die you gotta rot to all of your thoughts and your ideas so that god amen can make you who you himself in you if that makes sense amen i am so glad my holiness is not of myself i'm glad that i am in christ with all of his wonderful attributes of righteousness imputed yes imparted unto me amen blessed be god forever it's all the grace of god amen take advantage of it don't frustrate the grace of god [Music] amen revelations 4 1 says after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven what door you got to understand the symbols is right right brother branham said that uh revelation is a book of symbols and you know i've always you know envisioned this big door being opened let me tell you what the door is jesus himself he says i am the door right i am the door and that door was open in heaven what the seals were broken jesus christ himself began to unveil himself to us and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which says come up hither and i will show the things that must be hereafter and it you know i i've said this uh uh many a time you know in our economize we'll never understand the message and it takes more than intellectual reading it takes more than taking this point and this point and this point and putting it all together it might look good it might sound good but how do you know it's right because the bride of jesus christ stand with the revelation of god you literally believe the word the way it is but then god reveals to you what it is yes that's right in three days he said i'll destroy this temple and raise it up and his false witnesses said he said the very thing he said well he said in three days i'll destroy this temple and raise it up and the bible called on false witnesses because they did not have the revelation of the truth revelations 4 2 says what and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne amen not three one amen god is one amen thank god for the mystery right you say well what do you mean every bride of jesus christ millions of people will be in heaven during that day and guess what he'll still be one amen he'll still be one why because she will be him and he will be her it's the truth father i pray that they will be one even as we are one you can't even fathom it you can't even fathom it that god would take a sinner such as i and turn his life into bliss oh my god he was in the in the spirit of the lord day and you know it's amazing jesus is god yes i keep saying that i'm saying that for a reason just a minute saint john 14 6 says jesus said unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me in other words he was the gateway he was the doorway and like i said to you amen those gates that jesus walked through on the day of resurrection he was the only voice that could open that gate amen amen his body his character it meant everybody that was flowing from behind him would have never gotten into the gate until he answered amen let me say it like this the same key that opened up the gate then is the same key that opens up the gate later amen without the carrick of jesus christ you won't make it lord help our souls because it's so so late in the evening as i said jesus christ is god now that is the revelation brother balaam said according to the exposition of the seven churches he says listen now this is the revelation jesus christ is god the jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new no matter how hard you try you can't prove there are three gods but it's also take a revelation by the holy spirit to make you understand the truth that he is one it takes a revelation to see that jehovah of the old testament is the jesus of the new satan crept into the church and blinded the people to the truth and when they were blinded to it it wasn't long until the church of rome stopped baptizing in the name of the lord jesus christ that's right you see once you're blind you go off you can't see now you're presuming and assuming but when your eyes are opened and later see it was blind you know and jesus said anoint your eyes what i said that you might see and for us to even see that god has sent a prophet in this day is a blessing amen oh yes he said i will deliver you on the wings of an eagle oh that's pretty good to me see john revelation sister said one through four says john to the seven churches which is our nature grace be unto you and peace from him which is which was which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before the throne sound like a bunch of gods but it's only one and i love the way he said it because it's just the same way that you know it's written in hebrews but just in a different way but saying the same thing hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ it's the same yesterday today and forever the was the which is in which is to come and jesus christ who is the first is who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins where in his own blood did we just saying that my sins are gone thank god my sins are gone amen john 14 26-27 says but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you amen peace i live with you leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth no matter how many times the world say peace it's never peace he said oh i'm laying home right now i'm just got a peace of mind no you don't unless jesus is in your mind my peace i give unto you not as the world give it thank god yes sir amen i give it unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be what afraid that's when you have peace when your heart is not troubled and you're not afraid the word peace comes from the word shalom and many of us have heard the word shalom shalom a lot of people in the message say that shalom it means to let our minds be one that's the original that's where it started let our minds be one you meet a friend say shalom that means let's bring it together brothers let our minds be one let our minds be united in other words we are one we're not fighting and fussing you know we're not doing that peace is really the oneness of the godhead one of these old days you'll find out where you fit into that ephesians 2 18 22 says for through him we have both have access by the spirit unto the father now therefore ye are no more strangers than foreigners and fellow citizens with the saints scars let me read that now excuse me therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowship fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself what being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly fitly framed together grow it i like that word unto a holy temple in the lord there's growing growth you got to grow but you can't grow if you haven't been born in whom all the buildings fitly framed together groweth unto that's why to tell the people i said if truly we had the holy ghost like the people say they do have we wouldn't have the fussing and fighting that we have all the time we'll have a unity we have one unit with one mind and the devil don't want us to get on one accord because he knows once we get on one accord all things are possible as a church unit in whom you also are built together for the habitation sorry i'm just getting carried away habitation of god through the spirit you mean to tell me i can be the house of god god can abide in me he can abide in you the habitation that's it amen what are we here for we're not leo the sins i'll trust not we've come out of that and if you really are out of that you're in another dimension you caught up into heavenly places in christ jesus the third dimension that we're now living in means nothing to a true believer because we're the true believer all things are possible that's right we're not hindered by time and space amen because the word created it all and conquers it all is that the truth they said what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey amen what are you talking about then god sent us a prophet so that we can see that's the same thing that the bride must come into amen speak to the storm did the snow stop yes sir see what we must understand is that maturing into god brings us into god we begin to express him and you know we we've often thought about it where the bible says let this mind be in you we think it's a second mind there is no second mind your mind must die [Music] amen everything about you must die you must become like brother branham said a hall a shell that god can live in is it anything too hard for god absolutely not we've got to press when we see ourselves failing and faltering where do you go you go down on your knees to god in prayer that's right acknowledge your sins right amen that's the bible amen amen for we that's what ephesians says ephesians 2 10 for we are the workmanship created in christ jesus unto what good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them do you understand that that means you have been ordained to do it not just chosen elected but ordained to do it you will do it you got to do it not one of god's works that he's ordained will ever fall to or fail regardless to who he placed that job on is that right even brother branham thought well what have i done he didn't realize what he had done saw the preview of the bride and saw miss america and saw all those countries come by he thought oh my god but all this preaching is that all we got but then there was a resurrection there was a second coming there was a coming of the bride one more time walking to the word in the tune of the word onward christian soldier martin has to walk hallelujah what did god do comforted him he comforted the prophet of god so that he could see your living has not been in vain amen there's coming one amen right like eliezer told you know uh uh uh like abraham told eliza don't choose no women over here no don't choose none of these folks these people and who don't systemize this message that ain't right you go over there to rebecca brother i'm saying god works on both ends you you go over there over there to the kinsmen keep it in the bloodline amen those who really got the holy ghost those are the ones i want you to connect with you understand me oh come on people that's the truth and rebecca saw ella ease or she she understood her instructions without him even saying it because god had already revealed it to him not only just water the men give them water but also water the camels hallelujah and when she did that hallelujah glory to god he shouted that's the you're the one i'm not going to hate i'm not going to waste no time see and god put it in that girl's heart i'm leaving now see because one thing about the revelation of this message when you really catch it you cut all everything loose all your relatives and all of the things of the past you drop it like a hot cake and you keep the eyes think about the miles they had to ride on a camel and what we don't understand amen those camels probably was packed you know especially going to uh see rebecca that's another message but the point is this message is packed you'll never run out glory to god you love the lord first corinthians 86 says but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and our lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him amen amen think about the second adam yeah the second adam the bible says not only was a quickening spirit but he was the lord from heaven and we realized amen that he had a wife he had a bride hallelujah and her name was where not just in book of life but her name was in the lamb's book of life why because he foresaw her foreknew her before the foundation door brother brown said in this message if you really believe this message you never got saved on any day amen yes you wasn't saved on any day you always were saved you just didn't know it so if you were already saying why do you worry about the devil taking it from you he cannot take it from you because the bible said jesus himself said i've never lost one won't lose one all that the father has given me will come that's the truth some of us take a long time to get there but we'll get there amen yes sir hallelujah amen psalm 63 1-3 you all don't mind oh god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirst is for thee my flesh longest to thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary because brother branham explained that thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee he said he wondered what life what kind of life he's talking about this kind of life this is nothing but he goes on and said your loving kindness is better than this i choose your loving kindness over this [Music] he is all in all amen we're so well protected we you know i i say it like this god loved us so much until he spoiled me you're really spoiled you just don't know it i kind of like it too psalms 91 1-11 says listen i'm gonna read on he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty what this is the message the secret place of the almighty is the message and i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the stairs of the fowl and from the nozzle of pestilence is he a deliverer he's still a deliverer he shall cover thee with the feathers and under his wings shall thou trust amen is that right brother branham said the wings amen of the eagle is the prophet amen the eagle is the prophet oh come on somebody the message you're under amen you're under it he's bearing you on eagle's wings amen stand with the word oh my god i i just get excited sorry thou should not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrows that flyeth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasted at noon day a thousand shall fall at that side then ten thousand shall shall at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made what the lord which is my refuge even the most high dire habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy way every time you slip god picks you up every time you try to go wayward something pushes you back god knows what he's doing amen oh i quit you can't you can't quit god ain't gonna let you quit amen hallelujah like i said the other day we we read that word remember me lord remember me god said he can't forget me but what i need god to do is take the word of this hour and perform it through me or you however you want to put it the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear y'all better hear this and because this is the rapture scripture here oh my brother branham used this message this this scripture psalm 27 1-6 he he he preached a rapture with this so you got to understand tough times coming the lord is my life what are you talking about he's not talking about a light like that i have a revelation of who he is and i have a revelation of who i am like somebody said well he didn't come on 1663 i said well if he didn't who was there knocking on the doors of laying his head and who was there in the meeting when brother branham said he's here amen that's all i'm saying and if he's here he's still here that's right amen hallelujah what has he done he's broken up the fire he's broke the fire into pieces yes amen you got a part i got a part those pieces are working together to bring a a a changing of the body amen like i tried to show you i said a lot of times people say well let's go yes yes god told abraham i'm going to visit you according to the time of life and guess who he visited sarah abraham didn't get pregnant sarah did then hebrew picked it up and said amen that god gave him strength gave sarah strength what was the strength the revelation of who she was amen amen abraham knew his name has been changed and so sarah knew she her number she had to come into a revelation of who she that's what i'm saying when you come to understand that this message is about you amen amen you god changing you amen bringing you into his household you that he thought about and and and and made it happen all these years amen all these years all the struggles you've gone through everything you've gone through and guess what paul said the suffering of this world cannot even be compared oh come on somebody well i got the holy ghost brother said it's like a small little button huh think about it this thing enveloping you right to appoint amen he you walk into your theophany and we don't even know what the glorified body is like brother branham amen only could tell you what he saw he said they were real i could touch him and all these things but we're getting ready to take into a new world a new order of life way beyond anything like this this is like being a maggot and that's like being a butterfly two different worlds and people want to miss it for rock and roll and all these other kind of crazy lustful stuff miss it let me tell you something about fashion and fast it gonna go and come go and come go and curl go and come right the outflow the platform shoes the short dresses the everything come and go i don't live to see circles oh that's coming back in style they say it never stops why it's redundant the same thing over and over again gets a little worse as it goes along it gets so bad brother said the women after wilder will be wearing fig leaves hello we've arrived mr truth let me hurry up folks i'm taking too much time forgive me when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though and hoes shouldn't camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will be confident i'll become i be confident one thing i have i desire of the lord that will i seek after that i listen when you seek him you're searching when i seek after that i may what dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to be inquired in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his provision come on somebody amen thank you i believe where did he hide moses just tell me where did he hide moses where did he hide elijah that's all i'm saying god has a hiding place amen so paul said sleeping you know dead in christ you heard i said the other day really paul could only express it the way he knew how to express it because saints were dying but yet they were alive brother branham said they were there he said they saw millions coming they went up in heaven on a pill with a pillow on a bed somewhere sleeping no they're doing things another dimension hallelujah is that right you say oh brother that's not well yes it is because remember when they were having the battle down in babylon and the ain't different angels uh wormwood and and all of them came with lord let me go down and brother branham you know uh dramatize it where jesus said no i've been looking at this man and i'm going down myself so you got to understand it ain't because something is silent doesn't mean it's not moving amen when there was silence in heaven you know the bible says silence but because of silence doesn't mean things are not moving elsewhere because there were things moving down on earth y'all understand what i'm saying and you and i must understand that this what i'm talking about is life folks this is not this is not a storybook story like a cinderella or something this is real real people real souls real people that are that are being changed from glory to glory some people are more farther ahead than others but at the end of the day we're all fit together one thing i have desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock what a revelation and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his listen brother branham had to grow into his his maturity and his understanding of who he was even when it came to the three squirrels and god began to deal with him with the spoken word and said to you you know how many do you want y'all understand me he had to understand whatever he would speak he had to stand by his word that's right amen bride of christ hallelujah whatever unction comes on you and god have you speak you must believe what you've spoken amen all the way why because you have an angel in charge of you glory to god now shall my head be lifted above all my enemies you know one time i thought my head no my head is jesus christ in this time they gonna see who really is brian but by the time they recognize it we'll be gone you know how many people saw enoch disappear let me ask you a question how many people saw the resurrection of jesus christ how many people saw his ascension yeah yeah how many his disciples that was it he said like man i'm coming you see brother branham preached a message god interprets his own word and that's what makes it so hard for the intellectuals because they feel like they've got it down so pat and jesus come a different way and they miss him all together right john the baptist all the the hills will be brought down low and the values will be lifted up and here was a man looked like a crazy man standing there fulfilling the scripture yes amen john the baptist it's all about men every devil every demon figure in the book of revelation is speaking of anointings that anoint the men of our day scholar cut of beasts and all that what was that wrong what was in wrong men what was the devil doing he was displaying himself he was a dragon what about america a lamb but she now a dragon amen what was it politics people the three unclean frogs brother said it was the beatles you know we we don't understand because god does it in the way he does it think about if he was in paul's day or somebody else's john's day and you come to this day and you see world war one you don't know what a bomb is you don't know what a helicopter that can shoot missiles down you don't know but you see in this helicopter man with the face so you said amen the locust had the face of a man let's move on eagles wings and what happens folks you and i come to a place amen that we begin to look at what god is doing and now the expression of god is going on right now and people can't even see it they can't see it because they're looking for something way up here and god always does it in such a lonely way who would have thought a prostitute by the name of mary would be in the hall of fame of god amen or rehab the amen it's true who with the thought but god hides himself he hides himself and right now he's hiding himself in us the world can't see it they see our failures they see our faults but they can't see on the inside they don't know what's on the inside let me tell you like this if those people in brother branham's day would have recognized that that was god on the inside of him they would have treated him differently amen but they did him just like they did jesus amen so is it now the people in our day if they known that know that god is in you they would treat you differently god is rich in mercy is that right that's what brother branham preached and when any believer comes to god he becomes god's attribute of his word he is used to manifest the word that that's promised for that day see that's right god rich in mercy has never left us without a testimony he is rich in mercy amen i don't know about you but i know that i'm i'm a witness i'm a victim of you want to say of his mercy we find now that god was so merciful to moses out there in the dead sea out in the red sea out there rather then when he said here in exodus 19 4 he says i'll carry you away on eagle's wings brought you to myself carried them on eagle's wings and brought you to my did he do that already basically that's what happened rebecca was on eagle's wings she didn't come up into isaac oh somebody help me and that's what happened in moses day they followed the message on eagle's wings amen that's what's happening now you can't meet him amen unless you see the prophet of the day and the ministry of jesus christ through him and follow this message those are the eagles wings that will carry you to the rapture amen help us jesus and god always liking his prophet to eagles and when he and what was it moses was the messenger and they were following moses and that was the eagle wings that they were carried on because he was packing god's message and their people you know that's what i want to understand they don't understand what brother said well you know i've done what i could do and maybe they'll come another someone else i'm preparing away hello did you have you heard that before john says i'm preparing the way for who jesus christ himself amen you understand me somebody else oh some great one comes no no no no the great one is jesus christ himself amen that's the one it's spiritual but it's real amen they were following god as they followed moses and with his message of deliverance and the bible said he they perish not with them who believe not because god was rich in mercy to them because they were following his commandments god wants us to follow his commandments god rich and mercy 1965. is that right listen as i said only the predestinated will be able to see this revelation i'm speaking of we know that there's no other life where is it it ain't in the denominations where is it this is it this message came from the holies of holies folks this is really the voice of god we must understand that's exactly what it is if we don't see it like that we're going to miss something we'll let our minds you know you know uh how you say it you know we're reason that reasoning ain't going to help you with this you have no you have no thought coming as brother brown says and it goes right by them and they don't recognize it till it's gone it only picks up the predestinated seed that god predestined native before the foundation of the earth the same thing comes through in the days of noah same thing comes through in the days of moses days of elijah days of the prophets days of jesus on down through and to this very hour the predestinated person with the seed of god the word in their manifesting in their manifesting itself so surrendered to the will of god that the word and the word alone manifest itself in this person the prisoner to an individual that's the way it got to be surrendering all to him so much till you become a prisoner like paul said um or so much i could say but i i want to let you go one thing i i'll say this you got to have depth to yourself brother brandon said you have heard me say that people say the devil made me do this no no the devil didn't do it i mean there's nothing lying on the devil you just wasn't sealed in because when you are sealed in he is sealed out yeah i see now a lot of people don't want to agree with that because they said i know i got it he said just wasn't sealed in because when you were sealed in he sealed out yeah see now you went out to him he couldn't get into you because the only way to get into you is come through the same process that you have he would have to be saved sanctified and filled with the holy ghost then he'd be your brother so you see he didn't do it no no you just went to the border line and come back lusting for the things of the world you never went all the way over into canaan you see across jordan the death to itself to shout to self and all of us got to cross jordan that death to ourselves notice now the book sealed and you are sealed with the book until the day of your redemption and that's the breach god is good to us and i'm just going to close on this but god is good to us and you and i should never forget uh that the dangers of this time is that if you're not careful you follow yourself you'll find yourself into a systematic worship god hates it he hates it when israel did it he hates it when uh laodicea did it all the others and this is uh uh this is where the eagles fly we're not cage eagles this is the age where the eagles fly you understand me and i said you know we must understand by the grace of god amen that the only way we'll accomplish our this journey is to become a lamb is that right when john took the book thought it was a saw you know he heard the voice of a lion and when he turned he saw a lamb a lamb who got the victory and brother branham said that's how jesus conquered by sweetness and meekness you can't go with this attitude and being mean and selfish and arrogant and all that kind of stuff saying any kind of thing you want to you need a nature change and only god can change that you and i must stay on our knees those foolish virgins came to and said how i mean give us of your all and the wise virgin said you go pray up it's prayer time praying time and this is why the devil fights most of us is not all of us in that area because he knows that's where your strength that's where your change comes the hearing of the word takes fire takes a fire when you're down on your knees let's stand i'm so glad jesus set me free i'm so glad oh jesus sent me oh i'm so glad jesus set me free singing glory oh [Music] [Music] that jesus set me free i'm so glad that jesus set me free i'm so glad that jesus set me free i'm singing jesus set me free oh satan had me bound but jesus set me free for
