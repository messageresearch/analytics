[36:58] [music]
[37:02] Amen. Amen.
[37:05] Well,
[37:07] left my tamarine home.
[37:13] Just so many things have been happening
[37:15] today.
[37:19] The very message I was going to preach
[37:21] tonight
[37:23] &gt;&gt; has been erased.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Gone.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; I can't recall the
[37:35] last time I've had that happen to me.
[37:40] And I don't know what I did wrong.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; But uh I believe God bless tonight
[37:53] &gt;&gt; as we stand.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Give honor to everybody tonight. I need
[37:57] to see you, brother. God bless you.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; God bless everybody here.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Sister Karen and the new one.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:08] God is so good. to us.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; No matter what we go through, God is in
[38:13] it.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with us to Hebrews 7.
[38:29] just got my phone back.
[38:33] It went dead on me. Different things
[38:36] happened,
[38:38] &gt;&gt; but by the grace of God, you know, we
[38:40] spent about five hours at the Amazon
[38:44] place trying to get my phone,
[38:50] the blessing, and all of that. I didn't
[38:51] have to pay for a new one.
[38:55] [laughter]
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. and I got everything free. So we
[39:00] thank God for his grace.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; The subject uh tonight I want to
[39:07] minister on is the power of revelation
[39:14] as we turn to Hebrews 7
[39:19] 1-4.
[39:25] But this MZDC, king of Salem,
[39:28] &gt;&gt; priest of the most high God, who met
[39:31] Abraham, returning from the slaughter of
[39:34] the king, and blessed him,
[39:40] to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part
[39:43] of all, first being by interpretation
[39:46] king of righteousness, after that also
[39:49] king of Salem, which is king of peace,
[39:54] without father, without mother, without
[39:57] descent, having neither beginning of
[39:59] days nor end of life, but made like unto
[40:03] the son of God.
[40:08] Now consider how great this man was unto
[40:11] whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the
[40:14] tenth of the spoils.
[40:42] Abrahamology.
[41:16] Amen. Let us pray. My gracious father
[41:19] God, we thank you for your grace and
[41:20] your mercy. We thank you for being so
[41:23] good to us.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Lord, you have been better to us than
[41:26] we've been to ourselves.
[41:29] We pray Lord God that you bless the
[41:31] service in a special way.
[41:33] We give you honor. We give you praise.
[41:36] We give you the glory. We know that
[41:38] [snorts] all things are moving by your
[41:40] power.
[41:42] Lord, you know this day you've seen this
[41:45] moment. We pray, Father God, that you
[41:47] give us grace to move completely out of
[41:50] your way that you would have
[41:52] preeminence. If I have said or done
[41:55] anything, oh God, that have not been
[41:58] pleasing in thy sight, forgive us, oh
[42:00] God, and cleanse us from all
[42:02] unrighteousness.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[42:08] Amen. Amen.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[42:17] When we think about
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Revelation,
[42:23] something that God reveals.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; You don't get it by intellect.
[42:31] Even though it may strike your intellect
[42:33] first,
[42:35] it has to go down to the heart because
[42:38] true revelation is revealed to the
[42:40] heart.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Now, here was a man by the name of
[42:45] Abraham
[42:48] who had met God
[42:51] uh before
[42:54] but had never really seen it.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; But we realize something today
[43:03] that uh when it comes to God and
[43:06] Abraham,
[43:09] God had to reveal himself.
[43:13] See, you can't know God except he
[43:15] revealed himself.
[43:19] And that's why I think brother Brandham
[43:21] when he be he preached
[43:23] He talks about the the the the scripture
[43:26] according to Matthew.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Upon this rock I'll build my church.
[43:33] And he said the rock was not Peter.
[43:36] And the rock was not just Jesus.
[43:41] It was a revelation
[43:44] of who he was.
[43:47] Revelation is important
[43:50] &gt;&gt; because not only did Abraham recognize
[43:54] who he was,
[43:57] but Abraham paid tithes.
[44:02] My question would be,
[44:04] why did not Abraham
[44:07] find a lamb,
[44:10] &gt;&gt; slay the lamb,
[44:12] and offer up a burnt sacrifice.
[44:17] In Abraham's revelation,
[44:21] he understood the battle had been fought
[44:26] and the victory was won.
[44:29] And Melzdc stood as the victory
[44:34] victory.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; He was the sacrifice.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; And instead of offering up a lamb,
[44:44] &gt;&gt; he paid tithe.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. giving reverence
[44:52] and respect to GOD
[44:55] FOR all the redemption work
[44:59] he had done.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; He understood
[45:04] that his salvation
[45:07] came by the grace of God.
[45:11] Hallelujah.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Abraham that won the battle.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; IT WAS GOD WHO WON THE BATTLE.
[45:19] HALLELUJAH.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; And he MCZDC,
[45:24] &gt;&gt; he was the great warrior.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; He was the the the the the FORCE BEHIND
[45:30] THE SCENE.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And it was revealed
[45:36] to Abraham. Now,
[45:38] you might not think this is great,
[45:42] but you got to realize Abraham came from
[45:44] a place
[45:48] Amen.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; LIKE INDIA
[45:52] everything with God.
[45:57] Now he sees God
[46:00] recognize who he's WORSHIPING
[46:04] and and in return
[46:09] what God had given him.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Revelation is amazing.
[46:17] I want you to understand, watch the
[46:19] scriptures,
[46:22] every victory
[46:24] &gt;&gt; was given
[46:26] given somebody revelation,
[46:31] right? If you go all the way back
[46:37] and able,
[46:41] let me go on on back 10. Let's go back.
[46:45] Adam and Eve.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Eve was deceived
[46:54] &gt;&gt; and Adam was not.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Adam willfully sin.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Therefore,
[47:03] if a man sinned,
[47:06] he took a man for redemption.
[47:11] Even in the New Testament,
[47:14] THE GRACE OF GOD STILL stands with Eve.
[47:19] It says she was deceived.
[47:23] She was reviled.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She didn't mean to do it in
[47:27] the first place.
[47:31] Revelation
[47:33] was given to a uh Adam
[47:36] &gt;&gt; concerning his wife.
[47:40] Hallelujah.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; He could have left her there.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; But he recognized one thing.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; That she was a part of him
[47:53] ever be complete
[47:57] without her.
[47:59] Even as Jesus Christ
[48:02] will never be complete without his
[48:04] bride.
[48:06] THE POWER OF REVELATION.
[48:09] WILL MAKE A MAN STAND UP TO A GIANT.
[48:14] The power of revelation
[48:17] bring down GET RID OF ALL OF THE ODDS.
[48:21] YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'm saying? THE THE
[48:24] POWER OF REVELATION
[48:26] TO A REAL CHRISTIAN MAKES ALL THINGS
[48:30] POSSIBLE.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE ARE NO FENCES.
[48:36] THERE ARE NO HINDRANCES.
[48:39] BECAUSE GOD SAID IF YOU ASK ANYTHING
[48:45] BELIEVE THAT YOU SHALL receive it
[48:49] unto you
[48:51] is powerful.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Brother says this
[48:59] &gt;&gt; in adoption. Who was that man?
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Who was he?
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 43.
[49:07] Who was he? He never had a father. He
[49:10] never had a mother. He never had uh when
[49:14] he began
[49:16] or he never did have a time he ever die.
[49:21] He met Abraham coming from the slaughter
[49:23] of the kings.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not just the slaughter of
[49:29] the people.
[49:31] Slaughter of the king.
[49:34] HALLELUJAH. WHAT WAS HE DOING? He went
[49:37] out to get Lot.
[49:40] And I thought when I read this quote,
[49:43] I said, "Lord, we're falling short.
[49:46] We're not going out to get Lot.
[49:50] Lot is out there.
[49:52] AND LOT IS STILL A PART OF ABRAHAM'S
[49:55] INHERITANCE."
[49:59] That's right. To bring him where? BACK.
[50:04] AND HE slaughtered the kings
[50:07] which then kings had slaughtered.
[50:11] The kings had a slaughtered.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; I believe 10 or 15 kings
[50:19] and their kingdoms. But Abraham armed
[50:23] his servant and went after him,
[50:27] separated himself by night. I love this
[50:31] because this didn't happen during the
[50:33] daytime.
[50:35] This happened during the night time
[50:39] where you couldn't clearly see.
[50:42] LET ME SAY IT LIKE THIS. FAITH SEES NO
[50:45] GIANT
[50:50] too hard for God.
[50:54] You have to hear what I'M SAYING
[50:55] TONIGHT. BUT Abraham armed his servants
[50:59] and went after him AND SEPARATED HIMSELF
[51:02] BY NIGHT
[51:05] when he caught HIM IN THE NIGHT TIME.
[51:08] HALLELUJAH. OH, BROTHER. We work in the
[51:11] darkness now.
[51:14] Hallelujah. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. WE ARE
[51:16] WORKING IN THE DARKNESS NOW.
[51:19] THE ONLY LIFE WE HAVE IS THE GOSPEL
[51:23] LIFE.
[51:25] BUT BEATING HIMSELF, but he separated
[51:28] HIMSELF
[51:29] AND CAUGHT HIM AND BROUGHT HIM BACK ON
[51:33] HIS ROAD BACK. HALLELUJAH. THERE NOT
[51:36] GOING TO BE ANOTHER day as such.
[51:39] HALLELUJAH. IT IS A BREAKING OF THE DAY.
[51:42] But this breaking OF THE DAY IS OUR
[51:44] RAPTURING TIME.
[51:48] HALLELUJAH.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You love the Lord.
[51:54] It's something that God gives to you.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; You are chosen
[52:00] elected of God.
[52:03] God said it is given to you
[52:07] to know the scriptures
[52:10] to understand the revelation.
[52:14] For an example, the woman caught in
[52:17] adultery,
[52:20] nobody knew who he was.
[52:24] All her accusers.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Had no idea who Jesus was.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But somehow she caught a
[52:33] revelation.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Now let me tell you what revelation
[52:37] does.
[52:38] True revelation
[52:41] forgive you of your sin.
[52:45] Oh my god.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me EXPLAIN THAT.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; SO, HERE'S A WOMAN CAUGHT in adultery.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to kill her,
[52:58] &gt;&gt; but Jesus. AMEN.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; AND SO WHAT HAPPENS?
[53:06] HE GOES THROUGH HIS COURT case
[53:11] when he came with the sentence.
[53:20] He asked her answer QUESTION
[53:25] ACCUSER.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Who shall LAY IN THE CHARGE
[53:31] TO GOD'S ELECT?
[53:34] &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOUR ACCUSERS?
[53:38] Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? WHERE ARE
[53:40] YOUR ACCUSERS?
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD. AMEN.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; SHE SAID, LORD, I have none.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Y'all better hear me.
[53:51] AND AT THAT MOMENT
[53:57] and he SAID GO AND SIN NO MORE.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; SHE CAUGHT THE REVELATION.
[54:06] She destroy
[54:11] she destroyed destroy.
[54:16] HE DESTROYED HER.
