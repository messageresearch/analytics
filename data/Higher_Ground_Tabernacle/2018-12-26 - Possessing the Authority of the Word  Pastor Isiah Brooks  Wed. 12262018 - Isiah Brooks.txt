we'll go right into the word of the Lord to passage of Scripture would be coming from Acts the first chapter to read the eighth verse of that chapter and then we're going to read mark 16 acts when everybody says it can't be done God's Word says when everybody says impossible God says all things are possible we have the victory hallelujah not by might not by power but by his that God has given us the victory acts 1:8 says but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth one more scripture mark 16 please we're going right there with a portion of it they say it's not inspired I say if God can work miracles by the uninspired word what can he do with the inspired word mark 16 beginning at the 15th for us a fifteenth verse 16 so yeah I'm in the wrong place sorry 16:15 and he said to them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they should take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover have any father we thank you for the reading of your word we thank you for being so good to us Lord and without you we are nothing we know that we're living in a time of tests and trials and so we glorify you even in our tests and trials we glorify you and I in our strong times we glorify you in our weak times because we realize that even when we'll weak you are strong thank your father for being our strength Lord bless the service tonight in a special way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated seem like a man we appreciate the Lord for allowing us to be here tonight I was actually in my bed halfway sleep asleep when the word of the Lord began and God began to deal with me on possessing the authority of the word I think if we really realized basically God what God is saying to us possessing it it's not hoping to have it but it's something that you have in the kind of possession that God was I believe bring across to be in my mind was the kind of possession that you see among the sinners when sinners are being possessed by certain demons those who are possessed by what we call crack a crack demon is noticeable because the demon in itself began to impress itself through the flesh or fleshly body of that particular person is not difficult to identify a man who is an alcoholic because of the alcoholic demon it not only bears an impression on the human flesh or body but it also has a way of identifying itself and when it comes to possessing that kind of possessing I'm not talking about something that you hold in your hands but something that God holds in his hands so much so that God has complete control of you instead of being controlled by demons you're being controlled by God but when we think about it in the Old Testament you and I must understand that even in the Old Testament we saw by way of prophets sometime other people that God would use to to do something as I said you and I we are God's hand we're his physical body here he uses our hands he uses our eyes he uses our mind he he uses everything that we have or have offered him to you he'll use it when we think about somebody like David who was possessed of God David even in the Psalms tells us that he meditate both day and night on the Lord it was he was consumed by God if he wasn't singing he was praying and so therefore David had had a possession and it was that possession was the possession of God or God possessed him and therefore when God possessed you you actually have the authority of God living in you it's not you with the authority but it's God that's living in you that has the authority and then therefore you become John joint-heirs of that authority you take David as I said when he ran after the lion and the bear David had to be under the influence of something it was not David's own wheel it was not David's ego it was God because no man in his in his right mind would ever chase a bear or a lion many of us wouldn't even chase a big dog but under the inspiration of of God God possessing David - David himself had the authority he had the power that could conquer the lion and the bear yay though I walk through the valleys and shadows of death David said I feel no evil because thou art with me when we talk about having authority we're talking about not only we talk about a legal person somebody who's legally in power to make or to enforce some kind of law we talk about it in this in in in in in in the function of government a policeman or Sheriff we understand by God's grace that you know some of them physically are not so much threatening but it's the uniform that they where is the thing the car they drive it's it's the outward appearance of what what what what they represents that we fear because we realize it's just not one person behind the badge it's a whole army of people that that stands with him and that authority is not just a single man Authority yet he you and he uses that authority as though the government is on the side because he realized the government is on the side and once we come to see that the authority in which God has given to us is not just a one man Authority it is Authority that even heaven has to recognize even demons have to recognize that that the authority of it in you is that right because the Bible says that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that that Jesus not you but Jesus is Lord to the glory of the Father see it is God in you that the demons recognize not only three demons but all heaven must recognize Jesus in you hallelujah and understand when you have Jesus in you you have the word because the Bible said in the beginning was the word the Word was made flesh and that same were right became flesh right in the beginning was the word in the Word was with God that word became flesh hallelujah that was in the body of Jesus but now the flesh has become word in this hour the same Jesus Hebrews 13 today says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever he is a God that cannot change hey man he is God and everything that we see see taste feel smell even things we can even pick up with our natural senses belong to him and he is the akka of it all he is the only potentate y'all know what I'm saying he is the only authority the Bible says neither is there salvation in any other but there is no other name given among men whereby we must be saved and that that name oh nice it's got about so what would you what are you going with brother I'm trying to say that the same Jesus that conquered Legion the same Jesus that turned water into wine the same Jesus that raised Lazarus from the dead the same cheeses that opened up the eyes of the blind he still lives and where does he live he lives in you and me is that right but what we need to do is that that Jesus possess us let him control us is that right Paul says I'm a prisoner of Christ hallelujah in other words I cannot do what I want to do I can't go where I want to go I have no freedom and guess what I won't no freedom let my liver to be in him because he whom the Sun is set free is free indeed hallelujah and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty think about it sometimes we get off course but one thing for certain those whom God has chosen to be bride for this day there is no way you can get around being what God wants you to be not only was you predestined a brother and says predestinated is not such of a good word but because of God for knowledge hallelujah for knowledge look back to election and I think election looks back to destiny how every works it was because God saw you knew you understood you chose you birth you it can't be born again until God gives you birth it's not him who will it know he that run it is God who showed mercy God gives you birth think about it Samson got off of course but you see he still had a word was chosen to destroy the Philistines and God allowed Samson I love it to fail he had a season of failure but he still was chosen by God to conquer the Philistines Peter had a season of failure but he still was the man who was to preach and open up the New Testament move of God on the day of Pentecost y'all hear what I'm saying I'm saying throughout the Bible you see failures and failures and failures but you see you must understand God has an appointed time and often time we get ahead of God right Moses Moses got a here to God hallelujah but as I brother said he meant at times his season God waited to bring it back around again see that's why I like the song there's no turning back there is no giving up hallelujah all I know is that when I fall he helps me up all I gotta do is wait till my change comes in the change will come but the random preach the message about possessing the gates of your enemy and you and I know that the reason why we can possess the gates of our enemy we can come with such an authority that the gates must fall or the gates must open why because we're not speaking by our own voice we're speaking the voice of God that has been given to us to speak is that right because all we're doing now is just echoing what's already been preached echoing what has already been sounded we just resounded it and however it sounded in the beginning the resounding is just as powerful as the sounding maintaining control and that's what we must learn how not just to bring in ourselves into a controlling of God but maintaining it I believe brother Branham said it like this he said getting me high in the veil and staying shutting the curtain don't come out stay behind me whether Shekinah glory can completely possess and control you hallelujah and the scripture you and I must realize a man that this scripture March 16 wasn't just given to Paul and Peter and John it was given to the whole body of Christ that word was to last until Jesus come right from Aegeus he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you you know I thought for a long time that when Jesus spoke that you know he was just speaking you know Oh like I was gonna feel him but his word is his word that will never leave you it's his word that will never forsake you hallelujah even when you're in trouble your word his word will never forsake you he even when you sin his word will never forsake you when you come short in life his word will never forsake you hallelujah David described him a friend above our friends hallelujah glory to God what are you saying that authority possessing you know letting it possess you hallelujah United States the truth Isis I've seen people like that you know you got the policeman and then you got the policeman you ever seen a policeman that seemed to be the opposite which oh man he he overdo it you know he know but he doesn't it is absolutely that's the way it should be the policeman supposed to be a policeman it is supposed to possess him he is supposed to become what the word says he is or what the law says he's supposed to be think about it if we could just allow the del our God to possess us like we allow these strange spirits at times to possess us we'll be ok hmm it's amazing how I'm just just saying it it's amazing how a lot spirit can make you do anything and then God has a hard time getting us to do what he wants us to do teeth but God wants us if we have a channel to open ourselves to unless we ought to have our channel open for Christ for the Holy Ghost to deny it to shut the door hallelujah John says a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven John 327 so it ain't something you can just say oh I'm gonna get it but you know we know who can give it he said we have not because we ask not if you ask of good things from God he will not give you bad things is that right he said if you ask for bread he will not give you a surprise hallelujah and so therefore you and I must understand when good things come we should treasure them when God gives you visually anything you should treasure that hallelujah because you did not do it it was a Christ in you it was a possession of the Holy Ghost here we in recognizing he says now we are fully acquainted we people who search the Scriptures day and night and read our papers and hear the news commentators that this world is now standing in the grip of two great spiritual forces and they are both religious forces I believe that these great forces are soon coming to a head and both of these great forces was represented in these two sons of Isaac how that God in His infinite wisdom had for shouted all things to us that we might buy these things know of certain what leads before us y'all hear me two forces you're gonna either here to one or the other Christ or Antichrist hallelujah me it's so plain made it so plain that God in His Word and the nature and his universe is so perfectly a race together that even the sinner can see something's fixing to take place God has so arranged it no one will be without an excuse hallelujah none of us will be without it all God I didn't know here he says even the sinner knows everybody feels the tension right now everybody feel a little nervous out there because they know something is about to happen but they don't know what it is people just don't have peace of mind they can't rest because they know something is about to happen hallelujah but thank God for the little rabbit thank God for that little rabbit that escaped the hounds hallelujah he saw a cleft in the rock and he said if I could just get in the cleft of the rock I will be saved don't you know that's how the devil is the devil he's behind it there is no chasing everybody hallelujah brother branham in that little store said that even the rabbit could feel the breath of the hounds on his heel hallelujah hey man but he saw in the distance a cleft in the rock he said I could just make it there I'll be safe heartbeat oh Lord hallelujah hide me O Lord in the cleft of the rock to the storms of life is past that's the psalmist hallelujah you can't play with the devil the devil is real and you think he ain't chasing he's doing everything he can to get you don't you everything that you are all right the devil is behind every one of us in here and if he can get you he's going to get you the only thing is you've got to find a club you got to find that that that wounded side of Jesus Christ to hide in my wife was talking to me today and she was just telling me about all you know negative we don't know things have changed and everybody checked I said honey everybody change young - oh you changed no none of us stays the same coz weather changes everything climate changes everything people change hallelujah they don't mean to change that but they change they go out they go change one of those young fellas down there in Iowa City said man I saw a picture of you when you was younger and I'm like oh my hey brother I'm growing older all of us wish we could stay there but that ain't do it it's going to change right and when you look at these dangers or what brothers what are you saying I said I told it's like that's her honey the only thing I could tell you it's define Christ and hide yourself in him that is the only safety zone now there's the only praise because everything around you is gonna change people don't change in not good ways and bad ways but they don't change don't expect nothing to stay the same I said honey even our marriage you know we've grown all together nothing it's never it's not the same you can wish all you want to but their days you'll never go back to you hear what I'm saying not that we wanted to change but circumstances things around you make things happen and the only place you can find a certainty it's in the Word of God the Word of God never changes what he said yesterday he still means it today it will be forever law y'all hear me amen so what are you saying the safest thing to do for anybody is your lord possess me control my eyes control my is control my heart control my seat control all of me till there's nothing left of me I want to be fully persuaded and taken over you said well what are you saying brother we're living in the last days look at all the people who say they believe the message and there is no inspiration there is no no you no no no I know zeal you know people that live in the city right here and God they won't even come to church hmm God use a brother from aims to be a rebuke oh and did you see it be right under their noses and they don't even see the hand of God won't even see it but God knows what he's doing every body that God ordained to be ready for rapture will be ready they will be completely possessed by the Holy Ghost hmm this this little short work whatever God however God's defined it or even make manifest you know what it's gonna be individuals that's packing Jesus packing the Holy Ghost yes sir I'm not talking about a babe in a manger I'm talking about full stature of Christ that's what's gonna happen God gonna use us he is using us even in this evil age he's still using us but you know there's coming a squeeze and people are not recognized em like I tell people I said the orange gotta be juicy before the squeeze it's got a man squeezing it and it's just one of those hybrid hybrid on just as a smell good look good and it's all dried out right for God getting something that's been kissed by nature hallelujah Daniel the twelfth chapter one through forces and at that time shall Michael stand up and the Great Prince was standing for the children of the people and there should be a time of time such as never was since there was a nation even to the same time and at that time I shall be delivered Oh at that time when Michael Stan at that time we will be Deedle what are you talking about they're coming a rapture hallelujah but it's right in there right in that space just before Moses and Elijah and God comes along and he wrapped just a bride but in that time is troubles in that time nations are all upset aim it everybody want to destroy Israel and don't the people don't even understand why they want to be strong you know why everybody hate hate Israel because the devil knows Messiah coming from there and he knows if he gonna wipe out Israel he can wipe out the Messiah hallelujah he did it in II job hallelujah he did it him in Raja Jerusalem area is that right hallelujah he's gonna try to wipe us out but he cannot wipe us out hallelujah why why because in us is God Satan he's God he hates anybody that can produce him you don't care if you can't produce him he hates you if you can produce it he hates if you possessed by him he hates when he see you pray for somebody and somebody overcome he hates it when he see you lay hands and somebody overcome he hates it when he see you testifying about him and you know what you're talking about he hates it hallelujah when you live for Jesus your mind is on Jesus every day he hates it he's gonna do everything he can to stop you oh but he can't stop the ones who are already possessed hallelujah he said in that day you'll know I'm in the father the father than me and I am you hallelujah and it ain't nothing Brian hallelujah that will know that Jesus Christ is only Inza how they live here whoo and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament for the answer that's the rapture and that's what to fall because so will awake the dead in Christ shall arise hallelujah we'll catch him up there's another awakening hallelujah and that is the white throne judgment hallelujah there is a second resurrection but you better make sure you make that first one hallelujah hey man is that right what is it people who are possessed if you ever want to be possessed by a spirit you oughta want to be possessed by the Holy Spirit hallelujah because when the Holy Spirit live in you he will live holy oh but all Daniel shut up the words seal the book even to the time of the end hallelujah Daniel had a book to seal up hallelujah because you got to understand that when the Word of God was open in this day it not only released those who would make a rapture but he also released those that would come up at the second age second time hallelujah ain't God good to us ha because there is history it is the air it is the end and all these things overlaps each other until they come to a maturity until they come into a head is that right o people why the seven seals are not open hello is open but you said why worry what do you mean listen it opened long enough to tell you there were silence hallelujah is that right had it not open you would not have known but it was open that you might know that the seventh was open but there was silence and weathermen said he's here basically that's working with the rapture that's what he said no man know the day nor the hour we know the season hallelujah and we know the word that telling us he's coming so we what we make ourselves ready hmm how do you know how do you make yourself ready by taking the word and let that word possess you hallelujah meditate on it hallelujah meditate on it think on these things whatsoever is lovely whatsoever is pure whatsoever is honest what's whoever's of a good report feed on these things hallelujah and so you know I was realizing that every time the negativity stuff comes to your mind that is not of God because the Bible said love thinketh no evil hallelujah negative stuff will bring you down in your spirit and you find out all of a sudden that Holy Spirit is being oppressed I'll press down and now you got a prayer a depression spirit working with you doesn't mean you don't have the Holy Ghost but you didn't allow the Holy Ghost to possess you know huh it's like you're allowing this depression and there is no depression in heaven so where is the spirit coming from straight out of hell hmm many things that way God is desiring for certain people to see and others cannot see oh I love that when God in his eminent wisdom has predestinated or for Dane for certain things to happen it could happen to to the person sitting right next to you and you will know nothing about it look at Dalton when elijah was down at Dalton and they all and they were all surrounded there by the aliens that come in the Syrian army looking for Elisha the prophet for when they began to find out every time the Syrians would come over to Israel to make war why the Israel area life would be laying in ambush for them what was it God was telling the Israelites something by way of a prophet hallelujah a million and when Elijah went diamonds his Lord Amen you know and smoke them blind he was leading them all around and they never knew it was he like that's how it is now God comes in the church he preaches a message and people that don't only recognize a God some do and some don't setting right next to each other and don't see God and the other man to see God and this one won't see God and this is God hallelujah and this one goes out and said what is it same message same word for some can see sometimes things that others cannot see it happens heating everywhere of I ever go help us Jesus other bodies a search the scripture for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me don't you know if the devil can get you oppressed if he can get to you depressed or he knows he's working he's got an atmosphere to create an illusion in you he can make you think God don't love you God don't care cuz he's gonna saying that blues to you he'll there but when you're setting in heavenly places you realize that the joy of the Lord is Mustang in God dwells in his praises in the praise of his people hallelujah and see that's what the devil he try to keep you from praising God because he realized once you stop praising him you're moving right on out of that presence and now he can slip his tricky hmm how you gonna cast out Devils and you're not even happy you know you have no authority you've losing you know you stripped your uniform off per say you understand what I'm saying Amen but if you keep that uniform on hallelujah if you allow the Holy Spirit to possess every fiber of your being like brother bear don't say people can't understand it why some can just stay happy all the time it's because of where their dwelling huh some are dwelling in there any in the Holies of Holies and some are in and out of the Holies of Holies and then some are out in the court and some out here you know it depends on where your dwelling that's just where your joy is cause of that press to order mark of the high calling which is in Christ Jesus but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in what spirit and in truth you can't worship God in spirit and not truth as truth and not spirit he must worship in spirit and in truth for the father what he's looking for it seek it knows that means he continue to look for those kind that's gonna worship Him when they're high worshiping when he's low worship when you're by yourself worship Him amen in a crowd no matter where you are he gonna worship God God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth y'all think I tell you what folks I go through battles all the time I really do but you know who picks me up he does hallelujah you know and it's the truth if I find myself getting a little little you know too much in the wrong spirit sometime I call people just to talk cuz I know somewhere they gonna give me a word of encouragement hallelujah we feed each other's people we strengthen one another we are we and we are at army we are a body so you don't allow yourself to be isolated that's the trick of the enemy I'm almost done second Corinthians three 13 through 18 says and not as Moses would put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded until this day remain that the same they are untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Vail has done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the Vail is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and we are with open face beholding as a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit hallelujah are you saying brother Brooks I'm just saying you know when people people people until you know people is there some people who are resting on on brother branham y'all y'all get me wrong I respect the Prophet I love the Prophet I thank God for the Prophet but you cannot hold him in a place he's not supposed to be and see what happened let me tell you let me say like this when the children of Israel were Moses when they were in the wilderness what did they do they erected up a system and they they brought a goal they made a golden calf and everything else and that golden calf what was it it was the spirit of Daltry it was the spirit of fornication it was the spirit of Farley it was the spirit of partying hello and how many honest with you I see that all over the message I see the spirit of partying the spirit of fornication and adultery I see all of that and you know why because they have made them a sister but you got to understand that every system you know bril don't call it broken sister yes a sister and system insane difference yeah it's something that's controlled right but when they come back to Jesus Christ when they come back to the Holy Ghost then they're fine the liberty they've been looking for they find a power they've been looking for hallelujah they're seen by God's grace amen they've been veiled all this time the veil must be lifted every believer must come back to the Lord Christ when they come back to the Lord then they'll see Amen that they are really free they'll not have the strength that did what happened that they would have until they come back to Christ it happened in Israel it happened with them and it has happened in this message I'm telling you and I don't care if the people say Brotherhood you're not you're not preaching it like I don't care what folks says I know who I am I know where I come from and I know where I'm going and my thing is I see the spirit of that Antichrist that's literally blinding the people and making them think that they're right when their own because they have become like the Pharisees we are the ultimate of the message of the word then God takes somebody like an adulterous woman a woman at the whale huh somebody no bagger to them raised him up in a position why they still can how can he have anything to do with these publicans and sinners and Jesus said yes but these public concerns and sinners will enter in way far faster way before you do they wanted to stone him not Estonia but he told him the truth what we don't understand it this best it ain't no system it shouldn't be what happens on the inside of this church ain't nobody else's business hello I'm not connected to nobody but Christ yeah I'm in charge its sovereign time himself and the truth of the matter is it's all right to have somebody for accountability but the truth of the matter is we are joined to Christ Christ only and what everybody else is doing does not dictate to us of what we should be doing ah because we should be being led by the Holy Spirit hmm is that right today the Church of the Living God has the privilege of standing and seeing the conquering resurrected Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God standing present living in his church doing the same thing he did then then we we possess the gates of the enemy i'ma turn to a scripture a brother I told my was gonna
