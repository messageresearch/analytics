were we had lunching about of course their memory is better than mine so I know if they said it was so it was so Hallelujah we we appreciate them being here I remember our precious David was in Johannesburg there I had no idea it was over 30 years ago to thank God for him and his family so as he comes we want him to let go and have let [Music] God want everybody to know this is our Wednesday group y'all know how it is on Wednesday but by the grace of God we thank God for our pastor let go and let God he's got that look on his face when they about to ready to preach no worries here whatever godes on your [Music] heart the praise the Lord amen thank you kindly amen amen amen greet you all in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm Brother David Gonzalez all the way from Johannesburg South Africa we have a little church called Florida CHR Fellowship chrisan Fellowship so as you say Florida RSA not USA and it's such an honor for me to be here tonight amen with sense of like Precious Faith but more so to be uh hosted by Pastor Z Brooks we've been all been uh fans of his over the years [Music] he's been such a blessing to the bride universally and especially to the bride in South Africa I know he's really appreciated so I bring greetings from different pastors anden there's one Pastor brother Brooks stayed in his home but a man of his stat eruption shoulders with so many people so it's understandable that he won't remember all of it amen so uh this often this evening uh uh I I've come along with my with my wife sister Felicia my wife of almost 50 years and then also uh we hooked up with some fellow Saints also from South Africa in they were going to be in the Chicago area so we thought we'll look up and then just do a little they had a desire to go to Bram Tabernacle in a few places in Indiana and they requested be their guide so I why any opportunity to go you know see some saints of like Precious f is always a pleasure but I believe that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord uh nothing happens by accident amen we are here for amen because of God saw it before the foundation of the world so I've got a a supporting uh I've got brother Billy and sister Divine they from our local church uh before they relocated to the US so I'm I'm guaranteed at least five amens oh no and what about Brother Sam oh yeah then my neighbor just across the border to the Zimbabwe Zimbabwe yeah brother Samuel his family has been such a good friends of ours and uh been such a blessing over the years [Music] the ministry of his dad was s so far reaching and he yet so humble but he made such an impact on the country of Zimbabwe and he had such an incredible ability you know outside of Congo I think in the Zimbabwe you get the biggest crowds of believers you would go to special meetings and there would be two 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 Believers in one venue and one incident I recall very clearly uh I think the laain were there and there was about 120 ministers sitting on the one side and Pastor chesta knew each and everyone by name where they came from the country they were from it was just mindblowing and I believe brother Samuel is such a blessing here as well oh man like they say you know he's a chip of the old block mean whenever we were went to the arari area I mean we always hosted by his dad amen so it's such a honor for me tonight to be here uh just to be uh we had to break the word of God you break bread with Saints and my desire is that I will say something that will benefit you coming plan for for this trip was actually to go to Canada is to go to Canada that's the purpose of our our trip to this part of the world so the first connecting flight was cancelled and then the uh then the bags were were missing and when these things start happening you know we in for a blessing you see we not always aware of the big picture but all things are control hallelujah hallelujah amen so if you have your Bibles let's stand to our feet amen as we uh navigate to scripture in I believe it's a end time scripture I mean it's Luke 2426 just after the resurrection ien Jesus uh uh meets two men on the way to EMAs and they seemed to be a bit disturbed and uh Jesus says why are you looking so sad why are you a stranger don't you know what happened you know we you know our Lord Jesus Christ was crucified and we thought he's the one that's going to deliver us and set us free and many times we have the wrong impression you know sometimes thinks that Jesus Christ was a a Liberation fighter he said my kingdom was of this world I would have called 10,000 angels change the scene immediately Hallelujah but we amen as Abram seed we are just pilgrims and strangers we looking to building makers God Amen so Luke chapter 24 and I'll I think let me read just maybe from about 20 uh verse 21 says but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and besides all this today is the third day since these things were done [Music] yeah and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the Seer I mean they found not his body they came saying that they had not seen uh they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive [Music] and certain of them which were with us went to the [Music] Seer and found it even as so so as the women had said but him they saw not then said he unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets had spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself amen I like that part amen it reminds me of the time he went to the the the the synagogue the Bible says the synagogue as was his custom so Jesus went to church and and they gave him the Scrolls and he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me he's anointed me to preach Good Tidings Liberty the captives to preach the acceptable year of the Lord the scripture is fulfilled how many he found himself in the word he knew he was hallelujah amen amen and it's time that we as the Bride come to a place where we know who we are find yourself in the volume of the book hallelujah praise the Lord and the Bible says amen and verse says and ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His Glory Hallelujah so suffering precedes Glory many times people think when you join Church going to be a flowy bed of EAS but every Sun that comes has to be tried has to be tested amen amen amen so this evening if there's anybody with a need or a desire I believe he can still be touched by the feeling of our infirmities I me we sing that beautiful Reach Out And Touch as he passes by find him not too busy to hear your heart's cry and the Bible says is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if he did it for them he can do it for us he'll hear your hearts cry there was a woman with a blood issue she start and touched him hallelujah amen and and a situation was cured and we can also you can meet us at our point of need tonight amen as we bow our heads amen kind Heavenly Father we so thankful for this opportunity we can gather in this fashion Lord Lord you have this promise that where two and two three are gathered in your name there you will be in our midst Lord Lord you promised us amen you said that you're not a man that you should lie Lord you did it for others you can do it for us Lord and Lord as our faces differ so our needs differ I pray that Lord God you meet each and everyone at our point of need father I'm needy I pray that you just come and take you control of these lips Lord speak through them Lord may you hear through the ears of your people Lord God and Lord when we go out here Lord maybe we be charged father maybe like those that said did not our hearts burn with in us as he spake to us along the way we thank you Lord God for this opportunity we pray that you bless our pastor Z Brooks Lord bless the Church Lord God Higher Ground Tabernacle their families Lord God as we are getting ready for the coming of the Lord I pray Lord God that you just Supply every need according to your riches and Glory as we ask all these in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord youen you take the seats amen so the Bible says amen ought not Christ to suffered all these things and to enter into his glory am mean in 1 Peter 510 the Bible says but the grace of all the God of all Grace who had called us unto his eternal glory by Jesus [Music] Christ after that you have suffered a while after that you you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you Hallelujah but that's prior to the suffering amen praise the Lord amen there's some s a prior suffering that comes amen that word suffering perfect he wants to make us perfect it means to render us fit or sound or complete Amen to strengthen to perfect to make one what he ought to be I like that part I me what you ought to be you see we fell from somewhere now we are groaning we in travail mean there there's a a cry out for to go back to where we are and I believe that's why the scripture even says that the whole creation is groan it's in travail it's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God so if not us then who if if not now then when I believe that brother and sister all the the signs are pointing that the coming of the Lord is imminent and the bride should be crying out even so come Lord Jesus the world is falling apart there's Wars there's rumors of wars there's global warming I like one what one Minister said it's no longer rumors there Wars hallelujah amen we can say this day the scripture is fulfilled amen that word uh establish is says to make stable place firmly set fast render constant God doesn't want us to be up and down and up and down amen it's time that we know who we are amen having done all to stand let us stand amen David said don't 10,000 follow on my left and 100 on my right it won't come n un to me that thatc amen I like the song that says I Got My Mind Made Up and I won't turn back Hallelujah I want to see my Jesus hallelujah praise the Lord so I'm established amen I'm going all the way all the way hallelujah praise the Lord amen God wants to settle us amen praise the Lord amen Psalm 105 speaks about Joseph amen I will read verse 16 moreover he called a famine upon the land he break the whole staff of bread he sent the men before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they H with feets he was laid in Iron until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him hallelujah amen so there Comes A Time brother and sister while we are waiting for our word to come that the word of God will try us there will be some molding there will be some shaping you know brother says in one place he says in the old days when they were purifying gold amen the beater would place a piece of gold there and he would beat it and turn it and beat it and turn it and beat it until you would see his own image his own reflection in that piece of gold so when you are going through your trials when you going through your test God is beating you God is turning you because he wants to see him reflected in you sometimes we think God is upset with us that God is cross with us hallelujah no Hallelujah every son that comes has to be Ted hallelujah praise His wonderful name amen he was a man loved of God is a perfect type of type of perfection Isaac love Jacob Grace Abraham Faith but Joseph Perfection but look at the life of Joseph it was not a flowery Beed of e he was loved of his father gave him a coat of many [Music] colors but his bre hated him you see he couldn't help it that he saw Visions or that he could dream dreams amen so they even plotted to kill him at least Reuben had some senses as our brother let's not kill him let's rather sell him and make a profit Hallelujah typical Jew amen let's make a prophet out of it there ended up in the house of potifa a modal son about amen the business at hand and the Bible says while he was around amen the the everything that Joseph touched prospered I'm sure over that time the the netwood of ptif SW because there was a faithful Steward until P's wife had some eyes on Joseph I mean he has he's a servant he's a slave he's away from his people there's no Deacon there's no Pastor watching him he could have said man this is a good opportunity but he says I will not sin against my God how My Mind Is Made Up hallelujah amen and then we see one of his other uh uh gments come into the into play we all know about his coat of many colors but when he ran for his life he left behind a garment hallelujah oh may God help us young men when this Jezebel try and get all of you run for your life like a Joseph hallelujah hallelujah amen verse 20 say and the King sent and loosed him 20 verse 20 Psalm 1052 even the ruler of the people and let him go free he made him Lord of his house and ruler of all his substance to bind his princes at his pleasure and to teach his Senators wisdom amen Israel also came into Egypt and Jacob so journe in the land of H and he increased his people greatly and made them stronger than than their enemies hallelujah hallelujah God can turn a trial into a oh my into a testimony but we need to see the big picture am and sometimes when we in the trial it almost seems that God Is So Far Away amen the says one place he says you know sometimes we feel that after God had created us he has no more interest in his creation says that's wrong thinking that's why he says I will never leave you I will be with you hallelujah amen we may be aware of what's happening but God is in control amen one time there was elishah and his servant and they were surrounded by some serans and the the servant was panicking we Sur and elishah prayed a prayer he says open the Open Eyes he says open his eyes Lord so that he may see and my prayer this evening is Lord open some eyes so that we may see that you've got all things under control you'll never leave us Lord hallelujah amen so sometimes you know uh when we go through these trials amen sometimes we get to the end of it you see but there's a story before the Glory Hallelujah sometimes people see your letter end but they don't know what you have to go through to get to your place Hallelujah my God help us tonight amen while we going through the molding while God is is shaping us I think in the context message brother BR says there's a lot of Shaving down for you a love is shaving down for me but together we'll make it by the help grace of God amen amen there's a story be uh behind the glory amen or before the glory start you know uh many of us know about uh uh Disney W Disney I mean now you go to some business schools and and the world the the the Disney success story is used as a case study but people many people don't know where he started he was a talented uh uh artist he believed that he could he he was you know the guys that draw the pictures and all cartoonist went for many interviews they all rejected him but you see when you know that you know nothing is going to stop you God wants some people with some persistence says uh you know I'm not going to take no for an answer today people give up too easily but God wants us to P persevere I mean Jesus gives us an example he says there was a man who had an unexpected visitor and he went to his neighbor he says neighbor you know it's the middle of the month the the budget is a bit low the Cs are be I need three Loaves and the neighbor tells him have you seen the time and he started knocking on the door sh the children are sleeping Hallelujah he was persistent the Bible says amen the the neighbor never gave him the bread because of they were friends or that they were neighbors but because of his importunity refusing to be denied I'm not taking no for an answer Hallelujah I want to be like a bu Robinson Lord if you don't give me the Holy Ghost you find a bunch of Bones Hallelujah keep on crying out keep on calling out Hallelujah it says now your your father's evil as they are knows how to give good gifts how much more will God give the Holy Ghost to those that cry out andry out says whosoever knock it amen it will be open whoever seek it you shall find hallelujah it's time that we don't stop amen if God don't answer today he'll answer tomorrow if God don't heal you today he leave you next week if he doesn't you next week he leave you the other day hallelujah praise the Lord may God help us amen amen and so uh disne he ended up in no money then he went into a little dingy little room he got a cheap room in the basement and sitting there I mean having mice for company I mean there was one little mouse a mouse that caught his attention the mouse was running up and down running up and down saw Mouse and that gave him the inspiration for Mickey mousey like they say the rest is history amen but you don't know the story behind The Glory you know a man Benjamin Franklin inspiration for electricity I like the way brother Brandon puts it he said he went fishing in the sky hallelujah amen he went fishing in the sky you know the kite with the key and then got electricity in the bottle I got it I got it but he didn't know what he had and there came a man after him Edison he says if I've got it it must have benefits from me hallelujah amen and we are in the message oh I got it I got it but should have benefits for us hallelujah amen Hallelujah there was Jacob uh jacobob we know his story cor man Hallelujah but he came to a point one day and when he said Lord I I'm not going to leave you until you bless me how many looked at his life and it's so nor it's time for me Amen to change amen there's going to be something greater than this and Jacob wrestled with the angel amen hallelujah and and we know the after that God blessed him amen out of him came the 12 tribes amen but there was a story behind him before they got to the Glory Hallelujah and many of us when you look at your past and you look at your history and you look at your faults you look at your failure how many many people will write you off oh but God reaching Mercy hallelujah oh I like what Ephesians 2 says you that were dead in sin and trespasses you have been quickened hallelujah oh then he goes on to say Amen you are no longer foreigners you are no longer strangers you are of the household of God and you are bu upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets God there's no xenophobia hallelujah hallelujah put upon the apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone and now we are together a habitation of the [Applause] spirit God is not interested in a building made with hands but body has prepared no you not that you are the temples of the Holy Ghost hallelujah huj amen amen hallelujah that's David Hallelujah you know if there's anybody that has should suffer from a inferiority complex it should have been David I tell you why God is unhappy with Saul he say goes to the prophet he says no go to the house of Jesse and I will show you there to anoint the new king gets to Jesse he says I'm on a mission from God the new king is coming from your household so Jesse lines up seven of his sons but David wasn't there imagine your father don't think you're worthy to be the next king you're just a little Shepherd there little and he goes to B like s I don't want this one no no no and he goes through all seven of them is there something wrong with this picture is there another one hallelujah oh praise the Lord I'm so glad there's another one everybody wrot you off God you God chose you hallelujah praise the Lord when David came brother oh my God Nathan just emptied up the the the Horn of oil this is the Beloved of the Lord this is the anointed of that's why David had such confidence that he knew that God was with him you know many times uh in the in the Bible people are defined by certain scripture like Abram is a friend of God hallelujah John the disciple Jesus loved when we talk about Abram the father of Faith so you need to find yourself a scripture that defines you Hallelujah so when the enemy comes like a flood when the devil tries to preach to you you can say there is therefore now no condemnation to that are in Christ Jesus what can separate me from the love of godine Hallelujah well strifeful does that no in all these things hallelujah oh now are we the sons of God Amen praise the Lord amen that's why David when David knew he was you know he was in aing shepherd He was not a Hing Shepherd he's not in it for the pay so he's looking after the sheep and a lion comes and he stands his ground takes out his slingshot doesn't look at the the lion is the Lion a bear comes he slays the bear how because you know no I'm about my father's person I must protect the true shepher know in the East a Shepherd they would build a little crawl or a little uh enclosure and lay in the in the opening so no evil can come in except it has to cross the shepherd none of the sheep can go out hallelujah oh praise the Lord amen and that's why when David got to the camp the one day taking some bread for his brothers he gets to the church and there a oh to the the battlefield something not wrong you know when I get to a church and the people look worried I get worried because the joy of the Lord is our strength that's why I like brother broke when he says the joy of the Lord is our strength amen David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord I I I'm not saying we don't have problems we don't have trials but despite of all of these things amen we we have an appointment a a supernatural appointment with the god of Heaven what an opportunity when you come to the house of God come with this kind of attitude things can happen in your presence that's where I belong in your presence that's where I am strong oh in your presence things can change the right mental attitude to the promises of God oh brother sister I don't care what happened at work I don't care there's no money in the brother sister we have a divine the god of Heaven Hallelujah prise the Lord amen and and things can change you know if a dead stick could be transformed in the Pro in the presence of God the of ab it bed it blossomed it brought forth fruit in the presence of God oh you may be dry Hallelujah but in the presence of God oh brother and sister you can be like amen like Peter says if you do he says I will not be negligent but I will stir you up by bringing these things to your remembrance so you know them and I establish in the present truth hallelujah because he wants us to be partakers of the Deni divine nature in this presence things can happen hallelujah amen so David gets there and people are looking worried and he says oh what's happening and just about that time boom Here Comes Goliath oh he his timing was out wrong timing he should have come when David was not there Hallelujah and yeah he comes and the whole of Israel is back paddling David say what's going on here who is this circumcised Phil defying the armies of the loving God hallelujah and his brother says are you noty boy just go home he said no no no is there not a cause I'm here for a purpose the St of the righteous are ordered of the Lord hallelu if you scared to take up the challenge on hallelujah hallelujah amen you see David had the right attitude I can't him Hallelujah and David prophesized he says to D take your head and unfortunate for for golad he had the right name go Li Hallelujah and we know the rest of the story H hallelujah amen but we see David's Glory but we don't know the things that he went through hallelujah king of the king of Israel hallelujah oh that's David oh my by the way my name is David to h a man after God's Own Heart Hallelujah you know David was not Flawless David had lot of mistakes I mean short of being a murderer sending the guy into the front line because he wants his wife wife but David had a secret to Amen to to unlock the the the the mercies of God he says ack repentance stay the wrath of God hallelujah he hides his sin will not Prosper hallelujah oh amen there was Esther Heen there was there was a whole a plot going on to annihilate the Jewish Nation Esther is undercovered undercover in the in the palace and I like what the uncle comes to her he says you know don't think you're going to escape Hallelujah but maybe you are here for such a time as this Hallelujah and brothers and sisters maybe we are here for such a time this in fact not maybe we are here for such a time as Hebrews 11 you know speaks about the heroes of the faith men of good report whom this world is not worthy of Hallelujah and when we hear of Abraham and Isaac and all of these Great Men stand in a amen and and that let goes on there's Luther there's Wesley there's brother Bram Hallelujah they are waiting on and the Bible says they without us cannot be made perfect because God have left some better things for us hallelu amen God has left the best for last there is a people in the land I said there's a people in the land who under her Messenger will be the final voice to the final age Hallelujah oh and and Esther amen got desperate am me she called all the maidens says let us fast and pray Hallelujah and maybe God will do something for us and then I will approach the the king although it's not protocol for me to approach him un and she said those words if I perish I perish hallelujah oh praise God but es found favor amen and then God turns the tables like I said you know we don't see the big picture God uses God makes the king not to gives him insomnia maybe God put a few pebbles in his bed so he couldn't sleep and he was toing and he was turning and eventually calls one of his guys he says come read to me bring me the the Scrolls bring me the Chronicles they comes to a place where somebody had intervened on behalf of the king so that things would not bad would happen and the King say did we reward this man I says no we haven't you see God oh my God works in mysterious ways W to perform H he turns the table on an enemy and the Scribe says no we haven't and just about that time am comes in he says by the way you know what should we do to the man who has done good things for the king I'm that guy the king wants to bless me said give him robes get him all horses you know give chariots and let him through I said okay fine I want you to do that for Mor his arch enemy his arch enemy and we know the story he already had the cows constructed and he ended up on the same cows hallelujah oh my God give us some testimonies tonight you know what's a testimony first get the test and then the money there was Paul amen how many of you look at the Paul he was zealous he had a very uh impressive CV you know he says I'm a Hebrew of the Hebrews from the stock of you Benjamin whatever he says concerning the law of blameless circumcised on the 8 but then he met the P of fire Hallelujah and Paul's life was turned upside down hallelujah amen you know first he was this man full of himself you knowa trying to annihilate God's people you when he starts writing Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ not by the will of men of God and as time goes on Paul turns it down Paul a servant of Jesus Christ even to the point where he says Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ his world was totally surrendered it's not I that love but Christ that loves in me for me to love his Christ for me to love his Christ die is gain hallelujah amen you see after he met the P of fire and he said Lord who are thou the voice said I am Jesus whom now persecute now remember Jesus was already ascended so where was Christ Jesus was in his bride he was in his church Hallelujah and from that time a revelation that Jehovah of the Old Testament Jesus of the new test Oh Glory to God amen amen that's why you could say I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ when he got to the end of the road hallelujah amen he looked death in the eye his head is on the Block where is your sting where is your Victory thanks be to God giv us the victory to our Lord Jesus Christ that's why Paul could write behold I show you a mystery behold I show you a mystery we shall all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of hallelujah oh praise the Lord amen Paul the prison of Jesus Christ says in the message Fellowship we all tried every Christian every son every child that comes to God descri by the word to see if you'll be loyal to it and when The Showdown comes what decision are you going to make and we see there been a falling away what are you going to go with the flow are you like those that says where can we go thou alone has the words of eternal life amen what decision are you going to make it says and he that cannot stand just but goes on with the world is's an legitim illegitimate child not a son or a daughter of God certainly not but the spiritual minded the word lines up with the word and the spirit comes down under the shed blood and takes that person God wants us to align our will to the will of God come to church tonight for some will alignment like Jesus says not my will but your will be done amen Romans 8 tells us the spirit itself be record with uh Beed witness with our [Music] spirit that we are the children of God and if children and as is of God and joint is Christ that's number 21 if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together like I said suffering precedes the glory so if you want the glory H go through the suffering hallelujah amen amen it wasn't easy but it was worth it hallelujah amen in thean church says oh in plain language the very character of Jesus Christ was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to place of perfection hallelujah hallelujah amen so if you want to come to a place of perfection God Jesus has left a measure of suffering for you too can't you say thank you Lord for the th oh thank you for the cross Lord oh thank you for the price you paid he never promised that the cross would not get heavy Hills will not be hard to climb he never promised a victory without fighting but said help would always come in time so remember when you standing in the valley of decision and the says throw in the tower just hold on how God will show up and he will take you to the fire again hallelujah praise the Lord amen just hold on Amen like that woman with a with with a blood issue she never had a precedent amen uh that says Touch the Hem of His Garment she went from Doctor to doctor the Medical Aid was expired there was no more Insurance left and then she heard there a man called Jesus he heals the blinded heart eyes amen he heals the broken heart am sets the captain free Hallelujah makes the blame to lame to walk again amen amen Jesus Christ Hallelujah and when she got there you know where Christ is there's always a crowd and and then she's look there look there there was no way and then she went on her knees Hallelujah Faith amen went into action can only touch the of his and Jesus Stood Still who touched me and Paul you know Peter but Lord how can you ask such a question how many everybody touching you says Peter shut up you don't understand that was a special touch for I perceive that virtue had left me Hallelujah tonight you can touch him such way bring him to a stand and he'll say I felt that virtue had left me amen amen Hallelujah you know she reminds me of that woman that Mexican woman she had heard from a neighbor she was a Catholic by the way she heard that there was some dead people that was raised and some blind people Fai coming by hearing not Rumors heing by the word of God and saw a little child had died oh but on the inside there was something that stirred hallelujah amen if God can do it for them God can do it for me oh my she took that baby in the rain wrapped that child Walken when she got to to the the meeting it was crowded there was a line of uh deacons and Ashes can't get you she reminded me in our country we play a game called rugby it's almost like Hallelujah I can see where that baby she wanted to go yet they blocking there but ah Hallelujah she C such a stir that the news got to brother what's happening down there oh there's a woman with a child H praise the Lord amen amen and we know the story amen the baby was healed you see but it needed some desperation it needed some action it needed to believe that there is a possibility hallelujah amen many people oh maybe when she gets to back to the the village with her baby oh my baby healed uh uh oh praise the Lord but they don't know what you went through through the through the C pumped by the but she was persistent you left some challenges but go all the way amen amen says in the churches book unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to rain what a paradox you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift Hallelujah a man without character can't rain because character apart from Power without character is satanic but Power with character to rule and since he wants to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and sit down on the father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary sufferings we go through now worthy to be compared with the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh brother sister the th the test the rejection the T death brother sister oh god brother sister is first wanting you to overcome so you can sit with him what are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through tribulation Hallelujah is this thinking not strange concerning the firey trials that are to try you that is what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering amen it's you know it's it's an oxymoron amen suffering but there's glory on there it's a contradiction it's a paradox it's how you know one minister in our church once preached a message the image of the invisible God that doesn't make sense image invisible the and I you know I thought about that and then the penny dropped I said that's how God operat [Music] I can imagine the day when Isaiah was told pick up your [Music] pen a virgin shall conceive uh excuse me excuse me Lord a virgin sh I don't think the prophet doubted anything no you see prophets realize it's their job to write down it's God's job to perform it don't try and help God hallelujah hallelujah amen God's word will not return unto him void it will accomplish the purpose it was sent for hallelujah oh my look at this he says now a Christlike character comes to suffering he says no sir we all have Tri we are alled Chas one but goes through that the church is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it isn't of [Music] God W that's profound that God wants you to suffer that God wants you to be challenged oh but he says when the enemy comes like a flood he will raise a standard oh praise God hallelujah amen amen it says for to you Philippians 1: he says for for to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him but also for to suffer for his sick and so many of us hasn't heard all these scriptures you know I I when I uh uh when we get new candidates for baptism people they decide they want to follow Jesus they give give their heart to the Lord so I tell them you know you know what you're letting yourself Ino This Is War that's why Paul says put on the whole armor of God hallelujah amen says This Is War amen be challenging it's not a flowy bed of e so you got to know go in here with a A sound mind you see so unfortunately uh especially among the uh Prosperity Gospel crowd we are told God is a good God God wants to bless you and I have no problem with it God wants to bless us you know if you come to our church you'll get a new milk you may get a husband that you desire might get promotion at work and I always tell our church seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness all the other things will be added unto you be faithful in the little and then God uh put you in line for the fringe benefits so these other things are are the addir on but but seek first the kingdom of God Hallelujah there's nothing wrong with God there God has blessed our sister with a lovely car and God has blessed a good job and all of those things are part of our work but I believe also God says you know uh we have to be faithful stewards and God gives each one of us according to our several ability God knows our capacity and he gives one one Talent other want two talents other want three talents don't be upset with God only give me two gives him five no no no no no don't or maybe you from the outside you watch out oh he's got 10 but he was faithful with the five maybe he started with with with one and the one became two and the two became four and he got the one from the the lazy one and the five became 10 you see his glory but you don't know his story many times people look at the church and the church is flourishing hallelujah it's back beautiful buing that's why God is not interested in caral comparisons you don't know what went in the sweat and the tears and the sacrifices you know in the initial stages aart puts in more than what he gets out so this is not a financial thing that you transaction trying to see there a good return on investment you know working for the lord it's long hours but the retirement benefit is out of this world hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord amen God Amen uh Timothy says two if we suffer we shall also reign with him amen if we deny he will also deny us hallelujah amen so if you want to rain suffer while amen amen Matthew tells us uh 25 and the Lord said unto him well done now good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over few things I will make the ruler over many things into the joy of the Lord and if you watch that Parable uh all of them got the same reward except the the The Lazy oneish enter into the joys that has been prepared for you hallelujah amen let's go back to Joseph amen the Bible says in Genesis 39:21 the Lord was with Joseph Hallelujah all the trials through all the tests but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave gave him favor in the sight of The Keeper of the prison Hallelujah so God wants us to be faithful hallelujah amen I don't know about the time almost 9 already should we okay let let's get to a close hallelujah amen Hebrew says but be not slothful [Music] but be followers but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises amen this Christian walk is about patience AB the father of Faith 25 years and the Bible says Abram staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief was strong giving God the praise he looked beyond hallelujah amen because it says God is able amen even when he came to the end of the road when he had to offer up Isaac he had to destroy his testimony I like what he told he says uh to the servants he says I and the lead will return Hallelujah that's Faith praise the Lord how he's going to do it not my business gave him to me when it was impossible I can almost think that morning when he uh told Isaac tomorrow we got an appointment he never told he never told his wife where you thinking my son oh man praise the Lord Romans 5 3 says not only so but we glory in Tribulation also knowing that tribulation work with patience patience experience experience hope and hope make it not as shame because the love of God is shed Upon Our brought in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us amen amen Hebrews 121 also tells us we for seeing that we are compassed about with so great cloud of witnesses now this morning this evening I didn't come to preach deep things I don't have any deep things I'm here to recycle these promises Hallelujah because this is our our daily challenges that we've that's where we live Hallelujah just to give you some arsenals when you face the enemy you can draw off says amen hallelujah there was Joseph there was David oh I almost forgot one of you know the greatest compliment ever there was a man called job and God bragged on job he said have you considered myant joke there no one like him what a compliment oh I hope God says that about me have you considered my servant David have you considered my servant Samantha H praise the Lord amen devil say you got a hedge around him you've been blessing him said do what you want and we know what Beil job his children killed cattled his houses end he was ending up with with Bo sitting there scratching himself but the Bible says in all these things job never judged God foolishly and he says the lord giveth and the Lord take bless be the name of the Lord and I think God blessed job with one of the greatest Revelations ever where God I know Hallelujah I know you better get some I know in your vocabulary I know hallelujah amen God opened a a seal for job and the resurrection Hallelujah and that's why Abra wased was buried Sarah was buried was bued Hallelujah God showed him a resurrection praise God oh amen and that's why amen don't bury me in Egypt Hallelujah Jose said amen amen God is coming to visit you with a mighty hand hallelujah praise the Lord amen wherefor seeing we are compassed with such a great God of w let's lay aside every weight and sin that so so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that he said before us go and do yourself a favor go and read the book of James my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations Joy James what you talking about knowing this that the trying of your faith work with patience amen but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect an entire one thing nothing Amen in the message love says no wonder Paul could stand in the face of death and say oh death where's your sting your victory sure through tribulations he had learned the love of God suffing patience it works tribulations to bring patience of course now patience makes love amen he say he say how can I wait any longer he says just keep on waiting when you've done all you can to stand then stand know man seven times but he gets up how am I going to do it stand he said it's the truth and it is the truth he said it will happen how I don't know but it will happen he said so God said so he promised it amen if he promised it it's going to happen that's all it can't waste amen hallelujah and then Joseph hallelujah what a what a what a a crowning of his of his walk and The Keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's H all the prisoners that were in their prison and whatsoever said did they did there he was the doer of it and the Prisoner and the keep of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him and did the Lord made it to prosper oh my brother my sister if the Lord is with you Hallelujah it will prosper amen amen God says I've got good thoughts about you not harm you not to oppress you but to get you to an expected end ah and Pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this a man in whom the spirit of God is and Pharaoh said unto Joseph for as much as God had showed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou art thou shall be over my house according unto Thy word shall all my people be ruled only the be greater than now hallelujah oh my you know I can imagine that when Joseph eventually unveiled himself to his Brethren they said oh oh now we in trouble what we ploted what we did to him and Joseph said no don't be don't worry am I God what you meant for evil God turned into good amen he says in verse 4138 he says but for you you thought evil against me but God oh my oh my God but God made it un good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive so God is using us he's molding us he's trying us because he's got a plan and a purpose Hallelujah to bring much people alive Hallelujah you know the Bible says the whole creation is groing in is waiting you know when you walk past the tree saying how long how long get tuned into the right uh Channel amen because the Bible says the whole creation is growing we see Earth we see Volcan these things have been happening but the the severity and the intensity is just getting to another level you know over the last year if you look at the the Quakes in in in California you know what was so profound for me I think was the beginning of last year in January last year on the anniversary of the picture of of the PO of fire the very same day you know speaks about 3 minutes midnight this the D clock it was mve from 30 seconds I mean from 3 minutes to 90 seconds the closest it has ever been and on the same day that this was uh the anniversary of the picture is when they announced that because it was the war in Ukraine it was all the different conflict so how late is the hour oh my brothers the prophet is at one stage I can almost see that angel standing there saying time shall be no more Hallelujah so Brothers it's it's later than what we think I me the bride has got to get itself ready you know things can happen overnight remember how many uh prophecies were fulfilled in those last few hours on on the Lord on the amen multiple prophecies in matter of hours so don't I want to see this happen I want to see that crash I want to see no we want to be gone when these things happen you don't want to be around Hallelujah as we close Amen in the P Vision says Don't Fear John don't Fe little flock all that I am you are a too all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word I will perform it that is my Covenant and it can never fail so where are we standing Church H there is a people in the land who come to that realization of who she is and the prophet says she'll be an invincible Army when the bride realizes who she is the act go Hallelujah but I see how the Antichrist spirit is coming defiling the CH making it lukewarm gold and Hallelujah but there will be a people in the land will be the final voice to the final age Hallelujah If Not Us Then Who hallelujah it's time that we write our story hallelujah oh praise the Lord amen God has left the best for last you know I there's been a a group of people in the days of
