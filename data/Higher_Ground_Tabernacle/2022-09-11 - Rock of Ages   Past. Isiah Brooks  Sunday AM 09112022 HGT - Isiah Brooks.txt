of y'all got half smiles and that's better than no smiles so we'll take what we can get this morning you know uh one thing we we know is that god has given us the victory and no matter what we've gone through uh have gone through the end results will will will set everything in order uh one thing for certain jewels is so thrown you can't be victorious if you fear the enemy hallelujah amen i don't want to go too far because i get into my service so we're going to ask for the keith come and give us a testimony by the grace of god good morning i didn't know this was gonna happen until about five o'clock this morning the holy spirit woke me and before i knew it i was on the floor flat on my face and it was a good place to be do we like that amen the lord instructed me this morning i think what he would have me say and i'm going to just be slow and move with him everything that i do and word indeed lord jesus christ amen amen i think sometimes we do we make this way too complicated your testimonies are to be abundant when we stop and think about the word careful to tell us [Music] what is the kingdom of can we say amen we're going to seek first kingdom and that was one of the first things that when i was first saved [Music] not in that church but on my way to the business meetings in new jersey my wife will tell you that i can't be changed i am professed for christianity what she sees is not me jesus christ the holy spirit that is quickening in me your daughter's name is it darby um what's her name she she was getting caught up in the spirit and she said on the spree and she would then start dancing and she would start clapping [Music] anyhow i i moved on to des moines and uh the lord eventually led me out of that pentecostal church anywhere that i knew i was going you just haven't stayed no minus three and the other employees and johnson uh johnston did that having people call me where was i [Music] worship services self-easter on life and more people came and we had several that came from down in louisiana some from ohio to ohio brother isaiah and he brought his family i think what i said and he came to live the i was supposed to be in business and i went to des moines gathered my understanding of i was supposed to proceed on back to ohio my mother very ill i had been in and out of my well she uh i asked her if we could pray so she should be after she's looking over my shoulder and i looked over there and brother isaiah came on the scene and i said no he's a pastor i mean sister ruby sister ruby they came to seek out some of you my family and so i got that look from her again that she was looking over my shoulder also i got this i looked over there lo and behold a woman and a man in my estimation knew nobody that was black small town they came in but my mom and sister roberto we're he said preacher i said it seemed like i've known you all my life i'm sure i'm still here as you see and he's my pastor and i explained to him my mother had some fear going on right so i asked him if you would like to lead in prayer she was cognitive and conscious and she understood what i was saying if we could move her from her bed where she's been for a week [Music] yes my mother [Music] um lou lou wilkins august that's good okay thank you um and my mother said give my marriage [Music] [Applause] seek first the kingdom of god is really very simple and that's me today i had a time the lord wanted me to better identify myself amongst us have some thought about who i am god has there's many many stories like that my encouragement is to seek first we can do this this is not hard but if you got a little bit of a stubbornness it seems like that did you test don't dissolve that to hold a spot it turns you around 180 degrees so if you weren't doing it you decided to do it [Music] so what are we going to do is the holy spirit moving [Music] [Music] and if you feel like getting out in the inner parts of there's a largest alligator in the world i looked at the internet this morning that alligator the denominator nominated is [Music] that's a healing see like you've got a healing you need in your body anybody out there anybody need the lord jesus see i uh embrace all that god has for us amen amen praise god [Applause] [Music] amen amen we truly thank god for our brother keith i can remember that day as though it was yesterday i can remember when i gave brother keith his first church age books and i prayed hard that god would give him the revelation and god did you see not everything no man can boast that's one thing i love about brother keith he gives god the glory i call that roger amen strong winds are blowing with an unrelenting force people running to and fro they don't know what's going on [Music] men's hearts are failing because of turmoil in the land church doors are closing preachers just can't take a stand but it's gonna take a stronger wind than this to keep me from my promises it's gonna take a stronger wind than this to turn me around it's gonna take a stronger wind in this because my feet [Music] solid ground people are searching for the true and living god [Music] there's a famine in the land the world seems null and void [Music] they have eyes but cannot see they have ears but cannot hear if they only knew the scripture they'll know that jesus christ is here but it's gonna take a stronger win than this [Music] to keep me from my promises it's gonna take a stronger wind than this to turn me around it's gonna take a stronger wind in this because my feet are on solid ground people are living no different than the world claiming to know the lord but truly serving other gods [Music] they call on him both day and night but the truth they can't life anointed one in the end time jesus christ is gonna take a stronger than this to keep me from my promises is gonna take a stronger wind than this to turn me around it's gonna take a stronger wind than this because my feet are on solid ground i'ma sing that verse again [Music] people are living no different than the world claiming to know the lord by truly serving other gods [Music] they call on him both day and night but they don't produce a life anointed once in the end times rejecting the lord jesus christ but [Music] to turn me around it's gonna take a stronger wind and this to keep this ego down to keep me from my promises it's gonna take a stronger [Music] because my feet solid crown [Music] amen amen for those uh who speak swahili and you need you need an interpreter you need whatever's mike we're limited [Music] but we can get you uh a headset and move the near um you have to share it with someone about this very good if you need a headset could you raise your hand okay brother here [Music] we really appreciate your patience we thank god for his uh grace toward us in the midst of all the things that we go through um we must always recognize that our lord is faithful if you trust him yes that song says one of the things that we do not want is to be held in bondage because jesus christ is here to set you up i liked what brother keith said about that alligator and he had no idea of what uh what he was saying other than testifying but i know that in your spirit if you're not someone who breaks up brotherhood and and our righteousness has come by way of him amen and i thank god for that the bible said contain for the faith that means we're supposed to fight for it you can let the battle overtake you or you can overtake the battle as we preach not long ago when david saw the giant when he heard the boasting of goliath he took the battle to the giants we as christian we don't run from a battle i don't run from and if you stand with the words the word will places there's already 10 minutes of six minutes to eleven uh all right as we stand let us turn to matthew the tenth chapter one service on service the next time we have communion i might keep you after 12. so we can have communion because some of you all don't know what communion is okay so thank hey man did you hear that brother keith this was that was oh was that you and somebody else by the grace of god i didn't hear a lot of amen you know one thing about communion what it does it helps you clean yourself cleanse yourself you're damned if you do without making it right and you're damned if you don't do people understand what communion is when you are afraid of communion when you don't come to communion you're literally declaring that you are not a christian you're telling me you're living your two two lives or three lives maybe four but we know it's not just one you love the lord amen as we stand let us turn to matthew 10. we're going to read the 34th verse starting at the thirty-fourth verse from zone matthew's the tenth chapter i love the word of god it is my bread see starting at the 34th verse of the 10th chapter think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law god [Music] he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me he that finds his life shall lose it and he that loses his life for matthew 16 matrices says we'll read the 18th and the 19th verse of matthew 16. and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven [Music] in abundance in grace the glass lord we pray this morning that you look beyond our faults lord we commit the service into your hands but our enemy is the adversary i pray father god this morning lord they'll reach down that you would reach down did you please fulfill this take that we are jesus christ's name you and i must understand who's the one component that we're living in a dangerous time we're at a time in history where men hate each other without a call uh we know by god's grace that satan always know how to divide but this is not a time of division this is a time of union the only way that we'll be able to understand i can wash and god put that heart in there he dropped the sister girl because he wanted it to be his personal job you and i must realize that we're living at a time where the deception of the devil is greater now than ever i could really tell you some stories where people were being led by the devil and they thought they were being led by god but thank god for the revelation of this message message i was thinking about the church the other day and i was thinking about uh i was thinking on behalf of all the people here and i was wondering how many people in this church really knows jesus christ as your personal savior [Music] [Applause] a wolf with sheep clothing you are identifiable by your character hallelujah this is the age of the capstone of the faith this is the age of divine love this is the age that god see it's uncovering the devil's tactics hallelujah [Applause] when you stand for the truth of the world he wants you to let down your guard no matter what the devil says about him hallelujah right see why the thing that gets me like is because the bible says that the enemy will be someone in your own house hallelujah enemies in the world they don't bother us but when they church when they come to church [Applause] is that when confusion comes in the church i have eight children and maybe i always say one and a half i'll say it like there's two serving the lord who earned himself according to the revelation of the message they believe that they are doing the right thing even though they've been taught the message they never had a message of birth you know you understand me what you are experienced if you was a baptist you can't bring that here you see you got to have more than that hello if he was a methodist you can't did not like i said on wednesday excuse me one thing i love about the pentecostals they moved into the spirit they moved into the anointing hallelujah of their age hallelujah but that's not the anointing of the day the unknown [Music] by allowing ourselves to live the vivo you must die to your old husband i if he was a methodist you got to die if he was baptist you got to die and you got to be born again you got to come into a place with your ultimate goal if you see christ hallelujah come on somebody and understand this you see this way is not an easy way social media memphis hello y'all getting quiet on me this way it's not an easy way because i'm going to tell you something god would raise up devils juve elevate the demonstr you can't compromise with sin you've got to stand for the truth if it means you must suffer jesus said if you suffer with me you will reign with me is to accuse you to one another but this person don't like me that person don't like me and look how they look at me my question is i can see her how are you looking come on when you looked at them you know one thing i hate you when somebody said why are you staring at me and i would say how would you know come on should i say that i was staring at you if you wasn't staring at me yeah i understand what i'm saying we fail to see this but we're not fighting flesh and blood build your wickedness is everybody paying attention let me say it like this hallelujah let me say it like this this one is to see you remember the parable about forgiveness and instead of forgiving this one person [Music] hallelujah amen why because he had been forgiven much [Music] [Music] neither will i forgive you that's what communion is about communion is testifying i have forgiven my brother and i'm washing and i'm [Applause] you say you got jesus on the inside of his real world but jesus was crucified for you crucified [Music] he was beaten he was bruised he was spat upon on that victim this is not even my message but i'm going there anyhow and guess what they pierced him historian says this is that he was so badly beaten that he forgive them for they know not what they do that's what divine love does because we realized satan is the accuser satan see you like you saturn how many times how many of you been accused by satan today and he's constantly con you know say the devil don't scare me the judgment no spirit of the devil scares me and he tells me straight up what it is immediately i bind that devil that devil has to go she jumped up back to you no evil oh come on shall come nigh my dwelling place hallelujah and you understand me you know you need to live the righteous life you need to know where it's coming from but the problem is when you are afraid of the devil he knows it did you listen you know why i'm not afraid of your question because i know who i am now i'm not calling anybody in here the devil don't you listen i'm calling anybody here today i'm talking i'm talking about devils spiritual enemies this enemy spiritually hallelujah but i want you to know the devil accuses some of y'all might agree with that but the devil also tells me the devil do you see you're not a son of god sometimes the devil said you don't have the holy ghost before the death determined by the sentence plea and what i'm going to say because you're so right no no [Music] of who i am you love the lord you see if you are eternal how many of y'all know you're eternal you can raise your hand don't be afraid you can raise your hand how many people [Applause] so there is no fear in this dimension [Applause] um when he met abraham coming from the slaughter of the kings considered [Music] [Music] and while levi was in the lawns of his great-grandfather talk about eternal life hallelujah that's why brother branham said it like this every victory jesus did jacques victor you were there amen every victory every time he whipped the devil you were there whipping him with him yeah i understand what i'm saying so i'm i'm bringing this thing to you hello what but the revelation of jesus christ [Applause] [Applause] y'all act like y'all don't know what i'm talking about y'all know what i'm all i know is it is the darkest of all days hallelujah but god chose you you understand me he told you for this day hallelujah captain he's the mighty warrior he's the one who defeated satan so he places himself in you let the lord fight your battles hallelujah you see that's what the devil can't stand well thank god for william branham he spoke a word and he said that the bride of jesus christ will never be denominated hallelujah he didn't say people following the yes hallelujah we thought acts 2 38 [Laughter] [Music] and is [Laughter] because you cannot do it [Music] [Music] important it is important that we listen to those tapes read your word with it hallelujah it's not a separate word it's a revelation of the word is that's true you got to come you got to read those books by way of prayer you got to listen to your tapes by way of prayer [Music] you got to ask god to deliver you first hallelujah you want these things to be added into your life hallelujah you allowed bitterness to get in you know you those things will hinder your growth won't block you oh yes sir we miss you you let all this gossip come to your ear you are not a trash can hallelujah you are the bride of jesus christ who's this is a priesthood and this is your battle people come to you with gossip if see you gotta ought against your brother you go to your brother not to your neighbor come on somebody if you're gonna do the word do it all right to take the cover off the devil um [Music] [Applause] [Music] and if you think brother brooks is just preaching this just to be preaching it no no no no this is what's coming from god hallelujah amen now peter tells us now how many let me say like this how many how when have you the last you've had victory worrying about you don't do you understand me you know what i do besides your family i take it to the lord hallelujah amen because when i figure i can't fix it i how many y'all want to make you won't make it [Music] in elementary school a little uh grade school every year you had to take a test shock factor a new saving [Music] when you don't pass the test you can't go forward until you pass the test i was here wednesday for those of you who weren't here i was at the atm atm uh uh checking on my uh account and while i was at the uh i heard somebody bump their horn at me and i was i was leaving the atm atm so i thought maybe did i leave my car she was actually saying did i leave something there well i got out of the car and this man began to curse me out just curse me would you say there's no way i could say what he said but in my head i can hear it but what came out of me what's the thing that surprised me all i could say was god bless you sir god bless you sir god bless you sir and i said to him sir i can't move no faster then the machine allows hallelujah and and when i went back in and got back in my car he still was cursing he's continuing after i said god bless you but the thing that got me man because i was confused the first thing i asked the lord was what did i do you deserve this you see and as i rolled around the bank yeah he doesn't know what he's doing and i'm sure he didn't mean it you just think you could because there was a time i may have said god bless you but all the hairs on my neck would have been standing up mentally alive i hope you all understand this is what the danger is with you and everyone you cannot talk to each other any kind of way without raising eight children elevate we don't fall the kids would get in trouble lisa because i knew by whipping both of them secondly i was going to get the right one and then the innocent one song was going to come back and say but daddy i didn't do it what i'm saying see what i'm trying to say is because i don't have concerns i had to use the right the the the the only means i could use it to bring the truth out but see that's how god is i'm trying to find out where i should preach from she said because i want you to understand that god will always prevail now if we're going to brother brandon said each one of these virtues is victory amen if you like in temperance you're going to be tried if you like patience you're going to get into uh and how many of us know that you you in a rush you're speeding when you know you shouldn't be speeding and what are they doing we don't realize that god is protecting us can i go further i won't see the bible said but if that if he that lacketh these things but he the ninth verse but he that lacketh these things i'm back to peter okay but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins purification [Applause] give diligence [Music] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ hallelujah it is the key you see like that god used peter to express to us how many y'all people came straight to the message and you bypassed the cross you never went to calvary you never asked god to cleanse you from your sins hello because that's what they say if you believe the message that's all you need that's the baptist doctrine that is filtrated into the message it's more than believing the message i hope this is a blessing to you jesus second corinthians seven and one people y'all might as well just wait because i'm not gonna stop until i'm dead stop until i'm done second corinthians having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit [Music] that to underst to me stay clear everything that's wicked on facebook stay clear on your should i call that a monitor or tv it all depends on where you want to use it which way you want to use it y'all understand what i'm trying to say do y'all feel my heart what do y'all think i'm doing do you feel my heart i speak these things in love i'm not fighting nobody i'm fighting the devil diablo i'm taking the battle to the devil just like just like david took the battle to goliath but i know one thing god gave david the victory and god will always give us the victory there's not a person in here i don't love and care for yeah so don't ever think that i'm i'm i'm partial in something different one thing for certain and i pray god in my life i'll never be a hypocrite no i don't want to be a hypocrite if i'm doing something wrong i have nothing to gain the only thing i want is eternal life you can't give me enough money you you you you can't you god can't be bought you understand what i'm trying to say there's nothing you can do for me but pray for me people more you gotta understand i'm not like other pastors or pastor one thing they prayed in this church when they told me i was one five years five years keith said to me you're going to be my pastor in iowa i literally laughed at him i had no desire see we're not under the covenant of law i can say listen don't do this don't do this don't do that and you could do those things i tell you not to do it if we felt the dimensions see that was the pharisees the pharisees did everything right the part they forgot was the heart they was religious but inside they weren't converted but let me tell you something this moment there's a lot of devils in the pulpit yeah just bear with me now i'll let you go by 12 we got it's 11 46 now uh yeah i'm sorry yeah it it comes from um god only provided place of worship there's so you know what i'm trying to get you to excuse you said i know a lot of people in here you've been in the message for a long time you know the conduct in order you you you know you know what brother brandon said so let's go for rmd but my point is this girl like brother keith said how many of you have joy combined in doing this how many you really love being a christian i enjoy being a christian i have no shame about being a christian everywhere i go i want them to know i'm a christian paragraph 77 the park of septon sits he says i want you to notice again there was also two covenants give yeah um you don't have that it may be more than one 11-28 brother one covenant was given to adam which was conditions if you will not touch this then you would live but if you touch this [Applause] [Applause] who is christ himself jesus christ see it's not how bad i can be you know how good i can be but it is unmerited favor toward me toward me because amen i have saved you and your seed after you amen that is a type of calvary now you might say brother booked how will i know with the fabulous commercial sorry i got the holy ghost first of all you're gonna have love in your heart hey you'll be able to love your enemies listen people y'all think y'all the only one who have suffered at the hands of christians oh my god all you need to do is be a pastor ambassador and you'll understand what i'm talking about if there be anybody who feel like you can do it better i'll give you a good month or more i give you a good month and let's see how you do with it but let's go to the the 79th verse because i'm trying to get you listen this is the thought it comes to my mind yeah don't want to speak there are so many pentecostals who died thinking they had the holy ghost and they were lost is it belgium you understand what i'm saying there are a lot of messaged people who have died thinking they had the holy ghost and they did not in in a viper hello you said what i i believe god sent a prophet john von prophates so did the millions come out of egypt they didn't have to believe it hallelujah the bible said they had two their spirits were different that's what i'm saying brother preached one in a million hallelujah you gotta understand this is a narrow way in a narrow way and the bible tells us only a few be that finds it that means you got to search justified you got a dig in there if you think hard times are now give us a few more days down the road and produce it's going to get hard all over the world [Applause] he said we had better be very careful now now let us lay us out our traditions this morning sunday schools lessons and be sure that we find that one place [Music] church who is his church jesus the bible said by one spirit are we baptized into one body that one body is the church of christ it's the church of god that's the as a christian are you going to suffer as a devil either way you're going to suffer but there's one suffering that will reward you at the end precious [Music] do you worship me teaching the god for doctrines the commandment of man or their denominational creed is it sincere just as religious as they could be [Applause] absolutely came in the same attitude was just as religious they both built altars they both love god they both sacrificed feel sacrifices both done everything just like they don't fit able by faith which is the revelation the word of god revealed made the offering you can have if you know god didn't vindicate it by the true channel see give me this last one this morning and then i'll let you go there's another quote but we must meet the conditions of the day as i said the lutherans got into the spirit of luther god in the spirit of that those who believe in malachi 4 you understand me if you start listening to brother branham even after 63. and you begin to see the change in his ministry and he began to talk more with the bride and what she's supposed to do how great she's supposed to be and then he goes into how god was why do you think god gave him those things this is true this wasn't just to make brother branham feel good he was supposed to lay on the tape for the bride so that she can see that this the jesus jehovah of old testament jesus christ of the news and she's got to enter into that you're going to say you can't you can't go into this condition any kind of [Applause] no no no you won't get there so in order of us to go in behind the curtains you got to be justified sanctified [Music] now let me say this in closing in in the message god's only valid place of worship 11 28 um yeah november november yeah yeah uh dude thank you for your patience merciful hallelujah now think hello these men well why was they called and was put in this condition these pharisees by jesus said in vain you worship me worship him genuine worship true worship from their heart you worship me teaching for the doctrine the tradition of men the traditions they are supposed to hallelujah is that right even when brother branham said he wanted three squirrels and he just took the one squirrel and he was getting ready to leave he needed to pray the angel said to brother branham but i see when you ask god for something be specific swipe specifically and hold to it absolutely absolutely more tests will come the trials will come the devil will come and try to shake you from what you believe [Music] put it on the park with the looses and shields it will hatch it's the warmness the condition that makes it hatch the conditions so it was to be under conditions [Applause] two men don't sit there and this church is just dead and cold there is no worship and there is no praise and you don't bring the warmth of the holy ghost in here i don't care if there is elect seed in here they'll never hatch because you have produced the wrong condition basically atmosphere hallelujah well that's the way it is in this age that we're living in don't you care you've got to find what is god's way of doing it for this age that's [Music] i'm almost done my heart goes out for those of you tired i know some of you guys just came from work and all that but but i'm almost done i'm almost done now the pentecostal that brother i believe one of his eyes was out a colored brother who really started the pentecostal message in california because he was a negro pascal he was made funner but he brought a message for that age fellow couldn't hardly sign his own name but the lord but everybody [Applause] in the world you don't that killed it wasn't it goes right on see so that's important then they started separating yes and making denominations now you know what i'm trying to say if you don't say these kind of words and when they did that he lost his own faith right there so more solution that's the prophet's message hallelujah it is so amazing you see how we want to put people in and out of heaven when we don't have a message we don't have a heaven to put them in and now they met here and your pastor can't guarantee you heaven the holy ghost guarantees you the sentence hallelujah but then when he went and pinned it down right it was literally on francina shoes let me jump back up then they started separating this that they're making denominations and one coming on a cloud and we're doing the same thing because right oh we're still having problems with the clouds we're still having a problem with the the literal body coming up we have all these issues what the focus is you need to be born again the focus is mercy lord god this is my last quote god's own provided place of worship paragraph 102. it's your love to god you see vodka lord i don't care what you want me to do i'm willing to do it then you're getting somewhere but if you don't do it that way the way he said do it coming see it's his choosing the place i have chosen that's where you worship with your sacrifices and that's what people don't understand god chose this message the bloody bleeding word for this day as a place of worship come on you can't read it like a newspaper or hand it like an intellectual something where you're just going to learn everything brother branham said intellectually and you're not going to do it you know it's true so why people will fight you over things that brother adam says he didn't say it but one thing he did say come to church a half hour early i'm gonna always get you on that one until you get it he did say come on now some of y'all i know you can't make it i'm not talking but i'm talking to those guys amen uh whoever it may be they're late right there [Music] i have children they just don't know how to be on time my natural children myself they go to work late and then get mad at the boss it's just going to the boss for saying something you're coming like what you're they'll know they have to be to work at six o'clock six a.m they won't leave the house to 6 a.m it's gonna be a i understand some of y'all can't make it on time and that's okay i'm not working with you don't let the devil fight your neck it's and that's okay i needed it hallelujah you know it's it's amazing but i i say this to all of us all that's been said don't let the devil think municipalities i don't care where you came from i believe in all of you and i do believe your bride i wouldn't be preaching my heart out like this if i didn't hallelujah people said well you know you always have three kind of believers i don't know who they are i don't really want to know i want to preach to everybody like they bribe you understand me because i want to see everybody make it but i can't do it on my own each and every one of us has to take on that responsibility if you're going to be in the church if you're going to be part of the church like i preach on on wednesday i think that's recorded right brother y'all go listen to that tape on investment i'm talking about your prayer i'm talking about making friends i felt this i mean with each other right i'm making peace with each other invest in this church to make this a supernatural church right now we're leaning more toward the canality of of the message and so to help you you'll see one of the things you're going to have to overcome is the spirit of gossip is amen amen amen it's true it's killing the church people taking sides the holy spirit is sensitive and for those of us who spread it [Music] [Applause] no people people look i want y'all to look around and look at this and i want you to see now we we've got every kind of uh different face shapes different different skin tones we've because the spiritual relationship between us and god it's greater than this you see you understand me it's greater than this you see let us bow our gracious father we come before you we thank you for your amazing lord grace know my heart it's enough and i will stand in judgment the things in which i said did not come from a pure heart but as far as i know i mean i said i spoke the words this morning out of a pure heart i pray father god that you bless the hearer of the word we're talking about spiritual wickedness in high places [Music] you're the only one that can bring change i can preach and preach until i fall dead and the words that preach can oh [Music] oh dear amen amen the presence [Music] of [Music] god oh my god [Music] in the presence [Music] let's raise our hands to the lord [Music] [Music]
