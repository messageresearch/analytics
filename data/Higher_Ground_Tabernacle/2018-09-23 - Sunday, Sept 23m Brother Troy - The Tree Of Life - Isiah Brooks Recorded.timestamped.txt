[30:32] upon the face of the deep and the Spirit
[30:36] of God moved upon the face of the waters

[30:43] chapter 8
[31:05] verbs chapter 8 we'll start with the
[31:07] 22nd verse it's a long read all the way
[31:09] to the end of the chapter it says the
[31:14] Lord possessed me in the beginning of
[31:16] his way before his works of old I was
[31:20] set up from everlasting from the
[31:22] beginning or ever the earth was when
[31:25] there was no depths I was brought forth
[31:27] when there was no Fountains abounding
[31:29] with water before the mountains were
[31:32] settled before the hills was I brought
[31:34] forth while as yet he had not made the
[31:37] earth nor the fields nor the highest
[31:39] part of the dust of the world when he
[31:42] prepared the heavens I was there when he
[31:45] said a compass upon the face of the
[31:47] depth when he established the clouds
[31:50] above well he strengthened the Fountains
[31:52] of the deep when he gave to the sea his
[31:55] decree that the waters should not pass
[31:56] his commandment when he appointed the
[31:59] foundations of the earth then I was by
[32:01] him as one brought up with him
[32:04] I was daily his delight rejoicing always
[32:08] before him rejoicing in a habitable part
[32:11] of the earth my delights were with the
[32:14] sons of men now therefore hearken unto
[32:16] me o ye children for blessed are they
[32:19] that keep my ways hear instruction and
[32:22] be wise and refused or not blessed is

[32:31] my doors for whoso findeth me find if
[32:35] life and shall obtain favor of the Lord
[32:38] but he that sinneth against me wrong
[32:42] with his own soul and all they that hate
[32:45] me love death a may well one more

[33:21] the Father and of the Son and of the
[33:24] Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all
[33:27] things whatsoever I have commanded you
[33:29] and lo I am with you always even unto
[33:32] the end of the world maybe let's just
[33:36] bow our heads in a word of Prayer

[33:43] that you have ordained us to have a
[33:46] service this morning father

[33:53] gathered in your name Lord that you will

[34:39] morning Lord in the name of Jesus Christ
[34:41] we pray amen amen you can be seated
[34:46] Amen I want to speak this morning on the
[34:49] Tree of Life
[34:50] you know if you remember that when God
[34:53] created the heavens and the earth that
[34:55] he created a garden called Eden Eden
[34:59] amen and in this garden he placed a
[35:01] treat
[35:02] he called this tree The Tree of Life
[35:06] amen and known when when when God first
[35:10] began
[35:13] creation he there's two things that he
[35:16] did before the creation I know I spoke
[35:18] of several times before he created the
[35:21] heavens and the earth there was a couple
[35:23] things that he did beforehand amen and
[35:26] before he created the heavens and the
[35:27] earth he he he wrote a book called life
[35:30] amen and he put names on on that book
[35:34] amen and when he created that book of
[35:37] life he took a lamb and he's slaying its
[35:39] LeWitt before the foundation of the
[35:41] world for those names Amen so that
[35:43] before time ever began before one second
[35:47] of time ever began before there was ever
[35:48] one sunrise amen before before one tree
[35:52] ever sprouted amen God made sure that
[35:54] there were that those names that were
[35:56] upon that book called life would have
[35:58] would be sure a man that there be a
[36:01] sacrifice for them that nothing could
[36:03] happen to those names a man it was
[36:05] decreed before the foundation of the
[36:07] world
[36:07] that those names would have the Lambs
[36:09] life amen and then all the the pathway
[36:12] was made sure that those names would get
[36:15] the life of the Lamb amen so when God
[36:17] began to create the heavens and the
[36:19] earth
[36:20] amen that the dearths had become dark
[36:23] and void amen and it was empty and it
[36:27] was flooded over with waters and there
[36:29] was no light and there was no land amen
[36:32] there was nowhere that anybody could
[36:34] have rest a man there's nowhere on the
[36:37] life that anybody can have peace amen it
[36:40] was full of darkness and waters had
[36:43] covered over the face of the whole earth
[36:45] hey man there was nowhere to put your
[36:47] feet they meant there is nowhere that
[36:50] anybody could find rest there was no
[36:53] light that you could take comfort in
[36:54] there is no warmth there amen
[36:58] no light no warmth no rest amen it was
[37:01] just there there was no place it was
[37:03] dark his form without form
[37:05] it was void there was no rest there and
[37:07] and and the Spirit of God began brooding
[37:11] over the face of the waters hey man you
[37:14] know God he he had a great desire down
[37:18] on the inside of them he had something
[37:20] that he had seen in his mind amen and as
[37:24] he was brood
[37:26] over the face of the waters there was
[37:28] nowhere that he could leave a mint
[37:31] there was this spirit was there he had
[37:34] desires down on the inside of him a mint
[37:37] he had something that he wanted to do
[37:39] but yet with all that Christ all that
[37:42] that Great Spirit wanted to do as he
[37:45] brooded over the face of the waters
[37:48] there was nowhere that his feet touch
[37:50] ground there is nowhere that he could
[37:54] take his rest there is nowhere that he
[37:56] could live and move and have his bean
[37:59] right amen
[38:00] there is just no where there was nowhere
[38:02] for him there was no light there there
[38:03] was no comfort there a man so is he
[38:06] brooded over the face of the earth
[38:08] he kept brooding he kept brooding and
[38:10] the desires they were on the inside of
[38:12] his mind he began to speak them out amen
[38:16] amen and God by his spoken word began to
[38:20] create a place that he could take
[38:23] comfort him Amen a place that he could
[38:26] enjoy a manatee and he began to separate
[38:30] the the land from the waters amen and he
[38:34] called the the dry land he called it
[38:37] Earth a man and he called the waters
[38:41] seas and he began to to to give the
[38:45] oceans their names and began to gave the
[38:47] land its name earth so now there's
[38:50] oceans and their seas than oh there's
[38:52] dry land and when God began to kept
[38:55] brooding and brooding and he said let
[38:57] there be light
[38:58] over all this same it as God he he as he
[39:02] saw the great darkness first he spoke he
[39:04] said let there be light
[39:06] I like the way God works amen
[39:10] you know there was a time that I was in
[39:12] darkness Amen I was you know I didn't
[39:15] know where I was going and God spoke and
[39:17] brought a light upon my path they said
[39:19] let there be and there was let there be
[39:21] and there was let there be and there was
[39:23] a man so as he kept brooding and
[39:26] brooding remember God what God when he
[39:29] created headon didn't just say let there
[39:33] be animals he spoke to the earth he said
[39:38] let
[39:38] the earth bring forth animals amen and
[39:41] when God when he wanted to create the
[39:43] fish he didn't just say let there be
[39:45] fish he spoke to the waters he said let
[39:48] the waters bring forth the fish Amen but
[39:52] when he wanted to create man he spoke he
[39:55] didn't speak to the earth
[39:56] Amen he didn't speak to the waters but
[39:59] he spoke to himself he said let us bring
[40:02] forth man in our own man image a man a
[40:06] windy and went man when he and his okay
[40:08] so the I saw as the fish began swimming
[40:11] in the sea a mint as he spoke to the
[40:14] earth let the earth bring forth all the
[40:15] plants a man and let the earth bring
[40:18] forth all the all the animals that are
[40:20] creeping on am a man and as he began
[40:21] created as they began going about there
[40:24] he says the Indies are the generations
[40:26] of the heavens and these are the
[40:28] generations of the earth these are all
[40:30] the things that the earth brought forth
[40:32] a man this is the gene that the God
[40:35] placed his word into the waters God
[40:38] placed his word into the dirt amen and
[40:41] the waters and the dirt began bringing
[40:42] forth that which what the Word of God
[40:45] was down on the inside bringing forth a
[40:48] mesh so that the DNA of God's Word
[40:51] starts sprouting up out of the waters
[40:53] amen and they eat in the waters bore
[40:56] forth the fishes and the whales and
[40:58] things are in the seas amen when God's
[41:00] DNA of his own word was there aught down
[41:03] on the inside of the earth it began
[41:05] spreaking forth that portion of the word
[41:09] that was allotted to it amen and those
[41:11] trees have their seed down on the inside
[41:13] of them and there are faithfully
[41:15] generating generation after generation
[41:18] after generation after generation and so
[41:22] are the fish to have their seed down on
[41:24] the inside of them are bearing fruit
[41:26] another generation after them and
[41:29] another generation after them and then
[41:31] continuing on with that DNA of God's own
[41:34] word that was placed down on the inside
[41:36] another generation and another
[41:39] generation but when God spoke to his own
[41:42] self he said let us generate let
[41:49] spring forth man after our own image
[41:53] that God's own DNA was placed into an
[41:57] image that was likened unto God
[42:01] amen and God at this time was still a
[42:04] spirit brooding over the waters a man he
[42:06] was still a spirit that was brooding
[42:08] over the earth still trying to find a
[42:11] place that he could take a home inside
[42:13] of amen God was still a spirit he
[42:16] remember he had brooded over the waters
[42:18] there was no rest there there is nowhere
[42:22] that got me but it could take their rest
[42:24] there was no comfort there there was no
[42:27] light there but as God began brooding it
[42:30] became greater and greater and greater a
[42:32] man when God said let there be a image
[42:37] liken unto me now I remember that image
[42:40] was really just an empty shell it was an
[42:44] image like unto God but it was and then
[42:47] he took that image and he made it into
[42:49] his own likeness
[42:51] and he made his own place his own spirit
[42:53] on the inside of that amen and then when
[42:56] he took that he breathed the indeed form
[42:59] took some of the dirt of the ground and
[43:01] he brutally put it into a little pile
[43:03] and formed it into exactly what he
[43:05] wanted to look like and then he took him
[43:08] Oh his own self and placed it there a
[43:10] man became a living soul amen and God
[43:14] has says I now have a son he wrote down
[43:18] in the annals of God's own word this man
[43:21] called Adam is the son of God amen the
[43:25] the earth bore generations these are the
[43:28] generations of the earth these are the
[43:30] generations of the heavens but here's
[43:32] Adam the generation of God amen the man
[43:36] after God's own image God now has a
[43:39] place where he can take rest a place
[43:42] where he can commune a man a place where
[43:45] when when God took his son Adam I'm he
[43:48] brought forth all the animals before
[43:50] Adam to see he said the Bible says so
[43:53] that God could see what he would name
[43:55] the animals and when now Adam began
[43:59] speaking out just like his father spoke
[44:02] out
[44:04] and you know what God was not surprised
[44:06] at anything Adam said when God created
[44:10] the Garden of Eden over in the east and
[44:13] he placed his son there to keep the
[44:15] garden God was not surprised at anything
[44:18] - Adam did a man God said let them have
[44:22] dominion over the earth let them have
[44:24] dominion over the fish let them have
[44:26] dominion over the cattle and he took any
[44:28] place - Adam there in the Garden of Eden
[44:30] and he says you want you to live here
[44:33] and when he can when God says but now I
[44:36] am placing trees and the midst of the
[44:38] garden and when he placed the Tree of
[44:42] Life there in the midst of the garden I
[44:44] placed the tree the tree of the
[44:47] knowledge of good and evil you know when
[44:50] when God spoke to Adam he said don't you
[44:53] take the fruit of the tree of the
[44:55] knowledge of good and evil but he never
[44:57] said anything about take not taking the
[45:00] fruit of the tree of life he never said
[45:04] anything against taking the fruit of the
[45:07] tree of life because Adam and the tree
[45:09] of life were to be one a man there were
[45:12] to be united together they are to be
[45:13] flesh of the flesh what they are to be
[45:16] united together but he did not he wanted
[45:18] a separation between that which was
[45:20] generated of the earth that which was
[45:23] generated of the water and that which
[45:25] was generated of God there had to be a
[45:28] separation there and God the one
[45:30] commandment he said not all had been you
[45:34] know peace and butterflies as we say up
[45:37] until that point but now God lays down
[45:39] the law he says let there be a
[45:43] separation Amen between you and what was
[45:46] generated of God and what was generated
[45:49] of man or what was generated of the
[45:51] earth now this this this generation let
[45:56] this tree here I'm placing in the midst
[45:58] of the garden don't partake in the fruit
[46:00] of this a man God placed the separation
[46:05] amen and go Adam as the Son of God was
[46:08] dwelling there and missed the garden he
[46:09] had access to the Tree of Life access
[46:13] full access to the Tree of Life
[46:17] about it full access though the very
[46:19] spirit that was brooding over the face
[46:21] of the waters that create all this there
[46:24] is no separation there was no heart
[46:28] there was no enmity between God and man
[46:31] there's there is there's there's God and
[46:33] His creation were one amen God had a
[46:36] place where he could dwell God had a
[46:38] place where he could come and visit God
[46:40] had a place where he could come and
[46:42] commune amen God and man had a commune
[46:45] together amen God had a son a man and
[46:49] his son had dominion over the earth
[46:52] amen now that tree there we read there
[46:58] in Proverbs was called the Tree of Life
[47:03] or what is life what's God God is the
[47:09] only thing that's life you know long
[47:11] life came from God when when knowing
[47:14] when when God wrote the book of life
[47:16] what was he doing he was placing his own
[47:19] ability his own portion there and
[47:22] allowing us to be partakers of that life
[47:25] amen he was creating for us to be part
[47:28] of that life Amen so so when you come to
[47:31] proverbs chapter 8 he says he says when
[47:38] he gave to the sea his decree that the
[47:40] water should not pass his commandment
[47:42] when he appointed the foundation of the
[47:44] earth then I was by him as one brought
[47:47] up with him Iowa's daily his delight
[47:50] rejoicing always before him rejoicing
[47:52] the habitable part of the earth why did
[47:54] God rejoice in the habitable part of the
[47:56] earth he says and my delights were with
[47:59] the sons of men a man God had a desire
[48:02] to be one with the sons of men God was
[48:05] it was expressing himself in the sons of
[48:09] men so it there would be another
[48:10] expression and then they had their seed
[48:13] within themselves so there would be
[48:15] another generation and another
[48:16] generation another son of God another
[48:19] son of God another son expressing God's
[48:22] own word expressing the attributes of
[48:24] God and then there'd be another
[48:26] generation expressing but what happened
[48:28] sin cut it off
[48:30] amen but God the but the the plan from
[48:33] the beginning was a God he says I was by
[48:37] him as one brought up with him I was
[48:39] daily as delight rejoice and always
[48:41] rejoicing the habitable parts of the
[48:44] earth
[48:44] my delights were with the sons of men
[48:47] but what caused the separation amen when
[48:52] sin came in amen a man broke the
[48:55] dividing line man crossed over to the
[48:58] particle to where we were not supposed
[49:00] to go amen but what happened to the tree
[49:04] of life now where did he go
[49:08] amen now this tree was a eternal life
[49:11] tree a man it was a is a tree that bore
[49:15] was a source of eternal life amen
[49:18] giggling God when God took them out of
[49:21] the Garden of Eden
[49:22] he put the the swords there he says the
[49:25] flames of fire flashing before the gates
[49:27] of Eden he drove man out and they could
[49:29] not come back in he says I'm driving
[49:32] them out so they don't partake of the
[49:34] tree of life and live forever amen
[49:37] you're always if they would have in
[49:39] their own sinful self if they could have
[49:41] partaken of the tree of life than what
[49:43] would man be eternally sinful a man
[49:46] think about it Amen you know think about
[49:48] it would man be eternally simple how
[49:50] could God and sin be United it cannot be
[49:53] how can man once he is united himself
[49:56] with sin partake of the tree of life and
[49:58] live forever a mess so so man hos now
[50:01] separated from eternal life the tree of
[50:06] eternal life now this tree was a source
[50:08] of eternal life a man and remember there
[50:11] is only one source of eternal life amen
[50:14] if man and God said in Genesis that
[50:17] unless man would eat of this tree of
[50:20] life and live forever
[50:22] so that tree was a source of eternal
[50:25] life
[50:26] well well where is it it's got to be
[50:29] around here somewhere a man do you
[50:31] realize that the same spirit that
[50:33] brooded over the waters in the beginning
[50:37] that spirit was eternal life amen that
[50:40] spirit was he turned of life and as they
[50:42] kept brooding it kept broody it became
[50:45] personified there in that tree a man he
[50:48] was placed in the midst of the garden so
[50:49] that man could have access to eternal
[50:52] life but when man was all sudden kicked
[50:55] out of the Garden of Eden he was
[50:57] separated from what eternal life and
[51:01] that eternal life is God amen so God was
[51:06] the Tree of Life a man so but now even
[51:10] though man was separated from that tree
[51:12] he couldn't get back to that tree but if
[51:15] you notice that throughout history that
[51:19] there were visitations throughout
[51:22] history where angel beings would speak
[51:25] to people and they say I am come from
[51:28] the throne of God to speak to you or
[51:30] angel and tiny white would come and
[51:32] speak to them you know like an angel
[51:34] came to Jacob has said I am the God that
[51:37] you worship there at Bethel a man or an
[51:40] angel will come and speak to him you who
[51:42] are looking for a child and I am going
[51:43] to give you that child
[51:44] there's thirst thirst when a man found
[51:47] himself stricken with death like a woman
[51:49] who had a Barren womb was and couldn't
[51:52] have children all sudden their being
[51:54] angel at visitation and that which was
[51:56] dead we're all sudden spring to life
[51:58] amen and a generation would come out of
[52:01] them they meant why because all sudden
[52:04] that tree of life that they that man was
[52:06] stricken away from came and visited them
[52:10] all the mercies of God amen think about
[52:14] yeah I would think about Abraham when he
[52:16] was worshiping the heathen idols and
[52:19] they're down there in the earth child
[52:21] ease it all sudden he had a visitation
[52:23] and God the tree of life came to him and
[52:27] started speaking to him amen now he was
[52:30] part of he had been part of that curse
[52:33] but yet there was a part of him that was
[52:35] beyond the curse because his name was
[52:38] written upon the Lamb's Book of Life
[52:40] before the foundation of the world so
[52:42] even though he was there in the ur of
[52:44] Col deze he's worshiping heathen idols
[52:48] there is a part of him that was still Oh
[52:50] still back over beyond fellowshiping
[52:54] with the Tree of Life
[52:57] and that could not be taken away from
[52:59] him
[53:00] think about it oh my I think about the
[53:02] the why did God visit Abraham as I said
[53:06] I was talking to someone once in the
[53:08] airport there there there say they were
[53:10] talking to me about salvation and they
[53:12] are theirs they're telling me oh you're
[53:15] thinking you're thinking that you're
[53:17] that there's more than just the blood
[53:19] the earth preaching the blood plus this
[53:21] and the blood plus that I mean they all
[53:23] we got to do is believe and speak the
[53:24] name of Jesus and we're safe you know
[53:26] and that's all we know psyche was I say
[53:29] you you have it all you're twisting my
[53:32] words I so I asked him I said when was
[53:34] Abraham saved when did Abraham inherit
[53:39] salvation because if you are a child of
[53:43] Abraham you have to be saved the same
[53:45] way Abraham was so as Abraham was he
[53:47] saved well he meant milk hesitate no he
[53:51] was saved before that a man was he saved
[53:55] when when when when God gave him the
[53:57] promise of you shall have a son no he
[54:01] was saved before that amen what was he
[54:05] saved when he crossed over the border
[54:07] into the Promised Land
[54:10] when his foot crossed the border into
[54:13] the Promised Land was he safe here and
[54:15] unsaved back here no no no no he was
[54:20] saved what before that no I don't know
[54:22] when when he was an Arab Chaldees and
[54:25] God told him separate yourself from your
[54:27] kindred and remove yourself is that when
[54:30] he was safe
[54:31] no he was safe before that well now so
[54:35] when was he saved he was saved when God
[54:38] and his eternal thinking took a book and
[54:42] started writing the name Abraham on a
[54:45] book of life and Abraham was forever
[54:48] linked with eternal life how beautiful
[54:53] is that so when when God when God's Word
[54:57] found itself placed upon in the earth of
[55:00] Abraham and Abraham came springing up
[55:05] out of the ground amen life eternal life
[55:09] was there
[55:10] but yet that that Earthborn creature
[55:13] that he was dwelling inside was
[55:15] separated from the tree of life by the
[55:19] Kurtz a man he had a journal life but he
[55:24] has separated from eternal life but yet
[55:26] the eternal wife kept visiting him kept
[55:29] visiting him kept busy in him why is it
[55:33] it's that same spirit that same Holy
[55:35] Spirit that brooded over the darkness
[55:39] was now brooding over Abraham oh isn't
[55:43] that glorious the same spirit that
[55:46] brooded over the creation when the earth
[55:49] was created now had found another
[55:52] another body that was in darkness
[55:56] another body that was separated from the
[55:59] promise of what it could be another body
[56:02] that was separated from his full
[56:03] potential and as the Spirit of God was
[56:07] brooding over Abraham it brought it was
[56:10] bringing Abraham back to what was
[56:13] written of him before the foundation of
[56:15] the world amen and I think right now
[56:17] where is Abraham today now as Abraham
[56:22] did he you know he died his body was
[56:25] placed inside of a cave somewhere and a
[56:28] stone was roll across the cave now maybe
[56:32] if we were to go over to Israel and look
[56:35] for that cave and we went in there what
[56:37] would we find nothing because there was
[56:43] a there was a man by the name of Christ
[56:45] Jesus that died upon the cross and went
[56:49] and now that now who was this man Christ
[56:53] Jesus now now let's go to John chapter
[56:57] 10 now when was Abraham saved before
[57:05] amen before Abraham was saved before
[57:09] hey man but yeah he was separated from
[57:11] eternal life but eternal life kept
[57:14] visiting him visiting him visiting him
[57:17] this entire life was a testimony of the
[57:21] visitation of eternal life
[57:23] amen so no no no now the body of Abraham
[57:27] grew old amen now God change him back to
[57:31] a young man again but then what happened
[57:33] he grew old and died and they took that
[57:37] body he placed it inside of a cave in a
[57:41] very specific location that God told him
[57:44] to be placed and he says go and purchase
[57:47] this field you know and all that and
[57:48] then he'd be buried right here and put
[57:50] the put the stone over the cave and let
[57:53] your body just sit there and wait why
[57:54] because there's a promise there's a
[57:57] promise
[57:58] now there's something happened to
[58:00] Abraham's body it died now why did it
[58:04] die because he was separated from
[58:06] eternal life eternal life says you will
[58:11] never die eternal life says you will
[58:16] never die but he was separated from
[58:18] eternal life so his body even though
[58:21] eternal life kept visiting him but it
[58:24] still his body grew old and then died
[58:27] and had to be placed inside of a cave
[58:28] amen but when but when but when bowing
[58:32] Christ died something happened now let's
[58:34] go to John chapter 10 verse 10 who was
[58:39] Christ you eternal life he was the
[58:43] source of eternal life amen that same
[58:46] tree has now visit us again in the midst
[58:49] of time amen John 10 verse 10 says the
[58:53] thief cometh not but for to steal and to
[58:56] kill and to destroy but I am come who to
[59:02] who is I that's Christ the only source
[59:06] of eternal life amen I am come that they
[59:09] might have life and that they might have
[59:12] it more abundantly
[59:13] amen now he's not just talking about the
[59:15] natural life that we live here amen that
[59:18] grows old as our body weakens down but
[59:21] he's talking about that same source of
[59:23] eternal life that same spirit that
[59:26] brooded over the darkness in the
[59:27] beginning now is standing here in the
[59:29] midst of the creation in the midst of
[59:32] time saying I'm here amen now there's a
[59:36] thief that has come
[59:37] kill and destroy he's come to drag your
[59:40] body down into the dust he's come to
[59:42] drag your body down into this but I am
[59:45] come that you might have life and that
[59:47] you might have him more abundantly what
[59:49] was happening The Tree of Life appear to
[59:52] you oh my now think about now they had
[59:56] been separated from this tree back over
[59:58] in the Garden of Eden God told him and
[1:00:00] said put the flaming swords of fire
[1:00:02] there at the gate of the Garden of Eden
[1:00:04] and told man you can't go back in there
[1:00:06] you've been separated from that tree
[1:00:08] that you used to enjoy that tree you
[1:00:10] said and now you're gonna grow old that
[1:00:12] day you eat thereof that day you shall
[1:00:14] die and Adam grew older and older and
[1:00:17] older and finally died amen and he and
[1:00:21] his body waited there what was he
[1:00:23] waiting for that there might be a way
[1:00:25] back to the tree of life amen and when
[1:00:28] the tree of life came back here in John
[1:00:31] 10:10 he walked upon the earth for what
[1:00:34] 33 years that same spirit that brooded
[1:00:38] over the darkness in the beginning now
[1:00:40] has brooded together another body a body
[1:00:45] has so prepared for me amen and in what
[1:00:47] just like back in the beginning he
[1:00:49] brooded another body amen
[1:00:51] he formed a body inside the Virgin Mary
[1:00:54] amen he spoke his word to her right he
[1:00:58] spoke his word to her and he placed his
[1:01:00] word he called out to Mary and placed
[1:01:04] his word inside of her and that word
[1:01:07] began to bring forth and bring forth and
[1:01:10] what was born out of her was the Word of
[1:01:12] God Jesus Christ the word of God and the
[1:01:15] word became flesh and dwelt among us
[1:01:18] amen and that word was the Tree of Life
[1:01:22] it was the same tree that we were
[1:01:23] separated from the same tree that we
[1:01:26] were cursed away from was now back here
[1:01:28] on the earth again the only source of
[1:01:32] eternal life was back amongst Mint's
[1:01:35] that man again and whosoever believes on
[1:01:38] him will have eternal life amen don't
[1:01:41] you see what Christ is doing he's making
[1:01:44] our restoration he's making things alive
[1:01:47] again amen that which was brooded that
[1:01:50] remember
[1:01:50] the whole plan of God from the
[1:01:53] foundation was that he is brooding over
[1:01:55] an earth that was in darkness but he
[1:01:57] couldn't have a place to land he didn't
[1:02:00] have a place to rest he didn't have a
[1:02:02] place he could be comfortable
[1:02:03] amen but now when he when the tree of
[1:02:06] life was there in the garden a man but
[1:02:08] man got separated from it and they no
[1:02:11] longer had access to the Tree of Life
[1:02:12] but now we see here 2000 years ago that
[1:02:16] the Tree of Life reappears again a man
[1:02:19] in a place called Jerusalem as walking
[1:02:21] amongst men amen and then he gates that
[1:02:25] tree of life gave was named the Lord
[1:02:27] Jesus Christ amen and that tree gave
[1:02:30] forth certain promises amen to us
[1:02:34] he says that if anybody would believe on
[1:02:37] my name he says go into all the worlds
[1:02:40] and be he said behold in Matthew 28
[1:02:43] behold all power in heaven and earth is
[1:02:45] given unto me all power in heaven and
[1:02:49] earth is given unto me the tree of life
[1:02:51] amen go into all the world and baptize
[1:02:55] them into my name the tree of life a man
[1:02:59] could they'll confess their sins
[1:03:01] repent of their sins repent of the
[1:03:03] separation right amen and then they'll
[1:03:05] be reunited by baptism back into the
[1:03:08] tree of life amen and it doesn't matter
[1:03:11] what happens to their body it doesn't
[1:03:13] matter what happens to him from that day
[1:03:14] forward but if they go down into the
[1:03:17] waters baptized I will place my life on
[1:03:20] the inside of them amen and they will
[1:03:22] have eternal life again now let's go
[1:03:27] back to Abraham where is Abraham where
[1:03:32] did he go where did he go
[1:03:35] that he died at age 150 160 somewhere in
[1:03:39] there they placed him in a cave and then
[1:03:41] they and he stayed in that cave as his
[1:03:46] body began to decompose there and he
[1:03:48] stayed in that cave for about 2,000
[1:03:51] years and all of a sudden when the tree
[1:03:55] of life reappeared on earth again and
[1:03:58] that tree of life was nailed to a Roman
[1:04:01] tree and when the tree of life was new
[1:04:04] the Roman tree Danny when he died the
[1:04:08] the there was a great darkness and the
[1:04:10] earth became dark and there was a great
[1:04:12] earthquake and the tombs were opened and
[1:04:15] and all of a sudden the body of Abraham
[1:04:17] sprung back up to life again and I want
[1:04:20] to put up in the glory why he met the
[1:04:23] tree he had been separated from the tree
[1:04:25] all those years oh and the tree of life
[1:04:27] reappeared he was taken up into glory
[1:04:32] just think about every 2,000 years
[1:04:35] something happens on this earth every
[1:04:38] 2,000 years something happens when God
[1:04:41] created the heavens and the earth the
[1:04:43] earth began to degenerate again all the
[1:04:46] way to the time of Noah and about 2,000
[1:04:49] years after earth was created you come
[1:04:51] to the time of Noah and Abraham a man
[1:04:54] there was just a few hundred years
[1:04:55] separating Noah and Abraham and when and
[1:04:58] when the earth was sinned he see he took
[1:05:03] the whole the earth he flooded with the
[1:05:05] waters they meant and the earth was all
[1:05:08] son form and void again and waters
[1:05:12] covered the whole face of the earth a
[1:05:14] man but he had one man that was in he
[1:05:18] had a group of people that were inside
[1:05:20] an ark floating on the face of the
[1:05:22] waters and the earth again was in a Suz
[1:05:25] form without shape it was round without
[1:05:28] shape a water had covered the face and
[1:05:31] what was it out of this little Ark all
[1:05:34] sudden flies a dove and it's looking
[1:05:37] it's lookie it's looking for a place to
[1:05:39] land and this Dove could not find any
[1:05:41] place for it to land and she went back
[1:05:44] to the Ark and she was tired and weary
[1:05:46] she was looking for a place to land
[1:05:48] looking looking looking and as in all
[1:05:51] sudden he goes out a couple more time
[1:05:52] and anyone othertimes she and what she
[1:05:55] brings forth a leaf from an olive tree
[1:05:59] and comes back to Noah I know it says
[1:06:03] God peace between God and man has
[1:06:06] restored the brooding over the waters as
[1:06:08] fish and then when the ark set about on
[1:06:11] the Mount Ararat and God opened the door
[1:06:13] he goes forth it was it was like another
[1:06:16] Garden of Eden man was restored
[1:06:18] back he told he told Noah be fruitful
[1:06:21] and multiply and gave them the same word
[1:06:23] that he gave to Adam
[1:06:25] amen what life was restored to the earth
[1:06:28] again a man they had the Dove there amen
[1:06:32] and peace with God again amen they built
[1:06:34] an altar amen and worship God
[1:06:39] now another 2,000 years went forth and
[1:06:42] what happened Christ was nailed to the
[1:06:46] cross and what happened the earth was
[1:06:48] bathed in darkness again and there was a
[1:06:52] great earthquake and the tombs were open
[1:06:55] and those that trust in the Tree of Life
[1:06:56] and the lamb wrote went up to glory with
[1:07:00] him a man but where do we stand that we
[1:07:04] stand the Gentiles were in gross
[1:07:06] darkness amen we're without form and
[1:07:09] void but the Spirit is still brooding
[1:07:11] and looking for our people
[1:07:14] the tree of life is still here he's
[1:07:16] still brooding he's still looking for
[1:07:17] people every two thousand years
[1:07:19] something happened say men and the
[1:07:22] promise of God is broken forth upon
[1:07:24] other people a man now we're at the end
[1:07:26] of what this third period of 2,000 years
[1:07:29] yeah 2,000 years from the creation to
[1:07:31] Noah and Abraham you had 2,000 years
[1:07:33] from Noah under Christ now you've had
[1:07:35] two thousand years from Christ unto
[1:07:37] today and where do we stand we have been
[1:07:42] separated from the tree of life amen now
[1:07:46] if we took a time machine and went back
[1:07:49] 2,000 years we could see that tree
[1:07:52] nailed to a cross now if we could take a
[1:07:58] time machine and go back in time we
[1:08:01] could have fellowship with that tree how
[1:08:05] many would like to do that wouldn't that
[1:08:07] be great to go back and watch him preach
[1:08:09] the Sermon on the Mount wouldn't it be
[1:08:13] great to go back and and be in the boat
[1:08:16] with the disciples as the waves were
[1:08:18] crashing and the boat was and here Jesus
[1:08:20] was asleep in the bottom of the boat
[1:08:22] wouldn't it be great would that be great
[1:08:24] to be on the road to emmaus
[1:08:28] listening to the disciples talk with the
[1:08:31] risen Savior think about when Christ
[1:08:34] died and rose again or died and rose
[1:08:36] again and spent 40 days appearing unto
[1:08:40] men if we could have a time machine and
[1:08:43] enter in that day and go back Oh
[1:08:46] wouldn't that be great to go back but
[1:08:48] the tree of life left he was taken up in
[1:08:53] the glory and the book of Acts as you
[1:08:56] read there in Acts chapter 1 about how
[1:08:59] Jesus was staying and they're talking to
[1:09:01] him and all of a sudden that he is
[1:09:04] talking to him and all of a sudden he
[1:09:06] starts ascending up and as they watch
[1:09:10] him he started ascending up he's the
[1:09:11] tree of life the Tree of Life is being
[1:09:15] separated from them once again now they
[1:09:17] did they spent three-and-a-half years
[1:09:20] with this tree of life and now the tree
[1:09:22] of life is ascending ascending ascending
[1:09:24] and they're getting he's getting further
[1:09:26] away and further away and further away
[1:09:28] they're being separating once more from
[1:09:30] the tree of life and they're standing
[1:09:34] there and all of a sudden the book of
[1:09:35] Acts says that a cloud obscured him so
[1:09:38] they could see him no more and they're
[1:09:40] standing there looking up like this and
[1:09:45] just looking up in the sky and looking
[1:09:47] up in the sky and God had to do
[1:09:49] something to change their focus because
[1:09:54] remember when Christ started ascending
[1:09:56] the Bible says in acts 8 a cloud
[1:09:59] obscured and they said they're staring
[1:10:01] like this God had to do something to
[1:10:06] change their focus think about how how
[1:10:10] empty they would feel think about how
[1:10:11] the very tree that God had given him
[1:10:15] back to him the tree of eternal life and
[1:10:17] now it's separate away from them and
[1:10:20] gave you further and further for the way
[1:10:21] how would you feel but an angel came and
[1:10:30] read
[1:10:31] directed their attention and it says why
[1:10:34] do you stand here staring like that why
[1:10:37] are you standing there looking up in the
[1:10:39] heavens he will return in the same way
[1:10:41] that he left he says but go back and
[1:10:45] listen to everything and do everything
[1:10:47] that he told you to do and their mind
[1:10:49] focus back to the Word of God he said
[1:10:53] wait here into Jerusalem until you be
[1:10:55] endued with power from on high
[1:10:57] what is that power from on high it's the
[1:11:00] same spirit that brooded over the dark
[1:11:03] world back in the beginning was promised
[1:11:05] to reappear unto them the tree of life
[1:11:10] and so they went into the upper room and
[1:11:14] they waited and they waited and they
[1:11:17] waited and did you know that same tree
[1:11:20] visited them again amen a visit a you
[1:11:25] know visitations throughout the Old
[1:11:27] Testament happened over and over and
[1:11:30] over again you know in Daniels in the
[1:11:32] lion's den he says an angel the Lord
[1:11:35] came and shut the lion's mouth a man now
[1:11:38] he is separated from the tree of life he
[1:11:41] was in danger of his life and what what
[1:11:44] the eternal life came and protected his
[1:11:47] life amen
[1:11:48] how many women in the Old Testament were
[1:11:50] barren and all sudden angel said it came
[1:11:53] and said you have a child and you will
[1:11:55] bring forth life again well it wasn't
[1:11:58] the tree of life was visiting them again
[1:12:00] but now here in the Upper Room this is
[1:12:03] now this is different this is not just
[1:12:04] the visitation of eternal life
[1:12:06] something that will come and then will
[1:12:08] go but this is a permanent indwelling of
[1:12:11] eternal life the same the same dove that
[1:12:15] brooded over the earth in the beginning
[1:12:17] that had no place to land found a place
[1:12:21] to land and gave a certain promise that
[1:12:25] whosoever is baptized in my name can
[1:12:29] have this promise that I the source of
[1:12:32] all eternal life I who have been
[1:12:34] brooding over this earth these four
[1:12:36] thousand years I have been brooding over
[1:12:39] the darkness looking live is separated
[1:12:42] from my creation that I was meant to do
[1:12:45] and now I have found like like the Dove
[1:12:48] going back to the ark I have found a
[1:12:50] place where I can rest my feet and and
[1:12:53] the Holy Spirit came down like a tongues
[1:12:55] of fire was resting upon their head I
[1:12:58] Nelson they didn't see the fire any more
[1:13:01] now they saw the fire above their head
[1:13:04] but then it was gone where did they go
[1:13:06] it went down eternal life anchored down
[1:13:10] into the soul and he says I will be with
[1:13:14] you lo always even to the end of the
[1:13:17] world
[1:13:18] the tree of life has returned unto men
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:22] death oh where is your sting grave where
[1:13:26] is your victory that which we were
[1:13:29] separated from back in the beginning all
[1:13:31] the atom lasts has now been restored
[1:13:34] back to the children of men
[1:13:36] it's the Tree of Life wait or has been
[1:13:38] restored back to the children the seals
[1:13:41] have been lifted off the book we now see
[1:13:43] who we are we are the sons and daughters
[1:13:46] of God Christ has returned to the earth
[1:13:49] and he has given power all power has
[1:13:51] given given in heaven earth has been
[1:13:53] given unto me and now I give that unto
[1:13:56] you all that was poured into Christ was
[1:13:59] poured into the church all that was
[1:14:00] poured into the church amen he is giving
[1:14:04] it unto us eternal life has been given
[1:14:08] unto you you see who we are this is who
[1:14:11] we are we are sons and daughters of God
[1:14:13] now I remember where is Abraham he has
[1:14:15] never died he ascended up in a rapture
[1:14:20] 2,000 years ago after being resurrected
[1:14:23] at the death of Christ amen and he is
[1:14:26] still alive amen now where are we we are
[1:14:29] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus hey
[1:14:32] man we are not we are in this world but
[1:14:35] we are not of this world when Jesus
[1:14:39] Christ was here he could walk through
[1:14:41] walls he could speak to the leopard they
[1:14:46] be healed if he was hungry he could
[1:14:49] create bread right a meant anything that
[1:14:54] he had need of he could speak the word
[1:14:56] and it would happen
[1:14:59] that's what eternal life does that's the
[1:15:04] power of eternal life why why is that
[1:15:08] the power why was Christ able to do that
[1:15:10] because that say in him was that same
[1:15:13] spirit that brooded over the darkness in
[1:15:16] the beginning that said let the water
[1:15:19] separate from the land and he called the
[1:15:23] dry land earth and he called the water
[1:15:26] seas now that same spirit was in Christ
[1:15:30] reconciling the world to himself
[1:15:33] amen now that same spirit is in you now
[1:15:36] Christ was able to do all those things
[1:15:39] because he was the tree of eternal life
[1:15:41] amen now we were separated from that
[1:15:44] tree but a man but remember even though
[1:15:47] we are separate from that tree there has
[1:15:49] been visitations visitations visitations
[1:15:53] a man I think every Christian has
[1:15:56] testimonies about how even before you
[1:15:58] were saved there was a hand those upon
[1:16:01] your life and God was guiding you even
[1:16:04] when you were separated from him amen
[1:16:05] amen why is it because even though you
[1:16:08] were lost you still had your name on the
[1:16:11] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:16:14] foundation of the world
[1:16:15] a man so even though you were
[1:16:16] disconnected from the Tree of Life
[1:16:18] because your name was back over there
[1:16:21] there was visitations visitation what's
[1:16:23] he trying to do he's trying to get back
[1:16:26] on the inside of you why because it's
[1:16:27] the dove brooding over the darkness once
[1:16:30] again amen what trying to restore you
[1:16:33] back to the son or daughter of God that
[1:16:36] you're supposed to be from before the
[1:16:38] foundation of the world a man wants you
[1:16:40] repent of your sins your repent of the
[1:16:43] separation your opinion of everything to
[1:16:45] separate you from Christ then the tree
[1:16:48] of life comes as restored to you I on
[1:16:50] the inside you are baptized into his
[1:16:53] name and you come up out of the water
[1:16:55] rejecting the things the past your alive
[1:16:58] under Christ in the future amen
[1:17:00] and the Tree of Life is now living down
[1:17:02] on the inside and you are now alive a
[1:17:05] living son and daughter of God life
[1:17:08] inside of you
[1:17:09] Amen so now the same power that was a
[1:17:12] Christ is now inside of you doing the
[1:17:15] same things at Christ's day when he was
[1:17:18] here on earth Amen if you have hungry
[1:17:20] you can create bread if you're sick you
[1:17:22] can pray to the Father and he'll heal
[1:17:25] you if you're if you're in bondage you
[1:17:27] can cry out for deliverance and the tree
[1:17:29] of life you'll have to cry out toward
[1:17:31] the seas over there you don't have to
[1:17:33] cry up to the heavens you have to speak
[1:17:36] to the tree of life that is down on the
[1:17:37] inside of you and he will heal you
[1:17:40] you speak to the Tree of Life that is on
[1:17:41] the site he will deliver you why because
[1:17:44] you are not meant to be separated from
[1:17:46] him why he brooded over the darkness
[1:17:49] that was over your life and he found the
[1:17:51] entrance and now he is on the inside of
[1:17:53] you
[1:17:53] Amen why would you want to be separated
[1:17:56] from him again amen but you through the
[1:17:58] word you speak the word and you create
[1:18:01] the atmosphere in your life just like he
[1:18:04] did it back in the beginning amen he
[1:18:06] because of the spirit when he when the
[1:18:08] spirit found itself brooding over a dark
[1:18:11] formless void he began speaking amen and
[1:18:15] same thing you when you and your life
[1:18:17] find yourself dark formless and void and
[1:18:20] you don't look anything like what you
[1:18:22] were created to be then you start
[1:18:25] speaking the words of eternal life over
[1:18:27] the situations in your life and was
[1:18:30] eternal life makes things happen once
[1:18:32] more and now the same way you give
[1:18:36] permission to the Holy Spirit on the
[1:18:40] inside to recreate what the DNA of God
[1:18:44] said would be in the beginning think
[1:18:48] about it the oak tree out there is
[1:18:49] bearing testimony to the DNA of God God
[1:18:54] put spoke his word into the earth said
[1:18:57] let the earth bring forth an oak tree
[1:19:00] and down throughout all the generations
[1:19:04] every oak tree generation after
[1:19:06] generation after generation
[1:19:08] God spoke down into the waters and said
[1:19:11] let there be fish and his word went into
[1:19:13] the water and a fish was formed and in
[1:19:16] that inside that fish as the DNA of
[1:19:19] God's Word and it's generating exactly
[1:19:22] what his word said over and over again
[1:19:24] but when
[1:19:25] God spoke to himself he said let let us
[1:19:29] bring forth and when he spoke to himself
[1:19:32] and he placed his word into a form of
[1:19:35] the earth man was brought up out of the
[1:19:37] earth and man became a living soul I saw
[1:19:40] him was given the the he was not he was
[1:19:44] not listen Adam was never told don't eat
[1:19:48] from the tree of life
[1:19:51] Adam was never done until he left the
[1:19:54] garden he was never prevented from
[1:19:56] eating from the tree of eternal life and
[1:19:58] let me tell you since the restoration
[1:20:00] you are not prevented from eating from
[1:20:04] the source you eternal life now what is
[1:20:08] eternal life when Christ can't did
[1:20:10] Christ ever go to a funeral
[1:20:12] no he raised a bit Amen one time one
[1:20:17] time they were carrying a body or
[1:20:19] they're carrying the casket the
[1:20:20] pallbearers were walking by carrying the
[1:20:23] casket and Jesus walked up and the man
[1:20:26] got up out of the casket and walked off
[1:20:29] why the Tree of Life that poor man had
[1:20:33] died was put in the casket he was being
[1:20:37] carried on the little platform a however
[1:20:39] they did it back then
[1:20:40] and all of a sudden it just so happened
[1:20:43] there's a funeral procession went down
[1:20:45] Main Street turned onto 7th Street and
[1:20:48] then walked right by the Tree of Life

[1:20:55] bed you you kneel down at your chair and
[1:20:59] you you walk through the doorway you go
[1:21:02] and you kneel your chair and all sudden
[1:21:03] you're face to face with eternal life
[1:21:05] what can happen when a people realize
[1:21:10] who they are and what they've been
[1:21:12] called the be what they have been called
[1:21:14] to do that you have been called to be a
[1:21:17] repository linked with eternal life and
[1:21:20] not just that it's not just that God
[1:21:22] gave you permission to be part of
[1:21:24] eternal life but God wrote it before the
[1:21:27] foundation of the world your name upon
[1:21:29] the lands book of life they will be
[1:21:31] linked with the eternal life of the Lamb
[1:21:33] through our history and then he slew the
[1:21:36] Lamb before the foundation of the world
[1:21:38] for those named
[1:21:40] amen where do we stand we live below our
[1:21:44] privileges we have been given permission
[1:21:49] remember the angel had to come down
[1:21:51] let's go to let's go to the book Acts
[1:21:53] chapter 1 I just want to read that
[1:22:15] Acts chapter 1 verse 7 Jesus speaking
[1:22:30] and he said unto them it is not for you
[1:22:35] to know the times or the seasons which
[1:22:39] the father hath put in his own power but
[1:22:42] ye shall receive power after that the
[1:22:45] Holy Ghost is come upon you no no sir he
[1:22:48] just spoke up about power twice right
[1:22:50] there the first power he said the father
[1:22:53] has the power over the times and the
[1:22:56] seasons but you won't know them but the
[1:22:59] power those within you will amen may ye
[1:23:03] shall receive power after that the Holy
[1:23:06] Ghost has come upon you and you should
[1:23:08] be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem
[1:23:11] and in all Judea and in Samaria until
[1:23:14] the uttermost part of the earth
[1:23:16] now witnesses unto me now who was he
[1:23:21] he was the tree of eternal life how do
[1:23:25] you bear witness of the tree of eternal
[1:23:28] life do you do you give a Sunday School
[1:23:33] lesson and you break out the books and
[1:23:35] have the children draw with crayons on
[1:23:38] the is that the witness of eternal life
[1:23:41] nothing wrong with that bearing witness
[1:23:46] of the tree of eternal life is having
[1:23:49] something down on the inside of you that
[1:23:52] creates life something that broods over
[1:23:56] the darkness and when darkness is when
[1:24:00] you see darkness and something is form
[1:24:02] and void and when you begin speaking in
[1:24:05] your prayers and say Lord change the
[1:24:08] situation and all sudden you are bearing
[1:24:10] witness and now eternal life is on the
[1:24:13] inside of you
[1:24:13] why because life is now being
[1:24:16] transmitted out of your mouth just like
[1:24:19] life was transmitted out of the father's
[1:24:21] back in the beginning
[1:24:22] you are bearing witnesses to the
[1:24:25] uttermost part of the earth of eternal
[1:24:27] life why whenever you see darkness we
[1:24:30] speak to the darkness isn't that what we
[1:24:32] were called to do we were called to the
[1:24:34] speak to the darkness Jesus Christ stir
[1:24:37] up there one day and read from the
[1:24:38] scroll he says this
[1:24:40] the Lord God is upon me because he has
[1:24:42] anointed me to to bring them out of
[1:24:44] bondage he is anointed me to bring them
[1:24:46] captives out of the prisons
[1:24:48] he is anointing me to the set of brought
[1:24:50] Loveline to seen a man as a set the
[1:24:52] captives free he's anointed me what was
[1:24:55] he anointed with eternal life
[1:24:56] what are we anointed with all the power
[1:24:59] of eternal life so what do we do we do
[1:25:01] the same things Christ did when we see
[1:25:04] darkness we do the same thing we do the
[1:25:06] same thing here
[1:25:07] he saw darkness and he spoke to it and
[1:25:09] changed the atmosphere we see darkness
[1:25:12] in someone's life and we cry out against
[1:25:14] it we speak to it let it be changed by
[1:25:17] the eternal life that's down on the
[1:25:18] inside
[1:25:19] you don't speak off over into the
[1:25:20] heavens you don't speak off to those
[1:25:22] side of the seat you speak to the
[1:25:24] eternal life that is inside of you and
[1:25:26] then it bears witness on the outs out of
[1:25:29] you that you are filled with eternal
[1:25:31] life but ye shall receive power after
[1:25:36] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:25:38] and ye shall be my witnesses unto me
[1:25:41] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[1:25:43] in Samaria and unto the uttermost part
[1:25:46] of the earth and then when he had spoken
[1:25:48] these things while they beheld he was
[1:25:52] taken up and a cloud received him out of
[1:25:55] their sight and while they looked
[1:25:57] steadfastly toward the heaven as he went
[1:26:01] up behold two men stood by them in white
[1:26:07] apparel which also said Ye men of
[1:26:11] Galilee why stand ye gazing up into
[1:26:15] heaven they were looking for him to
[1:26:20] return amen
[1:26:23] they're looking to see maybe he would
[1:26:26] show up over here or show up over there
[1:26:29] or show up in this revival or show up
[1:26:33] over there but then God had to redirect
[1:26:37] their attention that God is not going to
[1:26:41] come back by you gazing into the heavens
[1:26:43] God isn't going to return back maybe by
[1:26:46] you going over to this church or to this
[1:26:48] church or over this revival or over this
[1:26:50] over here you don't don't seek him this
[1:26:53] just listen to what he told you he
[1:26:56] brooded over you he spoke the word unto
[1:26:59] you take his words and be obedient what
[1:27:02] he said hey man you don't get it by
[1:27:05] gazing up into the heavens but you get
[1:27:07] it by being obedient to his word amen so
[1:27:10] the angel had to redirect their
[1:27:12] attention from the heavens over to the
[1:27:15] Word of God amen
[1:27:17] which also verse 11 which also said Ye
[1:27:20] men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up
[1:27:23] into heaven this same Jesus which is
[1:27:25] taken up from you into heaven shall so
[1:27:27] come in like manner as he was seen him
[1:27:30] go into heaven and then return they unto
[1:27:33] Jerusalem unto the mount called Olivet
[1:27:35] which is a Sabbath's a journey and then
[1:27:37] we're searching and when they were come
[1:27:38] in they went into an upper room and they
[1:27:44] waited upon the word of the Lord amen
[1:27:49] the word of the Lord that came unto
[1:27:52] Peter ten days after that said repent be
[1:27:59] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:01] Christ and you shall be filled with the
[1:28:05] Holy Ghost
[1:28:06] and the same spirit that brooded over
[1:28:10] the darkness in the beginning will come
[1:28:12] into your life and make the same great
[1:28:16] transformation the same spirit that
[1:28:22] brooded over the darkness in the
[1:28:24] beginning will now come into you after
[1:28:28] you repent and you're baptized in the
[1:28:30] name Lord Jesus Christ and it will make
[1:28:33] the same exact same great transformation
[1:28:40] on the inside of you you have to be
[1:28:46] transformed don't you see it's a it's we
[1:28:51] have to be transformed we can't fail to
[1:28:56] be transformed if there is darkness in
[1:29:00] your life you got to be born
[1:29:07] dove is broody he's looking for a place
[1:29:12] to land and if there is darkness in your
[1:29:16] life then the tree of life is no longer
[1:29:19] separated from you and he will come into
[1:29:23] you and sup with you and you with him
[1:29:26] Jesus the tree of life came and said I
[1:29:29] have come that you might have life I
[1:29:32] have a more abundantly have you
[1:29:35] experienced this abundant life don't
[1:29:39] fail this abundant life it's not just
[1:29:42] not just that oh well someday Christ
[1:29:44] will return and then maybe all we
[1:29:48] deliver from life I'm in but no right
[1:29:50] now you know I think about the stages of
[1:29:54] life a lot you know when you're you know
[1:29:59] you know when you're a child your life
[1:30:02] changes every three years every three
[1:30:05] years your life is completely different
[1:30:07] tell you about 21 years old
[1:30:09] and from then on your life changes about
[1:30:12] every seven years and every seven years
[1:30:15] your life is completely changed from
[1:30:17] seven years previously and you know and
[1:30:21] and and the phases of life you know as
[1:30:23] you grow up you're learning you own
[1:30:25] every child you know he has he wants to
[1:30:27] go out and play he wants to go out and
[1:30:29] do this
[1:30:29] he own he has desires he wants to go and
[1:30:32] play and do this and you have to kind of
[1:30:34] redirect him to do his chores and
[1:30:36] redirect him to do this you know but as
[1:30:39] he grows up to be a teenager you know it
[1:30:41] all of a sudden those great desires of
[1:30:44] life start going in of what you know is
[1:30:46] you get to be you know 12 13 14 15 16
[1:30:49] years old and the desires of life come
[1:30:52] upon you and you want to go off over
[1:30:54] here and be independent want to go off
[1:30:56] over here and do this and you want to go
[1:30:58] find a mate for life for a girl or a boy
[1:31:02] or something like that you want to go
[1:31:03] get a job you want to be your own person
[1:31:05] the only ones get to be 18 19 21 years
[1:31:08] old you know you want to be you know go
[1:31:10] get your own house and you have all
[1:31:12] these grand desires you know but when a
[1:31:17] person
[1:31:18] no matter what stages of life they're in
[1:31:24] you know when you get to be in your 20s
[1:31:26] you know you you're just trying to find
[1:31:29] a decent good-paying job you know you're
[1:31:31] trying to get started in life by time
[1:31:33] you're in your thirties you're getting
[1:31:35] established by your 40s you've probably
[1:31:39] marked your career path out by time in
[1:31:42] your 50s you're starting to look and
[1:31:44] look forward in the future and wondering
[1:31:46] when you can retire and buy time of your
[1:31:49] 60s your body is declaring the death is
[1:31:51] upon it you know and and yes it's
[1:31:55] looking forward to retirement and where
[1:31:57] you can live at ease and in the 70s and
[1:32:00] you're just enjoying life you know and
[1:32:02] but you know every phase of life comes
[1:32:05] with its own desires its own once its
[1:32:09] own something it wants to accomplish but
[1:32:12] no matter where you are at what stage of
[1:32:15] life you're in when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:32:20] it doesn't necessarily do away with
[1:32:22] those desires it comes and redirects
[1:32:27] those desires according to the purpose
[1:32:30] of eternal life so that you don't have
[1:32:34] to go and and like if you're a teenager
[1:32:37] or go and find a worldly go for it you
[1:32:40] go and find a godly go for amen you
[1:32:43] don't go and find you and find your
[1:32:44] direction of life you'll go off in an
[1:32:47] ungodly direction you go off in a godly
[1:32:50] direction the only when you're in your
[1:32:51] 20s you know and you want to go get a
[1:32:53] good job you know you think well yeah
[1:32:55] you know a truck driver for a beer
[1:32:56] company or something but all of a sudden
[1:32:58] the Holy Ghost comes and it changes your
[1:33:01] direction and now you are doing the
[1:33:03] things that God asks for you you know
[1:33:05] and you know each stage of life whatever
[1:33:08] stage of life you're in the Holy Ghost
[1:33:10] comes and provides you Direction
[1:33:13] leadership why because the Holy Ghost is
[1:33:17] here the same tree is here to lead you
[1:33:19] and to eternal life and no matter where
[1:33:23] you are if darkness tries to overcome
[1:33:25] you whatever phase you're in eternal
[1:33:28] life is here it's the same visitation Oh
[1:33:32] over and over again wherever you are the
[1:33:34] holy spirit eternal life is here and
[1:33:37] he's here to brood you and over you and
[1:33:39] build you into you what he had in his
[1:33:42] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:33:44] you know and any man can go and look at
[1:33:47] the the calendars that they have for
[1:33:50] sale out there or the the pictures you
[1:33:52] know of you know you know you know
[1:33:54] sunsets and you know and some remote
[1:33:58] island out there with a palm tree over
[1:34:00] it or or the great mountains of the
[1:34:02] snow-capped mountains and we say oh my
[1:34:05] ass beautiful why is that beautiful
[1:34:08] because it was a created by eternal life
[1:34:14] those things we look at them and they're
[1:34:16] pleasing to our eyes because they're
[1:34:19] beautiful because they were created by
[1:34:20] eternal life that same eternal life is
[1:34:24] here to brood over you and whatever he
[1:34:28] has seen in his mind for your life is
[1:34:31] just as beautiful as what you see in
[1:34:34] those pictures and more and he is now
[1:34:39] brooding over you to create on the
[1:34:42] inside of you something as even more
[1:34:45] beautiful than what you see there if you
[1:34:49] would just submit to it a man when God
[1:34:53] put his word into the waters whatever
[1:34:56] came out of it was beautiful when God
[1:34:58] put his word into the earth whatever it
[1:35:01] was was beautiful when God spoke to the
[1:35:04] land and let's said let the dry land
[1:35:05] appear look we just see all the dry land
[1:35:09] appeared but look what it appeared into
[1:35:11] the mountains and the islands and all
[1:35:15] the creation and it's beautiful whatever
[1:35:19] God does is beautiful but now God is
[1:35:22] here speaking to you and yet we stand
[1:35:28] off from him think about it
[1:35:32] just like God separated Adam from the
[1:35:35] tree of eternal life but then when the
[1:35:38] Tree of Life comes to us we put up our
[1:35:43] own barriers and separate ourselves from
[1:35:46] the Tree of Life and now it's no longer
[1:35:49] God separating us from eternal life it's
[1:35:54] us separating our own selves and it's no
[1:35:59] longer that the the darkness is just
[1:36:02] there but it's we allow the darkness but
[1:36:07] the Tree of Life is still here and the
[1:36:10] visitation is still here the Tree of
[1:36:13] Life is still visiting and he's visiting
[1:36:15] you this morning if you would submit to
[1:36:19] him why did the Tree of Life say repent
[1:36:22] be baptized into the name of the Lord
[1:36:25] Jesus Christ and I the Tree of Life will
[1:36:29] come into you I will lead you I will
[1:36:33] never leave you nor forsake you and I
[1:36:35] will lead you into eternal life Abraham
[1:36:38] didn't die he is still walking in the
[1:36:42] same city where he met Mike hesitating
[1:36:46] amen
[1:36:47] he met the mayor of Jerusalem and that
[1:36:54] mayor took him up into glory you know
[1:36:57] Jesus said I go and prepare a place for
[1:36:59] you
[1:37:00] you know Abraham is there Abraham knows
[1:37:04] what it looks like why because he
[1:37:06] followed eternal life and he said I go
[1:37:10] to prepare a place for you and if I go I
[1:37:15] will come again so that I can receive
[1:37:17] you to myself
[1:37:19] amen but when they stood there they
[1:37:21] stood staring up into the sky the angels
[1:37:24] God had sent angels to redirect their
[1:37:26] attention to go follow the leadership of
[1:37:29] eternal life amen and so does God need
[1:37:32] to redirect your attention from time to
[1:37:34] time because when our direction when our
[1:37:37] focus gets off eternal life we go into
[1:37:41] darkness but the visitation comes again
[1:37:44] to
[1:37:45] focus you on eternal life and let me
[1:37:49] tell you it'll be beautiful no matter
[1:37:52] what phase of life you're in right now
[1:37:54] no matter what the deep desires are of
[1:37:57] your heart no matter what it is that you
[1:37:59] want to do with your life where it is
[1:38:01] where you want to go what do you want to
[1:38:03] be or what do you want to come or or
[1:38:05] what you're looking forward to whether
[1:38:06] you're young or whether you're old
[1:38:08] the visitation is still right here
[1:38:12] eternal life has visited us this morning

[1:38:17] this morning and he is walking up and
[1:38:20] down this Isles he said wherever two or
