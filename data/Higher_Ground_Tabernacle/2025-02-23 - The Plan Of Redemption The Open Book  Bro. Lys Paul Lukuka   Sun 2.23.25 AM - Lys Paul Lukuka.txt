[Music] May for [Music] [Music] amen God bless [Music] [Applause] you amen uh we may stand and open our Bibles in re Book of Romans chapter 8 I hope everyone is doing good this morning is everyone good this morning amen praise the Lord so Romans chapter 8 um verse 19-22 the Bible says for the earnest expectation of the creature creature wait waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen for the cre the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption unto the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation creation granth and travelleth in pain together until now amen no the the the whole creation is groaning and traveling in pain because they are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God amen let's go to Revelation chapter 5 it's going to be a lengthy scripture the Bible says and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon not not even a prophet was worthy to open the book and verse four and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David ha prevailed to open the book and to lose the SE the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as he had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon on the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beast and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of ERS which are the prayers of the Saints and the song a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation amen you know when I was reading this verse I thought about um like I thought for some reason I thought about uh racism or slavery back in the days I was like how could they claim to be Christians knowing that God has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every KR people Nation so God redeemed us all it doesn't matter the call and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests a king is someone who Reigns he has made us King he has made us King and priest and we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and I love this verse here where John is saying and every creature which is in heaven every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I [Music] saying so John must have been so loud that he's saying that every creature in heaven on Earth under everywhere they heard him saying so this thing about Redemption meant so much to John that he couldn't he couldn't sit quiet and just say thank you Lord Jesus there is something about when God reveals to you the the the mystery of redemption you you can't stay still he does something to you so he said uh where was I um yes heard that saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that Seth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four be said amen and the four and 20 Elders fell down and worship him that leaveth forever and let's bow our head dear heavenly father Lord Jesus we thank you Father Lord for opening the word Lord Jesus Heavenly Father we thank you Lord because Lord you pay the price and you was worthy to open the book lord lord this this means a lot to us father Lord that you did not just do it in vain there was a purpose for which you did it Lord Jesus and Heavenly Father Lord this said this meant so much to John father Lord that he said that when he screamed everywhere they heard him screaming Lord Jesus Lord heavenly father I pray that you open our eyes this morning Lord Jesus our hearts our ears that we may also be in the same spirits that John was in The Book of Revelation we want to be the same channel that John was when the word was revealed to Him Father this book that that that we just read about you are the author of the book lord Jesus and it will take the supernatural God to reveal this to us Lord Jesus Lord we call on you to come this morning I Surrender myself to you Lord Jesus I honestly don't even know how I'm going to bring this up but Lord I pray that you speak to your your children this morning Father Lord take control of the congregation Lord you know what they need father Lord Heavenly Father the Bible says that the word discerns the thoughts of the hearts of men Lord may you speak to them this morning and we bind every Spirit of unbelief Believe In The Name of Jesus Christ and we welcome you the king of kings in this building Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may have your seats amen so this morning I'm going to talk about the Plan of Redemption and as a um subtitle I will use the title The open book [Music] amen amen so when we just read here in the Book of Revelation there was a scene happening in in [Music] heaven so when John in verse in in verse three it says and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there and verse four Bible says and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book The Prophet The Prophet explained that John wept because he saw that he was going to be the annihilation of the world John WEP because the the Earth was going to go back to its molecules everything was going to get destroyed there wouldn't be you this morning there wouldn't be a Sunday uh the 23rd because everything was going to go back to um nothing and we just read in Romans chapter 8 that the Bible is saying that even the Earth is groaning waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God so there's a certain that the sons of God have to bring that the earth is waiting for so that means that it's something that the Earth is missing it's something that creature is missing but how are they missing it because we had Adam had it in the Garden of Eden but then there the Earth is looking for it because the sons of God they lost their inheritance the prophet said they lost the title deed they lost the book in the Garden of Eden when Adam listened to Eve and Eve listened to the devil's life the definition of the word redeem means to buy back or to get or win back so it's to get back that which was lost you know get back to what get back to the position that we once had what was the position that was the that was in in Genesis chapter chapter 2 when man was ruler over the Earth and when when when Adam sinned he lost that that that that that title he lost that book and the Earth felt like it was missing it its owner like its creator because the prophet says that the Earth was given to man for men to for us it was for us that's why after when we come when we come back from heaven we return back to the Earth because the Earth us such a great inheritance but because of sin we lost it I'll read the prophet in the message the six seal 127 he says that's the reason John wept because if no one could get the book all creation everything was gone she would just simply turn back to atoms and molecules and so forth and Cosmic light and not even be creation person nothing else why he said because Adam lost the right of that book he forfeited it when he listened to his wife and she listened to Satan's reasoning instead of the word of God so because Adam did that he lost his inheritance and it's the same thing today every time you listen to the to Satan's reasoning you lose your inheritance inheritance means it's something that belongs to you who did you inherit that from from your father God himself God promis you Joy but when you listen to Satan's life then you lose that joy in Jeremiah 29 he says my plans for you is to prosper you God wants you to be prosperous in everything that you do in life in your workplace in your marriage family in your project in your church even in your city the city they're groaning they are looking for sons of God but you see you see that they're not just looking for Sons but to be they're looking for Sons to be manifested we want to see sons in actions because they are the sons of God are the boss of the Creator and I continue the same the same U quote then he couldn't go back so uh uh let me continue cuz Adam lost the rights of that book he forfeited it when he listened to his wife and she listened to Satan's reasoning inste of the word of God it was fored you know we had such a great inheritance we had the whole earth amen and now you have people that try to you know they sell their souls to Satan to try to get some inheritance from this Earth well things could could have just been as simple as just believe the word of God and you will keep your inherit the prophet says he couldn't go back into the dirty hands of Satan who tempted her out of the way so therefore he went back to its original owner like any abstract deed will do he goes right back to its original owner and that was God the Creator and he holds it so this book was a word giving authority to man and when man listen to Satan's life they lost that Authority and the prophet is saying that the book that same book we read we read in Revelation he went back to we see that in Revelation because the lamb went to take the book out of the him that sit on the throne so what did Adam lose why was he before because redeeming means we getting back to what we were before the prophet says believe on what the the word says about you that's how you overcome Satan by the word so what does the word says what were we because we are the seed of Adam and when Christ this Plan of Redemption was to get us back to the Garden of Eden let's go to Genesis 1 verse 28 and the Bible says and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply amen and replenish the Earth and subdue it and he here it is and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth so God is positioning man he's there telling them this is what you ought to do you ought to have dominion over everything that liveth in this earth and and in in Genesis CH 2: 19 to 20 we can't even see that Adam even named the animals so we have to understand that hierarchy the hierarchy is not creation is not below you you are above creation you know things because of sin things have been perverted but we ought to get back to that was Adam Adam was the god of the earth Adam was was the god of circum of all the circumstances he was he was the prophet says he was an amateur God he was in control of everything that God would even back him up to name animals but the prophet said that when he lost the title did he also forfeited that inheritance to Satan so this inheritance this earth the earth belongs to us Earth belongs to you and we see everything that liveth up on the earth needs to be under your Dominion but because of see the prophet says he forfeited that inheritance to Satan that's why the Bible says that Satan is the god of the earth you once used to be the god of the Earth but because you disbelieve the word of God you lost your inheritance to Satan in scripture 2 Corinthians 4:4 the Bible says in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not the God of this world so something got Chang because the God of this world used to be Adam that's why in Matthew chapter 4 we see that Satan tried to offer to give Jesus all the kingdoms of the earth he tried to give it to Jesus but Jesus did not uh take it that way because he knew his time would come Jesus knew what the word said about him possessing back the [Applause] [Music] Earth you patience is important you know we are in this in this journey on Earth it's a race it's a journey but sometimes you need to be patient because the Bible says that all things will be made beautiful in in in your time there is a time and a season for everything we even see that even the the this book had had to be revealed in the last [Applause] age this book could not be revealed in the first age second third or fourth he had to wait the prophet says that the the the the first six um uh uh Messengers they were reformers they were not uh uhet and the prophet says that a reform he gave an example he says it's for instance like an electrician he said that if there's an electrical problem with something if you're not an electrician you might be able to patch it up just a little bit someone with a proper qualification to come and fix the thing as it needs to be fixed the prophet said that those Messengers they were just patching things up a little bit partial Revelation but they needed to wait till the master himself the M the mighty Angel would come down and reveal the book himself [Applause] to because no one was worthy to open the to take the book they were just reformers they were patching things up I read the prophet was talking about there were there were questions being asked what was the original scene the prophet said that they were asking what is the correct baptism what is the right way and I can share this quot with you I like what the prophet said he said he said that they just guessed at it oh this says here this says that maybe this is what it means but with this this seventh mention there's not a maybe it's that which is perfect when it comes when that thing comes there's not a maybe there's a certainty because when the seven when the seventh angel begins to sound all the mysteries of God will be the prophet says that all the Mysteries will be revealed and it will not be guessed it it will be the word itself reveal himself because the prophet says you cannot interpet the word of God the word of God interpret itself and then the the word comes to the prophet in order for the word to be fully revealed there had to be a prophet they not have to have reformers they had to be a prophet and the Bible tells us that the prophet will have the spirit of Elijah the prophet tells us what was the spirit of Elijah Elijah was a man of the Wilderness he he was in the wilderness he was always preaching against women women when you identify Elijah's Ministry tell me who else have you seen in the past few years is just like Elijah remember he won't be Elijah but the word says you have the spirit of Elijah in why was the spirit of Elijah the spirit of Elijah was Christ Elijah was just a temple where in where the word came and reveal God does not break his word the Bible says the word comes to the prophet so in this Plan of Redemption there had to be a prophet in whom the word had to come God the prophet says God is a god of order the right order is the word comes to the prophet am amen amen Lord and so in order to redeem that book that we just read in Revelation chapter 5 there was a price that had to be paid there was a price that had to be paid when when man sinned God looked and he was like that's my son as a father you want to do something for your son no matter if he does something but you want to be able to redeem your son if you were you Jud of the case for let's even use the president of the US he has power to Pardon uh uh certain trans trans a perfect example we saw Joe Biden before he left office he pardoned his own Sons people criticized him for that but why was it to me that was the type of God and and his his children that's what a perfect father will do you would pardon your own son but remember God does not go against his own word word said that the soul that sin shall die someone had to die and Angels couldn't die and the prophets they they they could die but they did not had sin in their life they were born in sin because we we read about that um about the sacrifice so in I think it's in Leviticus where it says that the lamb had to be without blemish let's let's find that here uh let's go to Leviticus chapter 22 [Music] all right Leviticus chapter 22 let's start with the 17th verse and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto Aaron and to his sons and to all the children of Israel and say unto them whatsoever he be of the House of Israel let's skip to the 19th verse you shall offer at your own will a male without blemish of the beaves of the sheep or of the goat and whatsoever has a blemish that shall ye not offer for it shall not be acceptable so this sacrifice had should should not have any blemish on it that's why Moses couldn't do it because the Bible says we've all sinen and fell short of the glory of God so they were looking for a sacrifice the perfect [Music] sacrifice and we'll get back to the sacrifice but let's continue with the story so the question was so God had a uh God had a law of the kingsman Redeemer you know where the law let's let's go to it Leviticus chapter 25 verse 20 3 to 25 the Bible says the land shall not be sold forever for the land is mine for you are strangers and sojourners with me and in all the land of your possession you shall Grant a Redemption for the land If thy brother be walk and poor and had sold away some of his possession and if any of his come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold so in another message the prophet explained this verse so God had given the children of Israel a land it was the promised land and he divided it through Judah so that each tribe would have a land [Music] yeah Joshua sorry so that each tribe would have a land and then their descendant would inherit that Land If a man was poor and he needed some money and he had to sell a part of his land so that means he L his inheritance to that land in order in order for him to get it back there had to be a kinsman redeemer that came and said I paid the price to get it back the prophet goes further and he explain that if I like for instance if I had a [Applause] [Music] property and then I lost to someone um who was not part of my tribe that person could come and do whatever he wanted with that land he he held the title to the land but if in the future for instance his son came and wanted to backy to buy back that property even if someone else owned that property but if his son the rightful owner of it came back and said I want to buy this that person was obligated to sell him the land like if I'm selling my land for 25,000 and someone else came and wanted to buy that land for 25,000 I could refuse the offer I didn't have to sell him that that land a king a king the kins man person came and wanted to buy that same for 25,000 I don't even need to negotiate I have to give him the land for 25,000 that was the law of the kingsman Redeemer so according to God's law price had to be paid in order to redeem us back and we just read that the price said to be a sacrifice a lamb without BL and no one else was worthy only so God when no one was worthy God looked and he was like I have I have to help my my my my um my my sons how could he do it God made himself flesh God became a man to become our brother to become one of us he made himself in the flesh because he loved us so much God could not afford just losing us I mean he is God he could have created other people but God chose to stick with his original creation why because the Bible in John 3:16 tells us that he so loved the world it was love that projected Christ love will do amazing things in your life love creates solution to problems even in your relationship in your house when there there are problems just bring love I remember one time the prophet was talking about this couple they were having issues they were having issues and and so the the husband apparently was way too spiritual that when the wife would do something you know against the word of God the husband would used Satan I talk to instead of talking to his wife he addressing her as Satan no misplacing the word of God and his wife wanted to divorce him his wife went to and he went to the prophet crying my pray for me my wife wants to divorce me the prophet did not pray about that the prophet said that I mean she's right for one to divorce you you called her sat to her face [Music] there's a certain way you talk to people when you have issues with them or when you disagree with them the prophet told him that I'm not going to pray but this is what I'll do and buy some flowers you know show her so much love and he did what the prophet told him to do and he came back telling the prophet yeah you were right my wife came back to me love will create solutions to your marital problems you know what love will do love will even make you pray for your partner because if you love your partner so much you don't want to lose that partner Christ loved us so Christ loved us so much that he did not want to lose us what did he do he created a solution you know even the prophet when the bull came to attack him he said what prevailed it was perfect love that prevailed I even say this many people are they find Christianity boring yeah because there's not love between between you and the creator of Christianity you just need to have more love to start enjoying God you need to have more love to enjoy Sunday service and when you don't have it just ask God so a perfect sacrifice had to be created you know and in Matthew chapter 1 ver 23 says Behold a virgin shall be with a child and he shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us so now God became one of us [Music] but how did he do it he came in Simplicity the prophet preacher message God is revealed in Simplicity many times we miss God because we are looking for something big when it's just right next to you but it's too small like that you pray for bread and God gives you money but you're not realizing that that money is can has the power to buy bread whatever you pray for God that God doesn't have to give you the way you want to receive it but one thing for sure he always answers prayers like brother preach on Wednesday sometimes his answers are NOS and the prophet said that his knows is the best thing that I could ever accept so when you pray for something and you don't get it don't don't say that God is not answering to your pray as long as you check yourself with your word and you have nothing condemning you in your heart when you say that God is not answering your prayer you are making him a liar because he said ask and he shall be given so that was probably for someone here cuz that was not even in my note in first Timothy chter 3:16 the Bible says and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on into the world receive up into Glory so God became a man and on Calvary when he says it is finished he paid the price so what does that mean when he says he paid the price that mean that means he met the requirements but the prophet says that he had redeemed you but he had not yet claimed his rights you know it's pretty much when when you order something [Music] online you know you pay with your money but it takes a few days for you to receive your possession and you you you notice that you have the right when you don't receive your your your your possession you have the right to claim it I did not receive it return back my money but you know with God there's not a return back my money because the word the Bible says the word of God will not return back accomplishing that for which he was purpose always hit the target so Christ said pay the price but yet he had not claimed his right what was the right sons of God back in the rightful position why were the right rights to become Adam again right to speak things into existence right to become the god of your situation right not to be afraid when a situation comes your way but right for you to know that I am the god of this situation everything that that that moves up on the earth I have dominion over it so Jesus says that I need to to claim that back and those rights were found in the book in order for those those rights to be cleansed the book had to be open the book had to be open in order for you to become Adams again and when did happen the Bible says it happens at the seventh age we see that in the Book of Revelation chapter 10 when the mighty Angel comes down with open [Applause] so if we go back to Revelation chapter 5 so we notice that in chapter 5 the book is closed so John wept because he thought that it was the end of everything but the Bible says that the lamb went and he took the book out of the person that sat on the right hand the prophet say that's the most Sublime act ever the lamb went to take the book and no one else was worthy no one else was worthy but Jesus Christ himself came he said I am one of them I meet the requirements and and he he says give me that book so Christ took the book and that's why John was happy because he understood there was hope again for us amen amen all right let's keep reading so John was happy when he saw the the lamb took the book why was he why was he happy the prophet says he must have seen his names his name written in the book hallelujah hallelujah you know when you see your name written in the book of the Lamb's Book the the Lamb's Book of the Lamb's [Applause] Book you can't stay still you are no longer the same person you don't need nobody to motivate you to worship God you don't need someone to tell you stand up in order to praise the Lord you don't need to wait for your brother or your sister song says it's not my brother not my sister but it's me why because God Did It For Me The Prophet says that if the Rapture comes takes place and they said only five people had to go you have to have the right Faith to think that if those five people are got to be one of them why because the book has been revealed to you God has revealed himself to you he made he made himself personal to you I was reading the uh I was reading I was listening to a sermon uh Redemption by Fellowship by Redemption the prophet says it's different to just come to church and get healed when you speaking Tong or hearing the word and all that he says even your faith is not enough he says what pleases God is the fellowship with God what pleases God he wants to fellowship with you and God does not have a time where he only one time that he fellowship with you the Bible says I pray that you I wish that you pray everywhere fellowshipping with God in your workplace in your heart fellow with God in your closet fellowshipping with God because only those who fellowship with God will be raptured because Adam walked I mean Enoch walked with God and he was raptured God Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever if you want to be raptured you got to start walking with [Applause] God don't wait for those big steps start taking those baby steps the prophet says if you canot even have faith to be healed of a headache or to thick how are you going to have faith for the Rapture but you realize that God brings situations in our lives to build our faith this morning I'm telling you God wants to fellowship with you God for that Fellowship God is looking for sons and daughters who put everything aside and how do you fellowship with God you don't Fellowship in the head but you got to be in the spirit you are to be in the right channel in order to receive from God and one thing is if you are not receiving something don't give up there is an appointed time for you to receive when Jesus Christ came to the the thief on the cross his appointed time was on at the cross and you know what I love about God's appointed time is that when it's your time nothing will stop you when it's your time to be delivered there's not enough demons in hell that can stand it the the the man of God he was he was tormented for so many days years cutting himself but when his time came even though he had Legions of demons in those Legions could not stand the presence of the Living God those demons cannot stand the presence of the word made I repeat it again those demons could not stand the presence of the word made flesh what you need to do is eat the word let the word become flesh in you let the word the prophet says the more you eat of the word the more you build resist against that used to easily be set you now you have power over it how does he do you had to you have to become the word wait for your appointed time don't give up you are struggling with a certain spirit and you've been praying for it over and over I'm telling you that God is working on you as long as in your heart you desire to be delivered from that means that God is working with you it's not no man can add a cubid to its stue the Bible says after you've done all you can stand check the word make sure you make the requirements as long as you meet the requirement leave it up to God to I promise you as long as you are a son or daughter of God he will not leave anyone behind I'm telling you this morning that God will not leave you behind has not forgotten you whoever you are this morning have hope Jesus says I wrote your names in the palm of my hand Jesus said I cannot for forget you when Christ took the book he came back to claim his right you are his right you are his right you are his right don't look at your brother or sister look I am his right for me I don't care if my brother or my sister don't go by him I will go he will not leave you behind he loves you and right now he's working on you you could have you could have decided not to come to church on a Sunday morning you there are some people they just stay home they don't even feel are you coming here it's not you it's the word that's bringing church and why is the word bringing you there is a change that need to be done what brings the change is the word brother s Paul cannot change you cannot change you Brooks cannot change you only the word of God can change you what you have to have is to have confidence in the word have confidence in what the word says about you believe the word of God you and the house shall be saved put your hopes in a man build your house up on the right foundation who is the right is Christ the word and the word had had been perverted but we had promised in Mal 4 that we would receive a prophet that would rest when the word is open he makes you third Adams the third Adam is not just one man because when the word is open you become Adams you do the things that Adam did do the things that Eve did but the only difference is that this Adam will not fa brother and sister the first Adam fell the first Adam fell the second Adam came in that was Jesus Christ he gave us the blueprint he did not fail and he said the Bible he says all that was in God was pour into Christ that's why and all that was in Christ was P into you what does that do to you it makes you third Adam back to your position you have the authority of the word the book is open the book is not closed anymore there was someone worthy to open the book Satan thought that he [Applause] won oh this morning Satan might think he want in your life because he want to keep you blinded but the word came this morning and he opening your eyes Brothers open your eyes sisters open your eyes you are more than Overcomers because the word is [Applause] open amen amen Let's uh in the the message the bridge between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals paragraph 19 the prophet says its Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by all legal possessions brother this so much in in this word don't just read this word just as it not like it's a random book start meditating on your on the word of God this book chapter 5 Revelation chapter 5 has a lot of meaning in your in your Lifey Revelation 10 has a lot of meaning in your life stud the word it's saying that that redemption mean that all legal possession that Adam was L what all that to do to a born again Christian it's legal possession to the abstract deed the title deed of eternal life it means that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost hlu oh what of it brother that's right the possession of that deed that's what Revelation chapter 5 means to you redeemed you but he had not yet claimed but we see that he went in Revelation 5 and he claims his rights so Christ the lamb he CH he took the book and we see that what does he do after he takes the book let's go to Revelation chapter 10 amen you know because God loves you so much he didn't want to keep when he took the book now he's like let me go give it to my sons the word came to you that's the mercy of God we don't go to the word the word he left heaven the angel came down because he's like I got to give this book back to to to it to its [Applause] owner they lost it in the Garden of Eden but now I come down to give you what belongs to you Brothers it's your inheritance sister it's your inheritance it belongs to you oh don't fall short of it apply everything you do in the apply that to the spiritual everything you do in the natural applies that to the spiritual if you heard that your a bank or someone gifted you $1 million but it's it's somewhere in a bank in Chicago for instance I don't think you sit here just ignore that [Music] even right after service today you will take your car and drive through 5 hours but you realize why would you do that because you understand the importance of that I wonder if many times we are not possessing our rights because we don't understand what it means to us do we really understand what it means to get back to the position that Adam was and if you don't then ask God to give you that Revelation you would go get the million dollar and you will tell them it belongs to me they'll ask you what's the proof you will give them the proof re oh brother this inheritance belongs to you this is the receipt this is the proof the mighty Angel has come down and you have been you have been able to see him the word Vindicated God even allowed the human cameras to take a picture of it because Satan would not have any excuses every promises in the book is your Satan is robbing you of that pointing back to 1963 because when the mighty Angel comes down let's just read in Revelation 10 you see that the book is open Revelation chapter 10 and I and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven with a cloud and a rainbow was up on his head and his face was as it as it were the Sun and his feet as the pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open so this book is no longer closed all the mysteries of God are open oh Brothers Paul waited for this day the reformers they were looking for this day the prophet said they could only guess at that but now there's no more guessing because the owner of the book is coming down with the open book he broke the seals and now the book is open and you notice that well let's keep reading let's keep reading and and he cried with a loud voice and when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders outter their [Applause] voices and when the seven Thunders head out of their voices I was write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me see up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them and the angel which I saw stood stand up on the sea and up on the earth lifted up his hand to to heaven and you swear by him that leaveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that there in and the earth and the things that they are in and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer the mighty angel coming down was at the end time there there's no more time time shall be no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets begins to sound the mystery of God what is the mystery of God is Christ revealed the mystery of God is Christ the prophet preached the message Christ is the mystery of God even in the title The Prophet is already telling you what the mystery you know they say they say I don't know if I should say this but they say that some people believe that the Seven Seals have not been the seventh seal has not been revealed because when you when you read the if you listen to the message the seventh seal you can see that brother Ram when he was preaching he did not say what it was and he said the angel kept him from saying it but you have to know that also the prophet's life the way he did things it's it is the word in some in some and I'll prove it to you in a second I believe that had to happen that way for a purpose you know because the prophet says that Matthew chapter 24 Jesus preached on the six seals he preached on the six seals but he he did not speak about the seventh there's always that mystery about the six he preached on the six seals but he did the prophet says he omitted the Serv and we see that when brother brother B was preaching on the seals he preached on the six seals and the seventh he did not say anything let's bring this into let's a parall so Jesus preached on six seals but the seventh seal he did not preach about and he died on the cross brother Bram preached on The Sixth Seal and when he gets to the seventh he couldn't preach on it but then we see that when Jesus on the road to emus the disciples uh did they were blinded they could not recognize Jesus Jesus it was not revealed to them yet what did Jesus do he start he took them back to the word what did he start doing he started preaching to them revealing to them who Christ is if you read that you will see that Jesus started unveiling himself in the word in other word if you read that chapter if you have to give the title of the sermon that Jesus preached to the disciples why would you name it Christ is the mystery of God revealed because Christ is and the brother B he also does the same thing six the seventh one he does not talk about but we see he also comes back a few days later he says you want to know what the mystery is Christ is the mystery of God Christ is the mystery of God revealed because it's import the Bible says that all the Mysteries will be uh revealed at the sounding of the Sabbath Angel so he could if you he could not go before revealing the seventh the the seventh because that'll break the word that's good that would break the word but the word cannot be broken H let's just read it together to make sure that we're reading this together he said in verse seven but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of [Applause] God should be left undone the mystery of God I want you to read it yourself should finished what does the word finish that means there's nothing left to be revealed and then you you notice it it's one it says mystery not Mysteries the prophet says what is that it's the mystery that holds all the Mysteries together amen amen and I will read this one other quotes one second let's go to the message the bridge between the seven churches and the Seven Seals paragraph 41 if you can project that so the prophet says and when the seals are broke so let's understand what is happening in Revelation chapter 10 the mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ setting setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head the rainbow is the Covenant Angel Christ himself the Covenant angel coming down but we see that when he's coming down the book is open but notice also what the prophet is saying he say but now remember that the seventh angel is on Earth at the time of this coming so the prophet is saying that when the mighty Angel is coming down this Earthly Angel is also on Earth at the same time and it goes fur he says just as John was giving his message the same time that Messiah come in the days John knew he would see him why because he was going to introduce him the prophet is comparing this seventh angel to what John did John was on Earth when the Messiah came the word of God comes to the prophet the only way you're going to recognize Christ is if the word unveils Christ to you and we realize that in the scripture over in Malachi 4 there is to be a one like John in Elijah to whom the word of God can come to and he is to reveal by the Holy Spirit he says all the mysteries of God so how can you say that the seventh still is not revealed it was a secret it's a secret and but you know he would reveal his secrets to only his redeemed maybe what you need to do get on your knees fellowship with God like a husband and wife the married couples can can testify to this or even people who have been in relationship when you love someone so much you Fellowship so much with that person you have a habit of revealing secrets to that person you don't even mean you oh I didn't mean to say and God is the same way he say shall I hide what I'm about to do in to [Applause] Abraham God does not have a habit of hiding his stuff to his his [Applause] redeemed and Jesus is also saying shall I hide it to my bride [Music] oh no he cannot because we see that in Revelation the angel did not keep it to himself he came and he gave the book to John the prophet says that book had all the mysteries of God and now the book was in the hand of the Bride so that means and you notice he didn't give the book to everybody only to John and the prophet tells us that John is the type of the Bride so not everybody can see all the mysteries of God just because you come here on a Sunday morning and you see down brothers and sisters I'm telling you that even Satan comes to church on Sunday not everybody here in this I hope everybody is of God but not everybody and when Satan come what does he do the Bible says in order for Spirit the prophet say in order for a spirit to be affected he need to use a body Satan comes and he sit down in these PWS and what is he going to try to do to distract you from the word of God you know if you if you if you have a chance to to read the the introduction of the book The Seven Church age I love what the prophet says there he says I can never emphasize on the importance of Revelation he says Revelation means more to you than you ever realized very important he also says when you like it doesn't take comparing scripture with scriptures he doesn't take having the ability to write or read but remember what Jesus told Peter the flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven has revealed and the prophet in the seven Church AG book in the beginning he says this he says not everybody will be able to catch the mystery behind the seven church he says he will take a special class of people to be able to get it he'll take a special class of people is that special class looking at because if Christ could come and die for you that means you have to be so special that he offer his blood for you so not everybody so don't even fast or argue with those people that says not the are not revealed but don't put them away too you know some the prophet says that he compar the the pennies some can only take as much as they can like they're not builds for that but it doesn't mean they're not Christians you still need to love them you still need to treat them right because the the some of them will be washed in the tribulation and the Bible says I saw tens of thousands of thousands of thousands of them up there serving God because if you mistreat them then you mistreating God because in heaven they are Servants of God and Jesus says if you if you mistreat the my servant if I send you a servant you mistreat them yeah you've not rejecting them but you rejecting how are you special the world the world looks at you like how are you able to love someone who just did something that's what a special class of people is someone does something hurtful to you you can forgive brother say if you want to measure your love for someone don't don't look at how you love the person that right but love your enemies the prophet says that's when you know you got it when you he he said remember now it's not something that you it's something it's not something made up it has to be real don't f it if it's not there it's not there ask God for it and he'll give it to you but something just in your heart that when your brother is doing something evil to you you come to church you get on your knees and you pray for them brother if you want to know if you've made it get to that level Prophet call love I'm taking too long sorry let me just wrap it up with a few things here so we see in Revelation 10 that the book is open and we see that and when I went unto the angel I said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and you shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey you know what I love about the mercy the mercy and the grace of God is that he comes to you he knows that you are a man you are full of failures and he comes to you John did not go to the mighty angel in heaven the mighty angel came down with a book the book had a message the book is this message of the hour and the grace of God is that you did not go to the message the message came to you mess has found you why because you are one of his when you hear the message you hear your name in the book when you receive the message that means that your name was written in the book of because if it was not you cannot receive it but so many people confus is receiving the message and agreeing with the message you know in the prophet the message in the talk in the message the prophet says you can't agree with this message you can't even believe this message but if the token is not applied you and when the token is truly applied you will want to do the father's will If the message says that men should not drink you fight it if the men if the the message says that you you should not drink you abstain from it if you are struggling with it I'm not telling you to give up but I'm telling you to keep fighting because the Bible says to resist the devil tried to even resist it in your heart you want to overcome it you know you want to overcome but you have to resist and you have to leave it up to God so the book and the because the book is open you can't overcome it I'm going very slow sorry give me just another 15 minutes and I'll WP you so um let me just read this one at the quot again uh in the seven the same message the bridge between the seven Church ages so by now in the paragraph 251 by now in the seven Sevenfold book of seals of redemption that the lamb took with him himself was the only one who could do [Music] it and he took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne to claim his Redemptive TOA his right to claim for me and you what he redeemed us from he claimed it for you and me back to everything that Adam Lost In the Garden of Eden the prophet says he has redeemed us back to that he did not say he will redeem us back to that or he is redeeming back us back to but he has so that means that now you have the same position with go brother this is very powerful if you can only catch this Revelation I pray that God drops this Revelation in your heart that's why the Earth is groan they're looking for sons of God have that Revelation that's why the the mother aost went to the prophet and the prophet says she came at 10:00 in the [Applause] morning and they they are creatures of night so they could not even see in the day how did they get in in front of the prophet's gate the apost somehow knew that there was a Son of God somewhere when he the prophet says he might have gotten into an accident or something she might got but she knew that there was a Son of God somewhere so she could not see dur in the day they don't see you in the day so God had had to be the one that led the apost to the prophet sometimes God bring situation in front of you so that you can show them that you are the God of this earth when you lose a job I'm telling you that the book has been open and you can't speak a job the book has been open you can't speak your loved ones into salvation the prophet did that to show us you know our position so the went to the prophet and she laid there in front of the G several days and when the prophet prayed to God God told him that you call this mother of Pome a good mother a out of but I sent her to your gate and she's still lay I wonder if it's some of us this morning God sent us mothers in our lives several days but we keep on just complaining what because but he sent those situation so that we can control it do you know maybe God allow for you to be the only believer of the message in your family so you can show so you can speak them into uh the message brothers and sisters you can do it brother Bram did that with head right you know head right she believe the word and then the prophet says because you believe the word ask what you will and you shall be given and she said she asked for the Salvation of her children and the prophet say I give you your children you see he did not say God gives you your children he said I give you your children why because I am the god of this Earth why what makes me the god of the earth is when the god Liv inside of me what is your situ this morning the book is open speak the word speak the word if you need money speak money brothers and sisters the word of God cannot fail and sometimes ago I was preaching in Iowa City and I told them that the word of God cannot [Applause] fail I told them to take God at his word word and ask what they they need and he will be given to them why I had not confidence in my words confidence in the word of God yeah I didn't I didn't say it God said it my duty to back up his word it's three the Bible God says challenge me God loves to be challenged brother the word of God is the truth what I preach to you this morning is the truth the word is open the word is revealed and I'm telling you this morning it means that you have the authority to speak things into exist and I challenge you this morning in the name of Jesus Christ if you do that you will see that come to pass my and when I when I told them that a young couple they needed money they did not even want to wait till when they go home that same sermon they prayed I told them if you need money ask God and he'll give it to you prove him and he's going to tell you
