[0:02] and uh I was speaking with the Lord
[0:05] today and uh one of the things I I don't
[0:09] know what prompt me to say what I said
[0:13] but I know something came in my
[0:16] spirit and uh I I want everybody here to
[0:20] know I have one
[0:22] interest and that is
[0:25] to see the souls that God has made me
[0:30] responsible for see Jesus face in
[0:34] peace I'm not about your money I don't
[0:37] care whether you like me or not I really
[0:39] don't because I realized that everybody
[0:42] didn't like
[0:43] Moses but his whole purpose was to bring
[0:46] them to the promised land and uh you
[0:49] know I I just uh realize I'm realizing
[0:53] more and
[0:54] more uh that I want to be different I I
[0:58] don't want to be ConEd considered uh
[1:01] what people call a message church
[1:03] because when I think of that kind of a
[1:06] term or that kind of a thing I see a
[1:09] people who have settled down and people
[1:11] who have adopted a religion a form a
[1:15] fashion and they have forgotten what
[1:17] they've been called to do we've been
[1:19] called to do one thing and that is to
[1:21] declare that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:24] yesterday today and forever amen I'll do
[1:27] my best by the grace of God to stick as
[1:29] close to this message as I possibly can
[1:32] and I just desire your prayers that God
[1:34] would give me strength Amen in the midst
[1:37] of adversities Amen as we stand let us
[1:40] turn to two passag of scripture we'll be
[1:43] coming from Hebrews
[1:45] 3 Hebrews
[1:48] 3 and then we'll go to uh 2 Corinthians
[1:52] the 11th
[1:54] chapter Hebrews
[1:57] 3 and we'll begin reading the first
[2:02] verse wherefore holy Brethren partakers
[2:05] of the Heavenly calling consider the
[2:08] Apostle and high priest of our
[2:10] profession Christ Jesus partakers of the
[2:13] Heavenly calling who was faithful to him
[2:16] that appointed him as also Moses was
[2:20] faithful in all his house for this man
[2:23] was counted worthy of more Glory than
[2:27] Moses in as much as he who had builth
[2:30] the house hath more honor than the house
[2:35] for every house is builted by some man
[2:38] but he that built all things is God and
[2:42] Moses verily was faithful in all his
[2:44] house as a servant for a testimony of
[2:47] those things which were to be spoken
[2:50] after here's the punchline for
[2:54] Christ as a son over his own house whose
[2:58] house are we amen If We Hold Fast the
[3:02] confidence and rejoicing of the Hope
[3:05] firm unto the End Amen wherefore as the
[3:09] Holy Ghost saith today if you would hear
[3:12] his voice Harden not your heart as in
[3:15] the provocation in the day of Temptation
[3:18] in the
[3:19] wilderness when your fathers tempted me
[3:22] proved me and saw my Works 40 years
[3:27] wherefore I was grieved with that
[3:30] generation and said they do always a in
[3:34] their heart and they have not known my
[3:37] ways so I swear in my wrath they shall
[3:41] not enter into my
[3:43] rest here it is 12th verse take heed
[3:46] Brethren lest there be in any of you an
[3:49] evil heart of unbelief in departing from
[3:53] the Living God but exalt one another
[3:57] daily while it is called today lest any
[4:00] of you be hardened through the
[4:02] deceitfulness of sin amen let us turn
[4:07] also to Corinthians please 2
[4:09] Corinthians 11th chapter we're going to
[4:12] read verses
[4:18] 1-4 would to God ye could bear with me a
[4:22] little in my Folly and indeed bear with
[4:27] me for I am jealous over you with Godly
[4:31] jealousy for I have exposed you to one
[4:34] husband that I may present you as a
[4:37] Chase verion to
[4:39] Christ but I fear lest by any means as
[4:42] the serpent beg gal Eve through his
[4:45] subti so your mind should be corrupted
[4:49] from the Simplicity that is in
[4:51] Christ for if he that cometh preaches
[4:54] another Jesus whom you have not preached
[4:57] or if you receive another Spirit which
[4:59] you have not receive or another gospel
[5:02] which you have not accepted you might
[5:05] well bear with him but I suppose I was
[5:08] not a wit behind the very chiefest
[5:12] Apostle let us pray father God we come
[5:15] before you Lord as humbly as we know how
[5:17] we thank you for your grace we thank you
[5:19] for your mercy we thank you for your
[5:21] love divine and father we just pray Lord
[5:24] that you would be merciful to us this
[5:27] this evening give us Lord what we stand
[5:29] in need of Lord and we'll be careful to
[5:32] give you the praise the glory and honor
[5:34] in Your Name Lord Jesus Christ Have
[5:36] Thine Own Way amen and amen you may be
[5:39] seated we said on the other day that we
[5:42] was going to be we're still ministering
[5:44] on the age of a Perfect Bride the age of
[5:48] a Perfect Bride and we showed by the
[5:51] grace of God Amen how God brought Eve
[5:55] out of Adam brother brandom said their
[5:57] Spirits could not be separated because
[5:59] they were one one of the scriptures I
[6:02] read this evening Hebrews the 3r chapter
[6:05] it really blessed my soul because amen
[6:08] we find out that Paul said he wanted to
[6:12] uh I'm sorry yes Paul wanted to uh
[6:15] basically let's turn there by the grace
[6:17] of God my thoughts just got confused
[6:19] quickly we realize by the grace of God
[6:21] that here we find God dealing with the
[6:26] Jews and giving them warning that if
[6:29] they're not careful amen that they would
[6:32] fall in the same place Israel fell
[6:35] because of their unbelief they had seen
[6:38] the mighty works in the mighty hand of
[6:41] God but we find out amen it just somehow
[6:45] the enemy caught a hold of them and
[6:48] because of their
[6:49] unbelief right not so much in Moses but
[6:52] in the things that Moses preached they
[6:55] were uh grumbled they murmured and they
[6:58] never crossed over amen I want you to
[7:00] understand that God intent God's intent
[7:03] was for Israel to come into a Promised
[7:06] Land amen but I want you to understand
[7:09] these things are not easy uh we suffer
[7:12] while we're traveling but if we could
[7:15] look at the end results it would give us
[7:18] joy Amen brother bandham talks about a
[7:21] little boy there on you must be born
[7:23] again that your short version and he was
[7:26] talking about a little fellow who was
[7:27] more like a little boy but he was
[7:29] in a bicycle uh contest and what they
[7:33] did they had to ride this board straight
[7:36] to the finish line and all of the boys
[7:39] uh before him uh tried but they failed
[7:43] and he watched these guys as they were
[7:44] on the board and they constantly look
[7:47] down instead of looking up and so this
[7:50] little boy who everybody thought perhaps
[7:53] was not going to make it or do it right
[7:55] he observed all the others and he found
[7:58] out that they were were not doing it
[8:01] just right so he took their error and he
[8:04] and he and he uh um progressed by it and
[8:09] and what happened was uh the little boy
[8:12] won the contest he stayed on the board
[8:14] without falling off of the board and
[8:17] this is what he said they asked him the
[8:19] question um how did you do it he said I
[8:22] noticed that while you were riding you
[8:24] were looking down at the board to make
[8:26] sure you stayed on the board he said but
[8:28] to me I looked to the end and kept it
[8:32] steady right amen so I want to encourage
[8:35] you tonight look to the end am and keep
[8:39] it steady it's going to be difficult
[8:42] amen listen dying is not an easy thing
[8:45] speaking of dying I've had uh a a close
[8:49] brother in the Lord just died last week
[8:52] H an uh uh high school buddy of mine
[8:57] died last week I mean those four four
[8:59] young men four young people that just
[9:01] got killed in that plane I knew two of
[9:03] them I mean dearly the other two I was
[9:05] so uh familiar with but uh my point is
[9:09] they would come and travel just to hear
[9:11] me preach when I would go down to Texas
[9:13] so I knew them and uh you know so it's a
[9:16] lot of pain going on then uh my one of
[9:20] my close friends up in New Jersey who
[9:22] God healed when he was a drug addict he
[9:24] was a pimp he was a drug Pusher amen he
[9:28] he had AIDS but he didn't get days from
[9:30] being a sodomite well he was a sodomite
[9:33] but not with men you know what I mean
[9:35] but my point is he overcome AIDS and he
[9:38] was such a
[9:39] testimony there in New Jersey and New
[9:42] York and now I just a year ago we had
[9:45] some good fellowship with brother Jose
[9:48] and I got a call yesterday or day before
[9:50] yesterday that he was dying and just got
[9:52] a few more days to live uh you you know
[9:56] the point is I know the man saved
[9:59] nobody can't tell me what the Holy Ghost
[10:02] can't do and I I just I believe that God
[10:05] gave me this news just in the Nic of
[10:08] time because I saw a man who had scars
[10:11] on his body had a reputation people
[10:14] people of a big hit man trying to kill
[10:17] him and God God had him behind the door
[10:21] and the man couldn't even see see him
[10:22] behind the door look right at him and
[10:24] couldn't see him amen why because he was
[10:27] bride amen God protects his own so now I
[10:32] I'm I'm I'm working with this because I
[10:34] know by the grace of God we're going to
[10:36] either get focused or we're not amen I
[10:38] can't make it for you you know I it I
[10:43] was telling somebody the other day folks
[10:44] as well you know everybody have their
[10:48] struggle one of my biggest struggles are
[10:50] my children I've seen lots of folks
[10:54] saved filled with the Holy Ghost but
[10:56] with my own with my own it seemed like
[10:58] it just
[11:00] staggering I don't worry about it
[11:02] because God promised me my children but
[11:04] every now and again there's a battle
[11:06] there y'all understand me amen uh the
[11:09] sacrifices that we've made and like I
[11:11] said even when it came to the disciples
[11:15] they said Lord we have left everything
[11:17] we left our jobs we left our families we
[11:19] left everything Lord and now we want to
[11:22] know what what's in for us what kind of
[11:24] reward we going to get and Jesus Christ
[11:27] told him he said I'm going to give you
[11:28] my Brothers fathers sisters and mothers
[11:31] I'm going to give you eternal life and I
[11:33] am going to also give you some suffering
[11:34] with it so you might as well know that
[11:37] we're here to
[11:39] suffer y'all hear what I'm saying now by
[11:42] the grace of God I wanted to say we uh
[11:45] we we're talking about a Chase virgin
[11:47] we're talking about presenting unto
[11:50] Christ and I don't know about you but
[11:51] I'm really excited about what God is
[11:54] doing in my life in particular and and I
[11:58] look at this thing and I I I've said to
[12:00] you by the grace of God no matter what
[12:02] you say or what you do it is not all
[12:06] about that it's about election and until
[12:10] we get a true Revelation that you as an
[12:12] individual have been elected you're
[12:15] going to still and continue have all
[12:17] troubles in your
[12:19] mind in your heart if you really believe
[12:22] and know that you are
[12:24] elected how could I say it like I heard
[12:26] the prophet of God say it this night
[12:27] tonight before coming to church on you
[12:29] must be born again he said before God
[12:32] even pulled the calcium in the pot as
[12:35] together he said he had you in mind now
[12:39] you think God is going to do all of that
[12:42] and let you go he said no matter what it
[12:44] looks like is still under God's
[12:48] control right God has it all under
[12:53] control God has allowed me to be here so
[12:57] that we can see things that God is
[13:00] requiring of us in this day now people I
[13:04] you know I don't care I could have had a
[13:06] mega church H you know I mean I I mean
[13:09] it could have if I wanted to put on a
[13:10] show I could have done
[13:13] that there's a lot of preachers in this
[13:15] message that's giving people a good
[13:17] time famous name preachers but what's
[13:21] happening to people I'm not being
[13:23] changed and this is what we want we
[13:25] won't
[13:26] change I was thinking today I said what
[13:29] what a what a what a a saying even in
[13:31] the world though it's a perverted way
[13:33] they says man he's hot she's hot and I'm
[13:36] thinking that's the way the bride ought
[13:37] to be in the correct way in the correct
[13:41] way y'all hear what I'm saying in the
[13:43] correct way is what we ought to be but
[13:47] the devil has stolen from us basically
[13:50] what we ought to be and if we could just
[13:51] hear what he's saying and bring it back
[13:54] into this right perspective you and I
[13:56] would be okay amen
[13:59] oh come on
[14:01] somebody so we look at this thing and we
[14:03] saywell uh brother Brooks what are you
[14:05] saying no my point is this in even in
[14:08] the statute of a perfect man brother B
[14:10] said you can't even start adding on to
[14:12] nothing until you baptized with the Holy
[14:14] Ghost till there's a new birth to that
[14:17] seed is quickened he said now that's
[14:19] just the
[14:21] beginning right that's just the
[14:23] beginning and then what that Holy Ghost
[14:26] is there to kill you every day
[14:30] amen that's why Paul say I Die daily the
[14:34] Holy Ghost is to kill can I yall
[14:36] understand in other words the Holy Ghost
[14:38] is there to get you to surrender to him
[14:41] every day he's a gentleman he's not
[14:44] going to make you but if you could look
[14:47] at the end of it and see how glorious
[14:50] you'll be at the end then the Press is
[14:53] not so
[14:55] hard yes when we look at this thing and
[14:58] you know you know all of us have things
[15:00] that we've got to overcome anybody know
[15:02] what I'm talking
[15:03] about there's not one of us amen who
[15:06] could say I've made it already Paul said
[15:08] I even though I pressed toward the mark
[15:10] of a high calling he said I haven't
[15:12] attained it yet but I pressed and this
[15:15] is a
[15:17] prophet so you and I must understand all
[15:21] Heaven and Earth eyes are on you and
[15:25] I you have been chosen to be the Perfect
[15:29] Bride of Jesus
[15:34] Christ I'm going to say it again you
[15:37] have been
[15:38] chosen to be the perfect bride of Jesus
[15:42] Christ Glory it's not good enough to
[15:45] think about oh how good Esther was and
[15:47] what Esther did you're Esther Esther was
[15:50] just a type of you and so she looked at
[15:53] what the king desired and her desire and
[15:56] this is what I said the right mental
[15:59] attitude toward the word will cause God
[16:02] to respond
[16:04] amen come on somebody even if you don't
[16:07] have the faith you can say Lord help my
[16:09] unbelief so it's all in your hands it's
[16:13] what you confess is out of your mouth a
[16:16] lot of time people have rain storms over
[16:18] their head all the time because that's
[16:19] what all they cry out oh it's raining
[16:22] it's raining all you don't see that
[16:23] cloud it's raining it's thundering it's
[16:25] lightning and just as soon as you create
[16:27] that atmosphere it's going to going to
[16:29] thunder and lightning sir just the other
[16:31] day yesterday to be exact I wanted to do
[16:34] something and it just looked like a
[16:35] storm was going to really strike and
[16:37] from the distance it looked like it was
[16:39] coming I heard the Thunder I heard the
[16:40] lightning I said but Lord this is what I
[16:42] want to do and as I drove it got lighter
[16:45] it got brighter the next thing I knew
[16:47] the clouds would roll back amen and I
[16:49] thought God you did that for me I don't
[16:51] know what anybody else was praying but I
[16:53] knew what I wanted to do right so you
[16:56] look at these things and I thought this
[16:58] is what we must understand brother
[17:00] brandom said God is supposed to be so
[17:03] much in your life you can talk to him
[17:05] like a person like he like he's right
[17:07] there like a buddy that's what he wants
[17:10] right that's the kind of communion God
[17:13] wants amen turn with me now Hebrews
[17:18] 9 you love the Lord people of God it's
[17:22] it's really just learning how to die I
[17:25] believe amen a lot of us whether you
[17:27] felt it or not the Holy Ghost is there
[17:29] because you know brother Ram said amen
[17:31] when you craving for more
[17:33] God that's a birth that's God in there
[17:37] saying I got to have more more of him to
[17:40] grow more of him to grow more of him to
[17:43] grow but he will not cross over your
[17:48] will you determines your growth by your
[17:52] will how fast or how slow act right
[17:57] right
[18:00] one thing about this diet we don't have
[18:02] to worry about it whether it's healthy
[18:03] or
[18:05] not everything God put out is Health
[18:08] Food amen spiritual health food amen
[18:12] Hebrews 9:1 19-23 I'm not going to stay
[18:14] I try not to be too long for when
[18:18] Moses for when Moses had spoken every
[18:22] precept to all the people according to
[18:24] the law he took the BL
[18:27] uh I think I'm in the wrong
[18:35] place yeah I'm in the right place
[18:41] somewhere hold on it's coming
[19:16] well I tell you well let's go to the eth
[19:18] chapter it's not the scripture that I
[19:19] had in mind but I believe God is able
[19:22] he'll bring it back to me you love the
[19:26] Lord okay let's go to chapter 8
[19:29] amen begin beginning at the 19 uh the uh
[19:31] nth
[19:33] verse let's go to eth verse for finding
[19:36] fault with them he said behold the days
[19:38] come said the Lord when I will make a
[19:39] New Covenant with the house of Israel
[19:42] and with the house of Judah not
[19:43] according to the Covenant that I made
[19:45] with their fathers in the day when I
[19:48] took them by the hand to lead them out
[19:50] of the land of Egypt because they
[19:52] contined not in my Covenant and I
[19:55] regarded them not sayeth the Lord for
[19:57] this is the Covenant that I will make
[19:59] with the house of Israel after those
[20:02] days said the
[20:03] Lord I will put my laws into their mind
[20:08] and write them in their hearts and I
[20:11] will be to them a God and they shall be
[20:14] to me a people amen and they shall not
[20:17] teach every man his neighbor and every
[20:20] man his brother saying no the Lord For
[20:24] All Shall know me from the least to the
[20:27] greatest is that the word
[20:29] Jesus said in that day you will know
[20:31] that I am in the Father the father's in
[20:33] me and I am in you is that all right
[20:38] amen for I will be merciful to their
[20:40] unrighteousness you hear what I'm saying
[20:42] though the law come God said I will be
[20:45] merciful to their unrighteousness and
[20:48] their sins and their iniquities I will
[20:50] remember no
[20:53] more amen ever thought he had me choked
[20:56] up and then God gave me even better
[20:59] ain't God good but here the the the the
[21:02] the the the scripture that I wanted to
[21:04] bring amen is where Christ was saying uh
[21:08] let's let's turn let's turn to uh
[21:11] chapter 10 of of
[21:13] Hebrew here's Jesus saying then said I
[21:16] lo I come in the volume of the book it
[21:19] is written of me to do thy will oh God
[21:22] right above when he says sacrifice and
[21:25] offerings and burn offerings and
[21:27] offerings for sin thou would not neither
[21:30] have a pleasure therein which are
[21:32] offered by the law then said he lo I
[21:35] come to do thy will oh God it take away
[21:38] the first that he may establish the
[21:40] second by for by which we will we all
[21:45] Sanctified through the offering of the
[21:47] body of Jesus Christ once for all now I
[21:50] don't know about you but I believe that
[21:53] that my sanctification comes through
[21:55] Jesus
[21:56] Christ it ain't the will worship it
[21:59] ain't I do this and I do that if I do
[22:01] this if I don't it is because he
[22:03] Sanctified me and when you receive Jesus
[22:06] Christ in your heart that justification
[22:09] and that sanctification comes by the
[22:11] same Faith y'all hear what I'm saying
[22:14] the same
[22:15] Faith amen so we are in a place amen if
[22:19] we don't make a Rapture it is not God's
[22:23] fault he has Min ministered unto us
[22:27] abundantly
[22:29] but no
[22:30] unclean will enter that City
[22:34] none is that all right no unclean will
[22:39] enter that
[22:41] City amen turn with me to Galatians

[27:36] trying to tell you God was going to keep
[27:39] working on
[27:40] you you don't want like I said like like
[27:43] like I heard the prophet of God said
[27:44] this is what he said he said the devil
[27:46] ain't
[27:47] nothing Jesus said that God God uses his
[27:52] finger get rid of Satan but guess what
[27:55] he mean you mean so much to you he said
[27:59] God takes you puts you on his
[28:03] shoulder think about a finger versus a
[28:05] shoulder he takes the strongest part of
[28:08] you to Bear you up when you need
[28:13] him huh you say well I I listen let me
[28:17] tell you a lot of y'all don't realize
[28:18] amen what God is doing for you and I say

[28:25] here you're still the same

[28:30] you're not cleansed by your own thoughts
[28:32] you cleansed by the blood of the Lamb

[29:03] amen God ain't looking at your scores
[29:05] none of us would make it if that be the
[29:10] case he said we ask for comfort and
[29:12] peace give us God give us the best he
[29:16] could give us trials and tribulations
[29:19] that's better than comfort and
[29:24] peace why cuz he knows if he can keep

[39:32] Lord I know I'm a Christian I he said
[39:33] but your name ain't on the
[39:35] book well you got to appeal at the white
[39:37] Throne judgment Hallelujah I don't have
[39:39] no choice I'm going to appeal he said he
[39:41] traveled through that life he said and
[39:43] all of a sudden everything that was so
[39:44] little became black and
[39:47] dark nobody wants to go there come on
[39:51] somebody if you can avoid the white
[39:53] Throne judgment do it am don't risk
[39:57] your
[39:58] life give it to our hearts tonight tear
[40:01] out the old Stony heart place into us
[40:04] that new heart the heart of Flesh the
[40:07] heart that you that can talk to and deal

[40:51] in
[40:54] you I don't know how else to say it amen
[40:57] I'm looking at this thing and I want you
[40:59] to understand amen that this there is a
[41:01] process and we can assume this is not a
[41:04] time to assume when brother randam has
[41:06] said that the Bride of Jesus Christ will
[41:09] be at his coming will be so much like
[41:11] him measure yourself where are you in
[41:14] your life where are you and if you're
[41:17] not there thank God for the grace amen

[41:22] you can see and says Lord restore me
[41:25] Lord amen do something on inside of me
[41:28] and cause me to focus that nothing in
[41:31] this world should matter to me more than
[41:33] anything I want to be just like
[41:36] you he said now you desire that God is
[41:39] favorable to you right God is favorable
[41:42] to
[41:43] you oh my amen Ephesians 3:9 Ephesians
[41:47] 3:9
[42:07] it goes on to saying to make all men see
[42:09] what is the Fellowship of the
[42:11] mystery fellowship with the mystery what
[42:14] the mystery is the mystery is Christ
[42:16] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[42:19] right the mystery of Jesus Christ
[42:21] fellowshipping with him is the mystery
[42:25] that's the mystery that's been revealed
[42:28] which from the beginning of the world
[42:30] have been hid in God who created All
[42:33] Things by Jesus Christ you know what I
[42:36] loved about this I said because the
[42:37] Bible said that Christ was the head of
[42:39] his own house the Builder of his Builder
[42:42] the Builder of his own house who house
[42:46] are we so it's Christ in you building
[42:50] you growing up into Christ and the Bible
[42:54] said if Moses was faithful so is Jesus
[42:58] Hallelujah he is faithful to build you
[43:02] Hallelujah he is Faithful over his own
[43:05] house which are
[43:07] you you oh should I be worried No get
[43:12] born again let the life of God start in
[43:15] you and he that begun to get work in you
[43:18] faithful to complete
[43:24] it and to make all men see what is the
[43:28] Fellowship of the mystery which from the
[43:31] beginning of the world have been hid in
[43:33] God who created All Things by Jesus
[43:36] Christ and then the word according to
[43:38] the Book of Revelation the third chapter
[43:40] I think it was uh said Jesus Christ the
[43:43] first verse talks about Jesus Christ
[43:45] being the creation of God the beginning
[43:48] of creation hello and we are his
[43:51] Brethren if God made a Creator the G
[43:55] listen the Bible said uh uh
[43:59] uh sacrific is an offering he said I

[47:48] crazy but I'll say like this my mama she
[47:49] didn't whip me too many times she didn't
[47:51] but there was one time she whooped me
[47:54] and I'm telling you right now because of
[47:56] that same whooping like I tell people I
[47:58] say she was John the Baptist she went
[48:00] down to the root of the
[48:02] tree she didn't cut no limbs off brother
[48:05] and I'm telling you it was such an
[48:06] humiliating experience for me but had
[48:09] not she done that I probably would have
[48:11] been dead or in prison right now cuz she
[48:14] didn't she she wasn't just looking she
[48:15] wasn't looking at that that that she was
[48:18] looking at the Harvest of that thing
[48:20] what that thing was going to break forth
[48:21] in my life and to this day when I get to
[48:23] heaven I'm going to tell her thank you I
[48:26] never told her thank you while she
[48:28] lived when I see her I say thank you
[48:31] thank you Mama amen you must be born

[48:47] gets so when he gets M form he starts in
[48:53] sin if he can hold them just in the
[48:56] right ious man a good man just let him
[48:59] go ahead and try to be good like that if
[49:03] he can hold him like that until he has
[49:06] he he's dead that's just what he wants
[49:08] to do he's got him because no matter how
[49:11] righteous you are how good your your you
[49:16] how good you matter how right you are
[49:19] and how good you how moral you are how
[49:22] clean you are how honest you are you'll
[49:25] never go to heaven until you're born
[49:27] again Jesus said so you've got to be
[49:31] born again you've got to be regenerated
[49:35] that word regenerated means New Birth
[49:40] reproduction renewal the product of a
[49:43] new life consecrated to God the word
[49:47] often used to denote the restoration of
[49:50] something to its original
[49:53] state ah ah and that's what the the he
[49:57] opening of the seals were right right
[50:00] the
[50:01] seals was The
[50:04] Messengers the Thunders was the voice of
[50:07] The Messengers right and each seal uh uh
[50:11] brother says Seven Seals is to loose the
[50:16] Ministries right from Paul all the way
[50:19] up it was sealed right and those seals
[50:23] were to loose the ministry but what what
[50:26] was the ministry to bring you the will
[50:28] of God it was a voice of God coming
[50:31] through what we call Thunders oh come on
[50:35] somebody and when God Echoes those seven
[50:37] Thunders what was it brother brand said
[50:39] God ordained me to to to tie tie up the
[50:42] Loose
[50:44] Ends he went through every Thunder every
[50:47] message and he tied those loose ends
[50:51] up H so we could have a perfect word
[50:54] amen so we can understand a true
[50:56] justification so we can understand a
[50:58] true sanctification Hallelujah so we can
[51:02] understand the requirements of God to
[51:03] make a Rapture it's all about making a
[51:07] Rapture
[51:09] amen you must be born again he said and
[51:14] the new birth is nothing less than a
[51:20] mess H this is what your Prophet said I
[51:24] I I'm thinking about what other
[51:26] preachers say I'm saying what he said
[51:28] the new birth is nothing less than a
[51:30] mess you get up from the altar crying
[51:33] and booh
[51:35] hooing and carrying on it makes a
[51:38] starchy church till you don't uh have to
[51:42] do that see that's what the star of
[51:45] church says but through that new birth
[51:48] brings new life Hallelujah you can only
[51:52] have it as you're ready to get you you
[51:56] can only have it as you're ready to get
[51:58] all messed up when you're ready to get
[52:01] messed up you can get it when you get
[52:04] the stars out of you when you get away
[52:07] from the self-styled hypocrisy that we
[52:10] live in today and we are willing to pray
[52:15] pay the price and lay these lay there
[52:18] until you are dead to the things of the
[52:21] world and reborn Again by the Holy
[52:25] Spirit he said listen he said they they
[52:27] bypass that see people bypass that see
[52:32] and every time I try to preach it they
[52:33] say I'm Pentecostal huh let me tell you
[52:36] something I don't know no other way than
[52:38] what I hear him say you know oh I
[52:40] believe that's okay if God can give it
[52:43] to you like that that's good but that's
[52:45] just the beginning that's just the
[52:47] beginning folks have you received the
[52:49] Holy Ghost since you believe was the
[52:50] question that's just the beginning the
[52:52] new birth is just the beginning we're at
[52:55] a we're at a place for adoption all the
[52:58] other age they measured up to what they
[53:00] supposed to be but we're supposed to
[53:02] come into a perfect statue of Christ
[53:05] amen oh how I'm going to do it every
[53:08] time you know I'm going say like this
[53:10] you cannot do it that's the point I'm
[53:11] trying to tell you you can't do it
[53:13] there's no building adding on to you
[53:15] until the foundation is laid when that
[53:18] birth has come through it say in faith
[53:20] amen it adds on to you that's what he
[53:22] said in statute of perfect man he said
[53:24] you don't add he keep talking about
[53:25] adding on adding on adding on and I used
[53:28] to try to add on and add on and add on
[53:30] and he said you can't do it that's not
[53:32] the way you do it well I know I'm
[53:33] supposed to live right so I can't do
[53:35] this so I know I'm supposed to do this
[53:37] so I can't do that he says no if the
[53:39] light comes in you it will do
[53:42] it it will do it little by little it
[53:44] will do it I Hey listen nobody can can
[53:48] convict you except the Holy
[53:53] Ghost huh
[53:57] is the true well I know I'm not supposed
[53:58] to lie so I better not lie that ain't
[54:00] going to work cuz the next time you look
[54:02] around you'll be telling another lie
[54:05] that's the way it work but if you get
[54:06] the man who's the truth in you even if
[54:09] you slip and make it wrong he going to
[54:11] make you make it right that's just the
[54:14] way it goes you love the Lord amen turn

[54:28] just want to see God move in here and my
[54:31] point is whether we jump and shout and
[54:33] run up and down these eyes I don't even
[54:35] care about that no more my interest is
[54:37] now is to see the Life of Christ formed
[54:40] in us that's all I'm caring about right

[54:46] to see life not religion
[54:49] life that's all that
[54:52] matters CU I realize amen you know we've
[54:55] had some good time s in here I mean the
[54:57] holy spirit is falling in here I've seen
[54:59] God do things in here but I'm still
[55:01] looking for life he said what what you

[55:05] I'll know it when I see
[55:09] it I'll know it when I see it amen
[55:13] Revelations
[55:22] 4:11 Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive
[55:25] glory in honor and power for thou has
[55:28] created all things for thy
[55:32] pleasure they
[55:34] are and
[55:36] were
[55:39] created you mean to tell me all I'm
[55:41] going through has been for his pleasure
[55:45] absolutely because if you Rec recognize
[55:48] what he has the Bible Paul says let me
[55:50] tell y'all something the suffering of
[55:52] this world cannot even be compared to
[55:55] the glory which my Father in Heaven has
[55:57] in stored for you can't even be compared
[56:00] let me tell you something I do not want
[56:03] to stand before God like a
[56:06] fool that I would trade heaven for
[56:12] this and I know I'm going to die ain't
[56:15] no ANS ifps or butts about it you and I
[56:18] were going to die unless we're taken by
[56:21] a Rapture am but if you live old enough
[56:25] and you ain't got to be old enough die
[56:27] hello ain't no way I want to stand
[56:30] before God and tell God not I saw this
[56:34] Glory of yours but I had rather the
[56:36] world oh my god listen Moses had better
[56:40] sense than that he saw the beauty of
[56:42] Egypt and the Bible said he didn't even
[56:44] want to suffer it to be called the son
[56:47] of the pharaoh's daughter he had rather
[56:50] be named among the slaves and about the
[56:53] the the the the the the the mud doers
[56:55] amen and and say I go this route cuz
[56:58] this is temporal Hallelujah see when you
[57:01] know you come from
[57:03] above when you know you come from God
[57:06] and you're going back to God Amen you
[57:08] realize I'm From Another World if there
[57:10] be such thing as an alien I'm
[57:13] he so therefore I'm going to walk like I
[57:16] come from above I'm going to talk like I
[57:18] come from above that's my desire and if
[57:20] I desire it God will give it to
[57:24] me God will give it to me
[57:29] the scripture I'm missing and I think
[57:30] that's where I wrote it down wrong
[57:34] uh is
[57:37] uh can the Potter
[57:40] say to the
[57:45] clay but anyway I don't I I don't know
[57:47] what I did with it but by the grace of
[57:49] God Revelations 4:11 have I read that
[57:52] yet Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive
[57:55] glory and power why because everything
[57:57] was created created for him turn with me
[58:00] let let you don't have to turn but 1st
[58:02] Samuel 10:1 it tells about a man whom
[58:05] God did not choose to be king his name
[58:07] was
[58:08] Saul and you know what God did he took a
[58:11] little vow Samuel comes and he anoints
[58:13] Saul showing by the grace of God a
[58:16] little anointing can position you but it
[58:18] won't keep
[58:19] you huh y'all hear what I'm saying it
[58:22] might it might it a little anointing
[58:24] will position you but but it won't keep
[58:26] you right so we understand that's what
[58:30] happened to the denomination they have
[58:31] the spirit of salt the anointing came
[58:33] down a little anointing amen positioned
[58:36] them but it wasn't able to keep them
[58:38] right but when you come to King David
[58:41] look what happens to him amen when
[58:43] Samuel comes he brings a horn of oil and
[58:46] that's in 1st Samuel 16
[58:48] 111-113 and what happened even that that
[58:52] horn of all you said what do you mean it
[58:54] was a bigger
[58:56] it wasn't just a flask it was something
[58:58] bigger more
[59:00] oil more oil amen was poured onto David
[59:03] and David made a lot of mistakes but
[59:05] look what happened David knew who to run
[59:08] to right David never tried to cover his
[59:12] sins like Saul
[59:14] did right Saul like blame everybody else
[59:19] and David even though he was a man of
[59:20] judgment when the word came and said
[59:22] David that's you he
[59:24] repented right
[59:26] but you think that's something look what
[59:29] David was a man after God's Own Heart is
[59:31] that right and look at kind of anointing
[59:34] David God but listen there's a greater
[59:37] than David
[59:39] here Luke 7 please let's turn
[59:46] there there's another scripture I want
[59:48] to tie into that but let's turn to
[59:49] Luke's yeah uh yeah Luke 7 Luke 7 let's
[59:52] go there I think
[59:54] it's you love God
[59:57] and I'm almost done this is my last
[1:00:02] scripture but where are we coming where
[1:00:04] are we going I'm not done with this this
[1:00:06] subject uh where where we're going with
[1:00:08] this you know I'm trying to just by the
[1:00:11] grace of God just say okay now we can't
[1:00:15] and I can't explain what I'm seeing I I
[1:00:17] just can say it we're not a church as
[1:00:20] per se is what people call Church what
[1:00:23] the world call Church that's not Church
[1:00:27] a church is a separated people for the
[1:00:30] use of God it's not an organization it's
[1:00:33] not a denomination when we come here we
[1:00:36] said we come to church but in reality
[1:00:38] that's not a
[1:00:40] reality we come and we we we we we
[1:00:43] gather together when we come here it's a
[1:00:45] gathering of the
[1:00:47] churches because each and every one of
[1:00:50] us we are the
[1:00:52] church and that's what God called those
[1:00:54] feasts a gathering
[1:00:57] because he understood by the grace of
[1:00:58] God that each individual is a tabernacle
[1:01:01] know you not that your temple is a b the
[1:01:04] Tabernacle of God so you look at this
[1:01:06] thing you say okay we're coming together
[1:01:08] but each and every one of our churches
[1:01:10] ought to be carrying on service 24/7 if
[1:01:16] possible church service if you want to
[1:01:18] say it like this worship and praise
[1:01:21] supposed to be
[1:01:24] continually going on in our lives Luke 7
[1:01:28] beginning at the 37th
[1:01:32] verse and behold a woman in the city
[1:01:34] which was a sinner when she knew that
[1:01:37] Jesus sat at the meat of pH uh Pharisees
[1:01:40] house brought an alabaster box of
[1:01:43] ointment and stood At His Feet behind
[1:01:46] him weeping and began to wash his feet
[1:01:50] with tears and then wiped them with the
[1:01:53] hairs of her head and kiss his feet and
[1:01:57] anointed them with the
[1:02:00] ointment
[1:02:02] now now when the Pharisees which had
[1:02:06] bitten him saw it he spake within
[1:02:10] himself saying this man if he was a
[1:02:12] prophet would have known who and what
[1:02:15] manner of man this is that touch him for
[1:02:18] she is a sinner and Jesus answered and
[1:02:21] said unto them him Simon I have somewhat
[1:02:24] to say unto thee
[1:02:26] and he said Master say on there was a
[1:02:29] certain creditor which had two debtors
[1:02:32] the one owed 500 p and the other one 50
[1:02:36] and when they had nothing to pay he
[1:02:38] frankly forgave them both tell me
[1:02:40] therefore which of them would love him
[1:02:45] most all I could think about when I read
[1:02:48] this is not just
[1:02:51] individuals I think about our age this
[1:02:55] is layout
[1:02:57] there have never been sin on the earth
[1:02:59] like in our age I mean come on folks I
[1:03:03] mean gross darkness in this age you know
[1:03:08] so much so that God didn't see nothing
[1:03:10] he could even brag
[1:03:12] on and here he comes and forgive
[1:03:17] us justifies us as though we've never
[1:03:19] sin in the first place right set us in
[1:03:22] Heavenly places
[1:03:26] and he says now which is going to love
[1:03:28] me the most which
[1:03:30] age which one of these
[1:03:32] ages out of the seven is going to love
[1:03:36] Jesus the
[1:03:37] most the one who's forgiven the
[1:03:41] most the one who's forgiven the most
[1:03:44] this is this woman representing you
[1:03:47] prostitute and the only thing she had
[1:03:49] was her her her working money come on
[1:03:52] somebody and she comes and she see Jesus
[1:03:55] like in this age right now nobody's
[1:03:59] paying him attention all of the churches
[1:04:01] invites him there and he sets there with
[1:04:04] dirty feet come on he walks in the door
[1:04:07] you feel the anointing people sit there
[1:04:09] they ignore him the preacher preach
[1:04:12] nobody says amen hardly nobody do
[1:04:14] anything and here this woman amen looks
[1:04:17] at him and the Bible says she stands
[1:04:19] behind him she bows herself she gets on
[1:04:22] her knees she washes feet she washes she
[1:04:25] cries she's literally giving her all to
[1:04:28] him oh come on somebody that's our age
[1:04:31] and the Bride of Jesus Christ for this
[1:04:34] age supposed to be giving everything
[1:04:38] everything in the midst of a starchy
[1:04:43] Church you go to these places and they
[1:04:46] all inviting it but nobody's really
[1:04:49] worshiping it like they ought to they
[1:04:52] forgotten they've been forgiven you
[1:04:55] forgotten where you used to be you
[1:04:57] forgotten amen what God brought you out
[1:04:59] of come on somebody there's always
[1:05:01] something to praise God for y'all hear
[1:05:03] what I'm saying come on and here they
[1:05:06] were criticizing I don't care amen who
[1:05:09] criticize you shouldn't care when it
[1:05:12] comes to your
[1:05:14] Lord come on somebody amen why would you
[1:05:17] care if what somebody thinks about you
[1:05:20] if you washing his
[1:05:23] feet you see you coming to church I've
[1:05:26] been there many times in these message
[1:05:28] churches you go there and you want to
[1:05:30] worship and everything else and

[1:06:00] preacher I probably end up joining you
[1:06:02] Hallelujah why because I realized this

[1:06:32] at the right the right place and the
[1:06:34] wrong time amen amen they didn't like
[1:06:37] her because of who she was and she had
[1:06:39] to think about it before she got into
[1:06:40] that
[1:06:41] place Hallelujah ain't nothing wrong
[1:06:43] with you thinking about it when Once the

[1:07:10] do what is which is pleasing to my
[1:07:12] father I come not to do my own
[1:07:18] will that's the problem all of us have
[1:07:21] our own will but the father that sent me

[1:15:04] this little group of people that he's
[1:15:05] given to me and be able to present it
[1:15:07] like Paul said as a Chase version of

[1:15:20] of God I trust that something is
[1:15:23] stirring in you and if it is that's life
[1:15:26] and you feed it you feed it you feed it
[1:15:28] you feed it and that's just what I've
