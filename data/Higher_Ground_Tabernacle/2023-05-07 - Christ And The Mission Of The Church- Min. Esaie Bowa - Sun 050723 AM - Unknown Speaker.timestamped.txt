[10:20] anybody that happened hand
[10:24] hey man just remember the youth meeting
[10:27] in Iowa City here this afternoon at two
[10:29] o'clock those that can make it amen
[10:33] you feel young you're invited amen so
[10:36] brother Keith you're invited
[10:38] [Music]
[10:45] are there any prayer phrase reports that
[10:48] we might have this morning
[10:53] report
[10:58] amen this brother can you shine
[11:05] just share with you one that was very
[11:09] close to my heart I shared some of it I
[11:11] think a week or two ago my son-in-law
[11:15] who lives about a couple hours from here
[11:17] had a hunting accident and they thought
[11:21] they were going to have to remove the
[11:22] eye they took him over to Iowa City
[11:24] hospital and
[11:27] um
[11:28] got the opportunity to go down and visit
[11:32] with him and pray over him and it was
[11:36] I think just as ongoing prayers
[11:41] we are very familiar with us as we
[11:44] we cry out to the Lord and
[11:48] Friday morning we've got a test report
[11:51] back he had a procedure where the
[11:55] they were just trying to figure out if
[11:58] the retina was detached
[12:01] and put in a brand new lens
[12:04] they found out that the doctor the two
[12:08] of
[12:09] surgeons that had about five people
[12:12] operated running found out that the
[12:16] the eye had ever been a chance to be
[12:20] returned back to 2020
[12:23] and it was just a huge prayer report
[12:28] prayer report
[12:32] I can't begin to tell you even though it
[12:35] wasn't my blood brother or son it was
[12:40] truly one that is very close to me he's
[12:43] a big man he's a six seven man he's
[12:48] probably 275 pounds but I I get a
[12:52] a good hug from him every time I see him
[12:55] and it's not forced a force dog like
[12:58] maybe some of you men have expressed
[13:00] maybe my hugs are too hard on you I
[13:03] don't know but I love I love hugging you
[13:06] and greeting you so that's my praise
[13:09] report and uh
[13:12] what's the scripture say these
[13:17] what are some of the reports that we are
[13:20] able to report because we know that
[13:23] we've cast out a devil or we've taken up
[13:26] a serpent or we've drank something
[13:29] poisonous it's not harmed us
[13:33] also says that we lay hands on the sick
[13:36] and they shall recover
[13:39] and we're able to report Jesse is
[13:43] recovering
[13:44] so God bless you thank you for listening

[35:57] let's see where the prayer
[35:59] [Music]
[36:22] the best context that there is in here
[36:26] Lord we don't know anything
[36:29] and you know everything
[36:32] you sent your word

[36:47] that it assists every one of us
[36:57] and it brings back The Lost One
[37:03] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[37:16] now this morning we're going to talk
[37:18] about Christ and the mission of the
[37:20] church
[37:21] we're going to go in the Book of Matthew
[37:24] chapter 28.
[37:26] from Verse 18
[37:29] to verse 20.
[37:33] then we'll read in Mark 16.
[37:37] verse verse 14 to 20.
[37:41] the name of Jesus Christ
[37:44] Jesus
[37:48] and Jesus came and spent unto them
[37:51] saying
[37:55] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[37:57] in Earth
[38:00] the discipline go he therefore and teach
[38:04] All Nations
[38:08] baptizing them in the name of the father
[38:10] and the son of the son and of the Holy
[38:12] ghosts
[38:16] teaching them to observe all things
[38:18] whatsoever I have commanded
[38:21] [Music]
[38:24] no I am with you always even unto the
[38:27] end of the world
[38:29] says let's go to Mark chapter 16.
[38:40] those are the last words of Jesus Christ
[38:42] in every gospel that we read
[38:46] Christopher because in chapter 28 Christ
[38:49] is raptured there
[38:55] he's living his words to his disciples
[38:59] in Mark 16
[39:03] we're going to read the last words of
[39:05] Jesus Christ
[39:07] verse 14 says
[39:12] afterward he appeared onto the eleven as
[39:15] they sat at me
[39:19] and upgraded them with their unbelief
[39:24] with their unbelief and hardness
[39:29] because they believe not them which had
[39:32] seen them after he was ready and he said
[39:35] unto them
[40:34] and sat on the right hand of God
[40:38] two and they went forth and preached
[40:40] everything
[40:44] the Lord working with them and
[40:47] confirming the word with signs
[40:50] the Lord bless the reading of his word
[40:53] you may regain your seat
[40:56] foreign
[42:01] and he operated them with their unbelief
[42:06] and hardness of their hearts
[42:11] because they believed not them which had
[42:13] seen him after he was risen
[42:16] I want you to understand
[42:19] and that you noticed okay
[42:22] those are the Disciples of Christ is
[42:32] the highest rank in the minutes
[42:36] [Applause]
[42:42] it means that they were not believed
[42:45] I want you to understand
[42:50] near the end you're going to see
[42:54] the first uh Acts chapter one
[43:17] from
[43:19] what Jesus was doing from the beginning
[43:31] given Commandments unto the apostles
[43:37] [Applause]
[43:39] he appeared unto them Allah
[43:42] says now you you see that it's the the
[43:45] continuation of Mark Mark 16.
[43:48] after he suffers
[43:51] he appeared unto them alive
[43:53] [Applause]
[43:54] and giving them multiples
[44:00] them for 40 days
[44:04] speaking of things pertaining to the
[44:06] kingdom of God
[44:07] and being assembled together with them
[44:14] that they should not depart from
[44:16] Jerusalem
[44:19] but wait for the promise of the father
[44:49] [Applause]
[44:56] it is not for you to know the times or
[44:58] the season which the father has put in
[45:00] his own power
[45:02] but he shall receive power
[45:06] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[45:10] he shall be Witnesses unto me
[45:14] [Applause]
[45:16] and in all Judea in Samaria and on to
[45:20] all other all the other most part
[45:23] [Applause]
[45:36] [Applause]
[46:20] before they receive the holy
[46:57] [Applause]
[47:19] they had to receive
[47:40] of the Earth
[47:46] [Applause]
[47:53] they were apostles
[48:00] so before you receive the Holy Ghost
[48:03] you are still an
[48:06] unbelievers
[48:08] no matter how long you've been in the
[48:11] message
[48:13] no matter the knowledge
[48:17] you are still an unbelief
[48:23] Jesus Christ
[48:51] baptizing them in the name of the father
[48:54] and the sons
[49:04] he told us that no one was ever baptized
[49:07] in the name of the father Son and Holy
[49:08] Ghost
[49:11] [Applause]
[49:28] without a name
[49:56] [Applause]
[50:02] they're not even names they're titles
[50:17] so you are also our father
[50:22] now how can God not happening
[50:30] when people ask yourself
[50:41] and be baptized
[50:44] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:48] the remission of your sins
[50:53] and he shall receive the gift of the
[50:56] Holy Ghost
[50:58] sit downstairs
[50:59] and it's only in that name that people
[51:02] were baptized
[51:04] where there was an act now
[51:08] people were still baptized in the name
[51:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ that is the
[51:13] name of God
[51:20] he shall receive us
[51:23] the holy ghost coming down upon you
[51:26] and he shall be my Witnesses
[51:31] now who do we call a witness
[51:35] a witness who is a witness
[51:38] es
[51:41] because we have to know what witness
[51:44] means
[52:42] Jesus wanted us
[52:55] [Applause]
[53:10] where are you going to tell to people
[53:13] amen right gasket
[53:19] what proof are you going to give as a
[53:22] proof of the resurrection of the Lord
[53:24] [Music]
[53:26] you have to become aware
[53:28] and faithful witnesses
[53:31] witnesses of the world
[53:33] witnesses
[53:36] witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:43] if we have heard of something
[54:00] what have you heard
[54:04] what have you seen
[54:06] amen
[54:08] for you to report it to people
[54:25] it's not for you to know this
[54:32] [Applause]
[54:59] will disappear then
[55:02] amen
[55:03] amen
[55:06] my brothers and sisters
[55:08] we Are Witnesses
[55:11] and we have to be Witnesses
[55:14] and as I said
[55:18] we're talking about Christ and the
[55:20] mission of the church
[55:24] what is the mission of the church
[55:29] as I said the first mission of the
[55:31] church is to be witnessed
[55:34] Witnesses of the resurrection of the
[55:36] Lord
[55:37] Christ the resurrection
[55:42] does not leave us passive
[55:56] to become active
[56:01] the resurrected Christ
[56:08] he fills us with his powers
[56:11] for us to become his heart
[56:14] who has to become soldiers of Jesus
[56:18] when a soldier receives a formation
[56:23] when he gets a training he doesn't just
[56:25] do whatever
[56:27] but when the soldier is
[56:30] that training is for him to go on the
[56:33] battlefield
[56:34] it's for him to go fight
[57:16] who hurts the church
[57:27] then he fell
[57:30] then he said
[57:36] why do you persecute me
[57:40] he said yes
[57:43] who are you Lord and I'm person who I'm
[57:46] persecuted
[58:01] [Applause]
[58:34] [Music]
[58:46] in the same German why Christ
[58:49] he says I think a man or a woman ain't
[58:54] got soul in the fish a boy or a girl
[58:59] with a an intellectual conception of the
[59:02] word
[59:05] he says he thinks that that person can
[59:08] never get to a perfect company
[59:12] until they meet that light
[59:16] Paul met the light on his way up to the
[59:19] way of Demands
[59:22] that light that brings the word to a
[59:25] reality
[59:27] and I think that no church
[59:30] with their practices
[59:34] no matter how intellectual that church
[59:37] is
[59:39] that church can never make Progressive
[59:47] Supernatural it makes itself known
[59:51] and that they see it delicate
[59:55] something with whom they can speak
[59:59] under that thing responses
[1:00:02] and we'll vindicate this written word
[1:00:05] yes my brothers
[1:00:09] the church will never make progress
[1:00:13] no matter how intellectual that church
[1:00:16] is
[1:00:17] fundamentalists
[1:00:21] [Applause]
[1:00:23] no matter how dressed
[1:00:26] so how intellectual they are
[1:00:30] the church will never make progress
[1:00:33] until the supernatural
[1:00:37] makes itself known to those people and
[1:00:41] that they see it and that they hear it
[1:00:46] something they can
[1:01:28] this church needs Prosperity
[1:01:32] it needs to face that thing
[1:01:35] is
[1:01:45] not the Gatherings of people
[1:01:58] you are the temple of God
[1:02:16] [Applause]
[1:02:47] [Applause]
[1:02:55] artificial Christianity
[1:02:59] where when you want to yeah
[1:03:42] it's the Christian first
[1:03:50] a good education
[1:03:54] but the problem is today
[1:03:57] even Christians
[1:04:00] we find that they're not well educated
[1:04:06] now what did you do in school
[1:04:10] because
[1:04:14] God give us three instructions
[1:04:17] the first instructors
[1:04:21] parents who will receive us when we came
[1:04:23] out
[1:04:24] they start educating us
[1:05:06] who are preaching the word
[1:05:26] what did you come to do here
[1:05:33] so we have three instructors
[1:05:39] and the instructors in schools
[1:05:48] respectable respectful people
[1:05:52] come on
[1:05:53] methanol now
[1:05:56] you you meet someone
[1:06:00] and you only see that he's only an
[1:06:02] intellectualism Ministry intellectualism
[1:06:05] is not enough
[1:06:07] whether you went to college
[1:06:10] whether you had any uh
[1:06:13] it's not enough
[1:06:16] if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:06:19] the the comforter
[1:06:22] who can comfort you unto the shows us
[1:06:26] when you you'll have enough of
[1:06:28] Everything
[1:06:29] Jesus said
[1:06:31] he says
[1:06:34] I will pray the father
[1:06:36] and he will send you another comforter
[1:06:40] and when he will come
[1:06:42] he will speak of me
[1:06:47] now we need that
[1:06:49] now
[1:06:55] we believe that when you have the Holy
[1:06:57] Ghost
[1:06:59] s
[1:07:02] now before you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:07:04] you're not a Believer yet
[1:07:11] the Bible says
[1:07:16] the Lord is
[1:07:19] um
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:33] the Lord does amazing things in the
[1:07:36] house of the Saints
[1:07:48] that the Lord is amazing in this room
[1:07:52] now just be serious
[1:07:56] now be serious to yourself
[1:07:59] can you say
[1:08:02] that the Lord is so amazing in this room
[1:08:05] can you say that
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:21] that shakes this hour
[1:08:35] to shake this hour
[1:08:42] the church had to be filled with people
[1:08:46] Divine Healing should have been in
[1:08:48] church
[1:08:49] speaking in tongues
[1:08:52] should have been in church
[1:08:56] healing
[1:09:08] and the prophet of God
[1:09:10] that Divine Healing
[1:09:13] is is the the cat the cat the the the
[1:09:16] the
[1:09:17] comments something that you use to catch
[1:09:20] the fish
[1:09:46] he's not going to get on to get on it
[1:10:21] [Applause]
[1:10:43] [Applause]
[1:10:47] we need that bait
[1:11:01] Christians don't speak in tongues no
[1:11:03] more
[1:11:05] they lost everything
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:12] the other generals of Christ
[1:11:16] the generals
[1:11:19] were there to save the soul
[1:11:22] make of all my in the United Nations my
[1:11:25] disciples
[1:11:26] yes my brothers and sisters now
[1:11:31] we call ourselves we call church
[1:11:36] we call ourselves church but we have
[1:11:38] priorities
[1:11:40] because the first priority
[1:11:43] the church
[1:11:46] where the salvation of the soul sister
[1:11:49] if you are saved
[1:11:52] you would want somebody else to be saved
[1:11:55] just like you yes
[1:12:00] you would not want anybody to be saved
[1:12:03] too
[1:12:03] [Applause]
[1:12:05] may God bless you
[1:12:09] [Applause]
[1:12:28] are you saint
[1:12:52] can that way of doing things bring
[1:12:54] someone to believe
[1:13:03] can that bring Christ in the life of
[1:13:06] someone who doesn't have Christ
[1:13:10] you have the answer yourself
[1:13:18] the church was supposed to have a
[1:13:20] priority
[1:13:21] and the priority was to was to save the
[1:13:25] lost
[1:13:26] but today
[1:13:28] as a church
[1:13:30] everyone has his own priorities
[1:13:33] he has his priorities of having honors
[1:13:38] I have a priority of having money
[1:13:43] she has a priority of being known by
[1:13:46] everyone
[1:13:48] those are the priorities the people
[1:13:52] they don't go along with the words
[1:13:57] [Applause]
[1:14:00] to save the souls
[1:14:09] [Applause]
[1:14:13] my disciples
[1:14:18] now
[1:14:20] you're looking for money you're looking
[1:14:23] to be elevated and then me I'm looking
[1:14:26] forward
[1:14:32] then we call ourselves Church
[1:14:34] you lie to yourself
[1:14:38] you are mistaken
[1:14:43] the first priority
[1:14:47] is to look for it to search for the
[1:14:50] souls
[1:14:51] everywhere
[1:14:53] your actions
[1:14:56] the way you live
[1:14:58] what's supposed to be a sermon
[1:15:03] saving the songs
[1:15:07] it's for everyone it's for all the
[1:15:10] Believers
[1:15:15] it says in
[1:15:18] the sermon the previous experience the
[1:15:22] first Supernatural experiences
[1:15:24] the first spiritual experiences he says
[1:15:27] this
[1:15:29] is equity he says listen
[1:15:32] um
[1:15:37] the calls are without repentance and
[1:15:40] gifts are without words
[1:15:41] if you have been called
[1:15:44] with a gift
[1:15:48] you should have known that long time ago
[1:15:53] without repentance foreign
[1:16:26] [Applause]
[1:16:33] [Music]
[1:16:50] [Applause]
[1:16:59] [Applause]
[1:17:19] you have to pray for the sick amen amen
[1:17:24] amen priority the priorities
[1:17:27] the mission that was sent to the church
[1:17:31] the Supreme Christ in the life of those
[1:17:35] but through the world
[1:17:38] the way we do things
[1:17:41] do you bring Christ to the life of
[1:17:45] someone without Christ
[1:17:48] and brother brought him says
[1:18:04] then we have to represent him
[1:18:08] representation how can you represent
[1:18:10] Jesus
[1:18:12] you have never met that life
[1:18:15] personally individually
[1:18:17] [Applause]
[1:18:23] that's why everybody is quiet
[1:18:27] now that servant had to be it had to be
[1:18:30] pricked
[1:18:31] I'm not talking about sins I'm talking
[1:18:34] about the words
[1:18:37] that means that you know that somewhere
[1:18:39] I know that you're not in order what's
[1:18:41] crying
[1:18:43] I didn't call any sins do you understand
[1:18:46] that everybody
[1:18:48] feels concerned
[1:18:51] amen hallelujah amen
[1:18:55] the word of God is everything
[1:19:00] you can't preach the gospels
[1:19:04] and not wait and not and not expect
[1:19:06] people to be hurt the secular Prophet
[1:19:08] the judge that's what the prophet of God
[1:19:11] you can't preach the gospel
[1:19:13] and then expect and then people are not
[1:19:16] hurt
[1:19:17] people will always be hurt
[1:19:24] I'm giving myself reproaches on many
[1:19:27] things
[1:19:31] [Applause]
[1:19:32] it doesn't make me the perfect one
[1:19:34] because I'm standing here
[1:19:37] I have a lot of things some things
[1:19:50] and you're a statue
[1:19:53] and your stature

[1:20:08] of a country
[1:20:11] in another country
[1:20:28] against the
[1:20:31] word of God
[1:20:36] becomes an ambassador says
[1:20:39] is a person who has been given a mission
[1:21:11] [Applause]

[1:21:44] let's be Witnesses of Jesus Christ
[1:21:48] no fair oh no brothers
[1:21:51] I saw this person
[1:22:07] Jesus Christ himself
[1:22:12] a lot of times
[1:22:15] the person who says the person who says
[1:22:18] I saw this person
[1:22:22] that same person forgets that he also
[1:22:25] did the same thing and somebody else saw
[1:22:27] him
[1:22:48] heard you
[1:22:50] hello
[1:22:51] we're not here
[1:22:53] to kill each other
[1:22:56] we are one family
[1:22:59] the church is one family
[1:23:22] we have jealousy for each other on
[1:23:25] unnecessary jealousies
[1:23:31] uh
[1:23:35] [Laughter]
[1:23:40] we're out here we have this unnecessary
[1:23:43] jealousies against each other
[1:23:47] when your brother uh I or your sister
[1:23:50] buys a car
[1:23:54] instead of praising God for your brother
[1:23:56] buying a car
[1:23:59] when you are around people you say oh
[1:24:01] that card
[1:24:02] then when you go on the side
[1:24:07] I don't know if those cars cars like

[1:24:22] it when he was there
[1:24:24] yeah
[1:24:31] is that the car he's bragging about
[1:24:36] it
[1:24:40] now we have to be people who really love
[1:24:43] each other with the true love
[1:24:47] consider your brother in Christ
[1:24:56] more than your biological sisters
[1:25:04] as your own child
[1:25:14] I'm going to finish now
[1:25:20] good things don't last
[1:25:25] now listen to what brother brought him
[1:25:27] says
[1:25:29] says in Mark 16 I press on this after
[1:25:32] his death
[1:25:34] and his burial
[1:25:37] Resurrection
[1:25:41] Jesus was commissioning his church then
[1:25:45] he said
[1:25:47] go into all the world
[1:25:50] preach the gospel
[1:25:53] every creature
[1:26:00] shall be saved
[1:26:03] yes
[1:26:06] shall be damned
[1:26:10] and these signs
[1:26:24] they drink deadly drinks
[1:26:27] it won't hurt them
[1:26:42] when you go to places don't forget to
[1:26:45] bring honey
[1:27:01] but where is the part of God in this
[1:27:04] thing
[1:27:04] [Applause]
[1:27:07] if we always have to keep ourselves
[1:27:11] that means the God is not keeping us
[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:40] who will save you
[1:27:52] be careful like the serpent
[1:27:56] ERS
[1:27:57] if you see something
[1:28:00] or you know someone doesn't like it
[1:28:03] just try to keep your distance
[1:28:29] you can also feel it
[1:28:32] [Applause]
[1:28:46] doesn't stand me
[1:28:50] but it's the Lord who's protecting us
[1:28:58] he says
[1:29:06] the prophet of God says
[1:29:11] it was not uncertain
[1:29:14] foreign
[1:29:40] [Applause]
[1:29:44] and
[1:29:46] it cannot fail
[1:29:50] communion
[1:29:56] [Applause]
[1:30:04] [Applause]
[1:30:09] no no
[1:30:12] [Music]
[1:30:35] [Applause]
[1:30:53] [Applause]
[1:31:05] Jesus never said something like that
[1:31:09] now he said
[1:31:30] it won't harm them
[1:31:44] Jesus never said something exactly Jesus
[1:31:48] never said something else but what he
[1:31:51] said
[1:31:52] everything he said was certain and clear
[1:31:55] that's his word and it's true we met
[1:31:59] first yes
[1:32:01] so we believe that the word of God
[1:32:06] Christ gave us a commission
[1:32:09] he gave us
[1:32:13] to go to Every Nation
[1:32:17] and to make everyone his disciples
[1:32:21] through the way we do things but the
[1:32:24] church
