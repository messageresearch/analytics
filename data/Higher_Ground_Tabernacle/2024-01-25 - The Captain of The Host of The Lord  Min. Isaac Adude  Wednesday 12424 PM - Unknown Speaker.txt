hallelujah amen we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen we're so happy to be among those redeemed Amen to be Redeemed by Jesus Christ himself amen amen Let's uh go straight to the word and open our Bibles in the book of Exodus we read chapter 23 verse 20 to verse 22 Exodus 23 20 to 22 amen the Bible says that you ready Exodus 23 20- 22 the Bible said behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon for your transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thy enemies and an adversary unto thy adversar amen let's go to Joshua chapter 5 we read verse 13- 15 13 to 15 amen and here it's where I uh I took my title fromen the Bible here says that and he came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him are thou for us or for our adversaries amen and the verse 14 the Bible says that and he said nay but as the captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what sayith my Lord unto his servant verse 15 the Bible says and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy food for the place whereon thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so amen let's bow our heads father God lord we come to you tonight father Lord as humbly as we know how father Lord we just want to thank you Lord for Lord thank you for the weekend that we had Lord we thank you for everything that you have done for us Lord Lord we just pray father God that that same spirit continue to be with us we pray father Lord that you speak to us this evening father Lord I pray that you take me out of the way father Lord and you speak to your people father and help me oh God to be so sensitive to the holy that I can only say what you want me to Lord I pray father God that you bless the heart that we hear your word and let everything be done in your name Jes to you be the glory and honor Jesus Christ name we pray you may be seated amen this evening we have a little subject that we wanted to share with you that we entitled it the captain of the host amen the captain of the host of the Lord here in Exodus 23 the Bible says in verse 20 that behold I sent an angel before the see amen and that angel will have to that angel will keep you in the way and bring you to a place that the Lord has prepared for you and and then and then if you read the verse 22 the Bible says that but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that he speak then I the Lord will be an enemy unto en and the an adversary unto th amen so Joshua knew that word that Moses that God spoke to Moses amen he kept it in his heart amen every day every time he was walking amen every battles that he was fighting amen he always had that that that that word with him as long as I keep the word of God as long as I'm standing in the word of God angel of the Lord will always go before me and he will be the enemy of my enemies he will be the adversary of my so now here when he comes to Joshua chapter 5 the Bible says that Joshua saw a man who had his sword drawn Joshua himself being a warrior and then you coming you know to their I mean where they were and then you have your son in other words it's like a declaration of war I believe that Joshua did not go to that man with his SW kept behind when he went he also had his drawn because he knew that God will be the enemies of his enemies amen and he will be the adversaries of his so that's why he asked that man he asked him that are you for us because your faith will decide your faith will be decided on your end that's good for you but if you are against us amen I'm sorry I know that you will be defeated it doesn't matter how big you are will be defeated amen because God gave us a promise that his angel will go before us will fight our bottles he did the same thing with Pharaoh he delivered us he Departed the Red Sea all the Pharaoh's Army fell into the river because God was there before them and fighting all the promises that's what this is the thing that the the uh uh uh the other 10 spies fail to see when Moses asked them to go spy on the land amen Moses did not really ask them to go see you know how the odds were against am because the odds even though the odds were against him Moses knew that they will be victorious so the report of them being being like grasshoppers this is that that wasn't real that wasn't what Moses was expecting wasn't what Moses sent them to go mes sent them to go see if that promise that God gave if there be milk and honey flowing to tell them of the good of the land because they knew Moses knew that they will have that Landen but when they came back amen they saw all those big mens and amen they were all scared and Afraid amen they forgot that the angel of the Lord was always amen here here the prophet says it says that now listen closely now when the word test came when the word when the word test came when they went over and seen the opposition so great the greatest opposition they ever seen amen the the uh uh Amal was 10 times their size they said we look like grasshoppers their fences or their seties are wall till they can't uh uh they can't run a chariot around uh a chariot race around it man he says that two chariots man as hard as they can go as hard as they can go around the wall amen it says that he asked we say why their Spears are way out they're long and they're Giants we look like grass opers we can't do it amen and two men stood on that word and Joshua said wait a minute you two million people shut up just a minute we are more than we are more than able to do it see we are more than we are more than a much for amen what was there basing on God said I have given you the land amen it's yours amen it was the promise that God gave them and they knew that as long as they kept that promise as long as they were alive am as long as God was alive amen that promise will still be there amen and we serve an eternal God Amen and the guy who has no no Beginning No End amen so his promise is eternal if he says that he will give you the land amen that promise is good as done you don't have to think of how you don't have to think of how it's going to happen you don't need to think of even when it's going you just relax stand still and see the salvation of the Lord it doesn't matter how fast Pharaoh is coming you have the captain of the hor of the Lord the Bible called him the Unseen Captain amen you can't sometimes see him but he's there amen he was the pill of fire that was leading protecting them from all dead the Bible says that the prophet says amen that when Pharaoh was coming that that pill of fire that was their God Amen he moved from being before them went back behind them to become a shield become the The Protector amen he's the Unseen Captain he's the captain of the House of the and as long as you have him on your side you have to relax amen just follow him behind follow his footstep when Joshua met that met that man amen that man told him Joshua now relax amen I'm going to take the first seat right now just relax amen the B because the Bible says in Exodus 23:26 amen the Bible says that I will send my fear and will destroy all the people to whom thou sh come and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee I will send my fear before thee so you just relax amen and let God do his work you just relax and let the captain go before you when Joshua sent the spies to go to Jero amen the report of those spies when they came to Joshua they said I don't know why we afraid of this guy amen because they have heard the news of what the Lord has done for us amen they have heard how God departed amen they have heard of what God did with imagine Egypt was had the greatest army of time was the greatest power of that time but with the Lord amen he became nothing B news went to Jero Beyond those big walls big walls heard of that what why because God says that I will send my fear before the amen and I will destroy all the people to whom thou shall come and I will make thine enemies turn their backs onto thee amen so don't fear amen as long as you have the Unseen he said that he will fight your B don't fear amen stand still and see him see him working he asked Moses what do you have in your hand he wasn't looking for a great a great weapon mes wasn't looking for a powerful weapon Moses told him I said Mo said I only have the stick amen and God looked at him and said that that's that's what I was looking for with this stick amen I will make you a great conqueror what you have in your handen you don't need big gifts am you don't need a great voice you don't need great things just the little thing he gave you just be able to lay it like the rod of Aaron just lay it in the presence of the Lord he will bring fruit what you have in your hand amen say Lord this is what I have this little gift that you gave me Lord I don't even know how to use it amen that's not a problem amen you just forsake it to his head lay in the altar let God use it for you he's the Unseen Captain the prophet talked about the Redemption by power in that message he explained how God you know fights for us Amen in that
