[44:40] but as he which have called you is Holy
[44:45] so be holy in all manner of conversation
[44:48] amen
[44:49] amen because it is written be holy for I
[44:53] am Holy
[44:55] spirit is
[45:05] and if you call on the father who
[45:08] without respect a person judge according
[45:11] to Every Man's work
[45:12] past the time of your sojourning here in
[45:15] fear
[45:17] for as much as you know that you were
[45:19] not redeemed with corruptable things as
[45:22] silver and gold from your vain
[45:25] conversation received by Traditions from
[45:28] your fathers is
[45:47] but with the precious blood of Christ as
[45:51] of a lamb without blemish and without
[45:53] spots
[45:56] on dash
[46:00] uh Acts 2 actorship
[46:11] I'm beginning at the 36th verse
[46:16] therefore let all the house of Israel
[46:19] know assuredly
[46:21] that God had made that same Jesus whom
[46:23] you have crucified
[46:26] both the Lord and Christ
[46:28] is
[46:33] but when they heard this they were
[46:37] pricked in their heart and said unto
[46:39] Peter and to the rest of the Apostle men
[46:42] and Brethren and what shall we do
[46:45] is
[46:52] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[46:55] baptized every one of you in the name of
[46:58] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[47:00] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[47:03] Holy ghosts free
[47:12] for the promise is unto you and to your
[47:15] children and to all that are far off
[47:17] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[47:20] call foreign
[47:28] [Music]
[47:46] [Music]
[48:28] we have been ministering by the grace of
[48:31] God on
[48:33] Consecration and sincerity
[48:38] showing that that has been one of the
[48:42] great
[48:44] downfalls of most Christians
[48:48] because Christians fail to see uh what
[48:53] they have been called to
[48:55] Christians
[48:57] we have been called to a higher calling
[49:03] so much so
[49:05] uh the Bible said that God transforms us
[49:13] amen into the kingdom of God
[49:17] the Bible tells us that we should always
[49:22] let the mind of Christ through those
[49:25] [Music]
[49:28] we're not a denomination
[49:30] we're not an organization
[49:32] how of any kind do you know uh we are
[49:36] just simply Christians that God who has
[49:40] chosen
[49:41] uh before the foundation of the world
[49:44] to be Christians
[49:47] because to be a Christian this is really
[49:50] not by your choice
[49:52] people say I chose God
[49:55] but in reality that's not true
[49:59] God chose you
[50:01] and the Bible says
[50:04] according to what Jesus has said all
[50:07] that the father has given me
[50:10] will come and he said my sheep hearing
[50:15] my voice and a stranger they will not
[50:18] follow
[50:20] when you heard the call of this message
[50:24] it was a summons sitting on
[50:55] the Bible said that God is not willing
[50:59] that any should perish but that all
[51:03] would come to repentance
[51:06] on this morning I like to so
[51:10] preach a subject
[51:12] the beauty of Holiness
[51:16] when you talk about Holiness
[51:19] uh people get scared afraid uh because
[51:24] we realize how faulty we are
[51:28] we know that God Holiness
[51:32] really cannot be explained
[51:35] it's beyond our comprehension
[51:39] but God does give us a touch of it
[51:44] amen so much that we would be accepted
[51:47] by him
[51:49] when I was thinking this morning
[51:52] on my way to church
[51:55] the Holy Spirit spoke to me
[51:58] and he said to me this is your season of
[52:02] Revival
[52:06] throughout the message
[52:09] the time we have come
[52:12] uh so far
[52:16] but we forgot the main ingredients
[52:21] and that is Holy Ghost living
[52:25] I know what the world has done
[52:28] people have brought
[52:32] in reproach to the Holy Ghost
[52:35] but the Holy Ghost is the spirit of God
[52:39] they mock god with their powerless
[52:42] tongue speaking
[52:48] with no proper interpretation
[52:51] it has become a show it's an
[52:53] entrepreneur all of the Dynamics
[52:58] where is the life
[53:00] the Holy Ghost
[53:03] is the Life of Christ in you
[53:06] Hallelujah making the rejoicing of God
[53:10] oh is
[53:28] [Music]
[54:09] amen
[54:10] thank you Lord let it be Lord
[54:15] we have received a vision
[54:17] by Malachi 4 and
[54:21] 5.6 and the vision in which he gave us
[54:25] by way of the Holy Spirit
[54:29] was a vision of perfection Hallelujah
[54:34] and we are to
[54:36] achievement in a higher regards
[54:41] a Perfection
[54:43] greater than what Ephesus
[54:47] arrived to Blue going to sell the feza
[54:50] Ephesus had
[54:52] everything they had all the things they
[54:56] had a profit they had the Holy Spirit
[54:58] everything was working in Ephesus
[55:02] this is why the prophet of God said
[55:04] Ephesus parallel Joshua
[55:07] Hallelujah because it wasn't dropped in
[55:10] ephesus's lap
[55:12] Ephesians
[55:16] they had to press
[55:18] Amen in that position into that position
[55:23] Hallelujah wherein they are noted
[55:27] to be the mature Church
[55:31] Hallelujah the Christians I mean excuse
[55:34] me the Corinthians were Christians
[55:45] Hallelujah they compare it themselves
[55:48] Hallelujah everybody wanted to be
[55:50] something
[55:51] everybody want to speak in town
[55:54] I didn't want to prophesy Hallelujah
[55:57] they were not dead to themselves
[56:00] Hallelujah
[56:03] but Ephesus the Ephesians Church
[56:07] Ephesians was the church that Paul it is
[56:11] pretty much pastored
[56:13] because of who he was
[56:16] the reflection of his ministries
[56:21] we say we follow the teachings of
[56:25] William Brown
[56:30] we are no longer followers
[56:33] we don't want to be Pretenders
[56:43] performing the same duties and things
[56:49] because Jesus Christ
[56:53] yesterday today and forever he's a God
[56:57] that changes
[56:59] and we all ought to be tired
[57:03] the hypocrisy amen
[57:06] amen that we see
[57:08] within ourselves
[57:10] you thought I was going to say others
[57:12] didn't you know within ourselves
[57:16] Hallelujah the vision is to achieve his
[57:21] Holiness
[57:22] how are you going to get there
[57:28] needs to be as perfect as God is
[57:33] to declare his truth that he alone is
[57:37] God
[57:38] this is not Christian Science
[57:45] all people of God
[57:48] you got to understand this Bible is
[57:51] Right
[57:52] Hallelujah and in order to be called
[57:54] children of God you must be from the
[57:57] born of God
[57:58] hallelujah and you can't be born of God
[58:01] without your Holy Ghost
[58:05] amen I remember witnessing to somebody
[58:12] I got the Holy Spirit I said I got the
[58:16] Holy Spirit and she said she got the
[58:17] Holy Ghost and I'm like the scientist
[58:20] please am I dumb to something here
[58:22] people will denominate themselves
[58:28] and the other one said holy spirit
[58:31] there is no difference
[58:34] holy Hallelujah one say tomato yeah
[58:38] tomato and the others say tomato a lot
[58:41] of the tomato
[58:45] it's a tomato
[58:46] tomato
[58:51] strange
[58:53] you know it it bear witness that we're
[58:57] already different in so many ways
[59:05] listen first Peter
[59:08] 15 115 says
[59:15] let because it is written let's say 16th
[59:18] because it is written
[59:21] be holy
[59:23] for I am Holy
[59:25] hallelujah amen now we must understand
[59:28] I'm gonna say it really in a simple way
[59:31] there is no such thing as a holy man
[59:48] the holy God
