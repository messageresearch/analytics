[46:01] amen we're glad to have you here this
[46:04] morning you may be seated for just a
[46:08] [Music]
[46:10] minute we have had some weather in this
[46:12] place Haven
[46:14] we
[46:19] weather I just want to make a few
[46:21] announcement before I get into the word
[46:22] of the go of the Lord
[46:27] amen we appreciate everybody uh being
[46:30] here
[46:34] today but we want to just say something
[46:37] by the grace of
[46:38] God to the
[46:41] families and is dealing with controlling
[46:43] your
[46:49] children you know we know the message
[46:51] said that if you can't control your
[46:52] children you need to stay home until
[46:54] they're controlled
[47:02] please teach your children not to play
[47:04] in
[47:12] the please teach your children not to
[47:14] run in and out of the
[47:19] church
[47:21] amen uh because we we want God to visit
[47:24] this place
[47:27] we have a few brothers who have
[47:29] volunteered to help with the
[47:33] children them order out
[47:37] there but just but just remember they're
[47:40] not your
[47:44] nannies right
[47:47] hello unless you're going to pay them
[47:49] now if you pay
[47:51] them my point is they're not supposed to
[47:54] be taking care of your children
[47:57] while you just enjoying
[48:00] yourself here in the
[48:03] service keep that in
[48:07] mind uh it's not it's not so much as a
[48:10] rebuke it's more like an
[48:14] exaltation want you to keep in
[48:16] mind Where Your Children
[48:19] Are and you shouldn't know what they're
[48:24] doing and if you don't have them if
[48:26] they're not in control they need to be
[48:27] in
[48:30] here and if you can't control them in
[48:35] here you you've got some homework to
[48:38] do you love the
[48:41] Lord amen you appreciate the
[48:44] Lord we want to keep the vest as clean
[48:48] as
[48:51] possible no cluttering and all of
[48:55] that no l talking and gesturing and
[48:59] joking even myself I'm I'm correcting
[49:04] metime we because of winter we forget
[49:06] that that is still the part of the House
[49:11] of
[49:13] right and we shouldn't be slumbering in
[49:16] our seats while we're in the house of
[49:24] God and even crossing your leg legs is
[49:27] disrespectful to
[49:32] me so if you have a habit of crossing
[49:35] your
[49:37] legs for deliver at least in the house
[49:41] of
[49:43] am if we understand the unveiling of
[49:48] God we also understand that when
[49:50] preacher is
[49:52] preaching not the man but it's God
[49:55] anointing
[49:59] and the more respectful we
[50:02] become the more anointing we'll see in
[50:07] this so that's all I need to
[50:10] say so we thank God for you're
[50:14] listening now let us stand and we'll
[50:16] have a reading of the
[50:19] word coming from
[50:22] Hebrews the 11th
[50:24] chapter and we'll be reading the Third
[50:26] third
[50:36] verse and it
[50:38] goes through faith we understand that
[50:42] the world were
[50:43] framed by the word of
[50:46] God so that things which are seen were
[50:49] not
[50:52] made of of things which do appear
[51:03] amen
[51:06] amen praise the
[51:10] Lord I want you to read one more
[51:12] scripture with
[51:16] me Genesis
[51:19] 1 1
[51:20] [Music]
[51:22] 23 and then from there St John 1-4
[51:31] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[51:34] and the
[51:37] Earth thank you sir and the Earth was
[51:40] without form and void and darkness was
[51:44] upon the face of the
[51:47] [Music]
[51:48] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[51:52] the face of the waters
[51:57] and God said let there be light and
[52:00] there was
[52:04] light St John
[52:09] 1 beginning at the first
[52:14] verse in the beginning was the
[52:18] word and the Word
[52:21] was and the Word was was with
[52:24] God and the word was
[52:27] God the same was in the beginning with
[52:32] God all things were made by
[52:36] him and without him was not anything
[52:39] made that was
[52:42] made in him was
[52:46] life and the life was the light of
[52:51] men now let us
[52:54] pray Heavenly Father we thank you for
[52:56] your grace we thank you for your mercy
[53:00] we thank you for your love and all that
[53:03] you are doing for us even right now you
[53:08] have been so
[53:10] faithful and great is that
[53:13] faithfulness and we thank you for the
[53:15] mercy that you give unto us which is
[53:19] renewed every
[53:21] morning great is thy
[53:24] faithfulness father bless us this
[53:26] morning
[53:27] Hallelujah in a special way and we'll be
[53:31] careful to give you the praise Glory and
[53:34] Honor in Jesus Christ name we pray amen
[53:39] you may be
[53:44] seated on Wednesday we preached a
[53:47] message dealing with uh the same Glory
[53:57] and I said yes I said that I have been
[54:01] ordered and
[54:03] ordained to preach the
[54:07] message to the
[54:10] bride I trust everybody in
[54:15] here is the Bride of Jesus
[54:19] Christ and to be honest with you that's
[54:22] not my
[54:24] business who is and who is
[54:27] it I just know that God has spoken to my
[54:32] heart and I try and I pray that God will
[54:36] give me the grace of
[54:38] God uh to take it to the next
[54:44] level good to see you brother Isaac
[54:46] you've been on my
[54:50] heart amen amen we've been praying for
[54:54] you God is good to
[54:58] us while I'm thinking about that
[55:00] remember brother Josh the reason he's
[55:03] going through a great trial right
[55:06] now keep keep him in your
[55:10] prayers my subject this
[55:13] morning going Beyond this
[55:19] Dimension We Know by the grace of God
[55:22] that this is what we call the third
[55:24] dimension
[55:29] and and in this
[55:32] Dimension based on
[55:35] carnality Amen I believe before the
[55:40] fall we were linked to God in a
[55:43] different
[55:45] dimension
[55:47] remember the blood of Jesus
[55:50] Christ does not come just to save
[55:54] us uh but to position Al Place
[55:58] Us in that position where we we have
[56:01] fallen
[56:05] from this is why we needed a
[56:11] resurrection his death would have meant
[56:14] nothing if there had not been a
[56:20] resurrection because of the resurrection
[56:24] power God is able to transform
[56:27] us he's able to translate
[56:31] us is that right he's able to change
[56:36] us from this Mortal
[56:39] body into a body of
[56:46] immortality so when you get the Holy
[56:50] Ghost that is a down
[56:53] payment of your Resurrection
[56:58] gu see eternal life has no
[57:03] beginning and it has no
[57:06] ending and so therefore as a man or
[57:10] woman we would have never been able to
[57:14] obtain
[57:17] that it had to be a
[57:20] gift we couldn't buy
[57:24] it because of his
[57:28] value and if there's a man in this
[57:32] world who is a
[57:36] trillionaire he could never buy his
[57:42] salvation no one no
[57:45] money can purchase
[57:48] this I don't know about you but I want
[57:50] to dance right
[57:53] now the world that is to come
[57:58] will also be a world that's
[58:03] resurrected this world that we
[58:05] know had to go through
[58:08] justification
[58:10] sanctification and a fire
[58:13] baptism y'all understand me before Jesus
[58:17] could ever return in his
[58:21] physical this world had to
[58:24] change Hal hallelujah hallelujah and
[58:27] though the
[58:28] fires will burn the
[58:32] atmosphere and burn the demon power
[58:36] away Hallelujah there stands a
[58:41] dimension that will never be
[58:44] touched somebody help me by the fires
[58:48] that will
[58:49] destroy Heaven and
[58:52] Earth y understand what I'm saying
[58:57] resurrected in his eternal
[59:00] state where this world will never from
[59:03] that point
[59:05] on pass
[59:09] away after Jesus
[59:12] returned the world will
[59:15] never pass
[59:17] away and after Jesus returned to
[59:22] you you will never
[59:26] pass
[59:27] away hallelujah hallelujah see
[59:31] faith is From Another
[59:36] Dimension is that right because before
[59:39] the earth was
[59:41] formed Faith was
[59:44] there is that right it took
[59:49] Faith create everything that you
[59:54] see and this faith I'm talking about is
[59:58] not a
[59:59] thing it's a
[1:00:02] person we didn't know
[1:00:04] that we thought Faith was like this
[1:00:08] handkerchief something we could
[1:00:10] handle we talk about a natural Faith but
[1:00:14] the supernatural
[1:00:16] faith is God
[1:00:19] himself you say why would you say that
[1:00:22] because the Bible says that the just
[1:00:25] shall live by his
[1:00:30] Fai it is
[1:00:33] unseen but you know when you got
[1:00:36] it hallelujah hallelujah see the
[1:00:41] Unseen is more real than the
[1:00:44] seen is that right the prophet of God
[1:00:48] was in a a discussion with a
[1:00:51] man and he said I can't believe anything
[1:00:54] or nothing that I can't
[1:00:58] see because if I can't see it it's not
[1:01:03] real and the prophet of God
[1:01:05] said anything that cannot be S this is
[1:01:09] what the guy said anything that cannot
[1:01:11] be scientifically
[1:01:12] proven this is what the God says he said
[1:01:16] then I think there's nothing to
[1:01:19] it but brother Bram said I don't like to
[1:01:23] be different
[1:01:27] but I have to be
[1:01:29] now the things that can be
[1:01:32] scientifically
[1:01:34] proven is not
[1:01:37] real it's only the
[1:01:40] things that can scientifically excuse me
[1:01:44] it's only the things that's not
[1:01:46] scientifically proven is
[1:01:50] real in other words I don't care how
[1:01:54] deep
[1:01:57] get they cannot find the real
[1:02:02] thing finding the real thing doesn't
[1:02:04] come by
[1:02:08] science it comes by
[1:02:11] faith oh Lord help me now what it
[1:02:16] is we must learn how to
[1:02:20] focus on the Heavenly
[1:02:23] things because God said it
[1:02:27] we are now sitting in Heavenly
[1:02:30] places in Christ
[1:02:32] Jesus even the prophet of God says don't
[1:02:36] ask for the little
[1:02:37] things ask for the big
[1:02:40] things hallelujah hallelujah let's let's
[1:02:43] let's understand God is
[1:02:47] Big hallelujah hallelujah he's bigger
[1:02:49] than the
[1:02:51] universe Hallelujah he's bigger than
[1:02:53] anything you can see God is
[1:02:57] but though he be
[1:02:59] great he knows how to hide
[1:03:04] himself hallelujah hallelujah see we
[1:03:07] must understand we're no longer once
[1:03:09] you're born again you you're no longer
[1:03:13] of this
[1:03:14] world you in the world but you're not of
[1:03:17] the
[1:03:18] world and you got to elevate your
[1:03:22] thoughts Hallelujah you got to believe
[1:03:25] what the word says about
[1:03:27] you Hallelujah if you don't have the
[1:03:31] faith of like
[1:03:33] Enoch how you expect to have a
[1:03:37] translation Hallelujah Now understand
[1:03:41] the resurrection of Jesus
[1:03:44] Christ Pro to us that there is life
[1:03:48] after
[1:03:50] death hallelujah hallelujah I mean I
[1:03:52] don't care how many Sadducees stood
[1:03:55] there
[1:03:57] at Lazarus
[1:03:59] grave come on Lazarus has been dead 4
[1:04:04] days but when Jesus said I am the
[1:04:09] resurrection I am the life Hallelujah is
[1:04:13] that right if he said he was then he is
[1:04:19] now and when he called for
[1:04:22] Lazarus he wasn't looking in the Earthly
[1:04:25] way of looking at things
[1:04:28] Hallelujah he he married him said Lord
[1:04:32] they were still conal they were still
[1:04:34] natural Hallelujah and they said Lord in
[1:04:39] other words how could this thing be he's
[1:04:41] been dead four
[1:04:44] days he's thinking Lord but here
[1:04:48] Jesus was looking into another
[1:04:52] dimension Hallelujah he said don't
[1:04:55] Lazarus
[1:04:57] sleeping I'm going to wake him
[1:05:00] today in other words when you die in
[1:05:04] Jesus You're Not Dead you're still
[1:05:09] alive
[1:05:10] Hallelujah understand the Bride of Jesus
[1:05:13] Christ she cannot die Hallelujah is that
[1:05:18] the Bible the Bible said like this if
[1:05:22] you believe in me no you were dead
[1:05:27] yet shall you
[1:05:29] live hallelujah hallelujah oh come on
[1:05:33] somebody even under the
[1:05:36] law the law couldn't even hold
[1:05:40] Moses in the
[1:05:43] grave is that right because here was
[1:05:47] Jesus trying to teach his
[1:05:50] disciples what life is all about
[1:05:56] y understand me he took him up on Mount
[1:06:00] Transfiguration and up on Mount
[1:06:03] Transfiguration there stood Moses and
[1:06:06] Elijah and the prophet of God said Moses
[1:06:10] represented the the
[1:06:12] law he was the resurrected
[1:06:16] Saints Hallelujah but
[1:06:19] Elijah represented the translated
[1:06:22] Saint Hallelujah they both were there on
[1:06:27] the same
[1:06:28] Mountain come on somebody and then Peter
[1:06:33] said Lord who should we make a
[1:06:35] tabernacle
[1:06:37] to should we should we make one for
[1:06:41] Moses shall we make one for
[1:06:44] Elijah Hallelujah then that Jesus says
[1:06:49] No Moses and Elijah had to
[1:06:53] disappear let me tell you something like
[1:06:54] this Moses and Elijah had to
[1:06:58] disappear in order for them to see Jesus
[1:07:01] somebody help me here they fulfilled
[1:07:04] their Ministry but now Jesus Christ is
[1:07:07] on the scene is that the Bible the Bible
[1:07:11] tells us is that right even brother
[1:07:15] brandom said that the whole theme of the
[1:07:18] Bible is Jesus Christ Hallelujah it has
[1:07:22] to be Jesus there's no other name given
[1:07:25] them Heaven whereby a man must be saved
[1:07:30] but at the name of Jesus
[1:07:33] Christ we've got to look to the
[1:07:36] Unseen Abraham came looking at the
[1:07:39] Unseen he was able to
[1:07:42] not look at what the flesh dictated to
[1:07:46] him Hallelujah this is what we must
[1:07:50] understand if you're going to get
[1:07:52] victory in your life over any
[1:07:56] sickness you cannot look at the
[1:08:00] symptoms you must look at the
[1:08:03] promise hallelujah hallelujah the Bible
[1:08:06] said with his
[1:08:07] stripes we were healed not with going to
[1:08:11] be we
[1:08:13] are don't get me wrong when God is ready
[1:08:16] for you to go you can go but it doesn't
[1:08:19] mean you died not
[1:08:21] believing Hallelujah is that right oh
[1:08:25] come on on
[1:08:26] somebody the Bible

[1:11:01] things are
[1:11:02] possible hallelujah hallelujah yeah Lord

[1:11:11] frequency it never

[1:12:06] y'all get nervous when I bring it like
[1:12:08] this but let me tell you something it's
[1:12:10] something youve got to come
[1:12:13] through Hallelujah you know William Bram
[1:12:16] had to be saved
[1:12:19] himself y'all understand me he even was
[1:12:22] concerned about his mom salvation
[1:12:26] before she died is that right see is an
[1:12:29] individual
[1:12:31] thing it doesn't matter who your parents
[1:12:34] are You' got to know Jesus for
[1:12:38] yourself Hallelujah you've got to go
[1:12:41] beyond this
[1:12:43] Dimension because Flesh and
[1:12:46] Blood no Flesh and Blood we enter into
[1:12:50] the
[1:12:52] kingdom hallelujah hallelujah you love
[1:12:55] the Lord see we live in a world of
[1:12:59] unbelief everything's
[1:13:01] unbelief right you talk about God
[1:13:05] healing
[1:13:06] you and people are they going to think
[1:13:08] you're
[1:13:10] crazy with all this
[1:13:12] medicine with all these
[1:13:15] doctors you mean to tell me you'd rather
[1:13:18] for Jesus to heal
[1:13:20] you I must tell these doctors
[1:13:23] something your medication May Aid
[1:13:27] me but only Jesus can heal
[1:13:30] me y'all hear what I'm saying no no no
[1:13:34] medication can heal
[1:13:37] you only Jesus
[1:13:40] Christ Hallelujah can heal you glory to
[1:13:44] God if God want to use medication to
[1:13:47] help you in your faith that's
[1:13:50] fine Hallelujah there was some he spoke
[1:13:53] to
[1:13:55] and they were
[1:13:56] healed there was some he had to put mud
[1:13:58] and spittle in their
[1:14:00] ey to help them
[1:14:02] heal there were some who had to go dip
[1:14:05] in the
[1:14:07] waters God don't have to do
[1:14:09] that but he's working with your
[1:14:12] faith and understand God will go out his
[1:14:16] way to make you a
[1:14:20] Believer is that right even in the time
[1:14:23] that brother Brandon was here
[1:14:25] and people were receiving Their
[1:14:27] Blessings of
[1:14:31] healing he brother B would cry
[1:14:33] out sister don't do that it's right
[1:14:37] there you going to miss
[1:14:40] it you hear what I'm saying when God
[1:14:43] pronounce healing on you you must Focus
[1:14:47] you should never let your thoughts
[1:14:51] sway Hallelujah because if God said so
[1:14:55] that's what he
[1:14:56] meant but we have to wait you're going
[1:14:59] to be tried Hallelujah but I found out
[1:15:03] some
[1:15:04] things that even in the
[1:15:07] natural if you speak a
[1:15:10] word and really believe it and focus on
[1:15:14] it it will come to
[1:15:17] pass did you not know that I mean even
[1:15:21] in
[1:15:22] science they call it call it the quantum
[1:15:24] theory
[1:15:29] and all of these
[1:15:31] particles they're there even though you
[1:15:33] can't see
[1:15:36] them they thought at one time that the
[1:15:39] Adam was the biggest
[1:15:41] one then they broke it down to the
[1:15:43] photons and neutrons and now it's all
[1:15:47] the way down to what they call
[1:15:50] quarks Hallelujah but if you don't look
[1:15:53] at them
[1:15:55] random look like they're moving
[1:15:58] everywhere and this is why they say that
[1:16:01] there are multiple
[1:16:03] universes because once you focus on
[1:16:08] one it it stands at
[1:16:11] attention but you understand it's
[1:16:14] Everlasting if I got it correct but my
[1:16:18] point is
[1:16:19] this I know that there's one more like
[1:16:22] me
[1:16:25] living in another
[1:16:28] place come on
[1:16:30] somebody scientists they can come close
[1:16:32] to
[1:16:34] it but they don't know how and what it
[1:16:37] is come on somebody but we know
[1:16:41] everything's
[1:16:42] moving by the power of
[1:16:45] God and when God said let there be
[1:16:50] light that light vibrated
[1:16:53] [Laughter]
[1:16:56] Hallelujah you're sitting here by the
[1:17:00] vibration of the
[1:17:01] word hallelujah your body is
[1:17:05] whole by the vibration of the
[1:17:08] word hallelujah one thing I know is that
[1:17:12] God has his eyes on
[1:17:15] you and as long as God eye is on
[1:17:19] you you're going to do what he said do
[1:17:26] he's the allseeing
[1:17:28] eye he's
[1:17:30] omnipotent he's
[1:17:32] omnipresent hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:17:35] he's omip
[1:17:37] omnipotent
[1:17:39] omnicient om presentent and omnipotent
[1:17:43] y'all know what those mean see science
[1:17:46] they're seeing things that they cannot
[1:17:49] explain even
[1:17:52] Einstein Brother bam said it like that
[1:17:54] came so
[1:17:56] close to knowing god or seeing God he
[1:18:02] did
[1:18:03] conclude that there is a God y
[1:18:07] understand
[1:18:08] me and you know we've got all of these
[1:18:10] sintific
[1:18:11] sociological
[1:18:15] people in their intellect they
[1:18:19] say there is no
[1:18:23] God I'm going tell you something
[1:18:26] the birds are
[1:18:32] smarter because they call it
[1:18:36] Instinct but we call it
[1:18:39] God it's God who has set things in
[1:18:42] order that when it's time for the birds
[1:18:45] to travel back to the
[1:18:47] South raises up a
[1:18:51] leader oh y'all didn't hear it and so
[1:18:54] when it's time for
[1:18:55] us to make a
[1:18:58] journey God raised up a
[1:19:00] leader oh come on what what would this
[1:19:05] you understand me this is why the world
[1:19:08] is so
[1:19:09] confused because they refused the
[1:19:13] leader they rejected Malachi
[1:19:17] 4 they they had Jesus standing at the
[1:19:20] outside of the
[1:19:22] door when he came to leave
[1:19:25] them I don't know about you but I'm
[1:19:28] ready for my
[1:19:29] change
[1:19:31] Hallelujah yes sir one thing about
[1:19:34] Quantum is there have to be an input and
[1:19:37] an
[1:19:40] [Music]
[1:19:42] output but when you put something
[1:19:45] in it comes out even greater on the
[1:19:49] output y'all think God didn't know what
[1:19:52] he was
[1:19:53] doing he knew what he was
[1:19:56] doing because when Adam fell God knew
[1:20:00] what he wanted to
[1:20:02] produce hallelujah hallelujah that's why
[1:20:05] I read that
[1:20:07] scripture that that Jesus was the
[1:20:11] light or the life of
[1:20:14] men see Adam was supposed to be
[1:20:18] it but he fail see we need to know who
[1:20:22] the real
[1:20:23] life and the real
[1:20:25] light why would you say that because
[1:20:29] after Adam fell there were thousands of
[1:20:33] years they had that had
[1:20:37] passed where man in his
[1:20:40] Perfection was never seen
[1:20:44] again the perfect
[1:20:46] man came about by a virgin
[1:20:52] birth Hallelujah and that virgin birth
[1:20:55] came
[1:20:56] by an Angel speaking the
[1:21:00] word you shall have a
[1:21:03] son and you going to call his name
[1:21:06] Jesus she she she might have had another
[1:21:09] thought that she might want to call him
[1:21:10] something
[1:21:11] else but see there's power in the name
[1:21:14] of
[1:21:15] Jesus maybe I'm maybe I'm I'm see that's
[1:21:19] why the devil don't care if you say God
[1:21:22] he don't care if you say Lord
[1:21:25] there's many lords there's many gods
[1:21:28] Hallelujah but he does not like the name
[1:21:31] of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah huj
[1:21:35] because when you say that with
[1:21:39] Revelation he knows he's got to Bow
[1:21:43] Hallelujah he's got to Humble himself to
[1:21:46] the name of Jesus
[1:21:48] Christ hallelujah hallelujah and the
[1:21:50] Bible said that the whole family of
[1:21:54] Heaven and Earth is named after him oh
[1:21:59] come on come on somebody when you when
[1:22:04] you get the true Holy
[1:22:07] Spirit your name
[1:22:12] changes your character
[1:22:15] changes hallelujah hallelujah right so
[1:22:19] you got to understand what God is
[1:22:21] doing let me show you how God
[1:22:25] how he works
[1:22:27] math a woman gave two
[1:22:31] mites in
[1:22:35] church two
[1:22:37] coins to Jesus in
[1:22:41] service and Jesus rung it
[1:22:47] up and gave her eternal life
[1:22:56] hallelujah hallelujah see it's just
[1:22:58] little things you
[1:22:59] [Music]
[1:23:00] think that doesn't
[1:23:03] matter but it
[1:23:06] matters he even said if somebody gives
[1:23:09] you a drink of
[1:23:12] water in the name of
[1:23:15] Jesus Hallelujah they can receive
[1:23:18] eternal
[1:23:20] life oh my people come on now
[1:23:24] we must
[1:23:27] understand that when we talk
[1:23:32] about Dimensions Beyond
[1:23:36] ours we must understand that our
[1:23:39] prayer penetrates those
[1:23:43] Dimensions is that is that that right
[1:23:47] God told
[1:23:48] Daniel I heard your prayers 21 days ago
[1:23:55] is that right he was an
[1:23:58] angel fighting on the behalf of
[1:24:02] Daniel what what about you Daniel is a
[1:24:07] servant you are Sons and Daughters of
[1:24:10] God hallelujah hallelujah but you got to
[1:24:14] understand when you praying you're
[1:24:17] changing your
[1:24:20] atmosphere when you are praying you're
[1:24:23] moving from this four
[1:24:25] dimension to the dimension right there
[1:24:28] where God
[1:24:30] is am this is prayer in just saying
[1:24:34] words prayer sincere
[1:24:37] prayer though you be here will translate
[1:24:41] you into a Heavenly
[1:24:43] places Hallelujah you must understand oh
[1:24:47] you don't believe
[1:24:49] this they say you can leap they call it
[1:24:52] a Quantum Leap
[1:24:56] if you're feeling
[1:24:58] sad you actually carrying that
[1:25:01] atmosphere with
[1:25:03] you and your sadness is going to affect
[1:25:05] somebody
[1:25:07] else hallelujah hallelujah but there's a
[1:25:10] Quantum Leap they say they call it
[1:25:12] that's what they call it if you start
[1:25:14] talking
[1:25:17] positive you can actually come and
[1:25:19] change that
[1:25:20] atmosphere now what did Brother brandham
[1:25:23] say said we are little
[1:25:27] creators hallelujah hallelujah and all
[1:25:29] we got to do is speak the
[1:25:31] difference come on somebody just like
[1:25:34] our brother said the other
[1:25:36] week if you're sick sometimes all you
[1:25:40] need is a good
[1:25:43] hallelujah oh sometimes all you need is
[1:25:46] a worshiping service and the devil will
[1:25:49] leave you
[1:25:52] alone hallelujah hallelujah but as long
[1:25:54] as we carry that negative
[1:25:58] atmosphere Hallelujah you
[1:26:01] literally pulling up
[1:26:05] demons to make you even
[1:26:09] sadder what but when you begin to praise
[1:26:14] God because God inhabits the praise of
[1:26:17] his
[1:26:18] people when you begin to praise God
[1:26:21] it'll take you into Heavenly places
[1:26:25] oh come on I think it was
[1:26:28] Jehosaphat when God told
[1:26:30] Jehosaphat you know you're not going to
[1:26:33] fight this
[1:26:34] battle I'm going to fight the battle but
[1:26:37] I want you to put all the instruments in
[1:26:39] front I want you to put the musicians I
[1:26:42] want you to put the choir I want you to
[1:26:44] put all this joyful sound in the
[1:26:50] front even the devil knows it's working
[1:26:55] Hallelujah you get a basketball
[1:26:59] team on one
[1:27:02] Accord their team could be
[1:27:05] behind Hallelujah but if that that that
[1:27:10] group of people that believes in that
[1:27:14] team if they rally together and began to
[1:27:18] shout and jump and
[1:27:20] praise that team turns around
[1:27:24] why because even though they're Fallen
[1:27:27] they're still Fallen sons of God and
[1:27:30] they have the ability according to the
[1:27:33] Clon Theory to leave to change order to
[1:27:38] change things you say it doesn't work it
[1:27:41] does work it was
[1:27:45] Saul demon
[1:27:48] possessed but he called David to change
[1:27:51] the atmosphere
[1:27:54] insane man Hallelujah was now had a
[1:28:01] menro who was able to change the
[1:28:03] atmosphere you can change your
[1:28:06] atmosphere you don't have to be sad you
[1:28:09] don't have to be lonely you can change
[1:28:12] your
[1:28:15] [Applause]
[1:28:17] atmosphere hallelujah hallelujah if you
[1:28:20] say your world is falling apart your
[1:28:22] world is falling apart
[1:28:24] Hallelujah because what comes out of
[1:28:26] your mouth is what what either God
[1:28:30] reacts to or the devil reacts
[1:28:36] to Hallelujah Hallelujah you love the
[1:28:39] Lord yes sir you got to re you got to
[1:28:43] understand who you
[1:28:46] are now as long as you lineing up with
[1:28:48] God you don't have to worry about
[1:28:50] failing but if you're doing all you know
[1:28:52] right to do God will come
[1:28:56] through Hallelujah if there's sin in the
[1:28:58] camp he can't move you got his hands
[1:29:02] tied Hallelujah you can be a prophet and
[1:29:06] God won't
[1:29:08] move Hallelujah brother Ram told that
[1:29:11] lie a baby need to be prayed
[1:29:14] for nothing was going to happen until he
[1:29:18] confessed and made that prayer made that
[1:29:20] thing right once he made right he was
[1:29:23] able to pray for the baby and the baby
[1:29:25] was right you understand me same with
[1:29:29] you
[1:29:30] Hallelujah am I right or wrong glory to
[1:29:34] God you can't you can't live a sinful
[1:29:36] life and expect God to just bless
[1:29:39] you now he going to bless anyway cuz he
[1:29:42] reigns on the just and the unjust
[1:29:44] Hallelujah but I want to be just I want
[1:29:48] to be justified under his blood I want
[1:29:50] to be in the right place I want to
[1:29:52] receive the right blood blessings from
[1:29:55] him
[1:29:56] hallelujah what shall separate me who
[1:30:00] shall separate me from the love of God
[1:30:04] nothing can separate
[1:30:06] you hallelujah hallelujah why why why
[1:30:10] because his eyes are on
[1:30:12] you Hallelujah and as long as his eyes
[1:30:15] is on you you will do exactly what he
[1:30:19] said
[1:30:21] there Hallelujah
[1:30:24] God
[1:30:25] focuses you don't think his eyes on
[1:30:28] you he said Phillip I saw

[1:36:00] called me I didn't look for it it look
[1:36:04] for me it looked for you it called you
[1:36:09] Hallelujah and Jesus said If any man
[1:36:12] come unto me I will in no wise cast him
[1:36:15] out Hallelujah glory to God I don't have
[1:36:18] to worry about being cast

[1:36:27] way to save
[1:36:29] you is that the
[1:36:32] truth here the resurrection is
[1:36:34] on think about perhaps when it's when
[1:36:38] it's on again when it comes on again
[1:36:41] maybe there'll be some doubters like
[1:36:45] Thomas God didn't have to come to
[1:36:48] Thomas but his eyes was on
[1:36:51] Thomas you understand me God saw Thomas
[1:36:55] before he
[1:36:57] doubted hallelujah hallelujah and he
[1:37:00] comes through the
[1:37:01] door didn't even bother to knock he
[1:37:05] comes through the
[1:37:06] wall right
[1:37:09] Thomas I need to help you
[1:37:11] here ye have little faith yes I need to
[1:37:15] push it up some sometimes God will let
[1:37:18] you go will take you he come you all out
[1:37:22] the way
[1:37:24] and God will come knocking on your
[1:37:26] door just to wake you up just so that
[1:37:29] you can see I love you still you're
[1:37:32] doubting me Thomas but see there's a
[1:37:35] seed in
[1:37:36] you I cannot
[1:37:39] ignore Hallelujah and the Bible say the
[1:37:44] Lord knoweth them that are here if we
[1:37:47] had judged if we had judged Thomas if we
[1:37:51] had looked at
[1:37:52] Thomas like oh man what you talking
[1:37:55] about you don't believe us we're telling
[1:37:58] you the truth what kind of believer you
[1:38:01] are hallelujah hallelujah that's not
[1:38:04] what Jesus did Jesus
[1:38:07] compassion Jesus love Jesus Mercy caus
[1:38:12] him to walk through that door address
[1:38:18] Thomas Hallelujah and if I got it right
[1:38:21] I think Thomas was the one that was
[1:38:22] killed in the
[1:38:24] right because of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:38:26] Christ Hallelujah see once you know like
[1:38:30] Thomas came to
[1:38:32] know my
[1:38:35] Lord my God Hallelujah huj from that
[1:38:39] point on Thomas developed a new vision
[1:38:43] he was no longer looking in the caral he
[1:38:46] looked beyond the caral you are
[1:38:49] Abraham's seed you are ordained to look
[1:38:52] beyond the
[1:38:55] Hallelujah you are ordained to call
[1:38:58] those things that be
[1:39:00] not as though they
[1:39:03] were hallelujah hallelujah so you can
[1:39:06] understand Hallelujah Proverbs 23
[1:39:09] and7 I'm just going to read the first
[1:39:12] part for as he thinketh in his
[1:39:16] heart so is
[1:39:19] he if you're thinking in your heart is
[1:39:21] you're a loser
[1:39:24] that that's what you
[1:39:27] are oh Lord I I'm just a
[1:39:30] failure that's what you
[1:39:33] are I used to say this all the time I'm
[1:39:35] a man of many
[1:39:37] faults and God said stop
[1:39:40] that stop speaking
[1:39:43] that because if you speak that that's
[1:39:46] what you will
[1:39:48] become you understand me science is
[1:39:51] going to make sure you become that
[1:39:57] is that the truth it is a scientific
[1:40:00] fact if I had a flower rose
[1:40:04] bush and I would go to that rose
[1:40:06] bush and I would curse that rose
[1:40:09] bush that rose bush will eventually
[1:40:13] die but if I go to that rose bush and
[1:40:17] begin to praise it and bless it it will
[1:40:21] live
[1:40:24] you say that ain't true Jesus Jesus
[1:40:27] proved it
[1:40:28] was he said to the Fig Tree you going to
[1:40:32] die this is your day to die did it die
[1:40:36] even from the root he was a Son of God
[1:40:40] let me ask you who are you what are you
[1:40:44] if you listen I know this to be true you
[1:40:46] can take crazy all you want but my tree
[1:40:49] in front of my
[1:40:52] yard it was planted out of
[1:40:56] season it was
[1:40:58] dying and the Holy Spirit said go pray
[1:41:00] and pray and bless that
[1:41:03] tree now God is my witness I went
[1:41:07] outside in the cold and I blessed that
[1:41:11] tree in the cold that tree bloom
[1:41:16] twice and now that tree is healthier
[1:41:19] than the other tree bigger than the
[1:41:22] other tree taller than the other tree
[1:41:25] that was there
[1:41:30] already and if God have respect for a
[1:41:34] tree what about your
[1:41:37] children Hallelujah when you say oh
[1:41:40] you're just so bad stop cursing your
[1:41:45] children you don't have bad
[1:41:51] children and if you keep cursing them
[1:41:53] you stupid what are you
[1:41:57] saying Abraham's
[1:42:00] word blessed and
[1:42:03] curse what about your
[1:42:12] words there are times I would pray and
[1:42:14] call some of y'all
[1:42:17] Rebels you'll never
[1:42:21] know but God says stop
[1:42:24] that they're
[1:42:27] not see we don't know who you
[1:42:30] are and we don't know your time of
[1:42:33] change but I believe that all of us have
[1:42:36] that time to
[1:42:38] change and if God stop me I know you
[1:42:41] will
[1:42:44] change somebody help me here come on now
[1:42:47] come on y'all think y'all getting see
[1:42:50] God got his eyes on you fix hey he sees
[1:42:54] everything we do he hears our thoughts a
[1:42:58] far
[1:43:00] off hallelujah
[1:43:02] hallelujah than you
[1:43:04] lord it's the truth so I don't do that
[1:43:07] no more cuz I don't know who's bride and
[1:43:10] who's
[1:43:11] not but I hope everybody in here
[1:43:14] is hallelujah listen I want you to
[1:43:17] understand something when you come to
[1:43:19] the Lord Jesus Christ you must recognize
[1:43:23] that there is no
[1:43:26] sin sin is
[1:43:29] unbelief saints of God we have
[1:43:32] faults there's a difference because of
[1:43:34] this
[1:43:36] flesh yes sir y understand me but B said
[1:43:41] we all have sinned and come short of the
[1:43:43] glory of God because there was a time we
[1:43:46] were
[1:43:48] Sinners but now God has elevated
[1:43:51] us you can't be a sinner a saint at the
[1:43:53] same
[1:43:55] time Hallelujah but look what Psalm says
[1:43:58] Psalms 103
[1:44:00] and2 as far as the East is from the
[1:44:05] West so far ha he removed our
[1:44:08] transgressions from
[1:44:13] us is that all right you know the
[1:44:16] problem is we judge our we judge each
[1:44:18] others before we judge
[1:44:20] ourselves and the Bible never say judge
[1:44:22] your brother
[1:44:25] the Bible said judge ye yourself see
[1:44:28] whether you be in the
[1:44:31] faith is this okay y'all getting quiet
[1:44:34] I'm almost done yo yo yo Yoo yo yo y
[1:44:37] your time is almost up I got five more
[1:44:43] minutes St John
[1:44:47] 14 beginning at the first verse
[1:44:53] the problem is we letting the devil
[1:44:55] bring us into this negative
[1:44:59] attitude he's destroying he's destroying
[1:45:02] you because you got to understand and
[1:45:06] he's he's
[1:45:09] strategic this is a
[1:45:11] battle and I don't want to get into
[1:45:13] right like that because I got to teach
[1:45:16] today in the
[1:45:19] people but what do you think the devil
[1:45:22] is doing
[1:45:24] he see what you're capable of
[1:45:28] doing so he put everything in your
[1:45:33] way to stop you from doing
[1:45:39] it you understand me he can hinder
[1:45:43] you he just can't stop
[1:45:48] you you understand
[1:45:51] me and and he uses your
[1:45:54] flesh to engage
[1:45:58] you and I'm just going to drop this we
[1:46:00] make mistakes in our
[1:46:03] flesh it Grieves
[1:46:06] us and so the devil say see you ain't no
[1:46:09] good you ain't nothing but a
[1:46:12] hypocrite huh because he see a gift in
[1:46:16] you he sees the purpose that God for you
[1:46:19] has for you that's nothing but the truth
[1:46:22] is that right I mean come on come on we
[1:46:25] let's I'm just going to I'm tapping into
[1:46:27] my next message let's tap David let's
[1:46:30] get David on
[1:46:31] the anointed by
[1:46:37] Samuel with a whole Horn of
[1:46:40] oil that ran from his head all the way
[1:46:43] down to his
[1:46:45] feet but David had an
[1:46:48] enemy it wasn't the devil it was his
[1:46:51] flesh
[1:46:53] that's right your enemy is your
[1:46:57] flesh and the more spiritual you
[1:47:00] are the more the devil is going to ride
[1:47:04] you that's the truth if you're
[1:47:07] gifted Satan gonna fight

[1:47:16] you hallelujah oh come on somebody if
[1:47:20] you don't believe me take out check out

[1:47:32] be your
[1:47:35] buddy that's one of Satan's
[1:47:38] strategies his greatest strategy is
[1:47:43] lost anyway I'm G leave that alone but

[1:47:50] holy anybody holier than brother brother
[1:47:53] Bram y know what I'm trying to say he
[1:47:56] had to put a cross up
[1:48:03] front the more spiritual you

[1:48:08] side the more negativity you're going to
[1:48:11] get on the left
[1:48:14] side people don't even understand
[1:48:18] you that sister
[1:48:21] canane she's all the
[1:48:23] spirit but when she come out of that
[1:48:26] Spirit of the

[1:49:14] yay to
[1:49:16] you no matter what Satan tries to do you
[1:49:20] know I think about Peter how Peter
[1:49:22] denied Jesus
[1:49:25] and Judah Judas one
[1:49:27] time and Peter never lost his
[1:49:31] position Judas had was hung
[1:49:34] himself and Peter was on the day of
[1:49:37] Pentecost preaching the
[1:49:39] message see when you a seat of God you I
[1:49:43] hate to say it like this but I'm going
[1:49:44] say there special
[1:49:47] privileges comes with the being
[1:49:55] you understand
[1:49:56] me in my father's house are many
[1:49:59] mansions if it were not so I would have
[1:50:02] told you I'd go to prepare a place for
[1:50:05] you you better accept that this is
[1:50:09] personal I don't know how it's going to
[1:50:11] look but part of it if not all of it
[1:50:15] will be something I will enjoy
[1:50:18] no right it will be something I will
[1:50:20] enjoy
[1:50:23] you know if even even there if I just
[1:50:25] got a little
[1:50:27] corner I'll be
[1:50:29] happy you know why cuz there I'll never
[1:50:33] get
[1:50:34] tired nothing will ever be
[1:50:38] boring we can't even imagine
[1:50:40] it he said if I go and prepare a place
[1:50:43] for you I will come again and receive
[1:50:47] you unto
[1:50:48] myself that where I am there you may be
[1:50:55] y listen I hear I I feel this let me
[1:50:57] tell y something Peter had a bad
[1:51:03] temper he had one of those temples to
[1:51:05] fight to
[1:51:10] kill and God changed
[1:51:15] him he didn't change himself that's why
[1:51:18] he could write there and add to your
[1:51:20] faith virtue knowledge all that
[1:51:23] if anybody knew about transformation
[1:51:25] Peter knew about
[1:51:28] it don't you worry he that begun that
[1:51:31] work in you you got to have
[1:51:34] faith he's faithful to complete it I I I

[1:52:19] which way to go I am the way should I go
[1:52:22] that way I am the
[1:52:24] way Lord what about what this professor

[1:52:29] truth I don't care what they teach in

[1:52:36] truth and he says I am the
[1:52:39] life no man cometh unto the
[1:52:42] father but by me

[2:05:10] the the adults class for the for the
[2:05:12] younger
[2:05:14] class that's led by Sister
[2:05:18] Divine and so today they learned about
[2:05:20] obeying God
[2:05:25] the story of Adam and
[2:05:28] Eve and 10 kids showed up

[2:06:03] the ones that showed up
[2:06:06] today and um most kids forgot their
[2:06:14] homework and only two kids did uh two
[2:06:17] kids did not forget to do their
[2:06:20] homework and most of the kids did not
[2:06:22] learn the song uh the song Always obey
[2:06:28] God always obey
[2:06:31] God the song is called always always

[2:06:42] song at home and most of them did not
[2:06:43] learn
