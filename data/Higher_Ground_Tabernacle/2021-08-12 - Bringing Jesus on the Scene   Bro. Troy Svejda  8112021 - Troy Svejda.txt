your home fails when you're when your job fails you when anything fails you there is a place that you can go to amen to call god upon the scene and and when you're crying oh lord cleft of the rock place for me lord just let me hide myself right there lord let me hide myself in thee you know we're we we are part of a pyramid saints amen there is a there is a pyramid that does exist amen you see it right there on the drawing there this little pyramid but that pyramid was put upon a cross amen is that those characteristics of god were came to the earth the god's perfect character came to the earth was crucified amen but when god's perfect rock amen the rock that followed them in the wilderness and as as the bible says and that rock was christ amen when that rock came to this world that rock was crucified amen when that rock was crucified there came this spear that came and put a cleft in the rock amen and now that cleft of the rock blood and water even as the verse said there blood and water flowed out amen be of sin the double cure amen but there is a people that there is something that just burns within their heart that they they cry out for that cleft because that's where they came from amen take me back lord where i came from lord i came from your wound upon your side lord i came from that that wound that was put on your side when you when that soldier put the spear in your sight upon the cross i came out i was born right there at that moment of that hour i came into my birth amen so let me go back to that place amen let me go back to him amen amen i just want to preach a message this morning or this evening called bringing jesus on the scene amen i know that we all have a need of that amen amen to bring jesus on the scene amen so let's just uh let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer before we get into the word of the lord heavenly father this message tonight lord is yours lord not mine lord and uh as all of us lord not knowing what each one has been through throughout the week lord we've all have our own struggles and trials lord but yet here in the midst of the week lord we've dedicated this little space of time father to come into your presence lord and face to face with you lord we just pray father that right now in the name of jesus christ lord we ask you lord to come upon the scene father lord to heal to deliver to the refreshed lord to to to do to to heal the father your bride lord lord to show upon the scene lord those that are weary lord might rise up on the wings of an eagle lord and be restored lord lord let it be father unto your bride lord as she listens to your word i pray tonight let it be unto her the you might be the prince of peace in all the situations in front of us lord and we just thank you lord for all things we dedicate our lives our souls lord even this entire service to you have thine own way in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you saints let's uh let's open in our bibles to mark chapter 11. mark chapter 11 we'll read the first verse and then we'll go over to the seventh verse now verse one here's a kind of familiar story we'll skip over most of it and go down to the read the first verse and then go on down to the seventh but this is where jesus is sending his disciples away to go get him that go find that cult and to bring him to him amen so he could ride in jerusalem on that cold of a donkey amen so verse one and it says there and when they came nigh into jerusalem onto bethphage and bethany and at the mount of olives he senteth forth two of his disciples amen you know the story what he told them to do amen he told him to go right into the city find that donkey it's been prepared before the foundation of the world amen and bring it to him amen now let's uh let's go on down to uh verse seven uh and it says and they brought the cult to jesus and cast their garments on him and he set upon him now every verse here is he's fulfilling scriptures amen amen scriptures are being fulfilled before their eyes and many spread forth their garments in the way and others they cut down branches off the trees and they strew them in the way and they went before and they follow crying saying hosanna hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord blessed be the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest what an entrance amen what an entrance you know it's good when you can be in a place where the words being praised amen amen and so and right there right there in verse 11 it says and jesus entered into jerusalem i said he's been waiting for that moment amen jesus entered into jerusalem and into the temple and when he had looked around about upon all things now he the evening time was coming he went out unto bethany with the 12. amen we'll just stop right there maybe let's just bow our heads and word of prayer heavenly father we just want to thank you lord for this day this hour this message lord that you've given unto us father lord we pray lord that in the name of jesus christ have thine own way lord speak the word tonight lord in a way lord that only you can do it father for lord i can maybe preach a few words from your bible lord but no one would recognize that father because we only recognize lord when you open the book to us so that that be in everyone's hearts tonight we pray in the name of jesus christ amen you can be seated amen this experience where jesus was entering into jerusalem was an experience they've been prophesied that was to happen ever since ever since uh adam and eve had lost the access to the garden of eden this moment has been in the wings waiting where jesus would have an opportunity to enter in the lord being praised having communion with the saints amen gathered together in one city but as he walks in he he goes into the city and being worshipped and being praised fulfilling prophecies amen he walks into that temple that was dedicated you know and dedicated to the name of jehovah and he walks into the temple and he says he looks around at all things he went through and he inspected the temple he looks around at all things and then as he go after he inspects all things he walks back out and goes all the way back to bethany and that's where he sleeps that night you know i i i don't know if any of you remember i preached a message quite a while back called making room for the word coming from the time when elijah was traveling to and fro about the service of the lord and that rich woman she she saw that he was constantly passing by her house and and she's she told her husband i perceive that that's a holy man of god that is going by her house all the time and she told her husband she says let's make a little room for this man let's make a little room on the side of our house so that when he's going by and he's weary on the journey that he might he might stop because he had been coming by and he would eat supper with him but then he would just take off again so he could get to where he could spend the night and they were and they thought that maybe if they prepared a place for him that he could stay a little bit longer amen as they they she talked to her husband he says yeah we can do that and they they dug down into their bank accounts they dug down into their resources they dug down into all that they had their laborers and all that and they they built a little room on the side of their house to make room for the word of god to make room for the holy one to make room for the one god's chosen amen as they made a little room for them they put a little bed and a table in there and a chair and this little lamp stand there and the next time the prophet came to eat with them that they are fellowshipping over the word and he began to get tired and he thought i must be getting on there you get to a certain place with my nightfall and they said why don't you just wait a little while why don't you just we got a little room prepared for you you don't have to be hasty you don't have to go any further you can stay right here and be at rest you know and when you read the story a little bit further you find out that those people were blessed by that amen they made room for the word of god in their lives as they made room for the word of god that the the prophet is the one that the word comes to as they made room for the prophet as the prophet was laying there in the bed that they had made for him then as he was laying there all of a sudden a vision came to him he called his servant he said go get that woman and he called her and said woman what do you need and she says we don't need anything we're we have plenty to eat nice house we have needed nothing we're well satisfied jehovah has provided amen and all of a sudden elijah's servant says but sir they don't have a child they don't have a son they've been crying out for a child and they've been waiting for the time that god would heal them and the prophet looked at the woman and found out that that was so and as the word was resting there as when the it was when the word began to be at rest now he had aten in that house many times now he had had many fine meals there he had many fine worship services but it wasn't until he actually made himself at home there it wasn't until the word is actually at resting there yo you can you can come to church a long time before you see the word of god acting in your life you can come to many fine worship services you can come to this place and raise your hands and praise god all you want you can break down the palm branches and wave them you can you can get the cult ready hey man you can put the blanket over the colt you can lead jesus into jerusalem you can worship him but when he gets into the temple and he looks around at all things like mark said says that when jesus he went into the temple after being worshipped after being praised after being they said glory hosanna to the highest god is entering into a city the holy one is entering into his city the messiah the king of kings the lord of lords is coming back to jerusalem the anointed one of the messiah is entering into jerusalem praise his holy name amen but when the holy one came into his temple and he begins to look around something about it just didn't make him feel very welcome there now in solomon's day when that holy one entered into the temple oh the cloud came down the fire came upon the altar the those the the singers couldn't sing anymore the instruments couldn't play anymore the the worshipers couldn't worship anymore oh they were stunned they were in awe at the mighty god that came down like this cloud that came and filled the room and all of a sudden god himself was in his temple amen what a revival we have seen jehovah this day jehovah has come and made his abode with us amen has set forth a generation of peace a generation of riches a generation of wealth a generation of a people that are living at ease worshiping their god amen as the time of solomon the son of david was on the throne and it was a time of peace but here comes the true son of david the true solomon the one that that was prophesying of but when he comes into the temple he isn't it just didn't have the same effect he didn't they they might have given him lip service but then a few other days after that they're ready to crucify him amen amen after all the worship and all the praise and all that thing he just you know i'm just not welcome here you know jesus won't stick around very long if he's not welcome amen anywhere his where his word is not welcome he's not welcome amen and when you allow things contrary to the word to continue in your life god's not welcome there amen we've got to be in a place where god is welcome in our life and if you're ever once going to call yourself god upon the scene amen you got to have a place where god is welcome you're not just paying lip service to him on a sunday or wednesday but you got to have a place in your life where he hasn't just come to dinner every once in a while hey maybe where the word has come to stay amen place has been prepared in your heart this is where the word is going to live this is where he's going to move and live and have his being amen rock of ages place for me lord let me hide myself in thee oh cleft of the rock place for me why was that cleft there why was that cleft there we weren't there anymore amen a bride had been taken out of his side and it left a little a little cleft there he said thomas thomas why are you doubting take your hand push it into my side why was that cliff there because there was a bride they've been taken out and mother shall leave her father or the daughter shall to leave her father and mother amen and there was to be separated amen but then they'll be joined right back together and so as we were crying out rock of ages cleft for me lord let me hide myself in thee you're making room for that word making room for that place a place where to where god is worshipped a place where god can be comforted a place where god can can be a rest as jesus said the the foxes of the earth they have dens amen the birds have nests amen but the son of man has no place to lay his head well i pray he has one now amen is he i pray that he has one now he went all over the place and and he he he he he never had anything that he actually owned that's right even though he never had a place there's no home that you can go to and say this is jesus's house left you're a poor man amen maybe a garment that someone had given him amen even that was taken from him amen but he owned something that he had to borrow a tune to be buried in they say amen but he owned it all the meek shall inherit the earth and you don't get any meeker than that that's right amen but he's left his father and came to this earth amen that's what the prophet saying when he said they'll leave their father and mother amen they're clean that's why that's why they had to look like that separation he left the father behind right amen to look like a separation that's where that trinity doctrine came in they didn't understand the separation but it's prophesying of a bride of christ there's prophesying of the day of bride will be revealed amen amen when there is no room the word just passes on but there's a chance that there's an opportunity for that word to remain amen if you can call jesus amen amen one of uh brother brahms messages that i i you know there's so many that i enjoy but there's one that i've just listened to over and over and over again and it's all the ones that are titled blind bartimates i don't know what it is about that mess those messages but i just i've always appreciated those amen i know i think it was last year or the year before sometime i went through and then in one chain i just listened to all 10 of them or however many it is all in a row hey man because i just wanted to grasp that story amen of a blind man that was begging amen that he he had no hope everything really had been taken from him here he is as a son of abraham living in the promised land where all of god's promises are supposed to be but he is destitute he's poor he's blind and he's begging amen but as everything has been taken from him and he's sitting there at jericho sitting on a rock that fell there by the power of god that when when when joseph or when joshua was was circling the city those seven days in a row and on the seventh day they circled seven times and when they said the circle in silence don't make one peep but they all sat at the loud make one shout oh and the walls they were so thick and so wide that they could run chariot races on the top of those walls all of a sudden they began to shake and they began to tremble and they began to fall down at the power of almighty god and here hundreds of years later there's a blind child of abraham sitting on one of those stones by the name of bartimaeus he's living in the promised land but he's not enjoying any of the promises he's the son of abraham but he's been told not to have the faith of abraham he's been trained and brought up to not believe in the things of abraham could happen to him that he could inherit the land like abraham was promised well that's a shame you know it's not you know god's people aren't supposed to be like that no sir hey man you can sit on some scripture for so long but you know there's got to become a day when those scriptures begin to come to pass in your life hey man you can sit in your in your chair all broken down and not seeing the promises for so long like bartimaeus was but there's got to come a time where the bride of christ begins to shake herself amen and wake up from those things and realize that the the day has come to inherit these promises amen not just to stare at some a message from a day gone by amen or to or to stare at this or to stare at that but to realize that this is the message that this is the day that this is the hour this is the time for the bride of christ amen to get good at inheriting the promises of god amen amen in my notes from long ago i got this little drawing of a pyramid and i'm not much of an artist but but i got and in the midst of the side of the pyramid there's this little chunk missing and then off over here you see a chunk that's shaped just like that missing part and that little chunk has one of those little conversation bubbles and it's saying rock of ages cleft for me lord let me hide myself in v yes that little chunk is shaped just perfectly to fit in that little clef there that's where it came from and that's where it's going back to amen we came from the supernatural amen we came from the supernatural amen that that that that body of the lord jesus christ that walked on this earth for 33 years that had visions and dreams and and supernaturally he walked through doors he walked through walls he he raised the dead he gave comfort to those that were mourned amen he set the captives free amen the blind could see the lame could walk that same body had a cleft in it amen amen that same body had a cleft in it is that is it when jesus was giving his last ins instructions to the disciples and as they're talking to him there and all of a sudden that he began to lift up off the earth and they're staring at him as he begins to ascend up on high and he and he and as they're staring there he was obscured by a cloud and they couldn't see him anymore and the angels all sent up here and says what are you looking at why are you standing there why are you just standing there he's don't you know he's going to return just the way same way that he left he's coming in a cloud saints yes sir amen he's coming in a cloud he's going to come back the same way he left amen amen there's been a cloud saints see what day we're living in we're living in a day in an hour whereas brother graham says the negative becomes the positives we're living in a day in an hour where the bride of christ is to be revealed that she will trust in the word amen there is going to be one that made room for the word amen now there's going to be many that have temples that are named after some man right herod's temple is now at the temple jesus walked into a temple what was the name of that temple it was named herod's temple why was it named herod's temple well because he's the one that paid for it i guess i don't know amen but jesus walked into a temple that was called herod's temple and they were his disciples were all look at these beautiful stones and look at these great columns and he looked at me says i tell you the truth not one of these stones will be left upon another and let me tell you all of these denominational walls and these great systems and things that we look upon these last days not one of them is going to stand not one stone will be left upon another amen amen you know everyone paul said everyone has to be careful how they build the kingdom of god now everyone has been called to be uh to build upon those that have built before us amen amen paul was that wise master builder the bible says he laid a foundation amen a foundation of prophecy amen the foundation of the word to to bake a strong foundation in christ now he said to us every man has to build on this but some are going to build with wood some will build with straw some will build with these things but he says in the last days it will all be tried by fire amen and the fire will try every little bit of it to see what sword is amen and when that structure comes through the fire all that's gonna be left is the purified structure of god which is the bride of christ now if you've been busy building out straw and wood and things of this world let me tell you you might be saved but that's you just got to be it's by the skin of your teeth and we ain't called to be saved like that amen he's the bible paul says they will suffer loss but those that build with the word of god those that build by the spirit of god amen those that listen to the lord and listen to the spirit of god they say lord what shall i do this day lord what those that are led by the holy ghost they are the ones that are building the temple of god amen but those are just just living a lukewarm life upon this earth there is no promise that you're really going to have anything to be rewarded of when you get there yeah amen if you get there at all hey man it's a dangerous place to be well how do i get this reward brother how do we get this goal amen come on there's only one way saints yes sir just to be led by the holy ghost you gotta hear his voice now if you're not led by the holy ghost let me tell you you can never do anything for god you can't do it you can try you can do bible studies you can pass tracks in the street you can witness you can memorize scriptures you can preach the gospel you can study you can do all those things you can praise you can raise your hands you can do all those things but if you are not led by the spirit of god it's all for nothing and it will be burned up on that last day amen amen every man's work shall go through the fire amen if your work research if your work that you have done for the lord survives that fire survives that purging then you'll receive a reward amen amen otherwise you'll just go bankrupt amen amen but jesus he walked into the temple and he looked around you know what you know what he didn't see anything there that was what he was looking for isn't that a shame there was a temple that was up in the heavens because moses saw it and he came down and he made that tabernacle according to the pattern but there's no word about what inspiration herod had to rebuild that temple there's no word about whether that temple why that temple was worthy to be called the temple jehovah amen the babylonians had destroyed it they came back out of the babylonian captivity and they rebuilt something but there's no word that says exactly that the cloud ever came down that the pillar of the fire ever appeared amen jesus walked in and instead of saying this is a good place for me this is where i've longed to dwell instead he walks out and says not one stone to this will be left upon another amen and he went and he went down to bethany spent the night down there the word came and the word left you know there's one thing to bring jesus upon the scene but it's another thing to get him to stay amen it's one thing to bring jesus upon the scene in your worship service amen or if when you pray when you have a knee but it's another thing for to get him to stay day by day to walk in the spirit amen amen but let me tell you that's that's what we got to get to since amen if we're not there then we're in a dangerous place we're living in last days we ought to be living in the where we can testify and say i am living by the power of the holy ghost amen the trials of life are many but yes i'm laying upon the altar amen i'm following the leadership of the holy ghost amen i got a well-beaten path to the altar amen amen amen blind bartimaeus there he was sitting upon that rock and he was sitting there blind and he felt the warm sun as it went came out from behind the tree behind the rock wall wherever it was he felt the warmth of the sun hit him and he could remember back from the day when he could see back in the day when he could see when the sun would rise and the birds would sing you know in the in the the fields and the meadows and different things and he could remember on those days when his mother would tell him all those bible stories about how about how joshua had uh it marched around the city of jericho and and the walls came tumbling down and by the supernatural power of god but now he is the child of abraham is sitting on one of those stones that fell by the power of god and he's sitting there defeated wondering where did the power of god go where did it go he's like just a few just a few miles from here is where joshua was walking through the field one morning and he saw a man with a sword so he drew his own sword he said are you with us or are you for our enemy and the man says nay but i am the captain of the host of the lord amen and bartimaeus he's sitting there blind and defeated began to think oh lord jehovah if i had been there in joshua's day if i had been behind a bush or something wouldn't seen that transpire i would i would run up to the captain of the lord's host and said oh great captain of the hosts of the lord i pray that you would give me my sight back and i know that the lord would give me my sight back but those days are gone on no longer here so i just have to live with this burden of living underneath my privileges living underneath where i ought to be no longer overcoming but now i've been overcame it was a shame amen as he began to think about some other bible stories that his mother told him about how elijah and elisha had walked down that same road that he's sitting on he's sitting there begging by the side of the road and elijah and elisha had walked on that same road on their way to jordan to go pass smite the river jordan and uh watch the waters park so they could walk by on dry ground he started thinking those great prophets of lords elijah was going to be taken up into the heavens in a supernatural chariot of fire if i had seen them walking their arm and arm down to the river jordan i would have jumped up off this rock and i would have said lord or great great prophets are the most high god i would that you would give me my sight back but i think those days of gone on it seems like jehovah doesn't do those things anymore but as he was pondering those bible stories he began to hear a noise in the distance he began to hear a shouting of joy shouts of anger shouts of insults shouts of mocking all kinds of noises and he began to wonder what's going on and he and someone began to tell him to testify that god has written risen up a prophet like unto moses amen one that would fulfill all the prophecies of the old testament some of them where the where the the blind were seen the lame were walking the dead were rising or raising back to life again when he began to realize that he was living in bible days he began to realize that that the god of jehovah was now entered into a body of flesh and that body of flesh was walking right down his path he began to he jumped up to his feet and he heard it as it passed by and he was afraid that he was going to miss his chance so he began to cry and scream out and oh jesus the son of david have mercy upon me have mercy upon me and they began to cry out to him you know be quiet you're being too loud you're making too much noise and he began to cry louder and louder jesus that son of david have mercy upon me have mercy upon me his desperation took hold of him amen because he began to realize that the the god of elijah and elisha was walking by amen the god that the god that spoke to the walls of jericho was walking by god was visiting jericho again this time to heal a blind baker amen he was his brother braham gives that drama he was jesus was walking by jericho with the weight of the world sins upon his shoulder going down to the cross to be crucified but as he was passing by there was a little child of abraham that was sitting there blind and begging that faith began to rise up in that blind beggar's heart and when that faith reached a certain reach a certain pitch amen that when that faith all of a sudden raised up within within bartimaeus that he that something just meant to strengthen his legs something commanded his ankles stand up something told his knees you need to straighten out and move something spoke to his body says you need to get up something spoke to his vocal cords you need to cry out something said to him you need to shout you need to cry out you need to cry out to this one amen he heard the message of jesus christ the son of the living god is passing by this way amen he cried out cleft to the rock amen place for me lord let me hide myself in thee oh son of abraham son of david jesus have mercy upon me amen and he became another joshua amen right there where joshua had commanded the sun to stand still now another son of abraham is once again commanding the sun to stand still when the son of david stopped in his tracks at the set at the noise at the shout of a little bigger amen because faith had risen up in his heart hey man jesus he he walked into the he walked into the temple and he didn't find a whole lot those praise worthy going on there but when he looked into bartimaeus's heart he says that's my son amen and his story has been how many people were healed in those 10 meetings that brother branham held by that title just think about that 10 15 messages that brother bran preached under the title blind bartimaeus each one has a prayer line after where supernatural things were done right here in our day amen where someone will be in the audience and he would say your name is is john smith and you're from kentucky and you're not here for yourself but you're you're here for your loved one and you're crying out for him but let me tell you you have a greater problem than robin a couple of me says you're not even a christian before you can salvate before you need a healing for your loved one you need to get saved amen yourself right there the person would give their heart to the lord praise god how in the world did he know they weren't a christian there's something there besides brother bran there was a visitation in our day amen amen god in our day has visited the people again amen amen he's come and he came to all the temples of this day amen he went to the baptist temple he went to the catholic temple he went to the pentecostal temple he went to every temple that had some name tacked to it he came he went and there he goes but there's got to be some children of abraham that began to hear the testimony of one that rose the dead amen amen where the sick were healed amen and every prayer me every prayer line that was there in brother branham's messages amen that happened in our day amen all those things there wasn't brother brown there was god that was showing himself to be alive and the same yesterday today and forever and it happened right here in our day he went to the temples and couldn't find room amen but there's got to be a bride that stands up and waves her hand jesus thou son of david have mercy upon me have mercy upon me she brings jesus upon the scene she stops the son of god in his tracks amen as he is being crucified the second time amen amen brother branham preaches that message where he says maybe as an indictment i don't recall but he reads those four words from that scripture or that four phrases from that scripture he says there they crucified him he says it was right there in the gospels and it says there at the end of one of the gospels how much one it is there's that one verse it has those four words it says there they crucified him brother brahm he breaks it down and he says there in the holiest city amen they god's holy people crucified the most painful and horrible death him the roast righteous and holy man to ever live their only hope for salvation there they crucified him but they might have judged him not worthy he came into their temples and then he walked by out again and now their temple was ruined two thousand years later they're still crying out for their temple oh they might have that little cornerstone that they made 20 30 years ago thinking that they're going to build another temple there in jerusalem by the power of some man but let me tell you without the holy spirit it's not going to amount to anything they have all the prophecies going on over in jerusalem and all those things let me tell you and tell the holy spirit i know it's 144 000 over there until the elijah and moses show up on the scene down there it's not going to amount to a hill of beings they need the holy ghost amen when they get into the holy ghost until the bride gets the holy ghost first hey man the bride is the one that right now and he's a stand up on her feet as she's been blind too long amen she's been sitting there begging and underneath the promises of god for too long amen for that time where she has to cry out to the one that's passing by jesus outside david have mercy upon me i'm living in the promised land but i'm not inheriting the promises o lord god have mercy upon me amen there's got to be one amen let's uh let's turn over to isaiah 42. in isaiah 42 and the 42nd chapter and the 43rd chapter both it has a just a long chain of thought here and as god is introducing the messiah he's introducing that there's going to be a deliverer in isaiah 42 1 he says he starts out with this one word he says behold the word behold there means look i want you to look at something i want you to stop what you're doing i want you to look at this he's commanding the jews to stop right now look at this he says behold my servant whom i uphold my elect and whom my soul goliath i have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles he says he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street a bruise read he shall not break the smoking flacks he shall not quench he should bring forth judgment unto truth he shall not fail nor be discouraged until he has set judgment in the earth and the isles shall wait for his law amen verse six i the lord hath called thee in righteousness and will hold thy hand i will keep thee and give thee for a covenant to the people for a light for the gentiles you know there's got to be a light to come to the gentiles there's got to be something that will come to the to the seed of the slain and the gentiles dormant they're aiming to shine on and when that light shines on them it begins to warm up the soil as the soil begins to warm up and it's all sudden those blind bartimaeuses begin to hear the sound and the distance the sound of healing amen the sound of rejoicing the sound of god passing them by amen amen go down to uh verse 21 or verse 18 it says hear ye deaf and look ye blind that you may see amen that was the problem is god's children they were blind and deaf i mean how could god reach them but god somehow had to heal the blindness and heal the the deafness first amen i mean he did that 2000 years ago in the natural hey now he's got to do it right now in the spiritual amen to get us to hear to get us to see amen verse 20 he says see many things thou observest not opening the ears be here is not verse 22 but this is a people that is robbed and spoils they are all of them snared in holes they are hid in prison houses they are for a prey and none delivers therefore a spoil and none says restore you know there's got to be a people so there's like someone that cries out the store well that was the problem that he had right there is there's the people that are living there in bondage but there's there's no one crying out restored here's the promises of god but there's no one crying out for them there's gotta be someone that can bring jesus on the scene now brother branham was the wave sheath right amen he was the first one to come to maturity amen he is way before a generation amen what if people were restored under that waving but where's brother branham well he's been taken off the scene well he was the first one to come to maturity amen there's got to be more like that to come to maturity amen not to have that same ministry but to have that same faith to realize who they are he came to bring a bride for to tithe isaac amen they came to bring a bride to christ and she will be just like him amen amen amen there's all these names upon the lamb's book of life amen they've been laying there waiting to come to maturity amen but those names are not just names like you would think john or mary or martha but those names are characteristics amen characteristics of jehovah that are assigned to specific people every single person has a has a characteristic of jehovah a characteristic of their creator that's been assigned to them that they are here to manifest that characteristic they're here to show a forth amen there is a seed that has been given to them amen there's a theophany that is standing there that is there that is there to they're there to manifest what their theophany is speaking of amen but it doesn't come until the sun begins to shine on the soil and it begins to warm and the moisture of the uh you as you come to the church services and all of a sudden that faith begins to rise up in your heart just like a rising blind bartimaeus heart amen when that faith begins to realize that you're not just reading about the bible not just reading the bible every once in a while but you've now you're living in bible days and you yourself have become a bible character amen you now are now living in the pages of the bible and the characteristics of god are living inside of you amen jesus sent the disciples out two by two and they came back rejoicing and they said lord even the devils are subject to done to us according to your name and they're so excited about the power of god and jesus looked at him he said don't rejoice because devils are subject unto you he said nobody rejoice because your names are written upon the lamb's book of life in the heavens amen amen your god-given characteristics have to be manifested in this last day everything else will be burned up amen amen your job will be burned up your house will be burned up every single thing will be burned up and the only thing will be left will be the things that you have done through the power of the holy ghost amen amen the only things that will be left for you is the things that you did underneath the leadership of the holy ghost every single one of us must be led amen every single one of us must be led every single member of the bride of christ will be led by her husband and in the last days as the holy spirit begins to lift up off the earth those that live and serve in the temple of herod they might have had many fine worship services they might have enjoyed jesus walking into their temple every once in a while they might have enjoyed the presence of jesus in their midst but let me tell you he's gone off to bethany he came to the temple and he's left but in hebrews 13 12 i believe it is you know 13 8 is jesus is the same yesterday today and forever but i think it's in hebrews 13 12 where paul is continuing on he says you know those that are still down there 20 years after christ they're serving in the tabernacle they're they're still serving in the temple and they're still worshiping at that altar but you know what we have an altar that those priests have no right to come to you at this altar oh they might be they might be thinking that they're serving the alt at the altar the one true god but that altar has moved on jesus went on to bethany jesus has left the temple amen jesus ascended up on high and came back down on the day of pentecost and if you want to serve him nowadays you got to be filled with the holy ghost amen and that's the altar that we got to worship at that's the ultimate thing we ought to praise that amen that's the ultimate live and move and have our being amen there is an altar that remains for the bride of christ and those that serve denominations can't eat from this altar amen amen but if you have found the way to that hidden altar let me tell you there is a reward for you amen why because when you begin to eat the hidden manna serving at the hidden altar worshiping the god that hides in plain sight remember the the veil used to be at the temple but then after jesus died that veil rent where did the veil go it went to the hearts and in hebrews it says that that veil it remains on their hearts untaken away and if that veil would ever be taken away they would see they could turn and be saved and be changed from glory to glory amen be changed into the image of god that veil is not at the temple in jerusalem anymore now that veil is upon the hearts god was crucified in plain view there they crucified him he was crucified in this last days in plain view the second crucifixion of jesus christ he was crucified in plain view when they rejected the miracles and the signs and wonders amen and now that same veil remains on their heart when moses is preached when jesus has preached amen when the ministry underestimates ministry is preached that means for that holy ghost ministry the veils upon their heart untaken away hebrew says if it would ever be taken away then they would all suddenly begin to be changed from glory to glory because when that veil is removed all of a sudden your heart turns into a mirror and begins to reflect the lord jesus christ and you begin to be changed and then those old habits begin to roll away those old dirty habits begin rolling away those old things that you wish you could get rid of began rolling away as you began to stare face to face with the lord jesus christ oh you might have your trials you might have your hard times but they that wait upon the lord they're going to renew their strengths oh there will be many people that do this and many people do that but there's going to be a people that are waiting upon the lord amen those are the ones that are going to renew their strengths that's what happened to abraham he was waiting upon the lord he he sacrificed the birds in half he sacrificed the sheep in half and he divided everything in half and he just laid him there in two pieces and then he sat down on the rock and waited and waited and waited and the birds had come down and tried to eat the sacrifice he'd get up and shoo him away he'd see some flies over on another one he'd go shoo him away and he just waited and waited what are you doing there abraham what are you doing there oh just waiting hours and hours and hours went by because he knew that he had sacrificed to jehovah and he waded away and all of a sudden that darkness came upon him amen and it seemed like he was going to pass away it seemed like he was going to die and all of a sudden this burning lamp came down and passed through the sacrifice amen he was saved he was waiting upon the lord every single one of us goes through those dark hard times where all you can do is wait you've done every single thing you know how to do that's it amen and then you just have to wait for god to do the things that only god can do amen amen abraham in that scripture there he divided the sacrifices that's something god could do or something abraham could do he he could catch the birds he could catch the lamb he could slam he could kill him he could divide them in half he could lay them neatly there and separate it there was nothing else he could do he had to wait for god to come down and consume the sacrifice he waited he waited the enemy would come and try to take the sacrifice away the enemy would come again and the enemy would come again he just kept shooing the enemy away kept shoeing the enemy away kept shoeing the enemy away and all of a sudden when it seemed like he was going to pass away when the the horror of death came upon him the horror of darkness came upon the bible says then all of a sudden he saw this light coming from a distance and came down past between the pieces of the sacrifice and god did something for abraham that abraham couldn't do himself amen every member of the bride of christ will have that testimony amen that god has done something for me that i couldn't do for myself oh i i was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ in the water that's something you can do i repented of my sins yes that's something you can do amen but you just got to hold that sacrifice there hold that sacrifice there and when the enemy comes and tries to bring this into your life just chew it away amen when the enemy brings this into your life just shoo it away just keep waiting there waiting there all of a sudden when you're when your flesh begins to rot when your flesh begins to die amen when you begin to perish to your own thoughts to your own ideas amen all of a sudden that fire comes down from heaven and passes through the sacrifice amen in the lamb of god makes way for you and the holy ghost fills you amen and god does something for you that you cannot do yourself amen then jesus is no longer just coming into the temple and leaving coming into the temple and leaving but now we've made room for the word jesus has come to stay i'll be with you even in you until the end of the age i'll never leave you nor forsake you just ask abundantly that your joy might be full wherever you bind on the earth all bind into the heavens and whatsoever you shall say it shall be done unto you amen i'll give you the half even unto the half of the kingdom amen all these promises shall be unto you according to the word of god when jesus the word comes into your place it's when the word was resting when the prophet came and went came and went came and went had supper ate for a while enjoyed the fellowship but when they made a bed for him when they made a room for him when they made a place he could come and stay and the word entered into that place and the word began to relax when the prophet began to relax when the word began to relax and when the word began to rest there and all of a sudden then the vision came what do you need what do you want what can i do for you amen isn't that what happened to esther she made the feast for the king and he says what do you want he's like she's like i want you to come to tomorrow's feast and he came to tomorrow's feast and he says esther what do you want and she said i want you to come to tomorrow's feast and so he comes to the third feast esther what do you all give it to you whatever it is to the half of the kingdom and so is the sow and the word begins to rest in our days what do you want ask abundantly that your joy might be full just in closing let's turn to uh proverbs 13 12. across the scriptures yesterday or this morning i believe it was proverbs 13 12. was to be a you know god's people have desires in their lives amen hebrews or proverbs 13 12 says hope deferred makes the heart sick but when does but when the desire cometh it is a tree of life i wish yes i want you to think about that you know when you hear of these bible stories you hear of a god that is ever present that comes upon the scene for his people you can have a great hope upon those things but that never comes to pass in your life that makes your heart sink amen but when the desires of your heart begin to be fulfilled when the prayers that you've laid upon the altar begin to be answered and god begins to do things for you that you could never do yourself amen and that is a tree of life unto you amen why is that tree of life unto you because that's god himself has come in that's when the word has now come into your heart amen it's not just sitting there like blind bartimaeus oh i've heard of all those promises i've heard of those promises of old but i guess they've just gone by you know he's making himself sick sitting on that rock every day sitting our rock that fell there by the power of god but never inheriting the promises it makes us the heart sick but one day when he began to cry out oh jesus son of david have mercy it was a tree of life had come to him amen the tree of life had come to him amen was it and then all those promises he began to be what he was what god saw of him before the foundation of the world and every single one of us has been called to be where do these desires come from that are in our hearts i think about a real true christian that's been saved and sanctified a real true honest sincere christian where do the desires in their hearts come from all right if it was a sinful desire they would just cry out against it but there remains those desires that that sometimes you don't even know they almost seem like a natural desire sometimes you know it might be just something simple but still if when there's a desire there don't just ignore those things i don't care what it is if i don't care if it's a job or or just wanting to serve the lord better whether there may be natural or supernatural because to the bride your life is supernatural when that desire is when those desires begin to be answered in your heart it becomes a tree of life to you why because that's when the tree of life has come to you and it brings you and does something for you in your life that you cannot do yourself then you can testify this is what god has done for me this is what god for does when he begins to grant you the desires of your heart amen don't just ignore the desires of your heart but rather take them to an altar because we have an altar that those that serve denominations have no right to amen take those desires to the altar and watch the tree of life come into your life lord and spring up a well into a river everlasting amen let's just stand bringing jesus on the scene one time jesus he saw a man of paul's had palsy had the shakes he looked at me said be of good cheer don't worry don't be afraid be a good cheer the man was saved healed delivered sins were forgiven another time the disciples were riding through a storm on a boat they began to get scared and they looked down the sea and they thought they saw a spirit and they cried out with fear and jesus walking on the water said be of good cheer amen you know when paul had heard these testimonies heard these stories perhaps maybe he hadn't i don't know but paul yeah he had he had heard these stories one day he was serving the lord and all of a sudden he was in a room and jesus came and stood by his side and said to him be of good cheer use that same phrase he heard his friends the disciples speaking of then later paul was in the same situation one day where he was on a boat crossing the sea and everybody thought they were afraid all the prisoners he was a prisoner and the prisoners and the the the the jail holders all thought the captain they all thought they were gonna sink and die all of a sudden paul stood up on his feet and he began to tell him he began to testify some words that he'd heard before because now that same jesus was inside of him and he said be of good cheer not one man will cherish will shall perish tonight amen and what gave paul the right to say those words to act like he was in the place of jesus christ to say the same things that jesus christ said to give life like jesus christ gave what what gave paul that authority jesus christ came inside of him that god was now on the inside of him that same jesus that was walking on the sea that told the disciples be of good cheer when they were afraid was now on the inside of paul speaking to that captain of the boat be of good cheer amen we've gone through our storms and christ has had told us don't be afraid be of good cheer but there's got to be a time where you're no longer just being afraid but now you're the one speaking peace you're the one saying peace to the storm you're the one saying be not afraid you're the one saying rise up be healed amen it's your turn to walk in the footsteps of jesus christ it's your turn to bring jesus upon the scene because i want to tell you the truth in the last days before the rapture the bride of christ will be the only one that can jesus on the scene shall be the only one divine love will only be in the bride of christ they're the only ones that will be able to turn the other cheek they'll be the only ones that can go the extra mile they'll be the only ones that can love with an everlasting love that cannot be depleted they're the only ones that can say restore they're the only ones that could say be healed in the last days before the bride goes up amen let's just bow our heads word prayer heavenly father we just want to thank you lord for this word lord we know who you are lord the lord let us come to that place that we know who we are father that those
