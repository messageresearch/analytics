just pray the Lord continued betcha on his ministry could that's a great thing in Jesus Christ man so but that being said being a prolonged of time y'all just stamped me against we read the word of the Lord amen praise the Lord Amen The Book of Luke go Luke the sixteenth chapter and we've been getting at the 19th verse you got it says there was a certain rich man who was clothed and purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores and designed to be fair with the crumb which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores and they came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom and he cried and said father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this flame be Abraham said son remember the darling thy lifetime receivers thy good things and likewise Lazarus evil things but now he is comforted in dollar tormented and besides all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed hey man you can't get back up on the other side neither can it passed to us that would come from thence then he said I pretty therefore father that I would have seen him to my father's house for I have five brothers that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment Abraham said unto him they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them hear the word for your day they had a method for he had a method for his day he had a message and he said nay father Hamor one but a one way from the dead they will repent he said unto Him and they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the day let us bow Heavenly Father we read your holy word and I wrecked your breasts upon it once again the name of your son the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise Lord may be seated a man so we thank the law for reading of the word this is the screen message but we ministered somewhere else in the law blessed in I pray it be a blessing to you here tonight and we're gonna take a topic from there the rich man's plea the rich man's plea it's something this job just man being rich in the Bible I like the way Jesus tossed the story off he said there was a certain rich man and a certain bigger that means they were known okay alright by the grace of God I'm from Georgetown South Carolina they called us a geeky and Georgia and reach all kind of fans by the grace of God y'all forgive me of my fast talking so they were they were not known to us but Jesus knew them and only that Jesus know them but the people around them knew them that would say there was a certain rich man there was a certain beggar there were no one in the community was nothing screened they were known and jesus knew them so he began to tell the story about this rich man and this bigger and this rich man the Bible said he feared sumptuously he ate sumptuously every day that were something to me and he had the most magnificent food setting that you can see he didn't worry about no food brother he had all that cup of the Bible he fared sumptuously every day wasn't the day went by that he didn't eat a real great big meal all the fines of that did that he can get the Bible he hacking about he fears something me every day so every day he ate a very good meal one the time he can say that he went there hungry because he was rich and he could do whatever he wanted to do with his money but God had put somebody in his way notice the Bible plays Lazarus at the rich man's gate he was not nowhere far off from him he was right there someplace where he can be seen by the rich man every day he was at the Richmond gate that's very important obstacle this mannequin final kind of attitude this man had he had a bad attitude a bad spirit because he will be able to pass by lashes every day this gate and even think about him he saw last was a man sitting down there beggar full of sores hungry needing some need to hit a rich man passing by every day every day he eat sumptuously he fares good he got all the food can be worn it and he had a rich man you see sitting up no fall off now the Bible said he sat at the rich man's gate you got us get God I said God placed him there god bless him right where he can be seen and that what God does God put people in our way that they can be seen by us now we real Christian we should be able to identify them and this man here he wasn't no just average of man I believe he went to church I believe he was religious that was Jesus identified these two these people are religious people Lashley was a believer go we're getting to the story the Bob's Eliza was taken by the Angels into Abraham's bosom he wasn't that place of paradise where the Old Testament sense of that day went see so Abraham he wouldn't happen but see the Lazarus in the Richmond this rich man he fared sumptuously every day it's the best of the best had the best of the best but he was so starchy he was slow Oh God is so bad he can pass by Lazarus and not pill Angelini attention Christians should not be their starchy if you got Christ inside of you there's no way you can pass by somebody you need and shut your bowels up to me there's no way you can do that unless a man you just got that kind of a mentality or spirit to live like that there's many religious people that live like that they say they love the Lord and go to church but when someone is a need they need help they pass right by on paying no attention and God put them people in our way god please stand living out there by accident they're there on purpose God please the beggar and lastly the gift you can see him every day he passed by that man gorgeous hot Emma he we had to go grocery shop he had to get the food he had to get food they eat out good every day he had to see laughter sitting there full of sores the Bible said the dogs came and licked them that's right the only that the Bible said that he desired the crumbs they fell from the rich man's table you know that rich man went him give him the crumbs look at his spirit his spirit is just bad but he'd get he's religious he is a religious man that got it made no you know what the Prophet said your proud is what the same young man then asked Jesus for eternal life the same man now he's all grown up life was going on he got his bars you got everything he would but notice his heart is hardened now his heart has become hard you know why did he reject the gospel when he had an opportunity to get eternal life he turned it down and his life never was the same see you can't reject the gospel when the gospel comes to you that's the opportunity to receive it and when it calmed that when God is knocking at your door and you need to hear the call you need to hand sort of card this young rich man he made a bad decision he chose riches all the eternal life didn't come sell all that you have give to the poor come take up your cross and follow me no the Jesus told him right then give to the poor give to the poor didn't come take up your cross and follow me now here a poor beggar and wet his gate he's at his gate it sure is hard never was right with the law I read that story about the young rich look he was just playing with Jesus he already know what we do to you were living right you know he didn't commit a doctor you didn't lied and stealing ride it all long thing I kept from my youth um what lack I yeah feel like he was trying to prove something and she looked at him get his love in the Bible to Jesus love to him this is it one thing you lack one thing we all lack we're all lacking something we might think we've got a man but we are always lacking something and that something that we lacking is more God he was doing the commandment he was living right but he needed to go to an extra step to accept the Lord Jesus as his personal Savior that's a step he was not willing to take cuz why he would had to give up all that he had now remember when you choose to serve the Lord you were losing nothing you'll never God never takes God gives God is a giver and you can't be God given if God asks you to give up something he has something better for you down the road I'm a witness him and if God ever asked you to give up something remember there's something better for you down the road you have be willing to scratch out on faith to receive hit as Richard does John Rich on ruler he wasn't willing to make that step he wasn't willing to make that step to scratch out on faith to take God at His Word that he can do what Jesus said God how many guys saved a lot a lot of blessed Shaw Finch I've come to the Lord you haven't gotten poorer you've got richer you only have you gotten richer you're not only naturally but spiritually there were the great riches of that is in the spirit so Bogardus bless you naturally you left a lot of stuff behind you caught me could have been more than what you are now but you chose the way of the Lord and the blessing of God has blessed you would you are satisfied I'm satisfied I'm not disappointed I'm satisfied but what the Lord has done for me in my life where God has brought me to in my life I'm satisfied could I see what a world if I had had my way in with the way I wanted to go I wouldn't be here today did I pass we were all was all was a path that always led to destruction and when the lead to the Lord so you should be satisfied where God had brought you to you have no regrets about your life because your life is in God it's in Christ and it's a it's a good life I won't change it for nothing inside the world all the riches the world got off I'll return it down to keep this life this was a good life in Christ so the rich man a rich young ruler it meant he gets old and that same hard there was in from the beginning it's still there God put that bigger at his gate rather just get what he can see him every day and nobody did he didn't pay the beggar no attention every day he passed by last Ruth full of sores the dogs come to Bible City and licked his sword I did used to do that in old time that dog licked it so I mean y'all nobody that dog under your bed the dog had healing this tongue of what but he let the dog lick this so that dog to lick it read all you to lick the sores it made it because I just feel like on the other dog we call him Jay and Jesus are coming liquor sold all those scripts and I need and stuff either come here JJ liquor stores if they had dogs to do that I don't know resume they're full of German I mean it with a dog licked his sores he did better than the rich man rich man didn't do nothing the rich man didn't do anything no look in the Bible and a fine under God all that got somebody at the gate Mordecai was at the Kings gate Mordecai God had Mordecai at the Kings gate Mordecai said at the Kings gate God had a God knew something was going to take place emoticon need to be in that place that when it opened he can be did intervene God had martyr kai at the Kings gate Mordecai I started the gate of King Ahasuerus it meant and what happened her enemy rolls up they meant a hit it to Jews Mosley who he hated he hit a motor-car come baaaack I was at the Kings gate he sat there and by martyr card being at the Kings gate within the enemy for the king when it was trying to kill him two men rose up but a Kingsguard when the king he has arrears but Mordecai saw it and nothing was never done for Mordecai after he did was a little did he went right back we was at sit down at the Kings gate at the Kings gate nowhere but just come to the Kings gate sit right down to God do something for you something's bound to happen all you got to do is calm and remain at the Kings gate no a motor-car didn't because of that we know the whole story a man it end up being that everything was turned God came in and worked right on time enough for me with just enough but when you read the book of Esther no one time what's the name of God ever mentioned but God hand is singing all through the book God always comes in right on time he knows when to come on the scene he call when laughs hey man thought he had the victory right when he made the gallows to hang Mordecai the King couldn't go to sleep y'all kept the king of where you keep on turning and turning there tossing and tossing and for some reason the kids they bring me the book of the records gah got everything down on a record book your good and your bad make sure you do good we're gonna talk about that make sure you're good outweigh your bad do good why you got the train that was America failed to do when God gave an opportunity to do good you know what he didn't do it he had the opportunity the man was at his gate sitting there waiting for him to help him God had him there I remember another story you all forgive me there's some of the other God sent a possum to a prophets gate he didn't understand why the possum was there but God opened his eyes and said that possum still there like a lady and waited for me to come and pray for her God said the possum to the prophets game right to the problems getting ahold of their message he sent a right to the prophets game a pause on animal he didn't recognize that but God had opened his eye to see that same old possum the God sent that possum to get a word of Prayer from a profit see so these people have two kings gave you got martyr Condor Kingsgate even you got our the rich man here at the Kings gate and here God sent a possum to a prophets gate sitting down all I need some help Mordecai needed some help the beggar needs some help the possum needed some help amen Rahl needs some help by the grace of God but notice right here they died the rich man died the beggar died this don't change who you are it don't change you what a dial to change your dwelling place the only change the place where you're going to go out it don't change who you're gonna change your makeup and read the books hit on driver did we have a ride in the car he said that samuel was still a prophet when the would end or called him up he was in another plane he told why did you disturb my rest he came back and still prophesied and told it man saw that today you will be with me see so death don't change who you are we will find out that when this man died it didn't change him he wouldn't fail old man that he was it didn't change who you are some people think or when I die I be somebody different no you can be that same person that you leave this earth if you've been a wicked man on the earth you can be a wicked man when you wake up again you's gonna be in a different place you can be in a place of torment if you've been wicked if you've been good you're going to a place of rest we know that place exists we don't have somebody that went over there on the other side it's real not a fairy tale we leave this place there you are going somewhere man we are going somewhere we hope to be or novice at all and people said we are resting on that it man the same thing that Paul preached I preached that's what we rested on see so we go someplace we don't just die there's old body here gets inside the grid and say it turn to dust dust to dust ashes to ashes all that that sound good but just so it's going somewhere it's going somewhere and they're not going to change you got to make your change here your change must take place here this is the changing room regardez lit available his gospel his words that you can change your life become another person that when you leave this place you'll be in a better place see this is the dressing room this is where you are for paying to meet the Lord it's real you preparing now in your death you can't wake the desk right to get ready because you can't wait to death strike to get read it's too late I mean some people do have a deathbed confession I don't know what it'll make it there now we want them to make we said oh god bless you we believe it's gonna make it but we do not know because we're not God or than we know what the word declared what the word says you must be baptized repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and received a gift for the Holy Ghost and you'll be saved that is the gospel the thief on the cross Amen it wasn't not instituted that he got in he said the dead thou shalt be with me in paradise I don't think that's gonna work again you have to make a decision that you're gonna serve the Lord you must make that decision I mean I have me in my decision if I thought it I am persuaded that he can change me now my mind has been made up a man I know whom I serve I know whom I believe and my mind is made up it made praise God nobody can change that no no death nor the nothing now is the argument made up by the grace of God so death a man does not change who we are this read on this buddy grace of God amen I love this right here now he has three pleased that he made the father Abraham the first plea was for mercy the mercy of God is here now you want mercy you better get it now you can't get it in hell there's no mercy in hell there's no mercy in hell only most you can get is why you're here right now you need God's mercy you - for now there is no mercy in hell once you go to hell you inhale the rich man he started accident for me especially you dad a little bit but you can see it now I'd say the rich man plea he went to all the stuff beginning to happen then he wants something done he want to start making a plea to God see but it's too late he's too late a man to get anything done the 24th verse and he cried and said father Abraham have mercy on me it's too late you had your chance God gave hear - I'm so you had more by two of the he had chances the first time when Jesus came to him then God sent a beggar to him he had a chance after chance after chance to do what's right and he refused to do it y'all hear that God give you a chance that you know Chauncey God will not be called a liar you will not say God well I didn't know I didn't I didn't know I had to do all the I guess you didn't know but God gave you a chance God sent the word to you God gave you a chance to hear the gospel so there's no excuse see in this Britain is messing law have mercy on me no it's too late for mercy go you in the wrong place for mercy is done here on earth Mary no mercy in hell you are not fine mercy inhale the hell created for the devil Nadine you go down to that place you gonna be with them okay your opportunity not to be with the Lord us now y'all give me a chance he can have mercy on your soul amen notice the next plea was for water for the Abraham seeing Lazarus he may dip his finger in water and cool my tongue notice an attitude toward Lazarus is that of a servant the latches just serve him feel hot he never changed if they had a tool to our ladder didn't change he will laughing not to be servant or bring Mesa let Lynette Lazarus come and bring me some water see we both disturbed one another we are supposed to serve one another I'm the fourth to serve no man go he's like me some great man and stuff of that you serve belong we Barbossa don't be armed serving under men but served the Lord Christ we're not servants to men be not to serving some men so we don't serve man and hitting on the rich man on the others he inhale one last risk becoming dippers thing in the water and give him some water on this tongue see it's it's his attitude to our last risk it's still the same it has not changed he didn't care for latchet when he was on earth and he's in the hair on his store had no care for lastra wonder he look at ladders of being is a servant you know kidnap my lashes but inhale he won't last me bring him some water see so he want some mercy it's too late for mercy he want some water there's no water in hell you think water to be in here there's no water in hell when the fire burning you up I could burn this man up you want some water to cool you off there will be none there there's no water your chance to get waters now Jesus any man thirst let him come unto me and drink it man all of us belly shall flow rivers of living water see your opportunity to get waters now I'd rather have the spiritual water than the natural water Jesus told a woman at the web you drink this water you will thirst again if you drink the water I forgive you it had been your world of water springing and everlasting life see that water your thirst again with the spiritual water it'll cost you not the thirst you want thirst for the things of the world you want thirds in love with those sinful things the more that tends to be burning our God to come and quench the thirst I love here quench the thirst my father have been quenched I don't desire those things from a wife I've gotten into living water I got the living water there's no water in here there's no mercy there neither's any water your opportunity for mercy and to get water is now don't turn it down seek the Lord why you have a chance serve the Lord why you got the opportunity go because once you leave the earth if you don't leave the way God see leave begin at the same place the rich man is that see he was religious I want to get to that part he was religious he wasn't just anybody called me doesn't rain but father Abraham said he was religious he knew the word for his day he knew the message first day he said they have Moses and the Prophet so he had the message for his day he heard he you know you heard about Jesus saying he heard Jesus preaching here but jesus said now Jesus punch him back you got Moses and the probably remember Jesus came in between their dispensation here and at the end of Moses ministry a motive dispensation come retin-a between John the Baptist to start and something new so Jesus had appoint him back to where he was he stood with under Moses ministry and Moses message and that word Jesus pointed him back to you have Moses and the prophets you should have heard them you don't hit you got a message that God sent you on this day you better hear that hear the word that God has sent you but let go when you die go on to fear the same thing didn't you have a prophet that I've seen your prophet in a message see so here now don't wait here we got assented in the barn two speakers had a word of the Lord hit a message of God see so god pulling him record we need to be they have Moses and the prophets how many 25th verse mia hamm said son remember the dial in our lifetime you see was like good things and likewise Lazarus evil things but now he is comforted in dollar torment you'll notice he all his memory was intact you don't lose your memory in hell his memory was intact he can remember the things he ate he can remember how he treated laughter DC say he they remember the downed our lifetime had died good thing see but now you torment it and Lazarus is competent Lazar can remember - he know all the total men he went through on earth but now he's just happy as can be he done made it another stuff my team and I made I made it over here geez gonna be drugs when you make it over that's what rejoicing come he goes all of our trials in now but Lord let me make it over man I want to make hold on the homicide a man thank God for this song I'm rejoicing now but I want to get over on the other side Amen to see the Lord so a man they had Moses and man they had the prophets he's supposed to head them see now what else he wants he wants something else you didn't try to get working to try to get mercy they ain't working you didn't try to get water ain't working so you got one more please Laura sent him to war my brothers and they don't come to this place see his brothers were just like him he lived just like he live that what he said go warn them go warn them then they go to church and they religious but they really ain't taking no heed to the message they living the message as opposed to live so go warn them let me down when Jesus told him about they got more than the problem go well go warn them see he wants something done neither live his life he didn't did what was wrong now he wasn't all these things done but it ain't gonna happen see the rich man's plea hands up inhale and want these things done I'm gonna read something to you by the grace of God what did he fail to do he failed to do good when he had the chance definitely definitely failure was he failed to do good when he had the chance this said I'm John Wesley made this little Court right here I'm going to read it to you do all the good you can and all the ways you can and all the seasons you can so all the people you can and as long as you can see do good if you can do good to somebody but God put them in your way doing good because if you give a cup of cold water to somebody that's thirsty it'll come back to you the Bible the cash of bread upon the water but after many days it shall return the new good why you got to change don't pass up the opportunity to do good yeah with this rich man thought was God please lashes rather just gate I know how can you walk by somebody at your gate that's hungry when you got the means to feel how can you do it less your heart is hardened can y'all see that how can he pass Lazarus every day he didn't pass them he knew he was out there see and saw this man know this man was hungry no he wanted some crumb he wouldn't give him the crumbs that fell from his table see what kind of mushy pea got in but somebody that wanted to serve the Lord but somebody now whose heart is so hard and he don't you want to do what's right see he's in bad shape see no we don't want to end up that way though you don't want that with what God is calling you here to call but God is speaking to your spirit hit a car a man go God you won't get a chance again you might never get the chance again see to do that let's go to Ecclesiastes the 3rd chapter it let go never get the chance opportunity to gain to hear the gospel you might never get it it might be the time that God is speaking to you and you you miss it you go away and things begin to go wrong for you get caught up in some bad stuff and you get out there and didn't you can't get back under the remember to store about the lady there the left at the prophets message laugh at it and say she went her car had that kind of religion you saw her many years later she was drunk and everything and telling the prophets if you like I see my momma and daddy burn in hell I just laugh at see she rejected the gospel she rejected the opportunity to serve the Lord when they had a chance and because of that her life never washed the same it began to go downhill Sam theatres young just young rich ruler he had the opportunity to get eternal life and he turned her down on her life never was the same it changed them see we don't received along the Lord is calling you and talking to you and your life takes a bad turn I've seen I'm just different people in the Bible but people we administered to and seeing how God was calling these people and it refused to call and then come the life in our being worst off than what it was because they knew God didn't about didn't knew God was calling them I didn't respond to it they knew God was calling don't be like that tonight amen praise the Lord you crazy ass tease I'm ready to come in lost woman the third chapter in the twelfth verse I know there is no good in them I know that there's no good enough for a man to rejoice and to do good in his life you get why you got to change please ask these the preacher see it's no good in this world but me got an opportunity to do good do good see there's no good out here know we're falling apart but when God look you your opportunity to do what's right to do good do good that's showing the right thing you got some God left inside you you got some a little bit of garlic and you do get see all right look another script let's go to Ecclesiastes 11 I'm read this once a quarter that's right here that brand upon the water whether I find it after many days give a portion to seven also to earth to eight but our nose not why the evil shall be upon the earth see he was out there when you do good that keeps the Eve off of you that were you got to do good you know what you evil can come you know God I have mercy upon you just for doing you see if you give a cup of cold water one of these my children gives you another lose your reward in heaven sea so do good see and the evil as out there it's gonna affect every one of us then I must exempt from evil coming in our life when we living for God and do much right you know God wholly evil back off about the Bible said God please I hate around Joe drove had a hedge about him and God only let the devil come in jobs life they show the devil it drove was a real Christian that's our God let the devil come on Joe you proved to the devil the door wouldn't save him golfing are never called God was blessing him and because God was doing what he was doing cookie with the richest man in the land no God Joel was serving God because he loved the Lord see no matter what Joel went through the devil's a here crashed it to your face take all the God no Jordan curse God he loved the Lord more he held on to the Lord he didn't curse so evil comes in our life and sometime it's all the time it's just a trial at the Lord Lytton come yet to see but we add and I won't sell well we really love the Lord or not some people follow Jesus for the loaves in the bridge Jesus say if you're talking you can keep up because you're hungry come because of the lows from the break it they come Holly called the blessing was flowing down one of the blessings stop this stop see so you gotta follow the law because you love you not because he's blessing you but because you're loved with the devil can use that against really trying to do against job you gotta use the blessings of God against job to say God here crush it to your fears his touch what he got take all the stuff from him take his children from I guarantee you're crushing to the face God turned to go ahead on a man who's oh I paid the Lord knows what confidence guard got inside Joe notice the car for there you know what God got that same confidence in me and you demagogue let the devil loose on us he got the confident analogy at and Joe they do whatever you want do Chum he's still gonna love you enhance it's still gonna serve him and do what you got to do they're gonna serve me because they love me and Jobe loved the Lord see it meant God came and did their phone so I try to summarize this by the grace of God the rich man's plea he lost his opportunity and wait to God inhale they try to find mercy trying to find water trying to find somebody to help him now but now it was too late you had the opportunity to tell your family about the Lord don't wait to it's too late your brothers and your sisters you're covering them in no excuse for you not to tell them about the Lord even if they don't listen to you they know what kind of life you live my sister's damn didn't know what kind of life I live you know I'm a Christian and they respect me for that do I try to encourage them to go to church and stuff like that I most certainly do cuz I'm gonna be guilty on me that I never told them about the Lord see why you got the opportunity to tell your family this man right here he was he getting hail if he go on my brothers you know come to this place why he didn't do when you throw on earth you have plenty of opportunity yeah plenty of chance to tell your family about the laws they don't have to go to hell clean opportunity but you didn't do it his rich man here he wished to get inhale they're trying to warn his brothers it's too late you can't wait to death strike you don't want to try to get everything right you got a game thing right before death come a man guard game hit the card a chance see man send Isaiah's tenth eye house in order for thou shalt die and not live that's right so I'll give an opportunity to get things right he did the right thing you begin to pray you begin to cry to the Lord in the Lord spirit his life gave him 15 more years but it didn't work often so good didn't work out too good sometime the law say your time to go it's time to go Amen so we thank the Lord the rich man's plea make you plead to the Lord now please like a prayer make your plea 9 you guys tell you what the Lord do for us the time not an axe it's time down to make your requests known to the Lord you want God to do something to you do it accent now then once you get down you are now a man make your requests known to the law ask the Lord to bless the Lord to help you have to log the screech that the Lord give you the grace to do what's right acts from now don't wait till you get down did you can't do nothing else rich man you waited too late you chose the wrong time in the wrong place that's for what he wanted because he was in the wrong place you can get it it was a Gulf about there was a gulf fixed between him and heaven you got a bridge between hell and heaven right now it's a bridge it's called a blood of Jesus it spans the bridge between heaven and hell cuz you don't have to go there but now if you're going on there there's a gulf there that you can't get over to the other side the gulf neither can we go back to your side I want to go back to the side I want stay on the Lord's side so why you got a chain you got a chance now you get over the other side I might if you go to hell you can't get over he can't get over it's too late so gave a great gulf there we can't come back there's bar here some what a prayer Lord Jesus Christ we just thank you for your words those simple message Lord the rich man's plea Lord he plead Lord he did round his life he had opportunity to step eternal life but Lord he turned her down

conversation we had with him prior to our coming I know the law was directly talking to him and others one thing about my brother night I said for sure you you make your calling and election sure if you have any doubt or anything inkling on on whether the Holy Ghost is there or not you need to make sure you make sure you know you can have it but just like I told him the Holy Ghost will never be in you without manifesting itself it's like a woman with a baby she might be impregnated but that baby is going to grow as long as you feed it it's gonna grow and it's gonna manifest the life in you that's how the Holy Ghost is if he will manifest himself in you and so it's just a real blessing to me and my brother [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] surely God is good to us [Music] [Music]
