[Applause] amen how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord amen amen let us remember keep on to keep on praying for our pastor I believe he is in uh Liberia they're having special meetings and he's supposed to get back here end of this week I found last minute so let us keep on remembering him in prayer amen but it's just ball heads before we read the words we approach it from the grace of Mercy this morning thanking you and appreciating you for bringing us in your house knowing that your word never fails and you are here to meet us you said wherever two or three are gathered in my name you said I will be there in there and we can feel your presence in this place and we know you are already here foreign fast [Music] yeah man you can take your seats for a while for one Momo amen amen this morning I want to speak on Earth subject called when all hope is lost amen hope is lost Jesus that's when he comes on the side for his for his subtitle want to speak on for his glory how many have ever come to a point in their life and they've reached the end of the road and you have no way to go even if you have cried all you can until you can cry no more but you remember how you got out God came on the scene when all hope was gone how many have come to a point you have given up need completes more the situation looks hopeless that La situation but you know that you got out remember because God came on the scene when you're hoping you don't understand how many have been discouraged they say Lord I believe I believe your words but I just don't know anymore I don't know how to keep on going to say but yes I believe the word but all my energy is sin when your Hope was gone because that's what he does he is Jehovah he is Jehovah Rapha yeah and you have no words to prayer all you can just say is Lord help me how many ever come to a point I said Lord I don't know what to do parade all I can is but I don't know that's when he steps in comes on just right on time how many have come to a point in time say Lord I'm holding on to your words just feel like letting go you feel like I'm done I'm just gonna let go I won't do it but you know why you're still holding on to them because God came to your arrest because when he wants to show his glory amen amen that is listed upon our feet to the Book of John 11. John 11 chapter 1. John chapter 11 verse 1 the Bible reads jean-shapita is now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister Martha the Bethany Village therefore verse 3 says therefore his sister sent unto him saying Lord behold he who whom thou lovest is sick we see Mary and Martha we're calling for Jesus had fallen ill no friend I did and it was real bad but they had seen the Miracles that Jesus had done Jesus and then you they called him on the scene he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby I thank you refuse to Joshua Glory theater we may take our seats when we are looking here Jesus said this sickness is not unto death but we all know that Lazarus died after remember this was a prophetic speech that this sickness that Lazarus has because it's not for for it to kill him but it's for God to get the glory that the Son of God might be glorified through that sickness Son of God might be glorified through that day so God allowed that situation God allowed Lazarus to die so that his glory might be shown so that the Son of God might be glorified God allowed you to go through your situations not for you to suffer not for you to die but he allowed you to go through it foreign oh it's not dying you're just changing Dimensions so when the word of God says the sickness is not unto death it's not a lie it is true it is for His glory so whatever trial you are going hello it is not going to kill you whatever tribulation you are going with reports because he is allowed it so that the Son of God might be glorious you look at job work out there God allowed him to go through those tribulations it was not for job to Suffer City together so I'm here to tell you this morning I do not know what it is just say basketball but you know what it is God knows what it is you're sexing whatever that is for God to get glorious he is coming to deliver us he'll raise the Lazarus he can raise YouTube if you open the blind eyes you can open your eyes if you heal diabetes if he healed blood pressure he can heal you too he is allowing you to go through that is for himself in John chapter 9 Earth as Jesus was walking with his disciples they saw a blind man he's over here John chapter 9 verse 1 says Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his death and his disciples asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind Jesus answered neither had this man sinned no his parents but that the works of God should be made to manifested his predicament see his it was not because his parents did something wrong allowed him to be born blind he can open his eyes and he gets the glory whatever predicament you are in prayer I have a trial situations it is for God together many people like to judge a lot they say he's going through that because he sinned basketball that is happening because he did something wrong we're already passing judgment and we saw him you can't do this because you did that basketball who are you to judge hey man amen that is not the situation that is not the case you're going through what you were going through passive person situation so that God can get the glory the darker the night it's so lighter the morning is gone Lazarus was only sick and he was healed we were gonna be talking about a healing testimony healing testimony but we are not talking about a healing testimony we're talking about a resurrection because the darker the situation the greater the testimony is the deeper you are in trouble but God depression is not going to kill you depression is not going to destroy you're going to come out with peace God is coming to deliver you cancer is not going to come so he's gonna take you out of there people not going to destroy you yes you will not remain Barren forever God will come to heal you did it for Sarah the end result is for God to get the glory not to anyone else but for himself so he said Lazarus is sick so that I get the glory your condition is not going to make you suffer he's going to get the Glory by delivering you he says I know the plans that I have for you not plans for you not to suffer Pat the problem but plans for you to prosper man in each and every aspect Obama God wants to use me you and me for his glory because it all belongs to him we all know of Abraham when Abraham was called out of the land of the heathens the heathens were worshiping multiple gods if you use the word god it could mean anything with the juice but God wanted to establish himself and then he called out Abraham why did he call Abraham God was establishing his own identity and he raised him up and he said you are going to be a father of Nations and that those Nations we're going to be called God's people so happiness So when you say God people don't get confused you're not going to assume you're talking about his son you're talking about a moon God but when you say the god of Abraham they will know you're talking about yourself so God was using Abraham for his glory hello God gave Abraham a son after 25 years so when people are talking about it that's the god of Abraham there wouldn't be any confusion because he is the only Mighty God he is the only mighty warrior so God wanted to use Abraham to East establish himself poor sisterly and remap how many are tired to say Lord I'm tired of using you come here not to vote for some particular deal send you investigate the the the utilizing you are just you you're in a relationship with God but you are just using God Lord I'm sick he heals you conversation Lord I'm in need of this he comes every person they say he gives it to you if you don't there's nothing wrong with that he wants to do it very fast but it's time for now man yes you've got to use your name so when people look at you they can say that is the god of Brothers what God is using your mind give himself Glory so when he raised Abraham when people were talking about how Mighty Abraham that's why when the children of Israel were praying foreign Rachel was also Barren for 14 years so when you say the god of Abraham the god of Jacob you are calling him to do what he did before and he can come and he stand and says I did that all right it is all for his glory when we talk about Gideon overcoming we're going to happen when we talk about the Jericho walls falling so when you are in a situation and you cannot see a way out God wants to get Glory from you and after that he can say you see my son men do not walk into lions [Applause] they know [Applause] [Applause] this woman you see my [Applause] [Applause] for you foreign whatever you were going through it is for His glory whatever trial you are in but yeah for him to gather Glory anxiety anxiety you don't know what's going on he was together cancer has no power because we serve a Mighty Warriors diabetes has no power over you there is no sin that has power over God can break those chains anointing of the almighty god um God is in this place this morning so if you calling him say Lord I don't want to walk in your prayers are the same way that occasions he can break that bondage he can break those chains because he wants to get the glory out of it when people are talking about the God of Israeli the Judy's Nations started shaking because they heard what God had done he's on don't you think he delivered God he delivered his children from a superpower either in bondage for 400 years God did not allow them to be in bonded for only 20 years [Music] because no one would fear people who are coming out of bodies for only 20 years but no one would fear people who just came out of bondage but because they've been under under Pharaoh baskets in that time Egypt was the superpower but God came and delivered he took them out of it is for him to get the glory that's why when they were walking out going towards Canaan coming back now people we came we're coming to make treaties with them please don't fight us because they knew that was the god of Abraham Isaac God of Jacob you're the sack up God did that Jew Lafayette he wants to gather glory for me amen amen in John chapter 11 verse 5. it says now Jesus loved mother hello and her sister and Lazarus is when he heard therefore that he was sick he about two days still in then after that he said to his disciples let us go into Judea again he was living the situation to get worse if molecular situation some P because if he was just going to heal Lazarus that was going to be one of the many healing testimonies in letting off the pressure don't a message [Music] the prophet says when her brother was dead a mountain she sent for Jesus and instead of coming here he went away party she sent again he went further and I asked him again and he goes further foreign worse and all that situations how many have ever been there you are sick you pray you have a prayer situation gets worse it looks like God has turned his battery he says he comes to you he's not even answering your prayers and it looks like he is further it says you have depression depression anxiety you have fear Lord help me that's your prayer day and night but he just seems like he's going first how many have ever been there but when God is going further McCone he wants to magnify magnificent when he is going away he's not he's not forsaking you innovus he's waiting for that right time come and take you out of it so you can know that for sure this is not a mistake for sure it is God who took me out because when he comes nothing stays the same okay he said I'm the resurrection Jairus daughter was dead but when Jesus came on the scene because he was alive she was resurrected situation this morning hello foreign [Music] Jesus speak to them plainly man and said Lazarus is dead he is gone gone that's when he said now let us go since it is now time for my glory to me so Jesus and his disciples are two different perspectives [Music] looking at the same situation but they perceived a difference when Jesus was looking at Lazarus deaths were looking at Lazarus they had a different perspective and the other time we talked about perspective a lot of functions perspective is what you see the first one after you see [Music] that's his perspective the young boy seated over there he can see my left side he can only see my right side he has a different perspective when he looks at me I'm not wearing him I don't have a microphone because from where you see that he's blinded he can't see it but from this side where brother Keith is he can see it because of where he is so your perspective how you see things determined by how you where you are so Jesus was seated in a different place from where the disciples were seated Jesus was sitting in Heavenly places were Seated on Earthly places that's why they could not see come from I'm up higher the holy people get into the Heavenly places you will start seeing your problems as testimonies you will start seeing your dad's situations on the scene and say Lord speak it will happen verse 17 says verses when Jesus came he found that he had laid in the grave for four days Lazarus was already in the grave for four days the situation was hopeless that situation was saying Lord please come and heal him they lost hope is put him in the grave hola they sealed him in hola family and say the Lazarus is done but God has Jesus has spoken a word Jesus my brother had not died she was Believing on Jesus say Lord you should have come back then but now he's dead he hopes we're gone but then she said but I know my energy measure said that even now Commandments no whatever you ask of the Lord God will give it these do I have someone this morning who still has faith and say whatever the situation God I know you can work a miracle in my life it doesn't matter how sick I am even now meant no I know you can still do it there and then Martha say that he was believing believing is the atmosphere that faith can work in atmosphere that's why in The Prophet's Ministry his theme was only believes it's that atmosphere says that makes all things possible so when you have that Faith Allah and you say I don't care what it looks like it's even now man no even this morning it might be four days later no I don't know how long your four days straight back come on come here your four days might have been two weeks might have been one month your four days might have been five years your four days might have been ten years but this morning just stand in your feet and say message no oh it looks so blessing oh God looks like it's done even now I know you can do it for me and God is able to do it it doesn't matter how hopeless because God wants to gather Glory it's all for his glory he wants to say I did that with a mighty hander yeah of a mighty conqueror he will smash you out of the arms of death he will run away that stone if I will do it it doesn't matter how much longer you've been gone God's hand is able to reach out and take you back hey man amen mother said no I still believe it Satan tries to bring discouragement to us and say look at all that you think you're gonna make it out just say I don't care even now man no God can still do it God did that before he can still do it man no so you gotta hold on to God's word like your life depends on it come on so hold on and stand on it I said Lord even this morning do it for me because you get the Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah the prophet of God in God's covenant he says he was talking about Jesus and Satan wouldn't say Jesus was being tempted he says easy and Jesus said to Satan it is also written and Jesus Took the father's word and defeated Satan right on his eyes you can look at the slide over here what did he do he was proving to the weakest of Christians that you can defeat Satan anyway the plain word of God just take it and say that says the Lord that the sickness is not going to take me but it is for His glory stand on that word stand on it today Lord this is for your glory and he will take you out of it verse the Bible said when he saw Lazarus friends and family crying he was touched by that feeling his son's friend was gone although Jesus was God he was not afraid to accept what he was feeling more Jesus was God Jesus and he was man either he was not 50 God 250 man because that would be unfair he is 50 God and 50 man see lessons you cannot feel everything that you feel sorry that's why he could feel the pain why he cried when he said because he was man but he was not man only man he was also God so Jesus is man enough God enough to not leave you in that situation so he was man enough to cry because his friend was gone but he was God enough the man he was working with for three years his disciples he was working for three years they rejected him when the time he needed them the most they say I don't know that man seen him in my life he knows the pain of rejection God says I know when you feel sick foreign [Applause] in my life I invite you to my situation invite you to my condition you are the only one who can deliver me call him on the scene and
