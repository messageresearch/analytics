surely the Lord is worthy we appreciate everybody being out of the house out to the house of the Lord tonight it god is so good to us a man we just I know we had had the things of God you may be seated just for a moment we had you praying for sister Zaius but anyway we talked about giving it a oxygen water instead but anyway she passed on Saturday and they have her funeral on Saturday down in South Carolina a close friend of mine just died on last week as well so it seems as though I've had about three people close friends you guys remember brother Samuel feels he died about a month ago and I just got the report from England yes he died inez son just called me and told me I said did you go yes brother forgive me I would have come I want to try to anyway but anyhow I wasn't the will of the Lord for me to go I just felt bad because I would have loved to try to encourage her his wife she's a beautiful sister but anyhow it just seems like things are happening now a couple of deaths were did take place down in in Iowa City as well but you know when you one person you can't be it everywhere so we love the Lord we thank God for His goodness and you know I just want to say that people of God we are in a dangerous time in a time where we must recognize as a dangerous time Satan is very busy and it is his job he does he a really good job yeah like the sisters say he's a good adversary but he's only working according to God's plan that's the thing that I really appreciate God for because Satan can't do us those who are chosen and elected by God he can't do us any harm hallelujah once you have come into Christ you have passed from death unto life as we stand let us have take two passes of Scripture I've just been thinking about this a lot and I don't know it's just I just want God to have preeminence tonight thank you brother and I apologize for my wife not being here but she really really was really tired tonight and her days are very full and packed some of us may not know but she has to keep Chicanos children during the day plus do homeschool with Esther and then and she's got a little Maya there to pray for her Isaiah 1:18 Romans 8:31 I trust by God's grace that will bless tonight this message may be simple but it's powerful to me Isaiah 1:18 come and let us reason together saith the LORD though be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow and though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool Romans 8:31 what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us Heavenly Father we come before your Lord we thank you for your amazing grace Lord you're so good to us we thank you for everything we thank you for the times that you allow us to stand we thank you for the times you allow us to fall we thank you for the times that you allow us to get up from the fall because we realize Lord Jesus that all things work together for the good of them that love you and those who are called according to your calling father we realize Lord Jesus that there is total victory in you there is no failure in you you're the only one Lord that have lived a perfect life but by your grace we are accepted in your beloved son Christ Jesus we thank you for your glory we thank you for your goodness and we pray father God that you have preeminence here this evening in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated when reading this should I think I when the last time I preached I kind of mentioned it before something or I've been talking to someone I have not seen it in the way that I've seen it before I was thinking about the way we were and I am so grateful to God that he's the only one that could make it so my subject would be the blood that washes away my sins we talk about the blood a lot and it took us a profit to Dhin tell us that the blood and the life of the blood are two different things because II if I had a cruise of Jesus blood in my hand it would do me no good because all that I would I would be holding in my hand would be only the chemistry of it but there's a difference between the chemistry of the blood and the life of the blood when I thought about the blood the blood fixes everything doesn't matter how broken it is doesn't matter how dirty it is it doesn't matter amen if it's been lost a hundred years or 90 years and you get save all 90 woman the blood takes whatever sin you've ever committed and dispels it to a place where there is no evidence that it ever existed God did it I couldn't have done it you couldn't have done it but God did it when we confess our sins we trust that the blood would cleanse us because the Bible said if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all our unrighteousness but understand when the blood cleanses you he doesn't leave a stain it is totally annihilated or gotten rid of once it's confessed and placed under the blood there is no evidence that you ever did what you did and that's why brother Branham tells us that when God justifies us it is by the blood he can justify us and that justification is in a way you've never seen before you never did it because there is no evidence we said what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus nemanja we're not talking about the chemistry we're literally talking about the life I thought about it I said you know we talk about the blood veil because understand the veil is there is the chemistry but behind the chemistry in that chemistry was a life in that life was God's life in the law the Misses law he says you know what the blood of Christ does too to confess sins you women could you imagine having a wash table full of bleach and take that little eyedropper full of ink and you drop it this ink down into the wash trough full of bleach what happens to the ink the ink becomes bleach what happened it doesn't hurt the bleach a bit it just takes on and becomes bleach that's what confess sin does when is confessed upon the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ it changes color and becomes righteousness for you willing to acknowledge it and accept God provided way for you to be saved there's nothing like it friends T and that's the privilege that we have because of the blood of Jesus I don't think we preach enough on the blood because we get into this element where we think omit our righteousnesses of ourselves but remember that the righteousness that we are we have is of God and God alone God is the only one that could really produce righteousness our righteousness as the scripture said is like filthy rags understand this that without the blood because of sin there was been no way that you and I could ever be united to with God again I'm gonna say that again there was a time that that man was United with God whatever God thought he thought it whatever God wanted him to do he did it they were in such harmony there was in such a union because it was so because Adam had God spirit that right Adam Amen did not bypass his theophany he knew but because of sin something was separated but when he was in that body that was to last and live forever he knew and had the mind of God there was a union there was a Holy Spirit but when the breach came because of the way King God required blood ha because life is in the blood ah you see that's why when it came to the goats and it came to the sheets and when it came to the pigeons think it lives a consecrated life if I want to say it like this it was their nature that God was pleased with at the farm animals changed the lion became vicious the tiger vicious the bear became vicious man became vicious and the only way that God could could could could cover his anger I'll put this way God could judge this thing he had to give them a substitute and that substitute was to sacrifice our innocent lamb thank God God became the innocent lamb because the natural lamb though he was innocent his life was not compatible with man his life could not come into a man the blood could not mix you could never put a lambs blood in a man and expect him to live so God had to create a blood he had to create a man he had to create a lamb in the image of a man hallelujah and in that lamb that lamb had to have a special kind of blood and that blood was the kind of blood that blood within that blood it was the kind that could heal that that in that lamb a meant there was qualities he meant that that was in that lamb that was able to literally erase a man's old life and give him a new one is that what the Bible says if we are in Christ the Bible said we are a new creature in Christ all things have passed away God has gotten rid of the old things behold everything else has become new there's a process to salvation brother let me put it like this he said like the sinner comes in and listen to the gospel he began to realize condemnation he's a sinner he realized that in the water separation is the Scarlet someone died for him an innocent substitute to bring him into fellowship in relationship with God again he realized that he's out of the way by preaching of the word I say the gospel yet it is its simplicity preached in the power of the blood is the greatest drawing card the world has ever known but people don't preach it anymore it's all fashion but when you can tell a man there is a blood there is a cure there is a solution to your problem and God is able to wash you whiter than snow really wash you whiter than snow he can literally get rid of all of your sins your mama says your daddy and everybody else who have seen if you only believe God can choix shooo whiter than snow what a drawing card if the drunkards could really know that there is a power hallelujah that can change their whole entire life and bring them smacking new think about it how that blood is able to do that this is why I said don't don't just drop a few drops Lord let me plunge beneath the flood wash me clean is that what the Bible says Lord wash me I believe us I said wash me clean there is a life they can take us back to the beginning they can literally treat change you and transform you to one day you'll find yourself in a place that never knew seen God is trying to perform in his church and the church is trying to perform by Creed's and to can't work together you got to get rid of the Creed and get Christ here how can you do it when he sees the blood when the blood has been applied with the sincere heart and I had lead upon Jesus Christ in a heart that's true before God to confess his role and be born of the Holy Spirit then the works of God would follow as he said it would do yeah the church want to perform through their crease and see how many members they can get God wants to perform through the power of the blood to get Christians born again see if we can really take on the blood God can give us a full justification if we really take on the blood it is the blood that was sanctify you hallelujah it is the bleach that sanctifies the ink is that right the eat does nothing it is the bleach that breaks the ink up it is the Holy Spirit is a God is a blood in that the life in that blood that does it does work it is God's working if it's really the blood it is the blood that brings you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord it is the blood that brings you to a healing it is the blood that brings you to a deliverance not you but you got to realize what's behind the blood I'll tell you God it was when he Jesus stood there at the bank of the Jordan River and the pillar of fire came down like a dove and that Holy Spirit says I am well pleased to dwell in you it was God's light that was dwelling in that body hallelujah but you gotta understand when Jesus laid handle to shake it wasn't the lid that him it was the blood it was gone in the blood it was God behind the veil that ride could Jesus said I can't do nothing except my father showed me brother Branham said Jesus never hear one person it was God in him doing the healing hallelujah is that right I want what scripture that is I think is in Jeremiah one of those scriptures I can't recall I'm Intertek put it down but I didn't he says Lord everything we we give to you you gave it to us everything is yours how can we both the bride there's no postie there's no raggedy also what if I can say him you can't I didn't give me this voice he gave me this voice hallelujah oh there's no boasting there's no bragging the Lucifer should have known that everything he had God gave it to him so God has a right to take it from him no boasting in each or ability it's God's ability hallelujah it's like the same once now it might be Randi other might be white or yellow why came bowls against the other one they didn't give themselves that the same Sun Shine on the same flower and yet God has determined what color it should be he said oh if we could understand that the life of the blood we sing you know this power in the blood Allu power in the chemistry power in the blood that same power was released on the day of Pentecost the very life of God and that life amen it's for every true believer have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe hallelujah right justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and then brother Brennan said it brings a big srew for the Holy Ghost himself the very person Oh y'all hear what I'm saying not just a little bit of him but the very first son Jesus hallelujah y'all understand me when he said the very person that means the fullness of the person it's now in you O God's divine nature that all right this in the beginning when the world had his birth when God pulled back the water first off the earth like he did the waters from the mother's womb there was a world born yes and people began to live on it when God put them on there and then they began to sin and it was baptized by immersing in the days of Noah then it was sanctified by the blood of the creator dropping upon it and now that oh holy holy the blood dropped in Jerusalem on Calvary the blood dropped the blood dropped and it's sanctified the whole world hallelujah that's powerful happy dust of the earth was sanctified when the blood of Jesus TRUCKING hallelujah Wow understand me oh well but the blood was dropped in Jerusalem you know what Jerusalem meaning here in Hebrew city of peace who God brought peace in Jerusalem and that peace read throughout the whole Wow that's just the way the gospel spread one drop in the world or the earth was never the same whoo now do that we come through justification to believe God you were baptized unto repentance or to remission of your sin you confess your sins before God he forgave you for it and you were baptized to show that you have been you have been forgiven confessing to the people showing to the world that you believe that Jesus Christ died for you he took your place and now you stand in his place he become you that you might become him hallelujah see that's what I'm trying to say the blood took your place think about it it wasn't the chemistry it was God fail behind that blood that literally took your place talking about a perfect substitute well a perfect example of divine love hallelujah like brother said when Adam and Eve fell it was God Himself that walked through the cool of the evening he was the one that came to fix the problem hallelujah oh is that all right then the sanctifying power of God cleanses all the habits out of your life well let me say it again you got some habits let the blood work let God come in and clear all of those bad habits out of your life you used to smoke drink do things that wasn't right tell lies everything then the sanctifying power of the blood of Jesus Christ if that blood and sanctifying you you better get the real one hallelujah because I don't know no bleach a no ink that can stand against real bleach hallelujah he was the real bleach it's going to disperse that ink hallelujah - you can't see it no law if it's a real king it was a real blood is gone sanctify you hallelujah then that's it the blood has sanctifying power its power in the blood to sanctify you to sanctify me that's why we come fast that's why we say Lord forgive me that's why we said Lord deliver me that's why we say God I want to be like you so the sanctifying power the blood will come and sanctify us and clears us to make us right for heaven whew in the sanctifying power the blood of Jesus Christ comes into your life and takes all the things away from you if you happen to say something not wrong quickly say wait a minute pardon me I didn't mean to say it like that see that's the devil got a trap set there but you've got to grace to come back if you are real Christian hallelujah you got the grace to come back if you are real did you know don't you know God sets you in a trap he always said traps for you see how well you're going to come out of it hallelujah I can go down I can go down the line to show you where God and trap people see god knows what they going into and gotta let him go right on into already why cuz God loves it he loves the glory of it he loves the praise of it he loves to see his people overcome how by his blood he goes on to say when the millennia is over God is going to give a world the world a baptism of fire it's going to blow the whole thing up the heaven and the earth will be on fire Peter says so and the thing will have a baptism of fire innovation of the whole thing and then there'll be a new heaven and a new earth see then when when then that's when we're weird well righteousness that's where we are see we have become from mortal beings from time beings to eternal beings when the Word of God is in our soul and we become sons and daughters of God with the attributes the gene of God in us to be sons and daughters of the father God in heaven crying I'm a father my God my God in my father's house you understand me oh I can't explain this but I say it like this every y'all heard me talk about communion that's to me I see a great revelation in that loaf of bread in that loaf of bread I see God and when God breaks up those feet pieces I still see God but the difference is that I see God take on an identity of persons but one person fragmented one body one people hallelujah made out of the same stuff sister you can't be eternal unless you're part of eternity you've got to be a part of eternity that's what this message came to do I did defy us and where we came from why we in this Jam and widely why we in this mess I love God you know what I don't know the Bible even don't even tell us where Adam was when he messed up but you think God didn't know it God set the trap he allowed it to happen he knew he was going to fall that was his whole program he saw it before it happened but he also fixed it before it happened hallelujah because the Bible said he put our names in the lamb look alive before the foundation of the world in order for him to be just he had to fix it hallelujah see we talked about eternal gods or the turn of God who created blood to live in oh not just any blood it wasn't part of Mary and it wasn't part of Joseph now we're getting ready the world is getting ready to celebrate Christmas now they're coming to realize that Christmas was not in December everybody's coming to know the truth it ain't gonna stop because the truth of the matter is you're dealing with a spirit they a worship so they go continued 25th of December they may even go be become more lavish with with a way of worship you just never know what they're gonna do but you know anybody with their right mind know that if the shepherds were abiding in the field they weren't in the snow and if there was animals in that pen they had hay and I believe Jesus would have had a little bit more clothing than swaddling so you and I must realize that the world got it all mixed up look at history look when a lamb can only be born in the spring that's true now how far one of people want to go that they say well you know the Prophet did and I said well I don't know why you did it but my conscience won't let me y'all can do what you want to do it justified any way you'd like to but in my soul I think I'll stay with what I understand cuz if you don't do something with faith it's sin anyway if it's not a revelation it's sin anyway and we are not supposed to follow the traditions of a prophet it is the word he's bringing oh I got a powerful quote yeah I'm gonna use it it's coming whether it's gonna help people are dying I don't know but I'm gonna tell you something the bride of Jesus Christ will be without spot wrinkle or blemish that's right she's not going to be an odd dollar to worship her and expect to make heaven idols out out out is that right look in the scripture every time Israel had to cross over they had to sanctify themselves they had to get rid of everything everything before they cross over and before you cross over whether by rapture or death you're gonna have to have everything out it's a truth sometime my bride now if you're gonna be bride everything got to be going that's the power of the blood so there's no excuse I couldn't do it if the power of the blood is there that's the power of the blood will bring you to that revelations welcome father unto him that loveth us loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood the word wash is actually loosed loosed us from our sins in his own blood isn't that wonderful but we are but you what are you spiritually minded did you catch it it was his own blood that loosed us completely from our sin you saw what do you mean brother words let me say it like this if you justified you can still sing if you're sanctified you can still see it even if you've been baptized with the Holy Ghost you can still sin but when the person of Jesus Christ comes into you he said you can neither be barren nor can you fall why cuz you did you rot it you're not even gasps you're not alive you are not alive that's what Paul said it is not on that limb but Christ Christ that live how can I see the from day know his cries that live he's seeing through my eyes he's hearing through my ears he's speaking through my lips he's praising through my mouth I'm doing nothing but watching him use my body did you watch did you catch it it was his own blood that loosed us completely from our sins it was not human blood it was the blood of God Peter called it the blood of Christ Paul called it the blood of the Lord and the blood of Jesus not three persons but one blood one person there is that revelation again one God that omnipotent Jehovah God came down and made himself a body by means of the virgin birth and in dwell it and that it might be the blood of God that would free us loose us entirely from our sins and present us spotless before himself with exceedingly great joy hallelujah you said what do you mean brother if that's what people don't understand that portion of adoption will come and it will totally bring you to a perfect place of perfection we are different creature this age is different from all the others we have a higher calling and I'm calling it to be the real reflection of Jesus Christ hallelujah all of his bone and flesh of his flesh he's mine let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus we've got to be different but the blood power the power of the blood is loved and able to present you faultless go present you faultless it Fox Oh God it works the things I used to do I don't do them all the praises I used to go I don't go no more hallelujah I'm not what I ought to be all right it goes I'm not what I used to be I'm not what I want out to be wanna be I ought to be y'all know how it goes I never can get this straight but brother madam says just because of that gave that testimony and that was proof that she passed from death unto life she's all the journey and every believer that's been watching the blood is on a journey hallelujah the church the body of Christ is us own body you said what do you mean that's why brother Branham says now the bride of Jesus Christ basically she comes he gets to a place where God gives her a blood transfusion a blood transfusion that means no longer blood if it's no more your blood that means you don't have to be sick there's no sickness in the blood of Jesus everything that's in this that's the only way you're not gonna strike will see rapture because the blood the power of the blood will quicken this body and bring it to an important allottee that's the only way and if you don't let the blood have his way you're gonna be in trouble hmm what do you mean Israel would justify Amen when they put the blood on the doorpost of their little that was just the chemistry and then they were baptized by Moses in the in the in the Red Sea but they didn't let the blood continue they got out there murmuring complaining and of God and fussing and fighting and not nothing could please them but see one thing about the blood you got to submit to it hallelujah when the power the blood is there is there to bring life to you to change your life did you hear what I said in the beginning it is able to switch everything to change all these years of sin into nothing it is the net the thing that could bring nothing to nothing hallelujah it is a thing that could take away all your guilt all your sin all your shame Oh tell me about it Rahab can tell you about it if she was here she could tell you I was a streetwalker I was a prostitute hallelujah but I've heard about God I heard about what he did they took the blood and put the dope on placing on the dope was in the little I don't know him but whatever he is I hope he's seen me somehow over here in Jericho hallelujah you don't think so that was a deep call to the deep is that right because we have said we have heard 40 years ago I heard about it still believe no God is God when you destroy Jericho have mercy on me hallelujah and those sponsors okay take that red ribbon take that rope and hang it out the window so now if you don't do what we tell you if you don't follow the instructions if you don't apply the blood if you don't apply the token we're not guilty if you get killed in the matter hallelujah and real houses all not just me but my family is well hallelujah time me and my family well you better put that token out there because when I see the Blood I pass over you it's no more the chemistry let me share like this when I see the life of Christ I will pass over you Oh Lord of God I wonder if you note the salutation of the first age and when those windin then notes that one to this age just put them together these things says he that holds the seven stars in his right hand and walketh in the midst of the churches these things says there first and the last watch was which was dead and is alive this is a one and the same person and he is letting us know that the church is his as the seed of the fruit is in the midst of the fruit so is he the Royal seed in the midst of the charge and as the seed alone has life in it so is he the author of life to the church his walking signifies his his son Turing care for it he is the chief shepherd watching over his room that is his right for he bought that church with his own blood that blood is the blood of God the one who owns the church is God very God he is the first and the last that title spells eternity he was dead and is alive he paid the price so he was sole owner of the temple of God he rules it whoa he rules it he is worshiped in it he resents anyone taking over his lordship and authority hallelujah no doubt the reason he introduced himself to each age as deity is to warn and comfort the people he warns the false vine and he comforts the true vine this is the only true Almighty God hear him hallelujah is life it's the blood it's the power hallelujah it transforms how to do it it changes everything that it touches hallelujah you hear me you know what I tell you what I don't know where the donkey's can talk but that one that rode Jesus on his back I'm sure he felt pretty good that's proud was the only person ever rolled him and he never felt a burden who he had to feel good I heard a preacher says you know he was smiling and grinning so much just somebody had to tell him it ain't about you boy is about the man is riding you hallelujah see sometimes we got to be careful the Holy Ghost me feelings good about you is about the God in you ain't God good to us that blood lives it must live it must live hallelujah and God that life won't live through us that's the whole purpose to show that God has children that's just like him is that right oh my for animal life could not come back upon the human being when the blood was shared the life went out of course because it was a unit and when the life blood was gone from it the life being different from the blood that the blood is the chemistry of the life but the life is something different from the blood but the life is in the blood and the animal's life could not come back upon the worshiper when he shed his blood of the Lamb he had to apply the chemistry because the life was gone and could not come back in that amazing so therefore the sinner could not change there was no change in that what the Bible says all those millions of animals lives given blood shed everywhere sprinkled on the utensil sprinkled on the believer but he could never change the belief because it was just the chemistry it was just a token it was just something that God gave as a substitute to the real thing but the real blood of Jesus one drop of blood will change you through it the man who created the Moon the Stars the heavens that gave you breath that's who I'm talking about that's why there anything too hard for God remember the proper God in Africa doesn't boy was so so I was a default they even had him on a chain hallelujah he was deformed he's all twisted up and everything and here was through an interpreter he heard him and what the healing and things that I was doing and all of a sudden he got faith his brothers got faith and all of a sudden hallelujah that man straightened up and was running everywhere thank you ha was it the prophet of God no that life was beyond him hallelujah you understand me we talk about a presence when God comes in here you understand that's life that's the creative power that means you can get anything from God but the problem is we don't recognize his presence but he comes in here because you can't feel them in case him and see him you think that God is not Ava in the stillness of the night guard performs huh but we got too much Pentecostalism in us we got to feel it you know a thunder gotta come Oh some got a wave of something no sure if I don't feel him his word is still his word his word said I'm healed I'm here I don't have to feel heal I'm here I don't feel it when you your feelings you weight resting on your feelings man feelings become before your faith no faith comes before your feelings that right see the animal had no soul so he couldn't come back on us God had to take someone with a soul and God became the soul of Jesus is that right now I'm not gonna be too much longer but I want to bring this towards people because I want you to understand and then that you and I are now becoming the real what we supposed to have been in the beginning this is what a new birth is all about you get a second chance see the new birth is really not new it's only new here but in the mind of God he saw you that way there you not birth like here there God spoke you and you were there hallelujah it's here you've given birth we call it a new birth because we were born in the Adamic nature without the nature of God we became group beasts we became a relatives to the serpent hallelujah and therefore God said you must be born again if you're going to come back I've got to make a way for you to come back you don't God can change things John God took a little girl by the name of her Desa I often raise my uncle hallelujah nobody newer Polly ever especially in Babylon but then God turn the whole thing around because adesso was special to God she was a chosen vessel she was anointed and appointed I like that to be queen don't you see what I'm saying if you are the vassals of God if you have been appointed and anointed if you have been chosen to be in the New Jerusalem part of it oh hell can't stop you if you have been appointed to make a translation if God has said this one and this one and this one shall not die there be change I don't care what the death eater brings he have no authority over you no that's the power of the blood because the power of the blood is God it's not a second it is it is God Paul say yeah I still gotta struggle I've got to struggle in order to come to perfection you go struggle every woman when giving birth must struggle now they try to undo it by putting him to sleep sometime and giving them a c-section however they do it but after the c-section she gonna struggle she home feel it when all that medication is gone she's going to feel it she might know exact she may not know exactly all about but how body gonna let her know there used to be a baby in you mm-hmm Paul says I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me you can understand what I'm saying tonight I'm trying we always all that power in the blood you know we're saying there's power in God because there's no chemistry that can help you now it's the element that was in the chemistry it was the life that was in the chemistry we're singing about the life of the blood it's where the power here it's not the chemistry hey somebody help me see what I'm saying and if that life is in you then what is it that you cannot do because it's not you it's him in you that's what you say when I see the father work at then I work it to me for I delight in the law of God after the inward man but see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind anybody know what I'm talking about whew every day my mind is at war and I keep saying I'm fighting I'm working I'm fighting oh I'm fighting I'm working because I realized that's the only way I'm gonna make it it is the only way there's this wall or this house is gonna be built I gotta keep fighting and I gotta keep working hmm Paul said o wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver me from this body the body of this death huh hello why did he say the body of this death cuz this body is death see and written hallelujah his death is gonna die God got to come and change this body this ain't the body of life this is the body of death you and I can see that every time we look in the mirror we can know the gray or whatever it is the truth nothing you could do to change it is dying but the inner man cannot die hallelujah Paul said listen if this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved I have one I've got a building whoa may by God is in heaven hallelujah waiting for me that's the one that cannot die that's the one we were supposed to be in before we came to this nasty world hallelujah Oh wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver me from this body of this death that's right who share not what who who who is God hallelujah if you can see I don't care if the devil told you you gonna die that don't mean a thing with God is that right that right listen the message power of God I think was 1955 for the medicine the doctors told him he was going to die because of other of the guns and he said but that God says man what you talking about he said your life just started so no matter what the devil said it was what is what God says is that right remember the little the girl I think the baby that the old couple was in the hospital and-and-and-and and here was the prophet of God a man had prayed for the baby and no couple said praise the Lord God don't heal my baby in that little nurse he said a late third and teens come on says sir in other words I mean she says yes he's dying why would you do that say you know never in the history of of this instrument I'm a as hard as going that long and they come back and and and and brother and said the old fella put his hand on the stone that says honey I understand you you working with the knowledge you have but I'm working with a divine promise honey earth and then in a short time the child was healed halle-loo is not what they say they're not the God of this earth you are it's the God in you that's the god of this earth if you can believe the Bible says whatsoever you ask and believe it you shall have it hey if you can't believe for divine healing how can you have a faith that's gonna translate you the same God the same blood the same power of the blood would transform me we renew my mind cause me to think like him act like him look like him hmm think about it I'm almost done it's God's how I'm a closed on on these two quotes brother well say Satan's power is limited faith power brings to pass God's reveal revelation god help those who cannot act and help themselves now he goes on says God's revealed when God revealed to you that you're gonna be well that your hope that whatever the case might be the devil I don't care if he send your temperature up to the skyrocket or whatever he does to you that means nothing because he's just a liar and the moment he can get you to believe his line report he got you is that right oh brother God said there were so many people who was healing in the first time they had felt a pain oh I must have lost my healing what common stuff is that you base your healing on feelings feelings has nothing to do with what faith produces it's a revelation that God gives you and you walked in that revelation and it has to happen Abraham you're gonna have a child absolutely how come God said so brother Adam you said she was gonna have Joseph it's just Joseph he had Josephine they say no he had his little garden mocked him you know God judged him for that he said I didn't say when she was coming he was coming I just told you he was coming five years after that last baby girl for the five years he had Joseph he said if you God reveals something to you and you believe it no matter how long it takes it has to come to pass you gotta be somebody bride must be revealed to you boom he said listen Satan power is limited faith power brings to pass God's reveal revelation God help those who cannot act and help themselves the old dishonouring God proverbs that said God help those who helps themselves how ridiculous god help those who can't help themselves amen oh it isn't that one of a wonderful the power of God what it does the power of God the only thing that can give eternal life the power of God is the only thing it's the power of God that builds a tree all the science in the world can't build a tree God's power build a tree God's power keep me alive if God calls for you all the hospitals the oxygen tent and all the pool Moto's in the world couldn't keep you here salvation is of the Lord it's God's power that feeds the sparrow is God's power that speaks to the little ducks of the younger there is no body goes up there and shoes him off to the lake and say go on down to Louisiana no sir it's God's power that shoes him off the lake the little fella don't don't know which way to go it's God's power that directs him to the south hallelujah think about it God didn't direct a little geese little sparrow or whatever is he direct the birds what can he do with a people that is filled with his Holy Ghost huh his God's power that God that directs them to Jesus Christ you didn't come to God God came to you is his power that directs you whoa oh I got saved yeah because it was God's power that brought you hallelujah God could have left us all I did sin but his power they think about the millions of people that was lost on the day that he was saved if God's power direct them to the to Jesus Christ it's God's power that brought the wise men to the cradle it's God's power that thrills the souls of every believer amen God's power to help those who cannot help themselves and when you get in a place you can't help yourself that's when God can use his power why why people just let the blood oh I'm saying no the blood didn't come to just save you the blood came to make you whole the God came to make Satan a liar it came to turn around every work of the devil and bring Satan to a shame listen that message I just talked about God's power listen he said this little girl amen these two little girls Amen one was mentally ill and she wanted healing and didn't get a prayer card so they went by where brother Branham stayed and was hoping that some if he came by the shadow of the Prophet would heal them he said that wasn't so make no make-believe faith he heard them crying he went to sea bottom and then that's how the story went anyway look the little girl was healed he had a vision she was healed he wouldn't screaming she shook up the town and everybody began to call him a devil Simon the sorcerer you remember and then he those two men that that he say these two backslidden preachers up in the balcony he started talking about they tried to duck and hi he they know no reason no reason the duck at heart now if i'm simon the sorcerer you come on down here if i'm simon the sorcerer i say but if you're wrong you're die he say they were not doing never came back why because god will fight your battle if you stand on the way truthfully god will fight you that's what the blood does that's the power of god i must stop here come let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as he that can reverse this life the so sinful nasty life that we've had to live y'all don't think it's nasty compare it to the holiness of God you compare your life to the wholeness of God and every one of us deserve hell hello we sit in here by the grace of God and that's by the blood hallelujah and none of us worthy to make heaven not even now hallelujah it's given to you by the blood of Jesus Christ he took your sin any perfect he took your judgment he took your sin I was thinking about that today I said every slap he got that was me I should have gotten when they knocked him when they spit in his face that was me I deserved that it's what I deserve I deserve to be crucified hallelujah let me take some all of us deserve hell in his worst whatever we deserved it when Paul says I was the cheapest of sinners Paul wasn't making up nothing to flatter anybody with Paul knew his liar and he knew what was in his heart see a lot of time we look at people and and what looks on the outside God don't look at that he sees that too but God looks at the heart it is the heart is where God's judgment starts hmm it's the heart I don't care what it looks like to me there's a lot of people that go people don't think that was in heaven oh they go to be and had another come be in heaven but they never got their heart right they won't be there you got to get your heart right and the thing that date that Satan will do to you by way of pride he would keep you from getting your heart right God that blood is there to cleanse that up not to let us stay there say it's a covering God don't cover sin no more God washes it he gets rid of it and that's what the blood of Jesus Christ come to do only the Bible said only the pure heart shall see God let's stay as we raised our hands before you Lord you see us clearly Lord you said even in the dark places it's light to you Lord there's nothing that we can
