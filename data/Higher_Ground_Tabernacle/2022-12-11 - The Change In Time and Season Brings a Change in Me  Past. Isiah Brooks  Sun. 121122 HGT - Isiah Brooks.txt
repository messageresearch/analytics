for us those of us those of you who did pray we saw the results of of the trip or Liberia the trip was long going on and very long coming back but in spite of it all God richly blessed amen they fed me three meals a day lots of food and so I brought some back with me in a different way though but we thank God for the hospitality and um Elijah and his family was uh was great for us they made the trip easy [Music] in all of that I could truly thank God foreign [Music] never forget where you come from David was a sheep David Shepherd one time and God made him a king if your heart is right and you follow God no matter what your conditions are now conditions God is able to make you greater anyway we thank you we did not tell a lot of people we did announce it several times for those of you who didn't know I was leaving just because you didn't make it to church amen so we thank God let us stand foreign [Music] because you don't come to see me you come to hear from God Hallelujah let's turn to Philippians please we're coming from the second chapter Philippines beginning at the fifth verse we write read the fifth and seventh verse and then we'll go to First Corinthians 15 57 and 58. I can't change my text a little bit glad to see everybody here and those of you who haven't seen for a while I'm glad they see you here as we stand let us know Philippians 2 this is pardon me still on a little jet lag woke up around two o'clock this morning [Music] but we do our best this morning to get out of his way or Saltillo so you can use us let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus Christ who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God existence but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men um now let's turn to First Corinthians 15. beginning at the 57th verse but thanks be to God would give us of Victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord foreign [Music] have thine own ways Jesus Christ amen you may be seated there's a lot of things that I like to say but yeah but uh I trust I can get to where God wants me this morning when I got ready to leave to go to Liberia great thoughts came to my heart and mind you haven't gone it was more concerning this assembly but I use those thoughts to Minister there the services went really well one service the altar was practically full service and I I want to minister uh this morning I've talked about it many times but I want you to understand that all of us are changing you will change into being good division or you will change into being more evil the seed that's planted in you will determine what you bring forth but God is so rich in Mercy called he always give us an opportunity to change things is that right so we're coming into a day in time where the seasons are changing people are changing the world in itself is changing and the Bible tells us that evil will get worse but we also know that there's another side to this as evil get worse we know that there's a people that God has designated to be in this time in this season you know citizen to be formed into the very image and likeness of God what for me my question is this morning since you become a Christian how much have you changed you see because if you've been feeding on the word the word will change you can't change yourself but if the word has been quickened if it is alive in you it will change right it's like what brother random said the question was given to him should a man stop quit smoking is because the same Jesus Christ that justifies you if your if your experience is real experience will also sanctify you and if your experience is real experience that same spirit that justifies the same spirit that sanctifies it's the same spirit that will fill you is that right so we know that the message brings change this message has been uh uh desire to be looked upon it's a message from ages disagree it was typed out as the word behind the veils there was only there was a time that only the high priest could go behind the veil and that was once a year but at Calvary the veil was rent and it opened the door for every believer to see Hallelujah the naked word of God hallelujah but let me say it like this what's going behind the veil you will never be the same him Hallelujah this message brings a change I'm gonna keep saying when you come to church it's not how dramatic on dramatic or charismatic the preacher here you come to hear the words some of us have been systematically shaped and formed foreign you know it's okay to say we've had a good word but we want that word to change this is Harvest time you see a little more this is a serious message I'm preaching because I love you I love the people here you see I love the people in Iowa City I just love people and I'm very concerned about the the change or the changes that I'm seeing some changes are good some changes are not but I want to bring to your attention you're changing into something that's nature that is nature right is it right let me say it like this almost all animals anymore when they're little little cubs and things they're not dangerous it could be a lion matter of fact when I went to South Africa there was a lion called Sarah yeah and when she was a cub I I pet her I was close to her she wasn't a threat to me but where she grew up the nature changed her attitude changed and when I saw Sarah that time the last time I wanted Sarah to remain in the cage y'all hear what I'm saying she changed and every animal does believe you me we are beasts without the Holy Ghost Hallelujah when you're young you're cute but then you'll find that cute baby changing and from a cute baby it becomes a brat Hallelujah even the world know you changes I've heard the world called their children call their children little demons Hallelujah and when I hear somebody say hey come on little demons all I could think about is you see um what I'm saying is there's so many influences and if we don't keep our minds steadfast on the words this world is going to change you whether you like it or not I forgot about this I said um there was a brother taking me somewhere in Liberia and I I could tell that he something was missing in his life I still loved on him and you know but as we were going as we were traveling uh you know I told him I said there's no way I could ever drive here it probably would take me years to learn how to maneuver and and this is not this is not I'm not I'm not saying there's looking down at them but I say you guys are ingenious y'all know y'all know how to multitask y'all been multitasking for a long time we're just catching up they had no traffic lights or anything you don't buy the the traffic light thing that blessed me it's because I didn't see no fights disputes I didn't see no great arguments people jumping out of their cars jumping off their scooters no it just seemed like it worked in continuity Hallelujah no I really like that no I'm not saying they don't have those days because one of the one of the brothers uh [Music] curse he began to swear he forgot I was there and so I just turned my head because I knew he was going to look at me I just turned my head and I prayed Lord speak to the man and eventually the brother said brother Brooks I'm sorry Hallelujah that was difficult for him if you had seen the kind of man I was working with that was difficult for him to say I'm sorry but he said I'm sorry and you know what I said to him don't worry about it brother because we all are becoming you are becoming something hello you are becoming something and I preached the day of the tree of knowledge and good and evil organizations and denominations [Music] ignorance he would weak at our ignorance but now that the truth has come Jesus said you either make the tree good oh you make it evil amen hallelujah there is no in between seed you understand me Hallelujah right he said why Satan brings the hybrid seed but that seed can never reproduce its kind message it can never come to a production bringing us back to where we used to be this is Harvest Time this is the time of identification and all of us here this morning need to live deep in our hearts and what we are becoming is if you don't fix the problem it's going to get worse Hallelujah God don't care about what family you were born into like Hallelujah God wants us to change so that you'll understand the question is God call Abraham and yet God made a not made him allowed Abraham to tell Allah and the whole time God was working on Abraham's character but because Abraham lied do you see how it crops up in the generations therefore whatever sin as adults you make and you've got children your children are going to be an offspring of you Hallelujah and confession and asking for forgiveness is the only way of Correction if Judas had only gone to Pentecost um have an extra room I'm trying to tell you something perhaps you don't know this but because you could say William Brandon was the prophet of Malachi 4.00 and neither will that change y'all better hear what I'm saying movies they increase with unbelief it made no difference on all of the Miracles and the signs and wonders they did everything that they were not supposed to do and yes they said they followed the prophets [Music] but you need a change and that change must come from God because you cannot change yourself the Bible says hallelujah and you can lick them all you want all it's going to do is make your sin more brighter Hallelujah but see there's another side to the story of change right now we I'm gonna get there in just a minute but I want you to understand what sin will do not just to you imagine your family especially when you hide sins and one thing I know about people they call themselves covering each other's sin is against the word of God a can um did something he wasn't supposed to do and what did he do he took the Babylonian garments the wedges of silver and gold and he was instructed by Joshua separate yourself from the world but those little things he couldn't separate from okay and I'm not going to go into the whole story but what happened it calls people in the church to die you understand me your sins don't just affect you if you call yourself a Christian if you call yourself a believer of this church your sins will affect people's spiritually and naturally God will judge you for it Hallelujah anyhow man because I'm I'm serious this morning very serious about what what is going on here I don't know what's going on here but this is the message that God gave me to preach this is a time for your change this is the time for your season and don't miss it y'all hear me because they're coming a last call is that right amen the Holy Ghost keeps dealing with you Luke sent us yeah you won't budge one day he's going to stop and you'll never hear his voice again Hallelujah but what happened to akan it can not only killed his wife he killed his children he killed his animals anymore what because he allowed his mind to be influenced by the devil's voice he allowed his mind to be influenced by the devil's voice he heard what Joshua says and the devil said well if I just take a little bit it won't hurt it won't hurt because you have no pain when you're dead it killed the man his whole family foreign [Music] and the other didn't know that the Judgment of God has struck God the only way of escaping sins now some people say well that's you know this message this message is boring and uh you know if it's boring that means you don't love God because the word is never boring should never be boring Hallelujah I just want to let you know there's another story more than one but the Bible said let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus with God hallelujah but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men made himself a man he's basically trying to make us God making man a God is that right he's changing us and the Bible said we are living from glory to glory now I'm gonna ask the question again since you've been saved in this message how much change have you seen in your life do you really see where you're closer to God there's some people who don't even know the message even though we sat here yeah some of us are just church members but God is trying to get you to see salvation is of the Lord and those things can't be changed God can change them in a moments he said well what do you mean brother Brooks whatever seed is in you it's shaping you and it's forming you is that right but the truth of the matter is if you got the seed of God in you and that seed has not been quicker you'll be just like Peter you still have all the natural things about you very quick to get angry you know what I mean I mean he was a deserter of the army of God is that right because his nature wasn't changed it wasn't that he wasn't a seed but whatever the seed was that was living in him Shake him into that kind of a person is that right that's why you must be born again Hallelujah listen you're coming from the message absolutely absolutely the prophet of God said God Is Right his word is Right others are not right correct that's right as long as they stay with the word but when you leave the word then you leave God because God is watching over his word vindicate it he's got to make it real he's got to make it acts that's why you people are hungering for Revival it's time for these things to be here if you ever believe me to know see oh do you think possible that all of a sudden the Rapture would be five minutes away even if God told you that let me see and you're not ready now you would be ready then hallelujah amen yes sir listen coming from you know the message absolutely he said if you can you can read that scripture something that Christ has ordained or commission us to do and because some twisting around if someone would tell you that was for the disciples or someone else and then you don't hold on to that Christ is not your absolute that person who led you out of the way absolutely absolutely Hallelujah man let me say it like this yes people who believe in polygamy can you say brother Brandon preached it he preached it because she'll tell you to show you how wrong it was and how it came by the Fall because if you know any type of paragraphical if you know how to write a paper a composition of your composition will tell everything about the body the information that's coming to you in more detail foreign right and message people preachers have Twisted this and a lot of people are in serious problems because I'm gonna tell you something but it's not what you don't trust all polygamy does and make you want another see um your flesh will never be satisfied y'all better hear what I'm saying but just so that you'll know I don't I don't agree with that I stand with brother Brandon stands and I stand where the word stands and I look at people and let me tell you something I don't have to repent from what I'm saying but you have to repent from what you believe if you're going to make a Rapture I didn't say you wasn't Sage if you make a Rapture you're gonna have to repent from that and come back to the word of God um I I found out some information yesterday I think it was yesterday and it just about wiped me out dealing with that same situation I was in my house absolutely almost fainted because it was a brother that I trusted never mind I ain't going in that but my point is I don't know how else to tell you go listen to it again God will reveal the truth to you but you can't continue that Grace May abound I just preached on that the last time and since I preached on that I haven't seen that bro anyway I won't go there but let me tell y'all something listen I'm I'm my goal is one thing and that is to make a Rapture I I see changes in me and to me I'm still not changing fast enough you know what I mean but I know the grace of God keeps me covered Hallelujah sometimes you know people you don't even know I'm watching but it gets so boring or whatever to the people they walk out and they stay out there and talk and whatever more they do God I'm not here to rebuke you in that way I'm just coming here to try to tell you what's ever wrong you need to make it right ah second Corinthians 3 18 I can't make you love God but I know the moment you really love him you'll then respect him respecter and if you respect him you'll do your best to be the church on time just like you go to work on time Hallelujah you know my thing is a problem any of you guys have problem with the song service why don't you come do leadings a few songs let's see how well you do with it this is you got all these Minds in here and everybody want to hear something different you can never satisfy the minds of people [Music] and I just asked for some respect if you don't like the way things are going on around here you can easily talk to me right second Corinthians 3 18. what this week how many weeks have been gone three weeks and I'm just waiting just one or two people really greeted me like they missed me okay Hallelujah that's almost like coming home and your wife ignores you as it comes to vanilla Museum y'all know what I'm saying but my thing is people how can you say you love me and you don't know God um I tell you what the Bible say the prophet is without honor in his own country if you would see the way people treat me when I go other places and I tell the people how you guys act they would be in Shockey and it ain't about Congolese either I've gone places and it's like on fire worship and everything too and I get in here if you see it's like Lord help me raise the dead synonyms and I'm not trying to be funny am I being serious can y'all take this because I'm gonna tell you what's what's happening one thing America did to our food they put sugar assault in it they change and altered the flavors of things [Music] so when we come to the real food it tastes nasty it's it will change it'll build your muscles say why you know that's how when I went there when I went to Liberia everybody knew I was American just because of my size see why there's an American you know [Laughter] it's the truth folks oh you really get everybody's fit and thinning and this big old boy coming up in there it is what it is let me move on just want to see whether you could smile a little bit yes but we I want you to I'm trying to get us to see that this message is real and she says you can't we don't have the time that we used to have uh y'all go hear this word and you're gonna remember what I said this is not time to let your feelings overtake you right and this is where it starts right here right here in your mind this is the greatest battle ever fall and whoever you listen to It's what's going to shape you it is going to form you absolutely it's going to change you if you listen to The Devil he's gonna make you a devil the spirit of the Lord see the spirit of the Lord is what changes it's what changes means does it mean we're not gonna break down and fall sometimes absolutely but one thing it will do make us say I'm sorry it'll make us make rice with God you're not going to get there without suffering suffering comes with the package [Music] who are your enemies the Bible says your enemy is a is of your household Hallelujah this is why you have problems one or the other Hallelujah and you get upset with each other I said it is absolutely a shame if our natural brothers and sisters offend us we readily forgive them but if our spiritual brothers and sisters we have a hard time forgiving it's backwards and what Jesus said and Mary and his her his siblings came to see Jesus and they said uh uh uh uh Jesus your mother's out there he said who is my mother who is my brother but those who do my father's will what was he saying those that are spiritual those who are of me they are my true family and if we all are the family of God we're supposed to treat each other Somalia who I hope I'm penetrating your heart I hope God is doing something here I hope you're listening really really listening to me you know I don't even care if you get angry with me about anything that I say because if you do that means it's working I I don't think you come to church just to be seen I think all of us come we want to make a rapture we want a translation let me tell you the nominations are going to be disappointed but most of the people in this message that don't make it you're going to be very very disappointed and your Tormentor is going to be greater because you knew the truth hallelujah now people say oh the foolish virgins they have denominations they used to be easy when God moved on say when the series were open God used a different fabric you are using fabric Hallelujah and every Revival produces twins how can denominationalism be virgins when they're not they're going to take the mark of the beast if they don't come out of it Hallelujah where is that Porsche but what we do with this thing Hallelujah it got to the place hallelujah it's still like that could be quoting script I could be quoting brother Brandon right here and some of y'all won't even know it because I didn't say brother that doesn't save you Hallelujah you gotta know Christ for yourself Hallelujah amen hallelujah I got to see Jesus from my house and one day for certainly I will not stand before him as an idolater is that right they use the prophet of God's quotes to build systems if it wasn't true if we all listen to the adult unadulterated word who would be one group because this one has its way to it and that one has a sway to it we're just as dividers as everybody else so if this is United times in size oh yeah Hallelujah that's right brother Brandon called his message the Holy Ghost message and the Holy Ghost vindicates himself hallelujah amen I asked those people I said when the last time you had Joy is it Monday nobody could say nothing I said that means you're not in his presence you don't have joy in the presence of the Lord there is Joy fullness of joy and people are so sad they're frustrated you get so frustrated you take out your frustration on each other problem and let him know how much righteous you're going to become it is how much more Sanctified you're going to become a winner he's not going to change me into his image if you want to be a winner because Jesus gave you the victory can you imagine the Lord Jesus giving you the victory amen before God can change you he's got to change your mind Hallelujah and a lot of times people think that you can get Jesus in your mind listen what the man of God says uncertain sounds he said the mind is a director [Music] it will direct you and it's very incapable of bringing you to God wait a minute say your mind can't bring you to God your mind you cannot know God by your mind Hallelujah and that's where some of us are seeing somebody make a misquote brother random didn't say it like that it's the true folks when people challenge me you know the first thing I look at the Social Security look beyond what they look like in their flesh I look at heart conditions out of your mouth tells me what kind of a person you are out of your mouth your words condemn you your word should convicts you y'all hear what I'm saying if is your word that tells me who you are because the Bible says in Sweet Water can't come out of the same Fountain Hallelujah I don't know I don't know he said you cannot know God by your mind intellectually it's one of the resources or the channel That would lead to it but your soul is what governs you you are what you are your soul now let me say it like this when that devil came into the message and start swaying people with the quote I miss um the Holy Ghost without Sensations they stopped there they didn't read all of the rest of it you know but it talks about the life of Jesus Christ you don't have to feel nothing but you definitely gotta have the life of Jesus Christ come on somebody yeah maybe you don't shout maybe you don't dance maybe you don't speak in tongues right let me show y'all something let's move there was nowhere in the word where Stephen ever did a miracle but he had so much God in him that when they stoned him Hallelujah he started speaking in town he started shouting no he didn't no what came out of his mouth because the word of God said blessed is that right and he said father all these things not to their charge that was God in him the same God said father forgive them for they know not what they do remember that was the same God Hallelujah and right now I'm living from glory to glory a year ago or two years ago because he's constantly changing me I also have to constantly repent that have problems every one of us have problems Hallelujah but by the grace of God we understand our change Hallelujah Jesus could stand there and say I am that I am but we'll be coming hallelujah hallelujah he said now one day see you got to understand this flesh ain't changing until God changes it so you're going to have an enemy all the time that's why the word of God said kill it like mortified the Jesus of the flesh is that right says but you let it rot that's the only way life is going to come from I understand all of us have a right we have rights and you could have the right to obey and you have the right this is what gets me we got a group of people now this is and you'll never get to heaven you don't want to hear it from your head you want to hear it from your heart you want to be changed how many tapes you've heard and how much change you've had am I knocking on your door I hope so and I hope by God's grace you'll open it up to him I can't change we need to be changed you know our attitudes are not right each other one thing I preached there I preached here in order to fix this church you got to fix the families first makes your natural family first then we could have us a Revival well it's true some of y'all have arguments from the time you leave the house till you get to the door and then you straighten up then you straighten up you're already late and your atmosphere is wrong how can God move in that brother Brandon said he is Solutions y'all don't have to say Amen because see if you was in the spirit Nearer My God today would be beautiful but when you come in counter mine you want the song leader to reset you know you reset yourself you out of alignment you reset yourself before you get here foreign drink you some coffee put in a little cafe something with caffeine in it something that'll wake you up but if you eat you you're not gonna hear a word all your blood is going down to your stomach you ain't hearing a thing you hear him but you're not hearing you understand me you need to be empty in order for God to fill you up that's the truth he said why well I'm gonna go by and get me a sausage egg and cheese biscuit y'all understand I'm trying to help you that ain't gonna work let me hurry up let me hurry up my time getting away Jesus Christ the same yesterday today he said there are two elements that make up the human being and one of them is your mind and the other one is your soul and the mind is your mental thinking is a part of God you understand me and this is the only age that God can take bring the holy spirit because it is based upon truth that Soul it's where God needs to go if the Holy Ghost comes in your soul where you have trouble with your friends absolutely absolutely that man is there to war with you into the Rapture take place let him get the best of you somebody help me and when you see your own make it right and listen I think one of the uh writer says avenge yourself when you do wrong make it right you keep it right oh changing the mind that's what God wants to do when he said let this mind be in you that was also in Christ what was he talking about he was talking to mine he wasn't talking about this thing that we that's located here how do you know you got something going on when God began to talk to you inside not from the outside yeah but when he talks to you from the inside out those of you who have experienced that you know Alexander not from your head when it comes to your head it could be the devil but when it's from the souls Hallelujah nobody said like this y'all don't know but it's United times inside you know that those people out there in the world uniting with their demons yeah and they're proud of their demons you know they used to call people actors but now they're calling them Gods because people are worshiping the actors now and if you want to go back that's what they did in the days of the Greek and days of the Romans music Hallelujah and at the same time when the devil was producing god um that's what I'm trying to tell you if you don't get saved if you don't give your heart to God you're not going to get better you're going to get worse and what does that do for a Christian it produces a hypocrite you love the Lord one more quote and I could I could go no two one quote a normal scripture and I'll let you go coming from identification but we pray that the Holy Ghost since this afternoon break into every heart and to every mind as we have just read let the mind that was in Christ be in you I pray that as you see that the mind is the controlling Tower of the whole being that it directs us and let the mind that was in Christ this afternoon and he was always believing the word and now may there be a great outpouring of his presence upon us hallelujah amen we look at these virtues and we say it's just an idol because if that's the way you're just looking at it so you can memorize what you can do it that's all it is to you it's nothing since you're now but God rich in Mercy has shown unto us how to obtain God's divine nature that's what we lost when Adam fell apocals that's what God returned back to us and the Bible says if any one of those virtues do you like you are like a blind man and you have forgotten that you was once delivered from your sins is that all right the word of God according to Psalms 119. some songs that word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path all right is it why I said one more but this is my last one the sixth chapter I love you people and I love you I appreciate you and there's not one person here that I want to see lost I'm not here for your liking I'm not here for you to like me I'm not here for your money I'm here because God has ordained me to be a watcher over your soul and I would be a fool to stand in the pulpit and play with God knowing that he's watching every move I can't be like the other preachers I just can't be that way this is a house of judgments and judgment begins at the house of God this is because that preach doesn't make me perfect but the voice that comes out of me is again my family can tell you I'm not perfect I make mistakes I do things sometimes that's not pleasing to the Lord you watch me long enough you'll see it see from himself but one thing I don't know Luke 6 Luke starting at the 47th verse we're close with this scripture whosoever cometh to me and heareth continue to hear my sayings and doeth them I will show you to whom he is like he is like a man with building house and lay the foundation the stream beat vehemently upon the house and could not shake it for it was founded upon Iraq Elizabeth I'm only saying these things to help do whatever I can do uh as far as God is concerned that we may change our minds I didn't know who was going to be here I didn't plan this message because I thought in my head somebody's going to be here I sought the Lord this is what he gave me but he knew who was going to be here so I don't want you to think I'm singling nobody out I don't know how you're repenting I don't know how you're growing I don't know what what but I do know one thing evidently God loves you because he corrects his children but he that heareth it's like a man that without a foundation build and house upon the Earth against which the stream beat did beat vehemently and immediately and the ruins of that house was great amen you love the Lord let us bow here our heavenly father I shall celes you know I had no idea of which this way this message would go this morning even before I came I had to pray that you would forgive me of my sins you would cleanse me from my unrighteousness no one sin is greater than the other companies just as you taught in the law come true if we break one commandment we are guilty of them all so Lord we all stand in that place of forgiveness we need your daily forgiveness we always need the blood of your dear son Jesus until we come in contact with the Immortals and Lord we know that you're here this morning [Music] it's not been a lot of shouting but I do believe within my heart somebody was listening and somebody heard the father while their hearts are still tender why they had a place of repentance receive us all this
