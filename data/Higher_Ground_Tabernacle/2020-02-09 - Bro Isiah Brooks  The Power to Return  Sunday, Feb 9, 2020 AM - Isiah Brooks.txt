TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and we worship you this morning and Jesus Christ name we pray you may be seated I have a lot of thoughts running through my mind this morning and I am so grateful to the Lord for being good to me he is a merciful and kind God we're living in a time where it seems as though Satan is getting the best of his people I was listening to a message this morning it brother Brennan was talking about Walt Disney and he talked about how Walt Disney was a man who had a vision and during his time of trying to find how far his gift could take him he struggled because there were so many people who told him that he could not succeed he did not have what it took to be someone great but Walt Disney was that kind of a man that knew he had a gift you must know what you got you must know what you have on the inside because the devil is going to spend lots of time telling you that you're not able telling you that you're not capable telling you that you're not chosen and elected it is his job to discourage but you must know what you're packing and no matter how many times Walt Disney failed he failed many times like any artists will do before they come up with the masterpiece they've trashed a lot of work but no matter how they tried to discourage him one day Walt Disney was in a place where he saw a mouse and that little mouse was acting very peculiar and from that inspiration he came up with the cartoon Mickey Mouse now the Walt Disney a company or organization is a billion-dollar industry why because one man had a vision and no matter how many times he failed he would not stop he would not allow the enemy to make him quit that's how we must be we must be determined in this day that no matter how many times I fall no matter how many times I come short no matter how many times I fail God chose me a whole Lord y'all didn't hear me God chose me I didn't choose him he chose me and there is no failure in God it's not him who know him who runneth but it is God who shows mercy see it is not about your religion it's about salvation hey somebody help me here see I know sometimes when I preach it puts you into a particular place where you think that I've got to do this and I've got to do that but if you find yourself in that place realize it's not you you can never live righteous enough to please God you could never live holy enough to please God or to even married heaven the salvation in which we have today is by grace a lord help us Jesus my subject on this morning the power to return and God's definition of power is not like somebody with the which a war alarm or over crystal ball God's definition of power is Authority you shall receive power you shall receive authority after which the Holy Ghost is come upon you the only way we could ever return to the place in which we have fallen it takes someone greater than what we are and it tooks someone and we know that individual as Jesus Christ I just want to tell you something this morning that none of God's Word will come back void the Bible tells us that everything that God has spoken will return to him with an accomplishment in otherwise it will accomplish its purpose you and I must understand that we all are stones cut in various ways none of us are cut the same way when Solomon built the temple those stones were cut in different places at different times but when they all came together they made the Temple of God so is it with God don't ever measure yourself by someone else because you are different stone might be cut from the same Rock hallelujah but you are a different cut and so enjoy the way God has cut you enjoy who you are because God made you who you are telling the story about Jacob I'm gonna just lay something down by God's grace all of us know Jacob yeah Jacob and you had Esau God said Esau I hate but Jacob I love and Jacob was a shyster he was a con man he knew how a meant to get over if I could say it like that he knew how to use people to gain his purpose or his mean but God said he loved him but here was Esau who was the good guy the proper child he was the guy that that daddy loved hallelujah but it was God who saw the inside of the inside of those two boys one had representation and the other one did not it's not about how good you are it's whether God has chosen you and elected you and has placed your name in the Lamb's Book of Life you have heard me say many times you cannot hear this message except you be a lamb somebody help me here see because the Bible says my sheep heareth my voice and the stranger they will not follow is that right even when you were in sin and trespasses you heard the voice of God you say what brother was what are you saying when Adam and Eve had sinned and the voice of God walked in the cruel of the day no blood at that time had been applied but when God called Adam Adam responded somebody help me here why because Adam was God's creation and Adams name was on the left because I somebody help me here cheap it doesn't matter if you're a murderer if your faith if you're a prostitute if you're a gambler it doesn't matter what you come into this life - if god from the foundation of the world knew you knew who you were before you came to know who you are somebody help me here is that right because God told Jeremiah I knew you before you were even in your mother's womb now I don't know what Jeremiah was but God said he knew it and just like God told Jeremiah I know you God is telling you this morning I know you hallelujah so when God knows you when God knows you you don't have to pretend with him you can be real somebody help me here oh my I think about it returning you see because when Adam and Eve sinned their judgment was you got to go back to the dust from whence you came they had to return back to the dust but this was not God's how can I say it perfect wheel his wheel was that Adam and Eve would live forever but because they sinned they had to die because God were says the day that you eat of this tree you should surely die you know you're not going we're going somewhere we're travelers with saw journals and we're going somewhere just like we came from somewhere we're going somewhere is that right and just like we came from somewhere we've been somewhere hallelujah I'm coming by God's grace we know the story of Jacob Jacob was a shyster and he stole his brothers birthright and Esau was mad with him but you I realize that that one thing about the true seed of God no matter what it takes to make heaven they're gonna do it it may look crazy to somebody else but to the elect of God it makes sense hallelujah because though Esau was the firstborn Jacob wanted that right of the firstborn now we know these things and he lied to do it and the thing about it is his mama helped him do it ah because she got away from God that the youngest son would would be the ruler over the the eldest son is that right now you gotta understand that this power that we're working with is eternal this turn eternal God knows how to push things in place he is going to make sure his word accomplish is purpose if I'm making sense now we look at this thing in and hear Esau excuse me Jacob he shy sees his brother he runs over to us his relative called laman and Laban was a relative a close relations here he goes over there and I'm showing you something here just bear with me he goes over there and he sees this beautiful girl by the name of Rachel he falls in love with her but you got to understand whatever you saw you're gonna reap it too even if you're Christian if you do wrong it's coming back there's something about return that word means it goes around and it comes around to where it starts is it y'all know that everything has to return whether it be good or evil it's coming back that's why the Bible always tell us that we need to be careful because that law holds true to good and evil whatsoever a man soweth he all shall also shall reap and if you know anything about reaping harvest is greater than the planting it always come back to you in the worst way you love the Lord so Jacob Amen he goes to his Laban and he thousand find the man that's worse than he is Laban was a greatest shyster y'all better hit me now see Laban was a greater shyster than Jacob that's the way God works it but God was working something he was really doing something here so Laban is has literally taken advantage of of Jacob because he knew Jacob loved Rachel and Jacob he tells Jacob now if you're gonna get my daughter come along somebody you're gonna have to pay and you're gonna work seven years and don't jacob was so in love a man with Rachel he said when that seven years came to end he said it was just like yesterday somebody help me now watch this because he comes around and then here is something to remind Jacob of what he did to Esau and when Rachel was promised to Jacob here God allowed Leah who's the first of the two to go into his tent can you imagine wasn't nothing beautiful wasn't nothing beautiful about here can you imagine when Jacob woke up in the morning and saw the face and he saw in those days when night fell night fell there was no great lights out there to show you who was who he winds up in the thinking that he's got Rachel and he turns over and it's Lea what a shock but no doubt in his mind it came back to him what he did there see what I'm saying to God is a just God he's a righteous God he's a merciful God but you still got to reap what you sow and so now Jacob is upset what must I do to make this thing work you got to work for me seven more years think about it 14 years this man was loved some of us would have packed our bags and would stay later but not not not Jacob who's really in love why because that love that he had for Rachel was given to him by God it was a different kind of a love y'all hear what I'm saying I said love not lost love it was an eternal love that perhaps even himself could not explain why he loved this woman so much and in the course of that he's being ripped off if I could say it like that I don't know how you say that it he's being taken advantage of because Laban changes his wages ten times not for the better he's not getting a raise in fact the more he worked the less he made but listen God like oh no this can't happen but God was looking at working on his behalf is that right see when God gets ready to make a turn in your life guess who shows up he does so you can't make yourself change you can't turn the corner until God turns the corner for you somebody help me here but when God gets ready to make a change in your life he shows up is that right cuz that's what happened a man to take up God so Jake no doubt Dinka was crying he had something in his heart was going on because he was working faithfully Jacob said to Laban I've been faithful I didn't feel none of your sheep I didn't eat any of them I froze at night y'all know that doesn't get really cold at night and he says during the summer there was a drought and I sweat myself working working working for you and the harder I work the less of my pain but God God showed up and gave me a dream and told me what I needed to do y'all understand me see God is the one that leads you he's the one that guides you and sometimes these little inspiration we don't even know it's God and God is directing you in the way that you should go so we we I heard from him he told me about the shackle he told me about the sheep in the goat and all of the things that colors they're gonna be he showed me how to do it and I did it you understand me so let's move on now what I'm trying to say is when you're not ready to turn on your own God will make it happen when you get so comfortable in Zion when you add ease in Zion God is gonna bring trouble to your house God is gonna make you pray and God is gonna make you pray hallelujah is that right God is gonna call caused you to cry out to him that right because God can't respond to you until you cry out there's a deep call to the deep there's one to respond so God has to put this situation on you so you could cry out to him Oh glory to God understand this is why we have a vision this is why Malachi 4 had to come he had to give us a vision on where we are we were to go you understand me are we ought to go what do you mean brother we'll see if you don't know where your home is you don't know how to return you gotta know who you're where your home is you got to know where you come from and where you're going hallelujah without a vision that's right the people perish y'all know that's true so we were so lost we were so lost and here was Jacob over there not knowing what to do and God came to Jacob says now it's time for you to leave it's time for you to go back to your homeland but he had to go through the persecution God had to put something on him that made to make him desire to go back home y'all better hit me you see because we're in a time when we're too comfortable we're too relaxed but God is gonna put it on us he's gonna make you desire heaven he's gonna make you want to leave this place in spite of all the dangers and I'm preaching I'm going on now because God will always do something for you let me just break put a break here you remember the little dream about Judah and Tamar and how Judah gate is you know he promised him other sons and how somehow Tamar comes up with this great revelation that she used to sell to pose as a prostitute somehow I'm gonna get pregnant somehow I'm gonna have the seed of God y'all understand me see what what you're saying is what I'm trying to tell you is that there are times when it seems like you're being neglected but there gotta be something on the inside of you that must you know Drive you to a place where it seems how can I say it it's not even a natural way you feeling what when Tamar is feeling is something that's not even accepted in her society has she been caught they would have stoned her but she was willing to risk her life to get what she wanted the most y'all better hear me what is it that you want the most this is what I love about it and in my studying I thought about it here was Tamar she's already deceived Judah Judah wants to give her a lamb but she understood I need more than just a lamb I need authority I need power y'all hear me somebody and she she understood that the value of Judas read his seal and she wanted those things out and heard the story before but this is where I'm going with it because when they search the city Judah said go search that place finally that harlot and give her this lamb that I'm going to give her and when the man returned to Judah and said I cannot find her and also the meaning of the place says that there was no harlot in his place see even though she played the harlot God erased it there was nowhere that even the harlot could be found y'all get what I'm saying see there you must understand even if you prayed the harlot God has already erased it no man will be able to find you not find the place where you did your work so I want to say all of that to say Jacob got to the place because God said you turn back around and I'm gonna bless you I want you to go back to your homeland this is our homeland y'all better hear me this is the only place you can find blessings it's in this book you've got to come back to this if Israel had to return back to their homeland you and I must return to ours these are all brother books I mean the masses know a lot of people that's in the message won't make it because they fail to return oh come on somebody you got to understand the message is not your intellectual understanding of what Malachi aforesaid you must come into a reality that must this built the life of this book must come and live in you y'all hear me she is not just the Holy Ghost it is the person of the Holy Ghost what do you mean justification makes room for sanctification save vacation makes room for the holy a baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is that fire of God they clears you makes room for the person himself God Himself y'all understand me because remember the stages that we go through as a believer is the same stages that the world the world was sanctified excuse me justified amen through North preaching sanctified is that right through Jesus Christ blood dropping on the earth right and now in order for Jesus to come back and step foot on this earth it must be purified it must be cleansed of every demon is that right it must receive a fire baptism and we know the fire is to come is that right oh yes some man will call this they be caught on fire but they won't know it is the very plan of God because before God can set foot back on this earth it must be due hello it must be new it must be clean hallelujah and in order for God to bring his perfection up in you it must be clean hallelujah it must be bad if I I got to come somewhere he's your brother once I don't feel the fire you don't have to feel the fire but the fire will come and purify you that is the truth that's why we have these virtues over here right but that virtue can't even begin until you are born again can I say it like that the new birth is that right Romans 10:9 if you confess the law with your mouth and believe in your heart he said you are saved and from that point on you have passed from death unto life but it don't stop there that's just the beginning hallelujah you've got the crime like I said the other day Jacob's Ladder oh my god see now I'm gonna take it out of your hands because y'all looking at it like oh my god how am I gonna do that I've tried and that's your problem you tried hallelujah ain't about you trying is about God doing it hallelujah there was nobody there who created the earth but God Himself it was God who created everything it was God who separated the Seas it was God who made the Seas grow it was God who created everything and God said unto himself it is good and if God did all of that in the beginning with the rest with the earth he must do it the same with you it is God who brings you something to virtue it is God who brings you from phaz technology understanding virtue to knowledge it's God in you that right who brings you to this place but you gotta let go and let God because one thing that God will not take from you that is your will I don't care how holy you think you are God will never take your will away that is something that you must right you must fight you must surrender your will to God because he's a gentleman he won't make you do one thing whosoever will let him come is this okay so Jacob realize he's got to go back home right I'm coming I'm actually taking it longer than I thought I would but anyway Jacobs got to go back home and he knows Esau is on the other side now something's wrong with you if you don't know Esau is ready to kill you he saw is mad with you cuz you tricked him out of the out of the birthright is that right somebody he saw a represents their organisations and denominations they're gonna realize that you got it and they ain't got it can I say like that they don't have it I'm not saying that there are not those in those denominations who are not elect but God those who are elected God's sake come out of her my people you gotta come out in for God to continue to mature you into Christ there are things you got to learn that things you must know it is God who's preparing you for a wedding you don't know how to do it but he has sent us water that will prepare us for rapture hallelujah he turns you when you go away what he turns you when you can't get up he makes you get up hallelujah because he knows your heart he knows your desire to serve Him he knows your desire to be perfect like he is it is God is that right because the Bible said he that begun a good work in you is faithful to complete it let me hurry on with this and so you realize I'll come back to something else in just a moment but Jacob had to pray see that's one thing we don't understand you can't make this journey without praying you first have all got to understand that I am dealing with something that I cannot will Jacob has a greater force than me he's got more men than I have and we know that Jacob Amen he hates me I've got to confront Jacob and if I've got to confront Jake I'm excuse me if I got to confront Esau and Jacob in a minute he saw if I got to confront Esau hallelujah well my god help me here hallelujah let me tell you something none of us can whip the devil without the help of the Lord absolutely none of us and you and I must understand in order for easy to use the Bible tells us you have not because you ask not and that's where the devil is defeating us we ask and we don't we ask a list like James say we don't have it in faith Lord if you will hallelujah it is his will God's will for us to conquer the devil that's what the Bible said we're more than conquerors in Christ it is his will hallelujah let me say like this so you can understand every test and trial you go through it's all because of your to benefit you every test and trial is to benefit you and sometimes we lose sight that God is in control you lose sight to say Lord I desire to be just like you and God says if that be the case let me work up a formula for you so you got to go through this in order to be like me hallelujah and we just forget we let Satan blindness in our minds when God says no trust the Lord with all your heart lean not to your own understanding acknowledge him and he'll direct your path he will do it every time God is telling you right now he's changing your mind he's changing your spirit he's letting you know amen is time to turn that's what he said to Jacob but Jacob had to pray says God I can't I can't meet he saw like this how many of y'all can meet the squeeze like this with the squeeze coming with the pressure coming when when this nation is going to turn against Christianity how many are prepared for that you say it won't yes it's coming and it's moving faster than what you think we are the enemy now because our world is so perverted we are the enemy because we stand for righteousness will the enemy because we stand on this word hallelujah and all nations everywhere has become so perverted they hate the Bible they hate the Christian they hate everything that we stand for now when they come to persecute you will you be ready how can we be ready when we can't even handle each other without getting its upset and ready to fuss and fight now that that is in heaven there is no fuss there there is no fighting up there not among the believer how are we gonna make it what we need now by God's grace is a refilling of the Holy Ghost Paulina we need God to come on the scene hallelujah but you can't come come in the God's house settling for anything like you're not in thirsting for him somebody help me here he said he viewed thirst and hunger for righteousness you shall be filled so what the devil is that he takes the thirst from you he takes your hunger and he puts you in a place que sera sera whatever will be will be hallelujah not with the believer God will put the fire to you to get you up out of the place that you're in is that right we can see it it's all through the scriptures so Jacobs prays and then the Bible says in this part I'm just not gonna read it but this depart said Jacob was all alone and sometimes we think that when we are alone God has isolated us and deserted us and God is trying to tell you this is the place I want you to be I've given you this time to pray I've given you this time to talk to me let's let's have a conference Jacob was so long he didn't know nothing else to do but to pray he began to praise his Lord don't you know I'm out here because you told me to come out here I know I've done wrong but I know Amen I cannot meet the old coming stolen in this condition we've got to realize the day we cannot meet the oncoming storm in this condition we need God we need to wrestle with him we need some of us can't even last 15 minutes in prayer I was a Jacob wrassle and to the break of day the changing of the guards here a sword with God him and he said I'm not going to let you go to your blessed me somebody help me you see we've got to be that determine if we are elected God is gonna drive us to it no ands ifs or buts about it he's gonna put you on your knees whether you like it or not he loves to lead us but if he can't leave you he gonna drive you he's gonna make it happen cuz you cannot fail him cuz he cannot fail himself I got Jacob out there you see Jacob was self-similar did y'all know that Jacob loved himself he loved himself more than he loved his family hallelujah is that right yeah he said listen I'm gonna tell y'all to go ahead Justin Provencher Esau still man you know he was willing to sacrifice their lives to preserve his own sound familiar don't tell me you not like that cuz Abraham see he starts out that way abraham was was selfish too ha you said don't say that by abraham yes said lied to that king tell him you're my sister otherwise he gonna kill me and he had rather trade his wife off like that so he could preserve his life thank God for the mercies of God thank God for the all-seeing eye thank God for the man who's responsible for your life in my life when we make mistakes God is always there to correct them somebody help me here always there how many of y'all have ever made mistakes and God come right there and make it right yes I will thank God what is he doing he's preserving you he's protected you keeping you and one day one days we know we'll return we're going to return well yes sir Jacob said God says I came brush until you go there and listen here also with the God with the Lord and the Lord Amen touched on the hollow of his thought and he became that limping prophet but that ain't no God changed his name from a shyster to a prince so what I'm trying to say for those of you who got the Holy Ghost you are no longer shysters you're no longer the same person you used to be God has changed your name and you need to live like it hallelujah what Richard needed some work on Rachel students either the supernatural thing that took place with Jacob because when they went when when Jacob left Laban y'all remember Jacob Rachel was still the idol worshiper hello come on somebody that's what's wrong with a lot of people in the message they still idol worshippers haha but you got to get rid of your father's idols huh y'all better help me here and where did she hide those idols right in the place of reproduction it him that her and at the same time God saved up am I making sense so I want you to understand it meant but she had to get listen even Jacob didn't know she had stolen them Jacob said let the president guilty of stealing Levens idols let them be put to death that's how serious it was you can't do you you can't bring the idols from wherever you came from with you Leah now Nosa you gotta lead that patty Bob divorce him oh my god y'all hear me this morning why are we returning to a place I can't preach it all in one time but I I just feel so excited this morning because listen let me give another story and I just can't finish it but let me say like this here Jacob comes along amen and he didn't even know that God was working on both ends God had already soft and Esau was hard hallelujah my fact he saw was glad to see it somebody help me now his daddy listen to me show you what happened you know where the pressure came they pressure came from Laban Laban put such a pressure on on Jacob - Jacob said I gotta get out of here now watch this God is moving on Jacobs behalf Jacob don't even know that God is behind labels attitude he knew that if he blessed Jacob labour was going to give him that mad he was gonna get jealous why no gambler no shyster likes to lose and here he was losing to a son-in-law not only this is Sonny law I don't know how to pray cars and all that I don't know about that stuff but I know one thing he would they call it a flush or something when you win whatever you call it anyway he he put them cars out there and dick Laban realized I lost everything my daughters are gone their children are gone everything that I owe my my cattle my sheep my everything this man has robbed me that God made Laban angry angry at Jacob Jacob saw it in his eyes and Jacob realized this man hadn't killed me yet cuz God is holding him Regus he said the reason why labor hadn't hurt me because God is holy have you ever met anybody like that before you can see their hatred in the eyes hallelujah you know what they could do something to hurt you they would but you know God is holding them or God hammering you said i'ma get up out of here what was that what am i trying to tell you I'm trying to tell you that on your way back to where you came from you're going to face a lot of trials you're gonna face a lot of troubles but I want you to understand that God is behind every trouble you catch everything you go through this laughs God is we're having it he's pushing you he's pushing you he's pushing you to get you to come back to where you came from thank you dope they older better getting the best to devil who never gets the best of the seed of God ha because the Bible said he causes us to triumph he makes it happen well somebody help me y'all don't mind me preaching just give me a little bit more time I know I'm being long-winded you think about it and I'm gonna jump to Ruth's real quick because her Ruth she and Naomi and all of the rest of them Naomi and her husband you know they leave you know that's what happens people said well you know what ain't nothing going on in church now I go to church and it's so dry look like there's a family in the land so I better find me somewhere else to go and you don't even know that God is working it out God knew exactly what he was doing but it seems like they didn't understand because a lot of time people think church is shouting and dancing and running up and down the aisle and all of that is good but that does not define God because they can do that in a club hallelujah you know what defines God is when you can catch a revelation of his word y'all hear me when Jesus was standing there and saying blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God you know with that kind of voice the Bible said his voice was so soft and light he didn't disturb nothing in the street when John the Baptist was a different man John about was a screamer like me John was cutting the down things and putting the ax the root of the tree and here comes Jesus with his soft-spoken voice I wonder how many of us would have stayed in his church and then he would preach such simple message a sower went out to sow a seed and you say oh my god I'm a farmer I don't see it see it wasn't given to you to see if you couldn't see it but for those who could see it that one seed just like I tell people I said when Jesus preached that message he preached the whole Bible in a farm story about seeds that were so long before the foundation of the world brought to a harvest manifested itself son was going to the garner some was burned up some died on the wayside y'all hear what I'm saying he was telling the story of Christians so-called but let's move on he was a great preacher but anyway we know what happened Ruth I mean they all miss husband and all sons were killed and God did it why tragical things happen when harvest approaches when the harvest time approaches y'all hear me he sholde brother will you say let me tell you something when harvest time approaches the combine separates the seed from the wheat from the tares and it comes and it brings a lot of hardship right now every one of us are going through some kind of hardship whether it's in our family our close family distant family you know it ain't just friends it's everywhere horrible things are happening but God is trying your faith you still believe in do you still trust him hallelujah amen one thing about Naomi Naomi says listen I'm in the wrong place see you got to know when you're backslidden you can't say I'm not back so there's nail her husband and all of him in the land of Moab they were backslidden they died out there but Naomi says I'm going back because she knew that that land was where the blessings were huh let me say that I you know I'm a jump a little bit so I can get to where I need to go but my point is God brought hardship to get them back to the land and when she got to the land it wasn't easy that's what it is sometimes we think we'll all I'm gonna get on my knees and pray when you mean business Satan is right there to stop you he's right there to stop you when you mean business but you know what you gotta press through the bottle hey you think when we got over there cuz you know Israel hated more more ABS you know they were already told not to have anything to do with them and then here's a Moabite it's coming in and then going into bow asses feel and you know greenie in the field and you know attitudes now some of y'all think that all Jews are so holy and pious maybe you have never been around Jews but you got to understand the Jews are flesh and bone too and I'm gonna tell you something the same thing you find among Gentiles you find among the Jews jealousy and hatred and everything else right so let me sit like this they were putting it on Ruth but one thing Reed was determined she said to us Naomi your God will be my god you understand me she had a set focus your people will be my people you understand me in spite of the way they treat me they'll be my people in spite of the way I may look he's my god and she would determine oh I can't express it you know y'all came late so that gives me extra time to preach but when it comes men to God we realized by God's grace and then you and I must understand hallelujah when win-win-win-win-win when God says something in order you can't stop it is that right how many our sisters have babies and wish you could stop it when the tribulation when the trial came when that that time for the birth you wanted to stop it you either wanted to stop a hurry up and it never came according to your will some time you knew it was a bore because it was stubborn it took his time usually girls are faster somebody say yeah who said dad that's right but it's true usually you can tell by the way it comes what it is right I've had eight so you know saying we should know sometimes you get a girl like that and when she's born that way she's gonna be that way until God changes her nature you said no sir yes that's why those olden Hebrew mothers knew what to name their children they judge the way they acted right when they were born oh it's true my son by the name of Gabriel Gabriel Christian Joshua why did I name him that he was a fighter he's a fighter to this day right my mother my wife was having him and looked like the man looked like the boy stood up stood up and stood up I wanted to spank him being I'm like you don't do my wife like that I'm thinking that I'm telling you her mm to be funny but I'm telling you the truth and that fella right now he might be short but he's a father but anyway move on the same you know because of his nature he's been successful though you know I got to say that too but nevertheless and then you see these things God is pushing you through what what is he pushing you through he's pushing you through a birth channel that would take away all your selfishness oh everything in the flesh must go so he's pushing you through that channel so that when you come through the channel you'll come out perfect not my real law but thine be done I don't I went anyway did you know just coming from let me read this from crisis is identified listen the prophet god says now in the beginning that's when Tom started when eternity broke down into time now after a while some come back into eternity now let me say like this I'm gonna say it like Einstein said it Einstein said that time is just a little place that God put in eternity so everything won't happen at the same time can y'all get it see eternity eternity I'm not finished with my quote yet eternity is eternity but you got to realize that this thing was placed there can you imagine see God is all in all I don't know how to distinguish what to do with this and put I don't know eternity is eternity nothing involves with him that's why he says I am I am I don't understand it but I know that time brings me to a place from a baby to a grown-up time takes me from a grown-up to back to the dust right but it doesn't stop there see what I'm saying because I'm part of eternity because I allowed eternity to step in me so therefore I'm part of eternity so when I die in this flesh like I said this body goes back to the dust there's another body waiting for me Paul said I have I have one made a building whose building whose maker is God so I have another one but listen let me i'ma cut it short because I realized we've got to we've got to go but my point is I finished this evening my point is we must return now this time was given to us because of the fall but the fall worked in God's plan so that God can express his attributes to us through us in us is that right amen so we realized that so now you show what were you saying brother remember God asked job job where were you and imma ask you this morning where were you when the sons of God began to shout when they began to dance when they began to cry out hallelujah you know what they saw they saw redemption they saw the fall and they cried out with joy when they saw the redemption plan when they saw the lamb take the book out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne where were you I'll tell you where I was I was there so I know you were there because I'm here steer shouting hallelujah Amen right so time is eternity too but time is allotted space and that's the way like I said the other night this is all you get you don't have another chance this is the only time you got to make Jesus Christ your savior this is the only time you have to make heaven if you die without Jesus there's no second time ain't no coming up Lord I'm sorry you understand me why aren't you dead now even when you was a sinner because the blood of Jesus Christ protected you even when you was a sinner you said well yes this world would have exploded years ago hundreds of years ago because of the sin but the blood of Jesus is the bumper hmm let me go on with this you're all right with this hey man it's just a lot of time but you got to understand he's eternal that's why I said like this you cannot have eternal life less you be part of God's eternal is that right eternity eternity has no beginning he turned he has no get an ending but it goes this way it's a circle if it's not a circle it goes into an 8 it has no beginning no ending no stopping place it is what it is what it is but that little spot that God put in there as time he came to teach us he came to mold us they don't know that did you under do you understand that you are a new creature God is creating you anew for a new world a new beginning and guess what it is all I can't Holly wait till I get to heaven heaven is not your final destiny did you know that because when it's all over we come back to the earth new jerusalem and all the people that are redeemed come back to this place you understand me in other words we return but let me say it like this in closing for this morning you'll never return without the returning power you must have the returning power on the inside you say well what is that power Jesus Christ says I am the resurrection and I am the life in order for you to come back you must have Jesus Christ on the sigh Jesus Christ is not an emotion Jesus Christ is life what happens if you is one of those old saints of God in that time of this when they were they call it the Ox age when people were being slaughtered Yun's demi being slaughtered by the catholic church and and and being marred and many babies was being ripped out of their stomach and people were put on rotisserie Sauveur the fire amen and cooking them and you know like that slowly cooking them trying to get them to deny Christ do you have it do you have it it's in your foxes Book of Martyrs all kinds of torture burning people at the stake right all the Protestants were no better they're murderers too I notice it rough to say but you see in a few days from now when that Union come together and the mark of the beast and the image of the Beast comes together woe to those Amen who has not the mark of Christ in their forehead because those of us who don't have the mark of Christ you will get the mark of the beast what does the mark of Christ Jesus in you all right the mark of the beast because of all you're gonna have it in your hand and then your forehead know that spiritually means that you're going to do his will mentally you're gonna accept it and physically you're going to do it because that's the pressure you can buy or sell except you take the mark and when that Union come you better know what you standing on you gotta understand like Paul says Oh death where is your sting o grave where is your victory thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ you got to know who you are I cut it short but let me say like this just like Walt Disney he had that little something that made him know no matter what comes my way I am Who I am I am an artist you got to know no matter what comes in my way I am the bride and I don't care how many times I fall I don't care how many times I come short I am the bride that little thing in you would determine where you're going you understand me it will drive you into a place a perfection you love the Lord let's tan I took a little more time with that story than I thought I would but God knows God knows we are we can't stay here folks even when you die you're going somewhere you're going to return from whence you came understand the Bible said Judas was the son of perdition right now I said things about the Catholic Church and I say thinks about the Protestant Church and now I'm not against anybody's religion or organization that's not what I'm talking about we understand that systems is the thing that divide the Christians one thing they're better than the other impulses is Christ divided no we're not divided we're one body we you understand me and so a lot of time we we hit things because we want to understand that systems what caused you to do things listen you said what do you mean did you know it was the Roman system that killed Jesus it was the the Jewish system that killed Jesus that crucified I mean people who can call themselves Pharisees and Sadducees and you know Herodians they were the one who put Jesus to death it is the system that takes his word and put it to death he's no longer the same yesterday today and forever oh we don't have to do this we don't have to do that and and and why y'all living like that it's almost like I can ask asking the sheep why are you living like that or asking a dove why are you living like that they can't help it it's their nature when your nature has changed you can't help but to live like God think like God walk like God live like God hallelujah the only thing we have this o sinful flesh and because of this sinful flesh we come short sometimes but the Bible said that he's already made an advocate for us if we confess our sins the Bible said he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and the cleanse us from all unrighteousness if not people they which are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my faith see you got a turn and turn from their wicked ways he said then I will hear from heaven and heal their land that's what we need this morning we need a healing we need a restoration we need God to do something we can't do it on our own it can't be manufactured it can't be put on it's got to be real so what I'm gonna do ask everybody to bow we're gonna pray father God we come before you we thank you for your grace we think if for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves father we won't we don't want religion [Music] because there are so many people who had religion and still didn't make it we don't need a name we don't need a name other than the name you've given us Lord and I pray right now that you cause each and every one of us to live up to that name and that name is the Lord Jesus Christ Lord without your Jesus what will we do father you sent us a prophet in our day and many people don't agree many people don't see but it wasn't given to them to see it doesn't change the fact of who he is and what he was Lord we thank you for the ministry of our prophet brother Branham and how it through him you open our eyes to things that we would have never seen lord I thank you for your amazing grace to give us eyes to see in a heart of the need to be able to hear your voice in a time like this lord please help us turn us Lord whatever is necessary to bring us to that perfection I know you will because your word cannot come back void and everything you have predestinated us to do we shall and will do with on the Lord with grace and with mercy bless your people touch them now take away the lukewarmness from their heart Lord sent their souls of fire may they focus on the inner man not about things that they hear with their natural ear but things that they will hear with their hearts Jesus Lord Jesus we be few in number we know that Lord but father we hear your voice continue to draw us continue to pull us till we come to that place where you can say well done grant it grant us your grace we thank you lord we give you honor we give you praise in your name Jesus Christ we pray in the presence of Jehovah in prayer oh yeah God Almighty with us be [Music] yes [Music] again [Music] [Music] Oh in [Music] you love the Lord if there be anybody that desire personal prayer you're more than welcome to come we then get in [Music] I thought that I really wanted to get into this morning but somehow God was pulling me a different way not sure what he's gonna do this evening I don't consider myself as some great deep preacher but one thing I do know if you hear what's being preached you won't miss the rapture [Music] you said brother boots how can you say that because I know I'm being led by God and if there be anybody in here that really believes that they're gonna make a rapture I know the course that God is broadly I know what he's doing I see what he's doing but you got to be a believer you got to believe that in all the knowledge that you have God has brought you here brought me here to add to it not take away you know it's just as simple as that because most of you may be in your head your understanding you may even know what we say the depth of this message more so than me but we have had so much meat it's time to work on the heart this is the time that God is trying to bring us to a perfection you see guarding said well the grace of God the grace of God is what protects you is what brings you to that perfection you and I can't go to heaven dirty it ain't happening we we know according to Peter we must come into the full statue of Christ I'm not saying that we won't be saved but I'm talking about the rapture how many I wouldn't make a rapture we're talking about rapture in material rapturing material we can't have attitudes we can't have you know this thing and you know I know some of us let me say it like this some of us in case is still being interpreted some of us amen are may not come you know on time because we want to skip song service we may not have the best song service but you can make it better if you come and add your voices add your worship it gets better right now it's so easy to the standards at whoa you know I can remember time we didn't even have a piano player we didn't at time one time didn't have a guitar player but God is still adding and my point is you need to come in and your portion every one of you is important to this assembly every one of you and your your participant your your presence is necessary for God otherwise he wouldn't have placed you here is that right remember he could not even go any further with this conference with the twelve disciples after his eleven disciples after his resurrection and he says except Peter be there so when we miss could we be hindering God when we come late can we be hindering God and God want to do something but he can't do it because you're not here yet think about these things every one of you is important and I think that you need to see that that God has placed you here for a purpose and that purpose only God knows and you would know but I really believe that God is doing a work here you want to make a rapture all I can tell you is this only to divine nature is that right even brother Branham said God is coming back for character character nothing more nothing less he's coming for character and is his character he's coming back for me and we've got to have them we must have you know what he calls for denying yourself morning your will to be done father God as we come we thank you again for your amazing grace we thank you for the beauty of holiness knowing that is not our holiness but your holiness bless the people once again give them understanding Lord that where there is unity there is strength we need each other to be pleasing unto the Lord bless us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen one more song before we leave in the blood of Christ my Lord we have the victory in the in the in the in the in in the [Music] victory I think [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] before I go I would felt led about the Holy Spirit to say this I know some of you all work at night and sometime you come in late I understand you doing your best calm still I know that now when we saying coming in late we're talking about people who are dragging their feet yeah you know you could be on time but you want to stop for a doughnut and coffee that's what we're talking about you know because I do understand the old work schedule some of y'all it's just different you can't help but for those of us who can get the donut coffee afterwards I promise you you won't stop the death you love in the heart we appreciate you amen we let our brother dismiss by God let's sing a song desire to be near to him
