good I will regard for baby bad he has he is mainly glass who are weary thoughts oh yes baby [Music] amen I will rejoice amen I I was told that different ones was going to come to service tonight but it looked like somehow the enemy has hindered them but anyway I had these thoughts on my heart in my mind and I've known that these brothers wanted to understand baptism and so some of my message will be dealing with that but we're still dealing with the truth of God's Word and we must realize by God's grace that everything in his word is true and so we thank God for His grace let us turn to first Timothy please 1st Timothy 3:16 all of God's Word is yay or nay and you and I must realize by God's grace that we are those who have been enlightened by the Word of God we are here to magnify the message in which God brought through Malachi 4 we must always know that there was always a prophet inner prophet the Prophet himself is Jesus Christ as the Son of Man is the Lord Jesus Christ yet the Prophet is a son of man revealing the son of man so we thank God for His amazing grace is this okay I don't know how the volume is coming I mean I like it but if it's too loud for you first Timothy please first Timothy 3:16 so we know that the revelation of the Godhead is not something that can be studied into I intended to actually bring forth some pen and paper pens and paper tonight because I kind of want to do a little little teaching kind of slowly take us through it so but we Steve will and those of you who can commit everything to your memory you do well so first Timothy 3:16 all scripture first Timothy 3:16 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness so first of all it is a mystery God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory God and we know who that God is that God is the Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated Heavenly Father we so thank you for the reading of your word we pray father that you would bless the service in a special way forgive us for having the people see sit before praying but father we're just human flesh sometimes we do make mistakes but all we just pray right now in your honor and in your name that you would have free preeminence here tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen because we realize amen in 1st Corinthians if you want to turn there five three six says for their though there be that are called gods and there are many people who are called God's whether in heaven or in earth as there be God's many and Lords many but to us there is but one God the Father of whom are all things we in him and one Lord Jesus Christ but whom are all things and we by him and brother Adam has taught us that when it comes to God hello him we know that God is a spirit we know that they that worship God must worship Him in spirit and truth God leaves no room for error that's why I say it's yay or nay God is a revelation you can't even know God except he revealed it to you when it comes to sacrifices you don't even know what to offer God except it be revealed to you if we go back to Genesis we find out that the only thing that God will accept would be worship around the lamb because remember at the end of the day in in Revelation it is the Lamb who was worshipped lamb worship or in use of in worship as far as sacrifice lamb worship is used in worship as far as sacrifice according to the book of Revelation and we know who the lamb represents that's Jesus Christ we realize by God's grace amen that we are God's are we gods the Bible tells us that we are sons of God yet we are not Elohim but we are part of Allah here we are his attributes we are his the manifestation of who Elohim would be today you understand me let me say it again we are the metaphor station of elohim of what elohim would be in this day in this age that's who we are we didn't come by joining a church we did not come by you know joining a lodge or anything like that the only way that you and I can be part of him we must be born again you cannot even be born again except you were with him before the foundation of the world so you and I must understand that God is all and in all the Bible tells us according to Ephesians 4 4 through 6 it says there is one body and one spirit even as you are called into one hope one hope of your calling see truth is always one you never have two answers that's right only one answer could be right one plus one is true that will never change because that is the only answer that could be correct so is with God there aren't there are not two answers to one question there always one answer that's why Jesus say let your conversation be yay or nay truth is always one and truth will always prevail over err like light over darkness there is one body doesn't matter how many denominations there are and how many claim to be a part of Christ there is only one way to be a part of the body the Bible says by one baptism and that's not water baptism that's baptism of the Holy Ghost by one spirit are we all baptized into one body one spirit which is the holy spirit which is God there are not two holy spirits there's only one holy spirit they are not three divine persons there's only one person and that one person is God alone but we realize Amen that the that the Godhead is a mystery to many because even to this day people still think he's three persons when God is only one they don't get it they don't understand who he is because they don't know him only the true children of God will ever come to know who God is Jesus the Bible said that Jesus knew him because he was with him from the beginning he was he was in him the Bible's according to Saint John 17 tells us that Jesus Christ was glorified amen in the father before he ever came to earth so you understand by God's grace if Jesus Christ was glorified in the father before he came to earth so were you but the Menem tells us that not only were we chosen elected but we were glorified in Christ in the seventeenth chapter of Saint John Jesus says father I would that they have the same glory that we had together in the beginning see there's only one Lord there's only one faith and that faith is in that Lord and that one baptism is in his name but you got to understand by God's grace when we talk about the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we must understand that we are including God the Trinity not three people but we're talking about three offices the Bible tells us according to Matthew 28:19 now I'm moving faster than I want it to move because we don't have the visitors here so I can just be Matthew 28:19 says go ye therefore right baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and Holy Ghost and that is the only way that we know how to baptize every person I've ever baptized has been baptized in that name in that name in that name not in the titles we don't use titles but you know I found a quote this morning amen in question and answer so I think that what it was I can find it again where brother Branham used to baptize in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost and he also talked about Trinity being three persons even though he was a prophet he had to grow in his knowledge so you and I must understand that brother Branham in himself was not infallible it was on the only the word and God corrected the Prophet just like he corrects us so we realized Amen that when it comes to one God the Bible says there's one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in all i'ma say it again one God and Father now because he said one God and Father does it make him - absolutely not he's showing that God has become a father so God being perfect he has to recognize his transitions or his changes so that people can understand I am God and I'm your father cuz God is God of everybody but God is not everybody's father God has not forgotten everyone right so he's not everybody's father so he has to say God and Father to those who he is God and Father remember by God's grace that even in the book of Isaiah the Word of God tells us that the God who is our Creator it's also our husband see so now God is not only our Father he is also our husband and how does that happen is how is the way God unfolds himself like brother Adam said God comes down and he begins to 1:4 old himself because really with our brains and our understanding and our intelligence we would never be able to conceive or even understand God had not he become one of us so that was the very intent of Adam being made that the invisible God would be seen by creation this is why we are made that the invisible God may be seen in this age right so let's go on James 2:19 now believe it that there is one God that do it well the devil also believe and tremble so we don't have nothing over the devil by believing in one God right see even the devil so it's more foolish to believe in three than it is to believe in one I'm so glad is one mother Mike I wouldn't know how to serve three I'm having a time serving one hallelujah but to understand a man that God condescending as brother and says here he was fatherhood right God fatherhood he comes down he descends his son because son really was just a creation of the house of God the Bible says that by one blood God created one blood it was God he said we're a body who go to build a temple for me but a body I have prepared see so actually when when when when when God stood there in Jesus Jesus and God was the same because the Bible said the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in him the fullness of God but was was heaven bank-robber lutely not because God is a spirit and there is no way that you could ever borrow God up don't you know that even amen in heaven when we when is all over brother Ellen said God's Jesus Christ was set on the throne and the pillar of fire be above his head but you're not looking at two you look at that one it's the same concept that you and I have when it comes to the bride there's one bride but the Bible tells us that there are a number of them that there's no way that we can number them yet God is still so infinite he can be above Christ he can be in Christ he can be in a multi-million being tree and whatever people and still there's more of him see because he feels all time and space there's nothing outside of God I was talking to some people today kind of the ones who I thought would be here tonight anyway I told them that when the Holy Spirit corrected me because I was thinking I said well when when Adam God said Adam Adam we're out there I thought I said well you know I God because Adam was in a place that God had never been but that can't be correct because God has been everywhere but Adam was in a place that he Adam had never been that's the correct way of saying it Adam had never experienced darkness or being separated from God neither had Adam ever experienced being naked so God was asking Adam the question and Adam asked answered the question correctly you know you think I would say I was in the bush hiding he didn't he said I'm hiding because I'm what naked so that was a place that out of had never been he had never been in a place where he was naked and then God said it to Adam who told you you was naked who see there is a serpent there and if we could catch a hold of that that serpent who was the Beast in Genesis is also the beast in Revelation see hidden in Genesis but revealed revelation everything is revealed in Revelation the serpent that was in the garden is now called a man in Revelation so if he was a man in Revelation he's a man in Genesis see so we understand there's only one God there's only one devil real devil Satan himself we call him Lucifer everything under him our demons right so there's only one God one devil one beast like I said in Genesis 3:1 3:11 I'm gonna read it now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made reason why I'm doing this because I want to show you the value of what you know maybe you never thought about the value oh we think oh well we're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ don't you understand that when you say that you're saying amen to the Father Son and the Holy Spirit that's why it's so important to say Lord Jesus Christ right because now you are making manifest you are manifesting what Matthew 819 right because see you can't leave that out you can't say that's not important because without that you wouldn't have this and I won't prove that in just a moment because even when Jesus gave Amen that formula to the disciples they didn't have no idea of what he was talking about Matthew 28:19 y'all know that because you understand Jesus had to open their understanding to the scripture they didn't understand they only believed in one God but now you gonna tell me to go baptize in the name of the Father Son and of the Holy Ghost they didn't know even though Peter said thou art the Christ he still did not understand Matthew 28:19 none of them did it was at resurrection Jesus gave them the revelation of who you speaking on okay that's why it's so powerful that's why when you know whenever I baptized I baptized using Matthew 28:19 and acts 2:38 because I read Matthew 28:19 and that most of the time and then I said fulfilling that I now baptize you according to acts 2:38 because it's important that people understand those scriptures come together they don't contradict the one or the other women senators the serpent then in that cup now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die so he changes God's Word by adding the word not we've heard that many times but just just see the concept like I said even the prophet of God says say it like I say it say like the tape says it but he's working with Revelation because if you say it just like he said it doesn't mean you understand what he said because remember there's a false witness amen in the Jesus trial did y'all know that they said he said he could tear this temple down and raise it up in three days did not he said he said it but they did not have the revelation of what he was saying so they became false witness but the round Center you cannot even be a witness of something unless you've been there this you up in the cavalry how can you be a witness if you've never been there right when you receive the Holy Ghost proves that you've been the Calvary that's what makes you a witness after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you he said you would then become witnesses of me to know that I died and rose again and I'm living now in you one God thank God not three brother thank God not three can you imagine three gods living you discussing what they're gonna do for you and see and that's where we we many people have gotten caught up and it tangled up you know in the message and I was just discussing this with the brothers in Iowa City brother Branham says that a prophet preaches by inspiration and I am an amateur profit but the Troy is an amateur profit every true preacher that's called by God we are amateur prophets not that we are a major profit but we are profit because we prophesy when we preach that's what brother Branham said and we must realize by God's grace amen that you and I must understand that inspiration how many times the prophet of God spoke and when he didn't even know what the serpent seed was the Holy Spirit dropped down on him he said it was a serpent he himself didn't nobody had said he had to go and look it up and then he found the scripture that vindicated the inspiration Paul said even if a angel from heaven come to you and tell you something don't believe it unless you check it with the ureter it's in the book and whatever he's so you must be given to you in understanding of Revelation is that right I believe his Hebrew six tip the proper God said he didn't understand that Scripture no it was one it was the one that if you say to this mountain be thou move whatever you say he said even though he's seen it he never preached it until God revealed it to it he boosts our six I believe Allah says the rain falls on the just and the unjust and and you know how I bring forth and one is nigh unto burning and all of that kind of stuff hey man it was winging he was at the Pentecostal meeting and he saw two people prophesy one was a devil and one was born again he went into his cave is that God I don't understand this how can this be he said all of a sudden the wind blew two pages it was always in the word and that's what happens I believe sometimes I'm inspired to say things I didn't even know brother Branham said then down the road I see oh my god the prophecy so you and I must understand we all of us who are born again truly born again we've got the same Holy Ghost there brother man had that Jesus had that Paul had that's why Paul could come out of the desert with a greater revelation Peter said even some of the things that Paul said was hard to understand so you understand him and we are at liberty now we can't be like some of these people so well well I don't need no preacher to teach me because about said the Holy Spirit is your ocean you don't need no man to teach you but see out of context you can you can literally do not part of the word which is the fivefold ministry we need teachers for God does not know and in that day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be God's knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open now in an amazing their eyes were open to era it was open but the I was already open but now the eyes that there are that are open is open to era open to sin open to seed things that God did not want them to see you see them saying so now they experiencing some kind of enlightenment and anyway so what's so wicked about it is their enlightenment is because they failed it comes out of failure so how great can this become how great can it become this great revelation I have failed and now I see what is good and evil oh it was just a beginning I cannot imagine what he felt when she had her first baby I know she thought about the moment she broke the word it's no doubt in her mind the devil probably said she is not only Yui but every woman that comes after you will experience this they didn't have no interspecies they didn't have no what they call a ways to block the pain later she got the whole blunt of it think about it an atom not even knowing I think some time I'm like Lord how did you teach him that how did they know to cut the umbilical cord how did they know to do this that they've never done before you know God was there he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you and just assures the revelation of Eve okay the revelation of how deliver baby came with it see there's all in one God one way this Bible is the truth he not be mixed with psychology it can't I'm saying this for a reason they cannot be mixed with psychology it cannot be mixed with them what's that other word anyway people you know they have this intellectual ability they they think they they could you know take things and make mix it in other words I'm saying you can't mix it it has to remain in the concept of how in the way it was said that's why I thank God for the voice on the tapes because I can hear the way God says it because you could take a quote and you can make it say whatever you want to say but when you hear the way God says it then you understand that quote was reused in the wrong way y'all y'all hear me I'm not talking about nobody here I'm just saying that's how I've learned that's why I try to tell people if you don't watch the way it's here the spirit that's what the Bible says he that have an ear to hear what the Spirit says to the church the spirit one spirit what God's saying to the church right because the Devils intent is to take us off of what we know is true and he doesn't waver like this it's just a little way hmm that's why some people think brother Branham is God that's why some people worship in his name you see them saying because it is a fine line right there are times you know listen if we walk in the flesh like that man walked in the fresh people would try to worship us Paul said they did the same to him they looked upon him as he was Jesus Christ himself right John and they're in the book of Revelation fell down it that a verse feet and then you said don't worship Me you of your brethren I'm a prophet I'm your brother I'm like you are you get up and worship God see so it is an a tendency for the bride to worship William Branham but the correct worship goes to God you see so we shouldn't look at him like something really wrong that's what John did he first worshiped the angel that has to be fulfilled right and the eyes of them were open and they knew that they were naked and that they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard Amen heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the ether I love that word walking in the garden showing that he was a person it wasn't just a wink brother branham identifies that person he said that was the Tree of Life that was Jesus Christ himself before he was born yeah God can do what he wants to do and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden and the Lord God called him to Adam and said unto Him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself in that amazing the voice of God when you wrong will always make you afraid always it'll do something to your heart like today when I said I was telling those brothers about God being in our place that thing just did not feel right I'm like I know I'm saying it wrong but what am I supposed I say it I know what I'm trying to say thank God down the road after things settled and I was by myself he said this is how you say it so I said well Lord I gotta correct it with those brothers and he said who who told thee that I was naked he's just hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou she does not eat see who was liken to him think about it who is liken unto God Satan incarnated even as Judas was the son of perdition right so you got to understand you got two trees in the beginning you still have two trees you have a tree of life you have the tree of lot of knowledge and good and evil and the only way that you will make it to heaven you must eat of the tree of life if you continue to eat off the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that is death it was death in the beginning is death in the ending and the tree of knowledge and good and evil is do what what does it do it changes the meaning of the word by adding or subtracting that's why the Bible says if you add the plagues will be added to you if you should attract your name will be taken out of the book because adding and taking away is absolutely the manifestation of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil we are at war and a lot of us don't even understand acts 2:38 it will be the thing that will get you in trouble the very thing that you think means nothing I won't say you don't think means nothing we just don't put enough emphasis on it go to most message churches you don't even hear him preach it alright well first of all we hardly ever have visitors right think suddenly I don't think a lot of people realize and understand the God here great is the mystery of godliness see I've had people say well well how can it be one first of all you don't even know the kind you know what most of us think like like Jesus only that's why we don't get it we thank God is like one is your finger right and as long as you think God is one like your finger you'll never understand God he's in you all he's above all that's God so he can never be this and it's a revelation there's a true revelation of God to know that God a man has brought you to a place where you go and he's unveiling himself in such a way see only the Prophet could have unveiled it because that's a corner Amos Amos 3 right I can't do nothing except I reveal my secrets to my servant the Prophet so you and I must understand by God's grace there was no way we could have even conceived he's right now even though even God magnified the prophet of magnified his revelation or understanding of the the Godhead we remember brother MC Mussina the three rainbows and God got in those rainbows I explained and showed him that his own Trinity y'all don't remember that it's in there see so you when I say Trinity see you're always thinking in your mind three persons no sir brother branham cut that down he said he went to the Father Son and Holy Ghost he said three the best way I can explain it God manifested himself in three divine offices but it still was one God so you and I must understand in order to understand that's why a lot of people at the end of the day and I'm arenas few scriptures in the moment at the end of the day y'all gotta understand that the devil has the Trinity - and what the devil does is that because I was baptized I was baptized at the age of twelve I was the Reverend fair WM fair FAI are that was his name he said I now baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost and he took me down and he brought me up and the Holy Spirit at that time I didn't know it was the Holy Spirit said to me what is the name the name has to be said right you cannot fulfill that Scripture by just using titles you have to use the name it's like I said go shut the door and you say go shut the door you didn't do what I said dude you just repeated what I said but if you go over there and you shut the door then you did what I said okay you can't leave out Matthew 28:19 and you definitely can't leave out acts 2:38 that's why I use them both is that okay because I want people to realize and to understand I'm not talking about three guys I'm talking about one the Lord acts 2:38 is the answer to the equation of Matthew 28:19 that's the best way to say you got equal Lord Jesus Christ name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost Father plus son plus Holy Ghost equals the Lord Jesus Christ that's the way that's the way that that's the way the equation work okay and there was given unto him a mouth speaking let it go and they worship the Dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshipped the Beast saying who is likened unto the Beast and who is able to make war with him let me tell you something we must we must understand that Trinitarian doctrine is so strong my knees are my nephew's wife she had read the Bible all the life she told me as a child she sitting there in a bed room reading the Bible back wasn't forces I can tie you up in Scripture and still she thought they were three and when we were going through this issue she said they they know who I am and when she said there's oh my god I said you don't even know God if you saying they you don't know him and even in the you got people who believe in his too that's just as wrong when God was able to oh the Lord said unto my lord sit thou my god have mercy sit down there right here what you need is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will reveal that Scripture he ain't talking about no - but God I put it like that just a stub of the intellectual hmmm why they don't have a problem with knowing that there's one devil everybody know there's one devil but why do you want to make God three not that is the devil he 1 because the devil know if you think brother oshi brother been saying like this almost dare you to come in in the presence of God believing in three gods he dare you if you put up dare you come i remember those three dare you come in the presence of God believing that there's three gods or in the Trinity how he said it but he used the word dare you come see there was a time God winked at ain't ignorant when brother man was on the time on the scene they were Trinitarians who had the Holy Ghost there was one this is who had the Holy Ghost different ones had the Holy Ghost so he tried to explain to them is not the doctrine that you know not not safe but he says now is the Holy Ghost you're baptized into that one body but look it proved that they didn't have it in their soul because when the showdown came they all walked away there's a time where the Holy Ghost laid in their spirit it was good enough but when the truth come when perfection came which was the opening of the word when it that which is perfectly column all these other things is put away God don't wink at our ignorance anymore the only that keeps a man I'll make a foolish version his election is that right the only thing the only thing that that that keeps the foolish version foolish version is election they were part of the pattern they were part of the material and God chose not to bring him into the making of the garment if they weren't part of the material they're lost completely period that's all that's the way I see it an understanding he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and then that King that brother a brother was telling me the other day a sister in a message who've been in long years ago said to him Jesus is not God a message believer when the prophet of God argued that so many a time with different people some people think he was denying some people think he was just a prophet some people think he was just son of God and that's all he were he was God here's God and when you get to heaven the only thing about Ellingham you're gonna see is the pillar of fire and Jesus Christ but this devil has started a war he started a war in the in Genesis and you know what he started in heaven first and what you and I are now experiencing for the man said those angels that fell are demons and the angels that stood a man are you you stood with him and because we stood with him in the giving he stands with us now why because sin struck us with amnesia and now the message has come to take it away to make us remember who we are where we came from and why we must be born again a true believer amen will never reject the formula that God has set here for us even though it is just the outward works hello baptisms us now save us the Bible says not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but an answer of a good conscience toward God that's Peter so being baptized in water does not wash away your sins only the blood right when Jesus blood dropped on the ground brother Owen said it's safe to fight the whole earth hey man so it is a blood that sanctifies you and only those who have been ordained to be sanctified will be sanctified is that right only those who are ordained to receive the Holy Ghost will recede oligos God has this thing because see y'all think what God made it dude no no no no you're choosing from the beginning it's what we are now experiencing hallelujah and it was given to him to make war with whom the Saints and to overcome them and power was given over all Kindred's tongues and nations well I would God do that and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world now that is yay-yay-yay all whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the fact I don't care how religious you could be like Buddha and everybody else you're spilling car Nowhere if your name is not written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and that in itself must be a revelation because we are faulty creatures as up as we are but you have a have a revelation and you I don't know why I'm bright but I know that I am because that's the only way you're gonna know when God reveals to you it to you as a individual and when that revelation come that is the Holy Ghost huh not here oh god I'm gonna be lost here it ought to be something in you that no matter what Satan comes with it cannot touch that ground because that ground in your soul is holy ground this is not a sinful soul it is a holy soul trapped in a sinful body and that's what the devil is the devil knows amen he how to lead us into captivity like I was telling somebody every bad habit I heard brother Adam said like this he said every bad habit is a demon I'm paraphrasing and the other time Christian don't want to believe they got demons but they said well I gotta have it that's demonic it's the devil controlling your life you can't get through it that is a devil holding you so in order to be free you got to get free free of the habit and the only way you can be free through the blood of Jesus that's why he came the Holy Ghost has come to sanctify you he said I sanctify you through what your truth Emme and God's Word is true and if you read the Word of God God to tell you there's certain things they won't make heaven and if you've got a hole if something bad got a hold on you you got to get rid of it Oh Lord see you know probably God said you know we want God to do all the work but you gotta do something he's not gonna pull you through a hole or whatever you might think you've got alert Joshua I have given you the land but you gonna have to fight for it's yours Joshua and everywhere you place your foot you possess it but I want you to understand there's a Giants on the land but I have given you the authority and the ability to kill them all see that's how it is you said oh I can't overcome you are overcome if you say your ride you are overcome because only the overcomers can will be included in the ride overcome a the lust of the flesh unless they are the pride of life it's got to be done so well how I'm gonna do it get the Holy Ghost if I'm right and I know the proper God is and I believe he's right I know he's right he said in a future home that that Holy Ghost comes and he burns out all the Devils hmm that don't mean sometimes the devil don't come back and lodge in your spirit cuz you open the gate that right he said the devil can't come in to you you got to go out to him now when you let the devil into your spirit you've got to get him out of there how you gonna get him out of there fire water don't cleanse him out you can baptize you seven times a day and you still be demonic possessed the only thing is fire and how you gonna get fire on your knees the Bible said in the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever you mean to tell me all these preachers that baptizing name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost who believe in the Trinitarian doctrine and believe that see they don't understand that was adopted by the Catholic Church that's that ain't nothing but bail is bail ISM that's why God called one a who was Jezebel and her daughter amen what when was a whole other ones a prostitute what was it whoring huh harlot yeah say yeah you don't say Wow cuz Jezebel was a prostitute now what was Jezebel worship Bay lism she worshipped bail and if she were Chappell all these denominations because they split got up at the three worshiping and brother Balaam said it did he at the end almost at the end of his journey he said one day they're gonna come to find out that they're worshiping the devil thinking they're worshiping God why because you could only worship God in spirit and in truth see what I'm saying see how blessed you are and that's why they gonna come out the people like you who really believe in the baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ or the revelation of Matthew 28:19 how do you wanna see it you're gonna get in trouble because you will not bow to the image you can't bow to the image you know too much take my head off that's what I told those brothers this evening this afternoon I said cut my head off I know too much I've seen too much do you think I'm gonna be afraid of a man who can just kill me when I know that it ain't the end I'm gonna announce to God that girl I'm gonna meet once they cut my throat whatever they do I gotta meet him come on Oh a foolish man surely the pain won't be pleasant but it be temporal yeah every short short cut and understand every every habit that's bad is unclean the Bible says that I saw the three unclean spirits like frogs so what is it what you're saying everybody that believes in the Trinity and believe it in the way they do they are being led by unclean spirits that's why the Bible said Babylon has become a cage of all the others ain't nothing good happening in there this man taking that man's wife and this one taking that man's wife they swap and shop sad to see it but that's the way it is you think that people can dress like that and not be overtaken by lust let's get real you think the preaching back there having a party he's preaching it's the truth brother it's the truth there is no way you can let these women sit up on the role like they do with them short thing and not having thoughts in your mind and that's all what those people do now thank God for holiness thank God for holiness and now we can get the sisters to not the dress which soap the tight stuff we'd be alright brothers I know y'all gotta drop your eyes even in here uh you know you know I'm only I'm being recorded so I can't see but I'm gonna tell you something it's a shame I don't care who it is my family somebody has a family it doesn't matter it's a shame that we are representing holiness and we have to drop our eyes because our sisters are not that's error they are believing a lie and God said if they don't come to believe the truth God will give them a strong delusion and even among us message to people we found people dressing all kind of way so it doesn't matter you know it fits hardly fits oh god help us it's unclean unclean spirits now I'm working with one God I'm working with truth I'm working with yay I'm working with name and there is no compromise there is no great areas this is a black or white and you not must understand Oh was she just or he just no he got to get right or she got a got to get right or hell would be their portion you saw all brother Brooks I'm bride bride bride bride brother said they've been brides and brides and bull bride bride bride and none of them was bride who said he were bride bride is not a figure of speech bride is a manifestation of a vindication if the prophet of God had to be vindicated he was a prophet you got to be vindicated your bride just live out any kind of way to say I'm right no you're not until the life of God vindicate in you you're right that's the only way it's the vindication you'll never be a vindicated a man without the Holy Ghost there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against see you don't have to worry about the devil's children we know what you know all these denominational people who and they can out quote you right oh yeah didn't know the scripture that's nothing did not the devil know the scripture even he twisted a little bit with the word right he comes up to Jesus and try to attempt Jesus with the word he twists it think about it when Jesus came who was in the pulpit Devils the great definitive doctors of divinity was standing right there in the door and Jesus said you hold the truth in unrighteousness meaning that you know I am the truth and you will not accept it and you're standing in the door so others will not accept it this America who has experienced the Ministry of Malachi for and have experienced amen the Ministry of Luke 1730 they know they knew he was a prophet they knew he was Malachi 4 even though they didn't want to accept it why they love the filter lucre jesus said you haven't changed he said you want to be reverence you want you want the praise of men and forget about the praise of God that's what it is hey Rev Oh Bishop how you doing see they love that kind of stuff they loved it then they love it now it's sad to say it's coming to this message that men in the message are beginning to like and enjoy the praise of men it's it creeps it's just don't happen all of a sudden it crease it got so bad all said Paul said I didn't baptize no yeah I didn't die for you why are you following me see ain't no great ones among this message the only great one is the Lord Jesus Christ I'm not great don't want to be thought of being as being great if you only know the battles I go throughout the day ooh ain't nothing great I'm just what's great about me is that God is giving me great grace that's all it is it's just okay cuz you got to understand what people don't understand in this message they do not understand brother Branham said amen and he's working and quoting Ezekiel whether death angel is coming in and he's mocking everybody you're right the man with the slaughtering weapon in his hand and he said don't spare young or old children grandpa you know don't don't spare nobody everybody that doesn't have the mark of God in their forehead kill them and that's what people even in this mess all you you can quote brother Branham you can quote the scriptures are called Nepal I mean you can rattle the scriptures off like any intellectual preacher can do but if you don't have the Holy Ghost rather than say you're gonna get the mark of the beast everybody that doesn't get the Holy Ghost get the mark of the beast and when you get the marketer beat you're lost and they don't see the importance Oh you saw all I shouted that's my brother and said don't let this devil deceive you this is his age this is the age of deception or spoken toast if you don't live it that's nothing oh I shouted if you don't live it that's nothing oh I ran down the house if you don't live it that's nothing oh i preach the gospel if you don't live it that's nothing well I said it's got to be the life and that's the only thing to devil can't duplicate divine love be copied cuz the Barlow is tested hey hey somebody that's Jo named a man whether we like it or not that's why the pulses make your calling and election sure see the Lord NORs them that I here's having this seal it's gotta be a seal God searches everything everything that has the seal is that right is that right just like the angel went down to Egypt everything that had the blood on the doorpost of the lintel that was the thing he bypassed nowadays it's the seal it's the sealing of the Holy Ghost oh I got it in my spirit I got in my flesh you better make sure it's in your soul I'm gonna read this this cold I had a futile mean but I'm just gonna read this one this is quite a long one anyway coming out of the churches but in the age after the church goes home he becomes a beast he becomes a devil incarnated the red dragon himself oh my can't you see what I mean he is incarnated in his people then what just like God is going to incarnated himself in us the devil is gonna incarnate himself in his people is that right did not the devil incarnated himself in in Hitler and then he did it to the Germans Oh y'all come home those people were spellbound they had been uh I could say a spell had been cast on those German don't tell me I know some that they didn't even know what was going on it's like you been spare about and all of a sudden when Hitler was dead and everything was over they shook himself oh my god what have I done is that right see that's how it is with any devil adultery fornication whatever any lascivious act after the devil is complete he didn't opens your eye and leaves you alone then accuse you that's what he does but that's how a devil overtakes you the same way Hitler got the della overtook them right so you guys what do you mean why do you think the Bible says it means these these chargers that will be loosed having hair like women to torment people where do you think who do you think these are demons that has fallen that used to be angels that used to say holy holy holy unto the Lord has now become an army against the Lord you know what they come to determine who they don't remain all Satan's children see that's how he treat here's God give us heaven Satan give his children hell right that's it that might sound like a little wrong but that's what it's right it's what it is God gives his children heaven Satan gives his children here can I continue read em oh listen the prof prophets had prophesied them right into it see what he said wait it's the preachers that leading the people into destruction that's what Jesus said if the blind leaders lead the blind they both shall fall in a ditch so it's the leaders innocent people following their preachers because the preacher said is that right brother mom tells us stories amen of how young ladies who believe in their preachers in their lives at the at the time of death their eyes were open see everybody eyes will be open at the end of the day everybody eyes is going to be open to the truth the false prophet prophesized them right into it give them over to strong delusions to believe Allah and to be damned by it denying the word with with a form of godliness God's works God works his place in a Trinity justification sanctification Incarnation himself incarnated himself in his people oh my god he said when Jesus incarnated himself in his people the very life that was in Christ is in the person what would it do if you took the life of out of a great vine and put it in a pumpkin vine it wouldn't be a pumpkin no more it would bear grapes what if you took the life out of a peach tree and put it in a pear tree would it bear pears no bear peaches the life tells what it is when you say here people are saying that they got the Holy Ghost and denies this word there is something wrong the Holy Ghost wrote that word hmm and Jesus said if a man has my spirit in him he'll do my works you want to read that you want to put it down it's st. John 14:12 yes he that believeth of me the work that I do shall he do also even more than this shall he do for I go to my father see he sanctifies and clears him so he can stand before God that drop of ink falls there and takes him across the chasm huh now watch Satan when he incarnated himself in his subjects they do the work that he did don't you see what did he do come right to that innocent woman to deceive her right that's what the preachers are doing coming to innocent people who desire to see God and deceiving them that's exactly what some of these Devils do come right into a place and say a little pastor get started how somewhere come in and say oh if you just join up with us uh-huh see the same devil work now the truth and when Satan becomes incarnate in his church to be a devil then they they are the ones that does the murdering and killing and so forth because Satan is the killer right in the first place what does Satan do when he does when he comes be incarnated amongst the people it is the duty to be shrewd he is true you search the Bible and you see and you should show me where God ever dealt with intellectual people hunt it for me and see if it isn't always the intellectuals that devil possess if a big it's a big word but it's true I chose you to take see that lineage from able to Cain and then from for fourteen generations run them out and see which one was on the smart side and which one was on the hummer one see that's what people don't understand it has been the intellectual Devils in this message that has caused the Holy Ghost to flee it's the truth they took that quote and that brother that took that quote the Holy Ghost without sensation they made it just on that part and never came back to the life of Christ if you're gonna have the Holy Ghost without sensation which has always been the Holy Ghost has never come with sensation because in your soul there are no feelings rather than said in your soul there's faith or doubt so when the Holy Ghost comes it doesn't call sensation but as it venture out or up it passed through the spirit hallelujah through the flesh that's why Jesus said I will be like a whale springing up and hearties is striking that soul and coming up but when it comes up that's when the shouting that's when the dancing that's when the crying that's when you know by feeling something has happened to you but the feeling comes after the birth the birth don't bring the feelings faith brings the birth that's way brother been taught it that's we're always there he just revealed it to us and he threw it out there to stumble the people that's what I believe he knew what he was doing he knew the intellectuals have grabbed that cuz he said I just ran it he said that's what happened in in in the SEC second see he said he said those intellectuals start coming in there and they wanted to get it get rid of all of those one that jump and shout and have those great times they didn't want that that was embarrassing to them and that's exactly the way the message is a lot of places you start jumping and shouting and having the one I'm talking about America I don't know about nowhere else I just know here you start shouting and praising the Lord a lot of times people look at you they do just what the Methodists and all they crane they next I see it I've seen it because of the intellectuals now the brother who brought took that quote I cuz I remember when I came to the message almost every church in the message that I had gone to had gifts in operation that were working Holy Spirit coming down falling people being healed when I came into the message well and once that quote started floating around among the intellectuals I could tell you it started even in in Ohio you know at the church that were considered Mecca and now that brother don't even believe the message don't even believe it and every time he preached for me I should say there's something wrong I kept saying about their Lord there's something wrong even though he preached he is something missing now I know you know you love Lord I used his wrong one a scripture in i'ma let you go 2nd Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that I hear and let every one that name it the name of Christ depart from iniquity he didn't say sin he's an iniquity iniquity when you know to do good and you don't do it deepali few these things I had oh I had so much I still do but you know I want to say this by the grace of God we are so blessed if you ever see how beautiful this situation is I was trying to tell somebody when brother brother said the move is on the bride a lot of people don't even know what he's saying they just think that you know we're here I don't know what they think I really don't but what he was saying is I've given the Pathan to the bride now the same God that worked at me we're working her Elijah and Elisha she gets a double portion of a light job see if something's wrong brother cuz look at all of the many works that God did through Elijah and Elisha was supposed to be a double portion brother and says twice as many the greater works is not greater or more of its praying time it's playing time you love Lord we are blessed people and God is not unjust I was telling somebody the other day I said even as a pastor coming up in this message there are things I did not understand I thought I did and then when God revealed to me the reality of what everything was you know I went back and I made it right I remember one time I was Oh sisters she going with the Lord I don't think her thought about that was continued she may have changed he said every time I look around brother book she was a elder what was I supposed to say to her you get up to that people on that pulpit you always apologize and it empathy it wrong they ain't gonna have no confidence in you I said well if they lose confidence in me because I'm trying to make right the thing I made wrong then let them have no confidence for me but my whole thought about what I do is about him having confidence he's the only one that I have to stand before to get approval it's not your approval it gets me in heaven is his approval so you know I want to say by God's grace I always tell people I said you know what I don't mind being corrected nobody likes being corrected in the flesh but it is so we're grateful oh I've been corrected no momma whip you know you know like that would be Tom you saying so how do people say that you know it doesn't affect me it does but one thing I know I got the Holy Ghost you'll find me I'm gonna always repent when I'm wrong because the Holy goes are you gonna let me do nothing else you love the Lord we appreciate you because I never tried to make me disappoint it because my business didn't show up but I thought well you know anything could have happened Satan don't want them to know truth and they're so close right now so close it's part of this message I I kind of jumped and skipped because I felt like I was laying out something for them because of their questions and but nonetheless I hope you were were blessed the two brothers are interested in being baptized and I wanted to really lay it out for him tonight so that they could understand what how we do it and one which one used to be a Catholic and the other one I don't think he was not in he he didn't even we're gonna believe the Bible until I started talking to him and he came to church and ever since he'd come to church he'd been on fire telling everybody telling different ones about it because he said up until the end he couldn't see how he didn't see the reality of it but see this message makes it real makes it real it makes it up today's book and not some kind of history so I think y'all pray for him Jared and and Ryan I don't think we don't know where my caitlin stands I don't know where her interest is but she could be just busy because his school time she is a volleyball coach so pray for her she haven't spoken evil or anything neither of them have I just pray that God would keep bringing I've given one of them I think a church church age phone for his mom I need to give her one but anyway we're trying to get it out and trying to be wise in the way we do it they've seen brother Adam they seen the picture here the one in my house and nobody has asked any question as of yet so I don't know the question is going to come I've given them information so I'm just trusting that God will cook their soul see a they seem like pride to me but only God knows you love the Lord [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen I also heard brother vana talk about joking and gesturing you know I have a tendency of getting off on that he was telling his wife he says you know there's been three great men in America he's Abraham Lincoln George Washington and William Branham and his wife says bill don't you start - now he was just joking but he said the Holy Ghost convicted him and he had to go and pray that God would take that spirit off of him he said because once you do it he said it destroys you began to do I said all of that to say please pray for me that God will take that joking spirit away from me and make me more serious and consecrated unto the Lord sometimes you know things but you don't know things and if you think about it just the other day I was talking with some brothers and he's got a joking I say brothers it ain't gonna get better it's gonna get worse because once you start one joke it triggers everybody started joking and caring and all of a sudden somebody's offended so we're in there you know and so I said and I saw that thing I thought I saw a trick like that oh so why hey thank you Jesus thank you Father for showing me you know like the other day ours but we were coming in here I felt so convicted for that three days I think it was I just asked a lot of a that's and then I heard the tape because I was we were talking about how to anger the camera and I said well I want to make sure I'm in the pit you can hope then our brother much of the world oh where did that come from or something like that I can't remember Batum and in brotherto and I'm like oh my god I'm just carrying on but I'm convicting I'm convicted right then brother but I'm trying to show that I'm not but the Lord will not let that go because that was something that came so some truth was there see every joke carries truth certain amount of truth that's oh god that's pride or something didn't know I had it in there and I asked the Lord to take that out of my heart because I'm not here to be seen I don't care if I don't have a camera or nothing we've gone low down without it but whatever made me say that I just don't ever wear order to ever come out of her mouth again because the Lord did not like it he didn't we it wasn't we didn't I talk to everybody besides you you don't know when and God brought it up again so I can make it right with you though so forgive me for that Oh ain't God good to us all and brother come sings a song everybody does our prayer today you
