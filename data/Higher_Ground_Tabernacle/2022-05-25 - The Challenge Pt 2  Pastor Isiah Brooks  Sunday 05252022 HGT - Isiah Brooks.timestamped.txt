[42:39] but he saw where the church had gotten
[42:40] off track
[42:42] and you know at the end of his ministry
[42:44] practically the lord showed him that
[42:46] the laodicean church had gotten so far
[42:48] off track she didn't even know what she
[42:50] was worshiping
[42:51] and he saw that she was being led by a
[42:53] witch
[42:54] and she didn't even know it and she
[42:56] thought she was going to be going up
[42:59] yet she was going down
[43:01] and so with the bride of jesus christ we
[43:03] know who we being led by
[43:05] we're being led by the holy spirit
[43:08] by jesus christ himself
[43:10] uh thank god for
[43:13] all of the dreams and visions the
[43:15] prophet of god had that
[43:17] made us know that god was moving and
[43:19] using him and and we know that in 1963
[43:23] when the seventh angel the seven angels
[43:24] came down and made the pyramid and
[43:27] showed us that that was the face of
[43:28] jesus christ we understood that there
[43:30] was a turning point then
[43:32] and a lot of people in our day has not
[43:34] made that turn
[43:35] are they still trying to worship god in
[43:38] such a way because only they because
[43:40] they don't know him
[43:41] but the bible tells us that in this day
[43:43] his name will be called the word of god
[43:46] and that's how important it is
[43:48] that his name should be called the word
[43:51] of god but as we stand uh let us turn
[43:56] amen to saint john
[43:58] 6.
[43:59] we're going to go to saint john 6
[44:05] and we're going to begin reading at the
[44:07] 28th to the 35th verse now
[44:10] last week we we talked about uh
[44:13] being accepted in the beloved you and i
[44:15] know that the only way that you can ever
[44:17] be accepted in god is that you were with
[44:19] him before the foundation of the world
[44:21] this is not really a trial and error
[44:24] type of thing
[44:26] everything has been predestinated and
[44:28] you know ordered by god
[44:30] not that god made you such but by your
[44:32] own choosing
[44:34] while you in the mind of god you chose
[44:38] and because of those choosing now those
[44:40] things that you've chose to do is now
[44:42] being made manifest
[44:44] in your day now how god knows all of
[44:47] that he's god
[44:50] amen saint john 6 28
[44:53] and i'm glad about that because i don't
[44:55] i wouldn't want to try to
[44:57] uh have a seek salvation
[45:00] if there is a chance if it was by chance
[45:04] you understand what i'm saying because
[45:05] by chance i might lose
[45:08] and by chance i might fail
[45:11] you know we're born failures to begin
[45:13] with so we needed something really solid
[45:16] something that can secure us and assure
[45:19] us
[45:20] that our salvation is what it is
[45:23] and nothing can deter that nothing can
[45:25] change that nothing can alter that
[45:28] because if you were with him
[45:30] in his mind before the foundation of the
[45:32] world
[45:33] you'll be with him at the end
[45:35] remember he told his disciples i knew
[45:38] you
[45:39] before the foundation of the world
[45:41] before they were ever consumed in their
[45:43] mother's womb
[45:44] jesus knew them
[45:46] jeremiah i knew you i called you
[45:49] before you was even a in your mothers
[45:50] whom i call you to be a prophet
[45:53] i gifted you and i i fashioned you for
[45:56] the very hour and the day that you're
[45:58] going to live in and he was a man was
[46:01] not jeremiah a man so i want you to
[46:03] understand that everybody in this book
[46:06] were men and women such as we
[46:09] no they're born in a sin
[46:11] shaped in iniquities come out speaking
[46:14] lies and we all needed redemption
[46:17] all right
[46:19] listen paul couldn't have never done
[46:21] what he did
[46:22] without the god in him
[46:24] and you can't do what god wants you to
[46:26] do in this last day without god in you
[46:30] hallelujah saint john please saint john
[46:35] enjoying jesus what a powerful psalm
[46:37] because that's exactly what i've been
[46:38] doing
[46:40] enjoying jesus where in me
[46:43] enjoying jesus and me
[46:45] saint john the sixth chapter
[46:49] aren't you glad
[46:51] that we god don't have to roll dice or
[46:54] play cards or whatever the case may be
[46:58] you know any meaning mindy mo you know
[47:00] that kind of thing no no no no
[47:02] god
[47:04] knows and by his own choosing he chose
[47:06] us
[47:08] perfect choice a perfect choice
[47:11] and how can god take a people like us
[47:16] and make something out of him but you
[47:17] know i have you heard me say i'm gonna
[47:19] let you sit in just a moment but god
[47:21] loves to straighten out the mess
[47:24] right saint john 6 28
[47:29] i didn't mean to have you standing that
[47:30] long but as i say i'm just enjoying
[47:33] jesus
[47:34] then said they unto him what shall we do
[47:38] that we might work the works of god
[47:41] and jesus answered and said unto them
[47:44] this is the work of god
[47:46] that you believe on him whom he hath
[47:51] sent now jesus didn't say if you just
[47:54] believe on me
[47:55] he said believe on him whom god has sent
[48:00] right
[48:01] they said therefore unto him what signs
[48:08] shall we
[48:10] thou
[48:11] look for
[48:12] that we may see and believe thee
[48:15] what does thou what does thou work
[48:19] he said our father did eat manna
[48:22] our fathers did eat manna in the desert
[48:25] as it had written he gave them bread
[48:28] from heaven to eat
[48:30] and then jesus said unto them verily
[48:32] verily i say unto you moses gave you not
[48:36] the bread from heaven
[48:37] but my father giveth you the true bread
[48:40] from heaven
[48:42] for the bread of god is he which cometh
[48:45] down from heaven listen
[48:49] for the bread of god is he that cometh
[48:51] down from heaven
[48:53] and giveth life unto the world
[48:57] right
[49:01] you know i was thinking when i used to
[49:03] read this i always thought about it just
[49:05] being jesus coming down as a baby and
[49:07] all that
[49:08] but he that come down
[49:11] the word that came in this last day
[49:13] is the bread of heaven
[49:16] then say they unto him lord
[49:19] evermore give us this bread
[49:22] and jesus said unto them i am the bread
[49:25] of life
[49:27] he that cometh to me
[49:29] shall never hunger and he that believeth
[49:32] on me
[49:33] shall never
[49:35] thirst
[49:36] one more scripture
[49:39] saint john 11th chapter beginning at the
[49:41] 44 just reading the 44th verse
[49:53] we're speaking of
[49:54] lazarus there in the 11th chapter of
[49:56] saint john
[49:58] and the 44th verse says and he that was
[50:01] dead came forth
[50:03] bound hand and foot
[50:07] with grave clothes
[50:09] and his face was bound about with a
[50:12] napkin
[50:14] and jesus said unto them
[50:16] loose him
[50:18] and let him go
[50:20] let us pray father god we
[50:22] thank you for
[50:24] you being here standing within us
[50:28] you said we are your temple
[50:30] and father we come to
[50:32] worship you to hear from you
[50:35] and we pray father that you speak
[50:37] through these jaws of clay
[50:39] that the people may hear and give them
[50:41] ears to hear you
[50:43] lord we ask these things in your name
[50:45] let your perfect will be done
[50:48] create in us
[50:49] a clean heart
[50:50] and give us a right spirit
[50:53] within us
[50:55] and oh lord when you've done all of that
[50:57] seal us with your holy ghost
[51:00] we say these things in your lovely name
[51:02] jesus christ we pray
[51:04] amen
[51:06] you may be seated
[51:14] last week we were talking about uh
[51:17] sunday we were talking about traditions
[51:20] and a lot of time we don't know how
[51:22] powerful traditions are
[51:24] because it's traditions that blind
[51:26] people
[51:27] this is why laodicea can't see
[51:30] because she had rather follow her
[51:32] traditions
[51:33] than to be called by god because
[51:36] remember amen the anointing of elijah
[51:38] that came in our la in the last day was
[51:41] calling laodicea out of
[51:45] these traditions of men
[51:47] but because they had all of these
[51:49] traditions they couldn't see the jesus
[51:52] christ
[51:53] in malachi 4.
[51:55] it wasn't the man that he was trying to
[51:58] present to you
[52:00] and there was a time when we said you
[52:02] know
[52:03] god sent a prophet
[52:05] but i wonder when will it come
[52:08] if it would ever come
[52:10] to a time when people would be so
[52:13] powerful
[52:14] in god that
[52:16] people would ask who are you
[52:19] you would be able to respond
[52:21] i am the bride of christ
[52:24] because you and i must understand it
[52:26] moved from elijah to elisha
[52:30] and elisha amen is the anointing of god
[52:34] on a many
[52:35] members of
[52:37] people
[52:38] and this bride of jesus christ was
[52:40] chosen by god
[52:42] her name was placed on the lamb's book
[52:44] of life before the foundation of the
[52:47] world
[52:48] she was just as predestinated as
[52:50] jeremiah
[52:52] josiah
[52:54] adam
[52:55] moses
[52:57] there is no difference
[52:59] because
[53:00] these men
[53:02] whom god had chosen
[53:04] came to fulfill a purpose for god
[53:07] in this book
[53:09] this is why jesus said i am the alpha
[53:11] and the omega
[53:13] now we know what the beginning of the
[53:14] the book says and we know what the
[53:16] ending of the book says
[53:17] but understand every person whether it
[53:20] be joseph
[53:21] whether it be
[53:23] paul whether it be old testament moses
[53:26] and you name all of those great
[53:28] patriarchs of of of men people who who
[53:31] worked for god understand
[53:34] that was not human flesh
[53:36] that was god anointing these people
[53:41] to be of his service to make sure that
[53:43] the word of god
[53:46] came to the people or would come to
[53:48] those people in that day
[53:50] and to be understand you got to
[53:52] understand that let's take for example
[53:55] moses when god called moses moses was
[53:58] where was he in egypt you know a place
[54:01] of bondage even though he wasn't in
[54:03] bondage he came to realize that he was
[54:06] the son of a slave
[54:08] and therefore you know what happened
[54:10] being ran out of egypt however you want
[54:12] to put it we find moses on the back side
[54:15] of the desert
[54:16] now at that time he was moses but the
[54:19] bible tells us that moses when he was
[54:21] born he was born a prop for proper child
[54:24] that means god visited this baby when he
[54:26] was a little baby
[54:28] god told his mom and his dad how to
[54:31] protect him in a time when pharaoh was
[54:33] killing all the babies of the of his age
[54:36] same same deal when it came to jesus did
[54:39] not god do the same thing
[54:41] but the point is is that
[54:43] god set the scene
[54:46] because
[54:47] he wanted to show how he was going to
[54:49] live to deliver his people
[54:51] now i want to want you to see something
[54:53] here there was only one thing
[54:56] god told moses to do
[54:59] put the blood on the doorpost and the
[55:01] lentil
[55:02] and the death angel will pass
[55:05] he never gave them rules he never gave
[55:07] them regulations in fact they came out
[55:10] of egypt by the hand of grace
[55:12] but when they got into the wilderness
[55:15] and moses went away for a season
[55:18] understand me
[55:21] because you got to realize it's when the
[55:23] prophet goes off the scene
[55:25] is when satan begins to play
[55:28] and they forgot
[55:31] if they only realized that it was the
[55:33] blood covering them
[55:35] they never would have fallen into the
[55:37] trap of of of dayton and korra
[55:41] because dayton and korra gave them
[55:43] traditions and and brought them back oh
[55:46] i would that we'd be back in egypt
[55:49] back into idolatry back into all of the
[55:52] things that defile mankind
[55:56] you see god only gave them the blood
[56:01] to secure them with
[56:03] you understand me jesus christ is the
[56:06] same yesterday today and forever
[56:08] he can't change
[56:10] the only only thing
[56:12] he gave adam and eve to secure them
[56:15] was the blood of the lamb
[56:18] and we realized at the end of the day
[56:20] when all of these things have come
[56:22] through the church ages come all the way
[56:24] at the end when john turned
[56:27] to see the voice
[56:30] he saw a lamb
[56:32] that was slain
[56:34] from the foundation they were back to
[56:36] the lamb back to the blood it wasn't
[56:39] church creeds and church dogmas you got
[56:42] to do this and you got to do that
[56:44] because one thing i know about the holy
[56:46] ghost once you receive the holy ghost
[56:48] that holy ghost become your law
[56:51] the holy ghost will teach you how to
[56:52] dress
[56:53] he will teach you how to speak he will
[56:56] teach you all the things that man can't
[56:58] teach you and listen it will not be
[57:01] human effort it will be god in you
[57:03] living through you
[57:06] that's the way the early church started
[57:08] they didn't have no books and tapes and
[57:11] you know things like that
[57:12] and even when god sent paul to do
[57:15] something
[57:16] these people began to exalt paul it's in
[57:19] the nature of man
[57:20] everybody want a god with flesh
[57:24] somewhere somebody to worship is not
[57:26] that the same trick
[57:28] you know that uh uh lucifer placed on
[57:32] eve
[57:33] you'll become a god see it it's a tricky
[57:36] thing that the devil always does uh with
[57:40] people that are not a call
[57:43] for the purpose of god's
[57:45] uh elected bride you know what i'm
[57:47] saying seem like they fall
[57:50] even and when i say this i mean when
[57:53] when jesus came he came to tear down all
[57:56] traditions
[57:59] because his word is not traditional it's
[58:02] real it's the same yesterday today and
[58:04] forever
[58:05] he does not change you know how
[58:07] tradition says well god is not the same
[58:09] god he just doesn't do the same things
[58:11] he used to do he does the same thing but
[58:14] he needs somebody to believe
[58:18] even when the word of god came in jesus
[58:21] day uh they tried to trick him in so
[58:24] many ways
[58:25] but let me go back right now to what i
[58:27] read the reason why i read
[58:30] uh uh the scripture in saint john and i
[58:33] read those scriptures so you can see
[58:36] that man does not live by bread alone
[58:40] it's a natural food it
[58:42] doesn't save you
[58:44] you can be 110 years old uh you know i'm
[58:47] saying you you've eaten well you look
[58:49] good you can be healthy and yet you
[58:51] could die and go to hell
[58:53] bread natural food is not what saves you
[58:57] and natural food is not what defiles you
[59:01] but it was such a tradition among the
[59:03] jews
[59:04] that they could not eat certain things
[59:06] they just missed the revelation of god
[59:08] all together
[59:10] because remember the time when god
[59:12] brought forth the sheet of these
[59:14] creatures
[59:15] before peter
[59:17] and peter said oh no lord
[59:19] i have not eaten anything unclean in my
[59:22] life
[59:23] now why would god what was he doing
[59:26] he had already taught them in saint mark
[59:29] it's not the things that goes in you
[59:31] that defiles you
[59:32] but the things that comes out
[59:34] right he tried to tell them you know
[59:37] these traditional things that washing of
[59:40] pots and of hands and all of these
[59:42] things that the elders have placed on
[59:44] you is nonsense
[59:46] because he came to the elders and said
[59:48] but see you criticizing me but let me
[59:51] tell you something
[59:54] what's defiling you now i'm putting it
[59:56] in our turn
[59:57] he said because it ain't the outside and
[1:00:00] say mark he's telling them he's rebuking
[1:00:02] them now and they came to understand it
[1:00:04] he's rebuking them
[1:00:06] it ain't what what you wear that makes
[1:00:08] you holy
[1:00:10] it's the inside
[1:00:12] what's coming out
[1:00:14] cursing and lying and adulteries and
[1:00:16] fornication he said these are the things
[1:00:19] that defile a man
[1:00:22] if if if the outside was the thing that
[1:00:25] would defile you
[1:00:27] then what did what how how how did jesus
[1:00:31] let mary touch him
[1:00:34] mary not only did did she did she touch
[1:00:36] him but she washed his feet she cried
[1:00:40] and you know washed and dried his feet
[1:00:42] with the hairs of her head it was the
[1:00:45] pharisees and the sadducees who looked
[1:00:47] upon him as being unclean
[1:00:49] because their tradition says no way
[1:00:52] a prophet or priest is supposed to let
[1:00:55] this kind of woman touch him
[1:00:58] how bad they were in bondage
[1:01:01] right remember when the man on the road
[1:01:04] to samaria when they saw that man who
[1:01:06] had been beaten and laying there in the
[1:01:08] street the pharisee passed by
[1:01:12] yeah the religious people's sadducees
[1:01:14] they passed by
[1:01:17] but this man coming from jericho
[1:01:20] who was a samaritan and that's a no-no
[1:01:25] he was unclean because he was mixed
[1:01:28] yet god uses him
[1:01:31] to put them to shame in that parable
[1:01:34] because this man was more righteous than
[1:01:37] the pharisee or the levite
[1:01:40] you see what i'm saying see it's the
[1:01:42] deeds the things that comes out of you
[1:01:45] that what makes you holy and what makes
[1:01:47] you unholy
[1:01:49] this is what jesus was saying
[1:01:51] now i say this think about it
[1:01:54] those people in the in the wilderness
[1:01:57] brother adam says it like this he said
[1:01:58] they ate the bread from heaven
[1:02:01] they ate what we call the manna
[1:02:04] but manna means what is it
[1:02:06] they never came to understand it
[1:02:09] and they call it manner today
[1:02:12] but we understand is more than what is
[1:02:14] it
[1:02:15] we know what it is
[1:02:17] it is god manifesting himself
[1:02:21] in morphe is that right because he said
[1:02:23] i was that bread i am that bread that
[1:02:26] was in the wilderness i am that rock
[1:02:29] that was in the wilderness right i am
[1:02:32] that water that came from the rock
[1:02:35] they thought he was plum crazy
[1:02:37] because you remember i want you to
[1:02:39] understand the bible cannot be literally
[1:02:42] understood
[1:02:44] by just reading it
[1:02:47] it comes by revelation
[1:02:50] and jesus said i will build my house
[1:02:53] upon this rock which is the rock of
[1:02:56] revelation
[1:02:57] right now your revelation must go inside
[1:03:00] with the word
[1:03:03] but understand
[1:03:04] god's revelation is far deeper
[1:03:07] excuse me
[1:03:08] than what the letter shows
[1:03:14] hallelujah can anybody tell me
[1:03:19] when god said said to jeremiah i knew
[1:03:22] you
[1:03:26] huh
[1:03:26] we're creatures of time
[1:03:29] at least that's what we thought
[1:03:32] but we're not creatures of time those
[1:03:33] who are true sons and daughters of god
[1:03:36] are not creatures of time
[1:03:40] hello
[1:03:42] jeremiah was with him
[1:03:45] in heavenly places
[1:03:47] before he got here on earth in this
[1:03:49] dimension
[1:03:50] hello
[1:03:52] so were you
[1:03:55] this is why you can hear the gospel this
[1:03:58] is why you can understand the gospel and
[1:04:01] jesus said my sheep heareth my voice and
[1:04:04] a strain that they will not follow
[1:04:08] now where the people get cut off
[1:04:11] they cut they get cut off because god
[1:04:13] began to change things
[1:04:15] in every age you'll find that god began
[1:04:18] to change things
[1:04:20] things and get rid of the traditions
[1:04:24] and every group that came out tried
[1:04:26] their best to get rid of the tradition
[1:04:28] but they couldn't get rid of all of them
[1:04:30] because they didn't have a prophet
[1:04:33] see but when a prophet you began to see
[1:04:38] what the traditions are excuse me
[1:04:42] dry throat
[1:04:46] he's the only one that could have seen
[1:04:48] him
[1:04:49] we wouldn't have been able to
[1:04:51] just like one tradition that killed the
[1:04:53] pentecostal church
[1:04:55] the evidence of the holy ghost is
[1:04:57] speaking in tongues
[1:05:00] it killed
[1:05:02] it became an idol
[1:05:05] do you understand me they major on that
[1:05:08] and nothing else matter
[1:05:11] and the bible says that speaking in
[1:05:12] tongues is the least of the gifts
[1:05:15] you see what i'm saying that's what
[1:05:17] tradition does
[1:05:19] and when you bring people into that kind
[1:05:22] of a tradition you've got all kinds of
[1:05:25] people
[1:05:27] that are not even converted amen
[1:05:29] because they feel like because i spoke
[1:05:32] in tongues no no no if you did it brings
[1:05:35] about if a real speaking of tongues in
[1:05:38] the soul it brings about a conversion
[1:05:41] it brings a change
[1:05:44] you understand me it brings in an
[1:05:46] authority it brings a power
[1:05:50] there are many people who've spoken in
[1:05:52] tongues have net and don't have the holy
[1:05:53] ghost
[1:05:56] they about ran me out of my apostolic
[1:05:58] church when i said that
[1:06:02] but it doesn't matter the point is
[1:06:04] that's a tradition
[1:06:06] traditions are this
[1:06:08] when you make people dress the way you
[1:06:11] want them to dress
[1:06:15] many people don't understand that the
[1:06:18] the sanctification is by the holy spirit
[1:06:22] and not by the preacher
[1:06:24] it must come from the heart
[1:06:27] when it comes from the heart you don't
[1:06:29] have to worry about nobody backsliding
[1:06:31] from it because god put that revelation
[1:06:34] in their heart
[1:06:36] it's true you can go to message churches
[1:06:38] now and if you don't come in like they
[1:06:39] think you are ought to they look at you
[1:06:41] strange and then they segregate great
[1:06:43] gate themselves from you even like peter
[1:06:46] did from the gentiles
[1:06:49] what a hypocrite
[1:06:52] let god work on people's hearts
[1:06:56] oh hey don't let them fall now
[1:07:00] right don't let them make a mistake i'm
[1:07:03] talking about traditions
[1:07:05] traditions make you move away from a
[1:07:08] person and that's not the word
[1:07:10] the bible said if you see your brother
[1:07:12] overtaken in a fault
[1:07:14] you need to go restore him and the bible
[1:07:16] said go in the spirit of what meekness
[1:07:22] but we'll judge it
[1:07:23] and it all depends on how bad the sin is
[1:07:27] that's traditional
[1:07:31] oh
[1:07:32] all unbelief is sin
[1:07:35] amen
[1:07:36] amen
[1:07:39] jesus tried to teach those people who
[1:07:41] caught the woman in adultery their
[1:07:43] traditions was oh we're going to kill
[1:07:45] them and then god basically showed them
[1:07:47] all y'all wicked
[1:07:50] all of you
[1:07:52] let the man who the first let the man
[1:07:54] without sin he let him be the first to
[1:07:56] cast stone
[1:07:57] and all are vanished
[1:08:00] at least they were honest
[1:08:04] but tradition is a murderer
[1:08:09] the bible said it makes the word of god
[1:08:11] of non-effects
[1:08:16] in my church that apple started i
[1:08:17] learned a lot because if that there was
[1:08:20] i could only go to their organization i
[1:08:22] could only go to the churches in their
[1:08:24] organization and
[1:08:26] and i had to ask for permission to do
[1:08:28] that there was no such thing as being
[1:08:29] led
[1:08:32] and if i was caught going to another
[1:08:34] church even in my organization
[1:08:37] you know i could be put on the back seat
[1:08:38] as an example
[1:08:40] of being disobedient
[1:08:42] ooh
[1:08:45] did i go to other churches oh yeah
[1:08:51] i went to some churches that even
[1:08:53] believed in women preachers when i
[1:08:54] didn't believe in it and guess what i
[1:08:56] had a shout and good time
[1:09:00] because i recognized the same holy ghost
[1:09:03] some people just ignored they don't know
[1:09:06] but even in our own ignorance god gave
[1:09:08] us the holy spirit
[1:09:12] let me ask you a question how are you
[1:09:15] going to separate yourself from even
[1:09:17] people who baptize father son and
[1:09:19] trinitarians
[1:09:21] did you not know that most of the people
[1:09:23] that was with brother branham was
[1:09:24] trinitarians until the truth of the word
[1:09:27] came
[1:09:28] and yet they had the holy ghost many of
[1:09:30] them did
[1:09:32] but we don't have patience for that
[1:09:35] because tradition says they're not like
[1:09:37] us
[1:09:39] shame on us
[1:09:41] because we've become just like it was in
[1:09:43] that day
[1:09:46] that's the way it was when when lazarus
[1:09:48] listened lazarus was dead for four days
[1:09:51] and realized four days the bible said a
[1:09:53] thousand years as
[1:09:55] is one day is as a thousand years so
[1:09:57] let's say 4 000 years well listen it was
[1:10:00] 4 000 years
[1:10:02] before god came back to the church
[1:10:05] per se
[1:10:08] because death struck
[1:10:11] came all the way through
[1:10:14] to the place that they was thinking
[1:10:18] hello it's the truth
[1:10:20] but what the thing that jesus said when
[1:10:24] he raised lazarus from the dead sea and
[1:10:26] that's what happened when luther came
[1:10:28] with justification
[1:10:30] the thing that
[1:10:32] god wanted to do wanted to be done is
[1:10:34] that grave clothes be loosed
[1:10:38] and those grave clothes were types of
[1:10:40] traditions and dogmas and
[1:10:43] creeds and all of those things
[1:10:47] it looked like when pentecost came on
[1:10:50] azusa street that god had set them free
[1:10:52] he did set them free and what happened
[1:10:56] they went back to the traditions
[1:11:00] this message come to set us free amen
[1:11:04] bringing us to a place where we should
[1:11:05] be able to be led by god
[1:11:09] that's not disrespecting you know your
[1:11:11] pastor we know that when you got to go
[1:11:13] somewhere it's good to tell him where
[1:11:15] you're going
[1:11:16] so that he can be aware of what's
[1:11:18] happening and stuff like that there's no
[1:11:19] rules and regulation it's just respect
[1:11:24] but when god is leading you to do
[1:11:25] something you are obligated to do it
[1:11:32] traditions
[1:11:35] is what happened to the pentecostal
[1:11:36] people
[1:11:37] and they set those things in order of
[1:11:40] control
[1:11:41] hello because traditions were controlled
[1:11:44] that's what nickelodeon spirit was it
[1:11:46] was to control the laity
[1:11:48] and that's what they did
[1:11:51] and they put the fear in the people so
[1:11:53] badly till they couldn't go nowhere or
[1:11:55] do anything and yet they shout like
[1:11:57] they're alive but let me tell you
[1:11:59] something whenever you take tradition
[1:12:01] over the word you are dead amen
[1:12:05] amen
[1:12:06] that's why i go where i want to or
[1:12:08] whenever i'm led to go somewhere i don't
[1:12:10] we may not see eye to eye but one of
[1:12:12] these old days we will
[1:12:15] the holy spirit is the holy spirit
[1:12:19] take those claims
[1:12:21] grave clothes off
[1:12:24] and lazarus was wrapped with traditions
[1:12:26] from the top of his head to the soul of
[1:12:29] his feet
[1:12:31] bound
[1:12:33] what's happening to the people now
[1:12:37] we've allowed the message or men to take
[1:12:40] this very message and tie us up
[1:12:43] and bind us again
[1:12:49] oh they don't say directly the days of
[1:12:51] miracles have passed but if you we don't
[1:12:53] need gifts anymore
[1:12:54] where is that the word
[1:12:56] find it
[1:12:58] show me where it's at
[1:13:01] show me where god told rebecca throw it
[1:13:04] all away
[1:13:06] we're the time of restoration he said
[1:13:08] well the word is open don't you
[1:13:10] understand what that means
[1:13:12] that means that every gift that god has
[1:13:14] given you in this church is to be used
[1:13:17] by the bride
[1:13:20] amen am i making sense
[1:13:23] but traditions oh you two pentecostals
[1:13:26] see that is the word of men and so many
[1:13:29] men have used those same turns and they
[1:13:32] blaspheme the holy ghost without even
[1:13:34] knowing it
[1:13:37] i'm not all about gifts but my thing is
[1:13:40] this
[1:13:41] the message of this hour came to lift us
[1:13:44] up out of laodicea and placed us into a
[1:13:46] capstone ministry that will change you
[1:13:51] from glory to glory until you come into
[1:13:53] the very image of god
[1:13:56] it came to give us back that divine
[1:13:59] nature
[1:14:01] that peter talks about
[1:14:03] that's it
[1:14:05] that's the thing that's the treasure
[1:14:06] that's the very thing we lost but if
[1:14:09] we're so busy fighting each other and
[1:14:11] picking on each other and saying these
[1:14:13] things listen god hate discord
[1:14:18] god hates a proud spirit
[1:14:21] and when we find ourselves amen looking
[1:14:24] at this church and they ain't got this
[1:14:26] and the past i've been guilty myself but
[1:14:29] god is now cleaning me of all of the
[1:14:32] filth and all of the things that i once
[1:14:34] thought
[1:14:36] who am i
[1:14:40] who am i who are you that you can point
[1:14:42] a thing and say this one is in and that
[1:14:44] one's out
[1:14:45] you can't do it
[1:14:49] and not be right with god
[1:14:56] love the lord
[1:14:58] even this message you know they overlook
[1:15:00] the young people they overlook the young
[1:15:02] children just like his disciples wanted
[1:15:04] to do lord these children jesus they
[1:15:06] suffer the little children that come
[1:15:08] unto me for such is the kingdom of god
[1:15:12] but we'll look at our young people like
[1:15:14] they ain't got nothing to say and no you
[1:15:16] know i don't do that but that's what we
[1:15:17] do around the world i mean you know you
[1:15:20] got to be a certain age for people to
[1:15:22] pay attention to it that's tradition
[1:15:24] that's nonsense
[1:15:27] when god can take a man by josiah who's
[1:15:29] what 12 years old and make him a king
[1:15:33] but you got to be oh you got to be old
[1:15:35] to bring forth wisdom why did god use a
[1:15:38] david as a child amen that slew of
[1:15:40] goliath
[1:15:45] we must understand that this thing is
[1:15:47] all messed up and the reason why because
[1:15:50] traditions have blinded us
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:54] we're free
[1:16:00] for 4 000 years god remained distant
[1:16:04] a spirit who was invisible and revealed
[1:16:06] himself through what pillar fire a cloud
[1:16:10] angels and then prophets
[1:16:12] man could not talk to god directly and
[1:16:15] make contact do you see what i'm saying
[1:16:18] that's how bad it was even in in in in
[1:16:21] the days of jesus when jesus came where
[1:16:23] he could be touched that's why john says
[1:16:25] we have seen him
[1:16:27] we have touched him we have handled him
[1:16:30] because there was a time they could not
[1:16:33] have done that
[1:16:34] god wasn't so convenient
[1:16:37] but god came down in the person of jesus
[1:16:39] christ
[1:16:41] hallelujah
[1:16:42] blew their traditions out of the way out
[1:16:44] of the water
[1:16:46] they said oh but you heal you heal by
[1:16:49] beelzebub and jesus said let me ask you
[1:16:51] something your preachers they do all
[1:16:53] this stuff over here with the with the
[1:16:55] lambs and the rams and all he didn't say
[1:16:57] it all like that but i'm paraphrasing he
[1:16:59] said but then who do they heal by
[1:17:04] he was just showing them
[1:17:06] you remember the blind man
[1:17:08] born blind
[1:17:10] and they tried to curse him
[1:17:12] and he said wait a minute
[1:17:15] you mean to tell me with all your
[1:17:16] education
[1:17:18] and what school did you come from
[1:17:21] you know
[1:17:23] no devil can heal
[1:17:26] you know that's not taught even in the
[1:17:29] old testament you know in your scrolls
[1:17:31] you've never seen a a a crippled blind
[1:17:34] or whatever healed by a devil you know
[1:17:37] god can only heal
[1:17:39] they got so mad at him
[1:17:42] because in their traditional mind
[1:17:44] jesus was out of order
[1:17:46] first of all he wasn't a levite
[1:17:50] secondly he come from a place called
[1:17:52] nazareth
[1:17:54] thirdly they say he was born a
[1:17:55] fornication
[1:17:57] understand me
[1:17:59] he was a renegade
[1:18:01] and they couldn't figure it out so much
[1:18:03] so they came to him and says lord tell
[1:18:05] us
[1:18:07] who are you
[1:18:11] who gives you this authority
[1:18:15] jesus said i'll tell you
[1:18:17] if you can tell me who john the baptist
[1:18:19] was it wasn't a part of your system
[1:18:22] he wasn't pharisees sadducees or rhodium
[1:18:25] or whatever tell me who john the baptist
[1:18:27] was and i'll tell you who i am and where
[1:18:30] i got my authority from
[1:18:32] and nato air communicable council got
[1:18:34] together
[1:18:36] and they reasoned it and says well we
[1:18:38] cannot tell and jesus said well because
[1:18:40] you can't tell me i can't tell you
[1:18:42] either
[1:18:43] see you got to understand this is the
[1:18:45] way you got to deal with religious
[1:18:47] people
[1:18:49] right now god remains jehovah
[1:18:52] god above god invisible who could not be
[1:18:55] seen or touched certain
[1:18:57] and and or to touch uh would bring
[1:19:00] certain death remember don't even come
[1:19:02] near the mountain
[1:19:04] if the calves or the animals come near
[1:19:06] they will die if they touch it they will
[1:19:08] die you understand me only the high
[1:19:11] priest could literally go beyond the
[1:19:13] veil y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:19:15] what are you saying i'm saying people of
[1:19:18] god
[1:19:19] even in this message they have so
[1:19:21] traditionally done things when you try
[1:19:23] to tell them that the seventh seal is
[1:19:25] open and god has come down in a special
[1:19:28] way they they try to tell you no no it
[1:19:30] cannot be that way
[1:19:33] same thing they did in jesus day
[1:19:35] and here he was walking around healing
[1:19:37] the sick raising the dead and they say
[1:19:39] he was a devil
[1:19:41] then who was william branham
[1:19:45] you understand what i'm saying no man
[1:19:47] could have done that and people in this
[1:19:49] message know that but they don't want to
[1:19:52] go any further they want to leave it
[1:19:54] right there with malachi 4.
[1:19:56] they don't want to go to eat the book
[1:19:59] for thou must prophesy again
[1:20:01] when is that going to happen
[1:20:03] it's happening now
[1:20:06] where is god when he come down amen
[1:20:08] where did he go
[1:20:10] brother branham preached the message the
[1:20:12] views of invisible union of the bride
[1:20:14] and the bridegroom
[1:20:16] amen come on people
[1:20:19] where is he now he's in his body he's in
[1:20:23] his bride but you must come to
[1:20:25] understand where he's at because some of
[1:20:28] us are still praying like he's a
[1:20:30] thousand a million miles away
[1:20:35] we've got to change that
[1:20:37] the protocol means a lot
[1:20:39] you miss the protocol
[1:20:42] you miss god
[1:20:43] that's why he said only a few be that
[1:20:45] find it
[1:20:47] only a few
[1:20:48] because traditions is blinding everybody
[1:20:54] listen
[1:20:55] brother brethren the ministry of brother
[1:20:57] branham god used him to bring grace
[1:21:01] um
[1:21:02] listen all those people that came to get
[1:21:04] healed and you know what was that that
[1:21:07] was the grace of god
[1:21:09] all kinds of situations they were in
[1:21:12] you know god never said well what what
[1:21:14] religion you belong to
[1:21:16] he never said well you're a baptist i
[1:21:17] can't bother you
[1:21:19] you're a methodist i can't touch you you
[1:21:20] can't get healed
[1:21:21] i know you you pinnacle you see what i'm
[1:21:24] saying
[1:21:24] you know what he said
[1:21:27] kept telling us god gives the holy ghost
[1:21:29] to whom he will
[1:21:32] we don't know who seed
[1:21:34] listen did you all of a sudden become
[1:21:36] seed
[1:21:37] when you came into this message
[1:21:39] absolutely not
[1:21:40] you if your seed you always were
[1:21:44] nothing can change that
[1:21:46] and and what makes it so wonderful is
[1:21:49] because now we can see we are seed
[1:21:52] by the revealed word of the hour and
[1:21:55] like i said the other night
[1:21:57] if pentecost the pentecostal uh uh uh uh
[1:22:02] uh which god a period could have brought
[1:22:04] us into the message why did we need
[1:22:07] malachi for
[1:22:09] why do we need the capstone ministry
[1:22:12] what does it mean they cannot be
[1:22:14] complete without us
[1:22:16] what does that mean
[1:22:18] because the first time in all history
[1:22:22] bible history god
[1:22:25] is feeling sinful flesh
[1:22:28] with himself
[1:22:30] it wasn't just brother branham he was a
[1:22:33] wave chief
[1:22:35] but god came to
[1:22:36] prove that his blood is still powerful
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:42] can you imagine
[1:22:44] there's a time you had to be holy this
[1:22:46] and in the line of this in the line of
[1:22:49] that but the greatest lineage ever is
[1:22:52] the lineage of jesus christ
[1:22:55] that's why we are accepted in him
[1:22:58] because we were in him
[1:23:01] no laws no rules no regulations oh you
[1:23:05] don't listen well if i that means you
[1:23:08] know i can just do what i want to do
[1:23:10] well yeah it's true
[1:23:12] but if you're a true seed of god you'll
[1:23:14] do only what you want to do and be the
[1:23:16] will of god
[1:23:21] yes what did this whole purpose oh my
[1:23:24] god if i could get get my if i could get
[1:23:26] you all to see i'm sure you do the whole
[1:23:29] what up what i'm trying to say is what
[1:23:31] you need to be working on most the most
[1:23:35] is your nature
[1:23:38] letting god work here
[1:23:40] cleaning out all the flus
[1:23:44] letting god rip away all the traditions
[1:23:47] y'all understand me yeah
[1:23:49] listen
[1:23:50] it's your place that people don't even
[1:23:52] know how do i get the holy ghost what
[1:23:53] brother adam said you ought to least get
[1:23:55] out of order
[1:23:56] long enough to get the holy ghost
[1:23:59] if god strikes you
[1:24:01] and all of a sudden you feel a spirit to
[1:24:03] scream and oh praise god well i can't do
[1:24:07] it that's out of church all the
[1:24:08] traditions
[1:24:10] traditions
[1:24:14] huh
[1:24:15] traditions
[1:24:17] i i can't think of the man now i got him
[1:24:18] in mine now you hear him on the on on
[1:24:20] brother m tapes all the time
[1:24:22] hey man why have you
[1:24:25] been
[1:24:26] ben people wanted to know this is from
[1:24:28] tom brown and sister maryland they told
[1:24:30] me people wanted to know whether brother
[1:24:32] ben really had the holy ghost brother
[1:24:34] brown said yeah that's the holy ghost
[1:24:36] because sometimes being would break out
[1:24:38] it when everything was quiet hallelujah
[1:24:41] and shook and shake everybody brother
[1:24:45] brother
[1:24:49] brother brown said he even saw a man
[1:24:51] jump out of his seat
[1:24:53] it scared him so bad
[1:24:56] but that was the holy ghost
[1:24:58] you know i think god was saying too
[1:25:00] quiet in here hallelujah
[1:25:01] [Laughter]
[1:25:04] god has a way
[1:25:06] he has a sense of humor
[1:25:08] but you see people will say because they
[1:25:10] don't understand they would probably
[1:25:11] think he's got a strange spirit
[1:25:14] because that's what they were thinking
[1:25:16] and brother brown says no that's the
[1:25:17] holy ghost
[1:25:18] and god holy spirit works on everybody
[1:25:21] differently
[1:25:23] that's what i'm saying see traditions
[1:25:26] you gotta shout you gotta dance you
[1:25:27] gotta speak in tongues all those things
[1:25:29] are good but what if they don't have
[1:25:31] just like i was telling a brother the
[1:25:33] other day what you need to focus on is
[1:25:36] the change
[1:25:38] have you been changed and are you
[1:25:41] changing
[1:25:43] that's the holy spirit amen
[1:25:48] because what happens when you don't when
[1:25:50] you stop speaking in tongues and you
[1:25:51] can't speak no more
[1:25:54] everything on c's
[1:25:57] except the word
[1:26:00] abraham and moses right he introduced
[1:26:03] the law to protect them from sin and
[1:26:06] correct and to correct their what fallen
[1:26:10] nature is that right
[1:26:12] that's what being born again is is god
[1:26:15] correcting your fallen nature
[1:26:19] of what adam the real adam used to be
[1:26:22] before he failed
[1:26:24] correcting your nature because listen
[1:26:26] you can't get to heaven with a sin for
[1:26:29] nature
[1:26:30] the nature has to be changed
[1:26:33] that's the thing character that would go
[1:26:35] up in the rapture amen
[1:26:38] that's it
[1:26:39] god don't care if you're pretty he don't
[1:26:41] care if you're ugly he don't care if
[1:26:42] you're skinny he don't care if you're
[1:26:43] fat he's looking for nature change
[1:26:50] and that's what we ought to be it ain't
[1:26:51] about amusement
[1:26:53] ain't about oh going over here and
[1:26:55] shouting and dancing and having i'm so
[1:26:57] tired and don't get me wrong
[1:26:59] i've been in this message for a good
[1:27:01] while now
[1:27:02] i've had some powerful service i've been
[1:27:05] in but you know what
[1:27:07] little change
[1:27:10] because all of that ain't going to do
[1:27:12] you no good if the word of god
[1:27:14] doesn't reach you
[1:27:17] the word of god changes you
[1:27:22] and if they're not preaching the word
[1:27:23] telling you that you are you you're now
[1:27:26] in a place where god is saying grow up
[1:27:29] grow up into christ right
[1:27:33] the oil and the extra oil is that you
[1:27:35] have the revelation of who you are
[1:27:38] and the purpose for which you were born
[1:27:40] and that purpose is to magnify jesus
[1:27:42] christ in this day
[1:27:45] as being the same yesterday today and
[1:27:47] forever that's what brother brown did
[1:27:50] that was his theme
[1:27:51] and it wasn't just a theme it was in
[1:27:54] action
[1:27:55] what's going to happen oh we're waiting
[1:27:57] waiting on
[1:27:58] what if he's in you what other kind of
[1:28:01] anointing you need
[1:28:04] the greatest anointing is in you
[1:28:07] it ain't what you feel on your head and
[1:28:09] on your skin
[1:28:11] it's in you
[1:28:13] christ is the anointing
[1:28:16] and we need to learn how to tap into
[1:28:18] that
[1:28:19] that he may do what he need to do in us
[1:28:23] hallelujah
[1:28:25] once the law was instructed
[1:28:27] transgressions and you know what the law
[1:28:28] does it shows you just how wicked you
[1:28:30] are
[1:28:37] i don't know for some reason it just
[1:28:39] seemed like those who was in jesus's
[1:28:41] army in his day was always them real
[1:28:44] wicked ones
[1:28:45] they were the outcasts of the society
[1:28:48] and you know the church world didn't
[1:28:50] want them because they had lived such
[1:28:52] wicked lives
[1:28:54] he had thieves and robbers and
[1:28:57] and and and and you know you had matthew
[1:28:59] and mark and you know these rowdy people
[1:29:03] fishermen that curse every day
[1:29:07] yeah and god god changed all of that
[1:29:11] and god used these man in such a
[1:29:14] profound co can't you see
[1:29:16] you ought to step into the places if god
[1:29:18] can change peter he can change me
[1:29:23] matthew and all the rest of them if he
[1:29:25] can change them he can change me
[1:29:30] huh the woman at the wealth if he could
[1:29:32] change her he can change me
[1:29:36] he gave them the holy spirit and that
[1:29:39] holy spirit was promised to them
[1:29:41] it was there to for the asking for the
[1:29:44] taking
[1:29:45] nobody could get their portion
[1:29:48] but they were there to get it
[1:29:50] and let me tell you something nobody can
[1:29:52] get your portion
[1:29:53] but your portion is for you
[1:29:55] and when you get your mind made up i'm
[1:29:57] gonna like i said earlier a month or so
[1:30:00] ago i'm tired of living for me
[1:30:04] i've lived my life
[1:30:08] and god has been good to me
[1:30:09] when i'm gonna when it's going when will
[1:30:12] it become his day in my life
[1:30:14] if that makes sense
[1:30:16] his day not my day lord what your will
[1:30:19] is thy will be done today that will be
[1:30:22] done tomorrow if i see another day thy
[1:30:25] will be done and not my will
[1:30:29] that's living for
[1:30:32] jesus when you start praising god and
[1:30:36] testifying of god they gonna hate you
[1:30:39] and when you start i just witnessed to a
[1:30:41] man the other day i think i told you
[1:30:42] guys about it told him about the baptism
[1:30:44] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:30:46] you know that man went right on and got
[1:30:48] baptized in the name of the father son
[1:30:50] and holy ghost
[1:30:51] i gave him the app you know the table
[1:30:54] and everything i told him to listen to
[1:30:55] it i know he didn't because the next
[1:30:57] time he saw me had that little that
[1:30:58] little
[1:30:59] that little spirit you know what i'm
[1:31:02] saying his pastor done told him
[1:31:05] you know and i picked it up it was okay
[1:31:07] i still loved on him i told him the
[1:31:09] truth about his girlfriend and he got
[1:31:11] mad at me
[1:31:12] you know but listen people when you
[1:31:14] speak the truth satan is going to hate
[1:31:17] you
[1:31:20] gonna hate you
[1:31:22] don't feel bad
[1:31:24] the bible said if you if you're hated
[1:31:26] for righteousness say
[1:31:28] you're blessed if you're persecuted for
[1:31:31] his name say you're blessed why did he
[1:31:34] say his name's sake
[1:31:38] and what people don't even understand is
[1:31:40] that god has allowed you know god
[1:31:42] through the church ages aloud he winked
[1:31:45] at their ignorance by calling the alma
[1:31:47] this and ahmedabad and ahmadis and he
[1:31:49] didn't let the nominations and
[1:31:50] organization uh interfere with what he
[1:31:53] wanted to do but listen
[1:31:55] that changed
[1:31:56] when the word of god was open it changed
[1:31:59] come out of her my people
[1:32:02] come out of her my people
[1:32:04] these are the people that he's working
[1:32:06] with now and understand this working
[1:32:08] with them is in a secret they're looking
[1:32:10] at us like we're cursed and that we're
[1:32:12] cult they have no idea listen who looked
[1:32:15] on like a cult
[1:32:17] they had pharisees sadducees during that
[1:32:19] day and here was jesus
[1:32:22] with 12 disciples
[1:32:25] quit their jobs
[1:32:28] following a man who had no place to lay
[1:32:30] his head he looked like a cup
[1:32:33] he did in the natural eye that's what he
[1:32:36] appeared to be that's why they
[1:32:38] persecuted him because they couldn't see
[1:32:40] the messiah
[1:32:42] that's what's wrong with the people
[1:32:43] they're looking at william branham but
[1:32:45] they don't see the messiah working
[1:32:47] through that human flesh
[1:32:50] nobody could have discerned your hearts
[1:32:52] nobody could tell you your past and your
[1:32:54] future but jesus himself
[1:32:56] it was not the man it was god hiding
[1:32:59] himself
[1:33:02] now a lot of people have resorted to the
[1:33:03] man we don't we don't do that no we only
[1:33:06] exalt the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:33:08] here we recognize we respect hallelujah
[1:33:12] that's another thing
[1:33:16] it's true if you don't read enough
[1:33:18] quotes in some people's church you ain't
[1:33:19] in the message
[1:33:20] now is that tradition
[1:33:22] where did brother adam say that
[1:33:25] where did he say it you won't find it
[1:33:31] it's traditions even when it comes to oh
[1:33:34] brother brethren say brother brandon
[1:33:35] said brother i'm saying it's tradition
[1:33:39] who started that
[1:33:44] but we'll look at people don't get me
[1:33:45] wrong i'm not disrespecting the
[1:33:48] prophet but where did he preach like
[1:33:51] that
[1:33:54] he never
[1:33:55] in fact everything that he thought would
[1:33:57] be contributed to him he corrected the
[1:33:59] people and says no it's not me it's him
[1:34:04] people of god we need to wake up and
[1:34:07] start preaching the gospel the way it
[1:34:08] should be and we preach it like it ought
[1:34:10] to be we'll get the results
[1:34:13] but people are scared of you
[1:34:15] because of what you've done with the
[1:34:17] message of the hour
[1:34:19] they're afraid
[1:34:21] nobody wants to be in a cult
[1:34:23] but we made it look like one
[1:34:27] oh i get in trouble for making
[1:34:28] statements like that but it's true
[1:34:30] anyhow
[1:34:35] let me ask you a question where is in
[1:34:38] the word when jesus came on the scene
[1:34:41] anybody say come see john
[1:34:46] it ain't there
[1:34:50] there's a time in a period that we
[1:34:52] literally literally put it in god sent
[1:34:55] the prophet that's all we preach god
[1:34:56] sent a prophet what happened to jesus
[1:34:58] christ
[1:34:59] he was lost
[1:35:01] in all of that
[1:35:04] there's a time to tell the people god
[1:35:06] sent a prophet but you need to bring
[1:35:08] them to jesus christ first
[1:35:15] you know
[1:35:16] you know i'm at a place in my life right
[1:35:18] now
[1:35:19] i see what i see
[1:35:21] and the revelation of the word is in me
[1:35:24] i know what i'm talking about
[1:35:26] and i could care less about who accepts
[1:35:28] me and don't i really don't i don't care
[1:35:31] anymore
[1:35:32] i often been thinking i've been just
[1:35:34] thinking about it lately the brother
[1:35:35] brother said if i got a preacher the
[1:35:37] truth and drink
[1:35:38] branch water and soda crackers that's
[1:35:40] what i got to do
[1:35:42] i know my calling
[1:35:44] and i know what i've been sent for
[1:35:46] and that is to exalt jesus christ
[1:35:48] thank god for william branham don't get
[1:35:50] me wrong
[1:35:52] i wouldn't see and know what i know
[1:35:55] without the man fulfilling his scripture
[1:35:59] i needed him
[1:36:02] i needed him
[1:36:04] thank god
[1:36:07] he never fell short
[1:36:09] he did everything he was commissioned to
[1:36:12] do thank god
[1:36:14] and because of that i have an entrance
[1:36:17] because we did not understand peter
[1:36:20] add to your faith virtue
[1:36:21] add to your knowledge we thought it was
[1:36:24] human effort but brother branham
[1:36:26] preached a message statue of a perfect
[1:36:28] man and right at the end of it he said
[1:36:31] you don't add to it as to you but you
[1:36:34] got to get it first
[1:36:37] huh god in you you understand what i'm
[1:36:40] trying to say
[1:36:41] we're so afraid and you know i've been
[1:36:43] like this too you know we get so
[1:36:46] listen
[1:36:47] if the holy ghost comes in here and he
[1:36:49] anoints one song you stay with it
[1:36:53] until god changes it
[1:36:56] because i've changed songs thinking
[1:36:58] that's where god wanted me to go and
[1:37:00] then the holy spirit drops
[1:37:03] we're being led by god
[1:37:05] it must be so from the song leader to
[1:37:08] the songs to the preachers whatever to
[1:37:11] the people in the in in in in in the
[1:37:13] church listen if you want to say shout
[1:37:15] hallelujah hallelujah you don't have to
[1:37:17] wait till i say everybody shout
[1:37:21] everybody clap your hand
[1:37:25] no if you feel like clapping your clap
[1:37:27] your hand if the word good good good and
[1:37:29] you want to scream scream
[1:37:32] you're screaming to him hallelujah
[1:37:35] it ain't about me it ain't about the
[1:37:37] deacons it ain't about the ushers it
[1:37:39] ain't about we come to worship god and
[1:37:42] you want to see god moving here you want
[1:37:44] to see the power of god listen listen to
[1:37:47] brother listen to branham tabernacle in
[1:37:49] their early stages
[1:37:51] the holy ghost coming in and they'd be
[1:37:52] screaming and hollering and everything
[1:37:54] else why why brother branham never
[1:37:56] rebuked them for it
[1:37:58] why because that's what the preaching is
[1:38:00] all about you we preach that he the
[1:38:04] shekinah would come in and when he comes
[1:38:06] in he anoints and feels
[1:38:09] right
[1:38:10] i've seen it
[1:38:11] even when i was in lyme ohio i'm
[1:38:13] preaching preaching preaching the holy
[1:38:15] ghost dropped down in the service and
[1:38:19] several people was filled with the holy
[1:38:20] ghost
[1:38:22] that's the way it's supposed to be done
[1:38:24] so electrifying that god
[1:38:26] hears the hearts of the people while
[1:38:28] this worshiping and feels them
[1:38:30] it doesn't have to take all night
[1:38:38] i weigh off my notes
[1:38:42] but it's a challenge
[1:38:45] i remember my wife and i went to a
[1:38:46] concert or
[1:38:48] singing at um
[1:38:50] i won't say where it was but it was the
[1:38:52] lafontaine's singing
[1:38:54] me and my wife was the only ones
[1:38:56] enjoying
[1:38:56] ourselves you thought you was in a
[1:38:58] catholic church
[1:39:01] and even though i felt so out of order
[1:39:05] y'all know me i'm gonna break that
[1:39:07] barrier
[1:39:09] i'm gonna break that barrier even though
[1:39:11] i felt that odd i'm like you ain't shut
[1:39:13] me up god's been too good to me i don't
[1:39:16] know what y'all feeling
[1:39:18] you know what and then brother brother
[1:39:20] brother the fontaine after service say
[1:39:22] you know you god blessed me you you
[1:39:24] helped me out
[1:39:27] see you never know what you're doing
[1:39:30] but if you let go and let god have his
[1:39:33] way
[1:39:34] you're encouraging somebody
[1:39:37] i'm telling you worshiping here you
[1:39:39] could never get out of order for me
[1:39:41] you know unless you know you you're the
[1:39:43] preacher came preaching we can't hear
[1:39:45] him now you got to just calm it down a
[1:39:47] little bit
[1:39:49] hold it up that's right the spirit of a
[1:39:51] prophet is subject to the prophet you
[1:39:53] wait till we finish and then when you
[1:39:54] say amen wow you can do whatever you
[1:39:56] want to do
[1:40:00] yes uh
[1:40:02] see the the purpose of his return is to
[1:40:05] build a bride for translation
[1:40:09] amen and to do this he must change her
[1:40:13] fallen nature into the restored nature
[1:40:16] of christ
[1:40:18] the divine nature
[1:40:20] to give this eve
[1:40:23] to give this eve his nature
[1:40:25] she will receive it
[1:40:28] as the first he rejected it
[1:40:31] for dogma
[1:40:34] listen it i'm telling you something here
[1:40:37] we must understand by god's grace that
[1:40:39] god always rebuked and paul did the same
[1:40:41] thing i'm gonna get ready to close
[1:40:43] paul did the same thing william branham
[1:40:45] did the same thing paul did
[1:40:47] but paul came into the church and you
[1:40:49] and i can't understand that we weren't
[1:40:50] there but can you imagine changing from
[1:40:54] the law to grace that's why they hated
[1:40:57] him
[1:40:58] paul says all this ritualistic stuff you
[1:41:02] doing is not going to work imma say it
[1:41:04] today all this religious religious stuff
[1:41:07] people are doing here today
[1:41:10] it ain't going to save you
[1:41:12] you need the holy ghost you need to be
[1:41:14] sealed by god
[1:41:16] that's the only thing
[1:41:22] and that's a lot of preachers think
[1:41:23] because they can preach
[1:41:25] they not made it
[1:41:26] and got bad natures
[1:41:29] temples like blood saul you know what
[1:41:31] i'm saying
[1:41:32] i know a few
[1:41:35] it used to confuse me until now
[1:41:38] seriously
[1:41:39] we all get off sometimes
[1:41:42] but i
[1:41:43] all the time
[1:41:46] will you have a reputation of that kind
[1:41:48] of a preacher
[1:41:50] that's not god
[1:41:52] that's not god
[1:41:58] it it amazes me because a lot of times
[1:42:01] people can i mean tear the house down
[1:42:04] let me tell y'all something
[1:42:05] if i was evil
[1:42:07] i could do the same thing
[1:42:10] you understand me
[1:42:11] i'm capable
[1:42:16] every good preacher every anointed
[1:42:18] preacher is capable
[1:42:21] of moving the crowd
[1:42:23] that's not what it's for
[1:42:26] i've been moved so many times i don't
[1:42:27] know
[1:42:29] how many times it's been but i've been
[1:42:30] moved i don't want to be moved
[1:42:33] i want to be changed
[1:42:35] i want the word of god to change me
[1:42:39] i need him to change me he's the master
[1:42:42] bill the lord please have mercy on us
[1:42:49] what good is it to come and hear the
[1:42:50] tapes like i when i hear the tapes i'll
[1:42:52] be that i'll be like i like god i want
[1:42:55] that i want that that's what i want
[1:42:58] i can't get it on my own but i need you
[1:43:01] i need you to change me
[1:43:06] and everybody you know we don't got into
[1:43:07] the same pentecostal mood
[1:43:10] we're like faster having revivals
[1:43:13] everywhere
[1:43:15] and the whole time people are not
[1:43:17] getting the holy ghost and you say how
[1:43:18] you know that the dresses are getting
[1:43:20] shorter
[1:43:22] the menswear is changing
[1:43:24] everything's changing
[1:43:26] now you say well that doesn't matter it
[1:43:27] does matter now
[1:43:29] but it's not for me to change you it
[1:43:32] must come from the heart
[1:43:33] and that's how you know it never was in
[1:43:36] the heart right
[1:43:38] because if it was uh in the heart it
[1:43:40] would be it would be a stabilizer
[1:43:44] but there's no
[1:43:46] stabilizer nothing traditionally stable
[1:43:49] in the message
[1:43:50] it's there but i mean the carnal church
[1:43:53] is still doing what they want to do
[1:43:56] anyway let's move on i'm not trying to
[1:43:58] be critical i'm trying to tell y'all the
[1:44:00] truth
[1:44:01] i want you to open your eyes and ask god
[1:44:03] lord whatever i've got into me that's
[1:44:06] traditional i need to be removed
[1:44:09] you know why because i want to love my
[1:44:11] brother
[1:44:12] i don't care what church he goes to i
[1:44:14] don't even care if he's a baptist i want
[1:44:16] to love him
[1:44:18] you understand me i don't want to
[1:44:19] disfellowship and all of that that's not
[1:44:22] what brother branham was trying to tell
[1:44:24] us
[1:44:26] this message this bride this word this
[1:44:29] open word the open book however you want
[1:44:31] to say it
[1:44:32] has given the church a liberty that
[1:44:34] she's never knew she had
[1:44:39] brother brethren tried to show us
[1:44:41] brotherly kindness
[1:44:43] he tried to show what that was
[1:44:45] even when people spoke bad of him he
[1:44:47] still
[1:44:48] fellowshipped with him
[1:44:50] he still loved him
[1:44:52] he didn't build no circle around i put
[1:44:55] them out he said when that happens he
[1:44:57] said you build a bigger circle
[1:45:00] but not among us
[1:45:02] we just we've done just like the
[1:45:04] pharisees and the sadducees and we
[1:45:07] looked down and
[1:45:09] i'm trying to show you what tradition
[1:45:10] and i say we because i've been guilty of
[1:45:13] it of the same
[1:45:15] but when god began to open your eyes to
[1:45:17] these things and show you you'll never
[1:45:19] reach perfection like that you'll never
[1:45:22] reach it because you got to love your
[1:45:23] brother you got to love your enemy you
[1:45:25] got to love your the unlovable did you
[1:45:28] know that there's some people that
[1:45:30] they're the character is so bad you
[1:45:31] can't you can't love them on your own
[1:45:34] you need god
[1:45:37] you do you can't do it god puts beyond
[1:45:40] your boundaries but look what look what
[1:45:43] being said everything that in you that's
[1:45:46] negative god put there so you can
[1:45:47] overcome
[1:45:49] and god understands your weaknesses
[1:45:53] hey he understand your weaknesses he
[1:45:56] understand mine right
[1:46:00] oh you love the lord
[1:46:02] and and i like i said paul paul and i'm
[1:46:04] gonna have to close but paul came
[1:46:06] busting up everything
[1:46:08] you don't need the synagogue no more
[1:46:11] because now what no ye not he told the
[1:46:14] corinthians
[1:46:15] no ye not you're the temple of god
[1:46:18] you don't need to run over there no more
[1:46:20] you don't need no blood sacrifices
[1:46:23] jesus paid it all can you imagine
[1:46:27] they couldn't wait to get their hands on
[1:46:29] paul and you know they didn't care they
[1:46:31] killed him three times
[1:46:35] and every time he got up kill him again
[1:46:37] they were so blind they couldn't see
[1:46:39] that was god in him
[1:46:42] think about it people
[1:46:47] every christian
[1:46:49] must suffer persecution
[1:46:52] if you're not suffering persecution for
[1:46:53] the name of jesus you ain't telling
[1:46:55] nothing
[1:46:56] you ain't doing nothing
[1:46:58] y'all understand me because god gonna
[1:47:00] put you in the way so you can get some
[1:47:02] persecution
[1:47:04] even it's from your family
[1:47:06] i've had church people to persecute me
[1:47:08] oh you think you're holier than now
[1:47:10] thank you for the compliment
[1:47:16] right
[1:47:17] that's what paul said oh
[1:47:19] if you if that
[1:47:21] are you what he said to jesus dude
[1:47:24] are you a king
[1:47:25] he said y'all you said it
[1:47:30] huh
[1:47:32] paul brought change
[1:47:35] oh it got to the place that even the
[1:47:37] women got out of order and wanted to be
[1:47:39] preachers he said not so
[1:47:44] and people hate him to this day
[1:47:47] no women's are not supposed to preach
[1:47:50] they can testify they can do a lot of
[1:47:51] things that's a lot of study but the
[1:47:53] truth is
[1:47:54] look what traditions did
[1:47:56] i got friends who died women preachers
[1:48:00] and i think to myself oh god be merciful
[1:48:04] you understand what i'm saying and they
[1:48:06] only knew did that because they didn't
[1:48:07] know the truth of the word
[1:48:09] traditions taught them that was okay
[1:48:14] you understand me so let's go on i'm
[1:48:16] almost done
[1:48:18] what happens
[1:48:20] when god came down in 1963 and i'mma say
[1:48:23] it like that i don't care whether people
[1:48:25] like it or not
[1:48:26] is what god revealed to me
[1:48:29] i know it's more to it than that
[1:48:31] and i'm not saying we're not going to
[1:48:32] see him in a corporate body but
[1:48:34] everybody won't when we will
[1:48:37] it won't be like the sky going to open
[1:48:39] and everybody's going to say no no no no
[1:48:41] that ain't it
[1:48:42] when he comes in that last day with the
[1:48:45] jews and all that that's going to be a
[1:48:46] different story every eye will see him
[1:48:50] but in this day
[1:48:52] he's stealing away
[1:48:53] it's a mystery
[1:48:55] it's a real it's a hidden mystery and
[1:48:57] that's what people don't understand that
[1:48:59] invisible union could not happen if he
[1:49:01] ain't here
[1:49:04] you know he you got a union with god
[1:49:05] he's up there no he's here
[1:49:12] people wake up wake up
[1:49:14] because a lot of times people even in
[1:49:16] the message want to downplay the cloud
[1:49:19] well tell me what was it then
[1:49:22] listen
[1:49:23] all i'm trying to tell you i don't care
[1:49:25] what you call it
[1:49:27] some say thunder some say perugia some
[1:49:29] say well i don't know nothing about
[1:49:30] those doctrines i just know what william
[1:49:32] branham left on the tapes
[1:49:34] with my bible
[1:49:36] and i'm gonna tell you something it was
[1:49:38] more than just to display his face in a
[1:49:41] cloud
[1:49:42] a word came
[1:49:44] a book came
[1:49:45] a message that was different from the
[1:49:47] pentecostal message was given
[1:49:51] and what are we doing with it trying to
[1:49:53] make it pentecostal no it came to change
[1:49:57] us from glory to glory to glory to glory
[1:50:01] we're learning how to walk we that being
[1:50:03] said we're learning how to walk we're
[1:50:05] learning how to talk we're learning how
[1:50:07] to run we're learning how to grow up
[1:50:10] into him mature in him and understand
[1:50:14] that the power of every gift was placed
[1:50:17] in you amen when god filled you with the
[1:50:20] holy ghost
[1:50:26] we've said it and i'm almost done i'm
[1:50:28] off my notes i'm just going to preach it
[1:50:30] like you want me to
[1:50:31] we said it many times oh
[1:50:34] that was in god he brought him into
[1:50:36] christ and all
[1:50:39] that was in christ he poured it into his
[1:50:42] bride and i'm like
[1:50:44] where is it
[1:50:46] where is that pouring in
[1:50:50] where is it when we struggles and we're
[1:50:53] struggling like children only because of
[1:50:56] unbelief
[1:50:58] was those disciples that god chose were
[1:51:01] they you know those 12 disciples were
[1:51:03] were they of god
[1:51:05] absolutely even though one was a devil
[1:51:07] he still had the power to cast out
[1:51:08] devils
[1:51:10] because he believed
[1:51:13] how many times did jesus say oh you fool
[1:51:16] slow at heart what was he doing why did
[1:51:18] he preach that to them
[1:51:20] and you know what he did he went all the
[1:51:23] way back to the prophets and began to
[1:51:25] show them
[1:51:26] who he was through the scripture
[1:51:29] william branham did the same thing
[1:51:31] he went all the way through the prophets
[1:51:32] to show us who jesus christ was and is
[1:51:35] in this day amen
[1:51:37] he did it
[1:51:39] and yet he said oh fools and slow now
[1:51:43] jesus can say that because he's god but
[1:51:45] old fools and slow of heart why didn't
[1:51:48] you believe all
[1:51:50] of the scripture not some oh
[1:51:53] see what i'm saying this is the major
[1:51:56] part
[1:51:57] of the scripture that god is saying that
[1:51:59] will identify you
[1:52:01] as bride
[1:52:02] because you believe
[1:52:04] in him whom he sent
[1:52:07] was which was a prophet he said that's
[1:52:09] your word let me go back to that
[1:52:10] scripture and i'm gonna close
[1:52:12] i'm not done i got more to preach on
[1:52:14] this because it's a serious thing and i
[1:52:17] trust by god listen
[1:52:19] john 6 28-35 it says
[1:52:22] then said they unto him what shall we do
[1:52:25] that we might work the works of god
[1:52:27] here's your works
[1:52:29] jesus answered and said unto them
[1:52:31] this is the work of god
[1:52:34] that ye believe on him whom he hath sent
[1:52:40] that's your work
[1:52:41] that you believe listen
[1:52:43] if those people that followed moses had
[1:52:46] only believed continued to believe they
[1:52:49] all would have made it right
[1:52:51] they all would have made it but they
[1:52:53] allowed dogmas and creeds and listen
[1:52:55] what they did it was horrifying what
[1:52:58] they did when moses went away
[1:53:01] they let dayton and cora
[1:53:03] bring them back into idolatry
[1:53:06] and that's exactly what we did in this
[1:53:08] message
[1:53:10] we allow preachers to come and bring us
[1:53:13] back into idolatry instead of going
[1:53:15] forward
[1:53:18] god had to raise up a generation that
[1:53:20] was going to be free
[1:53:22] a generation a new generation that
[1:53:24] wanted the circumcision
[1:53:27] god gave them the circumcision let me
[1:53:29] tell y'all something young people those
[1:53:30] of you who've been born in this message
[1:53:32] and around this message this message is
[1:53:35] for you
[1:53:37] but you can't allow these dogmas and
[1:53:39] these creeds and all of this stuff to
[1:53:41] tie you down it's not time to be famous
[1:53:46] you don't have to be popular you're
[1:53:48] popular with jesus
[1:53:50] just make sure you're doing the will and
[1:53:51] the work of god that's all that matters
[1:53:56] i escaped all of that crazy stuff i
[1:53:58] don't need all of that
[1:54:00] oh man y'all don't hear me say well yeah
[1:54:02] yeah yeah you're in the top 10. i don't
[1:54:03] want to be the top ten
[1:54:06] i just want to be in him
[1:54:08] and him and me
[1:54:10] i don't care
[1:54:12] money don't mean a thing don't y'all oh
[1:54:13] lord if y'all could understand me i i'm
[1:54:16] gonna say it like this by the grace of
[1:54:17] god and i say it as humble as i can i've
[1:54:19] had so many offers
[1:54:22] pastoral offers
[1:54:25] even since i've been here
[1:54:27] i would be a fool
[1:54:30] to leave here
[1:54:32] without god telling me to
[1:54:35] god told me to come here he never told
[1:54:37] me to leave
[1:54:38] y'all understand what i'm saying no
[1:54:40] money can buy me
[1:54:45] i remember when i was in even in ohio
[1:54:47] this particular
[1:54:48] group of people you know the pastor come
[1:54:51] he want to buy me a suit and buy me that
[1:54:52] and i saw it called his spirit just like
[1:54:54] that i said no i don't want none of that
[1:54:57] now if my wife wants something you can
[1:54:59] get her something
[1:55:00] but she she can't preach so i know she
[1:55:05] you know but that's what they did that's
[1:55:07] what they would do
[1:55:10] i'm trying to tell y'all something
[1:55:11] please i hope by god's grace you hear
[1:55:13] what i'm saying
[1:55:14] and understand i'm not trying to destroy
[1:55:17] nobody and what whatever they do let
[1:55:19] them do to let them do it but as far as
[1:55:22] this church is concerned i want to see a
[1:55:24] liberty amen i really want to see a
[1:55:26] freedom in the spirit i want you to
[1:55:28] understand it's the word who's the head
[1:55:30] ship not brother brooks
[1:55:34] i'm here
[1:55:35] i'm here to to you know so maybe you
[1:55:38] could see god work through me
[1:55:40] but the god that i have is greater than
[1:55:42] what you see
[1:55:45] he's god
[1:55:47] and so i trust that you see that all of
[1:55:49] the stuff that people don't put on it
[1:55:53] you know
[1:55:56] if i had known what i know
[1:55:58] now
[1:56:00] people came into the church and judging
[1:56:01] me because of the pictures you don't
[1:56:03] have this up and you and i have that up
[1:56:04] you ain't in the message
[1:56:07] that's tradition
[1:56:11] pictures and painting don't put you in
[1:56:12] the message no more than
[1:56:18] how you're saying
[1:56:19] buckle buckles buckles
[1:56:22] i can't even get it out buckle belt
[1:56:24] buckles
[1:56:26] or cowboy boots or cowboy hats
[1:56:30] you know that's nonsense
[1:56:33] but that's the way people judge it
[1:56:36] some people got to wear something around
[1:56:38] their neck or tie or pen or something to
[1:56:41] identify
[1:56:43] what's the difference between a roman
[1:56:44] catholic priest dressed in his robe
[1:56:47] his little beanie on his head and
[1:56:49] you know same thing to identify brother
[1:56:52] brown said that's hypocrisy
[1:56:57] hypocrisy
[1:56:59] they hated him
[1:57:01] and they still hate him
[1:57:03] and you may not realize the gravitation
[1:57:05] of the seriousness of what the lord
[1:57:07] jesus christ did for them to hate him so
[1:57:10] much
[1:57:12] sitting there with an adulterous woman
[1:57:14] letting her wash his feet
[1:57:16] open the eyes of the blind on sabbath
[1:57:19] day
[1:57:21] everything they thought was rituals and
[1:57:24] what was so god he said ain't none of
[1:57:26] that god
[1:57:28] they were so bad they was they thought
[1:57:29] you know selling you know in the temple
[1:57:32] was god
[1:57:33] jesus took it took that that whip and
[1:57:35] whipped them all out and said one thing
[1:57:38] you become made my my my house a den of
[1:57:42] thieves and robbers and that's what we
[1:57:44] got in the message
[1:57:46] and he said this he said but my house
[1:57:48] should be called the house of prayer
[1:57:51] i'm preaching this here
[1:57:53] i'm preaching so that god will help you
[1:57:56] see i can't show you but god can show
[1:57:58] you
[1:57:59] and whatever ain't word leave it alone
[1:58:01] let god break it away from you
[1:58:06] matter what it is oh
[1:58:08] man the anointing come in that place
[1:58:11] let me tell you something you can go to
[1:58:13] apostolic or pentecostal church right
[1:58:15] now and the anointing will come in that
[1:58:18] place and make us a shame
[1:58:21] but it don't make you right
[1:58:24] because the rain fall on the just and
[1:58:26] the unjust
[1:58:28] you understand me
[1:58:30] and they got us just as much gifts huh
[1:58:32] what you talking about
[1:58:34] and one thing but one thing i can say
[1:58:36] about the pentecost and the apostolic at
[1:58:38] least they are not a shame or what they
[1:58:39] got
[1:58:43] let's stand it was god led me a
[1:58:45] different way maybe when i come back
[1:58:47] again
[1:58:49] i'll be able to say things because i i
[1:58:51] just know i know that if we're going to
[1:58:53] move on to perfection
[1:58:55] we got to drop it all
[1:58:59] and only god can reveal to you
[1:59:01] personally what is and what is not
[1:59:04] it's an individual walk
[1:59:07] it's not a group thing
[1:59:10] and i trust that somehow the lord will
[1:59:12] deal with each and every one of our
[1:59:14] hearts we're not here to please men
[1:59:17] [Music]
[1:59:19] we're here to please god
[1:59:25] brother i don't say
[1:59:27] you shouldn't jump no higher than you
[1:59:29] live
[1:59:31] but if you're living right
[1:59:33] jump as high as you want to
[1:59:36] you got the goods
[1:59:38] you don't have to fear anything
[1:59:41] because you've been
[1:59:42] covered think about it the bible said
[1:59:45] for our sins the blood covered us once
[1:59:48] and for all can you imagine and you know
[1:59:51] a lot of times we think that god is up
[1:59:53] there oh he doesn't sin again dash oh he
[1:59:55] doesn't sin again dash
[1:59:57] no no once and for all
[2:00:02] you can't stop your destiny
[2:00:07] because god had predestined you
[2:00:12] but i think a lot of time we get into
[2:00:14] these things that we fail to see that a
[2:00:17] lot of the things we we do
[2:00:19] is not even necessary this is a common
[2:00:21] salvation
[2:00:23] simple
[2:00:27] you know i i i wear suits only because
[2:00:31] it's traditional
[2:00:34] [Music]
[2:00:37] yes you did
[2:00:38] it's traditional
[2:00:40] who made it that
[2:00:42] [Music]
[2:00:45] that was his error
[2:00:47] when i say era i mean the time he lived
[2:00:49] in
[2:00:51] but if his sin not to wear a suit then
[2:00:54] what about all those who are poor
[2:00:56] and can't afford one
[2:00:57] [Music]
[2:01:00] you know i wear it just
[2:01:02] out of respect
[2:01:04] but if i choose not to wear it that
[2:01:06] doesn't mean that i sin
[2:01:09] you understand what i'm saying
[2:01:11] and and you and i must understand by
[2:01:13] god's grace there are people all over
[2:01:15] the world that can't afford a suit all
[2:01:16] they got is what they got and if it's
[2:01:18] wrong
[2:01:19] for
[2:01:20] me to not wear a suit is wrong for them
[2:01:23] too because the word has no respect to
[2:01:25] person
[2:01:27] but we do this because it was passed or
[2:01:30] passed on passed on and and don't get me
[2:01:32] wrong i really believe that a person to
[2:01:34] respect god they ought to wear something
[2:01:36] really nice if they can't afford it
[2:01:39] something that will you know you come
[2:01:40] into the presence of the lord or to the
[2:01:42] king chamber what happens if the holy
[2:01:44] ghost get a hold of you and just
[2:01:46] make you roll all over the floor don't
[2:01:48] get mad at you if your suit is dirty
[2:01:52] i'm just saying
[2:01:54] when you come to the house of god you're
[2:01:56] supposed to come to the house expecting
[2:01:59] whatever god wants to do with you
[2:02:03] if you say jump jump
[2:02:05] you know i i'm closing but i was i was
[2:02:08] there
[2:02:10] at brother bob's church and they they
[2:02:12] know how to worship down in there
[2:02:15] and i i think brother frank was there i
[2:02:19] almost fell
[2:02:20] [Music]
[2:02:21] and my thought was this if i fall i'm a
[2:02:23] roll
[2:02:27] i'm just gonna let it roll
[2:02:31] that's right
[2:02:32] i'm not going to get embarrassed because
[2:02:34] if i would have fallen he saw the fall
[2:02:36] before i fell
[2:02:39] and you know i just love the lord satan
[2:02:41] is always there to try to stop you
[2:02:44] i just try to see things and i says you
[2:02:46] know
[2:02:48] what's going to happen to us
[2:02:51] there are going to be a few come out of
[2:02:52] this message only a few
[2:02:55] because they're not going to be led by
[2:02:57] men
[2:02:59] and that's what happened
[2:03:01] we were in pentecost the seven church
[2:03:03] ages were led by men but what god did
[2:03:05] with this one
[2:03:06] he took the man out the way
[2:03:08] so you can be led by the spirit
[2:03:12] i trust everybody see what i'm saying
[2:03:15] this is the hour that we're living in
[2:03:17] and we need to move on with god
[2:03:21] we really need to move on
[2:03:24] let's just have a word of prayer
[2:03:26] dear heavenly father who lives within us
[2:03:31] for we set in heavenly places in christ
