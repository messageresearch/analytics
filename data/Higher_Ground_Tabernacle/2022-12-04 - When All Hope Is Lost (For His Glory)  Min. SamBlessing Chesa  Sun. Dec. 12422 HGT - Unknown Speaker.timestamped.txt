[1:01:26] I don't know how to keep on going
[1:01:29] to say but yes I believe the word
[1:01:32] but all my energy is

[1:02:55] I'm just gonna let go I won't do it but
[1:02:59] you know why you're still holding on to
[1:03:00] them
[1:03:02] because God came to your arrest
[1:03:08] because when
[1:03:31] he wants to show his glory
[1:03:35] amen amen that is listed upon our feet
[1:03:40] to the Book of John
[1:03:42] 11.
[1:03:45] John 11 chapter 1.
[1:03:55] John chapter 11 verse 1 the Bible reads
[1:03:58] jean-shapita is now a certain man was
[1:04:01] sick named Lazarus
[1:04:05] of Bethany the town of Mary and her
[1:04:07] sister Martha the Bethany Village
[1:04:11] therefore verse 3 says therefore his
[1:04:15] sister sent unto him saying Lord
[1:04:19] behold he who whom thou lovest is sick
[1:04:24] we see Mary and Martha we're calling for
[1:04:27] Jesus
[1:04:31] had fallen ill no friend I did and it
[1:04:34] was real bad
[1:04:37] but they had seen the Miracles that
[1:04:39] Jesus had done
[1:04:42] Jesus
[1:04:52] and then you they called him on the
[1:04:54] scene he said
[1:05:28] this sickness is not unto death
[1:05:33] but for the glory of God
[1:05:36] that the Son of God might be glorified
[1:05:39] thereby I thank you refuse to Joshua
[1:05:42] Glory theater we may take our seats when
[1:05:45] we are looking here Jesus said this
[1:05:46] sickness is not unto death
[1:05:51] but we all know that Lazarus died after
[1:05:53] remember
[1:05:56] this was a prophetic speech
[1:06:01] that this sickness that Lazarus has
[1:06:03] because it's
[1:06:05] not for for it to kill him
[1:06:09] but it's for God to get the glory
[1:06:13] that the Son of God might be glorified
[1:06:16] through that sickness
[1:06:20] Son of God might be glorified through
[1:06:22] that day
[1:06:26] so God allowed that situation
[1:06:29] God allowed Lazarus to die
[1:06:34] so that his glory might be shown
[1:06:38] so that the Son of God might be
[1:06:40] glorified
[1:06:42] God allowed you to go through your
[1:06:45] situations
[1:06:47] not for you to suffer
[1:06:50] not for you to die but he allowed you to
[1:06:53] go through it
[1:06:55] foreign
[1:07:54] oh it's not dying you're just changing
[1:07:57] Dimensions
[1:08:00] so when the word of God says the
[1:08:03] sickness is not unto death
[1:08:06] it's not a lie it is true it is for His
[1:08:11] glory
[1:08:12] so whatever trial you are going hello
[1:08:16] it is
[1:08:20] not going to kill you
[1:08:22] whatever tribulation you are going with
[1:08:24] reports
[1:08:28] because he is allowed it
[1:08:31] so that the Son of God might be glorious
[1:08:35] you look at job work out there God
[1:08:38] allowed him to go through those
[1:08:39] tribulations
[1:08:41] it was not for job to Suffer City
[1:08:45] together
[1:08:48] so I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:08:54] I do not know what it is just say
[1:08:57] basketball but you know what it is God
[1:09:00] knows what it is you're sexing whatever
[1:09:02] that is
[1:09:05] for God to get glorious
[1:09:09] he is coming to deliver us
[1:09:12] he'll raise the Lazarus
[1:09:14] he can raise YouTube
[1:09:16] if you open the blind eyes
[1:09:19] you can open your eyes
[1:09:26] if you heal diabetes
[1:09:31] if he healed blood pressure
[1:09:34] he can heal you too he is allowing you
[1:09:38] to go through that is for himself
[1:09:45] in John chapter 9
[1:09:47] Earth as Jesus was walking with his
[1:09:50] disciples
[1:09:52] they saw a blind man he's over here John
[1:09:56] chapter 9 verse 1 says
[1:09:59] Jesus passed by he saw a man which was
[1:10:01] blind from his death
[1:10:05] and his disciples asked him saying
[1:10:08] master who did Sin this man or his
[1:10:10] parents that he was born blind
[1:10:16] Jesus answered
[1:10:19] neither had this man sinned
[1:10:23] no his parents
[1:10:26] but that the works of God should be made
[1:10:28] to manifested
[1:10:32] his predicament see his
[1:10:44] it was not because his parents did
[1:10:47] something wrong
[1:10:49] allowed him to be born blind
[1:10:53] he can open his eyes
[1:10:56] and he gets the glory
[1:10:59] whatever predicament you are in prayer
[1:11:03] I have a trial situations
[1:11:08] it is for God together
[1:11:11] many people like to judge a lot
[1:11:15] they say he's going through that because
[1:11:17] he sinned basketball
[1:11:21] that is happening because he did
[1:11:23] something wrong
[1:11:25] we're already passing judgment and we
[1:11:28] saw him
[1:11:30] you can't do this because you did that
[1:11:33] basketball
[1:11:35] who are you to judge
[1:11:37] hey man amen that is not the situation
[1:11:41] that is not the case you're going
[1:11:44] through what you were going through
[1:11:45] passive person situation so that God can
[1:11:48] get the glory
[1:11:50] the darker the night
[1:11:53] it's so lighter the morning is gone
[1:11:58] Lazarus was only sick and he was healed
[1:12:03] we were gonna be talking about a healing
[1:12:05] testimony
[1:12:07] healing testimony
[1:12:10] but we are not talking about a healing
[1:12:13] testimony
[1:12:15] we're talking about a resurrection
[1:12:19] because the darker the situation
[1:12:24] the greater the testimony is
[1:12:27] the deeper you are in trouble
[1:13:29] but God
[1:14:02] depression is not going to kill you
[1:14:05] depression is not going to destroy
[1:14:08] you're going to come out with peace
[1:14:17] God is coming to deliver you
[1:14:20] cancer is not going to come
[1:14:25] so he's gonna take you out of there
[1:14:30] people not going to destroy you yes
[1:14:34] you will not remain Barren forever
[1:14:38] God will come to heal you
[1:14:41] did it for Sarah
[1:14:49] the end result is for God to get the
[1:14:51] glory
[1:14:54] not to anyone else but for himself
[1:14:58] so he said Lazarus is sick
[1:15:02] so that I get the glory
[1:15:05] your condition is not going to make you
[1:15:07] suffer
[1:15:10] he's going to get the Glory
[1:15:12] by delivering you
[1:15:15] he says I know the plans that I have for
[1:15:18] you
[1:15:20] not plans for you not to suffer Pat the
[1:15:23] problem
[1:15:24] but plans for you to prosper man
[1:15:28] in each and every aspect Obama
[1:16:30] God wants to use me you and me for his
[1:16:33] glory
[1:16:35] because it all belongs to him
[1:16:38] we all know of Abraham
[1:16:41] when Abraham was called out of the land
[1:16:43] of the heathens
[1:16:48] the heathens were worshiping multiple
[1:16:51] gods
[1:16:53] if you use the word god it could mean
[1:16:56] anything
[1:16:58] with the juice
[1:17:06] but God wanted to establish himself
[1:17:10] and then he called out Abraham
[1:17:15] why did he call Abraham
[1:17:17] God was establishing his own identity
[1:17:23] and he raised him up and he said you are
[1:17:27] going to be a father of Nations
[1:17:30] and that those Nations we're going to be
[1:17:33] called God's people so happiness So when
[1:17:37] you say God
[1:17:38] people don't get confused
[1:17:41] you're not going to assume you're
[1:17:43] talking about his son
[1:17:45] you're talking about a moon God
[1:17:49] but when you say the god of Abraham
[1:17:53] they will know you're talking about
[1:17:55] yourself
[1:17:57] so God was using Abraham for his glory
[1:18:00] hello
[1:18:03] God gave Abraham a son after 25 years
[1:18:08] so when people are talking about it
[1:18:11] that's the god of Abraham
[1:18:14] there wouldn't be any confusion
[1:18:17] because he is the only Mighty God
[1:18:21] he is the only mighty warrior
[1:18:25] so God wanted to use Abraham
[1:18:28] to East establish himself poor sisterly
[1:18:32] and remap how many are tired to say Lord
[1:18:34] I'm tired of using you come here not to
[1:18:36] vote for some particular deal send you
[1:18:38] investigate the the the utilizing you
[1:18:41] are just you you're in a relationship
[1:18:42] with God but you are just using God
[1:18:47] Lord I'm sick he heals you conversation
[1:18:50] Lord I'm in need of this he comes every
[1:18:53] person they say he gives it to you if
[1:18:55] you don't there's nothing wrong with
[1:18:57] that
[1:18:58] he wants to do it very fast but it's
[1:19:01] time for now man yes you've got to use
[1:19:04] your name
[1:19:06] so when people look at you
[1:19:08] they can say that is
[1:19:14] the god of Brothers
[1:19:17] what God is using your mind
[1:19:20] give himself Glory
[1:19:22] so when he raised Abraham when people
[1:19:26] were talking about how Mighty Abraham
[1:20:01] that's why when the children of Israel
[1:20:04] were praying foreign
[1:20:30] Rachel was also Barren for 14 years
[1:20:37] so when you say the god of Abraham
[1:20:41] the god of Jacob you are calling him to
[1:20:44] do what he did before
[1:20:47] and he can come and he stand and says I
[1:20:49] did that
[1:20:51] all right it is all for his glory
[1:20:54] when we talk about Gideon overcoming
[1:20:57] we're going to happen
[1:21:05] when we talk about the Jericho walls
[1:21:07] falling
[1:21:14] so when you are in a situation
[1:21:17] and you cannot see a way out
[1:21:22] God wants to get Glory from you
[1:21:25] and after that he can say
[1:21:28] you see my son
[1:22:27] men do not walk into lions
[1:22:42] [Applause]
[1:23:28] they know
[1:23:34] [Applause]
[1:23:54] [Applause]
[1:24:28] this woman
[1:26:28] you see my
[1:26:38] [Applause]
[1:27:09] [Applause]
[1:27:28] for you
[1:27:58] foreign
[1:28:25] whatever you were going through
[1:28:28] it is for His glory
[1:28:31] whatever trial you are in but yeah
[1:28:36] for him to gather Glory
[1:28:39] anxiety
[1:28:43] anxiety you don't know what's going on
[1:28:49] he was together
[1:28:52] cancer has no power
[1:28:54] because we serve a Mighty Warriors
[1:29:03] diabetes has no power over you
[1:29:06] there is no sin that has power over
[1:29:10] God can break those chains
[1:29:14] anointing of the almighty god
[1:29:18] um
[1:29:21] God is in this place this morning
[1:29:25] so if you calling him say Lord I don't
[1:29:28] want to walk in your prayers
[1:29:31] are the same way that occasions
[1:29:37] he can break that bondage he can break
[1:29:40] those chains
[1:29:43] because he wants to get the glory out of
[1:29:46] it when people are talking about the God
[1:29:48] of
[1:29:50] Israeli the Judy's Nations started
[1:29:52] shaking
[1:29:54] because they heard what God had done
[1:29:56] he's on don't you think he delivered God
[1:29:59] he delivered his children from a
[1:30:01] superpower either
[1:30:03] in bondage for 400 years
[1:30:08] God did not allow them to be in bonded
[1:30:10] for only 20 years
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:14] because no one would fear people who are
[1:30:17] coming out of bodies for only 20 years
[1:30:18] but no one would fear people who just
[1:30:21] came out of bondage
[1:30:25] but because they've been under
[1:30:27] under Pharaoh baskets
[1:30:30] in that time Egypt was the superpower
[1:30:35] but God came and delivered
[1:30:38] he took them out of it is for him to get
[1:30:42] the glory that's why when they were
[1:30:44] walking out going towards Canaan coming
[1:30:47] back now people we came we're coming to
[1:30:49] make treaties with them
[1:30:53] please don't fight us
[1:30:56] because they knew that was the god of
[1:30:58] Abraham
[1:30:59] Isaac God of Jacob you're the sack up
[1:31:03] God did that Jew Lafayette he wants to
[1:31:06] gather glory for me
[1:31:08] amen amen in John chapter 11 verse 5.
[1:31:13] it says now Jesus loved mother hello
[1:31:18] and her sister and Lazarus is
[1:31:21] when he heard therefore that he was sick
[1:31:25] he about two days still in
[1:31:31] then after that he said to his disciples
[1:31:33] let us go into Judea again
[1:31:37] he was living the situation to get worse
[1:31:39] if molecular situation some P because if
[1:31:42] he was just going to heal Lazarus
[1:31:45] that was going to be one of the many
[1:31:47] healing testimonies
[1:31:56] in letting off the pressure don't a
[1:31:59] message
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:02] the prophet says
[1:32:05] when her brother was dead a mountain
[1:32:09] she sent for Jesus
[1:32:12] and instead of coming
[1:32:15] here he went away party she sent again
[1:32:20] he went further
[1:32:23] and I asked him again and he goes
[1:32:26] further
[1:32:27] foreign
[1:33:27] worse and all that situations
[1:33:30] how many have ever been there
[1:33:32] you are sick you pray you have a prayer
[1:33:36] situation gets worse it looks like God
[1:33:39] has turned his battery he says he comes
[1:33:41] to you he's not even answering your
[1:33:43] prayers
[1:33:45] and it looks like he is further it says
[1:33:49] you have depression depression anxiety
[1:33:53] you have fear Lord help me
[1:33:57] that's your prayer day and night
[1:34:00] but he just seems like he's going first
[1:34:03] how many have ever been there
[1:34:07] but when God is going further McCone he
[1:34:10] wants to magnify
[1:34:12] magnificent when he is going away
[1:34:15] he's not he's not forsaking you innovus
[1:34:19] he's waiting for that right time
[1:34:23] come and take you out of it
[1:34:26] so you can know that for sure
[1:34:30] this is not a mistake
[1:34:34] for sure it is God who took me out
[1:34:38] because when he comes nothing stays the
[1:34:41] same okay
[1:34:43] he said I'm the resurrection
[1:34:47] Jairus daughter was dead
[1:34:50] but when Jesus came on the scene
[1:34:53] because he was alive
[1:34:55] she was resurrected
[1:34:59] situation this morning hello
[1:36:01] foreign
[1:37:05] [Music]
[1:37:07] Jesus speak to them plainly man
[1:37:12] and said Lazarus is dead
[1:37:16] he is gone gone
[1:37:20] that's when he said now let us go since
[1:37:24] it is now time for my glory to me
[1:37:30] so Jesus and his disciples are two
[1:37:33] different perspectives
[1:37:37] [Music]
[1:37:39] looking at the same situation
[1:37:42] but they perceived a difference
[1:37:46] when Jesus was looking at Lazarus deaths
[1:37:54] were looking at Lazarus
[1:38:00] they had a different perspective
[1:38:04] and the other time we talked about
[1:38:06] perspective a lot of functions
[1:38:10] perspective is what you see the first
[1:38:13] one
[1:38:17] after you see
[1:38:55] [Music]
[1:38:59] that's his perspective
[1:39:02] the young boy seated over there
[1:39:05] he can see my left side
[1:39:08] he can only see my right side
[1:39:11] he has a different perspective
[1:39:15] when he looks at me I'm not wearing him
[1:39:17] I don't have a microphone
[1:39:20] because from where you see that he's
[1:39:23] blinded he can't see it but
[1:39:26] from this side where brother Keith is
[1:39:29] he can see it because of where he is
[1:39:34] so your perspective
[1:39:37] how you see things
[1:39:39] determined by how you where you are
[1:39:43] so Jesus was seated in a different place
[1:39:46] from where the disciples were seated
[1:39:50] Jesus was sitting in Heavenly places
[1:39:54] were Seated on Earthly places
[1:40:00] that's why they could not see
[1:41:01] come from
[1:41:04] I'm up higher the holy people get into
[1:41:07] the Heavenly places
[1:41:09] you will start seeing your problems as
[1:41:11] testimonies
[1:41:14] you will start seeing your dad's
[1:41:16] situations
[1:41:19] on the scene and say Lord speak it will
[1:41:22] happen
[1:41:25] verse 17 says verses
[1:41:28] when Jesus came he found that he had
[1:41:30] laid in the grave for four days
[1:41:36] Lazarus was already in the grave for
[1:41:39] four days
[1:41:42] the situation was hopeless that
[1:41:44] situation
[1:41:46] was saying Lord please come and heal him
[1:41:50] they lost hope is put him in the grave
[1:41:53] hola they sealed him in hola family
[1:41:58] and say the Lazarus is done
[1:42:01] but God has Jesus has spoken a word
[1:42:04] Jesus
[1:42:41] my brother had not died
[1:42:44] she was Believing on Jesus
[1:42:47] say Lord you should have come back then
[1:42:51] but now he's dead
[1:42:54] he hopes we're gone
[1:42:56] but then she said but I know my energy
[1:42:59] measure said that even now Commandments
[1:43:03] no whatever you ask of the Lord
[1:43:05] God will give it these do I have someone
[1:43:09] this morning
[1:43:10] who still has faith and say whatever the
[1:43:14] situation
[1:43:18] God I know you can work a miracle in my
[1:43:20] life
[1:43:21] it doesn't matter how sick I am
[1:43:27] even now meant no I know you can still
[1:43:30] do it there and then Martha say that he
[1:43:34] was believing
[1:43:36] believing is the atmosphere that faith
[1:43:39] can work in atmosphere
[1:43:43] that's why in The Prophet's Ministry his
[1:43:46] theme was only believes
[1:43:51] it's that atmosphere says that makes all
[1:43:55] things possible so when you have that
[1:43:58] Faith Allah
[1:44:01] and you say I don't care what it looks
[1:44:03] like
[1:44:05] it's even now man no even this morning
[1:44:09] it might be four days later
[1:44:13] no I don't know how long your four days
[1:44:15] straight back come on come here your
[1:44:18] four days might have been two weeks
[1:44:20] might have been one month your four days
[1:44:23] might have been five years your four
[1:44:25] days might have been ten years but this
[1:44:28] morning just stand in your feet and say
[1:44:29] message
[1:44:31] no oh it looks so blessing oh God looks
[1:44:35] like it's done
[1:44:36] even now I know you can do it for me and
[1:44:41] God is able to do it it doesn't matter
[1:44:43] how hopeless
[1:44:44] because God wants to gather Glory it's
[1:44:48] all for his glory he wants to say I did
[1:44:52] that
[1:44:53] with a mighty hander yeah of a mighty
[1:44:57] conqueror he will smash you out of the
[1:44:59] arms of death
[1:45:01] he will run away that stone if I will do
[1:45:04] it it doesn't matter how much longer
[1:45:06] you've been gone
[1:45:07] God's hand is able to reach out
[1:45:11] and take you back
[1:45:13] hey man amen mother said
[1:45:17] no I still believe it
[1:45:21] Satan tries to bring discouragement to
[1:45:23] us
[1:45:26] and say look at all that
[1:45:28] you think you're gonna make it out
[1:45:31] just say I don't care
[1:45:33] even now man no God can still do it God
[1:45:38] did that before
[1:45:39] he can still do it man no so you gotta
[1:45:43] hold on to God's word
[1:45:45] like your life depends on it come on
[1:45:50] so hold on and stand on it I said Lord
[1:45:55] even this morning do it for me because
[1:45:59] you get the Glory
[1:46:01] Hallelujah Hallelujah the prophet of God
[1:46:04] in God's covenant he says
[1:46:07] he was talking about Jesus and Satan
[1:46:10] wouldn't say Jesus was being tempted
[1:46:13] he says
[1:46:15] easy and Jesus said to Satan it is also
[1:46:18] written
[1:46:21] and Jesus Took the father's word and
[1:46:23] defeated Satan right on his eyes
[1:46:29] you can look at the slide over here
[1:46:32] what did he do
[1:46:35] he was proving to the weakest of
[1:46:37] Christians
[1:46:41] that you can defeat Satan anyway
[1:46:48] the plain word of God
[1:46:51] just take it and say that says the Lord
[1:46:57] that the sickness is not going to take
[1:46:59] me but it is for His glory stand on that
[1:47:04] word
[1:47:06] stand on it today Lord this is for your
[1:47:10] glory and he will take you out of it
[1:47:14] verse
[1:47:47] the Bible said when he saw Lazarus
[1:47:50] friends and family crying
[1:47:55] he was touched by that feeling
[1:47:58] his son's friend was gone
[1:48:01] although Jesus was God
[1:48:05] he was not afraid to accept what he was
[1:48:07] feeling more
[1:48:11] Jesus was God Jesus and he was man
[1:48:14] either he was not 50 God
[1:48:18] 250 man
[1:48:20] because that would be unfair
[1:48:23] he is 50 God and 50 man see
[1:48:27] lessons you cannot feel everything that
[1:48:29] you feel
[1:48:30] sorry
[1:48:39] that's why he could feel the pain
[1:48:42] why he cried when he said
[1:48:46] because he was man but he was not man
[1:48:50] only man he was also God so Jesus is man
[1:48:54] enough
[1:49:00] God enough to not leave you in that
[1:49:03] situation
[1:49:04] so he was man enough to cry because his
[1:49:08] friend was gone but he was God enough
[1:49:40] the man he was working with for three
[1:49:43] years
[1:49:44] his disciples he was working for three
[1:49:46] years
[1:49:49] they rejected him when the time he
[1:49:52] needed them the most
[1:49:55] they say I don't know that man
[1:49:57] seen him in my life he knows the pain of
[1:50:01] rejection
[1:50:05] God says I know
[1:50:09] when you feel sick foreign
[1:52:01] [Applause]
[1:52:15] in my life
[1:52:17] I invite you to my situation
[1:52:21] invite you to my condition
[1:52:24] you are the only one who can deliver me
[1:52:27] call him on the scene and you'll be able
[1:52:31] to speak HR measure the ballet and Jesus
[1:52:33] say take care of the stone away is this
[1:52:35] your idea Mata the sis of him that was
[1:52:38] dead
[1:52:40] Lord but by this time he's already
[1:52:42] stinking please
[1:52:48] I don't care how many days
[1:52:52] hallelujah hallelujah because when the
[1:52:55] master is on the side he can turn around
[1:52:57] the situation
[1:52:59] then Jesus said unto her did I not say
[1:53:03] to you
[1:53:05] if you believe you shall see the glory
[1:53:08] of God did you roll that stone away I'm
[1:53:13] telling you this morning
[1:53:14] stand on God's word
[1:54:11] your name is not defeated
[1:54:17] foreign
[1:55:26] everything has to change
[1:55:28] when he speaks death when he speaks life
[1:55:31] to your dead situations
[1:55:34] he can turn it around
[1:55:36] we've never heard of men with decaying
[1:55:39] coming back to life
[1:55:43] but because Jesus wanted that Glory
[1:55:47] spoke and it happened and he that was
[1:55:51] dead he came forth a circuit is a bound
[1:55:55] hand and food with grave clothes
[1:55:58] his face was wrapped some of his eyes
[1:56:04] why he had come back in a situation
[1:56:08] where all hope was gone he came there
[1:56:12] right on time
[1:56:13] it might not be on time for you
[1:57:09] what kind of situation do you think it's
[1:57:12] gonna refuse to heal yes
[1:57:15] no situation that's gonna
[1:57:30] amen amen his body was already stinking

[1:58:19] face the situations
[1:58:22] Satan was already rejoicing let's
[1:58:25] situations
[1:58:29] but he said Jesus said you spoke too
[1:58:31] soon
[1:58:34] because his word spoke he is not going
[1:58:37] to die
[1:58:39] Satan might be rejoicing in your sins
[1:58:50] but when Jesus comes on the scene
[1:58:53] it's going to reverse
[1:58:55] Satan you rejoice too quick
[1:58:59] hey man amen it does not matter how long

[2:02:59] not feeling too good yeah
[2:03:01] and I was stressed it was it was the
[2:03:03] situation was bad I know the situations
[2:03:05] and I'll get phone calls in the middle
[2:03:08] of the night because of time differences
[2:03:12] and every time I got a phone call I was
[2:03:15] I didn't know what to expect I didn't
[2:03:16] know what I should work on my position
[2:03:19] and she was constantly getting the
[2:03:22] hospital back and forth
[2:03:24] the situation was not good
[2:03:27] I kept on praying Lord help my mother
[2:03:31] please touch her oh dushla please heal
[2:03:34] her again please deliver her out of the
[2:03:37] situation situation that went on for a
[2:03:39] little bit
[2:03:40] but one day
[2:03:42] I woke up in the middle of the night
[2:03:45] something woke me up in the middle
[2:03:49] I just got up and I started praying
[2:03:52] I prayed like I've never prayed
[2:03:56] and I felt that connection
[2:03:58] God had my prayers
[2:04:01] I was kneeling right there
[2:04:04] I had God's reassurance
[2:04:07] she was going to be healed
[2:04:10] she was not going to die and as soon as
[2:04:13] I had that insurance from God
[2:04:17] let me tell you this when God tells you
[2:04:19] you will know because you really can't
[2:04:21] judge no doubt about that
[2:04:23] because that reassurance
[2:04:26] I got up and within a minute I was
[2:04:28] asleep
[2:04:31] God has spoken
[2:04:35] I think the following couple of days
[2:04:38] I would get a phone call in the middle
[2:04:40] of the night
[2:04:41] I look at it it's from home
[2:04:52] and then my mom was healed
[2:04:55] that thing completely gone
[2:04:59] so she was telling me now
[2:05:01] she said I had a dream
[2:05:05] I hadn't told you that I my experience
[2:05:07] started walking up and prayed for her
[2:05:10] and then she said I had a dream
[2:05:15] I had a lot of demons that were
[2:05:16] tormenting me yeah
[2:05:19] that they were fighting me
[2:05:22] she said you just came out of nowhere
[2:05:27] you were looking pretty masculine
[2:05:32] um and then you came out and beat up all
[2:05:35] those demons
[2:05:39] but I said I know what that was hello
[2:05:45] when I pray concentrate When you pray
[2:05:48] your prayer goes faster yeah
[2:05:53] God can heal you God Can Transform that
[2:05:57] situation for me because you are a son
