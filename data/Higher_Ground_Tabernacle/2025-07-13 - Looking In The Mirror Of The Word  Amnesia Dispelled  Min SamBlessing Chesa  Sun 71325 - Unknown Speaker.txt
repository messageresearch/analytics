Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you only believe and receive what his word says towards you, he will never ever fail you. &gt;&gt; Let us just bow our heads and pray. Dear gracious heavenly father, &gt;&gt; our hearts are mellowed this morning, knowing, oh father god, that your steadfast love never ever fails. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, who else could we go to but to you, oh God, [Music] &gt;&gt; the author and the finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; Lord, you are the bishop of our souls. We know we can never ever be lost &gt;&gt; because you are the great shepherd who takes care of us. &gt;&gt; Father, this morning we are in your presence, oh God, &gt;&gt; not so we could hear from a man, but we want to hear you speak to us, oh God. Lord, we have come with different questions. &gt;&gt; We have come with different needs, oh God. But we know it's not our friend, it's not our brother who can supply those needs. But it is only you who can do that because you say in your word that you will supply all our needs according to your riches and glory. &gt;&gt; And we know those riches are unending. &gt;&gt; Lord, look at each and every raised hand in this place. You see the need behind be near each child. I pray you stretch forth your hand. Touch your children. Oh God. Provide for your children. Oh God. Deliver someone who needs deliverance. Lord as we are reading and speaking your word. I pray that your Holy Ghost might come and give action to the ministration of your word. We know we are not feeding off of a man [Music] feeding on the unfailing body word Jesus Christ. Say wherever the carcass is, that's where the eagles are gathered. &gt;&gt; Look at the gathering of the eagles this morning. We could look we're looking up to you &gt;&gt; for our providence Jesus Christ mighty uncontested name we pray believing amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm happy to be in the house of God Sunday morning. Amen. Just turn around and shake your neighbor's hand. Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? Amen. Let us remember the pastor in prayer. &gt;&gt; He has uh traveled to Iowa City. &gt;&gt; Iowa City. There is there is a wedding over there that he is um officiating &gt;&gt; and um he told us to recognize that on next weekend. &gt;&gt; We have a wedding for sister Naomi and brother Nathan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let us keep them in prayer &gt;&gt; so that Everything goes according to plan. &gt;&gt; Whilst we're standing, let us open our Bibles. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah chapter one. &gt;&gt; Amen. If one of the brothers could get me a clicker from the office, I left it on the desk. A clicker. In the book of Jeremiah chapter one verse 4, &gt;&gt; the Bible reads, &gt;&gt; "Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee, and before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctify thee and I ordain thee a prophet unto the nations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Also standing if you can go to the book of Ephesians chapter one and verse 4. The Bible reads, &gt;&gt; "According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love, &gt;&gt; having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add blessings to the reading of his word. We can take our seats. Amen. Amen. In the Bible verse that we read in Jeremiah, we see the Lord appeared to Jeremiah and he said, "Before I formed thee in the belly of your mother, &gt;&gt; I knew thee &gt;&gt; and I ordained thee unto a prophet &gt;&gt; to be a prophet unto the nations." So we see God is telling Jeremiah, &gt;&gt; before you were born, &gt;&gt; I had you on my mind before the foundation of the world, &gt;&gt; I knew thee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So that gives us an assurance to know that we don't serve a God who does things have happened, &gt;&gt; but he has already predestinated you. Before you were born, he already knew you. &gt;&gt; He already had set a purpose in your life before you were born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in Ephesians when we are reading it says according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. He predestinated yougest &gt;&gt; to be children of Jesus Christ. not for any other purpose. But for his will by reading the scriptures, &gt;&gt; we get an understanding that we have a representation that is in eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. this morning for a little while I want to speak on this subject. Looking in the mirror of the word, &gt;&gt; looking in the mirror of the word. &gt;&gt; And for a subtitle, &gt;&gt; it is amnesia dispersed. &gt;&gt; Dispelled. Amnesia dispelled. Yeah, the correct word is dispelled. Amnesia dispelled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we are looking at how God had us before the foundation of the world and we know we have a representation in heaven. &gt;&gt; And the only way you can know what you look like before the foundation of the world If you look into the word because before the beginning was the word after the beginning is still the word and the word of God never ever changes. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The Bible says heaven and earth shall pass away. But he says my word shall never pass away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So you know when you stand on God's word that is the only thing that is sure. &gt;&gt; It doesn't what it doesn't matter what people say. &gt;&gt; People change their minds daily. But God's word never changes. It's the same yesterday, today, and amen. Amen. When I was growing up going to school, we all know they told us your existence started when you got out of your mother. When you gave your first breath, that's when they say that's when you started existing. But we know that's not true. We thank God for the message of Malachi that came to open our eyes that told us that before there was the foundation of the world before there was an atom on this earth you were there. So we get to see in the word existence did not start on this earth that our existence started in eternity. Before God said, "Let there be light." You were there. Before God said, "Let every seed bring after [Music] You were there before he created the sun, the Jupiter and Mars. You was already there. &gt;&gt; When he created the angels, &gt;&gt; you were already there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he created Satan, you were there. So you have more seniority than Satan &gt;&gt; because Satan had a beginning &gt;&gt; and he for sure has an end. &gt;&gt; But you don't have a beginning and you do not have an end. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So you should not accept &gt;&gt; to live under your privileges downtrodden by a being that has a beginning and the end because you are like God. We come from God and we go back. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You remember when God was asking Job, he said, "Where were you, Job?" When the sons of God shouted for joy, I'm a witness this morning. I can say, "I was there shouting for joy before God created the foundations of the earth." How were we there? Because we were an attribute of God. &gt;&gt; You were in his thoughts. It might be hard to understand. &gt;&gt; But look at you. You were in your great great grandfather. You did not know it. But you were in his loins. You just had to wait for a specific time that God had predestinated &gt;&gt; for you to be made manifest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So wherever your grandfather went, you went with him. Whatever things he did, you did it with him. That's why they says there are diseases that runs down in the Jesus. in your DNA. A disease that runs in your DNA is coming from your grandfather. It is being passed down. But I'm glad to know that I come from my heavenly father &gt;&gt; and his DNA is in my body. Amen. Whatever he was, &gt;&gt; whatever he is, &gt;&gt; I can say I am. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we thank God, &gt;&gt; we can see in the scriptures &gt;&gt; that we had an existence before we came on this earth. But when we are leaving, you have to look in the mirror of the word so you can get to know what your true representation looks like. Our little peanut brain cannot comprehend because when you were born, you came with amnesia. &gt;&gt; You forgot your origin. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But the message of the hour came to open your eyes to let you know that you might have forgotten &gt;&gt; and he came to remind us that we come from God and after we are done conquering on this earthqu. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we're speaking on looking in the mirror of the world. amnesia dispelled. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the book of Timothy, &gt;&gt; it says, "Who hath saved us?" God who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, &gt;&gt; but according to his own purpose and grace, &gt;&gt; which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. He called you to his own purpose before the world even began. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Titus tells us that in hope of eternal life, &gt;&gt; which God that cannot lie, &gt;&gt; promised before the world began. Hallelujah. So you have eternal life. It does not start when you were saved, but it started before the foundation of the world. Because eternal means no beginning, no end. So if you start getting eternal life when you are saved, it means it has a starting point. [Music] It already began before the foundation of the world. Your salvation just brought you to that realization that I am a son of God. I am a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said in the church ages, it says, "Now it says that he has chosen us in him. Jesus before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; That means we were right there with him in the mind. Thoughts of God before the foundation of the world. That gives an eternal quality to the elect. Hallelujah. Look at that. You cannot get away from that. You cannot get away from the eternal quality [Music] that God plays in you. Why? Because you were right there with him. And even still right now, you are still right there with him. So you cannot get away from it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many are glad to know that you have a representation in heaven? The brother of God calls them theophanes. &gt;&gt; You and me, we have theophony. &gt;&gt; When you heard the message of the hour, he says you heard from your theophony. There is that invisible connection &gt;&gt; that you cannot see but you are hearing from the heavenlies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In um the rapture &gt;&gt; the prophet of God says &gt;&gt; now so were you were you in if you've got eternal life &gt;&gt; you were in God before there ever was a world. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are a part, &gt;&gt; a son of God, &gt;&gt; an attribute of God, &gt;&gt; an attribute. &gt;&gt; He know the very age you were coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You did not just appear haphazardly. People might call you a mistake, but you are not a mistake. God predestinated you. &gt;&gt; He was intentional in making you come to pass. You knew what he was doing. He predestinated you to that age. You take that place and no one else can take it. It doesn't matter how many impersonations and things. You've got to be there, brother, sister. No one can take your place because your place is yours. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There is not enough gossip that can take you out of your place because God's predestination stands. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You remember David in the Bible. He was supposed to be anointed to be king. And they had the seven brothers coming. They tried to pour the oil, but the oil was not there. The oil was not meant for Eliah. It was not meant for Elisha, &gt;&gt; but it was meant for David because he was predestinated for that particular age and no one else could take it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So that anointing was only meant for David. So what is meant for you, it is meant for you. There is no man that can take you out of your position because God has predestinated you. And he says you've got to be there because he knew you would be there. Now you are made manifest so you can fellowship with him. If you don't know what your purpose is, go to God in prayer and you say, "Lord, may you please make manifest &gt;&gt; what you predestinated me to be &gt;&gt; because Daniel wanted to sit where you are seated right now." Daniel wanted to live in Leodia. &gt;&gt; He saw you hearing the message of the hour. And he says, "Lord, please may you make me come in that age." And he says, "No, go thy way, Daniel." &gt;&gt; Why did he refuse? He reject Daniel to come in Leodysia. Because it was for you. Leodio was predestinated for you. And Daniel could not take it. So there is no one else who can take that place from you. Your prayer should should be Lord please make manifest manifest &gt;&gt; what you have predestinated for me &gt;&gt; because I know there is no impersonation that can take your predestination away from me. There is not enough sin that can take you out of the predestination of God. There is not enough demons in hell that can take you out of the predestination of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why? You can never ever fail because you are the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When Jesus came, &gt;&gt; Jesus was the word made flesh and he dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; He stepped from his theophony and he came into this terrestrial body. But we know we came from the thoughts of God from being an attribute. We bypassed our theophony which is the word body. So we bypassed our word body and we came into this flesh. Amen. Amen. But we know we are not supposed to remain flesh &gt;&gt; because we have a word bridegroom. who's supposed to be married to the word bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So you, the bride, which is flesh, &gt;&gt; has to be transformed to become the word, &gt;&gt; which is what God had in his mind for you [Music] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are the bride of Christ, &gt;&gt; the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; And Christ is the word. You are supposed to become the word. The prophet of God says the body of Jesus Christ which is the bride will be part of his body which he was the word and the bride will have to be the word. Word added to word add to word. Hallelujah. And we know the word never ever fails. So if the word never ever fails, you the bride are supposed to come in to be the word. It means you can never ever fail because you are becoming the word. what God had for you before the foundation of the world. Before God had seen you when he said before you were born, I knew thee. What was he talking about? He was talking about the bride word. That's what you were supposed to become. &gt;&gt; So when you look into the mirror of the word, You are seeing the picture that you are supposed to transform. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In Isaiah it says, "So shall my word, &gt;&gt; be that goeth forth out of my mouth, it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. [Music] You are the bride that is supposed to become the word. So where it says the word, you can put your name right there and you can say so shall I. The son of God, the daughter of God. Amen. Going out from the mouth of God. That is a spoken word. A spoken word is a thought expressed. So how do you become the word? By listening to the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; Remember Revelation says the bride has made herself ready. Made herself ready with what? With the spoken word. The message the word was not revealed in our day for nothing. But it was revealed so you can see and look into the mirror. I am supposed to become the word. This is the only way I can be the bride of Christ. So you can say I shall not return unto God void after I have accomplished that which God pleases and I shall prosper in whatever that God has sent me for. Hallelujah. There is not enough devils in hell &gt;&gt; that can stop you from completing God's purpose in your life. Hallelujah. There is not enough trials that can stop you because you are the word and you will accomplish each and everything that God said you will accomplish. Have breath in your body this morning. Why do you have breath? Because God is not yet done with you. He was done with you. you wouldn't be alive this morning because the prophet of God tells us you don't stay five minutes longer when God is done with you. Hallelujah. So the mere fact that I'm standing here today. I got breath in my body. I know God is not yet done with me. I have a purpose to accomplish. And I know that purpose it is going to prosper. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you are the word. You have the authority of the word. Remember the word carries the authority as the person who spoke it. So you have the authority that God had. That's why you can never ever fail. The word has never failed. &gt;&gt; It is not failing right now and it will never fail. &gt;&gt; Why would God start failing on you this morning? He will never ever fail you because you are a part of him and you will always be victorious. Hallelujah. There is not enough sickness that can stop you from accomplishing the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is not enough trials that can stop you from accomplishing the purpose of God. Not enough addictions. Not enough afflictions. &gt;&gt; Not enough depression &gt;&gt; that can stop you. from getting to what God purpose you to. Hallelujah. There is no anxiety. Even your own sin cannot stop you in accomplishing his purpose in your life. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There is no curse that can stand in your way. You can say your great greatgrandfather was cursed that you and your children would never prosper in life. &gt;&gt; That you will never ever make it in life. But I know Jesus when he hung on that cross. He broke that curse. So you can stand. You can curse that curse and say you have no authority. over me because I am the word of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because you are the word. You can be delivered &gt;&gt; from the chains that's binding you &gt;&gt; because God's word never fails. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We were born on this earth with amnesia and we didn't know who we were. We thank God for the message of the word. We thank God for the opening of the word. We are no longer in confusion. We don't it's we are not people who are tossed about like we don't know what's going on. But God's word is sure because we know we have heard from our theophony. We have a representation in heaven. In Psalms 119, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "Forever, oh Lord, &gt;&gt; thy word is settled in heaven &gt;&gt; before it ever happens on earth, it is already done in heaven. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why when God when the disciples asked Jesus, how should we pray?" He said you pray saying let your will be done &gt;&gt; on earth as it is in heaven. Why? Because thy word is settled in heaven. You are the word. You are settled in heaven. Your theophony does not have any sicknesses. Amen. Your theophony does not have infirmities. So when you are feeling sick, you got to kneel down and pray. He said, "Oh Lord, forever your word is settled in heaven. I know my theophony is settled in heaven. My theophony is not sick. So I need to be that. So I claim my healing because let it be on earth as it is in heaven. And God is not a man that he should lie. He will hear your heart's prayer. He will hear your heart's cry. He said, "If my people who are called by my name, if they humble themselves and pray," he says, "I will hear from heaven," not only will he hear and you said, "I will hear and I will heal your name." If you have a need this morning, just get on your knees &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, I'm humbly coming before you because I know your word never fails. It never fail for the children of Israel. I know it's not going to fail for me." You say, "Lord, heal my land." You say, "Lord, heal my children." You say, "Lord, heal my bank account. He has no restrictions. &gt;&gt; He has no boundaries. &gt;&gt; He will say, he said, I will supply your needs &gt;&gt; according to my riches and glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I know he owns everything in this whole world. He owns all the gold. He owns all the diamond. So how is he going to fail you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He will always come through for you. So you got to pray and say, "Lord, let your will be done on earth that is in heaven." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And his word &gt;&gt; will be made manifest in your life because remember you have a representation that is in heaven that is perfect &gt;&gt; without spot, &gt;&gt; without any wrinkle. without any blemish. &gt;&gt; That's why he said in his word, "There shall be a glorious church without spot or wrinkle and no blemish &gt;&gt; unto him." &gt;&gt; Why? Because the bride which is supposed to become the word is taking her position as she was before the foundation of the world. And you can only be spot without wrinkle if you look into the mirror of the word of God because a mirror never lies. The mirror shows you who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when we were born on this earth, we were born with amnesia. We forgot everything. This brain cannot even go far. Your brain cannot even comprehend the word eternity. Eternity. We all say eternity. Eternity. &gt;&gt; But just ask yourself for a minute. What does eternity mean? No beginning. Can your mind comprehend something that doesn't have? Can your mind comprehend something that doesn't have no end? You cannot comprehend it &gt;&gt; because our brain is fogged with amnesia. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But it's only the word that could dispel that amnesia. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Growing up, &gt;&gt; being exposed to all these things in the world, We forgot where we came from. We forgot who we are supposed to be coming up as little kids seeing all the different things having an impact on your brain and that's all you know that's all you think about. There is no way for your mind to go back to eternity. That's why parents you need to be careful what you are exposing your children to because their brain makes vivid imagination. [Music] Whatever you show them, it's going to stick with them and it will make a longlasting impact. But we thank God for godly mamas. Amen. Who sit down with their children and teach them the word. The prophet of God calls them the fifth gospel. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you your uh your your children have they have your ear. &gt;&gt; They listen to you. &gt;&gt; So you better make sure you are imparting the right thing to them. I remember when I was growing up, the foundation that I have of the Bible, &gt;&gt; I didn't get it in church. I got it from home. Every night before I went to bed, my mom would read the Bible to me, &gt;&gt; read a Bible story to me, tell me what it means, tell me all the lessons it is, read the story of Jonah, telling me that you are supposed to listen to God. Oh, the foundation I had, it was because of a prayerful mother. who was taking her time every night to make sure I had a grasp on it. Remember the word says, "Train a child the way they are supposed to come out. When they grow up, they will not depart from it. So you would have done your duty. Say, Lord, I have done all I can. I put the rest in your hands. God's word never fails. He says that way will never depart from them. They might get lost along the way. But that word is a campus. It will bring them right back. Amen. Amen. So you better be careful what they are watching. The prophet tells us that eyes are the door to the soul. &gt;&gt; So whatever you see is not just ending on your eyes but it is going all the way into your soul and it is maturing in there and it will start affecting your actions. You let your kids watch you watch Superman Superman. After watching that movie of Superman, &gt;&gt; you see they'll go get a sheet and tie it around their neck and they start running around trying to be like Superman. Give them to watch Spider-Man. Spider-Man, &gt;&gt; you're going to be chasing all over in the house, jumping up and down the couches because Superman had an impact in them. They want to be like him, too. &gt;&gt; They want to fly around. Imagine other things that are evil that are getting into their mind. What are they going to do after that? So you need to be watchful. You need to be on the guard on what they are watching. Teach your children the word of God before they go to bed. [Music] They are supposed to know that every day I need to pray. Every day when I wake up in the morning, I'm supposed to talk to my maker. &gt;&gt; They might not know what's going on, &gt;&gt; but down the road they will remember that. But the other day when we had a situation back home, daddy and mama prayed and God came and answered. If I pray right now, &gt;&gt; I know the same God can hear me too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We all know of Susanna Wesleyanesley. &gt;&gt; She had 19 children. &gt;&gt; But she had three hours every day to teach them the word &gt;&gt; and to pray. &gt;&gt; And those days, they didn't have water that's running on the tank. They had to go and bring up the water in a well. When they were doing laundry, they had to manually do the laundry. But nowadays, the things you could do in three days, you can do it in three hours. You can do laundry whilst you're not in the laundry room. You just press a button in the vegetable. You can cook a whole meal without you being in the kitchen. You can get your groceries without even going grocery shopping. What's in your house? All the things you could do in three days, you can do it in a moment. People back then in the days they use a horse and buggy, &gt;&gt; I don't know how many days they would take to go to Chicago, but you just take about four hours. But with all that ease, with all that ease, &gt;&gt; we don't have no time. We have all these things to help us save time, but we don't we still don't got enough time. The more we get, the less time we get, we don't have enough time to consecrate in prayer. But look at Susanna Wesley. Because of her dedication to her children, teaching them the word of God, &gt;&gt; they came out the revivalist. John Wesley Wesley, &gt;&gt; Charles Wesley, &gt;&gt; Charles Wesley, &gt;&gt; the greatest one of the greatest composers in history. &gt;&gt; And John Wesley, the the the sixth eighth me sixth age messenger. &gt;&gt; John Wesley, &gt;&gt; sixth church age messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. because that came from a mother who was teaching her children the word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So you don't know who you are raising. You might be raising an evangelist. You might be raising a great witnesser for the word of God. But you stay and just teach them the word. The prophet of God talks about this story of there's five there's a family that had five boys and when this five boy they were all staying in the same house when the first boy graduated he left and he went to the navy second fourth fifth all they went to the navy Then they sat down to investigate. &gt;&gt; They started asking, "Are you the one who was telling your children to get to the Navy?" They say, "No." &gt;&gt; They asked those boys. Did you discuss and say, "Hey, when we are done, we need to go to the Navy." They said, "No, we never ever talked about it. So they were trying to figure out and find out &gt;&gt; what was influencing this children. Then they found out &gt;&gt; that in their bedroom. &gt;&gt; They all they all slept in the same bedroom. There was a big picture of a ship that was sailing on the calm sea. And that picture was influencing them. So every morning when they woke up, the ship is the first thing they saw before going to bed. The ship is the last thing they saw. If one just walked into his room, what they saw on the wall was the sheep on the sea. And it had an impact on them &gt;&gt; and they started craving for that. &gt;&gt; They had an unknowingly desire to be in that ship. So you see the impact that that ship, the future of the ship had on them. the rest of their lives. For the rest of my life, I want to be in the Navy. It was because of a ship picture of a ship. And the prophet of God says, "Now if the picture of a shu impressed boys to become navy men, sailors of the sea, &gt;&gt; what are the picture of the Lord Jesus Christ? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Always have the right thing before your children. Bring up a child in the way that it should go. &gt;&gt; Bring it up and teach it right. It will certainly won't depart from it. If you let your children hang the pictures of Michael Jackson, what do you expect them to do? They're going to start break dancing and moonwalking. That's all they are seeing. Michael Jackson is having an impact on them. &gt;&gt; So you need to be careful and look what do you have in your room. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Cuz that will have an impact on your life. You should have a picture of the Lord Jesus Christ in your house. Amen. Amen. Every time you wake up, you are looking at your savior and you say, "Thank you, Lord, for giving me the breath of life." &gt;&gt; Before you go to bed, you are looking at the face of Jesus Christ. And you say, "Thank you, Lord, for taking me through the day. [Music] If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have made it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you put the right thing in front of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God will always make sure &gt;&gt; that he is faithful to his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we are speaking about looking into the mirror of the word and realizing what our picture we are supposed to look like. and by the word conform into the image that God has for us which was before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what people say about you. What matters is what God says about you because you don't know my real picture. You have never seen the real me because my real me is my soul. My soul has a representation in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So you don't have a right to tell me what I can do or not do based on what you think if it goes against the word of God. What I listen to is what God says about me. What you think about yourself doesn't even matter. contradicts the word of God because you are not working in your purpose but whatever you are doing you say Lord what do you want for me in my life and you walk in that because that's what you want so your prayer is supposed to be Lord I want to come to the full potential [Music] what you had me in your mind before the foundation of the world. When people look at you, they might see a liar. But when God looks at you, he is not seeing a liar. He is a son of God. People look at you and they say you are a drunk. God is looking at you. He is seeing his son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. People are calling you what they think by what they are seeing. &gt;&gt; But God looks at what he had for you before the foundation of the world. You remember that prostitute wiping the feet of Jesus with her hair and broke her alabaster box, &gt;&gt; washing the feet of Jesus with her tears. People were calling her a prostitute. Mary Magdalene. Mary Magdalene. &gt;&gt; People were calling her a prostitute. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus was looking at her, &gt;&gt; he wasn't seeing a prostitute. &gt;&gt; He saw a candidate to receive the Holy Ghost. He says, "You are going to receive the Holy Ghost." She was one of those who were in the upper chamber. [Music] The Pharisees would not probably not even allow her in church. God was looking different. She was one of the first witnesses [Music] to witness the resurrection of Jesus. Hallelujah. Why? Because when Jes when she met Jesus, she looked into the mirror of the word and she said, "I'm removing this old garment. I'm no longer a prostitute, &gt;&gt; but I am a daughter of God." Rahab was a prostitute. &gt;&gt; But when God was looking at her, he said, "You are the great grandmother of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He grafted her. into the genealogy of Jesus. &gt;&gt; But when people were looking at her, they were saying she is a prostitute. &gt;&gt; But when God was looking at her, he was looking at his blood. Remember, God does not look at you. He looks at your representation. Your representation says you are perfect. Blameless. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So look at what God has for you. The children of Israel were supposed to get in uh to to cross over to the promised land. &gt;&gt; If they used the quicker route, they were going to take three days to move from uh from to move from Egypt to go to the promised land. But God allowed them to wander in the wilderness for 40 years. If they had gotten to the promised land in three days, where would Raha be? [Music] She probably wasn't even born yet. And God in his multi-purpose of planning his things, &gt;&gt; he had Rahab on his mind. By the end of those 40 years, Rahab was ready. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because why? She was important to God. You are important to God. People might make you think that a you are not worth much. But you are important to God. God could change a whole route. Someone who was considered a prostitute. What about you, the bride of Christ? He can change situations. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, you are supposed to call yourself what God knows you as the book of judges. We read of Gideon. The angel of the Lord came to Gideon. Gideon was busy hiding. In verse 11 it says, "And there came an angel of the Lord and set on an oak which is an in offer that pertain to Jo the Aizeride." His son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the Medidianites. He was in an act of cowardice. He was busy hiding from the enemy. But whilst he was in the act of hiding from the enemy, the angel of the Lord came to him and he says, "The Lord is with thee." Thou mighty man of valor. Is he a mighty man of valor? When he is hiding, running away from God had another representation of Gideon that he is a mighty warrior that he is a mighty man of valor and he brought victory to the children of Israel. Why? Because he realized he looked into the mirror of what God was saying about him and saying right now I look like a coward, but the word of God is telling me that I am a mighty man of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This morning you got to stand up and say, &gt;&gt; "Lord, what are you saying about me?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I might be in the I might be in the state of cowering and hiding away from my enemies. But the word of God comes to you and tells you, you are a mighty man of God. You are more than a conqueror. You say I have so much sin. I have so many things I cannot overcome. When the word of God comes to you, it tells you you are blameless. You have done it in the first place. You are without spot or wrinkle. You don't have a blemish because that's what God &gt;&gt; knows you as. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Moving on to Shem. God. She was right there. They were being terrorized by the Philistines. And he was there thinking. &gt;&gt; He was looking at his wife. &gt;&gt; He saw his wife and their his kids, they were getting they were getting frail because every time they had a harvest, &gt;&gt; the Philistines would come and take it away from them. And he was there pondering, stressing out, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; But then he remembered. &gt;&gt; He says, "I am a son of Abraham. This is the prophet of God says begin to think, &gt;&gt; but I am a son of Abraham. &gt;&gt; I am of the tribe and the lineage. circumcised &gt;&gt; and I know that my God still lives &gt;&gt; and there is a crisis at hand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of the Lord came upon him. When did the spirit of the Lord come upon him? You realize he has a representation in the word and that representation says he's the son of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As soon as he got that revelation, he was anointed by the spirit of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, do you have a crisis at hand this morning? Just look into that word. He tells you you are a son of Abraham. tells you you are a daughter of Abraham. As soon as you get that revelation, &gt;&gt; God will anoint you. You anoint you with a spirit of overcoming. Abraham was an overcomer. So shame, he realizes there's a crisis at hand and you said, "I've been living under my privileges for too long, but because I'm a son of Abraham, the promise that God gave to Abraham, my father, it applies to me." And the spirit of the Lord come upon him. &gt;&gt; He did not have any training to be a soldier. You do not have any warfare training. You didn't know which weapon to use or not use. He took a little stick, which is an ox god. And he ran out there in the middle of the road with that ox god in his hand. He started getting reckless because you were standing on the word of God. Hallelujah. Remember David got reckless. when he saw Goliath because he said, "I have an anointing of being a king in my life. &gt;&gt; So Goliath is not going to kill me until I become king. So it doesn't matter what I do. I know I'm going to overcome." And Shem stood right there. And he said, "I am a son of Abraham." and he was anointed and he said, "We have a promise to possess the gates of the enemy." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I might not have a spear. I might not have a sword. I don't know how that is going to happen. All I know is I'm going to possess the gate." He stood in the middle of the road and he whooped all of them 600 Philistines. How did it happen? I don't know. All I know is he possessed the gates of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Why? Because he know that he was a Israelite. He had a right. He had a right to his God-given rights. Brother, sister, you have a right to your God-given right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word of God tells us you are the children of Abraham. Galatians 3 says, "Know ye therefore, they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham." &gt;&gt; So you are a son of Abraham. &gt;&gt; You are a daughter of Abraham. The promise of Abraham. It is for you this morning. You get that revelation. You look into the mirror of the word. Say, Lord, &gt;&gt; I'm stepping into that perfect vision. I know no enemy can stand before me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, you have rights. God-given rights. And the Holy Ghost will enforce those God-given rights. Amen. And the prophet of God says, "And any man here that's circumcised by the spirit of God that's born again, any of you people that's sick, the devil is a bluff. The devil is a liar." You can look at him in the face and say, "You are a liar. He doesn't have the ability of telling the truth." So whatever he says the opposite is true if he says you cannot make it I have already make it made it. If he says you cannot be healed you can say because you are a liar I am already healed. If he says you cannot be bride thank you for letting me know. I already know. &gt;&gt; I have already made it. &gt;&gt; God has accepted me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why? Because when God is looking at you, he looks at your representation. &gt;&gt; And God has already accepted you. &gt;&gt; Remember why did God accept the sacrifice of Abel? Because he had already accepted Abel before his sacrifice. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you have been already accepted. Why? Because we know the lamb of God, our ultimate sacrifice. &gt;&gt; He was sacrificed on the cross of Calvary. &gt;&gt; God accepted that sacrifice. Because God accepted that sacrifice, &gt;&gt; I know he had already accepted me &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I know I'm already accepted. &gt;&gt; Satan cannot tell me I'm not going to make it. Satan cannot tell me I'm not brid. But I know I have already made it. Why? God already accepted me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan lie to you this morning. He might tell you you have crossed the line of judgment that you are in this place this morning. God has not forgotten about you. The fact that you are saying amen to the word of God because you are hearing from your theophony because you are hearing it from your theophony that you have already made it. You might fall today, get up tomorrow. But because God has already accepted you, he accepted the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. So when he said it is finished, everything was finished. I don't care what it is. You can also stand and say in the face of the devil, you can say it is finished. My trials are finished. My addictions are finished. &gt;&gt; My shortcomings are finished. &gt;&gt; The sin you've been struggling with for so many years, you're going to look the devil in the face and say, "It was not like this and the mind of God. When I stand in the mirror of the word of God, I stand in the stature of a perfect man. God looks at me. He says, "You haven't done it in the first place." So I know I have not done it. Satan is the accuser of brethren, but he cannot accuse you anymore because the sacrifice of Jesus once and for all, you don't need any other sacrifice. what Jesus did on the cross of Calvary. It is enough for you. &gt;&gt; He did it 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; So you don't have to wait for another sacrifice. You don't need another forgiving. You need to know. He already did it. It is done and settled. You just have to believe and claim and say, "Lord, what you did 2,000 years ago I claim it this morning. What you did for me on the cross of Calvary, I claim it. &gt;&gt; What you did for me before the foundation of the world, claim it in Jesus name because God's word never fails. You are the spoken word. The spoken word of God never fails. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why does it not fail? because you are a part of God. We thank God for the opening of the seals, the opening of the word of God to open our eyes. &gt;&gt; That brother, sister, you are on the back part of God's word. God had you on his mind. He thought of you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When Jesus was walking to Calvary, he could have stopped and not go anymore. But what he thought of you, he thought of himself. He saw where you are seated right now. And he says, "Father, nevertheless, I will go. It doesn't matter how hard it is." And remember, he went on as a man. He carried your sin. He carried your affliction. And he felt each and every lick that those Roman soldiers put on him. But he says, "I will go." He had that crown of thorns on his head. He says, "Father, nevertheless, because of my daughter, I see my son in 2024. He's trying to overcome. Satan is trying to confuse him. But because of him, I will go all the way. I will pay the price. &gt;&gt; So brother, sister, today you can stand and you say, "I am bloodbought, blood purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ." And he paid the full price. He paid a debt he did not owe. Hallelujah. You owe me debt you could not pay. But I'm so glad Christ Jesus, &gt;&gt; he paid it all for me. So now I stand justified and I can say, "Oh yes, I am a child of the king because his royal blood flows through my veins. I who was wretched and vile now can say praise God. &gt;&gt; I am a child of the king. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say praise God? I am a child of the king. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You got to stand up on your feet, walk with your chest out and say, "I am royalty." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is no rod block that can stop you because you are royalty. The blood of Christ flows in your veins. Oh, hallelujah. Let it stand upon our feet. Oh brother, sisters, you have made it. You have made it. the picture that God had you &gt;&gt; on the back part of his mind, &gt;&gt; it will never ever fail. &gt;&gt; Because he is God and because he is God, he will never fail. And because you are a part of God also never fail. So you got to know that each and every promise concerning you that is in the word of God Claim it. Believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you believe it, &gt;&gt; it will become made manifest in your life. &gt;&gt; Remember when the angel came to Mary, he says, Mary, you shall give birth, a son, and he shall be called Jesus. She says, I don't know how that's going to happen. &gt;&gt; But because she was standing on the word, She says, "Lord, let it be unto me according to thy word." The prophet said, "As soon as she say that, that's when conception took place." As soon as you believe the word of God, that's when he will start working on you. That's when it will start having an effect in your life. So whatever it is just say Lord I believe Lord I receive. &gt;&gt; There is a reason why only believe was it was a theme in the ministry of God. They say the angel loves that song. Why? Because believing is an atmosphere atmosphere where all things can be made possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is here this morning. &gt;&gt; He's here to hear your heart's cry. Devil, the devil might say you might not feel him. You don't have to because the word of God says the high priest is touched by the feeling of our infirmities. &gt;&gt; Whatever you are going through right now, &gt;&gt; he says, "I know. He can feel it. God who hears and when he hears, he will answer your prayer. So only believe all things are possible. &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; let it be unto me according to you." &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; I receive. Lord, &gt;&gt; I believe. Only [Music] believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Oh, live. Oh, we believe. All things are possible. only just raise your voice and say only believe. &gt;&gt; Let us just raise our hands and worship him this morning. Say, "Lord, I believe each and every word you spoke &gt;&gt; concerning me. I receive each and every one of it. Only, only believe. Only believe." Oh, we believe [Music] all things are possible. Oh, oh, sing. Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; He is here to hear your heart's cry. He is here to answer your needs. Don't let him pass by. Say pass me. [Music] Oh for Jesus. Jesus is here. You don't have to be loud, &gt;&gt; but he can hear your heart cry. And when you call for him, &gt;&gt; he will draw nigh to you, [Music] &gt;&gt; he is here for you this morning. &gt;&gt; Just reach out and touch the hem of his garment. &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. [Applause] I know [Music] all things are possible in the presence of the Almighty God. It doesn't matter what it is. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how long it has, &gt;&gt; but because you are in the presence of the Lord, he will take care of your need. He can strike forth his hand and touch you. He can change your situation. &gt;&gt; You can say, "I've been struggling with this for 20 years." &gt;&gt; Remember the woman who had the issue of blood touch that he often [Music] believed.

He is here to stop that issue. Lord, I believe all things are possible. [Music] Yes, Lord. Let's raise our voices and say, "Lord, I receive." Lord, say, "Lord, I receive what you did for me on Calvary. I know your sacrifice was enough for me. When you said it is finished, &gt;&gt; I receive it right now. Say, Lord, I receive. [Music] Lord, I raise your voice and say, Lord, I receive. All things are possible. Lord, I pray. Jesus is here. Oh brother, sister, he is here to hear us. He is not a man that he should lie, but his word will come to pass in your life. Just say, Lord, I'm accepting what you did. I'm accepting your promises. &gt;&gt; You said, I'm blameless. I'm claiming it. Say, &gt;&gt; I see so many spots and wrinkles. But I claim that I'm blameless. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. [Music] Jesus, as the music plays, wherever you are, just talk to your maker. He's here to hear your heart. He is touched by the filling of your infirmity. Say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; thank you for the opening of your word. Now I know &gt;&gt; that I am a son of God. I know I have a representation in glory. Representation will never fail. And because I have a representation, I know I have already made it. &gt;&gt; Satan, you are a bluff. You cannot do nothing to God's children. You are defeated this morning. &gt;&gt; You have no right to put your dirty hands on the children of God. Dear heavenly father, &gt;&gt; I pray you straighten out your hand.
