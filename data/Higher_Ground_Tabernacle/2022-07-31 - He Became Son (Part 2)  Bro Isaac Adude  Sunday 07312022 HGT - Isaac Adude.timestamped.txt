[35:55] amen um
[35:59] let's let's um open up bibles in the
[36:01] book of genesis chapter 28.
[36:06] which
[36:13] we'll read the verse 15. it's only the
[36:16] verse
[36:25] genesis chapter 28 verse 6 verse 15.
[36:31] the bible says happy birthday and behold
[36:34] i am with thee
[36:36] and i will keep the in all places
[36:40] whether thou goest
[36:42] and will bring thee again into this land
[36:45] for i will not leave thee
[36:47] until i have done that which i have
[36:49] spoken of deal
[36:51] with
[37:06] we read verse uh 19 to 28.
[37:13] amen
[37:16] amen i was just thinking just right now
[37:20] meant to know how you know
[37:22] brother brooks how brother brooks does
[37:24] it preaching every day like every single
[37:27] service that's what the
[37:30] service it's it's tiring for sure
[37:34] just the only three services that i've
[37:36] been preaching it's just
[37:38] uh selfies amen
[37:40] i'm feeling it like it's really really
[37:43] is it it's all right amen let's go to uh
[37:45] hebrews chapter nine we read the verse
[37:47] nineteen to twenty-eight
[37:58] for when moses had spoken every precept
[38:01] to all the people according to the law
[38:05] he took the blood of cows and of goats
[38:08] with water and call it it's called a
[38:10] wool
[38:11] and highs up and sprinkled both the book
[38:15] and all the people
[38:31] saying this is the blood of the
[38:33] this is the blood of the
[38:35] of the testament
[38:37] which god has enjoined unto unto you
[38:44] all moreover sprinkle with blood both
[38:48] the tabernacle and all the vessels of
[38:50] the ministry
[38:57] and almost all things are by the law
[39:00] purged with blood and without shedding
[39:02] of blood
[39:03] remission
[39:05] [Music]
[39:11] it was
[39:12] therefore necessary
[39:15] that the patterns of things in having
[39:17] the heavens shall be purified with these
[39:20] by the heavenly things themselves with
[39:22] better sacrifices than these
[39:26] necessities
[39:36] for christ is not
[39:37] entered into the holy places made with
[39:40] hands which are the figures of the
[39:43] of the true but in the heaven itself now
[39:48] to appear in the presence of god for us
[39:54] sanctuary
[40:06] often
[40:07] as the high priest enters
[40:09] into the holy place every year with
[40:12] blood of others
[40:22] for must he often have suffered since
[40:25] the foundation of the world
[40:27] but now once in the end of the world has
[40:29] appeared to put away sin by the
[40:32] sacrifice of of himself
[40:46] and as it is appointed unto men who
[40:48] wants to die but after this judgment so
[40:52] christ was once offered
[40:54] to bear the sins of many and unto them
[40:58] that look for him shall he appear the
[41:00] second time without seeing under
[41:02] salvation
[41:19] and almost all things are by the law
[41:21] purged with blood and without shedding
[41:24] of blood is no remission
[41:26] um the memphis kisitofer verse 22.
[41:31] um
[41:39] [Music]
[41:47] we just read your word father
[41:50] that we pray to father god that you come
[41:52] and you open it to us
[41:55] lord because the prophet usually say
[41:59] that man can turn the pages of this book
[42:04] but you are the only one who can give
[42:06] the true meaning of those the words that
[42:08] we read
[42:12] that's why we pray that you the great
[42:14] teacher
[42:29] amen this morning uh
[42:32] by god's grace i would like to continue
[42:34] with what we
[42:35] were preaching on wednesday
[42:40] amen the title was he became son
[42:46] amen because as we we said it last
[42:49] sunday
[42:52] amen that god who was before the
[42:55] beginning
[43:11] he made himself into a form that we call
[43:14] the logos
[43:18] amen and then from there he started to
[43:21] create
[43:23] and that's where that's when the time
[43:26] began
[43:28] and then from the logos
[43:30] he took a flesh
[43:49] that god had to come under three sons
[43:52] and sons names
[43:56] amen first of all he had to come as a
[43:58] son of man
[44:01] as a prophet
[44:03] because that's what the word tells us
[44:06] when moses said that he will he will
[44:09] raise a prophet like unto unto me
[44:14] when that prophet will speak
[44:17] you have to listen to what he says
[44:22] the key of the kingdom of god
[44:25] and we know that the bible tells us that
[44:27] he came as a son of man
[44:31] that was jesus in the flesh
[44:34] so the prophet says that he had to die
[44:38] go up and then come back as a son of god
[44:43] which is the holy spirit
[44:46] is praying amen god in the form of the
[44:48] spirit jesus from this amen now at this
[44:50] time he will he didn't come back down to
[44:53] be
[44:54] with us
[44:57] but he came down to be in us
[45:00] amen as the son of god
[45:16] millennium amen so now the sun
[45:20] is
[45:21] is the form that god takes to uh uh um
[45:25] to appear or to uh to to to be with his
[45:29] people see the form to draft
[45:33] amen it's the form that god takes if you
[45:36] want to do a work he takes that form of
[45:38] his son
[45:41] amen because the bible tells us that god
[45:43] is a spiritual
[46:07] so that's why we read the quote of the
[46:09] prophet that says that that logos that
[46:11] was in the beginning
[46:24] everything was created by him and for
[46:26] him
[46:28] amen and that the prophet says that and
[46:30] between the son of god and and the son
[46:33] of david the prophet
[46:37] even he has to return back again as the
[46:39] son of man
[46:54] amen to do the same work that he did
[46:57] back there when he was
[46:59] to the jews
[47:02] amen to reveal the secret of the heart
[47:06] amen to do all those great works
[47:10] and then at the end of everything if we
[47:13] all found it to choose and to bring the
[47:15] change
[47:16] you're meant to prepare the bride for
[47:18] the rapture
[47:21] that's why he was able to give us to get
[47:23] to come down with a shout out
[47:27] with the voice
[47:30] and with the trumpet of god
[47:33] to get us ready for that
[47:36] to get
[47:56] if you read the whole the old testament
[47:58] the old testament
[48:01] you would know that the gentiles didn't
[48:03] have any part in the temple
[48:32] to take you back to that position where
[48:34] that you were before
[48:37] amen so it's about that redemption that
[48:39] we will talk about this morning
[48:42] women of him coming now
[48:45] dying on the cross the
[49:02] so now the prophet says
[49:06] in the message possess
[49:08] possessing the gate the gift of enemy
[49:10] after trial
[49:46] is to buy one more time or to buy
[49:49] whatever you have you had before losing
[49:52] it
[49:53] for the blue scoops
[49:55] it's not buying new stuff stuff
[50:02] and then you have to equip the house
[50:04] with good and new furnitures
[50:09] no redemption is buying something that
[50:11] you had before
[50:15] for one reason or another you lost that
[50:17] thing
[50:19] so you have to buy it again
[50:22] so that's why that's what redemption is
[50:25] so for you to be redeemed
[50:28] even you had to be in god's thought
[50:30] before the big before the foundation of
[50:32] the world
[50:34] because if you never was with god
[50:37] you will never be with
[50:47] well then anything redeemed has to come
[50:50] back to where it we fell from
[51:17] it shows that the real christian is an
[51:19] attribute of god's thinking
[51:26] before there was a world a volcano
[51:29] or a star we need one or an heir
[51:32] or anything else
[52:05] the man of this young boy
[52:07] this young man
[52:09] when he made a boat
[52:12] he made like a toy he was playing with
[52:15] him and he spent all his time making
[52:17] that toy
[52:20] form
[52:21] and then he was his favorite toy
[52:25] to him when he was looking at that toy
[52:28] man that toy was perfect
[52:30] regardless of
[53:12] he went to school
[53:15] so on his way back
[53:18] and then he said that
[53:20] for some reason he decided to go to a
[53:22] pawn shop
[53:26] a man needs to still worth this they
[53:28] sell old stuff like use stuff and sense
[53:33] and when he went there when he went in
[53:35] there
[53:36] he meant for and then he saw his his
[53:39] little toe
[53:41] so he went to the person who was selling
[53:43] he said that that's mine so i need to
[53:45] have it
[53:47] personal
[53:50] that little toy belongs to me
[53:53] look i even have scars that you know
[53:55] when i was making it i got hurt and i
[53:57] got there
[54:00] so i need to have this toy box
[54:04] so the seller looked at him and he said
[54:06] little boy
[54:19] so in order for this toy to become yours
[54:22] again
[54:36] how much do you sell it
[54:38] well it's 30 cent you might say
[54:41] 10 cents he said well he looked at his
[54:44] in his pocket and he had a little you
[54:46] had some money
[54:48] and when he started counting that money
[54:50] was 29 cents
[54:54] and you could and you couldn't and you
[54:55] couldn't buy it
[54:57] they said well man i only have 29 how
[55:00] can i do what can i do
[55:03] he says well it's 30 if you don't pay
[55:05] the entire foo if you don't pay the full
[55:07] price you're not getting the total
[55:10] paypal
[55:12] amen well he said what he thought he was
[55:13] like well i have some money back at home
[55:16] so let me run really back and then i'll
[55:18] come back
[55:47] mine at the adventure my partner now you
[55:49] mine again but don't you my party when
[55:51] you once was mine dude to my bathroom
[55:54] yeah man you once were mine i went to my
[55:56] bathroom but i lost you
[55:58] so now you mine again i mean
[56:00] women
[56:03] amen we once belonged to god knows about
[56:06] the new advantage amen we were in god's
[56:08] mind
[56:09] remember coming down here on earth
[56:13] amen we sold ourselves to the devil
[56:17] and we sold ourselves to the devil
[56:20] so in other words we got lost
[56:24] so god for god to come and to take us
[56:27] back
[56:42] for our redemption
[56:51] [Music]
[56:56] um
[57:09] because that price that was fixed
[57:13] the price that you had to pay the price
[57:16] no one else on earth could pay their
[57:17] price person should i tell them
[57:19] there is no money that could have paid
[57:21] that price
[57:24] there is no other bloods that could have
[57:26] paid their price
[57:29] only the blood of christ
[57:33] the blood of animals couldn't pay their
[57:35] price the sun is animal puppies remember
[57:38] it was only the blood of christ
[57:41] the three so that's why he had to become
[57:43] a son what i'm going to visit with you
[57:45] amen to die on the cross
[57:47] amen to suffer there's all man suffering
[57:51] demand to be tempted and to be tried
[58:20] his master will sell him or or will put
[58:23] him on to death
[58:26] unless someone comes and buys him
[58:31] unless someone comes and redeems him
[58:39] amen we sold ourselves to the devil
[58:43] and in other words we became slaves
[58:47] the bible says
[59:02] this
[59:05] it was to give a life had to die
[59:10] someone had to die
[59:12] amen that's what justification means
[59:14] since christians feel like justification
[59:16] so jesus oh jesus woman he took our
[59:19] place
[59:21] he took our sentence
[59:24] for us
[59:25] he died on the cross for us
[59:28] so that we can be saved
[59:57] his blood couldn't pay for us for
[59:59] redemption
[1:00:02] he didn't have the he didn't have what
[1:00:04] he took what he took for our redemption
[1:00:08] and the prophet said that satan will be
[1:00:10] taken from the earth the prophetic
[1:00:26] get a born again christians
[1:00:31] for god from the foundation of the world
[1:00:35] foresaw him and sent jesus to redeem him
[1:00:54] the only thing he hears is your voice
[1:00:59] he sees your representation
[1:01:02] that is true
[1:01:04] right amen how can you sin come on
[1:01:07] even when that sin cannot be seen
[1:01:31] when she came to the prophet
[1:01:34] the prophet looked at her and said that
[1:01:36] i can't see anything wrong with you
[1:01:40] i can't see any sin in you
[1:01:43] well i'm pretty sure she wondered but
[1:01:45] why but well i did this yesterday and i
[1:01:47] did this the day before that jesus
[1:02:32] forget
[1:02:34] capacity we don't have that ability to
[1:02:36] erase the past of someone
[1:02:40] else
[1:02:46] when we
[1:03:00] there is nothing that can condemn us
[1:03:03] amen there is nothing that can stand
[1:03:04] against us
[1:03:06] the devil can come to god and say well
[1:03:08] this is what he did yesterday
[1:03:13] god will look in and say well i don't
[1:03:56] before a man could redeem his lost
[1:03:58] property
[1:04:03] i mean he had to be only the the nearest
[1:04:06] kinsmen who were supposed to to to
[1:04:08] redeem the the their property
[1:04:25] every word
[1:04:28] and that product that
[1:04:30] that person who uh uh uh giving the
[1:04:32] money will become his master
[1:04:34] person
[1:04:37] and that person in other terms will
[1:04:39] become a slave
[1:04:40] person
[1:04:42] because he had to serve until his money
[1:04:45] is is is paid for
[1:04:49] or if if the other case for for him to
[1:04:53] uh to get out of that debt
[1:04:57] it meant someone closer to him had to
[1:04:59] come and pay the price for him
[1:05:02] even a kids man had to come and pay the
[1:05:05] price
[1:05:18] that was required
[1:05:42] amen so that's exactly what jesus did
[1:05:44] for us exactly
[1:05:46] and then he became our nearest kinsmen
[1:06:43] that was required for our redemption
[1:06:58] everything yeah i found it too true i
[1:07:00] mean he made a public testimony
[1:07:04] there on the cross
[1:07:07] he was seen by everybody
[1:07:09] he was there
[1:07:12] even even the sun is creatures
[1:07:15] amen it was ashamed to give its light
[1:07:18] the moon and the stars
[1:07:22] to see the creator being naked
[1:07:26] emma
[1:07:54] that he had to go through
[1:07:58] to save you
[1:08:00] amen amen amen he had to become a sinner
[1:08:04] so that you can become a son of god book
[1:08:06] of the vineyard
[1:08:08] a man he had to change
[1:08:09] he was a change of place
[1:08:13] amen i was a sinner
[1:08:15] amen i was born in sin
[1:08:18] amen came to earth by iniquity and and
[1:08:22] telling lies about this on demonstration
[1:08:27] it meant by god made you even he had to
[1:08:29] take my place
[1:08:31] amen become sin
[1:08:34] amen to take my place poop onto my
[1:08:36] planet
[1:08:50] women
[1:09:03] everything that he did was healing sick
[1:09:05] people just let me face it again
[1:09:08] everything that he did was giving sight
[1:09:10] to a blind man
[1:09:12] everything that he did was multiplying
[1:09:14] bread and fish
[1:09:16] but there is nowhere in the bible
[1:09:28] he didn't consider himself as as
[1:09:31] he didn't consider himself as a hype in
[1:09:33] the higher place
[1:09:37] that's why he took the lowest deaths
[1:09:41] he became the lower man
[1:09:43] woman to die on the cross
[1:09:46] next to the next two tips
[1:09:52] to sinners
[1:09:54] even him who didn't do anything
[1:09:57] remember i had to go through such a pain
[1:09:59] made a bit higher
[1:10:28] it doesn't tell you to do anything hard
[1:10:31] if the one part the fact is
[1:10:33] it doesn't tell you to do anything real
[1:10:35] hard
[1:10:36] it doesn't require you to do anything
[1:10:38] hard it was exist the only thing it
[1:10:40] requires from you like social skills
[1:11:09] is
[1:12:48] angel
[1:13:02] become the lamp
[1:13:08] amen he didn't he didn't make no he
[1:13:10] didn't he didn't refuse
[1:13:12] to refuse to he didn't run from it
[1:13:15] but he said lord
[1:13:36] is only looking at the blood
[1:13:39] he's only looking at the blood
[1:13:42] hey man you have to applaud that blood
[1:13:58] that's why
[1:14:12] he wanted
[1:14:40] the blood of christ of the christ amen
[1:14:43] is the blood of christ himself to do
[1:14:44] something
[1:14:45] amen jesus could have saved himself from
[1:14:47] the cross jesus
[1:14:50] when he had all the abilities to save
[1:14:52] himself on the cross
[1:14:54] amen
[1:15:09] michael to come to his rescue for him
[1:15:11] michael amen he had the ability to do
[1:15:13] all those things
[1:15:16] but he had to come down himself
[1:15:19] and he had to go through it
[1:15:22] to save you
[1:15:50] when god created adam oscars could drive
[1:15:52] a creature and god was looking for the
[1:15:54] masterpiece
[1:15:57] but when adam sinned
[1:15:59] i don't have a picture even god couldn't
[1:16:00] stop by him all alone
[1:16:04] was still looking for that masturbation
[1:16:06] continuation
[1:16:11] amen joseph came joseph
[1:16:15] who was the perfect type of christ
[1:16:18] remember he
[1:16:46] himself in the flesh you'll remember god
[1:16:48] himself in the human flesh remember
[1:16:51] he couldn't stop by him alone
[1:16:54] and he wanted more liberties on the
[1:16:56] priesthood he wanted to multiply those
[1:16:58] masterpieces
[1:17:00] he
[1:18:10] to come
[1:18:25] gave you the free moral agency
[1:18:27] meant to be able to decide what kappa
[1:18:30] meant to be able to make your own
[1:18:32] choices
[1:18:34] because god doesn't make mistakes
[1:18:37] god doesn't want to raise up the people
[1:18:39] from sodom and gomorrh
[1:18:44] because i killed you all
[1:18:48] because
[1:18:49] i made a choice for one of my sons
[1:18:52] god
[1:19:22] women even though when you do but when
[1:19:24] you make bad choices
[1:19:33] a way to bring you back wine women
[1:19:35] because when he was praying to when he
[1:19:38] was praying
[1:19:39] in john chapter 17
[1:19:42] he said father you have given me these
[1:19:44] people depend on this woman and i have
[1:19:46] lost none of them
[1:20:16] that's what it
[1:20:30] the holy spirit can come to sentence
[1:20:33] that's what the son has today i had to
[1:20:35] die
[1:20:36] to send down the holy spirit
[1:20:41] to be a personal instructor
[1:20:57] until you are filled with the holy
[1:20:58] spirit
[1:21:01] then you will be my weakness
[1:21:04] then you'll be able to tell what you
[1:21:06] have experienced
[1:21:09] then you'll be able to tell and
[1:21:10] experience
[1:21:54] of god
[1:22:17] amen amen
[1:22:18] for some reason i'm saying but
[1:22:20] everything everything that i had in my
[1:22:22] notes is now what i'm preaching
[1:22:26] amen i'm just going with what god is
[1:22:29] telling me to do
[1:22:32] amen i'll read the prophet
[1:22:36] when he said that what did he redeem
[1:22:40] he said that he redeemed your soul from
[1:22:42] hell
[1:22:46] amen amen he redeemed and brought back
[1:22:48] everything that adam lost is
[1:23:02] amen jesus christ on calvary was your
[1:23:05] kinsman redeemer that redeemed you from
[1:23:07] every curse of the devil jesus
[1:23:18] he
[1:23:33] amen that's that that that's what the
[1:23:36] redemption brought to you
[1:23:39] brought you peace
[1:23:41] long suffering
[1:23:44] goodness gentleness
[1:23:52] [Music]
[1:23:55] all these things jesus brought to you
[1:23:59] because he was our kinsmen redeemer
[1:24:03] he came to the earth
[1:24:05] he suffered as a man
[1:24:09] he was it
[1:24:10] was he was tempted in all matters like
[1:24:13] we are
[1:24:28] in his body
[1:24:30] borah infirmities in in his body to take
[1:24:33] it away
[1:24:38] and came down to become king folks
[1:24:42] so
[1:24:50] amen let's go to isaiah i'm pretty sure
[1:24:52] it's 60 uh one
[1:24:55] i'm not going to
[1:24:56] question
[1:24:58] if i can remember well
[1:25:22] um
[1:25:23] some reason i can't find it
[1:25:28] amen let's go isaiah isaiah 59.
[1:25:33] amen the verse one two three
[1:25:35] underscores
[1:25:43] amen he became
[1:25:44] a man is it this is numb he meant to
[1:25:48] save us
[1:25:50] and when he became a man it was
[1:25:52] to save
[1:26:01] behold the lord's hand
[1:26:03] is not short and shortened
[1:26:06] that it cannot save neither is ear heavy
[1:26:10] that you cannot hear no la mendo le
[1:26:13] termene
[1:26:18] but your iniquities have separated
[1:26:21] between you and your god and your sins
[1:26:23] have
[1:26:25] hid his face from you that he will not
[1:26:28] here
[1:26:37] for your hands are defiled with blood
[1:26:39] and your fingers with iniquity your lips
[1:26:42] have spoken lies your tongue has
[1:26:45] muttered uh
[1:26:47] purify
[1:26:56] amen the lord the lord's hand is not
[1:26:59] short to save
[1:27:15] amen that's why
[1:27:16] your prayers sometimes can be hurt
[1:27:22] you see that's why sometimes you pray
[1:27:24] and it feels like there's nothing going
[1:27:25] on
[1:27:29] amen because there is a wall of
[1:27:30] iniquities
[1:27:33] that is built between you and god
[1:27:38] amen there is only one way to break that
[1:27:40] wall
[1:27:43] a man is to repent
[1:27:46] amen there is only one way to break that
[1:27:48] wall
[1:27:51] emma needs to repent
