[0:00] going to ask you that uh that you would
[0:02] turn with us to
[0:05] Joshua we're going to be coming from the
[0:07] third
[0:08] chapter we read Joshua all the way up to
[0:11] the fourth chapter we trust that you'll
[0:14] be blessed by by the gra of God still
[0:17] working with the Statue of a perfect man
[0:20] uh and those things that are pertaining
[0:22] to it I just want to bring out a few
[0:24] things in the scripture that uh I I know
[0:28] I mentioned it before some time ago but
[0:30] maybe you don't recall but nevertheless
[0:33] I trust that God will anoint the word
[0:35] tonight and just do something special
[0:37] for us I I I would uh would to
[0:42] see uh those of us really who have been
[0:45] really pressing into more of
[0:48] God uh if you haven't been I I want to
[0:51] say shame on you uh because the word of
[0:53] God has been coming and the grace of God
[0:56] has been working with us uh
[1:00] uh abundantly because a lot of us amen
[1:04] uh didn't know some of these things and
[1:07] maybe you did know it but it's just the
[1:09] right season right now so I I want to
[1:12] say this I don't care if it's just a
[1:14] little press a little something you
[1:17] should be giving uh God something every
[1:20] day asking the Lord to help you on a
[1:23] daily basis uh you know what you need to
[1:26] be delivered from you know your enemy
[1:28] and you know the one that you've got to
[1:30] die with uh so by the grace of God I
[1:33] trust that you know we Are Spiritual
[1:35] enough to know that this is the last go
[1:38] round there's not another church age and
[1:41] uh I want to say this by the grace of
[1:43] God so that you could plainly understand
[1:46] there is no neutral ground you either
[1:49] save or you're lost there is no no
[1:52] neutral ground and you know God has
[1:55] given us all of us an opportunity to be
[1:59] on the right side
[2:01] amen you love the Lord amen uh Joshua
[2:05] we're going to start at the third
[2:07] chapter uh we'll begin at the third
[2:11] verse and they commanded the people
[2:13] saying when you see the Ark of the
[2:15] Covenant of the Lord your God and the
[2:17] priests and the Levites bearing it then
[2:19] you shall remove from your place and go
[2:21] after it yet there shall be a space
[2:24] between you and it about 2,000 cubits by
[2:28] measure come not near unto it that you
[2:30] may know the way by which you must go
[2:33] for ye have not passed this way here to
[2:36] for so it took about 2,000 years for
[2:40] this Ark to be spaced between the people
[2:42] and God uh God God and his people ever
[2:46] since the day of Pentecost amen and so
[2:49] now we realize by the grace of God it's
[2:51] almost time for this Ark to return to
[2:54] the Jews and understand they will find
[2:56] the ark just the same way we did amen by
[3:00] the way of a Prophet by the grace of God
[3:02] 2,000 years so it shows us exactly where
[3:04] we are right now amen that uh God has uh
[3:10] took 2,000 years to bring it back to us
[3:12] and uh he's he's basically uh coming and
[3:16] and now we see where we are but look
[3:18] what he's telling the Jews he said you
[3:20] have not passed this way hitherto for
[3:23] this is a different way it's not law but
[3:25] it's Grace and Joshua said unto the
[3:27] people sanctify yourselves for for
[3:29] tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among
[3:32] you and Joshua spake unto the pr priests
[3:35] saying take up the ark of the covenant
[3:37] passed over before the people and they
[3:39] took up the Ark of the Covenant and went
[3:41] before the
[3:42] people and the Lord said unto Joshua now
[3:45] we're working with the spirit Joshua now
[3:47] okay this day will I began to magnify
[3:50] thee in the sight of all Israel that you
[3:52] may know that as I was with Moses so I
[3:57] will be with thee and so the prophet of
[4:00] God came in our last day and preached
[4:02] that message so that we can see that
[4:04] these scriptures that are pertaining to
[4:06] Israel is now pertaining to us and as
[4:09] God was with Moses he is with us because
[4:11] we are underneath the anointing of
[4:14] Joshua who is Jesus Christ himself and
[4:17] the Lord said unto Joshua this day will
[4:19] I begin to magnify thee in the sight of
[4:21] all of Israel that you may know that as
[4:23] I was with Moses so I will be with thee
[4:27] and thou shall command the priest that
[4:28] bear the Ark of the Covenant saying we
[4:30] come to the brink of the Waters of
[4:32] Jordan you should stand still in Jordan
[4:37] amen because Jordan amen is also a sign
[4:39] of death so you come into the Jordan you
[4:42] stand still is that all right and Joshua
[4:46] said unto his children of Israel come
[4:48] hither and hear the words of the Lord
[4:50] your God and Joshua said hereby ye shall
[4:53] know that the Living God is among you
[4:55] now here Joshua said to God said to
[4:58] Joshua Joshua is now taken to the people
[5:00] and that he will without fail drive out
[5:04] from before you the Canaanites now see
[5:07] if God did it for them he'll do it for
[5:09] you sir he said under the Joshua
[5:12] Ministry every inhabitant of your land
[5:14] will be driven out amen right amen
[5:17] driven dri drive out from before you the
[5:20] Canaanites the Hittites the hivites the
[5:24] perizzites the girgashites the amorites
[5:27] and the jebusites you know we had a
[5:29] message on this years ago I I I can't
[5:32] find my notes but uh each one of these
[5:35] uh uh tribal uh people actually
[5:38] represents a work of the Flesh and um
[5:41] and hindrances so you got to understand
[5:45] that God is working with the same thing
[5:48] there was in the natural here is in the
[5:50] spiritual amen behold the Ark of the
[5:51] Covenant of the Lord of all of Earth
[5:53] passes over before you into Jordan now
[5:56] therefore take you 12 men out of the
[5:58] tribe of Israel out of of every tribe of
[6:01] man so that's why Jesus Christ himself
[6:03] Joshua had to take 12 because in the Old
[6:07] Testament he had told them taken told
[6:10] them to take 12 and so he himself took
[6:12] 12 Apostles right that's the scripture
[6:16] is that right Ephesians 2:20 and built
[6:19] upon the foundation of the Apostles and
[6:21] Prophet Jesus Christ being the chief
[6:23] Corner Stone and Joshua said unto the
[6:25] children of Israel come hither because
[6:27] you got to understand these 12 Le Le us
[6:30] amen came
[6:31] through right they came through and
[6:34] because they came through on the day of
[6:35] Pentecost we can come through they stand
[6:38] as a memorial amen as those stood Stones
[6:42] stood as a memorial for Israel amen uh
[6:45] those 12 Apostles stand as a memorial to
[6:48] us is that all right amen amen sure
[6:51] enough and now for take 12 men out of
[6:53] the tribe of Israel out of every tribe
[6:55] of man and it shall come to pass as soon
[6:57] as the soul of the feet of the tri
[6:59] priest
[7:00] that bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord
[7:01] of all of the Earth shall rest in the
[7:04] waters of Jordan that the Waters of
[7:06] Jordan shall be cut off from the waters
[7:08] that come down from above and they shall
[7:10] stand upon a heap and you got to
[7:12] understand that their time of crossing
[7:14] over was not when the Waters of Jordan
[7:16] was low but the Bible tell us it was at
[7:19] his highest ple amen so this was a
[7:22] difficult time to cross over and that's
[7:24] what God makes it so so you can realize
[7:27] it's not you by power not by might might
[7:29] but by my spirit sayeth the Lord and it
[7:32] shall come to pass when the people
[7:33] removed from their tents to pass over
[7:35] Jordan the priest bearing the Ark of the
[7:37] Covenant before the people and as they
[7:39] bear the ark uh where were come unto
[7:42] Jordan and the feet of the priest that
[7:44] bear the ark were dipped into the brim
[7:46] of the water for Jordan overflowed all
[7:48] his Banks all the time all the time of
[7:51] harvest that the waters which came down
[7:53] from above stood and Rose up in a heat
[7:55] very far from the city Adam that is
[7:58] besides zaratan and those that came down
[8:01] toward the Sea of the plain even salt
[8:04] sea failed and were cut off and the
[8:06] people passed over right against Jericho
[8:09] so you got to realize by the grace of
[8:10] God that what God was doing he was
[8:13] basically pushed positionally the
[8:16] positionally placing amen the children
[8:19] of
[8:20] Israel and uh so let's just have a word
[8:23] of prayer right now and I'll let you be
[8:24] seated Heavenly Father God we come
[8:26] before you Lord we thank you for your
[8:28] grace and your mercy we thank you for
[8:30] being so good to us and we pray father
[8:33] that you be merciful to us father give
[8:35] us these things that we stand in need of
[8:38] and Lord we cry out every day Lord all
[8:41] during the day Lord for more of you
[8:45] father we realize we can't add a cubba
[8:47] to our statue but we know the man who
[8:49] can hallelujah oh we know the Creator
[8:52] and the make of all things father you
[8:56] are my father and Lord you are the
[8:59] master of all winds principalities and
[9:02] Powers I pray here tonight that you
[9:04] would just bless each and every heart in
[9:06] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[9:10] you may be seated amen just remember uh
[9:12] brother uh uh Fields will be coming in
[9:15] tomorrow we will be having service on
[9:17] tomorrow night Friday Saturday and
[9:19] Sunday early I mean Friday excuse me
[9:22] Thursday Friday and Saturday early
[9:24] Saturday by the grace of
[9:27] God hallelujah so they took 12 men out
[9:30] of the people out of every tribe of man
[9:33] and those men had to go and pick up a
[9:35] stone from the bottom of the Jordan and
[9:39] they had to take those stones and build
[9:41] a heat so that when the children of
[9:43] Israel would see that it would be as a
[9:46] memorial remember amen he says remember
[9:50] remember and he even comes along when he
[9:52] dealt with his disciples he said always
[9:54] remember remember amen so listen I want
[9:58] you to understand that even when it
[10:00] comes to the communion amen of the
[10:02] saints of God you've heard me say this
[10:04] but if Jesus Christ can wash the bride's
[10:08] feet because that's what he did with
[10:10] Peter he stooped and he served his wife
[10:14] so therefore that's why brother brandham
[10:16] could truly say that eternal life is
[10:18] living for others if we're not living
[10:21] for others then we might we check our uh
[10:25] uh uh experience to see whether it's
[10:28] real or not
[10:30] amen so we're not going to be long
[10:31] tonight because like I said this is
[10:33] going to take forever trying to get
[10:35] finished because the more I see the more
[10:38] seem to
[10:39] unveil so we want to uh say by the grace
[10:42] of God that here by the the priest or I
[10:46] could put it this way is that those 12
[10:47] disciples opened the way for us amen by
[10:50] the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen
[10:53] and that's why Paul was able to able to
[10:56] say you know except a man believe the
[10:58] gospel in which I preach let him be a
[11:00] curse see Paul told us as I said
[11:02] according to SEC first SEC uh second
[11:05] Peter 1 Chapter Paul talks about that
[11:07] interest being made and and I broke it
[11:10] down and said to you how throughout the
[11:12] church ages we built from Ephesus all
[11:14] the way up and so that entrance into the
[11:17] holies of holies could not have come in
[11:18] no other day outside of our day amen
[11:21] that's why it took a prophet Amen to
[11:23] come down and he was not just a prophet
[11:26] but he was a priest he also was a king
[11:31] is that right amen because God has made
[11:33] us priest and King is that right so you
[11:36] and I must understand amen that that
[11:39] brother even though brother Bram had to
[11:41] come along and tie up all the loose ends
[11:43] you got to understand that there were
[11:44] times amen he was Moses there were times
[11:47] he stood as Jesus there was times he
[11:49] stood as Joshua there's times amen he
[11:51] stood as David there are times that God
[11:53] was using his ministry Amen in so many
[11:57] ways amen because because he was a son
[12:00] of man revealing the son of man so what
[12:02] God was doing if you know anything about
[12:04] a play you know or or or story right
[12:07] they give you the uh uh the they first
[12:10] tell you in the first paragraph
[12:12] everything that's going to happen they
[12:13] build a body and at the end of the uh
[12:16] page or the or the or the or the uh work
[12:19] uh then they then they uh how could I
[12:22] said they recapture everything else it
[12:25] becomes um uh uh the the very Crooks of
[12:28] everything they recaptures everything
[12:30] else and then they bring it to the
[12:31] complete head and that's what the Lord
[12:33] did through uh the prophet of God he
[12:36] recaptured a lot of great events that
[12:38] took place I mean there was a time that
[12:40] he stood there and it was no no it was
[12:43] absolutely mzad de standing in human
[12:47] flesh amen because he literally turned
[12:49] his back Amen to the audience and he
[12:51] began to call out amen people's names
[12:54] their disease he discerned their hearts
[12:56] that was not William Brandon that was
[12:58] mckz standing there Amen in his flesh
[13:03] now I want you to understand that when
[13:04] you get the completion of God you get
[13:07] MDC you get Lord Jesus you get the word
[13:11] you get the complete full godhead of God
[13:14] inside of you amen and that's why the
[13:16] devil don't want us to uh come to that
[13:20] place but brother Bram even preached a
[13:22] message great is he that is in you and
[13:24] he took it out of First John 4:4 because
[13:27] the Bible tells us greater is he that is
[13:28] in in you than he that is in the world
[13:31] because if you recognize the man of God
[13:33] or The God that's in you you'll
[13:35] understand that he's omnipotent amen he
[13:38] is the uh potentate he is the head of
[13:41] all things and to be honest with you
[13:44] he's the only true Living God everything
[13:48] else is an illusion or some fake thing
[13:51] that Satan himself have set up now
[13:56] understand that when we we see what God
[13:59] was doing with the children of Israel
[14:02] they weren not just going over there to
[14:04] defeat Jericho but they were going to
[14:06] defeat every inhabitant of the land and
[14:09] only a few of them that really conquered
[14:13] everything now God told them he said now
[14:16] if you don't conquer them down the road
[14:18] they will become a thorn in your flesh
[14:21] and that's what has happened to most of
[14:23] us who are Christians we started out
[14:26] right we conquered almost everything in
[14:29] the land except those pet
[14:32] sins right those sins and those sins
[14:36] have come right back to torment
[14:39] us but God has given us a second chance
[14:43] amen where we can come back and says no
[14:46] you must die even as Samson said I must
[14:50] die with my enemy is that all
[14:53] right so you and I as the the men of God
[14:57] I was listening to uh the Oneness of God
[15:00] a unity in the church and brother brand
[15:02] tells us that we must fight the devil
[15:05] down I like I like the way he said that
[15:08] fight the devil down I mean just don't
[15:10] punch him but bring him down you know
[15:13] and so he kept saying that you got to
[15:15] fight him down because if you recognize
[15:18] that God is in you he first when he
[15:22] tells you that God is not he's already
[15:25] exalted himself above the word so your
[15:28] faith
[15:29] must come up there grab him and put him
[15:32] down where he belongs down under your
[15:36] feet is that right amen let us turn him
[15:39] to Ephesians 3 because I want you to
[15:42] understand the battle is not yours but
[15:45] is the Lord but you must surrender to
[15:48] him he's not going to fight for you if
[15:51] you don't surrender you to him is that
[15:53] all right you must surrender to him and
[15:56] Trust his word that that's the way it
[16:00] goes it's a
[16:04] battle I don't know about you but I got
[16:07] I've been getting victories in my life
[16:09] every day amen got a great big victory
[16:12] today I really had a wonderful time me
[16:13] and the Lord and and I just want to say
[16:16] by the grace of God you know it becomes
[16:18] clear and plain that if you trust this
[16:21] word you'll come out
[16:24] Victorious as the word of God said we
[16:26] don't have a thought coming is what the
[16:28] word word of God says I I was just
[16:31] telling a brother that the other day I
[16:32] said we always call it the voice of God
[16:35] until we want some to see it made
[16:37] different then it comes brother bram's
[16:43] voice yeah Ephesians the 3 chapter for
[16:47] this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus
[16:50] Christ for you Gentiles if you have
[16:52] heard of the dispensation of the grace
[16:55] of God which is given to me toward you
[16:58] how that by Revelation he made known
[17:01] unto me the mystery as I wrote a four in
[17:03] new few words whereby when we read you
[17:06] may understand by knowledge in the
[17:08] mystery of Christ I would ask anybody
[17:11] tonight what
[17:12] is uh the Seal of God in your
[17:17] forehead you know a lot of us you know
[17:19] think that there's something up
[17:22] here you know what brother R said it's
[17:24] not in your forehead he says it's in
[17:27] your heart under standing you got the
[17:33] seal see in your mind you know that you
[17:36] got it he said that's where it is the
[17:39] Seal of God is in your heart he said he
[17:41] said why God say he because it's your
[17:44] understanding that you got it
[17:51] hallelu whereby when you read you may
[17:55] understand by knowledge in the mystery
[17:57] of Christ which in other Ages was not
[18:00] made Unto the Sons of men as it is now
[18:02] revealed unto you his Holy Apostles and
[18:05] Prophets by the spirit so you haven't
[18:07] gone this way before amen see this is
[18:10] what he's writing here he says listen
[18:12] Israel you haven't gone come this way
[18:14] feans you haven't come this this is
[18:16] something that excuse me been revealed
[18:19] it is what I'm laying out to you and if
[18:21] you follow this you'll make
[18:25] it he says listen that the Gentiles
[18:28] should be f Hees and of the same body
[18:31] and the and the uh partakers of his
[18:33] promise in Christ by the gospel because
[18:36] remember the Ark of the Covenant was
[18:38] nothing but God himself amen right I
[18:41] mean come on it was God's resting place
[18:43] which was amen your heart that's right
[18:46] symbolically of your heart but the point
[18:49] is is that you couldn't touch it and
[18:53] that's why God said in this last day the
[18:55] work that he would do will never be
[18:57] defiled
[19:04] hello I believe it was Troy or somebody
[19:06] was talking about that the other day
[19:08] somebody either I dreamed it or
[19:09] something but they said it'll never be
[19:11] defiled again why because it'll never be
[19:13] handled by
[19:15] man what you got amen what God is doing
[19:18] you God ain't let no man handle that
[19:20] that's God in you right amen God in you
[19:24] it's a is a personal relationship with
[19:27] you
[19:29] right but you know what you can't love
[19:31] God and and and not and hate hate your
[19:34] brothers right you can't even obey God
[19:38] until you obey one
[19:40] another that's right that's right if you
[19:43] can't serve me and I serve you you're
[19:45] not obeying
[19:49] God that's right and it's the truth you
[19:53] know brother B said that that in one
[19:54] case people say well I Don't Need No Man
[19:56] to teach me he said then you a liar and
[19:58] you're the scripture that's why God said
[20:01] in a five-fold
[20:02] Ministry these are the ones who perfect
[20:06] you these Ministries we're not like
[20:09] Samson or one of those giants that has
[20:11] six fingers we only have
[20:16] five let's move
[20:19] on when another Ages was not made known
[20:21] Unto the Sons of men as it is not
[20:24] revealed unto His Holy Apostles and
[20:25] Prophets by the spirit that the gench
[20:27] child should be fa and of the same body
[20:30] and partaker of his promise in Christ by
[20:32] the gospel wherefore whereof I was made
[20:35] a minister according to the gift of the
[20:36] grace of God given unto me by the
[20:40] effectual working of his power unto me
[20:43] who am less than the least of All Saints
[20:46] is this Grace given that I should preach
[20:48] among the Gentiles The
[20:51] unsearchable Riches of Christ so you
[20:55] can't search it scripture by scripture
[20:58] it is by Revelation that God have to
[21:01] bring these things into your
[21:03] heart and to make all men see what is
[21:07] the Fellowship of the mystery which from
[21:09] the beginning of the world have been hid
[21:13] in God who created All Things by Jesus
[21:17] Christ to the intent that now unto the
[21:20] principalities and the powers Heavenly
[21:23] places might be known by the church to
[21:25] manifold wisdom of God Accord according
[21:28] to the Eternal purpose which he purposed
[21:31] in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have
[21:34] boldness and excess with confidence by
[21:36] the faith of him wherefore I desire that
[21:39] I faint not that ye faint not at my
[21:42] tribulation for you which is your glory
[21:46] now here I'm coming to the last part for
[21:48] this cause I bow my knee unto the father
[21:50] of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the
[21:53] whole family in Heaven and Earth is
[21:54] named that he would Grant you excuse me
[21:57] according to the riches of his glory to
[21:59] be strengthened with might by his Spirit
[22:02] excuse me in the Inner Man Hallelujah
[22:06] here it is that that he might Grant you
[22:10] according to the riches of his glory to
[22:13] be strengthen with might by his spirit
[22:18] in the Inner Man now he's basically
[22:21] bringing a synopsis exactly what Peter
[22:23] said see instead of saying Seven Virtues
[22:27] he's just telling you that the only way
[22:29] the inner man will ever be strengthened
[22:31] with might would be by his spirit so
[22:34] it's not by your your power or your
[22:36] strength the the inner man is what God
[22:39] is concerned with he ain't he ain't
[22:41] concerned about your flesh your flesh is
[22:44] nasty is condemned it will always be
[22:47] that way until you change but he says
[22:49] listen to The Riches of his glory to be
[22:52] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[22:55] the inner man that Christ May dwell in
[22:58] Your Hearts by faith amen what is Faith
[23:03] a revelation he's in there he's dwelling
[23:07] there that ye being rooted and grounded
[23:10] where in love there it is rooted and
[23:14] grounded in love and he ain't talking
[23:16] about filio he ain't talking about filio
[23:19] he's talking about agape love may be
[23:22] able to comprehend with All Saints what
[23:24] is the bread and length and depth and
[23:26] height and to know the love of Christ
[23:29] which passes knowledge that you might be
[23:31] filled with all the fullness of God Amen
[23:34] all the fullness of God now to him that
[23:37] is able to do don't even tell me God
[23:39] ain't
[23:43] able he's working with the statute of a
[23:45] perfect man he's working with Christ
[23:47] being formed in you bringing you into a
[23:50] fullness because he couldn't bring it
[23:52] Peter had to bring it and he's bringing
[23:55] it and breaking it down to you but here
[23:57] the Paul Paul is basically telling you
[24:00] amen that here the family of God Amen
[24:03] will be strengthened now that if he
[24:06] grants it to you you don't earn it
[24:09] that's right he gives it he grants it to
[24:11] you because of who you are you don't
[24:14] believe it Paul said God used me for an
[24:16] example I was a murderer I was a
[24:19] persecutor of the church I I I I made
[24:21] many blaspheming I was the least of them
[24:23] all but God granted me this amen H
[24:27] because of who I was and who I am I am
[24:31] in the family of God because of God's
[24:35] thoughts and his word spoken concerning
[24:38] me before the foundation of the world
[24:42] and this has been a mystery that has
[24:44] always been election
[24:47] amen now to him that is able to do what
[24:51] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[24:54] ask or think according to the power that
[24:57] work in US
[25:02] amen right unto him be glory in the
[25:05] church by Christ Jesus throughout all
[25:09] ages amen World Without
[25:12] End I hope you got it amen amen because
[25:15] here we are it's been a mystery you have
[25:18] been the
[25:20] mystery I'm I'mma tired right back
[25:23] Israel knew the outer Court Israel
[25:25] perhaps seen the inner court but they
[25:27] had never been behind the veil amen only
[25:30] the high priest amen and he and that was
[25:32] a mystery to
[25:35] Israel Amen on what was laying back
[25:38] there and God is coming about and he
[25:40] says now here is the mystery unveiled
[25:42] amen he read the veil into he exposed
[25:47] what was
[25:49] there and who come forth but the Bride
[25:51] of
[25:53] Jesus because we came out of the heart
[25:56] of Goden
[25:59] is that all right thank you Lord now we
[26:01] know by the grace of God you either born
[26:04] again or you're not and and if you're
[26:06] not you you you know you one of the
[26:08] reasons why you you you're getting
[26:10] frustrated all the time is because
[26:12] you're trying to put new wine in Old
[26:13] bottles you can't do that you can't do
[26:17] that you first got to get down and says
[26:18] Lord forgive me I am a sinner cleanse me
[26:22] of my in my heart amen accept me as
[26:26] right see because you can't well I've
[26:28] been baptized no no no no no baptism
[26:31] don't mean no good to you if you haven't
[26:33] repented that's right if you haven't
[26:35] gone to the Cross
[26:37] first cuz baptism is just an outward
[26:39] show of what has already taking place
[26:42] you got to get before the cross and say
[26:44] God I accept you as and there are many
[26:47] Christians who's never done that but yet
[26:48] they've been
[26:51] baptized hello but you got to go before
[26:54] God and you got to meet him at the blood
[26:57] meet him at the cross you got to look up
[27:00] amen and see who's on the on the pole
[27:02] y'all understand what I mean you got to
[27:05] look at your sins know you're wrong ask
[27:09] God to forgive you that's the beginning
[27:11] that's it Hallelujah that's the
[27:13] beginning otherwise you're trying to be
[27:14] a
[27:20] sheep right and with God ain't looking
[27:22] you know for the wolves and sheep
[27:24] clothes and he's not looking for that so
[27:26] God is looking for real sheep amen you
[27:28] know and like I said earlier there is no
[27:32] neutral ground Ephesians 4:30 most of us
[27:36] know that well said brother do I have
[27:38] the Holy Ghost I believe many of us do
[27:41] but you know what we still needing
[27:42] virtue we still at the bottom of the
[27:46] thing come on somebody we still at the
[27:48] bottom it ain't nobody's fault with your
[27:50] own cuz the word's been preached
[27:53] am Hallelujah come on somebody and
[27:56] brother brownon when he said that the R
[27:58] should be laying in the presence of the
[27:59] Sun that don't mean you got to be at my

[28:04] presence of the sun wherever you are you

[28:17] wrong you got to know when you're wrong
[28:19] and this Bible is word is a book of
[28:21] correction amen but yet fill with
[28:26] love Ephesians 4 4:30 says and grieve
[28:30] not the holy spirit let me back up let
[28:34] no com let no corrupt communication
[28:36] perceived out of your mouth help us

[28:47] to the use of edifying that it may
[28:50] Minister Grace unto the hear
[28:52] us not the kind of kind of talk that you
[28:55] people don't even want to talk to you
[28:57] but it remember with Grace oh you know
[28:59] he that I love talking with that brother

[29:24] clamor and evil speaking be put away

[30:05] be a witness uh you know what and and
[30:07] and can I can I I wish I was I wish this

[30:11] to say it again sometime
[30:13] soon but you know what uh and I know we
[30:16] all come in tired I'm tired today I've
[30:18] been really busy and uh and stuff but
[30:22] you know
[30:23] nevertheless I I come to give my best my
[30:26] all and I I I'm I'm I'm I know that it
[30:30] ain't going to always be a jumping
[30:31] service but you know it's been a while
[30:33] since we had
[30:36] one and may God have mercy on us sir
[30:41] because we supposed to bring the fire
[30:43] with us and there should not be one or
[30:45] two individuals in here feeling out of
[30:48] place cuz they jumping and nobody else
[30:51] is no one else you know I look at this
[30:54] thing and I says come on folks we got to
[30:56] do something we got Young people they're
[30:59] depending on this anointing if we can't
[31:01] bring the anointing we might as well
[31:03] quit
[31:04] Church hello let me say it again if we
[31:08] don't bring the anointing we might as
[31:10] well quit church because it is the
[31:13] anointing that destroy the yolks these
[31:16] young people that's coming up these
[31:17] little kids amen they need to see God
[31:20] real amen not just law they need to see
[31:23] the supernatural happening among
[31:26] usen they need to and if we're not going
[31:29] to show them how they going to get the
[31:30] Holy Ghost with a dry
[31:32] service you got to have fire
[31:36] amen you got to have fire in here and if
[31:39] we going to have a dry service we might
[31:41] as well go to a denominational church
[31:42] and sit up there because they have it
[31:44] like that all the time but we must be a
[31:47] witness of Malachi
[31:49] 4 honestly those tapes of more spirit
[31:52] filled than most church services
[31:56] Lord and it's a shame
[31:58] it it really is a shame because we we
[32:01] come here like it's a duty it's not
[32:03] listen it proves we're not where we
[32:04] ought to
[32:08] be listen brother R said a lot of time
[32:11] we don't get our healing and deliverance
[32:12] he said a lot of time because of
[32:14] unbelief he said an unbelief would
[32:17] destroy us if it wasn't for the blood of
[32:22] Jesus Christ is that right and he goes
[32:25] on and he types that with Abraham and
[32:26] Sarah he said when Sarah laughed he said
[32:29] God couldn't destroy her because she was
[32:31] a part of Abraham but that unbelief made
[32:34] her laugh unbelief make us do what we do
[32:38] Lord unbelief makes us blind like I said
[32:42] when you are your eyes in my eyes are
[32:44] blind to the spiritual World somewhere
[32:47] the Delila got to us throughout the day
[32:50] amen because is that right when we get
[32:54] blinded to the spiritual things and we
[32:55] come in here and we having church and we
[32:57] we fail to see we come to meet God as a
[33:00] group amen not to hear Brother Brook's
[33:03] lecture as a group we come to hear God
[33:06] that's
[33:08] right and the more you pull on him the
[33:11] more he
[33:14] gives that's what he said brother B said
[33:18] amen and this is there anything too hard
[33:19] for
[33:21] God he says let's look at the holy come
[33:23] Spirit come uh spirit to come in the
[33:26] Supernatural oh let me put it this way
[33:28] let's not look for church haird and new
[33:31] dresses let's look for the Holy Spirit
[33:33] to come in the Supernatural and raise
[33:36] some things the church don't need a fa
[33:39] lift it needs a birth the Holy Ghost to
[33:42] come into the church and bring back and
[33:45] that
[33:46] believes the Supernatural and holds on
[33:49] and wait and waiting for Life coming of
[33:53] the Lord amen excuse me waiting for the
[33:56] coming of the Lord as if it might be any
[33:58] hour living in them
[34:01] conditions living in the condition that
[34:03] he may come any hour here she was in
[34:07] that shape saying now how could that
[34:10] happen in our modern time how could it
[34:12] happen to me in my condition but it
[34:14] happened just the same Abraham out there
[34:17] waiting with anticipation you see it
[34:19] wasn't made known unto her it was made
[34:22] known to them that was looking for it
[34:24] that's the that's the way it comes yet
[34:27] to those those who are looking amen so
[34:30] he was watching see that's the point if
[34:32] you're not looking for virtue you won't
[34:34] get none amen if you're not seeking God
[34:38] Amen for patience and longsuffering
[34:40] brotherly kindness all those you won't
[34:42] get it he's all of that yes and that's
[34:45] what God is looking for listen I don't
[34:47] care like you said well you didn't get
[34:49] it today it doesn't matter if I didn't
[34:51] get it today I get it tomorrow if I
[34:52] don't get it tomorrow it'll come after
[34:54] that but it's coming It Won't Stop until
[34:58] it's complete complete amen cuz the
[35:00] Bible said he that begun the good work
[35:02] in you is faithful to complete it we're
[35:04] talking about dyamics amen
[35:08] Dynamics and you know uh we look at
[35:11] these things and and I I've been I you
[35:15] know I don't know whether anybody else
[35:17] been
[35:18] troubled and when I say
[35:21] troubled uh I don't believe it's a lack
[35:24] of faith on my part or anyone else's uh
[35:27] uh but but I think about my sister Vanda
[35:30] every day almost praying and uh you know
[35:34] if it if it was something that God would
[35:35] reveal I I I would be more than happy I
[35:37] don't know what he's
[35:39] doing but I wonder how many others are
[35:43] concerned y'all hear what I'm saying
[35:45] because and and and I hope my brother
[35:48] don't mind me saying that but you know I
[35:50] put myself in her
[35:52] place and I don't know the kind of pain
[35:54] she's going through but I can see it's
[35:57] it's some sometime
[35:58] unbearable hello amen so you got to
[36:02] understand if so I put myself in her
[36:04] place and that's how I pray God help me
[36:08] if if there's be anything that I'm
[36:10] missing or not seeing or or if this is a
[36:12] test so be it but give me the the
[36:15] Revelation for
[36:19] victory see I mean it it's something and
[36:22] the doctors can't find out what it is
[36:25] but but I'm wondering is God got her
[36:28] there like that to make the church more
[36:31] concerned because I don't think we
[36:35] are I I really don't think we're
[36:38] concerned like God want us to but if you
[36:41] love her with a Godly love you'll be
[36:45] concerned and whether I preach it or not
[36:47] you'll be praying in your closet
[36:49] concerning her
[36:51] matter every day until it happens amen
[36:58] that's what the early church did when
[37:00] Divine love was
[37:03] there we can't just let her sit there
[37:05] and nobody's do nothing like Cas s s
[37:08] whatever will be will be no
[37:10] sir she's one of
[37:12] us and people I pray that God put a
[37:15] burden on the church heart Amen to seek
[37:18] God until that thing break from
[37:20] her whatever it is we know it Ain it's a
[37:23] spirit
[37:28] people love her love her like you love
[37:30] yourself and your own soul seek God you
[37:33] know to God do
[37:34] something that bothers me cuz we're the
[37:37] Church of the Living God where all
[37:39] things are possible
[37:41] amen and no Spirit should sit up in here
[37:45] comfortable
[37:46] none not
[37:51] one I'm seeking God I hope somebody else
[37:53] is in here seeking because that that
[37:56] that could easily be me or it could
[37:58] easily be my
[38:00] wife I am
[38:05] concerned listen he said being a witness
[38:08] we got to prove this thing there must
[38:10] come one that's not only got the
[38:12] mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes
[38:15] that church live move in the power of
[38:18] his resurrection until we come to the
[38:20] place until we find that place and what
[38:23] good does it do to polish the hubs what
[38:26] good does it do to give her a face lift
[38:28] like a simonized job when there's done
[38:30] no Dynamics in it no matter how much the
[38:33] mechanics prove to be right there's got
[38:35] to be a dynamic to make it workall and
[38:38] you know I had a dream or whatever it
[38:40] was and I I tell you about it not to
[38:42] lift myself up but I had a dream in the
[38:44] pill of fire came to me and uh it was it
[38:47] was an awesome dream and I thought Lord
[38:49] did I dream that was it my imagination
[38:51] what was it and then I went when I was
[38:53] at the wedding uh brother Dave Luellen
[38:55] came to me and says brother Brooks he
[38:57] said I got a to tell you about this
[38:58] dream I had of you he said I had dream
[39:00] that the God come down like it was on
[39:02] the when when he came down on Moses and
[39:04] when you walked out the room the glory
[39:05] of God came with you he said I tell you
[39:07] what I've never felt that place that
[39:09] that like that in my life not in a
[39:11] service or anywhere he said and I felt
[39:13] it in that dream I said well brother
[39:16] that was just a
[39:17] witness amen if God can give you a
[39:20] witness of me over there you know
[39:22] because I was wondering I asked God was
[39:23] it a dream was it something I imagined
[39:25] what it was all I know I'm not a Moses
[39:28] but I am just bride amen and I'm going
[39:31] tell you something that same pfy that
[39:33] came down on Moses will come down on us
[39:36] amen is that all right and how would he
[39:39] know I mean here I am preaching on the
[39:41] statute of perfect man and adoption and
[39:43] that God God coming down like it did on
[39:45] Jesus amen and I believe that's the way
[39:48] it's supposed to
[39:50] be and I'm waiting for it and I'm
[39:52] looking for it and it's going to happen
[39:55] yes sir nothing shall hinder God amen I
[39:58] I tell you what I learned a few things
[39:59] about the Lord today he's full of Mercy
[40:02] I can tell you that he's rich in Mercy
[40:05] is that all right amen amen
[40:09] amen
[40:13] hallelujah Hebrews 10:5 says wherefore
[40:17] when he cometh into the world he says
[40:19] sacrifice and offering thou West not but
[40:21] a body has thou prepared for me now
[40:24] listen that listen listen God don't care
[40:27] about your sacrifice nor your offerings
[40:29] God wants your body amen hallelujah
[40:33] that's what he wants he wants that body
[40:35] of yours under complete obedience to him
[40:38] is that all right hello amen listen
[40:42] brother B talks about two classes of
[40:44] people why people are so talked about he
[40:46] said there are two classes of people
[40:47] today them same classes that trying to
[40:50] do something to save themselves each one
[40:52] say I go to church every Sunday that's
[40:55] very good I want to be religious that's
[40:57] that's very good that's still under the
[40:59] law but when the other by going to
[41:02] church and being good is not something
[41:04] that you do yourself is something in you
[41:06] doing it for you the holy spirit in your
[41:11] heart and I brought that just to say
[41:14] when God is in you amen everything is in
[41:17] you Faith virtue knowledge temp all of
[41:19] that is in you and it is God in you
[41:22] doing it yes
[41:27] God in
[41:29] you doing it is that all right he said
[41:32] you men and women live a good life and
[41:34] love God by menal conception but the
[41:36] real hiding place is in your heart hid
[41:40] with Christ and when Christ the Holy
[41:42] Spirit comes into your heart he is in
[41:45] you with your Temperance he's living his
[41:48] own life through his own will through
[41:50] you I know it sounds awful but it's but
[41:54] it's right Christ so yielded you are
[41:56] that Christ speaks the kind of word he
[41:58] speak he thinks the kind of thoughts he
[42:00] thinks he would think through you he
[42:03] does the kind of works he would do
[42:05] through you you are yielded and
[42:08] rested thank you
[42:11] Lord oh my God if we could yield to God
[42:14] like we yield to some of these Devils
[42:15] we'd be all
[42:18] right hello
[42:23] [Music]
[42:25] somebody ain't God good to
[42:28] us that's right we need the Holy Ghost
[42:31] to be a witness there ain't no way you
[42:32] can be a witness without the Holy Ghost
[42:34] he wouldn't even let his disciples
[42:36] preach the the new gospel until they
[42:38] were endured with power he said go ye to
[42:40] Jerusalem and there you'll be a witness
[42:41] of me so the witness is the Holy Ghost
[42:43] how you going to say Jesus Christ is
[42:45] alive and you ain't got it amen hey
[42:47] somebody you got to have God on the
[42:49] inside Amen to know to be a witness he
[42:53] said a witness has to know something a
[42:55] witness has to receive an experience and
[42:58] you cannot be a witness of Christ until
[43:00] the Holy Ghost has baptized you amen
[43:02] Jesus would not permit his disciples to
[43:05] preach the gospel until they received
[43:07] the Holy Ghost yet they have been
[43:09] honored to walk with him three and a
[43:11] half years though they were holy men
[43:13] accepted in his sight but he would not
[43:15] let them go preach until they waited up
[43:18] there and got all the differences out of
[43:20] them and then the Holy Spirit came what
[43:22] the world needs today is that same
[43:24] feeling when the dumbing out come comes
[43:27] dumping out comes it needs a feeling
[43:30] what does the feeling do when it comes
[43:32] in where you will have doubt it brings
[43:34] Faith where you have indifferences it
[43:36] bring love where you have hatred it
[43:38] brings fellowship and then the Church of
[43:40] the Living God someday will be United
[43:43] under that one great head and that will
[43:45] be the head of God God into the unity of
[43:48] the body of
[43:50] Christ will be the governor and the king
[43:53] and the Lord over the entire church
[43:56] under his control then she will be
[43:59] received up under his control under his
[44:03] control it it this Rapture can't even
[44:06] take place until we completely
[44:09] yielded and surrendered under his
[44:12] control not your control not your flesh
[44:16] his
[44:17] control oh I love this part because you
[44:20] know I was thinking I said here they
[44:22] they they tore down the towels of uh uh
[44:26] uh when Towers there you know 911 and
[44:30] and uh now they building this great
[44:32] tower and we we've heard the harbinger
[44:34] and and you know I thought about this I
[44:36] I said you know they've done it every
[44:38] time every time God spank them and triy
[44:41] to give them a warning even in the days
[44:43] of uh when uh uh uh tow of Babel was
[44:48] built Nimrod and all they thought they
[44:50] can outsmart God now the thing about it
[44:53] is the only thing is it's just a mimic
[44:56] of what God is doing
[44:57] God is building a tower
[45:00] right God is building a
[45:04] skyscraper amen he's building a building
[45:06] that's what prophet said he said listen
[45:08] in the Oneness of unity he says today
[45:10] all of the towers they may build all of
[45:14] the rockets that they may find all of
[45:16] the socialism and communism that they
[45:19] may stir up all the ecclesiastic system
[45:21] will fail but in spite of all of it God
[45:24] will have a church United his King under
[45:28] his kingship by the baptism of the Holy
[45:30] Ghost Jesus said so and these signs
[45:33] shall follow them that believe in my
[45:36] name they should cast out Devils speak
[45:38] with tongues if they take up serpents or
[45:40] should drink any deadly thing it will
[45:42] not harm them see it goes all the way
[45:45] back to the same thing they always had
[45:49] or supposed to have is that all
[45:52] right just give me a few more minutes
[45:55] what am I saying if you're not seeing
[45:57] Dynamics in your life you need to see
[45:59] God more every one of us it ain't the
[46:02] preacher that's supposed to pray just
[46:03] lay hand he said if they shall lay hands
[46:05] on the sick they shall recover amen it's
[46:09] not just my responsibility it's the
[46:10] church it's a order give a commandment
[46:13] or order given to the church is that all
[46:15] right amen so you and I are all guilty
[46:31] it's amazing how much the cares of the
[46:34] world can take the Life of Christ
[46:41] out let me read this scripture Galatians
[46:45] 4 but when the fullness of the Gentiles
[46:47] beginning at the fourth verse but when
[46:50] the fullness of the time was come God
[46:52] sent forth a son made of a woman made
[46:54] under the law to redeem them that were
[46:57] under the law that we might receive the
[46:59] adoption of sons and because you are
[47:02] Sons God have sent forth the spirit of
[47:04] his son in your hearts crying ABA father
[47:08] he says because you are Sons that's why
[47:11] you cry ABA father because you are son
[47:14] but it doesn't mean that you are fully
[47:16] adopted the spirit of adoption which is
[47:19] the Holy Ghost in you gave you birth to
[47:21] become an adopted son and brother
[47:24] brandham explained that to us how that
[47:26] God test and tries us amen and we either
[47:30] do well or we don't do bad but the
[47:32] report is given to God on a daily
[47:35] basis God don't wait on you know month
[47:37] by month it'll be too
[47:39] much he works with a daily basis me and
[47:43] reports you to God Amen he says now
[47:46] because you're Sons God have sent forth
[47:47] the spirit of sons in your heart crying
[47:50] Our Father wherefore Thou Art no more a
[47:52] servant but a son and if a son than an
[47:55] heir of God through Christ and
[47:57] understand this now because you are a
[47:59] son and yet not fully adopted it doesn't
[48:02] mean that you can't get from your father
[48:04] what you
[48:05] need that's why you crying ABA father
[48:09] because you know he's the one that will
[48:10] supply your needs amen the only thing
[48:13] between a son and an adopted son is that
[48:16] the son is still learning the adopted
[48:18] son have learn has learn he's learned
[48:21] already and now he has the authority
[48:24] amen that his father had that's right
[48:27] all the authority that his father have
[48:30] he has but while you still Sons he can't
[48:33] give you full Authority until you have
[48:36] passed all your
[48:42] tests but now after that you have known
[48:44] God or rather are known of God how turn
[48:48] ye again to the weak and begly elements
[48:50] where you desire again to be in
[48:52] bondage You observe days and months and
[48:55] times and years I am afraid of you lest
[48:58] I bestow upon you my labor in vain
[49:00] Brethren I beseech you be as I am for I
[49:03] am as ye are ye have not injured me at
[49:06] all ye know how through infirmities of
[49:08] the flesh I preached the gospel unto you
[49:10] at the first and my Temptation which was
[49:13] in the flesh ye uh ye desired not nor
[49:16] rejected but received me as an angel of
[49:18] God even as Christ
[49:20] Jesus it what really gets me because the
[49:24] same Ministry that Paul had
[49:27] William brandham had the same he had to
[49:30] labor to bring people to
[49:33] birth he literally labeled and this is
[49:35] what Paul saiding because when he when
[49:38] the prophet of God came in our day we
[49:40] were under law the law of church
[49:43] ages right the dos and the don'ts that's
[49:46] what Holiness remember he said these are
[49:48] Nazarite people they wouldn't even wear
[49:50] jewelry and the Methodist but it was dos
[49:52] and don'ts it was law it wasn't life it
[49:55] was law and he comes around he says now
[49:58] look at the Methodist children look at
[49:59] the Methodist daughters now they're
[50:02] wearing jewelry shorts and everything
[50:03] else why because it wasn't a lie that's
[50:06] right and so he comes and he labors amen
[50:09] these people were Christians but they
[50:11] were just right there at the confession
[50:13] level so he was trying to bring them to
[50:15] a full birth and he labor with them
[50:19] right and he says listen even there's a
[50:21] time in you know Willam Brandon's life
[50:23] how the people loved him even called him
[50:25] God and all of that stuff you know and
[50:27] my point is here it is he says listen
[50:30] but Jerusalem is from above she's
[50:32] free it is the Bond woman that is in
[50:36] bondage right and you're not a bonds
[50:38] woman sir you are a free woman you're
[50:41] born free amen so therefore you know you
[50:44] are to be free and be a witness of your
[50:47] freedom
[50:49] amen so God listen say add to this and
[50:53] add to this because remember I brought
[50:55] out that quote the last time you can't
[50:56] ask God asks you can
[51:02] ask and he said you have not because you
[51:04] ask not you can ask and if you ask
[51:07] sincerely you'll get it
[51:10] am when brother Brooks I don't even care
[51:14] when as long as it get
[51:18] here my point is I keep asking till I
[51:21] get
[51:22] it till I see Christ completely formed
[51:25] in me I will not give him rest amen
[51:28] that's the scripture say don't give him
[51:30] rest to the glory of God is in Jerusalem
[51:32] and Zion don't give him
[51:38] rest God don't look at the outward
[51:42] appearance he proved that through
[51:44] David's
[51:46] election and how the children
[51:49] were brothers denominational big
[51:53] boys came before the prophet
[51:59] and you know the
[52:01] story how Saul was
[52:06] uh I'm trying to think which is the
[52:09] biggest Saul was
[52:12] anointed with the little what it call
[52:15] the uh is it the little uh
[52:21] vow and and and David was anointed with
[52:24] a a ear
[52:29] in other words the denomination got a
[52:30] little
[52:32] anointed and David got the kind that ran
[52:34] from all his feet and all the way down
[52:36] y'all hear what I'm saying it showed
[52:38] that this Saul was going to disobey God
[52:44] he was he was elected by man you know
[52:46] but when God elects you he anoints you
[52:50] he puts that anointing all over you is
[52:52] that all right so you and I must
[52:55] understand that you know David said uh
[52:57] he anointed my head with oil and my my
[52:59] cup runneth over and that's that's the
[53:01] believer that's that's the believer
[53:03] that's that's the kind of anointing God
[53:05] wants to anoint us
[53:09] with now I'm I'm going to come to this
[53:11] and I'm going to stop with St Luke 12:25
[53:14] and I know I'm just talking my way
[53:16] through it but I really want us to get
[53:18] more serious about these messages that's
[53:21] been preached because I don't believe
[53:23] God going to have me coming around again
[53:25] now he might send somebody else through
[53:27] here that's going to preach it but
[53:29] listen people you got to get this now
[53:31] you can't Daily Bread not not not not
[53:34] bread for tomorrow daily amen and and
[53:37] this is what God is requiring of us and
[53:39] I believe if we work with God in this
[53:41] season as I said last week you know when
[53:44] it came this is got to be the season
[53:47] because amen you know when it came to
[53:49] Sam ballad and TOA look what where we at
[53:52] I mean we got it happening Among Us and
[53:54] almost every Church got one or two
[53:56] something's going on even like it was
[53:59] amen when it comes to
[54:01] uh uh uh believe the sign all that you
[54:05] got to realize there are people now who
[54:07] coming who are in this message who are
[54:09] now coming to say I can't do
[54:15] it they're recognizing who they
[54:18] are and when they do that you know what
[54:20] they
[54:21] saying my name is not on the book
[54:27] see they're saying my name is not on the
[54:29] book and that's what happened to tobah
[54:31] when he thought he was they couldn't
[54:33] find record they couldn't find his name
[54:36] in the lineage so he was basically
[54:38] pushed aside and so when he was pushed
[54:40] aside amen he he
[54:43] became uh nehemiah's enemy Israel enemy
[54:48] once served in the same
[54:50] church but now BEC an enemy because amen
[54:54] they wouldn't accept him but the truth
[54:55] of the man is he did not fully believe
[54:58] because I'm going to tell you something
[55:00] even if his name wasn't in on the
[55:02] lineage if he truly was a Believer he
[55:04] would have stayed anyhow that's right am
[55:07] he would have become a proelite or
[55:08] something he wouldn't have fought
[55:10] against
[55:12] it he wouldn't have fought against
[55:14] it Luke 12:25 and which of you will
[55:19] taking thought can add to his statue one
[55:22] Cuban you know I look at this and I say
[55:25] why did God why did God have doub in
[55:27] Thomas there
[55:30] why because he knew so many
[55:34] people let me put it this way even
[55:36] though Thomas didn't have the Holy Ghost
[55:38] yet he was
[55:39] elected and I'm going to tell you
[55:41] something he might have been doubting
[55:42] but he still never went with the 70
[55:45] that's
[55:46] right Lord y'all hear what I'm saying he
[55:50] didn't have the strength to go with them
[55:52] he might have had problems but he still
[55:55] knew he couldn't go with the 70
[55:58] am it was that election that kept him
[56:02] folks that's what I'm trying to tell you
[56:04] y'all we look at these things and we
[56:05] have all these battles but you got to
[56:07] recognize I'm yet here I'm still here
[56:10] I'm still here
[56:12] amen Lord that's the beauty of it I'm
[56:15] still here no matter what I'm still
[56:22] here like that blind man I might not be
[56:25] able to read on right but I want you to
[56:27] know whose side I'm
[56:28] [Laughter]
[56:30] on that's right I may not understand all
[56:33] the mysteries of the thing but I still
[56:35] want you to know whose side I'm on I was
[56:38] telling a brother that today I said man
[56:40] I said if I have known what I know now
[56:42] way back then I'd have been way up the
[56:45] road but you know what I tried my best
[56:47] to teach it
[56:50] right if you then be be be not able to
[56:53] do that thing which at least why why
[56:56] take you thought for the
[56:59] rest come on if you can't do it why you
[57:03] why you worried about it you got to go
[57:06] to the man who can do it for
[57:08] you right it's like my I love my my
[57:11] grand kids you know especially when they
[57:13] can't open something it might be as
[57:15] small as a little candy rapper cuz they
[57:18] make them tough nowadays and they come
[57:20] and say grandpa can you open this for me
[57:23] they don't just give it to me and walk
[57:24] away they write they're right there till
[57:27] I unwrap that piece of candy and they
[57:30] waiting not for the
[57:32] rapper for the candy and that's how it
[57:35] is with us we can't just ask God to do
[57:38] something for us and just leave him you
[57:40] stay right there till he give it you
[57:43] wait right there until the candy is
[57:45] received amen he can do whatever he want
[57:48] to do with the rapper but bring the
[57:49] candy cuz the kids ain't interested in
[57:51] the rapper they interested in the candy
[57:54] you and I we are interested in the ver
[57:56] Virtues Of God we want his character you
[57:58] ask him for it he's the only one that
[58:00] can supply it and you stay there till
[58:02] you get
[58:06] it now I got to believe the word I got
[58:09] to believe it because brother said if
[58:10] you go there believing you going to get
[58:12] the Holy Ghost even if that's what you
[58:13] need he said you'll get
[58:15] it amen he said because God want to give
[58:18] it to you more than you want
[58:19] it but what it is is that unbelief oh if
[58:23] will it be this time how I don't know
[58:25] how we think it my mind but you know a
[58:28] lot of time you want to pray and the
[58:30] devil say well you done thought all
[58:31] these thoughts all day do you really
[58:32] think he's going to give it to
[58:36] you my point is when did he make it
[58:39] labor when did he make it work for you
[58:41] that's right I thought the Holy Ghost
[58:42] was a
[58:43] gift and I thought it was an unmar gift
[58:47] God ain't giving you the Holy Ghost cuz
[58:48] you screamed to the height of your voice
[58:51] God has G you the Holy Ghost because
[58:52] your faith said amen
[58:56] yeah I mean if you got to screen to the
[58:58] height your boss to to convince your
[59:00] faith inside whatever inside that is
[59:02] that your do it whatever it takes but he
[59:05] operates by faith not by
[59:09] sound am I making
[59:15] sense and he goes on and talk about
[59:18] father knoweth that you have need of all
[59:21] these things working with the worldly
[59:22] good but rather seek ye first seek ye
[59:25] the kingdom of God and all the these
[59:26] things shall be added unto you fear not
[59:30] little flock for it's your father good
[59:33] pleasure to give you the
[59:36] kingdom is that
[59:39] okay I'm not trying to put
[59:42] fear as such in
[59:45] us because even if you fear going to
[59:48] hell that still won't save
[59:54] you it ain't what fear is not what God
[59:57] is looking for he's looking for somebody
[59:59] to love
[1:00:01] him
[1:00:03] right I was talk thinking about this the
[1:00:06] other day I said you know why John laid
[1:00:07] in his bosom John knew where he came
[1:00:10] from and he wanted to go back
[1:00:13] there I came from his bosom I go back to
[1:00:16] his bosom amen he was magnetized to
[1:00:18] where he came from and that's where we
[1:00:21] are we're magnetized to where we come
[1:00:23] from our desire is to go back into the
[1:00:25] book wiom of the Lord Jesus amen you
[1:00:28] love the Lord let's
[1:00:33] stand Hallelujah
[1:00:36] Jes
[1:00:38] Hallelujah
[1:00:40] hey father God we come before you Lord

[1:00:45] for your grace we thank you for your
[1:00:47] mercy God you've been better to us and

[1:00:54] and that you would just move move in in
[1:00:56] the people's hearts father we all have
[1:00:59] come short but we desire more of you
[1:01:02] every day Lord we're asking father that
[1:01:04] you would fill us with more of you Lord
[1:01:07] oh God we want to live we want to be
[1:01:09] completely surrendered oh Lord to all of
[1:01:12] our ways dead to ourselves rotted that
[1:01:15] we might just be a shell for the Living
[1:01:17] God help us right now Lord we can't do
[1:01:20] it on our own and except you drop the
[1:01:22] Revelation in our hearts we will be just
[1:01:25] like the world blind to what your will
[1:01:26] would be father but I pray Lord that you
[1:01:29] would let your grace and mercy be upon
[1:01:31] us according to that abundant grace that
[1:01:34] have been ad ministered to us Lord we
[1:01:36] ask these things in your lovely name
[1:01:38] Jesus Christ we pray amen
