[34:21] struggle and i thank god for
[34:26] his amazing grace is it warm in here is
[34:29] it just me
[34:33] could have cut it down just a little bit
[34:39] they said i'm really roasting up here
[34:41] but i thank god for it i mean hey
[34:43] better than freezing i can deal with
[34:47] that god is good to us amen
[34:50] so we thank god for all of you being
[34:53] here tonight
[34:53] and surely god is good to us
[34:58] as we stand i want us to turn to a
[35:02] couple of scriptures we
[35:03] we wrote we began this
[35:06] message in iowa city last week
[35:10] and so i want to continue it and
[35:14] maybe this coming sunday i'll finish it
[35:16] up or however god will lead me
[35:19] but it's uh it means a lot especially in
[35:21] this last day we're we're in
[35:23] the last days and um you and i must
[35:26] understand that uh to have a revelation
[35:28] of this message and where you're
[35:29] standing now
[35:31] is such an honor such a blessing and
[35:33] knowing that we don't have long
[35:36] we don't that's they have a song that
[35:38] say we don't have long to stay here
[35:40] and we don't we don't have long to stay
[35:42] here so as we stand
[35:44] we're going to ask that you turn with us
[35:45] to ephesians 3
[35:47] and 11. i trust that my wife is looking
[35:50] at
[35:50] uh the service i don't have
[35:55] the youtube anymore so if you have a
[35:57] phone number
[35:58] you can shoot that link to her
[36:01] and uh i think brother sister joanne and
[36:06] whoever else you have there that i
[36:08] normally take care of
[36:10] ephesians 3 and 11.
[36:14] and then we'll go to romans 8
[36:18] 1 and 2.
[36:22] yeah today was really one of those days
[36:24] i woke up this morning
[36:26] feeling quite tired and a lot of little
[36:29] things went on
[36:31] during the day and i made it right
[36:32] before the lord
[36:34] but we got the victory
[36:39] no matter what he tried to do i can
[36:42] truly say that i have
[36:45] the victory in christ jesus
[36:48] he is always a defeated foe and all we
[36:51] have to do is open our mouths
[36:53] and talk to god and it's a done deal
[36:57] so no matter what he tries to do and how
[36:59] he tries to
[37:01] trip us in anything we steal our victors
[37:05] because we are victorious in him
[37:08] so we're going to read ephesians 3
[37:10] beginning at the 11th verse we're going
[37:11] to read the first two verses of that
[37:13] particular scripture there chapter
[37:17] according to the eternal purpose which
[37:19] he purposed in christ
[37:21] jesus our lord in whom
[37:24] we have boldness and access with
[37:27] confidence
[37:28] by the faith of him
[37:36] so we understand you know by the faith
[37:38] of him
[37:40] it's nothing nothing we're doing it's
[37:42] just what we use
[37:44] to gain ground to gain the victory amen
[37:48] his faith romans 8 please
[37:57] we're going to read 1 and 2.
[38:04] there is now no condemnation to them
[38:08] which
[38:09] are in christ jesus who walk not after
[38:13] the flesh but after the spirit and i
[38:15] think sometimes we
[38:16] fail to see there is no condemnation
[38:19] we allow satan bring condemnation but
[38:22] he's a false carrier he
[38:25] he's a liar uh you know because
[38:29] there is there is therefore
[38:32] no condemnation to them which are in
[38:34] christ jesus
[38:36] who walk not after the flesh but after
[38:39] the spirit
[38:40] for the law of the spirit of life
[38:44] in christ jesus hath made me free
[38:47] from the law of sin and death
[38:51] just like sin put death into our blood
[38:55] the holy spirit puts life into our blood
[39:01] let us pray father god we thank you for
[39:03] your grace we thank you for your mercy
[39:07] and lord we uh appreciate everything
[39:10] that you
[39:12] do for us on a daily basis god
[39:15] all i know is that you are all in all
[39:18] and without you
[39:21] we would be nothing but we pray tonight
[39:25] that you would break the bread of life
[39:26] to us
[39:28] give us our daily bread feed us
[39:32] in our spirit and our soul may your word
[39:35] add another cubic to our statue
[39:38] we ask these things in your name jesus
[39:40] christ we pray
[39:42] amen you may be seated
[39:58] if i was to have a sub topic i would say
[40:00] the top post of our soul
[40:03] is in him or is within him
[40:11] hebrews tells us that the anchor of our
[40:14] soul
[40:16] that christ jesus went beyond them
[40:19] and we have anchored our soul in that
[40:24] you know when you anchor something that
[40:26] means it's hooked
[40:28] yeah it's not so easy it can be broken i
[40:30] get
[40:31] you know you're just there forever
[40:34] i want to read this uh quote here
[40:38] coming from christ it's the mystery of
[40:39] god we i'm going to say it every time
[40:42] christ is revealed in his own word 1965
[40:46] he says now the same thing is this
[40:50] if you are a son of god and
[40:53] if i am a son of god or a daughter of
[40:56] god
[40:58] we were in god
[41:01] at the beginning
[41:04] we we forget that sometimes we we look
[41:07] at our frailties and our shortcomings
[41:09] and our
[41:10] thoughts we're looking at the wrong
[41:11] thing we're really looking in the wrong
[41:13] mirror
[41:14] right amen because some mirrors are
[41:18] mirrors of deception everything that
[41:20] reflects doesn't reflect the accuracy of
[41:22] what it is
[41:24] you can go to a a a fair or a circus and
[41:28] they have those strange murals that you
[41:30] can walk in front of and they need to
[41:31] make you thin or fat
[41:33] you know what i mean sometimes it make
[41:35] your head you know it disfigures you
[41:38] but one thing about the word of god the
[41:40] mirror of the word that
[41:41] never disfigures you it literally focus
[41:45] it
[41:45] and bring you into a complete perfect
[41:47] image
[41:49] and so we thank god for the grace of god
[41:51] and why i'm saying this is that
[41:53] the word if we could just rest on it
[41:56] trust it with all of our hearts we we
[41:59] find ourselves tossed to and fro because
[42:02] we allow satan to either make us double
[42:05] minded or
[42:06] you know bring us to a spirit of
[42:08] unbelief and now
[42:09] understand unbelief is sin
[42:12] it's really the only sin and all of the
[42:15] things
[42:16] that we do in life that are contrary to
[42:18] the word is
[42:19] literally based upon the fact that we
[42:21] somewhere somehow
[42:22] disbelieve what god says
[42:27] so it says and when jesus became the
[42:30] fullness of the word
[42:33] then we were in him germ form
[42:38] when he was crucified we was crucified
[42:42] in his body when he arose from the dead
[42:46] we rose with him
[42:50] and now since we have recognized it
[42:53] now we sit together with him in heavenly
[42:57] places
[42:58] in christ jesus
[43:01] see that that's not a
[43:04] mental conception it's not this this got
[43:08] to be heartfelt
[43:10] it is the thing that that will will
[43:12] motivate you on a daily basis
[43:14] when you begin to see that you literally
[43:17] are
[43:17] setting in the heavenly places and you
[43:19] see our faith
[43:21] our our journey is by faith
[43:24] right it's not by sight you don't have
[43:26] to see it you don't have to feel it
[43:29] but as long as you can hold it in within
[43:32] your heart by faith
[43:34] that in itself will bring it to reality
[43:38] hallelujah now he says when when
[43:41] he rose from the dead we rose with him
[43:45] so out with the devil's lies
[43:49] or uh accusation if
[43:52] you be the son of god you see or if
[43:56] you make a rapture well no no no no
[43:58] there is no ifs in the bride
[44:01] in the bride there's a certainty
[44:04] everything is sure
[44:05] everything is certain because he did it
[44:08] all
[44:09] for us everything his his
[44:12] his perfection is our perfection
[44:16] because we're here in him amen is that
[44:18] right
[44:19] and jesus declared that there is no
[44:22] darkness
[44:23] in him so when the devil says you are of
[44:25] the dark side
[44:26] he is a lie right
[44:29] you can't be of the dark side and be in
[44:32] him
[44:34] so when he rose from there we rose with
[44:36] him and now since we have
[44:38] recognized it i trust we have now we
[44:41] sit together with him in heavenly places
[44:44] in christ jesus
[44:45] seeing for if we are sons and daughters
[44:49] of god
[44:50] we are god's children then we are
[44:53] attributes of god wait a minute
[44:57] because see attributes that that's a
[44:59] powerful word
[45:01] you see what i'm saying you know if you
[45:04] see somebody with the attributes of a
[45:06] dog
[45:07] you immediately say well he ain't
[45:08] nothing but a dog
[45:12] because his attributes is what's
[45:14] displaying
[45:16] what he is you know just like jesus said
[45:19] go tell
[45:19] uh uh herod that fox go tell that fox
[45:22] you know
[45:23] why because herod was sneaky and cunning
[45:27] right and so jesus called him a fox he
[45:30] was a man but he had a fox spirit
[45:34] so attributes when when people say oh
[45:37] that guy is holy that that man is
[45:39] sanctified that
[45:40] that man is a real christian it the
[45:42] reason why
[45:44] those uh uh uh judgments are
[45:47] uh it's sad about you it's because
[45:50] they've
[45:50] seen your actions and like they said
[45:53] your action speaks louder than words
[45:55] anyway let's move on so attributes means
[45:58] a lot of things you know it's like
[46:00] you know you you cross a fig tree and
[46:02] you see plums on it well you know it's
[46:04] not a thick
[46:04] it's it's it can't be a fig tree it's a
[46:08] plum
[46:09] i can remember with my little boy he
[46:10] didn't know the difference between a cow
[46:12] and a dog and so we were driving along
[46:15] the highway in the country
[46:16] he says daddy look at that big old dog
[46:20] of course it was a cow
[46:25] yeah i'll never forget it cause i
[46:26] thought it was kind of cute and funny
[46:28] but you know but as he grew up
[46:31] and he has i'm sure he won't get that
[46:34] mixed up now
[46:36] right but if we are sons and daughters
[46:38] of god we
[46:39] are god's children then we are
[46:42] attributes of god that means
[46:44] what god possessed in his being
[46:48] his self his his self if he could say it
[46:50] like that
[46:52] we we are the reflection of him
[46:55] in other words you know god we can't be
[46:58] a liar
[47:00] and say we're reflecting god's
[47:02] attributes
[47:03] because the bible said god cannot lie
[47:07] oh my god that ought to make a baptist
[47:10] shower
[47:12] all right if we are sons and daughters
[47:14] of god
[47:15] we are god's children and we are
[47:17] attributes of god
[47:19] and then we got eternal life
[47:23] and god is the only listen to this god
[47:26] is the only eternal life there is
[47:30] when i was praying this morn or this
[47:32] evening i call him
[47:33] sweet eternity i didn't have to
[47:36] worry about whether he understood what i
[47:39] was saying
[47:40] because there is only one eternity and
[47:43] one sweet eternity
[47:45] and that's jesus christ our lord is that
[47:48] all right
[47:49] you call your wife honey why can't i
[47:51] call him sweet
[47:53] because he is he is
[47:57] david said it just in a different way
[47:59] he's sweeter than the honey and the cone
[48:02] hallelujah eternal life
[48:06] there is whoo then we were in him from
[48:09] the beginning
[48:10] and when jesus became all that word
[48:13] then we were a part of him then amen
[48:17] there you are that's in there there is
[48:20] no
[48:20] devil no power no nothing can ever move
[48:24] it
[48:25] i want you to i want you to anchor in
[48:27] this stop
[48:28] looking at your failures because if
[48:31] you're true if you truly
[48:32] son and daughter of god god will fix it
[48:36] amen he never leaves one behind
[48:42] matter of fact if there is one that's
[48:44] lagging he goes and get that one he
[48:46] leaves
[48:47] the 99 and go for the one that's our god
[48:51] he'll never come up at the end of the
[48:53] end of the day he'll never come up one
[48:56] shot
[48:57] or one over everything is accurate
[49:01] you see you can't like i try to tell
[49:04] people
[49:04] um one of the things that and i know
[49:09] this might sound a little gross but
[49:11] back in the day before they had all the
[49:14] preservatives and
[49:15] and all of the things that uh got rid of
[49:18] the tape worm that most people used to
[49:21] get
[49:22] i don't know about the rich people the
[49:23] poor people would get it because a lot
[49:25] of times we didn't have shoes and
[49:27] you know we couldn't pick the best of
[49:29] things when it came to food and
[49:31] perhaps we didn't have the best
[49:32] preserved way of doing things
[49:34] so we would get tape worms
[49:38] and you'll see a little guy he's just
[49:39] skinny and he's just
[49:41] constantly eating and the first thing
[49:43] they say oh
[49:44] you got to give him some casserole
[49:47] because he's got a tapeworm why
[49:51] because he was eating far more food than
[49:54] he should have been eating
[49:56] for his size and there was no growth to
[49:59] him
[50:01] see and nine times a 10 when those old
[50:04] folks would see that
[50:05] child carrying on like that they would
[50:07] give him that castor oil and you know
[50:10] brother branham talks about it that's
[50:13] one of the worst
[50:15] things you have to swallow ever
[50:18] it has no taste but it's just that
[50:21] nasty lord forgive me if i'm saying this
[50:24] thing wrong
[50:25] but one thing for sure brother said when
[50:28] his mom would give him that he said oh
[50:29] mom that'll make make me sick
[50:31] he said yes honey if it don't make you
[50:34] sick it won't do you no good
[50:36] i don't mean the worm didn't even like
[50:37] it so you know it was bad
[50:39] so you got to understand but it was it
[50:41] was what what we use
[50:43] to clean ourselves now we don't have
[50:45] tapeworms most of us
[50:47] in america don't have those things
[50:48] because now they put all the
[50:50] preservatives in
[50:51] they put all the stuff in the food
[50:57] right so we don't get that anymore wow
[51:00] but but during that time it was
[51:02] necessary
[51:03] i understand during that time you very
[51:06] seldom
[51:07] had colon cancer
[51:11] because those worms would do the job
[51:15] you understand what i'm saying and
[51:17] because of the food that we eat now
[51:18] and there's nothing to help clean it out
[51:22] that's what pours in our systems anyway
[51:25] let's move on
[51:26] so you and i must understand why why am
[51:28] i saying these things
[51:30] because no matter how bad you may appear
[51:33] to be to yourself
[51:35] you've got nothing to do with this
[51:39] it's all about him
[51:42] it's not him that willeth nor he that
[51:45] run it
[51:47] but it's god who showeth mercy now
[51:50] understand what i'm saying this
[51:52] i'm a true christian
[51:55] will always desire to do the perfect
[51:57] will of god
[51:58] amen that's it but none of us are
[52:02] perfect
[52:03] even after the seers will open and
[52:04] everything else you hear brother branham
[52:06] talk about all of his failures
[52:08] how faulty he was and how he needs the
[52:10] mercy and grace of god
[52:11] and we all need that tonight
[52:15] hallelujah i haven't even got to my but
[52:17] you see we must understand too that we
[52:19] have an eternal purpose
[52:21] this is why we suffer this is why we go
[52:24] through the things that we go through
[52:25] all right because eve in the beginning
[52:28] chose
[52:29] her own desire her own will over god's
[52:33] will
[52:33] that is the curse the curse
[52:36] is having your will
[52:40] in operation
[52:43] you understand me because it never was
[52:47] supposed to be
[52:47] when you get to heaven it's no longer
[52:49] your will
[52:50] it's his will when you get to heaven god
[52:54] he'll say okay do what you want to do
[52:55] hey it won't be that way right
[52:59] because his will was perfected even
[53:01] through a prophet
[53:03] the prophet was so submissive to his
[53:06] will he couldn't just go heal somebody
[53:09] or he just couldn't go anywhere he
[53:11] wanted to go he had to wait
[53:13] for the leadership of the holy ghost and
[53:16] when he waited he learned
[53:19] he learned the hard way when he
[53:22] at the first when he didn't go down to
[53:24] the pentecostal churches he
[53:26] listened to his mother-in-law and he
[53:28] allowed his will to get in his way
[53:30] and he lost his wife and kid because of
[53:33] his disobedience
[53:35] he knew what the will of god was i think
[53:38] even when indiana
[53:39] and africa y'all know the story where he
[53:41] chose to go a different place the angel
[53:43] of the lord told him not to go
[53:45] he caught him even almost died
[53:48] see so what was it he learned
[53:52] obedience through the things in which he
[53:55] suffered
[53:57] see so when you say oh what do you mean
[54:00] brother books
[54:01] you say will yes you got to understand
[54:03] if you don't pray
[54:05] every day and ask god to destroy and
[54:08] kill your will and let his will be done
[54:10] your will is going to reign throughout
[54:14] the day you're going to do what you want
[54:15] to do
[54:16] and you're going to forget what his will
[54:18] is you see what i'm saying
[54:19] that is the curse when god said be
[54:24] fruitful and multiply
[54:26] amen it was supposed to be done
[54:27] according to god's will
[54:31] look at the bible every time a promised
[54:33] seed came
[54:34] god showed up
[54:37] it was an announcement about an angel or
[54:39] something especially what they had a
[54:42] a great purpose to do he said well what
[54:44] about us
[54:46] we had an announcement did you not hear
[54:49] it
[54:50] brother branham says i will no longer
[54:52] call you church
[54:54] but i will call you bride that was an
[54:57] announcement
[54:59] and when he said the move is on for the
[55:01] bride that was an announcement
[55:03] that was god identifying us as bride
[55:07] separating ourselves separating us from
[55:10] the church
[55:12] it was god who's saying i have called
[55:14] you for a
[55:15] end-time purpose just like i have called
[55:18] william branham here for a purpose
[55:21] he served his purpose and now we must
[55:23] serve
[55:24] our purpose hallelujah
[55:27] and what is the main purpose is to show
[55:30] that jesus christ is god and that he is
[55:33] the same
[55:34] yesterday today and forever
[55:38] hallelujah but this must be birth into
[55:40] you
[55:42] you can't educate this into you you
[55:45] understand me
[55:46] god don't care about how well you
[55:48] articulate he doesn't care
[55:50] how well you pronounce your words you
[55:52] can be dumb as a doorknob
[55:54] but god is still wanting to be in a
[55:57] place where he can turn you whichever
[55:58] way he wants to turn you
[56:02] see you and i must understand amen
[56:06] we must not take the natural side of
[56:08] this message
[56:10] we must take the spiritual side of it
[56:13] you understand me
[56:14] because you have twins in the message
[56:15] now you've got that side that's going to
[56:18] be natural
[56:19] and most of the time the natural side
[56:21] outshine the spiritual
[56:25] they look better you see what i'm saying
[56:28] come on esau brother said esau looked
[56:31] better than jacob
[56:33] esau looked like the good child esau was
[56:36] obedient to his
[56:37] his father and served in food every time
[56:40] i hear that i think about a preacher
[56:42] esau was a good preacher
[56:45] right he was able to preach and it
[56:47] pleased his daddy
[56:49] but he still was not the chosen one
[56:53] it was jacob who struggled with his
[56:55] flesh
[56:56] it was jacob who struggled with his
[56:58] nature hallelujah
[57:00] but it was jacob amen who who who
[57:03] pressed through the battle
[57:05] because jacob realized that holy ghost
[57:07] that seal of the holy ghost
[57:09] is more important to me than anything in
[57:11] the world
[57:12] and whatever it takes to get there i'm
[57:15] going to get there
[57:16] you understand me he lied he was
[57:20] deceptive
[57:21] because he understood amen if i could
[57:23] get this blessing if i can get it it's
[57:25] mine yeah that's right
[57:29] those who were with brother random they
[57:30] were the first to come out
[57:33] but it was the latter son holding on to
[57:36] their heel
[57:38] hallelujah i'm gonna get this blessing
[57:41] you might have beat me here
[57:43] time wise hallelujah but eternity is on
[57:47] my side
[57:48] you understand me the blessings of god
[57:51] is on my side
[57:52] the blessings of god is on your side
[57:55] hallelujah that's why i love the bible
[57:57] because the bible just tells it just
[57:59] like it is
[58:00] god ain't covering nothing he tells us
[58:03] exactly how esau was
[58:04] he told us how abraham was and then he
[58:08] told us how messed up a lot of the seed
[58:10] of god was but he wasn't looking at that
[58:12] old
[58:13] that old hall that looked like looked
[58:15] like some kind of weed
[58:17] a cockapoo hallelujah but he said
[58:20] inside of that coca-boro they had a
[58:22] wheat germ
[58:24] hallelujah hey look at us look at us
[58:27] look at us
[58:28] you can find thought in yourself every
[58:30] day but when god see the seed in you
[58:33] you know what he said i find no fault
[58:36] hallelujah
[58:37] why because his word has been birthed
[58:40] into you
[58:41] hallelujah you're going to have
[58:42] struggles you're going to falter you're
[58:44] going to fall
[58:45] hallelujah and brother lamb said this
[58:47] old sinful flesh is going to be with you
[58:49] until jesus
[58:50] changed you
[58:53] your flesh ain't going to change but
[58:55] he's interested in the soul
[58:57] the seed of god amen i told brother
[59:00] isaac because he said he
[59:02] he preached the last time and he had it
[59:04] switched around
[59:05] the soul in the spirit and brother
[59:07] branham preached it like that for for
[59:08] years
[59:09] but then god through the uh his his
[59:12] increase of knowledge
[59:13] he then switched it back to the place it
[59:16] should be
[59:17] you understand me so he he told me about
[59:20] that
[59:20] and he said a brother came with we had a
[59:22] good spirit about about him it wasn't a
[59:24] bad spirit
[59:25] and he said he was willing to to correct
[59:27] it himself i said no brother i correct
[59:28] it for you
[59:29] he said thank you but we all make
[59:32] mistakes
[59:33] just like the other other week or month
[59:35] or so ago i said satan was the word
[59:37] satan was one time
[59:38] just one time in the word and nobody
[59:40] came to correct me
[59:42] come on pull up satan and see how many
[59:45] times
[59:46] it is in the word you understand me but
[59:48] we as
[59:49] preachers make mistakes like that and
[59:52] god doesn't look at the error
[59:54] because he knows our heart and he
[59:56] understands that our heart
[59:58] amen is to preach it just right
[1:00:00] hallelujah
[1:00:03] 4400 you know
[1:00:05] and you'll find even even in the prophet
[1:00:07] god i'll call out a scriptural text
[1:00:10] and it's not right because that's the
[1:00:13] human
[1:00:14] part of him you see what god doesn't
[1:00:17] you're not my prophet anymore see but
[1:00:19] that's what men do
[1:00:21] and god allow those failures you see
[1:00:23] what i'm saying
[1:00:24] it's your flesh that cloaks the glory of
[1:00:26] god it's those errors that you do
[1:00:30] that cloaks up you see that's why people
[1:00:33] couldn't see william branham
[1:00:35] being the messenger i've hung out with
[1:00:37] him he jokes he laughs he clears
[1:00:40] on he was a man
[1:00:43] but yet inside he had the god inside
[1:00:47] so do you that's why people don't see
[1:00:50] the god in you
[1:00:51] but we as christians see one another we
[1:00:53] see christ
[1:00:54] in you amen which is a hope of glory
[1:00:59] see don't take the natural that's death
[1:01:03] the natural man is death anything it
[1:01:07] does
[1:01:07] is death it's subject in here
[1:01:10] is that right come on saul
[1:01:14] whenever you hear saul you know i'm not
[1:01:16] talking about paul saul
[1:01:17] i'm talking the sawsaw the king saw amen
[1:01:22] and when you see him he was the type of
[1:01:24] the natural
[1:01:25] but david was the type of the spiritual
[1:01:29] hallelujah saul represented the natural
[1:01:32] man
[1:01:33] that goes after his own will that's why
[1:01:36] samuel says wait a minute now
[1:01:38] in other words did you not hear what the
[1:01:41] word of god said to you
[1:01:43] kill everything
[1:01:46] and saul said but you know the people
[1:01:48] and you know
[1:01:50] see we can make mistakes excuses but god
[1:01:52] does not he will not accept that
[1:01:55] the best thing you can say is lord i'm
[1:01:56] guilty
[1:01:58] forgive me for my sins see that's the
[1:02:00] same thing
[1:02:01] that adam eve did too they allowed their
[1:02:04] will to get in the way
[1:02:06] and they wanted to blame somebody else
[1:02:08] for their failures
[1:02:09] no look inside
[1:02:13] this is where your failures come from
[1:02:15] inside
[1:02:16] no matter what a person uh whatever they
[1:02:18] do to you
[1:02:20] they may be an error but your response
[1:02:23] will make you wrong
[1:02:27] and that's what the tests are for to
[1:02:29] bring what you
[1:02:30] what's inside out hallelujah
[1:02:34] so you got to understand by god's grace
[1:02:36] god ain't gonna say well
[1:02:37] you know because uh so-and-so did this
[1:02:40] to you i understand no no
[1:02:42] no no no because jesus christ was our
[1:02:45] perfect example
[1:02:47] of submission and submitting to the
[1:02:50] total perfect will of god
[1:02:53] the bible said he opened not his mouth
[1:03:00] and all of the pressure now people you
[1:03:03] can't do this
[1:03:04] but the holy ghost is designed he's in
[1:03:06] there
[1:03:07] to do it this is why he puts you through
[1:03:11] the test
[1:03:12] he wants to see you zip it he wants to
[1:03:14] see you not say a word
[1:03:16] he wants you listen i know i remember
[1:03:18] when i was in lime ohio
[1:03:20] i had a brother who was really upset
[1:03:22] about about some things and hear my son
[1:03:24] you've heard the testimony
[1:03:25] he was just yelling at me in front you
[1:03:28] know right there in the church y'all
[1:03:30] yelling at me and my son's standing
[1:03:31] right there i mean his spit was just
[1:03:33] going all in my face
[1:03:35] yeah and the holy ghost says
[1:03:38] don't say a word sheep
[1:03:42] don't prosecute sheep
[1:03:46] you might think you've got a right to
[1:03:48] say something but god says you don't
[1:03:51] if you're going to be a lamb you've got
[1:03:52] to be a lamb
[1:03:54] because he said at the moment you turn
[1:03:56] to a goat the holy spirit moves off
[1:04:00] you understand me god don't intend for
[1:04:02] you to open your mouth every time you
[1:04:04] better ask god
[1:04:05] what must i do see
[1:04:08] because your action amen is what god has
[1:04:11] looked god on display
[1:04:12] you understand me it's like when god
[1:04:15] chose job
[1:04:16] he put job on the trial so job's
[1:04:19] action could reflect what he really was
[1:04:22] that's why brother said you it's only
[1:04:24] when you're under pressure when the real
[1:04:26] you show up
[1:04:30] see don't go the natural man it's the
[1:04:33] spirit
[1:04:34] that make it alive see and that's what
[1:04:37] we must understand people i thought to
[1:04:39] myself many times i said lord
[1:04:41] the saints of old they took the
[1:04:43] persecution
[1:04:45] and when rome was killing them instead
[1:04:47] of running they
[1:04:48] ran to the lions and you know i said
[1:04:50] i've got to have
[1:04:52] that see you
[1:04:55] you you can't handle just a little trial
[1:04:57] what about the big things that's coming
[1:05:00] i got to have that and they they could
[1:05:03] not have done that on their own
[1:05:04] except the anointing of god was with
[1:05:06] them
[1:05:08] this is what i'm trying to say so the
[1:05:10] spiritual aspect of this message
[1:05:12] is only spirit spiritual when the holy
[1:05:15] spirit is on it
[1:05:17] when it has anointed it so much until it
[1:05:19] becomes a part of you
[1:05:21] that birth that you claim to have amen
[1:05:24] must bring forth christ
[1:05:26] if it doesn't bring forth christ the
[1:05:28] birth is not right
[1:05:30] amen it has to bring forth christ
[1:05:34] now don't get me wrong when you first
[1:05:36] get the holy ghost like a
[1:05:37] you're a baby you're learning brother
[1:05:40] madame explain that to us
[1:05:42] because a lot of us amen when we first
[1:05:44] get the holy ghost we think we're a big
[1:05:45] man
[1:05:46] oh you're not the least little trial
[1:05:49] and god pets you toss you up oh you're
[1:05:52] so cute
[1:05:54] give you all those sweet things when you
[1:05:56] first get it
[1:05:59] but you know our first little spanking
[1:06:01] it seemed like it hurt so much
[1:06:03] right when you first when you spank or
[1:06:05] just chastise a little baby
[1:06:07] you're not a little baby you know what
[1:06:08] i'm saying a toddler whatever you want
[1:06:10] to call them
[1:06:10] and then when you when you do it and
[1:06:12] you're getting them how you go
[1:06:14] pop but they understand
[1:06:17] right they cry like you just stuck a
[1:06:20] knife or something in them
[1:06:22] they do it you know why because they're
[1:06:24] so tender it emotionally stirred
[1:06:26] disturbs them
[1:06:27] because they realize you're worth them
[1:06:30] you weren't pleased with their actions
[1:06:33] right and what do they do i'm running no
[1:06:36] they come and they hug they got to get
[1:06:39] close to you
[1:06:40] and that's their way of saying i'm sorry
[1:06:42] that's their way of saying i repent
[1:06:45] y'all understand me so that's the way we
[1:06:47] must be
[1:06:48] you don't run from god when he spanks
[1:06:50] you you run to him
[1:06:53] you hug him you embrace him you make
[1:06:56] love to him in the sense to say
[1:06:58] i'm sorry let's move on for this
[1:07:01] corruptable must
[1:07:02] put on incorruption you understand me
[1:07:05] you don't have a choice
[1:07:06] it said it must put on must
[1:07:11] there's got to be a change in all of us
[1:07:17] this corruptible must put on
[1:07:19] incorruption and this mortal must put on
[1:07:22] immortality i just heard brother branham
[1:07:24] talk about it today
[1:07:25] uh on a message um
[1:07:28] uh and and he was saying how that
[1:07:31] death doesn't change you you think when
[1:07:34] you die
[1:07:35] if you're bad it's gonna switch on a
[1:07:38] good switch
[1:07:39] no when you die whatever spirit that
[1:07:42] that you have on you goes with you
[1:07:45] and if you got a spirit on you that's
[1:07:46] not of heaven
[1:07:48] where do you think you're going y'all
[1:07:51] understand what i'm saying
[1:07:52] this is why we can't allow these demons
[1:07:55] to continue
[1:07:56] to torment us and ride on our back
[1:07:59] because we know we got grace and mercy
[1:08:02] right taking advantage of god shouldn't
[1:08:05] do that
[1:08:06] none of us should do it we do it
[1:08:07] sometime but we shouldn't right
[1:08:10] god have mercy on us first peter 1 2 1
[1:08:13] 23 25 you don't have to turn there being
[1:08:16] born
[1:08:17] again not a corruptible seed but of
[1:08:20] incorruptible
[1:08:21] by the word of god which liveth and
[1:08:23] abideth forever so
[1:08:24] that christ in you is incorruptible you
[1:08:28] can't defile jesus
[1:08:31] even when he was in his flesh he could
[1:08:33] not be defiled
[1:08:35] how many remember the woman at simon's
[1:08:37] house and pharisees sitting there and
[1:08:39] says oh but if he should no he should
[1:08:41] know what kind of woman that is
[1:08:43] why they wouldn't have nothing to do
[1:08:45] with that kind of a person
[1:08:46] this is what irritated the sadducees so
[1:08:49] much
[1:08:50] because jesus was able to hang out as we
[1:08:53] say
[1:08:53] with publicans and sinners they were
[1:08:56] afraid
[1:08:57] i can't just a little bit of touch from
[1:09:00] them i'm unclean
[1:09:02] but jesus understood your uncleanness
[1:09:05] doesn't
[1:09:06] come from the outside of the cup your
[1:09:09] uncleanness come from the inside he said
[1:09:12] you're so conscious
[1:09:13] you're so uh uh concerned
[1:09:16] about the the outer cup he says no no
[1:09:18] clean the inside of the cup
[1:09:21] this is what he's saying clean the
[1:09:23] inside of the heart this is what god is
[1:09:25] concerned about
[1:09:27] hallelujah that's the way he was then
[1:09:29] that's the way he is now
[1:09:31] hallelujah by the word of god which
[1:09:32] liveth and the body forever see
[1:09:34] so if god is in you don't worry folks
[1:09:37] see we we i had to get rid of it i had
[1:09:40] to get rid of this
[1:09:42] this thought that i had so much to do
[1:09:45] with it
[1:09:46] and coming out of the apostolic church
[1:09:48] you know the
[1:09:49] the the church of laws rules and
[1:09:52] regulations
[1:09:53] you know i mean you know the least
[1:09:55] little thing you know lord if i make a
[1:09:57] mistake and
[1:09:57] i i don't i don't have time to confess
[1:10:00] or whatever and see we used to have to
[1:10:01] confess
[1:10:02] certain sins to our bishop right so it
[1:10:04] was just another form of catholicism
[1:10:07] right and so the thought was always if i
[1:10:10] sin
[1:10:11] and wasn't able to get to the bishop
[1:10:12] what happens see that's
[1:10:14] all wrong scripturally wrong
[1:10:18] but we find out that people even in the
[1:10:20] message have that same
[1:10:21] mentality and the reason why because
[1:10:23] they never got rid of that
[1:10:26] all of that must die all of that there's
[1:10:30] only one high priest
[1:10:32] and that's jesus christ hallelujah
[1:10:36] you must understand this old this whole
[1:10:38] flesh of this you can't have no trust in
[1:10:40] this
[1:10:40] it's wrong y'all didn't know that did
[1:10:43] you not know
[1:10:44] that your body is wrong your flesh is
[1:10:46] wrong
[1:10:48] wrong kind it's hybrid
[1:10:52] half beast and half god you understand
[1:10:55] me
[1:10:56] and it's you all know the way that goes
[1:10:59] it's wild
[1:11:02] it can't be tame you got to kill it
[1:11:06] right but anyway that's that corruptible
[1:11:09] seed it's corruptible
[1:11:11] right and so it goes on to peter says
[1:11:13] for all flesh is as grass
[1:11:15] and all the glory of men is the flower
[1:11:17] of grass
[1:11:19] the grass wither and the flower thereof
[1:11:22] fall of the way
[1:11:24] but the word of the lord and do it
[1:11:26] forever
[1:11:27] and this is the word which by the gospel
[1:11:30] is preached unto you in other words you
[1:11:33] don't have
[1:11:33] confidence in nothing but the
[1:11:36] incorruptible
[1:11:38] that seed of god that's in you when you
[1:11:41] know you are a christian
[1:11:42] you may not like i said it's a growth
[1:11:44] that god brings you through
[1:11:46] nothing you can do with your own right
[1:11:49] watch the scripture every period of
[1:11:53] growth
[1:11:54] for abraham was led by god even when it
[1:11:57] looked like
[1:11:57] abraham was going the wrong way abraham
[1:12:00] was going the right way
[1:12:01] god told him which way to go but god
[1:12:03] knew which way he was going to go
[1:12:06] you see and anytime every time you think
[1:12:10] you're out of the will of god not
[1:12:11] necessarily so
[1:12:13] because even so you think well that
[1:12:16] person how many times you've seen
[1:12:18] people who were backslidden you think oh
[1:12:21] my god how could they backslide
[1:12:23] and then they before coming back they
[1:12:26] bring somebody with them
[1:12:27] and say tell me that's not the bible
[1:12:30] that's the bible
[1:12:33] naomi and all of them backslid went to
[1:12:35] moab
[1:12:36] right and it looked like it was all out
[1:12:39] of god's will
[1:12:40] and god was telling a story hallelujah
[1:12:44] i just feel them all over me because we
[1:12:47] find out amen that
[1:12:48] here they were fascinating but then they
[1:12:50] brought back a jewel with them
[1:12:53] you see what i'm saying hallelujah so
[1:12:55] don't don't ever
[1:12:57] look at backsliders like oh god they
[1:12:59] just
[1:13:00] you don't know what god is doing you
[1:13:04] pray for him
[1:13:04] that's right because the bible said that
[1:13:06] even god loves the backsliding
[1:13:11] yes i've seen it done i don't want to
[1:13:13] call no name even in lime ohio
[1:13:16] a sister backslid one about my you know
[1:13:18] how we how we do it in the system
[1:13:19] one of my choice young people
[1:13:23] how could that ever happen not knowing
[1:13:25] what was going on
[1:13:27] and here she goes out there she met
[1:13:29] meets a guy who's a football player
[1:13:31] and all that stuff and here it is he
[1:13:33] come to church
[1:13:35] hear me preach ain't nothing let me
[1:13:37] preaching with jesus god save and still
[1:13:39] faithful married with children
[1:13:42] you understand me and i thought i told
[1:13:44] her i said you know sister this this is
[1:13:46] a rare case here it doesn't happen all
[1:13:49] the time
[1:13:50] but you never know what god is doing
[1:13:55] don't put god in the box right amen
[1:13:57] let's move on first john 5
[1:13:59] 18 says we know that whatsoever
[1:14:02] whosoever is born of god
[1:14:04] sinneth not but he that is begotten of
[1:14:06] god keepeth himself
[1:14:08] and that wicked one touches him not
[1:14:12] um now he talked about
[1:14:16] him keeping himself but really it's gone
[1:14:18] he's holding on to me
[1:14:20] we know whatsoever is born of god
[1:14:22] sinneth not and you know what sin is is
[1:14:24] disbelief
[1:14:26] we do not break the word because we
[1:14:28] disbelieve
[1:14:29] we break the word because of weaknesses
[1:14:31] and therefore god
[1:14:32] calls it calls those breakages false
[1:14:37] it's not intentionally done sin that is
[1:14:40] intentionally done
[1:14:42] is no longer called false
[1:14:45] it's called iniquity when you know to do
[1:14:48] good and you do it it's not
[1:14:50] and you do it it's not hallelujah and
[1:14:53] that's why some people are not are still
[1:14:55] still alive and well because god even
[1:14:57] died for the iniquity
[1:15:00] y'all better be glad we better be glad
[1:15:03] we can't no longer blame the devil but
[1:15:06] the devil made me do it no
[1:15:08] we got a word
[1:15:11] and we know by god's grace amen that the
[1:15:14] word that we have is that
[1:15:16] you make the choice
[1:15:20] but god covers it by the blood
[1:15:24] oh yeah brother tell you
[1:15:28] it's going to always be a struggle right
[1:15:30] did you know that
[1:15:31] i mean you know when rebecca was
[1:15:33] struggling there amen with her woman
[1:15:35] she had twins in there jacob and esau i
[1:15:39] can't imagine the discomfort
[1:15:41] those twins made gave rebecca
[1:15:45] nine months of fighting kicking and
[1:15:49] whatever they were doing in there but
[1:15:51] you know it had to be very uncomfortable
[1:15:53] i can remember the time time my wife
[1:15:55] would be you know when she was pregnant
[1:15:57] and sometimes she'd be
[1:15:58] trying to move that baby out of that
[1:15:59] position because it's real
[1:16:01] she said i feel like his elbow's
[1:16:03] sticking me there
[1:16:05] can you imagine four of them things
[1:16:07] going off at one time
[1:16:09] i don't know how it was but it was very
[1:16:11] uncomfortable so much so she had to
[1:16:13] inquire what in the world is going on in
[1:16:15] my womb
[1:16:16] and god said because you got two nations
[1:16:18] two natures
[1:16:19] two nations hallelujah now watch this
[1:16:23] because
[1:16:23] they did not come from a different
[1:16:25] mother and father
[1:16:26] they came from the same mama and the
[1:16:29] same daddy
[1:16:30] and the bible said that god did all of
[1:16:33] that
[1:16:34] to prove election
[1:16:37] somebody help me here because you got to
[1:16:40] realize
[1:16:40] it's not because you were so good that
[1:16:42] this message came to you
[1:16:44] it wasn't that you you know all of us
[1:16:46] were shysters in some kind of way
[1:16:49] but god knew the heart the bible says it
[1:16:52] like this god
[1:16:53] knoweth them that are his hallelujah
[1:16:57] even when you don't know it he knows it
[1:17:00] you say well what do you mean some of us
[1:17:02] we just like gideon
[1:17:04] lord oh lord if you be with us lord
[1:17:09] we'll be all the miracles and you fail
[1:17:12] to see
[1:17:12] like gideon did you
[1:17:16] what's the purpose
[1:17:19] god uses those
[1:17:23] who seem to fail at the drop of the hat
[1:17:27] come short those are the ones god uses
[1:17:30] here getting was was asking god almost
[1:17:33] charging god about
[1:17:34] where are you and here was a servant of
[1:17:37] the lord
[1:17:38] a believer cowing down
[1:17:42] every time my my my field gets ripe i'm
[1:17:46] ready to harvest
[1:17:47] here come the philistines they're taking
[1:17:50] everything
[1:17:50] now i don't have nothing to give my my
[1:17:52] kids
[1:17:53] but what made him different
[1:17:57] it was when god gave
[1:18:00] him his purpose you asked the question
[1:18:06] if god be with us where be the miracles
[1:18:10] now gideon because you asked the
[1:18:12] question you're the right one i need
[1:18:15] you want to see it happen
[1:18:18] and i'm going to make it happen in your
[1:18:21] life
[1:18:22] you understand me why do god put such
[1:18:24] these positions
[1:18:25] if there's a thirst for supernatural you
[1:18:28] are the purpose
[1:18:30] you're the one that god wants to show
[1:18:32] supernaturals to
[1:18:34] hallelujah but you need to girdle up
[1:18:36] your mind you got
[1:18:37] god has to somehow convince you that
[1:18:40] you're not a loser you're not a failure
[1:18:44] you're a conqueror get in i want you to
[1:18:47] understand who you
[1:18:48] are and i'm going to prove to you who
[1:18:52] you are
[1:18:53] bride of christ this is what god is
[1:18:55] trying to tell us you're not
[1:18:56] failures hallelujah you you're
[1:19:00] questioning me where the supernatural is
[1:19:02] amen let's take it higher hallelujah
[1:19:06] let's elevate our minds you're the
[1:19:08] reason for the season
[1:19:10] don't look at william branham he's gone
[1:19:13] hallelujah that's yesterday he want to
[1:19:15] see something happening today
[1:19:18] that's who you are you are the anointing
[1:19:21] of anointed ones
[1:19:23] for this hour the bride of jesus christ
[1:19:26] who knows oh jesus christ is saying
[1:19:28] yesterday we can quote that
[1:19:30] but that's not it's got to be it's got
[1:19:33] to be lived
[1:19:35] must be lived and you're the reason for
[1:19:37] the season this is why the word is being
[1:19:39] preached to you
[1:19:40] that it'll bring forth its fruit in his
[1:19:42] time
[1:19:43] in his season hallelujah
[1:19:47] they wrestled they wrestled and right
[1:19:49] now we wrestle between the spirit
[1:19:51] and the natural man all the time but
[1:19:53] guess who's the winner
[1:19:56] hallelujah jesus christ himself
[1:20:00] hallelujah you're going to win something
[1:20:01] you're going to lose some but at the end
[1:20:03] of the day
[1:20:04] you're a total victor hallelujah
[1:20:07] oh god will you accept me god accepted
[1:20:10] me
[1:20:11] way back when
[1:20:15] when i cried out to him and he responded
[1:20:18] he accepted me then he said i'll never
[1:20:22] lose one
[1:20:24] hallelujah he didn't give you no
[1:20:25] conditions he said i will never
[1:20:27] lose one and if you won you'll never be
[1:20:30] lost
[1:20:32] that's it his promise is not yours his
[1:20:36] we fail all the time that's why the
[1:20:39] prophet god said god had to give
[1:20:41] us an unconditional covenant he ain't
[1:20:44] gonna keep now don't make no vows to god
[1:20:46] because you're not going to keep them
[1:20:49] i'm an example
[1:20:58] hmm
[1:21:04] there's one scripture and i'm not going
[1:21:05] to stay too much longer see what time it
[1:21:07] is
[1:21:07] yeah got a few more minutes but anyway
[1:21:10] you see the scripture and i love the
[1:21:12] scripture in genesis 1 11-13
[1:21:14] says and god said let the earth bring
[1:21:16] forth grass
[1:21:17] the herbs are yielding seed the fruit
[1:21:19] trees healing fruit
[1:21:21] after his kind whose seed is in itself
[1:21:24] upon the earth and it was so let me ask
[1:21:26] you a quiet question what kind of tree
[1:21:28] are you
[1:21:30] you're a fruit tree and for an example
[1:21:34] when jesus walked by the fruit tree the
[1:21:36] fig tree
[1:21:37] and didn't see no fruit he was not happy
[1:21:42] so this bride tree must bring forth
[1:21:45] fruit
[1:21:46] if you want god to be really happy with
[1:21:49] you when he comes to
[1:21:50] look at you and examine you and there is
[1:21:52] no fruit on the tree
[1:21:54] you're in trouble right
[1:21:57] but you're a fruit tree and your this
[1:21:59] fruit tree is to what
[1:22:00] multiply
[1:22:04] i heard a brother talk about this the
[1:22:06] other day and um
[1:22:08] he was just saying the purpose of the
[1:22:10] bride is like it's the same purpose that
[1:22:13] eve and adam had
[1:22:14] and that was to multiply be fruitful and
[1:22:17] multiply
[1:22:20] right and now we understand that the
[1:22:23] multiplication of this
[1:22:24] tree which is the bride tree will be
[1:22:26] seen at the coming of the lord
[1:22:29] and he's going to replant us in the
[1:22:31] earth
[1:22:32] you understand in other words we will
[1:22:34] not be there be no births
[1:22:37] in this generation other than the
[1:22:39] spiritual birth
[1:22:40] you see what i'm saying and so when we
[1:22:43] go and we die
[1:22:44] we go to heaven or under that in that
[1:22:46] sixth dimension
[1:22:47] when we there amen what do you think god
[1:22:50] is doing
[1:22:50] he's taking all of the trees of time
[1:22:54] and destroying them because
[1:22:57] we are holy and this earth is not worthy
[1:23:01] of us
[1:23:02] and once we are translated and moved
[1:23:04] into that glory
[1:23:05] that theophany and that glorified body
[1:23:08] this whole
[1:23:09] thing has to be changed
[1:23:12] for us to reign on there
[1:23:15] hallelujah this place has to be made
[1:23:18] holy
[1:23:19] oh it has to be cleansed of
[1:23:22] all of the devils and demons
[1:23:26] hallelujah oh yes
[1:23:29] oh yes you think you're nothing now
[1:23:33] but let me tell you something when you
[1:23:34] come back you will be in power
[1:23:38] and in rule and we will rule with a rod
[1:23:42] of iron
[1:23:44] huh yes
[1:23:47] hallelujah maybe you think you're not
[1:23:49] much
[1:23:50] but god has chosen you if i can say it
[1:23:53] like this
[1:23:54] for the next generation because after
[1:23:57] this generation
[1:23:58] there are there will be no more
[1:24:03] we're it we're we are the if you can say
[1:24:06] like this
[1:24:07] we are the eternal generation
[1:24:10] yeah after his gene after his kind
[1:24:14] and god cannot ask adam the first adam
[1:24:17] to do something that he himself was not
[1:24:19] going to do
[1:24:20] that's why the bible said we in
[1:24:22] corinthians 15
[1:24:24] said we bear the image of the the the
[1:24:27] natural man the earthly man
[1:24:28] and just as we bore the image of the
[1:24:30] natural man we shall also bear the image
[1:24:33] of this heavenly the spiritual
[1:24:35] hey that ought to make you shout if
[1:24:37] you're dead it ought to wake you up
[1:24:41] oh cause our birth listen so you'll
[1:24:44] understand what i'm saying
[1:24:45] what brother adam said listen in jehovah
[1:24:47] jireh he said christ
[1:24:49] that tree that was in the garden of eden
[1:24:52] there were two trees in the garden of
[1:24:54] eden these
[1:24:55] two trees were set there for a birth
[1:24:59] purpose
[1:25:02] that's why they were there isn't that
[1:25:04] right is that what god first told adam
[1:25:07] and eve
[1:25:08] he told adam he said be before we even
[1:25:10] knew who he was
[1:25:12] be fruitful and multiply when he took
[1:25:16] the cows and the
[1:25:17] horses and whatever they were what all
[1:25:19] in that day
[1:25:20] they were already into into multiplying
[1:25:22] god didn't say
[1:25:23] sheep multiply today sheep multiply them
[1:25:25] all no they were
[1:25:26] already in the groove of multiplying god
[1:25:29] had already dealt with that they knew
[1:25:31] that
[1:25:32] and that was the secret of the serpent
[1:25:35] he knew
[1:25:36] how to multiply without the will of uh
[1:25:39] uh
[1:25:41] you know god telling them when randomly
[1:25:43] you know you understand what i'm trying
[1:25:44] to say
[1:25:46] because god set a time for every animal
[1:25:49] to have
[1:25:51] siblings uh we want to say offspring
[1:25:54] but the man because of his will he
[1:25:57] allowed the beast to come in
[1:25:59] and now we can multiply whenever we want
[1:26:02] to
[1:26:04] but sheeps have a season every
[1:26:07] every animal has a season and they
[1:26:09] normally bring forth in the spring
[1:26:11] but we can bring forth summer spring
[1:26:13] winter and fall
[1:26:17] and by doing that we gave avenue
[1:26:20] to the serpent seed and that's how the
[1:26:23] serpentine became
[1:26:24] multiple they became so many they all
[1:26:27] multiplied us
[1:26:29] hallelujah and at the end of the day it
[1:26:32] was more
[1:26:33] serpents in the world than it was the
[1:26:35] seed of god
[1:26:36] so is it today so is it today
[1:26:40] because of the multiplying and the
[1:26:41] multiplying they multiply
[1:26:43] more than we yes sir more than us is
[1:26:46] that right
[1:26:47] more of the children of the bondwoman
[1:26:49] isaiah said
[1:26:50] then of the free
[1:26:54] amen so what because of will
[1:26:58] and you and i must understand how
[1:27:00] powerful this is you know what you're
[1:27:01] talking about brother brooks
[1:27:03] why do you think in the garden
[1:27:07] man established his will over god
[1:27:11] adam did in the garden
[1:27:15] man submitted his will in the god
[1:27:18] jesus said not my will but thine be done
[1:27:22] you see so you can see it comes right
[1:27:26] back to
[1:27:27] god's word what happened before before
[1:27:30] god did all of this
[1:27:31] what was it lucifer exalted his will
[1:27:34] above god i will i will see it comes
[1:27:38] right back to your will versus god's
[1:27:40] will
[1:27:41] and only the holy ghost can can bring
[1:27:43] you to a place
[1:27:45] where god's will will be dominant
[1:27:50] see god is more than a feeling
[1:27:53] he's life and we've been taught even in
[1:27:56] the pentecostal church you know
[1:27:58] oh did you feel it god
[1:28:02] feelings can be so deceptive
[1:28:08] you can't go by feelings this is by
[1:28:11] faith
[1:28:13] and faith doesn't have feelings faith
[1:28:16] can cause
[1:28:16] feelings but faith in your soul
[1:28:20] there's no feelings it's a mighty
[1:28:23] revelation
[1:28:24] in there that nut cannot be moved or
[1:28:26] taken away
[1:28:29] is that right god had to put it wasn't
[1:28:31] just
[1:28:32] a baby that god put in the womb of mary
[1:28:35] he had to quicken her faith
[1:28:39] and we don't even know but mary didn't
[1:28:42] just
[1:28:42] oh man you know how pete found out
[1:28:43] you're pregnant oh he says i'm so happy
[1:28:46] that wasn't her case she was looked upon
[1:28:49] as an adulterous woman
[1:28:51] a fornicator her child was looked upon
[1:28:54] as a curse
[1:28:56] she had to bare all of that
[1:29:00] with her head up you think there's oh
[1:29:02] i'm so
[1:29:03] sad they just don't like me no she
[1:29:05] understood
[1:29:06] she had a visitation from the angel she
[1:29:09] knew god had spoken to her and she
[1:29:11] understood
[1:29:12] what she was carrying y'all understand
[1:29:14] me we cannot be ashamed of this message
[1:29:17] we can't be silent we can't keep silent
[1:29:21] this is real and when god is in you let
[1:29:24] him criticize
[1:29:25] oh you're going to call you this you
[1:29:27] that no it doesn't matter what you say
[1:29:29] we have heard from the lord and this
[1:29:32] thing within me
[1:29:33] is of the holy ghost amen
[1:29:37] y'all have no idea up here see you and i
[1:29:41] must understand
[1:29:42] jesus is the word made manifest he
[1:29:45] in the word is one and the same and
[1:29:47] that's why it was so
[1:29:48] made manifest in him so perfectly that
[1:29:51] the re that's the reason that god
[1:29:53] manifested himself so perfectly in jesus
[1:29:55] because he was the seed word the germ
[1:29:58] word
[1:29:58] itself the germ that's inside the seed
[1:30:02] that's the life in the seed you get it
[1:30:05] see what it is he was that germ word of
[1:30:08] god
[1:30:08] the germ is the spirit the germ is the
[1:30:11] water
[1:30:12] and jesus had to be broken open he there
[1:30:15] in order for the seed to let the forth
[1:30:18] the life
[1:30:19] to water other uh other seeds that was
[1:30:22] coming
[1:30:22] see uh he said other sheep
[1:30:26] uh that that let me back up he said he
[1:30:29] even he said other sheep i that
[1:30:32] that's not even of this foe i have
[1:30:35] they're going to see that they're going
[1:30:38] to get the word and stay right with it
[1:30:40] and i'm sending forth the spirit to
[1:30:43] water it
[1:30:44] [Applause]
[1:30:46] yay
[1:30:48] hallelujah oh my goodness you know
[1:30:51] that's why david was so excited i'm
[1:30:53] almost done i'm almost done because i
[1:30:54] want to at least leave a little
[1:30:55] something for sunday
[1:30:57] i don't know what i'm going to preach on
[1:30:58] sunday whatever god's will is but my
[1:31:00] point is
[1:31:01] amen when you can see god in you
[1:31:05] no matter what no matter what
[1:31:10] you know i try to tell people say you
[1:31:13] know
[1:31:14] brother ben didn't make that statement
[1:31:16] for nothing a lot of people you think
[1:31:17] are not going to make it
[1:31:19] they'll be there and those who you think
[1:31:22] are going to make it won't
[1:31:23] many of them you know what because many
[1:31:26] of them have adopted a system of worship
[1:31:29] this is the way the message say we're
[1:31:30] supposed to do it and this is the way
[1:31:32] we're going to do it
[1:31:33] hallelujah but that's not the bible
[1:31:35] that's not the bible says they that are
[1:31:37] led by the spirit
[1:31:39] they are the sons of god not some letter
[1:31:43] it's by the spirit can you imagine how
[1:31:46] jesus would have been
[1:31:48] if he would have taken the word and and
[1:31:50] and and made it in a
[1:31:52] uh in such a calm away like the
[1:31:53] pharisees
[1:31:56] everything would have been unclean
[1:31:59] but he was led by the spirit
[1:32:02] when that woman with the issue of blood
[1:32:04] touched him you know what he he's
[1:32:05] supposed to go wash
[1:32:07] separate himself that was the law any
[1:32:12] unclean thing and then go
[1:32:14] you know let her touch lay his hand on a
[1:32:16] dead body go read the word
[1:32:20] but he came he was grace and truth you
[1:32:23] can't
[1:32:23] listen people say well let me tell you
[1:32:25] something an old friend of mine he's
[1:32:26] going on to be with the lord and i'm
[1:32:28] almost done
[1:32:30] my brother jim makely from uh uh lime
[1:32:33] ohio
[1:32:34] he went in a club and
[1:32:37] preached in the club hello
[1:32:42] the man closed the club down
[1:32:46] he repented he was saved
[1:32:49] he was baptized in the name of the lord
[1:32:51] jesus christ
[1:32:52] and for what i understand he he god
[1:32:54] filled him with the holy ghost
[1:32:56] and shortly after that he was at jim
[1:32:59] makely's house reading his bible and
[1:33:01] fell dead
[1:33:03] you understand me and a lot of people we
[1:33:06] don't understand what god is doing
[1:33:10] you know people might even look at
[1:33:11] jamaica well i don't know whether he was
[1:33:12] in the mess what are you talking about
[1:33:14] what is the message
[1:33:15] the message is the holy ghost
[1:33:18] that's what it is it is the holy ghost
[1:33:21] it's not the letter
[1:33:22] or the tapes it's the holy ghost
[1:33:27] the sealing of the holy ghost is what
[1:33:28] it's all about
[1:33:30] if that life in you it will live its way
[1:33:33] through it through you
[1:33:34] right you become a puppet in god's hands
[1:33:38] can i say it like that i'm just going to
[1:33:41] stop there
[1:33:44] but if the lord would allow i want to
[1:33:47] work it work with the
[1:33:48] enforcer see if if it's a birth
[1:33:51] if something is going on in you it's
[1:33:53] something there's a law to enforce it
[1:33:56] see you you can't do it you know as like
[1:33:58] brother branham described it he says
[1:34:00] like the birds if they think about
[1:34:02] flying how they could scientifically
[1:34:04] you know draw it out on how to fly he
[1:34:06] said they'll never fly
[1:34:08] he said but they learn something in them
[1:34:10] learn how to
[1:34:12] take advantage of the law that's in them
[1:34:18] i could scream right now because we got
[1:34:21] a law
[1:34:22] we got a law in us that would make it
[1:34:25] can cause us to walk through walls
[1:34:28] y'all understand what i'm saying we've
[1:34:30] got a law in us that can
[1:34:32] translate us like filler
[1:34:36] y'all understand me see there's a law in
[1:34:39] us that
[1:34:39] we want to learn how to
[1:34:43] submit to it because that's that's the
[1:34:46] way it is you take an ego they
[1:34:48] you know they have to you know well son
[1:34:50] this is the drawing board here and i'm
[1:34:52] going to tell you how this working
[1:34:54] of course this wind come this way and
[1:34:56] and you got the flap
[1:34:58] it would never work like teaching a baby
[1:35:01] like brother i'm saying to ring a bell
[1:35:03] every time you get thirsty
[1:35:07] it'll never work there's a provided way
[1:35:09] there's a provided way
[1:35:12] you want the holy ghost go home and act
[1:35:13] like a madman call on the name of jesus
[1:35:17] get in your closet and where you won't
[1:35:20] have to worry about nobody looking at
[1:35:21] you
[1:35:22] you know people don't pray right because
[1:35:23] they're so concerned about what people
[1:35:25] are doing looking at me i'm looking at
[1:35:26] me praying
[1:35:28] you see but in the closet or somewhere
[1:35:31] privately you can be as real as you want
[1:35:33] to
[1:35:34] yes you could tell it like it really is
[1:35:38] cry whatever you know everybody's
[1:35:41] different like i
[1:35:42] explained everybody's birth is different
[1:35:44] but it's a birth
[1:35:46] some people you know it take an hour or
[1:35:48] so and they the baby's already delivered
[1:35:51] some people that take 12 hours some
[1:35:52] people it takes six
[1:35:54] you understand me and i have heard that
[1:35:56] there are some sources
[1:35:58] who could have a birth and hardly feel
[1:36:00] any pain at all
[1:36:02] yeah that's what i've been told and i
[1:36:04] know a sister that could do it
[1:36:06] i mean and she wasn't she wasn't on no
[1:36:08] medicine
[1:36:09] yeah last name was simmers and she said
[1:36:13] up there in the bed and my wife is in
[1:36:14] the bed and
[1:36:15] they both having labor pains and this
[1:36:17] sister just
[1:36:19] and i thought she was on medication
[1:36:24] bro hey her baby was a what tim between
[1:36:27] 11
[1:36:27] 10 and 11 pounds
[1:36:31] ah i'm telling you i'm
[1:36:34] winniper winner for simmons that's her
[1:36:36] name
[1:36:38] yeah and you know she told me and
[1:36:41] maybe i got if i messed it up i mean she
[1:36:43] told me you know basically she don't
[1:36:45] feel pain
[1:36:46] now i don't understand that i really
[1:36:48] don't now my wife
[1:36:50] she's not a screamer you know she have
[1:36:53] the baby you know she
[1:36:54] she she'll know she she'll clamp down
[1:36:57] now but she ain't screaming
[1:36:58] but guess what there are some who scream
[1:37:02] and it's like i tell people whatever's
[1:37:03] gonna help you do it
[1:37:06] there's no systematic way of really
[1:37:08] having a baby because
[1:37:09] you're not having the pain you're not
[1:37:11] delivering it you can't say honey you
[1:37:13] ought not to carry on like that you know
[1:37:15] what she should say
[1:37:16] let's switch patients let's see how you
[1:37:19] carry on
[1:37:20] on this side of the you know what i'm
[1:37:22] saying okay oh she carried on real bad
[1:37:25] oh
[1:37:27] i was a little boy i'm closing i was a
[1:37:29] little boy
[1:37:31] and my sister one of my sisters was
[1:37:32] having her first baby
[1:37:34] and she had no idea
[1:37:38] but i remember being in the living room
[1:37:40] and she went to sit down
[1:37:42] and couldn't sit down she went like let
[1:37:44] me just
[1:37:46] but it was more of a girl scream
[1:37:50] and from that point on it was on
[1:37:54] and one thing my sister said i'm not
[1:37:57] having another one that's it
[1:37:59] i ain't having no more babies well she
[1:38:01] had two or
[1:38:02] two two more babies after that but but
[1:38:05] one of my sisters
[1:38:06] she swore to it and she stuck to it see
[1:38:09] because
[1:38:10] nobody knows you know you love the
[1:38:13] product
[1:38:14] you understand me once god is in your
[1:38:17] life in such a way
[1:38:18] you love it but sometimes we forget what
[1:38:20] it took to get it
[1:38:23] jacob had to wrestle all night and
[1:38:25] that's what brother random said he said
[1:38:27] we just don't stay on our knees long
[1:38:29] enough
[1:38:32] you ain't getting a holy ghost you know
[1:38:34] you got to go there you know boldly

[1:38:47] mentality that you've got and let me
[1:38:49] tell you something in closing
[1:38:50] you've got to continue to pray
[1:38:57] right one experience with the lord is
[1:38:59] not enough

[1:40:52] they can't shout in
[1:40:54] or dance they don't plan to dance
[1:41:00] yeah i've gone to churches and they're
[1:41:03] so well set up they got all kind of
[1:41:05] microphones and hookups
[1:41:06] i said get them holy ghost get them
[1:41:10] just let loose one time they be calling
[1:41:14] 9-1-1
[1:41:15] you understand what i'm saying it's too
[1:41:17] much formal stuff it's too much
[1:41:20] hollywood it's too much everything it's
[1:41:23] just too much
[1:41:27] one of my best friends she's going on to
[1:41:29] be with the lord i trusted
[1:41:30] i used should say vivian you shouldn't
[1:41:32] be and i was in pentecostal church i
[1:41:34] said you shouldn't be wearing them
[1:41:35] hiding shoes like that that
[1:41:36] that's just not right and one day i was
[1:41:40] walking to work and i don't know why she
[1:41:41] had on those shoes oh she was going to
[1:41:42] get a check or something
[1:41:44] but anyway she went down this incline
[1:41:47] with i'm telling you heels like crazy
[1:41:50] and she's a heavy girl well
[1:41:55] yes she failed
[1:42:04] i ain't gonna be no hypocrite did you
[1:42:07] laugh
[1:42:07] yes but i waited
[1:42:12] i wanted to make sure she was soft
[1:42:16] she never warm again so i'm telling you
[1:42:18] see sometimes god has to
[1:42:20] teach you and every time i see them
[1:42:23] with the shoes like that i'm like get
[1:42:24] them lord i think about vivian god come
[1:42:26] show you that's wrong
[1:42:28] he gonna show you one way or another
[1:42:30] yeah
[1:42:31] and vivian she laughed too she laughed
[1:42:38] i can see it i'm sorry i can see but we
[1:42:40] were best of friends don't get me wrong
[1:42:42] we're best of friends and so we can
[1:42:44] laugh at each other
[1:42:45] but nevertheless amen she uh she never
[1:42:48] will
[1:42:49] to my knowledge ever again those kind
[1:42:52] but you know god has to teach you
[1:42:54] one and before judgment now god is
[1:42:57] dealing with us and dealing with our
[1:42:58] hearts
[1:43:00] all of us want to be closer to god
[1:43:01] otherwise we wouldn't be here
[1:43:04] i believe that and i believe this is a
[1:43:06] special church i believe that god has
[1:43:07] given me
[1:43:08] real christians and real real bride
[1:43:10] material
[1:43:11] but you as an individual even including
[1:43:14] myself i can't
[1:43:15] do what you can do and every one of us
[1:43:18] have
[1:43:19] we got a purpose it's not just to come
[1:43:22] to church we have a purpose
[1:43:23] and i thought to myself i said oh god i
[1:43:25] said maybe i need a bulletin board or
[1:43:27] something back there so we can
[1:43:29] write our testimonies out you know
[1:43:32] something small i know god is doing
[1:43:33] something for you every day
[1:43:35] and those things are good to know people
[1:43:37] need to know because
[1:43:39] maybe they're going through something
[1:43:40] the same stuff you don't have to sign
[1:43:42] your name
[1:43:43] just say i'm one what god did for me
[1:43:45] today has done for me today
[1:43:48] you know and that's what kept the
[1:43:49] churches they overcame by the blood of
[1:43:51] the lamb and the word of their testimony
[1:43:53] and we don't have enough testimonies
[1:43:55] going on in this church
[1:43:56] and god i know god is doing something
[1:43:59] i know he does in my life he works in my
[1:44:01] life and i see him every day
[1:44:04] yes every day let's stand
[1:44:12] who gonna love you like he loves you
[1:44:15] no it's true yo we have good friends
[1:44:19] best friends
[1:44:20] but they ain't gonna love you like jesus
[1:44:23] they're not gonna do it they might want
[1:44:25] to but being human
[1:44:26] being who we are only god gonna love you
[1:44:30] like that
[1:44:34] if they come to a place and god is
[1:44:35] really full in their lives
[1:44:37] they can love you like that but it's not
[1:44:40] them as god in them
[1:44:44] you know god will love you so much amen
[1:44:46] that he'll never take the past and throw
[1:44:48] it up in your face
[1:44:51] because he doesn't remember he don't
[1:44:52] remember the past he's not with them
[1:44:55] thrown in the sea of forgetfulness and
[1:44:58] every one of us
[1:44:59] can let brother adam sit like this he
[1:45:01] said we were born
[1:45:04] born losers we only win because of jesus
[1:45:09] only one man one wins wins the race
[1:45:18] he finished that line
[1:45:21] even when he said that calvary it's
[1:45:22] finished
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:24] even though john didn't know it he
[1:45:26] couldn't see things like he saw when he
[1:45:28] when he went up higher he he didn't know
[1:45:31] he didn't understand a lot of things
[1:45:34] but when they say john don't you we we
[1:45:36] got a man who finished the line
[1:45:38] we got a man who won we got a man who
[1:45:41] crossed
[1:45:41] hey he's a lamb now john john looked to
[1:45:45] see the lamb and there he
[1:45:47] the lion he saw a lamb so you see
[1:45:50] it's all in god and and people of god we
[1:45:53] the thing is why satan keeps us the way
[1:45:55] we
[1:45:56] we fail to see we failed to take this
[1:45:58] word
