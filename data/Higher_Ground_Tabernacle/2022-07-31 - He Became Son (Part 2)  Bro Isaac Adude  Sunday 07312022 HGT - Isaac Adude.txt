greet you all in name of the lord jesus christ amen we're so happy to be here this morning man we're so happy to be here this morning amen let's bow our heads and if you don't go to god and pray [Music] dear heavenly father lord shalom celeste lord we're so glad to call you a father lord for everything lord that you have done for us lord you've been more than a father to us lord even when we we were sinned and we did things that wasn't right lord where you still loved us lord even even when we lord we we we weren't as as christians are supposed to be lost [Music] but lord you'll still your love still with us [Music] lord that's why we want to thank you lord [Music] lord even when we didn't love ourselves father god but lord as the bible says that for god so loved the world may come with you that he sent me his only begotten son [Music] lord you were talking about this lord jesus would you love this before the foundation of the world [Music] lord we thank you father god for your grace this morning lord open their hearts of father lord so they can receive the lord make me so sensitive to the holy spirit so that i can say what you what you want me to say for lord pray for our pastor brother brooks where are you down in south carolina lord pray father god that you you that you bless this meetings [Music] amen amen amen god bless you goodness amen um let's let's um open up bibles in the book of genesis chapter 28. which we'll read the verse 15. it's only the verse genesis chapter 28 verse 6 verse 15. the bible says happy birthday and behold i am with thee and i will keep the in all places whether thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken of deal with we read verse uh 19 to 28. amen amen i was just thinking just right now meant to know how you know brother brooks how brother brooks does it preaching every day like every single service that's what the service it's it's tiring for sure just the only three services that i've been preaching it's just uh selfies amen i'm feeling it like it's really really is it it's all right amen let's go to uh hebrews chapter nine we read the verse nineteen to twenty-eight for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of cows and of goats with water and call it it's called a wool and highs up and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the this is the blood of the of the testament which god has enjoined unto unto you all moreover sprinkle with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood remission [Music] it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in having the heavens shall be purified with these by the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these necessities for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the of the true but in the heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us sanctuary often as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others for must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of of himself and as it is appointed unto men who wants to die but after this judgment so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without seeing under salvation and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission um the memphis kisitofer verse 22. um [Music] we just read your word father that we pray to father god that you come and you open it to us lord because the prophet usually say that man can turn the pages of this book but you are the only one who can give the true meaning of those the words that we read that's why we pray that you the great teacher amen this morning uh by god's grace i would like to continue with what we were preaching on wednesday amen the title was he became son amen because as we we said it last sunday amen that god who was before the beginning he made himself into a form that we call the logos amen and then from there he started to create and that's where that's when the time began and then from the logos he took a flesh that god had to come under three sons and sons names amen first of all he had to come as a son of man as a prophet because that's what the word tells us when moses said that he will he will raise a prophet like unto unto me when that prophet will speak you have to listen to what he says the key of the kingdom of god and we know that the bible tells us that he came as a son of man that was jesus in the flesh so the prophet says that he had to die go up and then come back as a son of god which is the holy spirit is praying amen god in the form of the spirit jesus from this amen now at this time he will he didn't come back down to be with us but he came down to be in us amen as the son of god millennium amen so now the sun is is the form that god takes to uh uh um to appear or to uh to to to be with his people see the form to draft amen it's the form that god takes if you want to do a work he takes that form of his son amen because the bible tells us that god is a spiritual so that's why we read the quote of the prophet that says that that logos that was in the beginning everything was created by him and for him amen and that the prophet says that and between the son of god and and the son of david the prophet even he has to return back again as the son of man amen to do the same work that he did back there when he was to the jews amen to reveal the secret of the heart amen to do all those great works and then at the end of everything if we all found it to choose and to bring the change you're meant to prepare the bride for the rapture that's why he was able to give us to get to come down with a shout out with the voice and with the trumpet of god to get us ready for that to get if you read the whole the old testament the old testament you would know that the gentiles didn't have any part in the temple to take you back to that position where that you were before amen so it's about that redemption that we will talk about this morning women of him coming now dying on the cross the so now the prophet says in the message possess possessing the gate the gift of enemy after trial is to buy one more time or to buy whatever you have you had before losing it for the blue scoops it's not buying new stuff stuff and then you have to equip the house with good and new furnitures no redemption is buying something that you had before for one reason or another you lost that thing so you have to buy it again so that's why that's what redemption is so for you to be redeemed even you had to be in god's thought before the big before the foundation of the world because if you never was with god you will never be with well then anything redeemed has to come back to where it we fell from it shows that the real christian is an attribute of god's thinking before there was a world a volcano or a star we need one or an heir or anything else the man of this young boy this young man when he made a boat he made like a toy he was playing with him and he spent all his time making that toy form and then he was his favorite toy to him when he was looking at that toy man that toy was perfect regardless of he went to school so on his way back and then he said that for some reason he decided to go to a pawn shop a man needs to still worth this they sell old stuff like use stuff and sense and when he went there when he went in there he meant for and then he saw his his little toe so he went to the person who was selling he said that that's mine so i need to have it personal that little toy belongs to me look i even have scars that you know when i was making it i got hurt and i got there so i need to have this toy box so the seller looked at him and he said little boy so in order for this toy to become yours again how much do you sell it well it's 30 cent you might say 10 cents he said well he looked at his in his pocket and he had a little you had some money and when he started counting that money was 29 cents and you could and you couldn't and you couldn't buy it they said well man i only have 29 how can i do what can i do he says well it's 30 if you don't pay the entire foo if you don't pay the full price you're not getting the total paypal amen well he said what he thought he was like well i have some money back at home so let me run really back and then i'll come back mine at the adventure my partner now you mine again but don't you my party when you once was mine dude to my bathroom yeah man you once were mine i went to my bathroom but i lost you so now you mine again i mean women amen we once belonged to god knows about the new advantage amen we were in god's mind remember coming down here on earth amen we sold ourselves to the devil and we sold ourselves to the devil so in other words we got lost so god for god to come and to take us back for our redemption [Music] um because that price that was fixed the price that you had to pay the price no one else on earth could pay their price person should i tell them there is no money that could have paid that price there is no other bloods that could have paid their price only the blood of christ the blood of animals couldn't pay their price the sun is animal puppies remember it was only the blood of christ the three so that's why he had to become a son what i'm going to visit with you amen to die on the cross amen to suffer there's all man suffering demand to be tempted and to be tried his master will sell him or or will put him on to death unless someone comes and buys him unless someone comes and redeems him amen we sold ourselves to the devil and in other words we became slaves the bible says this it was to give a life had to die someone had to die amen that's what justification means since christians feel like justification so jesus oh jesus woman he took our place he took our sentence for us he died on the cross for us so that we can be saved his blood couldn't pay for us for redemption he didn't have the he didn't have what he took what he took for our redemption and the prophet said that satan will be taken from the earth the prophetic get a born again christians for god from the foundation of the world foresaw him and sent jesus to redeem him the only thing he hears is your voice he sees your representation that is true right amen how can you sin come on even when that sin cannot be seen when she came to the prophet the prophet looked at her and said that i can't see anything wrong with you i can't see any sin in you well i'm pretty sure she wondered but why but well i did this yesterday and i did this the day before that jesus forget capacity we don't have that ability to erase the past of someone else when we there is nothing that can condemn us amen there is nothing that can stand against us the devil can come to god and say well this is what he did yesterday god will look in and say well i don't before a man could redeem his lost property i mean he had to be only the the nearest kinsmen who were supposed to to to redeem the the their property every word and that product that that person who uh uh uh giving the money will become his master person and that person in other terms will become a slave person because he had to serve until his money is is is paid for or if if the other case for for him to uh to get out of that debt it meant someone closer to him had to come and pay the price for him even a kids man had to come and pay the price that was required amen so that's exactly what jesus did for us exactly and then he became our nearest kinsmen that was required for our redemption everything yeah i found it too true i mean he made a public testimony there on the cross he was seen by everybody he was there even even the sun is creatures amen it was ashamed to give its light the moon and the stars to see the creator being naked emma that he had to go through to save you amen amen amen he had to become a sinner so that you can become a son of god book of the vineyard a man he had to change he was a change of place amen i was a sinner amen i was born in sin amen came to earth by iniquity and and telling lies about this on demonstration it meant by god made you even he had to take my place amen become sin amen to take my place poop onto my planet women everything that he did was healing sick people just let me face it again everything that he did was giving sight to a blind man everything that he did was multiplying bread and fish but there is nowhere in the bible he didn't consider himself as as he didn't consider himself as a hype in the higher place that's why he took the lowest deaths he became the lower man woman to die on the cross next to the next two tips to sinners even him who didn't do anything remember i had to go through such a pain made a bit higher it doesn't tell you to do anything hard if the one part the fact is it doesn't tell you to do anything real hard it doesn't require you to do anything hard it was exist the only thing it requires from you like social skills is angel become the lamp amen he didn't he didn't make no he didn't he didn't refuse to refuse to he didn't run from it but he said lord is only looking at the blood he's only looking at the blood hey man you have to applaud that blood that's why he wanted the blood of christ of the christ amen is the blood of christ himself to do something amen jesus could have saved himself from the cross jesus when he had all the abilities to save himself on the cross amen michael to come to his rescue for him michael amen he had the ability to do all those things but he had to come down himself and he had to go through it to save you when god created adam oscars could drive a creature and god was looking for the masterpiece but when adam sinned i don't have a picture even god couldn't stop by him all alone was still looking for that masturbation continuation amen joseph came joseph who was the perfect type of christ remember he himself in the flesh you'll remember god himself in the human flesh remember he couldn't stop by him alone and he wanted more liberties on the priesthood he wanted to multiply those masterpieces he to come gave you the free moral agency meant to be able to decide what kappa meant to be able to make your own choices because god doesn't make mistakes god doesn't want to raise up the people from sodom and gomorrh because i killed you all because i made a choice for one of my sons god women even though when you do but when you make bad choices a way to bring you back wine women because when he was praying to when he was praying in john chapter 17 he said father you have given me these people depend on this woman and i have lost none of them that's what it the holy spirit can come to sentence that's what the son has today i had to die to send down the holy spirit to be a personal instructor until you are filled with the holy spirit then you will be my weakness then you'll be able to tell what you have experienced then you'll be able to tell and experience of god amen amen for some reason i'm saying but everything everything that i had in my notes is now what i'm preaching amen i'm just going with what god is telling me to do amen i'll read the prophet when he said that what did he redeem he said that he redeemed your soul from hell amen amen he redeemed and brought back everything that adam lost is amen jesus christ on calvary was your kinsman redeemer that redeemed you from every curse of the devil jesus he amen that's that that that's what the redemption brought to you brought you peace long suffering goodness gentleness [Music] all these things jesus brought to you because he was our kinsmen redeemer he came to the earth he suffered as a man he was it was he was tempted in all matters like we are in his body borah infirmities in in his body to take it away and came down to become king folks so amen let's go to isaiah i'm pretty sure it's 60 uh one i'm not going to question if i can remember well um some reason i can't find it amen let's go isaiah isaiah 59. amen the verse one two three underscores amen he became a man is it this is numb he meant to save us and when he became a man it was to save behold the lord's hand is not short and shortened that it cannot save neither is ear heavy that you cannot hear no la mendo le termene but your iniquities have separated between you and your god and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not here for your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue has muttered uh purify amen the lord the lord's hand is not short to save amen that's why your prayers sometimes can be hurt you see that's why sometimes you pray and it feels like there's nothing going on amen because there is a wall of iniquities that is built between you and god amen there is only one way to break that wall a man is to repent amen there is only one way to break that wall emma needs to repent when you repent the world is broken amen how can you seek god with all our heart when you have something that is bothering you come on nothing to worry about what he does diablo amen he will make you do something and then when you're doing that thing you will feel really good well you can't go to pray right now because you just seen right now so how is my sins going to be forgiven you know i have to talk to him you know i have to ask him to forgive me hey man i have to talk to him and repent wash you and make you clean la vivo vous put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes this is you cease to do evil learn to do then come now um come now with me let us reason together do your sins be escalated they shall be as white as snow he played ensemble amen the only time that we reasoned with someone it's if we have something hard or almost impossible to solve the the the united nations all of them they they come together for a conference conference to find solutions for things amen that will come together and think about how to uh uh uh think about you know wars and and and things that is going on you know how can we seize this thing from happening she says it shows that dude amen that's what the conference is for god is calling you jeff zappell he says come now let us reason together it may come now renee let us

juve zapped amen is calling you come now let us reason together ensemble amen if you're seeing bs call it so we see amen god had conference throughout the entire bible god had conferences throughout the entire bible when adam and eve they seen i don't remember when they did the exact same thing that god told them not to do they lost because i feel like exactly god came down for a conference and the blood was flowing the blood was flowing it meant to show the blood of jesus i mean it's like ruth when you went to when she went to boast when she went amen which is a type of the holy spirit he will cover you with his coat he will cover you with his holy spirit he will give you the holy spirit remember you have to come here amen you have to respond to the call of duty women you have to respond to the call hey man it's like samuel amen god was calling samuel do you happen amen got caught for the first time this time this is god calling you if he called it again he said speak lord jesus for thy servant hey man you have to respond to the call you even of that rich man who said go and invite all those wealthy people to come to my wedding to come to my party and blind people these are virgos oh call everyone that you find sick people and you name it let them come listen living here amen and when those people responded to their calling god together are you looking for forgiveness come let us look at it let come let us reason together you're looking for eternal life come let us reason again you want to be and he says that well brother isaac you have to go to the conference i have a conference tomorrow that i need you to be confident i tell you one thing i'll be telling everybody the night before that conference that i've been invited the i am i'm somebody just amen because the president called me that means that i'm important to jesus amen god is the king is a king of kings he's the lord of lords amen you have to be happy he says let us reason together they don't song that's why he became a son he's a man to save you even he's calling you if zapped yeah let us reason together with ensembl amen because us gentiles we're different from the jews some different women their salvation is a collective one there is a number that has been fixed for the unknown politician him and that's why he's calling you that's what the prophet says whenever you read
