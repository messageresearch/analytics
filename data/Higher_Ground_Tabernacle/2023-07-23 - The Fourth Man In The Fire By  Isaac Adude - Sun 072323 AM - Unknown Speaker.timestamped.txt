[31:21] amen and we're so happy to be here
[31:24] in God's presence this morning Amanda
[31:29] to serve him to worship Him
[31:34] [Music]
[31:39] let's let's go straight to the word
[31:44] take out Bibles and turn to Isaiah
[31:47] chapter 41 13. foreign
[32:18] even the Bible says therefore I the Lord
[32:20] thy God will hold thy right hand saying
[32:24] unto thee fear not I will help thee now
[32:27] baby
[32:29] fortified
[32:34] they may not read it again
[32:36] for I the Lord thy God will hold thy
[32:39] right hand saying unto thee fear not I
[32:42] will help them
[32:50] amen that's all I need for my walk
[32:56] that God is telling me not to fear
[33:01] amen he will hold my right hand
[33:04] watch and it will always be there to
[33:07] help me
[33:08] amen so every day even if you can just
[33:11] keep on thinking that God will always be
[33:13] there to help Allah
[33:18] you won't have to worry about anything
[33:22] let's go to uh Daniel chapter three
[33:29] uh we read the verse 24 to 26.
[33:37] amen it's a familiar story
[33:41] Familiar of the three Hebrews that they
[33:44] did with children
[33:47] amen Daniel chapter 3 verse 24 to 26.
[33:51] Daniel chapter 12 verses the Bible says
[33:55] and these three men Shadrach Meshach and
[33:58] Abednego fell down and bound into the
[34:01] midst of fire of the burning fiery
[34:03] furnace
[34:17] then Nebuchadnezzar the King was
[34:19] astonished uh was astonished and Rose up
[34:24] in haste and spake and said unto the
[34:26] counselor did not did not we cast three
[34:29] men bound into the midst of the fire
[34:31] they answered and said unto the king
[34:34] true O King
[34:39] precipitation is
[34:50] four men loose walking in the midst of
[34:54] the fire and they have no hurt and the
[34:57] form of the fourth man is like the Son
[35:00] of God is
[35:10] the Jew then the king came near to the
[35:14] mouth of the burning fire furnace and
[35:16] spake and say Shadrach Meshach and
[35:18] Abednego you Servants of the most high
[35:21] God come forth and come hither than
[35:24] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego came forth
[35:27] of the midst of the fire ensuite
[35:32] foreign
[35:59] and delivered his servant that trusted
[36:03] that trusted in him and have changed the
[36:06] king's word and yielded their bodies
[36:09] that they might not serve nor worship
[36:12] any God except their own God
[36:16] foreign
[37:16] to all our questions
[37:20] may you provide to all our needs this
[37:23] morning
[37:25] we are the people in need
[37:31] second the new I Am Lord we pray father
[37:34] God that you the providers
[37:42] know that you may reach to every one of
[37:45] us could you please
[37:46] and speak personally
[37:49] Lord I pray father God that you help me
[37:52] to be successful
[37:56] Lord so that father God I can say
[37:58] whatever you want me to say
[38:00] Lord we thank you in Jesus Christ
[38:05] amen amen you may be seated
[38:08] this morning we have a little subject
[38:10] that we wanted to share with you
[38:14] that we're entitled The Fourth Man in
[38:16] the
[39:15] in person and so you see that this
[39:18] people there's three kids
[39:21] they had to stand for God
[39:24] Amen they had a challenge a test that
[39:26] was in front of them is
[39:28] the king asked them to uh uh uh about
[39:31] but you know to uh worship that statue
[39:38] amen by the student for God man you
[39:42] didn't want to worship anybody else
[39:45] you don't want to have any other God you
[39:47] know
[39:48] amen because they only had one God that
[39:50] they were serving
[39:52] so the king commanded
[39:56] that the fire will be headed up seven
[39:58] times harder than it was
[40:02] fire was already hot
[40:05] because of the answer that they give to
[40:08] the king
[40:10] the king got frustrated
[40:13] amen and asked that the fire be heated
[40:15] up seven times
[40:26] I just noticed it this morning when I
[40:29] was reading it is
[40:32] the king asked them those to the
[40:35] soldiers to cast them in the fire
[40:39] I noticed that the Bible says that they
[40:42] were all bounds
[40:44] so to cast them in the fire
[40:47] amen you will not see I mean it doesn't
[40:50] make it didn't make sense to me to see
[40:52] that the soldiers
[41:01] because danger was in front of them
[41:04] the fire was so hot
[41:07] so the only scenario that I could come
[41:09] up with hello
[41:12] the soldiers will be behind the three
[41:16] I tried to push them in the fire
[41:20] that's what the Bible says the Bible
[41:23] says that before they even went to that
[41:25] fire Library
[41:29] killed the soldiers that were pushing
[41:31] themselves
[41:39] the fire jumped that he jumped
[41:42] amen and killed the people that were
[41:45] pushing them to them
[41:47] and left those three living
[41:51] to me that God means that God was with
[41:54] them before they even said
[41:58] the presence of God was already there
[42:01] before they got into that fire
[42:05] he says that I will be with you
[42:08] man I will always be with you
[42:11] amen here we say that for I the Lord
[42:15] amen God said that I will hold that
[42:18] right hand
[42:20] I will help you amen so God was with
[42:24] them before they even went to that far
[42:26] hello
[42:28] amen but now they've got to that fire
[42:31] amen I asked myself that question
[42:34] amen did God really had to come down to
[42:37] be in that fire with them
[42:41] only speak the word and that fire will
[42:43] be quiet
[42:45] God that praised his presence could just
[42:48] continue with being with them
