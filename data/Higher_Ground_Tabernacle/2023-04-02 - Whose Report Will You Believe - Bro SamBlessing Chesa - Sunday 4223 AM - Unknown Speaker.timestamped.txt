[1:07:22] Isaiah chapter 36 and verse 1.
[1:07:27] now it came to pass in the 14th year of
[1:07:30] King Hezekiah
[1:07:31] that Seneca Rib King of Assyria came up
[1:07:34] against all the defense uh cities of
[1:07:36] Judah and took them
[1:07:46] let us go to Isaiah chapter 37 verse 11.
[1:07:49] how long is Egypt
[1:07:57] the first verse that we read
[1:08:01] King of Assyria is
[1:08:05] he had come to attack Israel
[1:08:09] and he took over Judah yeah
[1:08:14] and the king of Judah Hezekiah
[1:08:19] um
[1:08:20] he had nothing to do in American Affair
[1:08:23] he was scared either people because they
[1:08:26] were under an attack
[1:08:28] from Assyria
[1:08:31] king of Assyria
[1:08:35] he sent a letter to King Hezekiah on
[1:08:39] foreign
[1:08:40] threatening him
[1:08:43] telling him what he was going to do to
[1:08:45] him
[1:08:47] that's in verse 11.
[1:08:50] the letter says
[1:08:53] behold thou has heard what the kings of
[1:08:55] Assyria have done to all lands by
[1:08:58] destroying them utterly and shall thou
[1:09:00] be delivered
[1:09:02] please
[1:09:08] have the gods of the Nations delivered
[1:09:11] them which my fathers have destroyed as
[1:09:14] gozan and Heron and the razav and the
[1:09:17] children of Eden which were in telasa
[1:09:28] where is the king of Hemet
[1:09:30] and the king of Alfred and the king of
[1:09:33] the city of Hina and Iva
[1:09:37] us diva
[1:09:44] and Hezekiah received the letter from
[1:09:46] the hand of The Messengers
[1:09:48] and read it
[1:09:50] is
[1:09:55] we can take our seats we'll continue
[1:09:56] once we are seated
[1:09:59] in the scriptures we are reading it is
[1:10:08] he wrote a letter and gave it to
[1:10:10] Hezekiah is
[1:10:13] a guess and he says all the cities that
[1:10:17] we have destroyed
[1:10:19] and he named each and every one of them
[1:10:24] and he says these ones they could not
[1:10:26] overcome us
[1:10:29] and Hezekiah knew of these is
[1:10:33] and uh sinach group said what I have
[1:10:36] done unto them
[1:10:38] that's what I'm coming to do to you is
[1:10:42] and he had a Written Letter yeah it was
[1:10:46] not a lie it was true
[1:10:48] but Hezekiah knew that he was a son of
[1:10:54] abrahamas Hallelujah he knew that he was
[1:10:57] tied into a covenant
[1:11:00] that Abraham God that God gave to
[1:11:03] Abraham
[1:11:04] Abraham the Covenant was unconditional
[1:11:09] you see God made conditional covenants
[1:11:12] with men before
[1:11:15] but men always failed
[1:11:18] so when God came to Abraham
[1:11:22] he says this Con Covenant is
[1:11:25] unconditional
[1:11:27] conditional it's not what you do it's a
[1:11:30] passport because the men always fail
[1:11:32] because
[1:11:33] but it is what I'm going to do it
[1:11:37] doesn't matter if you come through or
[1:11:38] you don't come through
[1:11:40] I will hold on to my covenants
[1:11:45] die seed shall possess the gates of the
[1:11:48] enemies
[1:11:52] that Covenant was for Abraham and all
[1:11:55] his seed that came after him
[1:12:00] that's why he was able to go after lot
[1:12:02] and kill those Ten Kings and redeem his
[1:12:05] brother back
[1:12:10] he was under that Covenant with God
[1:12:14] and everyone that came after Abraham
[1:12:17] was under that Covenant
[1:12:20] if they would call God to say God come
[1:12:23] to your Covenant
[1:12:25] God will always come through
[1:12:28] and this morning if you are saved by the
[1:12:32] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:13:25] he was being overcome by a kid
[1:13:30] by hands of
[1:14:04] received the letter from the hand of The
[1:14:06] Messengers and read it
[1:14:10] and Hezekiah went up into the house of
[1:14:12] the Lord and spread it before the Lord
[1:14:18] and here's the car prayed unto the Lord
[1:14:20] saying
[1:14:22] oh lord of hosts
[1:14:25] God of Israel that dwells between the
[1:14:29] cherubimes
[1:14:31] Thou Art the god
[1:14:34] even thou alone
[1:14:38] of all the kingdoms of the earth thou
[1:14:40] has made Heaven and Earth
[1:14:43] is
[1:15:01] which had sent to reproach the Living
[1:15:03] God
[1:15:06] it says this is not a lie
[1:15:09] but of a truth Lord the kings of Assyria
[1:15:12] have laid waste all the nations
[1:15:17] and their countries
[1:15:20] and have cast their gods Into the Fire
[1:15:24] for they were not Gods but the work of
[1:15:27] men's hands
[1:15:31] wood and stone therefore they have
[1:15:33] destroyed them is
[1:15:38] was not praying to a god of wood
[1:15:42] you remember the promise of God
[1:15:46] that says if my people who are called by
[1:15:49] my name
[1:15:52] if they humble themselves and pray
[1:15:55] he says I will hear from Heaven
[1:15:58] not only will he hear and remain dumb
[1:16:01] person
[1:16:02] but he will hear and answer that prayer
[1:16:07] and verse 20 he says now therefore O
[1:16:10] Lord Our God
[1:16:13] save us from his hand
[1:16:16] that all the kingdoms of the earth may
[1:16:19] know that thou art the Lord
[1:16:23] even now only it was serve amen I'm
[1:16:27] speaking on whose report will you
[1:16:29] believe
[1:16:33] Hezekiah had two reports one
[1:16:38] from the Covenant with God
[1:16:41] and one with the Covenant from the one
[1:16:44] with the letter from sinach is
[1:16:48] saying what's true
[1:16:51] what God Said was true
[1:16:54] and he had to make a choice
[1:16:57] say whose report am I going to believe
[1:16:59] this morning
[1:17:04] you and I we have to come to a point
[1:17:07] where we make that choice
[1:17:10] when you have the doctor's report
[1:17:15] that says you are sick
[1:17:17] and you have the report from God
[1:17:21] that says you've been made whole that
[1:17:24] says by my stripes I have healed you
[1:17:30] have to choose
[1:17:32] which report to believe
[1:17:37] and you you have to Satan can bring you
[1:17:40] a report of Trials
[1:17:43] something that is true that you are
[1:17:45] going through
[1:17:47] and then there is God's report he loves
[1:17:51] which says many other afflictions of the
[1:17:54] righteous
[1:17:59] it doesn't end there it says but God
[1:18:02] delivered out of some of them
[1:18:06] not out of some of them but out of them
[1:18:10] does not matter what it is
[1:18:13] when you call God on the scene on his
[1:18:15] Covenant
[1:18:18] he has to come through
[1:18:21] whose report will you believe
[1:18:25] verse 33
[1:18:29] deaf and Isaiah came back with a word
[1:18:33] from the Lord
[1:18:37] 37 verse 33 says therefore that says the
[1:18:40] Lord concerning the king of Assyria
[1:18:44] he shall not come into this city
[1:18:47] nor should an arrow there no come before
[1:18:50] it with shields
[1:18:56] no cast a bank against it
[1:19:00] by the way that he came by the same
[1:19:02] shall he returned
[1:19:06] and shall not come into this city says
[1:19:09] the Lord
[1:19:11] in another verse the Bible says that the
[1:19:14] enemy comes in one way and he flees in
[1:19:16] seven ways
[1:19:20] that's what happens when God is standing
[1:19:23] for you
[1:19:25] verse 35 the verse for I will defend
[1:19:28] this city
[1:19:30] to save it for mine own sake
[1:19:35] and for my servant David
[1:20:02] why because
[1:20:05] decided
[1:20:07] he chose to believe the report of the
[1:20:10] Lord
[1:20:12] he counted what sennache has said as a
[1:20:15] lying vanity
[1:20:18] it doesn't matter all these Kings
[1:20:23] but when you come to me
[1:20:26] I'm an exception exception because I'm a
[1:20:29] Child of God
[1:20:30] because I am of the Seed of Abraham
[1:20:34] brother sister if you are a Seed of
[1:20:36] Abraham
[1:20:38] you are an exception
[1:20:40] Satan can come to you with a report
[1:20:44] and say this person said person had
[1:20:49] depression
[1:20:50] they lost their minds
[1:20:53] this person had anxiety
[1:20:56] and look at where they are at now
[1:21:00] you can stand and you say I am an
[1:21:03] exception
[1:21:05] I am a child of Abraham
[1:21:08] exception means what happens to others
[1:21:11] does not happen to you
[1:21:13] so you can say it doesn't matter even if
[1:21:16] there is evidence that it happened to
[1:21:18] all of them
[1:21:21] when it comes to me I'm Different
[1:21:24] amen because I am a son of God
[1:21:29] Hezekiah refused to be counted in all of
[1:21:31] these other failures
[1:21:36] he was under the Covenant of
[1:21:38] circumcision
[1:21:40] and that Covenant is Italians kept him
[1:21:44] Victorious
[1:21:45] you and me we are under the Covenant of
[1:21:48] circumcision
[1:21:52] in the New Testament the Covenant of
[1:21:54] circumcision is receiving the holy
[1:21:56] ghosts
[1:21:59] when you receive the Holy Ghost you are
[1:22:01] under that Covenant
[1:22:04] so you have to a right to refuse to be
[1:22:07] one of those failures
[1:22:12] you have to refuse to say whatever
[1:22:14] happened to them does not happen to me
[1:22:20] we serve a god of Precedence
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:23:01] that example will help you solve your
[1:23:04] situation this is the example
[1:23:06] so if you are in a predicament
[1:23:10] look back into the word of God
[1:23:13] and say Lord you did this before
[1:23:17] I know you can do it again
[1:23:20] you can't do it for me Hallelujah
[1:23:23] because I I am an exception exception he
[1:23:28] made an exception for Sarah
[1:23:30] is well known that women that are 90
[1:23:33] years old they cannot give birth
[1:23:38] but because Sarah was in the Covenant
[1:23:41] with Abraham
[1:23:43] God made an exception and he gave her a
[1:23:48] baby baby when Rebecca came
[1:23:52] Rebecca was also Barren to because
[1:23:55] um
[1:23:57] she couldn't give birth everybody songs
[1:24:00] when Rachel came
[1:24:54] the three Hebrew boys were thrown in the
[1:24:57] fiery furnace
[1:25:00] we've never heard of things not burning
[1:25:02] when they are thrown in fire
[1:25:06] but when the three Hebrew boys are
[1:25:08] thrown in the fairness
[1:25:11] they came out without even a single hair
[1:25:13] burn
[1:25:15] something something
[1:25:17] we made an exception
[1:25:19] and if you call on the Lord of
[1:25:22] presidents
[1:25:23] you say if you did it for Sarah
[1:25:26] you can do it for me if you did it for
[1:25:30] Rebecca and Rachel
[1:25:32] you can't do it for me
[1:25:34] if you did it for Joshua you can do the
[1:25:38] same thing for me if you did it for
[1:25:41] Daniel the three Hebrew boys you can do
[1:25:45] the same thing for me
[1:25:47] Lazarus was dead for four days
[1:25:51] she was already rotten
[1:25:54] but when Jesus came on the scene
[1:25:57] he made an exception he called him out
[1:26:00] of that grave
[1:26:05] he can do the same thing for you
[1:26:08] whatever you've been dealing with it
[1:26:10] doesn't matter how dead it is
[1:26:16] he will come through
[1:26:18] because if he did it before
[1:26:21] he can't do it again Hallelujah
[1:26:28] Satan never tells the truth
[1:26:31] any report you get from Satan is not
[1:26:34] true
[1:26:36] it does not matter how factual it looks
[1:26:39] like
[1:26:42] Satan has no ability he cannot tell the
[1:26:46] truth
[1:26:48] his nature is to lie
[1:26:52] so whatever Satan tells you
[1:26:55] the opposite is true
[1:26:58] when he tells you you're not a Christian
[1:27:01] you say I am a Christian when he tells
[1:27:04] you you're not an overcomer you say I am
[1:27:07] a boy
[1:27:08] because he has no ability to tell the
[1:27:11] truth
[1:27:14] so everything every report he gives you
[1:27:17] it's a lie the opposite it's true
[1:27:25] let's read this quote in expectations of
[1:27:27] paragraph 30. of
[1:27:33] expectations
[1:27:36] it says
[1:27:38] what if someone came up in the morning
[1:27:40] to your door they may seek a company
[1:27:44] an Express agent
[1:27:47] and throwed a whole basket full of
[1:27:50] rattle snacks
[1:27:54] and had your name on them and said here
[1:27:57] they are they are yours
[1:28:04] just like you know your symptoms are
[1:28:07] there

[1:28:24] not misspelled but exactly as how you
[1:28:28] are called
[1:28:29] you have a right to say this package
[1:28:33] that you have sent me
[1:28:36] this is not mine
[1:28:38] it might have my name on it but I'm not
[1:28:42] going to sign for it
[1:28:45] you know they're there just like you
[1:28:49] know your symptoms is there for symptoms
[1:28:51] if you receive them they are yours
[1:28:54] but you don't have to take them
[1:28:57] you can say I don't want them
[1:29:00] and he can say your names on them
[1:29:04] you say I don't want them I won't have
[1:29:07] them
[1:29:09] he can stand there and argue as much as
[1:29:12] he wants to you tonight
[1:29:14] but until you take them and sign for
[1:29:17] them
[1:29:19] they belong to the express company
[1:29:25] until you sign for them
[1:29:28] don't sign for nothing the devil brings
[1:29:33] you say there it is
[1:29:36] though I refuse to have it
[1:29:39] that's right take it back
[1:29:43] have nothing to do with
[1:29:47] if you won't testify that you've got it
[1:29:53] when you testify you still have your
[1:29:55] sickness
[1:29:57] the devil keeps it with you
[1:30:00] but you refuse to testify
[1:30:03] and say I won't have it no sir
[1:30:07] you go to the hospital
[1:30:10] the doctor gives you a diagnosis
[1:30:19] do not accept it that's a false report
[1:30:23] from the devil and foreign Hallelujah
[1:30:39] refuse the devil's report amen
[1:30:45] and God is always reminding us
[1:30:49] what he wants us to be
[1:30:52] and how he sees us
[1:30:55] he calls us a chosen generation
[1:30:58] he calls that set aside in Japan
[1:31:02] he calls us above and not beneath
[1:31:07] the lender not the borrower
[1:31:13] Royal peculiar the on purpose special
[1:31:16] Royal why does God keep on repeating all
[1:31:20] these things
[1:31:22] he is repeating us so we can know
[1:31:27] what he calls us
[1:31:29] when you know what God calls you to be
[1:31:32] yes
[1:31:34] you have to accept that for yourself
[1:31:38] it does not matter how much God calls
[1:31:41] you a more than a conqueror foreign
[1:31:45] matter how much he calls you the lender
[1:31:47] not the borrower
[1:31:52] if you do not accept it for yourself
[1:31:56] it ain't happening
[1:31:58] hey man cause you have to accept what
[1:32:02] the word is saying about you
[1:32:06] and many times we lose on promises
[1:32:10] we lose on God's promises because we
[1:32:12] don't accept that word for ourselves
[1:32:18] that's why God in his word is constantly
[1:32:21] reminding us
[1:32:23] pointing us to the word
[1:32:26] hey man
[1:32:29] let's go to Numbers Chapter 13 and verse
[1:32:32] 1.
[1:32:33] [Music]
[1:32:36] this is when uh
[1:32:38] God told the children of Israel to go
[1:32:41] over and take over in Canada
[1:32:46] and the Lord speak of Moses saying he
[1:32:50] is on
[1:32:52] and thou men that they may search the
[1:32:54] land of Canaan over the zombies
[1:32:58] which have which I gave unto the
[1:33:01] children of Israel
[1:33:03] of every tribe of their father shall you
[1:33:06] send a man everyone a ruler among them
[1:33:12] when the children of Israel left Egypt
[1:33:17] they were given a Promised Land
[1:33:20] here they were just before crossing over
[1:33:24] and Moses sent out these 12 Spies
[1:33:30] the promise of God said the land is
[1:33:33] yours
[1:33:35] you go and take it
[1:33:40] and we all know the story
[1:33:43] ten spies came with a different report
[1:33:45] this is
[1:33:47] the other two Joshua and Caleb came with
[1:33:50] a different reports
[1:33:52] let's go to verse 27
[1:33:56] um
[1:33:57] and they've told him and said
[1:34:01] we came unto the land with the thou
[1:34:04] sentestas
[1:34:08] and surely it flowed with milk and honey
[1:34:13] and this is the fruit of it
[1:34:17] they brought back the evidence of the
[1:34:19] land is
[1:34:22] the grapes
[1:34:25] everything that God has said in his word
[1:34:29] they believed it is
[1:34:33] verse 28 says nevertheless
[1:34:36] the people be strong that dwell in the
[1:34:39] land
[1:34:42] and the cities are World reveal some
[1:34:45] fortifier and very great
[1:34:48] and moreover we saw the children of anak
[1:34:51] there news
[1:34:55] before I used to think that the 10 spies
[1:34:58] did not believe the word of God advance
[1:35:02] but when I read this again
[1:35:05] they believed it and they said for sure
[1:35:09] the land is there it flows with milk and
[1:35:12] honey
[1:35:18] they did not dispute what the promise of
[1:35:21] God said
[1:35:23] we go to verse 33 she was a little uh
[1:35:27] and here is what they say and there we
[1:35:31] saw the Giants
[1:35:32] the sons of Enoch on which come of the
[1:35:36] Giants
[1:35:37] and we were in our own sight as
[1:35:40] Grasshoppers
[1:35:43] and so we were in their side
[1:35:46] where did they get grasshoppers from
[1:35:48] come on
[1:35:52] they believe the promise of God
[1:35:56] but Satan added just one more element
[1:36:00] and they started seeing grasshoppers in
[1:36:03] this promise
[1:36:05] and they started seeing themselves as
[1:36:08] grasshoppers
[1:36:10] God never said you are grasshoppers
[1:36:29] hey man God had already told them that
[1:36:31] they are conquerors they're going to be
[1:36:33] Victorious and take it
[1:36:36] I am already What God Says I Am
[1:36:39] that's what you gotta say for yourself
[1:36:43] take God on his word
[1:36:45] he says you are going to get it
[1:36:49] claim that land
[1:36:51] claim that promise it doesn't matter how
[1:36:55] you you think you are not able to do it
[1:36:59] don't look at your own insecurities
[1:37:03] don't look at what you are not able to
[1:37:06] do
[1:37:07] you are not the one who gave the promise
[1:37:11] God is the one who gave the promise
[1:37:14] so he is responsible for making that
[1:37:17] promise come to pass
[1:37:20] when he told Abraham and Sarah that
[1:37:23] you're going to have a baby
[1:37:25] they were old and unable to conceived
[1:37:29] but they did not worry to see how is
[1:37:32] this going to happen Mississippi
[1:37:35] they were not responsible for the
[1:37:37] transformation of their bodies
[1:37:41] they just believed and stood on God's
[1:37:44] word
[1:37:47] so when God gives you your destiny
[1:37:51] when God gives you a promise
[1:37:54] stand on that promise and say Lord I'm
[1:37:58] calling you on the scene it is
[1:38:00] a fixed fight
[1:38:03] all you just have to do is show up and
[1:38:06] fight
[1:38:08] the victory is already yours
[1:38:11] so that's why Satan always tries to make
[1:38:14] sure we see the word he misconstrues the
[1:38:17] word to us
[1:38:22] the same thing he did with Eve
[1:38:26] he did not take away what God said
[1:38:30] he just added not enough
[1:38:33] and they forfeited the promise of God he
[1:38:37] is
[1:38:38] with these 10 spies
[1:38:41] he just introduced a grasshopper into
[1:38:43] the promise
[1:38:45] and they were ready to let go I said we
[1:38:49] cannot do this
[1:38:51] but we have someone like Jacob and like
[1:38:54] Joshua and Caleb means
[1:38:56] who can say God said so
[1:39:00] this is it doesn't matter how many
[1:39:04] Giants are in the land
[1:39:05] we are going to go and claim it
[1:39:09] and the word became flesh of 1954
[1:39:13] foreign
[1:40:11] so if the Bible says let a mind that was
[1:40:13] in Christ being you I don't see that
[1:40:15] being ridiculous because
[1:40:21] when you take that mind that was in
[1:40:24] Christ
[1:40:26] and you put it in your heart
[1:40:30] and you think
[1:40:36] it will bring all of God's promises to
[1:40:39] pass
[1:40:41] amen paragraph 178 backups songs or
[1:40:45] something it says now if that same
[1:40:47] spirit that says Let There be like let's
[1:40:50] go remember is
[1:40:55] this it says Let There Be trees
[1:40:59] and there were trees
[1:41:01] and if that same mind that was in Christ
[1:41:04] being you is
[1:41:07] how much could it say let there be no
[1:41:10] cancer
[1:41:13] and it will be gone
[1:41:15] let the blind eyes
[1:41:18] and it will be so you know it's your
[1:41:22] thoughts so he took the thought that was
[1:41:24] in Christ
[1:41:26] you put it in yourself and you start
[1:41:29] speaking like Christ
[1:41:30] it helps to produce the exact
[1:41:52] things have to happen
[1:41:55] because you are calling on the Covenant
[1:41:58] God
[1:42:00] before we have to do to you if you did
[1:42:05] it in the beginning
[1:42:10] he did it the same thing with Jesus as
[1:42:13] well
[1:42:15] he's going to do the same thing to you
[1:42:17] too
[1:42:18] because it's that same mind that was in
[1:42:21] Christ
[1:42:22] in the exposition of the seven Church
[1:42:25] ages
[1:42:27] he says he is the word
[1:42:30] so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man
[1:42:34] in faith is
[1:42:38] um
[1:42:39] takes that word into his heart
[1:42:43] and places it onto his lips
[1:42:47] why that is the same as deity speaking
[1:42:51] amen
[1:42:54] Every Mountain has to go
[1:42:58] Satan cannot stand before that man
[1:43:02] I love that it is the same as dear to
[1:43:07] speaking
[1:43:09] because you took the mind that was in
[1:43:11] Christ
[1:43:14] you put it onto your
[1:44:12] you said the word of God
[1:44:15] face it is the same as deity speaking it
[1:44:18] is
[1:44:19] when you speak things have to happen
[1:44:23] Satan cannot stand before
[1:44:26] so it all depends you taking God and his
[1:44:30] word
[1:44:32] and putting it in your heart
[1:44:35] what you think of yourself is
[1:44:38] what you will be
[1:44:41] so Satan that's why he's always trying
[1:44:43] to change what you think about yourself
[1:44:47] that's always his technique
[1:44:50] brings the word
[1:44:52] um
[1:44:53] amen
[1:45:24] [Music]
[1:45:32] [Music]
[1:45:34] when you are sitting in your seat allows
[1:45:37] it is you can't see some things certain
[1:45:41] shows
[1:45:42] the brother who seated to this extreme
[1:45:44] left
[1:45:46] he cannot see this microphone
[1:45:50] because of where he is seated
[1:45:56] perspective but when you sit in the
[1:45:59] right spot
[1:46:02] you'll be able to see clearly
[1:46:06] so the Bible told us that let the mind
[1:46:08] that was in Christ be in you Allah
[1:46:12] so you stop thinking like yourself
[1:46:18] stop thinking what the devil wants you
[1:46:21] to think
[1:46:24] and you start thinking what Christ wants
[1:46:26] you to think
[1:46:29] because you will start having the
[1:46:31] perspective that God wants to have for
[1:46:33] your life
[1:46:36] for the calling in your life for your uh
[1:46:39] for your destiny
[1:46:54] when we see towards the hill God sees
[1:46:57] behind the hills
[1:47:00] that's why when Jesus was walking with
[1:47:03] his disciples
[1:47:05] and he got the news that his friend
[1:47:07] Lazarus was dead
[1:47:10] he told them that Lazarus is sleeping
[1:47:16] they had a total different perspective
[1:47:20] to them sleeping he was sleeping
[1:47:25] but to him sleeping was dead and he was
[1:47:28] going to resurrect
[1:47:31] so when you bring yourself to in the
[1:47:34] position where you can see things in
[1:47:37] God's perspective
[1:47:42] evil that'll be able to bring God's word
[1:47:44] to come to pass in your life
[1:47:48] amen amen and numbers 13 verse 30.
[1:47:52] Caleb is still the people before Moses
[1:47:58] let us go up at once
[1:48:01] and possess it for we are able to
[1:48:05] overcome it
[1:48:07] they said God said it is
[1:48:12] it doesn't matter how much our size is
[1:48:14] to those to to the Giants
[1:48:18] God's word is able to protect
[1:48:21] God's word is responsible for my victory
[1:48:26] Hallelujah they remembered God gave
[1:48:29] Abraham a promise
[1:48:32] shall possess the Gate of the enemy
[1:48:37] Hallelujah they took God's word if
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:49:02] Hallelujah because it is an inheritance
[1:49:05] to me
[1:49:06] the Bible says all weapons
[1:49:10] to no weapon okay formed against you
[1:49:14] shall prosper foreign
[1:49:47] because God's word says
[1:49:51] [Music]
[1:49:56] [Music]
[1:50:00] you speak it
[1:50:58] he was right there he saw the enemy
[1:51:01] coming
[1:51:02] they had taken all his a harvest he's on
[1:51:05] the tree over and over and over again
[1:51:09] then he stood and he remembered
[1:51:12] I am under a promise of Abraham
[1:51:16] I'm not trying to be a soldier
[1:51:20] I'm just going to take this Ox God
[1:51:26] which was just a little which was just a
[1:51:29] little stick
[1:51:30] and he says I'm going to face the enemy
[1:51:34] it does not matter my training does not
[1:51:36] matter
[1:51:38] God's promise is going to take care of
[1:51:40] me
[1:51:42] brother sister just take that word of
[1:51:44] God
[1:51:46] run into the enemy
[1:51:48] possess your inheritance
[1:51:51] that's what belongs to you
[1:51:54] God will give you that Victory
[1:51:57] it's not you fighting God doing it for
[1:52:02] you
[1:52:04] he says I will be in you even till the
[1:52:06] end of the world
[1:52:08] so if he is doing the fighting he is
[1:52:10] doing it in you and I'll see you know
[1:52:12] some combatants just let go and let God
[1:52:15] look at something we got this Samsung
[1:52:18] Samson had a covenant with God
[1:52:21] his Covenant was so long his hair was
[1:52:24] there
[1:52:25] he was going to overcome all his enemies
[1:52:30] when he was surrounded by the
[1:52:32] Philistines
[1:52:34] and he had no weapon
[1:52:36] he picked up that job
[1:52:42] foreign
[1:52:49] we've never heard of someone fighting
[1:52:52] with a job on and winning numbers
[1:52:57] but because he was standing on the
[1:53:00] Covenant
[1:53:02] he took that job
[1:53:04] and ran into the enemy
[1:53:07] and he killed each and every one of them
[1:53:11] how a dried joban correct at inches of
[1:53:16] of uh of a brass um brass helmet I have
[1:53:20] no idea come on come on
[1:53:26] all I know is God was fighting for him

[1:53:33] of God

[1:53:38] he will never fail you
