[0:00] and not to me only but unto all them
[0:04] also that love is appearing
[0:07] let us pray father we thank you for this
[0:14] evening truly we are unworthy creatures
[0:20] and the more that I see that I am so the
[0:25] more that I see that what you require of
[0:28] us make me see Lord just how
[0:34] insufficient we are without you Lord
[0:38] Jesus Christ where would we be it is
[0:42] total grace Lord that we are able to
[0:45] stand and speak before you let your
[0:48] blood cleanse us from all
[0:50] unrighteousness Lord and forgive us for
[0:53] all of our sins
[0:54] bless the service here this evening
[0:58] we'll be careful to give you the praise
[1:00] glory and honor and Jesus Christ's name
[1:03] we pray amen
[1:04] you may be seated one of the brothers
[1:14] takes me a message on love and having a
[1:21] pure heart I thought it was wonderful
[1:26] because I know that only the pure in
[1:28] heart shall see God and you and I know
[1:34] by God's grace that the Word of God
[1:37] tells us the message of God is the
[1:40] message of love but we must understand
[1:46] tonight that we are in a battle brother
[1:51] Branham tells us that when those flying
[1:56] saucers that they began to see in the
[1:58] early fifties a fifties and sixties one
[2:03] of the things that he said they were in
[2:05] battle formation so
[2:10] when I took that thought and God gave me
[2:16] some thoughts on that because you and I
[2:19] must understand that we are in a battle
[2:25] Paul always he tells us to put on the
[2:28] whole armor of God the thing that is
[2:33] being attacked in this age more than
[2:36] anything is else is love because the
[2:42] devil don't care if you the other areas
[2:45] are not covered but he makes sure you
[2:47] don't get to love love is' god' love is'
[2:55] life i'm not talking about this
[2:59] foolishness that we call love there is
[3:05] the filial love and the agape love and
[3:09] that filial love brother Branham said to
[3:11] get jealous and kill a man over what of
[3:13] his wife but the golfy love is far
[3:17] beyond that here Paul is the angel of
[3:24] the emphasis age and the effort of the
[3:26] age is likened unto the age of
[3:27] perfection Paul preached perfection
[3:32] now that the things that Paul preached
[3:35] on perfection we are now enjoying it
[3:37] we're eating it up so that we will be
[3:39] perfected because we realize that
[3:43] perfection I'm being perfected is a
[3:45] process it is a process of the Holy
[3:49] Spirit but like all victories you cannot
[3:56] have without a battle
[3:58] the battles must come even in the early
[4:03] age though we don't fight against the
[4:07] enemy in which they how they fought
[4:09] against him just for the gospel of Jesus
[4:12] Christ their heads were being
[4:16] decapitated men burn at the stake that
[4:23] Oh
[4:23] horse-rider took own the image of the
[4:26] red horse and he began to splatter blood
[4:30] everywhere but the thing I loved about
[4:33] the early church is that they were not a
[4:35] shame and nor were they afraid they took
[4:38] on their position they they got in their
[4:43] formation and they went to battle it is
[4:47] said in the forest foxes Book of Martyrs
[4:49] that many of the early Saints ran to the
[4:53] Lions they didn't run from him because
[4:57] they recognized that they they had to
[5:00] die and they were willing to die because
[5:03] they had that ox anointing Paul amen
[5:09] when he says I bear in my body the marks
[5:11] of Jesus Christ but he said when the
[5:16] battle is over with one day we would
[5:19] preach the last sermon close the book
[5:22] for it's last time sing the last human
[5:26] pray the last prayer woo the battle will
[5:30] end for me someday
[5:32] the battle will end for you don't have
[5:36] to worry because then we will meet
[5:39] because a day the great High Priest the
[5:42] great High Priest of God our Lord Jesus
[5:46] Christ who will serve us communion sit
[5:52] down at the battle after the battle is
[5:55] over while it is time let us grab them
[5:59] folks let's grab lots and things that we
[6:03] can and try to pull them out of Sodom
[6:06] because we've got to do it I was
[6:11] thinking about
[6:13] message that I I want to be played here
[6:15] and that blushing prophet and when the
[6:26] brother Keith basically shared that
[6:28] message and had been a real blessing to
[6:29] me because it really puts everybody in
[6:35] their place we thank God for our apostle
[6:44] paul paul had a testimony said when he
[6:50] said i fought a good fight hmm
[6:53] i finished my course but this is the
[6:57] greatest part for me i have kept the
[7:00] faith i have kept the faith is that
[7:06] right he said because i have kept the
[7:11] faith there's a crown waiting for me a
[7:15] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[7:17] the righteous judge shall give me at
[7:20] that day Oh may God be blessed tonight
[7:27] and may God grace and mercy be upon us
[7:30] that if we come to the end we should
[7:33] come to the end of our road before the
[7:34] wrap to take place we'll have that
[7:37] testimony that we have kept the faith we
[7:43] are living at a time where God has
[7:45] become history even among the message
[7:50] many people refer back to brother
[7:52] Branham and all the things that he has
[7:53] done that will work because his day is
[7:59] finished he can say to Paul and like he
[8:03] said I have finished the course and I
[8:07] kept the faith but brother Branham a man
[8:12] tells us that we ought to live God out
[8:16] of history we must make him real today
[8:21] see that's what the Prophet did he was
[8:24] able to take God bring him
[8:27] history and we knew the god of history
[8:29] his name is Jesus Christ it was many
[8:34] years later with our text reading
[8:37] tonight and subjects reading he's
[8:40] bringing him out of history and I'm
[8:41] gonna read these things when Elijah has
[8:44] seen the curse of the nation and was up
[8:49] on the mountain and for hundreds of
[8:53] years there have been no prayer answered
[8:57] in Israel can you imagine hundreds of
[9:00] years no prayers answered in Israel yet
[9:07] he lied to knew that there was a God of
[9:09] history that could come on the scene and
[9:14] he challenged the unbelieving world to
[9:17] stand in the presence of this God and
[9:19] see which one would answer by fire I
[9:22] believe we're living in a day like
[9:25] Elijah that the God who that is God let
[9:30] him answer by fire and the God who would
[9:35] protect the Hebrew children from the
[9:38] fiery furnace brought down the fire and
[9:41] consumed the sacrifice it was also not
[9:45] long after that when a man had died by
[9:48] the name of Lazarus and there was a god
[9:52] that still lived
[9:53] that could take Enoch home without even
[9:56] seeing death and yet take Elijah up on a
[10:00] chariot of fire and he was called on the
[10:04] scene in a dark hour of death and he
[10:06] acted the same way he would at any time
[10:09] yet he was God of the history but was
[10:12] raised from up from history to a present
[10:16] crisis you understand me
[10:17] in other words if he raised the dead
[10:20] yesterday he could raise the dead today
[10:24] whatever he did yesterday he can do it
[10:28] today if he can save you from death
[10:32] hallelujah he can raise you from death
[10:37] it was down
[10:39] that at Jericho she what let me back it
[10:43] up some him it was also not long after
[10:47] that when a man dies by the name of
[10:49] Lazarus and there was God that still
[10:53] lived that God could take Enoch home
[10:56] without even seeing death and take
[10:59] Elijah up on a chariot so what I'm
[11:01] saying he said listen death is in the
[11:04] hand of God hallelujah he can allow
[11:08] death to take you he can allow you to
[11:11] scape death hallelujah is that right and
[11:15] if you die he could raise you up it was
[11:20] down by Jericho Gate where a blind man
[11:22] sit by the road crying all hope was gone
[11:26] no doctor could do him any good his
[11:29] money was spent there was nothing left
[11:32] for him but to sit there and dream for a
[11:35] few days till death would be a sweet
[11:38] relief and one day coming down the road
[11:41] a God of history come on the scene in a
[11:46] present crisis see there's one thing we
[11:50] we fail to see it is God who allows the
[11:54] crisis to come into our lives that we
[11:57] may call upon the god of history why
[12:00] because he just doesn't want to be a God
[12:03] of history he wants to be a present help
[12:06] in time of your need hallelujah
[12:08] hallelujah it was in Jerry's house where
[12:18] the doctors had failed and turned that
[12:21] little girl back to die and death had
[12:25] come in and taking it bitter told and
[12:27] had taken the only child to home the
[12:30] little girl of 12 and stretched her out
[12:33] on a couch when a broken hearted little
[12:36] preacher had to forsake his denomination
[12:38] and all of his friends but he remembered
[12:42] that there was a God of history who
[12:45] could raise the dead and he went to find
[12:48] him hello when a crier
[12:52] come you need to go find it seek and ye
[12:56] shall find knock and it opens up unto
[12:59] you ask and it shall be given unto you
[13:02] he is still the same God hallelujah see
[13:07] we must understand that we're not
[13:08] working with an amateur God we're here
[13:12] to battle
[13:13] there's no time to cower down now we
[13:17] don't retreat if it means we get scars
[13:20] praise God we get scars there's nothing
[13:26] like a man who comes out of a war with
[13:28] scars he's got a history of wit
[13:33] whatever battles he fought in how he got
[13:35] this scar and how he got that scar I
[13:37] don't want to get to heaven without a
[13:39] scar when this God dwelling in the body
[13:43] called Jesus son of God when he was
[13:45] called on the scene and called up out of
[13:48] history the God who could raise the dead
[13:50] in the Old Testament brings life back to
[13:53] a dead baby through a prophet that God
[13:57] cannot die He is God for eternity that
[14:02] baby laying there in the bed stretched
[14:04] out and a little Jarius knowing that the
[14:07] shooter might got her baby back was that
[14:10] right in the Old Testament the shooter
[14:13] might got her baby back hallelujah
[14:16] that's what we can look at the Old
[14:17] Testament says Lord you did it for them
[14:20] you can do it for me hallelujah that God
[14:24] of history if he could ever be called
[14:26] into action he's the same God today
[14:29] searching through he had heard of some
[14:32] man man that claimed to have the power
[14:35] and that was Jesus of Nazareth who they
[14:38] all hated but he called him on the scene
[14:42] but he was the closest represent
[14:45] representative he could find of God at
[14:49] that day a God of the Living God
[14:52] and when he was called on the scene and
[14:55] the historical God was called up he
[14:59] acted the same way he did when he spoke
[15:01] to Elijah on the dead baby hallelujah he
[15:05] can't
[15:06] tell you something different if your
[15:08] circumstances are the same he must act
[15:11] in the same way today as he did
[15:14] yesterday is that right let me let me
[15:18] more say today brother his sister in the
[15:22] present day with uh twin crisis and when
[15:27] cancer is setting heating the world up
[15:30] diseases of all kind the same historical
[15:33] God that cleansed the leopard heal the
[15:36] sick raise the dead is the same God
[15:39] today waiting anxiously for his people
[15:44] he said waiting anxiously for his people
[15:48] to call on him or call him on the scene
[15:52] for action hallelujah and when you call
[15:56] on Jesus either so say Jesus you called
[16:04] him like Ryan by the Magus right Oh
[16:07] glory to God Jesus thou son of David
[16:11] hallelujah
[16:12] see you and I must understand that this
[16:15] god of history is not dead he cannot die
[16:17] he's still here and what he wants us to
[16:21] understand that when these angels came
[16:23] down these investigating angels they
[16:26] came down to spy out the land and they
[16:28] came in the formation of war formation
[16:33] of battle hallelujah it meant they would
[16:36] just follow you around but they had
[16:38] order from God go down and I want you to
[16:40] see and check it out now God knows but
[16:45] he plays this drama for his own sake
[16:48] right remember how it was in Egypt a lot
[16:55] of time we think that we go through
[16:57] these trials and God don't see how
[16:59] frictions God sees your future because
[17:03] you could not have them if God didn't
[17:06] let them happen happen like many of
[17:08] affliction of the righteous but God
[17:11] delivered them out of them all
[17:16] Hey and God saw Egypt in the third
[17:20] chapter of Exodus and the Lord said I
[17:23] have surely seen the affliction of my
[17:25] people which are in Egypt and have heard
[17:28] their cry by reason of their taskmasters
[17:31] for I know their sorrow sometimes God
[17:34] can't get our attention until he brains
[17:36] the sorrow and I have come down to
[17:40] deliver them out of the hand of the
[17:42] Egyptians that's what I love about it
[17:43] and I am come down y'all know something
[17:46] can you hear that and I have come down
[17:49] the Bible said that mighty angel
[17:51] descending out of heaven and he put one
[17:53] foot on the land and one on the sea I
[17:55] have come down and when it came down he
[17:58] come for one purpose to deliver us it is
[18:03] a battle we talk about all the demons
[18:06] amen we we basically give more glory to
[18:09] the demons than we do them that the
[18:11] mighty angel hallelujah
[18:14] but that force has no power over us we
[18:17] may stumble we may fall but the Bible
[18:20] said of just man though he falls seven
[18:23] times in a day he gets up we got that
[18:26] get up power hallelujah
[18:30] a man he says and have heard their cry
[18:34] by reason of their taskmasters but I
[18:36] know their sorrow and I'll come down to
[18:39] deliver them out of the hand of the
[18:41] Egyptians and to bring them up out of
[18:43] the land into a good land in a large
[18:45] unto a land flowing with milk and honey
[18:48] and to the place of the Canaanites he
[18:50] dies - Emma rights under the Paradise
[18:52] and the hivite and the jebusite now
[18:55] therefore behold cry of the children of
[18:59] Israel has come unto me so don't thank
[19:03] God don't hear your cry God hear your
[19:06] cry he said they have come down they
[19:09] have come up to me and therefore I have
[19:12] come down let us remember he's still
[19:15] here come now there
[19:23] and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that
[19:25] thou made bring forth my people and the
[19:27] children of Israel out of Egypt Moses
[19:30] says unto god I love this statement
[19:32] Who am I know that feeling
[19:36] ah I know that feeling I have that
[19:40] feeling pretty often Who am I that you
[19:44] would cause me to be a servant of yours
[19:47] in a time like this in the greatest age
[19:51] ever in the greatest battle ever this is
[19:56] the greatest battle because this is the
[19:59] last battle hallelujah that God will
[20:03] call you and I to fight Satan in his own
[20:07] Eden we don't have to worry about
[20:11] whether is going to happen or not it's
[20:14] already because happiness it's been
[20:16] spoken it has been ordained I was in 55
[20:21] 10 through 11 said 4 has a rain coming
[20:23] down in the stove snow from heaven and
[20:26] return it not dinner but water the earth
[20:28] and making it bring forth and bud that
[20:31] it may give seed to the sower and bread
[20:33] to the eater hallelujah you know God is
[20:36] in control all of that if God was hello
[20:40] cease don't you bad don't you bring fall
[20:43] they wouldn't have the power to do so it
[20:46] is God who sees the thirsty seed it is
[20:49] God who waters the seed is that right
[20:52] hallelujah so shall my word be that goes
[20:56] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[21:00] return unto me void but it shall
[21:02] accomplish that which I please and it
[21:05] shall prosper in the things wherein to I
[21:08] sent it hallelujah
[21:10] if you are bride hallelujah you don't
[21:13] have to worry about coming making a
[21:15] hundred you are ordained to make a
[21:18] hundred you don't have to worry about
[21:20] amen will quit will I not make it you
[21:23] have been ordained to make it does it
[21:26] mean you gonna say scape fights and
[21:28] battles no sure God has placed us in the
[21:31] heat of the battle let me tell you some
[21:34] of the greatest battle ever
[21:35] is in your mind every thought is a
[21:38] spirit is either the Spirit of God or
[21:40] the spirit of the devil
[21:42] hallelujah and the Bible said girdle up
[21:45] the loins of your mind
[21:46] hallelujah got to recognize who you are
[21:49] in order to fight this battle you must
[21:52] know you are on the Lord's side
[21:54] hallelujah whose side are you on tonight
[21:57] you are on the Lord's side and as long
[22:00] as you can remember that and keep that
[22:02] in your heart you'll have the strength
[22:04] to fight you're here the strength to get
[22:06] up you'll know that you are a winner
[22:09] because Paul said we're more than
[22:11] compass through Christ Jesus how come
[22:15] brother Brahim gives us a victory you
[22:17] didn't know it you don't own it he gives
[22:21] us a victory that's why when the battle
[22:25] is over
[22:26] they take those crowns and they throw
[22:28] now they realize God gave them the
[22:31] victory hallelujah like you must
[22:35] understand your seat is already at the
[22:37] table there's a name on it
[22:40] hallelujah got your name only not
[22:43] somebody else's your name somebody

[23:03] my eyes you and I gonna look back and
[23:05] said it's worth it all it was worth it
[23:08] all amen listen when we don't we don't
[23:13] mention our flying saucers and things of
[23:17] that nature

[23:22] news or whatever and and they were
[23:24] showing the Arctic and how it's making

[24:10] setting the stage up for the battle for
[24:13] the last final battle it is the stage
[24:19] being set up it's got to start somewhere
[24:23] hallelujah we wouldn't have known we
[24:25] were in the chapter of Revelation 13 had
[24:28] another prophet told us hallelujah we

[24:56] ups and downs and the powers that were
[24:58] rising and falling was ordained by God
[25:01] every bit of it
[25:03] and every one of them had to do what God
[25:06] wanted them to do what was he doing
[25:08] setting the stage hallelujah at the same
[25:14] time he was bringing judgment to Israel
[25:16] for failing to keep the word 70 years

[26:43] worth it all so how you fall sometimes
[26:46] soldier come some short sometime we all
[26:49] do
[26:49] hallelujah but God Grace has been given
[26:53] to us you said what do you mean brother
[26:55] I am favored and so are you is that
[27:02] right that's what he said hallelujah
[27:04] Esther was favored and let me tell you
[27:12] something when it comes to getting to
[27:14] the king you must sometimes break some
[27:18] laws he said what do you mean Oh church
[27:22] or the laws it's not it's not lawful for
[27:27] you to do this without being summoned
[27:29] she says oh but if my parents let me
[27:32] perish I'm going to see the King see God
[27:35] will put press on you to see whether
[27:38] you'd be willing to be led by his spirit
[27:40] or led by the law man's Creed's and
[27:45] dogmas is what I'm speaking of not God's
[27:47] Word he said you see in the papers the
[27:51] other day where they required science
[27:53] requiring science the Pentagon to answer
[27:57] the flying saucers it was a myth it was
[28:01] something it imagined it was
[28:03] it was an intelligent they flew the
[28:07] battle they flew in battle formation
[28:11] they could stop they could start they
[28:14] could stop they could tell it was an
[28:17] intelligence they know it that people
[28:20] laughs they said flying saucers made fun
[28:23] out of it
[28:24] hallelujah and even if you tell people
[28:27] it was greater than that it wasn't just
[28:31] some scientific some people from another
[28:35] planet or from another world
[28:36] it meant discovering that there is life
[28:38] on this planet - but we're more superior
[28:41] hallelujah it was literally a joke
[28:46] investigating angels hallelujah in a
[28:51] flying formation hallelujah you say Oh
[28:54] what are you saying we're coming back in
[28:56] the formation - the Bible said we're
[28:58] coming back it meant riding white horses

[29:07] we go to heaven we come back down amen
[29:08] spent a thousand years on the earth and

[29:36] the devil is hitting more he's hitting
[29:39] that area more than anything sex affair
[29:42] they were destroyed because of their sex
[29:45] affair hallelujah

[29:50] angels had to come to the earth in the
[29:52] last few days they've been seen among
[29:54] the people I mean on his blood washed
[29:57] people who noted they've even stood and
[30:00] had their pictures taken that's right

[30:58] just make it so we don't have the kind
[31:01] of intelligence hmm we're sure we don't

[31:07] to have where we gonna take out the
[31:09] sources are you know the Indians that
[31:11] lived in this country and all these
[31:13] other countries that did build all this

[31:17] what happened in an illusion day you
[31:20] know history repeats itself if you if
[31:23] you think you could outsmart God by
[31:25] science investigating angels that right
[31:29] June says 1827 the Lord said because the
[31:33] cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and
[31:34] because their sin is very Grievous I

[34:36] war and you heard me last Sunday you
[34:40] know the first voice to Eve after Adam
[34:44] was a serpent
[34:46] right and it is war
[34:50] she didn't realize she was in a war but
[34:53] the war had been initiated in heaven the
[34:56] Lucifer come down and places himself in
[34:58] the serpent disguise himself because you
[35:00] know the devil ain't gonna come to you
[35:01] says I'm the devil go pick that up for
[35:04] me and you know what if he said that you
[35:06] say you pick it up yourself you got
[35:08] hands but anyway my point is this it was
[35:12] there the battle began to rage and every
[35:15] since then it's increased you know and I
[35:20] know that the mind battles that we're
[35:22] having now is 100 or 1 to 10 I don't
[35:28] know how you want to say it but a few
[35:30] years ago we didn't have this and every
[35:35] year since I've been saying
[35:36] I remember you get a trial brother
[35:38] every now and again a testicle
[35:42] now is every day like God is like Joe
[35:45] before one tell finish telling the other
[35:48] I start their story somebody else is
[35:50] coming god is good to us anyhow he keeps
[36:02] his peace he gives us peace right
[36:06] Genesis 15 12 to 20 says and when the
[36:08] Sun was going going down now I want to
[36:11] say this to you because a lot of time we
[36:13] fail to see even though we in battle is
[36:15] the Lord's battle right but he has to
[36:19] give you a portion of it so that you can
[36:22] really appreciate heaven you can't go to
[36:25] heaven on a flowery bed of these doing
[36:28] all those saints in Smyrna and all the
[36:30] way up a being lost their lives and
[36:31] everything else and here we are in this
[36:34] Laodicea and I mean Laodicea and it's a
[36:39] time that you and I are fighting right
[36:41] now I don't know about y'all but I am
[36:43] fighting trying to keep on fire I hate
[36:49] the state of lukewarm yes I don't want
[36:54] to be cold and I hate the spate of
[36:56] lukewarmness
[36:57] so you got a fight
[37:00] to stay Oh fire hallelujah and when the
[37:05] Sun was going down a deep sleep fell
[37:08] upon Abram and lower horror of great
[37:11] darkness fell upon him and you know the
[37:14] story how that God let him visit hell if
[37:18] you want to say in his sleep and while
[37:20] he was in his sleep and then he saw this
[37:23] altar he saw pieces being cut up and
[37:25] everything else and then this light that
[37:28] moved between the midst of the of the
[37:33] sacrifice and how God even in Abraham
[37:37] Abraham's sleep before he was even
[37:39] circumcised God comes right around if I
[37:45] could say it like that and show him I
[37:49] put you to rest while I fight your
[37:53] battle Abraham got up and the only thing
[37:58] he had to do is continue to fight those
[38:00] buzzards off those whatever they were
[38:02] and that's what Paul is saying contend
[38:06] for the faith
[38:07] don't let the road bread get a hold of
[38:10] this fight those brothers off and
[38:13] remember it is the sacrifice that gave
[38:16] you freedom
[38:17] it is his sacrifice that gives you rest
[38:20] it is his sacrifice Amen that delivers
[38:24] you from everything it is sacrifice is
[38:28] that right the Bible said that God said
[38:30] I can swear by no other
[38:32] I am totally for him I'm gonna make this
[38:35] thing happen
[38:37] hallelujah and my word is going out and
[38:39] it cannot come back boy those that are
[38:44] cursed because you remember now we're at
[38:48] a battle and we're battling those that
[38:49] are cursed by Isaiah 35
[38:56] 5:3 says for my soul shall be bathed in
[39:00] heaven behold it shall come down upon in
[39:04] dunya
[39:05] now that word means Edom and Edom means
[39:08] red and upon the people of my curse to
[39:11] judge you say who's the cars everybody
[39:15] who do not receive the gospel of the
[39:18] Lord Jesus Christ
[39:20] they are the cursed the sword of the
[39:23] Lord is filled with blood it is made fat
[39:27] with fatness and with the blood of lambs
[39:29] and goats and with the fat of the
[39:31] kidneys of grams for the Lord have a
[39:34] sacrifice and bows Raju anybody know who
[39:36] that is
[39:37] and a great slaughter in the land of
[39:40] Edom do anybody know who that is
[39:43] as I said he came I'm gonna pose right
[39:48] you know and the unicorn should come
[39:50] down with them in the bullocks with the
[39:52] Bulls and their land should be soaked
[39:55] with blood and their dust meat fat with
[39:59] fatness for it is the day of the Lord's
[40:03] vengeance and the year of recompense for
[40:07] the controversy of Zion so understand
[40:11] and then this whole battle started when
[40:17] Lucifer said hi jealousy I will be like
[40:24] the Most High God I will ascend above
[40:26] the stars of heaven hallelujah and that
[40:30] those stars of heaven was literally the
[40:33] bride of Jesus Christ and Lucifer said
[40:37] I'm gonna sin and brother branham insane
[40:39] insane even he said everything he said
[40:42] he did it he even prophesied and the
[40:47] prophecy came to pass but he didn't even
[40:50] know that he was in the hand and a tool
[40:52] of God he was in the hands of God he's a
[40:55] tool of God that we might see it is God
[40:59] who reigns think about it when God that
[41:03] wasn't about said one age you're gonna
[41:06] take him and throw him in a lake of fire
[41:10] oh is this the man this the guy that
[41:15] caused all this trouble
[41:20] I'm just running to that a jury here Oh
[41:24] glory to the angel hallelujah in way of
[41:28] glory to the gut to God Amen you and I
[41:32] must understand we must not how can I
[41:34] see it if you love your brother remember
[41:38] the story the war was going on one of
[41:41] the brothers fell and the other guy
[41:44] picked him up somebody said leave him
[41:46] Libby's no he picked him up and carry
[41:49] the only shoulder and he says he ain't
[41:52] heavy he's my brother
[41:55] carrying a brother should never be heavy
[41:57] heavy in the midst of this war somebody
[42:02] help me here in the midst of this wall
[42:05] we ought to do everything we possibly
[42:07] can to make sure people continue to be
[42:10] saved
[42:11] we need the love of God to chase people
[42:14] we let them go and nobody's chasing them
[42:17] but God give us repentance God give us
[42:21] grace God give us mercy that we have the
[42:25] love of one another
[42:28] our duty is not to step down or to dump
[42:32] on one another but it's to lift one
[42:34] another up you don't have to one sense
[42:37] one person follow you know they're
[42:39] already down they need some words of
[42:42] encouragement is that Alright
[42:45] we're in a battle but it's not against
[42:47] the house of Zion we are battling
[42:51] everything that's not Zion in the
[42:56] spiritual you know everything that's
[42:59] happening in this world started with the
[43:01] religion what is true and what is not
[43:05] who is God and who isn't God right
[43:09] and you saw our Brotherhood it looked
[43:11] like Satan is winning the battle but did
[43:16] you know brother man who said it like
[43:17] that somewhat like that he said the
[43:19] Catholic Church would reign all the way
[43:21] through it or take God Himself to stop
[43:23] her
[43:24] that's how much power she's got all
[43:26] nations are under her hallelujah if she
[43:30] says stop the wall they stop it if she
[43:33] say stop the wall she starts it hey
[43:35] control bar she's got all the money all
[43:39] the go she's got the power nobody can
[43:43] stop her but Jesus Christ himself
[43:47] Heavenly Father people don't want to
[43:49] believe that but it's not just her the
[43:51] Catholic Church is it's all the promises
[43:53] do they all have drawn together and a
[43:56] powerful force and let me tell you this
[43:58] the only thing that could conquer this
[44:01] power is the Holy Ghost
[44:02] without the Holy Ghost you receive the
[44:05] mark of the beast that's it
[44:06] people Oh Lord no I won't that's what
[44:09] the devil says he said let me tell you
[44:10] something you got a head around Joe you
[44:15] take that head around job and I'll make
[44:16] him curse you your faith and you know
[44:18] what that probably would have been
[44:20] possible but God told us that but you
[44:22] can do that but don't touch the oil in
[44:24] the wine you can you can Bellamy anyway
[44:30] but you better not mess with his life
[44:32] you understand me
[44:34] that is the only reason why we overcome
[44:36] it is the only reason why we cannot be
[44:39] deceived because the Bible said it will
[44:41] not deceive the very elect hallelujah
[44:45] that's the only reason because the word
[44:48] says so I am the father as we bow in
[44:52] that presence humbly as men and women
[44:54] our heart goes out in the deep sympathy
[44:57] of the sick and the needy and God in the
[45:00] midst of criticism and everything
[45:02] thou has taken us through every storm
[45:05] Lord and in that great day when we stand
[45:08] there we want to show battle scars that
[45:11] we've been on the battlefield
[45:15] I'm like yea our Lord we want to show
[45:18] the battle scars come on we can't just
[45:22] run from the battles we gotta face to
[45:25] him Josh can't run from him folks God
[45:32] has ordained these battles for you and
[45:34] me is that right
[45:36] Jew says
[45:38] when I gave all diligence to write unto
[45:40] you of the common salvation it was
[45:43] needful for me to write unto you and
[45:45] exhort you that you should earnestly
[45:47] contend for the faith which was once
[45:50] delivered unto the Saints that means
[45:52] honesty fight dance America that's why
[45:56] the promise at all
[45:57] you got these these days of mister
[45:58] passing and your God is not the same any
[46:01] you know he cared what was he doing
[46:03] he was contending for the faith when he
[46:06] took that scripture Hebrews 13 and 8
[46:10] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[46:12] and forever
[46:13] he was contending for the vain if you've
[46:16] got that one revelation you'll
[46:18] understand the character of Jesus just
[46:22] by reading you understand he cannot
[46:26] change for there are certain men crept
[46:31] in unawares who were before of old
[46:35] ordained to this condemnation ungodly
[46:38] being turning the grace of our God into
[46:41] lasciviousness and denying the only Lord
[46:44] God and our Lord Jesus Christ it goes on
[46:49] to say in the time is at hand he says
[46:50] the time has come down for us to realize
[46:54] these things the time has come when God
[46:58] breaking the barriers down and the time
[47:01] has come that the devil is rising up
[47:03] like a wild lion going about roaring
[47:06] doing everything he can but the great
[47:08] battle is being set he said I wonder
[47:12] what it will be tonight and we could
[47:15] climb above the heavens of heaven and
[47:17] look at the great drama as his getting
[47:21] set together now fixing to come the pass
[47:24] of God and the devil coming down to a
[47:27] showdown I'm so glad that I am on the
[47:31] winning side I'm so glad that I follow
[47:34] the lamb because it said the lamb
[47:36] overcame dinner but he was a king of
[47:38] kings and the Lord of lords that's the
[47:41] time the time has come now for you to
[47:44] make a decision tonight what side you'll
[47:47] be on and I trust God you'll make the
[47:50] decision
[47:51] that you following the lamb hallelujah
[47:55] following the lamb I follow the lamb may
[47:58] God help us amen
[48:00] revelation 19 19 says and I saw the
[48:03] beast and the kings of the earth and
[48:05] their armies gathered together to make
[48:07] war against him that sat on the throne
[48:09] owner on the horse and against his army
[48:11] and the Beast was taken and with him the
[48:14] false prophet that wrought miracles
[48:16] before him with which he deceived them
[48:20] that had received the mark of the beast
[48:22] and when and then that the worship His
[48:25] image these both were cast alive into a
[48:29] lake of fire burning with brimstone and
[48:31] the remnant were slain with the sword of
[48:34] him that said upon the horse which which
[48:37] sword proceeded out of his mouth and all
[48:40] the fowls were filled with their flesh
[48:43] hallelujah there's a supper there's a
[48:46] supper of the Lamb and there's a supper
[48:49] the great self of God amen
[48:50] to supper so you might as well do with
[48:53] the lamb supper right hallelujah amen of
[48:56] course the other supper won't be you
[48:58] feasting it'll be the birds the beasts
[49:01] of the field and you will be the meal
[49:05] huh God listen you see what I'm trying
[49:10] to say you can't stop this it's already
[49:15] around so I can hear the combine the
[49:18] sound of the company here

[49:22] you've got to understand it's coming
[49:23] it's closer now than ever there will be
[49:27] a separation complete separation of the
[49:30] wheat and the tares and if the
[49:32] government is going to do it hallelujah
[49:36] just like it did it in Israel amen when
[49:39] they went down to Babylon he wasn't a
[49:41] whole lot of people they a lot of Jews
[49:43] that went down but God only talks about
[49:46] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and Daniel
[49:49] out of all those people they stood their
[49:52] ground may have been others I don't know
[49:56] but think about the few that stood alone
[49:59] and could say like Paul I have kept the
[50:03] faith let me tell you something
[50:05] when you keep the faith God will defend
[50:08] you he will fight your battles listen
[50:18] what he says for God has put in their
[50:20] hearts to fulfil his will and to agree
[50:23] and give their kingdoms over to the
[50:26] beast unto the Word of God until the
[50:29] Word of God shall be fulfilled so
[50:32] everybody every kingdom of this world
[50:35] may not even agree with the Catholic
[50:38] Church or the in communica Council but
[50:41] guess what
[50:41] God will put it in their hearts to do it
[50:45] they got to do it they can't resist it
[50:49] it is prophecy it must come to pass is
[50:52] that right think about all the preaching
[50:54] brother branham beard against
[50:56] authorization and denominations and
[50:58] everything else and guess what
[51:00] demons are carrying went enjoying the
[51:02] Pentecostal church together amen with
[51:04] the council as though he never heard it
[51:06] before he couldn't help it he was
[51:10] ordained to do so just like Judas
[51:14] hallelujah
[51:15] tell me Russia don't reign over all we
[51:20] don't reign over all there's one king
[51:22] that reigns over every body like that
[51:25] like Nebuchadnezzar I am running out in
[51:27] every one of them toes that's wrong
[51:30] wrong done dude do it as a nation it
[51:34] does is that a church
[51:35] every nation under heaven is - wrong no
[51:39] wonder they say who can make war with
[51:41] him he can say peace hallelujah
[51:45] every Catholic says it don't it don't
[51:48] fight and they don't fight that's all
[51:51] who was able to do what he can do nobody
[51:53] that's right
[51:54] so they wonder at the miracle he can do
[51:57] he can stop wars by the snap of his
[52:01] finger once boy then he can he have to
[52:05] say it stop that's all but you think
[52:08] he'll do it certainly not notice that
[52:11] sure that's sure they should kill one
[52:15] another they should kill each other his
[52:18] boy
[52:18] no arrow at first but his his great
[52:21] sword did he done his killing later and
[52:25] changed him white and white horse to a
[52:27] red horse the same exact devil with his
[52:31] sword what did Jesus say jesus said they
[52:34] take they that take the sword will
[52:36] perish by it don't fight back oh oh when
[52:42] the pressure come you can't fight back

[53:00] God won't back you you got to realize
[53:03] hey man God is gonna only back his word
[53:06] that Saint Peter who took a sword ain't
[53:09] meant to cut that man's head off walk
[53:12] empty-handed down there to get crucified
[53:14] upside down he didn't go to fight not in
[53:18] a way that they thought he fought him in
[53:21] spirit he went down as a soldier my
[53:25] goodness think about the scars
[53:28] hey man and now we know Peter as a
[53:31] conqueror overcomer hallelujah when they
[53:36] thought they were putting him to death
[53:37] it was really literally placing him in
[53:39] history hallelujah one of the greatest
[53:43] martyrs ever lived one thing for certain
[53:47] God showed us where he how he changed
[53:49] Peter right now remember he has he has
[53:55] got a sword he is going he is going
[53:58] forth a sword in his hand
[54:00] riding Red Horse wading through the
[54:02] blood of everybody that disagree with
[54:04] him hallelujah alright so when we think
[54:14] about this battle and the things that
[54:16] we're going through you and I must
[54:19] understand Amen that we've been ordained
[54:22] to do it and we've got investigating
[54:25] angels we've got God has already sent
[54:27] forth these things to show us and to
[54:30] prove to us that he's going to do what
[54:31] he said he's going to do
[54:32] now we're looking at all of these things
[54:35] and I was thinking the other day when I
[54:40] was thinking about this thought about
[54:42] Lord what would you have me minister and
[54:45] I'm at the end here because I want you
[54:47] to understand we cannot retreat but we
[54:51] need to set a little more fire to
[54:53] ourselves and the only way that can
[54:55] happen is that you got to ask God you
[54:58] got to pray more I got to pray more I'm
[55:01] I just I just just been I see I see it
[55:05] about a greater now than I ever have and
[55:07] I see more faith than me than I ever
[55:10] have but one thing I do know is I'm not
[55:13] a quitter I don't give up and I'm a
[55:17] table right some time that devil tells
[55:18] you you know you need to give it up you
[55:21] need to quit but if I quit what I'm
[55:23] gonna do where am I gonna go there's no
[55:26] place to go
[55:27] there's nothing that can satisfy you
[55:29] outside of Jesus you know I don't go I'm
[55:32] going that route already right I know
[55:34] he's the only peacemaker
[55:37] he's the only one that can come and call
[55:39] me down y'all know what I'm trying to
[55:41] say whether it be direct or indirect
[55:44] through a brother or sister God is the
[55:46] only one that that can work with me and
[55:50] handle me and you know I don't even know
[55:53] why you know how it is why it is but I'm
[55:57] gonna tell you something I have
[55:59] determined and I am determined to give
[56:02] God my best with what I have left give
[56:07] him my best but what I have left and I
[56:11] think everyone tonight we don't know
[56:13] when God is going to call our cars but
[56:15] we ought to be in a place determined
[56:17] like I says of engine your adversary and
[56:24] you and I need to be in that place where
[56:27] we're gonna say to God this is it I know
[56:32] who I'm fighting with I'm on the lam
[56:34] side I'm gonna place myself in this
[56:37] formation and understand folks we had
[56:45] seven
[56:46] great leaders see each age had a leader
[56:49] but we got seven seven angels brought
[56:53] this message seven warriors met brought
[56:58] this ancient message and you and I have
[57:01] all seven with authority to fight for us
[57:05] and with us and that great angel he's
[57:11] still here we need to start we need to
[57:15] get to a place where how do you go - no
[57:18] brother Brooks you'll know that the fire
[57:21] is getting greater when you learn how
[57:23] when you can't highly help but to
[57:25] witness to somebody the harder the fire
[57:30] the more witnessing you gonna do now
[57:33] they may not even receive you but you go
[57:35] to tell it anyhow because that's how I
[57:38] started when the fire was lit on the on
[57:40] the on those Jews they went to
[57:42] witnessing immediately you love the Lord
[57:47] blessed and they didn't care about
[57:53] themselves what they used to be where
[57:55] they came from
[57:56] who they were they talked about Jesus
[58:00] what Jesus had done for them I know it
[58:10] worth it then God is worth it to make is
