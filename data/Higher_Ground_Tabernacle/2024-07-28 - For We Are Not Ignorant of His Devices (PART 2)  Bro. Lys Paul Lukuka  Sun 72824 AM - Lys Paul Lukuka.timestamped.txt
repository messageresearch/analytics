[38:21] started uh SIM can you go to the office
[38:23] bring my notes I left my notes in the
[38:26] office but we'll start with
[38:31] um First Peter chapter 5 verse
[38:46] 8 Bible
[38:50] says be
[38:53] sober of 1 Peter chapter 5 verse 8
[39:01] be sober be
[39:05] vigilant because your adversary the
[39:08] devil as a roaring
[39:11] lion walketh
[39:13] about seeking seeking whom he may
[39:18] devour amen amen so that's uh the first
[39:21] scripture let's go to uh 2 Corinthians
[39:23] 29-1
[39:31] the Bible says for this end also did I
[39:39] write chapter 2 verse
[39:42] 9 for this end also did I write that I
[39:45] may know the proof of you whether you be
[39:49] obedient in all things
[39:57] to whom you forgive anything I forgive
[40:03] also for if I forgive anything to whom I
[40:06] forget I forgave
[40:11] it for your sakes forgave I it in the
[40:14] person of
[40:17] Christ let Satan should get an advantage
[40:20] of
[40:23] us for we are not ignorant of his
[40:25] devices
[40:28] amen let's bow our head may the Lord add
[40:30] a blessings reading of his word Heavenly
[40:33] Father Lord Jesus we love you Lord we
[40:37] thank you Lord for your word we thank
[40:39] you for the song service
[40:41] Lord father the Lord Jesus Christ I
[40:44] Surrender myself to you
[40:46] Lord that you may use me Lord and speak
[40:50] through me Lord Jesus and may you hear
[40:52] through the the the congregation Lord
[40:54] God
[40:57] and Heavenly Father Lord you know what
[40:58] they need Lord
[41:00] Jesus and I commit the service into your
[41:03] hand Lord may you have full control of
[41:05] the
[41:06] service in the precious name of the Lord
[41:09] Jesus Christ we
[41:10] pray amen amen amen you may
[41:16] your so this is going to be the second
[41:19] part of the I preach on this uh sermon
[41:23] two two Wednesdays ago
[41:32] and the title of it the title of it is
[41:35] for we are not ignorant of his
[41:41] devices and I took this from uh 2
[41:44] Corinthians chapter
[41:48] 2 verse 11 where Paul
[41:51] says lest Satan should get an advantage
[41:54] of us
[41:58] for we are not ignorant of his
[42:01] devices so from this scripture we
[42:04] understand that there is an advantage
[42:06] that the devil can get over
[42:09] you if you are ignorant of
[42:12] his if you don't know how the enemy
[42:15] operates then the Bible tells us that
[42:17] Satan has an advantage
[42:20] over Prophet says that when a man goes
[42:22] to
[42:24] war he he he usually said they it when a
[42:27] country goes to
[42:28] war they send spies you know they try to
[42:31] spy into the the enemy's
[42:33] land to know the weapons that they
[42:37] use because for instance let's say um if
[42:41] I go to work uh if a country goes to war
[42:43] and we're using
[42:46] knives versus a country that uses uh
[42:49] Atomic
[42:53] weapons we all know that the country
[42:55] that uses the atomic weapon has the
[42:56] advantage
[43:00] and that would be insane for the country
[43:01] that uses knife to even uh try to get
[43:04] into
[43:06] war so that's why most countries they
[43:08] even have secret service
[43:11] agencies C because you got you got to
[43:14] inquire about your
[43:18] enemy even in boxing that's the same
[43:20] thing
[43:22] like before a boxer prepares for a
[43:26] match watches his enemy the way he
[43:30] operates and the way he prepares better
[43:33] for
[43:34] the and we know that in this Christian
[43:37] Christian Life that we live we are also
[43:40] living in a battle in a
[43:42] fight and then Paul tells us that there
[43:44] is an advantage that the devil can get
[43:46] if we are ignorant of his
[43:51] devic so uh the prophet says in the
[43:54] message revelation
[43:57] this is just a a short um a summary of
[43:59] what I preached on
[44:02] Wednesday before we
[44:05] continue so the prophet says that Satan
[44:07] and Satan is
[44:10] exposed Satan does not want himself
[44:14] exposed so we know Services where we we
[44:17] expose the the tactic of the enemy Satan
[44:19] does not like
[44:22] it he says you notice how horrible it is
[44:24] for Satan when when he thinks is going
[44:27] to get
[44:32] exposed watch the action of the
[44:35] people you watch out on the
[44:40] meetings just be just before Satan is
[44:42] going to be exposed over a certain
[44:44] person you'll see their face
[44:50] changing so according to the prophet
[44:52] that Satan it's it's even it's a change
[44:54] that's noticeable to uh uh uh
[45:01] he hates that kind of a
[45:05] meeting the Holy Spirit comes down and
[45:08] exposes that
[45:11] devil so we understand that it's it's
[45:13] not going to be me who is going to be
[45:15] exposed the
[45:17] devil but it's the holy spirit that
[45:20] exposes the
[45:21] devil the holy spirit is the
[45:24] word at the beginning was the word the
[45:26] Word was God
[45:28] and made flesh and DW Among Us so it's
[45:31] the word of God of our
[45:33] age that is going to be exposing the the
[45:36] the devices of
[45:39] the so um let's go back to the I don't
[45:44] think I have the definition of it but um
[45:46] the definition of being ignorant
[45:50] means having lack of
[45:55] knowledge or of
[45:59] understanding so if if we have to to
[46:01] break down the scripture so pretty much
[46:03] they're telling us Paul is telling us
[46:04] that if you you have lack of knowledge
[46:09] or knowledge or understanding of how the
[46:12] devil
[46:14] operates then he has an
[46:16] advantage no wonder the Bible says that
[46:18] my people are destroyed for lack of
[46:24] knowledge 46 my people are destroy for
[46:27] lack of
[46:30] knowledge there are three things that
[46:32] that the Devil comes to
[46:34] do he comes to kill steal and
[46:38] destroy and then in this verse is
[46:40] telling us that we are
[46:42] destroyed for lack of
[46:44] knowledge for being ignorant of how the
[46:48] devil
[46:51] operates the prophet says that overcome
[46:54] means to recognize the devil in every
[46:56] one of his
[47:00] so all the devices that the enemy
[47:03] uses you have to know those devices in
[47:07] order to
[47:09] overcome a real
[47:11] devil uh he says a lot of people says
[47:14] there's no devil it just
[47:16] thought don't you believe that there's a
[47:19] real devil he's just as real as you are
[47:22] or
[47:23] anybody a real devil and you must
[47:26] recognize
[47:27] him so the prophet did not say you may
[47:30] recognize the
[47:31] devil he you must recognize the
[47:36] devil it very important to recognize
[47:39] that something is the
[47:41] devil you must know he's the
[47:44] devil and then you uh and the same time
[47:47] you recognize him know that he's the
[47:50] devil and he's against
[47:52] you so you have to know that his weapons
[47:54] whatever devices the devil is using is
[47:56] point pointed at
[48:00] you but you must also recognize that God
[48:03] in you is greater and mightier than he
[48:08] is that in you has already overcome
[48:12] him so the god in you is more powerful
[48:16] than the
[48:17] enemy the god in you has already
[48:20] overcome the devil and if if you have
[48:23] that Revelation that God in you is more
[48:25] powerful than
[48:27] that's your
[48:28] Victory that's why it is important to be
[48:31] filled with the Holy Ghost because God
[48:33] in you is the Holy Ghost according to
[48:36] the prophet without the Holy Ghost you
[48:37] cannot
[48:41] overcome
[48:44] amen so what is what is your
[48:47] enemy The Prophet says your enemy is
[48:49] something that reason for for forgive me
[48:52] it's a battle you've got to want your
[48:54] enemy you've got to know your enemy
[48:57] and you've got to know your
[48:59] armor your armor is the
[49:02] word and your enemy is something that
[49:05] reason against
[49:07] it anything that comes to make you
[49:10] reason the word of God is your
[49:14] enemy if God makes a
[49:17] promise and something else tells you
[49:19] that that promise is isn't isn't the way
[49:21] God said
[49:23] it
[49:25] your So like um last Wednesday I'm just
[49:29] going to skip cuz like um I've got a lot
[49:31] of things to talk about um okay let
[49:35] let's read this one here real quick so
[49:39] notice and don't you underestimate Jesus
[49:43] Christ because he's the power over all
[49:48] powers and then the prophet says Don't
[49:50] Be Afraid Of
[49:53] Satan but there's a
[49:55] condition as as long as you are in him
[49:59] Jesus as long as you are in Jesus Christ
[50:01] don't be afraid
[50:03] of if you are not in
[50:06] him you better
[50:09] tremble this these are the words of the
[50:11] prophet of our age William Mar
[50:13] brother he's telling you that if you not
[50:16] filled with the Holy
[50:18] Ghost you better tremble at the
[50:21] Devil you know the the devil the devil
[50:24] is no match for us
[50:28] uh the prophet even says that even like
[50:31] you cannot match the enemy I can't match
[50:36] it William Bram himself could not even
[50:38] match the
[50:41] devil if you are putting your Hope on
[50:44] William Bram to help you overcome the
[50:49] devil that's you'll be disappointed
[50:52] because he's telling you that himself
[50:53] he's no mat for the dev
[50:58] I remember but I'm but I remember I'm
[51:01] living under a
[51:03] promise that his powers has already been
[51:06] more than
[51:08] matched and
[51:10] conquered and cast down I'm more than
[51:14] than a conqueror right
[51:15] now not
[51:17] myself so that scripture that says you
[51:19] are more than over
[51:22] conquer it's not yourself you know but
[51:26] I'm in him who conquered him for
[51:30] me Jesus conquered the devil for
[51:34] you the prophet did not say conquer it
[51:36] for for
[51:38] himself you have the prophet preach on a
[51:41] message
[51:42] identification you have to identify
[51:44] yourself with the
[51:46] message when the prophet says but I'm in
[51:49] him who conquered it for
[51:52] me you replace me with your name
[51:56] the devil uh uh has been conquered for
[52:00] you amen amen so uh um last last
[52:05] Wednesday we talked about
[52:07] um two two way two ways that that the
[52:10] enemy
[52:12] operates reasoning the word of
[52:15] God and the other one is Was
[52:18] Fear you know the prophet says the
[52:21] prophet says that sometimes you watch a
[52:23] person that is
[52:25] sick the moment they get diagnosed with
[52:27] an
[52:30] illness fear takes control of
[52:33] them and they even Tred to go to to to
[52:36] die
[52:38] early the prophet talks about premature
[52:42] death he says he says that I know that
[52:45] death has got to strike
[52:50] everyone but sometime just because of
[52:52] unbelief we give up and we go to a
[52:54] premature death
[53:00] and another course that I had the
[53:02] prophet explains out because of the
[53:06] fear people because fear will make you
[53:09] disbelieve the promises of
[53:12] God and when you disbelieve the promises
[53:15] of God you can't even go you can die
[53:19] prematurely those are the devices of the
[53:22] enemy so today we'll talk about um the
[53:25] third device
[53:28] which is uh the the devil attacks the
[53:33] youth so um this is for everybody for
[53:36] the parents for the young
[53:39] people amen amen all right let me check
[53:43] this here we'll start with um um Matthew
[53:46] chapter 2 verse
[53:55] 16 uh same can you put it there I don't
[53:57] think I have it
[54:03] here so Matthew chap 2:1 16
[54:08] says then
[54:10] Herod when he saw that he was mocked of
[54:13] the wise
[54:15] men he was exceeding exceeding
[54:19] WTH and sent forth and slow and slow all
[54:23] the children slew all the children that
[54:24] were in Bethlehem
[54:29] and in all the cast
[54:32] thereof from two years old and
[54:36] under according to the time which he had
[54:38] diligently inquired of the wise
[54:43] man all right so we see that in Matthew
[54:46] Herod went after the
[54:51] children the prophet says Spirits don't
[54:54] die that same demon spirit that was
[54:57] inherited
[54:58] is still alive today and that spirit is
[55:02] doing the same
[55:04] thing you know uh in the message
[55:07] diseases and
[55:11] afflictions they should be in my slides
[55:13] one
[55:14] second disease and
[55:19] affliction yeah I have it here so the
[55:22] prophet says that all the Natural Things
[55:25] of the earth types the
[55:29] spiritual everything in the natural
[55:31] types the
[55:33] spiritual everything that happens on
[55:35] this natural
[55:39] life and all these natural natural
[55:44] happenings now they forun spiritual
[55:49] happenings each happening accompanies
[55:52] the other happening
[55:57] so so the reason why I I I I read this
[56:01] quote is um you'll have a better
[56:04] understanding when we go to the next
[56:07] chapter in in in
[56:10] Exodus the king of Egypt also went after
[56:13] the
[56:15] children so this is a patter we see
[56:18] Herod going after the the the
[56:21] kids and also the king of
[56:24] Egypt so let
[56:26] uh the Lord showed me something
[56:28] interesting about that that chapter
[56:35] yesterday okay it's it's it's going to
[56:37] be in the book of
[56:41] Exodus Exodus chapter 1 verse 8 to 22
[56:45] we'll just take our time with the
[56:47] scripture
[56:57] same Exodus chapter one
[57:09] ex all right so verse uh we'll start
[57:12] with the verse
[57:16] eight but before we read that let just
[57:18] read this quotes real quick the prophet
[57:19] says God and His enemy and is his enemy
[57:23] he did in the natural then
[57:28] just like God and His enemy is doing in
[57:30] the spiritual
[57:32] now so the prophet is talking about this
[57:34] chapter that we're about to
[57:37] read pay attention he says what the
[57:40] enemy did in the book of
[57:43] Exodus he's doing that spiritually
[57:48] today Satan is going after the
[57:52] kids that's what he did here in the book
[57:54] of Exodus
[57:56] all right let's read the verse uh
[57:59] eight now there a rose up a new king of
[58:04] Egypt which knew not
[58:07] Joseph and he said unto his
[58:09] people behold the people of the children
[58:12] of Israel are more and mighy than
[58:17] we come on let us deal wisely with
[58:23] them lest they multiply
[58:27] and and it come to
[58:28] pass that when there fth out any
[58:32] War they join also unto our
[58:36] enemies and fight against us and so get
[58:41] them out of the land let just pause here
[58:44] right so the prophet says that the the
[58:47] uh spiritual T the natural T the
[58:50] spiritual and whatever happened there is
[58:52] just forerunning what what is happening
[58:57] when I was reading this this chapter
[59:00] yesterday in verse 9 when it says that
[59:03] so let's picture this like as the United
[59:06] States of
[59:08] America if you notice
[59:10] here that the Egyptians so this was an
[59:13] immigration
[59:15] issue the children of Israel migrated to
[59:21] Egypt and then they started to multiply
[59:25] [Music]
[59:26] blessed and now the CH the the Egyptians
[59:29] started to fear that these people are
[59:31] becoming more than
[59:34] us isn't that what's happening today you
[59:38] know we in America or even in Europe I
[59:40] see that in France Paris they are afraid
[59:43] that those
[59:45] immigrants are becoming more than the
[59:47] people that that used to
[59:50] leave this these are just spiritual type
[59:53] God is God is showing us something the
[59:55] problem is everything that happens in
[59:57] the natural tiies the
[1:00:00] spiritual so just like
[1:00:02] here they were afraid that people would
[1:00:05] take over their
[1:00:08] land right and if you you notice verse
[1:00:11] 10 he says and so get them out of the
[1:00:13] land
[1:00:15] end that's massive
[1:00:19] deportation let's get them out of our
[1:00:22] land isn't that a slogan in the US
[1:00:24] now you know like let's get all those
[1:00:28] migrants out of the
[1:00:30] land the Bible says you know watch and
[1:00:33] pray you
[1:00:34] know we have to pay attention to those
[1:00:36] things we just we don't have to read the
[1:00:39] news just like the regular people we
[1:00:40] have to read the
[1:00:43] news we have to read the news with the
[1:00:46] glasses of the word of
[1:00:49] God so verse 11 therefore the deed said
[1:00:53] over them task Masters
[1:00:57] them with their
[1:00:59] burdens and they buil treasure
[1:01:03] cities and let's skip to verse 13 and
[1:01:07] the Egyptians made the children of
[1:01:08] Israel to serve with
[1:01:12] rigor ver 15 and the king of Egypt speak
[1:01:16] to the Hebrew
[1:01:19] midwives of which the name of the one
[1:01:22] was Shipra and the name of the other po
[1:01:27] and he said when you do the office of a
[1:01:32] midwife to the Hebrew
[1:01:34] women and see them up on the
[1:01:37] stools if it be a
[1:01:40] son then you shall kill him but if you
[1:01:44] be a daughter then she shall
[1:01:48] live that is
[1:01:50] abortion isn't that what's happening
[1:01:52] today
[1:01:56] you know they wanted to kill the the uh
[1:02:00] baby uh the son son son the baby
[1:02:04] son you know the king of Egypt told the
[1:02:10] midwives you know because because they
[1:02:13] tried to to make to to make them do the
[1:02:15] hard labor but they noticing
[1:02:17] that they keep on multiplying still so
[1:02:21] let's find a different
[1:02:23] strategy now let's go through the route
[1:02:28] abortion but you have to know that as we
[1:02:32] know these things every all the laws
[1:02:34] that happen in the land are targeted at
[1:02:37] the of
[1:02:40] Christ all the laws of the
[1:02:44] land that are contrary to the
[1:02:47] Bible is targeted at
[1:02:49] you the prophet says that you must
[1:02:52] understand that the devil he's against
[1:02:53] you
[1:02:55] against his own
[1:02:57] people I can prove this by the
[1:02:59] scripture let's go to Daniel chapter 6
[1:03:02] and then we'll come back to
[1:03:04] exod Daniel chapter
[1:03:07] 6 uh King Darius and
[1:03:12] Daniel so verse
[1:03:15] three uh and then this Daniel was
[1:03:19] preferred above the presidents and
[1:03:23] princes because in excellent Spirit was
[1:03:26] in
[1:03:28] him and the King thought to set him over
[1:03:31] the whole
[1:03:33] realm then the president and prin sought
[1:03:36] to find occasions
[1:03:40] against uh but they could they could
[1:03:43] find none occasion nor
[1:03:47] fault for as much as he was
[1:03:50] faithful neither was there any error or
[1:03:53] fault found
[1:03:55] So Daniel was appointed as like so there
[1:03:59] was the king and then there were princes
[1:04:01] and
[1:04:02] presidents and Daniel was the head right
[1:04:05] after the
[1:04:07] king so he had the highest position
[1:04:10] after the
[1:04:11] king so these other people they got
[1:04:13] jealous
[1:04:15] of and they sought to find a way to
[1:04:19] just put him
[1:04:21] down but they couldn't find any fault in
[1:04:24] him that's that's what the devil ising
[1:04:26] he's trying to put down the bride but he
[1:04:28] cannot find any fault in the bride so he
[1:04:31] looks for different
[1:04:33] strategies then verse five then say
[1:04:36] these men we shall not find any occasion
[1:04:38] against Daniel except find it against
[1:04:40] him concerning the
[1:04:46] Lord these presidents and princes
[1:04:48] assembled together to the king and say
[1:04:50] th unto him King Darius
[1:04:58] I'll skip the verse seven you know they
[1:05:01] talking to the king and in verse eight
[1:05:04] uh uh verse n wherefore King arus signed
[1:05:07] the writing and the
[1:05:11] decree so this King darus he signed a
[1:05:16] law just to show you that it does never
[1:05:20] never put your Hope on a
[1:05:23] man because Daniel was be loved by this
[1:05:28] King this King loved Daniel so
[1:05:31] much but he got
[1:05:34] tricked you know if you like it doesn't
[1:05:38] matter who you friend of like the
[1:05:40] devil Prophet says that the devil is
[1:05:43] even in the white house right
[1:05:45] now so it doesn't matter if it's Joe
[1:05:48] Biden
[1:05:50] Trump Satan is after the
[1:05:53] bride so verse 10 now when Daniel knew
[1:05:56] that the writing was
[1:05:59] signed he went into his house okay let's
[1:06:01] skip that one let's go to verse
[1:06:03] 11 then these men assembled and found
[1:06:06] Daniel praying and
[1:06:10] making then they came near and spake
[1:06:13] before the king concerning the king's
[1:06:19] decree verse 13 then then answered they
[1:06:22] and said before the king that Daniel
[1:06:25] which is of the Children of the
[1:06:26] Captivity of Judah regardest not thee Oh
[1:06:38] King verse 14 then the King when he
[1:06:42] heard these words was so displeased with
[1:06:48] himself and set his heart on Daniel to
[1:06:51] deliver
[1:06:53] him and he labored till the going down
[1:06:56] of the sun to deliver
[1:06:58] him so the king did not even have
[1:07:00] control over even making the laws of
[1:07:05] the this King loved Daniel so
[1:07:08] much but he signed a
[1:07:11] law that it seemed like it was for
[1:07:13] everybody but we just read those
[1:07:15] presidents they were targeting
[1:07:19] Daniel so an entire country changed the
[1:07:21] law just so they could get to Daniel
[1:07:26] the prophet is telling us we have to
[1:07:28] understand the the way Satan
[1:07:32] operates and he says he still uses the
[1:07:34] same tactic
[1:07:37] today so laws of a country can just be
[1:07:40] changed just they're aiming the
[1:07:44] bride all those abortion laws that are
[1:07:47] coming into
[1:07:48] place it's not for those
[1:07:51] people Satan cannot fight against
[1:07:53] himself Jesus told his kingdom will be
[1:07:57] divided he against the bride of
[1:08:02] Christ and so feeding that all these
[1:08:04] things are happening in the book of
[1:08:07] Exodus the prophet preached the message
[1:08:10] to Third
[1:08:11] Exodus we are near the third we are
[1:08:14] living in the Third
[1:08:15] Exodus very soon the Lord is coming and
[1:08:18] we
[1:08:20] be you know all these these things that
[1:08:22] are happening it was already typified in
[1:08:27] and now we seeing these things happening
[1:08:28] in the spiritual me
[1:08:31] in it's just a sign that we are close to
[1:08:33] the coming of the
[1:08:37] Lord amen and then uh verse uh let's go
[1:08:41] back to Exodus chapter
[1:08:50] 117 no let's just go to 22 I'll SK cuz
[1:08:52] I'm running out of term um Pharaoh
[1:08:55] charged all his people saying every son
[1:08:58] that is born uh every son that is born
[1:09:01] ye shall cast into the river and every
[1:09:04] daughter ye shall save
[1:09:14] alive right so we understand that also
[1:09:17] the king of Egypt went after the
[1:09:19] kids through different ways
[1:09:22] abortion the prophet of God said he was
[1:09:24] after the seed of Moses
[1:09:28] you notice it's a
[1:09:30] son you know and then also in the in in
[1:09:32] the Matthew we see that he's going after
[1:09:34] his
[1:09:36] son and in Revelation 12 we also see
[1:09:38] that the dragon is going after his
[1:09:42] son do you know that from Genesis to to
[1:09:45] to to to this
[1:09:47] day the devil has been going after that
[1:09:51] seed he's been going after the Sun
[1:09:55] what is the bride of Christ going to
[1:09:57] do we are supposed to produce the son of
[1:10:00] of
[1:10:01] God that's what the devil is going after
[1:10:05] you know these things clearly was a
[1:10:07] shadow of what is happening
[1:10:13] today amen all right
[1:10:17] so okay yeah there's another thing that
[1:10:19] also comes to my
[1:10:21] mind notice here every son that is born
[1:10:25] ye shall cast into the river and every
[1:10:27] daughter you shall save a
[1:10:31] life you know God show me through the
[1:10:33] scripture if you notice they did not try
[1:10:35] to kill the
[1:10:37] daughters just the
[1:10:39] sons you know the son is the person that
[1:10:42] gives the
[1:10:45] seed so the tactic of the
[1:10:48] enemy he wanted to kill all the
[1:10:51] sons so that he they only remain
[1:10:53] daughters
[1:10:55] and then the
[1:10:57] hybrid they get yeah they get mixed
[1:11:00] between the Egyptians and the children
[1:11:02] of
[1:11:04] Israel you know and then and and and
[1:11:07] then that way they kill that
[1:11:09] seed because the male is the person that
[1:11:11] gives the
[1:11:13] seed if he he didn't care about the
[1:11:16] daughters because they didn't they
[1:11:17] weren't seed carriers
[1:11:21] they and then the prophet tells us the
[1:11:23] same thing
[1:11:25] in this
[1:11:26] message uh the Third Exodus notice the
[1:11:30] devil the first thing he done was get
[1:11:32] rid
[1:11:34] ofid of the
[1:11:38] children with a natural
[1:11:41] death you know and he had moved from
[1:11:45] Egypt you know uh and then he was in
[1:11:48] Rome Satan moved his seed up to
[1:11:52] Rome the first thing Rome did was to
[1:11:55] destroy it
[1:11:59] all it's the same devil you know the
[1:12:03] prophet telling now it's it's a
[1:12:04] spiritual
[1:12:06] death and today he's done the same thing
[1:12:09] under the sign of spirit
[1:12:12] now religious professing
[1:12:17] Christianity and taking our
[1:12:20] girls and marrying them to Catholic boys
[1:12:25] and make them bring their children
[1:12:30] Catholic to break the power of the other
[1:12:34] side there is your
[1:12:36] demon you see we this sermon is about
[1:12:40] exposing the the tactic of the
[1:12:43] enemy
[1:12:45] parents don't just give your daughters
[1:12:47] to
[1:12:49] anybody the devil uses that tactic to
[1:12:52] also break the the the the seed of God
[1:12:57] to break the
[1:12:58] power of the other
[1:13:00] side you know the prophet say he's using
[1:13:03] the same intellectual
[1:13:06] Tech so make sure you on when a guy
[1:13:09] comes to get your
[1:13:11] daughter make sure you know his
[1:13:16] beliefs right because we see that that's
[1:13:20] what they tried to do here they wanted
[1:13:21] to kill the son so they will use the
[1:13:24] daughters and mix them with the
[1:13:27] Egyptians to break the power of the
[1:13:29] other side and the prophet is telling us
[1:13:32] he's using the
[1:13:35] same you know they then they kill the
[1:13:38] children in the other two
[1:13:43] times the first two times with natural
[1:13:48] death and he's getting the children and
[1:13:50] kill them with spiritual
[1:13:53] death Maring and are
[1:13:57] marrying Satan is even using
[1:14:01] marriage to kill people
[1:14:04] spiritually you know breaking that
[1:14:08] power amen so now um this is just going
[1:14:11] to be I'm just going to be it's kind of
[1:14:13] like a
[1:14:14] study or just an awareness to make you
[1:14:17] to make you aware of the of what the
[1:14:19] devil does in our
[1:14:22] day this was just setting the foundation
[1:14:24] to show you actually what he's doing
[1:14:27] today so he's going up he went up to the
[1:14:29] children in with Herod and
[1:14:35] ex I'll show you this image real quick
[1:14:38] this was last
[1:14:39] year the
[1:14:41] LGBT Q group lgbtq now Satan is not even
[1:14:46] hiding
[1:14:47] anymore what is it saying we are coming
[1:14:51] for your children
[1:14:56] so these gay people they no no longer
[1:14:59] even hiding there but they're saying we
[1:15:02] are coming for your
[1:15:05] children why because they did the same
[1:15:08] thing in Exodus same in Matthew today
[1:15:11] again Satan is going for your children
[1:15:14] he's attacking the
[1:15:17] youth right and and then this here that
[1:15:20] says this is in
[1:15:22] California the teacher Union urges tools
[1:15:25] to promote drag queen story hours to
[1:15:27] help further inclusing inclusive
[1:15:41] atmosphere so Dr the drag queens are
[1:15:44] those men they they they they act like
[1:15:46] they dress like
[1:15:47] women they change to be like
[1:15:50] women now the the school's Union is
[1:15:53] saying that have promote
[1:15:57] that to your
[1:16:00] kids to further inclose him so that they
[1:16:03] feel
[1:16:05] included why does a kid need to know
[1:16:07] about those drag
[1:16:10] queens pay attention Satan is going for
[1:16:13] the
[1:16:16] bride he doesn't care about the children
[1:16:18] in the
[1:16:19] world he's going after your
[1:16:23] kids all these laws that are coming into
[1:16:26] place we saw with Daniel it was targeted
[1:16:31] at so this is targeted at the bride of
[1:16:36] Christ and you may say that's in
[1:16:38] California
[1:16:39] right this was just in Deo here last
[1:16:44] year a drug story hours at the Deo
[1:16:47] Public
[1:16:52] Library why do they want to go after
[1:16:55] kids so bad like that Noti Spirits don't
[1:16:59] die the same same
[1:17:03] tactic
[1:17:04] right demon here in the public library
[1:17:07] having
[1:17:08] kids and and men dressing like women in
[1:17:11] front of
[1:17:15] kids and this was uh two days uh last
[1:17:19] week
[1:17:22] in in California they even they they
[1:17:25] they they passed a
[1:17:28] law where if a kid go to
[1:17:31] school and he tells his teacher that he
[1:17:33] identifies as a for instance let's say a
[1:17:35] man identify as a
[1:17:39] woman now the school no longer is
[1:17:42] required to notify the parents
[1:17:48] about is that isn't that
[1:17:51] insane a child goes what does he know
[1:17:55] we are supposed to be uh leading the
[1:17:59] child those teachers are supposed to be
[1:18:01] showing them the right
[1:18:05] way now the Govern government is telling
[1:18:08] them don't tell the parents
[1:18:11] anymore so if a kid of like uh eight
[1:18:14] years old goes to the
[1:18:15] teacher and says I'm a transgender I
[1:18:18] want to change my my my
[1:18:20] gender the the parent will never know
[1:18:23] about that
[1:18:25] pay attention what you sending your kids
[1:18:32] to amen
[1:18:37] um all right so the next one uh
[1:18:42] is I had an a slide that I had here but
[1:18:47] yeah okay so this is what happened at
[1:18:49] the
[1:18:51] Olympics this was just two days ago I
[1:18:53] think
[1:18:56] those same drag queens drag que now
[1:19:00] they're making fun of the last
[1:19:03] supper and if you notice there's a child
[1:19:05] there
[1:19:08] too why why are they so obsessed with
[1:19:16] children right so Satan is coming up to
[1:19:19] your
[1:19:20] children parents be careful
[1:19:25] you have to know who your CH your
[1:19:26] children hang out
[1:19:30] with you know I'm not a parents I don't
[1:19:33] know how you
[1:19:34] guys but I'll say as a I'm talking from
[1:19:38] a a kid a young man's
[1:19:41] perspective
[1:19:44] perspective sometime as parent you need
[1:19:46] to just ask them why did they teach you
[1:19:47] at
[1:19:49] school you you got you just got to check
[1:19:51] those stuff the prophet talks about
[1:19:54] parents
[1:19:56] delinquency right and uh yeah let's just
[1:20:00] read that
[1:20:02] here no before we go into parental D
[1:20:05] let's go into the
[1:20:09] next so last Sunday brother Jesse was
[1:20:14] here and he preached on uh one of the
[1:20:18] things he also preached
[1:20:20] about was
[1:20:22] pornography right he did not even know I
[1:20:24] already had this in my notes since last
[1:20:28] Wednesday I just didn't get to finish it
[1:20:30] last
[1:20:31] Wednesday and he spoke about
[1:20:34] that so that means that and and then
[1:20:37] don't take this by that means god is
[1:20:38] actually God actually cares for you and
[1:20:40] want you to be
[1:20:45] deliver so this is uh this thing about
[1:20:47] this stat that I found about I know it's
[1:20:49] too
[1:20:51] small I won't say too much since you
[1:20:53] already spoke about
[1:20:55] spoke a
[1:20:56] lot the pornography industry generates
[1:20:59] more income than the combined revenues
[1:21:02] of ABC NBC and CBS and more than the
[1:21:05] combined revenues of the NFL NBA MLB in
[1:21:09] the USA land
[1:21:24] at between 15 billion to 97 billion a
[1:21:29] [Music]
[1:21:33] year every second $3,000 is being spent
[1:21:37] on
[1:21:42] pornography more people viewed internet
[1:21:45] pornography every month than Netflix
[1:21:47] Amazon and Twitter combined
[1:21:56] in
[1:21:58] 2016 people watch 4 4.6 billion hours of
[1:22:03] pornography at just one of the more than
[1:22:05] 42 million pornographic
[1:22:09] website 42 million pornograph
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:31] so there are 42 million porn
[1:22:34] websites and in just one of
[1:22:38] them they spent 4.6
[1:22:43] billion that's the equivalent of 524,000
[1:22:46] years spent in one year
[1:22:56] now pay attention who is their their
[1:23:01] target uh audience 93% of
[1:23:07] boys and 63% of
[1:23:10] girls will be exposed to the internet
[1:23:13] point before the age of
[1:23:19] 18 the average age of first exposure is
[1:23:23] 11 years old
[1:23:30] and sometimes eight years old imagine a
[1:23:33] kid8 years old
[1:23:35] being such
[1:23:39] n that's why
[1:23:42] parents sometimes check your phon with
[1:23:45] your
[1:23:47] kids I remember uh one time I want
[1:23:50] mention the name in North Liberty years
[1:23:53] ago uh we had like a a party my at my
[1:23:58] house and there was a kid who just went
[1:24:00] on the
[1:24:03] basement he was probably 11 or 10
[1:24:05] something like
[1:24:07] that and then I just felt like to go
[1:24:09] downstairs to talk to
[1:24:11] him and then um I just I don't know I I
[1:24:15] forgot the conversation we
[1:24:18] had in our conversation I felt late to
[1:24:20] ask
[1:24:22] him you know if um he uh watch his
[1:24:28] pornography and he denied he said no he
[1:24:30] he never he said he said he used
[1:24:33] to but he no longer does but he notice
[1:24:37] the devil doesn't like to be exposed
[1:24:39] right so I ask him when was the last
[1:24:41] time since you said you used to so when
[1:24:43] was the last time
[1:24:45] you oh just a few days
[1:24:49] ago so he was a kid of like 10 9 11
[1:24:54] and the parents don't know
[1:24:56] it no check your your children's
[1:24:59] phone no probably not don't even give
[1:25:01] them phones when they 10 years
[1:25:05] old I'm not trying to tell you how to
[1:25:07] parent your
[1:25:08] kids I'm just trying to help you through
[1:25:10] the lens of the
[1:25:13] word and it's up to you to take it or
[1:25:16] not take
[1:25:20] it amen so uh and then this thing about
[1:25:23] pornography
[1:25:26] we we're not just going to talk about
[1:25:27] the
[1:25:29] kids even the married
[1:25:32] couples and I have a quote for that I'll
[1:25:34] read that in a
[1:25:36] second it even affects people who are
[1:25:40] married people have excuses oh no
[1:25:43] because we are married we can watch
[1:25:46] stuff but I think we are all message
[1:25:49] Believers
[1:25:50] right if I if I give you my opinion you
[1:25:53] won't you won't listen
[1:25:56] let me just read you what the prophet
[1:25:58] say then it's up to you to say Amen to
[1:26:01] it or not say Amen to
[1:26:04] it so obviously the prophet did not use
[1:26:07] the word
[1:26:09] pornography but you understand what he's
[1:26:11] talking
[1:26:12] about I don't believe in filthy living
[1:26:15] among among Pentecostal
[1:26:20] people Holiness people even if they're
[1:26:23] married
[1:26:27] I don't believe in that no
[1:26:28] sir some of this dirty
[1:26:32] stuff I get in here
[1:26:35] sometimes but I mean on times I'm I'm
[1:26:38] out in California and different places
[1:26:39] like
[1:26:43] that to see a man that will try to take
[1:26:46] his little wife and dirty
[1:26:51] filthy you understand what I mean
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:26:55] and I'm sure you guys understand what it
[1:26:57] means you're all adults and I'm not
[1:27:00] going to We The Prophet did not go into
[1:27:01] details
[1:27:04] and I think you ought to be ashamed of
[1:27:07] yourself as a man of
[1:27:11] God you just be a
[1:27:13] husband be a
[1:27:17] sweetheart respect her like you always
[1:27:20] respect
[1:27:22] her don't any attention to some of these
[1:27:26] sexy
[1:27:30] books or these nonsense in these sexy
[1:27:36] books and things that you read about and
[1:27:38] all these stuff and everything like
[1:27:40] that get that filthy stuff out of your
[1:27:44] mind these are the word of Malachi
[1:27:47] 4 he did not use the word
[1:27:50] pornography but he talked about those
[1:27:52] sexy books
[1:27:54] because you know in that time television
[1:27:56] was not evolved like that they didn't
[1:27:57] even have
[1:27:58] cellones so pornography they had to
[1:28:00] print those on books and they to go
[1:28:04] buy to go buy those in stores and the
[1:28:08] prophet says that get that filthy stuff
[1:28:11] out of your
[1:28:13] mind the Bible said let let not one
[1:28:16] dirty conversation come among
[1:28:22] you you know and then ask he says you
[1:28:25] are my
[1:28:26] kids I got a right to say what I want to
[1:28:29] say you you are my kids you live
[1:28:34] right are we the kids of
[1:28:36] brother amen amen and he says if you
[1:28:39] identify as his children then he has the
[1:28:41] right you
[1:28:44] to get that dirty stuff out of your
[1:28:47] life amen
[1:28:50] amen all
[1:28:53] right so uh going back to parental
[1:28:57] delinquency I don't think I'll have time
[1:28:59] to
[1:29:00] finish but however God
[1:29:03] leads um so the prophet talks
[1:29:06] about he says and let me say this with
[1:29:09] reverence and with
[1:29:11] respect if these American mothers and
[1:29:13] fathers would put more time praying for
[1:29:15] their children like job
[1:29:21] did there will be less juvenile
[1:29:25] qu the trouble of it
[1:29:28] is our modern American mothers and
[1:29:31] fathers lead them to
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:36] drinking and to card
[1:29:39] playing and to cigarettes
[1:29:41] smoking things of that sort which makes
[1:29:45] juvenile
[1:29:48] delinquency it really isn't juvenile
[1:29:50] delinquency
[1:29:54] it's parent
[1:29:56] delinquency neglecting to come to God
[1:29:58] and find him then trouble
[1:30:02] strikes so this is the prophet
[1:30:04] addressing you the
[1:30:06] parent we just uh uh uh uh showed you
[1:30:09] how the devil is targeting your
[1:30:11] children what are you going to do about
[1:30:14] it are you the prophet is saying it's
[1:30:16] actually not even the children's fault
[1:30:18] your your
[1:30:21] fault mama's having a little innocent
[1:30:29] fun maybe their husband were home baby
[1:30:35] setting or some hired child is taking
[1:30:39] care of their
[1:30:40] [Music]
[1:30:42] children the prophet says God gave you
[1:30:44] them
[1:30:47] children to take care of them
[1:30:51] yourselves and it's your responsibility
[1:30:54] to
[1:30:55] God you want to know your responsibility
[1:30:57] as a
[1:30:58] mother the Propet is to take care of
[1:31:00] those
[1:31:03] children not not not to hire some child
[1:31:05] to take care of your
[1:31:08] kids or have your husband stay home to
[1:31:10] take care of the
[1:31:12] kids understand circumstances
[1:31:15] happen but the thing is that we have to
[1:31:17] understand what is the
[1:31:20] priority the priority shouldn't be the
[1:31:22] money that you're making at work
[1:31:26] because while while you the husband and
[1:31:27] the wife are spending so much time
[1:31:34] working and the dragon is going after
[1:31:36] your
[1:31:37] kids and the parents are not even aware
[1:31:40] of
[1:31:40] it it's your responsibility
[1:31:44] to you know we don't have juvenile
[1:31:47] delinquency we
[1:31:51] parental they want to run to bar
[1:31:54] barrooms and carry
[1:31:58] on no wonder they grow up in the
[1:32:00] neurotic
[1:32:04] age God gave you that child to raise and
[1:32:08] to take
[1:32:11] care you want a child and when God gives
[1:32:14] you that
[1:32:15] child then you you you you you just send
[1:32:18] that child to to daycare all
[1:32:20] day or you go you go work 24/7
[1:32:25] and by the time you come back home you
[1:32:26] don't even have time to to to take
[1:32:30] check the parents said parents
[1:32:35] neglecting you know you it's God gave
[1:32:38] you that child to raise
[1:32:42] and amen can we all say Amen to
[1:32:45] that amen um I'm not trying to go hard
[1:32:49] on on on you or anything like that I'm
[1:32:52] really just trying trying to help you
[1:32:54] and expose the tactic of tactic of the
[1:32:58] dev in in Exodus also we see
[1:33:01] that when um pH Pharaoh was about to let
[1:33:05] the children of Israel
[1:33:09] go God hardened his
[1:33:11] heart and they increased the
[1:33:14] labor the children of
[1:33:17] Israel right so so having too sometime
[1:33:21] working too much
[1:33:24] could also be just the devil keep trying
[1:33:26] to keep you from doing what God actually
[1:33:28] purposed for you
[1:33:33] to especially
[1:33:36] mothers because your responsibility is
[1:33:39] to raise those
[1:33:41] kids they took they took out our women
[1:33:46] stried
[1:33:48] them out y in the
[1:33:51] offices and driving Taxi
[1:33:57] cabs so in our day women doing door Dash
[1:34:02] Uber you not even women but mostly
[1:34:07] mothers and down the street where they
[1:34:10] ought to be at home behind the behind
[1:34:13] the
[1:34:16] stove cooking and fixing the
[1:34:20] dinners what is it it's a devil
[1:34:25] The Invasion is
[1:34:27] on Amen this is the prophet of
[1:34:30] God Prophet they see he in his in his
[1:34:34] days he even talking about mothers
[1:34:35] driving taxi
[1:34:40] caps you have little kids at home but
[1:34:42] you go
[1:34:44] to das Uber and then you leave your
[1:34:46] husband to take care of
[1:34:49] your the prophet says it's the
[1:34:52] devil we Call It by
[1:34:56] name like I didn't read that quote
[1:34:58] earlier but the prophet says
[1:35:00] that you have to recognize the devil and
[1:35:03] and call it by
[1:35:05] name the prophet say that it's not like
[1:35:08] for instance you say you say have
[1:35:10] cancer they tell you have cancer and
[1:35:12] then you say no I don't have
[1:35:14] cancer no the prophet said in order to
[1:35:16] overcome that
[1:35:17] cancer you must first know it's
[1:35:20] cancer you must first know it's the
[1:35:23] devil
[1:35:24] then you can overcome
[1:35:26] it we're exposing the way the devil is
[1:35:31] working the invasion is
[1:35:34] on and and it's and then it's so fitting
[1:35:37] that the prophet says this message the
[1:35:39] title is It's not invasion of the world
[1:35:41] it's invasion of the United
[1:35:46] States that's in the US that you really
[1:35:48] see women doing do das Uber more than
[1:35:52] even in Africa you know why it's the
[1:35:56] devil right well you you ought to be at
[1:35:59] home
[1:36:01] raising but so busy
[1:36:03] working and then and then you wonder why
[1:36:06] your kids are turning the way they are
[1:36:10] turning you don't even you don't even
[1:36:12] check uh their environment you don't
[1:36:14] even check who their friends
[1:36:16] are the prophet says her Daddy I'll I'll
[1:36:19] probably close very soon the prophet
[1:36:21] says her daddy walk in at night
[1:36:26] and L up his
[1:36:29] cigarette take a glass of beer and sit
[1:36:32] down and drink it mother is out
[1:36:35] throughout the
[1:36:37] daytime with a bunch of women in some
[1:36:40] card
[1:36:43] party how can you expect the child to be
[1:36:46] anything
[1:36:49] else look whatever environment you live
[1:36:52] in
[1:36:56] that's what you
[1:36:58] are so even in the
[1:37:01] house how do you like the prophet is
[1:37:03] saying that how do you expect the child
[1:37:06] to be any
[1:37:08] different when in the house the child is
[1:37:11] is growing seeing daddy and mommy
[1:37:16] fighting then to him he thinks that
[1:37:18] fighting is something
[1:37:20] normal you got to set the right
[1:37:22] environment in your heart in your
[1:37:26] homes don't blame the child for turning
[1:37:29] the way he's turning when
[1:37:34] yourself you take a little bitty
[1:37:37] girl little bitty boy put them out here
[1:37:42] let them live with
[1:37:44] somebody you take a man I can take my
[1:37:48] boy let him be out for a day with
[1:37:51] somebody
[1:37:53] and let me come
[1:37:55] in I can always tell you who he's been
[1:37:59] with watch that
[1:38:03] environment
[1:38:07] C we're dealing with the youth here
[1:38:11] right so pay attention who your your who
[1:38:14] are your children's
[1:38:20] friends in the message influence I don't
[1:38:22] have
[1:38:24] the prophet says there are two kind of
[1:38:25] there are two things that happen when
[1:38:27] you uh uh in the work that works uh with
[1:38:31] influence it's either uh you're going to
[1:38:34] influence
[1:38:35] somebody or that person is going to
[1:38:38] inflence and here the prophet is saying
[1:38:41] was environment because that
[1:38:45] spirites you know don't just let any
[1:38:47] kids be around
[1:38:49] your your
[1:38:52] children we we every one of us here
[1:38:54] carry
[1:38:56] Spirit the prophet even explains you go
[1:38:58] to a church you see like the church
[1:39:00] seems to have the spirit of the
[1:39:03] pastor and then it's like that the more
[1:39:05] you hang out with
[1:39:08] someone uh you you catch their
[1:39:12] Spirits so someone asked the prophet a
[1:39:16] question brother
[1:39:18] Bram what achievement should we let our
[1:39:21] pre-teenage children participate in
[1:39:26] [Music]
[1:39:35] how should we go about helping them
[1:39:36] select their
[1:39:43] Associates I love this message because
[1:39:46] about you know even how to help your
[1:39:49] children select
[1:39:54] now this is the prophet
[1:39:56] resp keep them in a Christian
[1:40:00] company as long as you possibly
[1:40:06] can you know when a child is at an age
[1:40:09] and I'll say as long as you you can that
[1:40:12] means like as long as they still leaving
[1:40:14] in your house you have the
[1:40:17] right to help them keep uh uh the good
[1:40:20] company
[1:40:24] if it's a girl keep her with Christian
[1:40:27] girls Christian boys vice versa and if
[1:40:31] she's old enough to go with a
[1:40:34] boy see that she keeps with the right
[1:40:37] kind of a
[1:40:42] boy discourage her to any boy
[1:40:48] otherwise if she's going with an
[1:40:50] unbeliever
[1:40:53] try to encourage her to go with a
[1:40:57] Believer notice he did not say force her
[1:41:00] to go with
[1:41:01] aie or beat her to go with
[1:41:05] aever encourage her there's a way you
[1:41:08] talk to a
[1:41:10] child to make you know um uh to make
[1:41:13] them to make them uh I think the Bible
[1:41:15] says parents do not uh upset your
[1:41:19] parents something U parents do not upset
[1:41:21] your kids
[1:41:23] I might be not quoting it exactly but
[1:41:25] something like
[1:41:26] that so there is a way parents are
[1:41:29] supposed to be talking to their
[1:41:33] kids yeah do not provoke your children
[1:41:35] thank
[1:41:36] you right so try to encourage
[1:41:39] them no hey I don't think you should
[1:41:41] hang out with this person because of
[1:41:43] this because of
[1:41:45] this why don't you try to go hang out
[1:41:48] with this
[1:41:49] person find a good way to encourage
[1:41:55] because the environment where they
[1:41:58] in
[1:42:01] matters right amen um so here the
[1:42:05] prophet
[1:42:06] says no okay this is even he's even
[1:42:09] talking about
[1:42:11] himself you wonder no okay someone said
[1:42:14] he he said Daddy if there was just some
[1:42:17] boys around
[1:42:18] there that had the Holy
[1:42:20] Ghost the prophet says you want wonder
[1:42:23] why I was I was getting away to Denver
[1:42:28] Colorado or somewhere somewhere like
[1:42:31] that get my children
[1:42:34] somewhere where there's a bunch of
[1:42:36] people who cry out to
[1:42:39] God that's what we need
[1:42:42] brother amen so the even the imagine how
[1:42:46] how powerful the prophet's Ministry
[1:42:49] was but he he still needed to make sure
[1:42:52] he kids were in the
[1:42:57] good you know get them with people that
[1:42:59] cry out to
[1:43:02] God we have some parents here their
[1:43:04] children they probably hang out with
[1:43:07] unbelievers more than they hang out
[1:43:13] with you know I think your parents you
[1:43:15] should encourage your
[1:43:17] children to go to the house of other
[1:43:20] children's
[1:43:21] Believers people cry out to God nowadays
[1:43:25] there are even youth
[1:43:26] camps know youth youth camps that's
[1:43:29] actually how God started working with
[1:43:31] me through a youth
[1:43:33] camp because when I came to the
[1:43:36] US I I mean I I backl when I came to the
[1:43:40] US because I was I was I I grew up in an
[1:43:43] environment where I was always like at
[1:43:47] home and the moment I came to the US I
[1:43:49] thought that was an opportunity for an
[1:43:51] opportunity for me
[1:43:54] to try out the
[1:43:56] world I was actually really happy about
[1:43:59] that and then and and you know I've
[1:44:01] always heard you know I came from a
[1:44:03] church where there's a lot of
[1:44:06] teachers nothing bad about that but I
[1:44:09] never really knew how real God could
[1:44:14] be and it's a long story but first 4 you
[1:44:17] know when God started dealing with me I
[1:44:20] started watching different youth camps
[1:44:25] and seeing young men and young young
[1:44:28] young young women like crying out to God
[1:44:30] for the
[1:44:32] holy and seeing the power of the Holy
[1:44:34] Ghost working through
[1:44:36] them I I've never seen anything like
[1:44:41] that you know this before I got
[1:44:44] saved I used to I used to think that God
[1:44:47] was not fair to me
[1:44:56] because I used to think that uh there
[1:44:58] are some people
[1:45:00] that they live in the world for 80
[1:45:04] years they enjoy the things of the
[1:45:08] world then at 80 they give their heart
[1:45:10] to
[1:45:12] God so why is God asking me to give him
[1:45:15] my heart
[1:45:17] now I was like let me enjoy the world
[1:45:21] first and 70 80 I'll give you my
[1:45:27] life but then when I started going to
[1:45:30] those camps the power of God working
[1:45:32] through the young
[1:45:34] people it changed my thought
[1:45:37] process now I started thinking where was
[1:45:39] I all these
[1:45:44] years where would where would I have
[1:45:47] been with God if I was already filled
[1:45:49] with the Holy Ghost since I was 10
[1:45:53] the environment plays a
[1:45:55] role when your your child is an
[1:45:57] environment where people are crying out
[1:45:59] to
[1:46:01] God the prophet says that's what we
[1:46:05] need
[1:46:08] amen amen I'll end with this thing
[1:46:11] um the next time I get an opportunity to
[1:46:17] continue I will continue God's willing
[1:46:21] there's still a lot of things that
[1:46:24] um but then I I'll end with this one
[1:46:27] here um Sam can you play that that small
[1:46:31] video of that Pale
[1:46:34] [Music]
[1:46:37] Horse so at the Olympics um two days
[1:46:42] ago there was um so the the same people
[1:46:46] that I'll show you guys the image
[1:46:48] of how they Blas The Last Supper
[1:46:54] like Satan is not even hiding
[1:46:57] anymore all right so watch this video
[1:46:59] now they doing
[1:47:02] image with a a Rider riding on a p
[1:47:09] horse just play it real
[1:47:12] quick right so this is what they're
[1:47:14] portraying to to us on the whole world
[1:47:18] watch
[1:47:20] it you see someone right on a Pale
[1:47:26] Horse we are believers of this message
[1:47:30] the prophet told us what the Pale Horse
[1:47:35] is let's go to Revelation chapter 6
[1:47:39] apocalypse 6 Sam slides can you
[1:47:44] uh Revelation 6 verse
[1:47:48] 7 so the Bible says and when he had
[1:47:51] opened the fourth
[1:47:54] SE I heard the voice of the fourth Beast
[1:47:58] say come and see and I looked and behold
[1:48:04] a Pale
[1:48:06] Horse and his name that said on him was
[1:48:10] death and Hell Followed With
[1:48:15] Him
[1:48:17] death the prophet just told us that at
[1:48:19] first it was natural
[1:48:21] death but now doing he's working
[1:48:25] spiritually and then right before that
[1:48:27] they they showed an
[1:48:29] image gay
[1:48:32] people with a
[1:48:34] child on it Satan is seeking to destroy
[1:48:38] you sat now he's not he's not hiding
[1:48:41] anymore he wants he's letting you
[1:48:45] know that there's a death angel that's
[1:48:47] going to try to
[1:48:50] kill and the prophet says that
[1:48:53] death means Eternal
[1:48:58] separation it Satan is even making a
[1:49:01] plane he's not hiding
[1:49:03] anymore why did they just choose a pale
[1:49:05] horse out of all the
[1:49:07] [Music]
[1:49:10] hores let's not be ignorant of his
[1:49:13] devic Satan is going after the bride of
[1:49:17] Christ the prophet says that this fourth
[1:49:21] seal
[1:49:22] he says that that Beast the devil turns
[1:49:25] into the
[1:49:26] beast but he says that happens after the
[1:49:31] Rapture so we know what times we're
[1:49:33] living
[1:49:35] in this death this death and Hell follow
[1:49:38] him the prophecies that's happening
[1:49:40] that's happening after the
[1:49:43] Rapture because the church will have to
[1:49:45] be raptured the bride will have
[1:49:48] to so we living in the end end days you
[1:49:51] know
