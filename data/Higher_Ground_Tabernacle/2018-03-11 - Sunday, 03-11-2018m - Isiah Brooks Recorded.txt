amen amen let's just as we stand this morning I had my heart I wanted to preach a nice uplifting message after Wednesday's message was hard it was tough it was the perfect will of God and really this message is kind of gonna be kind of part two of Wednesday's amen but this is the direction the Lord wanted to go so let's just open our Bibles let's open up to Exodus chapter Ezekiel chapter 14 we'll read again the scripture from last Wednesday we just want to be right Saints amen this it's worth it amen it's worth finding the right way amen amen this is the Scripture we read Wednesday night says Ezekiel chapter 14 starting with the fourteenth or with the first verse and it says then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me and set before me and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man these men have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face should I be inquired of all by them therefore speak unto them and say unto them thus saith the Lord God every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart and put us the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the Prophet I the Lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols amen that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart because they are all estranged from me through their idols a man let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for your precious word father Lord it is our desire to be exactly the state that you had in your mind when you died on Calvary father Lord whatever it is that you paid for when you died on Calvary we desire that in our lives Lord we want to our goal is to attain by your spirit father every single thing that you have purchased Lord the the whole inheritance father not lacking in any one thing but a perfect bride Lord that is waiting for her husband Lord without spot without wrinkle Lord and it's in that atmosphere and in that thinking Lord that we read these scriptures are smart and father Lord I pray Lord that you would search our hearts father to be any wicked way inside of us just point out Lord and we'll all repent of it we'll make it right Lord but because lo we want to be right father Lord if we do right we think right Lord we follow the leadership of your Holy Ghost Lord we know they'll come out right and we thank you Father for all things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen a man and you can be seeing a preacher message called hardness of heart fallow ground and a seared conscience amen amen as we read Wednesday you know the children of Israel the elders of Israel they were living in Babylon they've been placed there for their sins when this scripture was written and pray been maybe 14 15 years since a guy into captivity they were living there in captivity there 500 miles away from their place of worship 500 miles away from the temple that Jehovah gave them 500 miles away from where all the sacrifices and the priesthood and all those things there there are a long ways off from the things that God it's set in order and the ways that God had placed from it amen God had given them a land by His mercy in His grace and said this is the land I have promised you this is where I want you to live this is where I want you to worship me this is where I want you to meet me face to face and this is the land I want to meet you in but their sins and their iniquities had taken them out of the land that God had provided them their sins and their iniquities had taken them away from the place from the orders from the habits God had set up things them clean had setup had set up a habitual sacrifices habits seasons and and and and holidays to end times they could keep the place clean all these things were done for a purpose they are done after our pattern that the children of Israel as they worship their God that there were sings that there was a procedure set in place that the people would stay clean amen by the by the constant sacrifices by the constant meetings of the Lord of gathering together underneath the Passover once again every year every year recognizing all over again the blood sacrifice recognizing what the lamb had done for them amen recognizing the glory of God and him and his majesty as he was high and lifted up in the high and the holiest of holies amen and as a man was dedicated to to take the sacrifice and to cut into a place upon the mercy seat there for their sins amen as they had that the Word of God inside that inside the Ark of the Covenant those tablets of stone written with God's own finger a man they revered that and they placed the blood there if there's anything if they have done contrary to what was written upon those stones that the blood placed on mercy seat would cover that over a man so so that their sins could be forgiven but by going into captivity they lost all of that all those systems all those all those things that Jehovah himself had put in place to keep them clean so they could visit with him face to face everything they've been put in place so they can meet Jehovah it all bits up the way now the here there are 500 miles away and as they go to bed tonight they here the worship services going to another god amen they could hear the the priests as they got as they could hear the foreign gods revival going down the street amen of all the babylonian ish gods you know of all the babylonian ish worship services all the all the things that the the worshipers of the gods of Babylon would do in the streets and in the and the foreign temples now those things are constantly in their eyes and in their ears and how can they stay clean Amen how can they keep their ways how can they keep keep going away the Jehovah require they've lost all of that amen so in the when the elders of the house of Israel a Wednesday they come unto the prophet and they want to approach unto the prophet and find out what should we do we know that we've lost something that we should not have lost amen we know that we've done something what should we do and they want to approach under the Prophet to find the way back to find out what is the way back to Jehovah amen but when they approach under the Prophet because they because they're because they're placing everything upon somebody else amen instead of looking inwardly at their own selves of their own natures they're going to go unto the prophet and the Prophet is going to answer all of their problems they're going to go and choir the Prophet the Prophet will acquire the Lord and he'll tell them some sweet thing that they can listen to but when they approach under the prophet Ezekiel he says the Laura comes them unto them now thus the elders of the house appeal to come and they sit down before the prophet just like it says we're all sitting here this this morning so they come and they sit down and and the Lord all sudden comes and brings a word so as they're sitting there God is talking to his property and saying these men are approaching unto you thinking that they are going to be able to talk to me through you but yet they've approached unto you with the stumbling block of their own iniquity and all their sins as before their face and and the Lord says should I even be inquired of at all by them when they even take care of this amen these are the same men they would like to approach right into the holiest of Holies if they could a man they'd like to go right into the holiest of Holies but what they don't realize is that what was in the holiest of Holies was the Word of God inside the Ark of the Covenant amen the whole purpose the whole thing their worship ringing tortes was the Word of God they've been placed inside that Ark of the Covenant amen God's stones he'd written with his own finger of the commandments of the Lord amen but when they but when they approach unto the prophet of the Most High God they have all the things that they've done contrary to what was written on those stones standing before their face amen blocking the way to Jehovah amen and the Lord says should I be inquired of them all at all he says therefore because they came this way because they didn't take care of it first because they thought they could approach unto Jehovah and meet me face-to-face with the sins still in place I will answer them according to their sins that means they're coming to the house of judgment with no cover amen and no one wants to be in that place none of us wants to go unto the judgment house of the Lord Jesus Christ to go into the judgment house without the blood of Christ covering our sins amen and the only way we can ever have the blood of Christ to cover all of our sins is that by the Holy Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ to go down on to the inside of the heart amen to search the heart out a man and to find those things that are contrary to him and when the certain when the Spirit does the searching amen and when he does the identifying amen then when he and when he can fix you then you can make a proper repentance of your sins Amen but if the Holy Spirit cannot identify those things if there's some preventing the Holy Spirit from identifying those things then we approach under the Lord with our sins still remaining then we are approaching into judgment not unto the Prince of Peace a man we want where our goal is to approach and see his face in peace but instead we see his face and anger how can we when our sins remain amen so just here I only go through a few scriptures here as I said the title the message to this morning was hardness of heart the fallow ground and the seared conscience so let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 3 Hebrews chapter 3 start with the seventh verse start seven wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if you'll hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your father has tempted me and proved me and saw my works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do alway err in their hearts they have not known my ways so I swear my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end Amen amen the warning there the warning wasn't just coming from st. Paul but the warning there was coming from the Holy Spirit himself amen as the Holy Ghost saith today if you hear his voice harden not your hearts a man all of us you know we rejoice in this message we rejoice in the things we've been given by the prophet of our day we want to approach unto the prophet william branham approach unto his message approach unto the tapes and learn what they have to say but if we approach under those tapes and we find something in there those tapes that we just can't seem to approach unto a man something that we just don't want to obey something that we can't see or we always you know brother BAM says this and we always seem to go over here and do this then we are and we don't repent of that we are hardening our hearts why because because as we come to the Prophet as we come in what the Holy Ghost is saying for our day and then we go and we go and we do something contrary to what the message was then we are hardening our hearts amen and how can we have rest he said there that your father's tempted me and proved me saw my works for 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation said they always do err in their heart and they have not known my ways so I swear my wrath they shall not enter into my rest amen and the rest when he rose is the rest of the Holy Ghost amen no way we can seek the rest of the Holy Ghost is that when the voice of God comes when the voice of God comes and tells us something that we ought to do amen then we ought not to harden our hearts against what the voice says Amen we ought to be quick amen quick to obey what the voice says amen to search our lives out and say Lord if there is anything contrary I don't want to why because we don't want God to be grieved with us amen I think every father every mother in here knows what is like for your children to grieve amen when you give out the word this is what I want done and you give out I want you to do this this and this and when you come home and the everything was done in half way nothing was done wholeheartedly you know nothing was done with intent of obedience hey man that's the key there if if you're gonna or we going to Oh the law of wait obey the Lord either with the intent of going of in medians or we're gonna obey the Lord with the intent of getting by with as much as we possibly can and we know what we know which one of those two will be accepted in his sight amen only following the word of the peace of God through obedience through a desire to obey the Lord Jesus Christ and his entire work can we actually approach under this Holy Spirit amen both we approach unto the Lord with a to see how much we can get away with maybe maybe you know I don't know if this is actually a really actually a sin or not it's in that gray zone I don't know if I can get away with this or not I'm gonna do this or this even though you know the word says this but maybe it doesn't actually mean that how are we ever gonna approach and have the revival of the Holy Ghost day by day on the inside when we oh we our own children will testify Amen how they can grieve us how much more do we grieve the Holy Ghost when we try to get well away with as much as we possibly can amen and Sue by doing that you put in your heart amen and when a man hardens his heart then God cannot do anything with that amen God can I lead that man God cannot come down and bring the revival the the relationship with the Lord stops right there why because you have grieved the Holy Spirit and you have hardened your heart you've sealed it away from the Word of God growing and so on the inside of your heart amen the word of the God is a seat and weight goes into your heart if your heart be prepared it will grow up and produce everything that gospel says amen amen brother Brahim said that the the true church will write a book of Acts behind it amen every true church will write another book of Acts behind it amen and well how do they do that why because the word grows it's not by their own desire eenz it's not by their own askings it's not by their own workings but it's by allowing the Holy Spirit and the word to grow inside a heart that has been prepared a man it does not happen in a has been hard it will not happen when a man has constantly consistently disobeyed the Word of God disobeyed the the revealed word for this hour and that the Word of God cannot grow in that therefore the book of Acts cannot be written in that heart amen why because the heart has been hardened and the seed which is the Word of God will not grow amen so in a heart now what do we do when a heart has been hurt amen you know Jesus said we said when it came and asked him about divorce I said you know you you Moses allowed that through the hardness of your hearts but from the beginning it wasn't so but because of the hardness of your hearts Moses he Moses wanted to go the straight and narrow but he hit the road block and that road block would not move all that Jehovah said all the his prophets said that road block would not move and Moses had to go around it amen which was not but from the beginning divorce was not so a man what and what caused that that road block was the hardness of the heart amen and every single one of us has the potential for having a road block in your life where all sudden God wants to go through and do this he hits the roadblock and you cannot go any further in your walk with Christ amen and you cannot go any further why you've stopped upon your spiritual life's journey why because you can know because the Holy Spirit wants to go this way and the Holy Spirit won't always make a detour for you amen you know you think well long ago the permissive will of God sometimes God would just leave you you want to all want to just do the permissive will say the perfect will I've got the Holy Spirit we'll just take us fight a man and then where will you be you'll be off wondering how do I get back to where I used to do how do I get back to when I first met Christ I wish I could worship God like I used to I wish I could serve God like I used to I wish I could be a witness I wish I could fellowship with the believers I wish I could fill a ship because you know because hardness of heart will break up true fellowship amen you cannot properly fellowship this is like when I had leprosy in the Old Testament amen when a man had leprosy he had to separate himself from the camp a man if he saw somebody there was clean he had he had to yellow i'm unclean i'm unclean stay away from me i'm unclean why because the leprosy caused aspiration a man when you harden your hearts then a multitude of sins began to rise enough a man and the Holy Spirit no longer has the ability to convict you of all your sins amen so therefore the sin remains not taken care of by the blood amen and so near in your hole your spirit is crying out like like leprosy it's cry your spear is crying out stay away from me stay away from me I'm unclean I'm unclean I'm in clean you cannot have true fellowship with the believers amen and as the Bible says iron sharpens iron you lose the benefits of all those things why because your own heart has been hardened and you're now unclean amen amen amen you know when when Christ rise let's turn over to mark chapter 16 real quick I do have a lot of scriptures so I hope you all like the Bible mark chapter 16 we'll read from the fourteenth verse I want you to let's just think about it right around the time of Jesus's ministry what all their desires their hopes and dreams were you know as they were with all the way their nation was put under bondage to the Romans and and they were looking for a messiah and all of a sudden and their Messiah shows up on the scene amen the gospel is being fulfilled all all all the promises of the Old Testament are being are coming to fruition and they're seen Scripture after scripture after scripture being fulfilled and here's their Messiah three and a half years the disciples they walk with them and they and their see miracle after miracle and they're realizing that this their Lord Jesus Christ can do anything at any amen they didn't they hang out with him and they're being protected amen they're being washed over Jesus Christ is watching over his disciples and there is a joyous time those three and a half year period of time was a joyous time to wear the everything they had neither was taken care of by Jesus hey no matter what they need if they if they needed food he could multiply the food they go watch as the sick were healed and as a revival the Pharisees would come and and try to do this to him do that to him and they would just somehow escape and everything was taken care of why because their proximity to the Lord Jesus Christ how close they were amen as long as they stayed close to the Lord Jesus Christ he took Aaron they knew they he was their Messiah amen and what confusion it threw them into when he died upon the cross amen even though it says there in the Bible that there came a point in time the last year was life where he began to tell them this is what's going to happen this is what we're looking forward to this is what's going to happen and yet they were but the problem was is their heart was still hard no matter how close their proximity was to Lord Jesus Christ their heart was still hardened to believe that he was the sacrifice for their sins to believe all and he was telling him I am gonna die I am gonna be put it to death on the cross and all those things their hearts was hardened a man so when he died and he adult given them the promise I will rise again amen let's read mark chapter 16 fourteenth verse says and afterward he appeared unto the leaven i Sisko the ninth verse it says now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first unto Mary out of whom he cast Seven Devils and then going to verse 12 after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it under the residue neither believing they then verse 14 afterwards he Jesus appeared under the leaven as they set at me and up in them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believe not which had seen him after he was risen everything that they had hoped for and dreamed for for these three and a half years was coming to fruition but because of the hardness of their heart was preventing them from seeing a man they were living in the time of the fulfilled scripture this ship in a time of rejoicing and joy and and the glory of God and and all those things and everything think about what the where they were living how many of us right now would like to go back and live be right in that moment in time oh my how many of us if if for $1,000 we could go back and live out that day with the disciples who would sign up or there's ten thousand dollars who would sign up a man we could borrow we could do everything I have to make payments on it the rest of our lives but it would be worth it justice just to be there to experience that may be a joy as a joyous day but they were missing out on that because of their hardness of their hearts hey man when they first see Christ after his resurrection his first words have to be words of rebuke why because their hardness of their hearts was preventing them from having fellowship one with another and fellowship with him amen and the same thing happens in the Church of the God when the hardness of our hearts prevents us through our uncleanness from having fellowship one with another and fellowship with him why our spirits as we walk through the church are crying out like a leper I'm unclean I'm unclean stay away from me I'm unclean amen amen now let's turn over let's let's look at the fallow ground for a while you're familiar with that Amen let's go to hosea chapter 10 familiar with the fallow ground that's the ground farmer he wants to go plant a seed but the ground has been sitting there during the cold winter season it's it's baked by the Sun maybe through the dry season or whatever it is and the ground has now been hardened and there is no way for them to get back to get back to get back to the point where seed can be sown until first they break up the ground amen so let's read here Jose a chapter hosea chapter 10 will will read the twelfth verse it says so to yourselves and righteousness reap and mercy break up your fallow ground for it is time to seek the Lord till he come and reign righteousness upon you amen so what's he saying here he's saying it's time the time has now arrived it's time to seek the Lord a man I think ain't all of us can agree it's time to seek the Lord a man we we know we we don't know actually how close it is to the time of the end we know that as close we've heard the prophecies for the last 50 years 60 years we've seen how what was come to pass we've seen it all come to hat we know that it's time to seek the Lord what does he say they say that it's then if you're going to seek the Lord you have to so yours to yourselves and righteousness so you can reap in mercy who would like to reap I think about reaping in mercy in the last day who at the very last day before the coming of Lord Jesus Christ was still like to start right reaping mercy amen waitwait or on the day of the rapture who would like to reap some mercy amen the merton the rapture is mercy Amen is the fruition of mercy but order to wreak mercy you have to sow in righteousness amen in order to sow in righteousness you have to break up the follow ground amen your car your heart cannot be hurt Amen let's let's turn back to Jeremiah chapter 4 it is time to seek it's time to seek the Lord tell he come and reign righteousness upon you a man because the rains gonna come but cane your heart receding Jeremiah chapter 4 verse 1 and it says if that will if that will return o Israel saith Lord return unto me if that will put away thine abominations out of my sight then thou shalt not remove and I shall swear the Lord liveth and truth and judgment and righteousness and the nations shall bless themselves in him and in him shall they glory for thus saith the Lord God or thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem break up your fallow ground and so not among the thorns circumcise yourselves to the Lord and take away the foreskins of your heart you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem bless my fury come forth like fire and burned that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings amen so break up your fallow ground and don't sow among the thorns where Jesus said they sowed amongst the thorns and as soon as the series of growing was grown up the Thrones because of the cares of this life choked them a man their heart was hardened towards the gospel but was alive towards the world amen therefore the thrones the thorns they are there sown in the wrong spot even what do you say what's the answer here the answer is break up your fallow ground amen break up what is breaking up the fellow ground it's getting to a position in your life where you can receive the full word of God amen getting into a position that's where you get down before the Lord and you and you you say Lord I'm not where I ought to be amen I'm not in a condition to receive your word I'm not in a condition for your word to come and be sewn in my life amen I know what the gospel says I know what it says about about overcoming life in the spirit I know what it says about a bride a spot or wrinkle but yet my life is not in imposition to fulfill those scriptures then you guys from ground breaking to do Amen when you when you can look when you take an honest look at your life and then you look at the scriptures to say she'll be without spot and without wrinkle and you look at the scripture and says that she will those that are led by the Spirit amen amen you know and all those scriptures about the leadership of the Holy Ghost I mean you look at your life and those and you can identify those scriptures living and moving in your life amen then your your ground has been your heart amen and it cannot receive the word therefore you gotta break up your fallow ground are you gonna do you got to humble yourself before God and stand repent and say Lord I've completely ruined your plan of salvation for my life I've completely ruined because the path of salvation for us is for our spirit to move out of the way and make room for the Holy Spirit to come and live through our lives amen but he will not do that if the ground cannot produce the Word of God amen if you cannot reproduce the Word of God and all of his promises in your life then your ground has been hardened amen and you must come back here and submit yourself before God and break up the fallow ground amen amen break up your fallow ground and so not among the thorns circumcise yourself to the Lord and take away the foreskins of your heart amen amen now let's turn over to first Timothy chapter 4 start with the first verse here is a holy spirit given prophecy for our day so it's worth looking at amen and following 2nd or 1st Timothy first Timothy chapter 4 verse 1 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter days or in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron amen so according to the Holy Spirit what he is prophesied then in the last days there'll be people they'll be in the faith they'll believe in the message of their hour a mean they'll be believing what the Spirit says for this day and the whole sudden a seducing Spirit is going to come across their path a man and that spirit is going to tell them a lie it's going to tell them to do something contrary to the word they meant it's gonna tell them - you can you can get away with doing this you can get away with doing that I know the word says this but this spirit is going to come and try to seduce you that even though the word says this you can go off over here and do this a seducing spirit what is it doing its seducing you away from the word just like the devil seduced Eve away from the word amen Eve Adams bride was seduced away from the word that he gave her now Christ has a bride and there's that same spirit is here to seduce you away why so he can make you fall away ripe for the rapture the same way eat it amen and so the some sheldon's now some that are in the faith in the last days the Holy Spirit prophesized so it's gonna come to pass no matter what the some shall depart from the faith giving heed to that what they're doing giving heed their obeying seducing spirits and the doctrines of devils amen what are doctrines of devils it's when the devil comes and he gives you a scripture or he gives you something that that looks scriptural that gives you an excuse not to obey the full Word of God a scriptural reason a scriptural twisting to not obey the full Word of God that's when you take a scripture you say well I can do this because of this wit but when you know in your mind that the rest of the scripture is not in agreement with how you are Satan is twisting the Scriptures amen it's a your own personal pet doctrine amen amen it's just like saying well well David got away with doing this with Bathsheba therefore I can get away with doing this with Bathsheba that is a doctrine of the Devils it's a seducing spirit that's telling you to do something contrary to the gospel amen amen and then in this prophesied that that will come to pass in the last days therefore it's going to happen that means we ought to watch out for it amen and then those in once the once that happen see you get down to verse two you're speaking lies in hypocrisy amen I'm your conscience seared with a hot iron what is that it's when you're you know that were hypocracy it means an actor amen some of us acting out of play amen it's like coming to church and acting like you're worshiping God when your heart is crying out I'm unclean I'm unclean I'm unclean amen you come to church day in dare you say you sing these great songs that we sing of worship towards Christ but you're not taking care of the things that are in your heart that's hypocrisy you're acting like a worshiper of Jesus Christ but your heart is far from him amen and Jesus said get you away from me your heart you are far from me I never knew you go you into the weak and wailing and gnashing of teeth amen so what this they become an actor in church so there are their whole testify they're speaking lies when they sing the songs they're speaking lies what they lay have their hands on the sick they're speaking lies when they when they when they when they try to fellowship with a believer why because they're testifying that they're living united with Christ when they're actually living United with the devil amen why because they gave heed to the seducing spirits therefore their conscience gets seared with a hot iron amen the their conscience that was their conscience it's where the Holtz has a place or he can come into your heart and convict you and tell you you shouldn't do that you shouldn't do this that's wrong you you did caught you you disagree or disobedient to the Lord amen what's he doing he's convicting you I want to Satan do the seducing spirit comes with a hot iron when you're disobedient to that conviction and he Sears that place with a hot iron now you can't feel the Holy Spirit you're past feeling amen you know no matter how many times the Holy Spirit comes to convict you now you can no longer recognize the conviction of the Holy Spirit your past feeling you've given over to Satan and the seducing spirits now you can no longer be in obedience to the Holy Spirit amen that's when you start keeping sin upon sin upon sin amen it's just like when Satan when he when he convinces you to go to the first inch there's a thousand more inches past that one Amen that you can go down and when you get that you get to that thousand since you look back and think all I did was that and but look what it led to why because you gave in to the seducing spirit amen amen let's turn organize a chapter 42 Isaiah 42 will read from 22nd verse it says but this people but this is a people robbed and spoiled they are all of them snared in Holts they are all hid in prison houses they are for a prey and none delivereth therefore a spoil and none saith restore who among you will give ear to this who will hearken it here for the time to come who gave Jacob for a spoil in Israel to the robbers did not the Lord who against who we have sinned for they would not walk in his ways neither were they obedient unto his law therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger the strength of battle and has set him on fire round o yet he knew it not and it burned him yet he laid it not to heart think about that God is pouring out his upon him the fury of his anger the strength of battle and set him on fire roundabout but yet he didn't know it why didn't he know it his conscience had been seared with a hot iron it again even his eyes have been blinded he can no longer see what his spiritual condition is he's in danger of hellfire amen this man is in danger of going to hell but yet he won't allow himself his eyes of inviting he can no longer see this man is in a bad place amen amen the because God can no longer get through him even even has the strength of battle up on him that means the Devils are raging all around the walls are broken down amen unclean animals and going into the holy place you know Satan could come in and do anything he wants in your life and you don't even realize how bad off you are and how close you are to the separating life amen that's a bad place to be in amen you know it's just like we had preached a mess a while back called worshipping the enemies gods you know and when Joe Hova brought them into the promised land he said I will break I'll bring out I'll kick out the enemy little by little I'm gonna drive them out land as you take footsteps he I will give you possession and little by little the gods be driven out but it but if they remain they will be a snare unto you they bent and you know because the enemy he is gonna seek to give glory to his own if the enemy makes inroads into his life he's gonna seek to give glory into himself amen and so and so you'll have the as we said the enemies worship services going on your life as the enemy is now using you to give glory unto himself you who were bought with a price and then you were just like Samson Samson Samson was risen up to destroy the Philistines and God gave him great power and might to destroy the Philistines but he became ensnared by the very thing that he was risen up to defeat amen and we're here to defeat Laodicea we're here to overcome all the wiles of the enemy amen we're over here to overcome everything that Satan would do in this day all the lukewarmness but yet how many of us are ensnared right now in lukewarmness amen God roses up here in Des Moines to be a church or the Most High God be overcomers in our day to be the to be those in the City of Des Moines area in this area to where we've been we're set here to be those that overcome lukewarm as a man and everything that's mentioned in Revelation chapter 3 amen but if we who were sent here to overcome lukewarmness become lukewarm then how can there be a witness in the city the very thing we're risen up to defeat all sudden became a snare to us Amen wife by the lukewarmness by the cares of this life amen they were when they went to the promised land they were given several respond four distinct responsibilities or three distinct responsibilities one was you shall make no covenant with them or their gods you shall make no covenant with them or their gods a man in our day we should make no covenant with with the temptations of the enemy amen ooh when you when you make the decision when Satan comes in tempts you and you say I'm going to ignore the word I'm gonna go obey this temptation that you're making a covenant with the enemy you're striking hands with the enemy you're you're you're shaking hands with the enemy while ignoring what the Word of God says amen and we look back at them and think how could they do that to their promised land maybe it's so easy for us to look back at them and say how could they do this how could they do that why couldn't they listen to Moses why couldn't they listen to Joshua and yet we come and we do the same thing in our day why because we shake hands with the enemy amen amen the second one is they shall not live with you lest they make you sin against me amen that means you watch what comes in your house amen you watch what comes in your house how do things come into your house they come into the house by people to visit you amen they come to your house buy by the spirits and the members of your household they come into a buy by television or by internet or by cellphone these are the things that come into our house you know and and we and so we have to be on guard over these things that if they're coming into our house we watch like oh I recognize that that was contrary to the scripture our houses are supposed to be a house of peace a house of rest a house where God's Word has the preeminence amen remember the threefold purpose that in the Christ the mystery of God is a real brother and said the three full purpose of the manifestation of Jesus Christ in this hour was one to manifest Jesus Christ perfectly a perfect manifestation of Jesus Christ in this hour that Christ might be revealed in his fullness and when the second was that once Christ is revealed that he'd have the preeminence in the bride amen that wants Christ is fully revealed that Christ will have the preeminence in every step of our lives amen and the third of the three purposes was to restore Eden that that Eve go back to her original position or fellowship with her husband the second Adam Amen that the bride can go back to her original position of fellowship with the second Adam that Christ has a place of fellowship where we ought to be a place where we ought to dwell there's a final purpose of current the revelation of Jesus Christ on this earth is that we could be restored back to that place of fellowship amen but when the enemies are in the land when we're not taking care of our households we are we are going into bondage contrary and being handcuffed so we can't even approach unto the purpose that God has for this hour amen he says and and the he also said if you serve their gods they will be a snare unto you amen and you must obey the Angels voice whatever messenger sent to you you must obey his voice those are the three things that God gave them when they came into the promise and he shall make no covenant with them or their gods you shall not they shall not live with you less they make you sin against me and you shall obey the Angels voice amen that's the that when they went into their promised land those were the conditions that they went in under amen when we enter into the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost those are the conditions that we enter into amen that we will obey the voice of the angel amen we will watch what comes into our homes amen and we all and we will make no covenant with them or if they're gods they shall not live with us amen otherwise it will be a snare into us amen you know one thing for sure no Egyptian slaves are going to enter into his promise linked a man slavery's by the viola a man let's turn over to Romans chapter 8 we'll start with the first verse there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen who would like to be in that condition amen no condemnation nothing can condemn you nothing can be found your life cannot be touched by anything why because you are completely under the law how do we get there amen we have to be in Jesus Christ amen the only way to be in Christ as we fill with his spirit amen he and us us and him amen and then once we're filled with the spare what do we do we don't walk after the flesh the desires are /wel we walk after the spirit amen there's gotta be some loose and there's some learning that goes with that amen you can't just walk in the spirit on day one there's a learning process you know as you you you stumble here you stumble there you walk in the spirit but one thing you do there is no excuse amen day in day out what does the spirit do and when you feel the spirit get grieve you're like Oh Lord make it right Oh Lord make it right why because you don't want your conscience to be seared hey man you're doing your ground to be hard amen amen for the law of the spirit of cry life and Curt Jesus for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus have made me free from the law of sin and death let's go to verse 4 that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they they're after the spirit the things of the Spirit for be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace sometimes I think that we don't put enough strength on the the word death in these scriptures you know what is death he's not talking about death of this body he's talking about eternal everlasting separation from our guy and sometimes we just go over these scriptures so quickly but he said that to be carnally minded his death separated from God carnally minded yeah we the Holy Spirit is not optional you know I grew up with that sense in my life that the Holy Spirit is optional you know that you know I don't know if that's how it was preached but that's how I received it when I was living in denomination you know you you grow up you get baptized you confess your sins if you want some more power in your life you might consider getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost maybe he'll make you speak in tongues you know that was that's how I grew up but let but let me tell you the Holy Spirit is not optional it's not optional we have to have the living moving breathing presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives we have to have the Holy Spirit and with his evidence of the hoist Baron was the evidence of the horse spirit as it makes you an obedience to the word it drives you toward the revealed word for this hour amen the Holy Spirit of God will drive you to the revealed word for this hour that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost amen and so when you when you when you find yourselves living contrary to the real Word of God for this hour and how can you say I am living day by day in the spirit and when especially when you know that to live contrary to that is death amen amen let's go down to the 13th verse for if you live after the flesh he shall die but if he through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live amen so if you just go through life casually half Hazzard Lee and live after the things of the flesh you're going to die it's going to happen that's a prophecy of the scripture amen you live through this life halfway just living according to the flesh you're going to die but if not not if hear it now watch you could take this if you take out the spirit out of this verse you you you could live through this and mortify the deeds of the body and learn how to be a good person you're still gonna die but if he through the spirit amen that's what that's why you have the open channels a mint you have a place where the Holy Spirit can come and convict you your hollow your Hut your fallow ground has been broken up a mangaka Rania's righteousness down upon you and through the spirit your mortifying the deeds of the flesh why because the Holy Spirit has a pathway that he can come and talk to you amen if that pathway is blocked up then you can't fulfill the scripture amen but but in the only way that we're gonna live is is if we do fulfill the scripture why because we all have to mortify the deeds of the body the only way we can do it is through the spirit amen that's the only way to life Paul says ye shall live if you do this if we don't do it we'll die it's the only way to life amen verse 14 for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God only the sons of God are going to heaven if you're not a son of God you're not going to heaven only the sons of God are going to heaven amen and so to be a son of God you have to be led by the Spirit of God and that requires an open channel a man without the open channel you cannot be led by the Spirit amen verse 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you've received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father there's a spirit that wants to come into us that makes us a dog brings us to adoption Amen that's where we're no longer waffling we're no longer we've gotten good at mortifying the deeds of our flesh amen therefore and when you get good at mortifying the deeds of the flesh through the spirit you get good at obeying the spirit you're good at walking in the spirit you've learned how to walk in his channels walk in his ways walk after his righteousness then he can come forth and put you and place you in the kingdom this is where you sit this is where you stand this you're given a portion of the Holy Spirit where you can act you live you move you have your being and him you've been placed in the kingdom all of heaven is behind your words that come out of your mouth amen when you lay it your hands on the sick they shall recover amen the book of Acts will be written behind your life why because you've been adopted into the kingdom amen and if a thing comes upon this life here we cry father father I need this is where I need why because you know where your sustenance comes from amen verse 16 for the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with them we shall also be glorified together amen well how did how did Christ suffer he suffered 33 years being tempted by the devil amen and then he finally his body was crucified on the cross what do we do we suffer we suffer through the temptations amen temptations are going to come but we have to suffer with Christ through the temptations amen and crucify our own flesh and die with him as he died on the cross amen that's how we have mortify our body hey man let's go back a couple chapters to Romans chapter 6 just hearing as we get it ready to close I hope this is clearly a Saints Amen hardness of heart break up the fallow ground and a seared conscience Romans chapter 6 verse 1 what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not don't you know know ye not that so many of us were baptized as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so also we should walk in newness of life amen Sawyer we did well what do we do so many of us as were baptized who in this room was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen when you were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you're testifying I am dead to sin I am dead to the things of the flesh when Satan comes to tempt me I'm gonna say no that's what we testified in baptism and what God and God said that where two or three are green touching any one thing what you bind on the earth I'll bind it in the heavens amen so went or in the water or green that you are dead to your sins you're dead to the past you're dead to the way you used to live God says what you bound on the earth I'll bind in the heaven and I'm gonna say my Holy Ghost down to make sure that you come follow through with your word amen so therefore just as much as we died with Christ through baptism amen we'll be rised up from the dead by the glory of the Father just like Christ rose up now how did Christ right Christ he rose up he was shining he meant he he rose up he went up into heaven amen he rose up in the glory of the Father all all of his body amen was filled with the Holy Ghost and he walked up and walked out and he went up to heaven amen and the same glory that was upon Christ to quicken his mortal body as the same glorious to come into us it is the living moving breathing holy spirit amen amen amen amen now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him amen amen let's let's go down to verse 11 likewise reckon ye also yourselves dead to be dead indeed to son to sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord it's our duty amen that's that's why we're here amen if we're doing something different we're doing it wrong amen and and we cannot look forward to the life of Christ amen verse 12 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body they should obey it in the lusts thereof neither yield ye or members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as unto those that are alive from the dead and he members and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God for sin shall not have dominion over you amen amen let's just stand amen we we're trusting in the slain lamb Saints amen but the Lord has caused us to walk after righteousness how does he do it by the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen but if any of us has a hardened heart a heart whose ground cannot receive the word of the Lord or a seared conscience where God cannot convict us amen and you how can you go to heaven I mean it's serious Saints Amen it's not something to play with you know sin is not innocent amen sin is not harmless amen it's not to be played with a man as brother Brown says you know two men were has stagecoach from one town to the next town and and then second town was up in the mountains and the one man said I can get you up there as faster than anybody I can get within an inch of the of the of the of the side of the trail and not fall off and and I'll get you there faster than anybody else here and the other man says you know you know I may not be as fast as the other man all right but I believe in playing it safe I maybe I could do as good as that man but I'm not gonna try it amen I hugged the I hug the cliff and I make sure that all the way up we're gonna make it there we're not going to fall off because the goal is to make it there amen and that's our goal is not to get there trying to see how much we can get away with how much soon we can do but our goal is to see how close to Christ we can get how much we can live by His Holy Spirit the only way we can do it is if we've broken up the fall ground amen only way if we've if we've broken up our hardened heart amen if our seared conscience can be healed amen let's just break heavenly father you've been so faithful Lord to speak to us Lord and Lord as you said to us and zekiel follow that how can we approach unto you if we keep the stumbling block of iniquity before our face but lord I pray father to these Lord if you could if he may here be blind or or afar off that right now somehow you could by your Holy Spirit pierce through the darkness like you did of the air back when you said the the earth had become form void and formless Lord and the Holy Spirit broke through the darkness and began creating things anew Lord Lord you've done before and father I pray father be by in this room that is in this condition father they're so far from the Spirit of God Lord that they're piling up sin after sin Lord though they may have been baptized though they may have done this or that Lord but they're living in sin contrary to the life of Christ that's somehow Lord you can pierce the darkness father Lord and that the dart the blinded eyes could be made see Lord or because you're you came to set the captives free father you came to speak those they're in prison come out Lord you came to make the lame walk and the blind to see father Lord I pray that you'd come into this room right now Lord and do the same father Laura their affair be anybody here the bound and sin Lord that you set the captives free father and we can only do it father by the conviction of the Holy Ghost Lord when you break through to us Heavenly Father I just thank your father for it Lord I we just turned the entire service in your hands father trusting in the conviction of the Holy Ghost and always thank you Laura for all things and the name of Jesus Christ we pray Amen god bless here brother Isaac if you come amen the altar is open if there's there's anybody here who has been bound and sinned if there's something this sermon that has identified your position in your life and you realize that you're not walking tour life but you're walking towards death a man let me tell you that you need to stop you need to stop right where you're at you are not promised tomorrow event none of us has promised another minute Amen if you are if you yourself are walking towards death Amen are walking towards the dead things of this life if you're if you can't tell me if you can't come up here and give me the testimony that you're living in overcoming life in Jesus Christ being led by the Holy Spirit then let me tell you saying you're not living up to the challenge of this hour you're not living up to the challenge of the hour you're living underneath your privileges and be worse than that you're living in the Laodicean age contrary outside the camp contrary to what God has promised for this hour amen and then it's time for us to stop amen time for us to cease going the wrong way amen and turn our hearts Jesus God has said throughout history if anybody would turn their hearts towards me if anybody is wayward be buddies out of the way all the guy do is just turn their hearts towards me and humble themselves and pray and I am repent of their wicked ways I Lord will hear them from heaven and I will heal their land and deliver them from their wickedness amen I'll set them free I'll come and restore I will restore saith the Lord God always has a way back amen but always takes us to in the midst of our blindness in the midst of our prison chains to first turn our eyes towards God and can repent of our sins and say Lord I've done wrong lord I repent Laura I'm gonna make it right Laura forgive me and go and stay there until he's done something for you stay there intellicus because we were not in a day where we can get by on a dry diet confession a mint we're not in a day where we can get by with just a dry diet confession amen repentance as a gift from God and amen and it can only be given by God amen we cannot make ourselves repent we can try we can set ourselves in position but ultimately for repentance is only given by God a man we cannot make ourselves broken but we can put ourselves upon the altar amen and he'll allow him to break us allow him to mold us break me melt me mold me mold me into your image all we can do is humble ourselves before Jehovah to see if maybe you have mercy upon us for what we've done to his word amen and that's that's what we do is you knows we take his word so flippantly amen we play with death so flippantly but what and what says that he will actually come back to us amen if we leave the grace and mercy of God and walk out to the things of the devil who says that God will actually come back to us and revive us again when you walk into death how do you know that you'll come back life you know uh I write a story a few years ago and I'm just gonna give it out here I had I had never read dr. Jekyll mr. Hyde you know I don't know if anybody here has but you always hear about dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde so I thought well I'll just read that story I was shocked at the allegory that it was because this this this man mister mr. Hyde I believe his name was found a scientific concoction that could separate when he took it he could separate the good part of him from the bad part of him and he could go and he could whenever he drank this this this medicine this concoction he could go and live on the evil side of him and do everything that the evil side of a poem to do and then when the concoction wore off he'd go back to being the respectable righteous mr. Hyde and so by day he was there he was a respectable righteous mr. Hyde but by night he'd go and he'd drink this concoction his whole body would be transformed into this hideous a demon-possessed man and he'd go out and do all these wicked things but and he'd go and he played both sides of it he was a hypocrite but after a while as he did this time after time after time he began to have a harder time coming back and so he's like I'm never gonna do it again I'm not gonna do it again I'm not going to do it again you know and he swore off but after about a year of swearing it off all of a sudden he's like oh I'm gonna try it again but he found out he's kept having a hard time coming back a hard time coming back to righteousness and then all of a sudden one day he was the righteous respectable mr. Hyde was sitting in a park and he looked down and he had changed into the unrighteous version of himself without drinking the concoction at all and he tried everything he could do to come back and and after her days and days of trying he came back but every once while he would revert back he no longer had any power in himself to be righteous or evil he was just like a man a swinging gate in the wind and no power himself to stay wherever he was and the end of that man was death he ended up dying himself he died in unrighteousness and wickedness yoen and a Christian can only play with sin so long before it comes to the point in time where you yourself will no longer have the ability to come back you think oh I can repent on my sins all I'll do this for now but I'm going to repent next week and I'm gonna make it right I'm gonna make it right I'm gonna make it right but but you're like a gate swinging in the wind you don't actually know if you can't make it right because repentance only comes from God repentance is a gift from God himself and when you and if you can't if you you do not have the assurity that you can meet God face to face again what if he has hidden his face from you amen none of us when you play with sin you're playing with hell you're playing with death amen and none of us has the assurance that we can make it back if we go out fight beyond the separating line amen as much as we preach predestination as much as we preach all these things though these other scriptures remain true and cannot be trampled upon amen the these scriptures remain true and cannot be stepped upon amen we have to make sure we do not play with the death do not play with sin why because none of us has the assurance that if we play with the devil long enough we notice has the assurance of where we can come back to a man god bless you let's sing that song create in me a clean heart and renew the right spirit within me and renew the right spirit within me not away from thy presence O Lord take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew the right spirit within me Oh Oh hand into the right spirit within me created me O God and renew the right spirit within me [Music] pass me not away from thy presence oh lo take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew the right spirit within me
