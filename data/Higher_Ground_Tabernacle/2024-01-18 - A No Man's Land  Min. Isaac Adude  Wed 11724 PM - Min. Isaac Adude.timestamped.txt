[38:12] 9 Philippians 4:8 and verse
[38:17] 9 ammen the Bible says that finally
[38:20] Brethren whatsoever things are true

[38:29] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[38:32] whatsoever things are good report if
[38:35] there be any virtue and if there be any
[38:38] praise think on these
[38:43] [Music]
[38:53] [Music]
[38:55] things amen uh uh verse 9 he says those
[38:59] things which he have both learned and
[39:02] received and heard and seen in me do yes

[39:25] your
[39:27] Lord we just pray father God that you be
[39:29] with us Lord
[39:32] this Lord we we we we thank you Father

[39:59] oh
[40:02] God lord so that I can only say what you
[40:05] want me to say
[40:06] father lordess the heart that will hear
[40:09] the
[40:11] word and take control of everything
[40:14] Lord in Jesus Christ name we
[40:17] pray amen amen amen you may be
[40:23] seated amen
[40:25] uh this evening we have a little subject
[40:28] that we wanted to share with
[40:31] you amen that we entitle it a No Man's
[40:40] Land a No Man's
[40:44] Land amen because uh um a No
[40:48] Man's a no man's land is a land that is
[40:55] unoccupied amen it's a land that doesn't
[40:57] belong to
[40:59] anybody amen because back in the old
[41:02] back in the ancient
[41:04] world Amen when two countries or two uh
[41:09] regions were fighting against each
[41:13] other amen this the fights were not
[41:16] taking place in the City where everybody
[41:21] lives amen they weren't choosing a
[41:24] place amen that's where will be
[41:27] fighting and that place was called a no
[41:30] man's
[41:32] land so they could fight and destroy
[41:35] that land it wouldn't hurt
[41:40] anybody so by God's grace tonight we
[41:43] will try to talk about
[41:47] this amen because uh if you read the
[41:50] prophet I believe in the message uh the
[41:52] greatest battle ever fought or uh the
[41:55] conflict between
[41:56] Christ and
[42:02] Satan he says that the first battle that
[42:05] started was in
[42:08] heaven amen he called it an Angelic
[42:12] battle it was between Angels Lucifer and
[42:18] Michael yeah and and then and then when
[42:21] that that battle when Lucifer was kicked
[42:23] out of
[42:25] heaven he came down on
[42:28] Earth he took that Angelic
[42:32] battle made it a human battle human
[42:36] battle and the place he chose to have
[42:39] those
[42:43] battles amen it's our
[42:46] mind that's why the prophet called our
[42:49] mind in no man's
[42:55] land doesn't belong to
[42:58] anybody so meaning that the devil can
[43:00] come and bring
[43:03] thought amen the devil can come and
[43:05] bring anything that he
[43:08] wants amen and God also can come and
[43:11] bring
[43:13] thoughts so our mind is always in
[43:15] constant
[43:19] battle we only on Earth we only have two
[43:23] influences we are either influenced by
[43:27] Heavens or we influenced by by Satan by
[43:33] hell so the one that will
[43:36] win it's the one that you will listen
[43:40] to like the brother I believe the
[43:42] brother or sister that came to brother
[43:45] brandham he say brother brandham in me I
[43:47] feel like there's two dogs fighting
[43:49] constantly
[43:53] fighting and one is White and the other
[43:55] one is dark
[43:59] and and they're constantly fighting
[44:00] opposite to each
[44:03] other amen so I don't know which one
[44:05] will
[44:06] win and the prophet looked at him and he
[44:09] said that the one that will
[44:12] win is the one that will that you will
[44:15] feed the
[44:17] most because the devil devil can come
[44:20] and bar our
[44:23] minds and give our minds any type of
[44:26] thoughts that he
[44:29] want the only way to give him the
[44:34] victory it will be for you to stop and
[44:36] to listen to
[44:39] him it will be for you to stop and to
[44:42] pay attention to whatever he's
[44:47] saying amen here the prophet says in the
[44:49] greatest battle every F par
[44:54] 75
[44:56] it says that if this church right now
[44:59] could be put
[45:00] [Music]
[45:03] together and neither together with such
[45:07] that every person will be in one
[45:15] Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt
[45:21] anywhere he says that there will not be
[45:24] a feeble person in our
[45:30] there will not be a feble person in our
[45:31] MS in the in another five
[45:38] minute there will not be nobody here
[45:41] Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would
[45:43] receive
[45:47] it if you could just get that certain
[45:50] thing
[45:53] fixed now there is where the battle
[45:57] begins right in your
[46:00] mind it said that it said that whether
[46:02] you will uh and I just stop there so
[46:07] that's where that's where the battle
[46:10] begins it's in your
[46:13] mind if you even if you go to the
[46:15] Natural you go to the military the way
[46:17] they
[46:21] train amen you see that they train their
[46:24] physical body
[46:27] and they also train the mental the
[46:30] Mind amen because they know that the the
[46:33] quickest way to break
[46:38] someone with your Minden you can't be
[46:42] tortured somebody will endure torture
[46:45] and it will not
[46:47] break when you with the Mind usually
[46:50] it's quicker than than physical
[46:54] torture the mind your mind is a gate to
[46:59] everything your mind is a door that
[47:01] opens
[47:03] everything your mind is a door that will
[47:06] open
[47:08] doubt that will let in
[47:10] doubt that will let in
[47:14] faith your mind your mind is a door that
[47:16] will let him
[47:20] fear that will let in Joy and Pain and
[47:24] everything
[47:26] amen he will let in fear
[47:29] Faith amen that's the tactic that the
[47:32] devil
[47:34] used if we go to uh uh Genesis chapter
[47:38] 3 amen here's the uh the the
[47:41] conversation between the serpent and and
[47:43] and
[47:45] Eve amen here if you read this this
[47:48] chapter that we're about to read
[47:51] here you'll understand that when the
[47:53] serpent went to Eve
[47:57] the serpent did not misquote the
[48:04] word the serpent did not try to change
[48:07] the word or or to to to to to say
[48:10] something that was contrary to the
[48:14] word what he tried to do what he did
[48:18] amen he tried it pushed if to start
[48:21] thinking about what God
[48:24] Said
[48:27] start reasoning about the
[48:30] word Prophet says that the very same
[48:33] moment that you start reasoning about
[48:35] the
[48:39] word at that moment that you lose your
[48:42] faith it's at that moment that doubt
[48:45] start to to get
[48:47] in amen Genesis chap 3
[48:51] ver1 the Bible says here that now the
[48:53] serpent was more Sab
[48:56] than any beast of the field which the
[48:58] Lord God had
[49:04] made and he said unto the woman yay has
[49:07] God said You shall not eat of every tree
[49:11] of the
[49:15] garden amen so here notice that Eve knew
[49:18] the
[49:20] word so if the devil if Satan just came
[49:23] and then misquoted the word
[49:27] she would have picked up on that saying
[49:29] that this is not what Adam has taught me
[49:31] and this is not what God has
[49:37] said amen so here the Devil comes and
[49:39] then say that you shall not eat of every
[49:41] tree of the
[49:42] [Music]
[49:46] garden asking her as a
[49:49] question amen but that was the very same
[49:51] thing that God told
[49:54] them eat of every fruit of every tree of
[49:57] the garden but except for this one the
[50:00] the one with the knowledge of of evil
[50:02] and good and
[50:08] evil so here the devil the the serpent
[50:11] is trying to check and see if Eve knows
[50:13] her
[50:18] word now in verse two she answers back
[50:21] and she said that the Bible say and the
[50:23] woman said unto the serpent we may eat
[50:26] of every fruit of the Trees of the
[50:29] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[50:32] which is in the midst of the garden God
[50:34] has said You shall not eat of it neither
[50:37] shall you touch it lest you
[50:51] die here in verse one he stated the same
[50:54] thing but he kind of questioned
[50:57] [Music]
[51:00] it amen so now verse 2 and three the
[51:03] woman with all boldness and the word
[51:05] that she knew and she quoted that very
[51:11] quick so now verse
[51:13] four the Bible says that and the serpent
[51:16] said unto the woman you shall not surely
[51:21] die amen now he started to make her
[51:24] reason
[51:27] amen but God said that you will
[51:30] die amen he didn't say that he didn't
[51:32] come up straight up and say that you
[51:34] won't
[51:36] dieen he said that you shall not surely
[51:39] die in other words that God meant
[51:42] something else by saying
[51:46] this this is the exact same thing that
[51:48] happens to us
[51:50] now you read the quote of the
[51:54] prophet read something that the prophet
[51:56] has
[51:57] saying because you're not happy with
[52:00] it saying that well the prophet did not
[52:03] mean
[52:04] this Prophet meant this and he meant
[52:07] this other
[52:08] thing amen the word means exactly what
[52:11] it's
[52:13] saying if God says that don't eat it
[52:15] because you will die that means don't
[52:17] eat it you will
[52:18] [Music]
[52:20] die not surely in God's
[52:24] word
[52:26] am he came and he said the serpent says
[52:28] that you shall not surely
[52:30] die Amen in verse five he says that for
[52:33] God does know that in the day ye eat
[52:37] thereof then your eyes shall be open and
[52:41] you shall be as God's knowing good and
[52:50] evil here he's giving a woman that Eve
[52:55] in opportunity to be equal with
[53:00] God God gave you that
[53:03] word because he just want to keep you
[53:06] you know want to keep you
[53:09] blinden he doesn't want you to know
[53:11] everything he doesn't want you to be
[53:13] like
[53:14] him that's why that's why he gave you
[53:17] this
[53:18] word why he's trying to control
[53:21] you he's trying to dictate the way you
[53:23] have to leave
[53:26] he's trying to dictate the way you have
[53:27] to
[53:29] dress he trying to dictate the songs
[53:31] that you have to listen
[53:33] to he's trying to dictate the things
[53:36] that you have to
[53:38] watch is not trying to tell
[53:41] you that if you do
[53:43] this you will be like him amen you will
[53:47] have the same knowledge as
[53:49] him you will be equal to
[53:52] God Amen he gave him that opportunity
[53:56] the woman started reasoning about the
[53:59] word she started reasoning about
[54:01] everything that she
[54:03] knew and the same moment that we start
[54:05] reasoning about the
[54:08] word we start losing our
[54:10] faith we don't believe 100%
[54:14] anymore amen it's like you go to the
[54:18] doctor you know very well the Bible says
[54:20] that by your stps I'm
[54:24] Healed let's say that you go to a church
[54:26] and somebody gave a prophecy or
[54:28] something about your
[54:31] sickness amen and then you go to the
[54:33] doctor the doctor say that well this is
[54:35] getting
[54:38] worse amen you only have a week life to
[54:43] leave so now the choice will be up to
[54:47] you are you either going to take God's
[54:50] word or the doctor's
[54:54] word very same moment you decide to take
[54:57] the doctor's
[55:00] word at that moment you started losing
[55:02] your
[55:04] faith because you brought in
[55:07] reasoning the doctors has you know as
[55:10] more as experience he has all those
[55:12] machines and everything and you know he
[55:14] can prove that the cancer is gone it's
[55:21] worse but but what I have it's only this
[55:24] word I don't know if I if it was really
[55:26] for me or for some somebody
[55:32] else maybe God wants me to take this
[55:35] pill and I will be
[55:37] healed or maybe that propy or that word
[55:40] means that I have to go through this
[55:45] surgery the same the very same moment
[55:48] you start bringing the
[55:51] reasoning amen you start that same
[55:53] moment you start you be welcoming your
[55:59] defeat Amen in verse
[56:01] six the Bible says that and when the
[56:04] woman saw that the tree was good for
[56:10] food and it was pleasant to the
[56:14] eyes and the tree and the tree to be
[56:18] desired to be desired to make one
[56:23] wise she took the fruit she took of the
[56:26] fruit
[56:27] thereof and did eat and gave also unto
[56:31] her
[56:33] husband and he did
[56:36] itat amen she s that the fruit was good
[56:39] was good for
[56:43] food even though God told them not to
[56:46] eat
[56:47] it amen but reasoning brought something
[56:51] else amen because you also we can also
[56:54] you also I can have faith in the what
[56:57] the devil is
[56:59] saying the devil will bring you to have
[57:02] faith in his
[57:04] word the same thing that he the same
[57:06] thing he did with
[57:08] Eve God said not to eat
[57:11] it but he went and he saw he show Eve
[57:14] how the food was
[57:16] good the the fruit was good for
[57:23] food and the B said that and the tree to
[57:25] be desired to make one
[57:30] wise God never asked us to be wise about
[57:34] about about about his
[57:38] word God never asked us to to to try to
[57:41] even understand the
[57:43] word amen he asked us to
[57:46] believe amen he asked us to
[57:49] believe amen not to
[57:51] reason Amen to say that well this is not
[57:54] worth it's not you know it's not
[57:56] sounding good or bad or whatever you
[57:58] reason you can come up
[58:02] with am God ask us to believe the
[58:07] word amen and the eyes of them both were
[58:14] opened and they knew that they were
[58:19] naked and they sued uh uh uh fig leaves
[58:23] together
[58:26] and made them and made themselves
[58:30] up Amen to cover the
[58:33] nudity cover that shame that they
[58:37] had amen because one
[58:40] person decided to stop and to listen to
[58:43] the
[58:45] devil one person decided to
[58:50] stop amen and to doubt the word of God
[58:54] amen the doubt on on one word of God one
[59:00] word amen brought the
[59:04] fall to the human race amen that's what
[59:08] Paul
[59:09] says to have your mind GED
[59:14] up amen with the word uh where's the
[59:18] first
[59:19] Peter amen he says
[59:23] that
[59:25] First Peter chapter 1 verse verse
[59:28] 13 He said that g up the Lo of your
[59:33] mind be sober and hope to the end for
[59:37] the grace that is to be brought unto you
[59:39] by the revelation of Jesus
[59:45] Christ G up the loins of your
[59:48] mind and the only way to do
[59:52] that is with the word of God
[59:55] amen that's why God gave us his
[59:58] word amen as the best
[1:00:02] attack amen that's the only way you have
[1:00:04] to overcome the
[1:00:07] devil that's the only way you will have
[1:00:09] to overcome
[1:00:11] Temptation only way you have to overcome
[1:00:14] that
[1:00:16] battle the word of God so why did he
[1:00:20] give us the word of
[1:00:22] God because the word of God is
[1:00:25] etal and the word of God is
[1:00:28] himself if he overcame the devil up
[1:00:31] there in
[1:00:33] heaven amen and he gave us
[1:00:36] himself amen so that with that word amen
[1:00:39] we will still overcome the same
[1:00:42] devil the prophet says now let's
[1:00:45] diagnose that
[1:00:49] down
[1:00:51] amen like the chemistry of the blood or
[1:00:54] the chemistry of
[1:00:58] water he said why did he give the
[1:01:04] word he said that the word is eternal
[1:01:08] see and if God made a promise that is
[1:01:12] [Music]
[1:01:14] eternal and there is nothing nowhere can
[1:01:17] stop
[1:01:20] it that turn every every atom upside up
[1:01:24] upside
[1:01:26] down they turn every every Adam upside
[1:01:30] down and and and turn it
[1:01:39] backwards and could never pierce the
[1:01:42] word of
[1:01:44] God one little word see Jesus said both
[1:01:50] heavens and earth will pass
[1:01:53] away but word shall never
[1:01:56] fail that's the best weapon there
[1:01:59] is the word of the Eternal
[1:02:03] God now what is the word of
[1:02:06] God the word of God is God
[1:02:10] himself God gave the believer
[1:02:15] himself God
[1:02:17] himself he gave the believer
[1:02:20] himself to attack the Enemy by
[1:02:25] in other words his father and the word
[1:02:29] is
[1:02:30] God in other word his
[1:02:33] father and the word is God then the word
[1:02:37] is our
[1:02:38] father we're born by the word and he's
[1:02:41] standing that we're born by the
[1:02:44] word and he's standing in the Forefront
[1:02:47] for his
[1:02:49] children amen there you are am standing
[1:02:53] out there for his
[1:02:56] children what are we scared
[1:02:58] about amen the Rapture is
[1:03:01] sure the coming is
[1:03:04] sureen every blessing that's been
[1:03:07] promised is
[1:03:09] ours you take the word with
[1:03:12] you if you open your mind to the word of
[1:03:17] God open your mind to his
[1:03:20] promises will make the rupture
[1:03:23] sure he will make every promises
[1:03:27] sure he will make make every every word
[1:03:29] in the Bible sure for
[1:03:33] you amen we have to open our minds to
[1:03:36] his
[1:03:38] word amen stop listening to the
[1:03:41] devil amen stop listening to the to the
[1:03:44] black the black
[1:03:46] dog amen keep on feding your mind with
[1:03:49] the word of
[1:03:52] God your mind the word of
[1:03:59] God and he will start reacting by
[1:04:03] itself the devil will bring one
[1:04:06] thought and right the way the scripture
[1:04:08] will come to
[1:04:13] you if you if you have your if you have
[1:04:16] the your mind you know filled with the
[1:04:19] word of
[1:04:21] God because the devil knows that that's
[1:04:23] the way he takes the children of
[1:04:29] God it doesn't matter how many words how
[1:04:31] many scriptures you can
[1:04:34] quote it doesn't matter how many how
[1:04:36] many quotes of the Bible of the Prophet
[1:04:38] you
[1:04:40] know he knows that our
[1:04:42] mind amen is the Gateway of
[1:04:46] everything the prophet brother Brandon
[1:04:49] when he lost his wife and and his
[1:04:52] daughter the devil try the way the way
[1:04:54] the devil was trying to to to have him
[1:04:57] doubt the
[1:04:59] word he was with
[1:05:02] reasoning the devil knew very well that
[1:05:04] he wouldn't come to brother Bram said
[1:05:06] that God doesn't care for
[1:05:11] you God wasn't
[1:05:13] real amen but what he tried to
[1:05:16] doen he's trying to show brother Bram
[1:05:18] that God doesn't care for
[1:05:22] him trying to show him how God took his
[1:05:26] wife amen how God took his
[1:05:29] daughter brother bam certainly prayed
[1:05:32] for for for for his
[1:05:35] family for both of them amen I'm pretty
[1:05:38] sure maybe he
[1:05:40] fasted amen he gave his
[1:05:43] all amen but the devil came and said
[1:05:45] that look God did not even listen to
[1:05:47] your
[1:05:49] prayers God doesn't care for
[1:05:51] you amen he was trying to get him
[1:05:54] through his
[1:05:57] mind amen but he had the word of God
[1:06:00] with
[1:06:01] him he had the word of God to fight
[1:06:04] back the only way to
[1:06:08] overcome
[1:06:10] word because the prophet said that he's
[1:06:12] got to come in your
[1:06:16] mind and you have to accept
[1:06:19] it amen it can't
[1:06:22] B it can't B again against
[1:06:25] you amen but he can't get to you until
[1:06:29] you accept
[1:06:31] it when Satan walked up to
[1:06:36] Eve said you know the fruit is
[1:06:39] Pleasant she stepped for a
[1:06:43] moment and and that's when she made a
[1:06:47] mistake she stopped for a
[1:06:50] moment so when those mind when those
[1:06:53] mind were when those uh mind battles
[1:06:55] will be coming to
[1:06:57] you amen don't stop not even for a
[1:07:01] second because it's something that comes
[1:07:03] to
[1:07:05] everyone it doesn't matter how spiritual
[1:07:07] you
[1:07:08] are it doesn't matter how filled with
[1:07:11] the Holy Spirit you
[1:07:13] are the devil will always come to your
[1:07:17] mind to do the same thing with
[1:07:20] Jesus him who is the creator of
[1:07:22] everything am who created the heavens
[1:07:25] and
[1:07:26] earth but the devil came and tried to
[1:07:29] make him doubt this
[1:07:33] word at first he tried to make him
[1:07:36] create turn the stone to a
[1:07:42] bread to make Him worship
[1:07:45] Him amen that was in the beginning of
[1:07:47] his
[1:07:49] ministry and then at the end of his
[1:07:51] ministry he's trying to be came and
[1:07:54] trying to show him how painful it was to
[1:07:56] go through the
[1:07:59] cross trying to show him the better way
[1:08:02] to handle
[1:08:06] this you can only drink from the
[1:08:09] cup if you can only there is another way
[1:08:12] to do
[1:08:13] it you don't have to go through
[1:08:16] it if it try if he was he dared to go to
[1:08:20] God to Jesus Christ
[1:08:22] himself
[1:08:24] to try to make him doubt his own
[1:08:27] words what about you and
[1:08:30] me are battles that we go through every
[1:08:34] day same moment you wake
[1:08:39] up the devil will come with his first
[1:08:43] attack the the prophet said that he can
[1:08:47] batter amen I looked at that word batter
[1:08:50] in the dictionary
[1:08:52] dictionary
[1:08:55] it says that to strike repeatedly with
[1:08:57] hard
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:09:02] blows amen so meaning that the devil
[1:09:04] will keep on
[1:09:07] striking he will not
[1:09:09] rest he will keep on
[1:09:12] trying he will keep on giving you
[1:09:15] thought that you not
[1:09:18] saved you don't have the holy spirit
[1:09:21] amen Look to You sin yesterday
[1:09:25] amen God doesn't love you God doesn't
[1:09:28] care for
[1:09:29] you if God cared for you you wouldn't
[1:09:31] have gone through this uh uh this
[1:09:35] journey if God cared for you amen he
[1:09:38] would have given you all your
[1:09:41] prayers if God cared for you would have
[1:09:43] heed Your Body by
[1:09:46] now if God cared for you would have
[1:09:48] saved your
[1:09:49] [Music]
[1:09:51] wife that's the tactic of the devil
[1:09:55] he will come every day every moment the
[1:09:59] prophet said that
[1:10:01] repeatedly with
[1:10:03] hards Amen to try to get you to to
[1:10:06] accept
[1:10:07] it and the only way to give him
[1:10:11] Victory if you do like
[1:10:14] Eve you stop for a
[1:10:17] moment that will be the biggest mistake
[1:10:20] of your
[1:10:21] life to stop and to listen to him am so
[1:10:26] every time he comes because we know that
[1:10:29] he will come amen even right now amen
[1:10:33] the devil will come amen trying to bring
[1:10:36] you different
[1:10:37] thoughts keep you
[1:10:40] distracted but you always have to have
[1:10:42] the word of God with
[1:10:45] you have to fight him
[1:10:47] back because the word of God is your
[1:10:51] Fortress so you stay with the
[1:10:54] word that's the only way to
[1:10:57] overcome amen the devil will come to you
[1:11:00] and say that you don't have the holy
[1:11:02] spirit amen you know very well that you
[1:11:05] had an experience with
[1:11:07] God you know very well that God gave you
[1:11:10] the holy
[1:11:12] spirit amen but he will come to you and
[1:11:15] say that you don't have
[1:11:17] it amen amen amen I received the Holy
[1:11:20] Spirit when I was
[1:11:22] 17
[1:11:24] amen but when I moved to the
[1:11:27] US amen that transition was a little
[1:11:30] hard on
[1:11:32] me amen so the devil kept on coming to
[1:11:35] me and say that you're not saved and you
[1:11:36] don't have the holy
[1:11:41] spirit amen he he he get me for he got
[1:11:44] me for a
[1:11:46] while amen amen I kept on coming to
[1:11:50] different prayer lines and asking for
[1:11:51] the Holy Spirit and it's
[1:11:56] amen he kept on saying that well look
[1:11:58] you're not even you know you're not the
[1:11:59] same as you used to be
[1:12:04] and and look where you are now and look
[1:12:06] what you're doing and and
[1:12:09] everything amen so when we went to we
[1:12:11] went to the camp Louisiana
[1:12:16] Camp it was with Lis Paul's friend
[1:12:21] Nathan so at that time the devil was
[1:12:24] constantly coming to me and saying that
[1:12:25] you don't you're not saved and you don't
[1:12:27] have the Holy
[1:12:30] Spirit so I went with that camp I went
[1:12:32] to that camp I was like Lord I just need
[1:12:35] something from you to show me that I
[1:12:37] have it and I will stop I won't come
[1:12:39] anymore asking for
[1:12:46] it amen so it happens that uh uh uh Nate
[1:12:50] L Paul's brother L Paul's friend
[1:12:55] amen uh uh God was working through
[1:12:58] him amen so when he went to the prayer
[1:13:02] line after that couple you know couple
[1:13:04] young Brothers started praying for that
[1:13:06] for that brother and he started the
[1:13:08] devil start you know those Spirit
[1:13:09] started talking through
[1:13:14] him man the spirit you know that do
[1:13:17] devils and and Spirits started talking
[1:13:19] through him
[1:13:22] and some people in the church when they
[1:13:25] were praying they started having
[1:13:26] conversation with
[1:13:30] him so it wasn't him technically talking
[1:13:33] but it was those Spirits inside of him
[1:13:38] responding amen so after that you know
[1:13:41] the church P they prayed and we thought
[1:13:43] that you know he was delivered and
[1:13:48] everything so on our way back to uh to
[1:13:51] our rooms
[1:13:54] am man those same Spirits came back on
[1:13:57] him and he started acting up and
[1:13:58] throwing the Bible and and and and you
[1:14:01] know acting up
[1:14:06] weird amen so we weren't there with our
[1:14:08] mentors with our Mentor uh uh I believe
[1:14:12] they're called counselors or
[1:14:15] something so he made him
[1:14:19] sit amen and then he asked him that what
[1:14:21] are you seeing in my eyes what are you
[1:14:23] seeing in
[1:14:25] me he replied back and said that you
[1:14:27] know I he couldn't even look at his eyes
[1:14:29] and he replied back and said that I'm
[1:14:30] seeing Fire coming out of
[1:14:35] you amen then he looked at him again and
[1:14:37] he said that you know look at everyone
[1:14:40] here surrounding
[1:14:44] you and tell me who is your
[1:14:47] friend amen so when he asked that
[1:14:50] question am I knew very well what I was
[1:14:53] going
[1:14:54] through the devil kept on sing me that
[1:14:57] hey you don't have the Holy Spirit and
[1:14:58] you're not filled and what you have
[1:15:00] whatever experience you had was FAL and
[1:15:02] blah blah
[1:15:08] blah the scripture in the Bible where it
[1:15:10] says that Paul we know Jesus we know
[1:15:13] Paul we know about you you don't we
[1:15:14] don't know
[1:15:19] you amen that very that scripture came
[1:15:22] to me that at that same
[1:15:25] moment and I was like oh
[1:15:28] Lord you know I'm about to be exposed
[1:15:31] right
[1:15:32] now man I was like well cuz the Bible
[1:15:35] says that you know the devil knows who
[1:15:37] are here so he'll be to point at me and
[1:15:39] say that you know this this one is my
[1:15:46] friend wow I was like well I'm about to
[1:15:49] be exposed I started shaking up a little
[1:15:52] bit so then he he looked at all of
[1:15:57] us it was me uh Le gel and John believe
[1:16:02] couple
[1:16:03] Brothers amen he looked at every one of
[1:16:06] us like from the from his left to his
[1:16:10] right and then he looked at that brother
[1:16:12] he said that I'm not seeing my friend
[1:16:15] here then then then right the way a
[1:16:18] peace came to my heart and I was like
[1:16:20] wow the devil you are you are a liar
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:25] gave you an opportunity to expose or to
[1:16:27] tell me if if I don't really have the
[1:16:29] Holy Spirit but you you did you said
[1:16:31] that you're not seeing your friend
[1:16:37] here don't and says that and say that
[1:16:40] I'm not filled with the holy spirit
[1:16:45] anymore and from that time on am man the
[1:16:47] devil has never came never come came
[1:16:50] back and try to say that I don't have
[1:16:52] the Holy Spirit this
[1:16:56] amen amen because he will start with
[1:16:58] your mind
[1:16:59] first the prophet says that don't
[1:17:03] reason believe amen no matter the
[1:17:08] circumstances don't pay attention to
[1:17:13] circumstances you just
[1:17:15] believe amen don't
[1:17:17] reason
[1:17:19] believe no matter what the
[1:17:22] circumstances
[1:17:24] don't pay attention to
[1:17:25] it you just
[1:17:27] believe amen close your mind to your
[1:17:30] five
[1:17:32] senses amen close your mind to your
[1:17:35] sense of taste see smell touch and hear
[1:17:38] and
[1:17:40] everything as long as those senses are
[1:17:43] not lining up with the
[1:17:46] word you close your mind to them amen
[1:17:50] don't pay attention to
[1:17:52] them you've been prayed
[1:17:54] for amen even though your body is not
[1:17:57] feeling like
[1:17:58] it stop praising God Amen be like
[1:18:03] Abraham amen God gave him the
[1:18:06] word his body did not feel young at the
[1:18:09] same the same
[1:18:11] moment sah body didn't become young
[1:18:18] overnight Abraham did not stop to listen
[1:18:21] to whatever they were saying
[1:18:24] the devil came through the devil came to
[1:18:27] Abraham through
[1:18:30] Sarah trying to give him
[1:18:33] atitude Abraham maybe God did not say
[1:18:36] that you only have to have that kid with
[1:18:41] me take the servant man you will still
[1:18:44] have you still have hair you still have
[1:18:46] a
[1:18:48] child amen amen people neighbors
[1:18:51] certainly they were saying but well Abra
[1:18:53] it's been 20 years since you said that
[1:18:54] God talked to you about where is the
[1:19:00] kid did not
[1:19:03] stop but he kept on
[1:19:06] believing against all
[1:19:09] hope amen against against all against
[1:19:12] all
[1:19:14] reasoning all odd words were against
[1:19:18] him he kept on
[1:19:21] believing God say it
[1:19:23] and that settles it and I believe it
[1:19:27] amen God said it amen I don't know when
[1:19:30] I'm going to have that
[1:19:34] kid why that promise will come to
[1:19:39] pass but I know one
[1:19:41] thing God said it and I believe it amen
[1:19:45] I don't have to understand
[1:19:47] iten it doesn't have to make sense to
[1:19:51] me I don't have to know how to explain
[1:19:55] it to
[1:19:56] you first of all I don't have to explain
[1:19:59] it to
[1:20:00] you because when God talked to me he
[1:20:03] talked to me
[1:20:05] personally did not talk to you or God
[1:20:08] did not tell me to go explain it to
[1:20:11] people he asked me to believe his
[1:20:14] word that's what I'm doing amen it
[1:20:17] doesn't matter what the devil will
[1:20:20] come it doesn't matter what thought the
[1:20:23] devil will try to bring in
[1:20:26] me what God Said Amen and I believe it
[1:20:30] and I'm sticking with
[1:20:32] it the prophet said that but after you
[1:20:35] become a
[1:20:37] Christian then you are fortified with
[1:20:40] the word by the
[1:20:42] word and any promise in the
[1:20:46] Worden he said that I didn't know that I
[1:20:48] was going to say
[1:20:50] that see when you become a
[1:20:53] Christian you're placed behind the word
[1:20:57] of
[1:20:59] God there is your
[1:21:02] Fortress safety your
[1:21:06] safety oh my every promise in that is
[1:21:11] yours only thing you have to do is just
[1:21:14] reach and get
[1:21:20] it and go right on with it
[1:21:24] amen how you know it's going to
[1:21:27] work I don't know I don't know how it's
[1:21:31] going to
[1:21:32] work explain to me I don't know only
[1:21:37] thing I know that God gave his children
[1:21:41] the best attack that they could
[1:21:46] have and the best thing to attack
[1:21:50] with because he knows we work With the
[1:21:53] [Music]
[1:21:55] Enemy amen he knows he knows the working
[1:21:58] of the
[1:22:00] enemy he knows that he always come to
[1:22:03] through our
[1:22:06] mind amen so he gave us a best
[1:22:10] attack that is the word of God Amen you
[1:22:14] just have to stand behind
[1:22:17] it let the word of God Build That
[1:22:21] Wall of
[1:22:24] safety the word of God Be Your
[1:22:28] Shield amen you're the shield of the
[1:22:31] word and stand behind
[1:22:34] it every thought of the
[1:22:37] devil will hit that shield and
[1:22:41] return won be to pierce
[1:22:44] you because you built the shield of the
[1:22:48] word so the reason why people have doubt
[1:22:53] is because they don't know where they're
[1:22:58] standing amen I read the last one last
[1:23:01] quote of the Prophet
[1:23:04] here in the message the images of
[1:23:09] Christ paragraph
[1:23:11] 31 it says that I and I believe that
[1:23:14] before anybody can ever move or have a
[1:23:18] real confidential
[1:23:21] faith
[1:23:28] [Music]
[1:23:33] he say first they have to know where
[1:23:35] they
[1:23:38] stand and how to stand after they make
[1:23:41] their
[1:23:44] stand I believe that's
[1:23:46] essential for you cannot just head long
[1:23:51] head long plunge into something
[1:23:57] long into something
[1:24:00] with when you don't know where you
[1:24:05] plunging amen you've got to
[1:24:08] know and if our faith is set
[1:24:12] right and in the right
[1:24:15] position it gives a constant
[1:24:19] satisfaction amen you have to know where
[1:24:22] you
[1:24:24] standing amen and if your faith is set
[1:24:28] right in the right
[1:24:30] position it gives a constant
[1:24:34] satisfaction amen it's like that woman
[1:24:36] that was losing
[1:24:38] blood amen she was losing blood for
[1:24:43] years amen she went to different doctors
[1:24:46] the bible say that she used up all her
[1:24:51] money
[1:24:53] amen and people certainly were saying
[1:24:55] that she did something and and was she
[1:24:57] was paying back whatever she did was the
[1:24:59] consequences of her life or
[1:25:05] something people named her you know gave
[1:25:08] her names and and called her names and
[1:25:10] and so
[1:25:12] forth amen I was sitting one day and
[1:25:15] trying to think about that
[1:25:19] verse amen she was losing blood you know
[1:25:22] for months I mean for
[1:25:25] years amen but look at look at now if
[1:25:28] you come to the
[1:25:30] Natural amen amen somebody who's losing
[1:25:33] blood for for for
[1:25:36] years amen first of all that person is
[1:25:39] not strong
[1:25:41] enough that person would not have
[1:25:44] strength amen so Jesus when Jesus was
[1:25:47] passing
[1:25:48] by amen Jesus was not near her
[1:25:53] amen and to get to
[1:25:55] Jesus she first had to go through the
[1:25:59] crowd which means that it wasn't
[1:26:01] something
[1:26:03] easy normally amen the way the devil
[1:26:06] Works amen first of all he will try to
[1:26:09] show you all the obstacles that you have
[1:26:11] to
[1:26:13] cross devil will try to show you how
[1:26:16] impossible it is to get whatever you get
[1:26:18] you trying to
[1:26:21] get
[1:26:23] amen but she had her mind in the she
[1:26:27] opened her mind to the word of
[1:26:30] God she was standing in the right
[1:26:34] position she knew where she was
[1:26:37] standing she knew that that one
[1:26:41] touch amen was able to save
[1:26:44] her so whatever the devil was coming to
[1:26:48] the devil was putting in her
[1:26:51] mind ignored
[1:26:53] everything amen and she started to break
[1:26:57] through amen because faith will break
[1:26:59] through every
[1:27:02] barriers it doesn't matter how thick
[1:27:05] that barrier
[1:27:07] is amen your faith will break through
[1:27:11] it amen your faith will break through
[1:27:14] it you just know what you have Fai
[1:27:18] in you just know what you believing in
[1:27:23] amen and with that your faith will help
[1:27:25] you to break through
[1:27:28] it you will be like Joshua and
[1:27:31] Caleb they went to that City where God
[1:27:33] told them to
[1:27:35] go they saw how milk and honey was
[1:27:40] flowing how beautiful that city
[1:27:44] was when they came back with the
[1:27:47] report other people were
[1:27:51] scared amen other people start
[1:27:54] reasoning well we know that God told us
[1:27:56] that we go through
[1:27:59] it but look at the fact amen here you
[1:28:03] have
[1:28:04] Giants amen and we not you know we're
[1:28:07] not even seen you know compared to
[1:28:11] them so how are we going to fight how
[1:28:14] are we going to
