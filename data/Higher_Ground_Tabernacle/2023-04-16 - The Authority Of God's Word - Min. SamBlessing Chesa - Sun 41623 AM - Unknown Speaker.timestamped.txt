[39:59] [Music]
[40:34] let us open our Bible to the Book of
[40:37] Genesis in chapter one uh
[40:48] Genesis chapter 1 and verse one Genesis
[40:56] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[40:58] and the Earth
[41:01] and the Earth was without form and void
[41:06] and darkness was upon the face of the
[41:08] deep is
[41:11] the spirit of God moved upon the face of
[41:14] the waters it is
[41:21] and there was life
[41:23] amen you can take the comfort of your
[41:25] seeds
[41:29] you can sit down
[41:32] it's me and the translator will remain
[41:34] standing amen
[41:35] [Music]
[41:44] you can open our Bibles to the Book of
[41:45] John chapter 1 and verse 1.
[41:51] [Music]
[42:07] the Bible says in the beginning was the
[42:09] word
[42:12] and the Word was with God
[42:15] [Music]
[42:19] we're just trying to fix this
[42:53] amen amen Satan was trying to fight us
[42:58] but we are modern conquerors anyway
[43:02] in the Book of John chapter 1 verse one
[43:05] delivered
[43:06] the Bible says in the beginning was the
[43:08] word
[43:10] and the Word was with God
[43:13] and the Word was God did you
[43:17] the same was in the beginning with God
[43:22] all things were made by him
[43:25] and without him was not anything made
[43:28] that was made
[43:33] for a short time this morning I want to
[43:35] speak on the authority of God's word
[43:41] hallelujah hallelujah
[43:44] when we read in Genesis chapter one
[43:47] it says the world was empty
[43:51] there was nothing in it
[43:54] but that's when God spoke about it and
[43:57] he said let there be lie
[44:02] what created that life
[44:04] it's the word of God
[44:07] the spoken word
[44:09] what created the Earth
[44:12] it was the spoken word
[44:15] the mountains we see the mountains
[44:20] the beautiful Grand Canyon
[44:24] Grand Canyon to the Montana and all the
[44:28] mountain ranges we see
[44:30] they were created by the word
[44:34] spoken word
[44:36] now we realize that a word
[44:40] when it is spoken it carries the same
[44:44] Authority as the person who has spoken
[44:46] that word
[44:49] in John the Bible tells us that don't
[44:52] they live for the genre in the beginning
[44:54] was the word
[44:56] and that word was with God
[45:01] and that word was God
[45:05] amen amen so when God said let there be
[45:09] it's okay
[45:11] those words
[45:16] carry the same Authority as God himself
[45:22] because it's God who had spoken those
[45:25] words
[45:27] someone comes and tells you would be a
[45:31] command very good
[45:33] the first thing you're going to ask is
[45:36] who say that
[45:39] however where you're gonna act on that
[45:41] word
[45:45] depends on the person who has spoken
[45:49] if your co-worker comes to uh if your
[45:52] co-worker who's at the same level with
[45:53] you comes and tell you to do something
[46:00] you say okay I'll do it when I'm when I
[46:03] when I have available time
[46:05] but when your boss comes to tell you to
[46:08] do something
[46:10] you should do the exact same thing
[46:14] you make it a priority
[46:18] because although it might be the same
[46:20] words that's spoken
[46:23] you attach the authority of that word to
[46:26] the person who has spoken foreign
[46:57] when the president speaks currently
[46:59] president Paul that word has Authority
[47:03] the whole law enforcement
[47:06] the police the police have to enforce
[47:10] the police say to say they do have
[47:12] unforces
[47:16] all the law enforcement has to enforce
[47:19] it uh
[47:20] the police result
[47:24] because the law that's been passed out
[47:27] carries authorities
[47:30] authority of the Judiciary whoever
[47:32] passed it
[47:36] but we know we have a greater Authority
[47:39] than all of them
[47:45] remember our almighty God
[47:48] who spoke the word
[47:51] he was the word and that word was him
[47:55] in Isaiah foreign
[49:08] amen that word has made the Layman to
[49:11] walk said by all Africa that same word
[49:15] has made the blind eyes to see said
[49:19] that same word has caused cancers to
[49:22] disappeared
[49:25] that same word has caused tuberculosis
[49:27] to clear out said
[49:32] dead people have raised the more songs
[49:35] why is because God has spoken
[49:39] that same word has saved you and me said
[49:43] it does not matter what you were doing
[49:46] it does not matter what sin was binding
[49:49] you
[49:51] but when you heard that word of God
[49:55] it had enough power
[49:58] enough authority to set you free yeah
[50:02] it does not matter what chains were
[50:05] binding
[50:11] why because that word has the same
[50:13] Authority as God himself
[50:17] hallelujah hallelujah so all you have to
[50:20] do is take God and His words
[50:23] do not worry to say I don't know how
[50:25] this is
[50:31] that's not your problem
[50:33] just take him at his words
[50:37] he is responsible for making it come to
[50:39] pass
[50:45] regarding they were told that they were
[50:48] going to have a baby
[50:52] Baron for 25 years
[50:56] they did not worry how that was going to
[50:58] happen
[51:01] they just believe the word of God
[51:04] in that word he said parole was
[51:07] responsible to transform them
[51:13] was responsible for quickening Sarah's
[51:16] dead woman
[51:24] you see a promise of God
[51:33] because it's not your problem
[51:36] you don't have to worry about the
[51:38] technicalities
[51:40] God is responsible for his own
[51:43] responsibility all you have to do is
[51:46] realize
[52:41] she was not responsible for that
[52:44] happening
[53:00] all she just had to do was believe the
[53:03] words
[53:06] me if we are just like Mary this one it
[53:08] wasn't one some called married to my
[53:10] town and say Lord whatever you say about
[53:12] me
[53:14] get unto me according to them
[53:20] Gary I don't know how it's going to
[53:23] happen
[53:24] you might not know that medical
[53:26] knowledge
[53:33] themselves
[53:37] I have no idea
[53:43] uh
[54:22] [Music]
[54:34] thank you they are waiting for you to
[54:36] claim them
[54:40] all you just have to do is believe it
[54:44] hallelujah hallelujah so you say you
[54:48] look around whenever whatever promise
[54:50] you need
[54:53] open your Bible be read it stand on the
[54:58] head um
[55:08] God we serve a god of reputation
[55:12] he has never failed
[55:15] he is jealous of his reputation
[55:19] so if you take him at his words
[55:22] why is he gonna start failing on you
[55:27] he has a reputation
[55:31] ever since the Earth was created
[55:57] God will do it for you
[56:00] because there is nowhere that God speaks
[56:04] you ever go back to him
[56:08] hey man amen it has to come to pass
[56:14] this there's a scriptures that say the
[56:15] angels of the Lord in capital round
[56:17] those that fear Him yeah
[56:21] that's a promise
[56:23] if you believe it
[56:26] it happens to you
[56:29] how many accidents have you survived
[56:32] accident
[56:34] how many things could have happened to
[56:36] you but did not happen to you
[56:40] do you think that is
[56:44] that's God's word protecting you
[56:47] have Angels surrounding you yeah
[56:51] because you believe the word because you
[56:55] fear God
[56:58] um
[56:59] there is one sister
[57:02] out there in Africa
[57:04] she used to go to church on Wednesday
[57:07] evening
[57:09] and uh it was dangerous the area where
[57:12] she was walking
[57:23] and that place was well known to be they
[57:27] had the robbers and the murderers they
[57:29] said
[57:32] people never crossed or walked around
[57:36] that area at night
[57:40] but this sister was faithful message
[57:46] she never missed a single service
[57:50] it pays to be faithful to God
[57:54] God sees you each and every of your
[57:57] effort
[58:00] and this happened for so many years she
[58:02] used to walk by past and people knew
[58:04] that that's what she was doing it
[58:08] and they wondered why why she wasn't
[58:11] being attacked
[58:14] then one day a certain gentleman
[58:17] approached her yeah
[58:21] why is who is the man who is walking
[58:24] with you at night when you're coming
[58:25] from
[58:29] she says I go by myself
[58:34] person so these robots these murderers
[58:39] every time she used to pass by this
[58:41] bridge
[58:43] they will see the sister if why I said
[58:46] sir walking with a giant
[58:49] and they could not attack her because
[58:52] she was walking with it
[58:55] and they thought maybe it was someone
[58:57] she was walking baby
[59:01] she had no clue what was going on
[59:05] and she says I'm by myself
[59:08] but no she was not by herself
[59:11] that was God's angels protection
[59:46] [Music]
[59:58] [Music]
[1:00:03] do you remember the story of jobs
[1:00:08] Satan when God was having a conversation
[1:00:10] with Satan
[1:00:14] Satan say to God you have a hedge around
[1:00:18] job
[1:00:25] I cannot attack you because you have a
[1:00:28] hedge around him
[1:00:32] this was not God saying that
[1:00:35] this was Satan
[1:00:39] so you tell me how did Satan know that
[1:00:42] there was a head he did more come on
[1:00:46] because he once tried to go
[1:00:50] and he could not touch him
[1:00:53] because God was protecting him
[1:00:57] and this hedge is nothing else but God
[1:01:00] himself
[1:01:02] he is
[1:01:07] just believe his word
[1:01:09] and on the Promises of God
[1:01:13] the moment you realize that that word
[1:01:17] the same as God himself
[1:01:22] that's what the Bible tells foreign
[1:02:23] dwelling bodily in Jesus Christ
[1:02:27] so he was Authority walking on two feet
[1:02:33] if we read out if we open our Bible to
[1:02:35] the Book of Luke
[1:02:37] Luke Chapter 5 and verse
[1:02:43] we see a sin when Jesus was walking
[1:02:48] not yet his disciples
[1:02:50] operate
[1:03:07] he said unto Simon
[1:03:10] uh
[1:03:15] sorry
[1:03:17] yeah go ahead
[1:03:19] now when he had left speaking he said
[1:03:20] unto Simon
[1:03:23] launch into the deep uh
[1:03:27] and let down your nets for a draw a uh
[1:03:38] verse five verses sank and Simon
[1:03:41] answering said unto him
[1:03:44] we have toiled all night
[1:03:47] and have taken nothing
[1:03:50] nevertheless
[1:03:52] at that word I would let down the net
[1:03:57] you see why they did not know this man
[1:04:01] in the Konichi Pakistan but they had
[1:04:04] seen his track record
[1:04:07] Open the Eyes of the blind
[1:04:11] heal the sick
[1:04:14] when Simon Peter
[1:04:17] heard what Jesus said
[1:04:20] Jesus told him throw your nets into the
[1:04:24] water
[1:04:25] for you to catch fish
[1:04:29] I believe Peter could have risen
[1:04:35] I've been fishing all night
[1:05:36] and they came and they filled Bots
[1:05:42] these ships began to sink
[1:05:46] this was a miracle
[1:05:48] why because Peter Pierre recognized the
[1:05:52] authority
[1:05:56] accepted it and he believed it and a
[1:06:01] miracle happened to him
[1:06:02] these nets were breaking
[1:06:05] which means they had never broken before
[1:06:10] First Catch of their lives
[1:06:16] so you see the word of God caters for
[1:06:19] each and every need you have in your
[1:06:22] life
[1:06:29] not just to save you
[1:06:31] but it's for Providence
[1:06:34] this was their job
[1:06:37] if they couldn't catch fish they were
[1:06:39] not going to feed their families
[1:06:43] we see the word of God was giving them
[1:06:46] privacy
[1:06:48] it was giving them their livelihood
[1:06:53] so if you believe the word of God
[1:06:56] did you even in your work remember
[1:06:59] I can Elevate you
[1:07:02] God can give you a promotion that you
[1:07:05] have never seen
[1:07:06] promotions
[1:07:09] [Music]
[1:07:11] that word has authorities
[1:07:15] to bring you up
[1:07:18] hallelujah hallelujah in other word the
[1:07:20] prophet of God
[1:07:22] well the Apostle says God this is
[1:07:26] Lord we have feast all night
[1:07:29] we are fishermen we know our business
[1:07:34] and there is just simply no fish out
[1:07:36] here
[1:07:38] I would imagine he said in his heart
[1:07:42] this is Peter now
[1:07:44] we fish through these Waters
[1:07:48] there is
[1:07:51] but Jesus but if Jesus said let them
[1:07:54] down
[1:08:16] because Jesus is the same yet today
[1:08:19] yesterday and forever
[1:08:25] he can do it for you
[1:08:27] if you stand on his words
[1:08:30] he can make his promises come to pass
[1:08:33] him he prefer promise uh
[1:08:35] he just stand on his words
[1:08:43] give you results in your life
[1:08:47] amen amen the prophet God says
[1:08:50] now maybe you went to every doctor in
[1:08:53] the season
[1:09:14] is on the we don't know what's wrong
[1:09:17] with you
[1:09:19] or maybe they've even found what's wrong
[1:09:21] with you
[1:09:23] and they'll tell you that there is no
[1:09:25] medical Realms to cure you if this is
[1:09:31] nothing in the world that can do for you
[1:09:33] it is
[1:09:35] but like what we say the other times
[1:09:38] you have to refuse that report
[1:09:42] and say I don't care what your reports
[1:09:45] I respect you respect you've gone to
[1:09:49] school for ten years
[1:09:56] but the word of God says
[1:10:00] hallelujah hallelujah and his experience
[1:10:04] yeah his certain experience because back
[1:10:06] throughout all eternity
[1:10:09] if you have two options
[1:10:11] to have a doctor who has two years
[1:10:14] experience
[1:10:15] dockyard experience to do so to do a
[1:10:18] heart surgery on you uh
[1:10:21] uh
[1:10:22] in operation the curl a doctor who has
[1:10:25] 45 years experience
[1:10:28] to perform the same surgery
[1:10:32] if you had an option to choose it was
[1:10:35] here whom are you going to pick
[1:10:38] two years doesn't experience the
[1:10:42] experience of 45 years experience
[1:10:44] I don't even have to ask
[1:10:47] for someone who has more experience
[1:10:51] someone who has a track record of never
[1:10:54] failing
[1:10:57] but why is it when a doctor tells you
[1:11:00] something
[1:11:03] prefer to believe
[1:11:11] who has never ever failed
[1:11:15] and he has an experience
[1:11:18] that stretches all the way back to
[1:11:21] Eternity
[1:11:40] [Applause]
[1:12:14] but
[1:12:20] just like Peter
[1:13:17] but
[1:13:20] this
[1:13:31] [Music]
[1:13:42] [Music]
[1:13:59] anxiety is
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:16] he can take you out of it
[1:14:19] amen amen the Bible says many other
[1:14:22] afflictions of the righteousness
[1:14:26] but it does not end right there
[1:14:30] is a bad God
[1:14:33] delivers them out of them they delivered
[1:14:37] characters
[1:14:40] that's a promise that's in the Bible
[1:14:47] so I come through to an Affliction
[1:14:51] Lord this is all
[1:14:53] where are you
[1:14:55] I'm waiting for my salvation
[1:14:59] I'm waiting for my freedom I'm waiting
[1:15:03] for my
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:40] his word has Authority
[1:15:43] he has never failed we serve a god of
[1:15:47] reputation
[1:15:49] reputation he is jealous of his
[1:15:51] reputation
[1:15:53] he will never let his people to be
[1:15:56] different Universe
[1:15:58] no matter what that is
[1:16:02] in Matthew chapter 8 and verse 5.
[1:16:07] this is when Jesus
[1:16:09] was walking into Captain
[1:16:13] he was approached by a centurions
[1:16:18] we all know this scripture
[1:16:21] verse 5 says and when Jesus was entered
[1:16:24] into kapinal verses
[1:16:27] they came unto him a centurion
[1:16:30] beseeching him
[1:16:32] and saying Lord
[1:16:34] my servant lied at home sick of the
[1:16:37] palace tormented
[1:16:44] and Jesus said
[1:16:47] unto him I will come and heal him
[1:16:51] the Centurion answered and said Lord
[1:16:55] I am not worthy thou should have come
[1:16:57] under my roof
[1:17:01] but speak the word only
[1:17:04] and my seven shall be here
[1:17:07] the word was not opened yet to the
[1:17:10] Gentiles
[1:17:12] at this time Jesus was only giving the
[1:17:15] word to the Jews
[1:17:19] of an outside Faith Message
[1:17:22] he had heard of Jesus and he had seen
[1:17:27] Jesus
[1:17:28] Healing The Sick
[1:17:30] casting out demons
[1:17:42] and he realized that this man has
[1:17:45] authorities
[1:17:48] there was something different about this
[1:17:52] and he acknowledged The Authority that
[1:17:54] Jesus
[1:17:57] the word of God will never have effect
[1:17:59] in your life if you do not acknowledge
[1:18:01] it
[1:18:02] is
[1:18:05] the promises of God will never work for
[1:18:08] you unless you accept them and you
[1:18:09] acknowledge them for your life
[1:18:16] it does not matter how good it looks
[1:18:18] like
[1:18:19] that person you have to be willing to
[1:18:21] step into that promise
[1:18:25] remember the last time we talked about
[1:18:27] the 10 spies and Joshua and Kayla
[1:18:30] the promise was laying there
[1:18:33] go take the land but if they were not
[1:18:37] going to go fight they were not going to
[1:18:38] get that promise
[1:18:41] promise but Joshua and Caleb they
[1:18:45] accepted it he's not accepted he say
[1:18:47] this is our promise foreign
[1:19:42] I used I never caught it in the first uh
[1:19:45] in verse 9.
[1:19:49] until I read it another time
[1:19:53] he did not say for I am a man of
[1:19:56] authorities
[1:20:00] when I these people listen to me because
[1:20:02] I'm a man of authority
[1:20:05] he says for I'm a man under a man
[1:20:11] this is why when I tell my servants to
[1:20:14] do this they will do it myself
[1:20:17] so he was not speaking of his own
[1:20:20] authority
[1:20:23] he was speaking of the Roman government
[1:20:26] authorities
[1:20:29] he says from I'm a man under the Roman
[1:20:33] government authorities
[1:20:37] I speak to my servant because
[1:20:40] they listen to me could so he recognized
[1:20:45] that Jesus was on another different
[1:20:47] level
[1:20:50] he was under Authority
[1:20:53] the authority of the father daughter
[1:20:56] such that when he will speak take a seat
[1:20:59] belt and cast out demons they would
[1:21:03] recognize that authorities
[1:21:08] Miracles would happen
[1:21:10] because he was under authorities
[1:21:14] so if you and me so see we are under the
[1:21:19] authority of Jesus Christ
[1:21:20] [Applause]
[1:21:22] it is not your Authority
[1:21:25] but it's Christ's Authority that's
[1:21:27] working
[1:21:29] so that's why when you speak When you
[1:21:34] pray
[1:21:35] situations have to change the situation
[1:21:38] demons have to flee the demand you are
[1:21:41] free because you are foreign
[1:22:03] well the sons of skeva wanted to chase
[1:22:05] away demons and they said in the name of
[1:22:07] Jesus that Paul preaches he says
[1:22:12] the sons of didn't know this Jesus that
[1:22:14] Paul was speaking about it
[1:22:18] this demon said Paul we know
[1:22:22] Paul Jesus we know
[1:22:24] but who are you
[1:22:40] or how much audacity you have oh
[1:22:43] communities
[1:22:46] who create you might be shouting the
[1:22:49] name of Jesus as loud as you want yellow
[1:22:51] knowledge
[1:22:52] but if you are not under the authority
[1:22:56] those demons are gonna fold their hands
[1:23:02] and ask you if the Monday Jesus we know
[1:23:06] but who are you
[1:23:09] amen amen so we have to know they work
[1:23:13] on it and have to make sure
[1:23:15] that we submit ourselves under the
[1:23:18] authority of Jesus Christ
[1:23:21] amen amen and we will be able to operate
[1:23:25] under that rotation
[1:23:28] in verse 13. Jesus said unto the
[1:23:31] Centurion
[1:23:34] and as thou has believed
[1:23:41] and his servant was healed self same
[1:23:45] hour yeah
[1:23:47] why his servant was healed because he
[1:23:50] recognized the authority of Jesus Christ
[1:23:55] amen amen in the Queen of Sheba the
[1:23:58] prophet of God
[1:24:01] he said I'm a man and Authority it is
[1:24:07] which means that he had a hand men under
[1:24:10] him
[1:24:12] he said I'm a man under Authority
[1:24:15] and I say to this man go and he goes
[1:24:20] this man come and he comes
[1:24:23] to say those people are under my
[1:24:25] authorities
[1:24:27] and I didn't even thought myself worthy
[1:24:30] to come to you
[1:24:33] none of my nation
[1:25:02] [Music]
[1:25:32] husband or wife is sufficient
[1:25:36] if there is none of them there a senior
[1:25:39] person just raise up your hands
[1:25:42] he is sufficient always
[1:25:45] just wherever you are
[1:25:48] believe it it is a finished work
[1:25:53] hallelujah hallelujah if you believe him
[1:25:55] at his words
[1:25:57] that's a finished work
[1:25:59] it is
[1:26:04] that word has Authority
[1:26:07] just the same as he has
[1:26:10] that's why the disciples were on that
[1:26:12] boat
[1:26:13] set back and Jesus had told them I will
[1:26:16] catch up with you later
[1:26:19] when they saw him walking on the water
[1:26:22] we don't view uh marches you know they
[1:26:25] couldn't believe it they thought it was
[1:26:28] a ghost
[1:26:30] but Peter real when they realized that
[1:26:33] it was Jesus
[1:26:36] said Lord if it is
[1:26:42] he didn't say if it is
[1:26:45] notion me to come uh
[1:27:16] he was going to defy the law of buoyancy
[1:27:22] he was not going to sink uh
[1:27:26] [Music]
[1:27:34] say that if you you cannot walk on water
[1:27:37] if you get on water you will see people
[1:27:40] lose
[1:27:45] but Paul Peter said Lord say bid me to
[1:27:50] come a priorities in your face Jesus
[1:27:52] said come
[1:27:54] he confidently got out of that boat
[1:27:56] affected confidence
[1:27:58] he knew that he was going to walk
[1:28:02] why because Jesus
[1:28:05] amen amen so you just say Lord you don't
[1:28:09] need much I just need your words
[1:28:13] because your words can make me the five
[1:28:17] laws that that exists
[1:28:20] that say cancer cannot be healed
[1:28:23] concerned
[1:28:39] defying the laws of buoyancy
[1:28:44] but then he started looking at the
[1:28:45] weights
[1:28:47] that's the first mistake he did
[1:28:51] that fit he should have kept on looking
[1:28:53] at the words
[1:28:56] because Jesus was the world
[1:28:59] who said the spoken word
[1:29:02] so he should have kept his eyes on the
[1:29:04] world
[1:29:06] he made that mistake and he started
[1:29:10] it's like no way I could be walking yeah
[1:29:16] but he did the right thing
[1:29:19] Lord please save me
[1:29:23] the Bible did not tell us how far he was
[1:29:26] away from Jesus
[1:29:30] but the Bible tells that instantly
[1:29:34] he held his hand and he saved him
[1:29:39] it does not matter where you are
[1:29:42] cry to the
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:30:42] and if we amen
[1:31:24] right
[1:31:26] amen amen
[1:31:28] that was Mary in the New Testament
[1:31:31] she was carrying the word
[1:31:35] you and me in this last day
[1:31:38] we have to become the world
[1:31:42] hallelujah hallelujah brother sister
[1:31:44] just believe that right
[1:31:47] Lazarus he was dead for four days
[1:31:51] he was having a good old time in heaven
[1:31:53] already
[1:31:56] they say if someone goes to heaven they
[1:31:58] never want to come back on Earth
[1:32:03] was a rich man he had stuff to enjoy
[1:32:05] here anyway
[1:32:09] he was already in heaven
[1:32:12] but he heard a voicemail
[1:32:17] he had to stop the fellowship he was
[1:32:19] having
[1:32:20] he was probably talking to Father
[1:32:23] Abraham
[1:32:24] he says hold on
[1:33:00] your situation what a situation your dad
[1:33:03] situation
[1:33:05] hopeless situations
[1:33:11] if you take him at his words
[1:33:18] why can't he do it for you
[1:33:21] God do the same thing for you Brothers
[1:33:25] amen amen because he's the same
[1:33:27] yesterday
[1:33:38] that word
[1:33:40] made sure Jesus could not stay in the
[1:33:43] grave I figured as you couldn't
[1:33:44] preparations that word my Holy One shall
[1:33:47] not see corruption
[1:33:51] had enough power to raise Jesus from the
[1:33:54] dead
[1:33:57] they sealed him in a tomb Allah but that
[1:34:01] word had enough power
[1:34:07] and resurrect him
[1:34:11] the same word
[1:34:13] give the same spirit that was in Jesus
[1:34:17] if that same Spirit dwells in you see
[1:34:19] the memories

[1:34:59] speaking perfectly No Grave can hold you
[1:35:02] back
[1:35:03] if it rolled away the stone for this
[1:35:07] is

[1:35:21] be responsible irresponsible and
[1:35:24] powerful enough to raise you up
[1:35:27] take you out of your Affliction
[1:35:30] take you out of your sins
[1:35:37] please amen
[1:35:40] amen
[1:35:41] the prophet of God says in expectations
[1:35:45] he says and I'll say this
[1:35:48] God keeps his word every time
[1:35:52] that he said and every promise
[1:35:57] he keeps every word that he said and
[1:35:59] every problem
[1:36:01] it says if you take the right mental
[1:36:04] attitude
[1:36:06] foreign
[1:37:10] the word of God will defeat the enemy
[1:37:13] definition
[1:37:16] anywhere in uh
[1:37:20] anytime
[1:37:21] the word of God will defeat the enemy
[1:37:24] any place anywhere anytime
[1:37:31] it doesn't matter where you are
[1:37:34] it doesn't matter what time it is
[1:37:41] open that word
[1:37:44] claim it for yourself
[1:37:51] all I just need is one the word Lord
[1:37:55] speak the words
[1:37:57] I had this one testimony
[1:38:00] one of the brothers were hunting with
[1:38:02] the prophet
[1:38:04] and the prophet told his brother that
[1:38:06] you are going to shoot your dear
[1:38:09] uh
[1:38:13] he said you said what yeah I'm going to
[1:38:16] shoot a deer uh
[1:38:19] he let the other brothers go and hunt
[1:38:23] and he went to sleep under a tree
[1:38:27] and he says if the prophet said I'm
[1:38:30] going to shoot a deer you know I don't
[1:38:33] have to go looking for it
[1:38:35] he went and he slept under a tree
[1:38:39] then he woke up he said something was
[1:38:42] sniffing at his toes
[1:38:48] he got up and he shot it
[1:39:00] I don't have to go around
[1:39:02] beating pushes and all that yeah
[1:39:06] God's word has that power
[1:39:11] that dear that I'm supposed to shoot is
[1:39:15] going to come to me
[1:39:18] promises
[1:39:21] have enough power to bring your desires
[1:39:26] to you that may never vote foreign
[1:39:45] [Music]
[1:40:02] idea because God has never failed
[1:40:05] Through the Bible
[1:40:07] from Genesis 1 to Revelation chapter 20.
[1:40:12] he has never ever failed
[1:40:15] why should he start failing on you
[1:40:19] take him on his word
[1:40:21] and rest
[1:40:23] the prophet of God he says nearly
[1:40:27] everyone that really truly serves God
[1:40:33] meets them kind of times
[1:40:37] sometimes you wonder how you're gonna
[1:40:39] get the kids some shoes for school
[1:40:44] how are you going to make this bill and
[1:40:47] that bill come over
[1:40:49] he says don't worry
[1:40:52] there's only one thing you need to do
[1:40:54] yeah
[1:40:56] rest on his promises
[1:40:59] I've never seen the righteous
[1:41:02] foreign
[1:42:02] foreign
[1:43:10] before God sends a message he has to
[1:43:13] prepare a people
[1:43:16] who can receive that message
[1:43:19] and it's this last day that you and me
[1:43:23] towards the more can accept the message
[1:43:27] amen that message it's a massage did not
[1:43:30] come from Jefferson
[1:43:32] that message came from God
[1:43:35] and that message has enough power to
[1:43:40] translate your body
[1:43:42] that message the

[1:43:56] we gotta become the word
[1:43:59] he came down
[1:44:02] to his bride I say sonipus
[1:44:05] in Isaiah 9 6.
[1:44:10] unto us a child is born
[1:44:12] and to us a son is given
[1:44:16] the government shall be upon him
[1:44:20] what is government
[1:44:23] means Authority
[1:44:26] The Authority is on his shoulders
[1:44:30] his shoulder is on his body
[1:44:33] his shoulder is his body
[1:44:37] Isaiah is telling us that yes
[1:44:40] the government shall be upon his body
[1:44:44] and we know who the body of Christ
[1:44:47] the body of Christ
[1:44:50] his authority is on you and me
[1:44:53] Hallelujah in the thinking man's field
[1:44:56] of the Prophet that God says
[1:44:59] and later on we got through the sermon
[1:45:02] yeah
[1:45:03] and we went out west new
[1:45:06] and when the Angels up of the Lord
[1:45:09] appeared out there for the Seven Seals
[1:45:15] and it went up in the air

[1:45:35] authority uh
[1:45:39] La Plante

[1:45:52] hallelujah hallelujah that that cloud
[1:45:55] says
[1:45:56] representing the white wig
[1:45:58] representative
[1:45:59] representing Authority representative he
[1:46:03] says he's the head of the body
[1:46:05] and his authorities upon his shoulders
[1:46:09] so his authority is on the bride
[1:46:13] so the authority of the word
[1:46:16] on the Christians

[1:46:26] that same Authority is on you this
[1:46:30] morning
[1:46:32] everything that was in God
[1:46:34] was poured into Christ

[1:46:41] hallelujah hallelujah so when God the
[1:46:44] country before the foundation of the
[1:46:46] world he had that power he kicked
[1:46:49] Lucifer from Heaven
[1:46:52] on that Easter uh Easter Saturday is
[1:46:56] somebody back when Christ went to hell
[1:47:00] he had that same power that was in God
[1:47:05] and he kicked Satan in hell

[1:47:13] we can kick Satan on this Earth
[1:47:18] all his devices
[1:47:21] all his powers

[1:47:27] to us
[1:47:29] we might try to come and afflict you
