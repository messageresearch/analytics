to read in the name of the lord jesus christ because there are no graves in egypt that thou has taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore has thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of egypt for it has been better for us to serve the egyptians then we should die in the wilderness moses said unto the people fear he not stand still for the egyptians whom we have seen today and if we just add a little bit to psalm chapter 46 ma'am showing what god has done on earth to be uh careful he makes wars his season to the end of the end of the earth is [Music] i'm exalted you can catch the fear and the children of israel is they said hold on to moses why did you bring us in the wilderness left us in egypt where we could serve [Applause] but the lord is going to tell you this morning i'm warning you my brothers and sisters god could never deliver israel with a tender hand he couldn't deliver them without any challenges around him [Applause] the people of israel had to feel the challenges and they had i'm warning [Applause] but looking at the invisible [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] they prefer [Applause] they started loving them [Applause] god remembered his words that he made to abraham he let that sound great he came down he told moses i remember my word god made to abraham i told him that's it was because of the cries that the oppression [Applause] god will stay silent now let's go hello now i've invested abraham god made that that promise and he was faithful to you brother brother i'm saying rested [Applause] he [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] a little bit of that word be be uh uh uh be left out we met yes my brothers that's why god came down [Music] [Applause] [Applause] out from a nation you had to lead them from a nation same thing that the lord did when he was on earth when the lord jesus is [Applause] of the the the old testament john the baptist there there was 400 years no prophets on earth and you know that between john the baptist and jesus christ there is there is only a space of six months ages god sent us a prophet in the first church and it's it had happened a lot of years [Applause] he appeared [Applause] until we got to the seventh church god sends us the prophets of mahaprabhu to bring the church oh that's right outside out of the tradition the traditions of the world [Applause] outside of the traditions [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] when circumstances come amen what is the greatest miracle that you have seen your father to you and billy paul student said jeffrey they got the shows i saw great things but there is one great thing that i've seen from my father second [Applause] he says that my father had had the ability to control every circumstance no matter how big the circumstances [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] hello [Applause] he knows all things this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] those are my favorite a quote [Applause] i will send you a live to the prophet before the great day arrives [Applause] for him [Applause] it says paragraph 30 33 33 episode [Applause] now he says look at israel in in a tight situation after coming out [Applause] is they've been entangled out there somewhere and just swallowed them down if they started that way there was the red sea before them and they couldn't get across that cave [Applause] they [Applause] [Applause] the situation began to pray and the lord spoke to moses and moses run among the people on set they never thought they stand still i love that that's what israel when god told the people of israel to stand still and see the deliverance brother what i'm saying they're secular for fair it says that's what you have today stand still see the salvation of god stand still and and observe how would you like to know that that card in the doctor's office the office that you looked at and that he turned down and wrote more death across it that [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] has look at a man coming with miracles and that we could not contest see little prophet we know that he's your prayer yes my brother sister [Applause] [Applause] the situation belongs to god our god is a specialist against so many people he's a specialist in things that man that's what brother brandon said remember [Applause] when you find yourself in a difficult time possible capacity the situation that's above your head normally don't look to a man don't look to a woman look look up [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] sickness [Applause] he can only make you afraid that's all he can do as long as he says as long as you have not realized that the devil and god does not do you see how the devil steals from you he says oh the devil tells you oh you can't do this [Applause] everything is possible to those who believe [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] when he pronounces that word [Applause] and [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] and that [Applause] the devil cannot resist against the words of encouragement that god was pronouncing for us [Applause] god is encouraging don't fear little little flock everything [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] and it cannot are not part of our lives but god says i came to bring you love courage and capacity courageous [Applause] god needs those strong people who can take his word about that hold the words keep god by his word and see his word operates among us [Music] as if we don't know who we are work or could walk by himself god has never created it so that man does everything by himself but god created [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] we we think that they're singing but they're actually talking you know what i'm gonna do brother brother hello they were talking to each other from another word of god [Applause] but why is it that they complain all the time they're not happy as we are they complain every day you i told them that you always have to have to be happy god doesn't want you to be sad do you know what brings sadness they're about 60 the cause of all sickness sadness it says that it's 60 the cause of all the sickness yes it's the truth it's those
