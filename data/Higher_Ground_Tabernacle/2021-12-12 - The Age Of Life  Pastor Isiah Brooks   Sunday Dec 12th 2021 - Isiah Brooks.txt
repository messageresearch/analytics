tuesday [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] my feet [Applause] glory to god hallelujah he's truly worthy to be praised glad to see isaiah i thought he takes me otherwise but anyway god moves god is good to us you may be seated for just a moment we really thank god for everybody this morning and we appreciate the true uh saints of god [Music] [Music] and they were sharing their concerns [Music] many of you were offended [Music] or shocked the last time i spoke there were a lot of things happening during that time and to be honest with you i was at times angry and and the reason being i was under the influence that many of you have been gossiping about a situation that had occurred but they had a breach in their uh marriage contract and i was told that the sisters felt like i should have expounded on it more so [Music] not trying to hurt anybody's feelings or misplace the word in any way but i believe the man uh the husband of this white woman uh chose to forgive her for uh but i do want to say by the grace of god the spirit of fornication and the spirit of adultery is not something that we must do and this all even should do it it is evil in the eyes of god but it's not something that you cannot be forgiven for [Music] [Music] and put ourselves in that position of the of the fallen brother or sister [Music] and we should treat each other in the way that we would want to be treated this is the capstone ministry and this is a ministry of love [Music] now i like to say by god's grace to reiterate that fornication don't let the spirit get on you release please where you think that that's all right and that you know this church is saying okay you know if you do it you'll be forgiven specifically okay [Music] so uh i i just want to say that without saying names because everybody knows who i'm speaking of and those of you those of you who don't know you don't need [Music] comparing you to the church that i once had in ohio uh my my doing that was not to offend you so that you could know that there's a higher level of worship [Music] whatever country he would go in whether it was africa whether it was india whether it's america he said those who get filled with the holy ghost they act the same way and so i am trying to bring the church to a higher level some of you don't have the holy ghost and i do not want the satan to deceive you making you believe that you got it when you don't so i'm going to say things over this poor people to make you question or to make you examine whether you have it or not is that right i'm not doing anything less than paul did paul said examine yourself to see whether you'll be in the faith this is a late hour so i wanted to say those things and i know we've been speaking working on getting us here on time [Music] i couldn't help but to smile component when i speak to your founder i am intentionally trying to better you just say and better myself dude sometimes we make decisions [Music] to make that child a better character my last thing that i think i could remember i didn't write them down but i should initials even paul when you heard about what was happening in the corinthians church members paul said i heard that some were walking disorderly and he said i believe so paul wasn't there to witness it but he heard about it and he believed hallelujah now my thing is i told the brothers yesterday i will no longer look at you as congolese from now on you're christians from now on your brothers right from now on your sisters and i will try my that i wish i did not know but i will never judge you again based on experiences that i've had with others am i making myself clear so my thing is it's what i'm trying to say even when it came to the situation with the brothers and his wife when it comes to uh things that i have said and done i found myself guilty of gossiping just like you do and i'm not trying to justify myself i'm saying i hate it but i also find out that it's so easy to get into that and sometimes we we we started off but it's not right so i'ma ask that you pray for me like i i i will pray for you another incident that did happen our brother wasn't there but he'll know who i'm speaking today i was at his house some time ago and uh i made the uh uh i concluded in my mind oh my defeat that they were talking uh about me or saying things they should not be should not have been saying because they were speaking in french and that's all you can do is speak french you have no choice [Music] you don't know me [Music] so i want to say to the brother that i thought was talking about me and forgive me for voicing that to other people without insulting you you understand me you understand me because i thought in myself that was something that a brother could not tell another brother you understand what i'm saying i thought congolese brothers don't tell each other i love you now i'm just letting you know my mind i'm letting you think you know me and that was that was amazing to me because i'm the one that says i love you all the time but then i make people so nervous when i do that you know what i'm saying i know the kind of age we're living in but i just want you to know i got my wife [Laughter] right so we love each other and and honestly i i don't have and and i was thinking about this last night then i'm gonna get right right into the word i was thinking about this last night because there are a group of young brothers that i normally just take on them i took under my wings [Music] i love young people and i i see the need of fellowship but i want to say that you all are welcome just call me before you come i believe all right you all are welcome if you want to go out to dinner sometime let me know i love you okay and i don't have a respected person i don't we have a respected person [Music] one more apology and i'm gonna go back with the [Music] and these young brothers know i hate slumping y'all know what i mean but you see how the human mind works the way you come on this to you i thought before good job is that right and the bible said that love only thing's good thank you i went home and i prayed i prayed this morning because i am i have a goal in mind and that goal is perfection under whatever cost it doesn't there is no whatever whatever it may take for this to be so let it be shallow you love the lord amen god is good to us amen amen what almighty god we serve let's just sing a little bit of that and then we'll get right into the word of god what almighty god we serve what almighty god [Music] heaven and earth [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] jesus oh amen and one more thing i did not know [Music] [Music] spoke to me postpartum the sentence it is a it is something that women go through some do after they are have the baby [Music] [Music] because not only did that uh postpartum describe the sister that we're talking about that's postpartum um it also made me see what happened to my daughter [Music] and she suffered such a chronic uh postpartum and i felt you postpartum that she was in [Music] but we didn't recognize [Music] the bible says that they will know them because of the love that they have [Music] as we stand let us turn to the word of god according to romans 8 2011. those of you who have not listened to it is the rising of the sun 1965. certainly such a powerful message show me such person do i ask the lord jesus where is she where is she so i asked the lord jesus oh demando signia where is she [Music] where is she brother brown is describing a bride a church a powerhouse not a system system not just church goers that have been changed by the quickening power of the holy ghost not only just in myself but in others romans 8 11 or manchester united but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in is read there the 17 through the 18th verse of the first chapter of revelations just gonna say did you and when i saw him i failed at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last village of i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death we thank you for everything that you've done for us lord if we could just grasp within our hearts all that you have done for us and move toward it it would make us a better christian god i pray by your loving arms in your loving heart that you revealed all of this word to [Music] in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated you know it's people think christianity is a wimp religion jean-paul scott a real woman to be a christian christians can do things that sinners cannot do the criticism and one of the things that christians can do that most of us can't do and that is to humble themselves one of the things that i love about brother brad was his humility humility and brother branham wasn't so great of a man and when a real man when a man can just humble himself beyond under the word that's what makes him the man when you can be obedient sisters to the word of god that's what makes you a real woman there are those who have named that they have a life or live and the bible says they're dead and personally i don't want to be that kind of a christian that have a name that millions of them that says that god is with them millions or many of them don't say that they know the lord millions and many of them said they read the bible and perhaps some of them read their bibles more than we do millions and many of them goes to church millions and many of them give their offerings entitled to payload you either for god because it's what or you are against god hallelujah y'all understand me now we look at this thing and you and i must understand that when it comes to jesus christ we must know that we must be crucified with him he he doesn't bear the cross alone in the book anymore because jesus told his disciples take up your cross and follow me a cross is nothing uh easy to bear like what you chose it is difficult it was difficult for our lord but he bore the cross and he despised the shame um for you and i i am crucified with christ jesus nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in and gave himself for me sometimes a lonely life [Music] but i wonder how many of us i live by the faith of the son of god hallelujah amen so you can understand the scripture it's not like i'm living by the faith this is a thing by it makes the life that we live as christians perhaps of the more than a conqueror was it the more than a country and we find out that uh this man would work a job working all week we're more than a conqueror you can't save yourself you can't work to save yourself there's nothing you can do to save yourself he conquered death hell and the grace it makes you more than a conqueror because you're now receiving the benefits which is the paycheck is that right and brother branham said whatever that now we look at these things and you say what brother books why would you say i don't have the holy ghost i don't know who you are but i do believe that there are some of us who don't have it yes and i believe with all of my heart there is a way out yet there's a way out of all of us hallelujah and the only way that you're going to get out of where you are in this religious realm is that you must leave the needless things behind the village and you must choose the needful things is the shows there's only thing only only one thing we need yeah and that is christ everything else is needless to choose i don't need a house to get to heaven i don't need a car to get there i don't need a buddy or best friend to get to heaven i don't need nothing of this world to and you said that's not important it is because if you're not careful you can be entangled again you could be like miss lot with me brother brown said she had loved ones was thinking about don't touch and she all of a sudden turned because hello so i'm bringing it down to you as an individual this morning hallelujah there's only one life brother i'm saying found in the easter there's only one life one eternal spirit one eternal life and that's god this is a jew god alone jesus is the eternal [Music] examine yourself don't look at your neighbor what might be wrong with them but examine yourself hallelujah and then he said god he says and the thoughts is expressed and become a word then each individual in here that possesses the eternal this eternal life people say what he said each individual that possesses this eternal life was before the foundation of the world in god's thinking did you hear what i said i didn't say each individual believe the message of the world of the aforementioned in god's thinking and we have preachers preaching the people very quote and they don't even know the people don't even know you've got to be born again for this to apply to you not just a church member pastor might remember jesus you've got to have crossed that journey hallelujah and a word excuse me right and a word has taken life be i'm gotta mix that but one of one of the things i'm not what i used to be don't know what i'm trying to say but he said you traveled from somewhere and i believe a lot of us have traveled and some of us are struggling with sanctification when some of us have actually conquered sanctification but you can't get filled fully with the holy spirit until you conquered sanctification hallelujah and then god will come down and fill you with the holy ghost are you listening to what i'm saying i'm talking about rapturing material i'm talking in a lava mixture hallelujah why because he come to put a new nature in us his nature hallelujah is that all right a word has taken life and it's eternal that's the reason we have eternal life in the same principle that the great son of god the redeemer we've come to in the same message you don't remember search brother who says this satan doesn't care so i don't know how religious you are how right you are in your doctrine you miss that lie it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again this is where we need to set focus you understand me we don't have to have all of the shouting and dancing but one thing we need if we're going to be a powerhouse if we if if god amen is going to do something in this church if there is ever a unity that will be formed in this church it will be done by the holy ghost only by the holy ghost sir because you fellowship together doesn't mean that you are not united but we want the union amen the united to come together by the holy ghost hallelujah so let's examine ourselves to see if we're in the faith listen to what he says in question and answers hallelujah he said but this message that i'm preaching is the true message of this day because you're just as much into it as i am you are messengers of the same message remember now hello somebody have you been a messenger since you've come into this message who have you witnessed too who have you talked to who have you told that the lord is soon to come who have you told about 1963 at the appearing of the law y'all understand me you must understand if you're not a messenger of this message you may not even be bride i didn't say you were is that all right so you must understand you are messenger of the message hallelujah i'm so glad y'all shouting praise god amen i shouldn't be doing that but anyway by the grace of god the polygamy we must understand and i'm doing a lot of reading this morning because i really want you to know what i'm saying is from this message hallelujah so i just pray that you you listen well and i want the word of god to really saturate your soul so that uh how many of y'all ever read the story about the man in in the scripture new testament he went to his boss man and he asked that boss man forgive me and there was a man who owed him yeah and instead of forgiving giving his death he beat the man and had him thrown in jail well the news of what this man did to his servant got back to the big balls and when the big balls heard this he called the servant in which he had forgiven himself servants the judge said this because of your wickedness everything i forgave you for will come back to you hello somebody the bride of jesus christ knows how to forgive hallelujah and so every son and daughter of god knows how to forgive so if we're trying to follow the message of the hour or at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the life of christ for you see cause that's good if it don't you lay around [Music] is one of the grandest ages of ages to learn the glucose desire this layer to see in church age is the grandest of all all the church ages because it's the ending of time and it's more sin in this age and the power of satan is many times harder to fight against you than it was in any age of peace [Music] this is the age that's elijah that children is going to turn against parents mothers are going to turn against fathers is that right loved ones will turn on each other and it's happening right now [Music] [Applause] if it was possible remember christ spoke of of an elected people hallelujah for the last day now i don't know what are you thinking and how you're thinking but i'm one of them it doesn't matter the background your mama could have been a prostitute your daddy could have been whatever it doesn't matter how you got here the blood of jesus has cleansed you has washed you away has brought you to a place that you can be part of what god called his bride hallelujah now hallelujah let me move on see it would deceive the very elected so that's the truth if it were possible so close the people so live people can live clean holy life not be sinful and drinkers and liars and gamblers we all must be born again we all must have the holy ghost we all must grow into the statue of a perfect man that's the word wouldn't it be a sad situation if we fall into this category i just heard brother say it in the rising of the sun he said his mom was a peculiar person and she had five dreams all of her life but he said every one of those dreams were correct and he said his mom dreamed a dream that he was going up three stairs two three stairs and at the top of that step third step was a a pearl a pearl a pearl that literally became a floor but she but because she didn't listen she found it she traveled that road the road got narrower and narrower and narrower and all of a sudden she found herself falling into hell [Applause] he said you can be saint uh uh uh baptized you've been but then you can have the holy ghost and still go to hell y'all think it yeah yeah you you don't see see what it is you look at us and we try to tell you and then you do it anyway but you failed to see the all she and i is watching it ain't about me i never understood that kind of stuff in my life my sisters used to wear those high-hair shoes and myself as soon as they got in the house trying to take a mouse because they hurt their feet yeah it's going to hurt your foot all crunched up in there like that yeah i see some of y'all sisters come in here and y'all sit down and put them shoes on the other side i'm just ain't nobody looking at your feet like that yeah hallelujah let's move on it's okay i'm gonna preach it anyway see this is the age of life personal life of christ where christ the chemical is the chemical of his body you know i i got excited and i i just want to preach it because i know i'm doing all these quotes but you can read or you can study uh uh it is the rising of the sun but brother branham says that not only does god wants to anoint your insides but he wants to anoint your spirit that love spirit has anointed that individual and i think about that once it turns out for the anointing of allah allah can announce your spirit where other people would come into a room he brought the atmosphere hallelujah and they could feel the presence of the lord so much everybody was watching the thoughts that they were making hallelujah that is also for the bride of jesus christ it was oh you don't believe that but i'm going to bring it to you in just a minute now i know i got to read amen move on first under justification the water baptism second and under the new birth of wesley sanctification which cleanses and thirdly under the baptism of the holy ghost the holy spirit is putting that sanctified vessel into service that's what you've seen the word sanctified means it's a compound greek word which means [Music] and we'll notice when the unclean spirit is gone from a man that's what has happened many of us we came to the message we were excited about it we come through the justification we come to the sanctification and that's where some have been deceived hallelujah yes because you feel good how do you you live in a moral life but it doesn't stop you know you're ready now let's move on i want something he says that's exactly what the church has done baptism methodist those who believe in sanctification jesus said like the unclean spirit that went out jesus returns back to this church body and find the house garnish and swept clean living pure clean right but then if that house isn't field occupied then he comes in with seven other evil demons worse than he was and the last stage of this place is seven times worse than it does it was at the first place they've had been better to stay lutheran than it would [Music] us because if we're not if we don't understand or we come to a place that we have been saying it's got to be changed and what i'm saying is the dynamics and the mechanics must a christian must have power however you want to put it but there must be an anointing there must be an anointing god's anointing not just within but also without is that right it goes with the scripture that god has built a wall of fire about us what is that wall of fire but god himself hallelujah we're not supposed to be in a place where we're barely making it through this age hallelujah because we are more than conquerors we're more than conquerors more than conquerors but you got to take a hold of your benefits hallelujah oh come on somebody it's just as simple as this it's a sampler if you had a rich daddy and the rich daddy has placed you in his will and the rich daddy dies no but in his policy may see he left everything to you yeah a mansion fancy cars beautiful swimming pool whatever lots of land lots of cattle lots of everything hallelujah how many of you how many of you seeing what god has done your daddy did for you after getting over the grief after getting over the grief you're going to try [Music] you're going to enjoy what he left you you know what happened you're going to love daddy even better yes you can is that right the bible said cast all your cares upon him because he cares for you all of them not some of them but all of them remember i said the other night at what point in time i don't want to talk about when will we meet the prince of peace [Music] were you going to meet him in the air no no you got to meet him here first no matter what you're going through grandpa the problem you love the lord i mean look at psalms 103 you don't have to turn there some song but but psalms 103 tells you about all the benefits some sort he's your heel he's your deliverer he's your savior bless the lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name and forget it and forget not all of his benefits hallelujah that's what the policy gives you hallelujah not only did he die but he was raised again and the greatest part of the benefit is that he's willing to give himself to you he's willing to come live in you hallelujah he's willing to work for you walk for you talk for you live for you that's what paul said i can't do it the good that i would i don't do it that kind of thing i don't want to do i find myself doing it but then paul had another testimony hallelujah he said it's not that i live i'm living now but it's not that i live it's christ that lives in me hallelujah and you and i must understand that god has given us a victory in these things i was tired uh other things were happening in my life and it was really bad i i just felt like just laying around the house something comes to you but then god quickened me i'll he quickened me in this message and i said i'll never let that happen to me again not as long god has no other choice but to hear what you've got to say jewish [Applause] when the devil brings all this crazy stuff into your life and you begin to sing praises to god hallelujah so glad i'm here i'm so glad i'm here i'm so glad i'm here in jesus name [Applause] the word brought me here oh the devil can't stand that he want to see you crying and worrying because he knows when you go through all those changes he's gotten you away from the words hallelujah [Music] and i've learned how to be exalted hallelujah but he's going to give glory to god and no matter what he goes through hallelujah that's where god wants us this is good that's the kind of life hallelujah i don't think i'll say it like this i can't preach all of this in my message but i want to try to get to something here when it comes to this life you don't necessarily need to know it but i i left all my family for me or let's put it this way my family disowned me for this message and and and they really thought i was crazy following a man like brother branham even to this day nobody calls me and if i want to hear from them i have to call them you and when god separated me i have never had a desire to go back the only family i have that's what is my immediate family and the family of god for me and and i want you to understand what i'm saying because almost all of us in this is in that same boat especially being in this message hallelujah now are we going to be are we going to be uh one of those ones that look back to what we used to be that's a problem let me see let me say this let me hurry up because i've taken a lot of time sometimes away from you and i don't want to i don't want to i don't want the impact of the message to get away from you what is the power of the holy ghost and we talk about as beneficiaries we ought to prove his life in us but we know that jesus didn't just die he rose again hallelujah and the light there's never was a life lived like it before he was the son of god and he [Music] a commissioned and how can we do it by word only see that's it not by word only you know everybody has this little thing you know us we're in the message and you know we've got deep revelations that's all i've i can see some of y'all not it's just whatever it is it is what it is but i'm telling you the truth you know i'm so glad you're all paying me attention and all that good stuff this is awkward and you know i look at things and i wonder what's happening with the people because when the world when it does come you know we we find ourselves looking everywhere and you can't do that i don't believe you i really don't believe you're multitasking if anybody should be tired as those ones who just got out from work yes but so we understand but my point is when you come into the word into the house of god i'm preaching a message and i think i think i don't know but i hope because i'm not preaching my thoughts because i'm preaching his thoughts hallelujah so we we we're looking at this thing and it goes on to say and how can we do it it's by the word only of the holy spirit dynamics and the mechanics has come together and that same power that raised him from the dead he said if you believe it it will quicken your mortal body it will bring you to a place where you become as a prophet said an invincible lion thirsty for the power of god to live soft of evil you know i'm not saying that because you have the power of god going to have you raised in the dead but one thing for certain i know the bible said these signs shall follow them that believe me now the very essence of the message that was sent that he is risen from the dead we we we we are his beneficiaries we who share the resurrection with him draws benefits from this by proving to the world that that where are you pointing see what are you reflecting what are you reflecting that's true let's say like this who are you reflecting let's watch it doesn't matter grandpa even if you just got a little faith he said you can say to a mountain video be moved you know we said
