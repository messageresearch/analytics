[5:32] I will rejoice amen I I was told that
[5:41] different ones was going to come to
[5:44] service tonight but it looked like
[5:46] somehow the enemy has hindered them but
[5:50] anyway I had these thoughts on my heart
[5:54] in my mind and I've known that these
[6:01] brothers wanted to understand baptism
[6:05] and so some of my message will be
[6:08] dealing with that but we're still
[6:09] dealing with the truth of God's Word and
[6:13] we must realize by God's grace that
[6:17] everything in his word is true and so we
[6:22] thank God for His grace let us turn to
[6:28] first Timothy please
[6:30] 1st Timothy 3:16 all of God's Word is
[6:37] yay or nay and you and I must realize by
[6:41] God's grace that we are those who have
[6:45] been enlightened by the Word of God we
[6:50] are here to magnify the message in which
[6:56] God brought through Malachi 4 we must
[7:03] always know that there was always a
[7:07] prophet inner prophet the Prophet
[7:10] himself is Jesus Christ as the Son of
[7:15] Man is the Lord Jesus Christ yet the
[7:19] Prophet is a son of man revealing the
[7:23] son of man so we thank God for His
[7:27] amazing grace is this okay
[7:32] I don't know how the volume is coming I
[7:33] mean I like it but if it's too loud for
[7:36] you
[7:38] first Timothy please first Timothy 3:16
[7:47] so we know that the revelation of the
[7:51] Godhead is not something that can be
[7:53] studied into I intended to actually
[7:57] bring forth some pen and paper pens and
[8:01] paper tonight because I kind of want to
[8:04] do a little little teaching kind of
[8:06] slowly take us through it so but we
[8:09] Steve will and those of you who can
[8:11] commit everything to your memory you do
[8:13] well so first Timothy 3:16 all scripture
[8:27] first Timothy 3:16 and without
[8:32] controversy great is the mystery of
[8:36] godliness so first of all it is a
[8:38] mystery God was manifested in the flesh
[8:45] justified in the spirit seen of angels
[8:51] preached unto the Gentiles believed on
[8:54] in the world received up into glory God
[9:01] and we know who that God is that God is
[9:07] the Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated
[9:13] Heavenly Father we so thank you for the
[9:15] reading of your word we pray father that
[9:18] you would bless the service in a special
[9:20] way forgive us for having the people see
[9:23] sit before praying but father we're just
[9:26] human flesh sometimes we do make
[9:29] mistakes
[9:29] but all we just pray right now in your
[9:32] honor and in your name that you would
[9:35] have free preeminence here tonight in
[9:37] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen because
[9:42] we realize amen in 1st Corinthians if
[9:44] you want to turn there
[9:45] five three six says for their though
[9:48] there be that are called gods and there
[9:52] are many people who are called God's
[9:53] whether in heaven or in earth as there
[9:59] be God's many and Lords many but to us
[10:03] there is but one God the Father of whom
[10:06] are all things we in him and one Lord
[10:12] Jesus Christ but whom are all things and
[10:16] we by him and brother Adam has taught us
[10:20] that when it comes to God
[10:23] hello him we know that God is a spirit
[10:29] we know that they that worship God must
[10:32] worship Him in spirit and truth God
[10:35] leaves no room for error that's why I
[10:40] say it's yay or nay God is a revelation
[10:44] you can't even know God except he
[10:47] revealed it to you
[10:49] when it comes to sacrifices you don't
[10:52] even know what to offer God except it be
[10:56] revealed to you if we go back to Genesis
[11:00] we find out that the only thing that God
[11:02] will accept would be worship around the
[11:06] lamb because remember at the end of the
[11:10] day in in Revelation it is the Lamb who
[11:12] was worshipped lamb worship or in use of
[11:17] in worship as far as sacrifice lamb
[11:20] worship is used in worship as far as
[11:23] sacrifice according to the book of
[11:25] Revelation and we know who the lamb
[11:28] represents that's Jesus Christ we
[11:32] realize by God's grace amen that we are
[11:34] God's are we gods the Bible tells us
[11:38] that we are sons of God yet we are not
[11:43] Elohim but we are part of Allah here we
[11:47] are his attributes we are his the
[11:49] manifestation of who Elohim would be
[11:53] today
[11:53] you understand me let me say it again
[11:56] we are the metaphor
[11:59] station of elohim of what elohim would
[12:03] be in this day in this age that's who we
[12:06] are we didn't come by joining a church
[12:11] we did not come by you know joining a
[12:16] lodge or anything like that
[12:17] the only way that you and I can be part
[12:20] of him we must be born again you cannot
[12:24] even be born again except you were with
[12:27] him before the foundation of the world
[12:31] so you and I must understand that God is
[12:34] all and in all the Bible tells us
[12:38] according to Ephesians 4 4 through 6 it
[12:43] says there is one body and one spirit
[12:46] even as you are called into one hope one
[12:54] hope of your calling see truth is always
[12:58] one you never have two answers that's
[13:03] right only one answer could be right one
[13:06] plus one is true that will never change
[13:12] because that is the only answer that
[13:15] could be correct so is with God there
[13:18] aren't there are not two answers to one
[13:20] question there always one answer that's
[13:24] why Jesus say let your conversation be
[13:26] yay or nay truth is always one and truth
[13:33] will always prevail over err like light
[13:37] over darkness there is one body doesn't
[13:44] matter how many denominations there are
[13:46] and how many claim to be a part of
[13:51] Christ there is only one way to be a
[13:55] part of the body the Bible says by one
[13:59] baptism and that's not water baptism
[14:03] that's baptism of the Holy Ghost by one
[14:06] spirit are we all baptized into one body
[14:11] one spirit
[14:12] which is the holy spirit which is God
[14:16] there are not two holy spirits there's
[14:18] only one holy spirit they are not three
[14:22] divine persons there's only one person
[14:24] and that one person is God alone but we
[14:29] realize Amen that the that the Godhead
[14:32] is a mystery to many because even to
[14:36] this day people still think he's three
[14:37] persons when God is only one they don't
[14:42] get it they don't understand who he is
[14:46] because they don't know him only the
[14:49] true children of God will ever come to
[14:52] know who God is Jesus the Bible said
[14:57] that Jesus knew him because he was with
[14:59] him from the beginning he was he was in
[15:02] him
[15:03] the Bible's according to Saint John 17
[15:06] tells us that Jesus Christ was glorified
[15:09] amen in the father before he ever came
[15:13] to earth so you understand by God's
[15:17] grace if Jesus Christ was glorified in
[15:19] the father before he came to earth so
[15:20] were you
[15:22] but the Menem tells us that not only
[15:24] were we chosen elected but we were
[15:26] glorified in Christ in the seventeenth
[15:30] chapter of Saint John Jesus says father
[15:33] I would that they have the same glory
[15:37] that we had together in the beginning
[15:41] see there's only one Lord there's only
[15:44] one faith and that faith is in that Lord
[15:47] and that one baptism is in his name but
[15:52] you got to understand by God's grace
[15:54] when we talk about the name of the Lord
[15:59] Jesus Christ we must understand that we
[16:02] are including God the Trinity not three
[16:07] people but we're talking about three
[16:10] offices the Bible tells us according to
[16:14] Matthew 28:19 now I'm moving faster than
[16:16] I want it to move because we don't have
[16:19] the visitors here so I can just be
[16:21] Matthew 28:19 says go ye therefore right
[16:26] baptizing them in the name of the Father
[16:29] and of the Son and Holy Ghost and that
[16:31] is the only way that we know how to
[16:33] baptize every person I've ever baptized
[16:36] has been baptized in that name in that
[16:40] name in that name not in the titles we
[16:45] don't use titles but you know I found a
[16:47] quote this morning
[16:48] amen in question and answer so I think
[16:50] that what it was I can find it again
[16:52] where brother Branham used to baptize in
[16:54] the name of the Father Son and Holy
[16:55] Ghost and he also talked about Trinity
[17:01] being three persons even though he was a
[17:05] prophet he had to grow in his knowledge
[17:09] so you and I must understand that
[17:12] brother Branham in himself was not
[17:14] infallible it was on the only the word
[17:17] and God corrected the Prophet just like
[17:21] he corrects us so we realized Amen that
[17:25] when it comes to one God the Bible says
[17:27] there's one God and Father of all who is
[17:30] above all and through all and in all
[17:35] i'ma say it again one God and Father now
[17:39] because he said one God and Father does
[17:42] it make him - absolutely not
[17:45] he's showing that God has become a
[17:47] father so God being perfect he has to
[17:50] recognize his transitions or his changes
[17:53] so that people can understand I am God
[17:56] and I'm your father
[17:57] cuz God is God of everybody but God is
[18:01] not everybody's father God has not
[18:04] forgotten everyone right so he's not
[18:08] everybody's father so he has to say God
[18:10] and Father to those who he is God and
[18:14] Father remember by God's grace that even
[18:17] in the book of Isaiah the Word of God
[18:20] tells us that the God who is our Creator
[18:23] it's also our husband see so now God is
[18:27] not only our Father he is also our
[18:30] husband and how does that happen is how
[18:34] is the way God unfolds himself like
[18:37] brother Adam said God comes down and he
[18:39] begins to 1:4
[18:40] old himself because really with our
[18:43] brains and our understanding and our
[18:45] intelligence we would never be able to
[18:47] conceive or even understand God had not
[18:51] he become one of us so that was the very
[18:55] intent of Adam being made that the
[18:59] invisible God would be seen by creation
[19:03] this is why we are made that the
[19:06] invisible God may be seen in this age
[19:10] right so let's go on James 2:19 now
[19:16] believe it that there is one God that do
[19:19] it well the devil also believe and
[19:22] tremble so we don't have nothing over
[19:25] the devil by believing in one God right
[19:28] see even the devil so it's more foolish
[19:31] to believe in three than it is to
[19:33] believe in one I'm so glad is one mother
[19:38] Mike I wouldn't know how to serve three
[19:39] I'm having a time serving one hallelujah
[19:44] but to understand a man that God
[19:47] condescending as brother and says here
[19:49] he was fatherhood right God fatherhood
[19:53] he comes down he descends his son
[19:56] because son really was just a creation
[19:59] of the house of God the Bible says that
[20:02] by one blood
[20:03] God created one blood it was God he said
[20:09] we're a body who go to build a temple
[20:11] for me but a body I have prepared see so
[20:17] actually when when when when when God
[20:20] stood there in Jesus Jesus and God was
[20:24] the same because the Bible said the
[20:27] fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in
[20:30] him the fullness of God but was was
[20:33] heaven bank-robber lutely not because
[20:36] God is a spirit and there is no way that
[20:39] you could ever borrow God up don't you
[20:42] know that even amen in heaven when we
[20:45] when is all over brother Ellen said
[20:47] God's Jesus Christ was set on the throne
[20:50] and the pillar of fire be above his head
[20:54] but you're not looking at two you look
[20:56] at that one
[20:57] it's the same concept that you and I
[21:00] have when it comes to the bride there's
[21:03] one bride but the Bible tells us that
[21:06] there are a number of them that there's
[21:08] no way that we can number them yet God
[21:11] is still so infinite he can be above
[21:15] Christ he can be in Christ he can be in
[21:18] a multi-million being tree and whatever
[21:21] people and still there's more of him see
[21:26] because he feels all time and space
[21:33] there's nothing outside of God I was
[21:37] talking to some people today kind of the
[21:39] ones who I thought would be here tonight
[21:40] anyway I told them that when the Holy
[21:43] Spirit corrected me because I was
[21:44] thinking I said well when when Adam God
[21:48] said Adam Adam we're out there I thought
[21:50] I said well you know I God because Adam
[21:57] was in a place that God had never been
[21:59] but that can't be correct because God
[22:03] has been everywhere but Adam was in a
[22:07] place that he Adam had never been that's
[22:10] the correct way of saying it
[22:11] Adam had never experienced darkness or
[22:14] being separated from God neither had
[22:17] Adam ever experienced being naked so God
[22:20] was asking Adam the question and Adam
[22:24] asked answered the question correctly
[22:26] you know you think I would say I was in
[22:29] the bush hiding he didn't he said I'm
[22:34] hiding because I'm what naked so that
[22:38] was a place that out of had never been
[22:40] he had never been in a place where he
[22:42] was naked and then God said it to Adam
[22:45] who told you you was naked who see there
[22:48] is a serpent there and if we could catch
[22:51] a hold of that that serpent who was the
[22:54] Beast in Genesis is also the beast in
[22:58] Revelation see hidden in Genesis but
[23:04] revealed
[23:06] revelation everything is revealed in
[23:09] Revelation the serpent that was in the
[23:12] garden is now called a man in Revelation
[23:16] so if he was a man in Revelation he's a
[23:20] man in Genesis see so we understand
[23:26] there's only one God there's only one
[23:29] devil real devil Satan himself
[23:33] we call him Lucifer everything under him
[23:37] our demons right so there's only one God
[23:41] one devil one beast like I said in
[23:49] Genesis 3:1 3:11 I'm gonna read it now
[23:52] the serpent was more subtle than any
[23:53] beast of the field which the Lord God
[23:55] had made reason why I'm doing this
[23:57] because I want to show you the value of
[24:00] what you know maybe you never thought
[24:03] about the value oh we think oh well
[24:07] we're baptized in the name of the Lord
[24:09] Jesus Christ don't you understand that
[24:11] when you say that you're saying amen to
[24:13] the Father Son and the Holy Spirit
[24:15] that's why it's so important to say Lord
[24:18] Jesus Christ right because now you are
[24:23] making manifest you are manifesting what
[24:26] Matthew 819 right because see you can't
[24:29] leave that out you can't say that's not
[24:31] important because without that you
[24:35] wouldn't have this and I won't prove
[24:39] that in just a moment because even when
[24:41] Jesus gave Amen that formula to the
[24:44] disciples they didn't have no idea of
[24:47] what he was talking about Matthew 28:19
[24:52] y'all know that because you understand
[24:55] Jesus had to open their understanding to
[24:57] the scripture they didn't understand
[24:59] they only believed in one God but now
[25:01] you gonna tell me to go baptize in the
[25:03] name of the Father Son and of the Holy
[25:04] Ghost they didn't know even though Peter
[25:08] said thou art the Christ he still did
[25:12] not understand Matthew 28:19 none of
[25:16] them did it was at
[25:18] resurrection Jesus gave them the
[25:21] revelation of who you speaking on okay
[25:27] that's why it's so powerful that's why
[25:31] when you know whenever I baptized I
[25:34] baptized using Matthew 28:19 and acts
[25:39] 2:38 because I read Matthew 28:19 and
[25:44] that most of the time and then I said
[25:46] fulfilling that I now baptize you
[25:50] according to acts 2:38 because it's
[25:53] important that people understand those
[25:55] scriptures come together they don't
[25:59] contradict the one or the other women
[26:04] senators the serpent then in that cup
[26:08] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[26:09] beast of the field which the Lord God
[26:11] had made and he said unto the woman yea
[26:14] hath God said ye shall not eat of every
[26:17] tree of the garden and the woman said
[26:20] unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit
[26:22] of the trees of the garden but of the
[26:25] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[26:27] of the garden God hath said ye shall not
[26:31] eat of it neither shall you touch it
[26:35] lest ye die and the serpent said unto
[26:38] the woman ye shall not surely die so he
[26:43] changes God's Word by adding the word
[26:48] not we've heard that many times but just
[26:50] just see the concept like I said even
[26:53] the prophet of God says say it like I
[26:55] say it say like the tape says it but
[26:57] he's working with Revelation because if
[27:01] you say it just like he said it doesn't
[27:03] mean you understand what he said because
[27:08] remember there's a false witness amen in
[27:10] the Jesus trial did y'all know that they
[27:13] said he said he could tear this temple
[27:16] down and raise it up in three days did
[27:18] not he said he said it but they did not
[27:22] have the revelation of what he was
[27:24] saying so they became false witness but
[27:27] the round Center you cannot even be a
[27:29] witness of something unless you've been
[27:31] there
[27:33] this you up in the cavalry how can you
[27:37] be a witness if you've never been there
[27:39] right when you receive the Holy Ghost
[27:42] proves that you've been the Calvary
[27:45] that's what makes you a witness after
[27:48] which the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[27:50] he said you would then become witnesses
[27:54] of me to know that I died and rose again
[27:57] and I'm living now in you one God thank
[28:05] God not three brother thank God not
[28:08] three can you imagine
[28:10] three gods living you discussing what
[28:13] they're gonna do for you and see and
[28:19] that's where we we many people have
[28:23] gotten caught up and it tangled up you
[28:27] know in the message and I was just
[28:29] discussing this with the brothers in
[28:30] Iowa City brother Branham says that a
[28:33] prophet preaches by inspiration and I am
[28:39] an amateur profit but the Troy is an
[28:43] amateur profit every true preacher
[28:45] that's called by God we are amateur
[28:49] prophets not that we are a major profit
[28:52] but we are profit because we prophesy
[28:56] when we preach that's what brother
[29:00] Branham said and we must realize by
[29:03] God's grace amen that you and I must
[29:06] understand that inspiration how many
[29:09] times the prophet of God spoke and when
[29:12] he didn't even know what the serpent
[29:14] seed was the Holy Spirit dropped down on
[29:16] him he said it was a serpent he himself
[29:19] didn't nobody had said he had to go and
[29:22] look it up and then he found the
[29:25] scripture that vindicated the
[29:28] inspiration Paul said even if a angel
[29:33] from heaven come to you and tell you
[29:35] something don't believe it unless you
[29:38] check it with the ureter it's in the
[29:42] book and whatever he's
[29:45] so you must be given to you in
[29:47] understanding of Revelation is that
[29:51] right
[29:52] I believe his Hebrew six tip the proper
[29:54] God said he didn't understand that
[29:55] Scripture
[29:58] no it was one it was the one that if you
[30:00] say to this mountain be thou move
[30:03] whatever you say he said even though
[30:05] he's seen it he never preached it until
[30:08] God revealed it to it he boosts our six
[30:12] I believe Allah says the rain falls on
[30:15] the just and the unjust and and you know
[30:18] how I bring forth and one is nigh unto
[30:20] burning and all of that kind of stuff
[30:21] hey man it was winging he was at the
[30:25] Pentecostal meeting and he saw two
[30:28] people prophesy one was a devil and one
[30:34] was born again he went into his cave is
[30:37] that God I don't understand this how can
[30:39] this be he said all of a sudden the wind
[30:41] blew two pages it was always in the word
[30:46] and that's what happens I believe
[30:48] sometimes I'm inspired to say things I
[30:51] didn't even know brother Branham said
[30:53] then down the road I see oh my god the
[30:57] prophecy so you and I must understand we
[31:00] all of us who are born again truly born
[31:03] again we've got the same Holy Ghost
[31:07] there brother man had that Jesus had
[31:11] that Paul had that's why Paul could come
[31:14] out of the desert with a greater
[31:17] revelation Peter said even some of the
[31:20] things that Paul said was hard to
[31:22] understand so you understand him and we
[31:25] are at liberty now we can't be like some
[31:27] of these people so well well I don't
[31:29] need no preacher to teach me because
[31:31] about said the Holy Spirit is your ocean
[31:33] you don't need no man to teach you but
[31:35] see out of context you can you can
[31:39] literally do not part of the word which
[31:41] is the fivefold ministry we need
[31:44] teachers for God does not know and in
[31:50] that day you eat thereof then your eyes
[31:53] shall be opened and ye shall be God's
[31:55] knowing good and evil
[31:57] and when the woman saw
[31:58] that the tree was good for food and that
[32:00] it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree
[32:04] to be desired to make one wise she took
[32:06] of the fruit thereof and did eat and
[32:09] gave also unto her husband with her and
[32:12] he did eat and the eyes of them both
[32:16] were open
[32:17] now in an amazing their eyes were open
[32:21] to era it was open but the I was already
[32:27] open but now the eyes that there are
[32:30] that are open is open to era open to sin
[32:35] open to seed things that God did not
[32:38] want them to see you see them saying so
[32:42] now they experiencing some kind of
[32:45] enlightenment and anyway so what's so
[32:48] wicked about it is their enlightenment
[32:50] is because they failed it comes out of
[32:54] failure so how great can this become how
[32:58] great can it become this great
[33:00] revelation I have failed and now I see
[33:02] what is good and evil oh it was just a
[33:05] beginning I cannot imagine what he felt
[33:11] when she had her first baby I know she
[33:14] thought about the moment she broke the
[33:17] word it's no doubt in her mind the devil
[33:22] probably said she is not only Yui but
[33:24] every woman that comes after you will
[33:26] experience this they didn't have no
[33:29] interspecies they didn't have no what
[33:32] they call a ways to block the pain later
[33:35] she got the whole blunt of it think
[33:40] about it an atom not even knowing I
[33:43] think some time I'm like Lord how did
[33:45] you teach him that how did they know to
[33:48] cut the umbilical cord how did they know
[33:51] to do this that they've never done
[33:52] before you know God was there he said
[33:55] I'll never leave you nor forsake you and
[33:56] just assures the revelation of Eve okay
[33:59] the revelation of how deliver baby came
[34:01] with it see there's all in one God one
[34:07] way this Bible is the truth he
[34:11] not be mixed with psychology it can't
[34:15] I'm saying this for a reason they cannot
[34:17] be mixed with psychology
[34:19] it cannot be mixed with them what's that
[34:22] other word anyway people you know they
[34:26] have this intellectual ability they they
[34:27] think they they could you know take
[34:34] things and make mix it in other words
[34:37] I'm saying you can't mix it it has to
[34:40] remain in the concept of how in the way
[34:44] it was said that's why I thank God for
[34:47] the voice on the tapes because I can
[34:51] hear the way God says it because you
[34:56] could take a quote and you can make it
[34:57] say whatever you want to say but when
[35:00] you hear the way God says it then you
[35:04] understand that quote was reused in the
[35:06] wrong way y'all y'all hear me I'm not
[35:11] talking about nobody here I'm just
[35:12] saying that's how I've learned that's
[35:15] why I try to tell people if you don't
[35:17] watch the way it's here the spirit
[35:21] that's what the Bible says he that have
[35:23] an ear to hear what the Spirit says to
[35:26] the church the spirit one spirit what
[35:32] God's saying to the church right because
[35:37] the Devils intent is to take us off of
[35:42] what we know is true and he doesn't
[35:45] waver like this it's just a little way
[35:51] hmm
[35:52] that's why some people think brother
[35:54] Branham is God that's why some people
[35:56] worship in his name you see them saying
[35:59] because it is a fine line right there
[36:04] are times you know listen if we walk in
[36:06] the flesh like that man walked in the
[36:08] fresh people would try to worship us
[36:10] Paul said they did the same to him they
[36:13] looked upon him as he was Jesus Christ
[36:16] himself right John and they're in the
[36:19] book of Revelation fell down it that a
[36:21] verse feet and then you said don't
[36:24] worship Me
[36:25] you of your brethren I'm a prophet I'm
[36:27] your brother I'm like you are you get up
[36:30] and worship God see so it is an a
[36:34] tendency for the bride to worship
[36:37] William Branham but the correct worship
[36:41] goes to God you see so we shouldn't look
[36:46] at him like something really wrong
[36:47] that's what John did he first worshiped
[36:50] the angel that has to be fulfilled right
[36:57] and the eyes of them were open and they
[37:01] knew that they were naked and that they
[37:03] sewed fig leaves together and made
[37:05] themselves aprons and they heard Amen
[37:08] heard the voice of the Lord God walking
[37:10] in the garden in the cool of the ether I
[37:12] love that word walking in the garden
[37:14] showing that he was a person it wasn't
[37:17] just a wink brother branham identifies
[37:21] that person he said that was the Tree of
[37:23] Life
[37:23] that was Jesus Christ himself before he
[37:28] was born
[37:28] yeah God can do what he wants to do and
[37:32] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[37:35] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[37:36] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[37:39] from the presence of the Lord God
[37:42] amongst the trees of the garden and the
[37:45] Lord God called him to Adam and said
[37:47] unto Him where art thou and he said I
[37:50] heard thy voice in the garden and I was
[37:53] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[37:56] myself in that amazing the voice of God
[37:59] when you wrong will always make you
[38:01] afraid always it'll do something to your
[38:05] heart like today when I said I was
[38:08] telling those brothers about God being
[38:10] in our place that thing just did not
[38:11] feel right I'm like I know I'm saying it
[38:14] wrong but what am I supposed I say it I
[38:16] know what I'm trying to say thank God
[38:18] down the road after things settled and I
[38:20] was by myself he said this is how you
[38:22] say it so I said well Lord I gotta
[38:25] correct it with those brothers and he
[38:29] said who who told thee that I was naked
[38:31] he's just hast thou eaten of the tree
[38:33] whereof I commanded thee that thou she
[38:35] does not eat see who was liken to him
[38:39] think about it who is liken unto God
[38:42] Satan incarnated even as Judas was the
[38:45] son of perdition right so you got to
[38:48] understand you got two trees in the
[38:50] beginning you still have two trees you
[38:53] have a tree of life you have the tree of
[38:56] lot of knowledge and good and evil and
[38:58] the only way that you will make it to
[39:00] heaven
[39:00] you must eat of the tree of life if you
[39:04] continue to eat off the tree of the
[39:06] knowledge of good and evil that is death
[39:09] it was death in the beginning is death
[39:12] in the ending and the tree of knowledge
[39:14] and good and evil is do what what does
[39:16] it do it changes the meaning of the word
[39:21] by adding or subtracting that's why the
[39:24] Bible says if you add the plagues will
[39:27] be added to you if you should attract
[39:30] your name will be taken out of the book
[39:33] because adding and taking away is
[39:36] absolutely the manifestation of the tree
[39:40] of the knowledge of good and evil we are
[39:44] at war and a lot of us don't even
[39:49] understand acts 2:38 it will be the
[39:51] thing that will get you in trouble the
[39:54] very thing that you think means nothing
[39:57] I won't say you don't think means
[39:58] nothing we just don't put enough
[40:00] emphasis on it go to most message
[40:03] churches you don't even hear him preach
[40:04] it alright well first of all we hardly
[40:07] ever have visitors right think suddenly
[40:15] I don't think a lot of people realize
[40:17] and understand the God here great is the
[40:22] mystery of godliness see I've had people
[40:27] say well well how can it be one first of
[40:29] all you don't even know the kind you
[40:31] know what most of us think like like
[40:33] Jesus only that's why we don't get it we
[40:36] thank God is like one is your finger
[40:37] right and as long as you think God is
[40:40] one like your finger you'll never
[40:42] understand God he's in you all he's
[40:48] above all
[40:50] that's God so he can never be this and
[40:58] it's a revelation there's a true
[41:01] revelation of God to know that God a man
[41:05] has brought you to a place where you go
[41:08] and he's unveiling himself in such a way
[41:10] see only the Prophet could have unveiled
[41:12] it because that's a corner Amos Amos 3
[41:15] right I can't do nothing except I reveal
[41:18] my secrets to my servant the Prophet so
[41:21] you and I must understand by God's grace
[41:23] there was no way we could have even
[41:25] conceived he's right now even though
[41:28] even God magnified the prophet of
[41:31] magnified his revelation or
[41:33] understanding of the the Godhead
[41:35] we remember brother MC Mussina the three
[41:38] rainbows and God got in those rainbows I
[41:45] explained and showed him that his own
[41:48] Trinity y'all don't remember that it's
[41:53] in there see so you when I say Trinity
[41:57] see you're always thinking in your mind
[41:59] three persons no sir
[42:01] brother branham cut that down he said he
[42:04] went to the Father Son and Holy Ghost he
[42:07] said three the best way I can explain it
[42:10] God manifested himself in three divine
[42:14] offices but it still was one God so you
[42:24] and I must understand in order to
[42:26] understand that's why a lot of people at
[42:29] the end of the day and I'm arenas few
[42:31] scriptures in the moment at the end of
[42:32] the day y'all gotta understand that the
[42:34] devil has the Trinity - and what the
[42:37] devil does is that because I was
[42:39] baptized I was baptized at the age of
[42:41] twelve I was the Reverend fair WM fair
[42:47] FAI are that was his name he said I now
[42:52] baptize you in the name of the Father
[42:54] and of the Son and the Holy Ghost and he
[42:56] took me down and he brought me up and
[42:58] the Holy Spirit at that time I didn't
[43:00] know it was the Holy Spirit said to me
[43:02] what is the name
[43:05] the name has to be said right you cannot
[43:10] fulfill that Scripture by just using
[43:13] titles you have to use the name it's
[43:18] like I said go shut the door and you say
[43:20] go shut the door you didn't do what I
[43:21] said dude you just repeated what I said
[43:24] but if you go over there and you shut
[43:27] the door then you did what I said okay
[43:32] you can't leave out Matthew 28:19 and
[43:36] you definitely can't leave out acts 2:38
[43:38] that's why I use them both is that okay
[43:44] because I want people to realize and to
[43:47] understand I'm not talking about three
[43:49] guys I'm talking about one the Lord acts
[43:53] 2:38 is the answer to the equation of
[43:56] Matthew 28:19 that's the best way to say
[44:00] you got equal Lord Jesus Christ name of
[44:07] the Father and of the Son and the Holy
[44:08] Ghost Father plus son plus Holy Ghost
[44:12] equals the Lord Jesus Christ that's the
[44:16] way that's the way that that's the way
[44:17] the equation work okay and there was
[44:22] given unto him a mouth speaking let it
[44:23] go and they worship the Dragon which
[44:25] gave power unto the Beast and they
[44:28] worshipped the Beast saying who is
[44:30] likened unto the Beast and who is able
[44:31] to make war with him let me tell you
[44:33] something we must we must understand
[44:36] that Trinitarian doctrine is so strong
[44:39] my knees are my nephew's wife she had
[44:44] read the Bible all the life she told me
[44:47] as a child she sitting there in a bed
[44:49] room reading the Bible back wasn't
[44:51] forces I can tie you up in Scripture and
[44:53] still she thought they were three and
[44:55] when we were going through this issue
[44:58] she said they they know who I am and
[45:01] when she said there's oh my god I said
[45:04] you don't even know God if you saying
[45:06] they you don't know him and even in the
[45:13] you got people who believe in his too
[45:15] that's just as wrong when God was able
[45:20] to oh the Lord said unto my lord sit
[45:22] thou my god have mercy sit down there
[45:28] right here what you need is the Holy
[45:30] Ghost the Holy Ghost will reveal that
[45:35] Scripture he ain't talking about no -
[45:36] but God I put it like that just a stub
[45:39] of the intellectual hmmm why they don't
[45:46] have a problem with knowing that there's
[45:48] one devil everybody know there's one
[45:51] devil but why do you want to make God
[45:53] three not that is the devil he 1 because
[46:00] the devil know if you think brother oshi
[46:02] brother been saying like this almost
[46:03] dare you to come in in the presence of
[46:06] God believing in three gods he dare you
[46:10] if you put up dare you come i remember
[46:13] those three dare you come in the
[46:17] presence of God believing that there's
[46:19] three gods or in the Trinity how he said
[46:21] it but he used the word dare you come
[46:29] see there was a time God winked at ain't
[46:32] ignorant when brother man was on the
[46:33] time on the scene they were Trinitarians
[46:36] who had the Holy Ghost
[46:37] there was one this is who had the Holy
[46:39] Ghost different ones had the Holy Ghost
[46:41] so he tried to explain to them is not
[46:43] the doctrine that you know not not safe
[46:45] but he says now is the Holy Ghost you're
[46:47] baptized into that one body but look it
[46:50] proved that they didn't have it in their
[46:52] soul because when the showdown came they
[46:55] all walked away there's a time where the
[46:59] Holy Ghost laid in their spirit it was
[47:01] good enough but when the truth come when
[47:05] perfection came which was the opening of
[47:07] the word when it that which is perfectly
[47:09] column all these other things is put
[47:12] away God don't wink at our ignorance
[47:14] anymore the only
[47:19] that keeps a man I'll make a foolish
[47:21] version his election is that right the
[47:26] only thing the only thing that that that
[47:28] keeps the foolish version foolish
[47:30] version is election they were part of
[47:33] the pattern they were part of the
[47:34] material and God chose not to bring him
[47:37] into the making of the garment if they
[47:41] weren't part of the material they're
[47:43] lost completely period that's all that's
[47:48] the way I see it an understanding he
[47:53] opened his mouth in blasphemy against
[47:55] God to blaspheme his name and his
[47:57] tabernacle and then that King that
[47:59] brother a brother was telling me the
[48:01] other day a sister in a message who've
[48:03] been in long years ago said to him Jesus
[48:07] is not God a message believer when the
[48:13] prophet of God argued that so many a
[48:15] time with different people some people
[48:17] think he was denying some people think
[48:19] he was just a prophet some people think
[48:21] he was just son of God and that's all he
[48:23] were he was God here's God and when you
[48:29] get to heaven
[48:30] the only thing about Ellingham you're
[48:32] gonna see is the pillar of fire and
[48:34] Jesus Christ but this devil has started
[48:43] a war he started a war in the in Genesis
[48:46] and you know what he started in heaven
[48:48] first and what you and I are now
[48:50] experiencing for the man said those
[48:53] angels that fell are demons and the
[48:55] angels that stood a man are you you
[49:01] stood with him and because we stood with
[49:05] him in the giving he stands with us now
[49:07] why because sin struck us with amnesia
[49:11] and now the message has come to take it
[49:13] away to make us remember who we are
[49:16] where we came from and why we must be
[49:20] born again
[49:20] a true believer amen will never reject
[49:24] the formula that God has set here for us
[49:29] even though it is just the outward works
[49:33] hello baptisms us now save us the Bible
[49:37] says not the putting away of the filth
[49:38] of the flesh but an answer of a good
[49:41] conscience toward God that's Peter
[49:43] so being baptized in water does not wash
[49:47] away your sins only the blood right when
[49:53] Jesus blood dropped on the ground
[49:55] brother Owen said it's safe to fight the
[49:57] whole earth hey man so it is a blood
[50:05] that sanctifies you and only those who
[50:09] have been ordained to be sanctified will
[50:12] be sanctified is that right only those
[50:16] who are ordained to receive the Holy
[50:18] Ghost will recede oligos God has this
[50:22] thing because see y'all think what God
[50:24] made it dude no no no no you're choosing
[50:27] from the beginning it's what we are now
[50:30] experiencing hallelujah and it was given
[50:34] to him to make war with whom the Saints
[50:37] and to overcome them and power was given
[50:40] over all Kindred's tongues and nations
[50:42] well I would God do that and all that
[50:47] dwell upon the earth shall worship Him
[50:49] whose names are not written in the book
[50:52] of life of the lamb slain from the
[50:54] foundation of the world
[50:56] now that is yay-yay-yay all whose names
[51:06] are not written in the Lamb's Book of
[51:08] Life before the fact I don't care how
[51:11] religious you could be like Buddha and
[51:13] everybody else you're spilling car
[51:15] Nowhere if your name is not written in
[51:17] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[51:19] foundation of the world and that in
[51:22] itself must be a revelation because we
[51:26] are faulty creatures as up as we are but
[51:29] you have a have a revelation and you I
[51:31] don't know why I'm bright but I know
[51:33] that I am because that's the only way
[51:36] you're gonna know when God reveals to
[51:39] you it to you as a individual and when
[51:42] that revelation come that is the Holy
[51:44] Ghost
[51:47] huh not here oh god I'm gonna be lost
[51:51] here it ought to be something in you
[51:54] that no matter what Satan comes with it
[51:57] cannot touch that ground because that
[52:00] ground in your soul is holy ground this
[52:04] is not a sinful soul it is a holy soul
[52:08] trapped in a sinful body and that's what
[52:16] the devil is the devil knows amen he how
[52:18] to lead us into captivity like I was
[52:21] telling somebody every bad habit I heard
[52:23] brother Adam said like this he said
[52:25] every bad habit is a demon I'm
[52:27] paraphrasing and the other time
[52:30] Christian don't want to believe they got
[52:32] demons but they said well I gotta have
[52:33] it that's demonic it's the devil
[52:37] controlling your life you can't get
[52:40] through it
[52:40] that is a devil holding you so in order
[52:44] to be free you got to get free free of
[52:46] the habit and the only way you can be
[52:49] free through the blood of Jesus that's
[52:52] why he came the Holy Ghost has come to
[52:54] sanctify you he said I sanctify you
[52:57] through what your truth Emme and God's
[53:01] Word is true and if you read the Word of
[53:04] God God to tell you there's certain
[53:05] things they won't make heaven and if
[53:07] you've got a hole if something bad got a
[53:09] hold on you you got to get rid of it Oh
[53:12] Lord see you know probably God said you
[53:15] know we want God to do all the work but
[53:17] you gotta do something he's not gonna
[53:20] pull you through a hole or whatever you
[53:22] might think you've got alert Joshua I
[53:25] have given you the land but you gonna
[53:28] have to fight for it's yours Joshua and
[53:32] everywhere you place your foot you
[53:34] possess it but I want you to understand
[53:36] there's a Giants on the land but I have
[53:40] given you the authority and the ability
[53:41] to kill them all see that's how it is
[53:44] you said oh I can't overcome you are
[53:46] overcome if you say your ride you are
[53:50] overcome because only the overcomers can
[53:54] will be included in the ride overcome a

[54:07] Ghost if I'm right and I know the proper
[54:12] God is and I believe he's right I know
[54:14] he's right he said in a future home that
[54:17] that Holy Ghost comes and he burns out
[54:19] all the Devils hmm that don't mean
[54:25] sometimes the devil don't come back and
[54:27] lodge in your spirit cuz you open the
[54:29] gate that right
[54:32] he said the devil can't come in to you
[54:33] you got to go out to him now when you
[54:36] let the devil into your spirit you've
[54:37] got to get him out of there
[54:38] how you gonna get him out of there fire
[54:41] water don't cleanse him out you can
[54:44] baptize you seven times a day and you
[54:47] still be demonic possessed the only
[54:49] thing is fire and how you gonna get fire
[54:52] on your knees the Bible said in the
[55:00] devil that deceived them was cast into
[55:03] the lake of fire and brimstone where the
[55:06] beast and the false prophet are and
[55:08] shall be tormented day and night forever
[55:10] and ever you mean to tell me all these
[55:12] preachers that baptizing name of the
[55:14] Father Son and Holy Ghost who believe in
[55:15] the Trinitarian doctrine and believe
[55:17] that see they don't understand that was
[55:18] adopted by the Catholic Church that's
[55:20] that ain't nothing but bail is bail ISM
[55:24] that's why God called one a who
[55:28] was Jezebel and her daughter amen what
[55:31] when was a whole other ones a prostitute
[55:34] what was it whoring huh harlot yeah say
[55:37] yeah you don't say Wow
[55:41] cuz Jezebel was a prostitute now what
[55:44] was Jezebel worship Bay lism she
[55:48] worshipped bail and if she were Chappell
[55:51] all these denominations because they
[55:54] split got up at the three worshiping and
[55:58] brother Balaam said it did he at the end
[56:01] almost at the end of his journey he said
[56:03] one day they're gonna come to find out
[56:04] that they're worshiping the devil
[56:06] thinking they're worshiping God
[56:11] why because you could only worship God
[56:13] in spirit and in truth see what I'm
[56:15] saying see how blessed you are and
[56:18] that's why they gonna come out the
[56:20] people like you who really believe in
[56:22] the baptism in the name of Lord Jesus
[56:24] Christ or the revelation of Matthew
[56:26] 28:19 how do you wanna see it you're
[56:29] gonna get in trouble because you will
[56:31] not bow to the image you can't bow to
[56:37] the image you know too much take my head
[56:43] off that's what I told those brothers
[56:45] this evening this afternoon I said cut
[56:47] my head off I know too much I've seen
[56:50] too much do you think I'm gonna be
[56:54] afraid of a man who can just kill me
[56:56] when I know that it ain't the end I'm
[57:00] gonna announce to God that girl I'm
[57:02] gonna meet once they cut my throat
[57:03] whatever they do I gotta meet him come
[57:05] on
[57:06] Oh a foolish man surely the pain won't
[57:12] be pleasant but it be temporal yeah
[57:16] every short short cut and understand
[57:30] every every habit that's bad is unclean
[57:34] the Bible says that I saw the three
[57:37] unclean spirits like frogs
[57:39] so what is it what you're saying
[57:42] everybody that believes in the Trinity
[57:44] and believe it in the way they do they
[57:47] are being led by unclean spirits
[57:50] that's why the Bible said Babylon has
[57:53] become a cage of all the others ain't
[57:59] nothing good happening in there this man
[58:02] taking that man's wife and this one
[58:03] taking that man's wife they swap and
[58:05] shop sad to see it but that's the way it
[58:08] is you think that people can dress like
[58:12] that and not be overtaken by lust let's
[58:17] get real you think the preaching back
[58:20] there having a party he's preaching
[58:24] it's the truth brother it's the truth
[58:28] there is no way you can let these women
[58:30] sit up on the role like they do with
[58:33] them short thing and not having thoughts
[58:34] in your mind and that's all what those
[58:39] people do now thank God for holiness
[58:45] thank God for holiness and now we can
[58:48] get the sisters to not the dress which
[58:50] soap the tight stuff we'd be alright
[58:53] brothers I know y'all gotta drop your
[58:56] eyes even in here uh you know you know
[59:01] I'm only I'm being recorded so I can't

[59:11] family somebody has a family it doesn't
[59:13] matter it's a shame that we are
[59:18] representing holiness and we have to
[59:20] drop our eyes because our sisters are
[59:22] not that's error they are believing a
[59:26] lie
[59:27] and God said if they don't come to
[59:30] believe the truth God will give them a
[59:32] strong delusion and even among us
[59:34] message to people we found people
[59:36] dressing all kind of way so it doesn't
[59:38] matter you know it fits hardly fits oh
[59:48] god help us it's unclean unclean spirits
[59:53] now I'm working with one God I'm working
[59:55] with truth I'm working with yay I'm
[59:57] working with name and there is no
[59:59] compromise there is no great areas this

[1:00:19] been brides and brides and bull bride
[1:00:21] bride bride and none of them was bride
[1:00:23] who said he were bride bride is not a
[1:00:26] figure of speech bride is a
[1:00:29] manifestation of a vindication if the
[1:00:32] prophet of God had to be vindicated he
[1:00:34] was a prophet you got to be vindicated
[1:00:36] your bride

[1:00:45] the only way it's the vindication you'll
[1:00:49] never be a vindicated a man without the
[1:00:51] Holy Ghost there was war in heaven
[1:00:56] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:00:58] see you don't have to worry about the
[1:01:00] devil's children we know what you know
[1:01:03] all these denominational people who and
[1:01:05] they can out quote you right oh yeah
[1:01:07] didn't know the scripture that's nothing
[1:01:11] did not the devil know the scripture
[1:01:13] even he twisted a little bit with the
[1:01:16] word right he comes up to Jesus and try
[1:01:19] to attempt Jesus with the word he twists
[1:01:21] it think about it when Jesus came who
[1:01:24] was in the pulpit Devils the great
[1:01:28] definitive doctors of divinity was
[1:01:31] standing right there in the door and
[1:01:33] Jesus said you hold the truth in
[1:01:36] unrighteousness meaning that you know I
[1:01:38] am the truth and you will not accept it
[1:01:42] and you're standing in the door so
[1:01:44] others will not accept it this America
[1:01:47] who has experienced the Ministry of
[1:01:50] Malachi for and have experienced amen
[1:01:54] the Ministry of Luke 1730 they know they
[1:01:57] knew he was a prophet they knew he was
[1:02:00] Malachi 4 even though they didn't want
[1:02:04] to accept it why they love the filter
[1:02:06] lucre jesus said you haven't changed he
[1:02:09] said you want to be reverence you want
[1:02:11] you want the praise of men and forget
[1:02:13] about the praise of God that's what it
[1:02:15] is hey Rev Oh Bishop how you doing see
[1:02:18] they love that kind of stuff they loved
[1:02:20] it then they love it now it's sad to say
[1:02:24] it's coming to this message that men in
[1:02:26] the message are beginning to like and
[1:02:28] enjoy the praise of men it's it creeps
[1:02:32] it's just don't happen all of a sudden
[1:02:34] it crease it got so bad
[1:02:39] all said Paul said I didn't baptize no
[1:02:40] yeah I didn't die for you why are you
[1:02:44] following me see ain't no great ones
[1:02:49] among this message the only great one is
[1:02:52] the Lord Jesus Christ I'm not great
[1:02:55] don't want to be thought of being as
[1:02:57] being great if you only know the battles
[1:02:59] I go throughout the day
[1:03:00] ooh ain't nothing great I'm just what's
[1:03:05] great about me is that God is giving me
[1:03:07] great grace that's all it is it's just
[1:03:15] okay cuz you got to understand what
[1:03:19] people don't understand in this message
[1:03:20] they do not understand brother Branham
[1:03:23] said amen and he's working and quoting
[1:03:25] Ezekiel whether death angel is coming in
[1:03:29] and he's mocking everybody you're right
[1:03:32] the man with the slaughtering weapon in
[1:03:34] his hand and he said don't spare young
[1:03:36] or old children grandpa you know don't
[1:03:40] don't spare nobody everybody that
[1:03:42] doesn't have the mark of God in their
[1:03:45] forehead kill them and that's what
[1:03:48] people even in this mess all you you can
[1:03:51] quote brother Branham you can quote the
[1:03:53] scriptures are called Nepal I mean you
[1:03:55] can rattle the scriptures off like any
[1:03:57] intellectual preacher can do but if you
[1:04:00] don't have the Holy Ghost rather than
[1:04:02] say you're gonna get the mark of the
[1:04:04] beast everybody that doesn't get the
[1:04:07] Holy Ghost get the mark of the beast and
[1:04:09] when you get the marketer beat you're
[1:04:10] lost and they don't see the importance
[1:04:15] Oh
[1:04:16] you saw all I shouted that's my brother
[1:04:18] and said don't let this devil deceive
[1:04:20] you
[1:04:21] this is his age this is the age of
[1:04:23] deception or spoken toast if you don't
[1:04:26] live it that's nothing oh I shouted if
[1:04:30] you don't live it that's nothing
[1:04:31] oh I ran down the house if you don't
[1:04:33] live it that's nothing oh i preach the
[1:04:36] gospel if you don't live it that's
[1:04:38] nothing well I said it's got to be the
[1:04:42] life and that's the only thing to devil
[1:04:44] can't duplicate divine love
[1:04:50] be copied cuz the Barlow is tested hey
[1:04:55] hey somebody that's Jo named a man
[1:04:58] whether we like it or not that's why the
[1:05:02] pulses make your calling and election
[1:05:05] sure see the Lord NORs them that I
[1:05:09] here's having this seal it's gotta be a
[1:05:13] seal God searches everything everything
[1:05:16] that has the seal is that right
[1:05:18] is that right just like the angel went
[1:05:20] down to Egypt everything that had the
[1:05:22] blood on the doorpost of the lintel that
[1:05:24] was the thing he bypassed nowadays it's
[1:05:29] the seal it's the sealing of the Holy
[1:05:31] Ghost oh I got it in my spirit I got in
[1:05:34] my flesh you better make sure it's in
[1:05:35] your soul I'm gonna read this this cold
[1:05:43] I had a futile mean but I'm just gonna
[1:05:44] read this one this is quite a long one
[1:05:46] anyway coming out of the churches but in
[1:05:49] the age after the church goes home he
[1:05:52] becomes a beast he becomes a devil
[1:05:55] incarnated the red dragon himself
[1:05:58] oh my can't you see what I mean he is
[1:06:01] incarnated in his people then what just
[1:06:06] like God is going to incarnated himself
[1:06:08] in us the devil is gonna incarnate
[1:06:11] himself in his people is that right
[1:06:15] did not the devil incarnated himself in
[1:06:17] in Hitler and then he did it to the
[1:06:21] Germans Oh y'all come home
[1:06:23] those people were spellbound they had
[1:06:27] been uh I could say a spell had been
[1:06:31] cast on those German don't tell me I
[1:06:34] know some that they didn't even know
[1:06:36] what was going on it's like you been
[1:06:40] spare about and all of a sudden when
[1:06:42] Hitler was dead and everything was over
[1:06:44] they shook himself oh my god what have I
[1:06:47] done
[1:06:47] is that right see that's how it is with
[1:06:50] any devil adultery fornication whatever
[1:06:53] any lascivious act after the devil is
[1:06:55] complete he didn't opens your eye and
[1:06:58] leaves you alone then accuse you
[1:07:04] that's what he does but that's how a
[1:07:08] devil overtakes you the same way Hitler
[1:07:11] got the della overtook them right so you
[1:07:13] guys what do you mean why do you think
[1:07:15] the Bible says it means these these
[1:07:17] chargers that will be loosed having hair
[1:07:22] like women to torment people where do
[1:07:25] you think who do you think these are
[1:07:28] demons that has fallen that used to be
[1:07:31] angels that used to say holy holy holy
[1:07:34] unto the Lord has now become an army
[1:07:37] against the Lord you know what they come
[1:07:43] to determine who they don't remain all
[1:07:46] Satan's children see that's how he treat
[1:07:49] here's God give us heaven Satan give his
[1:07:54] children hell right that's it that might
[1:07:58] sound like a little wrong but that's
[1:07:59] what it's right it's what it is God
[1:08:01] gives his children heaven Satan gives
[1:08:03] his children here can I continue read em
[1:08:06] oh listen the prof prophets had
[1:08:10] prophesied them right into it see what
[1:08:13] he said wait it's the preachers that
[1:08:14] leading the people into destruction
[1:08:16] that's what Jesus said if the blind
[1:08:19] leaders lead the blind they both shall
[1:08:21] fall in a ditch so it's the leaders
[1:08:23] innocent people following their
[1:08:25] preachers because the preacher said is
[1:08:27] that right brother mom tells us stories
[1:08:30] amen of how young ladies who believe in
[1:08:32] their preachers in their lives at the at
[1:08:34] the time of death their eyes were open
[1:08:36] see everybody eyes will be open at the
[1:08:40] end of the day everybody eyes is going
[1:08:42] to be open to the truth the false
[1:08:48] prophet
[1:08:49] prophesized them right into it give them
[1:08:51] over to strong delusions to believe
[1:08:54] Allah and to be damned by it denying the
[1:08:57] word with with a form of godliness God's
[1:09:01] works God works his place in a Trinity
[1:09:05] justification sanctification Incarnation
[1:09:08] himself incarnated himself in his people
[1:09:11] oh my god
[1:09:15] he said when Jesus incarnated himself in
[1:09:18] his people the very life that was in
[1:09:21] Christ is in the person what would it do
[1:09:25] if you took the life of out of a great
[1:09:28] vine and put it in a pumpkin vine it
[1:09:30] wouldn't be a pumpkin no more it would
[1:09:33] bear grapes what if you took the life
[1:09:35] out of a peach tree and put it in a pear
[1:09:37] tree would it bear pears no bear peaches
[1:09:41] the life tells what it is when you say
[1:09:45] here people are saying that they got the
[1:09:48] Holy Ghost and denies this word there is
[1:09:50] something wrong the Holy Ghost wrote
[1:09:53] that word hmm and Jesus said if a man
[1:09:56] has my spirit in him he'll do my works
[1:09:59] you want to read that you want to put it
[1:10:02] down it's st. John 14:12 yes he that
[1:10:05] believeth of me the work that I do shall
[1:10:07] he do also even more than this shall he
[1:10:12] do for I go to my father see he
[1:10:15] sanctifies and clears him so he can
[1:10:17] stand before God that drop of ink falls
[1:10:21] there and takes him across the chasm huh
[1:10:24] now watch Satan when he incarnated
[1:10:27] himself in his subjects they do the work
[1:10:29] that he did don't you see what did he do
[1:10:32] come right to that innocent woman to
[1:10:34] deceive her right that's what the
[1:10:38] preachers are doing coming to innocent
[1:10:40] people who desire to see God and
[1:10:42] deceiving them that's exactly what some
[1:10:45] of these Devils do come right into a
[1:10:47] place and say a little pastor get
[1:10:49] started how somewhere come in and say oh
[1:10:52] if you just join up with us uh-huh see
[1:10:55] the same devil work now the truth and
[1:10:58] when Satan becomes incarnate in his
[1:11:00] church to be a devil then they they are
[1:11:02] the ones that does the murdering and
[1:11:05] killing and so forth because Satan is
[1:11:08] the killer right in the first place what
[1:11:12] does Satan do when he does when he comes
[1:11:14] be incarnated amongst the people it is
[1:11:17] the duty to be shrewd he is true you
[1:11:21] search the Bible and you see and you
[1:11:23] should show me where God ever dealt with
[1:11:25] intellectual people hunt it for me and
[1:11:28] see if it isn't always the intellectuals
[1:11:31] that devil possess if a big it's a big
[1:11:35] word but it's true I chose you to take
[1:11:37] see that lineage from able to Cain and
[1:11:39] then from for fourteen generations run
[1:11:42] them out and see which one was on the
[1:11:44] smart side and which one was on the
[1:11:46] hummer one see that's what people don't
[1:11:48] understand it has been the intellectual
[1:11:50] Devils in this message that has caused
[1:11:52] the Holy Ghost to flee it's the truth
[1:11:57] they took that quote and that brother
[1:11:59] that took that quote the Holy Ghost
[1:12:02] without sensation they made it just on
[1:12:04] that part and never came back to the
[1:12:06] life of Christ if you're gonna have the
[1:12:08] Holy Ghost without sensation which has
[1:12:10] always been the Holy Ghost has never
[1:12:13] come with sensation because in your soul
[1:12:17] there are no feelings rather than said
[1:12:20] in your soul there's faith or doubt so
[1:12:25] when the Holy Ghost comes it doesn't
[1:12:27] call sensation but as it venture out or
[1:12:31] up it passed through the spirit
[1:12:34] hallelujah through the flesh that's why
[1:12:37] Jesus said I will be like a whale
[1:12:39] springing up and hearties is striking
[1:12:45] that soul and coming up but when it
[1:12:47] comes up that's when the shouting that's
[1:12:49] when the dancing that's when the crying
[1:12:51] that's when you know by feeling
[1:12:54] something has happened to you but the
[1:12:57] feeling comes after the birth the birth
[1:13:01] don't bring the feelings faith brings
[1:13:04] the birth that's way brother been taught
[1:13:09] it that's
[1:13:10] we're always there he just revealed it
[1:13:13] to us and he threw it out there to
[1:13:16] stumble the people that's what I believe
[1:13:19] he knew what he was doing he knew the
[1:13:22] intellectuals have grabbed that cuz he
[1:13:25] said I just ran it he said that's what
[1:13:28] happened in in in the SEC second see he
[1:13:29] said he said those intellectuals start
[1:13:31] coming in there and they wanted to get
[1:13:33] it get rid of all of those one that jump
[1:13:35] and shout and have those great times
[1:13:36] they didn't want that that was
[1:13:38] embarrassing to them and that's exactly
[1:13:40] the way the message is a lot of places
[1:13:43] you start jumping and shouting and
[1:13:45] having the one I'm talking about America
[1:13:46] I don't know about nowhere else I just
[1:13:47] know here you start shouting and
[1:13:49] praising the Lord a lot of times people
[1:13:51] look at you they do just what the
[1:13:53] Methodists and all they crane they next
[1:13:55] I see it I've seen it because of the
[1:13:59] intellectuals now the brother who
[1:14:00] brought took that quote I cuz I remember
[1:14:02] when I came to the message almost every
[1:14:04] church in the message that I had gone to
[1:14:06] had gifts in operation that were working
[1:14:09] Holy Spirit coming down falling people
[1:14:12] being healed when I came into the
[1:14:14] message well and once that quote started
[1:14:17] floating around among the intellectuals
[1:14:18] I could tell you it started even in in
[1:14:20] Ohio you know at the church that were
[1:14:24] considered Mecca and now that brother
[1:14:29] don't even believe the message don't
[1:14:34] even believe it and every time he
[1:14:38] preached for me I should say there's
[1:14:40] something wrong I kept saying about
[1:14:42] their Lord there's something wrong even
[1:14:44] though he preached he is something
[1:14:47] missing now I know you know you love
[1:14:54] Lord I used his wrong one
[1:14:57] a scripture in i'ma let you go 2nd
[1:14:59] Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the foundation
[1:15:03] of God standeth sure having this seal
[1:15:07] the Lord knoweth them that I hear and
[1:15:11] let every one that name it the name of
[1:15:15] Christ depart from iniquity he didn't
[1:15:19] say sin he's an iniquity iniquity
[1:15:23] when you know to do good and you don't
[1:15:25] do it deepali few these things I had oh
[1:15:37] I had so much I still do but you know I
[1:15:41] want to say this by the grace of God we
[1:15:46] are so blessed
[1:15:47] if you ever see how beautiful this
[1:15:53] situation is I was trying to tell
[1:15:56] somebody when brother brother said the
[1:15:57] move is on the bride
[1:15:58] a lot of people don't even know what
[1:16:00] he's saying they just think that you
[1:16:02] know we're here I don't know what they
[1:16:04] think I really don't but what he was
[1:16:07] saying is I've given the Pathan to the
[1:16:09] bride now the same God that worked at me
[1:16:14] we're working her Elijah and Elisha she
[1:16:20] gets a double portion of a light job see
[1:16:24] if something's wrong brother cuz look at
[1:16:26] all of the many works that God did
[1:16:28] through Elijah and Elisha was supposed
[1:16:30] to be a double portion brother and says
[1:16:33] twice as many the greater works is not
[1:16:37] greater or more of its praying time
[1:16:53] it's playing time you love Lord we are
[1:17:01] blessed people and God is not unjust I
[1:17:10] was telling somebody the other day I
[1:17:11] said even as a pastor coming up in this
[1:17:14] message there are things I did not
[1:17:16] understand I thought I did and then when
[1:17:19] God revealed to me the reality of what
[1:17:21] everything was you know I went back and
[1:17:23] I made it right I remember one time I
[1:17:26] was Oh sisters she going with the Lord I
[1:17:28] don't think her thought about that was
[1:17:30] continued she may have changed he said
[1:17:33] every time I look around brother book
[1:17:34] she was a elder what was I supposed to
[1:17:35] say to her you get up to that people on
[1:17:38] that pulpit you always apologize and it
[1:17:40] empathy it wrong they ain't gonna have
[1:17:42] no confidence in you I said well if they
[1:17:45] lose confidence in me because I'm trying
[1:17:48] to make right the thing I made wrong
[1:17:51] then let them have no confidence for me
[1:17:55] but my whole thought about what I do is
[1:17:58] about him having confidence he's the
[1:18:06] only one that I have to stand before to
[1:18:11] get approval it's not your approval it
[1:18:14] gets me in heaven is his approval so you
[1:18:19] know I want to say by God's grace I
[1:18:22] always tell people I said you know what
[1:18:24] I don't mind being corrected nobody
[1:18:27] likes being corrected in the flesh but
[1:18:31] it is so we're grateful oh I've been
[1:18:36] corrected no momma whip you know you
[1:18:40] know like that would be Tom you saying
[1:18:43] so how do people say that you know it
[1:18:46] doesn't affect me it does but one thing
[1:18:48] I know I got the Holy Ghost you'll find
[1:18:50] me I'm gonna always repent when I'm
[1:18:52] wrong because the Holy goes are you
[1:18:54] gonna let me do nothing else you love
[1:18:58] the Lord
[1:18:58] we appreciate you because I never tried
[1:19:03] to make me disappoint it because my
[1:19:05] business didn't show up but
[1:19:07] I thought well you know anything could
[1:19:08] have happened Satan don't want them to
[1:19:10] know truth and they're so close right
[1:19:13] now so close it's part of this message I
[1:19:18] I kind of jumped and skipped because I
[1:19:20] felt like I was laying out something for
[1:19:24] them because of their questions and but
[1:19:28] nonetheless I hope you were were blessed
[1:19:31] the two brothers are interested in being
[1:19:34] baptized and I wanted to really lay it
[1:19:38] out for him tonight so that they could
[1:19:41] understand what how we do it and one
[1:19:45] which one used to be a Catholic and the
[1:19:47] other one I don't think he was not in he
[1:19:49] he didn't even we're gonna believe the
[1:19:50] Bible until I started talking to him and
[1:19:55] he came to church and ever since he'd
[1:19:57] come to church he'd been on fire telling
[1:19:59] everybody telling different ones about
[1:20:01] it because he said up until the end he
[1:20:03] couldn't see how he didn't see the
[1:20:04] reality of it but see this message makes
[1:20:07] it real makes it real it makes it up
[1:20:11] today's book and not some kind of
[1:20:12] history so I think y'all pray for him
[1:20:17] Jared and and Ryan I don't think we
[1:20:22] don't know where my caitlin stands I
[1:20:23] don't know where her interest is but she
[1:20:26] could be just busy because his school
[1:20:28] time she is a volleyball coach so pray
[1:20:32] for her she haven't spoken evil or
[1:20:35] anything neither of them have I just
[1:20:37] pray that God would keep bringing I've
[1:20:41] given one of them I think a church
[1:20:43] church age phone for his mom I need to
[1:20:45] give her one but anyway we're trying to
[1:20:49] get it out and trying to be wise in the
[1:20:52] way we do it they've seen brother Adam
[1:20:54] they seen the picture here the one in my
[1:20:57] house and nobody has asked any question
[1:21:01] as of yet so I don't know the question
[1:21:04] is going to come I've given them
[1:21:06] information so I'm just trusting that
[1:21:10] God will cook their soul
[1:21:12] see a they seem like pride to me but
[1:21:15] only God knows you love the Lord

[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:43] [Music]
[1:22:51] amen
[1:22:52] I also heard brother vana talk about
[1:22:55] joking and gesturing you know I have a
[1:22:57] tendency of getting off on that he was
[1:23:00] telling his wife he says you know
[1:23:04] there's been three great men in America
[1:23:08] he's Abraham Lincoln George Washington
[1:23:11] and William Branham and his wife says
[1:23:15] bill don't you start - now he was just
[1:23:20] joking but he said the Holy Ghost
[1:23:22] convicted him and he had to go and pray
[1:23:25] that God would take that spirit off of
[1:23:27] him
[1:23:28] he said because once you do it he said
[1:23:30] it destroys you began to do
[1:23:33] I said all of that to say please pray
[1:23:36] for me that God will take that joking
[1:23:40] spirit away from me and make me more
[1:23:42] serious and consecrated unto the Lord
[1:23:44] sometimes you know things but you don't
[1:23:47] know things and if you think about it
[1:23:49] just the other day I was talking with
[1:23:51] some brothers and he's got a joking
[1:23:52] I say brothers it ain't gonna get better
[1:23:55] it's gonna get worse because once you
[1:23:57] start one joke it triggers everybody
[1:24:00] started joking and caring and all of a
[1:24:02] sudden somebody's offended so we're in
[1:24:04] there you know and so I said and I saw
[1:24:08] that thing I thought I saw a trick like
[1:24:09] that oh so why hey thank you Jesus thank
[1:24:13] you Father for showing me you know like
[1:24:19] the other day ours but we were coming in
[1:24:21] here I felt so convicted for that three
[1:24:24] days I think it was I just asked a lot
[1:24:26] of a that's and then I heard the tape
[1:24:28] because I was we were talking about how
[1:24:30] to anger the camera and I said well I
[1:24:35] want to make sure I'm in the pit you can
[1:24:36] hope then our brother much of the world
[1:24:41] oh where did that come from or something
[1:24:43] like that I can't remember Batum and in
[1:24:45] brotherto and I'm like oh my god I'm
[1:24:47] just carrying on but I'm convicting I'm
[1:24:50] convicted right then brother but I'm
[1:24:51] trying to show that I'm not but the Lord
[1:24:55] will not let that go because that was
[1:24:58] something that came so some truth was
[1:25:01] there see every joke carries truth
[1:25:05] certain amount of truth that's oh god
[1:25:08] that's pride or something didn't know I
[1:25:12] had it in there and I asked the Lord to
[1:25:14] take that out of my heart because I'm
[1:25:16] not here to be seen I don't care if I
[1:25:18] don't have a camera or nothing we've
[1:25:20] gone low down without it but whatever
[1:25:23] made me say that I just don't ever wear
[1:25:25] order to ever come out of her mouth
[1:25:27] again because the Lord did not like it
[1:25:30] he didn't we it wasn't we didn't I talk
[1:25:32] to everybody besides you you don't know
[1:25:34] when and God brought it up again so I
[1:25:36] can make it right with you though so
[1:25:37] forgive me for that Oh ain't God good to
[1:25:41] us all and brother come sings a song
[1:25:42] everybody does our prayer today
[1:25:46] you
