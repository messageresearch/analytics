[10:07] yes you love the Lord let's get right
[10:12] into the Word of God please glad to see
[10:35] you welcome as we stand
[10:42] turn to Jeremiah please we'll go to
[10:47] Jeremiah the first chapter from Jeremiah
[10:53] we'll go to 2nd Timothy please Jeremiah
[11:05] chapter we'll begin reading at the
[11:09] fourth verse then the word of the Lord
[11:13] came unto me saying behold I formed thee
[11:18] in the belly I knew thee and before thou
[11:22] Kamath forth out of the womb I
[11:25] sanctified thee and I ordained thee a
[11:31] prophet unto the nations
[11:33] then said I our Lord God behold I cannot
[11:40] speak for I am a child but the Lord said
[11:45] unto me see not I am a child for thou
[11:47] shalt go to all that I shall send thee
[11:51] and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt
[11:56] speak be not afraid of their faces for I
[12:02] am with thee to deliver thee saith the
[12:06] Lord
[12:06] then the Lord put forth his hand and
[12:09] touched my mouth and the Lord said unto
[12:13] me behold I have put my words in thy
[12:18] mouth see I have this day set the over
[12:24] the nation's and over the kingdom's to
[12:28] root out to pull down and to destroy and
[12:34] to throw down to build and to plant 2nd
[12:40] 2nd Timothy
[12:48] first chapter 12th first for the witch
[12:53] cause I also suffer these things
[12:57] nevertheless I am not ashamed I know
[13:02] whom I have believed and am persuaded
[13:06] that he is able to keep that which I
[13:11] have committed unto him against that day
[13:15] let us pray father God we come before
[13:18] you Lord we thank you for your grace in
[13:20] your mercy we thank you for your
[13:22] goodness we just pray father God that
[13:24] you would bless the service in a special
[13:27] way give us grace to kamut move
[13:29] completely out of your way Lord oh Jesus
[13:32] you're God and we pray father God that
[13:36] you will move give us a heart to hear a
[13:39] heart to receive Lord let the Seas of
[13:42] God be planted in our hearts that we may
[13:46] bring forth a hundredfold in Jesus
[13:49] Christ's name we pray amen
[13:51] you may be seated I'm not gonna be long
[13:55] tonight but I just wanted to express the
[14:00] thought I believe that God gave me the
[14:04] enemy has tried everything he can do
[14:14] against the royal seed of God but the
[14:19] one thing we know for sure is that God's
[14:21] Word does not and cannot come back boy
[14:26] one of the things that God wants from
[14:29] his people is complete trust the Bible
[14:33] says trust the Lord with all of your
[14:35] heart and lean not to your own
[14:38] understanding and when you do that and
[14:43] when we do that we know that we
[14:46] acknowledge him and everything because
[14:49] we realized that he's the great Shepherd
[14:52] when we
[14:54] about trust we're talking about reliance
[14:56] on the integra tree or strength or
[15:01] ability or surety of a person or thing
[15:05] in other words having confidence I know
[15:10] my Redeemer liveth I know God cannot
[15:15] fail David said in a time of trouble he
[15:22] said hide me he hide me in that secret
[15:26] place we see the world falling apart and
[15:32] we see what we're about to embrace not
[15:35] just in the United States but all over
[15:38] the world means hearts are failing for
[15:43] fear because they don't have a place of
[15:46] safety David is such an expressive man
[15:50] he said the name of the Lord is a strong
[15:53] tower and the righteous run it in and
[15:56] they are saying you and I can't get any
[16:01] safer because we cannot perish you and I
[16:09] can even be defiled
[16:13] because God ordained us to be virgins
[16:17] and it's something that you and I cannot
[16:20] understand because we are creatures that
[16:24] have a tendency to make mistakes but
[16:29] what we fail to see is the blood covers
[16:33] not only does the blood covers but the
[16:36] blood washes and when the blood washes
[16:42] there is nothing left to remind God of
[16:48] what you and I have done we come out
[16:52] pure unstained as if we have never seen
[16:58] in the first place in on top of the
[17:03] God gives us an assurance you know I
[17:06] thank God for the CD because in the seed
[17:09] all of the potential of God is in that
[17:12] seed but God what God needs for us to do
[17:17] for him he has already placed it in the
[17:21] seed is nothing like being appointed and
[17:28] anointed to do the will of God but most
[17:36] of us just like men we always give God
[17:39] an excuse why we can't do it Moses says
[17:47] Lord Who am I in other words are you
[17:52] talking to me Who am I that you would
[17:58] send me down to Egypt down to Pharaoh
[18:04] but God had to build complete trust see
[18:09] Moses was not only just on a job for the
[18:12] Lord but as he was challenged his trust
[18:18] had to be built can you imagine what it
[18:21] was like when when Moses threw down his
[18:24] rod Janna's and Jambres threw down
[18:26] theirs
[18:29] Moses thought he was the originator what
[18:34] he saw there in God with God in the
[18:36] wilderness he didn't know that Egypt
[18:38] could duplicate it now hear what I'm
[18:41] saying but Moses was the chosen one see
[18:46] a lot of us we can see Moses but we
[18:48] can't see house else you and I have been
[18:53] appointed it is the only reason why we
[18:57] can see this message you don't see this
[19:00] message on your intellect you see this
[19:03] message because God appointed you but I
[19:09] just don't want to be appointed I want
[19:12] to be anointed because it is the
[19:15] anointing that this
[19:17] choice and break the yolks even Jesus
[19:24] had to wrassle when he went to the
[19:28] Garden of Gethsemane he wrestled with
[19:31] himself he knew through the Scriptures
[19:37] what his future was holding for him and
[19:41] he still said Lord not I I don't want to
[19:48] go is that right even the prophet of God
[19:52] said Jesus did not he's a man he said
[19:55] Lord let my not my will but thine be
[19:58] done let this cup pass away from me and
[20:02] you and I must understand God didn't put
[20:06] us in this age for nothing you got to
[20:10] fight but you can't fight the battle
[20:14] until God anoints you is that right you
[20:18] know it's just like what Moses did when
[20:20] Moses tried to do the job that God
[20:23] appointed him to do he failed because he
[20:26] lacked the anointing he had to meet God
[20:30] on the backside of the desert
[20:33] see that's what I'm trying to get people
[20:35] to see you and I cannot fulfill this
[20:39] message until the Holy Ghost come down
[20:42] and dwell within you you might know this
[20:47] message you can read it you can quote it
[20:49] hallelujah you can read this map this
[20:52] book hallelujah but until that Holy
[20:55] Ghost come was that is that right
[20:59] it's the same as it was with Jesus the
[21:02] true son of God and he was able to do
[21:05] miracles he turned water into wine
[21:10] hallelujah but he still had to be filled
[21:17] huh Jesus a Word of God Jesus God
[21:23] hallelujah but it took God at the river
[21:27] of Jordan when charge
[21:30] knew what to look for when Jesus came to
[21:34] be baptized the Bible said the Spirit of
[21:37] the Lord descended upon him like a dog
[21:40] hallelujah I love that People of God
[21:43] because a dove represents love a dog
[21:47] represents peace hallelujah you may have
[21:49] heard me to say though he was a Lion of
[21:51] Judah he had to be baptized with love
[21:55] because God so loved the world
[22:01] Moses even said Lord you know I can't KK
[22:04] can't talk hallelujah
[22:10] but God said you see this is what I love
[22:13] about God he takes the least to make it
[22:16] great is that right he doesn't take the
[22:20] swell-up preachers and big people the
[22:23] people who think they everything and all
[22:25] and all God take those that are
[22:27] unnoticeable the ones you think God
[22:31] won't use are the ones that God will use
[22:35] who would Jeremiah that God would call
[22:38] him who was astir that God would call
[22:44] her she was appointed and anointed to do
[22:50] what the will of God but you know what
[22:55] it won't do you any good if you and I
[22:59] cannot completely trust his leadership
[23:04] David had to come and Trust his complete
[23:07] leadership yea though I walk through the
[23:11] valley in the shadow of death I'll fear
[23:14] no evil because I'm a strong man
[23:18] no because thou art with me
[23:23] hallelujah complete trust that's what
[23:27] God wants he was us to completely trust
[23:31] him rely on him using for our strength
[23:43] is that right David said the Lord he's
[23:46] my buckler and my shield he does ever
[23:51] take Elias I've got the ability to do it
[23:54] no sure the Lord is my strength he is
[23:58] the strength of my life see that's what
[24:02] you must understand he must be how can I
[24:05] say it acknowledged everyday
[24:08] you can't do nothing is all God in you
[24:14] even job I said Lord I can I do it you
[24:19] know Jim I head he didn't know what he
[24:21] was in for but if you read Jeremiah he's
[24:26] supposed to be the man of the hour and
[24:29] then you see him running you see him
[24:33] being beaten you see him being thrown in
[24:36] jail period after period he get out of
[24:39] this 1k and then he is up in another
[24:42] cage but he's God's man God told him
[24:49] whatever you do don't be afraid of their
[24:51] faces have you ever seen hatred I mean
[24:57] the expression of hatred on a man's face
[25:00] will cause your heart to beat faster
[25:04] because you know that hatred is the kind
[25:07] that will kill you
[25:09] somebody help me here see you and I must
[25:13] understand that this like I said this
[25:15] morning unbelief came by the serpent it
[25:20] came by the devil before he interrupted
[25:22] God what yeah
[25:25] pure faith Adam never doubted God he
[25:30] doubted God and ever since then we've
[25:35] had a battle with that when you talk
[25:38] about this Christian walk I love it
[25:44] the brother said when it comes to
[25:47] sacrifice you gotta have pain I will
[25:52] never forget that you don't sacrifice
[25:54] there is no sacrifice if there is no
[25:57] pain now hear me sacrifice means to go
[26:02] beyond what you are capable of doing in
[26:07] the norm it goes beyond what's your your
[26:12] what's comfortable to you it causes pain
[26:19] spiritually unnaturally it's causes pain
[26:23] whenever you sacrifice you ever had
[26:26] somebody said brother Brooks when you
[26:28] come and take me somewhere and you're so
[26:30] tired and and you could say no but
[26:34] something says go he'd only do it and
[26:36] the whole time you're driving this
[26:40] person somewhere you thinking how good
[26:42] that bid would feel at this present time
[26:45] that's what you call a sacrifice and God
[26:52] honors those sacrifices you and I must
[27:02] understand Paul says for this cause
[27:03] which I suffer these things nevertheless
[27:06] I am NOT a saying Paul says I'm not the
[27:10] same I know who I am
[27:11] I've been appointed I am anointed I've
[27:14] been sent by God but watch it now but
[27:16] I'm humble but because I'm humble I
[27:21] don't don't get it confused like people
[27:25] think meekness is weakness the Bible
[27:29] tells us there was no body as meek as
[27:31] Moses and there was nothing weak about
[27:34] it you and I must understand that the
[27:39] bride if you got hallelujah
[27:42] let me say like this until it may seem
[27:44] like you're being boastful but you've
[27:48] got to come to acknowledge who you are
[27:51] you've got to come and step in your
[27:54] place it's not that you're proud and
[27:59] arrogant but you know who you are and
[28:02] you solid on those grounds you're not a
[28:07] pushover for the devil you and I must
[28:14] understand by God's grace that God amen
[28:18] has us here because we need to trust him
[28:22] you say trust and yes it all your
[28:27] prayers you'll never know how far down
[28:31] the road you come until you trust him
[28:35] trust meaning that I know that my God is
[28:41] able to deliver me do you know that when
[28:49] you know God is able to deliver guess
[28:51] what you don't worry you don't worry
[28:56] worry it's a lack of faith
[28:59] it's the absent of faith hallelujah when
[29:03] you when you trust God it means that you
[29:07] you you you how can I say it let me say
[29:11] it like this if any of you have seen a
[29:14] pride of lions and those little Cubs are
[29:19] laying there they could care less what's
[29:22] coming out there way up there because
[29:25] they know they are protected y'all
[29:30] hearing them saying they know they are
[29:32] protected and you and I must realize
[29:34] amen why should I fear when I know I am
[29:41] protected Somoza well you got cancer
[29:45] that doesn't mean nothing to me why
[29:49] should I fear when I know I'm protected
[29:52] Oh
[29:58] I want to say somebody let me go on when
[30:01] we think about how God has ordained us
[30:04] and let me tell you something you may
[30:06] not be a preacher of an Oracle preacher
[30:08] like I am but everybody is a preacher
[30:12] the Bible said you are living in pistil
[30:15] written and read of all men and the
[30:19] Bible says that in God there is no fear
[30:24] hello
[30:26] because groping love casts out fear
[30:30] so when love comes in fear goes out now
[30:37] the Bible doesn't say that love ask fear
[30:41] to leave the Bible says love cast fear
[30:44] out
[30:47] it's a difference oh I'm coming in for
[30:50] you you got to go no sure love grabs
[30:53] fear and throws him out
[30:56] you don't belong here this house of this
[31:01] this tabernacle is the tabernacle of God
[31:05] and the only thing that belongs in this
[31:08] house is God this is no longer my house
[31:13] it's his house know ye not that you are
[31:18] the house of God yo hear what I'm saying
[31:23] and if you are the house of God you are
[31:26] walking omnipotent when Jesus was here
[31:35] and he went to see Legion Legion saw
[31:42] far off Legion saw all that character
[31:49] coming see the devil a nurse care he's
[31:52] not afraid of your words only but if you
[31:55] got the character to back it that Christ
[31:58] there he he see that Holy Ghost he see
[32:00] that light coming his way in a place of
[32:02] darkness that devil gets scared I was
[32:05] sure I seen it even this morning the
[32:07] delegate of he's afraid of the character
[32:12] of God because he know that divine
[32:14] character is God himself
[32:18] hallelujah see when we don't believe the
[32:21] Bible says the devil believe and
[32:23] trembles
[32:27] but how you going to get the devil
[32:29] afraid of you when you afraid of the
[32:31] devil let me tell you something you
[32:34] can't Bluff Satan Satan is a beast
[32:37] and every beast smell and senses fear
[32:42] you can say you don't that's why when it
[32:46] come to casting out Devils you better
[32:47] not fear don't even bother with it if
[32:50] you're nervous about it
[32:52] hallelujah but when those things come
[32:55] you've got to know that you know that
[32:57] you're know that God is on the throne
[33:02] did you know we were called cast out
[33:04] Devils the Bible said we have called and
[33:08] cast out devils we have come by God's
[33:11] grace and then to prove to the devil
[33:14] Amen that God is still alive and he sits
[33:18] on the throne see saving out all these
[33:21] scientists and all of the world
[33:23] believing that God is dead and you and I
[33:25] have been delivered in this age to prove
[33:27] to them that God is not dead hallelujah
[33:33] understand me
[33:34] we're not even afraid of death come on
[33:39] if you've been truly born again you are
[33:42] not afraid of death is that right
[33:50] all laughed in the face of death Oh
[33:51] death where is your sting o grave where
[33:54] is your victory
[33:56] thanks be to God who gives us victory
[34:00] through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[34:03] complete trust how many you can wait on
[34:07] God
[34:08] see that's the danger we don't know how
[34:11] to wait
[34:12] we must put God on hard time schedule
[34:14] God is not on your time schedule you and
[34:18] I are all here scheduled the fact you
[34:20] supposed to be dead and if your dad you
[34:27] know my waiting is that right
[34:31] cuz when you dad you can lay in that
[34:34] grave Amen go move you go stay right

[34:50] see what they did when God didn't tell
[34:52] them to get go up there they got beat up
[34:54] when God don't tell you to go up you get
[34:57] beat up but when God says go and you go
[35:00] it spells Vict o Allah complete victory
[35:04] hallelujah think about it how many of
[35:09] you were to continue to believe in God
[35:10] see that's what real faith is remember
[35:13] that little lady and her husband they
[35:15] had a baby that was sick
[35:17] they prayed it was brother branham to
[35:19] pray for the baby they pray for the baby
[35:21] and God took the baby anyhow and the
[35:23] lady saw brother Branham down after why
[35:25] Allah says brother Branham where did we
[35:27] doubt where did we fail he said no you
[35:30] didn't doubt you didn't fail that was
[35:31] God's will
[35:33] amen he said it proves you got faith
[35:36] because even though he said no you still
[35:39] love him hallelujah
[35:43] see even if God says no to you you still
[35:47] should love it wait
[35:57] praying all night and they gonna throw
[36:00] me in the fire in the morning yeah I
[36:04] understand I haven't heard from him he
[36:08] normally come by and put his hands on my
[36:10] shoulders but he didn't do that this
[36:12] morning he didn't do that through the
[36:14] night I prayed and I pray and I haven't

[36:21] bow because I know he's able even if he
[36:28] doesn't answer I'm still serving haha
[36:35] because I trust his judgments all of his
[36:41] judgments are true and all of them are
[36:44] right Oh Lord how come I've got to go
[36:48] through such a hard time in this life
[36:50] heaven in all things give thanks it's a
[36:57] danger when you don't see that's what

[40:03] know it the way we do think God would
[40:05] have slew we would have been slain
[40:07] already because we will like I told you
[40:12] Jeremiah the people didn't appreciate
[40:13] God they've gotten to the place Amen
[40:16] that God had become common tool now but
[40:19] if you are deigned that's why that's why
[40:22] God told Gideon says now I'm gonna watch
[40:24] those men that go down to war because
[40:26] these got to be in the right place they
[40:29] got to do the right thing I want the
[40:30] ones who drink this water like they
[40:32] ready for battle
[40:34] hallelujah I don't want them sitting up
[40:37] there Amen like they in some kind of you
[40:39] know place you know they don't even
[40:41] realize they in battle like he ain't
[40:46] gonna pump me up brother well you either
[40:48] believe brother Brooks is saying it or
[40:50] you believe God is saying it if brother
[40:52] Bruce is saying that you're not in
[40:53] trouble
[40:54] but if God is saying it and you're
[40:56] responding the way you're responding
[40:57] you're in trouble so let's move on you
[41:03] and I must realize by God it is what
[41:05] Brenda Gemma Jeremiah I want you to go
[41:08] up root I want you to cut down I want
[41:11] you to tear down I want you to remove it
[41:13] and then I want you to build also God go
[41:18] either bill you or break you every tree
[41:21] that can that bow God will break ah see
[41:29] there's no way people can love God and
[41:31] treat him the way they do I don't
[41:33] believe it but in all of these things
[41:36] you and I must understand him and when
[41:39] it comes to serving God those that are
[41:44] pointed and those that are anointed
[41:47] knows what
[41:49] to do is that right brother branham said
[41:52] the bride will know what to do with the
[41:56] word and sometime we think that is just
[41:59] raving the day or something like that no
[42:02] sir some time is just simplicity
[42:06] honoring God and giving him reverence
[42:11] because the world knows nothing about it
[42:17] hello the world knows nothing about it
[42:21] but if any group of people are on earth
[42:25] that should know if there be any that
[42:28] should know it should be this bride this
[42:32] anointing Missa place should be I don't
[42:34] care for two or three and in this place
[42:36] there should be such an electrifying
[42:39] nineteen hallelujah that even the
[42:42] unbeliever when they come through those
[42:44] curtains they men should be convicted it
[42:47] don't take a safe person to recognize
[42:50] the presence of God and say people know
[42:56] when God is in the house that's what you
[43:01] have been called for you have been
[43:03] called to take the Living God off of
[43:06] these pages and make him live not in
[43:10] somebody else's life your life we're not
[43:15] fulfilling the Scriptures until we leave
[43:17] this book there okay
[43:25] Paul says I bow my knees and don't you
[43:29] know every knees going about every
[43:32] tongue will confess to the glory of the
[43:36] Lord Jesus Christ every one even if you
[43:40] don't do it now you're going to do it
[43:43] whether it be believer or unbeliever
[43:46] you're going to bow so let us bow now
[43:51] let us humble ourselves now before the
[43:55] Living God hallelujah you know we think
[43:58] some time God is going to accept our
[44:00] persons God except in your person your
[44:03] person that's not even supposed to be
[44:04] living oh yeah yeah brother branham said
[44:07] we must die in or out I told her sister
[44:13] yesterday one of my closest friend in
[44:16] South Carolina female is dying right now
[44:18] if God don't help her but my friend has
[44:23] little things odds
[44:24] she's got odds I've always tried to tell
[44:28] her to make things right and whether she
[44:30] did or not I know I don't know but right
[44:32] now she's in hospice or whatever it
[44:34] called it and she don't want anybody to
[44:36] visit but her mother-in-law called me
[44:41] cuz mother-in-law got problems too and
[44:45] that says I don't know I just got in the
[44:48] Holy Spirit I just began to talk I said
[44:50] don't you know if you can't forgive God
[44:53] won't forgive you oh is that right the
[44:59] parable said that the master would found
[45:03] out that the other land the other boss
[45:05] would not forgive and guess what he did
[45:09] he took all of his forgiveness back from
[45:12] him everything he had been forgiven for
[45:16] was reapplied to him y'all know what I'm
[45:19] saying I'm saying everything that he had
[45:21] done he's no longer scot-free and ago he
[45:25] was scot-free God cleansed and made him
[45:29] free but because he would not forgive
[45:32] his brother all of his debt was brought
[45:34] back on him and he was cast out into
[45:37] darkness is that right hallelujah and
[45:41] Jesus said if you don't forgive I'm
[45:43] telling her this I said Jesus said if
[45:46] you don't forgive neither where my
[45:47] father in heaven forgive you and how
[45:51] many of us deserve forgiveness none of
[45:53] us the Bible said in that while we were
[45:56] yet sinners Christ died for us
[45:59] hallelujah
[46:01] there ain't no way you're gonna be
[46:04] allowed Satan to make your religious and
[46:07] come to church and pay your ties and pay
[46:10] your offering and still go to hell
[46:12] because you won't forgive that doesn't
[46:16] make sense
[46:18] it's not the choice of a wise man so I
[46:23] told her that she's all oh I heard she
[46:28] really something struck her I said
[46:30] because sister you don't want her to die
[46:32] and you haven't talked with her you
[46:36] haven't spoken with her
[46:38] you haven't said forgive me and and I'll
[46:41] forgive you simple words you don't have
[46:43] to go out in a long drawn-out thing and
[46:46] go through everything and everything
[46:48] that has been done you know what's been
[46:50] done please forgive me for being the
[46:56] mother-in-law I was forgive me and I
[47:00] forgive you
[47:01] I said you ought at least give her that
[47:03] moment of peace before she leaves I hear
[47:07] you understand me but we got people
[47:10] among the living that won't forgive one
[47:12] another and expect a prosper we forget
[47:16] the judgment that we render to each
[47:19] other we'll be judged bad hallelujah is
[47:24] that all right there people you've been
[47:27] ordained you've been anointed you've
[47:30] been appointed the bride of Jesus Christ
[47:33] and the bride of Jesus Christ was
[47:35] birthed under forgiveness you've heard
[47:38] me say that again before listen Jesus
[47:41] when he was not ready to leave he said
[47:44] Father forgive them for I know not what
[47:46] they know not what they do
[47:47] what did he do he didn't say oh look at
[47:50] these evil people look at these bad
[47:52] people they have crucified me he
[47:54] realized he was in the word he was right
[47:57] where God wanted him to be and he
[48:00] forgave those people you say that's not
[48:05] right it's right because Stephen was a
[48:09] product of Jesus ministry he received
[48:15] the same Holy Ghost that Jesus got when
[48:22] they were stolen and Stephen he said
[48:24] Lord holders not to their charge
[48:27] were they guilty they were guilty
[48:31] while you guilty you were guilty that's
[48:34] what iniquity is when you know to do
[48:37] good and you do it not and God still
[48:39] forgive you when you can trust God with
[48:48] all of your heart and lean not to your
[48:50] own understanding it ain't about you is
[48:56] about him when you come to Christ your
[48:59] life ends it's about Jesus now it's
[49:05] about proving to the world that he's
[49:07] alive and well and he's living in here
[49:12] we've had religion before we were born
[49:16] religion is going all the way back to
[49:18] Genesis I don't care nothing about
[49:21] religion
[49:22] I won't salvation I want the Living God
[49:25] a man that lives there live here
[49:29] hallelujah I want him to direct my path
[49:32] when I get popped up I want him to
[49:35] humble me little pride whatever come I
[49:39] was telling somebody yesterday I said at
[49:41] what place do you have space in your
[49:43] life for pride why would you hold pride
[49:48] in your life when the Bible said that
[49:49] prior leads to destruction it brings you
[49:52] to a farm that's right
[49:58] they got so much pride they don't know
[50:00] how to humble themselves to each other
[50:05] Jesus at PETA let me wash your feet huh
[50:12] if anybody should have Church you should
[50:15] have should have had a little
[50:16] something-something it was Jesus is that
[50:22] right oh you can you know sometimes
[50:24] people walk with pride pride is a spirit
[50:34] people said you ever seen a person that
[50:37] look mean because all they look mean but
[50:40] they're sweet as I don't know how you
[50:43] just hadn't hit the right button yet
[50:45] that means spirit is there for that face
[50:49] expressing me this is because they need
[50:52] them mean so much and so long - the
[50:55] devil is impressing himself through it
[50:59] all you got to do is hit it right and
[51:01] you'll see it you know that easy it is
[51:06] nothing but the truth
[51:08] but when Steven was being stole he his
[51:13] face didn't turn demonic no the Bible
[51:19] said the light of God saw he had the
[51:22] face of an angel even when they were
[51:26] stalling him that's bright and we create
[51:37] are we crazy Paul head
[51:43] he could have gotten out of going to
[51:45] Nero's chopping block but the word of
[51:49] the Lord came to Paul they said you got
[51:53] to go to Rome he didn't run matter of
[51:59] fact he pushed the issue when he could
[52:03] have got out of it he wouldn't get out
[52:07] of it because it was the will of the
[52:09] Lord that's what you call a sheep a
[52:13] sheep will allow God to lead him even to
[52:17] death that's the word and whenever God
[52:23] brings a test on you is for you it ain't
[52:26] for the manual finding you issue you
[52:29] need to be humbled you need something
[52:32] out of you the test is no test when
[52:36] Shadrach and Meshach Abednego and men
[52:39] were being tested going to be thrown
[52:40] into the fiery furnace it was for them
[52:44] they got the victory
[52:46] the Babylonians died in the fire but
[52:51] they met Jesus in the fire the same God
[52:56] they've been praying to waited to answer
[52:59] them by joining them in the fire and
[53:03] fellowshipping with them hello Daniel we
[53:09] didn't know what God was gonna do but
[53:12] when he went into the lion's den he
[53:14] realized that the Lions had become
[53:16] kittens I can see him now right now I'm
[53:19] just a little sleepy come over here Leo
[53:21] fluff him up a little bit and laid his
[53:24] head on it now that's a little drama
[53:29] that's y'all know what I'm saying
[53:32] but in all of that and I'm getting ready
[53:34] to close how are you gonna trust God if
[53:37] he doesn't test you how are you going to
[53:42] know whether you got divine love if your
[53:43] love is not tested how are you going to
[53:48] know Amen it's the truth even that you
[53:50] love your children until they go wayward
[53:52] is when they go wayward then
[53:56] you know whether you love them as long
[53:59] as they doing whatever you want them to
[54:00] do Oh child I love you sweetie
[54:03] no God says we're gonna try that one
[54:09] that's the truth it's the same when you
[54:12] get married oh honey I love y'all no
[54:15] honey on the moon but some days that one
[54:23] day is one of those days of those days
[54:25] at the well that honey remove itself
[54:27] honey a on the moon um oh all right are
[54:32] you gonna still loving when the honey is
[54:33] gone
[54:35] y'all understand me it's God testing you
[54:39] those who the true son of God or
[54:42] daughter God must be tested trials and
[54:45] tested testing is a part of the journey
[54:48] and understand this it is to bill your
[54:50] character can you love the unlovable is
[54:55] that right can you love those who hate
[54:57] you love those who despise you now y'all
[55:00] got understand I'm talking about bride
[55:02] here only the bride has the ability to
[55:05] do that but you know he just hurt my
[55:11] feelings oh she hurt my feelings in now
[55:13] and she embarrassed me I thought you was
[55:15] dead you can't embarrass a dead man that
[55:25] right I'm not saying nothing different
[55:27] than what brother Branham said he said
[55:30] you got a diary right think about the
[55:33] prophet of God even he was so dad he
[55:36] could catch two people spouse they said
[55:38] I love you and he catch they thought
[55:40] that they hated him but he never showed
[55:43] them that he caught their thought and
[55:46] knew that they hated him he was like
[55:50] Jesus he kissed the man who hated him
[55:57] you and I would get on that Facebook and
[56:00] whatsapp and whatever else I don't know
[56:03] I don't have facebook so I don't know
[56:05] nothing about that stuff but my point is
[56:07] we get on all of these chat rooms and
[56:11] you don't know what chat is chat turns
[56:14] into gossip you watch a person that talk
[56:19] all the time after a while it's gonna
[56:22] they go lie can I talk all the time
[56:27] without lying the truth watch watch what
[56:37] I'm saying it's the truth
[56:38] you found a person they go run out of
[56:43] truth that's why were supposed you know
[56:51] we supposed to watch the words we say
[56:54] it's not good to talk all the time a lot
[56:56] of time it's good to listen anyway let's
[57:00] move on I'm almost done cuz we got
[57:02] communion tonight communion is a
[57:08] powerful service to me now we're not
[57:14] there yet but let me close on this
[57:15] message let's put our cell
[57:21] for just a moment as Shadrach Meshach
[57:22] and Abednego is getting ready to be
[57:24] thrown into the furnace we've heard the
[57:28] story so many times but you and I must
[57:31] understand that they were so tested the
[57:37] God didn't show up until they were in
[57:41] the fire we look at those who were
[57:47] coming through times of where they were
[57:54] persecuting and killing you know in the
[58:00] Romans days in those days where they
[58:02] were persecuting Christians they had you
[58:04] remember you remember this
[58:05] they had these ox these gods that they
[58:09] worship - and the gods were so big they
[58:13] could literally put people in there in
[58:18] the belly of these beasts that had been
[58:22] formed in fashion and underneath that
[58:26] barely they would have fire so literally
[58:30] you were inside of that thing roasting
[58:35] I've seen amen even things that they did
[58:40] in the medieval time when they were
[58:43] killing Christians they literally like
[58:46] we would put people on our goat or sheep
[58:51] and we put him on the rotisserie and we
[58:54] just circle him like that they would put
[58:58] Christians on those kind of machines and
[59:02] said we're gonna keep roasting you until
[59:04] you deny and we say we made out of the
[59:09] same material come on somebody oh they
[59:15] would take a woman who's pregnant and
[59:17] let the wild dogs loose on them and the
[59:22] dogs would rip the babies out of their
[59:23] bellies and they're still go out
[59:27] praising God
[59:32] and we're made out of the same material
[59:38] we might say they were stalled or TAS or
[59:42] whatever you might want to say in that
[59:44] growing up of the bride tree but now in
[59:51] this day we supposed to be more powerful
[59:55] more sound more convicted and convinced
[1:00:01] because now the seed is going back to
[1:00:04] the sea and that which they had on the
[1:00:09] day of Pentecost right there what part
[1:00:13] was sea and people in that day knew that
[1:00:19] they have been with Jesus do anybody on
[1:00:24] your job know that you've been with
[1:00:25] Jesus wherever you go do they know
[1:00:30] you've been with Jesus let me tell you
[1:00:33] something I don't care wherever I go
[1:00:35] I'll make sure people know especially if
[1:00:38] I'm going to return to that place they
[1:00:40] need to know I'm a Christian but you
[1:00:43] ain't got to tell nobody no I don't but
[1:00:45] I want to tell them because if you don't
[1:00:48] tell them they're gonna get out of the
[1:00:49] way somewhere maybe they'll have a
[1:00:52] little more respect for you if you do
[1:00:54] and guess what if you tell them that
[1:00:56] you're Christians they're gonna watch
[1:00:57] you and I want them to watch me because
[1:01:05] if they watch me they'll see Jesus love
[1:01:11] the Lord so that you'll know that my
[1:01:16] iPad went out on me about 20 minutes ago
[1:01:21] I thought I had charged it earlier and
[1:01:25] it wasn't charging but you know God is
[1:01:28] good anyhow I trust that you enjoy the
[1:01:32] word you and I must understand that this
[1:01:34] food that we come why do you come to
[1:01:36] church and I'm a clothes and go go get
[1:01:38] there to the why do we go to church but
[1:01:41] why do you hear the word but do you come
[1:01:42] near the word is it to gain knowledge
[1:01:46] right you come because you know that
[1:01:49] that word is a changing factor it can
[1:01:52] change you that's what I come to church
[1:01:55] for I come to church amen to be changed
[1:01:59] so I can grow into him and be perfect as
[1:02:02] our brother say huh that's why I said
[1:02:06] perfect love casts out fear this morning
[1:02:09] I said if you fall you don't never
[1:02:11] thirst hallelujah
[1:02:14] if you fall you're not hungry
[1:02:17] you fall and when you full of God God
[1:02:23] has a coming you and you will become God
[1:02:29] hello God becomes you and you become God
[1:02:35] he said I've never seen God before yes
[1:02:39] every time I look at your face I see God
[1:02:44] God a metamorphose even though he's a
[1:02:46] God and you know it's amazing because I
[1:02:49] love the butterfly the butterfly is one
[1:02:50] that can change from old dirty nasty
[1:02:52] worm yeah you know what I'm saying you
[1:02:55] really find a girl that's afraid of a
[1:02:57] butterfly but if you show her a work of
[1:03:01] her
[1:03:02] that's a different story right and she
[1:03:06] doesn't even know that one day that
[1:03:08] there was a time that worm that
[1:03:12] butterfly was a worm
[1:03:13] what about one thing about metamorphosis
[1:03:16] I heard the brothers say and it's so
[1:03:19] true once it's changed it cannot go back
[1:03:27] hallelujah if you find somebody they can
[1:03:30] go back they never was changed they just
[1:03:35] thought they had it he loved the Lord we
[1:03:40] ordained folks you just like Jesus but
[1:03:44] Jesus need the anointing hello
[1:03:48] he was the word but he had to become the
[1:03:51] Living Word you understand me that's why
[1:03:56] he
[1:03:57] the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus God
[1:04:01] Himself needed the Holy Ghost to anoint
[1:04:05] the word you are the word but you'll
[1:04:09] never be able to live this message until
[1:04:12] the life of the word come in you you

[1:04:46] Bible today you never thought about it
[1:04:47] until you saw it in my but nevertheless
[1:04:51] I'm gonna use it to the glory of God so

[1:05:16] that churches don't fight they do fight
[1:05:18] they got all kinds of stuff going on in
[1:05:20] him and why what the scripture says
[1:05:23] about a church that fights each other

[1:06:44] about 50-60 it seemed to be stretched
[1:06:50] y'all know what I'm talking about I'm
[1:06:51] using this phrase you know what I'm
[1:06:53] talking about
[1:06:54] you know what I'm saying here's the
[1:06:59] truth when I was when I was a little boy
[1:07:04] we knew how my mama taught me how to
[1:07:07] cook how to sew how to clean how to work
[1:07:13] there was no such thing as a dirty room
[1:07:18] mama I'm too little
[1:07:20] a man I don't know how to cook get on
[1:07:23] that pot you had to step on something to
[1:07:28] get to the sink
[1:07:30] right oh come on it's the truth
[1:07:34] you say oh that was all for the girls
[1:07:36] and all that well I'm so glad my mama
[1:07:39] taught me all that stuff well why still
[1:07:45] she does what she's supposed to do but
[1:07:47] that
[1:07:47] time she'd get tired I had a brother
[1:07:51] come to me and I was held in my house in
[1:07:53] South Carolina and I'm getting ready to
[1:07:54] get back to the word but I must say this
[1:07:57] cuz I'm not ashamed of the abilities
[1:07:59] that I have when it comes to my house
[1:08:02] right so anyway a brother come to my
[1:08:08] house and and he said and I'm gonna tell
[1:08:12] you where he's from but he said that's
[1:08:14] what's wrong with him fussing at me in

[1:08:18] American me and they don't know their
[1:08:20] position in the house something says
[1:08:23] tell him to get out
[1:08:24] I didn't yeah I held my peace until the
[1:08:32] Holy Ghost says but brother branham put
[1:08:35] on an apron at least I didn't have an
[1:08:36] apron on brother branham put on the
[1:08:39] apron and helped his wife wash dishes
[1:08:42] and I said brother brother Brown and put
[1:08:45] on the apron and helped his wife wash
[1:08:48] dishes so was he out of order too you

[1:11:38] things in my house that way your things

[1:11:55] something here to my my fair colored
[1:11:58] brothers my fair white brothers let me
[1:12:00] say this it is something about the black
[1:12:05] Americans and I'm a black American in
[1:12:07] the natural I'm not from this world
[1:12:11] but you know what I don't have to wear
[1:12:14] my pants down here no I ain't gonna do
[1:12:18] it I'm just saying hey I don't have to
[1:12:20] wear my pants down here I don't have to
[1:12:22] walk like a baby that needs changing I
[1:12:28] don't have to do all of that to prove
[1:12:30] that I'm black how many y'all know I'm
[1:12:32] black okay is there any way I can hide
[1:12:35] it no brother I'm like you believe me
[1:12:45] y'all understand what I'm saying there
[1:12:48] are certain things you don't have to do
[1:12:50] nothing to prove you don't have to prove
[1:12:52] what is this it all men it's the truth
[1:12:55] you better believe what I'm saying my
[1:12:57] son one of my sons they this you know
[1:13:00] because he doesn't wear his pants down
[1:13:02] he speak properly you know he says he's
[1:13:06] a Christian and there are people a girls
[1:13:09] who didn't loan him you know what they
[1:13:12] said y'all I hope nobody get offended
[1:13:14] they say you act too white you know if
[1:13:20] that's insanity
[1:13:23] so now you telling me because I dress
[1:13:26] properly I wear my clothes properly
[1:13:28] that's the attribute of being white Oh
[1:13:32] God have mercy and I make myself clear I
[1:13:35] hope I'm not making nobody feel
[1:13:37] uncomfortable but my point is this
[1:13:41] yo outer garments is not gonna prove who
[1:13:44] you are it's what's in the heart and if
[1:13:49] a person don't want to be with you
[1:13:51] because I had a note on there but if a
[1:13:53] person don't want to be with you because
[1:13:54] you are a Christian you don't know you
[1:13:58] don't break you let them reject you
[1:14:01] because when you are rejected God is
[1:14:05] waiting for fellowship then Jesus came
[1:14:18] y'all still
[1:14:19] even white I had a brother tell me say
[1:14:25] brother
[1:14:26] you're a white man and a black man body
[1:14:28] I said don't say that that's an insult
[1:14:31] to me
[1:14:32] don't get me wrong what are you trying
[1:14:36] to tell me when you say that you
[1:14:43] understand me hope y'all don't think
[1:14:45] that nobody in here think I'm like that
[1:14:47] cuz that ain't me I'm just me
[1:14:49] I couldn't be wide if I wanted to be
[1:14:54] like my white brothers couldn't be black
[1:14:56] if they wanted to be I don't care if
[1:14:58] they do one of these numbers here you
[1:15:01] know some people can do their hair and
[1:15:03] get an afro that don't make you the seed
[1:15:08] you are a white man ought to be proud to
[1:15:12] be a white man and a black man ought to
[1:15:14] be proud to be a black man ah grateful
[1:15:17] for what God has made you I think if we
[1:15:21] could stop listening to the devil we can
[1:15:23] have the black white yellow and brown
[1:15:24] and everybody else get together but he
[1:15:26] knows if we get together the way we
[1:15:28] ought to Jesus will come a millennium of
[1:15:31] beyond I love God's variety now I don't
[1:15:39] know why I said all of that but I love
[1:15:44] people that's all now we're going to
[1:15:47] move into our another phase of our
[1:15:48] service we're gonna get into our
[1:15:52] communion you love the Lord everybody at
[1:15:57] rest peace so for the Troy as how many
[1:16:09] I'll miss brother Troy if it was all
[1:16:15] hard on you when I leave like it was on
[1:16:17] me that's terrible I missed you we are
[1:16:26] I'm by God's grace that we must realize
[1:16:29] and recognize folks we you know the
[1:16:30] Bible said they'll know that you are my
[1:16:32] disciples because of the love that you
[1:16:34] have one toward another you cannot even
[1:16:37] be the disciple of God without divine
[1:16:39] love for each other
[1:16:42] willing to die for each other right and
[1:16:45] you and I y'all don't even know what
[1:16:47] just that just Monday I'm not gonna go
[1:16:50] through the whole ordeal but I had
[1:16:52] policeman comes to my house one was good
[1:16:55] and what was bad and the one policeman
[1:16:58] tried to get he tried to start something
[1:17:01] folks he looked like he wanted right
[1:17:04] brother Jasper just was my witness the
[1:17:08] man wanted to physically harm me but
[1:17:10] because I was fasting and praying the
[1:17:16] Lord kept me and in this incident he was
[1:17:25] he instead of protecting me coming to my
[1:17:27] house to protect me he protect the man
[1:17:30] who was a villain
[1:17:32] the man who was a felony that fella you
[1:17:36] know what I'm saying it was so awkward
[1:17:39] and it was only when we set back and
[1:17:43] start thinking about all of the little
[1:17:44] things that took place because of this
[1:17:47] situation and I wanted to go see what
[1:17:49] the man look like because I had never
[1:17:51] seen him before and he says you better
[1:17:54] not go out there and start no trouble
[1:17:55] you know he raised his voice you may not
[1:17:57] have such exactly like that but at the
[1:17:59] same time it just it was the funniest
[1:18:04] thing and let me tell you all something
[1:18:07] people of God just like I've told my
[1:18:10] children but my love for everybody in
[1:18:13] here is unconditionally I don't have a
[1:18:16] conditional love God got rid of that I'm
[1:18:21] gonna love you if you good and I'm gonna
[1:18:23] love you if you bad you make mistakes
[1:18:27] I'm still gonna love you you understand
[1:18:30] me if you mistreat me I'm gonna love you
[1:18:34] it doesn't matter what you do my love is
[1:18:37] not hinging upon your actions
[1:18:39] toward me and that's the way it ought to
[1:18:43] be with the love that you have one for
[1:18:45] another it's not hindered Oh what they
[1:18:48] did me wrong and I don't love him no
[1:18:49] more well you never loved him in the
[1:18:51] first place
[1:18:51] real love is eternal it has no beginning
[1:18:54] nor ending did God personally know you
[1:18:58] the Bible said God so loved the world
[1:19:01] that He gave His only begotten Son huh
[1:19:05] in that while you was yet a sinner God
[1:19:08] died for you he wasn't doing anything to
[1:19:11] favor God's married but he loved you
[1:19:13] anyway
[1:19:15] and you got to love people who don't
[1:19:17] love you they those that despitefully
[1:19:21] use you do you harm and wrong you still
[1:19:23] got to love them
[1:19:24] hello and I don't mean say it with your
[1:19:28] mouth I mean say it with your actions
[1:19:30] because we had a sure example in our day
[1:19:33] brother Branham who had all those
[1:19:36] enemies and you never could tell the
[1:19:38] difference between his enemies and his
[1:19:40] friend
[1:19:41] it means mystery I have not heard of
[1:19:44] testimony as of yet where brother
[1:19:47] Branham mistreated anyone never and all
[1:19:53] the testimonies and if you ain't there
[1:19:56] yet you got to get there oh he was the
[1:20:00] wave sheaf meaning they were gonna come
[1:20:02] more of them let's hope we're more of
[1:20:05] we're the more ah let's stay brother toy
[1:20:11] come as I prepare
