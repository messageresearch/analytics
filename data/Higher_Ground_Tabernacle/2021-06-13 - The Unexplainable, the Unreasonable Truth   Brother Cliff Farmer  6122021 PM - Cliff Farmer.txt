that he can move the mountains out of the way he did that for the children of israel he opened a way where there was no way they walked with dry ground they could say our god [Music] keep me in the [Applause] [Music] keep [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] from [Music] my god is awesome he's awesome [Music] he is he is my god is also the savior of the whole world giver of salvation my god is awesome today i am forgiven this grace is why i'm living forever will reign my god is he awesome to you tonight he's awesome [Music] is [Music] amen he's an awesome god [Music] so you know when god does those things just makes me know that he's mindful makes us know we're in the right channel amen if we could let's just turn to the scripture joshua chapter 10 verse twelve joshua 10 and 12. then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he said in the sight of israel sun stands thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of azeroline allah and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies it it is not this written in the book of jasher so the son stood still in the midst of heaven and hastened not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that before it or after it that the lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the lord fought for israel eternally the unexplainable unreasonable truth [Music] and he said a paradox is something that's true but it's unexplainable and brother keith what made it stand out was not that the sun stood still but what made it stand out it wasn't so special that the sun just stood still and god was hearkening to a man's voice that's unreasonable that's unexplainable but it's the truth i think about abraham abraham god told abraham you're going to have the seed that would be uh numbered like the sands of the sea idea but abraham goes to the base of the mountain and he tells the man with him me and the lad are going to worship i see the picture of it back there he said i am the lad go to worship and i and the lad will return abraham [Music] god would raise him up that's unreasonable it's unexplainable but it's the truth so abraham ties isaac said he would walk out to preach those seals [Music] [Music] and god said i've honored your faith and behold the ram is in the tickets [Music] how can god create an animal it's unreasonable [Music] he said let's see whose god is is your sacrifice pray to your god [Music] and they began to pray and he said holler louder scream louder he said maybe he's on another hill too far to hear you and they pray louder they beat drums louder [Music] [Music] on the scene but it was not in that and when they could not bring the fire elijah said let me have a chance he said pour water on the fire [Music] he said pour buckets of water on the wood and the scripture says that the water ran down the altar scientifically impossible brother troy to light wood that is soaking wet [Music] it was it was soaked up it soaked up the water let's read first kings 18. hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou hast turned their heart back again that's all right first kings 18 37 all right i thank you for [Music] and the king said we're going to throw you in the fire he he told the soldiers that's you make the fire hotter seven times harder sit for before it's like in our age it's seven times hotter than it's ever been [Music] the fire is hotter the darkness is darker isaiah [Music] he said seven times harder it is set for pluto so hot that when they threw the young boys in the fire [Music] killed those that threw them in [Music] [Music] [Music] fire couldn't kill them [Applause] [Music] looks like the son [Music] it's unexplainable it's an explicit [Music] the way the devil has tormented [Music] in the midst of the fire um fire couldn't hurt him but when they walked out the only thing the fire had done was loosed [Music] [Music] in the [Music] [Music] [Music] he [Music] [Music] satan attacked our church our church was split in half he attacked our pastor through the devil came to destroy us [Music] [Music] [Applause] of bringing you victory you love the lord tonight mark 11 22. and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god jesus for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith [Music] whatsoever things he saith brother branham told us put your name in the scripture and whatsoever samuel d that whatsoever frank said frank d whatsoever put your name in the scripture when you pray [Music] saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he says what do you want what do you want from god just because every zombie start saying it [Music] start speaking we don't get from god [Music] because we don't ask from god but he said ask abandon me that's your joy may be full ask for your family and believe it [Music] and you will have it therefore i say unto you whatsoever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them amen what's your mountain he said if you believe the brother keith can you explain that see the world around us they can't accept the message because they can't explain it they can't accept the ring cloud because they can't explain it they can't explain the pillar of fire over brother branham's head [Music] [Music] [Music] but [Music] he said that's it's unexplainable but it's the truth john chapter 4 verse 3. john he left judea and departed again into galilee and he must needs go through samaria come in the one that turned water into wine the one that fed five thousand sometimes we put god in a box we think he can only move in this area [Music] why would god want to harlot [Music] [Music] [Music] so this woman was so [Music] one day she walks to the well [Music] and a man is sitting at the well [Music] imagine what she thought she's a harlot and there's a man waiting at the whale yeah [Music] but this man began to speak like she had never heard a man speak he told her she had five husbands and the whale and the seventh man elusive begin to discern the thought and the intent of the heart there were six church age messengers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] come see a man who told me all my pasts now watch this she always came to the well alone but what's in contact with jesus [Music] god [Music] but it's the truth he became smaller than a drop of blood he said he became a blood cell he said and then he wrapped that blood cell with his own blood [Music] it's scientifically impossible [Music] that a microscope would have to be used to pick him up and the scripture tells us that we are a part of him and when that blood cell was broken at calvary when [Music] [Music] it can't be uh explained by science science would tell us you're crazy but it's the truth anyway one time god needed a man he needed a church age messenger [Music] he needed an apostle to the start the work of the christian church what a great man so i'm sure god started looking in kingdoms no no he didn't look for royalty but god saw a man named saul walking down the road to damascus [Music] that killer of believers [Music] [Music] that man with letters in his hands [Music] and suddenly a light but they heard not the voice but i was reading the other day when brother branham was baptizing in 1933 and the voice spoke and said enough but she heard the voice the men with paul was saul saw the light but they didn't hear the voice many people saw the light but they didn't catch the voice he saw the light and they heard the voice let me tell you there's importance [Music] [Music] does that make any sense it makes no sense but it's not true does it make sense that god the jew would pick a a man named william branham with no uh no schooling third grade to bring his word god would pick a hillbilly [Music] no word for that is there god would pick a uh a popper or i don't know there's no word for it god would pick a poor man god didn't pick a king he didn't pick a president not a senator he didn't pick a prime minister but he picked a little poor boy raised up without shoes on his feet you know what else doesn't make sense and this is the greatest thing he picked you to hear it he picked me brother troy to hear it it wasn't because i was good was it because i was without sin but by his grace by his mercy [Music] went to an insane asylum there was a young girl in there she was in all kinds of sins she in our mind she's too far gone for god to reach her what brother branham said he said don't you desire to be married to marie and have babies on phone brother brandon was not looking at where she was he was not looking at what she had done he was looking at her desire there's a brother branham uh there's a sermon not a it's not really a sermon the interview with sister bruce it's recorded in brother branham's sermon sister bruce said brother branham i don't know if i'm saved or not [Music] god is not looking at how many failures you have what's your desire so brother branham in this institution he said what's [Music] [Music] [Music] but it's the truth [Music] he said in a few moments she raised her head tears running down her cheeks she looked me in the face she said brother something happened [Music] [Music] and a prostitute [Music] he said now [Music] god takes the worst [Music] [Music] brother branham tells a story about a woman in memphis brother brandon said he was on a plane to dallas according to his ticket but a woman got sincere with god brother said desperation reaches the throne it reaches the heart of god that woman got desperate she was in prayer for her son she begins to pray and the plane begins to shake they had to land the plane in memphis [Music] oh it's unreasonable sometimes it looks like when you pray god's not answering the prayers but the wheels are turning it's in motion so that she said at three o'clock in the morning [Music] he was asleep she stood by the gate it looked like that the promise wouldn't come but he said stand by the gate the scripture [Music] until seven o'clock just got sit there at seven o'clock she still believed but the promise hadn't come at seven o'clock brother branham gets up out of bed [Music] at eight o'clock i we though she was still standing by the gate and the prophet wasn't there but the prophet begins to walk and the voice says turn this way and then the voice says turn this way he looks up and he sees a lady he's working farmer and she said you know good morning parson bonjour pastor she said i saw you in a vision i knew you were coming i said where's my elijah and i saw a preacher brother said it this way he said can you imagine god stop that plane for that woman's prayer it's unreasonable it's [Music] [Music] did he tell his testimony did that tell his testimony okay my dad [Music] but he didn't believe in speaking in tongues being the evidence and he didn't believe in women preachers so someone that worked with him so there's a preacher coming to chicago that has funny ideas so they said he's a mind reader so brother branham is preaching in a large auditorium [Music] and my grandfather goes and he sits way in the back he said i don't want anyone he said i don't want anyone to be able to hear me or to see me i'm sorry i don't want anyone to be able to see me and he laid my dad up underneath the chairs he said i don't want this man to see him and know that he's crippled and he started praying he said god if this man is a prophet then let him call my name about my son and it only believed in 1961 [Music] he said you're praying about your son's feet he said your name's farmer he didn't know a farmer he said he's healed [Music] my dad [Music] [Music] the doctor said he would be on crutches the rest of his life but a couple years after brother branham prayed over him the coach [Music] [Music] thank god for his mercy would you stand with me tonight amen it might sound crazy might seem like there's no way but nothing is impossible do you have a need tonight say play something if you got a need just raise your hand to the lord maybe you pray you pray seems like no answer's coming he prayed for 21 days it looked like no help was coming [Music] but the word of the lord came to him and he said i heard you the first time you prayed god hears your prayers god sees your uplifted hands [Music] i don't [Music] [Music] lord maybe their hands are raised for a lost [Music] [Music] tonight we speak to the mountains [Music] we accept that you will move the mountain [Music] amen amen do you believe it tonight all things are possible [Music] all things are [Music] i believe all things [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] me all things are possible [Music] things are possible [Music] [Applause] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus because jesus
