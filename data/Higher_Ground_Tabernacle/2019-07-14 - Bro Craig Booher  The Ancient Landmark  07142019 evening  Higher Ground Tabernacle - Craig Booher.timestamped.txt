[0:00] Oh hear my humble cry and while another

[0:27] hey man do you love him tonight amen
[0:31] greetings in the precious name of Lord
[0:33] happy to be in the house of God my heart
[0:37] was warmed by the presence of the Lord
[0:38] this morning and just honored to be here
[0:43] brother Brooks you'd my daddy in the
[0:45] gospel and it ministers to me just being
[0:48] here just being with each and every one
[0:50] and seeing you standing after the years
[0:52] and he that endureth unto the end shall
[0:55] be saved and so we're just happy more
[0:58] than words can express to be a Christian
[1:01] and to be on the winning side and so we
[1:05] need strength from God we're dependent
[1:07] upon God and God is faithful so we get
[1:11] our strength from the word possessing
[1:14] the precious promises of the Scriptures
[1:15] and so tonight my voice is just a bit
[1:18] hoarse I would like to I'm not going to
[1:22] come down to a screeching halt but I
[1:24] would like to teach a little bit and I
[1:27] think it'll bless our hearts and help us
[1:29] as Christians and so my preaching can be
[1:33] or my teaching can be preaching teaching
[1:35] so you know how it is but I do desire
[1:39] the good Lord willing this is what's on
[1:40] my heart so if we could turn in our
[1:43] Bibles tonight to Deuteronomy chapter 19
[1:46] verse 14 just give me your patience just
[1:50] to uh to labor in the scriptures here
[1:54] just to get get a foundation going here
[1:57] bitter enemy chapter 19 verse 14 and I
[2:03] love the Word of God it's just something
[2:06] I can it never gets old
[2:07] I love the Word of God Deuteronomy
[2:10] chapter 19 verse 14 thou shalt not
[2:16] remove thy neighbor's landmark which
[2:19] they have old time have set in thine
[2:22] inheritance which thou shalt inherit in
[2:25] the land that the LORD thy God giveth
[2:27] thee to possess it and he says is a
[2:31] command now not to remove the ancient
[2:33] landmark proverbs chapter 22 verse 28 I
[2:37] don't want a blast nobody but can I get
[2:39] a little more back here
[2:40] proverbs chapter 22 verse 28 one verse
[2:49] remove not the ancient or the
[2:52] everlasting landmark which thy fathers
[2:56] have set now there are several
[2:59] scriptures that are very similar to this
[3:01] but in Deuteronomy he commands them do
[3:04] not move the ancient landmark and that
[3:07] in Proverbs he says remove not the
[3:10] everlasting landmark which your fathers
[3:13] have said so I want to preach tonight on
[3:16] the the ancient landmark let's bow our
[3:19] heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly
[3:22] Father we love you with all that is in
[3:24] us that's why we come Lord to the house
[3:26] of God we ask you to forgive us of all
[3:30] of our wrongdoings all of our unbelief
[3:32] all of our distractions of life we know
[3:35] Lord that there is mercy with you and
[3:37] grace with you your long-suffering Lord
[3:40] and your mercy is from everlasting to
[3:42] everlasting thank you Lord for such a
[3:45] covenant and a promise thank you Lord
[3:47] for your love to mankind
[3:49] help us Lord in the service we pray in
[3:52] Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you
[3:55] you can have your seats here Moses and
[3:59] Deuteronomy was giving instruction to
[4:02] the Joshua generation he was given
[4:05] instinct you for the rich he was giving
[4:07] instruction to the generation of
[4:10] overcomers the Prophet was giving
[4:12] instruction to them when you come into
[4:14] the land he was saying now you're gonna
[4:18] set boundaries and borders these are
[4:20] going to be landmarks to you
[4:22] and so when he sent Joshua into the land
[4:25] Joshua divides the land to the children
[4:28] of Israel and I want you to turn with me
[4:31] to Joshua chapter 18 as we just get
[4:33] moving here Joshua chapter 18 verse 1
[4:37] and I want to read down through this
[4:41] portion of Scripture Joshua chapter 18
[4:44] verse 1 and the whole congregation of
[4:49] the children of Israel assembled
[4:51] together at Shiloh and set up the
[4:54] a burn Akal of the congregation there
[4:56] and the land was subdued before them and
[4:59] there they remained among the children
[5:01] of Israel seven tribes which should not
[5:04] receive their inheritance joshua said
[5:07] unto the children of israel how long are
[5:09] you slack to go possess the land which
[5:12] the Lord your God your the Lord God of
[5:14] your father's have given you give out
[5:17] from among you three men for each tribe
[5:20] and I will send them and they shall rise
[5:22] and go through the land to describe it
[5:25] which means to survey it according to
[5:28] the inheritance of them and they shall
[5:30] come again unto me and they shall divide
[5:33] it into seven parts Judah shall abide in
[5:36] the coasts on the south and the house of
[5:39] Joseph shall abide on their coasts on
[5:41] the north you shall therefore survey it
[5:44] describe it survey it the land into
[5:46] seven parts and bring the description
[5:49] hither to me that I may cast lots for
[5:52] you before the Lord your God but the
[5:55] Levites shall have no part among you for
[5:57] your priesthood of the Lord I'm sorry
[6:00] for the priesthood of the Lord is their
[6:02] inheritance and GAD and Reuben and the
[6:05] half tribe of Manasseh shall receive
[6:08] their inheritance beyond the Jordan on
[6:09] the east which Moses the servant of the
[6:12] Lord gave them and the men arose and
[6:15] went went away and Joshua charged them
[6:18] and they they went to describe or survey
[6:22] the land saying go walk through the land
[6:24] and describe it or survey it and come
[6:27] again unto me that I may cast Lots
[6:29] before the Lord in Shiloh and the men
[6:32] went and passed through the land and
[6:34] surveyed it by cities into seven parts
[6:37] in a book and came again to Joshua to
[6:40] the hosts of Shiloh and Joshua cast Lots
[6:43] before them in Shiloh before the Lord
[6:45] and their Joshua divided the land unto
[6:48] the children of Israel according to
[6:51] their division so after they surveyed
[6:54] the land they came before the Joshua
[6:57] Joshua now goes before the Ark of the
[7:00] Covenant which was in Shiloh and he cast
[7:03] lots and when he cast these Lots this
[7:06] was said
[7:07] the borders of the inheritance of Israel
[7:10] and God had set its boundaries God had
[7:14] set its parameters God had set its
[7:17] limitations and their inheritance was
[7:20] within these boundaries outside of these
[7:23] boundaries there is no inheritance
[7:26] inside these boundaries they could be
[7:29] blessed and God would only bless Israel
[7:33] in that Promised Land within the
[7:36] perimeters that God had set then they
[7:39] could be blessed their families would be
[7:41] blessed their lives would be blessed
[7:44] brother Branham said thus saith the Lord
[7:47] God will never bless us until we come
[7:50] within the boundaries of our blessing
[7:52] which is the Word of God that is our
[7:55] promised land then he said you will not
[7:57] sell the land forever because the land
[8:00] is mine I give it to you by the grace of
[8:03] God and so Benjamin had his had his
[8:08] portion of inheritance and God set the
[8:11] boundaries of that inheritance you'll
[8:13] find that the tribes of Israel every one
[8:16] of them had a portion that God had given
[8:18] them now notice this God there were
[8:22] certain landmarks that marked the
[8:25] boundaries of each of the tribes of
[8:27] Israel
[8:28] and there was forests there was
[8:31] mountains there was rivers there was
[8:33] gorgeous there were natural landmarks
[8:36] ever sees there was lakes and these
[8:39] marked natural landmarks that naturally
[8:42] set boundaries for the inheritance of
[8:47] the children of Israel but then there
[8:49] were man-made boundaries such as stone
[8:52] fences such as rocks and heaps of stones
[8:56] and stakes these were property lines and
[9:00] these these were landmarks and a
[9:03] landmark is is to set the territory or
[9:08] the limits or the boundaries that a
[9:12] territory might be preserved so the only
[9:16] way that they would know their
[9:18] inheritance is to know the boundaries or
[9:20] the land
[9:21] ARC's that God had set up for them and
[9:24] so notice now the landmark if if it was
[9:29] contended if brother Brooks had a
[9:33] portion and I had a portion and I I can
[9:37] test his portion and say it's mine and
[9:39] he says it's his it would be the
[9:42] landmark that would stand as a witness
[9:45] of whose land it was because the
[9:49] landmark is not going to change the
[9:52] landmark is a territorial absolute
[9:55] meaning that it will always be there in
[9:58] all it will never change can you say men
[10:01] that's why the ancient landmarks
[10:04] they were unchanging landmarks it had
[10:08] wonderful so what it would do was it
[10:12] would give you assurance of your
[10:13] position you would know by the landmark
[10:17] whether you're in the land or out of the
[10:20] land on gods territory or on the devil's
[10:24] territory you would know by the landmark
[10:27] of where you stood in the eyesight of
[10:31] God can you say men and geographically
[10:35] speaking you could know your position
[10:37] you could know whether you're in the
[10:39] wilderness or whether you're in the
[10:41] promised land I'm ready to meet Christ
[10:43] er I'm not ready to meet Christ I'm a
[10:45] child of God or I'm not a child of God
[10:48] so one could actually orient oneself as
[10:52] well because the landmark is a reference
[10:55] point if seamen would travel the coast
[10:59] they would look for high mountain peaks
[11:01] and that would be a landmark so they
[11:04] could orient themselves and know where
[11:06] they were can you say Amen and they can
[11:09] look for navigation at high point sir
[11:12] lighthouses or you know different things
[11:14] like that so you can align with your
[11:17] position and you can know I'm going in a
[11:20] safe direction it's just like the North
[11:23] Star but the random set out on the Seas
[11:26] if you can't see the stars you might get
[11:29] lost on a raging sea but if the cards
[11:32] move back
[11:33] and you can see the North Star you can
[11:35] know where you are and where you need to
[11:38] go so it works as a compass it works is
[11:42] as something to if you're disoriented
[11:45] you can did a reference point and come
[11:48] back to your god-given position you know
[11:52] brother Branham said that being lost is
[11:54] a terrible condition he said that lost
[11:57] men he had encountered men that had got
[12:00] lost in the woods he said they take on a
[12:02] fever and he said they would actually
[12:04] lose their minds he'd saw a young man
[12:06] that was lost for three days he went
[12:09] completely out of his mind in panic and
[12:11] when they saw him he didn't even
[12:13] recognize his own brother and he was
[12:15] clone at him like an animal he said it
[12:17] was the most pitiful thing that he ever
[12:19] saw and he said when a man is lost from
[12:23] God he is in that same state he said he
[12:26] don't know where he's at he's bewildered
[12:29] he's confused
[12:31] he's absolutely lost his loss can be and
[12:34] he said a church when they leave the
[12:37] Bible can be lost like that disorient
[12:42] means to lose your sense of direction so
[12:45] outside of the borders of God's word we
[12:49] are absolutely lost there's no salvation
[12:54] outside of God's borders and many
[12:56] Christians are spiritually disoriented
[12:59] they don't know they're standing they
[13:03] don't know their position they don't
[13:05] know who they are in Christ brother Adam
[13:09] talked about this in spiritual amnesia
[13:11] he said you know there were boys had
[13:13] fought in the early wars before the
[13:16] modern you know the modern organization
[13:19] of armies and so forth and he said that
[13:22] men would get shell-shocked from the
[13:24] battle you've heard the story and he
[13:26] said because people he'll bombs are
[13:29] going off people were losing arms they
[13:31] were losing their buddies next to them
[13:32] and most of them are you know just 18 19
[13:35] children and so they go into shell shock
[13:38] where they don't know who they are
[13:40] they don't know where they come from
[13:42] they don't know who their family is they
[13:45] don't know where they're going they come
[13:47] into
[13:47] state of amnesia there lost and brother
[13:50] branham said that they would gather
[13:52] family members and have a group of boys
[13:55] who lost their identity they would
[13:57] gather him up and try to call family in
[14:00] and they would look through and and they
[14:01] would claim their loved ones but if they
[14:04] were not claimed and were not been able
[14:06] to identify who they were they would put
[14:09] him on a train and send him to the
[14:11] sanitarium and brother Branham said that
[14:13] these men were going down the train
[14:15] track and it was time to stop so they
[14:18] can stretch their legs and he said when
[14:20] the soldiers walked out there milling
[14:22] around with a blank look on their face
[14:25] heading to the sanitarium and he said
[14:28] but one young soldier got to looking at
[14:31] a water tower and he said he rubbed his
[14:33] eyes and he just kept looking and there
[14:36] was a guard watching him and he said he
[14:39] rubbed his face and he looked around and
[14:42] he didn't have the blank stare all the
[14:44] sudden he started to look like he was
[14:46] coming to himself and he said he started
[14:49] walking towards a certain path and he
[14:52] said instead of stopping him the guard
[14:54] just followed him and he said he went
[14:56] around the bend through a little woods
[14:58] and up over the hill and he said right
[15:01] there was a cabin and there was an old
[15:04] man on the cabin and the old man stands
[15:07] up as the young soldier is walking to
[15:10] the house and he said my son my son I
[15:13] knew you had returned when he saw the
[15:17] landmark it gave him the census it
[15:21] brought him back it oriented him it made
[15:25] gave him a position it brought him back
[15:28] to know who he was and where he was
[15:32] going and brother branham said you
[15:36] Christian soldiers look back to the
[15:39] world of God he said come back to
[15:42] yourselves can you say Amen notice this
[15:47] we look at the ancient landmark your
[15:51] faith has got to have a resting place
[15:54] brother Branham said this church has got
[15:56] to get back to the Pentecostal landmark
[15:59] back to the Word of God again back to
[16:03] the power of God again back to the blood
[16:05] of Jesus that cleanses all sins because
[16:09] Calvary is our landmark you know Jesus
[16:14] thundered it is finished when he hung on
[16:19] the cross and those were his last words
[16:21] it is finished what he accomplished at
[16:26] Calvary the devil can never erase and I
[16:30] really believe that many lack faith in
[16:33] what was really accomplished that day at
[16:36] Calvary he thundered it is finished now
[16:40] when he said it was finished he finished
[16:43] it for us he finished it for the world
[16:46] sin question was settled at Calvary
[16:50] every redemptive blessing that there is
[16:53] goes back to the ancient landmark divine
[16:57] healing came from Calvary healing
[17:01] salvation from Calvary everything Adam
[17:05] lost that day at Calvary did you know
[17:10] that every sinner in the world is saved
[17:13] right now that these are quotes that
[17:17] brother branham said every sinner on the
[17:20] face of the earth that has breath in
[17:22] their young lungs right now is saved
[17:25] every human being on earth is saved
[17:28] right now for the Menem said he died to
[17:32] save the human race
[17:33] he said now if you die not accepting it
[17:36] then you're condemned as a sinner
[17:39] because it's a free gift to all men
[17:43] don't you say am i predestinated or am I
[17:46] not predestinated you're already saved
[17:49] but he predestinate you by foreknowledge
[17:52] knowing whether you'll walk in the ark
[17:54] early walk away from the ark so you make
[17:59] the decision whether you're saved or not
[18:02] every human being was saved at Calvary
[18:07] but if you don't accept this grace
[18:09] you're as lost
[18:12] loss can be Calvary included.you Calvary
[18:16] included me the devil can never change
[18:19] it when he said it is finished he
[18:23] finished it for you he finished it for
[18:25] you he finished it for you he finished
[18:28] it for us that dead Calvary the devil
[18:33] did in your mind am i predestinated or
[18:36] am I not
[18:36] he opened the way how many believe that
[18:39] God so loved the world the Bible says in
[18:44] Titus 2:11 for the grace of God brings
[18:47] salvation that brings salvation has
[18:50] appeared to all men can you say all men
[18:54] that means seed and non seed it's
[19:01] exactly right
[19:02] you said Nancy can serpent seed be saved
[19:06] he died to save them remember Cain he
[19:10] said if you do well I'll reward you if
[19:14] you do what your brother does I will
[19:16] receive you Jesus God was not lying no
[19:21] no no he offered Cain and opportunity
[19:25] and he said in the token that the blood
[19:28] of Abel the justice of Abel it condemned
[19:31] Cain but the blood of Jesus speaketh
[19:34] better than that of Abel he said the
[19:36] blood of Abel could not forgive Cain but
[19:39] the blood of Jesus can and it's crying
[19:43] it cries out forgiveness if he'll accept
[19:46] it by grace are you saved
[19:51] Calvary is an ancient landmark and by
[19:55] Calvary you can know your position in
[19:57] Christ do you believe that how many said
[20:01] lord I want to know where I'm standing
[20:03] you'll look back to Calvary that's the
[20:06] only way you'll know your position
[20:08] you'll know who you are but we've got to
[20:11] know the landmarks because God has set
[20:15] these landmarks do you believe that
[20:17] Deuteronomy 27 verse 17 let's turn there
[20:22] Deuteronomy
[20:24] chapter 27 verse 17 I'll try not to hold
[20:27] you long just pay real close attention
[20:29] here we want to give the devil real
[20:34] black eye tonight Deuteronomy 27 so how
[20:40] can Satan reverse what Jesus
[20:42] accomplished at Calvary there's no
[20:45] reason why anybody should be lost it's
[20:48] their own unbelief it's all on us not on
[20:50] God he did everything he could
[20:53] 27:17 curse it is he that removes his
[20:57] neighbor's landmark and all the people
[21:00] shall say Amen when men removed the
[21:04] boundaries that God have sent in the
[21:06] Word of God he is cursed if an angel
[21:09] preach anything else than what Paul
[21:12] preached his curse churches are cursed
[21:15] when they add their Creed's and take
[21:17] away the word of the Lord and many our
[21:20] churches have tried to remove the
[21:22] landmarks to enlarge their borders to
[21:25] enlarge the borders of membership so
[21:29] they compromise the Word of God to try
[21:31] to enlarge their popularity and they
[21:34] compromise the Word of God they've tried
[21:37] to remove scriptures and tried to change
[21:39] it and so forth but they come under the
[21:42] curse of God when they do it the
[21:46] Antichrist tried to remove the ancient
[21:49] landmarks back in the Ephesus age and
[21:51] down through the Dark Ages and down
[21:54] through the ages 40,000 denominations
[21:57] were established because every one of
[21:59] them redefined God's boundaries every
[22:04] one of them every one of them had a
[22:06] definition of the boundaries and
[22:08] contested the boundaries of God's Word
[22:11] you love the Lord and the church has
[22:15] become a wilderness of dark false
[22:17] doctrine it has become a wilderness
[22:20] where people are going from church to
[22:23] church
[22:23] wandering it is lost
[22:25] can be because they have removed the
[22:29] ancient landmark of grace they have made
[22:32] it legalism they have said if you come
[22:35] to our church or if you do this and they
[22:38] put the people under bondage because
[22:40] they had removed the truth of grace from
[22:43] the church men have tried to rule God's
[22:47] church and instead of God and Satan
[22:49] knows if he can remove the landmark then
[22:53] the church is disoriented they're
[22:55] bewildered they're confused you know
[22:59] brother Branham said this man said this
[23:01] I want you to listen very closely he
[23:03] said brother Branham I have lived many
[23:05] years in sin until I found the Lord
[23:08] brother Branham I have sinned again and
[23:11] I'm not worthy to come before you in
[23:13] this holy place tell me if I can be
[23:16] restored again listen to the condition
[23:19] this man is disoriented this man is in a
[23:22] bad shape listen to brother branham's
[23:25] responds you have not sinned friend so
[23:29] far in God that you can't be restored if
[23:33] you send so far that you could not be
[23:36] restored
[23:37] you would not to want to be restored but
[23:40] as long as there something dealing in
[23:42] your heart you're in the line of
[23:45] restoration guilty of the least his
[23:48] guilty of the whole he said I have
[23:50] sinned every day and do things I don't
[23:53] want to do and he said sister will you
[23:56] lay hands on me and free me dear sister
[23:59] dear brother I'd lay hands on you but it
[24:02] would never free you what would free you
[24:05] is to understand you are already free
[24:08] you're already untied you don't have to
[24:12] worry about being free you're already
[24:15] free don't be entangled again in the
[24:18] yoke of bondage Christ set you free I
[24:24] could do that but it would not set you
[24:27] free until you accept what God has done
[24:32] just say Lord by faith I believe it I
[24:35] confess my
[24:36] yNN's and he said there you get the
[24:39] freedom and justification I've sinned
[24:41] I've done wrong I've fallen I'm dead
[24:44] wrong is there a chance for me to be
[24:47] whole again
[24:47] absolutely the minutes you desire it
[24:51] it shows God dropped the lifeline down
[24:54] to pick you up just rise up on the
[24:58] lifeline of faith and prayer and move
[25:01] right on up with the Eagles flop it away
[25:06] see brother Branham did not show a
[25:08] vision he pointed him back to Calvary
[25:11] back to the Word of God where Jesus said
[25:15] it is finished
[25:16] [Music]
[25:17] deliverance can only be found within the
[25:20] borders of the promised land can you say
[25:24] man you know one time you know brother
[25:27] Branham told the story of how he got he
[25:30] took me to on her on their honeymoon
[25:35] yeah thank you
[25:37] I think up towards to New Hampshire and
[25:39] and they had to stay in a lean-to for
[25:42] the night until the next morning when
[25:44] the man would open up the kademan you
[25:46] know and brother branham's a hero any
[25:48] man that can get his wife to go on a
[25:50] hunting trip that is phenomenal so we
[25:56] all just sit back and admire it say God
[25:58] just blessed to serve it so anyway
[26:01] brother Branham leaves me to meet it
[26:03] knows nothing about the woods he leaves
[26:05] her there with little Billy Paul he said
[26:07] I'll be back by 12:00 moon and he took
[26:09] off into his playground great Tall
[26:13] Timbers running through the woods in the
[26:16] mountains free from everything he's
[26:19] going through he's watching for animals
[26:21] and he's hunting and he was born to do
[26:23] this something about being free we were
[26:28] meant to be free God would love if we
[26:30] would come into church like that just
[26:33] come in I was made to be here
[26:35] explore God's promises enjoy God's
[26:38] promises just love God's promises walk
[26:43] the promised land so he's out hunting
[26:47] enjoying himself like a kid on a
[26:49] playground
[26:50] and he sees a big deer and he said
[26:52] that's what we need to shot it he hung
[26:54] it out and he said all the sudden the
[26:56] trees the winds begin to shift it at
[26:59] circuits and the trees begin to move
[27:03] snow started to come in and fog begin to
[27:06] settle brother Branham said oh I better
[27:08] get back to meet her he said it's
[27:11] getting late so he takes off then about
[27:15] a half hour something looks strange and
[27:17] he sees the deer that was hung in
[27:24] confidence because he was a woodsman he
[27:26] said I must have gotten mixed around he
[27:28] took off again
[27:29] and all of a sudden he's a little
[27:32] concerned because he comes right back
[27:34] around again now he's feeling a little
[27:37] bewildered and he said alright bill okay
[27:42] I just wasn't paying attention
[27:44] so he tried it a third time in the third
[27:46] time he got real sober because he said I
[27:50] know I'm on the deathlok the indians
[27:52] called it the death walk when a person
[27:54] gets a loss they go in circles and and
[27:57] we know we've seen it many times through
[27:59] the years drugs around and around and
[28:02] around sin around and around and around
[28:04] just like Sampson around and around and
[28:06] around and he said I realized that he
[28:10] said so I tried to bluff it he said it's
[28:13] getting late and he starts worrying
[28:15] about meda and he thinks she's gonna go
[28:18] frantic if an animal screams it's cold
[28:21] they'll freeze she's probably once
[28:23] worried to death and the devil started
[28:25] getting in his mind and he said come on
[28:27] bill you're not lost you're too good to
[28:30] be lost
[28:31] come on get ahold of yourself he said I
[28:33] was only bluffing we don't want to come
[28:36] up to the rapture bluffing we got to
[28:39] make sure that we know our position and
[28:42] he said he heard a voice way off I'm an
[28:46] ever-present help in the time of trouble
[28:50] you know we get so frantic about our
[28:53] problems and our mistakes but it's those
[28:55] times God wants to reveal himself and
[28:57] show himself strong and I love this
[29:00] because brother Branham was so real that
[29:02] he just like you
[29:04] and I would I'm hearing things as much
[29:06] as he talked to the angel as much as he
[29:09] experienced the supernatural he said oh
[29:11] I must be hearing things and he said
[29:14] come on they'll get next to yourself and
[29:16] that he hears I'm an ever-present help
[29:18] in the time of trouble and then he said
[29:23] he realized it was him and he said Lord
[29:26] forgive me took off his hat said Lord
[29:29] I'm sorry I'm his lost his loss can be
[29:34] and I'm sorry this proud creature I
[29:38] can't do nothing
[29:39] myself forgive me Lord if you'll get let
[29:43] me get back to my wife and babies don't
[29:45] let them die because of me
[29:46] let me get back to him Lord I'm in
[29:48] trouble in Jesus name Amen
[29:51] he said now he was looking for hurricane
[29:54] Mountain and he couldn't find it and he
[29:57] said now because of the fall get set in
[29:59] he said I could find no sign to get
[30:01] oriented and so hurricane Mountain was
[30:05] the landmark that would have give him
[30:08] his orientation so he said now I believe
[30:11] this is the way to hurricane Mountain
[30:13] and I'm gonna walk there just as
[30:15] speedline as I can and he said I started
[30:18] to walk and a hand went like this and he
[30:22] said when I turned God put a hole
[30:24] through the fog and there was hurricane
[30:27] Mountain he said I was walking in the
[30:30] opposite direction
[30:31] portes Canada and he said when he did it
[30:35] I said thank you Lord and it closed back
[30:38] up and he said now it was getting dark
[30:41] but he already got his bearings and he
[30:44] said as long as I walked that way he
[30:48] said I know that I'll be fine and he
[30:50] said it was freezing and snow and sleet
[30:53] was coming in and he knew he put a line
[30:55] up that spring it was a telephone line
[30:58] down to the cabin he said now I've got
[31:01] to hold my hands up in order to detach
[31:04] head line and he said so he was walking
[31:06] it was five miles
[31:08] it was dark and he said the winds was
[31:10] blowing his hands were freezing he had
[31:12] pulled him down and he said he would
[31:14] just keep holding him up but whatever he
[31:17] did he let nothing get him off course
[31:19] when you catch a vision of Calvary don't
[31:23] let nothin take you off course raise
[31:25] your hands and walk towards Calvary he
[31:29] would fall and scrape his knees and
[31:31] animals would jump up in front of him
[31:33] and he said god help your servant give
[31:36] mercy to your servant and he walked like
[31:39] that for five miles he said he would
[31:41] grab something his heart would powder
[31:44] but it was just a branch he would keep
[31:47] walking and just keep walking and he
[31:50] said finally he felt the line and he
[31:54] said when he grabbed the line he knew Oh
[31:56] God
[31:58] right at the end of this line is
[32:01] everything that I hold dear in life
[32:04] brother Branham said when we strike the
[32:06] line of the Holy Ghost you know if you
[32:10] don't let go just hold on God justified
[32:14] you he the justifies will glorify and
[32:18] right at the end of this line when we
[32:20] break into that dimension you'll see
[32:23] shining angel our precious brother and
[32:26] they'll embrace and love and you will
[32:28] enter into immortality right at the end
[32:32] of this line just a breath away just a
[32:35] dimension away it's right there brother
[32:38] Branham said he was ten feet away from
[32:40] it glory God shows him his bearings by a
[32:46] landmark he had to walk to the darkness
[32:49] we're gonna have trials but as long as
[32:53] you keep your course you will never fail
[32:56] how wonderful do you love the Lord God
[33:00] moved back the fog and so is God did it
[33:03] in this age after 2,000 years of dark
[33:06] ages he has moved back the fog and we
[33:09] have seen Calvary for what it means we
[33:11] have seen the Word of God for what it
[33:13] means we've seen Pentecost for what it
[33:16] means it may look like the Prophet went
[33:18] off the scene and it got dark again
[33:21] we have found our course just keep
[33:23] marching keep walking keep fighting keep
[33:27] wrestling because we have got our
[33:29] bearings in this age when a Christian
[33:34] gets outside the boundaries of the word
[33:37] he is lost remember Cain went out of the
[33:42] presence of the Lord and the Bible said
[33:45] he dwelt in the Land of Nod which meant
[33:47] wandering and that's what he became a
[33:49] wander because he left the word he
[33:52] became a wander because he left the
[33:54] presence of God that's like a lot of
[33:56] bewildered Christians they leave the
[33:59] word of God and they find themselves in
[34:01] a terrible situation I want to give you
[34:04] another example it's incredible and I
[34:07] really want to take my time and I hope
[34:09] that God will write his word upon your
[34:12] hearts as I as I read these examples
[34:14] here's a woman in questions and answers
[34:17] 1964 and I want you to hear this as
[34:20] she's coming to brother Branham for help
[34:22] she said brother Branham what shall we
[34:24] do something has settled over me and I
[34:29] cannot break through
[34:30] last fall I dreamed I was lost in whites
[34:34] and it was getting dark I can't find my
[34:37] way and this dream has stayed with me
[34:41] since last fall and I'm groping in
[34:43] darkness my son Irvin and his wife were
[34:47] included in my dream and now they also
[34:49] are in darkness we are desperate we are
[34:53] in desperation I believe God will show
[34:56] you what is in our hearts if we're wrong
[34:58] and sinning tell us we want to be right
[35:01] isn't that a horrible situation to be in
[35:03] listen to brother branham's responds now
[35:06] this is brother Branham I don't know the
[35:07] lady but I feel if you're here lady
[35:10] that here is your trouble you have let
[35:13] something happen to you that made you
[35:15] nervous being in White Sands represent
[35:19] represents purity and righteousness
[35:21] you're just letting the devil put one
[35:25] over on you your dream proves that
[35:28] there's nothing wrong you're only
[35:31] nervous and by doing this
[35:35] and thinking this you're making the rest
[35:38] of the family nervous stop doing it and
[35:41] claim your god-given rights your dream
[35:45] proves by the interpretation that you're
[35:48] in white sand everything is all right
[35:51] you're only nervous now try each one of
[35:56] you children to help your mama your papa
[35:58] try to help your children don't let that
[36:01] gloomy unbelieving spirit get around you
[36:05] you are Christians born of the Spirit of
[36:09] God you're the salt of the earth there
[36:11] Benny praise if there be any any virtue
[36:14] think on these things don't you think
[36:17] about the wrong thing now now notice
[36:22] brother Branham when he's dealing with
[36:24] this of course having a gift he saw the
[36:27] dream he said oh no no you're in wipes
[36:29] and nothing is wrong how many Christians
[36:34] in message churches are suffering
[36:37] nervous conditions when there's nothing
[36:39] wrong see the devil can play mind games
[36:44] if you will leave the word now she went
[36:48] out of the word to believe the devil's
[36:49] lie where the venom called her back to
[36:52] the boundaries of the word the ancient
[36:54] landmark and it set her free see how
[36:58] powerful the word is I want to give you
[37:00] another one brother Branham said this
[37:02] now that he said a man came to me not
[37:04] long ago said he had an old junk truck
[37:08] he said I was a rich man two years ago
[37:10] but I sold my car lot and I gave
[37:12] everything I had to ministers he said I
[37:15] went to a Billy Graham revival he said I
[37:18] wanted to find peace in my soul he said
[37:20] you know his wife his wife a couple
[37:23] years back went to a Pentecostal church
[37:25] and got the spirits and he said that he
[37:29] said that he was happy for her and she
[37:31] said why don't you come and he said I'm
[37:34] not the religious type but I'll supply
[37:36] for you and I'll give you money to give
[37:38] to your church he said I was never a
[37:40] church-going man and he said but then he
[37:43] said one day he said I sold
[37:48] are and he said I walked into the office
[37:51] and I thought did I give those keys to
[37:53] the woman that I sold the car to and
[37:55] he's I reached in the pocket of my coat
[37:57] and I pulled out a paper where will you
[37:59] spend eternity and he said I looked at
[38:03] that he said I put it down he said and
[38:08] all sudden something was happening he
[38:11] said I picked it up where would you
[38:14] spend eternity it got something was
[38:18] happening on the inside he said it
[38:19] bothered him so bad he called a worker
[38:21] and said take it the rest of them I'm
[38:24] going home he's and it's hard he said
[38:25] I've got to settle this
[38:27] where will I spend eternity he was about
[38:29] 40 or so he said so I I went home and I
[38:33] prayed he said so I went to a Billy
[38:36] Graham meeting and he said when I went
[38:38] to the milling Graham meeting he said
[38:40] now every one of you that want to
[38:41] receive Christ he said why don't you
[38:44] raise your hands up and he said and
[38:46] accept him and he told me it was over he
[38:49] said but it wasn't over and he said so I
[38:52] went to the Methodists and the Free
[38:54] Methodist said if you get sanctified
[38:56] enough to shout then it all be over and
[38:59] he said I got sanctified enough to shout
[39:01] and he said but it wasn't over and he
[39:04] said so I went to the Pentecostals and
[39:07] he said and they told me if I would
[39:09] speak in tongues and he said real
[39:11] faithful men went into the room and
[39:13] stayed with me until I spoke in tongues
[39:15] he said but it didn't settle it in my
[39:18] heart he said brother Branham I'm I'm in
[39:21] a terrible place he said now he said I
[39:25] went to the full gospel businessman I
[39:28] think it was or the voice of healing or
[39:30] something in error in Louisiana and he
[39:32] said they told me that I had crossed the
[39:34] line and that the only one that could
[39:37] help me was you that you're a prophet of
[39:39] God and he said so I come because I'm in
[39:42] a terrible place and I want to know you
[39:45] know what what should i do from here and
[39:49] and so where the random takes this man
[39:53] and he tells him now
[39:55] those people pointed you he said they
[39:58] were right and they were wrong
[40:01] he said every one of them Billy Graham
[40:04] the Methodists and the Pentecostals
[40:06] pointed you to the attributes of Christ
[40:09] he said but to receive Christ is to
[40:13] receive the person of the Lord Jesus and
[40:16] brother Branham said and you have
[40:18] already done that when you were going
[40:23] down the road hating religion knowing no
[40:26] religion at all you saw that sign and
[40:29] something turned you around and in two
[40:32] years you've sought and you've hunted I
[40:35] said what is conversion mean it means to
[40:39] turn around you were one time hating God
[40:42] hating religion and ignoring it but all
[40:45] the sudden at your desk you got to
[40:47] hunting God and seeking God you were
[40:50] converted he threw his arms around me
[40:54] and started weeping said brother Branham
[40:56] I've had it the whole time I said
[40:59] exactly right he said you don't need a
[41:02] prophet the word settles your question
[41:06] oh the Lord settles your question why
[41:12] did he point to the Lord it is the
[41:15] ancient landmark it was good for brother
[41:19] Branham it is good for us to know our
[41:21] position in Christ he takes the man to
[41:25] his experience that others devalued but
[41:29] brother Branham said right there's where
[41:31] God dealt with you that ought to make
[41:33] you shout we complicated in this day we
[41:37] don't bring them to a tongue or to a
[41:38] shout but we've got indoctrinate him
[41:41] real good in order for them to be a real
[41:42] believer what a shame let me ask you was
[41:47] the thirty thousand Natives in Durban
[41:49] South African doctrine aided or were
[41:51] they saved and filled with the Holy
[41:53] Ghost God don't need our help God does
[41:57] the saving salvation is of the Lord we
[42:03] complicate these things and then we
[42:04] undervalue what God has done in our
[42:07] lives how many has he turned around here
[42:12] can I give you another one
[42:15] this come in 1963 does God call a man to
[42:18] judgment without first warning him he
[42:20] says build-out asked me not long ago he
[42:23] said I'm getting old 91 years old do you
[42:26] think I'm ready to die do you think that
[42:28] I'm saved brother branham said Mr Dow
[42:31] have you ever had went to a doctor for a
[42:35] physical checkup
[42:36] he said yes sir he said now the doctor
[42:39] he's got a medical book and he said he
[42:43] will he will test you by that medical
[42:45] book and he said he'll take his
[42:48] stethoscope and he'll check your heart
[42:49] you check your blood pressure you get a
[42:52] urine sample and he said he'll look you
[42:54] over but when that doctor diagnoses you
[42:58] he bases his diagnosis off the medical
[43:02] book and he said now let's give you a
[43:05] soul examination and God has a medical
[43:09] book and this is what brother random
[43:12] quotes to him he quotes to him st. John
[43:15] 5:24 he that heareth my word and
[43:18] believeth on him that sent me has passed
[43:22] from death unto life
[43:24] he said now here means to receive he
[43:28] said he said what about it he said that
[43:32] means to hear his word you have passed
[43:34] from death unto life he said now how's
[43:37] your heart beating bill now said I
[43:40] believe it I've heard it I've received
[43:42] it he said now let's see what the doctor
[43:45] says you have passed from death unto
[43:48] life and he said I'm not the same man
[43:52] anymore
[43:53] he said I I'm not what I used to be
[43:56] brother Branham said no he said I used
[43:58] to care about going the other way
[44:01] but now my heart burdens day and night
[44:04] to get closer every word I believe it
[44:07] brother Branham said your heart is
[44:09] beating pretty good because you have had
[44:12] a conversion this is amazing here the
[44:18] seals are opened and brother Branham
[44:20] didn't in doctor name said well do you
[44:22] understand the opening of the word do
[44:24] you understand that the mighty angel and
[44:25] God has restored everything and that you
[44:27] know invite me
[44:28] that that day at Calvary and how he came
[44:31] up announced the word and the word only
[44:33] and do you understand the horizontal
[44:35] rainbow the third pole and the fish and
[44:38] the tabernac do you understand it you
[44:41] understand what the seven thunders are
[44:43] the seven seals the seven trumpets do
[44:45] you understand the revelations of God
[44:46] that's what it has become substitutes
[44:50] Paul said though I know all mysteries if
[44:53] I have not love it profits me nothing
[44:55] it's not about a head conversion it's
[44:58] about a heart conversion if I have not
[45:01] love it profits me nothing we need a
[45:03] change of the heart it's amazing that
[45:09] what we have in our life is the work of
[45:12] the Lord
[45:13] how many would devalue it how the devil
[45:17] would like to disorient you off the word
[45:19] to make you feel that you're not in you
[45:22] know by the grace of God I travel quite
[45:25] extensively and I find people don't know
[45:28] where they stand in Christ brother
[45:31] Branham said now desperations 1963 now
[45:35] there's no certain evidence isn't this
[45:39] interesting because we have received the
[45:42] mystery of everything the original sin
[45:45] the true truth of the Godhead the truth
[45:49] of the blood predestination we could
[45:52] walk through and show who Melchizedek is
[45:54] we could go down and even all the way
[45:56] down to Paul what his infirmity was he
[45:59] had an infirmity in his eyes and we
[46:01] could go we have the answer to it all
[46:03] but isn't it interesting with all of the
[46:05] answers even the dimensions of the city
[46:08] and the shape of the city that with all
[46:10] of the answers and the mysteries that
[46:13] yet the new birth is still a mystery
[46:15] isn't this interesting and it's not a
[46:17] coincidence God didn't forget about it
[46:20] and revealing all the mysteries he did
[46:22] not forget about it he's doing something
[46:25] here
[46:26] God is concealing something here because
[46:30] the new birth is a revelation brother
[46:33] Branham said now there's no certain
[46:35] evidence now look what you were and now
[46:39] look at what you are
[46:41] [Music]
[46:42] that's how you know what was you before
[46:46] the token was applied now what are you
[46:49] after it is applied what was your
[46:52] desires before and what is your desires
[46:55] after he said then you'll know whether
[46:58] the token is applied or not and the
[47:01] other things will automatically go with
[47:03] it what about it brother chapels what
[47:07] was you before you came to Christ what
[47:10] was you before you came to Christ what
[47:13] was your desires but there was a change
[47:16] that's not psychology because it's
[47:19] deeper than that where does that place
[47:22] you sister Angie where does that place
[47:25] you brother rich what was you before you
[47:28] came into this glorious life that God
[47:30] called you out of darkness brother Keith
[47:32] what about it what about what has God
[47:37] done what what is this miracle
[47:39] that we have experienced and if we could
[47:43] tell our dark closets we know we know
[47:47] where we were we know what we done and
[47:49] we know the path that we was on but God
[47:52] and His grace turned us around
[47:55] we got oriented we saw the ancient
[48:00] landmark and we begin to walk towards
[48:03] glory don't you love the Lord brother
[48:06] branham said now Jesus relied upon what
[48:10] he was he said search the Scriptures for
[48:13] in them you think ever eternal life and
[48:15] they testify of me so he knew that the
[48:18] Scriptures testified of him and he knew
[48:21] who he was because the scripture said
[48:23] who he was and brother Branham said if
[48:26] he knew who he was
[48:27] can't we know who we are we are
[48:31] believers I am a believer I'm a child of
[48:35] God I'm a son of God can't we rely upon
[48:38] it what he has made us he hath made us
[48:43] kings and priests Canaan is where they
[48:47] possess their rights the opening of the
[48:50] seals was to bring us into Canaan though
[48:53] Canaan
[48:54] boundaries and that was the place that
[48:57] they possess their god-given rights can
[49:00] you say men every one of us must claim
[49:03] our promises that we have been given God
[49:06] just don't give it to us we must claim
[49:08] it let's claim one I will never leave
[49:13] thee nor forsake thee I am with you
[49:17] always say always I am with you always
[49:22] though I walk through the valley of the
[49:24] shadow of death I'll fear no evil for
[49:27] thou art with me I will come to you I
[49:34] will comfort you I will be with you lo
[49:38] even unto the end of the world but
[49:41] you've got to claim that you've got to
[49:44] claim your healing
[49:45] you've got to claim your peace you've
[49:47] got to claim your joy you've got to
[49:50] claim it we're walking in the promised
[49:52] land and we're safe within the borders
[49:55] of salvation how wonderful you know
[49:59] Satan noise targets the Holy Ghost
[50:01] because he don't want you to know where
[50:03] you stand your voice if he can put a
[50:06] question there that's about as good as
[50:08] he wants you say well brother Craig I
[50:11] prayed at the altar and I got peace and
[50:13] you lost it the next day you say well I
[50:16] wear dresses and so do Muslims
[50:19] you can't put you can't put your
[50:21] salvation on those things you say I
[50:24] lived a life and you know and brother
[50:27] Branham said you can't you can't judge
[50:28] it on the fruits of the spirit I came to
[50:31] the altar then you came back next year
[50:33] you can't put you know that either well
[50:36] I had a certain sensation you're up one
[50:39] day and down the next is human emotion
[50:43] you know you cannot base it on anything
[50:45] outside the borders of the scriptures
[50:48] but you if you stay within the borders
[50:52] of the scriptures you're safe because
[50:53] God saved you and God said so that God
[50:56] loves you because God said so and that
[50:59] you are going to Eternity because God
[51:01] said so then you have position whether
[51:04] your
[51:05] me or your sad God said so whether
[51:08] you're blessed or in a trial God said so
[51:13] that's all that matters God said so
[51:16] God loves we no greater honor to God
[51:20] then when we take him at his word God
[51:23] said so notice this now where the random
[51:27] said now he was talking to brother
[51:28] lavell he said he's quite a theologian
[51:30] we were talking about the initial
[51:32] evidence of the Holy Ghost he said this
[51:34] and broken sisters 1965 he said now what
[51:37] do you think about the initial evidence
[51:38] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost do you
[51:40] think it's speaking in tongues where the
[51:42] RAM said no I don't see it that way and
[51:44] brother Laval said neither do I he said
[51:46] what do you think that it is brother
[51:48] madam said the best that I think it
[51:49] could be would be love and he said that
[51:52] sounded pretty good he said so I just
[51:54] accepted that it was love he said but
[51:57] one day the Lord in a vision
[51:59] straightened me out he said that the
[52:02] evidence of the Spirit was those who
[52:05] could receive the word not believe the
[52:08] word but receive the word and when he
[52:12] told me mail he said that scriptural
[52:14] because when he the Holy Ghost has come
[52:17] upon you he will reveal these things to
[52:20] you that I have taught and show you
[52:21] things to come he said there is the
[52:24] genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost he's
[52:28] never told me anything wrong yet it is
[52:30] the evidence that the Holy Ghost are
[52:33] those that can believe the word and
[52:36] receive the word so there's the genuine
[52:40] evidence of the Holy Ghost according to
[52:43] Jesus himself
[52:47] hallelujah
[52:48] so when brother Branham when we wanted
[52:50] to know where we stood with all the
[52:52] ghosts he brought us to the word
[52:54] evidence he brought us back to the
[52:57] scriptures that we could believe every
[53:00] word that we could receive every word
[53:02] and if you really receive it then you
[53:05] live it and if you don't live it you
[53:07] make it right and you you get right can
[53:10] you say Amen
[53:11] brother Branham said that at the opening
[53:13] of the seals the true
[53:15] evidence of the Holy Ghost was revealed
[53:17] under the opening of the word he brought
[53:21] it right back to the ancient landmark he
[53:25] said it has been the evidence since Paul
[53:27] it is always in every age been the
[53:30] evidence and now God has given us the
[53:34] message which is the word which is the
[53:37] ancient landmark back the ancient what
[53:41] Paul established we judge our baptism
[53:45] but why Paul preached we judge the
[53:47] evidence of the Holy Ghost by what Paul
[53:50] preached we judge our holiness standard
[53:52] by what Paul preached and now you can
[53:55] say I have met God's requirement I have
[53:59] accepted him I have confessed him I have
[54:01] buried him I have received him a spirit
[54:04] look at Joel how the devil tried to move
[54:09] job in his day and as I love I love the
[54:13] prophet of God he goes into places and
[54:15] he pulls out little snippets and draws
[54:19] out great revelations from it so here's
[54:23] I don't know if anyone knows this but
[54:25] here's Jobe and the devil ask permission
[54:28] to buffett him he pounds him and he hits
[54:31] him with boils and he takes his children
[54:33] he takes all of his possessions he turns
[54:35] his wife against him turns his church
[54:37] against him he's sitting there the skies
[54:40] are his brass he's cursing the day that
[54:42] he was born and the devil is trying to
[54:45] move him tell him you're a deceiver you
[54:48] have secret sins you are lost and Jobe
[54:50] was just like you and I he had a mind
[54:52] battles like you and I every one of us
[54:54] know we don't deserve this grace but
[54:57] Joel brother branham said was not
[54:59] looking at him because he said he knew
[55:01] he met God's requirements he was looking
[55:05] at the burnt sacrifice you and I will be
[55:08] up one day and down the next and all
[55:10] over the place but that burnt sacrifice
[55:13] was the Word of God God's requirement
[55:15] whether he had balls he stood
[55:19] sacrifice whether he lost his children
[55:21] he stood on that word whether his wife
[55:24] turned against her he stood on that word
[55:27] he said I can't I don't have answers to
[55:30] give you I have nothing that I can offer
[55:33] all I know is I have met God's
[55:35] requirement and when he believed God's
[55:39] requirement it was imputed to him for
[55:42] righteousness
[55:43] he was justified because he did what God
[55:46] required him to do you and I have no
[55:50] righteousness in ourselves but that
[55:52] righteousness is imputed when we are
[55:55] justified by our faith standing on this
[55:59] burnt sacrifice then your unmovable then
[56:04] then you can't be moved
[56:06] stay right there don't you move an inch
[56:11] don't you love the Lord I want to point
[56:14] you tonight before we're closed I want
[56:17] to point you back to Calvary to the
[56:19] ancient landmark every one of us if we
[56:23] could say where were you saved we will
[56:25] say that day at Calvary every one of us
[56:28] here we all want to point you back to
[56:31] the blood that cleanses us of all sin
[56:34] that blood is just as powerful and just
[56:37] as available as the day it was shed at
[56:40] Calvary I want you to look to Calvary I
[56:43] want you to look to the blood I want you
[56:46] to look at Pentecost where he poured out
[56:48] his spirit back to the original back to
[56:52] the message back to Pentecost back to
[56:55] the name of Jesus Christ back to signs
[56:58] and wonders back to the Holy Ghost back
[57:01] to the beginning back to the ancient
[57:04] landmark back to the power of God back
[57:08] to the resurrection let's go back to the
[57:11] beginning where they had loved one for
[57:14] the other let's go back where old man
[57:17] broke the brand and they fed upon the
[57:20] word daily back to the love of God back
[57:26] to a holy spirit filled Church back to
[57:29] the landmark that's how we know who
[57:33] we are that's how we can face tomorrow
[57:37] glory God has set these boundaries and
[57:41] wall unto the man that adds or takes
[57:44] away for he'll lose his part from the
[57:46] book of life because you're outside the
[57:49] borders of the word how men they say
[57:54] Lord I want to be in the promised land
[57:56] brother Branham said he will only bless
[57:58] you in the promised land the message of
[58:01] the hour thus saith the Lord that put
