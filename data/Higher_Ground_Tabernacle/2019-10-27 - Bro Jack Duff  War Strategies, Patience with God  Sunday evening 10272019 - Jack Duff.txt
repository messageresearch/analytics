hearts have been blessed and just been in fellowship brother Brooks has been inviting for a number of years and I'm just so happy that the Lord made a way for us to be able to come a man during this time and this morning we had a wonderful time there and I was sitting and you know and just just being there with the Saints and I got a chance to I think appreciate for the Brooks a little bit more for the great sacrifice that he makes to kind of take care of both churches and and I thank God for a servant of God a man that I'd be willing to sacrifice himself so much for that the people a man so Iowa you are blessed a man you are blessed and a man thank God for a servant like that but this we want to this evening just kind of go right into our thought I want to read from two passes of passages of Scripture and certainly good to see these precious brothers here I knew that they were in service last night went back home and and then can't you know brother Isaac make sure that we got there to church okay this morning but Isaac what I was showing you there I took the microphone from the church this morning so I left it back to her brother Brooks and he's gonna give it to you right now so you all you all forgive me I don't want to take that part of Iowa City back home with me you know but but God so but I want to just use two scriptures we should be familiar with these one is out a second Peter one you saw see the statue of a perfect man there on the wall and and we've been going through a series back at home a man using that and and and I can't preach the whole series and and one service a man but I didn't want to just bring wanted a thank you so much my brother just bring one thoughts that we've been sharing back at home we have been taking the virtues because we notice is something that applies to all of us as as as believers God has called us all to this this is not just a sign we put in a church right but this is a this is where God is trying to elevate us and bring us to as as Christians this is what Christianity is all about we didn't even know that when we were in our denominational churches it took a prophet to come and bring a sermon like statue of a perfect man so that we could understand what God was really calling us to and what he's expecting out of us so I've been taking that and using it as a foundation a man and we're using that foundation but then going back in the Old Testament and showing where one of those virtues were was manifested during a war right so this is uh this is title war strategies patience with God that's that's what our title is to tonight war strategies patience with God let's read here a man from Ephesians I'm sorry our second Peter chapter one a man second Peter chapter one and just verse three through ten will read that and then we'll take a scripture from the Old Testament as well here in 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 3 it says actually let me skip down a little bit alright I'm in the role chapter ii feet of one i'm in first peter okay alright verse three according as his divine power hath given us given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance to temperance patience and to patience godliness and you know I love one of the statements that the Prophet made in the statute of perfect man he says when you're truly born again he says these things will automatically add to you when you're truly born again now amen don't gonna skip that part amen but when there's a true birth that has taken place then these things will automatically add to you this is what we should see in the in life of a believer right verse 6 says and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you neither that you should neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins verse 10 says wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your call him and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall now let's go back and look at a man a passage over in Joshua chapter 5 and man Joshua chapter 5 praise the Lord a man just a couple verses here in Joshua chapter 5 verse 13 through 15 I believe is where I want to read amen in Joshua chapter 5 since this it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him the sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto Him art thou Forest or for our adversaries and it's that nay but ask captain of the host of the Lord am I now coming Joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto Him what saith my lord unto his servant a man and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose tashu from off thy foot for the place whereon thou standest is holy and Joshua did so amen let's pray over the word that we have read dear God we thank you for the privilege and the opportunity to stand before this portion of the elect a man the elect lady the bride of Jesus Christ a father as you've given us this opportunity we don't take it lightly we prayed it's something to be said to strengthen Lord that the church here that'll be something that has strengthened the people that will help them in their journey Oh God and just pray O God that it won't just be words that go in when they're not the end of us something that we can apply to our lives that would make us better Christians that would cause us to love you more and to want to serve you got with everything we have we just act so God that you would be a part of this service we take every spirit that's against the Spirit of God underneath control of the Holy Spirit even right now and we pray to to have your way in this portion of the service god it's in Jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you can be seated praise the Lord again we want to take for our title war strategies patience with God amen and when you go back and you listen to the sermon a statue of a perfect man when brother Branham got to the virtue of patience he brought out two things about that particular virtue says we got to learn to have patience with God and then he said the second thing we got to learn to have patience with one another hallelujah amen so I I just felt led with him there at the church just to kind of separate that into two different sermons and and we preach patience with one another and then patience with God amen and we even show in scripture there was a strategy a man-of-war that was needed and went where where Abraham demonstrated that when he went after lop he was having patients with lots a man lot what's constantly getting himself in trouble but Abraham would took disturbance out of his own house and went and got a lot out of trouble it was a war strategy that that Abraham had in order to rescue lot from the things that he was in and you know we looked at this a mint from a number of different places and you know I when we started with faith I used the character Gideon amen Gideon it took faith for Gideon to overcome and the day in which he lived a man Gideon took 300 men to battle now now now understand it that had it had been one of us we probably would have questioned God and said no I can't go out to battle when Gideon first started out that when took to this battle he had 32,000 warriors and I want you understand with 32,000 warriors he was going up against a hundred and thirty five thousand million Knights amen and when I looked at that the odds with 32,000 warriors the odds were Gideon before amen four million nights to one Israelite what a what would the odds were actually against him with four to one and God says it tells Gideon please make an announcement in the army whoever has fear tell them to turn around and leave right now oh my twenty two thousand men took off in it in one announcement Lord Jesus twenty-two thousand men going after one announcement and and I can just imagine some of the guys said I've been waiting to get out of this and I don't know how to get out of this but I'm taking my chance to go home right now twenty-two thousand goals just like that the odds were four to one now the eyes became thirteen point five to one and you know when they get down to ten thousand men God challenges Gideon once more and God says now even even though the odds I get you if you all won the battle we have 10,000 meeting you would think you did it in your own strength they say summer I'm going to bring the odds down a little bit more say click the men go to the water and and I want you to separate them based on how they they lap like dogs and and how they drink the water you say now some you know got it got prostate I'm prostrate on their own they facing and brother branham say they were idol worshipers a man they weren't even thinking about the enemy and nothing but the others just kind of leaned down and and cut the water and brought it to the mouth but they were looking in every direction because that's the way a dog would drink he would leak but he looked up in every direction making sure that he safe he said now put the ones that lap like dogs in one side and put the others on the other side God got down to 300 million that were laughing like dogs say now this is the army this the army I want you to go forward with get him probably looked and say how 32,000 the odds were stacked against me now then I got to 10,000 the odds were stacked against me now down to 300 you know the odds are now 450 million Knights 2-1 Israelites Oh hallelujah amen for me I get excited when the odds are stacked against me because greater is He that is in me than he that's in the world and also the Bible says one will chase a thousand and two will put ten thousand to a flight so there's nothing to fear when the odds are against you walk out by faith and know that God somehow is gonna make a way Gideon overcame in that battle with 300 men and and and and the other thing that God used this allowed him to go down into the the enemy's camp and hear a dream that they were interpreting amongst themselves and when he heard about the dream and how the man say there's nothing but the sword of Gideon coming in here and destroying us when he when he heard that that when he realized that the enemy was more afraid of him than he was of the enemy it changed everything and I think it's time for us as believers to recognize that the enemy is more afraid of us than we are of the enemy cancer is more afraid of you than you are cancer diabetes is more afraid of you than you are of diabetes whatever the devil might be trying to attack you with he is more afraid of you than you are of him we have nothing to fear come on church praise the name of the Lord but we you know that was a strategy when we talked about faith amen the war strategies faith we use Gideon as our example but I want to a man just take us on a journey tonight war strategies patience with God again the prophets say we got to learn to have patience with God and we also have to learn to have patience one with another glory to God now let me just read a few quotes for you just to get us set up here a man and then we will we will go as the Lord will lead us and stature of a perfect man the Prophet says patience with what it says what kind of patience says first thing is have patience with God if you got real genuine faith he says you have real genuine patience because faith worketh patience glory when God says anything you believe it that's all you got patience and might you might have to wait on it but when God says anything you believe it you got patience he said well I asked him last night to heal me and I'm just as sick this morning he says oh my what patience Laurie says God told Abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even one side he was still believing he was patient with God uh-huh put him always before you let him be the next crossing thing you can't cross him so just keep him before you he said so he said so it's going to happen to keep him before you that's right I like that you know Erie makes the statement about Abraham God to Abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even once time he was still believing he was patient with God now we are we all know the story of Abraham we know how he waited for 25 years for a promised son let me just inject a little something here glory to God this was a different sermon but I'll just I'll put it in here you know it was so perfect what God did with Abraham when he gave him Isaac it was it was so perfect that after he gave I gave him Isaac there was a time in Abraham's life Genesis 24 where he tells Abraham now take your only son and bring him up a man to the mountain that I will show you and it was a three-day journey to get to this mountain a man say and now I'm going to show you the mountain and and and just recently I had the opportunity to go to Israel and while I was there in Israel we're coming into Jerusalem and and a tour guide that was with us he just made an announcement on the on the bus he said this it's not Moriah and I said I said sir do you you realize what you're saying he says yes this is Mount Moriah and I served you realize Abraham brought Isaac to Mariah Mount Moriah he said yes I know that said this is not right I said well how far is Calvary from here he said oh it's just on the other side I'm like well I I had never been to Israel before so I don't know what just on the other side meant praise the Lord so I just began to do some Google search amen and I start putting in some things about how far as Mount Moriah from this and how far is caliper from that and and when I when I when I when I came back with the search results it was telling me that that Calvary was a four minute walk from where Mariah was so you know what that told me the same mounted and brother branham told us these things the same mountain that God told Abraham to bring Isaac is the same mountain that Christ was offered on himself so when you go back and look at Genesis 24 and the Bible says the Lord shall provide himself a sacrifice not not the law provide for himself the law will provide him himself it meant exactly what it said the same mountain that Abraham offered Isaac on is the same mountain Christ himself died on I don't want to go down that path but it's some other things that happened on that in that same spot but my Abraham had Abraham had faith a man he had patience to wait on God no sign of anything for 25 years but yet he kept confessing what is faithful I want to tell you have to do the exact same thing you might be waiting waiting waiting done the wind gonna come through but you just keep keep patiently waiting on God he will come through hallelujah oh I believe that church I believe that I believe that we're the seed of Abraham we should have the same faith that Abraham had it should be manifested in our lives brother Branham used seven different people when he talked about patience with God the first one that he used was Abraham the second that he used was Noah the third he used was Moses and then he used the Hebrew boys that there were number four the fifth person he used was Daniel Amen the sixth person when he talked about having patience with God was Paul hallelujah and then the seventh was a group of people he called them the believers on the day of Pentecost how they waited patiently for God to manifest his word now I just want to read Amen a little bit about Noah because I thought this was very very good a man ever says Noah had patience yeah Noah had real godly patience God I'm going to destroy this world with rain and going back to the conversation that we had on the other day amen I'm gonna destroy that they're taking the rainbow from us a man but the rainbow was a promise of God hallelujah right they say you had known or had a real godly patience said God said I'm going to destroy this world with rain and Noah preached a hundred and twenty years yet plenty of patience not even do for Evan wasn't nothing just as dusty as it ever was four hundred and twenty years but he was patient and I want you to just imagine going to North's church I want you to imagine being a member in North Church and if you remember North's Church and Noah comes to the pulpit and he says I got a sermon from the Lord and he says I want to preach it I'm I'm inspired to say this I want to tell everybody it's gonna rain and he begins to preach it's gonna rain they say we never heard nothing like that at first when they first heard it it was new revelation but for 120 years Noah was stuck in a series his series was its color rain for a hundred and twenty years and I can imagine maybe in a hundred and nineteenth year maybe somebody say I'm just tired of going to church every time I go past the nor preach the same sermon I can tell you the quotes he gonna read I can tell you the scriptures I can tell you everything nor just say it's going to rain and maybe maybe the word get back to no say the people thing about leaving the church amen because I'll you preach to the same thing you've been preaching for a hundred and eighteen years we talk we need something fresh you say okay I got I got something fresh come to church on Sunday got something fresh and Noah steps up to the pulpit opens up his text and it says get in the boat not asked a little different from it's gonna rain get in the boat why because it's gonna rain and imagine some of the people that decided to leave North Church just before the rain did I just think about people that was going all that time and they left Church just before the rain I want to encourage you stay with this be patient with God it's going to be a rapture and the only way you're gonna be prepared for this rapture is by what you feed on through the books and the tapes hallelujah glory to God this message has wrapped in faith all inside of it and this is what's changing your body glory to God the word is changing your body you might say how can the word change my body do you realize it was the word the word that changed the conditions of the world all God used to change the condition world was let there be in that change that that had caused the light to come into the world it let there be could change the conditions of the world they let there be can change the conditions of my body praise God the power of the word of God is transforming power inside of it nor was patient know especially now I want you to notice a statement that brother Branham makes here about North it says then God tries your patience he said that's right God tries them think about that not not the devil trying it God trying it oh listen to this statement says God tries your patience that's right God tries them he says after he told Noah and I said no I want you to go ahead get in the art and I'm gonna run the animals in there I want you to get in now if you happen to be a no neighbor in Noah's day if you would've saw animals passing through your backyard wouldn't you know if something was going on if they're going to get into art maybe I should go get in the Ark right but here here you know he say say say he said I want you to get in climb way upstairs now so you can see a look out top window now I want you to get that and I want you to tell these people tomorrow what I've been preaching for a hundred and twenty years is going to take place now that's God try this pricks it's because God tell them tomorrow what I've been three peaks reaching for a hundred twenty years it's going to take place it says all right you go down there and tell them now how does now brother branham breaks in a little bit more here it says no awaited the fourth day pass no rain there's it's all right it's gonna happen he say now this is the way he tries his patience look at what he says says I can hear now I'm gonna be honest I'm gonna be honest with you if the Prophet tells me that he can hear I actually believe he was hearing it I actually believe he was here in the conversation and brother Branham can tell us what Eve look like right my vision he could tell us what Eve looked like that should not be shocking to you how could Moses write the first five books of the Bible and he was not even there how could Moses write about the Garden of Eden and not even be there because God allowed him to go back with prophetic vision and if our prophet today could go back with prophetic vision I believe he's telling us exactly what he sees exactly what he hears you say God will try your patience the highly tried he says I can hear miss Noah his trout came through his wife his trial came through his wife listen every time I preached this to get quiet right when I say that I don't know what it's just like a holy hush but I just want to speak truth to you tonight listen the Prophet said it says I can hear miss Noah come around and say dad are you Shh before brother branham to give the word sure out you say don't talk like that sometime don't have to be a man the physical wife that could bring the trial but in a church it could be the spiritual wife if the pastor has a spiritual wife that's the church and sometimes the church might talk certain things past are you brother branham say don't talk like that he said don't talk like that you said he had patience what brother man says don't don't question God even though even though Moses I mean Noah said it's gonna rain tomorrow and it hadn't rained yet I'm still sure God spoke to me and I'm gonna have patience we got and it's during those moments that God is actually trying Noah's faces I want y'all to get this let me just keep reading it says he had patience does he had faith yes sir he had virtue he had knowledge that God was right he had temperance he didn't fly loose and say well I don't know what it's all about I've lost all my popularity out there no no people don't care for me no more I don't go out there and start all over again no again no no no he had patience God promised God will do it God will do it because God said so another trial of his patience when God was trying spacious after mama stop talking then the kids came in and if dad are you sure dad are you sure God led you dad you should he say say look look all I know is God told me to get in the art and then he told me to preach this sermon that is gonna rain two more but daddy it's not raining are you sure now here's the thing that I was I was really awestruck about they are inside the Ark Noah's wife Noah's sons their door I mean they're wise all of them are in the ark with the ark door closed and now they're having this conversation with Noah my question is if you got sealed in how you gonna get out so there's no need to doubt now we come too far to start doubting now we might as well go all the way somebody it's too late to doubt not if you're gonna doubt you should have doubted last week but now that we're here we might as well keep pressing the battle have patience with dogs no matter how long it takes you just wait on the Lord it'll prove himself and the Thunder begin to roar lightning begin to strike the rain begins to fall everything nor scent has finally come to pass and I want to tell you something everything that you've spoken over the years there comes a day where there must be a manifestation to the things that have been a revelation in your heart oh hold on to a church the prophets say Moses demonstrated patience and they said you know Moses when he went out there amen to Pharaoh and Moses was there I love this let me I'll just read something says why he said the Moses that went down and he met God on the backside of the desert and and I love that I love that it that testimony that Moses had of meeting God on the backside of the desert is a testimony that he shared with Joshua it's a testimony to share with Joshua stay with me here tonight a man because we read it in Joshua but seeing Moses day it was a pillar of fire inside of a burning bush but in Joshua's day the pillar fire had become a man and how did they know is the same experience because they did the same thing take off your shoes your own holy ground hallelujah so in Moses day as a pillar of fire in a burning bush speaking out to Moses but now in Joshua's day it's a man saying I'm the captain of the Lord's house take off your shoes your holy ground amen I believe that the experience to get greater and this generation we ought to expect everything God hat plus glory the car amen but here Moses a man is is there and i can i can see poses god tell them say now moses take your stick and throw it down on the ground take that rod and throw down the ground and here he throws it in the ground and and moat the Bible says that Moses was afraid so so when it turning just think I could see Moses running he's trying to get out of there I would probably be the same way I'm being honest with you I don't know I don't like playing with snakes right if God telling me to throw it down it turns just thing I'm getting out of here as fast as I can but God said and I pick it up Lord you said you just saw me run and now you want me to pick it up God wanted him to overcome those fears he says now pick it up Moses picks it up and then it becomes a stick again oh my what is this you saying I take your hand and put it inside your bosom put it puts it down there and he pulls it up it's leprous now I can imagine I'm just I'm just using my imagination if God would have told me to do something like that the first time in my head would have come out white like leprosy I would have been wondering what is in there and then God challenges him put your hands back down there Lord the last time I did that it came out looking like this and God never told him that he was gonna kill him when he put it back down he just told him put your hand back down there by faith he does it puts his hand back in there puts it out it's healed he's wondering what is this never seen power like this ready to go down into Egypt with these mighty manifestations gets to Egypt and and it's Pharaoh let my people go you ain't gonna let him go Pharaoh okay I got something for you takes his stick throws it down turns into a snake and Pharaoh says cheap magician trick my question is what were they practicing in Egypt if that was a cheap magician trick what were they practicing in here you know Moses throws it down and and Moses had to have patience because he didn't know what was gonna happen Pharaoh cost Jamison Jamison may throw down mystics they turn into snakes well Moses with his patience with God's watch his snake eat up the other snakes priests caught God will never be outdone by the devil if you learn to just wait on God he'll do something great brother branham makes a statement here that I want to just read to you it says why he said that cheap magician's trick come here a minute come here Janice and jam you and jam breeze throw throw your sticks down they throw it down and they turned into a serpent say it now you cheap thing come down here to me and Egyptian a pharaoh Egypt and you come down here with some of your cheap magician tricks on your hoax you know mind-reading you know what I mean I hope you read about it mental telepathy or something you see ya come down here and with some of that said well we can do the same thing you do what was Moses he didn't say old mr. Pharaoh I'm sorry sir I'll be your slave that's not what Moses said if brother Graham said no sir he stood still and that's what the church needs to learn how to do stand still and see the salvation of the Lord he stood still a man stay right there God said just no doubt in his heart hold your peace I'll show you something and I love this statement that he makes when you're done exactly what he said do and it seemed like it went wrong stand still and be patient when you're done exactly what God told you to do but it seemed like it went wrong stand still and be patient because the devil girls make you said now you know this what you just did that that that God ain't working with that stand still be patient I want to skip down brother branham use the Hebrew boys he used Daniel in the lion's den both of them had patience to wait on God but he made one statement about Paul only one and he's using them as a character that demonstrated patience and he said he said Paul had patient certainly did look what Paul had to do talk about patient that's all brother branham said in statute of perfect man about Paul but he never went into any detail of how Paul had patients so I said well how I know what brother branham's quote book was anybody else know where this quote book was it's right here in the Bible is real Brenda's quote book so I went to brother Brennan's quote book and I began to study about Paul's life and I realized why brother Branham brought Paul in and said that he had patients now let's read one scripture acts 23 and 11 amen x-23 an eleven glory to God thank you Lord Jesus Paul had patients and I just went back to the scripture and you know if you get a chance and just go and read this there's there's so much happening here in acts 23 Paul is in a position where people are trying to kill him right now in this particular chapter there's the men that have kind of gathered and said you know we're vowing that we are gonna kill Paul and and just so happen that Paul's nephew heard about the plan and he went and told some people and they were able to get Paul rescued and and sent on down to a certain place and everything before the people got there to kill him so so but but but one thing that happened here a man and verse 11 let's let's go to verse 10 says and when there Rose a great dissension the chief captain fear lest Paul should have been pulled in and pieces of them commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and bring him into the castle and the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer now I just love the way the scripture reads this man is about to lose his life and the angel or say be of good cheer God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts God's ways are not like our ways be of good cheer Paul for as thou has testified of me in Jerusalem so must I bear witness also at Rome now this is what the agent you sterling you a witness here in Jerusalem now you're gonna have to go to Rome and be a witness for me now I like I said this morning God tells us the end result but he never tells us what we're gonna have to go through to get to the end result hallelujah amen joseph has the end result through a dream but he didn't know you had to go to prison a man I think in order to get there he didn't know you had to go to Pilate Potiphar's house in order to get to that spot all the things he was going to have to suffer before he got to the end result brother Brandon said power had patience now we picked this up in acts 23 but I want to just I'm gonna skip and just kind of share with you and actually for Paul was taken to Felix to be judged by some of the things that he believed and this man Felix could find nothing wrong with Paul but yet he prolonged Paul's Amen judgment for two years kept him bound for two years even though he wasn't guilty of anything that people were saying about him now he prolonged the judgment trying to get money from Paul so Paul can pray for his freedom this is all during the time that God tells Paul you're gonna bear witness of me in Rome well before he goes to Rome he goes to prison for two years underneath Felix's reign now Felix I was governor at that time being at Phoenix Act the Bible says that Felix lost his position and then there's another rule and it comes in his famous Festus he comes in in acts 25 Paul is still in prison waiting for this manifestation of Acts 2311 waiting to actually get to Rome he's stuck in Jerusalem but God said you gonna bear witness of me in Rome stay with me here Paul had patience look at this actually fiery stood before Festus who replaced Felix and appeal to stand before and he told Festus I want to I want to stand before Caesar now why's Paul city wants to go to season because Caesar is actually in glory listen he says says now now I just I just love this I love this while he's standing there amen and Felix does want to pass judgment beers has some guests king agrippa hallelujah a man comes along and Paul has to stand before Agrippa and he begins to share his testimony as to how he got to where he got and I I just love this statement Agrippa makes a statement to Paul after Paul begins to share his testimony and I want you to catch this part for me Paul did not share mysteries with Agrippa Paul did not share the deeper things of God with Agrippa Paul only shared his personal testimony with Agrippa and through Paul's personal testimony a grim percent down almost persuaded me to become a Christian hallelujah I think often times we spend so much time trying to get people to blunt it to blow their mind all we need to share is our personal testimonies how the message changed us how old in the world change you share that you almost persuade somebody to become a Christian stay with me here tonight here Paul is standing before Agrippa and they still could not make any type of a they couldn't make any judgment he says I want to go I want to go stand before Caesar and they finally put Paul on a boat and say okay we're gonna send you to Caesar had you not had you not wanted to go before Caesar I probably wouldn't let you go you said no but I got I got a promise hanging over me then I'm supposed to go to Rome now I want you to understand in acts 27 this was acts 23 that he got the promise I'm in acts 27 now acts 27 Paul was on this boat and the Bible says why he's on the boat they run into a major storm and the name of the storm the storm had a name like like in in Florida we get major storms they get we get we get spaghetti when they come these hurricanes come we give them names how they Lou you that way we can remember them a man some of the damage that they do we want to remember I mean it was never like Andrew and never storm like this and never storm like that I mean we remember the name so so so here in the Bible the barbary course a tempestuous wind caused it by the name of euro Clyde I Paul have patience with God because Paul is on a boat in the midst of a storm Paul had told the seller say now don't sail in these conditions because I fear we show me and may lose their life Paul so y'all should sell but they convinced let's go in and sell Paul had patience with God and while Paul was at sea with this man the age of the Lord showed up in the midst of this tempestuous wind and say Paul nobody gonna be lost as long as they stay on the boat oh I like that in Noah's day you had to get in the boat if you wanted to be spared and and since Paul what's on the boat if you were with Paul you would be spared again anybody that stayed in the boat I don't care how much you thought you should get out the boat you better stay in the boat if you want to be spared and there's people today thinking about getting out the boat stay in the boat I don't care what kind of storm come against the boat if you stay in the boat you will be spared I gave everybody to you Paul every one of these souls are given to you as long as they stay in the boat they had lifeboats and everybody are thinking about jumping to get on a lifeboat say no no no no cut the lifeboats because if you get off the boat you're gonna die you stay in the boat you'll live it they look like they can live in conditions like that not only that here they get to a spot where the boat runs them to land some sand and it gets it gets stuck and the back end of the boat is just being torn to pieces torn to pieces stay with me there's been torn to pieces and they say say now we might as well kill all these uh all these already all these people that we got captives we ought to just kill them all these prisons we oughta kill him they say because Paul was with them you saw in the scripture because Paul was with them this interior say gnarley' ain't gonna kill nobody because I don't want to kill Paul other people were spared because Paul was with them I told him in Iowa City this morning your job is blessed because you work there the reason that they're making money is because God wants to sustain you there are so many things that amen I mean because Paul was involved that's why God blessed it and because you are involved as the Bride of Christ that's why God blesses it all say look nobody gonna lose their life but I tell you what I love this it says those that can swim just swimming up to the shore but those that can't swim just grab ahold of a broken piece of wood that you see floating in the water and I want to tell you something tonight if you can't swim to get to shore just grab a piece of the of the floating wood you want to know why because you can make it on broken pieces you can make it on broken pieces maybe your marriage feel like it's falling apart you can make it on broken pieces huh maybe your life feel like it's about to fall apart you can make it on broken pieces no I mean here Paul patience with God floats up to the shore but Paul's not in Rome yet why he gets to shore just made it through a shipwreck I'm cold all I want to do now is just warm by fire everybody else warming themselves why can't I warm myself puts his hand out and a snake bites him and this type of snake when it when it bites everybody knew it was immediate death immediate so they just looked at oh he made it through the storm they begin to cast judgment he humming finally God got him right now he's gonna die this man gonna die they look to Seaton Paul did not die not only Paul not back Paul Jess as believers isn't it time for you to rise up and just shake some things off stop complaining about it stop worrying about it but just shake it off hey hey hey like we said last night his purpose was his protection and he had not made it to Rome yet so there was nothing that could stop all from going to Rome all he did was shake it off everybody expected him to die before you know it Paul had a prayer line on the island and everybody else was getting healed but you know what his ministry was not totally as ministry was not going to stop at that Island he was supposed to go to Rome another ship comes in to the island guess what they get on the board get on board and they make their way to Rome acts 28 but all the things Paul went through from acts 23 to acts 28 that's why the Prophet could say Paul had patience he said Paul had patient my god he said certainly did look what Paul had to do talk about patient and I and I just love it I go right back to that statement even in the midst of Euro Clyde on I want to say this you could be going through a storm right now in your life you could be in a euro Clyde on experience everything is ripped I mean just ripped apart from your family's ripped apart your health is ripped apart everything is ripped apart you could be in the midst of that and still in the perfect will of God job went through a euro client on experience when he lost everything and he was in the perfect will of God nothing was going wrong in Jill's life as they were accusing him you can be in the midst of a storm and still in the perfect will of God have patience with God glory to God the Bible says this in Hebrews 10 verse 35 to 38 and I'm gonna make our transition here says cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise it's always after you've done after you've done right go over to God after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that he that shall come will come and will not tarry not now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul should I have no pleasure in him glory to God look at this statement a little testimony I want to read for you brother Branham talks about this talking about a sister that came a man to the prayer line she was encouraged by her experience she says recently she had sent one of those handkerchiefs to her sister for her look baby a man that had a clubfoot and she told the lady said you tied the handkerchief on his foot and the Lord is going to heal it he says so she let the handkerchief own about two weeks and it got so dirty as you say you can wash it and then put it back on and she's so she said so she did and the handkerchief getting kind of old and worn she said well there's no difference in the babies flip set I guess I might as well take it off she said oh don't you do that so if it comes to pieces you tie it with strings then tie it back on there she said because I know that it will get well she's seen so many things done in the meanings and the woman did that she just had a few streams of that handkerchief tied on the baby's foot and one morning she went to get the baby and the Lord had been there that night oh I love statements like that one that you're gonna walk to your situation you're gonna realize God has passed through the situation God has turned the thing around the Lord had been there because only the Lord can actually turn it around for you but the Lord had been there reminds brother branham talk about how to angel pass through the neighborhood the Lord had been there you got a neighborhood to that angel wants to pass through your neighborhood the Lord had been there because on the stateís since I says you only even since I oh my did you just throw the handkerchief way say well well no no no I let me go back up the Lord had been there that night and the baby's foot was straight and she brought the baby to the meeting to show and brought the strings that was left on the handkerchief and the and and the baby's picture before and where it was then however little baby's foot was clubbed in like that a little baby about eight or ten months old and there was the little baby's foot just as Norma's any other baby praise the Lord Amen it says now if what if she just throw the handkerchief away and say well that's where we missed the blessings if she just throw it away say that's where we missed the blessings we are free to wait on God just a little bit so you see you heard that's the only way again I can hear that whisper only wait it won't be very long even now the father's hand is pleading soon with Jesus we were seeing the victory song that's right just wait on God believe it confess it stay with it and God will bring it to pass for you can I say that it again believe it confess it stay with it and God will bear to pass for you glory to God I absolutely we believe that I love a man this little thought that the Lord has given because we go back now to some Old Testament scripture brother Branham used these seven characters that I read off Retta floor earlier knowing Moses and and Paul and Hebrew boys and you know and Daniel just so many Abraham that the children are children on the day of Pentecost amen are believers on that there's so many that that he talked about have patience but this this theme that the Lord's give me in war strategies I'd like to go back and look at different wars that happen in the Old Testament and how one of these strategies where one of these virtues was manifested as a strategy hallelujah and we talked about a man Joshua glory to God I mentioned to you earlier how Joshua had heard the testimonies from Moses of of how God had manifested himself in the burning bush but but with those testimonies I believe it anointed Joshua's expectations that when Joshua had his own experience Joshua was not trying to run off a Moses experience Joshua needed his own experience with dog but it was anointed by a man the testimony said he heard from Moses now when Joshua runs him to the captain of the hosts hallelujah when he runs into the captain of the hosts I want you to notice he has the same experiences of the same person that Moses ran into because he heard the same command off your shoes your holy ground but now josh was there talking to the captain of hosts Joshua made a statement that we read there in Joshua 5 he says what saith my lord unto his servant I believe it was at this moment that Joshua was receiving a strategy of war Joshua and the children of Israel were preparing themselves for a battle they needed to know how to overcome the walls of Eriko Oh hallelujah and God gave them a strategy as he talked to Joshua this captain of the hosts instill these things in Joshua and he told them what I want you to do is tell the people just to march around the walls for six days one time around the walls of Jericho and I can just imagine now now now here they are walking around the Western that on the seventh day I want them to march seven times around the wall now now the other thing in this strategy that they had that if you go back and read in Joshua chapter six they could not speak a word while they were marching can you imagine it so one of the strategies of war in order to overcome the enemy in Jericho was not to say a word hallelujah you know you might be able to overcome some things in your household if you learn to apply that same strategy don't say a word hallelujah Amen you might win the battle just by keeping your mouth closed you don't have to argue about everything you don't have to fuss and fight about everything but just by keeping your mouth closed you might overcome here they were told by Joshua don't say a word you can't shout until I bid you to shout you can't talk until I bid you the talk can you imagine six days of no words six days of saying nothing ctc I'm gonna tell you another thing here if you keep it quiet then the enemy will never hear it if you can keep it quiet than the enemy don't know what you when he battled against the brother prophet told us that right saysay you gotta keep things quiet cuz then you don't let the devil know anything I can imagine the people in Jericho trying to figure out what kind of strategy is this they won't talk they won't say nothing but they just keep marching around our walls six stakes that go by and I could imagine maybe on the sixth day somebody got a little discouraged so I'm walking no more and sometimes you they can't say anything you got to read it over their face their body language is saying it and when their body language saying that I ain't walking no more I'm not getting up there some kind of way you got to use your body language you're sick you get up we all gonna walk God made us a promise and its promise King thing hallelujah say let's get up say this the last day we got to go seven times you just sent in science to just give me seven more just give me seven more and here they go walking around the walls walking around walking around and they get around to the seventh time and all eyes are on Joshua now we done did exactly what God told us to do Joshua now what now what Joshua Joshua say okay now it's time we did exactly what God said dude and now it's time to have the priests coming some horns and we're gonna let out of each they say now y'all been holding this in for six four six six days now we on the seventh day and I'm pulling out the horn he said I want you to let out the greatest shout the largest shout that you could ever let out hallelujah and Joshua said now when we blowed off points after the horns blow everybody praise God they I don't want one person with a quiet mouth a voice not lifted up a man a hand not raised a I don't want one person Amen with with that refuses to praise God and notice this before the walls came down they live out the priests you gonna have to learn how to praise God before your trial changes you want it when you want to know what you're trying your your praises was changing your trial your praises was changing the outcome hallelujah we gotta learn how to worship God before we see anything happen I'm praising God before I see my child restore huh I'm praising God before the doctor pronounces my healing I'm praising God in advance you say I don't want nobody to be quiet it says we're not when we blow this horn when we blow this horn and so they had to have patience to walk around like that it took patience for these men just to believe that that they could walk around six days on the seventh day what march seven times it took patience to believe God will do what God say he gonna do they say now it's time y'all been holding it in your kids been holding it in nobody could say a word for us for seven days but now that we come to this spot when you hear the trumpet sound everybody let out a great shout not just a humble little shout I want you to imagine whatever situation you in tonight I want you to imagine that you walled up by Jericho walls Amen but tonight when you let out your shout you're gonna see your walls come down are you ready to shout are you ready to let out a great shout Amen on the count of three let's all let out the greatest shout that we got imagine yourself being there that day with Joshua a man he said when you hear the sound of the trumpet let us out one two three shout glory to God and while your son in the walls are coming down praise God your sickness is defeated those family problems Argentina a man whatever the devil has within it and is defeated hallelujah you've been patient you've been waiting old God now you let out a shout and watch God bring the walls down no devil can hold that everything on the wall came down except one place one place with a scarlet thread hanging out the window rehabs house and I just love the way God does it destroyed all the rehabs customers all her enemies and you realized when rehab got married they stood up and said is there anybody here they can find any just cause as to why rehab cannot marry this general every one of her accusers we're dead nobody could lay any charge on a rehab and if they couldn't lay a charge on rehab they can't lay a charge on you who's still they a charge against God's elect it is God that justifies hallelujah somebody glory to God somebody hallelujah Oh glory Oh glory they let out that shout and I tell you what God did some mighty mighty things a man for up for the children of Israel those walls came down they walked through Jericho's their first battle Amen there in the promised land and here they had a tremendous victory this war strategy of patience paid off for them this war strategy of patience I'm reminded just one other time in Scripture and will will read this glory to God if we can David had to apply this strategy a man this war strategy as well when he was fighting the Philistines and I want you to just watch this with me because God gave him two different strategies in two different battles with the same enemy let's look at it in second Samuel Chapter five all glory sometimes when you're in battle you have to apply your faith other times you're in battle you're gonna have to apply virtue sometimes you have to apply knowledge sometimes temperance tonight we're talking about patience there's in other battles you get you are facing out the flack godliness and then there's some battles you apply charity but no matter what strategy God gives you for the battle that you're facing each one of those virtues is something that's going to help you overcome here is 2nd Samuel chapter 5 verse 19 actually verse 18 the Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim David inquired of the Lord saying shall I go up to the Philistines wilt thou deliver them into my hand and here's the thing he's praying and seeking God before he does anything shall I go up to the Philistines with I'll deliver them into my hand and the Lord said unto David go up for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into time and David came to bow perazim and David smoked them there and said the Lord has broken forth upon my enemies before me as the breach of waters therefore he called the name of that place bow perazim I love the the fact that he named this place of victory and and I found out something a man because some of you all might be standing at bow perazim tonight and what bell piercing means is Lord of the bricks Lord of the briefs a man and what I find is that if you're standing at Barrett Barrett about bow perazim there's one of two breaks that could happen one is a break down another is a break through but he's the lord of the breakthroughs he doesn't get into Victor out of you breaking down a man but he gets victory when you break through and David got victory and he broke through on the Philistines at bow perazim but notice the next battle with the same group of enemies God gives a different strategy verse 21 says and there they left their images and David and his men burned them and the Philistines came up yet again that lets you know you can never expect that the devil's just gonna stop troubling you you know what you could have just overcome something now you get ready to go through something else amen it says says and the Philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim and when David inquired of Lord so here he goes back and he prays again David enquired our lord he said thou shalt not go up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees it says it let it be when thou here is the sound of a goin in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt be stirred ourselves for then shall the Lord go out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines David had to sit there and be patient and wait on God to stir the mulberry trees can I tell you something don't move until you hear from God and David did so according to verse 25 David did so as the Lord had commanded him and smote the Philistines from giba until they'll come to gazer if you'll be patient and your wait on God you'll smite your enemy as well the prophet makes a statement here in the pergamene church eh those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while he while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bright she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that worked which he left for this specific time these words that I'm reading to you are in the section where brother Branham was told by the angel the Lord to pick up his pen and write the angel is writing this about you he said now let us stand like Joshua and Caitlin our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did now Joshua means Jehovah Saviour and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader that's what the angel sent hallelujah and it says Caleb represents those that stay true with Joshua glory remember God has started Israel as a virgin with this word but they wanted something different so did the last state Church notice how God did not move Israel or let her go into the promised land until it was his own appointed time now the people might have put pressure on Joshua the leaders said the land is ours let's go and take it Josh where you are all through you must have lost your commitment you don't have the power you used to have you used to hear from God and know the will of God and that quickly something is wrong with you says but Joshua was a god-sent prophet and he knew the promises of God so he waited for them he waited for a clear-cut decision from God and when the time came to move God placed the full leadership in Joshua's hands because he stayed with the word God could trust Joshua but not the others so I will repeat in this end day the same problem the same pressures when the enemy is bringing in all that pressure to try to get you to buckle on the Word of God I want to encourage you stand still stand still see the salvation of your Lord he will come through maybe not when you want him to come through but he's always on time be patient with God be patient with God the Lord richly bless you hallelujah let's pray father our hearts are challenged by your word the things that we all go through Lourdes it's reality it's life we have to be reminded God of how important it is to just stand and patiently wait on you you have never failed and if you have never failed this I just don't believe it's possible for you to start filling now because you are the same yesterday today and forever they'll help us apply these strategies to our own circumstances and situations we'll find a big tree in the midst of it who God if we can just hold on when we look at Paul and all that he went through God he applied a man this this business patience God no apply patience moses applied patience abraham applied patience oh god just so many in scripture that we can look back the hebrew boy is daniel and lions being everybody waiting on the boat waiting on the lord sometimes that seems to be the hardest thing that we do is wait over you god but that's the best thing that could happen to his father we can just wait we'll see you manifest yourself in ways that we never ever I pray God that you just continue to strengthen the group of believers here in Des Moines God and father that your servant that you have here brother Brooks Lord God continue to strengthen him and encourage him Lord and amen Lord that in the DISA mighty work that he's doing in this area I just got a chance to appreciate it even that much more father by having the opportunity to go down there to Iowa City and Lord come back here this afternoon to preach sometimes we take things for granted but oh god I just pray that you just continue to strengthen him and the help that you've already blessed him with a finished church just just continue to raise them all up God that they would all Lord just be used by you for your war for your heart thank you for the work that you're doing here in this area and this in this this state God thank you for the great work and as they're patient just the waiter and you got me you continue to manifest yourself everything that they're believing you for everything that they're looking for you to do god I pray to bring in the past Oh God we thank you Father for this this week in the to giving us we thank you for this time of being able to let out a great shout you know the things that we were facing and the things that we're up against God our our beliefs our faith does that Lord the walls and those circumstances of situations are coming down even right now we shout and we praise you before it even happens because we got confidence in the God that we serve we praise you we thank you we love you so in Jesus name that we pray amen amen amen God richly bless you church it has really been our joy to be here in fellowship with you all this weekend and our prayer is that if the Lord tarry and we trust that he won't care haven't read the same prayer that John prayed and a man in the book of Revelation even so come Lord Jesus I look forward to his soon returned but if the Lord tarry a man and and if this is his will we would love to come and fellowship with you all once again and we certainly enjoy ourselves and amen we just appreciate the great work that's happening here and I'm a man God is God is real good about us Rick you'll be thank you thank God for your pastor and his precious wife a man just just everyone standing by his side we just appreciate it and I'm glad that I was able to fulfill my promise hey man thank you brother Brooks for having patience with me god bless you the Lord keep you until we meet again I'll turn the service over to your pastor this time - god bless you [Music] you [Music] everybody has been blessed an iceless ratio thank God for the Word of God amen they always say behind we've enjoyed out so stearic as well we think God wanted them both coming in God has been so good to us I tell you we we we don't deserve his goodness God gave me a double blessing you have my friends come up in I trust they still love me I gave them a piece of cake you know God people don't understand sometimes when when when people come see you that's an act of love they don't have to do that that's the way I train my children I said if somebody just give you a nickel you never forget the nickel you never forget that somebody gave you that some people shake your hand they don't have to shake your head shaking your hand is an act of kindness I act of love but you'll find out that some people won't shake your hand but people willfully do it and when somebody willfully do something for you don't ever forget me you know I won't call it a name but just just a matter of fact that almost everything I wore this morning was given to me that was an act of love people don't have to do that for you and I'll never forget you know when people do something like you know even brother luminous in its church coming over you know that's an act of love they don't have to do it I didn't make them [Music] I think I've faked each and every one of you who have come out are to to help us worship and I always think one of these old days we're gonna have an eternity to fellowship here is that right and we must always understand that we are covered by the blood it is the blood that saves us keeps us safe before we we dismiss you know I don't know if he's got something on his heart I have eight children and when you have eight children you know they're all different no they're not cookie cut it but you know I wish that first one was like the second but it don't work that way so it is it with the children of God we cannot expect each and every one of us to be the same right the thing that matters the most is that we have the same blood we come from the same father same Creator is that right and you know I don't think they've been a hot they're one of the virtues I think he could have preached on anyone but that patience is what we not only with God but with each other that was wonderful that's a masterpiece as far as I'm concerned and I'll never forget it you love the Lord and then we're just singing a song or two before we dismissed words cannot express my gratitude I'm a man I love to tell people how I feel sometimes I make people feel uncomfortable but I hear my prophet say it too he's a man that expresses his heart and I'm the kind that expresses mind and that's just the way I am sometime I'll overload people but I don't mean to when I love you I love you I give people my heart and that's what I do god bless you [Music] seven little announcement having youth meeting that's the second weekend of November here this church so we're supposed to start at 11
