[25:48] uh this past weekend we had a yard sale

[25:54] my daughters and
[25:57] so anyway uh
[25:58] friday uh
[26:00] one of my daughters and my grandma was
[26:02] supposed to put out signs well they said
[26:04] he was only able to put out one sign or
[26:06] the sign they put out
[26:08] nobody's gonna see it so anyway they uh
[26:12] they put it out and so the next day we
[26:14] had people but it was kind of slow so we
[26:16] just started praying so lord please let
[26:18] somebody come by
[26:19] he did and then it was a little later
[26:22] then so we asked somebody i said lord
[26:24] please let somebody come by and
[26:26] uh
[26:27] get the shoes and the clothes or
[26:29] whatever the case was and as soon as i
[26:31] prayed for his taste it's like god just
[26:34] had one person and they got just what i
[26:36] had just prayed for and then we had
[26:39] little books and then like it took a
[26:40] little while and i said lord we need
[26:42] some more people to come by for our yard
[26:45] sale and so we asked the lord could you
[26:47] let him come by and get some shoes and
[26:49] some books and maybe some more clothes
[26:51] or brother clothes or their children
[26:53] clothes and so surely enough the lord
[26:55] came by i mean he answered the prayer
[26:57] right off i did it like three or four
[26:59] times and god was just grateful and he
[27:01] just did that and i just want to thank
[27:03] god too because um saturday we had it
[27:06] and the same thing was happening and
[27:08] then
[27:09] i was saying well maybe i just need to
[27:10] go put some signs out so we'll have a
[27:12] better day today or something whatever
[27:15] and the lord said i was gonna
[27:17] bring the people to you don't worry
[27:19] about the signs i'll bring the people to
[27:21] you and sure enough god did just what he
[27:23] said he was bringing the people with us
[27:25] so after our yard sale the lord blessed
[27:28] us tremendously and then so after y'all
[27:30] said i was with my daughter crystal we
[27:32] went to go find a sign that they put up
[27:35] well that somebody had took it down so i

[44:30] brother liz as i am
[44:32] amen he has been truly missed
[44:36] and uh i'm glad to see him back
[44:39] in one piece
[44:42] you love the lord
[44:44] amen
[44:46] we're not gonna prolong the time we're
[44:47] just gonna get right into the word of
[44:48] god i just got a little
[44:51] i want to say short message but usually
[44:53] when i say that it ends up long
[44:56] i really
[44:58] enjoyed myself down in iowa city on last
[45:02] sunday we really had a
[45:05] a glorious time
[45:07] i'm going to preach that message here
[45:09] but not tonight
[45:11] but by the grace of god we ask that you
[45:13] turn with us
[45:16] excuse me
[45:19] to proverbs 3 18
[45:22] proverbs 3 18.
[45:38] i believe with all my heart that
[45:40] we're in
[45:41] i say this all the time but because i
[45:43] believe
[45:45] that we're in the lifeguard we want to
[45:47] say the last seconds of this thing
[45:50] uh what god is doing
[45:52] and
[45:54] i'm glad
[45:55] you know
[45:57] one thing i want to say is that
[46:00] we must make sure that we have the right
[46:02] understanding of what god is looking for
[46:06] without having the right understanding
[46:08] you'll miss the vote
[46:11] and i trust by god's grace we understand
[46:15] what god has come
[46:17] to do in these last days
[46:20] and
[46:22] one thing i know about predestination
[46:24] and election it
[46:26] it has to happen
[46:28] uh whatever god has for ordained must
[46:31] come to pass
[46:32] and whatever he's spoken
[46:35] concerning you and i
[46:37] must come to pass
[46:39] and i'm so glad that he is the one that
[46:42] controls everything
[46:44] uh ourselves
[46:46] uh we know that without god we are
[46:49] nothing
[46:50] but um
[46:52] we thank god because sometimes we
[46:56] we just take the grace of god for
[46:57] granted
[46:59] and i think there's no better way to say
[47:00] it
[47:01] proverbs 3 18
[47:04] and then we'll have you seated
[47:12] you there
[47:14] she is a tree of life
[47:17] to them that lay hold upon her
[47:21] and happiness is everyone
[47:25] that retaineth
[47:27] her
[47:28] one more scripture psalms 102
[47:32] psalms 102.
[47:34] we'll read the 18th verse there
[47:44] one of the things that i know that god
[47:46] said make your calling and election
[47:50] sure i apologize tonight i'm a little
[47:53] weary
[47:55] didn't sleep well last night and was
[47:56] busy all day
[47:58] so forgive me for that
[48:01] psalms 102 18.
[48:08] this shall be written for the generation
[48:10] to come
[48:12] and the people which shall be created
[48:16] shall praise
[48:18] the lord
[48:21] let us pray
[48:23] father we thank you for your grace and
[48:25] your mercy
[48:27] we thank you for your goodness
[48:29] and everything that you have done for us
[48:33] there are no words to express our
[48:36] gratitude
[48:38] sometimes we think within ourselves you
[48:40] know how much we
[48:42] how much is it that we do know of you
[48:45] but lord i thank you for the portion
[48:49] of the word
[48:50] and faith
[48:51] that you have given unto us
[48:54] and father i return this with
[48:56] thanksgiving
[48:57] we're so thankful for
[49:00] your amazing grace
[49:02] father we just pray that your perfect
[49:04] will be done
[49:05] we ask these things in your lovely name
[49:07] jesus christ we pray
[49:09] amen amen
[49:10] you may be seated
[49:16] i i know this is going to sound really
[49:18] strange
[49:19] my subject
[49:21] you know
[49:22] because it may seem like
[49:24] it doesn't go with the scripture that i
[49:25] just read
[49:28] but my subject tonight is let this mind
[49:32] be in you
[49:35] we know by god's grace that uh
[49:39] we're living in the last days
[49:43] we're at a time where we are at the
[49:46] i would say the top of the pyramid
[49:50] we have passed through seven ages
[49:53] and now we're in what we call
[49:56] uh the eternal age
[50:00] and we didn't get there by chance
[50:05] you and i must understand that every age
[50:07] has a certain amount of people allotted
[50:10] to it
[50:13] when i think about how god has always
[50:15] been
[50:16] there for us
[50:19] you know you think and i've thought many
[50:22] times where was god
[50:24] when noah was in the ark
[50:29] where was he was he above was he in the
[50:31] storm was he
[50:32] where was he
[50:34] and then the lord showed me he was in
[50:36] the ark
[50:38] because he told noah come in
[50:41] yeah
[50:42] come into my house amen
[50:45] and that's the way it is god is always
[50:48] there
[50:50] not only just with us but in
[50:52] us we have been created after the old
[50:55] order
[50:56] and when i call it the old order the old
[50:59] union
[51:00] i think that's the way the prophet of
[51:01] god
[51:03] talks about it there
[51:04] in the laodicean church age that old
[51:08] union
[51:10] as we marry our wives that's old
[51:12] old union
[51:14] but there is a new union
[51:16] a union that is could not been
[51:19] accomplished
[51:20] by the old we were truly stuck
[51:24] there was no real way of escape had not
[51:26] jesus christ come
[51:28] and
[51:29] delivered us
[51:31] he was made
[51:33] god prepared himself a body
[51:36] and this uh body was made by god
[51:40] not only was the sperm but the egg as
[51:43] well
[51:45] so that there was no there would be no
[51:47] contamination
[51:49] of the sea jesus christ
[51:52] he was god in flesh and the bible said
[51:54] he was the fullness of the godhead body
[51:57] hallelujah
[51:58] now we must understand by god's grace
[52:01] that
[52:02] god uh how can i say it
[52:05] let's put it this way the way
[52:07] the word of god come to us
[52:09] uh in the time when brother branham was
[52:12] here and the seventh seal was open
[52:15] and all of a sudden there was a half
[52:18] hour of silence
[52:20] well
[52:22] god has always been doing that we just
[52:24] didn't know what
[52:25] silence mean it means rest
[52:29] and you know the bible said that that
[52:31] god rested on the seventh day and so
[52:33] many times i thought that you know he
[52:35] was tired
[52:38] but god doesn't get tired and neither
[52:39] does he get weary
[52:42] that means he was silent
[52:45] there's always a silence
[52:48] it's like when
[52:49] uh because when in that silence there's
[52:51] always something god is doing
[52:54] remember the prophet god said the
[52:55] greater things are the silent things
[52:57] you don't hear the moon you don't hear
[52:59] the sun you don't feel the rotation of
[53:02] the earth or you don't hear it thank god
[53:04] we don't and can't
[53:06] but doing all of that action
[53:08] god is doing something that is
[53:11] how could you say it
[53:13] beyond description
[53:15] and
[53:16] it is what he's doing now
[53:20] it is what god has always been doing
[53:24] because in that time of silence
[53:27] there with noah which was seven days
[53:30] seven days noah was in the ark
[53:33] no more hammering
[53:34] no more nailing
[53:36] nothing
[53:37] noah was there
[53:39] but at the time
[53:41] noah was not by himself
[53:44] because every time god get ready to do a
[53:46] mighty work like that he always show up
[53:52] now when we
[53:54] think about the seven seals and what god
[53:56] is doing with us
[53:58] we we always looking for the half our
[54:00] silence and i believe within my heart
[54:03] that god is already working it
[54:07] because in this day he declared that he
[54:09] would make himself a bride
[54:12] even in the laodicean church age brother
[54:14] branham declared he said the heavenly
[54:15] bridegroom created his own
[54:19] bride
[54:21] now the thing that's really exciting to
[54:23] me is that
[54:24] he always uh build
[54:27] and he starts
[54:28] with his own faith
[54:30] because by faith
[54:32] was the worlds created
[54:34] so god can't change his foundation his
[54:37] way of doing things it always faith is
[54:40] the foundation of everything a christian
[54:43] does
[54:45] and so we know by god's grace that
[54:49] there's
[54:51] a new creation
[54:54] the bible says according to corinthians
[54:58] 5 and 17 therefore if any man be in
[55:02] christ he is a new creation
[55:06] and that just cannot get out of my
[55:08] spirit because when i think about a new
[55:10] creation i don't think about a patched
[55:12] up job
[55:13] matter of fact when i was in
[55:15] organization and denominations i had i
[55:17] could look back and think how patched up
[55:19] that was
[55:21] because some days i'll do evil and some
[55:23] days i would do good
[55:25] and you and i must understand that god
[55:27] is calling us to a higher calling
[55:30] you must understand by god's grace the
[55:32] message comes to kill you and
[55:35] and make you rot
[55:37] the word of god comes to produce a new
[55:40] seed
[55:41] a new life
[55:42] in you and that life is not secondary to
[55:45] your flesh
[55:48] hallelujah hello somebody
[55:51] so you got to understand amen that what
[55:53] god is calling for
[55:55] is total control
[55:58] i didn't say 99
[56:01] i said total control
[56:03] of you
[56:05] hallelujah
[56:07] and you and i must understand just like
[56:09] he created his own body god created the
[56:12] body of jesus
[56:14] without any man's help
[56:18] so we're not in a age where we just have
[56:21] to have somebody's help
[56:24] because god is on the scene
[56:26] now i want to say this by god's grace
[56:28] before i go too far with what in that
[56:31] thought
[56:33] when we think about the baptism of the
[56:35] holy ghost
[56:38] sometimes we think
[56:40] we got it made
[56:44] have you ever thought about how when
[56:46] john
[56:47] was caught up into the heavens
[56:50] and he saw the magnificent things that
[56:52] he did see
[56:56] and the bible said that john wept
[57:00] because there was no man
[57:02] worthy to open the book or to loose the
[57:05] seals thereof
[57:07] now john had the holy ghost
[57:10] and john was translated
[57:12] and john said unless this lamb come
[57:14] forth
[57:15] we're all lost
[57:18] so you got to understand without this
[57:20] message
[57:22] everything else would have been lost
[57:24] because without us they cannot be made
[57:27] perfect
[57:28] and what is it about us
[57:31] that makes us different from the other
[57:33] church ages because they knew god in
[57:36] part
[57:38] hello
[57:39] paul said
[57:40] as children we have known him in part
[57:43] but when that which is perfect is come
[57:46] we put away the childish things
[57:50] childish things like
[57:51] speaking in tongues believing that's the
[57:53] evidence of the holy ghost and running
[57:55] up and down the aisle and all of those
[57:57] things are good he said but that's
[58:00] childish when you really begin to see
[58:02] what god has called you to be
[58:05] the bible tells us that we've been
[58:07] created in god's image
[58:09] can you imagine that
[58:12] god's image we are created in god's
[58:14] image
[58:16] now that is that was that was even in
[58:18] the old order
[58:20] adam
[58:21] was in the in in not only in the mind of
[58:24] god and the laws of god and he was
[58:26] created in an image of god that's why
[58:28] adam could not
[58:31] ignorantly sin
[58:33] because adam was in his theophany
[58:37] he was in a word body
[58:39] because first of all he was created
[58:41] spirit
[58:42] before he was created flesh
[58:45] he was in the image of god amen which
[58:47] was a spirit and then god formed him out
[58:50] of the dust of the earth
[58:52] hallelujah
[58:54] you know adam amen was so connected with
[58:57] god he had the mind of god
[59:00] he said brothers why are you losing it
[59:02] maybe so and it might be good that i do
[59:05] but the point is he was so connected now
[59:08] i'm talking about mine now
[59:10] how did adam know what to name those
[59:14] animals
[59:16] the animals had already been named
[59:20] and adam called them by name
[59:24] so you say well what do you mean his
[59:26] mind was so connected to god that he had
[59:29] the mind of god
[59:32] it was through the fall he lost the mind
[59:37] and he gained what we call the carnal
[59:39] mind the fleshly mind the beastly mind
[59:43] and therefore that's why god said we
[59:45] must be born again
[59:48] philippians 2 5 says let this mind be in
[59:51] you which was also in christ jesus who
[59:54] being in the form of god thought it not
[59:57] robbery to be equal with god
[1:00:00] now that's a powerful statement
[1:00:05] that he was in
[1:00:06] christ was in the image but he thought
[1:00:08] not thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:00:10] with god
[1:00:12] now isn't it amazing
[1:00:13] because to the natural mind to the
[1:00:15] carnamine things that i'm saying may
[1:00:17] sound blasphemous
[1:00:20] but the word of god says did not god
[1:00:22] call ye gods
[1:00:23] did not he said ye are gods whom the
[1:00:26] word of the lord comes to
[1:00:29] and mind you
[1:00:31] we didn't seek god
[1:00:33] god sought us
[1:00:36] think about it
[1:00:37] have you ever thought about those little
[1:00:39] mysteries that hidden within the
[1:00:41] scripture
[1:00:43] how god
[1:00:44] hold things in there and then all of a
[1:00:46] sudden it just opens up to us
[1:00:50] and that's how it is with the bride of
[1:00:51] jesus christ
[1:00:53] what was it
[1:00:55] how is it
[1:00:57] that even um
[1:01:00] when it came to to the scripture how
[1:01:03] saints true seed of god came to
[1:01:06] understand
[1:01:08] what god wanted i think when david was
[1:01:11] getting ready to
[1:01:13] kill i'm i'm releasing
[1:01:16] her
[1:01:18] her husband's name was fool
[1:01:23] i can't think of a name right now but
[1:01:24] you know who i'm speaking up
[1:01:26] isn't it amazing how she automatically
[1:01:29] knew what to do
[1:01:31] to appease david and she had never
[1:01:34] talked with him
[1:01:40] what was that that was something given
[1:01:43] to her by god
[1:01:45] showing in type the bride of jesus
[1:01:47] christ lives
[1:01:49] by the inspiration of god
[1:01:52] she has the mind of god
[1:01:55] and if she doesn't have the mind of god
[1:01:57] she will get it
[1:01:59] right right
[1:02:01] because you say well what what about
[1:02:03] tamar who told tamar to do what she did
[1:02:09] to us it would have been a sinful act
[1:02:13] but she caught the mind of god
[1:02:16] in spite of her
[1:02:19] her her failures
[1:02:20] she caught the mind of god and she moved
[1:02:23] into it and god rewarded her
[1:02:27] see it
[1:02:28] what we've got to understand in this age
[1:02:31] is not touch not taste not handle not
[1:02:36] that's not what we're working with
[1:02:38] with the grace of god there's liberty
[1:02:45] you say books are what what let's put it
[1:02:47] this way jesus christ was the fullness
[1:02:49] of the grace of god
[1:02:53] and he let that woman touch his feet
[1:02:57] it was against the word
[1:02:59] against the law if you want to put it
[1:03:00] that way for a priest or anyone that
[1:03:03] thought himself to be a priest to be
[1:03:06] touched by the unclean
[1:03:08] that's why simon said don't he he
[1:03:11] who is this man doesn't he know
[1:03:14] what kind of a woman this is
[1:03:18] sure
[1:03:20] but the bible said jesus christ was full
[1:03:22] of grace
[1:03:24] and truth
[1:03:28] and one thing they did not know
[1:03:31] they looked at her as a prostitute
[1:03:34] but jesus saw her as a daughter
[1:03:39] now when we think about the mind
[1:03:43] you know i always thought it was a
[1:03:45] little compartment somewhere
[1:03:47] but mind in itself is your being
[1:03:52] it is really the element of a person
[1:03:55] that enables them to be aware
[1:03:58] of the world their experiences to think
[1:04:02] and to feel
[1:04:03] the faculties of consciousness and
[1:04:06] thought
[1:04:07] what is that
[1:04:09] it's your existence
[1:04:11] is your being
[1:04:13] and so when we think about let this mind
[1:04:15] be in us we're not talking about a
[1:04:17] little piece of god
[1:04:21] we're saying let the being of god
[1:04:25] be in us
[1:04:27] let his thoughts
[1:04:29] let his actions let his feelings
[1:04:33] right i mean yourself oh what brother
[1:04:35] that's that was yesterday but what about
[1:04:37] today
[1:04:40] what about the time when brother branham
[1:04:42] was getting ready to take a flight
[1:04:44] and the spirit of the lord told him keep
[1:04:46] walking
[1:04:48] that's a connection
[1:04:50] that's having the mind of god
[1:04:55] hallelujah
[1:04:56] what about it when jesus the jesus said
[1:04:58] i have need to go by samaria
[1:05:01] that was the mind of god that was the
[1:05:04] character of god that was the the
[1:05:06] consciousness of god that was god
[1:05:10] in complete control
[1:05:13] and that's what god is requiring from
[1:05:15] the bride
[1:05:17] complete control
[1:05:19] hallelujah
[1:05:21] you know and what is he doing he's
[1:05:22] building us
[1:05:24] we don't even think about it but when he
[1:05:26] adds faith virtue to our faith that's
[1:05:29] god building us
[1:05:32] hallelujah well you say oh he not built
[1:05:34] to pyramid but let me tell you something
[1:05:36] god
[1:05:37] or enoch with god in him he could not
[1:05:41] have done it without god
[1:05:45] what about the temple
[1:05:48] solomon's temple the great temple
[1:05:51] the word of god said those stones were
[1:05:53] cut
[1:05:56] not just in jerusalem from all over the
[1:05:58] world we don't know where they all came
[1:05:59] from
[1:06:01] but when they came together there was
[1:06:03] silence
[1:06:04] there was no pounding on the on on the
[1:06:07] stones and pushing and making i don't
[1:06:09] know how they did it but the bible said
[1:06:11] there was no noise
[1:06:13] why because god was the constructor
[1:06:18] and a lot of times we don't know what's
[1:06:20] in us
[1:06:22] but let me tell you something when god
[1:06:24] is in you
[1:06:26] he does the building
[1:06:29] it's always been god is that right
[1:06:32] he is the creator and we are the
[1:06:34] creation
[1:06:36] that's what i love about him
[1:06:39] because you didn't give yourself ears to
[1:06:41] hear this message
[1:06:43] hallelujah
[1:06:45] when the prophet of god was screaming
[1:06:47] out to laodicea come on out of her come
[1:06:49] on out of her in other words god is
[1:06:51] finished come on out of her if you want
[1:06:53] to make a rapture come out of her and if
[1:06:56] you don't you will be come out of her
[1:06:59] you will be partakers of her sins
[1:07:02] in other words god is saying i'm done
[1:07:05] with what sin brought
[1:07:08] good and evil
[1:07:10] is that right
[1:07:11] because according to the scripture
[1:07:13] he said make the tree either good
[1:07:16] or evil evil
[1:07:18] that's what he said matthew 12 33 he
[1:07:21] says either make the tree good
[1:07:23] and his fruit good or else make the tree
[1:07:27] corrupt and his fruit corrupts for the
[1:07:30] tree is known
[1:07:32] by its fruit
[1:07:36] and it didn't say it really said his
[1:07:38] fruit
[1:07:39] so it must be a male gender
[1:07:42] it must be a god
[1:07:45] mind
[1:07:46] if you understand what i mean
[1:07:48] in other words let me explain by god's
[1:07:50] grace jesus said i am the branch
[1:07:54] right the word of god says i am the
[1:07:56] branching i i'm i am the vine and ye are
[1:07:58] the branches
[1:08:00] the branches bear the fruit but it can't
[1:08:02] bear fruit of his own
[1:08:04] in other words it comes through the vine
[1:08:07] right
[1:08:08] so in in the prophet god says listen
[1:08:10] this is the way it works
[1:08:12] if you were to take amen oh uh uh let's
[1:08:15] say a cantaloupe
[1:08:17] and put that life into a watermelon vine
[1:08:21] it will never ever
[1:08:22] bring forth another watermelon
[1:08:25] right because the life of the cantaloupe
[1:08:27] is in there now that's different from
[1:08:29] grafting now that grafting if it's a
[1:08:32] watermelon or a
[1:08:34] whatever that branch is grafted in but
[1:08:36] the original branch or the original uh
[1:08:39] branch that was attached to the vine
[1:08:41] bring forth another branch it'll bring
[1:08:43] forth the regular fruit
[1:08:45] but you see what happens is
[1:08:47] if we can see why jesus said this
[1:08:50] because throughout the church ages
[1:08:52] these different branches were
[1:08:55] engrafted
[1:08:58] but there was a time where the life in
[1:09:00] itself was genuine
[1:09:02] and it flowed through the real
[1:09:04] branches but when men began to organize
[1:09:08] they grafted in this organization and so
[1:09:11] therefore it brought forth a different
[1:09:13] type of fruit like a baptist and a
[1:09:15] methodist and a presbyterian and you
[1:09:17] understand we understand that they all
[1:09:20] lived
[1:09:21] by the life of god
[1:09:23] yes it's only one life
[1:09:26] and that's why everybody call themselves
[1:09:28] christians
[1:09:29] but what they don't understand is
[1:09:31] because they have grafted in their that
[1:09:33] branch in which they're they're working
[1:09:35] with is a grafted branch
[1:09:38] brother said if that original branch
[1:09:40] would bring forth
[1:09:42] original uh uh uh uh it would bring
[1:09:44] forth original fruit
[1:09:47] right if the
[1:09:49] vine would bring forth the original
[1:09:51] branch
[1:09:52] it would bring forth the original fruit
[1:09:55] see every tree that breaketh not
[1:09:59] go forth good fruit is hewn down and
[1:10:03] cast into the fire
[1:10:05] now this is not something that you can
[1:10:08] contemplate and reason with
[1:10:11] you either bring forth good fruit
[1:10:13] or bad fruit
[1:10:15] and how can i bring forth good fruit if
[1:10:17] there's nothing good in me
[1:10:20] hallelujah and if you understand who is
[1:10:22] the tree of life it means that you must
[1:10:25] allow him to be planted in us
[1:10:28] hallelujah it's like it's like what the
[1:10:30] scripture says we are now planted in him
[1:10:33] but not only we planted in him he's
[1:10:35] planted in us
[1:10:38] and i'm not going to be long
[1:10:40] but i really want to give everybody some
[1:10:41] thought because this is what i've been
[1:10:43] going through
[1:10:45] you know coming up short but watching
[1:10:47] every move every action
[1:10:50] looking at at the word
[1:10:52] every time i need to say forgive me lord
[1:10:53] forgive me lord
[1:10:55] you know i'm watching everything because
[1:10:57] i want him
[1:10:58] i want the life that's in me
[1:11:00] i want it to grow
[1:11:02] i want it to mature
[1:11:04] into him so i'm saying lord kill me let
[1:11:07] me rock dive whatever i need to do in
[1:11:10] order for you to have full control
[1:11:12] right i want god to have complete
[1:11:16] control now you say what that has to do
[1:11:18] with it this is what
[1:11:22] the secrets of of this message one of
[1:11:24] the things anyway
[1:11:27] even it's all through the scriptures
[1:11:28] i've mentioned it before in esther right
[1:11:32] remember esther
[1:11:33] the king wasn't even speaking to her
[1:11:36] there was a period of silence
[1:11:39] and there was a need and let me tell you
[1:11:41] something brother i'm saying we need
[1:11:43] desperation
[1:11:45] to put us in place because sometimes
[1:11:47] when when things are not pressured us we
[1:11:49] we're lazy we become dilatory
[1:11:53] we know the time is coming we see all
[1:11:55] around us some things happening that we
[1:11:57] cannot explain other than this is the
[1:11:59] last days
[1:12:01] we see it
[1:12:02] but there's this law the slow motion
[1:12:05] type thing that's working with us you
[1:12:07] know like we've got tomorrow we don't
[1:12:09] have tomorrow tomorrow is not promised
[1:12:12] to us
[1:12:13] and the bible says
[1:12:15] the day that you hear his voice harden
[1:12:17] out your heart
[1:12:24] i'm not sick i ate peanuts
[1:12:28] that's what i'm working with now so
[1:12:30] don't you think i'm bringing nothing to
[1:12:32] the church other than the word of god
[1:12:37] see that was a little silence
[1:12:39] [Laughter]
[1:12:42] amen god is good to us amen
[1:12:45] so we understand that what god what what
[1:12:48] happened and you heard me say this once
[1:12:50] before
[1:12:52] that when it came
[1:12:54] to esther
[1:12:56] there was an inspiration
[1:12:57] that struck her
[1:13:00] if i perished let me perish
[1:13:03] she was going to see the king when he
[1:13:05] didn't even call
[1:13:08] for her
[1:13:11] you see we understand that this message
[1:13:13] called our name because our names were
[1:13:16] placed on the lands of the life that's
[1:13:17] why we answer it
[1:13:19] that's why we believe it we may not even
[1:13:22] be living it right now but we know that
[1:13:24] it's right
[1:13:26] see and that life that's all that's uh
[1:13:28] has already recognized you and that's
[1:13:31] what people say oh if i make it you've
[1:13:33] already made it
[1:13:36] once you answer the call
[1:13:39] that makes sense
[1:13:41] let's put it this way amen
[1:13:43] here was esther
[1:13:45] and she goes into the king's chamber
[1:13:49] now understand when the king is on the
[1:13:51] throne it is a it's it's work going on
[1:13:54] he's not sitting up there popping
[1:13:56] peanuts in his mouth no there is a
[1:13:59] political something going on
[1:14:01] and she's interrupting
[1:14:05] hallelujah
[1:14:06] even some of hollywood's movies shows
[1:14:08] that
[1:14:11] that there is a
[1:14:12] business matter going on and she walking
[1:14:15] in
[1:14:17] and she's
[1:14:18] no doubt no doubt she did this way she
[1:14:20] she focused on what she came for
[1:14:23] she she saw the eyes of the king and she
[1:14:26] you know she blotted out everything else
[1:14:29] and when the king
[1:14:31] gave her the scepter you know what that
[1:14:33] was like do you understand why john was
[1:14:36] the way he was
[1:14:38] john had entered into a place
[1:14:41] but john was summoned come on up and
[1:14:42] hear the because i want to want you to
[1:14:44] see something john bride i want you to
[1:14:46] see something
[1:14:49] i want you to see what's taking place
[1:14:52] right here
[1:14:55] and john no doubt
[1:14:57] i don't know scriptures whatever was
[1:14:59] going through his mind but when he saw
[1:15:01] what was happening you know and he
[1:15:03] understood no matter who he was
[1:15:06] if the man the king the one who who
[1:15:09] who's i come to see right the lamb of
[1:15:13] god
[1:15:14] this is what i try to tell people i was
[1:15:16] telling somebody the other day and you
[1:15:18] know uh
[1:15:20] when when when when we come out of
[1:15:22] laodicea because if we're if we've come
[1:15:25] out of there that eagle anointing has
[1:15:28] gone
[1:15:31] and and when john turned around he saw a
[1:15:33] lamb
[1:15:36] the lamb anointing see it's always been
[1:15:39] a lamb
[1:15:40] jesus was the alpha lamb and he's the
[1:15:43] omega lamb jesus don't marry goats
[1:15:48] everything that unions are joined to him
[1:15:51] must be a lamb
[1:15:53] so he came to bring the lamb's nature
[1:15:56] that's why peter said the divine nature
[1:15:59] of god
[1:16:00] this is the lamb's nature and let me
[1:16:02] tell you something the name of nature
[1:16:04] does not come by you acting like a wolf
[1:16:11] it's surrender
[1:16:12] this whole thing is about surrender
[1:16:16] esther didn't come in into the king with
[1:16:18] a hands on her hips
[1:16:21] wagging her fingers like today no she
[1:16:24] came in the garments that was prepared
[1:16:26] for her
[1:16:27] a garment of praise a garment of
[1:16:30] thanksgiving a garment of humility
[1:16:34] and she approached the king that way
[1:16:37] and because he saw the character of this
[1:16:40] woman knowing her life was in danger
[1:16:45] she came before him and no doubt his
[1:16:47] character
[1:16:48] uh
[1:16:49] him seeing her character you know just
[1:16:51] lifted him so much and i don't know what
[1:16:53] all went on and what was going on but
[1:16:55] all of a sudden he sticks out the
[1:16:57] scepter
[1:16:58] and you may have heard me say this but
[1:17:00] that scepter was like a type of the book
[1:17:04] take the book
[1:17:07] and you say well that's not correct let
[1:17:09] me say it like this if you remember in
[1:17:11] in the word of god brother brown says it
[1:17:13] like this he said the seventh seal and
[1:17:16] the mysteries of the seven seas and i'm
[1:17:18] kind of paraphrasing but if you need me
[1:17:20] to get that quote for you i will he says
[1:17:22] it's throughout the whole bible
[1:17:24] in shadows and types
[1:17:27] so if we want to see what god has always
[1:17:29] hid it was about his bride
[1:17:33] everything
[1:17:34] and her reunion are reading uniting with
[1:17:38] her husband
[1:17:39] oh yes
[1:17:41] because remember
[1:17:42] amen even when abraham went went down to
[1:17:46] that uh into egypt where he shouldn't
[1:17:48] have gone
[1:17:49] the king saw
[1:17:51] sarah and he wanted to marry
[1:17:55] but god said it ain't going to happen
[1:17:57] you better not touch you
[1:17:59] you see what i'm saying so that's the
[1:18:02] that's the law that god has protecting
[1:18:04] us
[1:18:05] satan cannot touch us
[1:18:09] that's the word
[1:18:11] whatever you do to them touch not the
[1:18:13] oil and the wine
[1:18:14] you're not talking about this now
[1:18:16] because many people died for this christ
[1:18:20] and understand christ in every age
[1:18:23] unfolds himself more and more right
[1:18:26] because remember in the age of uh of uh
[1:18:30] the the lion amen down there where where
[1:18:33] paul was he was a roaring lion
[1:18:35] and we know that paul was faith
[1:18:39] and those virtues you know each virtues
[1:18:42] coming through the church ages it's the
[1:18:44] statue what of a perfect man is that
[1:18:46] what brother and preach
[1:18:47] that's what he preached
[1:18:49] and to be honest with you it's not
[1:18:51] something we have options for
[1:18:53] oh if i i might get there you can't mike
[1:18:57] you got to get there
[1:18:59] and by the grace of god you'll get there
[1:19:02] but we must learn what are the things
[1:19:04] that jesus did if the scripture's there
[1:19:07] he opened not his mouth
[1:19:11] you see what i'm saying this thing gets
[1:19:13] us in more trouble than anything else
[1:19:17] hallelujah
[1:19:19] the bible says a man can't control his
[1:19:21] tongue his religion is in vain
[1:19:26] this is what defiles you
[1:19:28] it's not what goes in is what comes out
[1:19:32] and no doubt the devil slapped and spat
[1:19:35] on them did everything they could to
[1:19:36] jesus for him to break that scripture
[1:19:39] but he was the word
[1:19:44] y'all know we're testing we're being
[1:19:46] tested every day
[1:19:48] tried on every hand
[1:19:50] but we must understand if we are
[1:19:54] part if we are the body of christ the
[1:19:56] bible says jesus christ is the head of
[1:19:58] the body
[1:19:59] which is the head of the church
[1:20:01] you can't function without his mind
[1:20:05] we need his mind
[1:20:07] we need his mind the way he thinks
[1:20:11] and if you don't read your bible and
[1:20:13] know your bible how can you have the
[1:20:14] mind
[1:20:16] because this bible is his mind
[1:20:18] in a letter form so you and i must
[1:20:21] understand it's not enough people says
[1:20:23] listen i am in the message listen oh my
[1:20:25] god see the pentecostals thought they
[1:20:28] were the ultimate
[1:20:30] they did why because they had everything
[1:20:33] the scripture says they had
[1:20:36] the only thing they didn't have was a
[1:20:37] prophet
[1:20:39] but all the other gifts they had
[1:20:41] and then when the prophet came they
[1:20:42] didn't want him
[1:20:46] and they failed to see they didn't have
[1:20:47] the revelation of who that was
[1:20:49] it was the evening time
[1:20:52] it was marriage time
[1:20:54] it was union time
[1:20:57] and god selected different ones out of
[1:21:00] that age to unite with him for the
[1:21:03] resurrection
[1:21:04] now you understand when everybody die
[1:21:07] those who are christians who are really
[1:21:08] christians they go to the sixth
[1:21:11] dimension
[1:21:12] but you see the sixth dimension don't
[1:21:14] make you complete
[1:21:16] seven makes you complete
[1:21:18] and that's when jesus says i will call
[1:21:20] you as i said in my father's throne i
[1:21:22] will allow you
[1:21:24] overcomers to sit in my throne as i've
[1:21:28] said in my father's story y'all know
[1:21:29] what i'm saying so you got to understand
[1:21:31] the rapture takes us up higher
[1:21:37] oh i get excited
[1:21:39] because i want you to understand like uh
[1:21:42] i
[1:21:43] i was going to preach
[1:21:45] second part of uh you know the
[1:21:47] omnipotent message but you know i
[1:21:49] thought you know what how you going to
[1:21:50] get omnipotent how are you going to
[1:21:51] allow that to come in if you're not
[1:21:54] allowing god to mold and make you
[1:21:57] we we complain too much
[1:22:00] we do all of us
[1:22:02] we complain
[1:22:05] and most of the time it's over stuff
[1:22:07] that has no value
[1:22:09] you know we're going to die or we're
[1:22:11] going to live
[1:22:13] you make you know what i'm saying
[1:22:15] and people i know uh uh some people who
[1:22:18] you know they they they they they just
[1:22:20] love their success and their money and
[1:22:23] all of this and i'm thinking
[1:22:25] for what
[1:22:28] if you read the bible the bible said
[1:22:30] that rich
[1:22:31] young ruler says i'm gonna retire and
[1:22:33] take ease and oh i'm gonna have a great
[1:22:35] time
[1:22:38] death knocks on the door and says you
[1:22:40] fool
[1:22:44] it's a foolish thing
[1:22:45] to prepare to live in this world and
[1:22:48] forget to prepare for the world to come
[1:22:52] it makes no sense
[1:22:54] every man dies
[1:22:56] every woman dies but listen if you you
[1:22:59] know this is the story of a pentecostal
[1:23:01] woman who came at the end of her story
[1:23:03] at the end of her life and found out she
[1:23:05] was lost
[1:23:07] and she said to the pastor amen you
[1:23:09] prepared me for this life
[1:23:12] but you failed to prepare me for the
[1:23:14] life to come
[1:23:15] and this is what we're trying to do
[1:23:17] prepare people for the life to come
[1:23:19] because you're going to lay down one way
[1:23:22] or the other
[1:23:23] or you're going to be raptured whichever
[1:23:25] come first
[1:23:27] but make sure your priorities are in the
[1:23:29] right place
[1:23:32] hallelujah we don't want to die
[1:23:36] sinfully
[1:23:38] or with a sinful nature your nature must
[1:23:41] change
[1:23:42] i often wonder how did god help those
[1:23:45] those animals in the days of noah
[1:23:48] because god was in the ark the nature
[1:23:50] had to be changed
[1:23:52] that's why the is that right because at
[1:23:55] the end of the day the lion shall lay
[1:23:57] down with the lamb
[1:23:58] why is it because god will be present
[1:24:04] when god is in you it brings a lamb
[1:24:06] nature
[1:24:08] you understand me that's what he does
[1:24:09] that's what the holy ghost is all about
[1:24:12] it's the truth even john said behold the
[1:24:16] lamb of god
[1:24:18] he's always been a lamb
[1:24:21] behold the lamb of god and if he was a
[1:24:24] lamb of god then he's the lamb of god
[1:24:27] now
[1:24:28] y'all understand me and we who are born
[1:24:31] of him must be lambs
[1:24:34] and you've heard me repeat that so many
[1:24:35] times
[1:24:37] it was a lamb's book that means the
[1:24:39] story's about lambs
[1:24:42] okay you kind of slope on that one but
[1:24:44] it's true
[1:24:46] ain't no goats in this book is all about
[1:24:48] lambs
[1:24:50] from cover to cover
[1:24:52] right
[1:24:53] now i told you i wasn't going to be long
[1:24:55] but i'm bringing a thought to you
[1:24:57] because he said you make the tree good
[1:24:59] or you make it evil
[1:25:01] and what we must understand is
[1:25:03] these natures that that we've the nature
[1:25:06] we've been bought with uh born with will
[1:25:08] always fight the real one
[1:25:11] just like the brother said uh the chief
[1:25:13] said to brother brandon brother ma'am i
[1:25:14] got such a war going on in me
[1:25:16] you know and brother said what's
[1:25:18] happening he says two dogs fighting
[1:25:21] he said which one on when he said the
[1:25:23] one i feed the most
[1:25:24] a black dog and a white dog right
[1:25:27] if you feed evil it's going to get
[1:25:29] stronger than the white dog or the good
[1:25:31] dog
[1:25:32] good dog bad dog good nature bad nature
[1:25:35] long as you got this
[1:25:37] it's going to always war against the
[1:25:39] nature of god it is the enemy of god
[1:25:44] right
[1:25:45] so you say well brother let me say it
[1:25:48] like what brother i'm saying in the
[1:25:49] message you must be born again
[1:25:51] 1961 he 61. he says now
[1:25:55] the approach to this birth
[1:25:57] there is approach to it
[1:25:59] and to be up to to be approached
[1:26:01] this birth you have to go through a
[1:26:04] process
[1:26:05] just like anything that lives
[1:26:08] anything that lives again has got to die
[1:26:12] first
[1:26:13] and you cannot keep your same spirit you
[1:26:16] cannot keep your same habits you cannot
[1:26:20] keep your same thoughts you've got to
[1:26:23] die
[1:26:24] you've got to die like like he died
[1:26:27] you've got to die on his altar like abel
[1:26:30] did with his lamb you've got to die with
[1:26:34] your lamb you've got to die
[1:26:36] die to your own thinking to be born to
[1:26:40] to his thinking
[1:26:41] let the mind that was in christ be in
[1:26:45] you
[1:26:46] you got to think his thoughts
[1:26:48] and now brother sister
[1:26:50] let me say this as as um
[1:26:55] as intelligent as
[1:26:57] i know how to say it
[1:27:00] how can you think his thoughts
[1:27:03] and deny his word
[1:27:05] and yet claim you're born again
[1:27:08] just ask yourself that question how can
[1:27:10] you do it you can't
[1:27:13] if you're born again you got his
[1:27:15] thoughts
[1:27:16] if the mind of christ is in you
[1:27:19] then you are a new creature
[1:27:22] the bible teaches that now you're a new
[1:27:25] creature born by the spirit
[1:27:28] uh uh your
[1:27:30] your spirits your thoughts are dead
[1:27:32] they're so dead until they're they're
[1:27:37] they're crystal like the brass serpent
[1:27:40] or like he died when he the heaven and
[1:27:43] earth and everything witnessed he was
[1:27:46] dead
[1:27:47] um
[1:27:49] see if the mind of christ is in you
[1:27:51] this is the world falling apart
[1:27:54] he said if the mind of christ is in us
[1:27:57] then we'll recognize we'll recognize
[1:28:00] that the word to be true
[1:28:03] and it lives right through us
[1:28:05] you can't help it
[1:28:08] it's christ
[1:28:10] see
[1:28:11] take the life out of a watermelon vine
[1:28:14] and put it into a pumpkin vine in a bare
[1:28:17] watermelon you can't keep it from it
[1:28:20] because the life in it is
[1:28:24] you understand me so if the life of
[1:28:27] christ is in you it must bear christ
[1:28:33] and that's what's really uh uh uh uh
[1:28:36] troubling me if i want to say it like
[1:28:37] this because uh uh we're at a time where
[1:28:41] the life of christ
[1:28:43] should be seen
[1:28:44] more prevalent
[1:28:48] and and and you know you struggle we
[1:28:51] struggle with people coming to the
[1:28:52] church and we struggle but see they
[1:28:54] don't realize the bible said in the day
[1:28:56] that you see
[1:28:58] the approaching
[1:29:00] the coming however you want to say it
[1:29:02] when you see god you say you come
[1:29:05] together the lord
[1:29:07] that's the word
[1:29:09] the prophet of god tells us and i know
[1:29:10] we get late sometime i'm late sometime
[1:29:13] but there is a ministry in coming to
[1:29:15] church on time
[1:29:18] some of us can't help it jobs whatever
[1:29:20] the case may be but we fail to see these
[1:29:22] little things that's what's called the
[1:29:24] vine
[1:29:25] right especially if god is instructing
[1:29:28] you to be on time and you still
[1:29:32] dabble around and don't get there
[1:29:35] but because he lives we live
[1:29:41] you think about it
[1:29:43] as i said let me say it like this and
[1:29:46] you know um
[1:29:48] god always do
[1:29:50] things
[1:29:51] i heard this not long ago which i
[1:29:53] thought was
[1:29:54] absolutely wonderful
[1:29:56] uh dealing with the seventh seal
[1:29:58] and uh one of the brothers the brother
[1:30:01] said that
[1:30:03] when god
[1:30:04] sent abraham abraham sent
[1:30:07] eliza excuse me to get his bride rebecca
[1:30:15] the request was that she would not only
[1:30:18] water give water to the men but water
[1:30:21] the camels too
[1:30:24] there's a quote that says that brother
[1:30:25] branham brother bannon said it like this
[1:30:27] he said
[1:30:29] god got to rebecca
[1:30:31] about a half hour early
[1:30:37] that's how she knew
[1:30:40] what to do
[1:30:45] what was it it was a
[1:30:46] connection see what people don't
[1:30:48] understand is that this message in which
[1:30:50] god is bringing to us
[1:30:52] amen is a connection with the unseen god
[1:30:58] and god will not be happy until god
[1:31:01] becomes
[1:31:02] our headship
[1:31:05] he and not just not your savior he must
[1:31:08] become our lord
[1:31:12] and so anyway i thought he says listen
[1:31:15] all abraham said to rebecca
[1:31:18] just water my candles
[1:31:21] but she took the inspiration
[1:31:23] from the angel of the lord
[1:31:26] a half hour before
[1:31:29] i get excited
[1:31:31] because really the reason why i get
[1:31:33] excited because in some another place
[1:31:35] brother said that same camel that that
[1:31:38] rebecca rode was a type of the holy
[1:31:41] spirit
[1:31:42] and she watered it in other words she
[1:31:44] wasn't in no dry service
[1:31:47] she watered the camels that was the
[1:31:49] power to take her there
[1:31:52] that's why god said i would that you'll
[1:31:53] be hot
[1:31:54] or cold
[1:31:59] you don't have to worry about god
[1:32:00] spewing you out of your mouth if you're
[1:32:02] not laodicea
[1:32:04] that's what the prophet
[1:32:06] job was to do he was the one indicted
[1:32:08] her
[1:32:10] god through him
[1:32:11] found her wanted found her guilty
[1:32:15] and when that happened guess what
[1:32:16] happened they put him out
[1:32:18] they shut him all out all uh the
[1:32:21] pentecostal ramp church shut him down
[1:32:23] shut him out
[1:32:25] and they didn't know that was revelation
[1:32:28] 3
[1:32:29] jesus
[1:32:30] standing at the door
[1:32:31] trying to get in
[1:32:34] he always did things in secret
[1:32:37] except for the bride she gets it she
[1:32:39] understands it and she don't even know
[1:32:41] why she understands it
[1:32:44] what made uh ruth
[1:32:47] follow naomi
[1:32:50] she was a priestess
[1:32:53] no doubt she had it nice and good and
[1:32:55] evil i mean good over there
[1:32:57] but somehow something made her follow
[1:33:00] and i don't know whether her husband
[1:33:01] just taught her the scriptures how it
[1:33:03] was but whatever he did or whatever god
[1:33:06] did she knew
[1:33:10] that naomi's god was god
[1:33:14] see
[1:33:15] and what we must understand is that the
[1:33:18] more the closer we are the closer we get
[1:33:21] to him the more we become like him
[1:33:25] right
[1:33:28] think on this once again
[1:33:30] therefore if any man be in christ
[1:33:33] he is a new creature
[1:33:37] and i'm going to tell you like like it
[1:33:38] is we're at a time god is looking
[1:33:42] for total control
[1:33:45] total control
[1:33:47] where he can trust you
[1:33:50] no matter what you go through
[1:33:53] god never
[1:33:54] never stopped having faith in in in job
[1:33:58] he said no
[1:33:59] that he's perfect
[1:34:01] i know it
[1:34:03] don't you want god to know you like that
[1:34:06] that no matter what you go through he
[1:34:08] knows you're going to stay with the word
[1:34:12] we must you say well oh oh brother
[1:34:14] brooks what are you trying to say oh
[1:34:17] keep watering
[1:34:20] the camel
[1:34:22] you keep watering the message and why
[1:34:24] don't you see how you be not i know
[1:34:26] everybody no changes is happening in
[1:34:28] them
[1:34:31] how many all witnessed can witness i can
[1:34:33] witness
[1:34:34] that god is changing me
[1:34:37] now i'm not saying that to say it i'm
[1:34:39] just telling you it's real
[1:34:42] there are great changes happening in me
[1:34:44] and i'm excited about it because i know
[1:34:47] that's the mystery he said in that day
[1:34:50] you'll know that i'm in father the
[1:34:51] father's in me and i am in you and i
[1:34:54] know i can't change the things that's
[1:34:56] happening in me only god can do it and
[1:34:58] he's doing it
[1:35:03] he's doing it
[1:35:05] failures i've had my share every one of
[1:35:08] us have but i've seen victory recently
[1:35:11] victorious victory over this victory
[1:35:13] over there and i know it's god it's not
[1:35:15] me
[1:35:17] because god when he takes the desire for
[1:35:19] sin or anything out of you like that you
[1:35:21] don't have to be tempted or tried
[1:35:24] you understand me because it's not yeah
[1:35:26] he said like say it by brother he said
[1:35:29] he said
[1:35:30] it'll get come to the place it may be
[1:35:32] paraphrasing where the devil won't even
[1:35:34] know what to do with you
[1:35:37] he doesn't try he's tried everything he
[1:35:39] can he knows his old tricks and you pay
[1:35:42] him no attention
[1:35:44] because you're so in love with your lord
[1:35:47] people this is a beautiful message we
[1:35:49] are actually in the headstone we we
[1:35:51] don't have much time you know but let go
[1:35:53] and let god don't be afraid of failures
[1:35:57] you can never be successful without a
[1:35:59] failure
[1:36:02] it's god teaching us
[1:36:05] it's god in us
[1:36:06] let him speak to us
[1:36:08] and and you know uh god will always
[1:36:12] cause you to do things that makes no
[1:36:14] sense in the to the natural man
[1:36:21] elijah
[1:36:22] throw a piece of wood in that river and
[1:36:24] that axe head gonna come up
[1:36:29] scientifically impossible
[1:36:32] but with god all things are possible
[1:36:36] that's what i'm saying we go through
[1:36:37] these trials and we get pushed up
[1:36:39] against the wall but let me tell you
[1:36:40] something god is always there with us
[1:36:43] but he needs your faith to activate him
[1:36:46] because without faith it's impossible to
[1:36:48] please god
[1:36:50] you say oh brother brooks i'm saved by
[1:36:52] grace the word is your grace
[1:36:56] you understand me and obedience to the
[1:36:58] word
[1:37:00] is your grace
[1:37:01] because that's that's that's what we
[1:37:03] don't understand the covenants of god
[1:37:06] and god has promised us
[1:37:08] that's what i love about the promises
[1:37:10] when god promised you something it must
[1:37:13] come to pass
[1:37:15] let's stand
[1:37:25] the second weekend of
[1:37:28] september
[1:37:30] the first weekend i'll be gone but the
[1:37:31] second week and i'll be here
[1:37:34] but we have a brother caleb duron from
[1:37:38] arizona who'll be ministering for us
[1:37:40] during that time he's an old friend of
[1:37:42] our mind he has been here once
[1:37:44] or twice
[1:37:46] to minister once you see him you will
[1:37:47] know him
[1:37:49] and uh i've ministered at his church
[1:37:51] several times
[1:37:52] the third weekend of september i my wife
[1:37:55] and i will be traveling to
[1:37:57] uh brother stephen shelley
[1:38:00] and uh then after that i'll be here by
[1:38:02] god's grace i a brother asked me to come
[1:38:04] preach for him in november uh but i have
[1:38:07] not yet responded to him because i'm
[1:38:09] waiting to hear from the lord and if god
[1:38:11] don't want me to go i will not go i know
[1:38:14] i have responsibilities here as well
[1:38:18] but i want to say this by god's
[1:38:21] grace you pray for me
[1:38:23] and i pray for you
[1:38:26] that's the way it works
[1:38:28] this thing is you know it's real
[1:38:30] it's real
[1:38:32] and and the thing is
[1:38:33] uh we just as message believers we just
[1:38:36] gotta this thing i don't know
[1:38:39] how to put it i just say that
[1:38:42] there's a difference
[1:38:43] when you really love god
[1:38:46] you know you go to churches and i every
[1:38:48] church every system uh has three kinds
[1:38:51] of believers
[1:38:53] you know
[1:38:54] and and you and i must understand we
[1:38:56] must take inventory to make sure which
[1:38:58] one we are
[1:39:01] and
[1:39:02] i think within myself that says lord
[1:39:06] i know the prophet god said it's going
[1:39:07] to be a few
[1:39:11] but i can't
[1:39:12] i can't allow myself
[1:39:15] the only way i you know it
[1:39:17] we know predestination is
[1:39:20] based upon our choosing
[1:39:22] that's what he did
[1:39:24] you know he he knew by the from the
[1:39:26] foundation of the choices we would make
[1:39:28] and and what we would do with it
[1:39:32] now he he knew we were going to all mess
[1:39:34] up
[1:39:36] we came in here as failures
[1:39:38] but we have the greatest
[1:39:41] opportunity now
[1:39:43] we have the greatest of all invitations
[1:39:46] let's not be like israel when jesus was
[1:39:48] on the scene and he was calling them all
[1:39:50] to the marriage of the lamb or the to
[1:39:52] the wedding supper and and they all made
[1:39:54] excuses
[1:39:56] that's what happening people let me tell
[1:39:58] you something it's the devil
[1:40:00] to get you a job to get you so busy that
[1:40:03] you don't have time to pray
[1:40:05] that you don't have time to read your
[1:40:07] bible it is and you say well i'm a
[1:40:09] christian because i go to church i pay
[1:40:10] my time that's not a christian
[1:40:13] that's not christianity is life
[1:40:16] it's god living in you that's what
[1:40:19] christianity is don't let the devil fool
[1:40:21] you that's why i say you gotta have an
[1:40:23] understanding
[1:40:24] we all
[1:40:25] when i say it like this may not be able
[1:40:27] to do great signs and wonders but one
[1:40:30] thing for certain
[1:40:31] he said you will know
[1:40:33] don't fool yourself
[1:40:35] you will know
[1:40:36] in that day
[1:40:37] i'm in the father the father's in me and
[1:40:40] i am in you he didn't say you will hope
[1:40:42] it no you will know
[1:40:45] make your calling in election shall
[1:40:47] forget about everybody else
[1:40:51] and concentrate on you
[1:40:53] because nobody can help you
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:56] at the end of the day
[1:40:58] when you get ready to cross over they
[1:40:59] could your mama your daddy everybody
[1:41:01] else can hold your hand
[1:41:03] don't go don't go but when god calls you
[1:41:07] holding your hand is not going to keep
[1:41:09] you here
[1:41:10] y'all understand me and the thing about
[1:41:12] it is once you cross over you can't say
[1:41:15] oh god can i go back let me go back and
[1:41:17] just do better no
[1:41:21] it just doesn't work that way
[1:41:25] i think there's going to be a lot of
[1:41:27] people disappointed
[1:41:29] because of their
[1:41:30] religion because they think they had it
[1:41:33] and we hear brother madam said the
[1:41:34] lutheran they had it
[1:41:37] but they did
[1:41:38] the wesleyans thought they had all of
[1:41:40] them you know because some lutherans
[1:41:42] made it some wesleyans made it some
[1:41:45] pentecostals made it
[1:41:47] but then there was that group
[1:41:49] who thought because they had a religion
[1:41:51] that they could hide behind that that
[1:41:53] was going to give them a token in uh uh
[1:41:56] it's always been the life
[1:41:58] it always will be the life
[1:42:00] and you and i we're at a place where we
[1:42:02] must produce divine love
[1:42:06] brotherly kindness was the pentecostal
[1:42:08] age
[1:42:09] brotherly love
[1:42:11] is where we are now
[1:42:13] and this love
[1:42:14] goes beyond anything you can imagine
[1:42:19] because once you love god you're going
[1:42:20] to love everybody else
[1:42:22] that's the way it works
[1:42:25] you'll be able to put up with stuff
[1:42:27] when people mistreat you you're going to
[1:42:29] love them anyway
[1:42:30] no bitterness will enter into that place
[1:42:34] the life either make the tree good
[1:42:37] or make it
[1:42:40] brother said that's one of the worst
[1:42:42] things he said i would i'd rather appear
[1:42:44] before god as a sinner
[1:42:46] than a hypocrite
[1:42:48] that's the way i feel too lord don't let
[1:42:50] me be a hypocrite
[1:42:52] let's pray
[1:42:54] father we come before you lord as

[1:52:40] oh
[1:52:42] [Music]
[1:52:53] is
[1:52:59] oh god bless you
[1:53:02] um
[1:53:02] i was in boston
[1:53:04] uh this this past weekend
[1:53:07] our for a friend was getting married
[1:53:09] and um
[1:53:11] i did not know that there was supposed
[1:53:13] to be a hurricane
[1:53:14] in boston and so
[1:53:16] i was kind of surprised and um
[1:53:19] also
[1:53:20] i was i was really too worried for
[1:53:22] myself but i was more worried for my
[1:53:23] friend because i just felt like
[1:53:26] what what it feels like to prepare for a
[1:53:28] wedding for such a long time and you
[1:53:30] have to cancel it because of the
[1:53:31] hurricane
[1:53:32] and they even had the governor who um
[1:53:36] he told everybody to just stay at home
[1:53:38] and not go like to the outside or
[1:53:41] anything like that so i was really
[1:53:42] feeling sorry for my friend but then as
[1:53:44] christians remember that we still serve
[1:53:46] a guy who can
[1:53:48] calm the storm or the hurricane or
[1:53:50] nothing or anything like that so i just
[1:53:52] prayed the night before before the
[1:53:55] hurricane
[1:53:56] that god would like
[1:53:58] make it go past us and go he could go
[1:54:01] other places but just not for the not
[1:54:03] for the wedding
[1:54:04] and then uh in the morning when i woke
[1:54:06] up it was downgraded to a tropical storm
[1:54:09] and then after a few hours nothing
[1:54:11] happened so at other areas of the
[1:54:14] hurricane
[1:54:16] i think it's people like thousands of
[1:54:18] people still still don't have power
[1:54:20] and but god was merciful and then um he
[1:54:23] allowed that we still had a wedding and
[1:54:25] no rain nothing at all so i give glory
[1:54:27] to god
[1:54:32] we thank the lord for that
[1:54:34] it sings the song because he leaves
[1:54:36] tomorrow before we dismiss amen
