back amen don't i don't want to be one of those that sits on my sits down and says well i i wish this was a better worship service this is your channel as much honor as you want to give my son plays in the marching band at his high school mom julia music don't don't and they do special maneuvers as they march while they're playing their instruments and their marvel as they weave wind walking amongst each other while they're marching back the anthem of the united states of america as good as the rest of the songs they sang once when they sung that song played that they took off the sacrifices that we take for granted to celebrate a day back in 1776 when a group of men gathered together stating that these united and these men as they signed this declaration were signing their own death warrants and that declaration that they signed therefore he deserves all the glory yeah no he he deserves all the honor he may reach to do we deserve all the praise he deserves us to come in here with reverence to stand up on our feet to reach down into our own hearts and disciples he is the one that wrote the declaration whether you will be free or not poorly psalms 23. we're going to read read a statement by a great warrior on now as we're going to read all six verses of psalm 23. foreign he did not write this at the beginning of his journey he did not write this as a young man standing in the field as a shepherd [Music] as he looked back to the grace of god that followed him all the days of his life he was able to describe that journey in six short verses and through this you can see that our lord deserves all the glory verse one starts without sin the lord is my shepherd i shall not want. he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he left me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he layeth me in the past of righteousness though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death [Music] he prepares a table before me in the presence my head with oil you want to eat my tent my cup runneth over in my coop surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord just before we sit down let's let's turn over to psalms psalms 107. verse 42 and 43. king david again begins to write and he says the righteous shall see it and rejoice even they shall understand [Music] we've been called into your presence every one of us having an opportunity second autonomous opportunity to whatever to bring whatever we will present unto you lord i just pray father for we going to give you all the glory and the honor and the praise in the name of jesus christ we pray you send yourself amen david as he wrote those six short verses every verse from that song was based upon an experience that he had back in his life young man we have older men there's all of you we have young women we have older women we have um children sitting here who have not gone through some of the deep trials of life but yeah they themselves have also gone through trials every single one of us has our life experience it doesn't mean that you're going to have an easy life every single one of us goes to those times where everything seems to begin to fall apart where you find yourself in places that you don't want to be uh you find yourself experiencing things that you wish you didn't have to experience and you look up and you begin to look at the promises of the scriptures and you say lord i need a fresh experience of those promises when you look at a promise in the scripture it seems like it's just a little bit out of your reach and you you wish there was something you could stand on so you could get up there and reach it god's children get to those places and it's not a strange thing that god's children get there this shows the shows um the bible is full of stories of men and women that are put in tight places where their own bodies were failing them or things that they wanted to do they wanted to go to the right parties but god told them to turn around and go to the left i like to think about jonah when he first began to it's not that he didn't know jehovah jehovah he was a man that knew jehovah it's not that he didn't know the scriptures oh no no he knew the scripture and it's not that he didn't know the voice of the lord because not only did he know who he was and he knew that he was a prophet ordained of the lord and he knew the voice of jehovah couldn't see but when their voice came to him and told him to go to the right what he turned around until you begin to turn around and look down inwardly in your own lives and as soon as you begin to consider your own ways and your own thoughts becomes we get down to those times in our lives god likes to put you in a certain place and sometimes he'll just remove his presence away from you you say god will do that yes god will do that you'll be going along for for a while in such a path for so long just enjoying the blessings of the lord and join the presence of the lord and the blessings are flowing down where did the presence of the lord go you open your bible and you're just like i i don't even know where to read it and you you go to the altar in prayer it seems like the windows of heaven are closed how did i get here how did i get to this place why why is like a jesus set on the cross my god my god why has that happened you know god's children get to those you're harping against the cry out for just a moment in the presence of the lord [Music] that's what samson sung as he is slaving he didn't give all the glory and the honor unto the lord inaudible he had forgotten where his his power came from and the very thing that gave him that power the moment he woke up he says i'm going to go out and win the battle just like i've always wanted to come when the enemy began to afflict him they can't leave he went to break those ropes that were tied his arms behind him [Music] every time he'd been tied up in the past yeah and the victories that he is to win now he is the one that was being overthrown as he was slaving away for the enemy a community [Music] begin [Music] where you begin to neglect the power of god you begin to neglect the the times you have in prayer you can begin to neglect the sacrifice of prayer [Music] to gain respect back for the presence of the lord when david was a man like that you know there is a reason that he is able to write the things that he wrote but in every trial that he had been through you know passing that he knew what his duty was and the power of god behind that company and that the power of god would win the battle for him unto the man whose soul needs to be restored and doesn't know that the lord is the one he needs to seek after and eternity ask anyone who's been a christian long enough who's been into the deep trials of life [Music] and tell you what do you do when you get to those places and they'll tell you an experience about how their entire body was failing and then they'll tell you a story about how the presence of the lord came into the situation that's how they took that situation they just put it upon the altar [Music] and no matter what you do you just can't seem to get to get the victory when you think back that there was a time when you were young there was a time when you were well yeah there was a time when you didn't have to worry about this there was a time where you didn't have to worry about this part of your body or that part of your body and we have a restoration that has been promised to us one of these days in a moment in a twinkling of an evening i'm gonna be changed and this mortal body shall put on immortality oh abraham experienced it experienced since a young man he'd never have been able to have children and then he had grown old and as he was an old man now god came into the place don't restore them back to a young man all over again and then god restore his ability to have children [Music] [Music] when the enemy is all around you that god prepares him a table where he can eat and drink and have supper yeah uh i don't know if i can find this real quick but in the back of my bible there's a place called the maps like and you know i don't know if you can see this but on this map right here yes you'll see the pink section is a section that shows about a thousand miles of geography it goes pretty much the entire middle east there the promised land is only like half an inch of this little pink area now this peak area is describing the the the middle east in the year 700 b.c and it shows the the the the boundaries of where the syrians had taken over almost the entire from the middle east all the way across down into africa and egypt on africa at this moment in time the map maker here has a little area around jerusalem it's just about two miles square [Music] do do miles uh okay it's a little circle that has no peakness in it at all and as they were marching and conquering and they had jerusalem completely surrounded and in the midst of this time it's the time of king hezekiah we have taken over every capital that you even know about news about concrete whatever the prophets of jehovah all that was left was this little walled city of jerusalem but then came a prophet of the most high god don't you fear nepal his eyes every every city within 500 miles of them any direction now the enemy had come and surrounded their cities but jehovah says i will fight trying to get out of there a stampede uh they marched they ran they fled they ran as fast as they could have now when a people has experienced something like that they call it experience they get they are to get to a place where they they trust in the lord so much it's like the time when peter had was uh was uh peter was going to the city of jerusalem to come so he went back to jesus jesus and jesus said uh you know gave him the little story about the taxes he said so that we don't offend these people so that we can pay this tax so we don't have money for it i want you to go get your fishing pole and go down to the river and inside the mouth of that fish there will be two coins for the taxes to pay the taxes one coin for me and one coin for you you are do do uh do uh do ps uh i'm sure he's thinking lord this seems a little strange it seems a little odd but he had seen enough it had enough experiences with the lord he had seen his god in battle enough that there was just something deep down inside of him yeah there's just protect your shoes or paw paw or when he saw those coins they come to those places where they just trust the lord is 107 verse 43. and it said whoso is wise and we'll observe these things even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the lord in psalms 107. there's four stories in here and each story is a story about someone who went through a deep trial passes to a point and they got to a point where they couldn't help themselves and somehow they got themselves into a situation where they could no longer help themselves and they got to a place where the only thing that they could do if talks about the children of israel in verse 3 it says and he gathered them out of the lands from the east from the north it says and they wandered in the wilderness they found no city to dwell in village verse 5 says hungry and thirsty their soul fated in them now think about they left egypt they were in slavery but at least their food was provided for them some of them are thinking maybe we should go back and trust in the egyptians we are in the midst of the camp there's always that witness they'll stand up and say no but the god they left the wilderness behind he's only seen and now all they realize that all the glory and the honor and the praise belongs under jehovah oh they couldn't sing that song when egypt was feeding them onto verse 8 it says oh that men might praise the lord for his goodness for his wonderful works because he satisfies the longings he fills the hungry soul with goodness he does that saints he faces son he does that you face him he puts us in these places in our lives do we have a deep desire for something or it talks about those that are uh in prison or in sickness it says such a sit in darkness in the shadow of death [Music] says in verse 11 because they rebelled against the words of god oh they did something they shouldn't have done visa vision [Music] has brought them into afflictions and they deserve it and you can blame people for their trials because they deserve it but then when you begin to look inwardly regardless because when you think that you're standing in your own strength when we get to those places in our lives where we've done things that we ought not to do and we begin to pay the price for our own iniquities and the the payment for our iniquities comes back to us for the words that we said that we shouldn't have said since [Music] but when we begin to pay the price for our attitudes attitude then we begin to look up to the lord cry out to god for help and that's where it says verse 12. therefore he brought down their heart with labor illumina they fell down and there was none to help them [Music] oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness for his wonderful works amen for he has broken the gates of brazil he's cut the bars of iron people get to those places in their lives sometimes even because they deserve it and anybody that's been a christian long enough can't think about the sins that we've committed iniquities that we've committed fable brother brandon preach that sermon perfect strength by perfect weakness [Music] there was times he prayed for the sick and he didn't feel like praying for the sick yeah there's times he got there to preach sermons yeah would you pray for me and you reach out your hand and you pray for him and the next sunday they come to you and they say brother when you pray for me god healed me [Music] i thank lord despite of my own weakness make me a feminist despite my own even they will understand i love reading the psalms because i love reading about king david he was a man who had been through a lot of deep trials when you begin in the first and second verse he says i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cries amen he had a need but he waited patiently he had a need but he prayed in and then god in verse two he says he brought me up also out of the horrible pit withhold not thy tender mercies from me o lord let thy loving kindness and thy truth continually preserve me i want you to notice there are the tender mercies and the loving kindness i know i've preached on these before but david spoke often about the loving kindness and tender mercies of the lord and the uh when i was preaching on that several years ago i was looking down at what those words actually meant as you see the component and i was looking at the root words of what was david expressing when he said the loving kindness of the lord now if god has loving kindness yeah we know that he does and that he's given his loving kindness to us that belongs to us it's an inheritance for us and it's as i said in the beginning it's one of those promises that we can reach out and grab a hold of someone [Music] david had a faith here that god wouldn't withhold it from him is something that god has and so when god looks at us an emotion comes over him and that emotion is loving kindness and when he looks it up on us with that emotion it puts god in action you pick them up off the ground you feed them but then you go a little bit further than that [Music] you bring them to your house you let them live in your house and become part of your family you let them be your co-worker at work [Music] and you pick them up and put them on the rock right by your side [Music] and you make them a brother or a companion even when they don't deserve it ma'am call in the indesign and then walk away from us if we if we said why you do new well he picks us up and he adopts [Music] oh you're more than just a son or a daughter to me it comes in this last day and reveals unto us you well he has doesn't give us just love and kindness loving kindness and tender mercies as david was saying in verse 11 there become david this is the only verse he said lord withhold not thou tender thy tender mercies loving kindness and thy truth continually preserve them let's turn over to uh psalms 51. i don't know how or no uh psalms 103 psalms now we're all familiar with psalms 103. david here is rejoicing his heart is overflowing with praise to the lord and he is in such an attitude of worship and praise he begins to speak to his soul to his mind and to his body he says bless the lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name beneath bless the lord o my soul and forget not all of his benefits verse three who forgiveth all thine iniquities oh what are these tender mercies we know what the loving kindness is we know this is our inheritance something that he gave to us that he crowned us he gave to us an inheritance and as a crown the tender mercies of the lord but it's the type of crescent that a pregnant woman does when you see a woman that is pregnant she puts her hand upon her belly it because it don't fall in knee and you say this she holds in her arms she nurses it to help and he said and that emotion that that mother has towards her child is [Music] foreign and when he looks upon us and he has those emotions those emotions cause actions actions towards us that when we get to those areas in our lives or we go through our deep trials or deep desires of life we have the amen amen and whosoever whosoever is wise and will understand these comprehensive shows even they will understand the lovingkindness of the lord it causes the faith to rise up in your hearts like when peter was looking it was great went to go get that fish trying to show him something that down there said you know i don't think i will supply to go do something that will make you trust in me from psalms 107. those that have gone to those deep trials the last story there in psalm 107. it's uh written there in today verse 23 talks about those that go down to the sea and ships they do business in the great waters they they see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep wine don't don't don't don't don't leave don't resume now watch and verse 25 describes something that god does now he command us and raise us the stormy wind is now he's talking about the men in the ship here in verse 20 [Music] and the ship it says as they go down again their soul is melted because of trouble their soul is melted because of trouble they're going up i've been in a boat like this on the great lakes and the waves came in and we're in this little sailboat and we went up and up and up on the wave and then all of a sudden you crest away and you start going down because you're going up for several seconds and now you're going down for seven years i think oh lord those ways to just crash right over and let me be done then they cry unto the lord in their trouble he brings them out of their distresses he maketh the storm so the waves thereof are still so he brings them to their desired heaven oh the men that would praise the lord for his goodness for his wonderful works among the children let them exalt him also in the congregation praise him in the assembly of the elders verse 42 the righteous shall see it zomboid whosoever whosoever is wise and will observe these things even they shall understand the loving kindness these are the people that will come to this understanding where your parents feed you and provide for you maybe haven't experienced the deep sicknesses of life maybe you haven't experienced the deep sicknesses that come in life but the day will come where you grow up and you leave your house and trials begin to come it is important but it's at those points where you begin to realize i need the lord i need this jesus christ [Music] let sickness you begin to experience the power of the almighty god and it's when you get to the end of that story it's that then you can write your own psalms twenty-three soul he leaveth me in the past of righteousness for his namesake though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death in the presence of my enemies thou anoint my hair with oil to wind down my tent my cup is running over in my coop surely goodness and mercy shall follow all when solomon irwin uh john jonah called youness he was going in his own strengths he went running from the presence of the lord he knew what god had told him to do he knew who god was he knew who jehovah was but he went running the other way when god began knocking at his heart's door again the voice of god came to him and they thought they were going to sink and jonah they went down and they wake walk them up they said somebody on this boat ascend this storm has come to us for a reason they said wake up oh sleepers [Music] jewish is choosing that there and he gave me a commandment of something i must do he might do now and i am running from there and they looked at him you know i said why would you do that you are endangering all of our lives and jonah began to realize but they are threatening those around he was in danger of being guilty [Music] of the blood of those that were in the boat with him you saw tie me up limo throw me overboard and let the god of the heavens and the earth the senior of the choosing that have his way with me ace we're no longer that water became his altar i've been waiting for you to surrender and there he was as he was sinking down in the water he only had two minutes left [Music] he'd open his mouth the water would come rushing in he was in a bad place but god prepared me preparing a special place for him i know [Music] his mouth and gas spin and his mind began to drift back to the scriptures his mind began to drift back to the scriptures he said lord solomon once said if any of god's children are in trouble anywhere just let them turn their face towards this holy temple if they get on their knees and they face towards this temple and cry out to the name of jehovah that wherever they are in this life [Music] i don't and the inheritance the scriptures have given me and he got on his knees he reached towards the heavens then you begin [Music] [Music] he amen amen amen i understand these things complements issues i just bow our heads where they can write their own psalms 23. for the trials that they've been through they've been brought to those places where they can no longer help themselves people this is john de person that gets to those places they are the one that understand the overcoming power they are the ones that will be described in the last days the bride of the lord jesus christ how did you overcome my brother [Music] i overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of my testimony let it be unto us lord because because that's what because that's why according to thy word father [Music] your bride trusts only in you know [Music] amen amen amen amen as our brother comes we all have an opportunity opportunity will we trust in the lord every one of us is going to have our hard times in life but jonah said bind my hands and my feet [Music] i'm no longer going to do this in my own strengths throw me at the mercy of jehovah it's in him that i trust three hebrew children [Music] [Music] god [Applause] [Music] me a clean heart [Music] create on me [Music] within me [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] me me the joy of thy salvation [Music] within me [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] unto me [Music] lord cast [Music] oh that
