heavenly father I Surrender myself to you Lord Jes and I Surrender this congregation to you Lord may you only receive the glory Lord and not and not anybody else Lord Jesus Christ Heavenly Father Lord I love the scripture that says that if I be lifted up I will draw all men onto Lord we want to lift you up this morning have the preeminence Lord and bless the reading of your word in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen um let's turn to 1 Samuel chapter 3 we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I think I see sister maida um all the way from Canada welcome and sister shakina chch and I don't know if there's any other visitors okay cool all right um 1 Samuel chapter 3 it reads like this and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open vision and it came to pass at the time when Eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to walk them that he could not see and Air the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord where the Ark of God was and Samuel was laid down to sleep that the Lord called Samuel and he answered here am I and he ran unto Eli and said here am I for thou callest me and he said I call it I called not lay lie down again and he went and lay down and the Lord called yet again Samuel and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said here am I for thou did did call me and he answered I called not my son lie down lay down lie down again now Samuel did not yet know the Lord neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him you know it's interesting that the Lord called Samuel when he did not even yet know the Lord so you don't need to know the Lord for in order for him to call you because he's the one that reveals himself to you he's the one that make himself know to you know let's keep reading and verse S now Samuel did okay verse eight and the Lord called Samuel again the third time and he AR arose and went to Eli and said here am I for thou did call me and Eli perceived that the Lord had called called the child therefore Eli said unto Samuel go uh lie down and it shall be if he called thee that thou shalt say Speak Lord for that servant heareth um so Samuel went and laid down in his place and the Lord and the Lord came and stood and called as at other times Samuel Samuel then Samuel answered saying speak for thy servant heareth oh you may have your seat um we'll have another scripture but before we read there you know something very interesting in verse n he said you know Eli Eli was the high priest you know Eli was the high priest and Samuel was a prophet you Major Prophets do not become prophets they are born Prophets Samuel was born a prophet but yet he did not know the Lord and he needed an elder to teach him on how to instruct him to train him to train him on how to to know the voice of the [Music] Lord when he heard the Lord calling him he actually thought that was Eli that was calling him so the title my title for today um is going to be the voice um of the pillar of fire or you can say the voice of the angel of God the voice of God so um I will read Genesis chapter 1 it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth you know and verse three says and God said let there be light and there was light and verse and God said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters we we notice that the spoken word is what created um the whole universe God's voice is what created you and me God's voice is what created the heavens and the Earth and so going back to the to Samuel the Bible says that the voice the voice of God was precious in those days it was a rare thing in the day of Samuel you know the Bible says there was no open vision and brother bham says that the voice of God is even more precious in our day so don't take the word of God lightly like like keep it in your heart as a precious stone because it's something that's precious and the title is the voice of the pillar of fire what is the pillar of fire you know the prophet explained to us so um usually I have my PowerPoint and slide there but I didn't get the time to prepare all that so I'll rely on the uh brother on the computer to put the quot for me but I'll let you know when I get to that quot brother bam explains what the pillow of fire is he says that when God in the beginning God was just a great the great spirit but you could not see the spirit so God had to he he he the word of God proceeded out out of that great spirit and started to form itself into a a form that that that was visible because in spirit you cannot see the spirit and the prophet says that what came out of God that logos was the pillar of fire so the pillar of fire is God himself in a form that that we can see and and let's let's look in the Bible people that heard so that pillow of fire has a voice that Pillar of Fire speaks know Moses Moses um heard the voice in the in the in the Bush Moses he like he knew that he was supposed to deliver the children of Israel since he was a child and then he tried to uh kill kill the Egyptians and and then they tried to kill him and he fled to the to the Wilderness over there he went in the desert and he and he and he saw a a burning [Music] bush he was curious because that he was curious because that that bush like it it had fire but it was not consuming the and then he wanted to look at that fire and God told him you know the Bible says that when God noticed that Moses wanted to look then the voice spoke like the Moses The Voice Called Moses Moses take off your shoes so that Pillar of Fire had a voice you know he has the Bible God God God God has hands God has God has a mouth he can speak you know so so so when Moses heard the heard the voice God told Moses that I heard the Cry of my people in Egypt and I am come I come I'm coming down to deliver them so that great spirits the great God the logos the pill of fire came out of him and he he met Moses in the in the backside of the desert and he told him that I'm going to delivered Egypt but when um uh God went to Egypt the Egyptians didn't did not see the pillow of fire they saw Moses you know when God was the the prophet even in in another quote he says that after uh uh Moses met the Burning Bush brother says that the pillar of fire came out of that bush and entered into Moses because Moses in in in himself he could not deliver the children of Israel he had to wait on the pillar of fire the prophet of God says that sometimes we try to go before the angel of the Lord and he says that's when we get into trouble Moses thought he he was born he knew his commission since he was a kid his parents brought him well and he thought that with his own power he could deliver the children of Israel and the prophet said that he mesed up but you notice that when he met the pillar of Fire Moses was a changed man when he met the pill of fire Moses did not run from the Egyptians anymore Moses went with a message knowing that the Lord the Lord God was in him no when you meet the pill of fire he'll do the same thing to you pill of fire can change your lives the pill of fire can deliver you from the anxiety the fear that you just got to meet the pillow of fire everybody in the Bible that met the pillow of fire their lives were never the same you know he either the the prophet says he either blinds you or or opens your eyes the Egyptians uh when they were going after the children of Israel the Bible says that the pillar of fire stood between them and and uh the the the children of is he stopped the the the Egyptians from attacking the children of God Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever the children of Israel were in troubl they did not know what to do but the pill of fire came and stood between them and danger and today again if there's a danger in your life call on the on the pillar of fire that Pillar of Fire will stand between you and Satan do not fear the Devil he's coming as a roaring Lon after you but not that the angel of the of the Lord is standing standing between you and evil you just got to meet that Pillar of Fire and all that fear will be gone that that pill of fire allowed the children of Israel to cross the the the it was a challenge that stood before them just like you you may have challenges in front of you and the devil is going because you know every time God blesses you Satan will also try to take that blessing away from you we see that we see that with Daniel Daniel when he started praying uh uh the angel that came to Daniel told him that the moment you started praying God God answered your prayer and he sent me to you but he he he made a resistance the enemy came and started fighting and it took him 21 days to deliver the message to and he said that he had to wait on the on on on Michael to come and help him who was that Michael the prophet says that that Michael was Jesus Christ if if if the angel that needed to deliver the message to Daniel he needed that pillow of fire too whatever trouble you are in you need that pillow of fire amen amen so let's go back to the topic um so like I said the voice of the pillar of fire so Moses heard the voice and in the message the absolute the prophet says not in paragraph 263 not if Moses had the The Fire And he says the fire was in Moses he says because whatever Moses said it wasn't Moses it was God speaking and he performed his sign because the pillar of fire left the bush and come in Moses whatever Moses was speaking it wasn't it was God that was speaking no it was God hid in a man and in in the mount si si you know the children of Israel wanted to hear the voice of God you know they they they they they were just uh they wanted they wanted uh the prophet says they wanted law God gave them Grace but they wanted the law so God told Moses to gather the children and he's going to come down and talk to them you know and when God came down the Bible describes it as he he had it was thunderous like he had a lot of Thunders Lightnings like the mountain words were shaking and the children of Israel were afraid they couldn't even speak to God but I love I think it's in Exodus um 19 I don't remember but yeah Exodus 19 um he said the Bible says that the the children of Israel couldn't speak to God but Moses spoke to God they were so terrified that they told Moses that we don't want to hear the voice of God like that direct they told Moses to to tell God to speak to you and then you come to tell us the word of God and God honed that and from that day God has always used a prophet to speak to his children from that day the prophet became the voice of God to to to the children you know even Amos 3 says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he reveal his Secrets unto his servant Prophet Moses became God's voice to the Israelites that voice that they once heard on Mount Si was was veiled behind the man like the prophet says that the word of God was in Moses so much that even his face was shining like and they had to cover his face and the prophet says that that like um when he was removing the the veil it was blinding the children of Israel and the prophet says that it's the same thing today God God veiled in a man the pillar of fire veiled in a man and it says that that's what blinds the people God in a human being amen for some reason we people people always uh stumble when whenever we talk about God using God in a man you know because it was so in the time of Moses and everything I'm saying today I have I have I have quotes for literally everything I'm saying whenever I get time I read but when I don't get time I just you can go go check it at home so one day Moses saw the he um he wanted to see the glory of God right so he he wanted to see he he asked God to show him his glory you know so all these days Moses always heard he always heard the The Voice he saw the pill of fire but he never saw The Man Behind the pillow of fire and God said okay I will show you but I won't show you my face God showed God showed Moses the back the back part of God and the prophet said he was he was like a man you know because the Bible says that God used his hands to to hide Moses from seeing the face of God so that's why the prophet says God is a is like a man he's a man like he has hands you know he has eyes you know and he has a back you know he has a head you know amen amen all right so let's continue with Moses Mo so there was the time um Moses um he had appointed Elders you know so remember Moses was the word of God to the children of Israel and then he appointed Elders I think 70 or 71 Elders in the Bible you know because uh um his father-in-law suggested to him that instead of you taking the burden of the children of Israel all by yourself why don't you divide uh like choose 71 elders and the prophet said that when Moses picked those 71 Elders a part of God uh went into left Moses and went into those um 71 but brother says that but they still had to refer back to Moses and he said because Moses had thus sayith the Lord he he said Moses had the last word the 71 could represent preachers today I don't want any any preachers that preaches to me any message outside of the voice of God we need to refer back to what brother Bram saying because because brother Bram says that God doesn't use two major prophet at the same time and this is the last age and there was only one Prophet That was supposed to go to the last I don't recall anywhere in the Bible where he mentions two prophets being in the last day so take me back to what brother Bram saying because he also one time he met that pill of Fire pill of fire also entered in him and brought us not the message of brother Bram but the message of God so who are you to correct the prophet people that people that try to correct the prophet I feel like they don't even understand who what the prophet is the prophet is God veiled in a man know who can correct God those 71 Elders they were ministers but the prophet says they still had to refer back to Moses you know amen amen I don't know why today there are so many ministers out there they think they know better than brother brand I think they just need a revelation brother Bram was and then maybe they don't even read their own Bible because if you read your Bible you can clearly see how God started using Prophet prophets are they're not even made like we are I remember brother Brandon one time um I think he went to the doctor or something and the doctor told him that his his body was different than everybody else if you notice in the in in Exodus the when God descended on up on Mount Si you know the children of Israel couldn't even get on on the mountain even even the goats or even the the animals couldn't even touch the mountain the moment they touch it they die but the Bible says Moses went inside the mountain he must have been made differently than all the children of Israel even his body was made different you are not the prophet don't try to take the place of brother BR a prophet is made in a way that he can communicate with God face to face and and I'm not talking about Minor Prophet I'm talking about the ma Prophet prophet brother bam says that each age has it its prophet and the prophet brings the word of God for that age for that generation so he alone has the interpretation of the word of God for that age so if you want to know the will of God for our age refer back to what the prophet don't go on YouTube or like Tik Tok and all those other all those other stuff the word the will of God for our day came from the prophet will and then and then God the God had to vindicate the message of Moses he he Vindicated that message with a pillar of fire and in our day as well he Vindicated the ministry of and then people try to get it confused they think it's the man that's doing all this work remember the prophet says that God veiled in a man is what blinds the people but the key word is it's not the man it's God who ins who is inside the man it's the angel of the Lord that goes and do do do does all those things brother multiple say multiple times said I had nothing to do with it it it wasn't him you know it was the God it was the voice behind the voice brother bam says that I'm I have a quote here I'll get to [Music] that okay let's read this quote um coming from the message the unveiling of God no actually let's go to um take the rod and gather the people so the prophet said the people who crucified Jesus Christ believed in An Almighty God no in religion holy renowned man crucified the Son of God because they did not believe that he was God you know and no matter how much they believed in Jehovah God they can't believe in Jesus being his son in in order to receive anything from God from Jehovah God paragraph six he told the Jews he said as you have believed in God believe also in me the prophet is saying that Jesus Jesus was telling them that the prophet says that the the children of is they believe they believe the word they believe the Bible they believed in everything the Bible said but Jesus is like okay I know you I know you believe in God but believe also in me the word of God made manifest you know and let's keep reading that and uh that's right well now if you will test his message one moment the angel of the Lord told if you get the people to believe you you know get the people to believe you and be sincere when you pray no disease shall stand before the prayer I have proof do you believe me you say I'll believe God well that's what you should do but you can't believe in God and you don't believe in this it won't do you any good brother you can't you you you claim okay I believe the Bible if you believe this Bible and you don't believe what brother tells you any good is that the word I'm not saying my own word I'm repeating what brother said even Jesus said that Jus said I know you believe in God but believe also in me why because because he the pillow of when the pillow of fire came to Moses Moses asking like why will I tell the people who who are you he said he said I am that I am the living bread the word of God present not not God of the past not God of the future but God of the that's what the pill of fire is the pill of fire is not God of the past the pill fire is God right now that's that's why brother bam says believe in me also because the pillow of fire is in him when he has th sayth the Lord and he says verse seven no no no no uh uh uh same thing uh don't believe as one of them but believe they have sent me for this purpose then God then when you believe me you believe what the angel has come from that he is the angel from God you remember in let's go back to Exodus again the children of Israel what were angry God is because they did not believe the message of Moses they were complaining even Paul later on says that they fell short to enter into the rest because of their unbelief and that applies the same thing today if you do not believe the message of William Bram like okay let me just read where he says then when you believe you believe what the angel Has Come For and verse seven I'm just his voice he is a supernatural person I am natural he can bring Supernatural to the Natural man he glorifies speaks his voice he uses my hands he uses my eyes to see Visions he uses my ears just as the Holy Spirit uses you he says I'm just his voice you know amen amen uh in um the message the unveiling of God paragraph 129 brother says Moses coming from the presence of God with the word of God for that age now watch we are now in Exodus 19 don't miss this now Moses is coming from the presence of God he has been into the word the word has been wrote and he in the presence of where am I and he in the presence of God with the word he had the word for that age there is a word for each age just like there is a word for our age you know and Moses come coming forth his face shined the word was in him right ready to be manifested giving out to the people the true word God had wrote it and he was with Moses and he was the words to them he was the Living Word he that logos the prophet says the logos is the word and that that that the word is hid behind a man you know veiled himself you know and uh let me go to he says do you see it wherever the word is it's veiled now remember after the word was made manifest Moses was Moses again so he had times where he he became a normal persones but that's after the word was made manifest but while the word was in him to be G to be given out he was God let not be let not this stumble you when Moses had the word in him to to be given out he became god well he wasn't Moses no more he had the word of the Lord for that age nothing could touch him till that was over so when the when the the the the pillow fire the word got into Moses and when he spoke that word it was the prophet says he wasn't Moses no more you couldn't even touch Moses imagine that you couldn't even touch Moses because he was God to the children of Israel because he had the word of God veiled in the human flesh and uh he says again um um yeah let me read I'll just read two more more quotes here in the message the unveiling of God he says now the world still they don't believe it no matter what they don't see it because it wasn't sent to them remember the Son of God was not revealed to Sodom two Messengers was God God God himself in human flesh was revealed to Abraham the election God in a human flesh was revealed to his elected how was he how was he revealed to Abraham he turned his back from to the tent to from the tent and and then when he gave the promise to Sarah that she was going to have a child she loved in her heart so she did not speak loud and she she laughed in her heart but God heard what what what Sarah said so he was revealing the thoughts of Sarah and then the prophet says that's how God revealed himself to his elected are you the elected if you are the elected that's how God Reve himself to you unless if you don't count yourself to be the elected but why would you why would God reveals God doesn't change if he did that like that no no wonder God says as as he was in the days of lot and Sodom Andor so shall it be in the in the coming of the Son of God in the human flesh revealing the secret of the heart of and remember there's a difference because Prophet says that when when um Moses uh when the word was his Moses that was God but when the word came out that Moses became Moses so he had times where he was just a normal man like us he make mistakes just like us but then you have you had to be you you had to recognize that when the word came in Moses there wases know just like when brother bam was uh when he was uh revealing the the thoughts of the heart of man it wasn't it wasn't the man that was doing it it was the angel of the Lord that was doing it at that moment that was God himself that was the he became the voice of God to us amen amen um the the prophet says the Gentile church has been blinded from the Veil and he says that's exactly what Israel failed to see if he would if it would have been some angel or something Israel would would have believed it so the prophet says that if there was like an angel and something like that that came down Israel would have believed but being it could not be an angel he had to be a man and he says God cannot break his word in the last days it has to be the same thing again what blinded the Israel that was that man that's what they killed him for and today because the message come through a man and not Angels because you just see a man that was born and he didn't have a he only had a seventh grade education Sade you know he was born in K Kentucky you know and then and he blinds the people they don't recognize they don't see God in the man because the message come to man and not Angel God can't change his way he cannot change his word and the Gentiles are just as blind today as Israel was because God veiled in a human being blinded the people don't be blinded by that amen amen now uh um and uh the prophet says that uh now God always like in his Prophet to [Music] Eagles Moses was his messenger they were following Moses and that was the Eagle's Wings that they were carried on because he was packing God's message the prophet says they were following God as they followed Moses with his message of Deliverance so they were following God as they were following Moses so they weren't following Moses they were following God in Moses that pill fire from the bush that came into Moses that's why they were following and no wonder Paul says Paul said be followers of me as I am a follower of Christ it's not that you following Paul but you following the Christ in Paul when when the world out there they like they want to see Jesus where are they going to see Jesus it's in they follow Jesus as they follow you you know the the prophet says that the as the Bible says that you shall do the Greater Works he said that the greater work was not in quantity but it was in the quality and he says that that greater work was that man became a like you became able to impart eternal life into someone else when the word of God comes in you you become the word to the to the world they're looking for Jesus they're not going to see Jesus coming from heaven and they're going to see Jesus in you that's why the Bible says that ye are the light of the world the light is the word of God made manifest the prophet says in the beginning God said let there be light but he said he was just the word it because when Jesus said let there be light it took a few years for the light to to come but at that time it was just the word let there be light but when the light came it became the word of God manifested the prophet says that that's you see the the word of God becoming a reality in your life that's how that's how you are the the light up to the world if you don't see the word of God Made Real to you you're still living in darkness and the world cannot see Christ in your life because you are still in darkness the word of God has to become a reality to you and how does the word of God becomes a reality to you by faith you have to believe his word there's only one way that you can please God by faith and and then we are baptized into his body by one Spirit remember the spirit is light when when God descended upon the children of Israel in in the day of Pentecost saw fire as like tongues that came up on the the head of the disciples so they had the fire in them and they became the light to the world no you can be the light in your school you can be the light in your workplace but in order for you to become the light you have to meet the pillow of fire you have to let the pillow of fire change you don't let the pillow of fire blind you but let it change you there was one man by the name of Paul you know he was he was on his way to persecute the Christians you know but he met the pillow of fire one day he heard Paul Paul why persecuted thou me Paul also heard the voice so Paul also was another witness that heard the pill of fire that had a voice and the pill of fire said I Jesus and Paul came into contact with the the pillow of fire and that changed him so you you you you you you wonder why you keep on going around in circles you're not seeing a change in your life you just haven't met the pillow of fire Let Jesus Christ reveal himself to you Paul why persecute why are you persecuting me you know and then that same voice is speak speak to you also why are you persecuting me because you are putting Jesus Christ you crucifying Jesus Christ Again by by your sins the way you live you are crucifying crucifying Jesus Christ again the voice this morning is saying why are you persecuting me I came down and I Died For You on Calvary I love you so much that I left my comfort seat and came down for you but you are persecuting you're persecuting me take he to the voice of the pillow of fire because it's the voice of God it's always the I am it's always present amen amen so brother Bram also met the pillow of fire and as Moses was was sent with the message to get the children out of Egypt in the first Exodus the message of Moses was to get the children of Israel out of Egypt that was the first Exodus and then brother BR met the pillow of fire you know and he also had a message to get us out into the Third Exodus to get out of the life of sin to get life out of Creeds and dogs mas and traditions of this world and you have to believe his message because that's the only way out you can't even go to the Rapture without believing the message of the Propet because that is Rapture material John was said eat that book and prophesy and John the prophet says he represents the bride so you also have a part to play you got to hear the voice of God you know come out of there my people that's why this message is crying out today whatever sin sinful situation you are in the pill of fire you know came with a voice and telling you come out of there and then when God calls you he doesn't care what situation you are in because because God is the one that changes men he said though your sins may be red as a Scarlet I will make them white as snow even like the The Prostitute woman she was caught in the act but she came to Jesus and she and she was found now guilty why will God call you if he doesn't if he doesn't want to take care of you the Bible even says that he that began the good work fin work so when God calls on you you just have to surrender and Trust The Voice trust the calling trust that he will take care of you the call is come unto me ye are heavy laden and burden and I will give you rest we all have burdens here you know every your burdens might might not may not be my bur my burdens and my burdens may not be your burdens but I like that Jesus Jesus did not name a burden but he just said come unto me you bring me your burdens I will give you rest so what whatever thing is bothering you today bring it on to Jesus come to Jesus don't go seek solution out there in the world Jesus Is A Healer and he's the greatest healer ever and he's not just the Healer of the human flesh but he's the Healer of the Soul Your Soul has been afflicted by the the the disease of the come to Jesus he's the great physician you know he'll perform the surgery that no other man can do Jesus says that I will give you a new heart he will even perform a heart surgery in you he will remove the Heart of Stone the Heart of Stone means that you cannot comprehend you cannot get along with the of God you wonder you come to church to hear the word of God but you always go out the same person you come to church they tell you you know God God God works in many ways God can speak to you through me he can speak to you through the brother Through the Bible through anything and and but you have to make sure it's it's scriptural and God speaks to you but you always come out the same and it's been years years years you are still in the same condition and then you and then you you you said that but in my heart I want to do what's right in my heart I want to give my life to God but I just can't seem to do it the problem is that your heart hasn't been changed you still have a Heart of Stone it's Stone like it's stubborn Stone means it represents stubbornness you have a spirit of stubbornness in you but Jesus is the greatest healer he's the greatest physician you know and he says that he will remove the Heart of Stone and he will give you a heart of Flesh a tender heart you know and and and he says and I'll put I'll give you a new spirit and you don't stop there you know you know don't stop at just the spirit you speaking tongues you shouting the spirit you dance that's good but don't stop there you know cuz you can still do all those those stuff and still be lost the Bible says and I will put my spirit in you what is that spirit that that pill of fire that pill of fire also it doesn't just have to be in brother Bram it can also be in the the the the prophet says that he says that as the bride was as the voice was to the bride the bride will also be the voice to the world how do you become the voice to the world you have to receive the word you have to receive the pillow of fire and then your life is changed God the Bible says that God is a consuming fire I like that they compare to a fire because consuming fire consumes everything that's on it way if you see the volcano for instance it tears down everything that that's on his way and God is a billion times more than a volcano even the spirit of stubbornness God can consume that that Spirit of alcohol God can consume that that spirit of of gossiping God can consume that that sickness God can consume that even that cancer God can consume that there's not anything that's impossible to God you just have to take him at his word but it goes back to believing the voice for your age if you get the people to believe you not even cancer can stand in your way there are benefits to believe in this message of the it comes with benefits and benefit is that you can ask anything in my name and I'll give it to you speak to the to this mountain it shall be moved but you got to trust that voice you got to trust the voice Let's uh talking about trust trus in the voice let's um talk about Abraham Abraham is another person that heard the voice of God and Abra Abraham he wasn't even a Jew back then he was an Idol idol worshiper you know and God didn't care what condition Abraham was in and he still called him he's the same yesterday today for he doesn't care what kind of condition you are God can even call you even in the nightclub God can call you God's calling doesn't matter wherever you are or what situation you are in in God's Own time he'll make all things perfect in his time that's when he calls you and the Bible says that when you when you hear him call do not Harden your heart Abraham did not Harden his heart imagine this Abraham he just he never even heard of God or anything like that and he just hears a voice speaking to him telling him to get out of his father's house and to go into the land that God would give him you know and you and he the Bible says he got up and he took all his belongings and follow the voice and and and then they can benefits with following the voice and so Abraham is and God it wasn't the first time God kept speaking to Abraham God and so God Abraham became familiar he he knew he knew what the voice of God was like you know and one day you know I I spoke about that earlier he was in his tent and he saw those three men coming to him and he went out he went to them to greet them and um he cooked for them and and prepared good meal and and the prophet when he heard that voice that said where is thy wife Sarah brother says that Abraham was like he's like I recognize this this voice he said that's the same voice that spoke to me all those years you know it's the same voice so Abraham recogn you know there's something about the voice of God when you are a child of God you recogniz the voice of God when the voice of God comes to you you you recognize that that's the voice of God you know and brother brandham also had the same experience let me read this quote here real quick okay one second okay so in the message the gift and calling are without without repentance paragraph 17 the prophet said here's what happened I was sitting in my [Music] study I seen the light spread out on the floor that pill of fire he saw that he said that spread out on the floor the same light that appeared to Paul and he say and this light was just above me and he had his arms folded so he's so he's talking about the experience of when he met the Lord Jesus Christ when he saw the Lord Jesus Christ and he had look as you don't see on the M on the face on on the face of a mortal he looked very calm and quiet very loving his voice when he spoke I knew it was the same voice that had spoke all down through life's journey but I I had never I had never seen his face that same voice that spoke to Samuel same that spoke to Moses the same voice that spoke to William and he he he but he had never seen his face there's just something about children of God we just there's something about the face of God why did Moses also wanted to see the face of God and God was keeping them from seeing his face and brother bam also was saying but I had never seen his face before Abraham had never seen his face before but he trusted his voice this is in 1950 so brother already started he trusted the voice and he started doing what the voice told him to do but yet he had never seen his face just like Abraham and but but I had never seen his face he was dark he was dark complexioned dark more like the Spanish or the Jewish people that's just the word so according to brother brandom Jesus Jesus was not white he was he had a dark complexion more like Spanish or the Jewish people he had his arms folded and and he looked to weight 200 PB in stature and [Music] height um and and head hair to his shoulders and a smooth face and when he walked it seemed like there was a power he'll do anything and I was so scared I was biting my fingers just imagine standing face to face with something like that he said do not fear when that voice spoke I knew it was the same one so we we don't have a message by just brought that was brought up by a man we have a message that came from the Throne of God that same voice that spoke to Samuel that same voice is what told Brother Bram when he was young do not defile your body you know do not drink nor smoke for I work prepared for you but when he saw him he recognized that that was the same that was the Lord Jesus Christ Peter heard his voice and he changed Peter too you know because Peter wanted to uh abide by the Traditions that the Jews should not come in the same house with other people from other countries so he he was a holy ghost filled man but he was still abiding by the traditions of men just like we might we may have in the church people that they are still following every single tradition of the culture or or the country it doesn't mean you don't have the Holy Ghost but you just need to hear the voice you know when when Peter heard the voice he changed he Chang you know he changed he got rid of all those traditions and the prophet says in the message here his voice he says that's what the voice of God always does it changes men and women and makes them what they should be not what the schools and the teachers has made but what God has patterned them for the voice of God changes men and women you know you want to have a closer go walk with god listen to the voice of God and the voice of God you know God created even a technology back in the time of William Bram where he could even be recorded now and it's on these tips this message was not the message of William brandham it was the message of God and the message of God always changes the people if you just constantly listen to the message you will see a change in your life because it's something Supernatural that you can't even explain it just by hearing the word listening to the word you notice you start to love God more you know one time they asked brother someone wanted to have a closer walk with God they asked him how can I how can I how can I fall in love how can I love God more brother told him read your Bible and pray every day imagine I just read my Bible every day but it makes me love God more listen to the message it will change you you know don't listen now we have too many ministers that they they come with their own interpretation of of of the word of God but remember the word of God only comes to one man for the age and all of us have to refer back to what brother Bram said so even if anything I said today if you go home and you see that that's not the message come tell me because I don't want to preach anything outside of the message because the message is the life for our day that's how we get we we get life know when uh the prophet Ezekiel he was told Ezekiel prophesy to these Dry Bones those bones were dry you know and he prophesied and those bones came to life so you even if you dead spiritually listen to the voice of God you know it will it will uh awaken you like Lazarus was a dead person that also heard the voice of God he was four days well his body started roting already it goes back again to what I said earlier it it does not matter the condition that you are in when the voice of God calls on you it can restore you back Lazarus was dead four days according according to how things work after three days that's when your body start rotting you say Lord I think I'm too far gone you know I I've I've done too too many bad things in my life I don't even know if I can come back to you and it it may be true too that you are really like just like Lazar four days like you you were completely roten in sin but it doesn't matter to Jesus call on Jesus you know and he will he will rise you up you know amen amen man I I'll be finishing soon um so in the message here the voice of God the prophet says this morning might be the time that you make up your mind no okay I'll come back to this later let me move on okay uh in the message my commission message in I don't know which paragraph but you'll find it there he said the prophet says this he says I'm just your brother I'm just your brother by the grace of God but when the angel of the Lord moves down it becomes then a voice of God to you I'm just your brother just like he said Moses sometimes he was Moses sometimes he became God to the children I'm just your brother as a brother I can't make mistakes but when the angel comes down the angel doesn't make any mistakes when the angel of the Lord moves down he becomes then a voice of God to you and he says maybe if I offended you by saying that forgive me but I felt that might be resented but I am God's voice to you at first he said forgive me but he felt like he said I felt like some people they didn't feel good about me saying I'm I'm the voice of God to you just like some people this morning they might feel some type of way of saying that the prophet William Bram is the voice of God for our day I'm God you and he says I say that again that time that was under inspiration I felt bad about it the first time but it repeated so you notice it wasn't even brother Bram who spoke that Second Son the pill of fire that was in him said I am God's voice to you and brought B him as a he got back as a man he said I'm but the pill of fire said no you don't have to be sorry I am God's voice to you you know the the that and and then he still God's voice to us today and he says I cannot I cannot say nothing in myself but in myself what he show and the prophet says that know a voice carries a message it doesn't make sense for a voice to just come and just say a bunch of nonsense when someone like I'm speaking right now I'm carrying a message and and then and then and then the prophet says that you know okay let me before I read that the pro um uh you know Moses he he when he he met God he went into the pillow of fire he came down with a message but that was a message of the law he brought the Ten Commandments and we also have a prophet in our day because remember the prophet said Moses went into the pill of fire Moses went into the cloud cu the Bible says it was like a thick cloud and we also have a prophet who he's actually went inside the cloud too gone inside the pillar of fire and he brought us back a message you know but this time it's not a message of love but it's a message of Grace it's a message of mercy no matter what condition you are in if you if you listen if you hearken unto my voice you will be set free I think about there was a there was the One Vision or something like that that the prophet had that people were Bound in cages and then and then there couldn't be set free I think he was the children of God and then the prophet William Bram had to speak and say House of Hell give away and he said as soon as soon as he said that those those those cages were open and and all those people were set free you can find it out in the quot I'll find it for next time so the people that were Bound in sin Bound by Satan the voice of the Prophet William brandham that's why you got to listen to these tapes don't just come to church and just hear the the Minister preach and you that teeth and you never ever hear the voice of God go home and listen to the message he will change you that message is not it's not dead God you cannot confine God into space or something like that there there are many testimonies of people that even they got healed while listening to the prophet you know in the prayer line they got heal because the pillow of fire is never that I was it's always that I am when you listen to the the message of God you have to apply that to your condition today this pill of fire is not just on these pictures but it's even in this room right now because Jesus says that wherever two or three are G in my name I the pillow of fire shall be there he's not here in the form of Jesus Christ but he's in the form of the pillow of fire because Jesus says that I come from God and I return back to God he came from God he was the pillow of Fire the pill of fire made became flesh and God dwelt in the in the temple of Jesus Christ and the difference between the the pill of fire dwelling in brother Bram and Jesus even you and me and Jesus is that in Jesus dwell the fullness of God brother Bram doesn't have the fullness of God in him because the fullness of God makes you God because when you have the fullness of God we can worship you but you cannot worship brother abam the B the prophet says that God only put his name in one man where where the worshiper can worship we we do not worship in the name of William brandham we worship in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we are saved in the in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we are healed in the name of the Lord Jesus the captive are set free in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we receive our our request in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not in the name of William BR the the name of the Lord is a strong tower you know and and and and the righteous run into it and he safe your safety is not under the name of William Bram your safety is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the world is falling apart you know we drawing night night to the end we see Bill Mark zukerberg the billionaire he's building a huge uh underground bunk [Music] bunker that's costing billions and billions of dollarss why is he doing that the world is they the world can't even see that we actually drawing night to the end they're looking for a refuge made of men but they're finding the wrong Refuge our refuge is in Jesus Christ in in his Pavilion shall he hide me we want God to hide us to hide us from the Wrath that's coming brothers and sisters if you are not in Christ Jesus Christ it's time to repent because you don't know when the Lord is going to call on you it could be even walking out of this door you don't know where might be your last call the coming of the Lord to you maybe you getting struck by a car accident or something why do you always put things in the future or because here's the thing you can you can lie to us or to your brother to your sister but you can never lie to yourself each and every person of us here this morning knows that today if the Lord had to call on me if it was my time to go you know exactly if you were going to heaven on you might come to church and fool us and and ask like a good brother all but in your heart you know your condition and guess what you're not the only person that knows God also knows your condition that's it's too late you know let's get back to the voice of god let's make ourself ready know amen amen amen all right so um I hope I'll finish this okay um these are the what the Waters of Separation uh the prophet says someday I got to meet you everyone and and almighty God knows that that light that you see on that picture is standing not two feet from not two feet from where I am right now that's the truth and it's moving into my right side and in another quote he says again that um um uh in a message how the angel came to me and his commission paragra 282 and while I'm talking about it the same light that's on the picture you know there's something about when you talk about Jesus he always shows up that's why you should have Godly conversations because when you have Godly conversation you invite Jesus Christ and when Jesus Christ comes he always leaves you with a blessing we all want blessings in our lives spiritual Financial or any other way start talking about Jesus he will come visit you Jesus love when they talk about him he says when talking about it talking about that light but I uh uh but I know uh uh standing not two feet from where I'm standing right now and I know it's settling with inside of me right now and if you could only know the difference when the power of almighty God catches and how that look the things look different now things like that is why it causes a lot of confusion and people tend to worship the man because his message is his ministry is so powerful that people even mistake him for Jesus Christ but he's not he's not Jesus Christ in the in the church book The Prophet says I want to make one more comparison between the leodan prophet messenger and John the people in John's day they mistook him for the Messiah now this last day prophets Messenger will have such power before the Lord that there will be those who mistaken for the Lord Jesus so brother already warned that because that Ministry was will be so powerful that people would even think that he's Jesus Christ and even um there's one of the brothers two one of the two brothers that went with um the prophet on the mountain in Arizona when the cloud appear one of that brother that even he even saw the cloud you know it confused him so much that now now he's even calling William Bram to be God he he I saw that it's on YouTube that video he's actually worshiping because he says that the things that he saw out of that man he's never seen like he just had to be but the prophet warned that those things will come but he says that but but don't you believe it he's not Jesus he's not the Son of God he's one of the Brethren I'm not he but but he about he he's coming after me let's wrap it up real quick here now so so I said this earlier in my message but in the same same uh book The Prophet says that God still has a voice for the people of the [Music] world even as he has given a voice to the bride the the voice is in the Bride As we have said and we about it later so the prophet is telling us that that voice that spoke to Moses that voice that we read that spoke to Samuel that voice that spoke to William brandham now it's no longer just in William brandham but it's in the bride now that voice is in the bride and he says that we're going to be the we're going to be the voice to the world so it doesn't just stop William Brenham you also have a part you know Satan Satan Satan doesn't care if you if you just point if you just keep oh Willam oh he spoke he spoke to the he spoke the the squirrels into existence oh he did this he did this Satan is okay with that he I mean he can't even agree with you you know but he the problem that he has is when you take that word that was spoken and start to leave it where the voice is no longer just the voice of William Brown but the voice now is in you and where like as he was told to John prophesy you know because John now had the word in him he had the voice you know you can impart eternal life into your brother sometimes your brother can go into a situations where you you probably don't even need to pray you can just speak things into existence and that come to pass not everybody's there but we we will all have to get there before the Rapture because the word has to be in us too so the last quote I have is um so remember Moses Moses he wanted to see the face of God but he couldn't see the face of God because the prophet says because at that time the lamb had hadn't been hadn't be had hadn't been slain because it was just the blood of bulls and goats but when Jesus Christ when Jesus Christ died on the cross the Bible says that the veil in the temple rented rent and it says that Christ was there on the cross in plain view and no wonder Jesus told them that you have uh if you have seen me you've seen the father Moses couldn't see the face of God you know but we've been privileged in our day to see the face of God God so loved us so much that he did not just want to show that to just William brandham but he also wanted to show that to the bride to let you know that now the voice is in the bride and he came down in 1963 you know in the cloud you know and there finally you can see the the face of God so that pillow of fire that was in that spoke to Moses in the burning Bo that pill of fire now all of a sudden we can see his face Moses desired to see his face but he couldn't but you you at least can see his face I took this picture of that I wanted to show you it's the cloud you know you know all everybody can at least see a see a face here you know I think even if I ask any of the kid to tell me if they can see can you see the eyes come come show us where the eyes right you know Moses couldn't see this but now even a child can see this that's the that's the message that we have received you know and he becomes as a judge because this the prophet says that this uh the cloud in England it's it was the judge that used to to wear like wi white white wig this shows us supreme authority the word of God that's why this message is and the prophet in the message the rising of the sun he says he says um Can he's describing this picture right he says can you see his eyes can you see his nose can you see his mouth and the congregation says amen I'm going to ask you can you see his eyes that pill of fire that Moses couldn't see now you are you are blessed to see this can you see his his ears can you see his nose you know can you see his hair it's Jesus Christ of Jehovah of the Old Testament Jesus Christ of the New Testament and they come with a blessing you know so just to let you know that this message is not a message by a man it's God who sent us this message and he came to vindicate you know so that's why you have to listen to the message home because it will change you it has power no it did not just stay in the in 1963 or 196 the power is in us now amen amen all right all right okay the last sorry I keep saying but this is really the last quote in the message blind uh bimus he said that um in paragraph 323 he says that I challenge your faith to that yeah don't believe me but believe him cuz I'm just a man just uh like this microphone it isn't a microphone you're hearing it's my voice so then it's it isn't me that you're hearing it's him the Jesus Christ that walked on Galilee when you read the Bible you see those those those words in red and when brother comes with thus sayth the Lord he says it's no longer I that speaks no you just hear you you're hearing my voice but it's not me it's the pill of fire inside of me that's speak it's the angel of the Lord and invite the angel of the Lord in your house invites the angel of the Lord in any situation that you are in no and do not try to to think that you're smarter than the message the messenger because the messenger is being led by the pill of Fire he was led by the pill of fire and in in the book of Exodus where where the where the pill of fire stopped the children of Israel stopped and if he continues again they go and and that's the same thing with us today if brother bam stopped on something and you want to tell me that you know more than him he was following the pillar of fire follow me as I follow Christ oh God bless you um let's sing um can't you see why you may stand I'm so [Music] happy I've accepted the word of the Lord the revealed word that was [Music] spoken by the prophet of [Music] my oh can't you see can't you see
