their greetings do you receive thank you very much without much time let's open our Bibles in the book of Psalm chapter 8 from starting from starting from verse four to the end verse three when I consider thy Heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou has ordained what is men that thou are mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him for thou has made him a little lower than the angel and has crowned him with the glory and honor thou mest them to have dominion over the works of that hand that has put all things under his feet all sheep and oxen yet the Beast of the field the foul of the air and the the fish of the air and whatsoever passes through the path of the Seas hallelujah oh Lord Our God how excellent is thy name in all the Earth Hallelujah say with a prayer God Heavenly Father you're wonderful we don't have words thank you we're counted among Liv not because we're something but it's because of your grace at this time there are people we're not counted among the living some are in this in this but your grace found us here so we can worship you so we can listen to your word and to worship and we thank you Lord now bless your the pastor bless your children take take me and put me out of the way and for this speak to your our soul in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may have your seat then God bless you your beloved brother Joshua I came with a little inspiration like a greeting it's for the first time for me to be here I know that before the foundation of the world we were all together God saw us in this glorious message preached by brother he knew that we would find oursel tonight and so there is no and there is no surprise my inspiration is that you are you are the Perfection of the evolution of God Amen David asked himself a question what is who is man so that God could think of him he created the the ocean he created the animals he created the gold he created diams he created everything that we know the Sun the moon but he takes all of that and he put it under the feet of man and he tells man have dominion upon those things he makes man master of of his creation so now who is David asked himself this question but glory be to God that in the end time God has promised us that I will send you Elijah the prophet and he will take the Bible he will open the Bible and he will reveal the Bible and we will know all those things that's why the prophet will tell us tonight that man is not a bi logical accident you're not an accident you're not just made like that you are exactly a program a program that started in the thoughts of God when he was eloh you were a little Elohim in him when he was the Fountain of Life you are also a Fountain of Life in and when he changed his form he became the word you also became the word when he became the you also became that little in that in that big logos that's why the prophet will answer to us even though Moses already gave the answer when you read Genesis first chapter verse 26 says it says make let let us make man in our image in the image of God and in our likeness that means that this man must have dominion upon the creation of God listen to to our Prophet does it makes me feel good thank you for this opportunity it makes me feel good in the sermon uh the countdown the countdown preach in 19 1962 March in paragraph 32 okay it go ahead I want I want him to read with me so I can learn English as as him too okay and I pray that God so that next time I come here I will also preach in English Okay that's that's what it is now listen he says and I believe that in there that that when God created man he started reflecting the little things like animals and what he created afterward made something different and that's how he did it according to what the Bible says he created the the the and and and the life and then he made man and then the last thing that ever come from Earth in the form of creation was a man nothing higher ever come in all the creation there has never been anything higher than that so that the Way You Are nothing can bu your value is the value of God when Lucifer fell God did not move but when man fell the Lord did not stay stand still why it's because man is the perfect part of man is what makes God God so that that's why he took everything he created and he put it under the feet of he knows the value of man God knows your value don't ever underestimate yourself don't ever neglect yourself don't ever find yourself useless because I'll tell you tonight that you are the true one you are the authentic you are the original God will never repace because there will never be anybody like you there will never be two persons like you you are unique you are the true one the only you is you no one will ever take you your place hallelujah hallelujah so when God created man he saw that there was nothing higher than that now the prophet says because why it was a perfect reflection of the highest in heaven which God is a [Applause] man so when God created man when he created you and when he saw man God stopped there because man was the reflection perfect reflection of what was the highest so God is a man when you go in heaven you find the most exellent thing is God when you come down the thing the most thing is man so that means that you are so important important in this earth that nothing can ever take your [Applause] place the prophet will tell you that you are intelligent like God so you can never fail you have the ability in you to never fail because you are exactly like God is said so speaks everybody pays attention he says and God is a man see God is a man so therefore it proves it and when God came down to dwell Among Us he was a man it was not an angel because God is a man see a a so it shows that the Perfection of evolution was God which is a man I got my inspiration so the Perfection of the evolution is a man and that man is a God so that means god evolved he started with the animals he looks at the lion then he says no it's not like that then he levels up he brings the trees he looks at the beauty of the trees in he then he levels his he evolves he creates the Sun and no that's not what I'm looking for God was also evolving in his EV so one day the sixth day he said let us make mad in our image and when he looks at man God said I got I will stop right here the thing I was looking for so after the creation of God never created again why because man was was the final knowledge of God you are the final knowledge of God there is nothing greater than you so that when God was obligated to redeem man when man fa God was obligated now imagine when man says that Gabriel came down he could he told he could have told let me come down let me go down to F now God said this for this matter that's it's not it's not your look at that man really well how is he created it was the deity it was God in in the now to save him he had to be God so that's why God created himself in the image of man to save man because man a man is a God you are a little God tell your neighbor tell your neighbor you are the Perfection tell your neighbor you are the Perfection of the evolution of [Applause] God yes hallu you're you're not just anybody when you walk on earth you're boosting your chest don't look at your condition or your social condition no even God in the human there was a time where he didn't have a place to sleep of the heavens and earth in a man there was a time there will be a time where the in you will take its place and that at that time you'll see who you really are so don't ever neglect because just because of just because of who you are amen amen you are the Perfection of the evolution of [Music] God you are the final knowledge of God everything you see for you who you see the the the evolution of science who's doing it they're not Angels Humans Beings who human beings were doing this if men don't do anything nothing's going to be [Applause] done because man is the master even in his Fallen State still the master of everything someone who's filled with the Holy Ghost now at that time you become you can face any situation at that time hallelujah hallelujah now listen sermon the power of transformation preach October 31st 1965 paragraph 57 that's the way God did about the world he worked it was in his mind and if you notice it come like by evolution like he was learning more all the time making something greater and greater let the fish be then he looks at the fish he's like I have to evolve again now he was doing things as if as if he was learning he he wanted something hallelujah hallelujah he was going greater and greater see he was above it all just let it evolute up to that you see everything he begin to bring upon the Earth from boty life and fish and so forth it come on into Birds and the animals and then something and then something in his own image a man and stop there see because it was up to his Perfection what he wanted hallelujah hallelujah whether you're whether you be tall whether that's what he wanted don't ever imitate somebody don't ever change the color be who you are you are the flower that God want that's how he wanted to see you he loves you like will never be to like you if you're to see he's happy this is why how I wanted it to because you are his Perfection amen amen he never regrets anything what he makes of you that's what he saw as the best thing that he could hallelujah hallelujah because after he never created [Applause] again God came to to save he will never take anybody else to put him in your place it's always you that he will transform because you are the one wh whom he hallelujah hallelujah the man is that Perfection now the problem is here the problem that's where science troubled us now listen to what brother R say resurrection of Lazarus paragraph 35 preach in uh paragraph 35 July 29th 1956 yeah okay go ahead don't 35 yeah okay mhm exact and there's where science gets mixed up they don't understand anything they say no man is not Perfection they said man is not God they said man is not the final knowledge of God why might give him a hand like a monkey a person who has a hand like a monkey can say he might give him a face like a chimpanzees he might give him a foot like a bear so sometimes when they look at you they might say you don't have a form but God put a soul in a man hallelujah hallelujah this white cloud deity came down not in in the animal but in the man that thing that has like a like be careful with that person inside that person there is a sword that soul is a white is the de that it's it's a it's a it's a hall of fire so that man is do things like God did he can speak things into existence he can declare things and things will happen because inside of him there is something God himself now if they want to go back and dig up some of some old bones let them dig up as many as they want to all the that doesn't have a thing to do on bearing of the word of God then there is here and now the man sin and when he took the creat he put him into a form that that that that gets science mixed up but now that that Divine in this body that get science mixed up that man fell and when he sinned and fell now listen my beloved then that little clown in there became mared and became black that cloud did not live man but it was it was damaged it was darkened so now that deity is still in man but it was darkened by sin So Adam fell as a God and he never changed into a demon despite that he was still a Son of God he has never been a demon god never baptized him with another name but when Lucifer fell and when God they gave him a new name they gave him the the dragon but when man fa know how God called him he called him Adam Adam where are you it was the same name no matter your failes no matter your God knows who you are he will work to redeem you he will work to bring you back someone clap clap his hands for the Lord s that cloud was mared but was never taken away it was darkened the darkness came and covered the deity so the god of now says what am I going to do no one can take his place no one can redeem this man because he's higher than anything if I Even If I multiply the sun Mo and everything it will never measure up to him because he's the master of all that so to save man you need someone bigger than that's why God looked he couldn't even find the prophet no prophets could Adam himself could not even while he was created with but he couldn't save himself saw the other ones that came through a no one until brother bre amen amen so when God looked time from the beginning to the end there was no one then he take he makes I will because he's my image because he's God so I God I will go so two God made up in the mountain in the mountain of c one was down here one was on the mountain hallelujah hallelujah so you have value you are valuable you are valuable don't neglect yourself no one could save you not even Moses not even not even brother upop all the angels and no one could save you your value is the value of God God looked at Jesus Christ who was his own body God looked at you then he says I'm going to leave Jesus Christ I'm going to get you because he knew that Jesus Christ had the power to give his life and to take it back so even if he go to he can get out so he went to hell so you could get up so that he and you will live together eternally you are valuable hey your value is even the blood of God don't ever underestimate yourself because of you God made a new creation despite saying that everything was of our falling God made a new creation what value do you have amen amen now listen he says and and then the logos came down and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem us or to redeem this man back to the love of the father and when we're talking about this man that's you it's me and he came he came in by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and chased sin out of the and brings men back again in in fellowship with God so he died so that the the the the baptism of fire come down and break down this Darkness so that the soul of man that was the light that was the man that was the the that was the White Cloud the soul of that was the deity got into action so if God gives you the Holy Ghost I will tell you one thing you become you are that little creature you can speak like him and in the same time when he opens the the word comes down in his everything that was God come down among men you walk you walk you you walk you walk upon you walk upon nothing can stop because in this time God has proved that everything is possible and that everything is where there is no solution there is a solution where there is no way there is a way when it's finished is not finished when it finished it begins when it's blocked it opens where finished it start we have the omnipotence because the miraculous came to take the control of his little manifest his grace amen amen so tonight even if you have a problem you can create the solution because the solution is in you is in you it's in you yes brother is in you say on the solution is in you you are the solution that's what brother BR tells you he says that's where you are that's what the matter with you Pentecostal people brother says it's my lot this afternoon to pre he says I have the right here at the platform that's the problem for p they don't recognize who they are they worship God they PR they pray and cry they all those things but they don't know who they are the difference with us that we all worship the same but we know who we are we're not just anybody we don't we don't plead God to be saved no no we didn't look for it he searched for us because he knew who we are without us because he's Inc so he is oblig to seek for you now listen you are a son and daughters of God you are you have in your hands now notice then Jesus said in the scriptures that he are that he are that he are you are that he are gods that he are Gods amen amen verse 37 look Divinity deity I'm a part of Charles BR because I was born from Charlie BR Brandon my I'm part of him I've got a forehead like him my hair was like him hallelujah hallelujah I'm a small man like him I'm in the nature of because he's my dad and if we become in in the spirit son God what does brother deity dwells in the man are you a Son of God are you a daughter of God oh you are son the son of a lion it's a little lion they call him when he starting but when he grows he becomes a is a little duck and the the small version of a God is God if we become de dwells then you talk about blind eyes being open they said nothing impossible to God so that's what people say nothing is impossible to God God said nothing impossible with you if you believe not with God but you you are able to create your life to create a new system from this time I will live like this the atmosphere creates that life everything is possible not for God but for you deity is in man Contin it continues then the very God that stood back there the mythical platform etu and rolled worlds off of his hands and created these things give you the privilege to be his son and you are part of him God dwells in mankind and not just that and man himself is deity brother says hallelujah it might choke you but study over that a little while study over that a little while God dwells in man and man becomes a Son of God not in himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God Creator the Creator lives in the [Applause] creation lives in the creation where is the creator tonight I see him I'm he's raising up his hand like that sister right there he's raising his hand like he is in creation so nothing can dominate nothing can overcome no sickness no witch no magician no system of this world no demon you are you are not you are a God you are able submit all in your own will hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to choke the devil tonight before finishing I'm going to CH in this in the sermon uncertain sound preach in December 18 18 1960 paragraph 33 blessed be the name of the Lord as my brother's looking I'm going to drink a little bit of water this is the thing here is the thing man in the beginning when God made him he didn't make him to be doctored that's you so the doctors have to stop eating up your money now every time you go to the hospital that's not a good position he didn't create him to be doctored he had his own doctoring in him everything was in him he was equipped he was a unit of his own man is Hospital himself so when you walk in you there is there is there is there is All Med there is do the medicines there's all those medicines in you so you can regenerate yourself that's who you [Music] are then healing does not come from any outside resource it has to come from the so that's why there is no preacher that heals there is no prophets that heals not even God himself because Jesus saying your faith your faith has healed your faith has healed because it's in man when you go to prer because you believe that if he speak you're going to be healed but that's is in you we're just like the charger the elements that charge the battery is in the B when you're weak they charge you up with the preaching but the blessings healing is in you deliv is in your house is in your wife is in you your children are in you your goodness is you are the prophets of your own life that's why Jesus said is our confession the power of life and of death is where in the tongue you want to have life start confessing it you want to have good speak of good you want to have intell confess it every day the atmosphere will and the thing will happen because you are a God hallelujah [Music] hallelujah paragraph 34 same same man in the beginning when he was made a man is God he's absolutely a God for he was made in the image of God being a Son of God I love this or the English then he is an heir of all that God is not that God has but God he's an heir of everything that if he's Elohim then you are an if you are an of God if Jehovah you are anom you are an you don't have the right you don't have the right you don't have the right to you are an air of everything God is hallelujah hallelujah then he gave God a domain the domain of Earth so that man dominat he is the god of universe and God man is the god at the end of the sermon he says it was man he was he's a king he was a king not just a king but a king ruler a king r a king ruler so he is a king rer he is a King He Reigns and then he leads things then he leads everything the way he wants it now listen and In This Moment In His Fallen estat he still has the appearance now listen if he is in this fall state then we need we need Rock we all this in his Fallen State now what about what about a man who's filled with the Holy Ghost now remove your fear remove the fear remove all of that you're not just anybody God knows what you're cap he knows your value don't know your value but he knows your when God looks at you he's not looking at the son of father he's not looking at the daughter God looks at God when God looks he's not looking at in a dimension of a little country he he looks at you as a everywhere you will go everywhere you will go you will reign we can finish with this in the sermon in the family blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah your family in a sermon your family like We Are Family it makes me feel good to have a family family family family family it makes me feel good the blood of Jesus Christ power we're saved by his he saved with his blood all tries all language all all and he made of us a royal a royal and we will R upon the Earth before we already start reigning as Christians 15 in the sermon thy house when we read together it gives me strength it makes me feel good I know I'm in the truth when I read with it and it makes me it makes me learn English paragraph 58 yeah see people try to think and then I'm a Christian I think that they they will they will they'll track me no that's not it it's just continue okay continue uhhuh no that's not what it is it's not that when you become a Christian you start having fear that they'll they'll come after me things will not work no says no it's not that you are a Christian you are you are one that's elevated you are a son of God our Father is a king certainly a man Our Father beinging we are his sons Prince we are his princes princess and we're are prin of a king then he it's the highest blood there is ever that the most the highest the spirit of our God is in us when you become a Christian the Holy Spirit it removes Darkness you become the highest rank and there is nothing in this Earth of humans that can dominate you you have to believe me there's nothing in this earth in this earth that will dominate you you become a powerful man hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to read a scripture here as the pastor asked me I'll read one I'll read one and then and then it'll make us feel good don't be afraid God has given us a powerful message amen amen amen amen amen that nothing can overcome us nothing nothing nothing God has given us something very strong you're not just anybody in the vision of Patmos the Patos Vision paragraph 2 in paragraph we start at paragraph 26 that's where we will it will make you feel good don't be afraid he says amen he says amen he removed all the obstacles before man so they could have a communion like there was in the Garden of Eden Jesus came to die on the CR to to remove all the everything that was sto us from Evol to be good health to walk like Sons Hallelujah he removed all of that thank you I was going to swallow that but I will say this I was going to swallow that but let me just say this is brand because what he's going to say is like a bomb man is an omnipotent I thought you were going to say Amen because that's you you are that man you confess you become what you confess man is omn he says you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is did not he said in Mark whatever if you don't doubt your heart they'll come to pass you can have what said now this is where it makes me this is where it creates a miracle in human life what happens when two omn poent meet when God comes together in the two something got to shake that's why in this end time a prophet preached this he preached the invisible of the the and of the Earthly so it's the meeting the meeting the head that comes down that comes to attach to the body and when the two meet up something must happen Don't Be Afraid something is going something will happen in your life that God will give it whatever you ask with this power the creative power of knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his words creates a power that goes out y bring things to have to pass things that is not and makes them as though they are because two omnipotent have because Powers have that's his their oh isn't it that's your position today when you re the omnipotent you are om what happen he says you say the word and he fulfills it brother in this end time
