[10:00] laughs at the law told me uh and nothing
[10:40] was seeing the vision let him that
[10:45] reader run amen
[10:49] and I've been running and I'm not tired
[10:51] yeah well get tired but we think our for
[10:56] His grace and His mercy and surely God
[11:00] has been good to us as we stand
[11:06] we'll work over to Roman's 9 Romans I
[11:12] will pick up where we left off tonight
[11:15] this morning Romans 9 one thing I love
[11:27] about the message
[11:34] it's just to me it's clear it makes
[11:41] sense if that makes sense
[11:45] it just I don't see where people make it
[11:51] so complicated because everything God
[11:56] reveals he real Veals it by way of
[11:58] simplicity it's mankind who make things
[12:03] complicated and complex they saw try to
[12:09] scientific fie the message in a way you
[12:13] know like it's something mystical it's
[12:17] not it is a mystery that needs to be
[12:19] revealed but there is not mystical it's
[12:24] plain and simple we think our Forge
[12:27] grace Romans 9 beginning at the eighth
[12:31] verse that is they which are the
[12:35] children of the flesh these are not the
[12:39] children of God but the children of the
[12:43] promise are counted for the seed for
[12:47] this is the word of promise at this time
[12:50] will I come and Sara shall have a son
[12:53] and not only this but when Rebecca also
[12:57] had conceived by one even by our Father
[13:00] Isaac for the children being not yet
[13:04] born neither having done any good or
[13:07] evil that the purpose of God according
[13:10] to election might stand not of works but
[13:14] of him that call it it was said unto her
[13:18] the elder shall serve the younger and as
[13:21] it is written Jacob have I loved but
[13:24] Esau have I hated
[13:26] let us pray father we thank you for your
[13:31] grace we thank you for your mercy we
[13:35] thank you for being so good to us and
[13:37] Lord I pray this evening that you would
[13:41] bless us touch our tired flesh
[13:44] strengthen us in our bodies in spirit
[13:47] and father would be careful to give you
[13:50] the praise glory naanum in Jesus
[13:52] Christ's name we pray amen
[13:54] you may be seated a lot of times we I
[14:01] guess we don't see the word in the way
[14:06] that it should be seen and I'm not
[14:09] speaking about everybody but I think if
[14:13] we thought about promise when it comes
[14:17] to God promising something that those
[14:22] promises are unconditionally if God says
[14:27] he's gonna do something he's going to do
[14:29] it it might as well just counted to be
[14:31] done and you and I must know that God
[14:37] when he brought us to this light and
[14:40] that's exactly what it is as light it's
[14:43] a revelation it's is identity when you
[14:47] can see yourself in the scripture and
[14:50] you can identify with yourself in that
[14:53] scripture you can see that God has
[14:56] opened your eyes to who you really are
[14:59] the thing that I love about Calvary is
[15:02] because Calvary cleared up everything it
[15:07] was the blood of Jesus Christ that was
[15:12] accepted before God as our perpetuation
[15:15] it was the blood of Jesus Christ and
[15:18] atoned us is his blood of Jesus Christ
[15:20] that set us free and so that's why the
[15:26] Bible saying it's not him now willeth
[15:28] know he that runneth but God who shows
[15:31] mercy I think that when a person is
[15:35] truly born again and really seen exactly
[15:39] what God is doing with him there is no
[15:42] room for pride
[15:44] because that individual understands that
[15:48] he he holds his position only by the
[15:52] grace of God it is God who raises up in
[15:56] God who brings down and in all of this I
[16:00] I think
[16:01] about like I said today or this morning
[16:04] when I think about Jesus and how he had
[16:08] all of the disappointments
[16:10] he had his disciples that constantly
[16:15] were bickering between one another and
[16:17] trying to see he was going to be the
[16:19] greatest among them and all of the
[16:23] things that day Jesus had to deal with
[16:26] you know who's gonna be the first and
[16:28] then on top of that I think about it
[16:31] sometime I think now when that lady came
[16:33] to Jesus and says lord I would that my
[16:37] son said one sit on the right hand and
[16:40] one sit on the left that had that I
[16:49] guarantee you whatever the Lord was
[16:51] going through that was the devil trying
[16:52] to punch him with something you know you
[16:55] know what I'm saying that last little
[16:56] thing that really gets to you and I was
[16:59] thinking to myself I said you know to me
[17:02] what a selfish question what a request
[17:05] as as if her sons and evidently I don't
[17:11] know whether it was pride whatever I
[17:13] don't know what the lady was thinking
[17:15] but she could not have really understood
[17:17] who he really was if she would just to
[17:20] ask a question and such to be honest
[17:25] with you I appreciate and I think and I
[17:28] believe that we all do we appreciate
[17:30] where God has us somebody might say oh I
[17:35] just wish I was a prophet no I'm glad to
[17:38] be exactly where I am
[17:39] and then I know how in myself if I could
[17:42] could have gotten out of this I would
[17:44] have gotten out of it because the truth
[17:47] of the matter is wherever God places you
[17:49] there is a lot of pressure there is a
[17:51] lot of things that goes with it it just
[17:54] doesn't come as easy as people think
[17:56] think about when God ordained Joseph
[18:00] gave him visions and all of that and all
[18:03] of the commotion and all of the stuff he
[18:06] had to go through it was not his choice
[18:09] it was God's choice so every storm he
[18:14] went through
[18:15] was handcrafted for Joseph and to bring
[18:19] Joseph to perfection and you know the
[18:23] thing that I love about it because I
[18:24] look at Stephen I look at Jesus I look
[18:28] at Joseph and I think the the the last
[18:32] tests that they all three had in common
[18:36] was forgiveness they had to forgive
[18:40] their brethren of their transgressions
[18:44] and I think about all of the things that
[18:47] we go through now I think the greatest
[18:50] thing that we can do when someone
[18:52] transgress us is to forgive now we we
[18:58] talk about promises because even when
[19:01] Jacob though God said Jacob I love Esau
[19:05] I hated Jacob was a shyster think about
[19:09] it God knew he was a shyster and for
[19:13] whatever reason and I don't know how
[19:16] else to say it but when Jacob was at his
[19:19] father-in-law house the angel told Jacob
[19:22] how to which will say shyster I don't
[19:29] know the angel told Jacob how to get
[19:32] more crop how how do you say that you
[19:37] know to me but it was it was it didn't
[19:40] it to the mentor I'm sure there's a
[19:42] great revelation behind it but his crop
[19:45] grew grew grew grew grew far greater
[19:48] than his father-in-law because the angel
[19:51] helped him and showed him what to put in
[19:54] the water that would change the spotted
[19:57] cows or the spotted whatever and you
[20:00] look at all of these things and God knew
[20:02] but you see what I'm trying to say is
[20:05] that when you are chosen and elected of
[20:08] God they're going to be a lot of things
[20:10] that we will do wrong but it doesn't
[20:13] change the position that you hold in God
[20:17] you understand me
[20:19] because the position in which you hold
[20:21] we hold in God was given to us we're an
[20:25] asteroid it was given to us and
[20:28] therefore
[20:29] if God has positionally placed you in
[20:32] the Word of God as his bride nothing you
[20:36] can do on earth that will change that
[20:41] only because God has made the decision
[20:45] it's not him nor will it know he that
[20:47] running for God that shows mercy not by
[20:49] power not by might but by my spirit
[20:52] saith the Lord
[20:53] it's whom God has chosen and we can
[20:57] weaken they said who knows the mind of
[21:01] God as I read this morning is there
[21:04] anybody that's gonna counsel him and
[21:05] there anybody that could tell him that
[21:07] he's made a mistake or is anybody they
[21:09] can render their help to him so he can
[21:12] repay them no God is in control
[21:14] he's the only potentate he's the only
[21:17] lawgiver and however God judges is
[21:21] righteous is holy God can never make a
[21:25] mistake you understand me you and I must
[21:31] realize by God's grace that the purpose
[21:34] there's a purpose that all of us like I
[21:36] said we're connected who would have
[21:39] thought I would be here in Iowa but God
[21:42] by foreknowledge saw me making the trip
[21:45] he saw look what he did brought Frank
[21:48] all the way from the Congo because he
[21:51] was needed here but we were connected
[21:54] even then but we didn't know we were
[21:56] connected see and God didn't bring
[21:59] people from here and there you know
[22:01] connecting us why because in his mind
[22:04] though we have we were all in different
[22:07] countries different places there's a
[22:09] eternal connection and he knew at some
[22:12] point in time he would bring this all
[22:14] together as part of his purpose none of
[22:18] us can can refute or argue with God's
[22:22] election because God is perfect he
[22:25] doesn't have a second choice he doesn't
[22:28] say well if you don't work out I'll get
[22:31] someone else no God's choice his first
[22:34] choice is always the right choice and
[22:37] you said what do you mean I mean to
[22:39] serve his main purpose right
[22:42] you say well what do you mean let me say
[22:46] it like this
[22:46] God had in his mind to make David King
[22:51] way before they elected Saul and Saul
[22:56] was the people's choice but David was
[23:01] God's choice and God you saw to show the
[23:06] people that if they would have
[23:08] acknowledged him and kept the word they
[23:13] would have never had a song but because
[23:16] people get in their all minds and
[23:18] they're always thinking they have a
[23:20] better way God said go ahead o see and
[23:24] they went on and what this all do Saul
[23:27] did everything Samuel said that he would
[23:30] do and Sam you said okay you own the
[23:33] king but this King is gonna make slaves
[23:35] out of your own children your children
[23:38] excuse me tell you what we will do and
[23:41] Saul did all of those things and you say
[23:45] what brothers what are you trying to say
[23:46] I'm trying to say that God when he when
[23:51] it's all said and done we will be the
[23:54] one that's in all God is not going to be
[23:59] surprised at it because he's already
[24:01] seen the finished product of you and me
[24:03] will be the ones that's in all old and
[24:06] then you'll see that those are the Falls
[24:08] and those little scrapes bruises or
[24:11] whatever you did make was for your own
[24:13] benefit right sometimes God has to let
[24:18] us go in certain areas and certain
[24:20] places in our lives just to toughen us
[24:22] up you know we look at this thing in and
[24:28] I love to say I love the word because
[24:29] the Bible says born of color
[24:32] uncorruptible incorruptible I love that
[24:36] because I understand that the seed that
[24:38] I was born with in the natural is
[24:41] corruptible it was corrupted when I got
[24:46] it because of Adam and Eve it was
[24:49] corrupted but we find out that there's
[24:52] an incorruptible seed which is Jesus
[24:54] Christ himself
[24:56] did you put that seed in you did the
[24:58] preacher preacher than you or did Jesus
[25:01] planning in you before the foundation of
[25:04] the world he planted in you hallelujah
[25:08] you didn't ask for it he gave it to you
[25:12] hallelujah by his own counseling by his
[25:16] own wheel by his own desire Amen to see
[25:20] God in you become great you understand
[25:25] me God is in you to do what excuse me
[25:30] he's in you to become great oh now that
[25:36] sounds really strange but God loves to
[25:41] take nothing and make something out of
[25:44] it
[25:45] the Bible says being born again not of
[25:48] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[25:50] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[25:53] for ever that life in itself is God life
[25:58] in you oh I love this thing because you
[26:01] got to realize that when God said be
[26:03] fruitful and multiply he had even
[26:06] himself in mind it was God's desire to
[26:10] bring forth of his kind that's why I
[26:14] can't fail if the first creation though
[26:18] it failed the second creation cannot it
[26:22] was God's design his own will he knew it
[26:25] was going to fall but with God being the
[26:28] law having a law of contrasts Amen did
[26:31] all of this
[26:32] so what so the true creation the real
[26:36] thing can have his glory is that right
[26:41] think about it because really you take
[26:44] about we always said the firstborn the
[26:45] firstborn the firstborn but here it was
[26:48] Cain was the firstborn but who got the
[26:51] benefits Abel right Oh Jacob and Esau
[26:58] but who got the benefits you see them
[27:02] saying something is something about that
[27:05] second one that God works with right and
[27:08] you
[27:09] - Oh brothers you know what is it all
[27:12] about God is a God of contrasts he knows
[27:15] what he's doing and he looks at us and
[27:18] he says oh look at all the people look
[27:21] at look this is what gets me because it
[27:24] was a powerful church when brother
[27:26] Branham was here it was powerful those
[27:30] who believed they saw they seen God do
[27:34] things that he had never done before but
[27:37] here we told we were told that the bride
[27:41] of Jesus Christ
[27:42] she superseded not one man but the body
[27:48] of Jesus Christ he is that right the
[27:51] body of Jesus Christ is symbol in symbol
[27:54] or type is Elijah and Elijah did twice
[27:58] as many miracles as Elijah and we look
[28:03] at this thing in which all but what are
[28:05] you trying to say now we are the ones
[28:08] that will see a translation right a
[28:13] changing we are going to see the
[28:16] completion of God's transforming power
[28:20] that God will transform us from this old
[28:24] natural man to a supernatural man and
[28:27] the two lives the two difference in not
[28:31] only just appearance but life itself is
[28:34] a million miles or more apart because
[28:37] one is eternal and one is natural and to
[28:42] think that God can take a sinful piece
[28:46] of clay and make it holy
[28:49] that's God's presence being in his
[28:53] presence look at the Angels the
[28:54] cherubims or seraphim's and all of them
[28:57] that's hallelujah up there and heaven
[29:00] all they can do is say holy holy holy
[29:02] holy holy
[29:03] amen why because they are in that
[29:06] Shekinah presence that's the kind of
[29:09] glory hallelujah and that's where God
[29:11] wants us as believers to live in that
[29:15] Shekinah glory now in order to live
[29:18] there you gonna have to fight to get
[29:20] there
[29:21] hallelujah you
[29:23] always got something or someone out
[29:25] there trying to pull you out from under
[29:28] the shekinah and you know what the Bible
[29:30] tells us that's why Paul said who shall
[29:32] separate me from the love of God what
[29:36] shall sir she have tribulation of famine
[29:38] persecution or whatever he said there is
[29:41] nothing that can separate me from the
[29:45] love of God that we might have friends
[29:47] who cut us off we may have friends who
[29:50] say I don't love you no more but that
[29:52] God will never tell you that when God
[29:55] said in his heart and his mind to love
[29:57] you nothing can change it hmm nothing
[30:04] can change you hallelujah
[30:08] think about it the grass with us and I
[30:11] love this part
[30:12] was because that's he said the grass
[30:15] withers and the flowers and the glory of
[30:18] man as the flowers of grass and that's
[30:20] so true everything here is so temporal
[30:23] look at all the people who gained all of
[30:25] those money millionaires billionaires it
[30:27] and then in a short moment of time they
[30:30] die and leave everything and they find
[30:34] themselves in a place where they're
[30:35] naked have nothing to cover their
[30:38] nakedness with money can't buy you
[30:40] nothing on the other side hallelujah
[30:44] think about it but here
[30:48] the Word of God comes to cover our
[30:50] nakedness I love that because you know
[30:54] without the word you're naked and that
[30:59] word has come to cover our nakedness you
[31:03] see my brother that's why they hide me
[31:05] in that cleft of the rock Lord cover me
[31:09] Lord so that my sin will not appear can
[31:13] you can you say your flesh isn't sinful
[31:15] all of our flesh is sinful but because
[31:19] of the covering because of the blood of
[31:21] Jesus Christ God only see the
[31:23] righteousness of Christ what up what a
[31:27] blessing what a promise that's what
[31:29] keeps me going
[31:30] when Satan tried to say oh you're not
[31:32] gonna make it you ain't this and you
[31:34] ain't that or however you know how
[31:36] his lies of gospel lies you got one
[31:40] statement you need to make God promise
[31:46] that'll shut him up because he knows no
[31:50] matter what he tries to do think about
[31:52] it look at all the things that he tried
[31:55] to take to get the men of God in trouble
[31:58] he made David do what he did right you
[32:02] know you look at you look at Moses he
[32:04] ends up killing a man cuz God knew you
[32:07] know the devil knew that Moses was
[32:10] chosen to be the deliverer he makes the
[32:13] man upset and he takes his life as if
[32:16] that's gonna change the mind of God
[32:21] Peter he denied Jesus Christ three times
[32:25] under the influence of the devil and the
[32:28] devil thought that was gonna change
[32:31] God's mind about Peter nothing can
[32:35] change the mind of God about you those
[32:39] of us who are chosen and elected to be
[32:42] the bride of Jesus Christ nothing
[32:46] hallelujah
[32:47] Oh God is so good she win election calls
[32:52] and this is what I'm this is what really
[32:54] gets me because God don't just call you
[32:57] and then when you when you when you
[33:00] respond he doesn't answer but God calls
[33:04] when you respond he answers to the call
[33:09] and it from that point on God takes you
[33:14] from point A to point Z Z is your
[33:18] completion and God will do it
[33:21] ha because you answered and you said yes
[33:27] remember there's a parallel about the
[33:29] men who who said Lord you know Lord
[33:31] Father I'll do it I'll do it and then he
[33:33] changed his mind then there was one says
[33:35] no I ain't going and all of a sudden he
[33:38] changed his mind and Jesus said which
[33:40] one did the will of the Father the one
[33:42] who changed his mind who said he wasn't
[33:44] gonna go but he win anyway right
[33:47] come on when you think about it you
[33:49] think about all
[33:50] the scriptures that we go through all of
[33:52] the things we've seen in our lives you
[33:55] think now
[33:56] who was this Jonah guy who actually got
[34:00] upset with God
[34:04] god damn blessed him and gave him a
[34:07] Gorge to hide the heat and as soon as
[34:09] the gorge died he gets mad with God does
[34:13] it make sense but it wasn't gonna change
[34:16] God's mind about him God knows we're
[34:19] nothing but flesh he knows we're nothing
[34:22] but clay you know God pity us at times
[34:24] and I know sometimes he feel like
[34:26] kicking us around but thank God he
[34:28] doesn't when we think about how God has
[34:33] been so good to us you know I love it
[34:36] the way Jeremiah says in the 29th
[34:38] chapter he said for I know the thoughts
[34:41] that I think toward you God ain't
[34:45] confused hallelujah God ain't confused
[34:49] when he looked at he looked at job and
[34:52] said Satan have you considered my
[34:54] servant job
[34:56] hallelujah joke did devil said well you
[34:58] know I I caused him to curse you and you
[35:00] didn't face God say it ain't gonna
[35:02] happen why I know what he's made out of
[35:06] that's what I'm saying God knows the
[35:09] material we made out of it ain't you
[35:12] that he have confidence in it's the
[35:14] material we made out of I'm not talking
[35:16] about the flesh-and-blood part I'm
[35:18] talking about the God part and God knows
[35:21] himself better than any of us you know
[35:26] and you think it's the oh lord have
[35:28] mercy he said I know my thoughts said
[35:30] the Lord thoughts of peace not of evil
[35:33] to give you an expected in so God is not
[35:37] up there standing there trying to find
[35:39] out how to make you sick and how to make
[35:42] you frustrated now he doesn't have those
[35:44] thoughts
[35:45] it's Lucifer or the devil that comes to
[35:48] God amen to say let me tempt him here
[35:50] and let me tempt him there however the
[35:52] case may be but when you when it boils
[35:55] down to it it's almost sound - like they
[35:58] say too good to be true
[36:01] we're already perfect
[36:05] we are already perfect in the eyes of
[36:09] God we are already perfect it's not your
[36:13] perfection its Christ's perfect
[36:14] perfection like I said a mountain can't
[36:18] be holy if the holy God is not on the
[36:20] mountain it's the holy God that makes us
[36:23] holy
[36:24] it's the perfect God in us that makes
[36:26] them makes us perfect right
[36:29] that's why the bombs just no weapon
[36:32] formed against you shall prosper none
[36:35] not one no weapon I love that the Bible
[36:40] even tells us that even in that day of
[36:42] judgment no voice will be heard no
[36:45] matter what they cook usual they can't
[36:50] win they can't win no weapon that is
[36:55] formed against thee shall prosper in
[36:56] every tongue that shall rise against the
[37:00] in judgment thou shalt condemn I love it
[37:04] he said this is the heritage of the
[37:06] servant of the Lord and their
[37:08] righteousness is of misa their
[37:12] righteousness is of me I don't have my
[37:16] own everything our own is of God
[37:22] everything hallelujah if there be any
[37:25] credit everything goes back to him
[37:28] hallelujah
[37:30] mm-hmm think about it but the man who
[37:36] was telling the story about himself and
[37:38] he said had not God stepped in and I'm
[37:42] just paraphrasing it he said my daddy
[37:45] was an alcoholic and he said more than
[37:46] likely I was gonna be one too
[37:48] see because I was going to inherit his
[37:51] demon basically it's what he's saying
[37:53] but God rich in mercy he broke that
[37:56] chain he stopped that thing he called me
[38:01] sanctified me gave me the Holy Ghost
[38:04] can you imagine he said listen all my
[38:06] brand all of the branham's were a
[38:08] riotous people they did all kinds of
[38:12] stuff he said I've got nothing to brag
[38:14] on he said only thing I have to brag
[38:17] Jesus Christ himself and that's the way
[38:20] I feel
[38:21] ain't nothing in my family line I can
[38:23] brag on the only thing I could do is
[38:25] hide my face because of a shame
[38:28] hallelujah
[38:29] but there's one person I can brag on and
[38:32] that's Jesus Christ himself he's always
[38:36] been there for me Alleluia hallelujah
[38:41] you know sometime as I said earlier we
[38:44] got to be careful that this message
[38:46] doesn't become a science you can't
[38:50] figure it out and you can't work it out
[38:55] hallelujah
[38:56] this is a life hallelujah you understand
[39:02] me
[39:02] it is life that makes us who we are
[39:05] God's life is what makes us who we are
[39:09] is not your works are your doing
[39:12] is his life the prophet of God was
[39:16] talking about birds he said you know
[39:18] every bird has their own characteristic
[39:21] and I can tell what kind of bird it is
[39:24] by the way it flies or by the way it
[39:27] sounds but every bird has his own
[39:29] characteristic that distinguishes
[39:32] distinguishes them from other birds or
[39:35] another bird and he was liking that as
[39:37] people he said don't you know he said
[39:40] that's what makes it that's the
[39:41] difference between the sinner and the
[39:44] saint
[39:44] it's the characteristics they may look
[39:47] like what they could be twins one can be
[39:49] saved and one can be unsafe you
[39:51] understand me and they're the way they
[39:54] behave the way they act the way they do
[39:57] is what determines who they are and
[40:00] that's how it is with the Christian it's
[40:02] not about church it's not about half a
[40:05] for you here and how faith you there is
[40:07] the light that you live is all about
[40:10] life it's all about the Shekinah glory
[40:12] it's all about what Adam lost in the
[40:15] beginning and that was the life that God
[40:17] gave him that which was a covering for
[40:20] him hallelujah
[40:23] that's right
[40:28] he said but today we're not born under
[40:32] that parent Tobin denominations he said
[40:35] our parent is the word I like that our
[40:42] parent is the word this is my mama and
[40:45] my daddy lujah yes sir our parent is the
[40:54] word that's right
[40:55] I was born under God to for that age but
[40:59] this is the climax this is the age
[41:02] beyond anomic this is what I'm trying to
[41:05] tell people this is the age that is
[41:07] beyond denominations we can't settle
[41:10] into a denominational or spirit of
[41:12] denominations we must fight that and go
[41:15] forward into perfection Oh they've never
[41:20] seen it before but somebody gotta
[41:22] declare it somebody gotta say email to
[41:25] the Word of God somebody got to come to
[41:27] a place and then when they believe that
[41:30] God promised it and that promises has to
[41:32] happen that's what it was when Seymour
[41:36] Seymour saw the scripture he saw wherein
[41:39] they were gifts they saw he saw the the
[41:41] axe he saw all of the gifts and they all
[41:44] those people was undaunted other than
[41:47] that inspiration and they kept pressing
[41:48] into an Impreza dent to it impressing
[41:51] into it and that's how we got a zoo zoo
[41:53] Street because somebody believed it
[41:56] enough to keep moving even though people
[41:58] were calling them crazy many of them
[42:01] left without food they live without food
[42:03] and proper clothing but they were their
[42:05] minds were set only heavenly things and
[42:08] they were not gonna settle for anything
[42:10] less
[42:12] until his bride get to that place we're
[42:16] not gonna settle for ritualistic
[42:18] services as individuals we're gonna
[42:22] press into it it's out there for us we
[42:26] just got to go beyond that veil of
[42:29] unbelief that's holding us back
[42:32] see listen so we beyond those things
[42:37] there had to come forth must come forth
[42:40] God ordained
[42:41] did so and there must come forth is that
[42:45] right how long was the book of
[42:49] Revelation written all those things
[42:54] hidden mysteries and God said in Malachi
[42:58] 4 that it was going to come a messenger
[43:00] in the book for hundreds of years but it
[43:04] could not stop the purpose of God when
[43:08] that time and that season came Malachi
[43:12] 4:2
[43:12] and if Malachi 4 was here in the days of
[43:18] Noah and Sodom was here and if those
[43:22] days were here then Malachi 4 still had
[43:27] to be revealed because there must come a
[43:30] burning of the world fire has to come
[43:33] and if the fire has to come there must
[43:37] be a people who's going to escape the
[43:39] fire they're here we are here and
[43:44] somewhere in our minds we've got that we
[43:47] got to keep calling on the name of the
[43:49] Lord Jesus until God makes it happen
[43:52] because that's what he wants they
[43:55] couldn't they would have never gotten
[43:56] out of Egypt if they would have kept
[43:59] sitting there oh well
[44:02] God will deliver some time but that was
[44:04] not the way it happened God said I have
[44:07] heard your cry somebody help me whenever
[44:13] the people get down to pray something is
[44:16] going to change
[44:16] I have the Lord your cry and I have come
[44:22] down that's the way God works mm-hmm
[44:31] when God
[44:33] I appreciate the Lord because in the Old
[44:37] Testament when God had the shewbread and
[44:41] prayed that manner that was actually
[44:44] behind the curtain of time God sustained
[44:49] it by his presence kind of like the word
[44:54] you know nothing to change it nothing
[44:57] can make it fail regardless to what age
[45:00] is in is always fresh and thinking about
[45:05] every general it had to be some good
[45:07] bridge you know they talked about it it
[45:10] had to be some good bread and I can
[45:13] imagine those priests could neither wait
[45:15] to get in there just to eat of that
[45:17] brand and here we have not in type the
[45:21] reality of what they had in tight manner
[45:25] and not spirit the bread is supposed to
[45:28] be as sweet and it's nice and it's holy
[45:32] to us as it was to them in the natural
[45:36] hallelujah it was so good
[45:38] people were that God told them not to
[45:40] hold hold it overnight how many times
[45:42] you've done that in a natural food is so
[45:46] good and you don't just throw it away
[45:47] you have what we call leftovers but God
[45:52] told him not to do it
[45:53] worms gonna get in it but it had to be
[45:56] good for them the wound the hole don't
[45:58] do it see that's what we must understand
[46:02] there's so many great things in this
[46:04] message and some of these things we've
[46:07] got to move forward
[46:08] in you understand me good when we saw
[46:12] that God would use Malachi for brother
[46:16] Banda was used by him a mighty prophet
[46:18] he meant on the face of the earth but
[46:20] now we must move on because the bride to
[46:23] move is on the bride then double of
[46:27] Norton has been on Dane for us I believe
[46:33] that oh I believe that God knows I
[46:38] believe that and I'm waiting I'm waiting
[46:41] with patience that God because God is
[46:45] gonna do it I can almost taste it he's
[46:48] coming with it hallelujah y'all know I'm
[46:53] saying there's a minute times you hadn't
[46:55] even seen the chicken in this in the
[46:57] kitchen but you smell it before you get
[46:59] there hallelujah that's all I'm talking
[47:02] about
[47:03] I could smell it it is I can see it
[47:07] coming how
[47:08] Oh God have mercy upon us oh my when the
[47:15] Holy Ghost came down and people received
[47:18] the gifts of God and oh my
[47:21] it's amazing how those people just had
[47:24] you know such an anointing they were
[47:26] staggering and drunken in the Holy Ghost
[47:29] and here with all of this word when have
[47:32] you last seen somebody drunk off the
[47:35] Holy Ghost you know what I mean I mean
[47:37] these people did they weren't ashamed
[47:39] y'all gotta understand in my day those
[47:42] people that went to those Pentecostal
[47:43] churches and apostolic churches they
[47:45] were laughed at marked at pointed and
[47:48] laughter people laugh at them not even
[47:50] knowing they were blaspheme in the Holy
[47:52] Spirit yeah it was not a good holiness
[47:56] oh man what how did you get into that
[47:58] mess that's the way they talk hallelujah
[48:02] not even realizing those people sent a
[48:05] real foundation call him Chuck whatever
[48:08] you want to call at least a shucks was
[48:10] shucks they did what they supposed to do
[48:13] now that the charm of life is coming to
[48:16] the seed what are we doing it's gotta be
[48:20] more for us God did not bring us to a
[48:22] maturity to say hey here it is Oh taste
[48:27] and see that the Lord is good that's
[48:31] what it's all about God gonna hit this
[48:33] world I'm telling you people of God
[48:35] anything gonna be a worldwide thing like
[48:37] it was with the prophet of God but
[48:39] wherever the bride is it's going to be
[48:41] shaken and God is gonna do it with the
[48:44] final outpouring hallelujah that will
[48:47] also increase the faith of God in the
[48:49] people I believe it they're going to see
[48:53] a lot of little Jesus's running around
[48:55] here Hey defying gravity defying every
[49:01] natural phenomena they're going to be a
[49:04] people that will call those things that
[49:06] be not as though they were Abraham's
[49:09] seed will be on display for a short
[49:11] quick work I believe that with all my
[49:14] heart I don't believe God is perfecting
[49:17] us and bringing us into this perfection
[49:18] Amen just to say okay we're done let's
[49:21] go
[49:22] hallelujah every good cake baked must be
[49:26] tasted hey how you gonna know what's
[49:31] good if you don't taste it and that's
[49:33] where God is God is going to give a
[49:35] little taste and then we get up out of
[49:37] here
[49:38] I believe that oh lord have mercy
[49:44] father we look at this thing and you say
[49:47] okay we're coming to the holy place and
[49:49] we understand that the holy places where
[49:51] the seven golden candlesticks are but we
[49:54] know that that's not our stopping place
[49:56] God's taking us into the Holies of
[49:58] Holies and like the prophet of God said
[50:01] there's a time where we were forbidden
[50:02] to go back there because only the high
[50:04] priest could go but now that our high
[50:07] priest Jesus Christ himself has gone
[50:09] beyond the veil the veil has been rent
[50:11] it's open for us and now it's death if
[50:14] you stay out of there so we must go into
[50:17] the Holies of Holies because that's what
[50:19] God intended for us to be we are the
[50:23] house of God we're the tabernacle of the
[50:26] Most High God hallelujah
[50:28] and I heard the Prophet God say
[50:31] something the other day I had never
[50:32] heard I'm looking for Mount Zion
[50:34] showdown and he said Mount Zion showdown
[50:37] is happening right now we didn't even
[50:42] open up I'm waiting for the squeeze and
[50:45] all of this stuff and right now we are
[50:48] doing things that we don't even realize
[50:50] we're doing and it's reflecting the
[50:52] bride of Jesus Christ it's showing who
[50:56] is the real right when you no matter
[51:00] what they say about your no job when
[51:02] it's time for them to pray who do they
[51:04] come to right they know you real
[51:10] Christians who can get real things are
[51:14] done by God's grace hallelujah see but
[51:20] not only a hot people whosoever will can
[51:23] have that same anointing of the Shekinah
[51:25] glory and walk a holy life holy holy
[51:28] holy unto the Lord and approach in his
[51:31] very presence of God through the blood
[51:33] of Jesus Christ the
[51:35] for him right it ain't just a preacher
[51:38] its whosoever will you don't have to be
[51:44] a prophet whosoever will you can be a
[51:48] housewife you can be a mean you can be a
[51:51] janitor whosoever will can approach unto
[51:56] God into that Holies of Holies whoo
[52:01] Oh Revelation chapter 4 4 so we look at
[52:06] this thing is your brother Brooks the
[52:09] closing is just a bit but you and I must
[52:13] understand there's a transformation and
[52:15] that's that's the part that I'm trying
[52:18] to emphasize that we must allow God to
[52:21] transform us we must allow God to
[52:30] transform us but transformation can only
[52:35] only happen if the transformer as it's
[52:38] on the inside you can't be transformed
[52:42] if he ain't in there
[52:43] we don't want no fake pregnancy we need
[52:47] the real deal we need to know he said in
[52:50] that day you'll know I'm in the father
[52:51] the father's in me and I am in you it's
[52:54] got to be real and I'm telling you when
[52:57] you don't see a rising of the Sun in you
[53:00] something's wrong
[53:02] the Sun must rise hallelujah
[53:07] no matter what your experience is if
[53:10] it's a headache
[53:11] if it's it's trouble if it's upset if
[53:13] it's this that or the other you still
[53:16] walking in the light of God you're
[53:19] living in this a kind of glory living
[53:21] there where Jesus is in the in his
[53:23] presence that all things work together
[53:25] for good to them that love God and
[53:27] you'll love him and you're walking in
[53:30] that mellow soft sweet humble Christian
[53:33] life mm-hmm I like that mellow sweet
[53:37] humble and you could only find a few
[53:40] like that
[53:42] mellow sweet and humble come out rock it
[53:45] in their Christian life a
[53:49] if anything if anything I'll be saying
[53:51] lord help us preach us it's hard to find
[53:56] out how much sweet and mellow preacher
[54:02] oh yes
[54:06] the thing that I love about is this you
[54:11] can't I'm going to the blood transfusion
[54:15] you can't transfuse a pig blood with a
[54:19] cow only pigs can be dead blood can be
[54:25] transfused to the other a human being
[54:30] even that you have to be careful about
[54:33] because it must match whatever type of
[54:39] blood it is it must match but in it
[54:42] funny that no matter how what your type
[54:45] of blood is is in the natural God can
[54:49] give you a blood transfusion no matter
[54:53] what you are a B or C you don't be B+
[54:56] whatever God can still transfuse you and
[55:01] after the transfusion that blood of
[55:05] Jesus changes you and transform you into
[55:11] a son of God and you will no longer be
[55:16] or a or whatever it is the blood of
[55:19] Jesus Christ that runs through your vein
[55:21] is the blood of God think about it so
[55:26] the only way that God can give a
[55:29] transfusion to a person that person must
[55:33] be of the same blood type amen
[55:39] so it and you so what do you mean that's
[55:41] where the seed come in because the seed
[55:44] itself is Christ and that blood seed
[55:47] must match his blood in order for him to
[55:51] give you a transfusion and you live mmm
[55:56] right so you look at these things and
[56:00] like I said this morning nothing costs
[56:02] is cheap and you were not cheap God paid
[56:08] the highest price there was for your yo
[56:11] Redemption in mind and that's what he
[56:14] did so we think about it and the prophet
[56:20] of God was talking about women and he
[56:21] said how difficult it is to get one like
[56:24] this he said a meek and humble spirit is
[56:27] a great treasure to God and the Bible
[56:30] said for a woman to adorn themselves
[56:32] with the meat and humble spirit subject
[56:35] to your husband's and sweetness that's
[56:38] what a great price is in the sight of
[56:40] God so you got to understand that's a
[56:43] great price it's costly but the reward
[56:48] for a woman if she can humble herself to
[56:50] that will be twice as much of the ban
[56:52] when we get over there think about it
[56:56] knowing by God's grace that God is doing
[57:00] a great work in us and I'm a closing
[57:04] just a minute one thing I know in my
[57:10] life I don't know by anybody else's life
[57:15] but the boy I press the more difficult
[57:21] things seem to become and the more you
[57:25] press the more you begin to see more
[57:29] unexpected it's always the unexpected
[57:32] things that sometime catches you where
[57:37] you have to stop for a moment and
[57:39] regroup and I think by God's grace that
[57:44] wants you when the state Satan comes in
[57:46] here a texture because he comes on
[57:48] sometimes Satan comes with an ambush
[57:52] surprises you and the only reason the
[57:56] only way that you will be defeated is
[57:59] that you allow the ambush to place fear
[58:03] within you because the Bible tells us
[58:06] that perfect love casts out fear and so
[58:11] when the fear comes in it takes the Holy
[58:13] Spirit in you to put
[58:16] fear where it belongs and once fears
[58:19] moved away you are the Conqueror right
[58:23] faith comes and takes over according to
[58:28] Isaiah 59 and and close on this so shall
[58:34] they fear on the nineteenth first the
[58:36] name of the Lord from the West and its
[58:39] glory from the rising of the Sun when
[58:42] the enemy shall come in like a flood the
[58:44] Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[58:47] standard against him now that's the part
[58:49] I don't know I understand but my point
[58:52] is is why people don't want the spirit
[58:56] you know what is it that people don't
[58:58] want the Holy Ghost moving in the church
[59:01] see they don't mind him shouting and
[59:04] dancing that's not what I'm talking
[59:06] about
[59:06] I'm talking about when the Holy Spirit
[59:09] moves and and and the word of God word
[59:11] of knowledge or whatever it is God comes
[59:13] right through the preaching and whatever
[59:15] discern your thoughts or identify the
[59:18] word you know the Holy Ghost is there
[59:20] cuz you know that when you leave out
[59:22] here you changed see that's what I try
[59:25] to tell people I'm not interested in
[59:27] being stirred I want to be changed the
[59:31] Word of God came to change us has come
[59:34] to change us from glory to glory to
[59:37] glory I want to see progress in me and
[59:46] the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto
[59:49] them that turned from dregs
[59:50] transgression in Jacob said the Lord as
[59:53] for me this is my covenant with them
[59:55] said the Lord my spirit that is upon
[59:57] thee my words without put in that mouth
[1:00:00] shall not depart out of that mouth Lord
[1:00:03] don't let your words depart out of my
[1:00:05] mouth not out of my mouth nor out of the
[1:00:09] mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth
[1:00:12] of thy seed seed said the Lord from his
[1:00:15] forth and for ever
[1:00:18] why you can't be nothing that you ain't
[1:00:23] all you can be is what you are and if
[1:00:27] God has made you a son and daughter of
[1:00:28] God nothing can
[1:00:31] the Bible said heaven and earth to pass
[1:00:35] away but the word of the Lord shall
[1:00:37] stand one more scripture Psalms 104 31
[1:00:41] the glory of the Lord shall endure
[1:00:44] forever the Lord shall rejoice in his
[1:00:48] works and you are his works he's going
[1:00:52] to rejoice in his words let us stand

[1:01:02] humbly as we know how we thank you for
[1:01:03] being so good to us Lord a little simple
[1:01:08] message but Lord it just somehow stirs
[1:01:10] my soul when I see what all you're done
[1:01:14] you have done and is doing I know that
[1:01:17] with all the time that we have nothing
[1:01:19] can change those decisions that you made
[1:01:23] before the foundation of the world
[1:01:25] I realize Lord God that your decisions
[1:01:29] that you have made has been in my favor
