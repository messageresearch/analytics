[0:06] God, God will surely feed you. Amen.
[0:10] I love

[0:14] savior. When the storms are
[0:17] raging, he's my
[0:20] shelter. Wherever he leads
[0:23] me, I will follow.
[0:27] I love
[0:28] Jesus and he loved
[0:31] me. Oh, I love
[0:34] Jesus. He's my savior. When the storms
[0:37] are raised on,
[0:40] he's my shelter.
[0:43] Wherever he leads me, I will follow.
[0:48] I love
[0:50] Jesus and he loves me once again.
[0:55] Oh, I love
[0:57] Jesus. Oh, he's my savior. When the
[1:00] storms are raging,
[1:02] ra. Oh, he's my
[1:05] shelter. Wherever he leads
[1:08] me, I will
[1:11] follow. I love
[1:14] Jesus and he loves
[1:18] me. Jesus.
[1:23] Jesus. No other name under heaven can
[1:28] save us.
[1:32] Jesus.
[1:34] Jesus. No other name.
[1:40] Oh
[1:43] Jesus. Jesus.
[1:47] No other name under heaven can save us.
[1:54] Jesus.
[1:57] Jesus. No other name. I know. Bless that
[2:02] wonderful bless that wonderful name of
[2:07] Jesus. Oh, bless that wonderful name of
[2:12] Jesus. Hallelujah. Bless that wonderful
[2:15] name.
[2:18] Jesus. Oh no other name.
[2:23] Say that once again. Oh bless that
[2:25] wonderful name of
[2:28] Jesus. Oh
[2:31] blessed. Oh
[2:33] my. Hallelujah. Bless that wonderful
[2:37] name Jesus.
[2:40] Oh, no other name I know.
[2:47] Amen.
[2:48] Hallelujah.
[2:52] If there is another name, I tell you
[2:55] what it is. It's a golden calf.
[3:01] Hallelujah. A beast that's worshiped.
[3:04] Hallelujah. There's only one true living
[3:06] God. Amen. You love the Lord. Amen. As
[3:10] we
[3:11] stand, going to have you open up the
[3:13] word of God with us. I trust that you be
[3:17] blessed here
[3:18] tonight. Amen. Um I must have leaned
[3:23] upon my marker and got a little pink on
[3:25] me. That's the only time I wear
[3:28] it. We love the Lord.
[3:31] Amen. Amen.
[3:34] I'm going to ask that you turn with us
[3:36] to
[3:41] Deuteronomy the 18th chapter 13th
[3:45] verse. Love God. Amen. Surely without
[3:49] him where will we be? 18th chapter 13th
[3:53] verse. And then we're going to ask that
[3:55] you turn with us to Hebrews 10:14.
[4:01] Deuteronomy
[4:09] 18:13, "Thou shall be perfect with the
[4:14] Lord thy God."
[4:18] But these nation which thou shalt
[4:21] possess, hearken unto observers of
[4:24] times, and unto divers. But as for thee,
[4:27] the Lord thy God have not suffered thee
[4:30] to do so.
[4:33] Hebrews
[4:39] 10:14. I'm wondering how many people
[4:41] really believe that we're living in the
[4:42] last days.
[4:45] Prophecy being fulfilled. Amen. Right in
[4:47] our
[4:48] eyes. Hebrews 10:14.
[4:55] For by one
[4:58] offering he have perfected
[5:01] forever them that are sanctifying.
[5:08] Oh my. You love the Lord.
[5:11] Heavenly Father God, we come before you.
[5:14] We thank you for your grace and your
[5:17] mercy. We thank you for being so real to
[5:20] us. And God, without you, we are
[5:23] nothing. We thank you for this little
[5:26] group, Lord, that have come in the midst
[5:28] of the
[5:29] weak, Lord. Many perhaps tired, weary,
[5:34] but one touch from you.
[5:37] Oh God, that's all we need, Lord. And
[5:40] Father God, you are still Jehovah Gyra.
[5:45] And Lord, we realize our father that
[5:47] you're El Shi,
[5:49] even as the prophet of God say, we who
[5:52] are the covenant people can draw from
[5:55] the breast of El Shadi. And Lord, we're
[5:58] drawing from you tonight. We're drawing
[6:01] the virtues of healing and deliverance,
[6:03] Lord. Oh, and physical strength,
[6:06] spiritual strength. We ask these things
[6:09] in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[6:12] You may be seated.
[6:17] Surely God is good to us. Amen.
[6:22] We want to preach our minister by the
[6:26] grace of
[6:27] God on a little
[6:30] thought. We were talking with a
[6:33] particular brother today and I didn't
[6:35] know what God was going to do for me or
[6:38] for
[6:39] us. Just wanted to find the mind of God.
[6:44] And I've had several brothers minister
[6:47] to me in the course of a few
[6:50] weeks and I am grateful to the Lord for
[6:53] doing
[6:55] so. Tonight we w would like to minister
[6:59] on the splendor of the Lord. You can
[7:03] call it the glory of God or you can call
[7:06] it the shikina of the Lord.
[7:09] We realize first of all we must
[7:11] understand that we are under an
[7:13] unconditional
[7:14] covenant. It's not what I do. It's what
[7:18] God has already done for us.
[7:21] No man came to God and none of us come
[7:23] to God. Matter of fact, after the fall
[7:25] of man, we have been running from God
[7:27] ever
[7:28] since. But it's God who draws us. And
[7:32] Jesus said, "No man can come unto me
[7:34] except the father draw him." Amen. But
[7:37] we realize by the grace of God, Amen,
[7:39] that this covenant that God gave us,
[7:43] Amen, he gave it to us because he
[7:47] realized not that he discovered it. God
[7:50] always knew we could never keep it. But
[7:52] I believe by the grace of God, God
[7:54] allowed us by way of judges, by way of
[7:57] the law, by way of different things of
[8:00] the Old Testament that we as men may
[8:02] see. As brother Brandham say, we're
[8:05] failures to begin with. So if we could
[8:08] just see by the grace of God that this
[8:10] thing is so predestinated by God. And
[8:14] sometimes I almost I'm afraid to preach
[8:16] predestination sometime because it makes
[8:19] a lot of Christians lazy.
[8:22] But it's not to make you lazy.
[8:25] It is there so that you and I can get uh
[8:29] uh strength
[8:31] and and we can we can draw from that and
[8:34] have such a perfect faith. Yes, sir.
[8:37] Amen. Till our faith will become
[8:39] undisturbed.
[8:42] Amen.
[8:44] When we work with an unconditional
[8:47] covenant, it means
[8:50] that God is not expecting anything out
[8:53] of you.
[8:55] to help him do the job.
[9:00] Now, I want you to understand this now
[9:02] because when you are predestinated,
[9:04] there is an anointing
[9:06] that goes with it. Amen.
[9:10] Hallelujah. Now I was thinking today
[9:12] even this evening how uh
[9:16] Tamar and we look at her and I'm not
[9:18] going to go through the whole story but
[9:21] it was the grace of
[9:23] God that was moving Tamar to do what she
[9:27] did. Amen. Amen. It wasn't her wisdom.
[9:31] Amen. It was God's anointed, her, his
[9:35] wisdom that caused her to move into an
[9:38] area that she perhaps would have never
[9:41] moved.
[9:43] Had not it been the sovereign grace of
[9:44] God. And by moving, she's now in the
[9:49] Hall of Fame. Hallelujah. Amen. When God
[9:52] calls us, we understand that, you know,
[9:55] the the the splendor of God or the glory
[9:58] of God, however you want to say it, is
[10:01] something that can never happen except
[10:05] God presence is there. Amen.
[10:08] When God created Adam and God looked at
[10:12] Adam and said it was good, understand
[10:15] the glory of God. The splendor of God
[10:18] was radiating. Yes, sir. Amen. through
[10:21] Adam so much it produced a veil. Amen.
[10:25] And the veil, Amen, was so upon him,
[10:28] Amen, that he didn't even know he he was
[10:31] naked.
[10:33] That's good. Now, we know that we'll
[10:35] never go back to that state again. Amen.
[10:38] Because the prophet of God said that
[10:40] after this is all said and done, we'll
[10:42] still have we'll have clothing. Amen.
[10:46] But we'll never forget. Amen.
[10:50] Amen. Where we come from. Now you say,
[10:54] "Well, well, brothers, what are what
[10:56] where are you working with?" I am coming
[10:58] to a place because I'm trying to work
[10:59] several things. I'm trying to get you to
[11:03] understand how God has always
[11:06] displayed
[11:08] really an unconditional covenant to his
[11:13] people. Amen. Even though he never sat
[11:16] at the conference table with them, had
[11:18] he judged them according to their sins,
[11:22] nobody would have made it. Amen. Amen.
[11:25] Even when Adam had sinned, God told him,
[11:29] "The day that you you you eat of this
[11:30] tree, you should surely die." And
[11:33] understand, God separated himself from
[11:36] Adam. Amen.
[11:38] And Adam, amen, was no way on his way to
[11:42] find God.
[11:44] According to the prophet God, amen, we
[11:47] realize, amen, that Adam hid himself.
[11:50] Amen.
[11:51] But it was the grace of God. Hallelujah.
[11:54] That sought Adam and Eve out and said,
[11:57] "Where are you?" Amen. As you have
[12:00] heard, Amen. Angels, a third or more,
[12:02] fell from heaven and God didn't move.
[12:05] But when man moved out of his position,
[12:08] God came down. Amen. So you see there
[12:12] was a love, there was a connection.
[12:15] I looked that word up and it talks about
[12:17] Lucifer how he was beautiful and
[12:19] perfect. But understand he was only
[12:21] beautiful and perfect in a structural
[12:24] way. He wasn't perfected in the sense
[12:27] that he was eternal.
[12:31] Amen. Hello somebody. He was a creation.
[12:35] He never was a true son. Even Come on,
[12:38] somebody. Amen. He had
[12:42] everything. As as the prophet of God
[12:44] said, he was he he was he was God's
[12:46] right-hand man. Is that right? Amen. He
[12:49] had everything but the ability to
[12:52] create. There's only one ability to
[12:54] create. There's only one thing that God
[12:56] can give you to give you uh that you
[12:59] could have to to have the ability to
[13:02] create. And that's God himself. Amen.
[13:05] Now, Satan knows how to pervert, but he
[13:08] he Oh, come on, somebody. We have an
[13:12] opportunity to get something that Satan
[13:15] throughout eons never had. Amen. Amen.
[13:20] So, that's why he want to keep you from
[13:21] the Holy Ghost. That's why he don't want
[13:24] you to be truly born again. Amen.
[13:26] Because he realized only thing that gets
[13:29] to heaven is holiness.
[13:32] Hallelujah.
[13:37] We look at a scripture and then God
[13:39] begins to work with Abraham and and and
[13:42] and and and Abraham we call is called
[13:44] the father of faith. Is that right?
[13:47] Amen. And the Bible said that Abraham
[13:49] believed God and and it was uh counted
[13:52] to him and imputed to him as
[13:54] righteousness. Amen. And according to
[13:57] Amen, James 2:23, he says, "Not only
[14:00] that, but from that point on, he was
[14:02] called the friend of God." Hallelujah.
[14:07] I like that. Amen. Because, Amen. When
[14:11] you are standing for the word, you are a
[14:14] true friend of God. Amen. He calls me
[14:18] friend. Amen. Is that right? Amen. Oh, I
[14:22] like Deuteronomy when it says, "Thou
[14:25] shalt be perfect." Amen. With the Lord
[14:28] thy God. Now, you think that's
[14:32] something when the children of Israel
[14:35] were murmuring and complaining to Moses,
[14:38] and I I'm going to come back to this in
[14:40] just a moment about the meat. See, they
[14:44] were always murmuring and complaining
[14:46] and and Moses says, "Listen, are are you
[14:49] going to murmur and
[14:51] complain to
[14:53] us?" He uh uh basically united himself
[14:57] with God. Amen. Y'all understand me?
[15:00] Amen. Because Amen. as long as Moses
[15:03] stood there, he was the veil of God.
[15:07] Amen.
[15:09] So they looked at the man and they
[15:11] thought they were talking to a man, but
[15:14] they failed to see that the shakina
[15:15] glory was behind the veil of that man.
[15:21] Oh, come on, somebody. And Moses typed
[15:24] out the law. If God can do such a thing
[15:27] under the law, what will God do under
[15:30] grace?
[15:34] Hallelujah. Matthew 5:48 says, "Be
[15:37] therefore perfect." Amen. Even as your
[15:40] father, I like that. My father is
[15:43] perfect. And if I'm born of him, that
[15:46] makes me perfect. Amen. Amen. He said,
[15:49] "Be perfect, even as your father which
[15:51] is in heaven is perfect." Amen. Now, the
[15:54] prophet God said, God could never
[15:56] require that of you except he make a way
[16:00] for this to be possible.
[16:03] I'm getting excited now. Amen. Because I
[16:06] want you to realize, amen, that this
[16:09] shakina, this this journey that we're
[16:11] taking, remember the scripture says, you
[16:13] you never traveled this way before.
[16:16] Amen. We can see through the scriptures
[16:17] and we can get some examples. Amen. In
[16:20] type of what God is expecting out of us,
[16:24] but you and I must understand that
[16:26] Abraham is the perfect example. Yes.
[16:29] Amen. Hallelujah. Brother Brandon said
[16:31] it like this. He said, "We are the
[16:33] covenant people." Amen. Just as Abraham
[16:36] was a covenant man, we are the seed of
[16:39] Abraham and therefore we are the
[16:41] covenant people.
[16:46] First of all, God got to make you know
[16:47] you not equipped to do nothing but
[16:50] believe God.
[16:54] Hallelujah. Every time Abraham tried to
[16:57] help God, he got in trouble. Amen.
[17:03] You understand this? This don't make you
[17:05] lazy.
[17:07] Well, if God want me to do something,
[17:08] he'll pull me out of the bed. If God
[17:11] want me to pray, he'll knock me out of
[17:13] it. No, sir. Brother B said, "God ain't
[17:16] pulling you through no tube." Amen. He
[17:19] ain't going to pull you through the
[17:20] tube. But if you are like it, there's
[17:23] something on the inside of you that's
[17:26] stirring you to do the perfect will of
[17:29] God,
[17:31] he doesn't have to. He He don't He He
[17:33] God is a shepherd.
[17:36] He He's not driving you like cattle
[17:38] right now. But he can do it.
[17:43] Is that all right? Listen. Word of God
[17:46] says Hebrews, I love this. For by one
[17:48] offering he has perfected. I like that
[17:51] word perfected because it's a it's a
[17:53] it's a word of process.
[17:56] Uh you're going to move. Amen. From the
[17:58] foundation of faith all the way up,
[18:00] Amen. to the perfect stature of Christ.
[18:02] Hallelujah. Amen. Without murmuring.
[18:05] Amen. Without complaining. Amen.
[18:09] Hallelujah. Without trying to tell the
[18:11] shepherd how to lead you.
[18:14] Come on, somebody. Amen. And the only
[18:17] way that can be done, you got to have
[18:20] the shepherd.
[18:22] Now, we saw what they saw. They saw uh
[18:26] the children of Israel. Amen. They
[18:28] actually saw on Mount Si. They saw the
[18:32] glory of God. They saw the shakina
[18:35] glory. They saw the pillar of fire.
[18:37] However you want to put it, they saw it.
[18:39] They heard God speak. Amen. The Bible
[18:42] said when he spoke, it shook the earth.
[18:45] Hallelujah. Now, I don't know about you,
[18:47] that would have scared me if I wasn't
[18:49] secure. Hallelujah. But you see, God
[18:51] said he going to shake it again. And let
[18:54] me tell you something. Only those Amen.
[18:56] who seal with the Holy Ghost are the
[19:00] only one that'll be riding in a hiding
[19:03] place. Is that right? Hide me or hide me
[19:07] until the storm is passed.
[19:11] Amen. Come on, somebody. I'm enjoying
[19:13] myself here. Now we realize by the grace
[19:16] of God that this be perfect. It means
[19:20] the
[19:21] consummation of human
[19:23] integrity and virtue full grown. And
[19:29] that's what's wrong with a lot of people
[19:30] in the message. They won't grow
[19:32] up. Now let me put it this way. Have you
[19:36] ever seen a tree
[19:39] grow? But God says, "Amen. You're
[19:42] likened under trees." Amen. You can
[19:44] stare a tree down all day and you'll
[19:47] never see it grow because it's a
[19:50] slow process.
[19:53] Hallelujah. But that process is sure. As
[19:56] long as it's being watered, as long as
[19:59] the sun is shining. Hallelujah. Amen. It
[20:02] is growing.
[20:05] Amen. Hello. Amen. You're growing and
[20:08] you don't even know it cuz you're
[20:10] staring in the mirror trying to see it
[20:12] with your natural eyes. Amen.
[20:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[20:19] When you start seeing yourself growing,
[20:21] talk to me about
[20:23] it. Amen. Amen. But you see, the
[20:27] individual that's watching the tree can
[20:31] declare, "Man, you're growing."
[20:35] Amen. Right. really because understand
[20:37] your life is visible to someone else.
[20:41] Even when you can't see it.
[20:44] Hello. Come on somebody. Let's move on
[20:47] now. Listen. In the message perfection,
[20:50] he re he says God requires
[20:54] perfection. We want to bear that in mind
[20:57] that there's nothing just part way can
[21:00] go into the presence of God. It must be
[21:05] perfect. I
[21:07] worship everything.
[21:10] In other words, your worship must be
[21:13] perfect. And I explain to you, that's
[21:16] what Peter was saying. Amen. In building
[21:18] these things, listen, you can't add to
[21:20] it. It's the seed of God that's in you.
[21:23] You get that seed quickened, it will do
[21:27] the rest. Amen. Hallelujah. A farmer
[21:31] don't go out there and dig it up all the
[21:32] time and say, "Is it there? Is it there?
[21:34] Is it growing? Is it growing?" No, sir.
[21:36] He leaves it up to the law of nature.
[21:40] And that law of nature is God. Amen.
[21:43] That's right. Amen.
[21:47] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[21:50] You know, one thing is just really
[21:52] hitting me. The Bible said it many times
[21:54] or said it and we've heard it preached.
[21:56] Abraham staggered not at the promises of
[21:59] God. He couldn't understand how it was
[22:02] going to happen. He didn't try to
[22:05] analyze it. He didn't try to dissect it.
[22:08] But he believed God. Amen. And he never
[22:10] staggered at it. Amen. He didn't care
[22:12] how old he got, how backsliden it
[22:15] looked. And don't tell me he didn't
[22:16] backslide. He backslid several times.
[22:20] But God made an unconditional covenant.
[22:25] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. And you
[22:27] and I backslide every day. But God
[22:30] doesn't look at that. He looks at the
[22:33] covenant that he's made. You thank God
[22:37] for this.
[22:44] Tell you not to go down to Egypt. And
[22:46] you know you
[22:47] do. Yeah. Y'all hear what I'm saying? He
[22:50] said, "Go left and you go right." You
[22:52] know, that's that's just human nature.
[22:55] But the thing is that thing got to die.
[23:00] Now in the garden of Eden, God had Adam
[23:02] and Eve in the garden and they sinned
[23:04] and transgressed the laws of God by
[23:06] sinning, disobedient. And when
[23:08] transgressions come, disobedient is
[23:10] transgression of the law and the law of
[23:12] God. Him being holy, just,
[23:15] unadulterated, holy. Therefore, no spot
[23:18] of unholiness can ever stand in his
[23:21] presence.
[23:23] How can God come in here then? How can
[23:26] the spirit of God come in here? Amen.
[23:28] And and you're unclean.
[23:31] Hello, somebody. You know what it is?
[23:33] It's the blood of Jesus. Amen. It is the
[23:36] only reason why God can connect himself
[23:39] with you and I. And that's the blood of
[23:42] Jesus. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[23:46] Sanctifies you.
[23:54] So if sin came in now listen you got to
[23:57] understand this
[23:58] now Moses you you think about how Moses
[24:01] get into the presence of God like he did
[24:05] when God when Moses met God he did not
[24:08] have a sacrifice
[24:10] right
[24:12] there was no burnt
[24:15] offering but God God had already
[24:18] justified Moses before the foundation of
[24:21] the world. The lamb was slain before the
[24:23] foundation of the world. All God had to
[24:25] do is go back and pull it up and say,
[24:27] "It's fixed." Amen.
[24:29] That's who covered you. That's what
[24:32] covered you in that while you were
[24:33] sinners, God slay slew a l Oh, come on,
[24:37] somebody. He could look and say, "Oh my,
[24:39] he's under the blood." Even though he's
[24:41] a sinner yet.
[24:44] See, because you wasn't just, you didn't
[24:46] come sons. You always were. Amen. You
[24:50] just didn't know it.
[24:54] I mean, I'm I'm getting excited. I'm
[24:55] trying to finish this thing. It's a lie.
[24:57] But listen, I want you to understand by
[24:59] the grace of God what God is doing. Then
[25:02] sin must be dealt with. Because a lot of
[25:04] time people say, "Well, I'm under
[25:06] grace." Yes, you are. So was Abraham,
[25:09] and Abraham had to pay for his sin.
[25:12] Amen.
[25:14] Jacob had to pay for his, and he was
[25:16] under the covenant. Amen.
[25:20] Right. Oh yeah. Sometime it doesn't come
[25:22] speedily, but God knows how to slow walk
[25:28] you. Is that okay? I'm trying to get to
[25:31] it. I'm trying to get to it. And
[25:32] understand sin is unbelief. It took a
[25:35] prophet to tell us that. We thought sin
[25:38] was drinking, smoking, cursing, and
[25:40] carousing. And he says, "Uhuh. That's
[25:42] the fruit of sin." The world still
[25:44] thinks sin is those attributes.
[25:49] But it's because you
[25:50] disbelieve is why you do what you do.
[25:56] Is that Come on, somebody. It's because
[25:58] you disbelieve. Listen, if God say you
[26:01] changed and the devil say you you're not
[26:03] changed, you have a choice to believe
[26:06] what the devil tells you and what God
[26:07] has says.
[26:11] It goes right back to the Garden of
[26:12] Eden.
[26:14] Eve had to make a choice to believe God,
[26:17] what God said or what the devil said.
[26:19] And by doubting, like I taught last
[26:21] night in Bible study, doubting and fear.
[26:23] All you got to do is doubt. Doubt will
[26:25] bring fear and fear will bring torment.
[26:30] Amen. Right? The spirit of fear, Amen,
[26:33] doesn't make you a coward. The spirit of
[26:36] fear uh brings you to a place where you
[26:38] could be courageous or you could be a
[26:40] coward. You make a choice. on whether
[26:43] I'll be a coward or whether I'll be
[26:45] courageous.
[26:48] You always have a choice when it comes
[26:51] to fear.
[26:53] You say, "Oh, no, no, no, no. The Bible
[26:55] said that per that perfect love cast out
[26:57] fear." Amen. So fear is coming,
[27:01] right? Why you say, "Oh, what do you
[27:03] mean, brother?" Listen, danger being
[27:06] being in danger doesn't mean that you
[27:08] have to have fear.
[27:10] Amen. Right? That's what God taught us.
[27:13] Moses saw his life endangered and he
[27:16] began to cry out, "Oh, God." You know,
[27:18] just like the people, they saw the lie.
[27:20] And yeah, I'm I'm preaching what I
[27:22] taught last night, but it's true. It's
[27:24] in your mind.
[27:26] The battle of fear is in your mind.
[27:29] That's right. Amen.
[27:32] You have to make a choice. That's why
[27:33] God said, "Why cry? Speak, Moses." Amen.
[27:36] I'm with you.
[27:38] Fear is when you let your mind determine
[27:41] the end. Lord,
[27:46] you didn't even contact God about it.
[27:48] You done determined it in your mind. You
[27:51] got cancer. Oh, I'm going to die. Did
[27:52] God say that? No, sir.
[27:56] Y'all understand what I'm saying? It's
[27:57] what we allow it to happen.
[28:01] Come on. Let's move on. By the grace of
[28:03] God, I don't know. I'll just pull that
[28:04] way. Amen. See, we don't deserve
[28:07] anything from God.
[28:11] We don't deserve anything from God. But
[28:14] one thing for about God, even in the
[28:16] type when it came to the sacrifice of
[28:18] the dove, God never separated the dove.
[28:21] He separated the lamb and the bullock
[28:23] and whatever more. Amen. Separating law
[28:25] from grace. But when it came to the
[28:28] dove, she remained whole. Why? Because
[28:30] it was a type of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[28:33] Amen. It was a type of God's mercy. It
[28:35] was God type of God healing. God healed
[28:37] in the Old Testament. God heals in the
[28:39] New Testament. Amen. Hello, somebody.
[28:41] I'm talking about Amen. the splendor of
[28:44] God. I'm talking about the glory of God.
[28:47] Amen.
[28:49] Let me move on.
[28:51] There is no law and there is no justice.
[28:54] But law required or justice requires a
[28:56] law. And the law when it calls on it
[28:58] protects justice. Now by that law, no
[29:01] flesh is saved. That's right. H Which
[29:04] one you rather have? Lord, grace give me
[29:07] grace, Lord. Because grace is
[29:09] unmmerited.
[29:11] It's God's favor toward you. Don't get
[29:13] mad cuz God loved me.
[29:16] He loves you, too, if you can receive
[29:18] it. Right now, the law cannot save us.
[29:22] The law is just the things that put us
[29:24] in jail. But it's it has no redeeming
[29:27] power. The law only showed us that we
[29:29] were sinners and condemned. That's what
[29:31] the law is to do is to
[29:33] condemnation or to show you where you
[29:36] where your mistake is. So the law in
[29:39] itself could not save. It could only
[29:43] prosecute. And God being holy and just
[29:45] he had to have a prosecution. He had to
[29:49] prosecute the sinner because he had
[29:51] overstepped the boundaries of grace and
[29:53] had become a lawbreaking citizen. then
[29:55] he must be dealt with and every law has
[29:58] a penalty and for the penalty of
[30:00] transgressing God's law is death and it
[30:03] had to project death to the human race
[30:06] and all the human race is under the
[30:09] penalty of this law and now when Adam
[30:12] and Eve has sinned there was no way no
[30:14] other remedy that they could ever stand
[30:17] in the presence of God again except this
[30:19] sin be dealt with
[30:22] now when the lamb opened the book Huh? I
[30:25] love this. This is such a powerful
[30:27] revelation to me. No man was worthy.
[30:31] Amen.
[30:32] Hallelujah.
[30:34] It take all the religion out of you.
[30:36] That's right.
[30:38] It take all of the hot air out of you
[30:40] when you realize no man was worthy.
[30:42] Amen. Paul, come on. Moses,
[30:48] huh? Come on, somebody. No man was
[30:50] worthy. They all failed. First of all,
[30:54] they were born in sin. There was nothing
[30:56] in their bodies that could redeem you.
[30:59] But Jesus, who had a body who could
[31:01] redeem you.
[31:04] Not only his body, his blood. Come on,
[31:06] somebody. Hallelujah.
[31:10] Body that veil
[31:12] rent a holy veil. He was the only one
[31:15] that had a holy veil. Amen.
[31:19] Right here. Here it was the devil and
[31:21] everybody else was looking for the
[31:23] fountain of life and the fountain of
[31:24] youth. And here it was walking in a 33
[31:26] year old man by the name of Jesus.
[31:29] Hallelujah. He was the kind of glory.
[31:32] Hallelujah. He was God. Amen. Manifested
[31:35] in the flesh. And here the everybody the
[31:37] whole world looking for eternal life.
[31:40] And they stared the tree of life in the
[31:42] face and couldn't recognize it.
[31:46] He spoke life. I am the bread of life. I
[31:49] am that rock. Amen. I am. And before
[31:52] Moses was I am, he spoke those things
[31:55] and they didn't even have ears to hear.
[31:58] Hallelujah.
[32:00] Come on, somebody. Here it was. God.
[32:02] Remember now, the tree of life was also
[32:05] in the in the book of Genesis. Brother
[32:07] Bam says so. He said the tree of life
[32:09] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[32:11] evil were both persons, people. Trees.
[32:15] Like Adam and Eve were trees. Come on,
[32:17] somebody. He said they were there and
[32:19] here God in Morphe come right down again
[32:23] born of a virgin.
[32:30] Hallelujah.
[32:31] Y'all understand me? So we look at this
[32:33] thing and we say, "Well, brother, what
[32:35] are you saying?" I'm I'm saying, listen,
[32:36] we uh uh uh being that we were
[32:42] disconnected. Let me let me read
[32:44] something here. how difficult it is with
[32:47] not difficult for God, but how man seem
[32:49] to be so difficult to deal with. I
[32:51] marvel and and maybe you don't, but I
[32:54] marvel at at God's grace for
[32:57] me. I can't even hardly put up with
[33:00] myself more and God puts up with me. I
[33:04] honestly I do. I marvel. I marvel at the
[33:07] battles that I have during the day. Some
[33:09] things shouldn't even be battles.
[33:15] You know what I'm saying? I' I've come a
[33:16] ways and some things shouldn't even be
[33:18] battle. And I when I find myself though
[33:20] God gave me victory, I think to myself,
[33:22] why did I have to wrestle with that?
[33:25] Y'all understand what I'm saying? Why
[33:27] did I have to wrestle with that?
[33:31] Amen. So, let's move on. By the grace of
[33:32] God, I'm talking about the glory of God.
[33:35] What is this all about? You and I, we
[33:38] can look in the book of Revelation and
[33:39] see the the the city of God coming down
[33:42] with the new Jerusalem with the glory of
[33:44] God. But you see the reason why she can
[33:46] come down with the glory of God because
[33:48] she went up with it. Amen. Amen.
[33:51] Hallelujah. You can't come down with it
[33:53] unless you go up with it.
[33:57] Oh, come on, somebody. That means we got
[33:59] to get that here before we go up there.
[34:04] The prophet of God said, listen, I love
[34:05] this. He said, "You got to have 10
[34:07] buckets." He said, "The five foolish had
[34:09] five. Foolish had five." He said, "The
[34:11] wise had had 10." He said, "You have a
[34:14] you have to f five buckets to get you to
[34:15] the door and five buckets to get you
[34:17] in." Amen.
[34:22] Huh? Because remember, even the foolish
[34:24] versions got to the door. They came to
[34:27] the door, but they couldn't get in. Why?
[34:30] They didn't have the Holy Ghost. They
[34:32] didn't have that token life that took
[34:34] them all the way up and completed the
[34:36] work. They wouldn't let the blood of
[34:39] Jesus here perfect them.
[34:45] Did you notice how Israel got messed up?
[34:48] Because they were always murmuring and
[34:50] complaining about their carnal
[34:53] situations. And that's how the devil
[34:55] gets us. Come on. Amen. They It was
[34:58] always their God had become their
[35:00] bellies.
[35:03] Come on, somebody. Amen. And that's
[35:06] what's wrong. Amen. We look and we say,
[35:08] "Oh my goodness." Amen. We complain
[35:11] about this. We complain about that. It
[35:13] was all natural things. There was nobody
[35:16] who asked for anything
[35:19] spiritual. God, you got to supply my
[35:22] needs. Come on, somebody. I would rather
[35:24] be somewhere drinking branch water and
[35:26] eating eating soda crack cuz Amen. and
[35:28] and have all the spiritual needs I need.
[35:31] Amen. To be the richest man in the
[35:33] world.
[35:35] But our complaints are always natural.
[35:40] Y'all hear what I'm saying? Is if it
[35:42] ain't bills, it's this, it's that, you
[35:44] know, it's just all these natural
[35:46] things. And God trying to take us to a
[35:48] heavenly home, all this stuff is going
[35:50] to be done away with. And we're
[35:52] complaining.
[36:01] Listen, it just seems like that man
[36:04] can't learn only through the hard way.
[36:08] We find that even in our children, we
[36:10] have to punish them many times severely
[36:12] to make them understand. It just seems
[36:15] like a man is just himself a total
[36:18] failure to begin with. When he's lost
[36:20] his relationship with God, he become a
[36:23] unit of his own. He didn't depend on God
[36:25] no more. And when God had taught him the
[36:28] lessons of what it was to try to do
[36:31] something within himself, that his work
[36:33] will always come to
[36:37] knock. Every time you try to do it,
[36:40] every time you try to help him out like
[36:42] that, he said it's going to come to not.
[36:44] He said immediately we find them again,
[36:47] right down to achieve again. And the
[36:49] Bible said that they they built them a
[36:51] tower and they were going to climb up in
[36:53] this heaven to get up into the heaven
[36:55] without coming. The way of God had
[36:57] planned for them to come. And let me say
[37:00] it like this. That's exactly what a lot
[37:02] of these message people have done. Amen.
[37:05] They think they're going to get to
[37:06] heaven on their own way. You got to be
[37:09] born again. You got to have the Holy
[37:12] Ghost. Ain't nos, ifs about it. Amen.
[37:15] That's right. The bride knows that. Yes,
[37:18] sir. Amen. She knows that. And listen,
[37:22] there are people who've got the Holy
[37:24] Ghost and don't know it, Lord.
[37:27] Stir up the Kool-Aid. Get the sugar from
[37:30] off the bottom.
[37:34] Right. We've allowed Satan to oppress
[37:36] us. We've allowed Satan, Amen, to make
[37:38] us feel. And that's his job. Because if
[37:41] he can make you hold a bottle of Y'all
[37:43] know how it is. You Where's the water? I
[37:45] I I put my water somewhere. Brother
[37:48] Brooks, it's in your hand. Amen.
[37:51] How many times we've done that? I can't
[37:53] find my keys nowhere. Anybody seen my
[37:56] key?
[37:59] And we find out it's right in your hand.
[38:03] So is it with the Holy Ghost? We don't
[38:06] feel him all the time. So you feel like
[38:08] you don't have him. What feelings got to
[38:10] do with it? Amen.
[38:13] You couldn't change yourself if you
[38:15] wanted to. The Bible said no man can add
[38:17] a cubid to his statue. So who got you
[38:20] where you are? Hallelujah.
[38:23] Just like the other day the Lord, the
[38:24] devil, God woke me up and you know it's
[38:27] around 2:00 in the morning and this
[38:28] whole flesh didn't want to get up and he
[38:30] done talked to me two times twice
[38:32] already. Then the third time he said you
[38:34] know the devil ain't going to ask you
[38:35] get up and
[38:37] pray. I said yes
[38:39] Lord. Come on. The devil ain't going to
[38:42] ask me to get up and pray. Oh man, that
[38:44] was one of the best prayers I've had in
[38:45] a long time. Hallelujah. See, God talks
[38:49] to us. Amen. Yes, he does. But we in our
[38:52] lazy ways, right?
[38:55] Right. And the Bible said that they
[38:56] built them towels and they were going up
[38:58] to climb up to heaven to get into heaven
[39:00] without coming the way God had planned
[39:02] for them to come. And man can achieve
[39:05] better when he when they're united
[39:08] together. That's man. Look how they
[39:11] destroying our country. United. Now you
[39:14] take one man by himself. His power is
[39:17] limited to one man. See, ain't no one
[39:19] man behind
[39:21] this. It's proven itself
[39:25] today. Come on, somebody. Two men makes
[39:28] him twice his strength. Four men makes
[39:30] him four times his strength. And God
[39:32] wants us to be one. God made man that we
[39:35] should be one. And our motives should be
[39:38] one. and our objective should be won and
[39:40] our achievements should be won. He just
[39:43] designed that way. And we find out that
[39:45] immediately after the Angelian
[39:46] instruction that man began to try to
[39:49] take over again himself and all the time
[39:52] these things are going on, the spirit of
[39:54] the living God is striving with flesh.
[39:56] That was my first time ever really
[39:58] understanding what brother what God was
[40:00] saying. Striving. Get yourself out the
[40:03] way so I can do it. Amen. Amen. Your
[40:07] perfection does not come by human
[40:09] effort. It comes by the Holy Ghost. God
[40:12] building the man.
[40:17] Hallelujah.
[40:23] When that man Amen. I'm trying to think
[40:25] of his name. He slipped my mind just
[40:26] that quick. When he built Moses, Moses
[40:28] had nothing to do with. He was just a
[40:30] rock. It was a man who was doing all the
[40:32] carving.
[40:34] What was his name? Michelangelo. Yes. He
[40:38] was doing all the caring. Moses was just
[40:40] sitting. Come on. Moses went in the
[40:42] rock. Moses couldn't even get out the
[40:44] rock without
[40:47] Michelangelo. Come on, somebody. And you
[40:50] can't get out of this. You can't be
[40:51] perfected without Michelangelo. Without
[40:54] God himself chipping away at your life.
[40:59] Little by little. He didn't do a rust
[41:00] job.
[41:02] God chips a little bit. And sometime
[41:04] when that chip, that little bit chip is
[41:06] gone, you can't even see
[41:08] it. But he's looking at it, right? Come
[41:12] on, somebody. I've tried to sculpt when
[41:14] I was young and I was supposed to do the
[41:15] head of a man. It looked like the head
[41:17] of a
[41:18] monkey. Because Amen. I couldn't get
[41:20] what I was seeing. Amen. To, you know,
[41:23] it the picture could. I couldn't do it.
[41:25] But you got people who can really see
[41:28] and they can shape that thing chip just
[41:30] enough because they don't want to chip
[41:32] too much at one time. They might mess up
[41:35] the whole thing. That's what God is
[41:38] doing. Be like, "Hurry up, Lord. Don't
[41:41] you understand? You ain't going to miss
[41:42] the
[41:44] bus. When God get ready to leave, he'll
[41:47] have you done." Amen. Don't you worry
[41:50] about it. It's all in his control. I
[41:52] believe that with Hallelujah. with all
[41:55] my heart, mind, and soul.
[41:58] Don't fear. Amen. Don't take your let
[42:01] your mind says, "Oh, God, I'm not ready.
[42:03] I'm not going to be ready." How do you
[42:05] know that? Amen. God knows the perfect
[42:08] timing. God knows what he's doing.
[42:11] Hallelujah. He said, "Don't get anxious
[42:13] for nothing. When you get anxious, you
[42:16] get in God's way.
[42:20] Help us, Lord.
[42:25] Ei, the spirit of the living God is
[42:27] striving with flesh, trying to get man
[42:28] away from his own achievement, trying to
[42:31] get man away from his own selfish
[42:33] motives and objective to a plan which
[42:35] God has laid down. And as long as man
[42:38] works in his own plan, he will be a
[42:40] failure. Come on, it's the truth. When I
[42:43] first heard the statue of a perfect man
[42:45] and thinking man filter, I could never
[42:47] get through that
[42:49] filter. Every time it looked like I was
[42:52] getting ready to escape, brother Brown
[42:53] come up with something else, I'm like,
[42:54] "Oh, God, help us, Jesus." And I used to
[42:56] like, "Lord, how I'm going to get
[42:57] through this filter." What what what I
[42:59] didn't understand that there's a man
[43:01] who's already gone through the filter.
[43:03] Amen. Hallelujah. I'm going to show you
[43:06] something. What God showed me. What if
[43:08] this is the lamb? Let's suppose that
[43:09] this is the lamb of God. And this lamb
[43:13] has to die for you. This this lamb,
[43:16] right? You done wrong. You guilty.
[43:19] handcuffed by sin,
[43:22] right? Chained. Amen. By circumstances,
[43:26] you're there. But you said, Lord, but
[43:28] there's a lamb. I I chose to to be your
[43:33] substitute. You You're
[43:36] guilty. You're guilty as charged. You
[43:39] you you all you you're worthy of every
[43:41] disease ever hit the
[43:44] earth. You You're worthy of death. You
[43:46] You're worthy of hell. You're worthy of
[43:48] everything. But there is a lamb. There's
[43:51] a there's there's a someone here that's
[43:54] going to take your place. Oh,
[43:56] hallelujah.
[43:59] And when this one take your place, you
[44:01] can go free. Amen.
[44:04] You think I'm going to jump up and say,
[44:06] "Hold up, sir. I think I can kind of
[44:08] help work it out." No, sir. Put me on a
[44:10] working plan.
[44:12] I don't think so. Amen. So if this lamb
[44:16] is crucified and killed for me, and he
[44:19] dies the penalty of death, hell, and the
[44:22] grave, then what
[44:25] happens? I'm free. I'm just as guilty,
[44:29] but I'm free. Amen. Y'all hear what I'm
[44:32] saying? This is what Calvary is all
[44:34] about. This is redemption. You're
[44:36] guilty. I'm guilty. Amen. And the thing
[44:39] is, God, I can't never free myself cuz
[44:42] I'm guilty. Amen. Thank you. I've been
[44:45] caught in the act.
[44:49] But now because the token life, this has
[44:51] been paid. My penalty has been paid.
[44:53] Polar fella dead for
[44:56] me. Shouldn't I love
[44:59] it? Shouldn't I love this lamb? Should
[45:03] not say, "Oh, if it wasn't for you, I
[45:04] would I would be dead right now. I could
[45:07] have all kinds of affliction if if it
[45:09] wasn't for you, little lamb. even though
[45:10] you're dead. But one thing I love about
[45:12] this lamb that was able to rise again.
[45:15] Hallelujah. Amen. So we don't have to
[45:17] hug up on a dead lamb. We're hugging up
[45:20] on a real one.
[45:22] He's alive and well.
[45:25] That's why if you take let God take you
[45:27] to Calvary, you'll love the lamb. When
[45:30] you realize what this lamb did for you
[45:38] good. The devil say you're going to
[45:39] hell. How could I go to hell? And why
[45:41] should I even be afraid to go to hell?
[45:43] Amen. He went to hell for me. Amen. Hey,
[45:47] ain't no second trip. Ain't no two
[45:49] trips, brother. One trip. Yes, sir.
[45:53] He went to hell for me. I'm scared I'm
[45:55] going to miss the rapture. Scared or
[45:57] what? If the Holy Ghost is in you,
[45:59] there's no way you can miss it.
[46:02] The Bible said, "If that same spirit be
[46:03] in you that was also in Christ Jesus as
[46:06] it quickened his body, it'll sure
[46:08] quicken yours."
[46:11] Come on, somebody.
[46:14] Let me ask you one question. How many
[46:17] times you felt the life in
[46:19] you? Never. You just know you're living.
[46:26] Hello. So how how many times you how how
[46:29] come you feel like you got to feel it in
[46:31] you this Holy Ghost? How you know it's
[46:34] in you? Because you're living. Amen.
[46:38] It ain't feelings. Yeah, because I got
[46:41] life. I can clap my hands. I can stomp.
[46:42] I can jump. Whatever. But listen, it's
[46:45] because the life is in there. I don't
[46:47] feel nothing running through my veins.
[46:50] Hallelujah. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[46:52] I know it's there. Cuz if it wasn't
[46:54] there, I wouldn't be standing here
[46:56] before you. So is with the Holy Ghost.
[46:58] How you know, Brother Brooks, my life
[47:00] has been changed. Amen. Amen. My desires
[47:04] have been changed. Amen.
[47:09] Amen. Glory. Yeah. Amen. That's right.
[47:14] That's the glory of God. Don't you know
[47:16] the glory of God would, you know, never
[47:18] meant to stay on the c on a cart.
[47:21] Hallelujah. You know the B the Bible
[47:23] says, you know, my body yet thou has
[47:24] prepared for me. Hallelujah. But God's
[47:26] all his intent has always been to to
[47:29] hide behind your badge of skin.
[47:32] You know why he preached that? He got a
[47:34] badge of skin cuz that fell bad.
[47:36] [Laughter]
[47:38] You hear what they said? Don't just be
[47:39] badgering me. That ain't a good That
[47:41] ain't a good expression, right? Amen.
[47:43] That badge is a bad critter. Amen. And
[47:45] so here here God said this flesh of
[47:47] yours is a bad critter, but that's where
[47:50] I abide.
[47:57] I hope that's okay. Amen. Amen. Amen. I
[48:00] want you to understand this glory and I
[48:02] hadn't even gotten to where I want to
[48:03] be. Help me, Lord
[48:06] Jesus. Look what he says in the message
[48:09] of perfection. He said he came himself
[48:11] to offer his own blood, for it did not
[48:13] come through sex. Sex had nothing to do
[48:16] with it, but he overshadowed a virgin
[48:18] and brought forth from a blood cell that
[48:20] he created himself the innocent one.
[48:23] Then my salvation, yours tonight, does
[48:25] not hinge upon the merits of your own
[48:28] act, our own acts. It hinge upon the
[48:31] positive, sovereign grace of the
[48:33] almighty God who has chosen us in him.
[48:38] Certainly, I could never be perfect, nor
[48:40] could you never be perfect. And we don't
[48:43] claim to be perfect, but we have the
[48:45] this one consolation that our faith
[48:48] rests in a perfect sacrifice that
[48:51] already been received.
[48:54] Then how do we know that we get there?
[48:56] When the worshipper puts his hand by
[48:58] faith upon the body of the Lord Jesus,
[49:01] the fields of the tears of sin, the mark
[49:04] of spit in his own face, feel the
[49:06] groanings of the cal Gethsemane, the
[49:09] agony of Calvary, and knows that he's
[49:11] guilty and confess his sins correctly.
[49:14] And bless the Lord, I am guilty and I
[49:16] have no other way but you to help me.
[49:19] And by faith, your bidding, the Holy
[49:21] Spirit has come and bid me come. And I
[49:24] now by faith accept Jesus as my personal
[49:27] savior. Amen. Amen. Simple.
[49:33] That light that comes from him on
[49:34] Calvary called the Holy Ghost which was
[49:36] hid in the blood shell of the Lord Jesus
[49:39] returns to the worshipper and baptizes
[49:42] him with the Holy Ghost into the body of
[49:44] Christ. And he's already judged. Amen.
[49:47] You don't have to worry about judgment.
[49:49] as I turn and look.
[49:52] Don't don't run. Nobody don't run.
[49:54] Right? He says, "Listen, you don't have
[49:57] to worry about judgment."
[50:01] Right?
[50:03] As I turn and look at the little
[50:05] crucifix, I realize that his presence,
[50:08] his body, and now the body has already
[50:11] been judged. Amen. Hallelujah. All them
[50:14] licks in his body, that was your body.
[50:17] Now he's now took his perfect body and
[50:20] he's living in your nasty body. Amen.
[50:22] Because of the sacrifice. Amen.
[50:26] Hallelujah. Ain't nothing good about
[50:28] this flesh. Don't even think that flesh
[50:30] ain't going to Listen, I'm going to tell
[50:32] you something. Every time it get a
[50:33] chance to betray you, it will. You
[50:36] better not put trust in your flesh.
[50:38] Think you got so much Holy Ghost you can
[50:40] put trust in him, he'll betray you.
[50:47] Amen. Like the old school say, "Can I
[50:50] get a witness?"
[50:53] And now that body has already been
[50:55] judged and you can't you can't judge
[50:57] justly judge it again for judged. So God
[51:01] can't judge it again.
[51:03] Somebody Oh my God. I tell you what,
[51:05] right now I got to preach, but I really
[51:07] see myself jumping. Amen.
[51:13] God struck the judgments of death upon
[51:15] the body. And as long as I can find a
[51:18] way to get hid in that body, as long as
[51:20] I can find a way
[51:23] to get hid in that body, his judgment
[51:25] was struck for me and for you. We are
[51:28] free. Romans 8:1 says, "There is now no
[51:31] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[51:34] Jesus that walk not after the flesh, but
[51:36] after the spirit." There you are. No
[51:39] condemnation. I don't care what comes on
[51:42] comes or what goes. You are hid beneath
[51:44] the blood. And again, how do we get into
[51:47] that body? Hallelujah. He said by one
[51:49] spirit. See, that's why the devil don't
[51:51] want us to get into that. You know what
[51:53] I mean? He don't want us to get in
[51:54] there. Amen. And the and you know, it
[51:57] ain't so difficult. It's just what
[51:58] people, you know, faith faith. You know,
[52:02] I heard him say, "Amen. Lord, I'm the
[52:05] covenant people. I I I'm I'm I'm
[52:07] Abraham's seed. I come to get it." Amen.
[52:10] And you stay there till you get it.
[52:13] Oh, you got do what? What? How you going
[52:15] to know? Oh, your goosebumps and all.
[52:16] No, no, you'll know. You'll know. Oh, I
[52:20] speak in tongues. You might speak. You
[52:22] might do a lot of things, but that that
[52:24] doesn't declare it's there until you can
[52:26] get up knowing you changed. Amen.
[52:29] You even love the roach on the floor.
[52:32] That's when you know you got something.
[52:37] Mhm.
[52:39] Yeah, like I said, you know, one time
[52:41] for a long time, I thought I had to add
[52:43] to it. And I mean, I was getting
[52:44] frustrated. You know how it is. You
[52:46] think you got patience and you trying to
[52:49] add it, then somebody get on your
[52:52] nerve. Hallelujah. And all of a sudden,
[52:55] you done popped the chain, all your
[52:57] beads scattered out on the floor, and
[52:59] you're down there trying to pick them up
[53:01] to try to attach it all together again.
[53:03] But when God gives it to
[53:05] you, when God gives it to you, you are
[53:08] you feel like a dead man. Somebody's
[53:10] screaming at you and you looking at him
[53:11] like, "I'm so sorry, but I can't respond
[53:13] to
[53:16] that." Today, coming to church, I There
[53:20] was a man, Amen. Uh I was coming off on
[53:22] on um Merlh Road. There was a man in my
[53:25] blind spot. I didn't see him. I had the
[53:27] radio on, you know, lightly, you know,
[53:29] making noise. And you know, I'm thinking
[53:31] about some things that you know, and and
[53:32] and I heard this horn and I'm thinking,
[53:35] what's going on on the
[53:38] radio? I didn't even all of a sudden I
[53:41] look in the guys in the middle
[53:44] like and I couldn't get upset and I'm
[53:47] just saying, "Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
[53:49] Right? But you know what? God made it
[53:51] possible for that man to catch up with
[53:52] me way down the road on on Merl Hero. I
[53:55] rolled my window down and I said, "Sir,
[53:56] I'm so so sorry." I said, "I didn't see
[53:59] you." He he pointed at his rearview
[54:01] mirror. I said, "Sir, you must have been
[54:02] in my blind spot." I said, "I heard the
[54:04] horn." I said, "But I thought it was the
[54:07] radio." He said, "No, it was the horn."
[54:09] He said, "I guess we do those things
[54:11] sometimes." See, he left out with peace
[54:13] cuz I thought enough to I could have
[54:16] just ignored him. But the Holy Spirit
[54:18] had me roll the window down and
[54:20] apologize to that man cuz I was in the
[54:23] wrong. Hello, somebody. It's nothing
[54:26] wrong with saying I'm sorry. It's
[54:28] nothing wrong with being apologetic.
[54:30] When you're wrong, you're wrong. I
[54:32] believe somehow, Brother Rich, I I
[54:34] believe I passed the test.
[54:37] [Applause]
[54:39] I believe God did something for me,
[54:42] right? And that's what the devil does.
[54:44] He keeps gets us. I don't even know what
[54:46] time it is, but let me
[54:47] hurry. See, every seed of God will
[54:51] produce everything he says. Right?
[54:54] That's the word of the prophet. He said,
[54:56] "Every seed, every age produced what
[54:59] they were supposed to produce." Right?
[55:02] Hallelujah. And you even look at the
[55:05] shock age and you say, "Well, that was
[55:06] Pentecost." But I want you to know
[55:08] Seymour didn't sit at home and said,
[55:09] "I'm waiting for this thing to come."
[55:12] There was an anointing on Seymour and
[55:15] all the others of that age, whether it
[55:17] was here, there, it was something that
[55:20] anointed them that made them thirst and
[55:22] hunger for the living God. Amen. And
[55:25] they did get their portion. It was only
[55:27] those who came after them that pretended
[55:29] and didn't get it. But they got theirs.
[55:32] Amen. How come? You look at Luther, just
[55:35] a just a Catholic priest. And God made
[55:39] Luther thirst for him. Yes, sir. Amen.
[55:43] Luther didn't thirst for God. Oh, I I
[55:44] need more God. Luther would have
[55:46] remained a priest had not God knocked on
[55:48] his door. You would have remained a
[55:50] sinner. You would have remained out
[55:51] there or in some denomination or some
[55:54] organization had not God come by your
[55:56] house. You did not seek him. He sought
[55:59] you. Amen. Thank you, Lord. And because
[56:02] you could hear this message, you ought
[56:04] to be so excited. Amen. Because Jesus
[56:07] said, "My sheep hearth my voice and a
[56:10] stranger they will not follow." Amen.
[56:14] Thank you, Lord. When everybody else is
[56:16] saying that Prophet William Brandon is
[56:18] of the devil and this and that and the
[56:19] other and it wasn't right and he lied
[56:20] and this and that the other, there's
[56:21] something on the inside, brother Keith,
[56:23] that anchors the soul. Hallelujah. Why?
[56:27] Because you're not holding on to it.
[56:30] It's holding on to you. Amen.
[56:33] You can't even get away from it if you
[56:35] wanted to. Thank you, Lord. Huh? Because
[56:39] what we are expressing or feeling right
[56:41] now is the expression of God's thoughts
[56:44] about us being manifested right now in
[56:48] our day. You don't have to worry about
[56:50] the shakina glory. The shakina glory
[56:53] will come to you. Amen. What?
[56:57] Absolutely. Abraham wasn't looking for
[56:59] him. He came to Abraham. Amen. And God
[57:02] always come to Abraham's seed. Amen.
[57:07] Hallelujah. Like the prophet of God
[57:09] said, Abraham was among the idolattors
[57:11] and everything else, it was God. And how
[57:13] did Abraham out of all them gods down
[57:15] there in Chald and Babylon? How did he
[57:18] know that was a voice of God? Come on,
[57:20] somebody. He couldn't even see him,
[57:22] didn't even have a name. Hallelujah. But
[57:25] there was something on the inside that
[57:27] that made that voice familiar.
[57:30] Come on, somebody. It's like when you
[57:32] first heard those tapes. Hallelujah.
[57:35] Amen. You didn't hear a man's voice. It
[57:38] was a voice in a voice.
[57:42] That's
[57:43] right. Something that made you know
[57:46] that's right. I can't explain
[57:49] it, but I know it's
[57:52] right. Oh, that's your kind of glory
[57:54] coming. It's already here. Amen. Come
[57:56] on, somebody. It's going to be on the
[57:58] increase. Come on, somebody. Why?
[58:00] Because we're moving from glory to
[58:01] glory. How do you You know, I like that
[58:04] word. I like that word glory.
[58:07] It's something about it when you say
[58:09] glory. You know, you don't hear that too
[58:12] often no more, but there's a time when
[58:14] people used to get happy. You didn't
[58:15] have to worry about Jesus whether he was
[58:17] in the building or not cuz they scream
[58:19] out glory. Then the other one says
[58:21] glory. Then it be like glory. All of a
[58:24] sudden they out in the middle of the
[58:26] floor.
[58:29] See, but they murmured. Israel murmured.
[58:31] They saw the glory of God. But let me
[58:33] tell you something. And that fire looks
[58:34] like look like it's consuming you did
[58:36] you looking in the wrong through the
[58:38] wrong eyes. Cuz the same fire they saw
[58:41] as a consuming fire, Moses bowed and
[58:43] said it was
[58:45] God. Hallelujah. God's fire don't come
[58:48] to consume us. It come to consume sin.
[58:52] It come to burn out all the demons.
[58:54] Hallelujah. Amen. We're not afraid of
[58:56] the fire. God, let the pillar of fire
[58:58] come in here. Hallelujah. I've seen it
[59:01] before people. I know it exists.
[59:03] Hallelujah. See, that's what I'm saying.
[59:05] That's why they can't tell me nothing.
[59:07] Benny Hinn didn't have it. He ain't got
[59:09] no pillar of fire. Come on, somebody.
[59:11] Amen. Or Roberts didn't have it. Billy
[59:14] Graham didn't have it. Hallelujah. But
[59:16] our messenger of the hour had the pillar
[59:18] of fire. Amen. And the pillar of fire
[59:21] didn't disappear when he disappeared.
[59:23] Hallelujah. Why? Because we are the
[59:26] number one.
[59:28] Can I say it? Choice of the age.
[59:31] Hallelujah. God said, "I save the last
[59:34] for the best for last."
[59:38] We are the covenant people. We are the
[59:39] one that goes into the shakina glory.
[59:41] Why? Because that's where we came from.
[59:44] Amen. You say, "Well, brothers, I don't
[59:45] believe that." Aaron, that same rod that
[59:48] Moses had was passed on to Aaron. Amen.
[59:52] That's right. Come on, somebody. That
[59:54] same rod, we didn't know whether was
[59:57] male or female.
[1:00:00] But a female, a male can't bring forth
[1:00:03] armors.
[1:00:06] Come on, somebody. And he put that rod
[1:00:09] behind the veil.
[1:00:11] You know why? Because that's where it
[1:00:13] came from. Amen. God saw you and I as a
[1:00:16] dead tree lamb. Hallelujah. But you were
[1:00:19] you were God's God's God's gods. And
[1:00:22] when he put you behind the veil where
[1:00:24] you came from,
[1:00:27] hallelujah, not only did you b and
[1:00:29] blossom, but you brought forth others,
[1:00:37] Miss Jesus Christ, that's where you come
[1:00:40] from. You whip the devil under the law
[1:00:42] and you'll whip him under grace.
[1:00:48] Is that right? The prophet of God said
[1:00:50] you are not like Mary a part of the
[1:00:53] word. He said you are the word.
[1:00:57] You are the word. Go figure that one
[1:01:00] out.
[1:01:05] Hallelujah. That's why we got to go back
[1:01:07] to the glory of God. That's why the
[1:01:09] devil got all these old educated
[1:01:11] teachers. Amen. To make us think, Amen.
[1:01:13] By the grace of God, the days of
[1:01:15] miracles are passed. And you know, you
[1:01:17] know, I had a man tell me said, "Bear
[1:01:19] years ago when I lived in South Carolina
[1:01:20] said, "Man, you man, you you know the
[1:01:22] you know the pillar of fire disappeared
[1:01:24] when Joshua I said, "Let me tell you
[1:01:27] something. You too late to tell me about
[1:01:29] the pillar of fire. I done seen it with
[1:01:31] my own eyes." I said, "And 300 300 other
[1:01:33] people have seen it with their own
[1:01:35] eyes." I said, "It's too late to tell me
[1:01:36] we're not supposed to see it."
[1:01:39] Amen. Seen it since then. Hallelujah.
[1:01:42] Come on, somebody. Amen. I remember the
[1:01:44] time when I was in India. Amen. and the
[1:01:46] pillar cloud. Brother Tom Brown was be
[1:01:47] I'm preaching and and and and Bombay and
[1:01:50] that that pillar cloud coming there and
[1:01:52] them Hindus ran to the altar, got
[1:01:55] baptized and saved.
[1:01:57] I'm a witness what God will do for you.
[1:02:02] I'm a witness. Amen.
[1:02:07] That was the same year a lot of them was
[1:02:09] being killed. Missionaries were being
[1:02:10] killed at one time. Amen. The
[1:02:12] missionaries got killed in their car and
[1:02:13] burned up and stuff like that. And here
[1:02:15] I was in that over there at that time.
[1:02:17] And you know, I'm going to tell y'all,
[1:02:18] God is my witness. You know, I knew the
[1:02:20] presence of the Lord was with me, but I
[1:02:22] laid down in my bed and I looked up and
[1:02:24] all them lights were just flickering. I
[1:02:26] ain't talking about human lights. I'm
[1:02:27] talking about God lights.
[1:02:30] That's all I can tell you. All I'm just
[1:02:32] telling you. Amen. God will protect his
[1:02:34] own no matter where you go. Hallelujah.
[1:02:37] Hello.
[1:02:38] Amen.
[1:02:43] Somebody saying amen back there. That's
[1:02:46] Judah. Ain't God good to us? So what I'm
[1:02:50] trying to say, folks, you know, if you
[1:02:52] do away with the supernatural, you do
[1:02:54] away with your existence. You were born
[1:02:57] supernatural. Amen. You are
[1:02:59] supernatural. You're just a supernatural
[1:03:02] being stuck in this natural body. That's
[1:03:03] right. That's what it is. Hallelujah.
[1:03:06] and supernatural supposed to follow you
[1:03:08] wherever you go. That's right. I think I
[1:03:12] told you about the dog. Did I tell you
[1:03:13] about the dog when I was jogging?
[1:03:15] Okay, I'mma tell you
[1:03:18] again. But I was jogging the other day.
[1:03:20] It's the truth. I was jogging the other
[1:03:23] day. I had God on my mind. I was jogging
[1:03:24] and stuff like that. And just down the
[1:03:26] road, I said just a little further than
[1:03:28] that door to me, maybe from there to
[1:03:29] there. Here it was a dog had big dog had
[1:03:32] done broke from the broke from his chain
[1:03:33] and was circling this man and his
[1:03:35] daughter and and and the man had a
[1:03:37] little puppy and his daughter trying to
[1:03:38] hold them both and the dog just jumping
[1:03:40] up trying to snap him and stuff like
[1:03:41] that and the man's trying to get away
[1:03:43] and I started praying for him and for
[1:03:45] some reason the dog stopped with the man
[1:03:48] and he saw me and started coming across
[1:03:50] the street and there was a big bush
[1:03:52] right there and I thought well let me
[1:03:54] just get this tree bush piece for this
[1:03:57] tree just in case. I wasn't afraid, but
[1:03:59] I, you know, I I wanted some
[1:04:02] security. But while I grabbed the tree
[1:04:05] lamb, I said, "In the name of Jesus."
[1:04:07] Now, that's what's so funny because I
[1:04:09] didn't do that myself. God is my
[1:04:11] witness. That dog stopped like on a
[1:04:13] dime.
[1:04:15] Hallelujah. He looked like this like he
[1:04:18] was watching for the traffic or
[1:04:19] something. He and he went sniffing. God
[1:04:22] said, "Don't move." He went to sniffing
[1:04:24] like to see where I was and he couldn't
[1:04:26] find me. He turned back and I went on
[1:04:28] jogging. Hallelujah. Now, don't get me
[1:04:31] wrong. I tried that before and failed. I
[1:04:34] tried it.
[1:04:37] Amen. But God stopped that dog right
[1:04:40] there.
[1:04:43] And while I was going up the hill, the
[1:04:45] the Lord brought it back to my mind
[1:04:46] about the bull and the prophet. Let me
[1:04:49] tell you something. You can't
[1:04:50] manufacture this, folks. It's got to be
[1:04:52] God inspired. Amen.
[1:04:58] Hallelujah. Ain't God good? Now, I don't
[1:05:01] know about you, but the glory of the
[1:05:02] Lord came on the day of Pentecost. How
[1:05:04] many of y'all believe that? That same
[1:05:05] shakina glory came down with the licks
[1:05:08] of fire. Hallelujah. Have y'all ever
[1:05:10] seen it? The same time we saw the pillar
[1:05:13] of fire, we saw the licks of fire
[1:05:14] sitting in front of us just like that.
[1:05:17] Like a light, like one of those old
[1:05:18] light bulbs. You remember the inside and
[1:05:20] the flame go like that? That's the way
[1:05:21] it was. None of us could see a move. We
[1:05:24] were spellbound. We don't even know how
[1:05:26] long we sat there. Amen. But God, Amen.
[1:05:29] When we first came to this message, the
[1:05:30] word we every gift was pro uh was there
[1:05:33] and prophecy came and said, you know, uh
[1:05:35] I don't can't remember verbatim, but he
[1:05:37] said the reason remember the reason why
[1:05:40] uh I've I've manifested myself to use to
[1:05:43] to to say that you are my bride and this
[1:05:45] message is true. It can't nobody take
[1:05:48] it.
[1:05:53] I don't care if they could
[1:05:54] scientifically prove things wrong.
[1:05:58] It it wouldn't bother me anyway cuz they
[1:06:01] can't explain what's in there.
[1:06:05] Come on. They're so powerful. Yeah. But
[1:06:07] they can put me under I guarantee you
[1:06:09] they can put me under MRI and never see
[1:06:12] God. That's right. But he in there.
[1:06:17] [Laughter]
[1:06:19] Hallelujah. He's in there.
[1:06:25] Ain't God good? Amen. Now, I've got to
[1:06:28] I've got to hurry and I'm going to close
[1:06:30] on this cuz I I'll pick it up next time
[1:06:33] I minister. Uh brother uh Kyle is coming
[1:06:36] this Sunday.
[1:06:38] So, listen what it says in Habaca. For
[1:06:41] the earth shall be filled with the
[1:06:43] knowledge of the glory of the Lord as
[1:06:45] the water cover the
[1:06:49] sea. Is that all
[1:06:51] right? Amen. Uh so we understand by the
[1:06:55] grace of God Isaiah 40 and5 says the
[1:06:57] glory of the Lord shall be revealed and
[1:07:00] all flesh shall see it together for the
[1:07:02] mouth of the Lord has
[1:07:06] spoken. Amen.
[1:07:09] Hey
[1:07:11] The glory of the Lord shall be revealed.
[1:07:15] That means it was
[1:07:17] hidden. Hello, somebody do. Oh, I don't
[1:07:20] think I I tell you what, I'll finish
[1:07:21] this this message some other time. But
[1:07:23] let me say it like this by the grace of
[1:07:24] God. It's going to strike us one day
[1:07:27] soon. Amen. Soon. Because I'm going to
[1:07:30] tell you what, you have no idea the
[1:07:32] treasure that you you possess. This
[1:07:35] treasure you this treasure that you
[1:07:36] possess. Amen. is it's beyond no money
[1:07:39] can pay for this. You you know we're not
[1:07:42] oh my god the economy gonna drop and oh
[1:07:44] my god oh what is going to happen to us
[1:07:46] nonsense. I'm looking at it and I'm says
[1:07:48] countdown.
[1:07:51] I'm counting down brother because listen
[1:07:54] you know I don't think that you know
[1:07:56] when you prayed up you're not afraid of
[1:07:57] the fire.
[1:08:00] No no no no. They here it was they going
[1:08:02] to throw uh uh uh Daniel and the lions
[1:08:04] in or Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in
[1:08:06] the fire and they weren't afraid. You
[1:08:09] know, no, no, no. They they had already
[1:08:10] prayed up and you know, brother said
[1:08:12] they they had an all night prayer and
[1:08:13] God now never answered their prayer. He
[1:08:16] said God never answered them, but they
[1:08:18] said he we know he can deliver us and if
[1:08:21] he don't,
[1:08:23] hello. When this squeeze really come
[1:08:26] down, if he don't
[1:08:29] Amen. I'm not gonna bow. Amen. Y'all
[1:08:33] hear what I'm saying? Even if he don't,
[1:08:35] I'm still not gonna bow to this image. I
[1:08:37] know what the image is. Amen. How many
[1:08:40] out there know who the image is? What it
[1:08:42] is? See how blessed you are? Yes, sir.
[1:08:44] There's so many people think they got
[1:08:45] the Holy Ghost because they shouted,
[1:08:46] dance, and spoke in tongues. And you
[1:08:49] know the real true Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:08:51] What a treasure. Come on, somebody. You
[1:08:54] know that you can't even be predestined.
[1:08:56] you. The only way you can ever truly
[1:08:57] hear this message is that you're
[1:08:59] predestinated to hear it. Is that right?
[1:09:02] You are the sheep of God. Amen. And you
[1:09:04] have been ordained. See, God couldn't
[1:09:06] send a prophet, Amen, to preach a word
[1:09:08] unless there was somebody to receive it.
[1:09:10] Amen. So, your gift to receive it is
[1:09:13] just as powerful as his gift to bring
[1:09:15] it. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:18] It ain't like Jeremiah. He didn't say,
[1:09:20] "Well, listen, Jeremiah, I'm going to
[1:09:21] have you preach all this time and ain't
[1:09:22] no one nobody gonna get saved." No, he
[1:09:25] didn't even tell brother Brandham that.
[1:09:27] No sir. He goes and he takes him beyond
[1:09:29] the curtain of time and said, "Millions,
[1:09:31] millions, millions." Amen. And then he
[1:09:33] comes along said, "But in this last
[1:09:35] little day, this last little portion
[1:09:36] that we're going through," he said,
[1:09:38] "Only a few will make it."
[1:09:44] I'm so glad I'm one of them.
[1:09:48] Folks, we got to keep pulling. We got to
[1:09:51] keep pulling. and I experienced uh uh uh
[1:09:53] uh some wonderful time. Amen. And I'm
[1:09:56] going to tell you something in the Lord
[1:09:57] and and it's going to get greater. It's
[1:09:59] got to get greater. But it's you two.
[1:10:02] Come on, somebody. A love affair takes
[1:10:04] like they say, take two to tango. That
[1:10:06] sounds kind of con, you know, but I'm
[1:10:07] going to tell you something. When God
[1:10:08] come on the scene, he's expecting
[1:10:10] something. And when you come here, you
[1:10:12] come expecting. Amen.
[1:10:15] Hallelujah. Amen. You come expecting.
[1:10:18] Amen. And just as sure as you do. And
[1:10:19] that's why I can go other places, amen,
[1:10:21] and preach the same message somewhere
[1:10:23] else and get such a powerful response.
[1:10:26] It's not that the word is not good. It's
[1:10:28] not the word is not great, you know, but
[1:10:30] we don't come expecting like they do.
[1:10:35] God is so faithful to us, folks. I'm
[1:10:37] telling you, he is. Let's stand by the
[1:10:39] grace of God.
[1:10:55] Oh,
[1:10:57] I
[1:10:58] love
[1:11:01] him.
[1:11:03] How
[1:11:05] adore him.
[1:11:08] I breath my
[1:11:13] sunshine, my all in
[1:11:19] all the great
[1:11:25] creatator,
[1:11:27] became my
[1:11:29] [Laughter]
[1:11:31] savior and all God fullness.
[1:11:37] ness
[1:11:39] dwell in
[1:11:42] him once again. Oh,
[1:11:45] I
[1:11:47] love
[1:11:49] him. How I
[1:11:53] adore him.
[1:11:56] My breath, my
[1:12:01] sunshine,
[1:12:03] my
[1:12:07] in the great
[1:12:13] creatator, became my
[1:12:18] savior and all
[1:12:24] godfilledness dwell live in
[1:12:29] him once again. Oh,
[1:12:32] I
[1:12:34] love him.
[1:12:38] I
[1:12:39] adore
[1:12:42] him. My breath, my
[1:12:47] sunshine, my all in all.
[1:12:54] The great
[1:12:58] creator became my
[1:13:04] savior and all God's
[1:13:09] fullness
[1:13:11] dwell in
[1:13:14] him. In my closing, I'm going to read
[1:13:16] this quote coming from perfection.
[1:13:19] If there is anything that I can do to
[1:13:21] make myself perfect in the presence of
[1:13:24] God, then Christ did not have to die for
[1:13:27] me. If there's one thing that you can do
[1:13:30] that would merit anything in the
[1:13:32] presence of God, then Christ died in
[1:13:35] vain. No lawkeeper, no legalistic ideas
[1:13:39] of yours, none of your own holiness, no
[1:13:43] things that could quit, nothing that you
[1:13:46] could quit doing, quit lying, quit
[1:13:48] stealing, quit smoking tobacco, quit
[1:13:50] going to the picture show, still you are
[1:13:53] lost. Nothing can do it. Joining church
[1:13:56] rituals, ceremonies, baptisms, orders of
[1:13:59] the church, reading of creeds, saying of
[1:14:01] prayers, all those things would count
[1:14:04] nothing. You are lost. Not one thing you
[1:14:07] can do in yourself, for you are a sinner
[1:14:10] under condemnation. There's not no way
[1:14:13] within yourself or creed or anything
[1:14:15] that you could do or think of yourself
[1:14:18] that could merit one thing in the
[1:14:19] presence of God because you are a sinner
[1:14:22] to start with. And the Bible declares
[1:14:25] that we were all born in sin, shaped in
[1:14:27] iniquity, come to the world speaking
[1:14:29] lies. And God could not take one man to
[1:14:33] die for for the other because one is
[1:14:36] just as guilty as the other. In the
[1:14:39] presence of God, the archbishop born in
[1:14:41] the world was as guilty as the Lord's
[1:14:43] barfly in the city. One cannot atone for
[1:14:46] the other. Therefore, he took an
[1:14:48] innocent life of an animal, a little
[1:14:51] lamb. And under the Old Testament, the
[1:14:54] law was when a man said he brought the
[1:14:56] lamb to the altar. say if the
[1:14:59] transgression, any of the commandments,
[1:15:01] he brought the lamb and he laid it on
[1:15:03] the altar. He laid his hand upon the
[1:15:06] lamb and he confessed his sins that he
[1:15:09] was wrong. Know that he was guilty. The
[1:15:12] law required death and he brought the
[1:15:14] lamb in hisstead and the throat of the
[1:15:17] little animal was cut and it began to
[1:15:20] kick his little feet and bleeding. If
[1:15:23] you ever seen a lamb slaughter, what a
[1:15:25] pitiful cry the poor little fella tried
[1:15:28] to bleed and his little jurg vain cut.
[1:15:31] Amen. So, brother, he's going on to say,
[1:15:34] "Listen, ain't nothing you can do if we
[1:15:36] don't trust in God. If we don't trust in
[1:15:38] the lamb of God, and let me tell you
[1:15:40] something, you and I are so blessed
[1:15:42] because we're not under organization.
[1:15:44] We're not under denomination. We are
[1:15:46] under the bloody bleeding word of the
[1:15:48] son of man. We are under the true lamb
[1:15:51] of God." That's why you got to eat the
[1:15:53] flesh. You got to study. You got to
[1:15:55] read. Come on, somebody. You as a bride
[1:15:58] of Jesus Christ have been commanded to
[1:15:59] take the book, eat it. Eat it all up. Is
[1:16:03] that all right?
[1:16:06] Hallelujah. One more one more one more
[1:16:08] uh scripture and I'm going to read this
[1:16:10] and and let you go. Ain't God good to
[1:16:12] us? Amen. To know. Amen. Oh, I feel like
[1:16:15] shouting John right now. I feel it
[1:16:17] really good in my soul. 1 Corinthians
[1:16:20] 10:10 say they murmured neither murmur
[1:16:23] ye as some of them also murmured and
[1:16:26] were destroyed of the
[1:16:28] destroyer. So understand there is a
[1:16:31] destroyer out there ready for those who
[1:16:33] going to go murmur and complain. God
[1:16:35] will destroy you for that.
[1:16:38] That's the biggest thing they did.
[1:16:40] Murmur and complain.
[1:16:43] You know, when you murmur and complain,
[1:16:45] you just need to be delivered from a
[1:16:47] murmuring and complaining spirit. That
[1:16:49] spirit is there to make you uh uh get
[1:16:51] God in a position to destroy you.
[1:16:55] Because you murmuring and complaining,
[1:16:57] you don't like his leadership.
[1:17:00] Huh? He's leading and guiding you.
[1:17:03] Right? The Bible said, "In all things
[1:17:05] give thanks." Come on, somebody. You may
[1:17:07] not be able to understand it, but ask
[1:17:09] God to teach you to say, "Thank you,
[1:17:10] Lord.
[1:17:12] Amen. Amen. Come lead us in the song.
[1:17:14] Anybody have prayer requests or
[1:17:16] anything?
