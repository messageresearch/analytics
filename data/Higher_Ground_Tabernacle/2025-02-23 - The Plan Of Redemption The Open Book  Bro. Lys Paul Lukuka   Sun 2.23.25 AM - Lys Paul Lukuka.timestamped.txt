[54:21] morning
[54:26] is everyone good this
[54:28] morning amen praise the
[54:34] Lord so Romans chapter 8 um verse
[54:46] 19-22 the Bible says for the earnest
[54:49] expectation of the creature creature
[54:52] wait waiteth for the manifestation of
[54:54] the sons of God Amen
[55:01] for the cre the creature was made
[55:03] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[55:06] reason of him who has subjected the same
[55:08] in
[55:15] Hope because the creature itself also
[55:18] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[55:20] corruption unto the Glorious Liberty of
[55:22] the children of God
[55:31] for we know that the whole creation
[55:33] creation granth and travelleth in pain
[55:37] together until now
[55:44] amen no the the the whole creation is
[55:48] groaning and traveling in pain because
[55:51] they are waiting for the manifestation
[55:54] of the sons of God
[56:02] amen let's go to Revelation chapter 5
[56:05] it's going to be a
[56:06] lengthy
[56:18] scripture the Bible says and I saw in
[56:21] the right hand of him that sat on the
[56:22] throne a book written within and on the
[56:25] backside sealed with Seven
[56:35] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[56:38] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[56:40] worthy to open the book and to lose the
[56:42] seals
[56:48] thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in
[56:51] Earth neither under the Earth was able
[56:53] to open the book neither to look thereon
[57:01] not not even a prophet was worthy to
[57:03] open the
[57:05] book and verse four and I wept much
[57:08] because no man was found worthy to open
[57:11] and to read the book neither to look
[57:13] there
[57:19] on and one of the elders saith unto me
[57:22] weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[57:25] Judah the root of David ha prevailed to
[57:28] open the book and to lose the SE the
[57:31] Seven Seals
[57:40] thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst
[57:43] of the throne and of the four beasts and
[57:45] in the midst of the elders stood a lamb
[57:47] as he had been slain having seven horns
[57:51] and seven eyes which are the seven
[57:53] spirits of God sent forth into all the
[57:55] Earth
[58:08] and he came and took the book out of the
[58:10] right hand of him that set upon on the
[58:17] throne and when he had taken the book
[58:19] The Four beast and four and 20 Elders
[58:21] fell down before the lamb having every
[58:24] one of them Harps and golden vials full
[58:27] of ERS which are the prayers of the
[58:41] Saints and the song a new song saying
[58:44] thou are worthy to take the book and to
[58:46] open the seals thereof for thou was
[58:49] slain and has redeemed us to God by thy
[58:53] blood out of every Kindred and tongue
[58:55] and people and Nation
[59:09] amen you know when I was reading this
[59:11] verse I thought about um like I thought
[59:14] for some reason I thought about uh
[59:16] racism or slavery back in the
[59:21] days I was like how could they claim to
[59:23] be Christians knowing that God has
[59:25] redeemed us to God by the blood out of
[59:28] every
[59:33] KR people
[59:37] Nation so God redeemed us all it doesn't
[59:41] matter the
[59:45] call and has made us unto our God Kings
[59:49] and
[59:55] Priests a king is someone who
[59:58] Reigns he has made us King he has made
[1:00:00] us King and priest and we shall reign on
[1:00:02] the
[1:00:06] earth and I beheld and I heard the voice
[1:00:08] of many angels round about the throne
[1:00:10] and the Beast and the elders and the
[1:00:13] number of them was 10,000 times 10,000
[1:00:16] and thousands of thousands
[1:00:27] saying with a loud voice Worthy is the
[1:00:29] Lamb that was slain to receive power and
[1:00:32] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:00:34] and glory and
[1:00:43] blessing and I love this verse here
[1:00:47] where John is saying and every creature
[1:00:50] which is in
[1:00:54] heaven every creature which is in heaven
[1:00:57] and on the earth and under the Earth and
[1:01:00] such as are in the sea and all that are
[1:01:02] in them heard I
[1:01:09] [Music]
[1:01:12] saying so John must have been so loud
[1:01:16] that he's saying that every creature in
[1:01:18] heaven on Earth under everywhere they
[1:01:20] heard him saying
[1:01:30] so this thing about Redemption meant so
[1:01:32] much to
[1:01:37] John that he couldn't he couldn't sit
[1:01:39] quiet and just say thank you Lord
[1:01:45] Jesus there is something about when God
[1:01:47] reveals to you the the the mystery of
[1:01:50] redemption you you can't stay still
[1:01:57] he does something to
[1:02:00] you so he said uh where was I um yes
[1:02:04] heard that saying blessing and honor and
[1:02:07] glory and power be unto him that Seth
[1:02:09] upon the throne and unto the lamb
[1:02:11] forever and
[1:02:18] ever and the four be said amen and the
[1:02:21] four and 20 Elders fell down and worship
[1:02:23] him that leaveth forever and
[1:02:29] let's bow our head dear heavenly father
[1:02:32] Lord Jesus we thank you Father Lord for
[1:02:34] opening the word Lord
[1:02:37] Jesus Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[1:02:40] because Lord you pay the price and you
[1:02:42] was worthy to open the book
[1:02:47] lord lord this this means a lot to us
[1:02:50] father Lord that you did not just do it
[1:02:52] in vain there was a purpose for which
[1:02:53] you did it Lord Jesus
[1:02:58] and Heavenly Father Lord this said this
[1:03:00] meant so much to John father Lord that
[1:03:02] he said that when he screamed everywhere
[1:03:04] they heard him screaming Lord
[1:03:09] Jesus Lord heavenly father I pray that
[1:03:11] you open our eyes this morning Lord
[1:03:13] Jesus our hearts our
[1:03:16] ears that we may also be in the same
[1:03:19] spirits that John was in The Book of
[1:03:24] Revelation we want to be the same
[1:03:26] channel that John was when the word was
[1:03:28] revealed to
[1:03:33] Him Father this book that that that we
[1:03:36] just read about you are the author of
[1:03:37] the book lord
[1:03:41] Jesus and it will take the supernatural
[1:03:43] God to reveal this to us Lord
[1:03:47] Jesus Lord we call on you to come this
[1:03:51] morning I Surrender myself to you Lord
[1:03:54] Jesus I honestly don't even know how I'm
[1:03:56] going to bring this
[1:03:59] up but Lord I pray that you speak to
[1:04:02] your your children this
[1:04:04] morning Father Lord take control of the
[1:04:09] congregation Lord you know what they
[1:04:11] need father
[1:04:13] Lord Heavenly Father the Bible says that
[1:04:15] the word discerns the thoughts of the
[1:04:17] hearts of
[1:04:19] men Lord may you speak to them this
[1:04:23] morning and we bind every Spirit of
[1:04:25] unbelief Believe In The Name of Jesus
[1:04:28] Christ and we welcome you the king of
[1:04:31] kings in this building
[1:04:34] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[1:04:37] amen amen you may have your
[1:04:41] seats amen so this morning I'm going to
[1:04:44] talk about the Plan of
[1:04:47] Redemption and as a um subtitle I will
[1:04:50] use the title The open book
[1:04:55] [Music]
[1:04:57] amen amen so when we just read here in
[1:04:59] the Book of Revelation there was a scene
[1:05:01] happening in in
[1:05:06] [Music]
[1:05:08] heaven so when John in verse in in verse
[1:05:12] three it says and no man in Heaven Nor
[1:05:14] in Earth neither under the Earth was
[1:05:16] able to open the book neither to look
[1:05:23] there and verse four Bible says and I
[1:05:26] wept much because no man was found
[1:05:28] worthy to open the
[1:05:33] book The Prophet The Prophet explained
[1:05:36] that John wept because he saw that he
[1:05:38] was going to be the annihilation of the
[1:05:44] world John WEP because the the Earth was
[1:05:47] going to go back to its
[1:05:52] molecules everything was going to get
[1:05:54] destroyed
[1:05:57] there wouldn't be you this
[1:05:59] morning there wouldn't be a Sunday uh
[1:06:02] the
[1:06:03] 23rd because everything was going to go
[1:06:05] back to um
[1:06:09] nothing and we just read in Romans
[1:06:11] chapter
[1:06:13] 8 that the Bible is saying that even the
[1:06:15] Earth is groaning waiting for the
[1:06:17] manifestations of the sons of
[1:06:23] God so there's a certain
[1:06:26] that the sons of God have to bring that
[1:06:28] the earth is waiting
[1:06:34] for so that means that it's something
[1:06:36] that the Earth is
[1:06:39] missing it's something that creature is
[1:06:43] missing but how are they missing it
[1:06:45] because we had Adam had it in the Garden
[1:06:47] of
[1:06:50] Eden but then there the Earth is looking
[1:06:53] for it because the sons of God they lost
[1:06:55] their
[1:06:58] inheritance the prophet said they lost
[1:07:00] the title
[1:07:03] deed they lost the book in the Garden of
[1:07:06] Eden when Adam listened to
[1:07:12] Eve and Eve listened to the devil's
[1:07:17] life the definition of the word redeem
[1:07:20] means to buy back or to get or win back
[1:07:29] so it's to get back that which was
[1:07:33] lost you know get back to what get back
[1:07:36] to the position that we once
[1:07:41] had what was the position that was the
[1:07:44] that was in in Genesis chapter chapter
[1:07:49] 2 when man was ruler over the Earth
[1:07:57] and when when when Adam
[1:08:00] sinned he lost that that that that that
[1:08:02] title he lost that
[1:08:05] book and the Earth felt like it was
[1:08:08] missing it its owner like its
[1:08:13] creator because the prophet says that
[1:08:15] the Earth was given to man for men to
[1:08:18] for us it was for
[1:08:21] us that's why after when we come when we
[1:08:23] come back from heaven we return back to
[1:08:25] the Earth because the Earth
[1:08:29] us such a great
[1:08:32] inheritance but because of sin we lost
[1:08:36] it I'll read the prophet in the message
[1:08:39] the six
[1:08:40] seal
[1:08:42] 127 he says that's the reason John
[1:08:47] wept because if no one could get the
[1:08:50] book all creation everything was gone
[1:08:59] she would just simply turn back to atoms
[1:09:01] and molecules and so forth and Cosmic
[1:09:03] light and not even be creation person
[1:09:06] nothing
[1:09:10] else why he said because Adam lost the
[1:09:13] right of that
[1:09:17] book he forfeited it when he listened to
[1:09:20] his wife
[1:09:26] and she listened to Satan's reasoning
[1:09:28] instead of the word of
[1:09:33] God so because Adam did that he lost his
[1:09:38] inheritance and it's the same thing
[1:09:40] today every time you listen to the to
[1:09:42] Satan's reasoning you lose your
[1:09:48] inheritance inheritance means it's
[1:09:50] something that belongs to you who did
[1:09:51] you inherit that from from your father
[1:09:53] God himself
[1:09:58] God promis you Joy but when you listen
[1:10:00] to Satan's life then you lose that
[1:10:06] joy in Jeremiah 29 he says my plans for
[1:10:09] you is to prosper
[1:10:13] you God wants you to be
[1:10:16] prosperous in everything that you do in
[1:10:20] life in your workplace in your
[1:10:24] marriage family in your project in your
[1:10:28] church even in your
[1:10:32] city the city they're groaning they are
[1:10:35] looking for sons of
[1:10:38] God but you see you see that they're not
[1:10:41] just looking for Sons but to be they're
[1:10:43] looking for Sons to be
[1:10:49] manifested we want to see sons in
[1:10:52] actions
[1:10:55] because they are the sons of God are the
[1:10:57] boss of the
[1:11:03] Creator and I continue the same the same
[1:11:07] U quote then he couldn't go back so uh
[1:11:09] uh let me continue cuz Adam lost the
[1:11:12] rights of that book he forfeited it when
[1:11:13] he listened to his wife and she listened
[1:11:15] to Satan's reasoning inste of the word
[1:11:16] of
[1:11:20] God it was fored
[1:11:26] you know we had such a great inheritance
[1:11:29] we had the whole earth
[1:11:32] amen and now you have people that try to
[1:11:36] you know they sell their souls to Satan
[1:11:37] to try to get some inheritance from this
[1:11:44] Earth well things could could have just
[1:11:46] been as simple as just believe the word
[1:11:48] of God and you will keep your inherit
[1:11:55] the prophet says he couldn't go back
[1:11:57] into the dirty hands of
[1:12:01] Satan who tempted her out of the
[1:12:05] way so therefore he went back to its
[1:12:08] original
[1:12:12] owner like any abstract deed will
[1:12:17] do he goes right back to its original
[1:12:20] owner and that was God the Creator
[1:12:26] and he holds
[1:12:28] it so this
[1:12:30] book was a word giving authority to
[1:12:36] man and when man listen to Satan's life
[1:12:39] they lost that
[1:12:43] Authority and the prophet is saying that
[1:12:45] the book that same book we read we read
[1:12:46] in Revelation he went back
[1:12:52] to we see that in Revelation because the
[1:12:55] lamb went to take the book out of the
[1:12:57] him that sit on the
[1:13:03] throne so what did Adam
[1:13:07] lose why was he before because redeeming
[1:13:10] means we getting back to what we were
[1:13:16] before the prophet says believe on what
[1:13:18] the the word says about
[1:13:22] you that's how you overcome Satan by the
[1:13:26] word so what does the word says what
[1:13:29] were
[1:13:30] we because we are the seed of
[1:13:34] Adam and when Christ this Plan of
[1:13:36] Redemption was to get us back to the
[1:13:38] Garden of
[1:13:41] Eden let's go to Genesis 1 verse 28
[1:13:56] and the Bible says and God blessed them
[1:13:58] and God said unto them be fruitful and
[1:14:00] multiply
[1:14:04] amen and replenish the Earth and subdue
[1:14:09] it and he here it is and have dominion
[1:14:13] over the fish of the sea and over the
[1:14:15] foul of the air and over every living
[1:14:18] thing that moveth upon the Earth
[1:14:28] so God is positioning man he's there
[1:14:30] telling them this is what you ought to
[1:14:32] do you ought to have dominion over
[1:14:35] everything that liveth in this
[1:14:41] earth and and in in Genesis CH 2: 19 to
[1:14:45] 20 we can't even see that Adam even
[1:14:47] named the
[1:14:53] animals so we have to understand that
[1:14:55] hierarchy the hierarchy is not creation
[1:14:57] is not below you you are above
[1:15:04] creation you know things because of sin
[1:15:07] things have been perverted but we ought
[1:15:08] to get back to
[1:15:14] that was Adam Adam was the god of the
[1:15:18] earth Adam was was the god of circum of
[1:15:21] all the circumstances
[1:15:25] he was he was the prophet says he was an
[1:15:27] amateur
[1:15:29] God he was in control of everything that
[1:15:32] God would even back him up to name
[1:15:39] animals but the prophet said that when
[1:15:41] he lost the title did he also forfeited
[1:15:44] that inheritance to
[1:15:50] Satan so this inheritance this earth the
[1:15:52] earth belongs to us
[1:15:56] Earth belongs to
[1:15:58] you and we see everything that liveth up
[1:16:01] on the earth needs to be under your
[1:16:05] Dominion but because of see the prophet
[1:16:07] says he forfeited that inheritance to
[1:16:13] Satan that's why the Bible says that
[1:16:15] Satan is the god of the
[1:16:19] earth you once used to be the god of the
[1:16:21] Earth but because you disbelieve the
[1:16:23] word of God you lost your inheritance to
[1:16:31] Satan in scripture 2 Corinthians
[1:16:37] 4:4 the Bible says in whom the God of
[1:16:40] this world has blinded the minds of them
[1:16:43] which believe
[1:16:48] not the God of this
[1:16:52] world so something got Chang because the
[1:16:55] God of this world used to be
[1:17:02] Adam that's why in Matthew chapter 4 we
[1:17:05] see that Satan tried to offer to give
[1:17:07] Jesus all the kingdoms of the
[1:17:14] earth he tried to give it to Jesus but
[1:17:17] Jesus did not uh take it that
[1:17:22] way because he knew his time would come
[1:17:27] Jesus knew what the word said about him
[1:17:29] possessing back the
[1:17:32] [Applause]
[1:17:34] [Music]
[1:17:35] Earth you patience is
[1:17:38] important you know we are in this in
[1:17:41] this journey on Earth it's a
[1:17:43] race it's a
[1:17:45] journey but sometimes you need to be
[1:17:48] patient because the Bible says that all
[1:17:51] things will be made beautiful in in in
[1:17:53] your time
[1:17:56] there is a time and a season for
[1:18:00] everything we even see that even the the
[1:18:03] this book had had to be revealed in the
[1:18:05] last
[1:18:06] [Applause]
[1:18:09] age this book could not be revealed in
[1:18:11] the first age second third or
[1:18:17] fourth he had to
[1:18:20] wait the prophet says that the the the
[1:18:23] the first six um uh uh Messengers they
[1:18:26] were reformers they were not uh
[1:18:32] uhet and the prophet says that a
[1:18:35] reform he gave an example he says it's
[1:18:37] for instance like an
[1:18:41] electrician he said that if there's an
[1:18:44] electrical problem with something if
[1:18:45] you're not an electrician you might be
[1:18:47] able to patch it up just a little
[1:18:51] bit someone with a proper qualification
[1:18:54] to come and fix the thing as it needs to
[1:18:57] be
[1:19:02] fixed the prophet said that those
[1:19:04] Messengers they were just patching
[1:19:06] things up a little
[1:19:10] bit partial
[1:19:14] Revelation but they needed to wait till
[1:19:17] the master himself the
[1:19:21] M the mighty Angel would come down and
[1:19:24] reveal the book himself
[1:19:28] [Applause]
[1:19:29] to because no one was worthy to open the
[1:19:33] to take the
[1:19:36] book they were just reformers they were
[1:19:38] patching things
[1:19:40] up I read the prophet was talking about
[1:19:43] there were there were questions being
[1:19:45] asked what was the original
[1:19:49] scene the prophet said that they were
[1:19:51] asking what is the correct baptism what
[1:19:53] is the right way
[1:19:58] and I can share this quot with you I
[1:19:59] like what the prophet said he said he
[1:20:01] said that they just guessed at
[1:20:06] it oh this says here this says that
[1:20:08] maybe this is what it
[1:20:11] means but with this this seventh mention
[1:20:14] there's not a
[1:20:17] maybe it's that which is perfect when it
[1:20:22] comes when that thing comes there's not
[1:20:25] a maybe there's a
[1:20:29] certainty because when the seven when
[1:20:31] the seventh angel begins to sound all
[1:20:33] the mysteries of God will
[1:20:37] be the prophet says that all the
[1:20:39] Mysteries will be
[1:20:42] revealed and it will not be guessed
[1:20:46] it it will be the word itself reveal
[1:20:51] himself because the prophet says you
[1:20:53] cannot interpet the word of
[1:20:57] God the word of God interpret
[1:21:01] itself and then the the word comes to
[1:21:04] the
[1:21:06] prophet in order for the word to be
[1:21:08] fully revealed there had to be a
[1:21:12] prophet they not have to have reformers
[1:21:14] they had to be a
[1:21:18] prophet and the Bible tells us that the
[1:21:20] prophet will have the spirit of Elijah
[1:21:26] the prophet tells us what was the spirit
[1:21:27] of Elijah Elijah was a man of the
[1:21:29] Wilderness
[1:21:32] he he was in the
[1:21:34] wilderness he was always preaching
[1:21:36] against women
[1:21:39] women when you identify Elijah's
[1:21:44] Ministry tell me who else have you seen
[1:21:46] in the past few years is just like
[1:21:51] Elijah remember he won't be Elijah but
[1:21:54] the word says you have the spirit of
[1:21:56] Elijah
[1:21:58] in why was the spirit of Elijah the
[1:22:01] spirit of Elijah was
[1:22:03] Christ Elijah was just a temple where in
[1:22:06] where the word came and
[1:22:11] reveal God does not break his
[1:22:14] word the Bible says the word comes to
[1:22:17] the
[1:22:19] prophet so in this Plan of Redemption
[1:22:21] there had to be a prophet in whom the
[1:22:23] word had to come
[1:22:29] God the prophet says God is a god of
[1:22:33] order the right order is the word comes
[1:22:36] to the
[1:22:39] prophet am amen amen Lord and so in
[1:22:44] order to redeem that book that we just
[1:22:46] read in Revelation chapter
[1:22:49] 5 there was a price that had to be
[1:22:52] paid there was a price that had to be
[1:22:55] paid when when man
[1:22:58] sinned God looked and he was like that's
[1:23:01] my
[1:23:03] son as a father you want to do something
[1:23:06] for your son no matter if he does
[1:23:08] something but you want to be able to
[1:23:09] redeem your
[1:23:15] son if you were you Jud of the
[1:23:20] case for let's even use the president of
[1:23:23] the US
[1:23:25] he has power to Pardon uh uh certain
[1:23:29] trans
[1:23:32] trans a perfect example we saw Joe
[1:23:35] Biden before he left office he pardoned
[1:23:38] his own
[1:23:43] Sons people criticized him for
[1:23:46] that but why was it to me that was the
[1:23:48] type of God and and his his
[1:23:53] children that's what a perfect father
[1:23:55] will
[1:23:58] do you would pardon your own
[1:24:01] son but remember God does not go against
[1:24:04] his own
[1:24:06] word word said that the soul that sin
[1:24:09] shall
[1:24:12] die someone had to
[1:24:15] die and Angels couldn't
[1:24:19] die and the prophets they they they
[1:24:23] could die but they did not had sin in
[1:24:25] their life they were born in
[1:24:28] sin because we we read about that um
[1:24:32] about the sacrifice so
[1:24:34] in I think it's in
[1:24:37] Leviticus where it says that the lamb
[1:24:38] had to be without
[1:24:43] blemish let's let's find that here uh
[1:24:46] let's go to Leviticus chapter 22
[1:24:50] [Music]
[1:25:05] all right Leviticus chapter 22 let's
[1:25:07] start with the 17th verse and the Lord
[1:25:10] spake unto Moses
[1:25:12] saying Speak unto
[1:25:15] Aaron and to his sons and to all the
[1:25:18] children of
[1:25:19] Israel and say unto them whatsoever he
[1:25:22] be of the House of Israel
[1:25:26] let's skip to the 19th verse you shall
[1:25:28] offer at your own will a male without
[1:25:34] blemish of the beaves of the sheep or of
[1:25:37] the
[1:25:38] goat and whatsoever has a blemish that
[1:25:42] shall ye not offer for it shall not be
[1:25:47] acceptable so this
[1:25:49] sacrifice had should should not have any
[1:25:52] blemish on it
[1:25:56] that's why Moses couldn't do
[1:25:58] it because the Bible says we've all
[1:26:01] sinen and fell short of the glory of
[1:26:06] God so they were looking for a
[1:26:09] sacrifice the perfect
[1:26:13] [Music]
[1:26:14] sacrifice and we'll get back to the
[1:26:16] sacrifice but let's continue with the
[1:26:21] story so the question was
[1:26:25] so God had
[1:26:27] a uh God had a law of the kingsman
[1:26:31] Redeemer you know where the law let's
[1:26:35] let's go to it Leviticus chapter
[1:26:38] 25 verse 20 3 to
[1:26:44] 25 the Bible says the land shall not be
[1:26:47] sold
[1:26:51] forever for the land is mine
[1:26:55] for you are strangers and sojourners
[1:26:57] with
[1:27:00] me and in all the land of your
[1:27:03] possession you shall Grant a Redemption
[1:27:05] for the
[1:27:11] land If thy brother be walk and
[1:27:16] poor and had sold away some of his
[1:27:21] possession and if any of his
[1:27:24] come to redeem it then shall he redeem
[1:27:28] that which his brother
[1:27:35] sold so in another message the prophet
[1:27:37] explained this
[1:27:39] verse so God had given the children of
[1:27:42] Israel a
[1:27:45] land it was the promised land and he
[1:27:48] divided it through Judah so that each
[1:27:50] tribe would have a land
[1:27:54] [Music]
[1:27:57] yeah Joshua sorry so that each tribe
[1:27:59] would have a
[1:28:01] land and then their descendant would
[1:28:03] inherit that
[1:28:06] Land If a man was
[1:28:12] poor and he needed some money and he had
[1:28:14] to sell a part of his
[1:28:16] land so that means he L his inheritance
[1:28:19] to that land
[1:28:25] in order in order for him to get it back
[1:28:27] there had to be a kinsman redeemer that
[1:28:29] came and said I paid the price to get it
[1:28:36] back the prophet goes further and he
[1:28:38] explain that if I like for instance if I
[1:28:39] had a
[1:28:40] [Applause]
[1:28:41] [Music]
[1:28:44] property and then I lost to someone um
[1:28:47] who was not part of my
[1:28:50] tribe that person could come and do
[1:28:53] whatever he wanted with that
[1:28:57] land he he held the title to the
[1:29:02] land but if in the future for instance
[1:29:04] his son came and wanted to backy to buy
[1:29:07] back that
[1:29:11] property even if someone else owned that
[1:29:14] property but if his son the rightful
[1:29:16] owner of it came back and said I want to
[1:29:19] buy this that person was obligated to
[1:29:22] sell him the land
[1:29:35] like if I'm selling my land for
[1:29:38] 25,000 and someone else came and wanted
[1:29:41] to buy that land for
[1:29:45] 25,000 I could refuse the offer I didn't
[1:29:47] have to sell him that that
[1:29:51] land a king a king the kins man person
[1:29:55] came and wanted to buy that same for
[1:30:01] 25,000 I don't even need to negotiate I
[1:30:04] have to give him the land for
[1:30:10] 25,000 that was the law of the kingsman
[1:30:14] Redeemer so according to God's
[1:30:16] law price had to be paid in order to
[1:30:20] redeem us
[1:30:21] back and we just read that the price
[1:30:24] said to be a
[1:30:26] sacrifice a lamb without
[1:30:30] BL and no one else was
[1:30:34] worthy only so God when no one was
[1:30:37] worthy God looked and he was like I have
[1:30:40] I have to help my my my my um my my
[1:30:45] sons how could he do
[1:30:48] it God made himself
[1:30:51] flesh God became a man
[1:30:55] to become our
[1:30:57] brother to become one of
[1:31:01] us he made himself in the flesh because
[1:31:04] he loved us so
[1:31:08] much God could not afford just losing
[1:31:12] us I mean he is God he could have
[1:31:15] created other
[1:31:17] people but God chose to stick with his
[1:31:20] original creation
[1:31:24] why because the Bible in John 3:16 tells
[1:31:26] us that he so loved the
[1:31:32] world it was love that projected
[1:31:36] Christ love will do amazing things in
[1:31:39] your
[1:31:40] life love creates solution to
[1:31:44] problems even in your relationship in
[1:31:47] your house when there there are problems
[1:31:48] just bring love
[1:31:54] I remember one time the prophet was
[1:31:55] talking about this couple they were
[1:31:57] having
[1:32:00] issues they were having issues and and
[1:32:03] so the the husband apparently was way
[1:32:05] too
[1:32:09] spiritual that when the wife would do
[1:32:11] something you know against the word of
[1:32:15] God the husband would used Satan I talk
[1:32:18] to instead of talking to his wife he
[1:32:20] addressing her as Satan
[1:32:25] no misplacing the word of
[1:32:27] God and his wife wanted to divorce
[1:32:33] him his wife went to and he went to the
[1:32:35] prophet crying my pray for me my wife
[1:32:37] wants to divorce
[1:32:41] me the prophet did not pray about
[1:32:45] that the prophet said that I mean she's
[1:32:47] right for one to divorce you you called
[1:32:49] her sat to her face
[1:32:52] [Music]
[1:32:55] there's a certain way you talk to people
[1:32:57] when you have issues with them or when
[1:32:59] you disagree with
[1:33:02] them the prophet told him that I'm not
[1:33:04] going to pray but this is what I'll
[1:33:08] do and buy some
[1:33:11] flowers you know show her so much
[1:33:15] love and he did what the prophet told
[1:33:18] him to
[1:33:19] do and he came back telling the prophet
[1:33:21] yeah you were right my wife came back to
[1:33:23] me
[1:33:30] love will create solutions to your
[1:33:32] marital
[1:33:36] problems you know what love will do love
[1:33:38] will even make you pray for your
[1:33:42] partner because if you love your partner
[1:33:44] so much you don't want to lose that
[1:33:47] partner Christ loved us so Christ loved
[1:33:51] us so much that he did not want to lose
[1:33:53] us
[1:33:57] what did he do he created a
[1:34:01] solution you know even the prophet when
[1:34:04] the bull came to attack
[1:34:09] him he said what prevailed it was
[1:34:12] perfect love that
[1:34:17] prevailed I even say this many people
[1:34:21] are they find Christianity boring yeah
[1:34:26] because there's not love between between
[1:34:29] you and the creator of
[1:34:33] Christianity you just need to have more
[1:34:35] love to start enjoying
[1:34:41] God you need to have more love to enjoy
[1:34:44] Sunday
[1:34:49] service and when you don't have it just
[1:34:51] ask God
[1:34:54] so a perfect sacrifice had to be
[1:34:58] created you know and in Matthew chapter
[1:35:01] 1 ver 23 says Behold a virgin shall be
[1:35:05] with a
[1:35:07] child and he shall bring forth a son and
[1:35:10] they shall call his name Emmanuel which
[1:35:11] being interpreted is god with
[1:35:17] us so now God became one of us
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:26] but how did he do it he came in
[1:35:29] Simplicity the prophet preacher message
[1:35:31] God is revealed in
[1:35:35] Simplicity many times we miss God
[1:35:38] because we are looking for something big
[1:35:40] when it's just right next to you but
[1:35:42] it's too small like
[1:35:49] that you pray for bread and God gives
[1:35:52] you money but you're not realizing that
[1:35:54] that money is can has the power to buy
[1:36:02] bread whatever you pray for God that God
[1:36:05] doesn't have to give you the way you
[1:36:06] want to receive
[1:36:12] it but one thing for sure he always
[1:36:15] answers
[1:36:17] prayers like brother preach on Wednesday
[1:36:20] sometimes his answers are NOS
[1:36:27] and the prophet said that his knows is
[1:36:29] the best thing that I could ever
[1:36:37] accept so when you pray for something
[1:36:39] and you don't get it don't don't say
[1:36:41] that God is not answering to your
[1:36:47] pray as long as you check yourself with
[1:36:49] your word and you have nothing
[1:36:51] condemning you in your heart
[1:36:57] when you say that God is not answering
[1:36:59] your prayer you are making him a
[1:37:04] liar because he said ask and he shall be
[1:37:12] given so that was probably for someone
[1:37:15] here cuz that was not even in my note in
[1:37:17] first Timothy chter
[1:37:22] 3:16 the Bible says and without
[1:37:24] controversy great is the mystery of
[1:37:30] godliness God was manifest In the
[1:37:38] Flesh justified in the spirit seen of
[1:37:43] angels preached unto the Gentiles
[1:37:46] believed on into the world receive up
[1:37:48] into
[1:37:51] Glory so God became a
[1:37:55] man and on Calvary when he says it is
[1:37:58] finished he paid the
[1:38:02] price so what does that mean when he
[1:38:04] says he paid the
[1:38:08] price that mean that means he met the
[1:38:18] requirements but the prophet says that
[1:38:20] he had redeemed you but he had not yet
[1:38:22] claimed his rights
[1:38:28] you know it's pretty much when when you
[1:38:29] order something
[1:38:33] [Music]
[1:38:35] online you know you pay with your money
[1:38:38] but it takes a few days for you to
[1:38:40] receive your
[1:38:43] possession and you you you notice that
[1:38:46] you have the right when you don't
[1:38:48] receive your your your your possession
[1:38:49] you have the right to claim it I did not
[1:38:51] receive it
[1:38:57] return back my
[1:38:59] money but you know with God there's not
[1:39:01] a return back my
[1:39:04] money because the word the Bible says
[1:39:06] the word of God will not return
[1:39:09] back accomplishing that for which he was
[1:39:14] purpose always hit the
[1:39:18] target so Christ said pay the price but
[1:39:21] yet he had not claimed his
[1:39:26] right what was the
[1:39:29] right sons of God back in the rightful
[1:39:35] position why were the right rights to
[1:39:37] become Adam
[1:39:42] again right to speak things into
[1:39:46] existence right to become the god of
[1:39:49] your situation
[1:39:53] right not to be afraid when a situation
[1:39:55] comes your
[1:39:59] way but right for you to know that I am
[1:40:02] the god of this
[1:40:05] situation everything that that that
[1:40:08] moves up on the earth I have dominion
[1:40:10] over
[1:40:13] it so Jesus says that I need to to claim
[1:40:17] that
[1:40:21] back and those rights were found in the
[1:40:25] book in order for those those rights to
[1:40:28] be cleansed the book had to be
[1:40:32] open the book had to be open in order
[1:40:35] for you to become Adams
[1:40:40] again and when did happen the Bible says
[1:40:43] it happens at the seventh
[1:40:47] age we see that in the Book of
[1:40:49] Revelation chapter 10 when the mighty
[1:40:51] Angel comes down with open
[1:40:53] [Applause]
[1:40:57] so if we go back to Revelation chapter
[1:41:01] 5 so we notice that in chapter 5 the
[1:41:04] book is
[1:41:08] closed so John
[1:41:11] wept because he thought that it was the
[1:41:14] end of
[1:41:16] everything but the Bible says that the
[1:41:19] lamb went and he took the book out of
[1:41:22] the person that sat on the right
[1:41:28] hand the prophet say that's the most
[1:41:31] Sublime act
[1:41:36] ever the lamb went to take the
[1:41:39] book and no one else was
[1:41:43] worthy no one else was worthy but Jesus
[1:41:46] Christ himself
[1:41:49] came he said I am one of them
[1:41:54] I meet the
[1:41:57] requirements and and he he says give me
[1:42:00] that
[1:42:02] book so Christ took the
[1:42:05] book and that's why John was
[1:42:08] happy because he understood there was
[1:42:11] hope again for
[1:42:15] us amen
[1:42:20] amen all right let's keep reading so
[1:42:22] John was happy when he saw the the lamb
[1:42:25] took the
[1:42:26] book why was he why was he happy the
[1:42:29] prophet
[1:42:30] says he must have seen his names his
[1:42:34] name written in the
[1:42:36] book hallelujah hallelujah you know when
[1:42:39] you see your name written in the book of
[1:42:41] the Lamb's Book the the Lamb's Book of
[1:42:43] the Lamb's
[1:42:44] [Applause]
[1:42:46] Book you can't stay
[1:42:49] still you are no longer the same person
[1:42:53] you don't need nobody to motivate you to
[1:42:55] worship
[1:42:57] God you don't need someone to tell you
[1:43:00] stand up in order to praise the
[1:43:03] Lord you don't need to wait for your
[1:43:05] brother or your
[1:43:08] sister song says it's not my brother not
[1:43:11] my sister but it's
[1:43:14] me why because God Did It For
[1:43:17] Me The Prophet says that if the Rapture
[1:43:20] comes takes place
[1:43:23] and they said only five people had to
[1:43:26] go you have to have the right Faith to
[1:43:28] think that if those five people are got
[1:43:30] to be one of
[1:43:33] them why because the book has been
[1:43:35] revealed to
[1:43:37] you God has revealed himself to
[1:43:41] you he made he made himself personal to
[1:43:46] you I was reading the uh I was reading I
[1:43:49] was listening to a sermon uh Redemption
[1:43:52] by Fellowship by
[1:43:56] Redemption the prophet says it's
[1:43:58] different to just come to church and get
[1:44:00] healed when
[1:44:02] you speaking
[1:44:04] Tong or hearing the word and all
[1:44:08] that he says even your faith is not
[1:44:12] enough he says what pleases God is the
[1:44:16] fellowship with
[1:44:18] God what pleases God he wants to
[1:44:21] fellowship with you
[1:44:25] and God does not have a time where he
[1:44:27] only one time that he fellowship with
[1:44:32] you the Bible says I pray that you I
[1:44:34] wish that you pray
[1:44:37] everywhere fellowshipping with God in
[1:44:41] your workplace in your heart fellow with
[1:44:43] God in your closet fellowshipping with
[1:44:47] God because only those who fellowship
[1:44:50] with God will be raptured
[1:44:55] because Adam walked I mean Enoch walked
[1:44:58] with
[1:45:00] God and he was
[1:45:04] raptured God Jesus is the same yesterday
[1:45:07] today and
[1:45:09] forever if you want to be raptured you
[1:45:11] got to start walking with
[1:45:13] [Applause]
[1:45:15] God don't wait for those big steps start
[1:45:17] taking those baby
[1:45:20] steps the prophet says if you canot even
[1:45:23] have faith to be healed of a headache or
[1:45:26] to thick how are you going to have faith
[1:45:27] for the
[1:45:30] Rapture but you realize
[1:45:32] that God brings situations in our lives
[1:45:35] to build our
[1:45:38] faith this morning I'm telling you God
[1:45:41] wants to fellowship with
[1:45:43] you God for that
[1:45:47] Fellowship God is looking for sons and
[1:45:50] daughters who put everything aside and
[1:45:57] how do you fellowship with God you don't
[1:45:58] Fellowship in the
[1:46:00] head but you got to be in the
[1:46:04] spirit you are to be in the right
[1:46:06] channel in order to receive from
[1:46:15] God and one thing is if you are not
[1:46:18] receiving
[1:46:20] something don't give up
[1:46:23] there is an appointed time for you to
[1:46:28] receive when Jesus Christ
[1:46:31] came to the the thief on the
[1:46:35] cross his appointed time was on at the
[1:46:39] cross and you know what I love about
[1:46:41] God's appointed
[1:46:43] time is that when it's your
[1:46:45] time nothing will stop
[1:46:48] you when it's your time to be delivered
[1:46:53] there's not enough demons in hell that
[1:46:55] can stand
[1:46:58] it the the the man of
[1:47:03] God he was he was tormented for so many
[1:47:06] days
[1:47:08] years cutting
[1:47:10] himself but when his time
[1:47:13] came even though he had Legions of
[1:47:16] demons
[1:47:18] in those Legions could not stand the
[1:47:21] presence of the Living God
[1:47:25] those demons cannot stand the presence
[1:47:28] of the word
[1:47:32] made I repeat it again those demons
[1:47:35] could not stand the presence of the word
[1:47:37] made
[1:47:40] flesh what you need to do is eat the
[1:47:44] word let the word become flesh in
[1:47:47] you let the word the prophet says the
[1:47:50] more you eat of the word the more you
[1:47:52] build resist
[1:47:56] against
[1:47:58] that used to easily be set you now you
[1:48:01] have power over
[1:48:04] it how does he do you had to you have to
[1:48:07] become the
[1:48:09] word wait for your appointed time don't
[1:48:12] give
[1:48:14] up you are struggling with a certain
[1:48:16] spirit and you've been praying for it

[1:48:21] over I'm telling you that God is working
[1:48:23] on
[1:48:25] you as long as in your heart you desire
[1:48:28] to be delivered
[1:48:31] from that means that God is working with
[1:48:36] you it's not no man can add a cubid to
[1:48:39] its
[1:48:41] stue the Bible says after you've done
[1:48:43] all you can

[1:49:01] son or daughter of

[1:49:14] behind has not forgotten
[1:49:17] you whoever you are this morning have

[1:49:34] book he came back to claim his

[1:50:31] there is a change that need to be
[1:50:34] done what brings the change is the
[1:50:38] word brother s Paul cannot change
[1:50:42] you cannot change
[1:50:45] you Brooks cannot change
[1:50:48] you only the word of God can change you

[1:51:24] perverted but we had promised in Mal 4
[1:51:27] that we would receive a prophet that
[1:51:29] would
[1:51:33] rest when the word is
[1:51:36] open he makes you third
[1:51:40] Adams the third Adam is not just one
[1:51:44] man because when the word is open you
[1:51:47] become
[1:51:49] Adams you do the things that Adam did
[1:51:54] do the things that Eve
[1:51:56] did but the only difference is that this
[1:51:59] Adam will not

[1:52:16] blueprint he did not
[1:52:18] fail and he said the Bible he says all
[1:52:21] that was in God was pour into
[1:52:25] Christ that's
[1:52:29] why and all that was in Christ was P
[1:52:32] into

[1:53:32] bridge between the seven Church ages and
[1:53:34] the Seven
[1:53:38] Seals paragraph
[1:53:41] 19 the prophet says its Redemption means
[1:53:44] all legal possession to all that was
[1:53:47] lost by
[1:53:53] all legal
[1:53:58] possessions brother this so much in in
[1:54:01] this
[1:54:03] word don't just read this word just as
[1:54:05] it not like it's a random
[1:54:09] book start meditating on your on the
[1:54:12] word of
[1:54:15] God this book chapter 5 Revelation
[1:54:18] chapter 5 has a lot of meaning in your
[1:54:19] in your Lifey
[1:54:23] Revelation 10 has a lot of meaning in
[1:54:25] your
[1:54:27] life stud the
[1:54:31] word it's saying that that redemption
[1:54:34] mean that all legal possession that Adam
[1:54:36] was
[1:54:40] L what all that to do to a born again
[1:54:47] Christian it's legal possession to the
[1:54:49] abstract deed the title deed of eternal
[1:54:52] life
[1:54:56] it means that you possess everything
[1:54:58] that Adam and Eve
[1:55:03] lost hlu oh what of it brother that's
[1:55:12] right the possession of that
[1:55:16] deed that's what Revelation chapter 5
[1:55:19] means to
[1:55:21] you redeemed you but he had not yet
[1:55:26] claimed but we see that he went in
[1:55:28] Revelation 5 and he claims his
[1:55:35] rights so Christ the lamb he CH he took
[1:55:39] the
[1:55:41] book and we see that what does he do
[1:55:44] after he takes the
[1:55:46] book let's go to Revelation chapter
[1:55:51] 10 amen
[1:55:55] you know because God loves you so much
[1:55:57] he didn't want to
[1:56:01] keep when he took the book now he's like
[1:56:03] let me go give it to my
[1:56:08] sons the word came to
[1:56:12] you that's the mercy of God we don't go
[1:56:15] to the word the
[1:56:18] word he left heaven
[1:56:22] the angel came
[1:56:24] down because he's like I got to give
[1:56:27] this book back to to to it to its
[1:56:29] [Applause]
[1:56:32] owner they lost it in the Garden of
[1:56:35] Eden but now I come down to give you
[1:56:38] what belongs to
[1:56:40] you Brothers it's your
[1:56:43] inheritance sister it's your inheritance
[1:56:45] it belongs to
[1:56:46] you oh don't fall short of
[1:56:49] it apply everything you do in the apply
[1:56:52] that to the spiritual everything you do
[1:56:55] in the natural applies that to the
[1:56:58] spiritual if you heard that your a bank
[1:57:01] or someone gifted you $1
[1:57:08] million but it's it's somewhere in a
[1:57:10] bank in Chicago for
[1:57:14] instance I don't think you sit here just
[1:57:18] ignore that
[1:57:20] [Music]
[1:57:23] even right after service today you will
[1:57:25] take your car and drive through 5
[1:57:29] hours but you realize why would you do
[1:57:31] that because you understand the
[1:57:32] importance of
[1:57:37] that I wonder if many times we are not
[1:57:40] possessing our rights because we don't
[1:57:42] understand what it means to
[1:57:45] us do we really understand what it means
[1:57:48] to get back to the position that Adam
[1:57:50] was
[1:57:55] and if you don't then ask God to give
[1:57:56] you that
[1:58:01] Revelation you would go get the million
[1:58:03] dollar and you will tell them it belongs
[1:58:05] to
[1:58:08] me they'll ask you what's the proof you
[1:58:11] will give them the proof
[1:58:14] re oh brother this inheritance belongs
[1:58:17] to
[1:58:20] you this is the receipt
[1:58:23] this is the proof the mighty Angel has
[1:58:27] come
[1:58:28] down and you have been you have been
[1:58:31] able to see
[1:58:33] him the word
[1:58:37] Vindicated God even allowed the human
[1:58:40] cameras to take a picture of
[1:58:44] it because Satan would not have any
[1:58:49] excuses every promises in the book is
[1:58:51] your
[1:58:54] Satan is robbing you of that pointing
[1:58:56] back to
[1:59:00] 1963
[1:59:02] because when the mighty Angel comes
[1:59:05] down let's just read in Revelation 10
[1:59:07] you see that the book is
[1:59:10] open Revelation chapter
[1:59:14] 10 and I and I saw another Mighty Angel
[1:59:17] come down from heaven
[1:59:22] with a
[1:59:24] cloud and a rainbow was up on his
[1:59:28] head and his face was as it as it were
[1:59:32] the Sun and his feet as the pillars of
[1:59:36] fire and he had in his hand a little
[1:59:39] book
[1:59:42] open so this book is no longer
[1:59:45] closed all the mysteries of God are
[1:59:49] open oh Brothers Paul waited for this
[1:59:53] day the reformers they were looking for
[1:59:56] this
[1:59:57] day the prophet said they could only
[2:00:00] guess at
[2:00:02] that but now there's no more guessing
[2:00:04] because the owner of the book is coming
[2:00:06] down with the open
[2:00:11] book he broke the
[2:00:13] seals and now the book is
[2:00:17] open and you notice that well let's keep
[2:00:19] reading let's keep reading and and he
[2:00:22] cried with a loud voice and when a lion
[2:00:26] Roth and when he had cried seven
[2:00:29] Thunders outter their
[2:00:30] [Applause]
[2:00:31] voices and when the seven Thunders head
[2:00:34] out of their
[2:00:36] voices I was write and I Heard a Voice
[2:00:39] from Heaven saying unto
[2:00:41] me see up those things which the seven
[2:00:44] Thunders uttered and write
[2:00:48] them and the angel which I saw stood
[2:00:52] stand up on the sea and up on the earth
[2:00:54] lifted up his hand to to
[2:00:59] heaven and you swear by him that leaveth
[2:01:02] forever and ever who created heaven and
[2:01:04] the things that there in and the earth
[2:01:06] and the things that they are in and the
[2:01:08] Sea and the things which are therein
[2:01:10] that there should be time no
[2:01:19] longer the mighty angel coming down was
[2:01:21] at the end
[2:01:24] time there there's no more time time
[2:01:27] shall be no
[2:01:28] longer but in the days of the voice of
[2:01:31] the seventh
[2:01:34] angel when he shall begin to
[2:01:38] sound the mystery of God should be
[2:01:45] finished as he has declared to his
[2:01:47] servants the prophets
[2:01:52] begins to sound the mystery of
[2:01:56] God what is the mystery of God is Christ
[2:02:00] revealed the mystery of God is
[2:02:04] Christ the prophet preached the message
[2:02:06] Christ is the mystery of
[2:02:11] God even in the title The Prophet is
[2:02:14] already telling you what the
[2:02:19] mystery you know they say they say
[2:02:23] I don't know if I should say
[2:02:25] this but they say
[2:02:27] that some people believe that the Seven
[2:02:29] Seals have not been the seventh seal has
[2:02:31] not been
[2:02:39] revealed because when you when you read
[2:02:42] the if you listen to the message the
[2:02:44] seventh
[2:02:47] seal you can see that brother Ram when
[2:02:50] he was preaching he did not say what it
[2:02:55] was and he said the angel kept him from
[2:02:58] saying
[2:03:00] it but you have to know that also the
[2:03:03] prophet's
[2:03:05] life the way he did things it's it is
[2:03:08] the word in some in some and I'll prove
[2:03:11] it to you in a
[2:03:13] second I believe that had to happen that
[2:03:15] way for a
[2:03:18] purpose you know because the prophet
[2:03:21] says that Matthew chapter 24 Jesus
[2:03:23] preached on the six
[2:03:27] seals he preached on the six seals but
[2:03:30] he he did not speak about the
[2:03:40] seventh there's always that mystery
[2:03:42] about the six he preached on the six
[2:03:44] seals but he did the prophet says he
[2:03:46] omitted the Serv
[2:03:54] and we see that when brother brother B
[2:03:56] was preaching on the seals he preached
[2:03:57] on the six seals and the seventh he did
[2:03:59] not say
[2:04:03] anything let's bring this into let's a
[2:04:06] parall so Jesus preached on six
[2:04:10] seals but the seventh seal he did not
[2:04:12] preach
[2:04:14] about and he died on the cross brother
[2:04:18] Bram preached on The Sixth Seal and when
[2:04:20] he gets to the seventh he couldn't
[2:04:22] preach on
[2:04:24] it but then we see that when Jesus on
[2:04:26] the road to
[2:04:31] emus the disciples uh did they were
[2:04:34] blinded they could not recognize
[2:04:38] Jesus
[2:04:40] Jesus it was not revealed to them
[2:04:43] yet what did Jesus do he start he took
[2:04:47] them back to the
[2:04:49] word what did he start
[2:04:52] doing he started preaching to
[2:04:56] them revealing to them who Christ
[2:05:00] is if you read that you will see that
[2:05:03] Jesus started unveiling himself in the
[2:05:08] word in other word if you read that
[2:05:12] chapter if you have to give the title of
[2:05:14] the sermon that Jesus preached to the
[2:05:16] disciples why would you name it
[2:05:22] Christ is the mystery of God
[2:05:26] revealed because Christ is and the
[2:05:29] brother B he also does the same thing
[2:05:33] six the seventh one he does not talk
[2:05:36] about but we see he also comes back a
[2:05:39] few days
[2:05:41] later he says you want to know what the
[2:05:43] mystery
[2:05:45] is
[2:05:47] Christ is the mystery of God
[2:05:53] Christ is the mystery of God
[2:05:56] revealed because it's import the Bible
[2:05:59] says that all the Mysteries will be uh
[2:06:02] revealed at the sounding of the Sabbath
[2:06:07] Angel so he could if you he could not go
[2:06:10] before revealing the seventh the the
[2:06:16] seventh because that'll break the word
[2:06:21] that's
[2:06:22] good that would break the word but the
[2:06:26] word cannot be
[2:06:29] broken H let's just read it together to
[2:06:31] make sure that we're reading this
[2:06:34] together he said in verse seven but in
[2:06:36] the days of the voice of the seven
[2:06:40] Angel when he shall begin to
[2:06:45] sound the mystery of
[2:06:47] [Applause]
[2:06:48] God should be left undone
[2:06:54] the mystery of God I want you to read it
[2:06:56] yourself
[2:06:57] should
[2:07:00] finished what does the word finish that
[2:07:02] means there's nothing left to be
[2:07:12] revealed and then you you notice it it's
[2:07:16] one it says mystery not
[2:07:19] Mysteries the prophet says what is that
[2:07:22] it's the mystery that holds all the
[2:07:24] Mysteries
[2:07:30] together amen
[2:07:32] amen and I will read this one other
[2:07:39] quotes one
[2:07:43] second let's go to the message the
[2:07:47] bridge between the seven churches and
[2:07:49] the Seven Seals paragraph 41
[2:07:58] if you can project
[2:08:01] that so the prophet says and when the
[2:08:04] seals are
[2:08:06] broke so let's understand what is
[2:08:08] happening in Revelation chapter
[2:08:11] 10 the mystery is
[2:08:15] revealed down comes the angel the
[2:08:18] messenger Christ
[2:08:24] setting setting his foot upon the land
[2:08:26] and upon the sea with a rainbow over his
[2:08:31] head the rainbow is the Covenant
[2:08:36] Angel Christ himself the Covenant angel
[2:08:40] coming
[2:08:42] down but we see that when he's coming
[2:08:44] down the book is
[2:08:47] open but notice also what the prophet is
[2:08:50] saying
[2:08:52] he say but now
[2:08:54] remember that the seventh angel is on
[2:08:57] Earth at the time of this
[2:09:01] coming so the prophet is saying that
[2:09:03] when the mighty Angel is coming
[2:09:07] down this Earthly Angel is also on Earth
[2:09:10] at the same
[2:09:13] time and it goes fur he says just as
[2:09:16] John was giving his message
[2:09:21] the same time that Messiah come in the
[2:09:25] days John knew he would see
[2:09:29] him why because he was going to
[2:09:32] introduce
[2:09:35] him the prophet is comparing this
[2:09:38] seventh angel to what John
[2:09:42] did John was on Earth when the Messiah
[2:09:48] came the word of God comes to the
[2:09:54] prophet the only way you're going to
[2:09:56] recognize Christ is if the word unveils
[2:09:59] Christ to
[2:10:04] you and we realize that in the scripture
[2:10:07] over in Malachi
[2:10:09] 4 there is to be a one like
[2:10:14] John in Elijah to whom the word of God
[2:10:17] can come to
[2:10:21] and he is to reveal by the Holy
[2:10:26] Spirit he says all the mysteries of
[2:10:30] God so how can you say that the seventh
[2:10:33] still is not
[2:10:38] revealed it was a secret it's a
[2:10:42] secret and but you know he would reveal
[2:10:45] his secrets to only his
[2:10:49] redeemed maybe what you need to do get
[2:10:51] on your
[2:10:52] knees fellowship with
[2:10:55] God like a husband and
[2:11:00] wife the married couples can can testify
[2:11:03] to this or even people who have been in
[2:11:06] relationship when you love someone so
[2:11:09] much you Fellowship so much with that
[2:11:13] person you have a habit of revealing
[2:11:16] secrets to that person
[2:11:21] you don't even mean you oh I didn't mean
[2:11:23] to
[2:11:26] say and God is the same
[2:11:29] way he say shall I hide what I'm about
[2:11:32] to do in to
[2:11:34] [Applause]
[2:11:36] Abraham God does not have a habit of
[2:11:39] hiding his stuff to his his
[2:11:43] [Applause]
[2:11:45] redeemed and Jesus is also saying shall
[2:11:47] I hide it to my bride
[2:11:50] [Music]
[2:11:51] oh no he
[2:11:53] cannot because we see that in Revelation
[2:11:55] the angel did not keep it to
[2:11:59] himself he came and he gave the book to
[2:12:03] John the prophet says that book had all
[2:12:06] the mysteries of
[2:12:09] God and now the book was in the hand of
[2:12:13] the
[2:12:15] Bride so that means and you notice he
[2:12:17] didn't give the book to everybody only
[2:12:19] to John
[2:12:22] and the prophet tells us that John is
[2:12:24] the type of the
[2:12:27] Bride so not everybody can see all the
[2:12:30] mysteries of
[2:12:33] God just because you come here on a
[2:12:35] Sunday morning and you see
[2:12:40] down brothers and sisters I'm telling
[2:12:43] you that even Satan comes to church on
[2:12:48] Sunday not everybody here in this I hope
[2:12:51] everybody is of God but not
[2:12:56] everybody and when Satan come what does
[2:12:58] he do the Bible says in order for Spirit
[2:13:01] the prophet say in order for a spirit to
[2:13:02] be affected he need to use a
[2:13:08] body Satan comes and he sit down in
[2:13:11] these
[2:13:14] PWS and what is he going to try to do to
[2:13:16] distract you from the word of God
[2:13:22] you know if you if you if you have a
[2:13:24] chance to to read the the introduction
[2:13:26] of the book The Seven Church
[2:13:29] age I love what the prophet says
[2:13:32] there he says I can never emphasize on
[2:13:35] the importance of
[2:13:45] Revelation he says Revelation means more
[2:13:48] to you than you ever realized
[2:13:53] very
[2:13:55] important he also
[2:13:58] says when you like it doesn't take
[2:14:02] comparing scripture with
[2:14:06] scriptures he doesn't take having the
[2:14:08] ability to write or
[2:14:12] read but remember what Jesus told Peter
[2:14:15] the flesh and blood has not revealed
[2:14:17] this to you
[2:14:22] but my father who is in heaven has
[2:14:27] revealed and the prophet in the seven
[2:14:29] Church AG book in the beginning he says
[2:14:32] this he says not everybody will be able
[2:14:35] to catch the mystery behind the seven
[2:14:41] church he says he will take a special
[2:14:44] class of people to be able to get it
[2:14:52] he'll take a special class of
[2:14:54] people is that special class looking
[2:14:58] at because if Christ could come and die
[2:15:01] for
[2:15:02] you that means you have to be so
[2:15:05] special that he offer his blood for
[2:15:12] you so not everybody so don't even fast
[2:15:15] or argue with those people that says not
[2:15:17] the are not revealed
[2:15:22] but don't put them away
[2:15:23] too you know some the prophet says that
[2:15:26] he compar the the pennies some can only
[2:15:30] take as much as they can like they're
[2:15:32] not builds for
[2:15:37] that but it doesn't mean they're not
[2:15:42] Christians you still need to love them
[2:15:46] you still need to treat them
[2:15:47] right because the the some of them will
[2:15:51] be washed in the
[2:15:54] tribulation and the Bible says I saw
[2:15:57] tens of thousands of thousands of
[2:15:58] thousands of them up there serving
[2:16:03] God because if you mistreat them then
[2:16:06] you mistreating
[2:16:09] God because in heaven they are Servants
[2:16:11] of
[2:16:13] God and Jesus says if you if you
[2:16:16] mistreat the my servant if I send you a
[2:16:18] servant you mistreat them yeah you've
[2:16:19] not rejecting them but you rejecting
[2:16:28] how are you special the world the world
[2:16:30] looks at you like how are you able to
[2:16:32] love someone who just did
[2:16:36] something that's what a special class of
[2:16:38] people
[2:16:40] is someone does something hurtful to you
[2:16:42] you can
[2:16:44] forgive brother say if you want to
[2:16:47] measure your love for someone don't
[2:16:49] don't look at how you love the person
[2:16:51] that
[2:16:55] right but love your
[2:16:59] enemies the prophet says that's when you
[2:17:01] know you got it when you he he said
[2:17:05] remember now it's not something that you
[2:17:07] it's something it's not something made
[2:17:08] up it has to be real don't f
[2:17:11] it if it's not there it's not there ask
[2:17:14] God for it and he'll give it to
[2:17:17] you but something just in your heart
[2:17:22] that when your brother is doing
[2:17:23] something evil to
[2:17:26] you you come to church you get on your
[2:17:28] knees and you pray for
[2:17:30] them brother if you want to know if
[2:17:33] you've made it get to that
[2:17:35] level Prophet call
[2:17:39] love I'm taking too long sorry let me
[2:17:41] just wrap it up with a few things
[2:17:46] here so we see in Revelation 10 that the
[2:17:49] book is open
[2:17:52] and we see that and when I went unto the
[2:17:54] angel I said unto him give me the little
[2:17:56] book and he said unto me take it and eat
[2:17:58] it up and you shall make thy belly
[2:18:01] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[2:18:02] sweet as
[2:18:10] honey you know what I love about the
[2:18:12] mercy the mercy and the grace of God is
[2:18:14] that he comes to
[2:18:17] you he knows that you are a man you are
[2:18:19] full of failures
[2:18:23] and he comes to
[2:18:25] you John did not go to the mighty angel
[2:18:28] in
[2:18:30] heaven the mighty angel came down with a
[2:18:34] book the book had a
[2:18:37] message the book is this message of the
[2:18:41] hour and the grace of God is that you
[2:18:43] did not go to the message the message
[2:18:45] came to
[2:18:49] you mess has found
[2:18:53] you why because you are one of
[2:18:58] his when you hear the message you hear
[2:19:01] your name in the
[2:19:04] book when you receive the message that
[2:19:07] means that your name was written in the
[2:19:09] book
[2:19:13] of because if it was not you cannot
[2:19:16] receive
[2:19:18] it but so many people confus is
[2:19:21] receiving the message and agreeing with
[2:19:23] the
[2:19:27] message you know in the prophet the
[2:19:28] message in the talk in the message the
[2:19:30] prophet says you can't agree with this
[2:19:33] message you can't even believe this
[2:19:37] message but if the token is not applied
[2:19:43] you and when the token is truly applied
[2:19:46] you will want to do the father's will
[2:19:52] If the message says that men should not
[2:19:54] drink you fight
[2:19:57] it if the men if the the message says
[2:19:59] that you you should not
[2:20:02] drink you abstain from
[2:20:05] it if you are struggling with
[2:20:08] it I'm not telling you to give
[2:20:11] up but I'm telling you to keep
[2:20:14] fighting because the Bible says to
[2:20:16] resist the devil
[2:20:20] tried to even resist
[2:20:23] it in your heart you want to overcome
[2:20:27] it you know you want to
[2:20:33] overcome but you have to
[2:20:36] resist and you have to leave it up to
[2:20:39] God so the book and the because the book
[2:20:42] is open you can't overcome
[2:20:47] it I'm going very slow sorry
[2:20:52] give me just another 15 minutes and I'll
[2:20:54] WP
[2:20:58] you so
[2:21:03] um let me just read this one at the quot
[2:21:07] again uh in the seven the same message
[2:21:09] the bridge between the seven Church
[2:21:14] ages so by now in the paragraph 251 by
[2:21:17] now in the seven Sevenfold book of seals
[2:21:20] of redemption
[2:21:23] that the lamb took with him himself was
[2:21:25] the only one who could do
[2:21:27] [Music]
[2:21:29] it and he took it from the right hand of
[2:21:32] him that sat upon the throne to claim
[2:21:35] his
[2:21:39] Redemptive TOA his
[2:21:43] right to claim for me and you what he
[2:21:47] redeemed us from
[2:21:55] he claimed it for you and
[2:21:57] me back to everything that Adam Lost In
[2:22:00] the Garden of
[2:22:03] Eden the prophet says he has redeemed us
[2:22:06] back to
[2:22:09] that he did not say he will redeem us
[2:22:12] back to
[2:22:14] that or he is redeeming back us back
[2:22:19] to but he
[2:22:23] has so that means that now you have the
[2:22:26] same position
[2:22:29] with go brother this is very powerful if
[2:22:32] you can only catch this
[2:22:34] Revelation I pray that God drops this
[2:22:37] Revelation in your
[2:22:40] heart that's why the Earth is groan
[2:22:42] they're looking for sons of God have
[2:22:45] that
[2:22:47] Revelation that's why the the mother
[2:22:50] aost went to the
[2:22:53] prophet and the prophet says she came at
[2:22:56] 10:00 in the
[2:22:57] [Applause]
[2:22:58] morning and they they are creatures of
[2:23:01] night so they could not even see in the
[2:23:05] day how did they get in in front of the
[2:23:08] prophet's
[2:23:11] gate the apost somehow knew that there
[2:23:14] was a Son of God
[2:23:19] somewhere when he the prophet says he
[2:23:21] might have gotten into an accident or
[2:23:22] something she might
[2:23:25] got but she knew that there was a Son of
[2:23:28] God
[2:23:32] somewhere so she could not see dur in
[2:23:34] the day they don't see you in the
[2:23:38] day so God had had to be the one that
[2:23:41] led the apost to the
[2:23:48] prophet sometimes God bring situation in
[2:23:51] front of you so that you can show them
[2:23:53] that you are the God of this
[2:23:58] earth when you lose a job I'm telling
[2:24:00] you that the book has been open and you
[2:24:02] can't speak a
[2:24:07] job the book has been open you can't
[2:24:10] speak your loved ones into
[2:24:17] salvation the prophet did that to show
[2:24:19] us you know our position so the went to
[2:24:23] the
[2:24:25] prophet and she laid there in front of
[2:24:27] the G several
[2:24:31] days and when the prophet prayed to
[2:24:34] God God told him that you call this
[2:24:37] mother of Pome a good
[2:24:40] mother a out
[2:24:43] of but I sent her to your gate and she's
[2:24:47] still
[2:24:49] lay I wonder if it's some of us this
[2:24:53] morning God sent us mothers in our
[2:24:57] lives several days but we keep on just
[2:25:03] complaining what
[2:25:06] because but he sent those situation so
[2:25:08] that we can control
[2:25:12] it do you know maybe God allow for you
[2:25:15] to be the only believer of the message
[2:25:17] in your family so you can show so you
[2:25:19] can speak them into uh the
[2:25:25] message brothers and sisters you can do
[2:25:29] it brother Bram did that with head right
[2:25:35] you know head right she believe the
[2:25:38] word and then the prophet says because
[2:25:41] you believe the word ask what you will
[2:25:43] and you shall be
[2:25:47] given and she said she asked for the
[2:25:49] Salvation of her
[2:25:51] children and the prophet say I give you
[2:25:54] your
[2:25:56] children you see he did not say God
[2:25:59] gives you your
[2:26:01] children he said I give you your
[2:26:05] children why because I am the god of
[2:26:07] this
[2:26:09] Earth why what makes me the god of the
[2:26:12] earth is when the god Liv inside of
[2:26:18] me what is your situ this
[2:26:21] morning the book is
[2:26:24] open speak the
[2:26:26] word speak the word if you need money
[2:26:30] speak
[2:26:33] money brothers and sisters the word of
[2:26:35] God cannot
[2:26:39] fail and sometimes ago I was preaching
[2:26:41] in Iowa
[2:26:43] City and I told them that the word of
[2:26:45] God cannot
[2:26:46] [Applause]
[2:26:47] fail I told them to take God at his word
[2:26:50] word and ask what they they need and he
[2:26:53] will be given to
[2:26:55] them why I had not confidence in my
[2:26:59] words confidence in the word of
[2:27:02] God yeah I didn't I didn't say it God
[2:27:05] said
[2:27:06] it my duty to back up his word
[2:27:13] it's three the Bible God says challenge
[2:27:17] me God loves to be challenged
[2:27:22] brother the word of God is the
[2:27:25] truth what I preach to you this morning
[2:27:27] is the
[2:27:29] truth the word is
[2:27:31] open the word is
[2:27:34] revealed and I'm telling you this
[2:27:36] morning it means that you have the
[2:27:37] authority to speak things into
[2:27:40] exist and I challenge you this morning
[2:27:43] in the name of Jesus Christ if you do
[2:27:45] that you will see that come to
[2:27:48] pass my
[2:27:51] and when I when I told them
[2:27:53] that a young couple they needed
[2:27:57] money they did not even want to wait
[2:27:59] till when they go home that same sermon
[2:28:02] they
[2:28:03] prayed I told them if you need money ask
[2:28:06] God and he'll give it to
[2:28:09] you prove him and he's going to tell you
[2:28:11] that he's
[2:28:13] God they prayed asking God for
[2:28:17] money they said that as s as they were
[2:28:20] leaving the church going outside of the
[2:28:24] building they got a call from
[2:28:27] somebody telling them that I just
[2:28:29] randomly thought about you and I'm
[2:28:31] sending you
[2:28:33] [Music]
[2:28:35] $1,000 why because if you have
[2:28:38] confidence in the word of
[2:28:41] God he will bring it to
[2:28:44] pass the Earth is
[2:28:47] groaning your workplace is looking for
