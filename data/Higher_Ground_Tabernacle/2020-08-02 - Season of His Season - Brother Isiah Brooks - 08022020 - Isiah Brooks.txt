[Music] okay [Music] hallelujah i trust that he's your friend by god's grace lord is good to us this morning we thank god for his amazing grace [Music] is my wife's mother it's uh in serious condition right now we are praying about her recovery bed man but i love mine and so it's a lot of weight right now a lot of weight that don't but we do trust god [Music] and even though the doctors have given up on my mother-in-law many other relatives have given up that will not give up father we have not received anything of that [Music] when it was looked so impossible but you raised her up and that's what we're asking tonight if you know grace would be with us we're not worthy of [Music] as we turn to the scripture we're going to ask that you turn psalms the first chapter we start at the third verse we're just going to read that particular verse and then we'll go to acts and then we'll read the tenth through the twelfth verse glad to see everybody this morning psalms 1 third verse poison version and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now you don't need um be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom you have crucified who god raised from the dead even by him did this man stand here before you oh no jesus this is the stone which was set at north of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved [Music] let us pray father most of all that we may be able to commune with you now in the name of jesus christ amen amen you may be seated speaking of communion we will also have communion services beginning at three o'clock last week we we ministered perfect compassion of his will and we showed by god's grace that god compassion is different from ours oftentimes we want to give compassion who was not as brother branham said the sickest of all the people because he was asked what was his problem and he said every time i tried to get into the pool is that the shock would you say someone that beats me to it hallelujah and jesus christ jesus healed [Music] we may or full control it didn't control god the holy ghost he only would do the things in which the father showed him but when you're moving by the compassion of god you will do what god will commands you to do there is only one perfection and the perfection in which god sees the perfection is until god perfects it and he perfects it by the changing of the body never confuse the two confounded times we work so hard he who you are i have a message this morning which is somewhat part 2. of the perfect compassion of his will but i like to uh entitle this message of his season hallelujah and when god gave me this message a countryman there were so many thoughts in my mind and i didn't know which way to start with it but then the lord showed me before the fall caprila the lives of adam and eve but he also gave them a free moral agent a free moral will the liberal they [Music] eve so much ever till he joined himself to her in order to save her poop hallelujah and i thought about the second half egypt [Music] it's because of who you are hallelujah we are in a season and sometimes season we call it his season and brother branham is going to explain that to us in just a moment but i like to say it like this we have come through seven church ages are different and we have had seven messengers hallelujah and you can actually take this thought if we point from genesis to revelation do you need an apocalypse how that the church was on fire at one point and then they became the syrian at another point and god had revived him all over again two seasons and the caterpillar they're all demonic powers they have always been eaten away from the church hallelujah now understand this these demonic powers we understand that the rapture is soon to take place i'm so glad you're all happy this morning well if you ain't got the joy i got the joy let's move on and i'm taking my time it's your home so you won't have any excuse i'm not understanding what i'm saying but anyway we realized that god has done a great work did you have been you see we are not the first to come in we're actually the last on the on the books and men continue to make the same mistakes because they don't study they don't read you know they don't pray and they fail to see that history please repeat itself repeat hallelujah if israel see israel would have understood that the demons that they had in egypt was going to follow them hallelujah [Music] many of them saw the prophet many of them had a pill of fire and many of them were lost hello even in jesus day the same spirit had continued even though they had gone israel had been locked up into babylon memphis hallelujah even they didn't leave the spirits there you know they see this project their ancestors gave them hallelujah hallelujah because abraham saw my day abraham and he rejoiced in and god was nowhere to be seen hallelujah so you'll know and that is the spirit of god and the spirit of the devil you are a terrible these two spirits wants to be worshipped not the only one to be worshipped satan if you know what you mean in church because let me say it like this listen one just you see it sir is it's the time brother he's trying to see what the perfect will of god is and he he he had different dreams like the one he was there just like the dream said it would be [Music] is that right in arizona picking up a a cockapoo off of his pant leg he said there was a blast and out of that blast came seven angels i keep forgetting to bring my let uh can somebody go get my picture off the oscillator go through a little thank you sir thank you i i want i want because people might be looking at this on on the camera i have some new converts or new people who are listening to this message they believe it they they said maybe hindering them but they believe it so i want to show something here because i think we're missing something he's still that camera can turn turn over this way we fail to see now we've got just something here because you know what we don't understand what's happening but with those seven thunders out of their voices available because what we fail to see hallelujah it took malachi 4. is that right william branham was not just the messenger to the church ages oh is i hope i don't stumble somebody scorpio is not shocked by character brother said justification make room for sanctification vacation may rule because of the baptisms we're dealing with the very amen because you gotta understand that when eve met adam was not just the spirit i don't need the practice on the pride amen to help you how could i say it it's to hone you out hallelujah shape you even hallelujah because what was lost when he slept with the serpent that the jehovah god could connect with the jews hallelujah why because it is the jehovah god oh somebody help me here but in order to forget the headstone oh god help us here so if you can see let me read on listen i know what some of y'all you know the truth of the matter is the secret the election is election it is not based upon no you may not even uh be able to explain it because in reality god cannot be explained hallelujah but that if you have the seed of god on the inside of you the word of god began you you say amen amen to every word of god whether you understand it or not you still knew [Music] it was jesus said hallelujah but no one else could know it but him so when you hear hello guys flatter you telling theirs they're john oh this is on the show he has their relationship with god so many people that come to church here that you know you make me feel like it's just a ritual it's your religion you come because of allah but if that be the case you really need an experience from god you see because right now god is making a bride he's really [Applause] he's forming a bride [Music] it ain't about the man who could bring the message so well actually um and desire to eat capacity hallelujah hallelujah is that all right but he knowed me but every perfect overcomer that's good receives a new name oh no but a lot of people we missed that because you know what the devil tells you because he's the same person [Music] is that all right sorry did you notice jacob i'ma say something you're going to call you're going to go look it up but you understand that the holy ghost is a temporary gift exclusively why is that there's something else greater comes yeah there's something greater than something greater can something greater the truth you know what's greater god himself remember hallelujah you understand me it ain't it ain't just like a russian mighty win anymore you know what the holy ghost is doing it's birthing you into his own genetics you performed as a opportunity into his own genetics that's why so many people can have the holy ghost all their life how can the pentecostals have the holy ghost because they refuse their headshots they refuse what's right the hatred out of your life [Music] it is painful you've got to get the thorns out of your flesh and the holy ghost is the only one is that right that's right they come to justification they come through sanctification and when they went into the promised land refused the baptism of the holy spirit caleb joshua and caleb [Music] right and everybody that played around when moses was gone amen that's your bible you love the lord but when he wrestled with the lord all night long because the pentecostal churches they had the holy ghost [Music] he said look at the people in the catholic church they go there and they visit peter yvonne they don't kiss the p peter's foot so much they had to replace his toes so many times and we do the same thing in the physique we're doing the same but so many of us just like those pharisees and sadducees jesus christ he's standing right there and he said except you believe that i am he is because i know that if some of us are not delivered from that spirit see yes i'm exalting jesus christ and no devil likes i'll reveal my new name to him and everywhere every overcomer among such as them that if them leaders and so forth now all the children of israel didn't get their names changed but those high leaders may see overcome they have received a new name think and remember only the high priest could go into the veil a hidden manner hallelujah do we has to be restored oh that they had eaten up it had to be restored the devil went right to the root but in the mystery man don't think grace i'm so glad this is scene just use the words that's one thing i love about jesus he doesn't look at the outward you know they got the power but he looked at the heart hallelujah jesus said one time jesus [Music] i'm actually jumping my message anyway god is here to hold us out i'm so sorry if you think you come here for a picnic you are wrong you have mistaken the fire is hit up it heated up seven times of the hebrew bomb sit for before hallelujah god chose you to conquer him somebody helped me here you might feel defeated before but you cannot be defeated god is on your side but you see you got to keep reminding yourself of who you are you don't read your bible you don't pray even god can talk to you so that god can talk to you you know sometimes we don't read our bible so god put you on your knees so he can talk to you that's how they do for fun all he's going to tell you is the things that are already in your body he's going to get the message to you one way or the other let me move on signs of his coming this afternoon the stunt grows from wesley through luther [Music] those that got the baptism of the holy ghost and shall come some days the headstones christ jesus in the these last days jesus christ have a ministry just exactly like here now brother branham is not just throwing things out in the end but what he's saying here it wasn't the man with the big belt buckles so hallelujah it wasn't the man with the cowboy hat we are supposed to be shaped that the baptism of the holy ghost is praying and shall come some day even though the head stones christ jesus christ hallelujah let me this is what he said and shall come christ jesus jesus christ someday now why did this mighty angel come down you know what it comes from oh god help me do you really believe in the literal coming of jesus christ absolutely but one thing i love about jesus hallelujah make me want to shout out because you know what it was better than what rebecca god rebecca didn't know what he looked like and that's what we ought to be designing the very word of god loving the unlovable sickness somebody helped me so what and he goes on to say and he continues and shall come someday the it's greater than just blue concord having the toys to play with the the joy hallelujah you know what i love the lord james because oftentimes he put us through things that that's good sometimes can be quite embarrassing you know when you're supposed to be dead [Music] pride luxury and pride comes before fall you understand me what we don't understand excluding and until you come to a place you love god more than you love the things you are playing with hello oh god deliver me from the lust of the flesh until you come to a place where you hate it we've got so many people in the message hello y'all getting quiet even though i was like it's true we got brothers think that god is just going to say oh i'm sorry oh i'm sorry i was trying to save that word from them but i knew that one in french whatever but my point is you gotta hate it you got to expose it would it be exposed you want grace but just pretend you had a movie looking at the tv just going with that and shall come someday i can feel the pressure of wanting to leave the headstone as it gets closer so sentence [Applause] in the season that the prophet is bringing in he said god fruit that the free the jew the prophet god bring forth his good god's fruit bring forth his god through is [Music] together you don't have to turn there i'm reading a quote still [Music] until adoption of children by jesus christ that would happen right now along the road [Music] in just a moment [Music] in the we all died and by everything done to it right and what happened he cannot die but he will not die in him word of god is it free it's going to prevail what the see we got to be careful that we don't allow satan to replace the natural things oh excuse me replacing the spiritual things complacency it is free nothing imprisons god hallelujah is that right the system was so tight the system is when jesus came all the time hallelujah amen is that right and how could jesus jesus kill a man on the sabbath day but you see before you others were being stoned for those reasons oh but where the spirit of the lord is he knew he had a character has come to nonsense nonsense and it did in that day and it will in this day bring us back to god not with an injection of education theology [Music] and we need a church cleaning up zombies i'm going to let you go there's another quote i want to read by love the lord just bear with me i have it i'll find it oh god okay i'm a quick i'm gonna quit with this you see there's a law of god and we know the law there's a law that the son is going to come up every day no you know what even jesus said unto the people of his day you have so much science and this is what scares me about almost all the believers maybe i'm losing my mind i just feel like the people are not discerning what time they're living in measures be very senior now coming from the message restoration of the bride just giving you a word of courage he said because why he has spoken he has spoken a word and put a law with that word and the law is his own law is no covenant should be confirmed without an oath that he could listen to before he did that i functioned himself in himself the oath i personal program sure i'll raise it up again in three days just destroy it and see what happened he voiced let me go on the read god the earth in law everything in nature works according to god's law that you know there's not a thing excuse me now it lays this using it there's not a thing we can take one of these light little things [Music] and that when the sun comes into the seed [Music] is that life out of the sea hold it anymore according to his own words there listen i want you to really listen this is my last election is remember if you speak positive the anger of the lord can work for you launch the jupiter forever no matter what the conditions is [Music] is is very much more like a thousand years probably nothing but that's going to be possible but [Music] it was that problem with the word of god and the word had been spoken about the law of god by the spirit raise them up the bible said they come into the city he said lift up ye everlasting those that were in captivity never even had the holy ghost members is [Music] [Music] oh help us jesus women receive their dead rage to life again i'm almost done sacrifice under a sheep sacrifice sacrifice that could not divorce him [Music] [Music] oh in the morning when i rise in the morning when i rise in the morning when [Music] give me jesus give me jesus [Music] in the hallelujah [Music] oh give me jesus should i come to die oh [Music] me me jesus [Music] oh give me jesus all of this let's just hum this song [Music] in the morning when i [Music] in the rise when i rise in the [Music] give me morning give me jesus amen let's just give the lord a clap offering this morning amen how many can say the lord has spoken to me i just want that holy ghost so they can prepare that way for jesus christ the person of himself to come and dwell within us amen so that we'll be waiting for that day when we're gonna see him amen let's sing this song oh i want to see him look upon his face [Music] let's put our hands together [Music] as i journey through the land as i go pointing salt to calvary to the crimson floor many arrows pierce my soul from without within but my lord [Music] oh i want to see him look upon his face [Music] the dark may be the night woe thankful close to him he will give me life may that's my soul turn my thoughts aside by the [Music] look upon his face and dare to sing forever off his saving
