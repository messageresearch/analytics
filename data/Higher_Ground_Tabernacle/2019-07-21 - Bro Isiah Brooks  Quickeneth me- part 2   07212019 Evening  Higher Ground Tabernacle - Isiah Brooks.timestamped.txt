[0:00] the right or right to left marching up
[0:03] the aisle
[0:04] coming back down it was a beautiful
[0:06] situation thank God for His grace thank
[0:10] God for old momma that taught me a
[0:12] little bit of something about Jesus she
[0:15] could have taught me about Allah my
[0:17] daddy was a Muslim but she didn't she
[0:21] taught me about Jesus Christ and I thank
[0:24] God for that old lady when I hear songs
[0:27] like that I I remember just how
[0:31] wonderful it was when she was here on
[0:35] earth you love the Lord I trust
[0:39] everybody was blessed this morning one
[0:42] thing I can truly say if nobody else
[0:44] leaves out here blessed I always do cuz
[0:48] I realized this God preacher - not me
[0:51] you know I appreciate the Lord Jesus as
[0:56] we stand I I'm gonna start with Matthew
[1:01] 16:18 first we're gonna continue the
[1:05] word that we spoke on this morning
[1:19] the way the reason why I love this
[1:21] message so is because it makes
[1:23] everything so simple and so easy trust
[1:29] the Lord with all your heart and lean
[1:32] not to your own understanding
[1:34] acknowledge the Lord in all of his ways
[1:37] and he shall direct your path election
[1:41] always tells us there's nothing you can
[1:43] do about it
[1:44] it's already fixed and those of you who
[1:48] of us who have ears to hear
[1:50] we just need to trust the voice that we
[1:52] hear it's about trust it's about really
[1:56] you know loving God and trusting him no
[1:59] matter what the circumstances may seem
[2:02] to be I love God and you know I do
[2:06] understand what brother Branham said he
[2:09] said if God choose to send him to hell
[2:10] he's still loving and one thing I can
[2:13] truly say that that is so true if you
[2:17] love him now you're loving then there's
[2:19] no way of changing that and you know
[2:22] it's it's the love that God has given us
[2:25] his it's beyond material things it's not
[2:29] what he's done for us in this world in
[2:32] this life he's given us something
[2:34] inwardly that money can't pay for and
[2:37] he's given us a hope beyond the grave
[2:38] he's given us something that no man can
[2:42] give us everybody everything fails you
[2:44] we feel ourselves but God has never
[2:48] failed us he's always been there always
[2:51] been there Matthew 16 I love him so much
[2:55] I wish I could I'm trying to live like I
[2:58] love him the way I love him y'all
[3:01] understand what I'm trying to say he I
[3:04] if there be any frustration if there be
[3:07] anything like Paul says how to perform
[3:11] that's what I want that and it's coming
[3:15] it's mine it's yours the scripture says
[3:31] sorry
[3:33] as given to us to know the mystery the
[3:37] revelation of God who a prophet told us
[3:40] that we were sealed before the
[3:43] foundation that's what I hold on to not
[3:46] if I'm going to be I've already been so
[3:48] I will be Amen it has nothing to do with
[3:53] man in his efforts and I love that and I
[3:57] say unto thee that thou art Peter and
[4:01] upon this rock I will build my church
[4:05] and the case of hell shall not prevail
[4:09] against it the word lives forever lives
[4:18] eternally lives powerfully lives the
[4:25] word is God let us pray
[4:27] father God we come before you and we
[4:29] thank you for your amazing grace no one
[4:34] no one no one there's no one like Jesus
[4:38] your name is still sweet to my lips Lord
[4:42] the sound of your name's Lord your name
[4:45] vibrates my heart father how we love you
[4:49] thank you for your amazing grace we
[4:52] thank you for those who are pressing
[4:54] remember this little flock Lord we may
[4:58] not be what we desire to be with Lord we
[5:00] know we're not what we used to be father
[5:03] we press toward that kingdom that we're
[5:06] pressing toward that mark over high
[5:09] calling which is in Christ thank you for
[5:12] your amazing grace bless the service in
[5:16] a special way we ask these things in
[5:19] Jesus Christ's name we pray in Lord
[5:22] before I close I just pray that you
[5:24] remember my brother Sean Edwards there
[5:27] in South Africa Lord you there you here
[5:29] you everywhere father we pray that you
[5:33] ministered to him in the physical as
[5:36] well as a spiritual realm Lord we
[5:39] believe with all our heart that somehow
[5:41] you
[5:42] work this miracle that we've asked for
[5:45] we believe it Jesus we believe that
[5:48] you're going to bring him through this
[5:51] and bring him back to a healthy state
[5:53] we're just waiting to see the end result
[5:58] but we have received that already in our
[6:02] soul we thank you for his victory in
[6:04] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[6:07] you may be seated
[6:16] I like to say by God's grace even as the
[6:23] Prophet God has said he says the only
[6:26] way that you're ever known the real
[6:29] meaning of power and healing and
[6:32] salvation really means it is a spiritual
[6:38] revelation of the will of the Word of
[6:42] God you'll never learn it anywhere else
[6:46] only by revelation and no matter how
[6:50] that was from the message dr. Moses no
[6:54] matter how we think that we can do
[7:01] anything
[7:02] we understand that everything we're
[7:05] doing is because it's moving by the
[7:07] power of God and once we recognize that
[7:11] he is the Alpha and the Omega he is the
[7:15] beginning he is the ending then we began
[7:19] to understand that everything like I
[7:21] said this morning that we do good it
[7:23] comes from God the Bible says every good
[7:26] and perfect gift comes from God and you
[7:31] and I must understand that he forever
[7:34] eternally lives in us and I want you to
[7:38] repeat that for me
[7:39] he forever eternally lives in me say it
[7:46] again he forever eternally lives in me
[7:51] one more time he forever eternally lives
[7:58] in me because you must understand him
[8:03] forever is time and it has an ending but
[8:08] eternally has no ending and you and I
[8:12] must understand that right now is
[8:14] forever and forever but one day it's
[8:18] going to be completely eternally the
[8:20] life in us is eternal it cannot die this
[8:25] flesh can it comes to an end
[8:29] when this flesh comes to an end we know
[8:31] that we have a tabernacle a building
[8:35] that's not made by the hand of man I am
[8:40] so thankful for the revelation of who
[8:43] Jesus is because I know he's not afar
[8:46] off he's not in heaven somewhere but
[8:50] he's in me he's in you and that's the
[8:53] way we must see it we cannot expect our
[8:57] flesh to like the word your flesh don't
[9:02] like the word your flesh and your the
[9:04] Word of God our enemies that's the word
[9:08] they fight against each other
[9:11] hallelujah so don't ever think that your
[9:14] flesh oh yeah
[9:15] what makes your flesh enjoy Jesus is
[9:18] because when the anointing comes in the
[9:22] presence in his presence is fullness of
[9:25] joy like we said this morning we must
[9:28] understand Amen that we have a we should
[9:31] have such confidence in God just to see
[9:35] where God has brought us where he's
[9:38] brought us from and where he's taking us
[9:40] to all of us has testimonies that we're
[9:44] not what we used to be that in itself or
[9:48] to keep us encouraged to let us know
[9:51] that we are on a journey we are
[9:53] traveling hallelujah and we're moving
[9:56] from time into eternity amen
[9:59] now God always he sees everything he
[10:02] knows everything and like I said
[10:05] whenever you are in trouble God always
[10:07] shows up he loves he meant to show his
[10:10] power he loves he's a man of war that's
[10:14] why the Bible calls him the captain of
[10:16] the laws host amen
[10:17] he loves to war and the only way that he
[10:21] could be made manifest is that he needs
[10:23] us hallelujah is that all right now we
[10:29] must understand if God has called you
[10:31] that is one of the greatest things ever
[10:33] because everybody is not called by God
[10:36] there are some that are and will go to
[10:39] hell there's some that will and hard
[10:42] call
[10:43] - mr. rapture we have we must know that
[10:46] but if God is placed in your heart that
[10:49] you are bride nothing can take that from
[10:52] you listen in Israel in the church he
[10:57] said if God has called you the love of
[11:00] God is ringing in your heart and all
[11:02] that has he has called will come to him
[11:05] and none of it will be lost God promised
[11:10] he said none of them shall be lost all
[11:14] the father has given me will come to me
[11:16] and none of them is lost but Judas
[11:20] Iscariot that's the scripture might be
[11:22] fulfilled and I raised them up at the
[11:25] last day now you are you said a while
[11:29] ago you were a Christian what made you a
[11:32] Christian because God called you before
[11:35] the foundation of the world to be a
[11:38] Christian and you become a Christian
[11:41] then you got saved filled with the Holy
[11:44] Spirit you got eternal life why did he
[11:47] give you the Holy Ghost as a seal of
[11:50] faith you had faith first you understand
[11:54] me so if you can have faith that God has
[11:58] called you to be bride hallelujah God
[12:02] will one day seal that faith in response
[12:06] to your faith but you must have faith to
[12:10] believe it first because the Bible said
[12:13] without faith isn't impossible it's
[12:16] impossible to please God he's living and
[12:21] the world needs to know he's living the
[12:24] world think he's dead that's why God got
[12:26] you here to declare that he is alive and
[12:30] well hallelujah
[12:32] our duty here is to declare that Jesus
[12:35] Christ is alive and well hallelujah and
[12:39] he's beyond all systems hallelujah
[12:44] because we have been born free Oh
[12:47] somebody help me here see the hour is
[12:50] come for the Living Word amen in you to
[12:55] be active
[12:56] that time you and I supposed to be
[12:59] active again hallelujah amen what God
[13:04] has done for us is not just practice
[13:06] with virtue after virtue of the virtue
[13:08] for us to sit still but God wants that
[13:12] token life to be displayed as we read
[13:15] this morning you are the living epistles
[13:18] of God amen not written with ink God
[13:21] didn't send you to school gave you a
[13:23] letter of Doctor of Divinity or
[13:25] something like that to declare you our
[13:26] doctor do you a great minister of God
[13:28] gay God gave you the Holy Ghost and the
[13:32] Holy Ghost preaches out of you the Holy
[13:34] Ghost lives through you so that others
[13:37] can read and know by your experiment
[13:40] their experience with you by you and
[13:43] hallelujah
[13:44] so is that right they were called
[13:46] Christians at Antioch huh because of the
[13:50] life of Christ that right didn't had no
[13:55] doc didn't have no documents from Rome
[13:58] or Bethlehem or Judy or Jerusalem saying
[14:02] this man is a Christian now his life was
[14:08] a living epistle written and read of all
[14:13] men and brother and said because your
[14:15] name was written that's why it can be
[14:18] read whoa help us Lord see now we see
[14:23] the promises being fulfilled Christ the
[14:26] true headship going in coming in his
[14:30] bride doing the same works that he did
[14:33] at the beginning and make it ready and
[14:37] fulfilling the word as he did at the
[14:39] first hallelujah in John 14:12
[14:44] he that believed in me the words that
[14:47] I'll do he'll do also then the head and
[14:50] the body I'll become one in works and in
[14:53] sign and in life that's the part I like
[14:56] and in life right
[14:59] vindicated by God himself through his
[15:02] promised word for the last day he
[15:05] promised this in the last days now if
[15:08] you're spiritual you
[15:11] see then we can see that the marriage
[15:14] supper is at hand you know I love the
[15:19] Word of God especially when it says
[15:21] every seizure brain full of his kind
[15:24] when a corn seed is planted at harvest
[15:27] time you're not going to get wheat
[15:29] you're going to get corn right and when
[15:33] God seed has been planted in your heart
[15:35] it has been quickened you're not going
[15:37] to get your seed you're gonna get his
[15:39] seed it's going to reflect his life it's
[15:43] going to be the substance of the seed
[15:45] that was planted that will make manifest
[15:47] in your life it is what it is if Jesus
[15:51] is in you you're gonna act like him walk
[15:53] like him talk like him miracles will
[15:55] follow like you is that right it's like
[15:58] if Beethoven is in me I'm gonna learn
[16:00] how to play I'm gonna be able to compose
[16:02] whatever I need to do whatever Beethoven
[16:05] was doing I will do it because the life
[16:08] in me would be declaring that Beethoven
[16:10] is still living that's how our Christian
[16:12] is the life that's in them will declare
[16:15] that Jesus Christ lives it ain't your
[16:19] life anymore that's why we must die and
[16:21] rot he people our God we must understand
[16:24] we cannot miss this mark we cannot
[16:27] afford to miss this opportunity that God
[16:30] has given us and that is to live through
[16:34] us in this wicked Laodicean age we must
[16:38] be different like night and day
[16:41] is that right like white and black it is
[16:44] so such a difference you is visibly seen
[16:48] and that is the kind of life that God
[16:50] wants through us to be reflected a life
[16:53] that is clearly visibly see you
[16:57] understand me he says then we go to see
[17:00] that that the marriage supper is at hand
[17:02] now if I never see you again remember
[17:05] the marriage suffer is at hand then the
[17:09] kingdom according to the promises is
[17:11] ready to be issued in the great
[17:14] millennium and taking up the church and
[17:16] destroying of the wicked and the world
[17:18] under the sixth seal to be purified by
[17:22] volcanic so take all the
[17:24] corruption and sin in the world and to
[17:26] mold her out again and bring forth a
[17:30] bright new millennial for the age that
[17:32] is to come and you and I must understand
[17:35] that the bride of Jesus Christ must go
[17:37] through the same same kind of process
[17:40] you must go through justification you
[17:42] must go through sanctification you must
[17:45] go through the fire baptism hallelujah
[17:47] why because if you don't have the fog
[17:49] back what does the fire baptism does
[17:51] brother brother said it literally burned
[17:54] out all of the demonic power
[17:56] so once the demons are gone Christ can
[17:59] come in hallelujah and as the world the
[18:03] world must do the same thing that's why
[18:05] when Jesus come the first time he comes
[18:07] in the air he cannot step foot on the
[18:11] ground because it has not yet received
[18:13] his fire baptism but once it receives
[18:15] the fire baptism hallelujah and all the
[18:19] demons are gone
[18:20] hallelujah then God can come down and so
[18:23] with a bride of Jesus Christ and the
[18:25] Bible says she and they will walk on the
[18:28] ashes of the wicked Oh somebody help me
[18:32] this is not a hope so this is a no soul
[18:36] hallelujah
[18:37] we shall not die we cannot die
[18:41] hallelujah amen jesus said if you
[18:44] believe on me at the scripture have said
[18:46] you have already passed from death unto
[18:49] life there's a birth took place
[18:51] hallelujah and like I said this morning
[18:53] there's nothing like being quickened
[18:56] hallelujah
[18:57] show me some signs right you say I'm
[19:00] pregnant
[19:01] let's see some signs hallelujah let's
[19:03] see some kickin of the Holy Ghost y'all
[19:06] know who say Amen amen amen
[19:09] see hallelujah oh and when we see all
[19:15] these great 3fo revelation God in Christ
[19:18] God in the church the kingdom coming
[19:21] Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden
[19:24] of Eden in the representation of Christ
[19:26] in his bride then the kingdom is going
[19:29] to be restored according to his promise
[19:31] did you understand me when God restored
[19:34] the bride of Jesus Christ back to the
[19:37] position that
[19:37] Adam and II was in before the fall
[19:40] brother BAM said when those seals were
[19:42] open it meant it restored her back the
[19:46] bride is back into place
[19:47] Amen where Adam and Eve was in control
[19:50] huh that's right before the fall they
[19:53] were in control he said whenever Adam
[19:56] wanted to change something all they had
[19:58] to do was what speak it that was his
[20:00] work speaking it hallelujah making it
[20:03] happen by way of the word and he said
[20:05] when these things take place amen and
[20:07] the kingdom is going to be restored
[20:09] according to his promise he says praise
[20:11] be to God now by the revelation of the
[20:14] threefold ministry mystery the secret
[20:16] and by the personal vindicated word by
[20:20] his original headship right in other
[20:23] words she's not doing nothing but being
[20:27] obedient to the head
[20:29] it's his headship he's the head he's
[20:34] telling us what to do we're moving
[20:36] according to his will is that right and
[20:40] the bride will do nothing except she
[20:42] here thus saith alone right that's how
[20:45] she moves amen Adam takes his position
[20:48] Eve takes her position and the devil is
[20:51] shut out right hallelujah because it's
[20:54] Christ in them Christ in the bride of
[20:58] Jesus Christ hallelujah ruling over the
[21:02] devil's Eden now say well glory to God
[21:08] we shout hallelujah we sing that that's
[21:11] ain't it I'm a missionary I've been
[21:13] seven times practically over the world
[21:15] seat and I've seen healers devils and
[21:18] everything else
[21:18] dance and shout I've seen all kinds of
[21:21] fleshly minimizations that's carnal but
[21:23] I'm taking talking about the headship of
[21:26] Christ notice being personally
[21:29] identified by the original headship we
[21:32] have the answer to the devil's question
[21:35] Amen glory we have the answer to the
[21:38] devil's question
[21:39] he's Christ is risen and has paid the
[21:43] price and risen up the head or the body
[21:46] see the devil can't stand it you see
[21:49] what I'm saying that's why the devil
[21:50] fights
[21:51] he can't stand it the fact that God has
[21:55] chosen such nobodies as we wit work
[21:58] you're a scum of the earth hallelujah
[22:00] people that made mistakes all the time
[22:02] hallelujah the trash Harlen God took the
[22:07] little bitty stuff and made something
[22:09] great out of it he can't because what
[22:12] Lucifer thought was great wasn't nothing
[22:15] he ruined his whole kingdom for
[22:18] something that was nothing
[22:19] he had everything and didn't know he had
[22:22] it you understand me now he could never
[22:25] get it back but he made us fall and we
[22:29] lost everything and then Jesus come back
[22:33] and pop pay the price redeems it we get
[22:37] it all back hallelujah hey we did it all
[22:40] back we can't get more than we bargained
[22:42] for we get heaven cross interest he
[22:49] can't understand it but you see it's the
[22:52] world living we only live because the
[22:55] world is living and they're making sense
[22:58] we only live because the world is living
[23:01] and when the learnt world lives through
[23:04] us it makes itself manifest that's the
[23:07] glory of God do you understand this we
[23:10] have been born in the glory of God
[23:13] hallelujah Lord I would they have the
[23:16] same glory that I had with you from the
[23:20] beginning and he did this right now we
[23:23] living by the blood of Jesus Christ is
[23:26] his glory the understand he is his glory
[23:29] is his victory over the devil his is his
[23:33] proof that he conquered death hell and
[23:35] the grave hallelujah is proof hallelujah
[23:42] hallelujah Oh glory to God hallelujah oh
[23:48] my god hallelujah is proof hallelujah Oh
[23:55] glory
[23:56] oh he conquered death hell and the grave
[24:01] that's why it's so important that we
[24:05] to the Holy Spirit to let him prove to
[24:08] the world to the demonic power Amen that
[24:12] the blood has never lost his power it
[24:16] will never lose his power hallelujah
[24:18] Christ is risen and has paid the price
[24:22] for our Redemption what God and Christ
[24:24] manifested he gave the flesh that in
[24:28] blood that in the blood might come the
[24:31] lie come to life and the flesh be
[24:34] redeemed that God in the in his redeemed
[24:37] flesh could manifest a word for the day
[24:40] as he did in the day whoo
[24:43] what glory he says serum saying that God
[24:47] Christ could live in a redeemed
[24:52] flesh that's me to you that's you and I
[24:55] Amen redeemed flash showing that the
[24:58] power of God was able to live in this
[25:01] damnable flesh only because it's been
[25:05] redeemed whoo blood washed hallelujah
[25:09] think about it the same Christ in us
[25:12] working the same works that he did when
[25:15] he was on earth in his own body then we
[25:18] stand justified in the presence of God
[25:21] as a drop of ink dropping into a tub of
[25:23] full bleach you never find the stain of
[25:26] the eat no more it went somewhere it
[25:30] never come back again
[25:31] see that's what the devil don't want us
[25:33] to see we he don't want us to see the
[25:35] process of what God did when he redeemed
[25:38] us he wants us to see these little dots
[25:40] in these spots and these wrinkles and he
[25:42] said there is no such thing once you've
[25:45] been redeemed when God has redeemed you
[25:48] he redeemed you fully the ones that God
[25:51] is able to save us to the uttermost not
[25:55] be almost the uttermost Oh somebody help
[25:59] me here yeah we fight with this flesh
[26:02] but God has already said of the question
[26:04] he condemned sin in the flesh God is
[26:07] looking at the inner man right now he's
[26:09] going to change this whole flash this
[26:12] whole flash is already condemned but the
[26:14] inner man is what he's looking at
[26:16] he impulses we're going
[26:18] growing in Christ we're moving from
[26:20] glory to glory to go to glory hallelujah
[26:24] common seven steps hallelujah whoa one
[26:28] day God is gonna crown us with the
[26:30] eighth hallelujah
[26:31] Oh glory to God hallelujah is that right
[26:36] brother BAM talked about the King's
[26:37] Chamber he said did you notice in the
[26:40] pyramid where the King Chamber is is
[26:41] where it is hallelujah he said the
[26:44] several steps hallelujah that's where
[26:46] the King Chamber is in the Great Pyramid
[26:49] hallelujah I've been there hotter here
[26:52] the Lord of God and I want you to
[26:53] understand it meant God knew exactly
[26:55] what he was doing because once you
[26:57] finish the King's Chamber
[26:59] there's no one no place else to go but
[27:01] up hallelujah in Christ is that Alright
[27:06] in Christ alone hallelujah amen is my
[27:10] glory is that right oh my listen he said
[27:14] the blood of Jesus Christ and it's never
[27:16] to be remember God forgets it and he
[27:20] stands as a son and daughter of God in
[27:22] the presence of God God forgets it every
[27:26] bit of sin every bit of thought
[27:28] everything that wasn't right God forgets
[27:31] it now the problem is we think that God
[27:34] every time we sin God go and take a
[27:36] little bit of blood and cleanse it the
[27:38] Bible tells us that once and for all
[27:42] once and for all because with God there
[27:46] is no time so from this point to that
[27:49] point he hallelujah cleansed it hardly
[27:52] why cuz he knew you was going to say
[27:54] Father forgive me he understood that she
[27:57] was going to say Lord I don't want to do
[27:58] it he couldn't understand that you gonna
[28:01] repent to say God cleanse me did you
[28:03] know that he cleansed the whole thing
[28:05] and that's why he said
[28:07] see that's why I justified you I
[28:09] justified you as though you've never
[28:11] done it in the first place see cuz he
[28:14] knows the heart why he knows that he's
[28:17] in your heart see one thing for certain
[28:21] that he did eat messed up because she
[28:23] wanted a greater life by living right so
[28:28] God does the opposite in order to live
[28:31] you must die
[28:33] but she thought she's gonna have low
[28:35] life an abundant life but you can't have
[28:38] abundant life not in this life not by
[28:41] way of what even Adam did you can have a
[28:44] mansion you have to mansion you can own
[28:46] an island but you're gonna die
[28:48] everything you work for is comparing but
[28:51] with Christ when you die he said set
[28:55] your affection on things above right he
[28:58] said there is a treasure lay up your
[29:01] treasure we're in heaven and you and I
[29:04] have no idea what's in the treasure
[29:06] house we have no idea

[29:18] himself to his promise in this day

[29:37] dead no he's living in me that's the
[29:41] devil's answer he's living in you

[31:58] them never got him bombed you take the
[32:01] blood out of the man he's gone then the
[32:04] only thing you do is put another blood

[32:27] brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ the
[32:29] love of God which is Jesus Christ
[32:32] he's the head and controls you your feet
[32:36] is the foundation say Amen controlled by
[32:41] the head there you are there is the
[32:43] perfect man of God when he possessed
[32:46] these virtues in other words you
[32:49] literally become Jesus Christ again
[32:52] manifested in the flesh he you is him
[32:57] you did he manifests himself in your
[33:00] life then God representing his church as
[33:04] a bride a woman God presents his church
[33:07] as a bride and the way he brings each
[33:09] individual to being his son to go in the
[33:12] bride he also has brought the bride
[33:16] through these ages till he brings this
[33:22] one complete into this he said brother
[33:25] branham taps on the chalkboard seven
[33:27] times know what he's working out those
[33:31] virtues my feet move why because my hair
[33:35] say so now it can't move like my hand
[33:38] because it's my feet Luther can't do the
[33:40] things that we did neither can the
[33:43] Methodists because they were something
[33:45] else see the feet moves because their
[33:47] hand also so since so and the hair never
[33:50] says now feet
[33:51] you become hand here you become a eyes
[33:54] but each age God has placed these things
[33:58] in his church and pattern it by showing
[34:01] that each individual has these possesses
[34:05] these qualities and this being when it's
[34:09] completed is the Church of God going in
[34:12] the rapture when it is completed it is
[34:17] the Church of God going in the rapture
[34:20] and this being and completed is a
[34:25] servant of God in the Church of God
[34:27] that's going in the rapture glory see
[34:31] what I mean there you are there's the
[34:34] full thing the divine nature of Christ
[34:38] God in you coming into a full statue of
[34:43] Christ now brother branham preach that I
[34:45] didn't hallelujah
[34:48] Matthew 5:48 says bees therefore perfect
[34:52] even as your father which is in heaven
[34:54] is perfect
[34:55] oh how you gonna be perfect there must
[34:59] be a way the only way that you can be
[35:01] perfect is the perfect God being you
[35:03] hallelujah the bride will have to be
[35:07] unadulterated word
[35:09] not one word missing
[35:11] no we're certainly could you imagine a
[35:14] correct bride one breasts off in the
[35:17] other one something another wrong you
[35:20] know that's not going to be the Bride of
[35:23] Christ she is perfect she is everything
[35:26] the word not one word failing anywhere
[35:31] no you understand me he said that's the
[35:35] bride those verses I see that's what I'm
[35:40] trying to tell we have been fighting and
[35:42] carrying on about this message for years
[35:44] been missing the very most important
[35:47] thing ever and that is to come into a
[35:50] full statute that's why we don't see him
[35:52] on display like it should because God
[35:54] can't use us incomplete it must be a
[35:59] completion and you and I must die hey
[36:02] you said what brother I can't do it yes
[36:04] sir you got the right beginning you
[36:07] cannot do it it's God in you doing it
[36:10] but he's looking for you to say Lord not
[36:13] my will but thine be done
[36:15] Jesus couldn't have made cavalry on his
[36:18] own not as a man he had to surrender his
[36:21] will to God the Father and so is so good
[36:26] for this hour in order to defeat the
[36:28] devil you and I must surrender our will
[36:32] to God under whatever circumstances
[36:36] remember Jesus Christ knew the kind of
[36:39] pain he was going to have to experience
[36:41] he already helped weighed the balance he
[36:44] already looked at the fight the battle
[36:46] and everything else and the Bible said
[36:48] he set him his face like a flint he
[36:51] wasn't going to look to the left nor the
[36:53] right in other words he wasn't gonna
[36:55] allow his mind to reason he was going to
[36:58] stay right with the Word of God no
[37:00] reasoning no matter how much pain I must
[37:03] go through no matter how much suffering
[37:05] I go through bring it all Lord Jesus
[37:07] will bring on the perfection let your
[37:11] life be glorified in me and that must be
[37:14] our way of thinking
[37:18] trust in the Lord imma go back to that
[37:20] with all your heart lean not to your own
[37:24] understand
[37:24] see a lot of time the devil make us that
[37:27] we are so bad we can't that's the worst
[37:29] thing we could think you so bad you can
[37:32] never change look how long you've been
[37:33] dealing with this name hallelujah pay
[37:37] for him waited twenty five years and the
[37:39] whole time he waited for for Sarah to
[37:42] have a baby she was getting older he was
[37:45] getting older got so so old
[37:47] Abraham couldn't do nothing huh you
[37:51] understand me God love the
[37:53] impossibilities he loves to take that
[37:56] which seemed impossible and make it
[37:59] possible he loved people to trust him in
[38:02] such a time when everything seems
[38:05] impossible the doctor says it can't be
[38:07] happening
[38:08] Amen you can't brother mom said this
[38:10] message we're moving to a position where
[38:13] lives will be restored I believe that
[38:17] that's right under the six ceilings and
[38:19] lives will be restored I believe that he
[38:24] is the creator and once the Creator
[38:27] finds his place on your throne in your
[38:30] heart he's able to move you the way he
[38:32] wants you to move he don't have to worry
[38:34] about man glorifying themselves when he
[38:37] can get you the way he wants you he can
[38:40] trust you and me he can do it he'll do
[38:43] it he gives us the victory hallelujah
[38:50] you don't earn nothing God gives it
[38:53] that's what Paul said thanks be to God
[38:55] who gives us the victory through our
[38:58] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he gives
[39:01] you the victory take your victory take
[39:04] your victory take your victory he's
[39:08] giving it to you
[39:09] take it you don't have to feel it you

[39:14] you Jesus
[39:15] take your Jesus thank you for the
[39:17] victory you don't know how to meet you
[39:20] don't need to know how he's gonna do it
[39:21] thank you for the victory you don't need
[39:24] to know the process of which he's gonna
[39:26] do it thank you for the victory you just
[39:29] thanked him for it and gotta bring in
[39:31] the past here he'll bring the past every
[39:34] time hallelujah I have nothing else I
[39:37] can't
[39:38] nothing else I can't trust nobody I
[39:40] can't trust me
[39:41] I can't trace my mind I can't trust
[39:44] nothing about me I only trust him
[39:47] hallelujah he is my salvation hallelujah
[39:52] the property God says I've always
[39:53] preached that he was deity not just a
[39:57] man he was God manifested in the flesh
[39:59] God the attribute of God of love the
[40:03] great attribute that come down displayed
[40:06] here on earth of God Jesus was God's
[40:08] love which built a body that Jehovah
[40:11] himself lived in he was the fullness of
[40:14] the Godhead bodily what God was he
[40:16] manifested through that body that body
[40:19] had to die so he could wash the bride
[40:22] with his blood and notice not only as
[40:25] his bride washed forgiven but she is
[40:28] justified see did you ever try the word
[40:31] justified to see what it means now for
[40:34] instance if brother green heard that he
[40:37] had been drinking I've been doing bad
[40:41] things then he found out that I didn't
[40:43] do it then he come and say I forgive you
[40:46] brother you forgive me I never done it
[40:49] what you forgive me about see but if I'm
[40:52] guilty then I can be forgiven but I'm
[40:55] still not just because I did it but the
[40:58] word justify is though you never done it
[41:01] at all justified and then the blood of
[41:05] Jesus Christ cleanses us so from sin
[41:07] till it puts in the book of the
[41:10] hallelujah God's forgiveness he's the
[41:14] only one can do it we can't we can't
[41:18] forgive but not forget I could forgive
[41:21] you but I've always remember you've done
[41:23] these evil things then you're not just
[41:25] you're forgiven but in the sight of God
[41:28] the bride is justified she'd never done
[41:32] it in the first place a man standing
[41:35] there married to the virtuous son of God
[41:37] never sinned in this first place it has
[41:40] to be that way otherwise we would never
[41:42] be compatible we could never join to him
[41:45] if we ever had a sin even though we were
[41:48] forgiven it has to be
[41:50] a justification as though we've never
[41:52] done it in the first place
[41:54] to be equal with God whoa be careful
[41:59] brother Brooks that's what he said
[42:02] hallelujah think it not strange when the
[42:05] divers temptation try you it's just a
[42:07] trying of your faith hallelujah amen
[42:11] that's right
[42:13] the Bible also said don't you even think
[42:14] it you know that I said let this mind be
[42:18] in you that was also in Christ Jesus who
[42:21] what you thought it not robbery to be
[42:25] equal with God hallelujah don't think
[42:28] you robbing God there's only one God and
[42:31] you giving him liberty to live in your
[42:33] body hallelujah
[42:35] so when he lives in your body he's still
[42:38] the same God so you become equal it's
[42:43] not you the flesh is Christ in you
[42:45] that's equal think it not robbery no no
[42:48] no he is doing this it's the way God has
[42:52] done it Hollywood Jesus their mercy amen
[42:56] what amen standing there married to the
[43:00] virtuous son of God never seen in the
[43:02] first place why she was read for
[43:04] ordained oh I love that she was trapped
[43:06] into this and now when she heard the
[43:09] truth and come forth the blood cleanse
[43:11] her and she stands there virtuous - see
[43:14] she knows no sin in on her at all
[43:18] therefore the message call calls the
[43:21] bride together see and the trumpet
[43:23] listen see the same one he with a loud
[43:26] voice he screamed out with the shout and

[44:08] word is doing what he's doing with us

[44:13] the sound of the trumpet and when it
[44:15] does it cause always a trumpet calls
[44:18] Israel to the feast of the trumpets II

[46:43] sadder and sadder and said no we
[46:45] supposed to be seeing a greater Jesus a
[46:48] greater christ coming through us as we
[46:51] mature as we were growing Christ it's
[46:53] supposed to be more and more and more
[46:55] that's right Paul says I'm I'm living
[46:58] from glory to glory to glory see not my
[47:02] glory his glory I'm just a witness of

[47:50] you had you had Thomas who doubted you
[47:55] had you know Luke who was an
[47:57] intellectual you had differences in all
[48:00] those men and don't you know why God did
[48:02] that because he knew that there in his
[48:04] bride he was gonna have all of that and
[48:07] there was always somebody to say I made

[48:21] Oh hallelujah
[48:27] we can turn the Corinthians we gonna go
[48:29] into our communion service
[48:49] we're gonna read from first Corinthians
[48:52] the 11th chapter beginning at the 23rd
[48:55] verse what sorry for I have received of
[49:02] the Lord that which also I delivered
[49:04] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[49:08] night in which he was betrayed took
[49:09] bread and when he had given thanks he
[49:13] brake it and said take eat this is my
[49:15] body which is broken for you this do in
[49:19] remembrance of me after the same manner
[49:26] also he took the cup and when he had
[49:31] supped saying this is the New Testament
[49:35] in my blood this do ye as often as you
[49:38] drink it and remember some well as often
[49:42] as you eat this bread and drink this cup
[49:44] ye do show the Lord's death till he
[49:47] comes so then who so ever
[49:56] who ever eat I'm sorry
[50:00] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[50:02] and drink this cup of the Lord
[50:06] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[50:08] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[50:11] examine himself and so let him eat of
[50:14] that bread and drink of that Cup
[50:18] for he that eateth and drinketh
[50:20] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[50:22] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[50:25] body for this cause meaning a weak and
[50:29] sickly among you and many sleep well if
[50:34] we would judge ourselves we should not
[50:36] be judged but when we are judged we are
[50:40] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[50:43] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[50:47] brethren when you come together to eat
[50:49] tarry any man hunger
[50:53] let him eat at home that you come not
