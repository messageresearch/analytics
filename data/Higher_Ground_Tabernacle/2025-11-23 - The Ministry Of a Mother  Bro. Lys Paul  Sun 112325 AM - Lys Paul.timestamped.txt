[33:12] shame that only cause me grief and pain.
[33:17] [singing]
[33:19] But I tried
[33:21] so hard to be free.
[33:28] I was searching for my true identity.
[33:33] I didn't [music] know what came from
[33:36] eternity [singing]
[33:38] until God came and [music] revealed it
[33:42] to me.
[33:47] On the [music] wings of a [singing] snow
[33:49] white dove,
[33:52] God sent [music] his pure sweet
[33:54] [singing]
[33:55] love.
[33:56] On the wings of a snow white dove to
[34:01] take his eagles home.
[34:05] On the wings of a snow white dove.
[34:10] Lord sent his pure [music and singing]
[34:12] sweet love. On the wings of a snow white
[34:17] dove to take his eos. [music]
[34:22] I knew somehow [singing]
[34:24] I was born [music] to fly way up in the
[34:30] sky. But somehow I just couldn't set my
[34:35] [music] wings free.
[34:40] But since [music] that day I [singing]
[34:42] heard his voice and made him [music] my
[34:47] heavenly choice. [singing]
[34:49] By his grace, I can say I've been set
[34:53] free.
[34:58] On the wings of a snow [music]
[35:00] white [singing] dove,
[35:02] God sent his pure sweet love. On the
[35:07] wings of a [music and singing] snow
[35:09] white dove to take his eagles home.
[35:15] On [singing and music] the wings of a
[35:17] snow white dove, God sent his pure sweet
[35:22] love.
[35:24] On [music] the wings of [singing] a snow
[35:26] white dove to take his eagles home. Now
[35:31] I'm free.
[35:34] [music]
[35:36] So free.
[35:40] I'm so free. [music]
[35:45] He'll take his eos home. Now I'm free.
[35:50] [music]
[35:53] So free.
[35:56] [music] I'm so free.
[36:02] He'll take his eagles home.
[36:06] On the [music and singing] wings of a
[36:08] snow white dove, God sent his pure sweet
[36:14] love. On the wings of a snow [music]
[36:17] white dove, he'll take his eagles home.
[36:24] Thank you.
[36:28] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's
[36:32] sing this song as we get ready to Amen.
[36:36] in a sweet by and by. Amen.
[36:39] Praise the Lord.
[36:42] There's a land that is fairer than day.
[36:49] And by faith we can see a fall.
[36:56] Oh, the father waits over the way.
[37:02] to prepare us a dwelling place there.

[37:12] by and by
[37:15] we shall meet [music] on that beautiful
[37:19] show.

[37:32] shore. In the sweet. Oh, [music] in the
[37:36] sweet.
[37:38] By and by glory
[37:41] we shall meet on that beautiful shore.
[37:47] Oh, in the sweet [music]
[37:51] by and by.
[37:54] We shall be on that beautiful shore.
[38:00] Oh, we shall sing on that beautiful
[38:04] shore.
[38:07] The melodious
[38:09] songs of the land.
[38:13] And [music] the spirit shall shall grow
[38:17] no more.
[38:19] Not a sign for [singing and music] the
[38:22] blessing of bread.
[38:25] Oh, in the sweet
[38:29] fly by and by.
[38:32] We shall meet on [music and singing]
[38:34] that beautiful shore.
[38:38] Oh, in the sweet [music]
[38:42] by and by
[38:44] the way we shall meet
[38:47] beautiful.
[38:51] Oh to our bounty [music]
[38:53] father above.
[38:58] We will offer our tribute of praise
[39:04] for the [singing] glorious
[39:06] gift of his love. Amen.
[39:10] And the blessings that hallow [music]
[39:14] our day.
[39:16] Oh, and the sweet hallelujah.
[39:20] By and by, praise the Lord. We shall
[39:23] meet on that beautiful door.
[39:29] Oh, in the sweet
[39:32] by and by
[39:35] we shall meet on that beautiful shore.
[39:41] Oh, there's a lamb that is fairer than
[39:45] day.
[39:48] And by [music and singing] faith we
[39:50] shall see it afall.
[39:54] For the Father waits over the [music]
[39:58] way
[40:00] to prepare us a dwelling plate.
[40:06] Oh, in the sweet.
[40:10] By and by,
[40:13] we shall meet [music] on that beautiful
[40:17] shore.
[40:19] Oh, in the sweet.
[40:22] By and by,
[40:25] we shall be on that beautiful sh by and
[40:30] by. [music]
[40:32] Go by and by
[40:35] when the morning comes, when all the
[40:40] saints of God have gathered home,
[40:43] [music] oh, we will tell the story of
[40:48] how we overcome. For we'll understand it
[40:52] better by and by. Amen. By and by, oh by
[40:58] and by,
[41:00] when the morning comes, when all the
[41:05] saints of God have gathered home, oh, we
[41:09] [music] will tell the story
[41:12] how we overcome.
[41:15] Oh, we'll [music] understand it better
[41:18] by and by.
[41:21] Oh, we are often tossed and driven on
[41:24] this restless sea of time. Somber skies
[41:28] and howling tempest hops exceed a bright
[41:32] sunshine. In that land of perfect days,
[41:36] when the mist has rolled away, we will
[41:40] understand it better. By and [singing]
[41:43] by, amen. Yes, Lord. Oh, by and by.
[41:49] When the morning comes, when all the
[41:54] saints of God have gathered [music]
[41:57] home. Oh, we will tell the story
[42:01] how we overcome. Oh, we'll understand
[42:05] [music]
[42:05] it better by and by.
[42:10] Trials dark on every hand. And we cannot
[42:14] understand all the ways that God would
[42:18] [music and singing] lead us to that
[42:19] blessed promised land. But he [music]
[42:22] guides us with his eyes and we'll follow
[42:26] till we die. For we'll understand it
[42:30] better by and by.
[42:33] Amen. Go by and by [music]
[42:38] when the morning comes, when all the
[42:42] saints of
[42:46] Oh, we will tell the story
[42:50] how we overcome.
[42:53] Oh, we'll understand [music]
[42:54] it better by and by.
[42:59] Temptations hidden [music and singing]
[43:00] snares often take us unaware.
[43:05] And our hearts are made to bleed. For
[43:08] many thoughtless word or deed, and we
[43:11] wonder [music] why the test is when we
[43:14] try to do our best, but we'll [music]
[43:18] understand it better by and by. Amen,
[43:22] Lord. Oh, by and by.
[43:27] When the morning comes, when all the
[43:31] saints of God have gathered,
[43:35] we will tell the story.
[43:39] How we [music] overcome,
[43:41] how we understand it better by and by.
[43:46] Go by and [singing] by
[43:49] and by. When the morning comes, when
[43:54] [music] all the saints of God are
[43:58] gathered home, we will tell [singing]
[44:01] the story.
[44:03] I will overcome
[44:06] and we'll [music] understand [singing]
[44:08] it better by and by.
[44:12] Amen. God bless you.
[44:15] God bless y'all.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. By and by we'll tell the story how
[44:20] we overcome. You know, you got to have a
[44:22] story to tell. But your story is only
[44:25] that we overcame by the blood of Jesus
[44:27] Christ.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I greet you all in the name of
[44:31] Jesus Christ.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our head.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus,
[44:38] &gt;&gt; we come before you Lord this morning in
[44:40] the name of Jesus.
[44:43] Heavenly Father, Lord, it gives us such
[44:45] an such an assurance to know that when
[44:47] we come in the name of Jesus Christ
[44:52] that you will hear our prayers.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father Lord, there's not a name
[44:57] that excites you like the name of Jesus
[44:58] Christ.
[45:01] That's why heavenly father lord we love
[45:03] thy name.
[45:06] By thy name we have healing.
[45:09] By thy name we have salvation.
[45:11] By by the name we have everything that
[45:13] we need.
[45:16] Lord, heavenly father, Lord, your
[45:17] children coming came into your house
[45:18] this morning
[45:21] needs Lord Jesus. But father Lord in the
[45:24] name of Jesus Christ.
[45:26] I pray heavenly father Lord that you
[45:28] provide to their needs Lord Jesus.
[45:30] I pray that you forgive our iniquities
[45:32] Lord Jes.
[45:34] And heavenly father Lord I thank you for
[45:36] being here among us this morning.
[45:40] I thank you for the song service.
[45:43] I thank you for the atmosphere that's
[45:45] been set, Lord Jesus. I thank you for
[45:47] all the special songs.
[45:51] And I pray, Father Lord, that Father
[45:52] Lord, you just now come and have your
[45:55] way among us, Lord.
[45:58] I pray, Father Lord, that you speak to
[45:59] your children.
[46:01] Father, as I surrender myself to you,
[46:03] Lord Jesus, I need you every time I
[46:06] preach, Lord. Father Lord, because I
[46:08] don't ever want to preach without you,
[46:10] Lord.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; And I'm sure your children don't want to
[46:13] come hear me, Lord, but they want to
[46:14] hear you, Lord.
[46:17] Heavenly Father, Lord, God, the we don't
[46:19] have any other ministry but to preach
[46:21] the message of the hour to the bride.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, anoint your word.
[46:28] I bind every spirit of unbelief in the
[46:30] name of Jesus Christ.
[46:33] In the name of Jesus Christ I pray.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; And we say amen.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to
[46:47] Proverb chapter 22.
[46:52] I did not write the verse.
[46:55] Verse
[47:02] 6.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; How many happy to be in the house of
[47:06] God?
[47:08] Amen.
[47:11] Proverb chapter 22:6 says, "Train up,
[47:16] &gt;&gt; train up a child, a child in the way he
[47:19] should go, and when he's old, he will
[47:21] not depart from it.
[47:29] Amen. Let's go to Proverb chapter 13
[47:31] verse 24.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "He that spareth his rod
[47:44] hateth his son, but he that loveth him
[47:47] chastise just chastiseth him but be
[47:51] times.
[47:59] And the last scripture, let's turn to
[48:00] second Timothy chapter 1.
[48:27] The second Timoth Tim Timothy chapter 1
[48:29] verse 5 says, "When I called to
[48:33] remembrance the unfeign unfeigned faith
[48:36] that is in thee, which dwelt first in
[48:40] thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother
[48:42] Ununice, and I'm persuaded that in thee
[48:46] also." Amen.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Second Timothy chapter 1:5
[48:52] &gt;&gt; verse one.
[49:18] Amen. Let's bow our head real quick
[49:19] again. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you
[49:21] for the reading of your word.
[49:24] Lord Jesus, I pray that you renounce
[49:26] your word once more
[49:29] and bless the service in the name of
[49:31] Jesus Christ.
[49:33] Amen. Amen. You may have your seats.
[49:41] And it was good to see sister Stephie
[49:42] giving a special
[49:47] and I also love that song.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; You know where would we have been
[49:53] without the message of the hour.
[49:56] I
[49:56] &gt;&gt; I always tell the church always cherish
[49:58] this message.
[50:03] The true believers in the end time will
[50:05] only be found in the message of the
[50:06] hour.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Peter also. And I think who
[50:14] was that? Crystal Crystal.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Good. Good specials. I enjoyed all of
[50:18] the specials.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh my topic for this morning will
[50:23] be
[50:26] u I don't know if I'm qualified to
[50:27] preach about that but I'll just use
[50:31] &gt;&gt; I will use scriptures and the the
[50:33] prophets you know to let you know that
[50:35] it's not coming from me but it's coming
[50:37] from
[50:38] and it's on the ministry of a mother
[50:43] you know the ministry of a mother in a
[50:46] house
[50:47] &gt;&gt; or even in the church
[50:50] because the prophet says that you know
[50:51] we all have a responsibility we all have
[50:53] a parts to play in the body of Christ.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; The prophet even said that the bride
[51:01] will have a ministry
[51:04] you know and the bride each and every
[51:06] one of you has a part to play in that
[51:07] ministry.
[51:10] Some it can be just to even be a
[51:12] minister
[51:14] some it can be to be a father to be a
[51:16] mother.
[51:18] But for today, we're going to uh focus
[51:20] on the mother part. And we pray that God
[51:23] gives you to preach about that.
[51:27] So the first scripture that we read is
[51:29] Proverb chapter 22.
[51:32] It says, "Train up a child in the way
[51:34] that he should go.
[51:40] And when he is old, he will not depart
[51:44] from it." You know the Bible tells us
[51:46] that every scripture has been given to
[51:48] us for educ edification.
[51:53] No there's not the the Bible says the
[51:55] word of God will never return void but
[51:57] it will accomplish the purpose for which
[51:58] he was sent.
[52:02] So if God allowed these scriptures to be
[52:05] here, it's for a purpose
[52:09] and the purpose is to tell to teach the
[52:11] parents that you need to train your
[52:13] child when they are growing.
[52:22] No. And when we go to second Timothy
[52:24] chapter 1 to5,
[52:30] no, I'll skip that one. I'll get to
[52:31] there later later. So, you know, the
[52:33] prophet talks about that God has certain
[52:35] laws that he abides with.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; You know, in nature, there are a lot of
[52:43] laws that, you know, it doesn't matter
[52:45] if you're a Christian, you're not a
[52:46] Christian. It's the law that God has
[52:47] established. And if you follow that law,
[52:49] it's going to produce the law.
[52:56] You know, in the message, the
[52:57] everpresent water from the rock, the
[52:59] prophet says in paragraph 145,
[53:06] &gt;&gt; he says, you see what does the tree,
[53:07] what intelligence runs that down? It's a
[53:10] law.
[53:15] It's a law that God had set in order.
[53:19] And that law is God's law that will take
[53:21] care of the subject.
[53:24] He says, you know, I don't care how much
[53:26] you cry out.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; And you say it ain't going to the sun
[53:30] ain't going to shine no more this
[53:32] summer.
[53:36] It will shine anyhow.
[53:39] How much you're going to say, I I'm not
[53:41] going I am going to let nighttime come.
[53:47] It will come anyhow
[53:49] because this thing that we live on
[53:51] called the world
[53:54] &gt;&gt; is controlled by a law of God.
[53:58] You know, so you cannot come and say I
[54:00] don't want the summer to shine in the
[54:01] summer anymore.
[54:04] The prophet says he's still going to
[54:06] shine because there is a law that God
[54:08] had set in order that in the summer the
[54:10] sun is going to shine.
[54:15] And then there are let's look at other
[54:16] other laws of God.
[54:19] There's a law that says you reap what
[54:21] you sow.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; You know it doesn't matter who you are.
[54:26] But whatever you do, you know that you
[54:28] there there are consequences for every
[54:29] action that you do.
[54:34] It didn't matter even that you are the
[54:37] prophet of the hour versus just a person
[54:39] sitting here this morning.
[54:43] Look at example of brother Brham.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; He obeyed to his mother-in-law instead
[54:48] of obeying God's leadership.
[54:52] And what happened to him? He had to reap
[54:54] for that.
[54:57] You know, he lost his his wife and his
[54:59] baby.
[55:01] And then there is there is another law
[55:03] also that says that if you pour water on
[55:05] a seed
[55:09] and you expose the seed to the sun, to
[55:11] expose it will have to grow.
[55:15] It doesn't matter if it's a bad seed or
[55:16] a good seed,
[55:18] it is still going to grow.
[55:21] There is another law again, the law, the
[55:23] law of paying your tithing.
[55:26] It doesn't matter if you are a Christian
[55:28] or not a Christian,
[55:31] but there's a certain law that if you
[55:32] just pay your tithing,
[55:35] God is going to bless you. You know,
[55:38] that's I believe that's Malachi chapter
[55:40] 3.
[55:41] that says try me, you know, and see if
[55:43] I'm not going to open all the banks, the
[55:46] the doors of heaven, the blessings.
[55:48] So, you see, I I I was uh reading this
[55:51] one man, his name is Denzel Washington.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; He's a millionaire. He's an actor. But
[55:58] he also advises people always pay your
[56:00] tithing.
[56:02] You know, that's something that those
[56:03] people out there, they have understood.
[56:06] That's why they do a lot of charity
[56:08] works as well is because they understand
[56:10] that there are certain laws that the
[56:12] more you give, God is going to bless
[56:14] you.
[56:17] So there are certain laws that God has
[56:19] placed
[56:22] and there is also another law that he
[56:23] has placed us in the family
[56:27] that the law is that children are to
[56:29] come through the mom.
[56:32] The law of God is that a family a family
[56:35] is composed of a father, mother and the
[56:37] children.
[56:41] It doesn't matter even in animals we see
[56:42] that they all the the dad, mom and the
[56:44] children.
[56:48] It's the law of God for the family.
[56:52] Everybody has to go through that law.
[56:55] But we see that the devil comes to
[56:57] pervert it.
[56:59] Now he's trying to tell you that let's
[57:01] because the prophet says that Satan
[57:02] cannot create but he only perverts what
[57:04] was good.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; So now Satan comes in the family he's
[57:09] like let me disrupt things.
[57:13] Then he introduces homosexuality
[57:18] &gt;&gt; and now he want to replace the role of a
[57:20] mother in the house.
[57:22] Now he's telling people you can't just
[57:25] have father father and adopt kids.
[57:31] But you cannot replace the what God has
[57:33] created.
[57:35] He's only trying to pervert it.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; So we'll focus on that aspect, you know,
[57:42] the life of a family in the church. the
[57:44] role of a mother. No, because we know
[57:47] the Paul tells us that mothers are not
[57:49] to preach to I mean women shouldn't get
[57:52] in the pulpit and preach.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; And many times we always barely even
[57:57] talk about women. And when we talk about
[57:59] women, we don't really say good things
[58:01] about them,
[58:05] you know, as if they're just this little
[58:06] thing that's just nothing.
[58:09] But you have a precious value in the
[58:11] sight of God.
[58:13] precious value to the points that even
[58:15] Jesus needed to have a mother.
[58:19] God could have just brought Jesus just
[58:21] to be born and not have a mother.
[58:25] But you remember the prophecies that God
[58:26] always abides by his law.
[58:29] So then Jesus needed to be brought under
[58:32] Mary and Joseph.
[58:36] And I even read a place in the Bible
[58:38] where the Bible says that Jesus was
[58:40] obedient to his parents.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Imagine being God the Father, but he
[58:46] still has to be obedient to his earthly.
[58:52] Why? Because the prophet says that, you
[58:53] know, it's in the message leadership.
[58:57] The prophet says that there's always
[58:58] that one person that's going to lead you
[59:00] towards your first step in life.
[59:04] He said that when you are first born,
[59:05] it's the mother that shows you how to
[59:07] walk,
[59:11] &gt;&gt; you know, and then she passes you down
[59:12] to the teacher at school.
[59:16] So So you have a role to play.
[59:18] You are not just to just to bear
[59:21] children and and just please your
[59:23] husband
[59:25] or just to be beautiful in the church or
[59:27] in the community, but you are more than
[59:30] that.
[59:32] The prophet even says that mother's day
[59:34] shouldn't just be one day. It should be
[59:35] an everyday thing
[59:39] because the prophet says that a mother
[59:41] is the backbone of any nation.
[59:47] A mother is a if the mother is the
[59:49] backbone of a nation, then she's the m
[59:50] she's the backbone of a church.
[59:54] So if you want if a nation cannot be
[59:57] strong if they don't have strong
[59:58] mothers.
[1:00:00] That's what the backbone of a nation
[1:00:02] means.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; The prophet says the US fell because
[1:00:05] Satan came through the the wife, the
[1:00:08] mothers.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; The uh
[1:00:24] so the prophet in the Bible says in
[1:00:26] Ephesians chapter 6 1-3
[1:00:30] He says, "Children, obey your parents in
[1:00:32] the Lord for this is right."
[1:00:35] That's another law again, you know,
[1:00:38] children obey your parents in the Lord
[1:00:41] for this is right.
[1:00:44] You know, this is about mothers, but
[1:00:45] it's also about children
[1:00:47] and it's also about husband because it's
[1:00:50] about valuing your mothers.
[1:00:54] Value your wife not just as a wife, but
[1:00:55] as a mother.
[1:00:57] I don't qualify to talk about wives. At
[1:01:00] least, you know, we I've had I've had a
[1:01:02] mother.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; You have had a mother. There's not
[1:01:04] anybody here without any mothers.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; So, we need to to start learning to
[1:01:09] value our mothers.
[1:01:12] Children, obey your parents in the Lord,
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; for this is right.
[1:01:18] Honor thy father and mother,
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; which is the first commandment with
[1:01:23] promise,
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; that he may be well with thee, and thou
[1:01:28] mayest live long on the earth.
[1:01:32] So there's another law that if you want
[1:01:34] to live longer on this planet,
[1:01:38] it doesn't matter if you are a Christian
[1:01:40] or if not a Christian.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; There is a law that you just have to
[1:01:45] obey your parents.
[1:01:48] You know that's what the Old Testament
[1:01:50] says. But now Paul comes and and shrinks
[1:01:53] it to not just obey your parents
[1:01:56] but obey them in the Lord.
[1:02:00] So if your if your parents want to do
[1:02:03] make want to push you to do something
[1:02:05] that's against the word
[1:02:10] then you don't do that.
[1:02:12] As long as it's in the Lord,
[1:02:16] obey your parents, you will live longer.
[1:02:20] If you want to die soon, just be
[1:02:22] disobedient to your parents.
[1:02:24] You know, the prophet also talks about
[1:02:26] this law
[1:02:28] because God stays with his word.
[1:02:33] You know, look, let's look at some
[1:02:34] examples of mothers in the Bible who
[1:02:37] played some important roles.
[1:02:41] the mother of Moses.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:02:50] the mother of Moses.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Imagine such a great prophet like Moses.
[1:02:58] He still needed his mother.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Imagine he he went to Egypt,
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; but he still they still need he still
[1:03:07] needed his mother to be there to guide
[1:03:09] him.
[1:03:12] So God, in other words, God needed
[1:03:14] Moses' mother to to guide him in his
[1:03:17] early steps.
[1:03:22] The prophet says that was instructing
[1:03:25] Moses that you are different.
[1:03:29] Don't get
[1:03:31] don't get too comfortable in the house
[1:03:33] of Pharaoh.
[1:03:35] you know, you are to be a the liberator
[1:03:37] of the of the children of Israel.
[1:03:41] And those things stayed with Moses,
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; you know, to the point that even when he
[1:03:45] grew up, he tried to take things into
[1:03:48] his own hand, you know, and he tried to
[1:03:51] kill, you know, the Egyptians because
[1:03:53] his mother told him he was to be the the
[1:03:56] liberator.
[1:04:00] That's why Solomon comes back in prophet
[1:04:03] and says parent train your child.
[1:04:08] You have a vision that you want your
[1:04:09] children to be.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Every parent I believe you have an
[1:04:13] image. No, I would like my son to be
[1:04:14] this or my daughter to be this.
[1:04:17] That's a good thing, you know, because
[1:04:19] you need to have plans for your kids
[1:04:21] because because even God has a plan for
[1:04:24] his kids,
[1:04:26] you know, and when the prophet preached
[1:04:27] on marriage and divorce or when he
[1:04:29] preach on uh uh
[1:04:32] I can't think of the message, you know,
[1:04:33] the invisible uh what's the
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; invisible union of the
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; I feel like there's another message, but
[1:04:39] I can't think of the name. The prophet
[1:04:41] the prophet preached and said that even
[1:04:44] though I'm talking naturally it also
[1:04:46] applies spiritually.
[1:04:52] So we need to be like Christ
[1:04:55] which we means that we need to have the
[1:04:57] mindset of Christ as parents
[1:05:02] which is to have plans for your kids.
[1:05:08] You know, another another example was
[1:05:10] Timothy's mother. I'll stick on this on
[1:05:12] this one for for some for some time.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; So, if we go to the book of Timothy
[1:05:17] chapter 1 verse 5, second Timothy,
[1:05:21] we just read that earlier. Paul says
[1:05:23] that when I called to remembrance the
[1:05:25] unfinish faith that is in thee,
[1:05:30] which dwelt first in thy grandmother,
[1:05:37] Lo and thy mother unice
[1:05:41] and I'm persuaded that it's in thee
[1:05:44] also.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; So what is faith? Faith is a revelation.
[1:05:49] So in outward Paul is telling Timothy
[1:05:52] that whatever revelation your
[1:05:54] grandmother Lo is head of the word I've
[1:05:58] seen it getting passed down to she
[1:06:00] taught her daughter well unice.
[1:06:05] And now I see that Unice also taught you
[1:06:08] that same revelation.
[1:06:11] That's why it's important to teach your
[1:06:13] children the revelation of this message
[1:06:16] because you have to pass it down from
[1:06:18] generation to generation.
[1:06:21] You know, God even in Deuteronomy
[1:06:23] chapter 4,
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; he told the children of Israel to teach
[1:06:28] their children and their grandchildren
[1:06:32] the works of the Lord
[1:06:35] passing down the knowledge of God from
[1:06:37] generation to generation.
[1:06:41] Imagine what a privilege in the Bible to
[1:06:44] have your grandmother being named in the
[1:06:47] Bible.
[1:06:50] So in other words, Paul what he's
[1:06:52] telling Timothy
[1:06:54] is like when I see you Timothy, I can't
[1:06:56] just see your mother.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; When I see you you Timothy, I see your
[1:07:00] grandmother. I see how they how they
[1:07:03] were instructed in the word. I see how
[1:07:05] they have faith in the word and now I
[1:07:08] see it in you. So that's something that
[1:07:10] was passed down. So don't neglect your
[1:07:13] position.
[1:07:15] You may have a Timothy grandson.
[1:07:18] You may have a Timothy grand grandson.
[1:07:23] Teach them the word of God.
[1:07:26] Teach them the message of the hour
[1:07:30] because there are too many distractions
[1:07:31] now in in our day.
[1:07:34] But it's your responsibility as the
[1:07:36] mother
[1:07:38] to instruct your child. Why? Because the
[1:07:41] Bible so that when he grows up,
[1:07:45] he will not depart from it.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Things get passed down from generation
[1:07:52] to generation.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; The prophet even talks about that as
[1:07:56] well in the message, the baptism of the
[1:07:59] Holy Spirit. Paragraph 36. He says,
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; "What makes these little girls act like
[1:08:06] that?" No, let's let me go. So, and
[1:08:09] people today
[1:08:10] the teenagers out in high school
[1:08:14] with beer parties
[1:08:17] and drinking
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; and little girls living in adultery,
[1:08:23] little boys and things like that.
[1:08:26] What kind of a generation is coming up
[1:08:29] after this?
[1:08:32] So it is also questioning what kind of a
[1:08:34] generation are we going to have in the
[1:08:35] future?
[1:08:38] If our kids are acting like this, what
[1:08:41] are they going to pass down to future
[1:08:43] generations?
[1:08:46] What make the what makes these little
[1:08:48] girls act like that?
[1:08:52] He said their mommy was a flapper.
[1:08:56] Their grandmommy was a chorus girl.
[1:09:00] So we also see the prophet is using the
[1:09:02] same thing that we just read in Timothy.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; He's blaming it on the parents
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; and not even just stopping it there but
[1:09:09] he's going to the grandmother.
[1:09:13] You know on the on one side we have
[1:09:14] Timothy grandmother who was firm in the
[1:09:18] faith
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; and she passed it down to her mother to
[1:09:24] her daughter and then her daughter
[1:09:26] passed it down to Timothy.
[1:09:28] And now here brother Brandham when he's
[1:09:30] seeing all these girls act like that in
[1:09:31] high school
[1:09:34] he's not blaming the girls but he's like
[1:09:36] that got to be the mother that got to be
[1:09:38] the grandmother.
[1:09:41] That's why there's a saying that says uh
[1:09:43] such uh uh I don't know I'm translating
[1:09:46] that literally such such mother such
[1:09:49] daughter
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; that's not in vain it's scriptural
[1:09:55] you know it's scriptural
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; their mommy was a flapper
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; you know I've I've usually even heard
[1:10:05] brothers or even uh even my other
[1:10:08] pastors giving me advices for instance
[1:10:12] Sometimes they say that if you want if
[1:10:14] when you're looking for a wife
[1:10:17] one of the one of the things to look at
[1:10:18] look at the mom
[1:10:22] look at how the mom behaves
[1:10:25] you know because somehow somewhere you
[1:10:28] will see that the daughter behaves
[1:10:29] exactly like her mom
[1:10:32] it's nature
[1:10:35] we say we saw that with Timothy it was
[1:10:37] passed down to him by his
[1:10:40] And the prophet used the same example to
[1:10:42] also talk about how
[1:10:46] Abraham paid his tithing.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; What was the scripture in Levi?
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; In the loins of
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; in the law in the law of Levi.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; So it's so that same attribute the same
[1:10:59] behavior of paying tithing when we just
[1:11:01] came down all the way to the generation
[1:11:03] of Abraham.
[1:11:07] And you know I'm not so sometime there
[1:11:08] are even curses [clears throat] bad
[1:11:10] habits
[1:11:12] the bad habits that you have as a parent
[1:11:15] now you start seeing that in your child
[1:11:18] you start seeing that in your children
[1:11:22] and that's why we need prayer. When you
[1:11:24] start seeing those bad habits then you
[1:11:26] need to be more on your knees because
[1:11:28] it's just your yourself you got passed
[1:11:30] down to your children. There's only one
[1:11:34] there's only one person that can break
[1:11:36] that away.
[1:11:37] There's only one person that can change
[1:11:39] the nature of a child.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; But you know the way he changes the
[1:11:43] nature of a child, he doesn't give you a
[1:11:46] new nature.
[1:11:48] He also sticks by his own laws.
[1:11:51] He takes the nature of God the father.
[1:11:54] He takes the nature of God the father.
[1:11:57] Brother tells us this. All that was in
[1:12:00] God. Imagine all that was in grandmother
[1:12:03] Lois,
[1:12:05] all that was in God pull down into Jesus
[1:12:09] Christ. Pull down into Mother Unice. And
[1:12:13] all that was in Jesus Christ, all that
[1:12:16] was in Mother Unice got pulled down into
[1:12:19] Timothy, pulled down into the bride. SO
[1:12:23] NOW WHEN GOD changes your nature,
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; you he makes sure you you are born
[1:12:28] again.
[1:12:29] And now instead of bearing the nature of
[1:12:31] your father and mother,
[1:12:34] now you bear the nature of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:39] Amen. Lead your children to Christ.
[1:12:42] Lead your children to Christ.
[1:12:45] You know, because Christ is the only
[1:12:47] person that will change them.
[1:12:49] You know that image that you have that
[1:12:51] you want your children to be.
[1:12:54] There's only one person that can make
[1:12:56] that come to pass. It's Jesus.
[1:13:01] That's why you have to pray. You have to
[1:13:03] have a connection with with God
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; because God knows them better than you
[1:13:08] do.
[1:13:10] God is their creator.
[1:13:13] So God knows your children better than
[1:13:15] you do. So then that's why you go back
[1:13:18] to God like Hannah.
[1:13:21] Hannah was praying for children. She was
[1:13:24] praying for children for a child. But
[1:13:27] when God gave her a child Samuel,
[1:13:30] she took Samuel and she brought him back
[1:13:33] to the Lord.
[1:13:35] That's what you need to do. Parents, you
[1:13:37] take your children. You are like, "Lord,
[1:13:39] I can only do as much as a mother. I can
[1:13:42] only do as much as a father. But Lord, I
[1:13:45] give you my children. Lord, I'm praying
[1:13:48] more day and night for my children
[1:13:51] because you know them weather better
[1:13:53] than I do. I promise you, you have you
[1:13:56] will have good children.
[1:13:59] Give them in the hand of the Lord. Pray
[1:14:01] for them.
[1:14:04] Hallelujah.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "What makes them what
[1:14:08] makes these little girls act like that?
[1:14:09] It's their mommy. Their mommy was a
[1:14:12] flapper."
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; And I looked up the word the word
[1:14:15] flapper.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; You know, the the word flapper, it's
[1:14:21] it's a slang used in the 1920s.
[1:14:24] flapper.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; He refers to a young woman who was
[1:14:27] rebellious and unconventional, known for
[1:14:30] her short hair, short short hair, short
[1:14:32] skirts, and bold behavior like smoking
[1:14:33] and drinking in public.
[1:14:39] These women embraced a more liberal and
[1:14:42] modern lifestyle.
[1:14:49] which sucked which sucked the Victorian
[1:14:52] values of their parents.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; So it's those women they wanted to be
[1:14:59] they want we want to be the modern women
[1:15:02] and and if you continue reading it says
[1:15:04] that it was often associated with the
[1:15:06] rise of jazz music and the jazz age.
[1:15:12] Modern music, you know, modern music had
[1:15:15] an effect on the parents.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Modern music had an effect on on on
[1:15:20] women.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Just the same way that Hollywood now has
[1:15:24] an effect on even how people raise their
[1:15:26] kids.
[1:15:30] Sometimes you're not even aware of it.
[1:15:31] Sometimes you certain sometimes you just
[1:15:33] do certain things because that's the
[1:15:34] trend of the hour.
[1:15:39] But the Bible tells us to be different.
[1:15:43] We are not to be after Hollywood. We are
[1:15:46] not to be influenced by the uh what's
[1:15:49] the word? The popular music of the of
[1:15:51] the hour.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, you said Beyonce, she does this.
[1:15:56] Taylor Swift, she does this. And then
[1:15:58] that influences you. influence. No, we
[1:16:00] ought to be influenced by the word of
[1:16:03] God
[1:16:05] because the word of God tells us how to
[1:16:07] properly raise our children.
[1:16:10] THE WORD OF GOD EVEN TELLS US THAT SPARE
[1:16:12] the rod, you you spoil the child.
[1:16:17] But now in this modern age, if you if
[1:16:20] you if you you you chastise your your
[1:16:23] your son or daughter,
[1:16:26] you know, now you they're going to bring
[1:16:28] the police to your house.
[1:16:30] Why? Because that's the modern way of
[1:16:33] raising your children.
[1:16:36] And you wonder why there are so many
[1:16:38] delinquency in our day.
[1:16:41] Because we have forgotten the principles
[1:16:44] of the Bible.
[1:16:46] THE prophet said that the US the US has
[1:16:49] fallen because he has gotten away from
[1:16:50] the principles of the Bible.
[1:16:56] Let's get back TO BIBLE PRINCIPLES.
[1:16:59] GET BACK TO RAISING our children the way
[1:17:01] the Bible teaches us to raise children.
[1:17:06] And then you kids, when your parent
[1:17:09] disciplines you, you don't have to go to
[1:17:12] to to the police and and call the
[1:17:14] police.
[1:17:17] It doesn't mean that they don't LOVE
[1:17:19] YOU. THEY ARE JUST FOLLOWING the word.
[1:17:23] They are doing this with love.
[1:17:26] I'll give my own example.
[1:17:28] You know, growing up,
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; sometime I used to fight with my older
[1:17:31] sister Ruth,
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; I used to think every time I would fight
[1:17:36] my sister Ruth,
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; I used to always get punished.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; No matter even if I was right or if I
[1:17:43] was wrong, I would always get punished.
[1:17:47] And at some points, I even started
[1:17:48] thinking that I was adopted.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I started thinking that maybe I'm
[1:17:54] not truly my parents son like because
[1:17:57] there is no
[1:18:00] but I remember one time a mother had
[1:18:02] told me
[1:18:04] you should never put your hand on a
[1:18:06] woman no matter what that's why we are
[1:18:09] always punish you because we are
[1:18:11] training you so that when you grow up
[1:18:14] now you know that you should never put
[1:18:16] your hand on a woman
[1:18:19] get back to Bible principles
[1:18:22] get to train your child the way of the
[1:18:24] Bible.
[1:18:26] Children, your parents love you.
[1:18:29] I read one quote where the prophet SAYS
[1:18:31] THAT YOU JUST LOOKING, OH, they're just
[1:18:33] old. They don't know.
[1:18:35] The prophet says that when you grow up
[1:18:37] one day, you will understand. You will
[1:18:41] value why your parents were doing things
[1:18:43] like that.
[1:18:46] Obey your parents.
[1:18:50] And so that was the rebellious woman.
[1:18:54] And then they says their grandmommy was
[1:18:56] a chorus girl.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; You know, I used to think that chorus
[1:19:00] girl just means singing in a choir.
[1:19:03] So I looked up what does chorus girl
[1:19:06] meant in the time of the prophets.
[1:19:10] So it says because this message was
[1:19:11] preached in 1958.
[1:19:14] I looked up online. He says in the 1950s
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; a chorus girl referred to a woman who
[1:19:21] performed as part of the chorus line in
[1:19:23] a in a theatrical productions.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So they give an example like
[1:19:33] Broadway musical, nightclubs or variety
[1:19:36] of
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; he says 1950s chorus girl equals today's
[1:19:42] musical theater ensemble dancer and
[1:19:45] professional backup dancers.
[1:19:53] So in other words, in other words, those
[1:19:54] are like backup sing backup dancers and
[1:19:56] you know
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; for those who have watched even like uh
[1:20:01] uh what you call it worldly music, you
[1:20:04] see how those musicians they sing with
[1:20:06] their their backup performer.
[1:20:09] So the prophet is that the reason why
[1:20:12] their daughters are living in adulterers
[1:20:14] and little boys like that is because
[1:20:16] their mothers
[1:20:20] were rebellious
[1:20:22] and then their grandmother was back.
[1:20:25] They were backup dancers
[1:20:27] enjoying the entertainment, the pleasure
[1:20:29] of the world.
[1:20:31] They send of value in the education of
[1:20:33] their children
[1:20:36] and now that is passed down from
[1:20:38] generation to generation
[1:20:41] generation.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; But we don't want to pass down bad
[1:20:44] habits from either generation.
[1:20:47] I want that when that when those things
[1:20:49] comes to my house
[1:20:51] that's the end of the curse that when it
[1:20:54] comes to my house I break that chain of
[1:20:56] of those generations.
[1:20:59] I don't care if my father my grandfather
[1:21:01] were alcoholic
[1:21:03] but in my house that is THE STOP OF IT.
[1:21:06] WHY? BECAUSE I'M applying the blood of
[1:21:08] Jesus Christ over my house.
[1:21:12] I apply the blood of Jesus Christ in
[1:21:14] your house.
[1:21:16] Apply the blood of Jesus Christ over
[1:21:17] YOUR CHILDREN.
[1:21:19] APPLY the blood of Jesus Christ over
[1:21:21] your wife. APPLY THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:21:24] CHRIST OVER YOUR HUSBAND. SO that all
[1:21:26] those those
[1:21:28] passed down curses
[1:21:32] those curses will be enoldled.
[1:21:38] You know some you some just those are
[1:21:40] it's it's hereditary.
[1:21:43] It's it's a family thing. Well, let it
[1:21:47] end in your with you.
[1:21:51] Let it stop with you. Do not pass it
[1:21:54] down to your children. But it comes with
[1:21:56] prayer.
[1:22:01] And then we we see in 2 Timothy chapter
[1:22:03] 3:15, and if I don't finish it, maybe
[1:22:06] next time.
[1:22:08] Second Timothy 3:15, the Bible says, "So
[1:22:11] Paul is talking to Timothy.
[1:22:13] And he says, "And that from a child thou
[1:22:16] thou has known the holy scriptures
[1:22:22] which are able to make thee wise unto
[1:22:24] salvation through faith which is in
[1:22:26] Christ Jesus."
[1:22:30] So from a childhood. So how did he know
[1:22:33] this from a childhood?
[1:22:35] We saw earlier it says because of your
[1:22:37] mother unions.
[1:22:40] And that led to to Timothy being saved
[1:22:45] to make thee wise unto salvation.
[1:22:48] You have wisdom to understand that I I I
[1:22:50] need to give my life to Christ. I NEED
[1:22:53] TO GET BAPTIZED. WHY? Because from a
[1:22:56] childhood I I knew the holy scriptures.
[1:23:00] So that's why parents, mothers, and I'll
[1:23:03] read you a quote. The prophet encourages
[1:23:05] you to read the scriptures to your
[1:23:07] children.
[1:23:09] Read Bible story to your children. It
[1:23:12] will have an impact and effect in their
[1:23:14] lives.
[1:23:16] You know the prophet says in a message
[1:23:19] calling Jesus on the scene paragraph 63
[1:23:25] he says John might have John might have
[1:23:28] said something like he said
[1:23:30] you know when I was a little boy we
[1:23:32] lived down by Jericho.
[1:23:36] I remember my Jewish mother used to rock
[1:23:38] me to sleep in the afternoon.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; I used to look up in her eyes and she
[1:23:44] would tell me Bible stories
[1:23:48] and now and now the prophet says
[1:23:50] paragraph 64 the message calling Jesus
[1:23:51] on the scene 1964
[1:23:55] paragraph 64 he says and you know that's
[1:23:57] a good thing for any mother to do to her
[1:23:59] child.
[1:24:03] bring her up a ch bring up a child in
[1:24:06] the way it should go.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; And he says it will be better than
[1:24:11] turning on the television and watch some
[1:24:13] of these some of these here things that
[1:24:16] goes on the television.
[1:24:22] You'll be better off if you read him a
[1:24:24] Bible story.
[1:24:28] Why the purpose? because it's impressing
[1:24:30] his little mind.
[1:24:33] So you understand
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; exactly. So it's impressing the little
[1:24:40] mind
[1:24:42] instead of staying and watching a bunch
[1:24:44] of television shows
[1:24:48] giving our children and you know the
[1:24:50] children are always on YouTube 24/7
[1:24:54] watching all sort of things 24/7.
[1:24:57] THE PROPHET Malachi 4 is teaching us how
[1:25:00] to raise our children.
[1:25:02] He's read them Bible stories.
[1:25:06] We see Timothy was brought up from a
[1:25:08] child. He knew the holy scriptures.
[1:25:11] Timothy, who wouldn't want to have
[1:25:13] another little Timothy?
[1:25:17] So God does not change.
[1:25:20] God if if this one person did a certain
[1:25:23] thing and brought up a certain result,
[1:25:25] if you also do it, it will bring the
[1:25:27] same result.
[1:25:33] So the prophet says it'll be better than
[1:25:35] turning on the television.
[1:25:39] Sometimes now we have parents and mother
[1:25:41] you see and your children you guys are
[1:25:43] just busy watching shows. I don't know
[1:25:45] if I don't know anybody that does it
[1:25:47] here, but I'm just talking,
[1:25:49] you know, watching shows
[1:25:52] hardly telling our children Bible
[1:25:54] stories.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; You know, the house of God is a house of
[1:25:59] correction.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; The word of God is helping you because
[1:26:03] this age is is the worst of all the
[1:26:06] ages.
[1:26:08] The prophet even says, I'll find a quote
[1:26:10] here, that our children have more
[1:26:12] temptations than even the parents had
[1:26:14] before.
[1:26:16] That's the age of Leodysia
[1:26:19] where evil is increased in the land.
[1:26:23] The prophet even says that the pizza the
[1:26:25] doors of hell have been opened
[1:26:29] and demons are out here in the streets.
[1:26:33] The prophet went to the mall Jesse Penny
[1:26:36] and he even saw the same influence of
[1:26:38] demons that he saw in hell.
[1:26:41] We see those influences in Hollywood
[1:26:43] movies.
[1:26:45] those influences in so what our kids
[1:26:47] sees on social media.
[1:26:50] But we need to make sure that in the
[1:26:52] house we are suppressing that influence
[1:26:56] that our child when they come home as as
[1:26:59] the prophet says the parents lay a good
[1:27:02] example for the kids
[1:27:06] tell them Bible stories.
[1:27:11] I'll read a quote on the prophet talks
[1:27:12] about him and his kids how he was
[1:27:14] telling them the message Elijah the
[1:27:16] prophet and I hope this is a blessing to
[1:27:18] you
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; and every and that's the same thing this
[1:27:24] message is also to all the single women
[1:27:26] who are aspiring to be mothers
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; because you have to understand you have
[1:27:32] a responsibility
[1:27:34] God has given you the prophet says it's
[1:27:36] a god-given nature in you to mother
[1:27:38] something
[1:27:43] And he says there are three things that
[1:27:45] God that that in in that honors God for
[1:27:48] a woman.
[1:27:50] I'll read the quotes also. I have it
[1:27:51] somewhere. He says it's first you it's
[1:27:54] first giving your life to Christ
[1:27:57] and then secondly it's being loyal to
[1:27:59] your husband.
[1:28:04] The third is to have a baby
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; and to raise that baby.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible even talks about there's a
[1:28:12] scripture that says that you will be
[1:28:14] saved uh by through childbearing. If you
[1:28:17] continue in these things, you will be
[1:28:19] saved.
[1:28:21] And I and I find childbearing like u
[1:28:26] you know the prophet talks about that
[1:28:28] scripture.
[1:28:29] He says first you need to be saved
[1:28:32] and then if you continue on those things
[1:28:36] raising your kids
[1:28:38] there's a blessing that comes with it
[1:28:41] you will your husband will never take
[1:28:43] your position as your as a mother
[1:28:47] a father cannot sympathize for a for his
[1:28:50] daughter the same way that a mother will
[1:28:55] just love God has put more sympathy
[1:28:59] more affection
[1:29:01] in the in the mother than the father.
[1:29:05] We even see one time the prophet was
[1:29:06] there was a baby in the prayer line.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; You know the baby was sick and the Holy
[1:29:13] Ghost spoke to her mother to pray for
[1:29:15] the baby
[1:29:18] and then but she was like okay I mean
[1:29:19] who am I like the baby is going to be
[1:29:21] prayed by the prophet William Brown.
[1:29:25] But the Holy Ghost kept pressing it down
[1:29:27] on her that she asked to pray for the
[1:29:30] mother, for the kid, you know. And when
[1:29:33] the baby went to the prayer line, the
[1:29:36] the Holy Ghost says that your this baby
[1:29:38] is already healed
[1:29:40] because he was already prayed by a
[1:29:42] mother.
[1:29:43] And the prophet says that the the the
[1:29:46] way a mother would sympathize with that
[1:29:48] baby, I wouldn't sympathize the same
[1:29:49] way.
[1:29:52] So the prayer of a mother in other words
[1:29:54] it can't even be more effective than the
[1:29:56] prayer of a prophet for your baby.
[1:30:00] So the the prayer of that mother was
[1:30:02] more effective than the prayer would
[1:30:04] have been more effective than the prayer
[1:30:05] of brother.
[1:30:10] That's why even you can come here you
[1:30:12] bring your children to be pray for
[1:30:14] that's good we will pray for them but
[1:30:17] that prayer will never be the same with
[1:30:19] when the mother prays for her children.
[1:30:23] That's the message the prophet said that
[1:30:26] that's why you need to pray at home
[1:30:28] because you have a responsibility
[1:30:31] that you just have to know that I'm in a
[1:30:33] place where you know have you ever had a
[1:30:35] position where you know that if you are
[1:30:38] not there in that place everything is
[1:30:40] going to be like messed up
[1:30:44] chaos everywhere
[1:30:46] that's the same attitude you should have
[1:30:48] as a mother
[1:30:50] you should know that If I never pray for
[1:30:52] my children,
[1:30:54] no one else can take this position that
[1:30:56] I have,
[1:31:00] you know.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; So the prophet says in the message
[1:31:02] Elijah the prophet paragraph 27, I'll
[1:31:04] try to hurry up
[1:31:06] and every every evening when I'm home,
[1:31:11] everything is cleaned out.
[1:31:14] I take my little girls and give them a
[1:31:16] Bible study.
[1:31:21] Now I know this is directed to the
[1:31:22] mother but he's also the father. So
[1:31:23] fathers can also teach your children
[1:31:25] Bible studies
[1:31:29] you know but you understand and you'll
[1:31:31] see how the prophet took it very
[1:31:32] seriously. He says put them in the car
[1:31:36] so nobody would interrupt us.
[1:31:42] That's how important that meant to the
[1:31:44] prophet. We need to get away somewhere
[1:31:47] me and my little girl.
[1:31:49] me and my little kids. I'm going to
[1:31:51] teach them the Bible,
[1:31:54] wife and baby.
[1:31:56] And I give them questions like,
[1:31:59] "Who was Elijah?
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Where was he?"
[1:32:04] And right quick, them little old
[1:32:06] six-year-old and you see the age sixy
[1:32:09] old and 8y old girls, they say he was a
[1:32:12] tish bit
[1:32:16] right quick. So he will ask, "Hey, who
[1:32:18] was Elijah?" "Oh, daddy, he was the
[1:32:20] bite."
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; We love the prophets, right?
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; We love the prophet. Let's do as the
[1:32:30] prophet was doing.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not asking any children to
[1:32:34] raise their hand, but if you want to,
[1:32:36] you can. I wonder is there any any
[1:32:38] eight, nineyear-old that knows who
[1:32:40] Elijah is?
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Any kids kids? Do you guys know Elijah?
[1:32:47] You know Elijah,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; good job. Who was Elijah?
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you and God bless your
[1:32:54] parents for teaching you that. Let's
[1:32:56] applause for that. That's how you raise
[1:32:58] your children.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Any other that know Elijah because we
[1:33:02] are under the ministry of Elijah. And we
[1:33:05] need to start training our children from
[1:33:07] a young age who Elijah was.
[1:33:11] That's what the prophet was doing.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; So if you're not doing this, start doing
[1:33:15] that.
[1:33:18] God bless you, Bethl. Keep doing the
[1:33:20] keep doing what you're doing.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; What was he, you know, in the right and
[1:33:24] I said, how do you know? How could you
[1:33:26] tell if you would meet him today?
[1:33:29] What kind of a man was he? Oh, he was a
[1:33:33] hairy man and had leather around his
[1:33:35] loins. Little Rebecca or Sarah Sarah,
[1:33:38] one will will holler out. So, you see
[1:33:41] the kids were even excited about those
[1:33:42] kind of questions.
[1:33:45] They know. Oh, now it's a Bible study
[1:33:46] time with daddy.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Who was Elijah? Daddy, I know. I know. I
[1:33:50] know. I know. I know. Who was he? He was
[1:33:53] a prophet.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; That's raising the children according to
[1:33:57] Malachi 4.
[1:34:01] And he says, uh, uh, paragraph 28, just
[1:34:04] keep, he says, just keep drilling that
[1:34:07] that into their mind.
[1:34:10] Keep teaching them who brother Brham
[1:34:13] was.
[1:34:14] drill that into their mind. You know, he
[1:34:16] didn't say just one time. Keep to drill
[1:34:19] is to take something and pierce and you
[1:34:21] keep drilling drilling.
[1:34:24] You guys will know who brother Brandham
[1:34:27] was. WHETHER YOU WANT IT or not, you
[1:34:29] will know today. Hey, do you know
[1:34:32] brother Brandham? Let me ask another
[1:34:34] question. Any kids, do you know who
[1:34:36] brother Brandham was?
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Seems like Bethl is the only person that
[1:34:41] knows everything. Who is brother?
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you again. Wow.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep drilling that into your
[1:34:51] children.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; To be to be honest in this message of
[1:34:58] the hour, if your children don't even
[1:34:59] know who Brother Brandham is,
[1:35:03] we need to do better.
[1:35:07] We need to do better and teach them the
[1:35:09] prophet.
[1:35:11] prophet.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; He says constantly
[1:35:15] constant
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; that's what you do to your children
[1:35:17] matter. You know, you might say, "Oh,
[1:35:19] Elise, why are you telling me that? Do
[1:35:20] you have no business telling me that?"
[1:35:21] Okay, now the prophet is telling you.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; That's what you do to your children,
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; mother.
[1:35:31] Quit running around over the city
[1:35:36] and getting about giving about giving
[1:35:38] your children Bible lectures and things,
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; you know. Let me skip a little bit. He
[1:35:46] says, "I believe you've heard my
[1:35:47] expression of women preachers,
[1:35:54] but let me tell you,
[1:35:57] every mother is a preacher."
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Sure. And God gives her a little
[1:36:04] congregation at home to preach to.re.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; So mothers, what is your responsibility?
[1:36:13] What is your ministry? You have a
[1:36:15] ministry.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; It's not behind these pulpit,
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; but it's in the pulpit in your homes.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; You have a little congregation.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; You are to preach your children.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; That's good. You get it first. So then
[1:36:35] go right with your children.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Let me try to skip. Uh yeah, let me read
[1:36:39] your story.
[1:36:42] So uh I I was reading an article where
[1:36:44] there was a home and five boys were were
[1:36:47] born in this home
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; and as soon as the oldest one got old
[1:36:57] enough to go to the navy off to the navy
[1:36:59] he went and the second ONE SO LIKE ALL
[1:37:01] the five boys became navy soldiers
[1:37:07] don't
[1:37:08] then the mother and father couldn't
[1:37:10] understand
[1:37:12] just why these boys everyone wanted to
[1:37:14] go to the navy.
[1:37:17] And there was a real fine combin coming
[1:37:20] uh investigation made of this.
[1:37:25] And they come to find out that in the
[1:37:28] bedroom where these boys all was brought
[1:37:30] up.
[1:37:32] In this bedroom there was a beautiful
[1:37:34] big picture hanging there
[1:37:37] of a big ship sailing on a quiet calm
[1:37:40] sea.
[1:37:44] And he so impressed the boys as they
[1:37:46] went to bed at night. Looking at this
[1:37:49] picture,
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; he was on their mind to sell that quiet
[1:37:59] and it impressed the boys so that each
[1:38:01] one be become a sailor.
[1:38:05] Paragraph 32. Now look what the prophet
[1:38:07] says.
[1:38:08] Now if a picture of a ship will impress
[1:38:11] boys to become navy men, sailors of the
[1:38:14] sea,
[1:38:20] what are the picture of the Lord Jesus
[1:38:22] Christ do?
[1:38:25] See, always have the right thing before
[1:38:28] your children.
[1:38:31] If the picture of the sailor would
[1:38:33] impress five consecutive boys to all
[1:38:36] become navy men,
[1:38:41] this when I read this I thought about
[1:38:43] you know I don't believe I don't believe
[1:38:45] in like it's not like I'm worshiping a
[1:38:47] picture
[1:38:49] but we just read the prophecies then
[1:38:51] what would A PICTURE DO SO pictures have
[1:38:54] effect ON PEOPLE
[1:38:57] THAT'S why have the picture of the
[1:38:59] pillar of fire in your house
[1:39:01] that's why we have pictures of Jesus
[1:39:03] Christ
[1:39:05] in your bedroom with your kids put the
[1:39:09] picture of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:11] It's going to impress the mind.
[1:39:14] That's what the prophet is saying.
[1:39:16] Always have the right thing before your
[1:39:18] children.
[1:39:20] Let's stick with that sentence. Always
[1:39:23] have the right thing before your
[1:39:24] children.
[1:39:26] So what does that mean? That means you
[1:39:28] need to know where what your children
[1:39:30] are watching.
[1:39:32] That means you need to know what is put
[1:39:34] in front of your children.
[1:39:39] Maybe the father might be busy at work
[1:39:41] but that's the responsibility of the
[1:39:42] mother.
[1:39:45] You know we sometime we give our kids
[1:39:48] tablets and iPads not nothing against
[1:39:50] that but you need to vet it. You need to
[1:39:53] go through it because there are all sort
[1:39:56] of things that they are watching
[1:39:59] and the prophet says it's going to
[1:40:00] impress their little mind.
[1:40:04] If you can project that picture that
[1:40:06] that I put there,
[1:40:08] you know, like so there was a there was
[1:40:09] a I think some of you might know this
[1:40:11] Coaron,
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; you know. So in 2023
[1:40:20] I have the Yeah. in 20 23. So there's an
[1:40:23] article that was published that says
[1:40:26] Netflix faces calls for boycott over
[1:40:28] Cocoon Lane cartoonetflix
[1:40:34] a character in the Netflix series. No,
[1:40:36] just go back to the picture.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Niko, a character in the Netflix series.
[1:40:44] He's wearing a tyra or tutu like he's
[1:40:46] wearing a skirt
[1:40:49] as he tries on girls outfit in front of
[1:40:51] his two gay dads.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Did you even know that was in one of the
[1:40:59] Coco melons?
[1:41:02] Why are they doing that? It's to impress
[1:41:04] their little mind.
[1:41:08] And and then um um the gay dads then
[1:41:12] start singing a song encouraging the
[1:41:14] toddler to decide how he wants to dress.
[1:41:24] And this is what the song says. If
[1:41:26] you're not sure what to choose,
[1:41:30] think about all the things you like to
[1:41:32] do. Just be you.
[1:41:37] The to the toddler then asks just be me
[1:41:42] as he considers a series of outfits like
[1:41:45] skirts or stuffon.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; We need to be careful.
[1:41:56] Satan is not sleeping.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; You know the Bible says that he's
[1:42:00] roaring like a lion seeking whom he may
[1:42:02] devour.
[1:42:04] But the Bible also tells us to be not
[1:42:06] ignorant of his devices.
[1:42:10] He takes an advantage over you.
[1:42:13] And we see the prophet telling us always
[1:42:15] uh what did he say again? Like know
[1:42:17] what? Always have the right thing before
[1:42:19] your children.
[1:42:21] So is this the right thing? Is that what
[1:42:23] you want your child to do?
[1:42:27] You you you know some things like that
[1:42:28] you you may you may not notice it from a
[1:42:31] child a child childhood
[1:42:34] but what what are they doing they are
[1:42:36] training them so that when they grow up
[1:42:40] because those are spirits that are being
[1:42:41] projected
[1:42:44] and if you don't first of all you don't
[1:42:46] even pray
[1:42:48] oh my may God help us parents you see
[1:42:50] the importance of prayer
[1:42:53] because we are woman. I'm not asking
[1:42:56] you. You're not going to catch
[1:42:57] everything that's in there.
[1:43:00] But that's where prayer comes in place
[1:43:03] because what you don't see, God sees.
[1:43:07] That's when prayer comes in place.
[1:43:10] Mother, pray for your children.
[1:43:13] So God, your prayer may be the one that
[1:43:16] causes your child. Maybe he was
[1:43:17] scrolling and he sees the episode like,
[1:43:18] "Ah, no, I'm going to skip this.
[1:43:24] Amen.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; And this is just one some certain
[1:43:27] images. I didn't even I didn't want to
[1:43:28] put it because we have kids,
[1:43:31] you know, subliminal sexual images in
[1:43:34] cartoons. Kids cartoons.
[1:43:40] Why are they doing this?
[1:43:42] You know, the pro the prophet says that
[1:43:44] Satan always copies what God does.
[1:43:47] If the prophet is telling us to train
[1:43:49] our kids so that it impresses their
[1:43:51] mind,
[1:43:54] Satan also understanding is like let's
[1:43:56] go to the children so that it impresses
[1:43:58] their mind.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me skip.
[1:44:07] May God give me grace.
[1:44:10] The message expectation
[1:44:13] expectative
[1:44:17] This is
[1:44:19] no I'll skip this one. Um in paragraph
[1:44:22] yeah same same message paragraph 29
[1:44:25] expectation.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; The first preacher that ever gets to a
[1:44:30] child is a mother.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Do we say amen to it? That's a prophet.
[1:44:36] They can project it. Paragraph 29
[1:44:38] expectation 55. The first preacher that
[1:44:40] ever gets to a child is a mother.
[1:44:45] Five gospels.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Mother.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and mother.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; What is your ministry? You are a gospel
[1:45:02] to your children.
[1:45:04] So, you know, I thought about that
[1:45:06] sentence. I said, what does he mean?
[1:45:08] Then I'm like, what are those five
[1:45:10] gospel, those four gospels?
[1:45:14] They tell about the story of Jesus.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; You know they tell about how Jesus died
[1:45:19] for our sins.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; But you understand that all those four
[1:45:23] gospels they one may have more stories
[1:45:27] than the other gospel.
[1:45:30] So Matthew may have another story than
[1:45:32] Mark adding more details.
[1:45:35] Luke and John. And now the prophet is
[1:45:37] like and now you have the mother's
[1:45:39] version of the Bible.
[1:45:42] We have the gospel according to to
[1:45:45] Matthew,
[1:45:47] the gospel according to Mark, the gospel
[1:45:50] according to Luke and John. And now the
[1:45:53] gospel according to Matthew
[1:45:56] because why? Because your kids are not
[1:45:58] going to understand all these hard words
[1:45:59] of the Bible sometime.
[1:46:04] Now you give them the gospel according
[1:46:08] to like in their in their language.
[1:46:12] How the prophet says by telling them
[1:46:14] stories
[1:46:18] a mother should be spiritfilled woman
[1:46:23] who can teach her children
[1:46:26] and teach them to pray and to know about
[1:46:29] God.
[1:46:33] Instead of that they give them to a
[1:46:35] babysitter and run all night long.
[1:46:39] the babysitter
[1:46:42] and then go to Sunday school on Sunday
[1:46:44] morning and call themselves Christian.
[1:46:51] You have a ministry that God gave you to
[1:46:52] raise that child
[1:46:54] to be the fifth gospel, the first
[1:46:57] preacher to that child.
[1:47:00] But now you're saying, "Nah,
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; the bills are more important."
[1:47:06] Now
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; babysitter become the fifth gospel to my
[1:47:09] child. Baby,
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; you know if you don't have a choice by
[1:47:16] taking your kids to baby babysitters,
[1:47:17] that's okay.
[1:47:20] But when they come home,
[1:47:22] make sure you you know what they taught
[1:47:24] them in those baby babysitters. Don't
[1:47:27] don't just assume they're teaching them
[1:47:28] good things.
[1:47:32] You know, I have a friend. She got
[1:47:33] married
[1:47:35] and she used to work in a day in a baby
[1:47:38] a dayare.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; You know, she said she told me that she
[1:47:42] she's not going to take her child to
[1:47:44] daycare until her child is of an age
[1:47:46] where he can speak.
[1:47:51] Why? Because she want her child to know
[1:47:54] to be able to translate to tell what
[1:47:57] there is being taught there.
[1:48:00] She has experience. She has worked in a
[1:48:02] daycare. She knows how it is.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; You know, Satan has bad agendas,
[1:48:12] you know,
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; you can't have a maybe, who knows? Maybe
[1:48:15] that day the the babysitter is a lesbian
[1:48:19] babysitter.
[1:48:20] And even though she cannot teach your
[1:48:22] child about, you know, the the
[1:48:24] homosexuality stuff,
[1:48:27] she just finds those cocoon stuff that
[1:48:30] talks about gay stuff and she put that
[1:48:33] in front of your child.
[1:48:35] And your child now, he grows up knowing
[1:48:37] it's okay for me to like a boy or to
[1:48:39] like a girl if I'm a girl.
[1:48:44] The prophet did not say the babysitter
[1:48:46] is the first gospel, the first preacher
[1:48:49] to your child. You the mother are the
[1:48:52] you are the first preacher
[1:49:00] in a message the presence of the Lord
[1:49:01] Jesus.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; I'm reading a lot to let you know that
[1:49:05] it's coming from the prophet
[1:49:08] and you can take notes and go check it
[1:49:10] yourselves at home.
[1:49:15] to see a big family anymore.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. They already pay hundreds of
[1:49:25] dollars for a little snottynosed dog and
[1:49:28] pack it pack it around
[1:49:33] and give it the love of a mother and
[1:49:34] practice birth control than to have
[1:49:36] children.
[1:49:40] Think that was something old. hang
[1:49:43] around to the barrooms, drink and play
[1:49:44] cards, and run around all afternoon in
[1:49:46] your husband's car.
[1:49:55] You know, if if you're a stay home wife,
[1:49:58] your husband is there working and he
[1:50:00] have you he has you a car, that's not
[1:50:01] for you to start running around the city
[1:50:03] and leaving your car by them, leaving
[1:50:05] your kids by themselves.
[1:50:10] No. Uh where where was I? Uh in the
[1:50:14] afternoon in your husband's car. Why?
[1:50:16] It's a disgrace.
[1:50:19] Now look, the greatest honor a woman can
[1:50:22] do
[1:50:25] outside of coming to Christ
[1:50:27] and being loyal to her husband
[1:50:31] is have a baby.
[1:50:37] So there are so in in the in order the
[1:50:40] first horner is you have to come to
[1:50:42] Christ and then be loyal to your
[1:50:45] husband. Then you have a baby.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You might be nursing a
[1:50:52] little preacher.
[1:50:55] How do you know that?
[1:50:58] I know that's oldfashioned.
[1:51:01] It's oldfashioned to encourage mothers
[1:51:03] to have kids in
[1:51:10] And I and I feel like it's even more
[1:51:11] among the uh western world like in the
[1:51:14] US compared to like even Africa
[1:51:19] because I saw even like Elon Musk or
[1:51:22] like the the US government government
[1:51:24] encouraging Americans now to have more
[1:51:26] kids.
[1:51:29] Why? because they've noticed that
[1:51:32] this this western world has they don't
[1:51:35] value having babies anymore.
[1:51:39] Now they all want to be like Taylor
[1:51:41] Swift who's a mother of cats.
[1:51:45] You know,
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; the prophet says she must she must she
[1:51:53] must mother something because it's a
[1:51:54] god-given nature to her. Let's keep
[1:51:58] I'll give another example. I'm I'm
[1:52:03] halfway through my notes, but I'll
[1:52:04] probably continue another day.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Suzanne Wesley.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Suzanne Wesley.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; You know, she was the mother of John
[1:52:13] Wesley and Charles Wesley.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Charles Wesley.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; And John Wesley and Charles, they're the
[1:52:18] one that started the Methodist movement
[1:52:21] revival Wesley,
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; the messenger of the age.
[1:52:26] and reading I read about her and it says
[1:52:28] early in her life she vowed that she
[1:52:30] would never spend more time in leisure
[1:52:33] entertainment than she did in prayer and
[1:52:35] Bible study.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; So she would say that
[1:52:45] her Bible study time and prayer needs to
[1:52:47] have more importance and time than
[1:52:49] entertainment.
[1:52:57] more important than going to parties.
[1:53:02] So in other words, in in this modern
[1:53:04] age, like
[1:53:06] bringing her children to Sunday school
[1:53:11] meant more to her than than work, than
[1:53:13] parties and everything else.
[1:53:17] We want modern Susan Wesley's
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; mothers that also have the same mindset.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; You know, he says,
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; even amid the the most complex and busy
[1:53:32] years of her life as a mother, she still
[1:53:35] scheduled two hours each day for
[1:53:36] fellowship with God and time in his
[1:53:38] word.
[1:53:44] Suzanne Wesley had 17 17 to 19 children.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Suzanne Wesley
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; but not all her you know she lost about
[1:53:55] nine of her children from young age cuz
[1:53:59] from what I read during that time it was
[1:54:02] common for children to have a lot of
[1:54:03] kids because kids were dying a lot
[1:54:05] because of the condition.
[1:54:08] So she lost about nine kids.
[1:54:11] So she she stay with 10 or nine kids.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; And if you also read she was her husband
[1:54:19] was not always around
[1:54:22] because her husband was a minister but
[1:54:24] he also got arrested a few times
[1:54:28] because he had an issue paying his debt.
[1:54:32] So they used to arrest him a lot. So now
[1:54:34] she was staying herself with all those
[1:54:36] nine kids.
[1:54:39] But she still scheduled two hours each
[1:54:42] day.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; And then she had she had
[1:54:48] here. How do you pronounce this?
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; I dared.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; She adared to that schedule faithfully.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; The challenge was finding a place of
[1:55:00] privacy in a house filled to overflowing
[1:55:03] with children.
[1:55:13] Mother's Wesley, you know what she was
[1:55:14] doing? So, Mother's Wesley's solution to
[1:55:16] this
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; because she couldn't find any privacy. I
[1:55:19] think she only had a one bedroom
[1:55:23] to solution to this was to bring her
[1:55:25] Bible to her favorite chair
[1:55:30] and throw her long apron over her head.
[1:55:37] forming a sort of tent.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; So she so she created her own room
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; which was just putting a tent over her
[1:55:46] head.
[1:55:48] This became something uh akin to the
[1:55:51] tent of meeting. Uh let me see. And when
[1:55:54] Susanna was under the apron,
[1:55:58] she was with God
[1:56:02] and was not to be disturbed.
[1:56:14] I have to end because of time.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Let me see where I can close. You know,
[1:56:20] and there are places where the prophet
[1:56:22] also talks about Suzanne Wesley.
[1:56:25] Suzanne Wesley.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'll continue this next time.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; So, we need more mothers like Susan
[1:56:34] Wesley.
[1:56:36] Mothers that prioritize the the the the
[1:56:40] upbringing of your children.
[1:56:49] You know, end with this quote, hear his
[1:56:50] voice. The prophet says in paragraph 80,
[1:56:55] but listen to his still small small
[1:56:57] voice.
[1:56:59] Every one of you people who profess to
[1:57:01] be Christians,
[1:57:03] get yourself quiet before him.
[1:57:08] Don't let the washing hinder.
[1:57:13] Don't let the work hinder.
[1:57:17] Don't let nothing hinder. So, in other
[1:57:19] words, don't have excuses.
[1:57:23] Don't let nobody know what you're doing.
[1:57:27] Just go before him.
[1:57:30] Get up in the woods somewhere.
[1:57:32] Get out in the Get out on the side of
[1:57:34] the road.
[1:57:36] Go into the secret closet
[1:57:39] and close the door.
[1:57:42] When the kids get at school,
[1:57:46] they get down on your knees.
[1:57:50] You know, when the kids go at school,
[1:57:51] get down on your knees.
[1:57:54] You have heard all kinds of voices
[1:57:55] everywhere.
[1:57:57] But just get down and stay there until
[1:58:00] those voices are silenced
[1:58:03] and you begin to lift up.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; We live in an age where our children
[1:58:08] more prayer more than they need prayer
[1:58:10] more than ever.
[1:58:13] Mothers, I encourage you to pray for
[1:58:15] your children.
[1:58:17] Read them Bible stories.
[1:58:20] When they grow up, they will not depart
[1:58:22] from you.
[1:58:31] Be the shield. Be the protection for
[1:58:34] your children.
[1:58:40] The prayer of a mother can never be
[1:58:41] replaced.
[1:58:46] Children, do you love your parents?
[1:58:49] You also need to respect your mothers.
[1:58:52] You need to respect to respect them.
[1:58:55] They go through a lot
[1:58:58] to make sure that we are taken care of.
[1:59:02] I even read another place where the
[1:59:03] prophet says take care of your parents
[1:59:05] when you grow up.
[1:59:07] Because
[1:59:09] the prophet says because when you
[1:59:10] couldn't take care of yourself, they
[1:59:12] took care of you.
[1:59:15] Don't give them a hard time.
[1:59:17] Pray for your parents and mothers. Pray
[1:59:19] for your children. Husband, pray for
[1:59:20] your wife.
[1:59:24] Let's um let's pray. Um you know if you
[1:59:28] just want to lay your hands on your
[1:59:29] mothers or your wives or your parents
[1:59:32] children raise lay your hands on your
[1:59:33] mother and mother on your children.
[1:59:35] Let's just make a family prayer.
[1:59:37] And if you don't have prayer for them at
[1:59:39] home and anywhere
[1:59:43] no even for your wives because they're
[1:59:46] to be future mothers.
[1:59:50] And let's pray. Dear heavenly father
[1:59:52] Lord Jesus,
[1:59:54] we thank you Lord God for your word.
[1:59:57] We thank you heavenly father Lord that
[1:59:59] you have given us guidance by your
[2:00:00] prophet on how to raise our children.
[2:00:04] And we thank you father Lord that you
[2:00:06] have given us good mothers Lord Jesus
[2:00:09] and mothers who prioritize raising us
[2:00:11] Lord Jesus. And heavenly father Lord for
[2:00:13] giving us an understanding that they
[2:00:15] also have a ministry
[2:00:18] is to raise their children Lord. But you
[2:00:21] know there are a lot of trials. There
[2:00:23] are a lot of things they have to go
[2:00:24] through Lord and challenges and
[2:00:26] especially in this year in churches with
[2:00:29] the economy of the hour. Sometimes they
[2:00:31] have to go to work
[2:00:33] but Lord in their hearts they still have
[2:00:35] a desire to to to take care of the
[2:00:37] children. Lord I pray that you give them
[2:00:40] grace Lord. I pray that you give them
[2:00:42] wisdom Lord that heavenly father Lord
[2:00:45] and patience to raise the children in
[2:00:47] the way that the Lord intends.
[2:00:50] Lord I pray father Lord that you give
[2:00:52] them the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus so that
[2:00:54] the Holy Ghost through them may train
[2:00:56] their child Lord Jesus. I pray heavenly
[2:00:59] father Lord that you help our children
[2:01:00] to be obedient to the parents.
[2:01:04] Heavenly father Lord Jesus Christ the
[2:01:06] message tells us that Malachi's mission
[2:01:07] was to restore us back to the faith of
[2:01:09] our fathers.
[2:01:12] Lord we saw last time that we preached
[2:01:14] that restoration of the altar
[2:01:17] Lord restoring the altar in the homes.
[2:01:20] Heavenly Father, Lord, may you restore
[2:01:22] the altar in each and every one of our
[2:01:23] house that now parents take take it very
[2:01:27] importantly, Lord Jesus,
[2:01:30] to sit down together their children
[2:01:32] around them
[2:01:35] and teach them Bible stories.
[2:01:37] Lord, protect those kids too, Lord, when
[2:01:40] they go to schools. Lord, parents, they
[2:01:42] can do as much as they can.
[2:01:45] But Lord, you are the greatest father,
[2:01:47] Lord Jesus, because you said that a
[2:01:50] mother can't even forget her own king,
[2:01:52] but you can never forget your children,
[2:01:55] Lord Jesus. Father Lord, I pray that you
[2:01:57] give your mercy and your grace to this
[2:01:59] church.
[2:02:00] That heavenly father Lord, I pray that
[2:02:02] the parents of this church be the best
[2:02:04] parents in the city of Deon.
[2:02:07] I pray that the parents in this church
[2:02:09] be the best parents in the state of
[2:02:11] Iowa, Lord Jesus.
[2:02:13] Why? Because we have received the light.
[2:02:16] We have received the message. And the
[2:02:18] Bible says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my
[2:02:20] feet.
[2:02:22] Guide us, Lord Jesus." Bless this
[2:02:25] church. Bless the pastor. Bless his
[2:02:28] family. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
