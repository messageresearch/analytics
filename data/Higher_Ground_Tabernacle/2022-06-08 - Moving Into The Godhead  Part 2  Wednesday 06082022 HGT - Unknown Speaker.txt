[Music] hallelujah as we stand we get right into the word of god i didn't know i was going to sing but i just felt like it i think my brother put me in that mold when he started singing into the chamber i love that song and there's one sister who can sing it that's sister marilyn brown and she's about 90 something years old might be 100 now but she's got a voice like a canary and she sings the whole thing and she takes me from earth to glory that's all i can say and i know when i get to heaven and she's there by god's grace i know she will be there brother brandon even told her that he saw her walking the streets of gold what an assurance so i'm trusting when she get there she at least do me one song god is good to us and we are blessed people the bible says there's no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit i can't tell you and i keep referring back to brother ben's message how god knows our weaknesses and how he cares that was a turning point for me and and ever since then i have been floating i've been just really happy in jesus throughout the day i have my trials like everybody else but i have a peace there is no fear that god is going to punish me or throw me away or reject me he loves us and he cares for us as we turn let us turn to colossians 2. we'll begin to read there we're trying not to be long by god's grace we know we spent a little time in singing glad to have everybody here tonight when it comes down to god doing great things um i don't know how to say it but uh i know that he he's he's faithful and i depend on him for everything knowing that he lives in me you know we we've always said it we've always quoted it you know with the tabernacle of god and the housing of god and god dwells in us but it's another thing when you begin to recognize it and i address him in the way he would want to be addressed because a king is a king and he doesn't want you to look at the audience and say o king he wants you to look at him and say o king and so in order for you to do that you've got to know where the throne room is and the throne room is within your heart excuse me and when you see and understand it it feels a little funny at first but after a while it becomes a reality i'm not prone to different things but i from that point on i've been seeing something that i cannot explain moving on the inside of me and i'm glad that god has been merciful to me i trust that god will be merciful to all of us we're we're trying and not just trying but we're moving toward the translation you know let us not stumble at his coming or how he's going to come and when he's going to come and we know that something has taken place and what has taken place will connect us in a way that he himself will interpret you understand what i'm saying and and that's what i'm looking at i'm not saying he's not coming i'm not saying you know there's not another event but i do know one thing that this event leads to the next and i want to be in order for us to be a part of the next event we must be a part of this one it's so easy to miss him because god always reveals himself in such a simple way to most of the people misses him you know and i don't want to miss him it's just i'll say it like this we've been in this message so long and let me read the scripture and let you sit down sorry colossians two beginning at the ninth verse it may sound like i'm being critical i am not i'm just saying i have been a part of things that i won't i want to uh and god is freeing me uh from the system or systematic worship colossians 2 9-10 says for in him dwell is all the fullness of the godhead bodily now do we understand that all all authority uh the prophet god said david was christ moses was christ abraham was christ and he says all of the fullness all that they were were compiled and put into one body and that was jesus christ and if that be the truth that means the bride is part of that godhead because she is a part of christ and ye are complete is that what he just said and you are complete in him which is the head of all principalities and power let us pray dear heavenly father god we come before you lord and we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us lord and we thank you lord for all that you have done for us you have done so many things and words cannot express our gratitude in your lovely name we thank you lord jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated when you think about the godhead it let me let me say like this it was the roman catholic church that divided the godhead into three persons up until then the godhead was one and that was the lord jesus christ whether we want to recognize it or not paul never wrote a sign on his back and says listen i'm part of the godhead because we must understand what godhead means it means divine nature it means the essence of the nature of god in the individual and paul said listen it's not i but christ that live in me so paul wasn't giving him his flesh any honor or glory but he was definitely telling you that the christ that died and that was crucified and that created all things is now the one who's living in my tabernacle see the nature of god when the nature of god is existing in a person it places him in the godhead because it's not the person is god in the man god was in christ god is in his bride y'all get it so a lot of time when you start talking about godhead many of us want to go back to the trinitarian way of looking at it and that's wrong that's wrong when paul talked about the godhead this is what he said that the fullness of the godhead dwelt in him is that right and brother branham comes along and tells us that we were with him before the world began we were with him we was in him we was his thoughts we as his attributes and now we come in this day to prove that we were amen and how you prove that is not you proving it it's god proving it through you by anointing you and accepting you i read the quote last week or sunday when i read this i talked about stephen and steven didn't do any great miracles but he did something that was phenomenal in the sense that he had such a life that it literally made those who did not have the life hate him and they stoned stephen but watch the christ that comes out of him the same almost identical words that jesus said on the cross father forgive them for they know not what they do others out of the vessel of stephen and says lord hold these things not to their charge see christ under the same pressure reacts in the same way and so you and i must understand that we can never make it to heaven in religion or with religion these are the things that jesus tried to explain to the pharisees and the sadducees of his day the religious so-called christians in their day because they were so interested in the systematic way of worshiping cleaning the cup or cleaning or washing the outside and leaving the inside filthy and jesus said no no no it's the inside out as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so we know how god is bringing us to a place and listen you're groaning don't think that you know you're groaning at something bad it's really good it's an excellent thing to thirst for righteousness it's an excellent thing to groan to be holy or to be righteous no matter how many times you fail no many times you fall amen there's something in you that's saying lord i want to be better do you understand what that is that's eternal life that's not a devil in you that's god in you that seed has been quickened in you this is where i believe the a lot of believers have misunderstood the message for their day uh because we fail to see that we must meet the criterias of this age and the age of this the the criteria of this age is divine love is to receive the capstone and you know this is what paul said we prophesy in part we we knew in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect it's come showing that god would bring a word that would bring us to perfection remember i read the quote the other day and i could read it to you now but i'm i'm pressed for time where brother branham said he he was not the one who who would forerun the coming of the lord he said but it was his message that would forerun the coming now i want you to think about that meditate on what he's saying because the message must live the message is not words on a page you understand me the message itself must live and brother adam said the message and the messenger is one they are one and so you saw what is the message that literally foreruns the coming of christ it comes in the form of the bride it comes in the form of rebecca because when eliezer stepped off the scene rebecca stepped on you understand me and she was the one who met isaac oh come on somebody so you must understand amen the message that four runs amen uh comes after uh malachi 4 is the bride of jesus christ she becomes the message like elijah to elisha you understand me see and this is where we we may have had it in our heads but unless you understand where you are in your position you'll miss it we have such a lack of understanding amongst the believers we believe that if we believe in a prophet if we believe and and i say these things because i have to say them and i'm not trying to cause controversies but my truth the truth shall make us free we're not to be like parrots and just say what brother branham say we must have the revelation of it see the message in itself is on books and tapes anybody can get it anybody can read it and you can see what people have done with it because they lack understanding of what it was being said you can see the camps that have been formed under the same message that we say we read in here but it's a lack of understanding this is not a time to fight no sir this is not a time to fight this is a time to grow this is a time that god has allotted for the bride of jesus christ to mature right remember god rebuked galatians says you you can't know because you're fussing and fighting what does this dispute come that's among you so your children and when you see people fighting in the message over doctrines and things like that they do not understand what this message has come for we lead that over to laodicea to do that but when we come into this message we come into a complete true brotherhood and brotherhood comes by baptism of the holy spirit we are baptized into one body by one spirit hallelujah i'm feeling pretty good tonight coming from the message easter seal look what brother says but he that understandeth he that knoweth his place in this hour he that heareth my word and believe on him that sent me half present ten eternal life when you understand your position and your place in this hour it's not oh i'm brian everybody can say that because everybody is saying that but to know your position would to be like esther to know that you're able to bring changes you're not just a figurehead but you're married to the king and the authority in which he has he has given unto you see that's what we must understand listen aren't you tired i said this the other day god is not in this deadness that we call message god is fire and he never took away the power of the holy ghost listen to the message east cecile brother brown said no no no don't you ever forget it we need the holy ghost and without the holy ghost you'll not make a rapture it's not it doesn't matter how much you have in your head is what you have in your soul what's radiating from your soul what's preaching and constantly controlling you it is your control power it is the things when you go get ready to do wrong it says don't do it it is the thing that when you when you're not certain of things it puts that funny feeling over you and the prophet god said whenever that comes whenever there's a little ounce of doubt he says when you want to do something he says don't do it because he the holy ghost is a sure voice it's a clean voice it's a voice that will uh tell you exactly what you need to do so you and i must understand he said he that understand he that understandeth his place when i saw this about shouting i i i tell you what i'm like there it is understanding your place but we got so many people looking back and we're working with brother brandlyn's place it ain't his place anymore it's the bride's position and people get upset let them get upset they got to get upset i wish i could say it rough enough for them to really think about what i'm saying because the truth of the matter is you got to move forward you can't stay where you look at what they've done and i don't want to call no names but now people are having revivals jumping and shouting and running and everything else just like the pentecostals casting out devils all that's good but jesus said don't rejoice in those things rejoice because your name is written and i'm not saying anything is wrong with those things we need those things this listen they pretty much put us to shame because we say we're the bride and where is it one thing we do know brother branham said the same anointing that anoints the wheat anoints the tear and he said in the parable he said they both praise god so something's wrong the anointing that comes with the word is supposed to strike you to an excitement this is not a classroom this is where god meets us as a church and there is liberty here but we've been so confined by doctrines and whatever you want to call it church order and and you'll find out that brother branham never instituted a lot of that stuff it was men who came after him that made books that bind us back up again do i know what i'm talking about absolutely i do and that's why people can't do they can't love each other they got so many laws you can't do this you can't do this you can't do this you can't do that and folks i think about jesus christ he he was he was under the same pressure you're going to let that woman wash your feet are you going to hang out with the publicans and sinners you see what i'm saying and that's what happens you can't even you can't even have or try to witness to somebody who's not a believer because somebody's going to think evil of you what nonsense is that let's move on am i right or wrong glory to god ain't god good let me finish this quote my word and and you know he he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me half president eternal life shall not come into the judgment but has already passed from death unto life then when this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential of the earnestness of you being quickened from mortal to immortality what is he saying basically you're already in it it's already quicken you from death into life and once you come into life you can't die no more because it is his life and not yours but we don't see what we supposed to be doing the truth of the matter is we're supposed to be dying and rotting to all of our thoughts and ideas because i said last week amen when you let the eternal life push out the cosmic light the more the cosmic light which is this worldly light that that you were born with if the eternal light pushes uh this cosmic light out of you guess what happened you become him everything about you become eternal except this flesh and then one day he's going to make that right but don't you want to be just like him amen i don't care what it takes you said what brother what are you saying yes i'm still struggling but i see little by little i'm conquering the land by his grace i am an overcomer let me say that again when the spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you you see it is the potential of your eternal inheritance that god thought of you and made for you and made for you before the foundation of the world this that is your potential and you know what i'm trying to say the foolish virgin had potential so potential is good but the seed must be quickened it must be fire you must in this last day have all and extra oil listen now since i've seen and i'm seeing i'm pushing i'm pressing and i'm praying more than anything else you say oh i don't see you on your knees you don't have to i am the temple i've tried to do what they want us to do and i i say these things and i'm trying to awake all of us i'm not trying trying to preach a new message i'm preaching what brother branham intended us for us to see it's a shame this is why he said there's going to be only a few that make a rapture because a few people are going to understand their position and what they need to do in this hour this is not about church this is not about fame this is not about fortune this is about christ coming into the very image and likeness of christ and we need to focus on that amen everything else will take its place everything but look how many years brother branham had gone and let me ask you something what has been the great change tell me do you know any great ones no because first of all there aren't any but i fee i hear now that people are calling each other great and all this kind is that nonsense and because a man has a great deliverance a preaching i can show you some pentecostal preaching that can put circles around us but listen where is the change this is the message from the shekinah glory so god in the glory is supposed to bring change without your helping your emphasis is useless in the shekinah glory all you got to do is the prophet of god said lay in the presence of the son let god bake all the greenery out of you what is that staying before the word staying in prayer fast or whatever you need to do but lay there don't move let god take it all out of you and once he takes it all out it's done when we thinking about bringing forth true life of christ right we ought to be because that's what the life is supposed to be brother brandon was no fake huh before he was converted he tried to kill a few boys right but once he was converted his life changed all you saw was christ you understand me so conversion brings a change a change of attitude a change of way of thinking behavior it does and then you know what it doesn't happen overnight that's the thing it takes time and that's what we don't have much of we do not have a lot of time if not now i ask a question to the audience if not now then when what are we waiting on we waiting on russia to bomb or we waiting you know we everybody when kamala wore the purple oh they got excited but there was no change nobody got on fire did they when they bombed 911 uh the the the towers up there no nobody got excited it was just an emotion for a moment and the things that we think gonna bring about a change will not historical events being made clear by prophecy will never cause you to repent you might get excited but that's not what's going to bring you to repentance is believing the word of god hearing the word of god and saying yes lord i'm the one in need of prayer that's where the prayer the change comes we're always placing it in the future it's coming it's coming it's here you think that god opened this beautiful word oh my god open this beautiful word amen and for us just to sit back and say oh praise god we're going to make a pentecostal church out of it because that's what we've done we don't call ourselves bishops or elders but we got a hierarchy in it don't tell me it's not true i know it's true i don't want to be part of none of that i'm not a part of any of that but that's what's going on and people are so blind they can't see it i remember the one time a church came uh one of the sisters in my church she and i said this before many times she said she got mad with me brother brooks why you why do you always have those no-name preachers preaching for you you know what i said it's the no-name preachers who can still hear from god it's the no-name preachers who come to preach and they're not in competition with nobody because they want to surrender to the voice of god and she never bothered me again but she didn't stay to my church she she moved to a named preacher and that name preacher did what backstage on the message don't even believe the message anymore you understand me what is a name there's only one name that's supposed to be exalted at this hour and that is the name of the lord jesus christ him only and when you do anything out other than that you're in idolatry you can literally worship yourself is this okay i know it sounds like i'm fussing but i don't mean to sound this way i'm saying we're we're moving into maturity we want to put away all the childish he see and all that and they did this to me 10 years ago and i never forgave get off get off that horse that horse is running you straight to hell you this how can you say you're a christian and you can't forgive christians forgive why because christ won't let you have peace until you make it right no matter what comes your way i don't care if they slap you in your face you still got to forgive them oh i feel like shouting here you look at these people and and and this is what uh everything is getting you know people oh we're having revival revival revival and you understand what i'm saying they're having a good time i've been to a lot of those revivals they they have a good time but let me tell you something i've witnessed a real true revival when i lived in lima god brought people off the street everywhere and they were changed they were filled with the holy ghost and i didn't have to preach to them any clothesline religion god by the way of the holy ghost taught those people how to dress we had people come in with purple hair and jewel in their nose and tongue they had britches that were so wide one leg was about that wide i didn't have to say nothing i just kept preaching the anointing kept falling and god kept changing and they stand today so i know it's real i've seen god amen preaching and the holy ghost fall one brother we call him cookie the holy ghost fell on him that sunday i think it was uh and he he began to sing in in in the spirit and everything else and i think what two weeks or less more or less uh he went home to meet the lord 30 years old i saw god clean him up i went to his house he had his own bar with all kind of lick and wine and the next time i go about all of that was gone i never told him what to do the holy spirit see i've seen it nobody can't tell me it's not real it's real i'm not declaring i'm where i should be but i'm trying to say i'm moving forward and i'm telling everybody come follow with me because i'm following jesus christ he's the same yesterday today and forever don't let nobody take your liberty away from you you feel like shouting you feel like dancing speaking in tongues whatever the case may be we're so afraid to let go and let god criticism going to come they're going to call you holy roller they're going to call you crazy i'm at the world no i'm coming at the church i'm telling my people here i want to see people get cut loose i really do but anyway let me read this quote you love the lord now i want you to understand y'all remember brother bob when he came to preach and he talked about he used that quote where brother brown said that even when jesus was on was the pillar fire he danced before the father now i don't understand that how can he dance then and won't dance now and people say oh you in your flesh what else i'm gonna be in hallelujah i'm going to shout in this flesh i'm going to dance in this flesh i'm going to pray in this flesh i'm in the flesh that's what he made me right now listen let's move on listen coming from the message easter seal he says there's only one life i want you to really hear what's being said there's only one life one eternal spirit one eternal life and that's god god alone is the eternal and then we being his children we are part of him that is the attributes of his thinking and the thought is expressed and become a word and this is what i love about it people that ain't that we've got to go lay hands on the sick everywhere and people got to go heal and heal the blind but his character that's what he said about stephen he had such a character he did no miracles but he himself was a miracle you know it shouldn't be where we got to wear a cross or or we're from a church here that draws and attract people it's supposed to be the character how many of you have drawn witches to you they come and they tell you they look at you and they know you hey that ain't you that's christ in you the light they see is not your light is eternal life and we've had that experience my wife and i but you know what i had a friend of an associate come to me i helped him in some things and you know what he said to me i'm coming to your church he said that to me today he said i believe god put me to get me together with you for more than one reason and i'm coming to your church he said i was raised catholic he said do i have to confess to you i say no and i told him what he needed to do he said oh i like it that way something is drawing him i didn't invite him to church he invited himself see that's the way it's supposed to be it's supposed to be something like a magnet people begin to see things in you you don't even know they're seeing it people are attracted to you you don't even know why but it's the christ in you it's not because they think you look so good you understand me and then we being his children we are part of him that is the attribute of his thinking and the thought is expressed and become a word then each individual in here that possesses this eternal life was before the foundation of the world in god's thinking you know there was a time when you would read this people would shout they were like hallelujah but what has happened is it's become an intellectual concept it's not even here yet because the word's supposed to bring you joy no matter where and when and how hallelujah i'm not going to be long i'm almost done the thought is expressed to become a word then each individual in here that possesses this eternal life was before the foundation of the world in god's thinking now i'm going to put every one of you on in a position how many of you believe that you are sons and daughters of a daughter of god raise your hand see what you know there's a point for me doing that my point is and you've heard me say that well why don't we just get about his business let's get about god's business you understand me let's read this word and says lord what would you have me do first of all he's not going to have you do nothing until you clean up your life because you're representing him you understand me and that's the biggest thing that we all need to do we need to get every little fox that's all the vine away from us and god is more than able to do it but most of us amen must realize that we must get away from all our selfishness we are so selfish it's true that's why people don't come to church they're selfish don't even see how the church need them to be here they don't see it do you think god brought you to this message to make go stay home i don't even understand it we only have two services now and wednesdays are almost empty sunday they come in and they come in late and then they give you these attitudes like are you going to preach all day where's the holy ghost in this people say oh brother because you keep preaching like that you ain't gonna have nobody bye-bye i will all have always have somebody if it's just jesus alone hallelujah no i'm not going to spare the rod i'm not going to baby people like i've been doing in the past i'm not going to do it everybody got to take care of themselves and you know we've got a word all of us can read we can write we can comprehend yet we come to church like chickens wanting the the preacher to feed you but i've been told that eagles feed themselves and you know we we come in this place and you know i know god sent me to des moines i don't have no doubt about it i've been through a lot of stuff too but let me tell you something one thing i'm assured of is that i'm supposed to be here now i don't know what all god is going to do but i know he gives i have to give an account for everything i say and do and i love your souls i love all of your souls i do god knows that's the truth if i tell a lie from the pulpit it's only by way of ignorance but everything i see now that god shows me i'm going to bring it because i want people to make a rapture we're not here to be churchy in the form of another little system and have the prettiest this and the prettiest that that's nonsense this is let it come if it want to come but if it's going to come that way let's make sure the inner man is prettier than the church then each individual in here that possesses this eternal life was before the foundation of the world in god's thinking it's the only way it could be because you're in an attribute that's an expression of a thought that has become a word and a word has taken life and it's eternal and it's eternal now this is the thing we cannot express listen do i have the lord yes you got it what you think you're feeding on what spirit in you that's feeding off off the word it ain't a devil spirit it's the holy spirit but what it is is that we've not allowed ourselves to continue to mature we've been children for a long time and this is not the hour to remain that way you got it but you got to fight like brother adam said and like joshua god told joshua i've given you the land but you got to fight for every inch no he ain't going to just drop it in your lap you got to fight for it you got to deny yourself and that's what the word of god said the bible tells us the ones who have ceased from sin will suffer in the flesh that's the truth your flesh isn't going to let you rest until it's out of breath listen that an extended that expression of a thought has become a word and the word has taken life and it's eternal that's the reason we have eternal life it's in in the same this is what gets me listen when he says in the same principle that the great son of god the redeemer we become sons and daughters of god through that same spirit by the same for knowledge of god this is why the bible calls he calls us jesus christ himself calls us brethren amen because we're baptized by the same spirit guess what he says my father is your father and therefore it's our father god even more i'm putting it on i'm really putting on christ this is what it's all about putting on christ putting the word whatever the word say we are that's what i am no condemnation why should i worry about my faultyness in the word of faultiness what what when the word of god said he's freed me from this guilt consciousness i don't have to do pentons i don't have to go through all these changes look what i've done i've done this and the devil makes you chew that on nasty gum over and over again you get down in the prayer and you go back in in under the blood or wherever it was and you pull it back up again so you can feel like you've had a good prayer by weeping and god said get up from there you didn't say nothing to me first of all you brought up stuff i don't even remember is he real he's real but we need to get real with the word you can't be a sinner and a saint and how can you be a sinner and a saint at the same time you can't but how can you be a saint if you still see yourself as a sinner it's your man your mind and the bible says let this mind be in you you'll never be happy you're going to constantly be stressed out because of the way you think is not the way god thinks of you we you know god tired of these little pity parties we have when it comes to messiahs i'm gonna read this we never consider ourselves as this but see this is too high for the pentecostals they can't fly this high this is all about eagles now this is all about eagles now i i hope i'm talking to all eagles tonight those who can stop this chicken strut that you've been doing all these years and fly like an eagle because this is what we need to start looking at these great things and applying them to us paul brought some things and pete even said was hard to understand but those understandings came to us by way of malachi 4. don't you understand you are the whole reason for the the the sacrificed lamb hallelujah it wasn't just this that sacrificed lamb wasn't just for adam alone but it was to restore eve back to her place and the lamb of god that took the book out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne was our lamb was our sacrifice and we must understand that the message has cleaned us and cleared us up but if we don't walk in it we walk not by sight we walk by faith a revelation that i am bride and i am a overcomer and i am victorious and i will defeat the devil i am the devil's adversary not that the devil is my adversary i'm his is that right because that's the way it was with legion leader said did you come to torment me before my time it was jesus who was the devil's adversary but until then legion was the whole country's adversary you think i don't know what i'm let me say it like this look just look look at just look at the outward appearance of people showing you if they had the holy ghost they were dressed differently and i i'm working with women now because brother adam said you know the condition of the church by the way the women dress you know i've seen the skirts get so short they're all above the knee what holy ghost is telling them to do that that's not i can truly tell you that's not the holy ghost that's a spirit of lust and whether they know it or not they're deceived something's on them that makes them do that and when i was in lima they started doing that stuff i asked those sisters why are you doing it now well well i said no no no no i said if it didn't matter don't shave your legs you want somebody to see your legs you know what they you know they laughed it off but i know i knew what i was talking about i told myself you know we're so privileged we're so privileged in this age because if we go back to the law a barely a woman was considered a prostitute huh bare-legged and that's why most women when they couldn't afford stockings they had dresses all the way down to the ankle i know what i'm talking about i'm trying to help us here look at the grace of god now it's no longer touch not taste not a hand or not it's grace my unconditional love for you that's what god has given to us fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure his will to give you the kingdom i'm almost done this is my last one for messiahs the messiah paragraph 22 brother brown said then when god was made flesh and became the messiah then if we can yield ourselves to the anointed like he was we become messiahs now i want you to think about what i'm getting ready to say because the scripture says they cannot be completed without us then there's something about us that must be completed and the whole resurrection is waiting on us to understand our position and until we find our position and know who we oh my god my god my god and know who we are there'll not be a resurrection because we're holding it up understand by the grace of god even the prophet god said he was a man born out of season and and look at this as you heard me say last last sunday those tribes that were came over out of egypt came into the promised land and then decided to go back over to georgia what are we doing what are we doing in this message so much so they even cursed their children and god said because of what came out of your mouth so will your children be and you and i there's only a few people like joshua and caleb says no give me my mountain caleb said i might be an old man but i still got it and i still want it and i don't know about you amen i'm an old man as far as i'm concerned but i want my mountain i want this perfection what what god has placed in my hand i want it in my heart so it can reflect him i'm tired of me amen aren't you tired of you i'm tired of me this got to die i want all of him whatever portion is for me i want it and not to glorify myself to glorify him this message is right whether we agree with it whether we come to understand it let me tell you something god has never left himself without a witness and somebody and i hope i'm one of those somebodies somebody is going to manifest jesus christ in this day it has to be he can't come he can't unite with the church that is not in his image and his likeness he can't do it what are we going to do continue to play church that's what we're going to do you we're going to settle for just coming to church preaching singing you know dismissal and no no no the church in the new testament was active active they were so led by the spirit philip says listen god told me to go into the desert i'm going oh you can't go the meeting just started no god told me i'm going and he did see that's the kind of leadership god wants to lead his people again he wants his bride to be submissive in every way not because we're controlled by man or some kind of walls or some doctrines and we're so afraid what the message people will say what can they say i consider myself a message person but not the systematic kind not anymore i'm not going to settle for it and by god's grace you pray for me and i'll be praying for you because somebody's got to make it real it just it it makes me want to cry to see what the prophet god suffered to bring this message and look what we've done with it makes me want to cry may god help us all or where wouldn't the squeeze come whether you listen like i told somebody i said i've gone to the grocery stores and i've got some pretty beautiful oranges amen they look so pretty outside and you squeeze them and no juice in them and to be honest with you that's what a lot of people in this believers have become dried up fruit but pretty on the outside y'all know that's true and ain't nothing worse than a dried up orange smelling good some of y'all have you ate the spirit you've ever had it like what is this i'm almost done let me read this then we then when god was made flesh and became the messiah then if we can yield ourselves to to be that anointed like he was we become messiahs little lights that's what the church is supposed to be lights little anointed ones that god that's god's church and i'm like where's the anointing i look for the anointing church when i'm preaching and it's just a few people that got a little something something i mean not all some got more than another you know what i'm saying but the reaction of the where's the anointing i mean you you don't even see something you don't even see humanity responding more or less the anointing he's standing light his standing light is the light of messiah you hear what he said oh mike did y'all hear what i just did you hear this i'm going to say it again let's put it this way his standard in this day is the messiah light the light of the messiah the anointing of the messiah on his people that's his standard that's the holy ghost for today hallelujah still got all of the things working with her the discernment the gifts everything we didn't die we steal the tree we're still the bride tree people say well that's for yesterday is that not denominationalism when they do that they cut god off by doing that that's just what all the other ages did prior to them is this not restoring and don't let a sister get all excited the only thing god said a sister can't have and that was to preach yes the line ought to be hot tonight because it's true we don't shut them down and we don't even know whether they're gifted or not because they ate just like everybody else afraid god won't use you and you're afraid if he can't get you to to work with the with the little thing how you expect for him to move you to higher higher heights anoints you you know to clap your hand or to jump up or to do whatever and you're afraid to do it well how do you think he's going to take you any further can't even trust you with that little emotion are you ashamed the word of god says there will be many who would be ashamed of him brother madam said he preached a message ashamed of him his standing light to light his standing light is the light of messiah risen christ in his people that's what people are so supposed to see risen christ everybody's got the right words but everybody doesn't have the anointing risen christ in his people the anointed ones carrying forth his light into all the church ages sometimes it's almost go goes sometimes it almost goes completely out then it comes back again oh my god because that's what i'm seeing it's almost out but he said then it comes back again god's anointed one god's messiah church if messiah means the anointed ones and means king then if church is anointed by the messiah spirit it becomes a lesser but still the messiah because it has his light reflecting his power reflecting his glory reflecting his dominion so it is messiah oh how it reflects him in his kingdom in his domain amen god is real okay romans 8 18-31 i'm gonna let you go on this for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestations of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who have subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth in travailleth in pain to the other unto now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruit of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to the wit the redemption of our body now he said we've got the earnest but that urn is even with the holy ghost you're still groaning for what the adoption but what for a long time we thought oh we got the holy ghost it's it no no you've got to grow into it and he grows into you that's the scripture paul said grow in growing grow up into christ that's what he said for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen un that is seen is not hope for what man seeth why does he yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it i'm gonna wait until my change come likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for see god is so perfect even when you don't know what to pray for or how to pray the spirit of god prays for you hallelujah i'm almost done i know some of y'all tired he that searches the heart knoweth what is in the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercessions for the saints according to the will of god and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god to them who are the call according to his purpose here i am lord for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that we might be the first born among many brethren moreover he did predestinate them he he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified so what shall we say to these things if god before us who can be against us let's stand ain't god good to give us so many blessings undeserving that's what we are we ought to thank him woo loving praise a little more today [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] that's what we are oh all the time
