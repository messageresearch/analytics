[0:02] amen Revelation chapter 5 we're going to
[0:04] read verses
[0:05] 1-7 just do a little bit of reading here
[0:08] I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[0:10] on the throne a book written within and
[0:13] on the backside sealed with Seven Seals
[0:16] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[0:18] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[0:21] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[0:23] and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth
[0:25] neither under the Earth was able to open
[0:27] the book neither to look thereon
[0:30] and I wept much because no man was found
[0:33] worthy to open the book and to read the
[0:34] book neither neither to look thereon and
[0:37] one of the elders saith unto me weep not
[0:41] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[0:43] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[0:45] the book and to loose the SE the Seven
[0:48] Seals
[0:50] thereof and I beheld and low in the
[0:52] midst of the throne and of the four
[0:54] beasts and in the midst of the elders
[0:56] stood a lamb as it had been
[0:58] slain having seven horns and seven eyes
[1:01] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[1:03] forth into all the Earth and he came and
[1:05] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:07] him that sat upon the throne amen let's
[1:10] turn over to Revelation
[1:11] 10 you know what let's just actually
[1:13] let's just go to 1 Corinthians 15 we
[1:15] just go back to there we'll read
[1:17] Revelation 10 a little bit
[1:19] later by the grace of
[1:23] God 1 Corinthians 15
[1:34] trust everybody had a good week by the
[1:37] grace of God a lot of people are
[1:39] traveling I know my wife wishes she was
[1:42] one of them right now Sister Lindsay
[1:44] really likes her
[1:47] vacations but you know unfortunately all
[1:50] of life can't be a
[1:52] vacation but the praise the Lord for
[1:54] those little periods that we get of it
[1:56] amen 1 Corinthians 15 and we're going to
[1:58] read verses 15 through
[2:02] 54 said now this I say Brethren that
[2:05] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[2:06] kingdom of God neither doth corruption
[2:08] inherit incorruption behold I show you a
[2:11] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[2:13] shall be be all be changed in a moment
[2:16] in the twinkling of an eye at the last
[2:17] Trump for the trumpet shall sound and
[2:20] the dead shall be raised Incorruptible
[2:22] and we sh we shall be changed for this
[2:24] in for this corruptible must put on
[2:26] incorruption and this Mortal must put
[2:29] put on
[2:30] immortality so when this corruptible
[2:32] shall have put on incorruption and this
[2:35] Mortal shall have put on immortality
[2:37] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[2:40] that is written death is swallowed up in
[2:42] Victory amen let's just read the rest of
[2:44] this we all know this but oh death where
[2:46] is thy sting oh grave where is thy
[2:48] Victory The Sting of death is sin and
[2:51] the strength of sin is the law but
[2:53] thanks be to God which give us giveth us
[2:56] the victory through our Lord Jesus
[2:57] Christ amen let's just bad
[3:00] prayer Lord Jesus we just Lord we come
[3:04] to you this morning Father we are in
[3:06] need of you more than we ever have been
[3:08] Lord Lord every day we're in need of you
[3:11] and father we just ask right now that
[3:12] you just be with us in this place this
[3:14] morning I pray Lord God that you just
[3:17] manifest yourself to us this morning
[3:19] through your word Lord speak to our
[3:21] hearts Lord and help us to receive
[3:24] exactly that which we have need of Lord
[3:26] may we be in expectation to hear from
[3:28] you lord lord we don't have Lord we have
[3:32] nothing of ourselves to bring Lord but
[3:34] just as that little that little boy who
[3:36] had the Fish and Loaves Lord we're just
[3:38] bringing what we have and we know Lord
[3:40] that you're more than able to multiply
[3:42] those things oh God to the people so we
[3:44] just pray right now oh God that your
[3:46] people are hungry Lord for your word
[3:48] Lord we pray as that as you did Lord by
[3:51] that seed on that day when you fed those
[3:53] 5,000 Lord when you fed the 7,000 Lord
[3:56] that you would just bless this bread
[3:58] Lord of life and multiply it to your
[4:00] people bless all those that are
[4:02] traveling Lord and those that aren't
[4:04] able to be here we thank you for all
[4:06] those ones Lord God and we just pray
[4:08] that your angels Lord would just encamp
[4:11] about them and keep them s safe on their
[4:12] Journeys and we just thank you for it in
[4:14] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[4:17] amen you may be
[4:19] seated we just want
[4:22] to speak a message this morning if we
[4:25] can just just want to title it
[4:27] redemptions can you turn that down just
[4:29] a little bit
[4:31] maybe it just where my mouth is all of a
[4:33] sudden I get an echo out of it uh we
[4:35] just want to speak a message this
[4:37] morning redemption's true power and then
[4:41] I know brother Brooks likes to some come
[4:42] sometimes put like a little subtitle and
[4:44] brother brandham did it so if we could
[4:46] put maybe a little subtitle to this as
[4:48] well just uh we want to put a a subtitle
[4:51] to it know know thy
[4:54] enemy amen because you know I really
[4:58] feel
[5:01] that you know as we look through the
[5:03] word if we could really grasp in our
[5:05] hearts what the word is really telling
[5:07] us about who we
[5:08] are that you know there wouldn't be a
[5:11] feeble one in this
[5:13] place that Victory would be something
[5:16] that
[5:17] isn't uh we say a rare thing it would be
[5:21] a Perpetual Victory because the people
[5:23] of God are meant to live Victorious
[5:26] lives the people of God were designed
[5:30] and built we were created and ordained
[5:35] to live a life of perfect Victory you
[5:38] know and so many times you know the
[5:40] reason we want to talk if we could give
[5:42] that subtitle know thy enemy because so
[5:44] many times we're looking everywhere at
[5:48] our enemies whether it be our enemies
[5:50] you know we have enemies maybe at our
[5:51] jobs and our schools or wherever we're
[5:54] going maybe even in our family we it
[5:56] seems like we have enemies but really
[5:59] when it it comes down to it the only
[6:01] true enemy that we have we know it's the
[6:05] devil but we I want to bring this closer
[6:06] to home the only true enemy that we have
[6:08] is
[6:09] ourselves the only true enemy that we
[6:12] have in this life is this flesh that
[6:15] we're wearing right
[6:17] now they and this is bringing it down to
[6:20] the to the to the very basics of things
[6:23] that people have missed all through you
[6:25] know we have in this age especially with
[6:28] the denominational that's around the
[6:30] world and this this supposed this social
[6:34] type of gospel to where the preaching of
[6:37] the word has become more of a self-help
[6:40] guide you know you have these different
[6:42] ministers in their mega churches they're
[6:45] they're more busy writing books than
[6:48] they are trying to really preach the
[6:50] gospel to the people and you find out
[6:53] that their their gospel is more of a a
[6:56] self-help kind of a religion it's just
[6:59] of you know maintain this positive
[7:01] attitude and it'll get you through life
[7:03] and all these things and don't get me
[7:05] wrong we know that the prophet brother
[7:07] brand he preached about keeping that
[7:09] positive attitude in your mind that's a
[7:11] that's a very important thing and
[7:13] there's nothing wrong with those things
[7:15] but if we fail to realize where your
[7:17] real enemy lies you know they the they
[7:20] want to preach a mind over matter type
[7:23] of gospel when when it doesn't matter
[7:26] how much you have this gospel in your
[7:28] mind if this gospel is not settled in
[7:32] your heart and you don't have a true
[7:35] revelation of who you are and who your
[7:39] enemy really is then you're not going to
[7:41] get anywhere with Christ because this
[7:44] enemy that we're talking about isn't
[7:46] some isn't Some Devil that's just
[7:48] floating around in the skies it's not
[7:51] just the people at your job that
[7:52] irritate you or don't like
[7:55] you and it's not just your family that
[7:58] treats you like a crazy person because
[8:00] you believe this message your true enemy
[8:04] is your
[8:06] flesh every day that you wake up your
[8:09] enemy is your flesh the scripture says
[8:12] that every day you wake up the spirit
[8:14] lusteth against the Flesh and the flesh
[8:16] against the spirit so that you cannot do
[8:18] the things that you ought to do see when
[8:22] we go back to the Garden of Eden we find
[8:24] that there was a battle already had
[8:26] taken place in heaven BR I I love the
[8:28] way brother Brooks minist
[8:30] about it just recently and he talked
[8:32] about how the battle in heaven had
[8:33] already been settled see Satan had no
[8:37] more place in heaven now he's allowed to
[8:38] go up there and accuse the Brethren
[8:40] right now and we find in the end of
[8:42] Revelation here that he's going to be
[8:44] kicked out completely but see God allows
[8:47] this period of time for him to accuse
[8:50] because there's got to be a battle God
[8:52] is an overcomer and in order for him to
[8:54] overcome there's got to be something for
[8:56] him to overcome and it's the same thing
[8:58] in our lives but we see in the Garden of
[9:00] Eden that there was a battle that took
[9:02] place and there was and what it was was
[9:05] a battle for the soul of a
[9:07] man Satan wanted what God had remember
[9:12] he said he would exalt his throne above
[9:15] the stars of God and the stars of God
[9:17] are nothing but you and I the children
[9:19] of God that's nothing but us the
[9:24] children of God and Satan's entire
[9:26] objective see Satan
[9:29] wanted to prove to God that he could
[9:32] usurp his God's kingdom That's what
[9:36] Satan wanted to do see we find out that
[9:39] we find out Satan's motives there that
[9:42] Satan said I want to prove to God that
[9:44] I'm more powerful than God that's what
[9:47] his goal has been from the very
[9:49] beginning and that's what his goal is in
[9:51] your life every day through your flesh
[9:54] is to try to prove to you that your
[9:57] flesh is more powerful than God because
[10:01] that's what he did in the beginning
[10:03] because see what but Satan but Satan
[10:05] even though he thought he was so
[10:06] intelligent and smart but the problem
[10:09] was he he didn't know the scriptures
[10:11] quite because the scripture says that
[10:13] God would take the wise in their own
[10:15] craftiness see Satan thought he was so
[10:17] smart when he was able to get Adam and
[10:20] Eve to fall not realizing that that was
[10:23] completely in the plan of God from the
[10:25] beginning see Satan has never been
[10:27] anything but a pawn in the hand of of
[10:29] God and what happened was
[10:33] see see
[10:35] Adam probably I I don't know you know we
[10:38] don't know very the mind of what was
[10:40] going on in the mind of Adam but
[10:42] something tells me that Adam really
[10:44] didn't even know what he was doing when
[10:46] he took Eve back but I I I but there's
[10:50] something in me that tells me that the
[10:53] thought that kept going through his mind
[10:55] was that he didn't have the choice see
[10:58] because we know
[11:00] that Eve
[11:02] sinned but Adam did it
[11:05] willingly see Eve knew the Commandment
[11:08] of God and willingly she was she was
[11:11] trapped into it she she was basically
[11:14] ignorant she was completely
[11:16] confused she was trapped into
[11:18] it but Adam willingly went out and took
[11:22] her back
[11:25] willingly according to what we would see
[11:27] disobeyed the Commandment of
[11:30] God and took back
[11:32] Eve but what we failed see so many times
[11:35] we put the blame on Adam and we don't
[11:37] even realize he had no
[11:41] choice he had to do what he did he had
[11:45] no choice you say oh he had a choice he
[11:48] had no choice Adam was a carbon copy
[11:54] spiritually of God came if we could say
[11:58] it this way he came directly out of the
[12:00] loins of God
[12:02] himself and see there had to be a first
[12:05] Adam and there had to be a last Adam the
[12:07] last Adam was the one that had to bring
[12:10] life and the first Adam was the one that
[12:13] had to bring a breach but you see it had
[12:17] to be I'm using that word had to be
[12:19] because it had to there was no choice
[12:22] for Adam see if you listen to what
[12:25] brother Brooks was preaching just the
[12:26] other day you found out that God
[12:30] he was he was trapped into doing what he
[12:34] did by his own
[12:36] word when when Abraham I know you I know
[12:41] everybody's probably trying to keep up
[12:42] right now but I believe it's going to
[12:43] strike when we really get down to it
[12:46] because we got to see how fixed all this
[12:48] stuff
[12:50] is and when you can get it completely F
[12:53] when you realize when the Lord and see
[12:55] that's where I think we are because even
[12:56] you know we've heard the quote from the
[12:58] church age book you know if you could
[12:59] get a true revelation of who you are
[13:01] what the bride stands for and that she
[13:02] can do the greater work she be an
[13:03] invincible Army the problem is the
[13:05] Revelation has not struck yet because if
[13:09] if you see there is such a freedom in
[13:13] Christ now not the freedom that the
[13:16] world teaches now this isn't a freedom
[13:18] to sin this isn't the I can just go do
[13:22] what I want and everything will be all
[13:23] right but it's a freedom from
[13:26] sin it's a freedom from
[13:30] condemnation and see this is where it
[13:32] gets really deep but it's also so simple
[13:35] because if we could realize see that no
[13:38] matter what you've
[13:40] done though it can condemn you in your
[13:42] heart if you could have a true faith in
[13:45] the blood of Jesus Christ to forgive you
[13:48] from that how much freedom is there in
[13:50] that when you can come to a real point
[13:53] I'm not talking about just letting you
[13:55] Willy nearly go do what you want to do
[13:57] because if you know if Grace does abound
[13:59] let's let it much more abound no Paul
[14:01] said you got to be wary of that because
[14:03] you see the the people see it's see
[14:06] we've almost flip-flopped when it comes
[14:09] to to the mentality of the age
[14:12] see but we're right back to where it was
[14:14] in the beginning even Paul had to preach
[14:16] against it because now it's come to the
[14:17] point where everybody has mistaken the
[14:20] freedom in Christ for the freedom to do
[14:21] whatever they want see and they did it
[14:23] in the day of Paul too that's why he had
[14:25] to preach that you know he said let's
[14:27] not sin that Grace May abound
[14:29] he he and and see that's where we're at
[14:31] now at least with the denominations see
[14:34] the denominations and and this message
[14:36] have split so far apart now in their
[14:39] mentalities that the truth is still
[14:41] somewhere in the middle because the
[14:43] people in the message think they got it
[14:44] all locked up but they're so Bound by
[14:48] legalism
[14:51] again that they can't even take the real
[14:54] see there is a real Grace and there is a
[14:59] false Grace and then there's a
[15:02] disgrace the denominations have taken
[15:06] taken that all the way to disgrace the
[15:09] denominations do whatever they want to
[15:10] they got coffee shops in their churches
[15:12] they don't care if people are running
[15:14] around doing whatever they want they
[15:16] don't even feel convicted about it but
[15:18] you see the message churches have taken
[15:20] it all the way where they don't even
[15:21] have a true revelation of real Grace
[15:23] anymore because no matter when they fall
[15:26] they can't even get back up now
[15:28] everybody in the message walks around so
[15:30] condemned because they know the word is
[15:33] right I don't think anybody here would
[15:35] deny that this word is absolutely the
[15:37] word of God and true and that this
[15:39] message brings us the true revelation of
[15:42] this word the problem is is that the
[15:46] people have gotten so beat down under
[15:48] the fact that they can't live it the way
[15:50] they want to that they can't even accept
[15:53] real Grace anymore but I'm here to tell
[15:56] you that there's a real Grace that can
[15:59] free you from
[16:01] condemnation so much so that that a man
[16:04] like Paul who was a
[16:07] murderer could walk in the midst of the
[16:09] Apostles and tell them what was going on
[16:13] because he knew that the grace of God
[16:15] was sufficient for him it wasn't about
[16:18] the fact that now he could just go do
[16:20] whatever he wanted you can even see
[16:22] throughout the scriptures how Paul
[16:24] always lamented the things that he did
[16:26] before he came to Christ but but he knew
[16:30] enough about the grace of God to see the
[16:33] true power of redemption in his
[16:37] life think about how much condemnation
[16:40] had to try to follow Paul around every
[16:43] day every time he would have gotten up
[16:46] in front of those people trying to
[16:48] preach the word of God to the people of
[16:51] God don't you think the devil was in his
[16:53] ear telling him about how he killed
[16:55] people in the church how he the
[16:58] scripture even says he talks about he
[17:00] said I caused others to
[17:04] blaspheme and you don't think that that
[17:07] followed him around and we have the same
[17:09] thing in our lives don't we you try to
[17:12] get up and do something for God you try
[17:14] to witness for God and the devil's right
[17:16] there in your mind say what about what
[17:18] you just did last week and you think
[17:20] you're able to go witness to this person
[17:23] and and we'll get ourselves down because
[17:25] we don't understand real Grace
[17:30] and the fact that it can absolutely free
[17:33] you from all
[17:36] condemnation see but back to what we
[17:39] were talking about in the garden V
[17:41] because this is where it really comes
[17:42] down to when we go to Abraham we have to
[17:46] understand what happened with Abraham to
[17:48] understand what happened in the garden
[17:50] because what happened in the garden was
[17:52] God actually showing see that what
[17:55] happened in the Garden of Eden goes
[17:56] beyond what just happened in the garden
[17:59] of Eden but what happened in the Garden
[18:01] of Eden literally showed us the entire
[18:05] Plan of Redemption right in a
[18:07] nutshell God opened up his very heart to
[18:11] us in the Garden of Eden and it wasn't
[18:14] until this age that we could really see
[18:16] that but let's talk about Abraham for a
[18:19] second to really show you what we're
[18:20] talking about because Abraham was given
[18:23] a promise that he would have a
[18:25] seed and that seed would would possess
[18:29] the gates of its enemies doesn't that
[18:30] sound familiar because God's seed
[18:34] possesses the gates of their enemies see
[18:36] all these things every single scripture
[18:38] points to Christ amen every scripture is
[18:42] showing if you can let God open your
[18:45] eyes spiritually every scripture is
[18:48] showing you what God has been wanting to
[18:51] do with you from the very beginning it's
[18:54] showing what God was planning even
[18:57] before he spoke the world and
[18:59] existence God was planning this thing
[19:02] he's always been planning this thing but
[19:04] see so let's look at it now Abraham a
[19:07] type of God
[19:09] himself a very type of God himself
[19:13] wanted to bring forth
[19:15] seeds that would possess the gates of
[19:18] their enemies that would shine like the
[19:20] stars of heaven doesn't this house sound
[19:22] familiar see the very life of Abraham
[19:24] was the life of God and he wandered
[19:27] about seemingly alone just like God
[19:31] Alone with his thoughts seemingly
[19:34] alone but he there was something that
[19:37] had to be performed a son had to come
[19:41] forth and that son did come forth though
[19:44] it took its time Joe you may take your
[19:47] time you're going to come forth but now
[19:49] look at
[19:50] it Isaac now comes out right Isaac comes
[19:56] forth and God tells Abraham you have to
[19:59] sacrifice your only
[20:02] son now I want you to think about this
[20:05] think about
[20:11] this think about
[20:15] this this stuff's getting so deep to me
[20:17] I don't even know what to do sometimes I
[20:18] hope you can see it because this is
[20:21] deeper than any of us can imagine but
[20:22] it's so simple when you can see what God
[20:25] has done and his thoughts towards you
[20:28] and
[20:30] how how impossible it is for him to lose
[20:35] you it is impossible for God to lose you
[20:40] because he told himself in the beginning
[20:44] that he was going to have
[20:46] you and he will have
[20:49] you he said I have not lost
[20:52] one he can't lose you and he won't lose
[20:57] you and I want you to see see how fixed
[20:59] it
[21:00] is because now
[21:02] Abraham brings
[21:04] Isaac now Isaac was born in
[21:09] sin see Isaac is a type if we could say
[21:13] of that first Adam because now he was
[21:16] born in sin though he was innocent at
[21:19] the time he was born in sin he was a
[21:21] sinful
[21:22] flesh and God is showing him this is I
[21:25] want you to think about it Abraham now
[21:28] typing out God waiting to bring forth
[21:30] his son he brings forth his son but now
[21:32] his son is brought forth into a sinful
[21:34] nature as Isaac didn't have a choice
[21:37] that's just the way he was brought forth
[21:39] I was born in sin shapen in iniquity
[21:41] came out of the womb speaking lies but
[21:43] now look God tells Abraham go sacrifice
[21:46] your only son doesn't that sound
[21:48] familiar that son's got to
[21:51] die death is required of him just like
[21:55] it was required of Adam
[21:58] it was required as soon as he took back
[22:00] Eve it was required of Adam to die but
[22:04] see we're talking spiritual death not
[22:06] just natural but we're typing this out
[22:08] so I want you to follow me it was
[22:10] required for Adam to
[22:13] die that was his requirement being typed
[22:16] out in Isaac now God looking at the
[22:19] situation and saying I have to sacrifice
[22:22] death has to come to my own
[22:25] son because though though we are often
[22:29] want to put Adam in a place of low
[22:31] esteem because of what happened in the
[22:33] garden he is the original Son of God in
[22:37] that
[22:39] Garden he was that the very one of the
[22:43] first fruits on the earth at least now
[22:45] Jesus Christ we know was before the
[22:46] foundation of the world but that's
[22:49] because he's all the
[22:51] fullness but now look at at this Abraham
[22:56] God in tight having to sacrific his own
[22:59] son on the
[23:02] altar but now look at this but then the
[23:06] angel comes to him and turns his
[23:08] attention right as he's about to kill
[23:10] his own son just as Adam should have
[23:14] been given death spiritually for all
[23:16] etern he should have died separated from
[23:20] God something happened the angel catches
[23:24] him and says don't touch
[23:27] him but look behind you there's a
[23:31] ram caught in a
[23:33] Thicket the horns of this Ram remember
[23:37] the horns type
[23:39] power the very power of this RAM and the
[23:42] ram is Christ
[23:45] amen caught in the
[23:48] thicket God's Own Christ's own power was
[23:54] caught himself in such a place
[23:58] now the ram was innocent the see these
[24:01] animals are innocent see this is where
[24:04] the type goes so much deeper because
[24:06] this animal was completely innocent
[24:08] that's why it can type
[24:12] Christ because it was a completely
[24:14] innocent sacrifice it had no choice it
[24:18] wasn't it wasn't guilty of
[24:21] anything see we take the type so many
[24:23] times surface deep and we say Abraham
[24:25] and then Isaac typing out the promised
[24:27] son of Christ but let's go a little
[24:29] deeper here and we see that Abraham
[24:31] being the father don't we call Abraham
[24:34] the father of the faith and who is the
[24:37] father but God so Abraham God seeing his
[24:41] son Isaac has to Die the death and yet
[24:45] here is this Ram caught by its own
[24:49] power see and we find that the scripture
[24:51] tells us all about it because the
[24:54] scripture says that God swore by himself
[24:57] for he could swear by no greater that he
[25:01] would bring these things to pass that he
[25:04] would bring the Redemption to pass and
[25:06] what was it that is the very that's the
[25:09] ram catching himself by his own
[25:14] horns God taking his word his word is
[25:18] his power
[25:19] amen and he caught himself in his own
[25:23] words he trapped
[25:26] himself don't you see see it God
[25:30] literally God to
[25:32] ensure to absolutely make sure that you
[25:37] would be redeemed he trapped
[25:41] himself by his own word because before
[25:45] the foundation of the world brother Bob
[25:47] he swore by himself that Bob Stamper is
[25:51] a Son of
[25:54] God and because he swore that oath to
[25:58] him self he can't lose
[26:01] you can I say it like this without
[26:04] sounding like I'm being sacreligious or
[26:08] anything he
[26:10] literally no matter what it takes he has
[26:13] to have
[26:14] you whether it looks like he's bending
[26:17] the rules or
[26:19] not because if you look through the
[26:21] Scripture it looks so many times like
[26:24] God is breaking his own rules I've often
[26:26] used the example of uh
[26:29] David David when he sinned with basba
[26:32] should have died he was under the
[26:36] law and yet God comes back to him and
[26:41] David pronounced the Judgment out of his
[26:42] own mouth he said that guy's going to
[26:44] die when Nathan gives him the parable of
[26:47] the man and the lamb and he says who is
[26:49] that man he's going to die Nathan says
[26:51] you are the
[26:53] man but what does he say see David
[26:55] should have died the Lord dictated that
[26:59] he him and basa should have both been
[27:01] puted outto the street and stoned to
[27:04] death caught in the act of adultery
[27:07] murder on top of
[27:10] that and bearing false witness lying to
[27:13] the
[27:14] people and yet it looked like
[27:17] God turned against his own word when he
[27:21] comes right back through the mouth of
[27:22] Nathan and says you're not going to die
[27:26] though how can he do that
[27:30] how because can you turn it down just a
[27:32] little bit it's still giving me the
[27:34] weird I don't know if you can probably
[27:35] hear it
[27:37] to but why could God do that how could
[27:42] he do that it looked like he was
[27:45] breaking his own
[27:47] words but see you got to be Eternal to
[27:51] understand this thing because from the
[27:54] foundation of the
[27:56] world God already
[28:01] dictated he already dictated and swore
[28:06] to
[28:07] himself that the Son of God Christ Jesus
[28:11] would come from the line of
[28:13] David so he couldn't
[28:19] die it couldn't
[28:23] happen do you see
[28:26] it God caught him himself by his own
[28:31] words see and if you could take this in
[28:33] your own
[28:35] life you could see who you are to God
[28:39] see that's why Adam didn't have a
[28:42] choice he had no choice because God had
[28:46] no choice and Adam whether you people
[28:49] want to believe it or not had the very
[28:52] nature of God in
[28:54] him he was born a son of God
[28:59] direct lineage out of the loins of God
[29:01] himself he had the nature that's why he
[29:04] didn't have a choice because he had to
[29:06] live that
[29:08] out and what was he showing he was
[29:10] showing that God does not have a choice
[29:13] with
[29:14] you he
[29:17] doesn't do you have a choice who your
[29:20] brothers and sisters are who were born
[29:22] to your parents you don't when you're
[29:25] growing up you may have wish you did
[29:28] there are a lot of times I wish I didn't
[29:29] have two sisters when I was
[29:33] younger I didn't like being the only the
[29:35] oldest child and a boy because I'm the
[29:37] only one that got to mow the
[29:39] lawn I didn't like that I but you don't
[29:42] have a
[29:43] choice they were bored to your
[29:46] parents and God didn't have a
[29:51] choice do you see
[29:54] that now here's what happened though
[29:57] Satan wanted prove to God that he could
[30:00] usurp his kingdom from him he Satan's
[30:04] whole thing was like you know
[30:06] what I'm GNA show that I'm just as
[30:09] powerful as God and how's he GNA do that
[30:11] I'm G to make his children do what I
[30:13] want them to do but see the problem is
[30:16] is that Satan is and always has been a
[30:20] carnal
[30:21] nature because Satan could only go Skin
[30:25] Deep he could only
[30:29] affect the
[30:30] flesh now we understand that you were
[30:34] born with a sin nature as it was you
[30:38] know brother brandham called it he said
[30:39] there was that little snake in there
[30:41] that little nature that you carried with
[30:42] you from the time you were born but I
[30:44] want you to see that the only reason you
[30:48] have that nature the only reason you
[30:51] have that nature is because you don't
[30:54] know who you are
[30:55] yet that's the only reason reason you
[30:58] have that nature because had you and
[31:02] because you were born the reason you
[31:03] don't know who you are is because you
[31:04] were born into this carnal sinful
[31:06] flesh see we're talking about knowing
[31:09] your enemy and your very enemy is your
[31:12] flesh it's the it's truly the only enemy
[31:16] you really have when the rubber meets
[31:19] the road it doesn't matter what is
[31:22] outside because the the only enemy that
[31:25] you have is your flesh because what
[31:28] happens is is that if you right now were
[31:32] to take your flesh away right now and
[31:35] give you a a redeemed body you would be
[31:40] perfect if you've been sealed with the
[31:42] Holy
[31:43] Ghost and that and that you take away
[31:46] the sinful flesh and give you a redeemed
[31:48] body you would literally be
[31:50] perfect that that would be it because
[31:53] the only thing that keeps you from being
[31:56] perfect is that flesh
[31:59] because it tells you the word's not
[32:01] right it messes with your vision and I'm
[32:03] talking spiritual vision it messes with
[32:05] your spiritual vision it messes with
[32:08] this and that because I want you let's
[32:10] look at things from a spiritual
[32:11] perspective right let's say you work in
[32:14] a place and you got a guy you can't
[32:16] stand now your flesh is telling you that
[32:19] you just don't love the guy at all you
[32:21] don't like the guy but what it's not
[32:24] telling you is what you really don't
[32:26] like is the spirit on the
[32:28] die and if if you were I'm just now
[32:31] we're using hypothetical here but this
[32:33] is nothing but the truth if you were at
[32:35] that job and you're having a trouble
[32:37] loving this person if you could take
[32:40] your sinful flesh out and replace it
[32:42] with that perfect body and all of a
[32:44] sudden you had a revelation that it
[32:46] wasn't the man but it's the spirit on
[32:48] the man you would love that man the way
[32:51] you ought to and all of a sudden you'd
[32:52] realize wait a second it wasn't him I
[32:55] was actually fighting but it was the the
[32:58] thoughts that my flesh was trying to
[32:59] make me
[33:01] believe that's what it is everything
[33:04] that we're fighting see we have it up
[33:06] here all the time we get it preached to
[33:09] all the time you know I may be you know
[33:12] a person I know may I may not I'm just
[33:14] using this an example because we all
[33:15] deal with stuff like this people that we
[33:18] know that rub us the wrong way whatever
[33:19] it might be right so I'm using this an
[33:23] example but the the flesh is telling you
[33:25] oh you just don't like that guy oh maybe
[33:26] they're a serpent SE maybe they're this
[33:28] we don't like them I don't do this or
[33:30] that but what the problem is you don't
[33:32] see that your flesh is the one feeding
[33:34] you all those
[33:38] lies that that's what it is but we'll
[33:41] make ourselves think that that's just us
[33:44] believing it when really see if you
[33:46] really want to know everybody's like
[33:47] well how do I know you know the I had
[33:50] this I had this thought you know how do
[33:52] we
[33:53] know the the nature of the devil right
[33:56] because you know they they say in order
[33:58] to fight your enemy you got it that's
[33:59] why we gave the subtitle you have to
[34:01] know your enemy right they say know your
[34:04] enemy as
[34:07] yourself and say I keep my friends close
[34:09] and my enemies even closer well you keep
[34:11] your enemy as close as it can get every
[34:14] day but if you want to know the nature
[34:18] of Satan all you have to do is listen to
[34:21] what your flesh is telling
[34:23] you because in the Garden of Eden when
[34:27] Satan went to pervert the people of God
[34:31] that's what he
[34:32] did Satan literally infused his nature
[34:37] into your
[34:39] flesh that's what it
[34:41] was because it was a carnal act see
[34:45] because Satan's a carnal
[34:47] being he could not see I don't no matter
[34:51] what Satan tried to this is where I'm
[34:53] trying to get it with this with this
[34:54] thing about knowing who you are because
[34:56] no matter what SAT tried to
[34:59] do it doesn't matter how much he
[35:03] tried how much he worked that he could
[35:07] not change the fact that Adam was a Son
[35:12] of
[35:13] God he couldn't change it see and Satan
[35:17] tries to tell us that all the time that
[35:20] he's got some magical power he doesn't
[35:24] have I don't care what he tells you if
[35:28] you're a Son of God if God has put it in
[35:31] your heart that you're a Son of God
[35:34] there is nothing that Satan can do that
[35:38] can change whether you are a son of
[35:42] God it literally cannot be
[35:46] done you can't do
[35:48] it you can't just as much as brother
[35:52] Isaac can't change the fact that he's a
[35:54] sear that's his family name he can't
[35:58] change the blood that runs in his veins
[36:00] he can't I don't care he can transfuse
[36:03] himself all he wants to he could replace
[36:06] every bit of blood in his body but you
[36:08] give it a while and the DNA that flows
[36:11] in his veins will make sure that that
[36:14] blood will testify that he's a sear
[36:18] Isaac sear that's where he's from just
[36:21] as much as brother Marshall's a
[36:25] Stamper just as much as I'm a ver
[36:28] it can't I don't care what you do you
[36:30] can't change it Satan thought he could
[36:35] the only thing he could do was corrupt
[36:37] the flesh though see and he corrupted
[36:40] the spirit in a sense to the point that
[36:44] he could deceive the people but he could
[36:47] never truly change
[36:50] you see that's W that ought to be a
[36:53] powerful statement he cannot truly
[36:57] change you the thing
[36:59] is do you recognize
[37:02] that is having the faith to believe in
[37:04] who you
[37:05] are and believing that God has the power
[37:09] to seal you away into that Kingdom
[37:13] see even the oh just I wish you could
[37:16] see that he can't change you he can't do
[37:21] it he can he can torment you as much as
[37:24] he want he tries to every day and most
[37:27] of that is because you know the only
[37:28] reason he can really torment you just
[37:29] got to be sealed away into that kingdom
[37:31] is all it is because when you're sealed
[37:32] away he can't even get to you
[37:34] anymore but many times we wander out
[37:37] there by like brother brandom said it's
[37:38] not that he comes into us we go out to
[37:40] him we start just like Eve did we start
[37:43] listen to those Lies We wander outside
[37:45] the blood we greet the holy spirit away
[37:48] from us for a season and we think that
[37:51] we've been changed into a son of the
[37:53] devil now or a daughter the daughter of
[37:55] Satan that's what the devil does but the
[37:59] thing that Satan loves is he just trying
[38:01] to he's just clouding your vision I hope
[38:03] this is all right this morning I'm
[38:05] trying to I want to give you guys hope
[38:07] here I want to give you something that
[38:09] you can latch on to here because he
[38:11] can't change who you
[38:14] are you can't change who you are God
[38:17] can't change who you are because it was
[38:20] ordained his decision from the
[38:22] foundation of the world was perfect and
[38:25] it can't be changed his mind mind was
[38:28] made up about you before you were
[38:31] born and the fact that you want to serve
[38:35] God proves who you
[38:37] are because the ones that don't have
[38:40] that desire those are the ones that
[38:42] can't serve
[38:44] him because they don't have anything in
[38:47] them to
[38:49] serve see Satan here's the thing here's
[38:52] where Satan's always blurring lines with
[38:53] us right he's switching you know that's
[38:56] what politics does a lot a lot of times
[38:57] they try to change the meaning of
[39:00] words I mean I was telling my wife I was
[39:04] on I was on uh I was watching a YouTube
[39:06] thing and they had those commercials
[39:08] they put on YouTube and you know how
[39:10] they completely changed the rainbow now
[39:12] I mean homosexual rights and they had a
[39:15] Burger King advertisement where they're
[39:18] they wrap up their Whopper in this
[39:19] rainbow paper for Gay Pride
[39:22] events and try to tell them that you
[39:24] know we're all the same on the inside
[39:27] you know it doesn't matter if you're gay
[39:28] or whatever you can do whatever you want
[39:29] to but it just see that's how Satan
[39:32] loves to turn things around and try to
[39:34] make the mean something they don't
[39:36] mean and see what Satan tries to do to
[39:39] us is he tries to make you feel like
[39:42] you're no longer a Son of God just
[39:44] because you're messed up or something
[39:46] but what he fails to what you fail to
[39:48] realize is he can't change whether
[39:50] you're a son or daughter of God he can't
[39:54] change it the only thing he can get you
[39:56] to do is is to not accept it is to try
[40:00] to mess with your mind and your thoughts
[40:02] enough to convince you that you're not
[40:06] and all that does is it keeps you away
[40:08] from the blessings that God's got for
[40:10] you because now you don't find your s
[40:13] worthy enough to have him anymore
[40:16] because he's convinced you up here of
[40:19] something that's not true in
[40:21] here he's convinced you that that you
[40:25] don't have a desire to serve God when
[40:27] you
[40:29] do a desire to serve God is one of the
[40:33] greatest things you can have just the
[40:35] fact that you have that proves you're
[40:37] not the
[40:39] Devils it is absolute proof that you're
[40:42] not of the devil like I said do you want
[40:45] to know the nature of
[40:47] Satan look at your flesh your flesh
[40:51] doesn't want to go to church your flesh
[40:52] doesn't want to pray your flesh doesn't
[40:54] want to read your Bible your flesh
[40:56] doesn't want you to witness the people
[40:57] your flesh doesn't want you to think
[40:59] about God but somewhere in your heart
[41:02] you want to think about God you want to
[41:04] go to church you want to save Souls you
[41:07] want to make a Rapture that proves those
[41:10] two Natures are
[41:12] opposite and and Satan is trying to tell
[41:15] you that the nature of your flesh is
[41:17] your nature when in reality it's his
[41:21] nature and I've preached this many times
[41:24] but what a lot of people don't know is
[41:26] what happen to
[41:28] Calvary is that is that God see at one
[41:32] time Satan had a free roam between this
[41:35] flesh and your soul to go back and forth
[41:38] and and really try to corrupt you but at
[41:41] Calvary when Christ died on the cross he
[41:44] severed that connection that connected
[41:48] the nature of your flesh to the nature
[41:50] in your soul and then God came along
[41:53] with the Holy Ghost and even doubly
[41:56] cemented the the power of it by sealing
[41:59] your soul away with the Holy Ghost so
[42:01] now it's an impenetrable Fortress that
[42:03] Satan can't
[42:05] touch and what the devil all he tries to
[42:08] get you to do is he tries to confuse you
[42:09] and he tries to tell you that your flesh
[42:12] nature is your nature but it's not your
[42:15] nature it's his
[42:17] nature your flesh's nature is literally
[42:21] the nature of Satan
[42:23] himself that that's what it is because
[42:26] when he allow when he ejected himself
[42:29] into the human race through the serpent
[42:31] he literally forced his nature into the
[42:35] into the flesh because it was a fleshly
[42:38] act see that's why Satan always thought
[42:40] he was so smart he thought he was so
[42:44] smart because he tricked Eve into doing
[42:46] what she did carnally not realizing that
[42:50] the the carnal flesh is not heir to the
[42:54] kingdom
[42:56] anyhow flesh and blood can inherit
[42:59] that's why we read that Flesh and Blood
[43:01] can't inherit it anyhow see he he knew
[43:04] the word but he never believed the word
[43:07] so he thought he could corrupt the seed
[43:09] of God through the flesh but it's not
[43:12] the flesh that matters anyway it was the
[43:15] soul the whole time and it's something
[43:18] that Satan can't
[43:22] touch it it's see if remember that that
[43:27] seed in you is literally a piece of God
[43:30] it's a piece of the
[43:32] word it doesn't matter how many versions
[43:35] of the word Satan tries to come up with
[43:37] NIV RSV all these different versions
[43:39] they got you know all different things
[43:42] they got it doesn't matter how many
[43:44] versions Satan could come up with he
[43:46] still can't corrupt the true
[43:49] word because the word isn't letters
[43:52] written on pages the word is literally
[43:55] life it
[43:58] and you can't corrupt
[44:00] life you can't do it it can't be done
[44:04] life because God himself is
[44:08] life he is the only true sort life
[44:13] cannot be contained it cannot be stopped
[44:16] and it cannot be held
[44:20] back and that's what Satan tries to tell
[44:22] you though is that somehow he's
[44:24] corrupted your soul through your flesh
[44:26] but you believe this word if you can
[44:29] receive the holy GH that's why the Holy
[44:31] Ghost is so important because what the
[44:33] Holy Ghost does is it allows you to have
[44:36] a real Revelation that he cannot
[44:39] penetrate your soul
[44:42] anymore he can't do it because he Satan
[44:47] cannot corrupt that seed that's inside
[44:49] you anymore than he can corrupt the word
[44:52] of God and he can't do it he may corrupt
[44:56] people's minds about the word of God he
[44:58] may corrupt people's thoughts and give
[45:00] them false Revelations but the true word
[45:03] of God cannot be
[45:06] corrupted and since the seed of God is
[45:09] the word of God and that seed of God
[45:11] resides in you that you cannot be
[45:17] corrupted the problem is we're we're all
[45:21] impatiently now the scripture says that
[45:23] the creation granth for the
[45:25] manifestation of the sons of God
[45:28] the the creation is waiting why because
[45:31] creation knows these animals that don't
[45:33] have souls these birds that don't have
[45:36] souls the very trees themselves and the
[45:38] rocks are crying out because all of them
[45:41] are suffering because of the fall and
[45:43] they're all
[45:44] innocent that's why the creation
[45:46] literally groans because here's the
[45:49] thing that there's the power of
[45:51] redemption I want you to see the power
[45:52] of redemption and that it was a two-step
[45:54] process if I could say it like this see
[45:57] because when when Christ died on Calvary
[45:59] rose again and brought the Holy Ghost
[46:01] back he only completed one part of the
[46:04] Redemption but there was two parts to
[46:06] Redemption and we preached this before
[46:08] here but if you read I'm not going to
[46:10] read it but you go back and read
[46:12] Jeremiah 32 and it tells you about H
[46:15] Hannam's field that Jeremiah had an
[46:19] uncle and God comes to him and says your
[46:21] uncle is going to tell you to buy this
[46:22] piece of land he says go buy it and when
[46:25] you go through and you read and you find
[46:27] out that Jeremiah buys this field from
[46:30] his uncle and and when he buys it you
[46:33] you find a strange thing that there
[46:35] there's an just like you have a title to
[46:38] a piece of property or a car there were
[46:40] that he called it an Evidence is an
[46:42] Evidence of the purchase that's a title
[46:44] he says there were two evidences to this
[46:48] purchase two evidences there was one
[46:51] that was sealed according to the law and
[46:55] what was it it was a sealed evidence
[46:57] nobody could look upon it and then there
[46:59] was an evidence that was open there was
[47:02] an open evidence and a sealed evidence
[47:04] and this is what happened on Calvary see
[47:07] there was a sealed
[47:10] evidence that's been inside you the
[47:13] whole time and you don't even know it if
[47:18] you weren't spiritual you might not even
[47:20] see it if it walked right by you why
[47:22] because it's
[47:23] sealed it's a sealed evidence
[47:28] it's inside
[47:29] you it's an evidence that you can't see
[47:32] with your natural eyes it it's the it's
[47:36] your soul see when Christ on the day of
[47:39] Pentecost and the Holy Ghost was sent
[47:42] that was a sealed evidence a seal if I
[47:46] could say it this way it was a sealing
[47:49] evidence that there's evidence because
[47:52] why remember that he the scripture Paul
[47:54] says that the earnest of the inheritance
[47:57] and in Earnest is a down payment and a
[48:00] down payment what is a down payment a
[48:02] down payment is a proof of
[48:06] purchase it's a proof that this purchase
[48:10] has happened and there's more to come
[48:13] and that's what the Holy Ghost was it
[48:15] was a
[48:16] proof it was a proof it was a
[48:20] evidence back to Jeremiah it was one of
[48:24] the
[48:25] evidences that the purchase has taken
[48:29] place here's the thing but there's
[48:32] another evidence to go and this is the
[48:34] one that the creation is groaning for
[48:37] because this is the one that really
[48:39] concerns them you see if we could say it
[48:41] this way and these poor animals and
[48:44] things that have to suffer and die the
[48:46] birds and the you know the trees you
[48:48] know creation the scripture say it it
[48:50] it's groaning it's basically crying out
[48:53] the the creation wants
[48:55] Redemption but see it has to wait on
[49:00] us
[49:02] see we as Spiritual Beings can live in
[49:07] Heavenly places in Christ
[49:09] Jesus your dog can't do that it doesn't
[49:13] have a soul it just lives on this Earth
[49:15] poor things got to suffer and fleas and
[49:18] you know all these different things it's
[49:19] got to go through we on the other hand
[49:23] are Spiritual Beings who have received
[49:26] the the earnest of our
[49:28] inheritance and therefore we can live in
[49:30] Heavenly places but you see that there's
[49:34] a little bit let's turn over to Romans
[49:36] chapter 8 but there's more to it than
[49:39] this you see oh this is powerful I hope
[49:43] this is all right we're talking about
[49:45] redemption's true power and I want you
[49:47] to see how powerful it was God
[49:49] completely you you couldn't you have to
[49:52] be who you
[49:54] are and God
[49:58] will if you are a son of God or a
[50:01] daughter of God he will accept you he
[50:03] has to he swore by himself that he would
[50:06] the only question is are you going to
[50:08] believe it and are you going to
[50:09] surrender to it that's the only question
[50:12] because the only thing that gets in your
[50:14] way is your faith in what he's already
[50:16] done that's the only thing it gets
[50:18] that's that's what gets in your way
[50:20] because the work's already done the
[50:23] question is are you going to surrender
[50:25] to him or not
[50:29] and here's what everybody's looking for
[50:30] though this is why people get so
[50:31] frustrated because you see Romans
[50:35] chapter 8 verse2 says for the creature
[50:38] was made the creature which is US was
[50:41] made subject to vanity not willingly but
[50:45] by reason of him who has subjected the
[50:47] same in hope now if I could paraphrase
[50:50] that scripture for you he
[50:52] says we being people the creature we're
[50:56] the creature preacher he's speaking
[50:57] about
[50:58] here he says we were made subject to
[51:02] vanity which is this life if you read
[51:05] through Ecclesiastes you find that
[51:07] everything's vanity and vexation of
[51:09] spirit and he what is he talking about
[51:11] he's speaking about this carnal life
[51:13] that we have to live this toiling and
[51:16] sewing and reaping and the fact that we
[51:19] find we're feeding this flesh to stay to
[51:21] keep it alive but in essence it's all
[51:23] vanity because all men die and go to the
[51:25] dust anyway right that's that's what
[51:28] he's talking about is the what is the
[51:29] point of this exercise of life well God
[51:31] has a purpose for it that doesn't mean
[51:33] you should go out and just do whatever
[51:34] you want to do God has a purpose for
[51:36] your life
[51:37] here but what he's saying he says
[51:40] because the creature itself also shall
[51:43] be delivered from the bondage of
[51:46] corruption what is the bondage of
[51:47] corruption it's this
[51:49] flesh this flesh is literally the only
[51:53] for a a a son or daughter of God sealed
[51:56] with the Holy Ghost the only bondage
[51:58] left to them is death and it's even that
[52:02] as we read in the beginning is going to
[52:04] be swallowed up in Victory because this
[52:06] corruptible must put on incorruption
[52:09] this this death must put on immortality
[52:12] it has to be done why because remember
[52:14] the scripture says The Last Enemy to be
[52:16] defeated is
[52:18] death and that's what we're waiting for
[52:21] that's why we suffer with diseases
[52:23] that's why we got to fight these demons
[52:25] in our flesh because it's the only thing
[52:27] that they can attack to
[52:29] you is that flesh because it's not
[52:32] redeemed yet see remember there's two
[52:35] evidences to this Redemption you hold
[52:38] one right now in your soul if you're
[52:40] baptized sealed by the holy ghost that
[52:43] is your first inheritance that's your
[52:46] first evidence and what is the second
[52:49] evidence we're waiting for right now see
[52:51] we know that verse 22 for we
[52:54] know that the whole creation granth and
[52:58] travaileth in pain together until now
[53:01] and not only they but ourselves also
[53:04] which have the first fruits of the
[53:05] spirit e even we ourselves grown within
[53:10] ourselves waiting for
[53:12] what
[53:13] adoption but what is this adoption he's
[53:17] speaking of he says to Wi which means or
[53:21] in other words the Redemption of our
[53:24] bodies
[53:27] if you're sealed with the Holy Ghost
[53:29] brothers and sisters the only thing that
[53:32] you are waiting for
[53:34] now is the Redemption of your
[53:38] body that's what you're waiting
[53:40] for and that's what the devil is trying
[53:42] to get you see he the devil tries to
[53:45] make you believe that because of the
[53:48] deterioration of this life and this
[53:50] flesh that there's something wrong in
[53:52] your
[53:53] heart doesn't he try something bad
[53:55] happens to you oh why is this happening
[53:57] is this not supposed to happen this way
[53:59] why because there's something in you
[54:01] that knows it's groaning for the
[54:03] Redemption of this body because that's
[54:06] the only step
[54:08] left that's why the creation is also
[54:11] groaning for the manifestations of the
[54:14] sons of God because if I could put it
[54:16] this way without sounding like I'm
[54:17] giving animals too much credit but the
[54:20] animals the trees the very Earth itself
[54:25] knows that the only thing left until it
[54:29] is renewed is for the bodies of the
[54:32] children of God to be renewed because
[54:35] our bodies and the Earth are intertwined
[54:38] we are one and the same our bodies are
[54:40] of the earth and that is what needs to
[54:43] be redeemed is this Earth with a baptism
[54:47] of fire does this all make sense to you
[54:49] I hope I hope I'm not like I'm not I'm
[54:51] trying to make it as simple as possible
[54:53] but remember when Christ died on Calvary
[54:56] remember the Earth was washed over in
[54:58] the days of Noah by water washing a
[55:00] water is a baptism that it was
[55:02] Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ
[55:04] that fell on the ground at Calvary but
[55:06] the and the only thing left is that fire
[55:09] baptism to cleanse every demon from off
[55:12] the face of this Earth and to remake the
[55:14] earth a new Behold a new heavens and a
[55:18] new
[55:19] Earth that's why the creation is
[55:22] groaning right now that's why and what
[55:25] the and the devil twist it in your mind
[55:27] to make it seem like there's something
[55:29] wrong with you there's nothing wrong
[55:31] with you in in your soul if you're
[55:33] baptized if you're filled with the Holy
[55:35] Ghost there's nothing what it is is that
[55:38] you know somewhere deep inside that
[55:40] there's still more to be done that
[55:43] there's still one more step that's got
[55:45] to be taken I love that he says he says
[55:48] we're waiting for the adoption to Wi the
[55:51] Redemption of our bodies see you could
[55:55] see this I don't have time we we won't
[55:57] turn there but we know the scripture of
[55:59] the mount
[56:01] Transfiguration and brother brandham
[56:03] called that that was when Jesus Christ
[56:05] was adopted because remember he said
[56:08] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[56:10] pleased to dwell hear ye him that was
[56:12] adoption remember if we we'll just do a
[56:15] quick overview remember back in the
[56:17] Eastern Traditions when a son was born
[56:19] he was a son always but he did not
[56:22] attain the position of a son until the
[56:25] father had deemed that he was ready to
[56:28] achieve that position at which point the
[56:31] the father would bring the son out
[56:33] clothe them in his own garments and tell
[56:36] him this day you are now my son
[56:38] everything I have is
[56:41] yours and on Mount
[56:44] Transfiguration remember Jesus Took
[56:46] Peter James and John faith hope and
[56:48] love up to the top of a
[56:51] mountain and Christ was transfigured
[56:54] before them and his reignment shown is
[56:56] the
[56:57] light and what was that Christ see every
[57:01] a lot of people have mistaken adoption
[57:05] to be just this great power that we have
[57:07] in Christ but adoption even Paul says it
[57:10] plainly through adoption is the
[57:13] Redemption of your
[57:15] body that's why when Christ see they
[57:18] were given a vision of Christ in his
[57:20] glorified
[57:21] form because when he received that
[57:24] adoption he received receed he also
[57:27] received the power of a Redemptive body
[57:30] though he didn't in in if we could say
[57:34] in realistic terms on the Earthly sense
[57:37] receive it just then because he still
[57:39] had to go die but it was showing them
[57:42] that the
[57:43] Redemption that adoption and Redemption
[57:46] of the body go hand in hand God was
[57:49] foreshadowing that this adoption and
[57:52] this this this Authority that was given
[57:55] Christ and the Redemption of the body
[57:57] went hand in hand because he was they
[57:59] were shown the glorified body at the
[58:02] same
[58:04] time and that's what God is trying to
[58:06] show us is that if we can get to that
[58:09] place of of if we could get ourselves so
[58:12] in love with him so one with him then
[58:16] how could anything but the Redemption of
[58:18] the body come because death has to be
[58:21] swallowed up in Victory at that point it
[58:23] has to be that way the only thing
[58:26] hindering it is ourselves because we
[58:29] have not yet sold out to him because
[58:32] what was it Christ had fully given
[58:34] himself over that's why those things
[58:37] could be that
[58:39] way but see we have to struggle through
[58:42] all these things and you
[58:44] know we got to realize who we are and
[58:48] it's fixed God made up his mind about
[58:51] you before the foundation of the world
[58:53] and God is I think sometimes looking at
[58:55] you said I made up my mind about you a
[58:57] long time ago when are you going to make
[58:59] up your mind about
[59:02] yourself let's all stand not hold you
[59:05] any long I hope this I'm not you know I
[59:07] don't I'm not trying to preach deep
[59:09] Mysteries to me these things so simple
[59:13] you look at the Garden of Eden Brothers
[59:14] and Sisters you see he didn't have a
[59:16] choice Adam had to do it because he had
[59:19] the he had the nature of God and the
[59:22] nature of God was to save himself
[59:25] because Eve was a part of him she was
[59:30] him he could not exist he could not see
[59:34] remember Paul said that they without us
[59:37] could not be made
[59:38] perfect Adam without Eve could not
[59:41] remain
[59:42] perfect god without you cannot remain
[59:48] perfect because remember perfect perfect
[59:50] means
[59:51] complete in its real true definition God
[59:56] is not complete without
[59:58] you it can't be you may think you're the
[1:00:02] littlest part of God you know you may
[1:00:04] think you're just the the pinky toenail
[1:00:06] on God's body but i' miss my pinky
[1:00:11] toenail I mean wouldn't you you you know
[1:00:13] so many times we take things for
[1:00:16] granted but you know if I if I had lost
[1:00:18] my pinky toenail every time I took my
[1:00:20] sock off and looked at it I said I wish
[1:00:21] that
[1:00:22] didn't you know what I mean it sounds in
[1:00:25] a silly in a
[1:00:26] but that's how God thinks about you he
[1:00:29] can't he cannot exist he can't exist
[1:00:32] without
[1:00:33] you any more than you could not exist
[1:00:36] without a part of
[1:00:37] yourself it just can't it can't because
[1:00:41] God the nature of God is that he is
[1:00:44] perfection he is complete in his
[1:00:48] nature and if you you so you cannot
[1:00:50] remove any part of his nature and that
[1:00:52] includes
[1:00:53] you I'm going to read while we're
[1:00:55] standing I want to read this one
[1:00:56] scripture I told you we're going to go
[1:00:58] back to Revelation 10:7 and I want you
[1:00:59] to I want you to realize this I want you
[1:01:01] to see this this just to be a little
[1:01:04] scripture and then I just want you that
[1:01:05] you can just dwell on this we'll just
[1:01:07] give this as a little final parting gift
[1:01:09] if we could say it that way I don't want
[1:01:11] to really preach on
[1:01:12] it remember we read the very first
[1:01:15] scripture we read was Revelation 5 he
[1:01:17] says who is worthy to take the book and
[1:01:20] loose the seals there on and John said
[1:01:22] he wept because no one in Earth was
[1:01:24] found worthy to take take the book or
[1:01:26] even look at it but I want you to see
[1:01:29] something this is the power of
[1:01:32] redemption Revelation 10 and we're going
[1:01:35] to read do 10 through uh 10 we're going
[1:01:37] to read verses 1 through 11 he said and
[1:01:39] I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:01:42] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:01:43] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:01:46] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:01:47] BU as of fire and he hand in his hand a
[1:01:50] little book open now remember this is
[1:01:53] the book of redemption brother I'm talk
[1:01:56] about because this Angel this Mighty
[1:01:58] Angel is none other than
[1:02:00] Christ and he had his little book open
[1:02:03] and he said his right foot upon the sea
[1:02:05] and his left foot upon the Earth and he
[1:02:07] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[1:02:08] woreth and when he had cried seven
[1:02:10] Thunders Thunders under their voices and
[1:02:12] when the seven Thunders uttered their
[1:02:14] voices I was about to write and I Heard
[1:02:15] a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal
[1:02:17] up those things which the seven Thunders
[1:02:19] uttered and write them not and the angel
[1:02:21] which I saw stand upon the sea and upon
[1:02:23] the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven
[1:02:26] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:02:28] ever who created heaven and the things
[1:02:30] that therein are and the earth and the
[1:02:32] things that therein are and the Sea and
[1:02:33] the things that there which therein are
[1:02:35] that there should be time no longer but
[1:02:37] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:02:39] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:02:41] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:02:43] has declared to his servants the
[1:02:44] prophets now we've heard this scripture
[1:02:46] before but I want you to see this and
[1:02:48] we've heard this before but I want you
[1:02:50] to realize the significance of this
[1:02:54] scripture and the The Voice which I
[1:02:57] heard from Heaven spake unto me again
[1:02:59] and said go and take the little book
[1:03:03] which is open in the hand of the Angel
[1:03:05] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:03:06] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[1:03:09] unto him give me the little book and he
[1:03:11] sent it to me take it and eat it up and
[1:03:14] it shall make thy belly bitter but it
[1:03:16] shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:03:19] honey think about
[1:03:21] this five chapters ago
[1:03:25] John was So Unworthy that he was not
[1:03:29] even able to look at this
[1:03:32] book only Christ could take this book
[1:03:37] only Christ could loose those seals only
[1:03:41] Christ could look at it read it
[1:03:44] understand it even touch
[1:03:46] it but now
[1:03:48] John this is the power of
[1:03:51] redemption John who was once unworthy to
[1:03:55] eat even look at the book it's now
[1:03:58] commanded to take
[1:04:02] it now I have a
[1:04:05] question if in chapter five the only one
[1:04:08] worthy to take the book was the
[1:04:12] lamb but now in chapter 10 John takes
[1:04:15] the
[1:04:17] book then who is
[1:04:19] John he has to be a part of that Lamb of
[1:04:24] God there there is no other explanation
[1:04:27] for it because there's no mistake in the
[1:04:31] scripture so if if John was not worthy
[1:04:35] then but now he's
[1:04:37] worthy how does that
[1:04:39] work that means that there had to be
[1:04:42] something
[1:04:43] happened and that means only one thing
[1:04:46] don't you just chew on that that means
[1:04:48] that John could has to be as perfect as
[1:04:51] the lamb
[1:04:53] was just chew on that the rest of the
[1:04:55] day
[1:04:56] think about that John remember we've
[1:04:58] heard the scriptures a million times
[1:05:00] right no one he said I wept because no
[1:05:02] man in earth or anywhere was found
[1:05:04] worthy to open the book or even to look
[1:05:06] upon but now we go five chapters later
[1:05:09] after the lamb is loosed the after the
[1:05:11] lamb has loosed the seals after the lamb
[1:05:14] has loosed the
[1:05:15] seals and now John not only can can take
[1:05:20] the book and eat it but he's actually
[1:05:23] commanded to take the book and eat it
[1:05:27] just chew on
[1:05:29] that I hope that's all right let's just
[1:05:32] bow our heads in a word of prayer Lord
[1:05:35] Jesus Lord we love you and we appreciate
[1:05:38] you father Lord I pray oh God that the
[1:05:40] words that were spoken here this morning
[1:05:42] father would be edifying to your people
[1:05:45] Lord if there's anything that was said
[1:05:46] or done that was not pleasing in thy
[1:05:48] sight Lord God I pray that you forgive
[1:05:50] me Lord I pray that you just take the
[1:05:52] revelation of this word Lord God and
[1:05:53] that you'd sink it deep into our hearts
[1:05:56] help us to see who we are Lord and that
[1:05:58] you fix this thing from the foundation
[1:05:59] of the world Lord and not only that help
[1:06:02] us to really believe it and walk into it
[1:06:04] Lord and live it Lord that we may Lord
[1:06:07] just that we may become just absolutely
[1:06:10] in love with you more than we ever have
[1:06:11] Lord and that we'd serve you better than
[1:06:13] we ever have Lord we love you and we
[1:06:15] appreciate you father and we thank you
[1:06:17] Lord for all these things Lord in the
[1:06:19] name ofus
