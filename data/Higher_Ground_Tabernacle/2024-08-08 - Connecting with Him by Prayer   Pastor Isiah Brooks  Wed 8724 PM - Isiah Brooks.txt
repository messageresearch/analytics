Lord and thank God for his goodness and his grace I trust everybody has been going through some powerful battles is all about character development not going through no battles you need to check out and check see see what's going [Music] on everybody I know of is battling but I really believe tonight in all of this God is trying to get our attention Soul attention as we stand let us turn to First Corinthians thank you musicians the first chapter we're going to read uh the 18th to the 21st verse everybody there for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to nothing the understanding of The [Music] Prudent where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputa of this world have not God made foolishness the wisdom of this [Music] world for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe all right let's go to the 25th verse and it says because the foolishness of God is wiser than men Hallelujah and the weakness of God is stronger than men one more scripture 1 Corinthians 2:14 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually I know this is going to sound strange I I wanted to topic my subject tonight what man call Great call God calls foolishness but in the back I I felt inspired to re uh range that subject to connect it with him by prayer let us pray dear heavenly father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we do thank you for the goodness of Your Love toward us Lord there is none other beside you I often think Lord what my life would be like if you w there to guide me to influence me to give me joy and peace in times of Sorrow to give me strength in times of battles to be the healer of my wounds to be the comforter that I need at this [Music] time Lord you look beyond all my faults you see me you look beyond all my faults and you supply our needs father we ask tonight tonight that you look beyond all our faults and Supply the word or the need that we need tonight to be a better Christian to be a better Soldier to be a better son or daughter of God help us Lord this evening as we commit the service in your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated prayer is an important thing but I experienced something uh a few days ago uh that was uh really strange to me I knew the enemy was enemy was fighting me and I had to fight uh uh uh to get in a position to pray you understand what I'm saying uh my flesh didn't want to pray and there was something else that seemed to be holding me and to say I got the victory I I feel I feel like I did not but I want to say this because I didn't get the victory my entire day was off you understand me a pointments I was supposed to make places I needed to be my whole time schedule just went out the window and it left me in somewhat uh frustrated mood but it wasn't God's fault it was mine one thing I know about the Holy Spirit he's faithful and when God tells you to pray you don't need to know why you just need to pray cuz often time God is seeing something coming your way and the only way you can escape what's coming is by way of prayer is that okay we must stay connected we can't say that's impossible we've had too many many come before us uh that was connected to God more so than a lot of the so-called religious people of his day the Bible said that Kus was a righteous man and his prayers went up as a memorial you know the devil will make you think oh you praying but God don't hear you let me say it like this before you get on your knees God has already heard you the Bible say before you cry out God has already responded but the devil will make us think because we don't feel it you don't have to feel it Hallelujah faith is a dimensional power Hallelujah it doesn't just stop in this Dimension When you pray it just doesn't bounce off the wall your prayer penetrates this Dimension and it goes Before the Throne of God is that right if you understand the making of the temple and you had the holies of holies and you had the holy place and before you could uh uh get into the holies holies there was a a place that that basically said you know it was like a bottle of Tears can I say it like that your prayers amen are always remembered of God your heartaches are always remembered of God you may not see it working but it works prayer is our telephone connection now I'm get to the subject in just a moment but I want you to understand by the grace of God that before you that's what I was looking for before you could get into the holies of holies you had that altar of incense and incense was a representation or a type of your prayer see you can't even get into the holies of holies without prayer Hallelujah this may seem foolish to people but it's not foolishness in the eyes of the believer I don't know about you but my God can hallelujah amen and there is nothing impossible for God but I realize that some prayers uh uh uh how how can I say it uh need to be prayed and you say what is prayer prayer is talking to God simp right you don't have to use the D's and the Dows you talk to God like he's a friend at times you talk to him like he's uh your savior at times uh you tell talk to him as a comforter y understand me you talk to him as God it's whatever you need that's how you approach God hallelujah amen always with respect always with respect you cannot go into the presence of God filthy and dirty Hallelujah your garments must be changed you how is my garments Changed by confession through your confession God will wash you white as snow he will change Hallelujah he'll change you and once that you have confessed your sins before God then you can talk to God and God in turn will respond Hallelujah but the M natural man he can't receive these things y' heard the story before there was a lady who needed some food right and you know the the the the the unbeliever or the was outside the window and heard her praying Lord you you know I need food today and so this Infidel felt like well I'm going to go ahead and get her some food so when he came to the door knocked on the door gave the woman the food she said thank you Jesus for blessing me with this food and the man said Jesus didn't do it I did it Hallelujah she said Jesus did do [Music] it he the devil brought it but Jesus did it and I'm not saying it exactly right but the point is it doesn't matter how you get it hello somebody now I'm coming to this because you got to understand that the key to this Rapture is prayer see because you can't do nothing other than pray there's no no righteous way of making the Rapture outside of prayer that's it everything has been done but God loves to see the person that appreciate the things that have already been done hallelujah you don't go before God and said Lord I just hope I'm going to make the Rapture in order to please God you got to say thank you Lord for allowing me to be in the Rapture you don't go to God by hope with hope you go with faith hallelujah amen even as our brother uh uh rich said in that scripture Lord count me worthy account me Worthy to escape the wrath that is to come you got to pray how else you can say to God lord account me worthy Hallelujah you've got I'm saying this cuz this is not I learned something and I learned that if my prayer life doesn't increase Satan is going to get the best of me y understand me you can't just pray like we've been praying [Music] this is a time of desperation if you don't learn I I I think about Daniel all the time he prayed three times a day I don't believe Daniel was saying a prayer Daniel was praying a prayer Hallelujah I don't think corelan was repeating something from the Pharisees no sir that man that man wanted to be included he was a gentile he wanted to be included in the family of God hallelujah and he put his time in and if you put your time into prayer you see how much prayer changed things sometime we wait till we get in trouble trouble that's not the only time you should pray is that right brother bam say you can do everything too much you can sing too much you can laugh too much sing too much but you never can pray too much because the Bible says pray without ceasing Hallelujah the problem is we want to feel it you don't have to feel it it's good when you can but you don't have to God hears you let me say it like this if a mighty Russia win come across your back while you praying does that mean it was God no if you feel tears up and down your SP When you pray will that give you more faith no cuz Faith come by hearing and hearing comes by the word of God faith doesn't come by feelings Hallelujah and how are you expected to get a positive result from God you hoping he's going to do it no he that come to God must first believe that he's God and that he is a reward of them that diligently seek him there's nothing wrong with the message you like the faith to set it on fire Hallelujah yes the truth it's amazing cuz you know sometime you get these people who try to deter you from the message like what they got is better Hallelujah let me tell you something if I never saw another miracle it'll never change my mind about the word you know why I am the miracle Hallelujah and I see miracles in my life every day hallelujah oh so many wonderful things happened to me today Satan did his job but God was always doing extra for me today he did extra he went out of his way for me to allow me to see he was with me y'all understand me we got to keep the connections it it's amazing I I love this scripture 2 Corinthians 24 you don't even have to be worthy to Triumph because God calls you to Triumph um you know what I'm going tell y'all something Samson typifies the the the church for today he gave all his strength away [Music] you said brother Brooks I don't I've got a quote tonight he said brother Brook I don't even have I don't even have a desire to pray no more pray no more you know what you've done you grieve the holy spirit away from you and you need a good spanking one thing I know about God whether you know it or not every one of us got to meet him every one of us you going to meet him as a Believer or a nonbeliever y'all hear what I'm saying I don't know where your wisdom is but I trust by the grace of God that you wake up out of the sleep that Satan is wooing everybody it's like I I was thinking today the people have been Bewitched yeah not only the world but people around this message they are in some kind of days they don't even see the coming of the Lord and what we're preaching Satan is telling them it's foolishness they don't even believe believe it you know why because they have their own agenda they're not dead to themselves Hallelujah I'm not going to be long tonight second Corinthians 2:4 I often say to myself if brother Brandon was standing in this pull pit how would you behave yourself think about it because he ain't here but the God that he serve is here hallelujah listen it says thanks be unto God which always causes us to Triumph in Christ and maketh manifest the savior of his knowledge By Us in every place shifting to my next you know why we stand a lot of time we think we stand because we've been so righteous we stand because Jesus prayed for us yeah we stand because he prayed for us St John 17 y understand me we held in place by his prayer right St John 17 9 through 12 oh I'm coming to something here I don't know what people are going to do but I know what God is having me to do for the last I can't tell you how many days he has been echoing prayer echoing prayer right my right now one of my daughters is in the hospital very sick physically and mentally and it's just uh how can I say it uh the way of a transgressor is hard sometimes we we don't realize as as uh uh brother Samuel preached the other night your choices 5 years from now you're going to be paying for the choices you've made there is no way out of it if you make the good choice you'll be reaping goodness if you read bad choices you're going to reap bad things there is no way out it is the law whatsoever a man s he shall also reap that word has no respect to person Hallelujah I would I want to tell you something but I I better not it's a personal thing but but I I can tell you though you better listen people need to start listening they don't listen especially the new generation they have a hard time listening to their parents they have a hard time because of the of the uh anointing that's on this age you know the Bible said it'll be the children leading the parents it's terrible amen St John 177 9-1 17 9 through2 excuse me I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me Lord for they are thine and all are all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them Hallelujah now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through the thine own name Those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are one as we are hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my God what are you saying I'm resting on his prayer I'm standing on his Prayer Will I become one he will make me one Hallelujah while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou Gest me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of predition that the scriptures might be fulfilled you know I want to say something I'm GNA go ahead and say it every one of us uh at one point in time we had our our system of DNA our natural system of DNA whatever our grand parents whatever our parents were whatever our great grandparents were all of that was given to you whether you like it or not but I'mma tell you something right now the devil knew your Grandmama your granddaddy your great granddaddy he used all of them and he knows there weaknesses Hallelujah and when he see The Offspring he knows how to attack you without the Holy Ghost you're going to see Grandma granddaddy great grandma great granddaddy all them going to come through you and then you're going to wonder why and how I became so bad man that's the [Music] truth my children that are not converted I see my other relatives living their lives to them why it didn't have to happen but they failed to make Jesus their [Music] choice amen and I'mma tell y'all message children y'all have no idea what what you will confront uh what you'll get into if you don't get the Holy Ghost that's right if you if you don't make Jesus your choice everything the devil hate about your daddy he going to take it out on you that's the truth you love the Lord all right let's move on did I finish that yes First Corinthians 69- 11 yeah this is why I'm I'm I'm saying these things because I want you to know there are things is in your flesh you don't even know there right you don't even know it's there it's like tasting a foreign food you don't even know you're going to like it but once you taste that foreign food you say oh this is awesome I want more I'm using that as a scenario because you have no idea where that weak link is and but the devil knows where it's at let me tell y'all something I had alcoholics all down my line it hit me it hit my sister my daddy my cousins y'all understand me drug addicts everywhere come on somebody I can go into a lot of stuff but understand all of that was in me it was a gift I didn't ask for it but it was a gift I'm trying to I'm trying to I'm talking to somebody I'm trying to help you so you can understand that we all need God and we need him more now than ever and the only way we're going to make it we got to Humble ourselves and pray If my people they which are called by my name would humble themselves and pray and seek my faith and turn from their Wicked Ways then I will hear from heaven and heal the land that's the truth First Corinthians 6 9-1 Hallelujah no ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor Thief nor covetousness nor drunkers no nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God now Paul hitting everything of the flesh everything everything Hallelujah this is what gets me that's why I don't I don't like self-righteous people not like it's not like I don't like them I don't like their ways that Spirit like you got it all together we're all Sinners saved by grace yall understand me Hallelujah you was born like I was born and you will die like I die Hallelujah that's the truth we be loving one another and helping one another Hallelujah we we we have no place for criticism look here what he says now and such were some of you oh my you mean to tell me some of us with this kind of stuff I don't know why people why people think that the church is supposed to have all these righteous people we came from somewhere Hallelujah and I'm going tell you where we came from the church rejected the word and in this time the word went to the highways and the byways to the scum of the earth Hallelujah and I was among that and so were you Hallelujah let me tell you something you might do everything right but if you ain't born again and you still a sinner and such were some of you but ye are washed ye are Sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God hallelujah it might sound crazy but I cannot explain to you what the Holy Ghost is to me all I know is that I got it thank Lord and all I know is that it changed me Hallelujah am and all I know it gives me joy in the midst of Sorrow Hallelujah I'm telling you this Holy Ghost has been my mother my father my sister my brother Hallelujah my friend my everything he is my everything Hallelujah and such were some of you I I said oh my God and we'll sit here people in the church they start picking out people's faults as if you don't have any but every one of us has to pray and ask for forgiveness every day anybody in here that doesn't every day every day it shouldn't be difficult to love one another you see that person as yourself you you ought to say that could have easily been me Hallelujah just so you know spiritually it is you body right Ephesians 3:20 I'll get to a few quotes in just a minute Hallelujah I don't worry am I going to make the Rapture already done it that's right he told me so he told you so too but you got to believe it you know why I say this because when them demons break loose from Hollywood break break loose from the World Council of churches you better know who you are this ain't goingon to be no hallelujah hallelujah uhuhu you got a battle on your end y'all better hear what I'm saying read the fox's book of martyr you'll find that people who were Christians because of their persecution they denied Jesus Christ makes no sense to me you got to die you going to die whether they kill you or you die from old age you going to die and you got to make sure that the Lord is on your [Music] side I just say to myself Lord there will not be a time I'm going to bow to Satan and know that I'm bowing to him the only reason how he got Eve because he deceived her and as long as God keep me from being deceived it ain't going to happen Hallelujah unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us we've got to make this scripture live though is that right Philippians 2:9 through2 I'm I'm I'm moving faster I'm not trying to tickle your ear but I'm hoping God is producing a thirst in you to pray Philippian 212 we don't have to worry if we trust the name you got to trust the name wherefore God also have highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven things in Earth things under the Earth you know that hurricane down there in South Carolina brother B I prayed brother Bond prayed I don't know who else prayed but they wanted to open their shop today and that thing is is hovering over Colombia and everywhere and people are being flooded in every different area and he God allow the rain to stop here a little bit there he was able to open the shop today in the midst of that cuz it came in as a storm it went back out and came back in as a hurricane see God God answers the prayer you you said well that don't affect me it's you going to need this and the problem is you know it's a spoiled child when you spoiled you can't accept no for answers right God been so good to you but no seem to be so hard for you to accept God don't care how you feel mama said no daddy said no no is no you can go cry to do a tandum you will never I can never affect god with our human thoughts it might work in the human element I've seen people do that manipulate by way of their feelings you can't manipulate God thank God for the no or thank God for the yes whatever it is in all things give thanks you can't have faith and fear at the same time Hallelujah you say I'm having faith and you doing this oh Lord no that's not faith faith is like a rock hallelujah it stand still Hallelujah no matter what comes and go Faith declares it to be so that's the way it is every knee shall bow 11th verse and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and [Music] trembling you know God told David one time don't you count all them don't you count the people don't count them but God had been so good to David David thought he could count him did he get in trouble big trouble so much so God asked him a question would you want me to deal with you or whether you have man to deal with you David said no Lord no man I don't want no man to deal with me right Lord you deal with me Hallelujah you understand me the reason why I say this is because in I have been blessed I don't know about anybody else I have been blessed all my life I've had Hard Times difficult times I've been by myself I've been alone however you want to say it but God has never left me he's always been there when nobody else would would would stand with me Jesus stood with me y understand what I'm saying but I can't take that for granted to think that I can do what I want to do and God going to just be good no when it's time for a spanking he's going to give it to me correction he's going to give it to me and I Pray by God's grace that won't take his grace for granted Hallelujah listen one I'm I'm going move on let me move faster when prayer I'm coming to prayer because I want you to understand this what we're talking about is foolishness to people the world is building their big whatevers and I just keep saying Lord am I crazy am I the only ones that's seeing this thing we don't know how bad it's going to be but I can't see it being good at all and I'm thinking I just trust that everybody's soul is right with God that is the most important thing right now go to school go to wherever get your job plan your whatever build your house build whatever but right now make sure that soul is right and once that soul is right God will give you whatever you want but make sure that soul is right is that right after the seals brother Brandon preached the message desperation he said if you don't get desperate it'll be so simple it pass right through you and you won't even know it now I'm going show you something he said it'll be so simple why have we made the message so complicated so deep so deep every reaching for the Deep things when they need to Humble themselves they need God separating because of one said he came in 63 and one said he didn't like people still arguing about how the Rapture going to take place who cares as long as you in it who cares as long as you're part of it you say how do you know I got I'm part of it when you get the Holy Ghost if that same spirit that was in Christ Jesus if it be in you if it dwells in you as it Quicken his body it will also Quicken yours let me say it like this if there ever was a seven Thunder uh simplicity that is it everybody got this mysterious stuff going on and the people are lacking you don't see H God anywhere hallelujah look what Psalm 65 and9 says hallelujah oh Jesus help us Lord I got children that I'm praying for I'm really praying and something something's moving but I know now I got to pray more I can't just pray sporadically I got to pray [Music] constantly Psalm 69 and5 oh God thou knoweth my foolishness and my my sins are not hid from thee this this is David talking and if God knows his foolishness you know he knows yours too he knows mine right and he knows my he knows nothing can't you can't hide nothing let me let me read this quote coming from expectation 6127 brother brother B in the uh paragraph 25 he what man call great God calls foolish and what men call foolish God calls great so what we've got to do is get back into the program of God and find out out after all what God wants us to do and the only way I know to do it is prayer he said prayer is the key that's the answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings hey there's no atomic bomb or no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer I want you to think about that think about what an atomic bomb can do think about what a hydrogen bomb can do and Prophet God is saying that prayer is greater than that Hallelujah the problem is we don't have faith in our prayer and the Bible said you cannot come before him amen approach god without faith because without faith it's impossible to please him Hallelujah prayer makes Faith make prayer Works prayer will change the mind of [Music] God he said did you know that it it did do it one time that's right let me say it like this prayer is the greatest source of Defense Hallelujah and the devil don't want you praying the enemy of today the enemies of Babylon I'm talking about spirits now they watched Daniel and they saw Daniel praying three times a day Hallelujah and they went against him don't you think the devil is congregating against you I'm talking spiritually now he don't want you praying hallelujah amen because Daniel Prayed he became one of the greatest men in Babylon it wasn't his righteousness his self-righteousness he gave honor to the Liv Living God in in spite of all he was the only one sometime at the prayer meeting but he he he was faithful he was faithful and because he was faithful God heard him don't blame it on God when you don't get what you want Hallelujah that that's nothing but the truth I think about Mary when she just wanted water turn into wine you think God just you think God well that's my mama no he didn't Hallelujah she had faith that Jesus could do anything and you need to have faith that the god you serve or The God you claim to serve do the impossible I don't care what it is my eyes don't declare to me what God can do these senses can lie to you Hallelujah the faith in God's word hallelujah makes the devil Shake Hallelujah is that all right let me read on who is Jesus 64 620 Hallelujah brother said in paragraph 100 he said you see when you go to praying for somebody something goes to taking place you don't see it do you but I believe it when you go to praying something goes to taking place Hallelujah there is where we fail friends not praying prayer is the key note asking you shall receive you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not ask abundance that your joy may be full ask and believe that you receive what you ask for Hallelujah when the devil says no you let him know God says yes Hallelujah is that right he's Jehovah Gyra he is a supplier of all your needs then hold on to it don't leave it if it's a promise in the Bible and it's been revealed to you that God is going to give it to you hold to it amen hold to it the devil don't want you holding on to nothing oh God can't do it he ain't the same like he was yesterday yes he is and I don't mean no harm to me he's greater now if there ever been a greater God he's a greater he's done more in our day than he's done in all the history that we know of Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah you know see I don't seen the dead rais so and what power is God's power so you know I know the impossible is [Music] possible people don't been in the message ain't seen nothing and the thing about it is they don't look in the mirror long enough you see a miracle you see a miracle every day Hallelujah God gets you up every day he's done for you things that no one else would do for you Hallelujah the greatest Miracle God is to me he's the greatest friend I ever [Music] had and I don't have some good friends still got some good ones but when it comes to God he never fails me Colossians 3:17 prayer must be administered in the name of Jesus we hear people say Jesus enough around here we can say God we can say Lord everything but you got to start calling on the name of Jesus is that what brother Ram said he said if you call on his name he will draw near Hallelujah whatsoever you do in word or deed and if you can't do it in the name do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him Hallelujah that means with all of our prayer and fasting we will never be found worthy by our works it is only by the grace of God that we are counted worthy y understand me get off of this situation this mind thing if I don't do this for God he ain't going to do it for me I beg the different with you God has always did for you when you didn't do for him hallelujah how many times you've been backsliding amen and we backslide every day God picks us up every day Hallelujah forgives us every day even when we know to do good we don't do it sometimes Hallelujah the moment we pray the moment you pray the moment you call on his name Hallelujah he's right there 2 Thessalonians 1 11-2 you get lonely you need to pray you feel like nobody don't love you you need to pray because all of us feel like that sometimes Hallelujah and we fail to see God is trying to tell you here am I I'm right here I did all of this to fellowship with you but we'll fellowship with flesh and blood all they going to do is all they going to do is disappoint us [Music] anyway Hallelujah 2 Thessalonians 1 11-2 wherefore also we pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling and fulfill all the good pleasures of his goodness and the work of Faith with power that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and ye in him according to the grace of Our God and the Lord Jesus Christ I'm turning I'm turning a corner I'm just saying it like this because and I know the enemy is going to hear me but right now I solely Want Jesus I want his life as the prophet has preached I want it to be seen in me and whatever it takes whatever it takes it's going to happen it will happen it has happened because he said it would happen I believe that I believe this message is to produce a super race I believe this word is supposed to change a man woman from glory to glory but will never get there without prayer he's done it all but all he ask us to do is pray Hallelujah you love the Lord now here I'm coming with this just stand still for a moment testimony of the sea hallelujah we're going to come from part of paragraph [Music] 83 yeah I'm start above 84 now he's he's talking about Rebecca and and Rebecca was zakia's wife he said you know when you get to praying for a fell he kind of gets in a bad shape if you want somebody saved or something done just start praying for them that's the reason we don't prayer is the greatest thing was ever put in the hands of a man prayer even changes God God pronounced death on a man one time and he turned his face to the wall and prayed and God spared him 15 years longer right it's true we know he's talking about Hezekiah Hallelujah so we find out that little old Rebecca prayed all the time and that night she couldn't sleep she looked out of the corner of her eye and she said zachus was Restless she said Lord I know you dealing with him I know you dealing with him now Jesus the prophet is coming into town for this meeting down here and I want him to see him so bad Lord you make a way now make him miserable just make just make him so he can't sleep Hallelujah there he was he couldn't sleep I I cut a part out cu the prophet of God said that Rebecca prayed I think she prayed all night one night only for her husband she focused and she stayed there and the whole time while she was praying God was working on him don't ever think your prayers in vain you got stay with it Hallelujah there he was he couldn't sleep so all right that's fine the next morning she had doze off to sleep laying prayer all night see that y'all want to pray for somebody an hour or two and think God going to do something you got to love this individual you got to love that soul to you stop thinking about self and how how long you going to be on your knees if it's going to hurt your knees get a pillow well I pray three hours if you want your husband saved now brother brand say you do the same thing that Rebecca uh Rebecca did she prayed all night you do the same thing she did just start praying for him and you know out there on the sea when he's out there fishing down there in the business he will get so under conviction he can't even sleep yes sir that's right y'all believe the message he's instructing us to love one that needs to be saved you can't play with prayer you got to go before God in a sincere way and stay there until God answer your prayer and if you want your wife saved you do the same thing and she'll come away from every card party everything else she belong to she just can't keep from it she'll sure do it yes sir oh there's just great power in prayer listen coming from as the eego stir his nest paragraph 341 I'm almost done brother B say lay your hands on one another and ask the Devils to leave that person you got your hands on he said your prayer is as good as mine put your hands over on one another and that's is where we get in trouble because we feel like we got to have some Superman to come pray the they lay their hands on the SE they is in everybody who are believers Hallelujah one more one more quote and I let you go coming from uh the message where has thy strength gone Samson I'm asking you tonight where have your strength gone when you have grieved the Holy Spirit Away a woman come to me last night and she said to me she said brother Bram I am so sick she said I have no power no more prayer my the life of prayer is gone from me and I'm getting older and I don't want to die like this he says see grieved the spirit away from you let him come to you just now Lord Jesus bringing this group of people to you yet harsh Lord with the word cut like a two-edged sword coming and going but lord it's those things that makes us what we are if the ho spirit that circumcises cut away all the Flesh of the world and give us new life it's in this birth Lord like a seed that's laying on the ground until that seed is dead and rotten and as as it rot then New Life comes out until our intellectual conception of Christ becomes so dead till it's rotten then new life will be born now life can only come when death is and life are associated together you understand me and people say well you know I just I just can't pray anymore my question is what have you done somewhere you grieve the holy spirit away and that's easy to do when you don't listen when you don't do as he tells you to do yeah I I've experienced that myself I'm not just talking about something I'm I'm I'm reading I've experienced God leaving me for a month horrible feeling but it's not like you don't know what you've done and if even if you don't realize what you've done he will make it he will give you an understanding of what you did do you understand me God don't just leave you to leave you y yall understand me if you used to pray and you don't pray like you used to somewhere you grieve God it could be simple as your phone or the clothes you wear or whatever the case may be somewhere there's a breach and only God can show you where that's at but one thing about me or one thing about your heart you should desire Hallelujah like David said there's only one thing I desire and that is to be in his Temple to inquire in his Temple y'all understand me to be with him that's that's it and whatever that's hindering that Lord help me help me Jesus let's pray you may stand our dear heavenly father we come before you as humbly as we know how Lord we battle every day to stay connected with you there's so many schemes of the devil so many WS of the devil wherever we turn our head is the devil whether it be front or in the back or the left or the right Satan is everywhere so we it is important for us to stay connected in the spirit with you Lord father make us a vessel of prayer make us a vessel of consecration Lord help us now Lord Jesus seeing the hour that we're living in we not only just want to make sure we're saved and in that place of rest but we want to also cry out for our loved ones

well as the old Mercy Lord is what we cry for Lord Lord because we need you Lord I don't think any of us wants to come to that day and be surprise that will not in the number Lord awaken us because the hour is late Lord make make make us shake the carnality we don't want to be like Israel that would hear the word and then rise up and PR be merciful to us Lord look beyond our faults tonight see

fill us with your Holy Spirit seal us Lord oh God shedding out all of the world all of the desires of the world oh God help us here this night you hear our cry you see our desire and father I believe you've given us these desires because you want to respond to these desires you said oh God that there's a deep call there's a deep to respond and father we see the approaching of the translation Lord there's no way I can say it I don't know how oh God but my soul says yes my soul says yes Lord God have mercy on US Open our eyes Lord that we all will become more desperate in this time lord more desperate father and that we would love one another and love our enemies Lord and most of all increase our prayer lives Lord Lord help us pray put that burden of prayer on everyone everyone's who's listen to this message put the burden of prayer on their heart not to feel it but to know that you hear our prayer Hallelujah you said we have not because we ask not Hallelujah and you said we ask it shall be given if we seek we shall find and if we knock the door shall be open to us dear Jesus l of God lover of our soul oh Jesus be merciful to us father look beyond our faults tonight many are tired many are weary but I pray father that you give them a bonus blessing just for showing up just for sitting and listening oh God help them now Lord protect your people hallelujah I'm excited
