direction of the Lord for this new year and we certainly want to be in God's will for this new year and along with the travelin and the preaching and the things like that comes a lot of new songs things that we try to put in as we travel and sing to the people and we found this one actually a sister in our church some time ago a cement that I would sing this one that took us a while to kindly get the inspiration for it and it's a very very simple song but I love the meaning of it it just simply says and I'm gonna read you just a line or two of the course that says I can pray until the walls come down I can pray until there's healing all around there's something that's something that I can do I can pray no matter what we are where we come from as Christians we all have that something about it in [Music] you say I'm not able or too young I'm too old I can't sing or preach a no titles you what can i tune for I want to do my palm and I want to help the hurting it's all of my I can pray until the walls come down till the ceiling all around that's something I can do my secret place calling on your name that's something I can do [Music] and my child is gone so far to reach them up and down till this evening all around that's something my friend you may not be a singer you may not be appreciate you may not be recognized in your local community but there's one thing that all of us born by the Spirit of God can do we can call on the lovely on the mighty on the holy name of Jesus yes we can [Music] [Music] that's something I do I can't [Music] hi [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] raise the Lord amen to stand together tonight Amen wonderful songs with wonderful words to the songs and meanings to the songs and I believe there's something about song that's got power in it Amen I believe a song can bring healing sir can but the Remsen old downcast type spirit thank you brother that would be all upset and tore up what more he said but some good old gospel music he said a mammal caused everything to come right back up I mean it's got a healing unit ain't that right amen certainly as we said appreciated the service this morning and appreciated how the Lord spoke to us and I always counted a privilege I don't know how you feel about it but for me coming in the house of the Lord you know is something very very important and I think that maybe you know as some sons of God I think even more as we see the Day approaching that's when we should come to the house of God even more beyond that because as we said this morning talking about being cut on that's why we're here amen that Jesus can have the right away in our life and I I love him with all of my heart I want to say thank you to everybody for allowing us to come by always to brother Isaiah sister Ruby and we loved and been friends many many years and I was thinking about all these little kids come up now Krystal kind of--you all these little ones I'm Erin when y'all look like that man I'm not terribly old but I'm old enough to remember when I was a little girl and Krystal and I grew up together almost practically anytime and here we are I'm old she all the time that's where that goes but I just thank the Lord and I just believe God is he's a God of knowing everything I don't think there's nothing that he don't know and he saw this very moment in time for us it may be 40 years past 50 years past 30 years past but to God has just been a few moments just like that you know and he knew the very end from the beginning and then the Bible said he knew all things you know what struggles we'd have to go through in life what hardships we have to endure what troubles we'd see along the way but I'm so glad my only confidence of even standing here tonight and even daring to come preach the gospel whether it be to five people or 5,000 is the fact that God's got everything under control and if I didn't trust him I certainly wouldn't be here tonight amen I I just believe that hey man let's turn now to Genesis chapter 3 verse 13 I want to if it will help us tonight excuse me I've got several things that I want to try to get into by the help of the Lord but more than anything I want to talk about divine healing and in order to get to the divine healing part I'm going to go through serpent seed and in a few these subjects and I'd like to kindly spend some time with this part about divine healing now I don't want you to get in your mind that divine healing is just simply for example some might think it's just the healing of the body but it's not it's more than that so actually the whole healing or as they say in the world today holistic healing which means all of us and there's a lot more that God wants to heal than just our bodies he wants to heal our minds and heal our spirits and heal our memories sometimes our memories get sick and sometimes all we can think of is just some old bad memories something it's happened to us a hundred years ago it wasn't and can't seem to get it off for mine and all that but I believe the Lord is a healer and I don't believe the New Testament made him a healer I believe he was a healer when he was God you say when he was God well he was always God so he's always been a healer hey that's right amen let's start Genesis chapter 3 verse 13 now I'm gonna drop his sister and you can bring it back up and salute if you'd like I know it's probably ringing maksim Genesis 3 verse 13 this cold weather does a number on my voice I'm going to tell you after about one service I'm just as hoarse as I can be now when the weather warms up I'm preach to you 20 in a row and not even squeak but as cold weather gets you a little bit so amen we sir they appreciate the Lord helping us anyhow now we want to go to the root we want to go to the stinker that caused all these problems in the beginning go right to the old devil we want to go to where the source of all this sickness and stuff come in at and we want to look now verse 13 and going through verse 16 in verse 20 and I forgot to mention this morning greetings to all that watching and the youtubes and the different channels and things arranged here at the church we've been watching a little bit here and there some of the recent serves brother Vaughn and I'll got caught some of that a little bit and and tried not to listen anything here at the church because I wanted the Lord to lead me in the right direction so I didn't want to know nothing but I did listen it brother Vaughn a little bit I really enjoyed when I got to here and I like your new setup that's really a handy thing and it's real clear and here's real good on the on the broadcast out there and that's that's what you want people get the message get the message out that's that's the main thing so we greet everybody that's watching the message too and my prayer is not just here in this room but everybody will get it will receive divine healing amen and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou hast done the woman said well the serpent handed me a basket full of apples and I ate them now today what the Bible said is it beguiled me the word beguiled here simply means to deceive and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field and upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of my life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed so the serpent did have a seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel under the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception I want you to notice carefully God punished this woman in the area she was guilty if she ate a fruit or a pomegranate or Apple or something like that he should have give her love Joe but God punished her in the area she was guilty where was she guilty at conception and sorrow and in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee that unsound brain women's lib in the 21st century 2018 but this is still God's Liam if that makes sense amen amen verse 20 now and I really want to focus on this last verse so once you pay attention to the way the Bible phrases this the springs and everything we want to talk about an Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living so not just the mother of children but she would give birth to every disease germ she would give birth to every backslidden cancer cell she would give birth to everything if it has a life she would give birth to it it would come through the channel this woman here amen let's let's pray together over the word father thank you Lord for the opportunity to come into your place I pray you'd bless this word and help us receive from it in Jesus name Amen god bless you may be seated now let me read to you from Lester's called fellowship through reconciliation brother Branham says in the beginning when God made man in his own image he put him in the Garden of Eden he had perfect fellowship the late afternoon the evening time when the twilights was falling I can see the great Jehovah come across the top of the palm trees the roaring of the Thunder and Adam and Eve gathered out there in the great open-air Cathedral and worship God they had fellowship and talked with him the lion and the tiger all coming around he said it was perfect harmony wouldn't that be a wonderful place to live he says Amen abiding place where there is no sickness where there is no sorrow no way of ever being upset he said everything just in perfect harmony God in harmony with his creature and the creature in harmony with his maker what a perfect time a complete fellowship and that's the way God intended it now just reading from this statement focusing on this statement a moment you can see wine that when this great thing would strike in the Garden of Eden excuse me you would see the the elements of perfection the elements of the harmony between God and is creation when they're broken you can see how that Satan would then move into this place of perfection and slowly pervert little piece by little piece all that God created in here and you can see the harmony and everything how that that must have made the devil so mad to think that there's harmony that everything is going just right here he is with the desire to be like God wanting to Kingdom want and subjects wanting people want all of this and here's God got the perfect Church and so here comes the devil to ruin the perfect Church that's usually the way it goes Satan has always been against harmony between man and God when he sees you in harmony with God he'll do the same thing to you try to disrupt that harmony by coming in and little by little strip away what you have amen to break it's such a dreadful thing to come to church a dreadful thing to read the Bible a terrible thing to try to serve the Lord that's the way Satan likes to interrupt you aim and get you in a feeling of coming to church and somehow after he works on your life your chair your pew don't fit like it used to amen and everything seems to sing a little bit louder a little bit softer something just not right all the time well that's the way the devil likes to do disrupt harmony by introducing this ideology of you know that that there's more out there or there's something greater than what God could offer us and that's still his plan that's his tactic even to this state where he tries to make a manifestation of of a greater kingdom of a greater life of a greater something you know between man and the world better than what God can offer you take a young girl maybe and he'll offer to her the beauties of the world and the delicacies of the world and offer her popularity and offer her friendship with the world and what more I meant trying to let her see that it's so much greater out there than it is serving God under that humble atmosphere of just living a Christian life and he always tries to project things outside of the word as being greater than what they really are a man you see here in this little church and and no doubt the Devils start working on your mind well if we had this if we had that if we had such-and-such if this would happen if that would happen oh how much more spiritual I would be well what that is that's the devil trying to disrupt harmony between you and Almighty God the fact the matter is you can have the greatest musicians in the planet sitting on the platform you can have the biggest high payers in the world sitting in this church but if you're miserable then ain't going to help you be less miserable amen if you're not serving God and ain't going to help you get closer to God what you are is what you are and whatever state you're in that's what you usually are amen not even death can change what kind of person you are so bigger church more people and all that kind of thing that doesn't change us but that's the devil's tactic try to get people looking in a direction and looking in a way of oh the grass is always greener ah and things are always better if and that's the way it is sometimes in a man's marriage I'd be married to a beautiful woman she loves him she takes care of him whatever more but then the devil will turn his eyes and divert his eyes off to another woman that does different things and you'll think well my wife don't do that well my wife don't act that way well my wife and they think well if I could live with her I could have everything I wanted when they find out that they move on in the grass isn't as green as they thought it was a man if I could say it that way it's just the human life all over again but that's the devil's job paint a picture and make it look so beautiful that it would deceive the very elect that if it was possible to deceive me elective he's always done that way painted a picture now he does the same thing of course as we've studied here as believers of this message many times in the Garden of Eden he paints this picture to Eve that God somehow is hiding something from her you know somehow she's not achieving everything that she needs to achieve and she isn't coming up to everything she needs to come up to and and of course the devil kindly will works on her with her feminine look and her feminine type characteristics and here brother Brown say that you know he took her by the hand and said now Eve look at this dainty little hand of yours look at your features and how much more beautiful you are than Adam he said look at all of the creation of God look at the the buck doe the buck deer rather and then the humble doe and look how beautiful and strong he is and how humble she is but look at you Eve you're the exact opposite of everything God's made you're the pretty one and Adams the humble one don't you think maybe God's hiding a little something from you now Satan knew if he could get to this woman that she would be the bedding ground of all life that means that everything God had created he could bring through the channel of this woman and through the channel of this woman he could pervert out anything God had done now remember when they were created they were created in the image of God spirit man and woman first and then he creates him in the image of the animals that they were going to rule over he said in the flesh Adam had hands like a monkey he had feet like a bear but in spirit in soul he was created after the image of God and we know that Adam Genesis 1:26 he said let us make man in our own image that was not the image of a man or a flesh but that was the image of spirit so Adam was made in spirit first and then his soul or his spirit and all of that was placed into a body and it was representative of those he would rule over so he was going to be a God of the earth so God made him a a a being that kindly related with all types of creation and what more he was going to represent look friends there is a reason why that they think the chimpanzee and the man are so close together God made him in a way that he would represent those he was going to rule over amen but two thirds actually I should say four thousand years later two thousand years ago the Lord Jesus done the same thing he came down into Satan's Eden he took on a form of the subjects he was going to rule over a man a man he became one of us a man that he could take on an image to show us that he was going to be our Lord our second man Adam so the devil creates this picture and Eve falls for it the hard thing friends as a preacher I've been going on this summer be 27 years for me the hard thing is a preacher around the world is to see people fall for the lies of the devil it hurts just too bad you can't stand it you know the devil's gonna lie you know you're gonna say things and do things but to see people fall for it it tears you all to pieces sometimes to see them fall into situations that you know if they'll just resist the devil he'll flee away from them but then to listen to the thing it hurts you so bad you can't stand because she realized that once Satan just gets a little seed planted in there he's got a whole garden in mind when he's planting seeds don't forget the devil don't plant a garden he don't plant a seed without expecting a garden to come forth eventually here he is in the Garden of Eden well what better place to plant seeds in the garden so he plants the seed of discrepancy in this woman now I want you to notice this in Genesis the second chapter now going back a whole chapter there verse 16 let's just observe this for just a moment remember God in His Harmony God is perfection everything was perfect harmony and the devil is seeking to disrupt this now we're gonna try to start at the foundation I want to bring you along for a little while into this divine healing Genesis 2:16 and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it from the day that thou eatest therefore thou shalt surely die and in the day the Lord God said that he said it's not good that man should be alone I will make him a help meet for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field every fowl of the air and brought him to Adam to see what he would call there whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof now we watch here as Adam begins to move in to this type of ministry where he was saying and calling what God would call the animals his mind was a direct connection with the mind of God and as he would call an animal that's exactly the way God would have identified that animal calls him lion calls him cheetah calls him bear calls in Turkey whatever he calls him calls him sheep calls him gorilla every what it was that was what God was communicating through his mind to Adam now Adam is the god of the earth and he cannot be deceived there's no way that he can fall because he is a direct descendant hallelujah from Almighty God but the woman is made out of the continuity of the and the devil is watching God's continuity and he realizes uh-oh God made a boo-boo see the things Satan never does figure out is it usually when it looks like God's making a mistake that's just because he's dumbing it down for the devil to pounce on it yeah so that way when the devil gets a hold of it then all kinds of things can be expressed out of God after Satan gets ahold of this woman remember he's Redeemer he's lover he's savior he's father he's all these things but he cannot express not of that until the devil gets ahold of this woman he's also a healer but it can't heal if ain't nothing sick he can't heal if nothing broken the way he can do it is allow Satan to move in and disrupt this harmony and so he makes the woman in a way that she can be deceived hey man yeah I know sis you're a little bit outnumbered tonight but we're not picking on you that's for sure man amen that's right but this is what the Bible said you know there's a certain gentleman some time ago he just recently left the message he got quite upset because brother BAM said that the woman was like scrap material she was scrapped well that's what brother BAM was trying to show that she wasn't brought out of the ground like everything else was she was taken from the man it was a scrap piece it didn't mean that she was garbage hey the prophet of God said she's the most beautiful woman ever created that don't sound like garbage to me but she was made in the continuity in a way that Satan can move to her now he knows that somehow another this woman is the key to disrupting God's continuity now whether Adam would realize that or not or whether God would reveal it to him while he was still under the this holy veil and in this perfection whether he recognized what the devil was doing we may not know but we do know that when she presents her body to Adam and says this is what the serpent taught me this is what I learned and I want to give that to you you're made just like he is and I enjoyed sexual desire with him and I want to enjoy it with you you're my husband the Bible said he partook and eat of the tree now something I want you to recognize out of the ground the Lord God made to grow all the beasts of the field or it was Adam taken out of the ground where it was the serpent taken out of the ground so apart remember a part of the continuity of God was not just the woman but the ground as well there was a reason that God took these creatures out of the earth remember the earth is a spoken-word scene of God the earth can never be destroyed don't ever get in your mind that God is gonna take this earth away and put it in there anew there ain't no new earth he's gonna renovate this planet even maybe that's why we like renovation brother Troy we acting like our daddy gay man a man who's gonna renovate the earth all of the iron ore all the chemicals are gonna be burnt right back down to the core and God's gonna rebuild this or back to its former beauty it's won't even be even more beautiful than that because there's gonna be a new heavens and a new earth set on it amen a new city set on the new earth so Satan knows now watch this carefully that if he can get to this woman that if somehow he can get to her if Adam came from the ground then he realized they need the ground to live of the fruit of the trees thou mayest freely eat somehow there's a connection between their food and their life so Satanist doesn't start working on this woman after he causes her to fall but the earth is directly affected as well remember how I wish we could take time and read this remember the Bible said very quickly I talked about how that it bring forth thorns and thistles when she falls the earth as affected as in the same way and the reason that that's important when we come to divine healing in a moment you'll see how that works now that just said just to cover the part of serpent seed about what this is now we know that the fruit of the womb the fruit of the womb is actually children bringing forth children she didn't bring forth little pomegranate since she didn't give birth a little bananas she gave birth to kids now if somebody would ask the question then why did Jesus have to be virgin born well that answers why what took place in the Garden of Eden that's the answer to it the fact that Jesus had to be virgin born proved it was more than eating a pomegranate in the Garden of Eden if Jesus would have been born through sex he'd had come the same program we came and we still be in sin right here today he wouldn't have been the virgin born son of God but because he was virgin born Jesus was born above the fall he was born above sex desire God said the day you eat that's the day you die he was born above that watch carefully Luke chapter 1 verse 42 when I write this down he said the fruit of the womb Hosea 9 16 fruit of the womb Isaiah 13 18 fruit of the womb he's just a few samplings of a hundred other scriptures I could give you Psalm 127:3 fruit of the womb do drop his seven thirteen fruit of the womb Genesis 30 and two fruit of the womb so children were a product of this fall in the Garden of Eden now watch when he becomes the mother of all living whatever she gives birth to it's gonna have this type of life inside of it when Eve falls in the Garden of Eden and gives birth to Cain what was Cain he was hybrid in one place the prophet of God called him a mongrel and a half-breed because remember the serpent was a man but he was also close enough to the animal kingdom that he could stand as a missing link between the two so there were parts of his cells that were not ordained of God mix with the woman although they could and by cross pollenization if you will and crossbreeding or high breeding the serpent and Eve it done something to the cells of humanity and member in this day that we live in there is no more natural serpents II that's all been blended together at one time the lines were separable when the sons of God Genesis six saw the daughters of men that they were fair they took in and then women our wives and then they blended those two lines together so we're all mixed up sitting here tonight with everything they just have to have your part this and part that and part together you're like a souffle with so many parts of the recipe you're not even sure what what the what the dish is called a man all we know is maybe black skin or white skin or yellow skin or red skin or ever what it might be hey but we're we're living in a body that has been developed by years six thousand years of crossbreeding and hybridization causes her cells with the serpent do you realize at that moment that's when cells begin to degenerate every cell began to fall now because God had perfection laid out here and because everything was in his perfect way sometimes man would live to be 969 years old but he never lived out a thousand because God promised the day you eat of is the day you die there's never been a man live a thousand years we will in the Millennium we will in the millennium time we will live out a thousand years to do what prove the curses off the proof ha that's been washed away but no man's live but they had strength they had strengthened their bodies strengthened their food because it was more pure but after six thousand years of high breeding what's happened a man's life spans down to fifty years could you imagine if we were sitting here tonight Noah ham Shem and Japheth Jacob and some of them it lived one hundred ninety seven years old four hundred and eighty seven years three hundred and forty I don't think it was dog years I think it meant years years I mean could you imagine some of the men sitting there looking around this room that I here you are by halfway bald-headed oh how old are you better be in one movie forty-one years old my goodness sakes life why I didn't start losing my hair till I was three hundred and eighty seven years old what is it our bodies are beginning to degenerate even more and more rapidly as we see the Day approaching our bodies are coming down to where brother brems said we ain't nothing but a bunch of us forgive me maybe that's what's left of us ain't nothing more than that now watch here in second Corinthians chapter 11 verse 1 2 and 3 now let's just take a couple verses here and just I want to talk about what happened here in the Garden of Eden for just a moment because it's very important to what we want to get to all right sacrum is eleven one two and three would to God you bear with me a little of my folly and indeed bear with me he said for I'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy for I've espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ as Paul here identifying how that Satan can not only pervert the mind but how he also perverted Eve's thinking as he said I don't want the devil twisting your mind like he twisted her mind remember the grass is always greener on the other side here's a woman in a perfect Church and yet the devil trying to trying to prove to her that God was hiding something from her well you could be a gaudy she already was he realized she had just as much power as Adam had she's Coleco with the rumor she didn't come subordinate to him until after the fall mm-hmm we talked about how Adams stood out there and could have spoke to a tree and moved it over there Eve could too she had the same Authority the same power that Adam had we talked about how Adam would have stopped the breeze he could have done it the difference was she was letting her husband be the boss well hallelujah at least blink got me sister it ain't gonna hurt nothin god absolutely set the whole thing in perfect harmony she had power he had power and the devil told this woman there's greener grass over yonder you could be a God knowing good and evil she what was right she knew what was wrong she'd heard everything there was because she quoted it back to the devil we may eat of the free to the the fruit of the trees rather of the garden but of the fruit that's in the midst of the garden we're not allowed to touch it or eat it lest we die well she knew what was right and yet the devil convinced her somehow God was hiding something I wonder if that wakes our brain up to thank for this a little bit sometimes the devil tells us lies and we chase after him oh it's going to be this way it's going to be that way oh I'll tell you this that the other we chase after the thing instead of praying about it to see if it's the will of God in the first place wonder how different the picture would have been if she said hold on serpent let me go talk to my husband a moment see what this all about a minute would solve the problem look here first Timothy chapter 2 verse 13 first Timothy chapter 2 13 14 for Adam was first formed then Eve Adam was not deceived oh you say you're a woman hater I'm just reading you what the Bible said is what the Bible said but the woman being deceived was in the transgression why she was going to be the mother of all living cancers a living organism tuberculosis is a living organism look at it in our microscopes even in a living figure she's going to become the mother of all living everything that could be passed she was going to give birth to it and Satan had enough brains to know that Adam was gonna be the one Bassett he might have had to see but he didn't have the bedding ground like she had she had the ability to either produce good or to produce bad and hang on she not only did that she produced good and evil she produced both of them first John chapter 3 verse 10 11 and 12 let's turn there for a moment first John 3 verse 10 11 12 oh you saw all brother being now come on I wasn't a dev on the garden of eat it well hold on a minute let's see if it was or not first John chapter 3 verse 10 in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil hmm interesting rather Keith if there are children of God and if there are children of the devil all right take me in the Bible to where the father showed up it's only one place you can go to find the father's book of Genesis as they don't have the mystery Jeremih I don't have it nahum habakkuk hosea joel amos ain't none of got the answer Esther that's her own story Ruth that's her own story they nowhere else in the Bible not Matthew Mark Luke John on any of the appalling letters not one place you go on the entire New Testament scripture to show me where the children of God and the children of the devil ever showed up at but the book of Genesis right back here with them two daddies in the beginning the fact that people can't see that it shows they don't want to see cuz right there it is in front of their eyes she becomes the mother of all living was Satan a living being yes he was Satan was going to father through that woman the the hybridization that would tear down every blood cell why the cells backslide and cancer get into them right there right now there's an order for a the backslide has got to die and Satan loves to dwell and dead things that's why the maniac of gonorrhea was hiding in the tombs because brother brems he loves to run deaf I told her young man in Nicaragua one time he come up one to receive the Holy Ghost he had a skull ring on his finger I said take that ring off you may get to hold it I think God's not a God of the Dead is a God of the living amen that's exactly right now watch it for this is the message you've heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain oh well John was said same idea I did he went right back to the book of Genesis did I not as Cain who was of that wicked one well how in the world did the devil figure that happen he's that smart number one and he understands watching the continuity of God he watched how God done the thing in the beginning he saw how Satan he saw how excuse me he's Satan rather saw how God had a perfect continuity had perfect harmony back yonder in the Garden of Eden and the devil sat back on the ends of the earth saying how can I mess that up I want to be God I want to have my own people I want to set up my own Kingdom I want people to worship me and I we have an expression back home I'll be a monkey's uncle y'all say I'm gonna let the dangle let God get that kind of glory so how can I mess it up and then he sees the woman he sees the buck deer he sees all the mail in the in the animal kingdom he says every one of them are beautiful the little humble female and they takes a look at what God did with Adam and Eve remember her name wasn't even need yet her name was Adam she wasn't even called Eve until after the fall come on somebody takes one look at and he realizes ha something's out of the continuity of God pick it up in the book of Romans and we know exactly what it is the the clay cannot say back to the Potter why did you make me this way it's very simple he made her that way so she could be deceived I'm gonna take it a step further I hope this don't knock you out of your chair but brother BAM said she was predestinated to be deceived God purposed her whole life was to be predestinated that she would fall in the Garden of Eden so all of this could be expressed out of God amen and it's something my not as Cain who said that wicked one I watch her in Saint John chapter 8 verse 39 i watch this I like this one of my favorite scriptures here in the Saint John 8 people think I'm a hard preacher they need to read your Bible the answer to sending them Abraham as our Father Jesus said if you were Abraham's children you'd do the works of Abraham all those kids were they if they didn't belong to Abraham who were they and I remember these people could prove their pedigree these people could go back in the in generations and say hey my great-great-great great-great-great great-great-great great-great great-great granddaddy was Ali bhai my great-great great-great I belong to the tribe of Benjamin right here's my name search it if you want to go back hundreds of years it was here for you us he said before Abraham was I am crazy he spent so much time out there on the Raby and sons brain is burnt out where Abraham's children he said if use Abraham's children you do his works well as Abraham's works he believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness looking at the deadness of Sarah's womb he called that which is not and said God's gonna give us a child in hell Amen that's right but now you seek - in other words you looked at the uncie you looked at that sit on the flesh we looked and see but now you seek to kill me a man that's told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham you do the deeds of your father they said unto him we're not born in fornication we have one father even God Jesus said in them if God we're your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came by myself but he that sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word ye are of your father the definition of this word father in the Greek is pates er which means to be the originator and the transmitter of a family spirit as a father I past nor odd genes to my daughters I passed the nor odd spirit over to my daughters don't think so no it is just in their their look of their nose and their ears and all that that they they follow the characteristics even how I behaved I passed down to them more than just my flesh I passed down to my behavior I passed in I mean how is it that I can lay in the bed okay and I wake up in the morning the first thing I do when I wake up in the mornings I stretch my right leg and stick my right arm up in the air like yeah how is it I can walk by my daughter's bedroom door and she's stretching that right leg and sticking that right arm up I didn't teach her to do that she's in or odd she don't have just nor our genes in her she's got a nor odd spirit in her over to God same thing Jesus is saying you of your father the devil in other words not only do you look like him but you've got his spirit on the inside hallelujah somebody everything locked up in him that's why they behave and think like the devil cuz they got the devil spirit in them how does Satan become a father he found a bedding ground he found a vehicle he could use to pass his jeans on naturally Cain was genetically born from the serpent but spiritually came was the son of the devil because spiritually it was the devil fathering a child through the natural man the serpent oh it was a man sure he was a man well somebody said he was a beast I don't what brother brems said he said he was a man hybrid religion are we called a condemnation my representation November of 1960 look it up he said the serpent wasn't a monkey he wasn't a reptile he said it wasn't a black person he said they're just as ignorant as they can be the serpent was a man that's the only thing that could mix with that woman but it was close enough that he had a hybridized party was close enough to the animals close enough to the man that when them cells crossed over not only did he Satan moves spiritually into that end of that boy but also naturally them perverted cells cross right on over to us she's the mother of all living what if it be that the author of that family can transmit his spirit or infuse his spirit into others govern their behavior when we talk about divine healing when we talk about needing what's the first thing the doctor does when you go in the office family history anybody else in your family had diabetes you might else you have family had heart trouble they want to know cuz they got enough brains to know it passes down from generation to generation well if heart trouble passes from your great-granddaddy down to you what about that stubborn spirit what about that temper remember the prophet of God said the reason that you're a rock-and-roll striptease talking about the girl that would live in moral it said because your mammy was a flapper and your grandma was a chorus girl but the band said one place that the mother's spirit on that baby makes an imprint on the life of that child you don't think it's so look at how Jacob when he striped the sticks and then cows looked in the water were pregnant its striped them cows people say you can't mark a child the bible doesn't say that the bible said you could so if a woman's a holy woman she's a righteous woman she can leave a righteous imprint upon her children what the Bible said right look here in Exodus chapter 34 verse 7 now we know what a demon is or a demon or a devil that's a tormentor of course but now looking at this how that it it moves into the realm of demonology look here exodus 34:7 it says keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children upon the children's children under the third and the fourth generation you say but glory to God I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but your flesh don't that body of yours don't have one converted cell in it it's just as much the same as it's always been only things getting weaker and wiser as we go along I'm a Christian but your body ain't you may swing it subject to the word but your body ain't a Christian you can't mark a child like that really that's not what the Bible was then the Bible said iniquity has passed on from generation to generation to generation do you realize that if you're born illegitimate sitting right here according to the Bible you're not allowed into the kingdom of God that's the Bible you say that I'm stuck but that's what that's the good news of this the blood of Jesus Christ once you get saved takes that mark away from you and you can go on into the kingdom of heaven but according to the Bible without the blood of Christ you in trouble hey God ain't changed his word for nobody he still looks at a legitimacy the same way he's always looked at it it's just now there's a blood Oh hallelujah to the lamb of God now there's a way that you can be cleared and go in amen you don't look at it the same way always looked at it watch this and the message called the power of the devil well I'd like to see his audience when he announced that text I want to preach it out on the power of the devil good lord sickness is not sometimes your sin directly but maybe you've inherited it from your parents oh you say well sure I wear eyeglasses my daddy wore eyeglasses I got high blood pressure my daddy had high blood pressure wait a minute wait a minute but what about that stubborn attitude from how you faced the devil it sure is but but to say the devil you got to go all the way back where I went tonight as to the Garden of Eden it ain't just the devil working on you that's you that's been handed down to you from your grandpa watch him in questions and answers when I ask brother Branham about a stubborn spirit he said well my Christian brother sister he said I find that it's usually a complex that causes this and as I go back into zermatt thousands of cases on the platform he said I find out that it goes back to a great-great great-great-grandfather we're and it's passed on down through the generations so you're not just passing down stud cancer tuberculosis or heart trouble or breast cancer some of their diabetes you're not just passing it to your children you're also passing that aptitude on if you're resistant against the word which I'm not saying in y'all arm we're just talking about about what this is doing healing is all about if you got a resistance against you know how pissed some people are you say why they say black just because you said why did it cuz they don't believe it they could agree with white but they say black because that's their nature they want to disagree with things well you think the kids are gonna be like you say white they'll say black black they gotta get the second one in they can't just get the first one they got to be a little bit more in the next generation well that's the spirit don't you realize we need divine healing from that we need divine healing from these spirits that's been passed on to us amen a stubborn attitude a stubborn spirit what Satan knew that once he got into the human race not only did he get into him spiritually but he got into him naturally and one thing the devil did was attacked their food system because he knew that the food they would eat would be the regeneration of life regenerating cells sustaining cells sir said huh well a man can eat a meat a eat a pot of potatoes and he can work for 12 hours and after about 12 hours more he needs more potatoes if you eat potatoes or if you're a meat type person he eats a state and then he needs another state huh good idea why don't I just go work on the food system I'll make him weaker as they go along Satan's has got his own laboratory set up he's a scientist he's figured out how to break into the human body because he realizes that this flesh is the only vehicle for your soul and if you're gonna serve God this is the only vehicle your soul is gonna serve God in so he effects that he tries to work on this system right here watches when a man has unconfessed sin don't forget Satan has a legal right to stay right where he's at but if you don't have unconfessed sin and y'all in a man's heart don't condemn him let him ask what he will he can receive divine anything hey man hey man what about depression they're proven now depression isn't something comes on somebody it's passed from generation to generation you take a man a woman you ever watch it it's like I used the little joke it's just a joke if his name's less he can never be more because he's less but I'm making a point the point is is that whatever that man is he's always gonna be that in his flesh the only thing that can give you overcoming power with that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that don't mean you won't battle it that don't mean you won't be the struggle of your lifetime remember the prophet of God said the greatest enemy you got is yourself so here he is he's last he can hurt him so here he comes on he's got certain type of ways about it mannerisms and things prophet of God talked about strains in a family he talked about said you know certain strains pass in a family you take a certain person in that might have a nervous complex he talked about in the prayer lines seeing a woman and said now sister you're a nervous person you've been that way since birth he said I see you all of your alive he said that's a strain that comes down through your family I see as a young girl a dog chases you up on the porch and you're scared always frightened something's gonna happen he said that was passed down to you we need to find healing tonight what causes a man a woman's mind to stay confused all the time what's been passed down to him look how this works in the human body so I'm at hybridization of food flashing red light paragraph said he won he said a few years ago look what man's got to in his body so look what he's things he's done science constant trying to make better food hybrid corn hybrid Tomatoes hybrid beatin the beef and the stuff is no good at all it's killing people and they don't realize it a few more years he'll be nothing like a bunch of jellyfish hello jellyfish that's where we are that's what we are yeah watch young people nowadays you put a rake in their hand rake some leaves after five minutes oh hey when a man was my age forty fifty sixty years ago like my dad when he was 42 years old when I was born put up with me the whole time I've been living on this earth moment coming on 40 years in March here in my dad's 82 years old and I if I smart it off the wrong way to 82 him out half-dead he liable to wear me out boy strong as him you he's weak his age has brought him there but he's got a whole lot more in him and I do it 42 years old he's a generation ahead of me he hasn't been affected like I've been affected they were stronger a generation ahead of us coming on down it gets weaker and weaker and weaker he said 50 years ago he said you go to the ballgame now this is 1963 so we're talking about 1913 the rounds are burned - okay many years ago 50 years ago a ball game went on like they do you never heard of anybody getting hurt I was born in Cincinnati Ohio is going to Dayton Ohio 45 minutes in Cincinnati Ohio hey let me tell you something you wasn't even allowed to live in Ohio unless you voted for the Cincinnati Reds though your heart you had to be a ball team coming up you had Johnny Bench Pete Rose I used to go to ball games when I was a kid they take us down to Riverfront they tore it down now it's the Great American Ballpark now you know and they got riverfront you should be right up here with the Bengals stadiums that now you see when you come over the bridge 175 I'm into that ballpark many times as a boy and I watch them play three or five three and four and five hour games all the time never once saw anybody carted off needing a medic medic to come by or a trainer to come by and see what's wrong with them but now you can go to a ballgame and huh I took the girls not too long ago I to know what a ballgame was I know I know don't throw me in hell I just I did it the one time okay and I want to just experience what a baseball game was all about because I enjoyed it when I was a kid I thought maybe it'd be nice experience for them we went down we sat down this thing and brother within an hour of playing the game they had to medic on the field eight different times and some of these guys can pick up the back end of a truck they're strong and they're all the way they look but it's nothing bad about a jellyfish hybrid food what brother brems said this day the Scriptures fulfilled it's exactly where we're living at you take about these boxing and boxing matches that years ago he said they'd soak their fists and vinegar and they'd fight a hundred rounds now they put pillows on the end of their hand and they can't go a minute and thirty without having to take a breath and get some water they don't mean they don't hit hard it means that our bodies aren't built to sustain the hits like they used to be and don't you know the devil's watching that because he sees your sails degenerate he sees your strength not what it used to be why don't we have all-night prayer meetings i said frankly to kill people they can have it they come into church and start praying after three hours their soul or out takes him a week to recover I look at me like that it's the truth when's the last time y'all had an all-night prayer meeting and my point exactly in the same mess we all then our bodies can't sustain the brunt and the strength of it Satan's plan that to be just that way first Timothy chapter four verse four four and five he said every creature of God is good nothing to be refused if it's received with Thanksgiving it is sanctified by the Word of God in prayer men remember many years ago back in Lima where the Brooks was preaching on this scripture it's all about if there would be a hybrid sale or a demon of cancer something be in that cell and then you take that cell in your body it could start multiplying in you you said but if you sanctify the food with the word of God in prayer cast them Devils out of that I believe that I believe that's what the word says is what the Bible said right here I believe that Amen what do they think people are dying with I'm a window tell me a time that you ever heard of people having to take so many antidepressants everybody's on a pill including me and I'm the preacher I take insulin I take LIBOR ID I take meant for Minh I take something for acid reflux come on Fred I'm barely 41 years old the only pill I should be taking right now is the gospel and I'm a diabetic bodies can't sustain what they used to sustain even in the study of diabetes are coming to find out it ain't being fat it causes people to absolutely become diabetic it's the diet the death of beta cells what's the beta cells is what puts forth your insulin out of your pancreas that's what makes your body level out and when then beta cells die you don't get them back what's causing them to die so it says cuz you're fat no eye candy no no no no because I've seen many as skinny people's skinnier and brothers Roy and bisa diabetic they're type 1 diabetic they can't even sort of stand of diabetes what's done it hi bird food satan got into the food system he struck the body she became the mother of all living organisms even these disease germs satan it i don't mean we lay down and die friends but we have to at least recognize what's happening around us i believe in running and dieting and eating healthy and all that i just don't want to do it all the time that's the problem mate I'm tired I don't feel like doing it I've been on the road 1,200 miles a week I come home I want to sit in my chair and drink Diet Pepsi I don't want to go run three miles like you died with heart trouble you probably you're probably right but it ain't because I want to he cares too you care injecting hybrid into this cattle you said God's come back into mankind according to science themselves making perversions because the cows hybrid the food is hybrid and the food makes blood cell the blood cells you're alive he said what are they done they inject the injections into the meat and now it's proved these injections take effect on the human race scientific you says they spray the fields with DDT of course they don't do that no more they got a whole lot worse stuff they just don't call it DDT anymore it's a glory to God I'll beat them at their own game I'll eat organic and what was in that ground you were organically growing it's just as polluted as the other so you say halle-loo you're not mine really well you might be an eighteenth of an eighteenth of an eighteenth better than the guy next door to you in the grocery store but the ground you brought it up just as polluted as the guy over there it's getting the same result even though one may be a little cleaner than the other come on somebody well I'll take vitamins I'll take pills I'll take oils my wife sells them by the way I didn't believe in him I said hogwash well I had a headache and she rubbed one of them headache oils on my back man and my headache went away I said hallelujah month later had a comeback though it worked but not permanently huh well I got triglycerides take fish oil sure after so long this oil brings the triglycerides down guess what happens you think glory to God I'm free of you start eating McDonald's hamburgers again a month later you're right back up taking fish oil all over again why can't the body sustain what you're putting into it it's jellyfish the cells are soda generated that it can't it can't bring it back up like it used to don't you see the only hope that we've got for this thing's over with is the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and divine healing in our bodies now a man is the Lord that gives us our health listen this see I love this remark to me it seems ridiculous in a way to think a prophet would take his time to even even prophesy about this but think of this remark he said now he said eight hundred years ago or assuming eight hundred sick people excuse me in this community he said here from eating eggs he said you remember years ago we had a little bit of structure there and I was prophesying that have come to pass don't live in a valley and don't eat eggs of all the things for God to use a prophet Alijah to prophesy about don't live in a valley and don't eat eggs you say it ain't important but it is important everything he's talking about right here has something to do with our bodies in the way it's made up right now what do they start saying eggs bread a lot of cholesterol and a mini the man eat an egg and he starts increasing his chances for heart trouble oh I know they probably disapprove it just give him 10 years he'll prove it back on the other side again and they can't find what is the source of all of this I'll tell you the source I'll spell it for you e ve she was the mother of all living all of this amen and you got to know the devil new to some degree what was getting ready to happen when that little woman left the Word of God he knew what was going to take place somehow he knew all of this would fall apart I don't who you thank God for truth amen oh thank you Jesus power transformer sir I believe every seat should bring forth of his ha of its kind the human race the plant being interbred brought in someplace eating food from the earth which our bodies he said made from the earth hybrid he said now if our bodies are falling 20 and 25 years old women going into menopause he said men's hips getting wider woman's hips getting smaller she can't even bring forth the birth that's what it used to be you know they'd have a lot more strength to bring forth the birth now just go ask your local doctor ask some of these brothers in the medical community how many caesareans take place over natural birth in a year's time why they know she can't bring forth like she used to they see the heart rate doing a certain thing the blood pressure doing certain they they're watching the mama they're watching that monitor Washington they say we better get that baby out of here we in trouble why our bodies are failing now watch what he says here if it's fairly because of degenerated cells by hybrid food don't our brain cells also degenerate I'm gonna say something you're gonna laugh but I don't mean it as a joke have you ever seen so many brain-dead people in all your life in this generation women that talk to the last a lot of people ain't got a good mind anymore they don't they don't their cells have degenerated kids nowadays I don't mean these boys sitting here like he's young people sitting Oh Your Honor I'm not the generation of teenagers you sit and try to have an intelligent conversation with just regular teenagers oh my god they can't even carry a normal conversation today because they can't learn it's because something is wrong in the way that their brain fires REM told us what it was their cells are degenerating I'm not bashing young people I'm just talking about a generation coming on beyond us he said isn't that cells as well he said that's why Ricky runs down the street in the hot rod and the RIC Etta and our Vitas and the many of them we call names out there half-naked before the people they are mentally gone with no more conceptions of decency or morals why I mean honest to god the people of our nation I heard an interview just the other day David Letterman was interviewed and Barack Obama I had access to Netflix and I pulled it up but I was interested in seeing the interview because I I know the interaction between those two and how David Letterman's pulled for Barack and his homosexual agenda and I was interested to hear what he had to say I had a way I made a wave got pulled it up on the telephone I was looking at the interview and there's these two men press in the United States and one of the we called him a leader and he is a leader to many of the people there was a television show and a bunch of joke and then cutting up and carrying on but yet to the people he's a political mind and they're they're sitting there talking about I just can't understand how that people could turn them away for their sexual orientation because it actually makes sense that a man would kiss another man in the mouth a woman gets another woman in the mouth and call it love that's the generation of brain cells that's common decency and normalcy to them it proves what this prophet of God said right here they're crazy they've lost their nine he said it come to pass and the last day that people would go totally insane and here we are look at the United States of America the towers come down everybody gets religious well sure they do because they got fear everybody got scared hold on oh no I'm a month later now Bush is gonna fight their war for him and they're protected they forget all about it common thinking common sense thinking people would have said this is a judgments on let's get to our knees and get right with God I'll forget about it a month later we need to by kneeling we need to by kneeling notice again demonology brother man said let's see what a cancer is let's take him a party cells he said but down as you keep going down into that he said there's a spirit in that one cell he said now if the doctor can cut into the thing and get that one cell where the demons out he said that he's gone he said but in divine healing you to speak to the spirit cut out of him and then your body purifies the cells that's divine healing absolutely it's divine here in numbers chapter 12 verse 11 12 13 turn though him if you will for this moment now let me show you God wasn't just a healer in the New Testament he's a healer in the old as well you know no numbers 12 verses 11 through 13 oh I'm having a good time I don't know about you but I'm enjoying the word I know this isn't my usual runaround scream kick and holler but just this way I felt led to handle it tonight just bring a little bit of depth to this so we can learn together numbers 12 11 12 13 aaron senator moses i'll ask my lord I beseech thee lay not the sin upon us when we have done foolishly when we have sinned come on Miriam now let her not be as one dead of the whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb and Moses cried unto the Lord saying heal Rapha heal her now O God I beseech thee no blood Jesus know by His stripes and yet Moses is identifying God as a healer hallelujah the New Covenant didn't make him a healer he was always a healer but now we know a man through the blood of Jesus Christ we could be he'll remember healing comes through many avenues but one source I mentioned one time to you at the beginning of the service God heals by music that's look 1963 from look it up God heals my love God hears my understanding God heals my medicine thank you medicine he said if you got rats chewing holes in your house he said you lay out rat poison you see got a disease in your body you're poisoning that's what your medicines for kills the rats but the holes still there God's ones got to heal the hole a man God is the healer yes sir healing was not something established just by the new covenant but as a part of the Old Covenant in other words God never changed his attitude toward healing his people I am the Lord that healeth all thy diseases he just carried this over into the New Testament why because Jesus Jehovah the oldest Jesus 70 so if he's a healer then he's got to be a healer now Oh hallelujah son even if he's a hill of that he's gonna be the same yesterday today and forever God that he'll God that delivers God that brings divine here doctors don't heal a doctor can set the bone but God someone's got to here the bone doctor can perform LASIK on your eyes and cut in all them lasers and all that kind of stuff but God's the one that brings the healing to the eye that's right one reason they have been able to heal cancer is because they haven't be able to find the right medicine to kill the right rat give them time if they can ever get figured out the chemistry of the body and how that comes together and let one react to create another reaction to create another reaction to go straight to that cell and squeeze that devil out of canceler be a thing of yesterday I pray God everyday helps them find it but until then God is our Rafa our healer that's what Moses called him here say God Rafa Rafa heal her now what was he Jehovah Jireh jehova sholom jehova inside jehovah el Gabor but he was Jehovah Rapha how do you feel religious even God is hot yeah I don't care what anybody says he's still here not just of our bodies but our minds our spirits our complexes our attitudes everything that there is to our degenerated cells somehow - send me another day you probably find this humorous I'm a DD attention deficit disorder I said I don't doubt it so I need help from it I said yeah well I'm gonna take this pill I'm gonna take I said no doubt thank you medicine do what you're supposed to do I said but don't forget God is a healer well brother Ben you'd understand my won't my brain ain't wired like who's the one that wired your brain in the first place tell me how did it get so confused I can't just ask God to give you a rewire job it's your brain straightened out you can think like you're supposed to thank you say well ain't that easy well it ain't easy to heal cancer either but he's God that does it anyways I didn't say I could do it I said he would do it I'll never change this attitude toward children toward healing towards children remember sickness can sometimes be used as a whip for disobedient children but God is a healer of all sicknesses let me give you some Old Testament examples you want to write this down or as you get the message later second king is twenty and eight refers to Hezekiah and his healing before the Lord 2nd Kings chapter 5 9 through 11 also verse 14 speaks of name and being healed of his leprosy in 2nd chronicles 7:14 the Bible said if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face turn from their wicked ways I'll hear from heaven I'll forgive their sin and heal their land you realize when sin strikes a nation and nation becomes divided and leaves the Word of God that nation is sick and needs divine healing but what happens when you reject your healer what happens do you say God a doctor brings a pen full of needles and you say I don't need it spit the medicine between your fingers then you're stuck in your conditions and the doctor will never come back to it listen me carefully if we want real divine healing in our spirit or mind or soul we've got to accept our atonement we've got to accept our healing because like with this nation God sent healing to this nation in the form of Malachi four and five and four in the form of other fivefold evangelists and teachers and prophets and what more to this nation and this nation rejected God's healing power to bring it back to Calvary back to an old fashioned for friends this nation's dying of it's sores it's dying of it's sicknesses and God refuses to even administer a piece of medicine to it they rejected it that's why they're dying like they are that's why the death of this nation is becoming even more and more and more look how they're corrupting they get more corrupted all the time why cell by cell like a man laying in a bed being eat up of cancer and this dying that dying become an emaciated his bones failing his is his muscles being whittled away that's what's happening to this nation hey man she's on her death she's on her death rattle now Psalm 6 and 2 David asked the Lord to healing he said be healed my bones from vexed heal me Lord he cares that you care I believe God heals my medicine God heals my surgery God heals my understanding God heals my love just a little love goes a long way let somebody be all upset and show them you care God heals my love how could be an set me a sickness you've been cut you ever been cut ever had somebody offends you and you bleed for days over it you need healing your spirit bleeding wounded you need healing God still our healer God heals by love he said God heals by prayer God heals by miracles God heals by His Word God heals whatever the source is God heals in mark 3:15 he gave him power to heal sicknesses cast out devils Luke 4:18 you said the Spirit of the Lord is on me because he anointed me to preach the gospel of the poor he sent me to heal the brokenhearted this is st. cancer tuberculosis we're talking about God's the healer of broken hearts if you've been cut God knows how to heal that cut just like I heard he would speak to me just a few nights ago when you're cut it bleeds when you bleed the blood staunch is once the blood staunch is a cab a scab forms over the scab eventually falls off leaves a scar you always remember it but God brings healing God heals jesus was sent to heal the brokenhearted recovering the sight to the blind that have livers to captives to set at liberty them that are bruised well listen to me now sometimes it isn't a natural healing but you know they say when a man a woman has been assaulted mentally and they go through like a breakdown of some sort it leaves like a a bruise on the brain they've identified that the brain actually it's almost like it's been punched somebody goes through a traumatic event that's what Jesus was sent to heal glory he was sent to heal those and nervous breakdowns he was sent to heal those with with with bipolar problems and amen and tri-polar problems and whatever PO I don't care what pole you're on he's here to heal it hallelujah he is our [Music] the greatest healing of all second Corinthians 5:1 through to this earthly body the surface of Tabernacle be dissolved we already have one waiting eternal in the heavens what does divine healing speak of in this body here it speaks that guy's God changed the cells to reflect healing in my body he'll also change my body to reflect an eternal soul because what good would it do to be an eternal soul and having to have a dying body so God gives me a body one day that's gonna reflect my soul over to God amen and then it'll be eternal life dwelling in a human body you ever stop to wonder why you struggle closing now you ever stop to wonder why you fight why this seems like sometimes it's your mind mentally you just can't see you know the problem is you need divine healing you need God to touch your mind touch your spirit touch your heart it isn't just physical you know maybe not be healed from diabetes so much but what about that bruised heart we have some I lie on you or say something that wasn't right and you know it wasn't right and yet that heart is bleeding and bleeding and cut and bleeding and bleeding as all you can think about it's all you can meditate on and every time you try to get away from it it comes right back to you in the middle of the night and you cannot escape it you need divine you stand again praise the Lord let's pray right now for God to bring us some divine healing to our life Lord Jesus I want to thank you the service tonight lord thank you for how you've moved amongst us as your children Lord we love you and we appreciate you me thank you we give you glory in this house knowing Lord Jesus that you are the great God the eternal and Lord Jesus we are looking now to you to come

hard for us to get over some of these wounds and scars that we've accumulated through the years Oh God many of us standing here Lord maybe we battle nerves that might be the battle we battle all the time we might battle diseases and disease germs but God what about a stubborn attitude what about temper what about impatience and all them things passed down to us oh god that's why I believe this bride is gonna be an overcoming bride because Lord she's not just going to overcome her generation but 6,000 years of generations of sin and disgrace been passed down to her and she's gonna whip every bit of it by the blood of Jesus Christ in the word of her testimony help us tonight God bring divine healing ORF our healer bring healing to us tonight our fo you are our healer my Lord Jesus God we claim your healing power in our lives our spirit for our mind for our soul why would a young person or an old man or old woman or middle age of some so why would they put a gun to their brain blow their brains out Lord they had a sickness they had a wound they had an injury their brain was almost like bruised and it was such a deep cut such a deep sore my it was overwhelming to them they couldn't function they couldn't operate so they chose to end it rather than to move on what was that person needing divine healing Oh God if there'd be anybody like that here tonight anybody in the sound of our voice side that needs healing in any way I pray Lord you be our rough our healing help us Lord Jesus for we know by your stripes we are already healed we love you tonight Lord Jesus in
