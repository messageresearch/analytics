[Music] what a perfect song amen amen we're just going to get right into the word of God thank you musicians Hallelujah I'm glad he got into my life the battles go get their rage gets hard sometimes you know people don't want to admit that but it does when you think about carrying a cross and and you know at this day and time the way the world is Christians are not how could I say it a favorite of the world but that's the way God ordained it no wonder Paul said I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation we're going to come from second Corinthians remember we are still dealing with the the theme topic of the meaning of Calvary what did it what was the meaning what was the reason for it and basically what's the benefits uh because you know even the psalm says forget not all your benefits amen so there are many benefits uh that a Christian can partake of uh in God so second Corinthians 11 will begin at the first verse we all have days of success and we sometimes have days of failure but in all of that we still conquerors because uh you know our our conquest or our uh is not us it's Christ and hopefully we'll be able to show you it bring you a peace and a joy sometimes we the enemy he's an accused of the Brethren he knows we're weak when it comes to this flesh uh but Paul separated the whole thing and he says it's not I I'm not doing that he said there's a law in my flesh but the inner man he glorifies God second Corinthians 11 1-4 . I've seen where Satan make a man have a hard time during the daytime and then when he gets to church he feels unworthy to praise God all right I've got news for you the devil is a Deceiver and when you become worthy to praise God let me know how you did that because none of us are worthy to praise him if you just consider that what I'm saying because you feel good doesn't make you Worthy in times when you're feeling bad it doesn't make you Worthy the only thing that makes you Worthy is the blood of Jesus Christ second Corinthians 11 1-4 and it reads what to God ye could bear with me a little in my Follies and indeed bear with me [Music] should I wait for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear less by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his substitute so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ but if he that cometh preaches another Jesus who we have not preached or if we receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with it bear with him one more scripture will be coming from second Corinthians 5. 21st verse for he hath made him to be sin for us 21st verse right in 5 21. who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him made the righteousness of God in him let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves and father I pray Lord God that you would strengthen the believer those who are here tonight normally as usually lord it's only a few come out on Wednesday I don't understand that but I pray father God that wherever your people are you made bless them anointed eyes with eyes out that they might see the day that we're living in Lord you said when we see that day approaching that we ought to come together the more and father even in the times that we do come together we have so many that seemed so uninterested in being here but Lord I know they'll they'll be here if they really truly loved you so I pray that you will increase their love and abide in the spirit of slothfulness and laziness Lord have mercy on your people we need you in these last moments of history in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated on Sunday we told you that we were going to be ministering beginning a little thought on The Church Without spot wrinkle or blemish and for a long time I I believe you're not uh believe it or not I didn't understand how I was going to achieve that even as a Christianity that would stumble me because I knew how faulty I was and in all of my efforts there wasn't a day that I didn't come short and so that would always trouble me because I didn't understand it I did not understand that we traded places Christ I didn't understand that he became my sin that I might be made the righteousness of God when it comes to the scripture Paul in second Corinthians warning the church about the Antichrist spirit and I want to say by the grace of God that the whole of America is the Antichrist spirit we understand a man uh Wendy embodiment of that spirit will come into a single man but at this point in time that anointing has anointed this whole civilization man whether you be in America whether you be in Asia whether you be in Africa The World At Large is totally insane what it's really astonishing to me is that people even now don't even know that we have already entered into World War III everybody thinking that it's coming but it has already begun but we find out that we don't see the people of God stirred and I don't know about you but if I knew that a hurricane was coming or a tornado was coming in the light of my district or my house I would find some kind of safety provisions I wouldn't just sit there and say hey it's coming and I feel like this is what's happening to the people they are Bewitched Spellbound they have lost the Zeal and lost the desire to to serve God I don't know about you but I I battle every day and it ain't always with the devil it's with me my will trying to die to my will because this flesh love pleasure and we know that we're living in an age in a time where the people of pleasure more than they love God no doubt many people who are not here tonight they're in some kind of pleasurable setting they're either eating dinner or with their friends or they're looking at TV or monitor but all of these things happen and none of these things have has anything to do with Jesus Christ and when you choose to do such thing you are speaking with your action that you love pleasure more than God because brother Branham said A True Believer one that has the Holy Ghost can hardly wait for the doors of the house of God to open you don't have to beg them you don't have the prod they're going to be there so but Paul was warning that uh it's a simple thing Satan is a wise adversary and don't you ever take him for granted and you know because he deceived Eve with one changing of the scripture where God says you shall die he said You shall surely not die here was a woman who was whole in Beauty whole in character a holy she wore the Garment of Praise if you want to say it like that the the light of God covered their nakedness and all it took was a smart fella recall the serpent to seduce her and he and he seduced her by way of reasoning and psychology and and she walked out of the will of God being deceived she really thought she was doing right and that's what a lot of people are thinking now there's nothing wrong with what I'm doing if I'm elected I've had somebody to say that to me if I'm elected to be bride I'll be there what a terrible attitude because if you really believe that you would be your bride you're doing everything possible to please God to walk with God and to maintain your fellowship with God this whole civilization as brother Adam said is insane and he said the only people on the face of the Earth at the coming of the Lord that would that would have sanity would be the true Christians but now we're living in a situation where wrong is right and right is wrong just like they this uh Transit they call it a she but anyway first time a woman you know went into a school and and killed children or people hello it was not a woman no matter how you dress it up it's a man the DNA says she is a he and you know it just made me sick to my stomach when I was hearing the newscaster saying she and a woman I'm like you deceive people even nature tells us there's only two genders and that's male and female but that's just how insane people are even animals knows the difference but we who are so smart and supposed to be at the head of this thing has belittled ourselves don't you know people don't in this woke situation people don't even appreciate being men they want to be cats and dogs and cows and name it and you have to give them respect for that totally totally totally insane now I can get in trouble by saying this but I don't care because I'm in trouble already because I'm a real Christian foreign Hallelujah see you if you stand still something's wrong you got to keep pushing this is a pressing way and remember Brothers It's a narrow way and as we get closer to the translation it's going to get narrower that means all your baggage you got to lay it down that's right is that right it's like when when Jesus said it's it's it's impossible for a rich man uh to be saved or to move or to go into the eye of a needle and I didn't know the eye of a needle when I was young in in the gospel I thought it was like you know a little needle in your soul with but no there was a place there in in Israel Pakistan wherever it is but in order for the cameras to go through they had to unload this camel the Camel had to get on his knees and they had to have pulled him through it was a it was a narrow way you see so what God was saying is that you got to humble yourself you got to unpack all your stuff and then somebody gonna help pull you through and that is the Holy Spirit yes what's going to happen to these people when they change the money system y'all know they're going to do it right not tomorrow is in our day you better believe it and win the dollar and all of that is no good what on Earth are you going to do y'all better hear what I'm saying because this is not our world this world has been ordained to perish and now we see all the leaders of the world Anointed with the spirit of destruction because they're getting ready to destroy it they're not going to be a a fourth world war it's just a third one and that that's where we have already entered into it has not escalated in the place that is going to escalate too but it's here and my point is have you made yourself ready or are you making yourself ready brother Adam says and the message works is Faith expressed 1965. he said we we realize he's praying he we realize father that we're in a dying generation of people we're headed or faced with eternity the world has gone insane murders little girls being cut to pieces and ravished the people men wearing their hair like women and women like men they're just perverting the race is dying the world is a dying everything is a dying the church is dying hello 1965. and it was dying then where is it now oh God bring bring life oh God life of faith reveal to these people Lord I can only pray and lay my hands upon them but you're the one that can heal them and you're alone can heal them I pray that you will father to each and everyone granted with my hands upon them and asking with all my heart in the name of Jesus Christ heal these people I use that quote because we still need healing yes not just of the physical but mainly of the Soul healing of the spirit we need it this church needs a Revival and we know what Revival is it's not all in the music and the jumping in the shouting and speaking in tongues all of those things are good but a true Revival is when God the anointing comes in and moves the trash out of your life see because we're at a place we can't even move the trash the prophet God said we are in a changing dispensation in identification with Christ in all ages he said and we're in a changing dispensation that's in 1964. we're changing now every change just like building a building you come to the corner you have to make that that bend it it's strange everybody wants to run right straight on down and you'll have just one big wall but we're building a building and we'll come to a corner we'll come to a corner and you've got to change those corners see that's where we're running into issues people in the message are not turning the corner as Brother Don price so well he he said so well started not long ago at those changes is where the Trouble Comes where is hard on that corner to make cut that corner and make it just right see that's what's happening we have been where we are since the prophet died Hallelujah but you see the problem is the change started changing the corner started at the opening of the word we see things amen and hear things Amen in this age that they didn't hear yeah they didn't see it they didn't even know it Hallelujah and now we must understand what is the corner change what is the change if you understand the house brother Branham said it's a pyramid Hallelujah and the changing of the corner is leading us right into what the headstone and the thing that we must understand by God's grace is as we turn we change he said he saw the preview of the bride and she was walking to the tune of the word or and then on another occasion she said marching to Onward Christian Soldier but he said as they walked amen they began to he didn't use the word translate but he said they began to step higher and higher they ascended they began to ascend Hallelujah but the church she was naked insane and didn't even know it with all of that worship she began to go down Hallelujah but the Bride of Jesus Christ she is ordained to go up this is what I'm saying the message must bring change in your life if it's not bringing change something's wrong and if there if there's nothing stirring your heart for a change you see what I'm saying that's where the change began it begins in Your Heart Lord I want to do better Lord I want to be closer Lord I want to be in your image Lord I want the statue of Christ to be fulfilling me I desire amen that Divine love oh Lord feel me like David said to my cup runs over see stand this in this system we were like Israel coming out of law into Grace because whether you realize it or not amen denominations they had Grace but they stopped and they went on with law you got to do this you got to do that you got to do this you got to do that if you don't do this if you don't do that you're lost and they left God out of it every one of them Luther Wesley Pentecost message it got to the place amen it was man leadership over God's leadership a lot of people don't like that but it's true anyhow where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty and remember I said what does it mean to be free indeed Jesus said I will make you free indeed is that right oh brother Branham you can't go over there but the spirit of the Lord told me to go over there you hear what I'm saying he he could care less about all the politics around him he was able to hear the voice of God and he did what God wanted him to do and people like that gets in trouble with the hierarchy is that right what we need to understand that we're no longer in law The Headstone came to with Grace you see what it is the problem is we're not getting the people to Christ hello you get them to the Holy Ghost and you won't have to worry about how long the dress is and how tight the dress is and how you know man woman we won't have to worry about those Elementary things Holy Ghost bring conviction and because I'm your preacher and you're going to be scared of me how long would that last it's not the invisible Union what you've got to not do I want you to I'm I'm quote this quote and you need to believe this it will set you free if you truly believe it it doesn't mean Satan won't fight your mind but you got to believe this quote coming from the invisible Union of the bride of Christ paragraph 228. but the word Justified is though you've never done it amen it's not even regarded at all how is it done in the god in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book and marriage is divorced and dead it's not even in the memories of God amen amen now you must think I'm crazy but I'm gonna tell you something you know how the devil tricks have tricked me in the past of making me stumble and fall by bringing back memories he uses memories to weaken you to make you fall or to make you stop oh come on y'all know what I'm talking about yeah but why should we remember if God doesn't remember [Music] he said it's not even in the memories of God Amen you are Justified therefore being justified it was accused you was accused you've never done it in the first place see that's what Paul said the good that I would I don't do and I find myself doing the things I wouldn't Paul say hey it's not me said the same thing it's not you you've never done it in the first place the old Union is in the sea of God's forgetfulness you wasn't married to it to begin with he the bridegroom bore your shame himself for you in your place he became our sin that we would be made the righteousness of God Hallelujah that's right you wasn't married to it to begin with he the bridegroom bored your shame himself for you in your place now put that in the devil's face if you can believe this you are Rapture Ready [Applause] Hallelujah yeah for your shame for you you see people don't even in this message don't even understand the principles of the Gospel and that's Calvary he paid it all Hallelujah and then when the lamb came and took the book he proved he was the one who paid it all Hallelujah free indeed they don't know what they're talking about but thank God Almighty I'm faith at last Hallelujah so you you look at that in homo seems impossible to believe it but believe it yes it's true it's real that's where the joy of the Lord comes in to know I am free he paid my debt Hallelujah is that right even as a man brother Branham made mistakes all the way up he was human I would listen to his prayers but he was free he understood his position [Music] and he knew he loved God and he knew God loved him Hallelujah see that's all I'm saying when you begin to see what all God has done for you you can't help but to love him and you can't help but to hurt when you fall short Hallelujah now if your sin is not bothering you if you don't when you come short and it doesn't bother something's wrong with you you need to be born again right but when you do wrong the first thing you know you feel and sometimes you can't believe you did what you just did or said what you just said y'all know you know what I'm saying yeah your place what bride before the foundation of the world the Bible says so you are predestinated seed Hallelujah I've rarely preached this quote why because so many people get the wrong idea they think oh I'm predestinated I'm bride so I can do what I want to do and if you're out there sinning with that kind of mentality I doubt if you've even even been born again because the bride knows she's free and she knows no matter what she does she can she'll be forgiven but she does everything she could do to keep from sinning against God that's the truth Hallelujah Jesus the thing is we fail to recognize him God have mercy that's why G Brothers say keep the Lord before you keep him before you sing praises to Him do whatever you got to do keep him before you in the message presence of God unrecognized he said but we've got to recognize his presence and now how you recognize his presence is when his promised word for this age is made manifest not promised word of Moses age or any other age the promise of the word for this age now let me ask you a question how did you know that this message was right we saw Jesus Christ making himself known through a man called William Branham you can't be ashamed of that it's reality right but now that he's gone remember the prophet God said if a prophet or a man comes with uh with whatever kind of gift and says he is and he doesn't bring a different message than the one that was before him he said you don't believe that that's why the brother random couldn't leave off the scene until another message it's the same message like the Bible is the same word but it's just a more revelation of it right right that was given to the bride and he said she will be able to read through the lines now let me tell you something you can't be reading through the lines if you're not spiritual this is to me to most people what I'm preaching now is blasphemous because brother I'm coming into is that everything he is we are see this is the maturing of the Bride She's Not Afraid Of The Challenge or however you want to put it she's not afraid she realizes that God is bringing us into a place we've never been before Hallelujah and he's not talking about perfecting this he's talking about perfecting this the inner man is in so much control he literally binds this flesh if you think the flesh is not going to just lay down and you say okay you know no no no no every day you got to deal with this thing right listen the word of God as I said earlier he became our sin that we might become I'm talking about without spot wrinkle or blemish there is no human way no possibility for you to be able to present yourself before God without spot wrinkled or blemish a way had to be made and that way was through Jesus Christ's sacrifice the blood of the Lamb is that right even in the Old Testament every vessel would sprinkled with blood Hallelujah and you've got to have your blood experience Hallelujah that's right that's right it's simple and Paul said I'm really concerned in Corinthians he says lest you be beguiled as Eve was beguiled she was tricked and let me tell you something the trick of this whole thing is you this thing can move into it so easily into a systematic worship it would be very difficult for you to see it huh it takes the Holy Spirit to sound the alarm but what about Ephesus what about Ephesus when they were there in Ephesus and this little nicolating deed came in everybody didn't see it but those who want the Holy Ghost they hated the deed and it was it was all about hierarchy one man being greater than the other Hallelujah that's not the gospel Jesus washed his disciples feet and said this is what I want you to do come down to the same level one blood for one body see Hallelujah you and I must understand by the grace of God that we are here to be free not to be placed in bondage all over again amen so now we are invited into you see that's that's why so many people didn't stand doing the coven because they were so involved into a systematic worship to when their system was taken away the god that they worship was taken with it [Music] you love Jesus where did he disappear to yeah you understand me and my point is this did the mighty angel of Revelation 10 come down he came down one for the land one on the sea did he ever leave us no he's here the power of God is here even brother Bradham called it he said the super anointing it's here but you know what if you don't tap into it it's not his fault huh let me tell you something about a woman that the Bible talked about Mary who is a prostitute right she heard that Jesus was at Simon's house she was disconnected but she heard about what he had done and she pressed through the crowd she went through all of the criticism right and when she saw Jesus she went to his feet what did she do she humbled herself didn't even ask him for nothing see that's what people don't understand you don't always have to ask with your mouth when your heart is right God is going to say what is it that you want right he go right down to the source and he'll give you what your hearts desire you said brother Brooks I don't know about you well let's show you how he did it with brother Branham there were people out in the audience praying Lord please let that Prophet call my name praying inwardly I don't know but here was a man all the way in the front of the auditorium heard y'all understand what I'm saying what was it he said God would go out of his way to bless you and he will because there were ones who were battling with doubt and I believe he said oh oh you're going to miss it you're going to miss it uh let me and he calls their name he said I I hope that helped you right and that was the Holy Spirit helping them over the hump listen we don't understand a lot of things but one thing I know God has ordained us to be victorious over the devil and he'll do everything he can to help us get over the hump is that right that true everything Hallelujah and just like God used to profit God want to use us now we don't we don't have that gift that's only one in one in a lifetime you know what I mean but but as a bride when you take on this message you literally take on the son of man that's a quote he said it and we and we must understand that same son of man that stood there William Branham is in the bride right now amen [Music] he said now so now we're invited to to him so now we are invited to him to be partaker of all that he is did y'all hear what I'm saying he said to be partaker this is the meaning of Calvary it's to restore the man the humankind back to the proper position as two sons and daughters of God by the way I'm saying when those seals were opened right I love this because he said I'm paraphrasing it it put us back into the position of Adam before he fell now think about it meditate on that everything was all or had to obey him the Sun the moon the stars the wind the rain the trees everything the animals had to obey him now he wasn't like some of these people let me see what can I do now mountain move over here no no no no no everything was inspired by the cool the voice that walked in the cool of the Hallelujah it was a voice the very voice that inspired him is the very voice that inspires us that's why God could have a human being in this age just one man representing him because now it's a courtship between him and his bride Eliza has to step aside oh y'all better understand what I'm saying that's what it really is well yeah it's the truth we're invited to him which is which is hid to the unbeliever by the veil of human flesh nobody could see God in brother Branham they thought he was just a not everybody I mean some people did I mean just like some people saw who Jesus was and most of the religious people never did see him even in G in brother bear who say most of the religion people never did see who he was or what he represented even though he told him straight up at times they still didn't believe him they ain't that funny they didn't believe him but they were afraid of him they're like I try to tell people I said yeah y'all talk about brother Brandon bad now because he's not here I said if he was here you wouldn't be said the things you're saying right they know it's the truth the man can't defend himself you know they Twisted a lot of things brother Branham said even when he was alive so you can imagine what what they're doing now yeah let's move on we're invited into him which is here to unbelieve us by the veil of human flesh see they know that Glory they read of it in the word here the glory of God and the things like that it's just words to them to us it's a manifestation see it is a normal word I love this it is a reality see this message to me is a reality because nothing could have changed me like God Has Changed Me [Applause] am I am I where I want to be no but I can see a movie I can see a change and the changes is in his own time but I know he promised that he'll make all things beautiful to the Lord like that I said Lord you said you'll make all things beautiful in your time yes sir I believe that Hallelujah I might look like a little ugly duckling right now but that same little ugly duck can turn out to be a beautiful swan Hallelujah yes sir in God's own time yes he said God said let there be light that was the word but now there is light it ain't the word it's the light see what I mean now it isn't just written word to God us it's a reality this message is light at one time it was on the word it was on the pages of the book but now it is a reality and that's what I don't think people are seeing we are literally seeing the manifestation of what God meant when he said let there be light we are in him now we're enjoying now he behold now we Behold Him now we see him the word manifesting himself is hid out there because why it's veiled in human flesh that's it yeah I've had people call me all kinds of names I mean people who believe this person because it wasn't given to them to understand and some of them don't even believe the message no more I had a precious brother who had a gift of discernment of something he had I know God used him in my life and he tried to turn me away from this message brother I'm at a point of no return [Laughter] I'm too deep in this I said I'd have laid my soul on this I have what else God excuse me TD Jakes whatever whatever his name is whatever you know what I mean maybe I shouldn't call his name but the point is you know you you Osteen yeah he looked too much like a priest you're gonna get in trouble boy that's all right like I said I'm in trouble already because I'm a Christian Hallelujah amen his name is exalted above all names listen we can't glorify people that's not preaching the gospel yet they say they are out of all those people how many of them you think know Jesus now I read to you Paul talked about it there are many jesuses but if they're not preaching the Jesus Paul preach it's another one huh now Paul said in the inspiration of God he said I want to know him not just in the power of his resurrection but I want to know him in his suffering but we don't want to know him any suffering well maybe that's a different Jesus you got y'all understand me because when you sold out to God you don't mind suffering for him huh I've had you know what my young Christian days they call you a holy roll I have my the man we was renting from and he came to pick up the rich and me and Ruby started testifying about the Lord he said you Holy Rollers that might have been my first time hearing about a Holy Roller but you know because I was how I enjoy being a Christian the problem that bothers me I wish I was a better Christian that's the thing right his name is exalted above all names to approach God you must approach him in the name of Jesus Christ he is the door the truth the way right right is the truth hallelujah Paul said it in Romans he said for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing to will is present with me y'all know what I'm talking about but how to perform that which is good I find not the other day I was so tired and I was going to fix me some tea I think it was and my wife was sitting in the chair she said honey would you fix me a cup of tea too I did one of these numbers thank you I said so I said honey I'm so tired but I'll fix you a cough my flesh you're fainted on me she said don't worry about it honey she said I feel that way sometimes too but you see the flesh will faint I did not mean to give that response but it took just that moment [Laughter] oh Lord I was so glad she understood there was no no misunderstanding but she understood for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now come on somebody why do you know God will let you see things because she could have asked that question way before then but God allowed me to be really tired I'm thinking how tired I was but you see you don't know what's in you until that part is punched yeah there it is Boom but but you know you we have that space to repent that's the thing you don't leave it that way right you repentance and and then do it redeem that time right you didn't feel like it and you probably don't feel like it still yet but do it that's what I do now if I do that which I would not let me hurry up it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me describe what me was he said in my flesh I find in a law that when I would do good evil is present with me have you ever tried witnessing to somebody and the whole time the devil is trying to make your thoughts become carnal somebody know what I'm talking about for I Delight in the law of God I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bring me into captivity of the law of sin which is in my members that Paul is is explaining something to us but Paul is free he understand what it is but he also understand he's covered by the blood or ratchet man that I am and you heard me preach this before who shall deliver me from the body of this death because that's exactly what it is I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I might myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin Hallelujah see so he's saying listen I'm going to make mistakes but it's the Inner Man it's this guy because this going to be redeemed it's not redeemed yet but one day we'll put on a new body Hallelujah see it is it is almost impossible because the sharing uh to do what God requires us to do without his blood or his power of his blood right like I said I'm only I'm just doing this because I want you to understand I'm still working with the meaning of Calvary the purpose of Calvary and now I'm working with without spot wrinkle of blemish to show you all human effort must be surrendered you know I told I think I told you guys about this the other day how that when um Jesus when he was in you know in in in the Garden of Gethsemane and he says father not my will die and be done but see we hear that but we fail to see how he labored to get to that point surrender you've got to labor till you kill it it has the dies brother though and rocked and when he said not my will but thine be done at that point he defeated the devil in every test that day and and you know the human will is something else and I I just didn't know how powerful that thing was it's true amen until recently I began to press and then you find out there's something pressing behind pressing you another way but I'm pressing and something pushes you and you're pressing right it's a real wall it's nothing to play with but listen that light in you I told the devil I said you might trick me sometimes but one thing about me I'm not a quitter I'll never give up right I can't give up [Music] and then you know oh turn around turn around to what I I spoke I've spoken to the Lord many times and y'all might think I'm crazy but I'd rather burn in hell till I come to no existence than to ever be exists in existence serving Satan I'm not his I wasn't born in this world to be his y'all hear what I'm saying there's nothing about him I like if it wasn't for this flesh I would be perfect I'm just telling you because we got to understand I'm really beginning to see my freedom because when you don't see your freedom you won't see your joy and you won't see Christ right he said in that day you'll know I'm in the Father the father's in me and I am in you and you know what the Bible said at his right hand in fullness of joy amen so if you're not at his right hand your joy is not full I full Joy I don't know just religion I don't have religion for years Lord please restore my joy how many times you in your early Christian days I don't know how how things are but you smile so much about Jesus till your jaws hurt y'all ever had that experience you're so happy try it you don't have to try it it's a come on you know I mean it's not a put on it's a come on let me have people looking at you like you're crazy let me move on I'm gonna cut it in just a bit Hebrews 9 22. and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without the shedding of blood is no remission huh now bulls and goats that blood could never remit your sin all it could do was cover it you know what I'm saying and for those of us who have have houses and apartments and you've got carpet or whatever you know sometimes are staying to get on it and you can't get it up just right you put a rug over it but it doesn't mean that the stain has disappeared the covering is there that's just religion we don't need religion we need salvation amen right the covering we the only covering we need is the blood of Jesus Christ listen I I read this quote I'm gonna read it again because we need to remember this but let me move up to it the All-Seeing Eye of God sees it all there is no hiding place every sin will be brought to light only the blood of Jesus can free us from the penalty of sin and death Psy is proved that your actions Never Dies that those are my words but here's what brother Weller says he said you know like in television television has picked up the every time we even moved our finger anything it's on record every word we say is on record now see television has proven that now television doesn't manufacture picture it only channels that wave into the television see it doesn't make it that's what there was television when Adam walked on the earth there was television when Moses come to the Red Sea there was television when Elijah was on Mount Carmel see but they just now discovered it see and now everywhere every move we make every sound it playing a record that will meet us at the Judgment every move we make has got to meet us there I've got to answer for the words that I say to you as a minister I've got to do it because God will hold me responsible for it to it you understand me is that right and that's for everybody that's not just for a preacher everybody you know even even it's so amazing in in the book of uh Genesis you know God Adam Adam where are thou now now come on you know God knew he was he wanted Adam's response God knew where Adam was there was no Hiding Place not there not now God before Adam he and God knew where he's hiding but he needed to know Adam excuse me Adam needed to know by his own confession why he was hiding and Adam says Lord we're hiding because we're naked see that's what he needed to know he's experienced something he's never experienced before but even Adam calls it by name we're naked he never knew nothing about it how do you know about this nakedness he said because the serpent see what I'm saying so that's you and I must understand that that when when we're naked we know it now I'll put it this way this generation does it does it laodicea was naked and didn't know it but when we make mistakes we know when the clothing has been taken away Hallelujah Revelation 9 6 through 10 says and I heard it was the voice of a great multitude as the voice of many Waters I love that because it's one voice one voice right and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent rain let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready thank you come on somebody you got to put your name in that where it says wife that word was prophesying about me so it ain't if I'm going to make it it's not if I will be ready the Bible said I made myself ready amen oh Lord maybe I'm the only one that's just really enjoying this but I'll tell you what Hallelujah glory to God for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and that's what the prophet of God said you've got to do something he don't sit here and says Lord put on my clothes no there's some things you must do it all works together is that right Hallelujah I mean come on David could have went up to the Goliath with no stone but a revelation came to him something he knew he was Victorious and something inspired him to pick up five Stones I'm gonna get this guy and if his other brothers come they go into see he was ready right I mean I tell people I said David could have done the cartwheel he could have turned back was he gonna whatever and once he loose that stone it was out of his control God is always in control and God will always know make you hit your target hello especially when you are inspired to do it amen y'all love the Lord see God fights your battles and that's the problem we must learn God fights our battles we're always getting in the way hello huh you know I you know what I'm gonna tell you this is it you can't give up to God and then go pick it back up whatever you surrender leave it there well how you know I you didn't I'm not I didn't leave there because any time you say I've left it and you worry about it you still got it because once you leave something at the altar you don't worry matter of fact it almost seems unfair that you can do that but that's what he said he has what he wants us to do the Bible said cast all your cares upon him because he cares for you Hallelujah now I know one thing I can't change myself but I know the man who can so I go to him I said well God it ain't gone yet yes I'm I'm here and I'm not going to move until this thing is moving till it's gone until there's nothing left you say how is that possible because I know what he did with me when it came to drinking and God took all of that from me all of it and I can drink right now without wanting more like I'm out of control I take real communion real wine so you can't tell me God can't deliver alcoholism I never was a drug addict but I know what I used to do when it came to alcohol my dad was one my sister was one my cousin was one you name it it was a family affair Hallelujah but God rich in Mercy that's what I said to the Lord the other day it says Lord I need some mercy today he said go listen to God rich and mercy I say I sure will see when you talk to him he speaks back let me tell you something I just don't go randomly free speaking you know picking up Tates or listening to a message I see God lord what do you want me to hear today he directs me and you know what what I need is right on it sometimes it's like in the first paragraph excuse me that's mean the grapes are getting good but let me hurry up Hallelujah let us be glad and rejoice and get honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be a raid in fine linen and clean and white for the fine lending is the righteousness of the Saints and he said unto him right blessed are they that are called into the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are true sayings of God I fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou doeth did not I am thy servant and thy Brethren let's turn the corners people Oklahoma that's what we did we failed at brother random's feet and of that Brethren that that have testified of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy John typed the prophet John was the prophet John also was the bride but the man the angel that spoke there's only one angel that was ordained to be in place on Earth when the seals will be opened only one and you know the message was so and still is beyond anything we could have comprehended no man could have done this I don't care how big his office or small this office was how many books he could have read there's no way a man could have come up with this kind of language that so fit into the word like a hand and a glove no man could have done that right and so I understand worship how easy it was for people to worship Him and most of them is because they didn't read your their Bibles the Bible keeps you in a balance right now when it comes to God um of doing something great when the change has been completed and and listen the change is not completed yet in the mind of God yes but in time no and the changes are being completed you and I are now moving into that complete and that final stage as I said it earlier and I'ma stop here I pray that brother this is the way I'm paraphrased the brother brother Brian said the foolish virgins thought that they were under the blood you can find it they thought they were under the blood and I could really see it because so many of them out there shouting and speaking in tongue and say they're under the blood they got the Holy Ghost and it's not so I'm not saying they all don't have it but what I'm saying is there are many who've been deceived because the Nature has not been changed when the Holy Ghost comes it changes your nature is that right oh yeah the Bible said it it it literally uh uh give cleanses your consciousness it takes away your desire to sin and and and then changes your affection to things that are above now in my closing when we see the big group in Revelation 7. and nine we come to understand that's the foolish version because they came out of Great Tribulation but look how it spoken to them because right right after the 144 000 you know how the language is in the Bible in the ninth verse it says of the seventh chapter after this I beheld and lower a great multitude which no man could number of all Nations and kindreds and people in tongues stood Before the Throne and before the lamb clothed with white rose and Palms in their hands and Palms is a it spiritually means the victory of the spirit over the flesh right but the Bride of Jesus she's an overcomer now the foolish virgins goes through the tribulation to be purged right the Bride of Jesus Christ is being purged now she's being clear and she's literally you know transforming right now by the by the word by the washing of the water of the words and and you know I know by God's grace the scripture says for whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and the foolish versions did not overcome the world this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith now how can you have faith if you don't have the reveal word for your day Luther Wesley Pentecostals when the light of God was upon him that they had faith in that and everybody that had that it worked for them and God moves on now in order to have the faith of a Rapture is that right rapturing Faith you need a message that's going to give it to you and you gotta believe that message right the word of God it can't be just if that be the case now I don't know how God deals with everybody but I do say it like this it's not in my business it really isn't you know just like you know I think it was uh uh the servant of Elijah says Lord you know we all by ourselves you know no no there's seven thousand I think Elijah felt that way have it y'all know the scripture seven thousand that have not yet bowed down to Baal it wasn't his business God knew exactly who had out there that's what I'm saying you know whenever you get to a place you say well if you don't believe it exactly like this you're dead I'm closing you just messed up that's what happened to a lot of people in the message God would give them a revelation and I'm not saying the Revelation wasn't true but instead of incorporating your brothers you put them out you made your own little click your own little system and no sister now doing what dying their faith most of the systems in cancer this message has faded out and died why because they did the same thing that the Pentecostals and all the other ages did thank God for William Branham you know why I said like that he kept his arms open he never de-christianized anybody he kept his arms open because none of us know who true seed is only God knows we can look at the woman that came to you know uh Simon's house well wait wait wait wait a minute now she coming over here She's Not Our Kind hey but listen she was so much his car Jesus is kind he rebuked Simon and everybody else in the place see yeah yeah it's kind of don't tell me the devil can't bring you to Jesus yeah the devil can bring you to Jesus those Pharisees and everything brought that woman called an adultery to Jesus no doubt they were the same ones they were crying crucify him because he had exposed them they hated him and if you're a real Christian people gonna hate you they don't you don't even have to talk to them you can walk by them and they can tell that you know they got discernment they call it reading you I don't know what it is but I know one thing people know a real one I'm closing I'm not finished we're still going to be working with uh uh Church Without spot wrinkle of blemish because I just kind of hit some uh highlights but I wanna I wanna um maybe pull a few things I don't know how to how to teach uh the people when you know they're lacking the Holy Ghost you understand they're not they're not going to understand what you're saying you're trying to get it to him and you're hoping that somehow the Holy Ghost is going to come in and an anoint them anoint them you know maybe in service and and I you know I really don't I really when I say these things I want the church to hear me if God has put me here as the pastor I want them to hear me because this is what I see how can you say you got the Holy Ghost and you love God and don't show up no something's wrong with that picture am I judging you know the word because the Bible said when you see that day approaching come together in the morning that's right and brother Randall said a true Christians can't hardly wait to the doors of the house of God is open they're there now we all have circumstances that prevent us I'm not talking about that I'm talking about people who just went to b-bops laying at the house they're looking at TV drinking their pop and all that kind of crazy stuff they might even be looking at us online like they're at a theater or something listen that's a respect disrespectful too if you go look at Church online you need to dress up like you at church or put yourself in a position like that's what you go to you reverence and respect that you don't bring your piece of party to the church people will do it and they don't get nothing either you can't disrespect God like that even on TV whatever y'all want to call it YouTube they do they it reverence and uh let's stand yeah y'all know what I'm saying hey you know my my thing is that you know if we're going to make a Rapture listen I you know how can I say it I want to expect I am expecting the fire of God to strike this assembly not just this one you know the one in Iowa City as well uh and I see you know God doing things in both assemblies don't get me wrong I'm uh you know you you many times I'll go after the 90 I leave the 99 and go after the one and I know we I've seen a great change of people in this church as well and and I'm not overlooking them but I'm leaving the 99 and going after that one because we need we need if we don't love each other and care for each other where is the Divine love at right where is it it has to be you can't make heaven without it you know and I don't mind being corrected if I've done something wrong you you obligated to tell me because I'm not going to be willfully sinning before you or doing something wrong or mistreating somebody if I'm doing it I'm doing it ignorantly and I'm the kind of man that will always make it right [Music] because not because I feel people I Fear God foreign [Music] I have a little exam in the morning at the hospital at 7 30 a stress test you know they got to put that stuff in me and I hate that yeah I gotta run on the treadmill and all that kind of crazy stuff they found a little irregularity in my heart it's like okay devil you hit me here you hit me there and you know some people don't understand me how happy I could be what you talking about I'm in a win-win situation he ain't no using fear in what he can do because I know the man who's greater the Bible said great as he does in us than he that is in the world and you know I I just know everything is going to be all right that's all I can tell you yeah I I there's no fear I'm telling you and no reason why I'm telling you all today is just that I felt led inspired to tell you I don't want to keep no secrets uh but you got to understand this house that I'm living in [Music] right but that's okay God still is in control amen amen amen song Lead the song only anybody desire prayer
