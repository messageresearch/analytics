[41:33] the Father of whom are all things and we

[42:40] Lord how all in all that's all we want
[42:43] o God that you may be well pleased in
[42:46] our lives help us now as we press toward
[42:50] the mark of a high calling in Christ
[42:51] Jesus let your glory be known in this
[42:56] place in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[42:58] amen
[42:59] you may be seated as we said we've
[43:04] started
[43:05] on a message and we've been talking
[43:07] about the union or the Uniting united or
[43:10] union with god in its creation
[43:13] and if you if you can recall that in the
[43:15] book of Genesis everything was on one
[43:18] Accord the birds all the animals
[43:23] everything was on one Accord because God
[43:25] was in full control and then God said
[43:28] unto Adam that he had the duty of so
[43:31] doing anything that got out of control
[43:34] right and so Adam was the god of God's
[43:39] creation he was a God of the earth and
[43:41] God was the God of heaven it is amazing
[43:44] though that through this redemption God
[43:47] makes us God of heaven and earth because
[43:50] we are joint heirs with Christ amen so
[43:53] whatever Christ
[43:54] oh we own and it's so difficult
[43:57] sometimes to even conceive in our minds
[44:00] our God could take like I said this
[44:02] morning a little maggot or a little worm
[44:04] and-and-and-and-and and then began to
[44:06] glorify it I mean you take the cow
[44:09] uphill away man the caterpillar a man
[44:11] who's a worm you know I got a big
[44:12] brother right now he will goes to 400
[44:14] pound and you take a caterpillar I mean
[44:17] he screams like a girl he can't stand up
[44:20] to those y'all know what I'm trying to
[44:21] say those little worms that turns into
[44:23] butterflies amen but you know it's just
[44:25] one of those fears that he has amen and
[44:29] you know every every you find out that
[44:32] everybody in their little natural got
[44:34] this thing because I'll be honest with
[44:36] you I hate snakes
[44:37] I don't care if they little snake baby
[44:39] snakes green snakes cute snakes if there
[44:42] are any but I hate snakes
[44:44] and you know I remember almost like I
[44:47] almost got hit by a car one time running
[44:49] in the streets from a snake amen but God
[44:54] was even with me then hallelujah you
[44:57] think about those things and you know
[44:59] what Satan does he try to come to you in
[45:01] a way when he can find a weak area in
[45:04] your life and he tries to come and bring
[45:07] a scare tactic by by using those things
[45:10] but I want to say by God's grace the
[45:12] power of God that God has invested in us
[45:14] now he's literally trying to get all
[45:18] all of that out of us every little ounce
[45:23] every little fear every little law how
[45:27] would you call it Tom thought and desire
[45:31] that hinder us complexes and everything
[45:34] God wants to get rid of it
[45:36] amen because you got to realize God have
[45:39] have no none no complexes God is God and
[45:46] so we want God to take out everything
[45:49] that the world put in us hallelujah we
[45:54] want to be the very reflexion brother
[45:56] branham you describe use I don't want to
[45:57] be the Hall of God I want to be that
[46:00] shell of God nothing left of me a man
[46:03] just God a man hi by God's grace by His
[46:07] grace like I said I can't transform
[46:09] myself you can't transform yourself the
[46:12] Bible says a man that there it that none
[46:15] of us could add one cubit to our statue
[46:17] but we know a man who could who can add
[46:19] to the statue we know the man who can
[46:22] build a statue and therefore that's what
[46:25] we want
[46:25] amen think about it now and you know or
[46:30] what are the brothers brother Keith
[46:31] exactly gave me a taper brother Diggs
[46:34] and I was able to listen to it just a
[46:35] little bit but you know what I did hear
[46:38] I was really blessed and you know he was
[46:40] talking about the name of Jesus the name
[46:43] of God and you know I realized by God's
[46:46] grace that there is no other name there
[46:49] is no other name amen everything God was
[46:53] in this earth under earth he put that
[46:57] net that power and that authority
[46:58] in the name of Jesus Christ now and you
[47:02] say well brother why you said it because
[47:04] the Bible said the whole heaven and
[47:05] earth is named after him hallelujah
[47:09] Amen that we carry his name and what
[47:12] that is is because we have had a union
[47:15] even there has been a marriage ceremony
[47:18] that's what progress has been said we're
[47:20] not just engaged but we are married
[47:23] because God were not impregnated someone
[47:26] he's engaged to there must be a marriage
[47:30] long me and we had therefore impregnated
[47:33] with the Word of God
[47:35] hallelujah coming from amen the message
[47:39] look I like that because the property
[47:40] God said whenever as somebody says look
[47:42] to you they're getting your attention
[47:43] they're trying to get your attention
[47:45] somebody said look and you turn right
[47:47] they want you to see something that if
[47:50] you don't turn to see a look you
[47:52] wouldn't see it amen but here's what he
[47:55] says we must focus our lives not what
[47:59] somebody else says but focus our lives
[48:02] to him and he is the word if we get out
[48:06] our lives line with the word if we get
[48:10] our lives line with the word then the
[48:12] word and our life become the same think
[48:16] about it now he said if you abide in me
[48:18] and my word abiding you then ask what
[48:22] you will I'll be granted to you it'll be
[48:25] granted to you verily I say unto you if
[48:28] you say to this mountain be moved and
[48:31] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[48:34] that that what you have said will come
[48:37] to pass you can have what you have said
[48:41] hallelujah has he proven it remember
[48:45] that when brother Branham was caught in
[48:46] the mountains amen and that bad storm
[48:49] was coming and he told all the other
[48:50] hunters going down the mountain and he
[48:52] was one of the last in the snow began to
[48:54] fall in so much he couldn't even see in
[48:57] front of him and God said to him speak
[49:01] to it he thought maybe he was hearing
[49:03] voices and gods told him to speak to the
[49:07] storm and he spoke to the storm and he
[49:09] told us strong exactly what to do and
[49:12] the storm obeyed him what was it it
[49:15] wasn't just for William Branham even he
[49:17] was an example hallelujah of what this
[49:20] last creation is to be and so God a man
[49:24] is moving and then in the ride to bring
[49:27] a union to her so that she could be so
[49:29] in love with him that she would follow
[49:31] every word she would unite she would
[49:34] become that prison and as I said she
[49:37] wouldn't she would be so constrained to
[49:39] the Word of God that even Satan with no
[49:42] won't know
[49:42] what to do with her hallelujah she and
[49:45] we get our lives line up with the words
[49:47] in the world and our lives become the
[49:49] same if your body in me my word about in
[49:52] you and asks what you will ah I'll be
[49:55] it'll be granted unto you verily I say
[49:58] to you if you say to this mountain be
[49:59] move and don't doubt in your heart but
[50:02] believe that what you have said will
[50:05] come to pass you can have what half what
[50:08] you have said oh my not what I said what
[50:12] you said you can have what was in that
[50:17] right he said to the probably God how
[50:19] many squirrels do you want not Olivia
[50:22] where do you want him you got to realize
[50:25] that was creation hallelujah and just as
[50:30] he called them out there was so but you
[50:33] know probably God being human just like
[50:35] all of us we say all three is enough he
[50:37] said but you said far you said five
[50:39] however many it was this is how much
[50:41] you're going to get because this is what
[50:43] you first said understand God can't take
[50:46] back his word if you say it five that's
[50:49] exactly how many you're gonna get if he
[50:51] who said fourth that's exactly what
[50:53] you're gonna get
[50:54] right he cannot come sure why because
[50:56] there will be a breaking of the word
[50:57] hallelujah why because there's no longer
[51:00] you it's him in you hey lord I believe
[51:05] that I'm crazy enough to believe it
[51:09] hallelujah
[51:10] he was the word there you are then you
[51:14] and the word I focused and together you
[51:17] become a living unit of God come on now
[51:20] ego right in an arm what's that Christ
[51:25] mystery of God revealed or you can even
[51:28] take our absolutely it doesn't matter
[51:30] but you got to understand that this
[51:32] whole Bible is Jesus Christ this whole
[51:36] entire Bible is Jesus Christ hallelujah
[51:41] and guess what if you are in Jesus
[51:46] Christ you are in here
[51:48] [Laughter]
[51:51] so you got to realize you know it is not
[51:54] his it's not some head knowledge
[51:56] it's something that God has to drop to
[51:58] your heart you say will you be tested
[52:00] yes you're going to be tested hallelujah
[52:03] if the Son of God who never sinned
[52:06] before ever was tested by Satan do you
[52:09] think you're going to escape hallelujah
[52:13] but if he whipped Satan you did too ha
[52:16] because you were Satan when you were in
[52:19] him hallelujah I love this message
[52:24] because it doesn't just find you it
[52:28] defines you
[52:31] hallelujah it tells you where you come
[52:34] from and where you're going it tells you
[52:37] that you just didn't exist you always
[52:41] existed in the mind of God you should
[52:44] all brother I don't understand he didn't
[52:45] say understand it he said believe it
[52:50] hallelujah is that right
[52:52] think about the mysteries I told you
[52:54] today he's everywhere he's in everything
[52:56] he's and everything hallelujah you think
[52:58] about those little lambs amen with no
[53:00] sheep when they have lambs amen and all
[53:03] of a sudden you know they take him
[53:04] somewhere from there their little lambs
[53:06] and and and then one of the one of them
[53:08] get away somehow it doesn't matter if
[53:10] there's a thousand little lambs out
[53:12] there bleeding that mother lamb knows
[53:16] the sound now you and I can't tell no
[53:20] difference we don't know the difference
[53:22] between the bleeding of this one in the
[53:24] bleeding because they all whining and
[53:26] screaming and whatever the more but that
[53:28] little mother know think about it how
[53:30] did they do that you don't think about
[53:32] that little lamb him and when winning
[53:34] when he's first born on a horse or
[53:36] whatever in there and you they don't
[53:38] have no education that they don't even
[53:40] know you know really what they are but
[53:43] they do know that that's mama because as
[53:46] soon as they're born they go right there
[53:48] and hit that you know amen
[53:52] producing that meal for them how do they
[53:55] know that now we're the dumb ones we're
[54:00] born dumb hallelujah because you know we
[54:04] don't as babies we're so our minds we
[54:07] don't know we don't know how to wear the
[54:08] car
[54:09] mama-mama got to come pick us up
[54:11] helpless
[54:13] not only we we were in that shape if
[54:16] mama don't come toward us but those
[54:18] little horses don't serve them in just a
[54:20] matter of minutes and hours however long
[54:22] it is their stand upon their feet in the
[54:23] air go fine mama to nurse who told them
[54:28] see that's God people has god that's God
[54:32] that's God I look at nature like I can't
[54:34] help but I'm I'm coming to us in just a
[54:36] minute
[54:36] we tell mother nature the Sun somebody
[54:39] said out they read they well the
[54:41] scientists have said that the North Star
[54:45] has moved so many centimeters out of
[54:48] place I said scientists need to get it
[54:50] right they got it wrong the North Star
[54:53] doesn't move out of place yeah the earth
[55:00] may move out of place but the North Star
[55:03] will not because that note North Star
[55:06] represents Christ Alleluia amen
[55:10] and you show all what do you mean
[55:11] brother birds what I'm trying to say is
[55:13] yes I don't deny that something is
[55:15] happening in the solar system that
[55:17] seemed to get everything all whacked up
[55:18] but I'm gonna tell you something to stop
[55:20] North Star has been there and will be
[55:23] there until God says so otherwise right
[55:27] oh that's like saying where the Sun has
[55:30] gotten out of place if the Sun would get
[55:32] just move one way or the other
[55:34] we'd be messed up right so you got to
[55:38] understand it is a scientific fact that
[55:40] the Sun has been rotating and spinning
[55:42] around in this circus circuit it meant
[55:44] forever and guess what it doesn't do
[55:48] this it steadfast on course hallelujah
[55:55] oh come on somebody the Sun don't never
[55:58] stand stealing back up I can't all I
[56:02] know is the first time it ever stood
[56:03] still Amen when Joshua said son stand
[56:06] still but what made him go what made the
[56:11] Sun color stop back on his course
[56:13] hallelujah now I'm saying all of these
[56:16] things because there are laws and there
[56:18] are rules and there are regulations that
[56:20] God has
[56:21] he's allowed these things to control his
[56:25] creation whether you know it or not when
[56:29] you were born God has already determined
[56:31] how many breaths are you going to take I
[56:34] don't care what kind of breathing
[56:36] machine me got hallelujah when God says
[56:39] it's done it is done hallelujah you can
[56:43] be in perfect health and God said at the
[56:44] age of 38 men 16 days after his birthday
[56:48] he's going to stop breathing
[56:49] hallelujah guess what they can get all
[56:52] the kind of pumping machines they won't
[56:54] - and it'll never start again because
[56:56] God has already determined y'all see
[56:58] what I'm saying what what make one man

[57:31] basically you came from the same tree
[57:33] but God said I don't want this one here
[57:36] I want that one
[57:38] he would bypass uh uh uh how you say
[57:42] generations just for you but is it
[57:47] why can you see things and nobody else

[57:53] this message that not other people can't
[57:55] see it they don't even want it but you

[58:02] spite of all your failures in spite of
[58:04] all your start coming card got his hands

[1:01:59] wall and you got a charge to make who do
[1:02:01] I love more God or the world hallelujah

[1:02:14] God is gonna override the world every
[1:02:18] time
[1:02:19] what about Moses hey I tell you what I
[1:02:23] look at Moses and he gotta are millions
[1:02:26] of people in his church and everybody
[1:02:28] around here tell me who I got a big mega
[1:02:29] church let me tell you well you got
[1:02:31] nothing on Moses ha ha hallelujah he had
[1:02:34] a mega church he had all kinds of
[1:02:36] musicians he had dancers in the spirit
[1:02:38] hallelujah he had it all
[1:02:40] oh boy but Joseph Moses had a lot of
[1:02:43] problems a lot of problem idolaters and
[1:02:47] all kinds of stuff amen many
[1:02:49] people didn't make it over because they
[1:02:51] wouldn't listen to me you hear what I'm
[1:02:53] saying
[1:02:53] but Moses was Elias he wanted to do that
[1:02:56] work he wanted to see you know in the
[1:02:58] hand of God move all the time but then
[1:03:00] one day Moses relaxed a little bit he
[1:03:03] let the enemy get to his nerves
[1:03:05] hallelujah
[1:03:06] man see the devil got honest ever you
[1:03:08] know ever since you come out of Egypt on
[1:03:10] people they just been complaining and
[1:03:13] you know look at them you know they
[1:03:15] don't even appreciate God and every time
[1:03:17] you try to tell them something they got
[1:03:18] they got something to say you know a man
[1:03:21] no matter how God leads them they're not
[1:03:22] satisfied and they don't say ain't
[1:03:24] number rebels Moses a year that's all
[1:03:27] they are and when he got up amen to
[1:03:33] speak to the rock Moses he was putting
[1:03:39] his anger into the rock see that's what
[1:03:42] I tried to tell people folks you can't
[1:03:44] get angry with God you don't get angry
[1:03:46] with God a man and he got angry and all
[1:03:50] of a sudden he popping him he didn't
[1:03:52] realize now he's letting off the
[1:03:53] pressure but he's letting them off in
[1:03:55] the wrong way
[1:03:56] you let the pressure off by staying with
[1:03:58] the word hallelujah not going against it
[1:04:01] but by standing with it man and brother
[1:04:04] man who said that Moses glorified
[1:04:07] himself
[1:04:10] you think Moses did say like you rebels
[1:04:19] no sir there was anger there and we may
[1:04:23] hit that rock amen
[1:04:25] if he had only knew understood that that
[1:04:27] rock was a symbol of Jesus Christ he
[1:04:29] never would have done it though I think
[1:04:30] he really did it but Barney the point is
[1:04:33] God told him to speak to their not not
[1:04:35] striking y'all hear what I'm saying why
[1:04:38] am I saying all of this yet is still no
[1:04:42] I was God alert how they do it yet is
[1:04:46] still Joseph was God on earth
[1:04:49] I'll couple somebody you got to realize
[1:04:52] when God is in you that's God I'm going
[1:04:55] to talk about the flesh of the man I'm
[1:04:56] talking about the vessel of the man had
[1:04:58] the Almighty God on the inside of them
[1:05:01] hallelujah more
[1:05:03] this was God see he's so simple what did
[1:05:08] God do when he wanted to have fellowship
[1:05:11] with his creation what did he do see he
[1:05:14] could have left Adam in the spirit
[1:05:15] because remember Adam was first created
[1:05:17] spiritually he could have left Adam in
[1:05:19] the spirit but Adam God wanted to show
[1:05:22] what his purpose was in Adam he wanted
[1:05:25] to feel he wanted to touch he wanted to
[1:05:26] behave there to communicate amen in such
[1:05:29] a lower level a man with his animals so
[1:05:31] he put Adam in the dust right so Jesus
[1:05:35] himself had to do the same thing see God
[1:05:38] knew he knew but you know the point is
[1:05:40] he wanted to be able to be touched by
[1:05:43] the feelings of you Infirmary he was
[1:05:45] always righteous he was always just he
[1:05:49] always had just he always had mercy
[1:05:51] always had grace but he want to be able
[1:05:53] to feel it right you wanted to be able
[1:05:58] to feel it so he steps into this flesh
[1:06:00] amen to be able to feel and to
[1:06:02] communicate and understand Amen what you
[1:06:05] going through
[1:06:05] hallelujah through experience huh is
[1:06:10] that right because that's what God told
[1:06:12] Moses Moses you will become God unto
[1:06:15] pharaoh and pharaoh was the greatest of
[1:06:19] all gods of Egypt I don't care what kind
[1:06:22] of statues they had Pharaoh was above
[1:06:24] that and God took off a runaway slave a
[1:06:28] runaway fugitive how you want to say and
[1:06:30] then made that fugitive God over the
[1:06:32] greatest thing in huh come on I'm trying
[1:06:35] to get us to a place here because I
[1:06:37] think a lot of time we don't realize who
[1:06:39] we are we think like man
[1:06:41] oh my who me oh not another day oh we
[1:06:50] see that's what the devil wants you to
[1:06:51] feel he wants you to feel like a man
[1:06:53] because if you feel like a man you're
[1:06:55] gonna act like a man but if you feel
[1:06:57] like a king you act like a king if you
[1:06:59] feel like a god you act like a god now
[1:07:02] you are not the God but you're children
[1:07:04] of God
[1:07:06] see but you can't be afraid to say I'm a
[1:07:09] god cuz he said you are and that would
[1:07:12] get you in trouble that's gonna get you
[1:07:14] in trouble yeah but the truth is the
[1:07:16] truth it was so it was so it was so
[1:07:23] powerful to do in Paul's time you know
[1:07:25] Paul did they even worship Paul didn't
[1:07:27] you know that right the same as they did
[1:07:30] in this day with brother Branham they
[1:07:31] did it in Paul's day and Paul said you
[1:07:33] know some of y'all even received me as
[1:07:35] Jesus Christ himself yes in the
[1:07:38] scripture but Paul said listen I didn't
[1:07:40] die for you neither did I baptized in
[1:07:43] any of them in my name hallelujah I
[1:07:47] didn't baptize no one because I knew the
[1:07:50] spirit that was on you hallelujah
[1:07:53] so you should all brothers what are you
[1:07:56] trying to say you say we get to a place
[1:07:58] and like I said this morning with this
[1:08:00] message don't let it can't become comedy
[1:08:02] you bless our sister Brenda Lewis she's
[1:08:03] gone but she said I'll come unto you
[1:08:08] come unto you
[1:08:11] don't you let this gospel become common
[1:08:17] to you I miss my sister hallelujah
[1:08:21] I just think about it Amen because what
[1:08:23] happens Amen we allow this gospel to
[1:08:25] become common it's not coming common

[1:08:31] you just got to get on your rocket
[1:08:33] hallelujah you got to get on your rocket
[1:08:35] and let it explode hallelujah that's
[1:08:38] what this message is like that's what
[1:08:40] it's supposed to be and that's I just
[1:08:43] can't hardly help it you know I look at
[1:08:45] myself and I look at the people and then
[1:08:46] I look at how we sometimes it just is
[1:08:49] everywhere don't think I'm picking on
[1:08:50] you I'm saying everywhere you go this
[1:08:52] thing had become common sinners began to
[1:08:54] get back in the church people beginning
[1:08:57] to do things that they know it's wrong
[1:08:58] and they shouldn't be doing and then and
[1:09:00] they still calling himself bride don't
[1:09:02] worry
[1:09:02] God said we're gonna have a revival
[1:09:05] there's gonna be a last outpouring to
[1:09:08] this bride that's gonna bring her to
[1:09:10] rapturing faith y'all hear what I'm
[1:09:12] saying and I don't know about you I can
[1:09:14] use a refueling I want a refill me

[1:09:19] oh man God will not let this church on
[1:09:22] this bride fail so you cannot fail

[1:12:23] accordian shows enough in the end before
[1:12:25] I'm done people like that before myself
[1:12:27] people you could tell they elated with
[1:12:30] the revelation that God has just given
[1:12:31] them and they are so excited and you're
[1:12:33] trying to get there but you don't even
[1:12:35] see it and you know they know you don't
[1:12:36] see it is that where you love the Lord
[1:12:40] oh I love the people of God people that
[1:12:43] you know I look at this thing you said
[1:12:44] well what do you mean if I was perfect I
[1:12:46] wouldn't even have to pray I wouldn't
[1:12:49] have to ask for forgiveness I wouldn't
[1:12:51] have to ask for God to cleanse me mmm
[1:12:53] but one thing I do know that God loves
[1:12:56] you for who you are that's what I love
[1:13:00] about God he loves me for who I am right
[1:13:04] I don't have to worry about funny
[1:13:06] feelings with him hallelujah he loves me
[1:13:09] for who I am
[1:13:10] thoughts at all is that right
[1:13:14] he loved us so much about saying that
[1:13:16] while we were yet soon as he died that's
[1:13:18] what get scriptures like that it just
[1:13:20] like it just got something to me because
[1:13:24] you know and I know we are on this line
[1:13:27] of thought if you do good to me I do
[1:13:29] good to you if you do bad to me I'm
[1:13:31] gonna do bad to you if it wasn't so that
[1:13:34] Jesus would not have said do good to
[1:13:37] those who spitefully use you do good to
[1:13:39] those who hate you
[1:13:40] he knew the way man thinks he knows the
[1:13:43] way man thinks hallelujah and it's all
[1:13:46] because of
[1:13:46] fall but he's trying to get us back on
[1:13:49] that plane hallelujah
[1:13:51] oh man we could stand there and see a
[1:13:54] brother abusers and everything else our
[1:13:56] sister and we can say Father forgive
[1:13:58] them for they know not what they do and
[1:14:01] you can get on your knees and say lord I
[1:14:02] love them cuz you know the devil gonna
[1:14:03] try to put some bitterness in your heart
[1:14:05] so you got to get on your knees and say
[1:14:06] lord I love you got a speaking you
[1:14:09] understand me you win the devil trying
[1:14:11] to create a bit of atmosphere or at
[1:14:14] least feel hatred you got to kind of act
[1:14:16] that thing by the Word of God if you
[1:14:20] don't the devil gonna ride you here
[1:14:23] Roger till you find a place of
[1:14:24] bitterness in your heart and then when
[1:14:26] he finds that he just don't leave he
[1:14:27] anchors he causes other things that
[1:14:31] happen amen let's go and see that's
[1:14:34] that's just how you have to come back
[1:14:35] the devil
[1:14:36] don't let him strike you and then you
[1:14:37] don't strike me oh you got to get him
[1:14:40] back don't get you you know we don't
[1:14:42] wrestle against flesh and blood and
[1:14:44] spiritual wickedness he didn't say we
[1:14:45] can fight them right but he said flesh
[1:14:48] and blood you don't fight them those
[1:14:50] people they're your brothers they're
[1:14:51] your sisters but the thing that caused
[1:14:53] them to do it you can go after them yeah
[1:14:57] lord have mercy
[1:14:59] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:15:01] before the foundation of the world that
[1:15:03] we should be holy and without blame
[1:15:06] before him in law hallelujah and that's
[1:15:11] powerful to me because brother branham
[1:15:13] brings it out he said God every sin you
[1:15:15] ever committed God you see God it's
[1:15:18] gotta be somebody gotta take the blame
[1:15:23] hallelujah go back to James and then
[1:15:26] find out where all the blame went right
[1:15:29] Adam say Lord the woman in the Indian
[1:15:33] and woman said Lord the Serpent and
[1:15:35] that's where it stopped it goes all the
[1:15:39] way back to the serpent and who was
[1:15:41] cursed the serpent she took all go back
[1:15:46] to the devil you mean to tell me
[1:15:47] everything I've ever done brother Brooks
[1:15:49] that's it's been wrong the devil gotta
[1:15:51] pay for us somebody's gotta be born
[1:15:53] cuz God is just and think who's got to
[1:15:56] pay for the devil he knows
[1:16:06] I remember a man we was up there brother
[1:16:10] Paul beard and and they were doing that
[1:16:13] play what's the name of it
[1:16:17] pilgrim progress and this lady who
[1:16:21] supposed to be an atheist she screams
[1:16:23] out how she said it huh no uh yeah I
[1:16:33] don't I don't I don't believe in God and
[1:16:36] God knows it like that she said she
[1:16:44] don't believe in God but God knows it
[1:16:48] matter whether you believe or not he
[1:16:50] exists anyhow and he knows you don't
[1:16:52] believe she was right I thought man that
[1:16:56] was a pretty good script but anyhow we
[1:16:58] look at these things and you said what
[1:16:59] brother was what are you saying this is
[1:17:01] the word and I know we've heard these
[1:17:03] things but somehow he's got to stop he's
[1:17:05] got a brother I'm say this thing got to
[1:17:06] go down from the head to the heart it
[1:17:09] brings a faith that brings a confidence
[1:17:12] it brings something just the other day I
[1:17:15] left my car out the crowd and outside at
[1:17:17] night and and it was raining hard and
[1:17:20] y'all remember all I don't know where
[1:17:21] they hailed in your in your place or not
[1:17:23] but the hill I was just coming down I
[1:17:25] mean it all it woke me up and then I
[1:17:27] thought oh my goodness I left my car
[1:17:29] Lord you know please don't let this hell
[1:17:32] tear my car and I'm just waking up out
[1:17:35] of sleep and putting my shoes on my
[1:17:37] jacket and and and I was gonna go out
[1:17:40] there and rescue my car
[1:17:41] and God said but you asked me to keep it
[1:17:48] and now you're gonna go get it huh you
[1:17:54] asked me to
[1:17:55] the car from being you know hail damage
[1:17:57] and now you're gonna go get it
[1:17:59] what's the use of you asking me just
[1:18:03] save it from hail damage y'all hear what
[1:18:07] I'm sayin see because I asked him that
[1:18:10] mean man I didn't have to go look at it
[1:18:12] I didn't have to check it out I just
[1:18:14] asked him to do it and should have
[1:18:16] believed it was done and it was done but
[1:18:22] when he talked to me like that I say Oh
[1:18:23] Lord you are so right and guess what I
[1:18:30] did study there will you woke me up so
[1:18:33] now I'm gonna study amen
[1:18:35] so we look at this day you know and you
[1:18:38] think oh Lord
[1:18:39] in predestiny you're not free today I'm
[1:18:41] talking about a union because you got to
[1:18:43] understand you came from God and you go
[1:18:45] back to God when Jesus said I came from
[1:18:48] the father I go back to him so you gotta
[1:18:50] understand by God's grace there is this
[1:18:53] thing this little detour we made brother
[1:18:55] and said it was just like a little drop
[1:18:56] a circle in was just a little drop that
[1:18:59] brought us down into this time but then
[1:19:01] then it takes us back up when we die we
[1:19:03] go back up to where we came from right
[1:19:06] it's not it's like a dew drop it comes
[1:19:10] down but it goes back up to where it
[1:19:12] came from and so that's how we are see
[1:19:15] nothing can stop because eternal he is
[1:19:18] like a circle it has no beginning no
[1:19:22] ending it so therefore whatever drops
[1:19:24] down has to go back up to where it came
[1:19:25] from and then it continues see oh this
[1:19:29] thing is so beautiful because you know
[1:19:30] how many years it was I had to think
[1:19:33] about Oh Lord I'm just you know even in
[1:19:35] the Apostolic Church no speaking in
[1:19:37] tongues and running up and down the
[1:19:39] aisle and all that I mean which was
[1:19:40] really good I really enjoyed it
[1:19:42] oh my god I wish would have a summer
[1:19:45] times like that here but my push I love
[1:19:48] the people I love it amen and you know
[1:19:51] my thing is is that but then I realized
[1:19:54] something was going different because
[1:19:56] you know when you stay there a period of
[1:19:58] time they don't have the proper word to
[1:20:00] keep you moving
[1:20:01] they could only bring you to a level of
[1:20:03] something but they can't continue it
[1:20:06] can't go on because they don't have
[1:20:08] that extra word that takes you on into
[1:20:10] eternity they can't tell you where you
[1:20:13] came from and they always get me give
[1:20:15] you hope instead of faith you know I'm
[1:20:17] in baptized in Jesus Christ's name I've
[1:20:19] been
[1:20:19] I got spoke in tongues you know I may be
[1:20:21] gifted but Lord if I don't live right if
[1:20:26] I don't walk right if I don't talk right
[1:20:28] I don't gonna be lost
[1:20:30] yeah that's the way you know in my
[1:20:32] church week to teach amen and I'ma get
[1:20:34] back to it we should teach that babies
[1:20:36] was lost if those babies weren't
[1:20:37] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:20:39] lost come on somebody we didn't
[1:20:43] understand that the blood of Jesus
[1:20:44] Christ covered the babies the blood of
[1:20:47] Jesus Christ covers you too
[1:20:49] it ain't about how good you can walk
[1:20:54] people think well let me go on em to the
[1:20:59] praise and the glory listen
[1:21:01] predestinated us to the adoption of
[1:21:03] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:21:05] according to the goodness good pleasure
[1:21:07] of his will my destiny your destiny is
[1:21:12] his pleasurable will he said what are
[1:21:20] you saying brother Brooks
[1:21:23] God is enjoying this journey with me
[1:21:26] even though I may not enjoy as much as
[1:21:29] he does
[1:21:30] you understand me so you can understand
[1:21:34] when I got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:21:37] went everywhere with me cuz he said I'll
[1:21:40] never leave you nor forsake me when I
[1:21:43] walked in hobby
[1:21:44] God walking hobby how could they dunk
[1:21:49] crazy but it's true Oh amen every time I
[1:21:54] sit in the barber's chair God sitting up
[1:21:58] there watching everything they don't
[1:22:00] even know it's like God then say Amen to
[1:22:04] spy on own on Jericho yeah you got to
[1:22:09] understand his seat like the bronze say
[1:22:11] he sees with your eyes he hears with
[1:22:13] your ears he walk with your feet right
[1:22:15] he is in you well that's what about your
[1:22:20] lights
[1:22:21] ye are the light of the world garden
[1:22:26] posters all through Satan's eating
[1:22:29] Nutella so dumb he doesn't even see
[1:22:32] what's happening hallelujah
[1:22:34] he might be able to report to God but
[1:22:36] you see God reports to himself he sees
[1:22:40] God Himself is our witness Oh
[1:22:43] somebody help me here see when we look
[1:22:46] and we said oh and I use a David David
[1:22:49] you know David a little lad to go strong
[1:22:51] you know and he killed Goliath and
[1:22:54] everything else and I'm thinking to
[1:22:55] myself what boy I know what man I know
[1:22:59] hallelujah that would take on a giant
[1:23:01] get him out of here not in your own
[1:23:04] strength
[1:23:05] hallelujah but what it was it was God
[1:23:09] and God Lord Himself to a boy say see
[1:23:13] Satan I can whip you by way of a boy and
[1:23:18] one stone I'm gonna take the very thing
[1:23:22] that you possess your sword and I'm
[1:23:26] gonna tell you I'm gonna take your sword
[1:23:27] and I'm gonna cut your head off
[1:23:30] right see God said but don't don't did
[1:23:35] you dig a ditch but the point is if the
[1:23:38] ditch you dig you might fall into
[1:23:40] yourself and that's exactly what Satan
[1:23:42] does he dig ditches for us to fall into
[1:23:46] but he's the one that falls into the
[1:23:48] ditch is that right
[1:23:51] oh come on it's the truth the Bible says
[1:23:53] the hell uh-uh what the scripture says
[1:23:57] that I'm a hell was created for sickness
[1:24:00] in his angels right but see Satan
[1:24:03] thought that was being perhaps created
[1:24:06] for him you know in the sons of God but
[1:24:10] we go there but guess what in reality
[1:24:13] we're not what do you mean what I'm
[1:24:18] trying to say is the only thing they can
[1:24:20] go to hell is those who came from hell
[1:24:26] every one of God's children no matter
[1:24:29] how feeble they are they return back to
[1:24:32] God
[1:24:33] well you know why just like Moses said
[1:24:36] I'm not leaving one behind not even one
[1:24:39] who me hi you said what do you mean
[1:24:42] Brotherhood's what about those people
[1:24:43] they're not in this message if they know
[1:24:45] Jesus now I'm putting you to the test
[1:24:49] because did you know Jesus before you
[1:24:52] came to this message yeah I clike y'all
[1:24:55] afraid let me say like this so you could
[1:24:58] better understand it brother Brandon was
[1:24:59] in the Baptist Church and knew Jesus he
[1:25:04] didn't even know he was a messenger at
[1:25:05] the time so do did he get saved when the
[1:25:09] message came or was he saved before the
[1:25:11] message came scripta Lee Lee
[1:25:16] I'll tell you I was saved well how do
[1:25:19] you know brother Bruce because my
[1:25:21] salvation was given to me before the
[1:25:23] foundation that's what piece of work
[1:25:28] you don't belong it is you lost so you
[1:25:30] be careful because that's what you're
[1:25:31] sad Jesse says that's what the Pharisee
[1:25:34] says when brother Branham says certain
[1:25:36] things brother Branham knew exactly what
[1:25:38] he was saying the only thing you can say
[1:25:40] how you can say what he say is that you
[1:25:42] have a revelation of what he was saying
[1:25:44] when he said what he said
[1:25:49] is that okay hey I'm gonna try I'm
[1:25:52] almost done really I'm not ground
[1:25:54] because of communion
[1:25:56] oh I'm enjoying myself I'm enjoying this
[1:26:00] word why because the battles I have all
[1:26:04] kind of battles happening in my life
[1:26:06] everywhere a battle battle battle
[1:26:08] sometimes I'll just have to hold my head
[1:26:12] these people supposed to be Christians
[1:26:14] that's all I can say up there and then I
[1:26:16] have to repent because I mess up to some
[1:26:19] but you know you look at people and say
[1:26:21] we supposed to be further up the road
[1:26:22] folks and you know then then like I said
[1:26:25] I talked about being late then this
[1:26:27] morning I was a little late too I like
[1:26:29] to be a half-hour here early and when
[1:26:31] I'm 15 minutes late that means 15
[1:26:35] minutes before the service start singing
[1:26:37] I don't like that I like like the
[1:26:39] Prophet said a half hour early
[1:26:41] I like the idea I could come in here and
[1:26:43] settle down and pray however I choose to
[1:26:45] whether it's in a chair or on my knee
[1:26:47] amen so anyway things do happen people
[1:26:51] have problems situations comes up all
[1:26:54] those kind of things so I was not trying
[1:26:56] to be legalistic about it
[1:26:57] but just trying to prompt people to try
[1:27:01] to do better it was uh I came I'm gonna
[1:27:10] read a quote here but I went through the
[1:27:12] chiropractor the other day and they have
[1:27:14] this this scan and they tell you to
[1:27:17] stand up straight and um and and and try
[1:27:20] to stand as straight as you can you know
[1:27:23] your posture and everything so they
[1:27:25] scanned everything and when my we might
[1:27:31] when my posture and everything came back
[1:27:33] it was it's quite funny you know one of
[1:27:36] my knees is crooked one of my joints is
[1:27:39] kind of out of place and all of that and
[1:27:42] one of my legs shorter than uh seriously
[1:27:46] my wife looked at me like she did say
[1:27:49] this but she looked at me like what you
[1:27:50] laughing for
[1:27:54] I got a new pocket I'm saying to myself
[1:27:57] I got a new body this is not gonna
[1:27:59] stress me out devil
[1:28:01] hallelujah y'all understand me I don't
[1:28:04] know what his response started where he
[1:28:05] was gonna get out of me but even the
[1:28:08] chiropractor lookin at me cuz I'm
[1:28:09] laughing and then I was telling somebody
[1:28:13] said yeah you probably felt like that
[1:28:15] donkey brother branham was talking about
[1:28:16] us he was all messed up but he was
[1:28:19] saying I don't care
[1:28:22] this thing is gonna where the people
[1:28:27] it's gonna fade away hallelujah
[1:28:31] I mean I'm looking at this thing and
[1:28:33] wondering how in the world I've been
[1:28:34] coping but you know what I feel pretty
[1:28:37] good right now I feel like a young man
[1:28:41] and if you any of us get older we gonna
[1:28:44] get things gonna change hallelujah
[1:28:50] I don't understand it but I say Lord
[1:28:52] you've been good to me that's all I know
[1:28:54] and the end of the day at the end of the
[1:28:57] day Lord you've been good to me
[1:28:59] anyway United in him he listen and this
[1:29:02] is what I'm closing on this quote let me
[1:29:05] say something to this u19 time to see
[1:29:10] churches uniting nations uniting it's a
[1:29:13] uniting time of God and his bride - and
[1:29:16] I say this with reverence and respect I
[1:29:18] believe that the Bride of Christ is
[1:29:21] called I believe she is sealed in the
[1:29:24] kingdom of God I believe the mechanics
[1:29:27] is there they're waiting for the
[1:29:29] dynamics that take her off the earth and
[1:29:32] to glory into the rapture I believe it
[1:29:36] with all my heart yes sir we don't know
[1:29:39] how he's going to do it but he shall do
[1:29:42] it he is the dynamics we just become
[1:29:46] members of the machine of his body
[1:29:49] forming ourselves into his image and see
[1:29:52] him uniting himself with us in his works
[1:29:55] with his love gifts as his head and
[1:29:59] hands them to us just before the wedding
[1:30:01] serve our supper and we're waiting and
[1:30:04] watching for that y'all hear what I'm
[1:30:06] saying did you hear what he said just
[1:30:09] prior and then to the message are the
[1:30:12] rapture God will not only bring pouring
[1:30:17] but he's going to read play he's gonna
[1:30:19] place all the gifts now did y'all hear
[1:30:22] that or do you need me to read it again
[1:30:24] so that you can understand that if
[1:30:27] mission because the probably God he
[1:30:29] preached a message and he said now if
[1:30:30] one jewel is missing you will be counted
[1:30:33] as an adulteress Triss is that right all
[1:30:36] the coins must be in the headband so if
[1:30:40] that be true God gonna have to restore
[1:30:42] it all of them you know I know one of
[1:30:46] them one of them brotherly kindness you
[1:30:48] know him people got to restore you know
[1:30:50] people don't even know when when God
[1:30:52] leaves and Holy Spirit comes in
[1:30:53] sometimes they don't even know it you
[1:30:56] know but God has alert me at that times
[1:30:58] I've seen people in church screaming and
[1:31:00] people think I still hold it goes and
[1:31:02] you notice not the Holy Ghost a man
[1:31:04] who's no he's he's got the Holy Ghost he
[1:31:06] see he hears a cry a scream for help
[1:31:11] something is going
[1:31:12] on and this person is crying out for
[1:31:15] help right because the sound that you
[1:31:19] can't explain it it's a supernatural
[1:31:21] thing but it happens it is it really
[1:31:23] happens
[1:31:24] yeah amen they're waiting for the
[1:31:26] dynamics here right right to take that
[1:31:31] further they're waiting for the dynamics
[1:31:34] that will take her off the earth into
[1:31:36] the glory of the rapture right
[1:31:37] he is the dynamics will just become
[1:31:39] members of this machine of his body
[1:31:41] forming ourselves into his image
[1:31:43] seeing him unite himself with us in
[1:31:47] works with his love gifts and she handed
[1:31:52] them to us just before the wedding
[1:31:54] supper and we're waiting watching for
[1:31:59] that sure so it'll be something if
[1:32:04] you're spiritual enough you'll see it
[1:32:06] right there big church there big church
[1:32:10] is to be united the dynamics of this
[1:32:13] church will be with a refilling of the
[1:32:15] Holy Spirit that will have worked in a
[1:32:17] small measure while the headstone is
[1:32:20] coming down to unite with the body but
[1:32:23] when the hair and the body are nice
[1:32:25] together the full power of the Holy
[1:32:28] Ghost will raise her up just exactly
[1:32:31] like that even the day that's dead in
[1:32:36] Christ for hundreds of years will rise
[1:32:39] in the beauty of his holiness and take a
[1:32:42] flight to the sky the dynamics is the
[1:32:45] Holy Spirit chi and that's what people
[1:32:49] are I don't know what they thinkin
[1:32:52] nowadays because now people see that
[1:32:55] that whole egos that they thought they
[1:32:57] had they may have it but they don't have
[1:32:59] it like that
[1:33:01] you know and it's something wrong with
[1:33:03] you review you know if you can't see
[1:33:05] that we need a refilling we need a
[1:33:09] restoring hallelujah
[1:33:11] but God has allowed he tells us he said
[1:33:13] listen for the RAM tells us also that
[1:33:15] there will come a squeeze that's gonna
[1:33:18] come become a persecution of the church
[1:33:19] he said that will pull this little old
[1:33:22] bride together she'll be a small group
[1:33:26] but sure enough she'll come together
[1:33:28] hallelujah and then the dynamics will
[1:33:31] fall ah because we won't worry we won't
[1:33:34] be concerned about your doctrine we
[1:33:36] won't be concerned about this a concern
[1:33:38] about that the firt the thing that we'll
[1:33:40] be concerned about oh my god I found a
[1:33:42] real Christian hallelujah you love the
[1:33:48] Lord see this is you 90 time and you
