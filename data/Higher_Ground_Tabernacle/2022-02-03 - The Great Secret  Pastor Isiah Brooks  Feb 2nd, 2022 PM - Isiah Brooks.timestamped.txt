[10:25] he had tasted the goodness of the lord
[10:28] uh just as we're about to open with the
[10:30] word of prayer we asked to pray for um
[10:34] brother isaac sierra's father was called

[10:44] there's a sister who's um
[10:46] bleeding on the brain

[10:52] that god can heal them so that god can
[10:55] stretch for his hand and touch them

[11:12] bacteria in her stomach

[11:18] that that's no longer the case amen
[11:20] so we should thank god for that

[18:31] standing on the
[18:34] mountaintops of glory

[18:42] when you can hear the songs of angels
[18:47] and the breeze from heaven send your
[18:50] spirit
[18:52] sorry
[18:59] but in the valley once more
[19:03] would jesus still belong
[19:07] that's the question
[19:09] [Music]
[19:19] isn't easy
[19:22] that is the testing
[19:26] [Music]
[19:33] for the time
[19:35] when the sun
[19:37] does not shine
[19:39] and the
[19:40] mountaintop is just a
[19:43] memory
[19:46] when there's no sky
[19:49] to be
[19:50] seen and i don't
[19:53] feel a thing
[19:55] to the word of god
[19:59] [Music]
[20:08] when troubles come my way
[20:12] and i just don't understand
[20:15] what it means
[20:20] when nothing else will do
[20:24] faith alone will see me through
[20:28] and believing
[20:30] becomes my victory
[20:33] [Music]
[20:38] well it's not hard to believe
[20:44] when things are going well and skies
[20:49] are sunny
[20:52] [Music]
[20:54] oh
[20:56] when you feel you're making progress
[21:00] doing good living in a time
[21:04] of plenty
[21:06] [Music]
[21:11] by the thought that should change
[21:16] would you still
[21:17] keep the faith
[21:19] that's the question
[21:24] [Music]
[21:27] cause
[21:28] believing when believing
[21:31] isn't easy
[21:34] that is the testing
[21:38] [Music]
[21:47] when the sun
[21:49] does not shine
[21:51] and the mountain top is just a
[21:55] memory
[21:58] when there's no sky
[22:00] to be seen
[22:03] and i don't
[22:04] feel a thing
[22:07] to the word of god
[22:12] [Music]
[22:18] [Music]
[22:23] and i just don't understand
[22:26] what it means
[22:30] that's when nothing else will do
[22:34] if alone will see me through
[22:38] and believing
[22:40] becomes my victory
[22:47] for the god on the mountain
[22:55] is the god in the valley
[23:02] when things go wrong
[23:05] [Music]
[23:09] you'll make them right

[33:33] we must always praise him

[33:39] and
[33:40] we thank god for those of you who have
[33:42] come out tonight
[33:44] it's a few it's cold out there
[33:47] i thought
[33:48] several times to cancel it but
[33:51] i thought that wouldn't be right
[33:53] i was out to the grocery store today
[33:56] so
[33:56] if i can go to the grocery store i can
[33:58] truly come to church
[34:01] god is good to us
[34:03] and um
[34:07] i don't know what i'd do without him
[34:12] i know that he is the center of my life
[34:15] and i guess he should be the center of
[34:17] everybody's life
[34:18] we had such wonderful services
[34:21] this saturday and sunday
[34:23] i was really blessed with the
[34:26] birthday celebration the gifts and
[34:29] everything that everybody did give us
[34:31] and
[34:32] we thank god for that in jesus name as
[34:35] we stand we'll just go right into the
[34:37] word of god
[34:38] we're going to ask that you turn with us
[34:40] to
[34:41] deuteronomy 29.
[34:48] we're going to
[34:51] read the 29th verse
[34:54] of the 29th chapter
[35:01] it is one of those things i think
[35:03] we should always be aware of when it
[35:05] comes to god
[35:16] please
[35:32] deuteronomy 29 29 thank you brother
[35:36] and it reads
[35:39] the secret things belong unto the lord
[35:41] our god
[35:43] but those things which are revealed
[35:46] belong unto us
[35:48] and to our children forever
[35:51] that we may do all the words
[35:54] of this law
[35:57] second
[35:59] passage of scripture will be from psalms
[36:02] 18 and 11.
[36:14] psalms 18 and 11.
[36:19] he made darkness his secret place
[36:24] his pavilion round about him
[36:28] were dark waters and thick clouds
[36:32] of the skies
[36:34] let us pray
[36:37] heavenly father we thank you for your
[36:39] amazing grace
[36:42] we thank you for being so good to us
[36:45] and lord you have been
[36:47] better to us than we've been to
[36:49] ourselves
[36:51] today you gave us a lovely day
[36:55] we understand that
[36:57] it is cold outside but there are those
[36:59] who
[37:00] weather is far worse than ours
[37:03] and so you said lord in all things give
[37:05] thanks and we want to give thanks
[37:08] father we've had
[37:09] special prayers
[37:13] that went up for different families
[37:17] and father the song about trials and
[37:20] tests it was so
[37:25] sufficient it was needful
[37:28] because all of us need sunshine and all
[37:30] of us need strength
[37:32] in the times of adversities
[37:35] and i pray father god tonight that you
[37:37] would bless
[37:38] those who are in dire need
[37:41] of your touch and your healing touch
[37:45] we ask these things that you would give
[37:47] them to them according to your grace and
[37:50] mercy
[37:51] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[37:54] you may be seated
[38:02] we thank the lord we just uh
[38:04] want to minister a message tonight
[38:08] uh
[38:10] on the secret of god
[38:12] or the god the great secret
[38:15] and as i thought about the great secret
[38:17] i
[38:18] couldn't help but to think that the
[38:20] great secret is god himself
[38:23] because so many people don't know him
[38:27] and the world at large have an image in
[38:29] their minds on who he is and what he is
[38:33] some people have made him some kind of
[38:35] an image of creeping things and crawling
[38:38] things and
[38:39] you name it
[38:41] and the reason why they do that is
[38:43] because they have no respect for the
[38:45] bible
[38:47] the bible in itself is the word of god
[38:50] it is the suppressed image of god in
[38:52] word form
[38:55] and many of the questions that the
[38:56] scientists and the theologians are
[38:59] asking and wondering about if they had
[39:02] only if they would only have confidence
[39:05] in this
[39:07] uh they would then begin to perhaps see
[39:09] a glimpse of who god is
[39:13] science and mathematics and all of these
[39:16] kinds of things that people use to
[39:18] figure out problems
[39:21] will never come to a conclusion or never
[39:23] be able to be solved when it comes to
[39:25] god because you can't figure him out
[39:27] that's right
[39:28] and the only way that you can understand
[39:30] god it has to come by revelation
[39:33] he must reveal himself to you
[39:36] there are things that we know that the
[39:38] lord will not share with us
[39:41] about himself
[39:43] until we reach that place called heaven
[39:47] however he imparts himself
[39:49] there
[39:51] uh will be a great thing and we
[39:53] we all want to get there to see it
[39:57] but here on earth we know him as a
[40:00] savior
[40:01] we know him as a redeemer
[40:04] we know him as a counselor we know him
[40:06] as a protector
[40:08] we know him as a defense
[40:10] even as david said he's a strong tower
[40:13] and amen he goes on to say he's my
[40:16] battle axe
[40:17] so we know he even god even in welfare
[40:20] but
[40:21] many people you know think that what we
[40:24] believe is foolishness
[40:26] only because he's not tangible
[40:29] he's not something you can see or
[40:31] something you can touch with the natural
[40:33] realm
[40:34] because god is spirit that's right
[40:38] we know by god's grace that
[40:40] a secret is something that is not
[40:43] not not seen
[40:45] nor
[40:46] and not known
[40:48] uh and it's something that uh no others
[40:51] will know unless you tell the secret
[40:55] but when we say i've got a secret that
[40:57] means you
[40:58] as an individual holds that
[41:00] secret whether it be a secret uh i would
[41:03] say a treasure
[41:06] place
[41:07] in your heart
[41:10] and god holds many secrets
[41:13] the thing i love about god is that when
[41:15] he calls you
[41:16] he doesn't tell you everything at one
[41:18] time
[41:20] and oftentimes we go through trials and
[41:22] temptations and tribulations only to
[41:25] find out that in the darkness
[41:27] that's where we'll find it
[41:30] the bible tells us amen that even
[41:32] darkness to god is light
[41:35] and even on our dreadful times are at
[41:37] times where things are so hard or seems
[41:40] unbearable
[41:41] he's always there
[41:43] because he said he'll never leave you
[41:45] nor will he forsake you amen and you
[41:47] must understand that god always hides
[41:49] himself in simplicity
[41:52] so therefore if you're looking for god
[41:54] in such a high way you'll never see him
[41:57] they always take a condensation a
[42:00] condescending excuse me of oneself to in
[42:03] order to see him
[42:04] otherwise you won't be able to see him
[42:08] many times we we have have read in the
[42:11] word of god where god was working and
[42:13] doing things and
[42:15] and he uh there were times he was in the
[42:17] wind there were times he was in the
[42:19] whirlwind there were times you know he
[42:21] was in a lot of places and a lot of
[42:23] things and then he comes to place to he
[42:26] says um
[42:27] i'm in that small still voice
[42:31] how often do we fail to know
[42:34] that that's god speaking
[42:37] because a lot of times we often want to
[42:38] hear a thunder
[42:40] or see a lightning flash
[42:43] and you know we we we try him we test
[42:46] him and
[42:47] and that's okay god wants to be known
[42:51] but we find out that in when it comes to
[42:53] salvation
[42:55] god has a perfect plan he has a way of
[42:58] us knowing who he is he's ordained what
[43:01] we call a prophet and according to amos
[43:03] three and seven he says surely the lord
[43:06] will do nothing but he reveals his
[43:08] secrets unto his servant the prophet
[43:11] so we know by god's grace uh that god
[43:14] uses men he always used men
[43:17] uh to unveil himself
[43:19] but many times oftentimes we want to see
[43:22] the great wonders of god
[43:25] you know
[43:26] you know fire or wind or some kind of
[43:29] thing to you know excite our natural
[43:32] being but that's not what god has come
[43:35] to do
[43:36] he comes to redeem us
[43:39] i think the greatest secret of all times
[43:42] is that
[43:43] the purpose for for
[43:45] calvary
[43:47] and the purpose for
[43:48] jesus christ dying i think that's the
[43:51] greatest secret of all time because a
[43:53] lot of times people think that god
[43:56] comes just to save you but understand
[43:59] most people don't even know what they're
[44:01] being saved from
[44:04] and we say okay well i'm saved from sin
[44:07] but what is sin but unbelief
[44:10] and every time we find ourselves in a
[44:13] state of disbelief we find ourselves in
[44:16] a state of sin
[44:18] we think that lying cheating stealing
[44:21] whatever the case may be is sin but
[44:23] those are just attributes of sin it
[44:26] proves that you don't believe
[44:29] what is it there in the word of god that
[44:31] god wants us to believe
[44:33] we didn't know these things and had it
[44:36] not been for profit in our day we would
[44:39] not know them now
[44:42] but we had no idea of our beginning
[44:46] nor did we have any idea of our ending
[44:49] you know that's why science is so
[44:51] confused today
[44:52] uh thinking that we
[44:54] you know i guess they say evolve from
[44:56] monkeys and you know we're evoluting in
[44:59] some type of great something
[45:01] and i look at today and look at what
[45:03] hollywood has become and and the world
[45:06] at large has become and i'm saying if
[45:08] that's evolution
[45:09] may god stop me where i'm at
[45:13] because i don't want to be i don't want
[45:16] to evolve into that kind of perversion
[45:19] that kind of thing wherein that you are
[45:22] so confused you don't know whether you
[45:24] are a man or beast
[45:26] but god has given us a word and he has
[45:29] told us amen and shown us amen some
[45:32] great things that most people don't know
[45:35] just the very fact that we came from god
[45:38] and that we go back to him
[45:40] and when we say that we are sons and
[45:42] daughters of god it makes us more than
[45:45] just mere men
[45:47] we become
[45:48] amateur gods
[45:51] amateur messiahs
[45:53] we become
[45:55] omnipotent as he is
[45:57] because not that we have power of
[46:00] ourselves but because the omnipotent
[46:03] dwells in us
[46:06] we must know by god's grace
[46:09] that god doesn't give his secrets to
[46:11] everyone
[46:13] you must be a special class of people
[46:16] and the reason why i'm saying these
[46:18] things because even though we know these
[46:20] things
[46:21] because of the message
[46:23] we have allowed ourselves become
[46:25] dolatory we have allowed ourselves to
[46:28] become complacent
[46:30] we have allowed ourselves you know uh
[46:33] the word to be common and listen this
[46:36] word that we have in this day has has
[46:38] come to do a mighty thing
[46:40] uh with us
[46:42] and that is to change us from glory to
[46:45] glory
[46:46] it ought to be our vision
[46:49] every day
[46:50] to look for changes
[46:52] that god has made within us it ought to
[46:55] be in our vision to remain connected to
[46:59] him and to hear his voice on a daily
[47:02] basis not when you just come to church
[47:05] but it's something
[47:06] it's a fellowship it's a communion that
[47:09] god wants with us that's why calvary was
[47:13] made so that god can bring back the
[47:17] fellowship that he once had with us
[47:20] before the foundation of the world
[47:23] i mean can you imagine what it must have
[47:25] been like when adam and eve before they
[47:27] failed
[47:28] the glorious time they had in eden uh
[47:31] words
[47:32] the english words but perhaps could not
[47:34] even express
[47:36] what it was like and you know it's kind
[47:38] of like what we envision of heaven uh to
[47:41] be like no pain no sickness no sorrow no
[47:45] rainstorm no lightning nothing of that
[47:47] nature nothing that will do harm or
[47:50] danger nothing that's dangerous rather
[47:53] amen and that would do harm to us but it
[47:56] was like a peace and a love that
[47:58] literally as paul says passes all
[48:01] understanding
[48:02] amen
[48:05] jesus said in luke 10 21
[48:09] he said in that hour jesus rejoiced in
[48:12] spirit
[48:15] and said i thank thee o father
[48:17] lord of heaven and earth
[48:19] that thou hast hid these things
[48:22] from the wise and the prudent
[48:25] and has revealed them unto babes even so
[48:29] father for so it seemed good
[48:32] in thy sight and guess what
[48:35] when god brought us into christianity he
[48:38] did not tell us about all of the things
[48:41] we were going to have to suffer
[48:43] he did not tell us about the valleys
[48:45] that our sister was talking about
[48:48] because oftentimes we've been preached
[48:50] to or believe in our minds or somehow in
[48:53] our minds imagine that to be a christian
[48:56] would be able we'd be able to live on
[48:58] the mountaintop would be such a super
[49:00] race that we'll never have the valley
[49:02] experiences but in reality
[49:05] in order to have a mountaintop
[49:07] experience you've got to have the
[49:09] valleys
[49:10] now the beautiful thing that i love
[49:12] about the word of god
[49:15] is that he never tells you
[49:18] what it's going to be
[49:20] like
[49:21] in your journey
[49:25] he never tells you about the hardships
[49:27] because see if we understood or would
[49:29] understand the things that we we would
[49:32] be confronted with maybe we wouldn't
[49:34] come
[49:36] but he calls us by his grace and his
[49:39] mercy and he gives us the holy ghost a
[49:42] power that will withstand
[49:44] all demon power
[49:50] when we think about it
[49:53] i think about
[49:56] moses
[49:59] moses was having a wonderful life
[50:02] in egypt
[50:04] he wasn't suffering
[50:05] i don't think moses was malnutrition
[50:09] i don't think moses had any natural
[50:12] afflictions
[50:14] because he was really the next to be in
[50:16] line
[50:18] but moses was a secret
[50:21] to egypt
[50:23] and god was a secret to moses
[50:27] and so
[50:28] god kept those things
[50:31] until that appointed time and let me
[50:33] tell you each and every one of us here
[50:35] tonight
[50:37] maybe you're not conscious of who you
[50:39] really are
[50:41] but you have an appointed time with god
[50:44] where god is going to reveal to you
[50:46] exactly who you are in your relationship
[50:49] to him amen
[50:50] but even when that is done it doesn't
[50:53] mean that the road is going to be easy
[50:56] we're traveling a hard road
[50:58] a road of suffering amen because through
[51:02] this suffering as i said the other day
[51:04] it brings us into a place of pure gold
[51:08] but the gold must be beaten amen
[51:11] think about it
[51:14] god can't just give you authority and
[51:16] power amen and a place of rulership
[51:23] when he knows you don't know how to
[51:25] handle it
[51:26] or even what to do with it
[51:29] of course we've seen that through the
[51:31] pentecostal age people who had gifts of
[51:33] discernment or whatever it may be just
[51:36] speak things out and destroy people's
[51:38] lives even though they were true
[51:41] they didn't even know what to do with
[51:43] the gifts
[51:44] and god needs maturity
[51:47] he needs somebody who knows what to do
[51:49] and let me tell you something about this
[51:52] kind of authority must be ruled by love
[51:57] amen divine love
[52:00] if it's less than that it will fall and
[52:02] fail it would cause harm to people
[52:06] that's why god
[52:08] what he does he does
[52:10] well
[52:12] so he called moses and moses is trained
[52:15] on the pharaoh he he's a scientist and
[52:17] he know all the mathematics of
[52:19] of everything he probably was number one
[52:21] in his class i don't know
[52:24] but the point is when god called him
[52:27] he didn't say moses come
[52:30] but he put a desire in moses
[52:33] he put a yearning in moses and once
[52:36] moses realized that those slaves out
[52:40] there was not only slaves but they were
[52:42] brothers
[52:43] they were sisters
[52:45] and when he realized amen that those
[52:47] were his people and those people had a
[52:50] god
[52:51] he understood that the people out there
[52:53] were brothers and sisters and their god
[52:56] was his god amen it made him thirst
[53:00] and when he saw that egyptian kill his
[53:03] brother
[53:04] moses in return killed the egyptian
[53:07] guess what god didn't tell him
[53:11] god never showed him what his future was
[53:13] to be
[53:15] here was a man driven
[53:17] by something on the inside
[53:20] because the word of god said
[53:22] he had chose to suffer
[53:24] with the children of with his family or
[53:27] his the people of of israel than to be
[53:30] called the pharaoh's daughter so moses
[53:33] chose
[53:35] to be
[53:37] a
[53:41] and jew he chose to be a jew he was
[53:44] exiled
[53:46] can you imagine where is this god
[53:49] and what we do not know that little part
[53:51] of the story where he left egypt and
[53:54] traveled through the desert we have no
[53:57] idea
[53:58] what he suffered
[54:01] just like when you go through your
[54:03] desert experience
[54:04] nobody knows
[54:07] what you're suffering
[54:09] but understand by god's grace god keeps
[54:12] it a secret
[54:14] why
[54:15] because
[54:16] faith must move you
[54:18] trust must move you
[54:20] you understand me
[54:22] trust in the lord with all your heart
[54:25] and lean not to your own understanding
[54:28] the bible says if you acknowledge him in
[54:31] all of your ways he shall direct your
[54:35] path now moses did not have a map
[54:38] amen
[54:41] but he was being led by the holy spirit
[54:43] and did not even know it
[54:48] you hear what i'm saying oftentimes
[54:50] we're being led by god and don't even
[54:52] know it
[54:53] why because god has an appointment with
[54:56] you
[54:57] he has a place that he's placing you
[55:00] a position he's
[55:02] positioning you in
[55:04] and he's going to take you to that place
[55:07] but remember
[55:10] moses was on the back side of the desert
[55:12] for 40 years
[55:15] and what was god doing
[55:17] beating all the nonsense out of it
[55:20] all that science and all that education
[55:23] and all that i know and i know and i
[55:25] know and all whatever pride he had god
[55:28] had to beat it out of him
[55:30] and god called calls him to marry guess
[55:34] what
[55:35] a sheep heard his daughter
[55:39] that was the lowest of all laws
[55:42] to be a sheepherder in egypt was
[55:46] lower than being a garbage man today
[55:49] now they make pretty much pretty good
[55:50] money nowadays but back in my day you
[55:53] know what i'm saying
[55:54] people used to pick at them but my point
[55:56] is i'm trying to tell you before god can
[56:00] exalt you he must humble you
[56:05] and he hides himself
[56:08] in darkness
[56:10] no doubt when god
[56:12] talked to lucifer or the devil about
[56:15] job job had no idea what was coming his
[56:18] way think about
[56:20] how difficult it was for job when he
[56:22] knew that his life had been righteous
[56:24] before god
[56:26] and then all of these things
[56:28] befalls him and his best friends are
[56:31] calling him a sinner questioning him
[56:34] questioning his his create christianity
[56:36] let me say it like this
[56:39] people are not going to always talk well
[56:41] of you
[56:42] satan will purposely put thoughts and
[56:45] evil thoughts in their minds against you
[56:48] and cause them to persecute you
[56:52] and what you're going to do about it
[56:55] like you say praise and praise them in
[56:57] the morning
[56:58] see what you must understand is that
[57:01] whatever comes your way
[57:03] all things work together for the good
[57:05] god didn't say he was going to explain
[57:07] everything to you amen amen god is not
[57:09] going to explain everything to you
[57:12] because what
[57:15] but he's looking at you and says i want
[57:17] you to trust me
[57:19] i want you to believe in me
[57:22] i want you most of all to love me
[57:24] see what we fail to see is this little
[57:27] thing with listen we call ourselves a
[57:30] bride
[57:31] so what god is doing
[57:33] testing your love for him
[57:37] is that right
[57:38] for sickness in health
[57:41] for richer
[57:43] for poor
[57:44] for better
[57:46] for worse and when he brings the worst
[57:49] we can hardly take it
[57:53] right but that's that's that's the kind
[57:55] of if you love him you stay with him
[58:00] hallelujah is that right you think peter
[58:02] james and john and the rest of those
[58:04] disciples when they were offered
[58:07] a a a time to leave when jesus said will
[58:10] you all go to
[58:13] they responded lord where is we gonna go
[58:16] you have the words to eternal life
[58:19] now you better unders
[58:20] why am i preaching these things because
[58:22] darkness is coming
[58:25] what we're going through now is just
[58:27] child's play
[58:29] you must understand there's a rough time
[58:31] coming
[58:32] and you've got to have the goods in
[58:34] order to pass through it yeah i'm not
[58:36] trying to make you worry but i do want
[58:38] to make sure you get the holy ghost
[58:41] because the holy ghost is going to be
[58:42] the only thing
[58:44] that will gain ground of the oncoming
[58:47] storm
[58:50] surely god will do nothing that's what
[58:51] brother adam said he tells us
[58:54] it's coming
[58:56] hallelujah
[58:57] but at the same time he reveals himself
[59:00] now every one of us can testify we've
[59:03] had a miracle of some sort
[59:06] of supernatural thing happen in our life
[59:09] i mean things that we cannot even
[59:10] explain and we know we weren't worthy of
[59:13] them but yet god did them anyway amen
[59:15] those are the things that you glean from
[59:18] you know in the hard and difficult times
[59:20] when the devil comes to you and says hey
[59:23] he ain't real
[59:25] he don't love you now i know i'm
[59:27] preaching a simple message but i'm
[59:28] preaching it because i want you to
[59:30] understand god did not even spare the
[59:32] prophet
[59:36] god allowed him to get in trouble
[59:39] you think god said oh i didn't know you
[59:41] was going to reject those pentecostal
[59:43] people no he knew it he also knew the
[59:46] flood was coming amen
[59:48] hallelujah but why did he allow him to
[59:51] do these things because he had in his
[59:54] mind
[59:55] something else
[59:57] that was going to be greater but god
[1:00:00] needed obedience that's right
[1:00:03] he needed obedience from the prophet and
[1:00:06] let me tell you something that's what
[1:00:08] happens in our lives when we fail to be
[1:00:10] obedient god will allow things to come
[1:00:14] in our lives to make us obedient
[1:00:17] and what are those chastisements
[1:00:21] god we're chasing us
[1:00:23] if he loves you
[1:00:25] and the bible said he's chasing those
[1:00:26] whom he loved
[1:00:28] listen
[1:00:29] let me move on
[1:00:31] according to the exposition of seven
[1:00:33] church ages
[1:00:34] brother brahman said you will recall
[1:00:36] that i mentioned
[1:00:37] that at the beginning of this message
[1:00:39] that this book we are studying is the
[1:00:42] actual revelation of jesus himself
[1:00:46] in the church
[1:00:47] and his work is in the future ages
[1:00:51] then i mentioned that it takes the holy
[1:00:53] spirit to give us revelation or we'll
[1:00:57] fail to get it
[1:00:59] hello
[1:01:01] bring these two thoughts together you
[1:01:03] will see that it won't take just
[1:01:05] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[1:01:09] book real
[1:01:10] it is going to take the operation of the
[1:01:13] holy ghost
[1:01:14] that means the book can't be revealed to
[1:01:17] anyone but a special class of people
[1:01:20] it will take one without prophetic
[1:01:23] insight it will require the ability to
[1:01:26] hear from god it will require
[1:01:28] supernatural instructions not just a
[1:01:31] student comparing verses with verses
[1:01:33] though that is good but a mystery
[1:01:36] required the teaching of the spirit or
[1:01:39] you'll never become clear
[1:01:41] and what are you saying
[1:01:43] how we need to hear from god and lay
[1:01:46] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[1:01:49] spirit to hear and to know
[1:01:53] because many many thousands of people
[1:01:57] read this bible
[1:02:00] many people read and study the message
[1:02:02] books
[1:02:04] and they intellectually get it
[1:02:07] that's not it
[1:02:09] you really need the holy ghost
[1:02:12] you need the power of god moving in your
[1:02:15] life bringing you from glory to glory to
[1:02:18] glory from virtue to virtue to virtue
[1:02:21] because this is the secret the secret is
[1:02:25] the reproduction of god amen
[1:02:29] that's what it's all about
[1:02:31] when god made adam in his image
[1:02:34] and likeness
[1:02:36] it was the shadow and the type of what
[1:02:38] god's real intentions were
[1:02:41] and this first adam failed him
[1:02:44] but the second adam who was a quickening
[1:02:47] spirit
[1:02:49] he had an offspring he had a seed
[1:02:52] and we are they amen and you got to
[1:02:55] recognize who you are in order to go
[1:02:57] forward you must understand god has
[1:03:00] secrets he's not going to tell you
[1:03:02] everything
[1:03:04] and when he brings things upon you he
[1:03:07] expects you to be obedient
[1:03:10] and most of all
[1:03:12] he expects you to love him even more
[1:03:17] when you come through a trial
[1:03:20] that's how it is with little children
[1:03:21] when they don't have
[1:03:23] such a mind to reason and to think you
[1:03:25] can spank them and they'll run right to
[1:03:26] you instead of running away from
[1:03:30] oftentimes we've gotten so grown when
[1:03:32] god spanked us we want to run from him
[1:03:34] and
[1:03:36] accept satan's idea that he's evil and
[1:03:39] god is not evil
[1:03:41] satan is evil
[1:03:44] the rest i said earlier the main reason
[1:03:46] purpose you are here is to become the
[1:03:48] sons or daughters of god
[1:03:51] knowing this you should make every
[1:03:53] believer to press in other words
[1:03:55] knowing this you should as a believer
[1:03:57] you should press press press press
[1:04:00] because oftentimes we can get
[1:04:05] what's that word
[1:04:07] let's just say you get relaxed
[1:04:11] you get relaxed
[1:04:12] and now we don't have time the time is
[1:04:15] not even on your side it's running out
[1:04:17] and yet people can't see the time is
[1:04:19] running out
[1:04:21] that's why paul said press toward the
[1:04:23] mark of the prize of the high calling of
[1:04:26] god in christ jesus
[1:04:29] you understand what i'm saying
[1:04:31] you ought to stop thinking like men
[1:04:34] we got our focus in the wrong place
[1:04:37] now it is all it is insane let me say it
[1:04:40] like this
[1:04:41] it's an insane thing
[1:04:43] to make you think that as a christian
[1:04:46] you're going to have jesus on your mind
[1:04:48] all the time and i'll explain that to
[1:04:51] you
[1:04:53] because you got to live
[1:04:56] you got to go get groceries
[1:04:58] you got to work
[1:05:00] but he said this this is how he says it
[1:05:03] whatsoever you do in word and or indeed
[1:05:06] do it all in the name of jesus christ
[1:05:09] y'all understand what that is
[1:05:11] because when you're on on and you're
[1:05:13] doing a math question a math of math or
[1:05:16] any kind of equation in school jesus is
[1:05:19] not on your mind
[1:05:23] you understand me the math is on your
[1:05:25] mind
[1:05:27] but in order to include him you have to
[1:05:29] ask jesus to give you understanding of
[1:05:32] the math
[1:05:34] acknowledge him
[1:05:35] and he will direct your path
[1:05:38] see
[1:05:39] but a lot of times we think that oh my
[1:05:41] he's going to be so and we're just going
[1:05:43] to be like
[1:05:44] angels like oh i don't know how that is
[1:05:46] but i long to be yielded to god where
[1:05:50] you know he's constantly on my mind
[1:05:54] first peter 1 7 says that the trials of
[1:05:57] your faith and
[1:05:58] and the reason why i keep saying this
[1:06:00] because the reason why i brought it
[1:06:02] because god
[1:06:03] secrets are your trials
[1:06:07] not all of his secrets but some of his
[1:06:08] secrets are your trials
[1:06:10] he never tells you right
[1:06:13] right
[1:06:14] oh come on folks that's it's the truth
[1:06:16] and i want to say to those who are not
[1:06:17] married yet a lot of times people when
[1:06:19] they get married oh my goodness you see
[1:06:21] the you hear the birds singing and you
[1:06:24] know
[1:06:24] you you just and everything and you know
[1:06:27] butterflies flying
[1:06:31] and he's yours
[1:06:33] and you're here
[1:06:35] but there are going to be bumps in the
[1:06:37] road
[1:06:40] everything ain't going to be oh how does
[1:06:42] it hunker dory you won't know what that
[1:06:44] word means but anyway everything is not
[1:06:46] gonna be lovely
[1:06:49] oh y'all
[1:06:51] yes uh
[1:06:53] why do you think people say well you
[1:06:54] know people need to be counseled before
[1:06:56] they get married
[1:06:58] because you need to understand
[1:07:01] that marriage goes through seasons
[1:07:06] when you need to be prepared and the
[1:07:07] only thing that makes you prepared for
[1:07:09] that seasonal changes is lobe
[1:07:17] that the trials of your faith being much
[1:07:19] more precious than gold that of gold
[1:07:21] that perishes
[1:07:23] the gold of god is a christ-like
[1:07:26] character produced in the fiery furnace
[1:07:30] of affliction
[1:07:32] don't you just love it
[1:07:38] you know why i'm preaching this because
[1:07:40] i'm so tired
[1:07:42] of the message people we believe we we
[1:07:46] we just hear all these goody good things
[1:07:49] and we fail to see you've got to suffer
[1:07:51] to get that amen
[1:07:54] it would have been wonderful if jesus
[1:07:56] didn't have to go to calvary but he had
[1:07:58] to go to calvary
[1:08:00] he had to be beaten
[1:08:02] he had to be scourged he had to be
[1:08:04] mocked he had to be sped upon
[1:08:07] and guess what
[1:08:09] god
[1:08:10] did not tell him
[1:08:12] everything about the journey
[1:08:15] brother branham said he went to calgary
[1:08:17] as a man
[1:08:20] he knew it was going to be rough because
[1:08:22] in the garden he says father i would
[1:08:24] that you this cup passed from me but
[1:08:26] nevertheless not my will thine be done
[1:08:30] and that's how the bride prayed not my
[1:08:33] will but dying be done
[1:08:37] see
[1:08:39] every step of the way
[1:08:41] he went up got gotham
[1:08:46] as if
[1:08:49] when he got to the top
[1:08:51] and they nailed him to the cross
[1:08:54] jesus had never felt pain
[1:08:57] like that before
[1:09:00] you think the beatings were bad
[1:09:04] but when they pierced his hair
[1:09:06] and pierced his feet
[1:09:11] i can't imagine it
[1:09:13] and hook he hung between heaven and
[1:09:15] earth
[1:09:16] on that cross i know i know but you see
[1:09:19] every time i think about my sufferings i
[1:09:22] think about here and mine can never
[1:09:24] compare
[1:09:26] to what he suffered from me
[1:09:28] that's why i love him so much
[1:09:32] because through all that torture
[1:09:35] all that torture
[1:09:37] he stayed
[1:09:39] with the plan of god
[1:09:42] he never looked to the right nor did he
[1:09:45] look to the left the bible said he set
[1:09:47] his face like a flint
[1:09:50] and that's what we must do
[1:09:52] when the squeeze comes when the pressure
[1:09:54] comes and it's still it's moving people
[1:09:57] that's the thing that gets me maybe i'm
[1:09:59] losing my mind but i know what i'm
[1:10:01] looking at
[1:10:03] and we've got to be prepared
[1:10:06] we must be prepared
[1:10:08] and the only preparation god gave us was
[1:10:10] to have the holy ghost
[1:10:13] you got to know that you know you got it
[1:10:16] i keep telling people if it's not the
[1:10:17] holy ghost ain't doing a good job now
[1:10:19] what he's going to do when the real
[1:10:20] thing come
[1:10:23] help us jesus
[1:10:28] he said but what kind of gold does the
[1:10:30] church have today
[1:10:32] it has but the worldly gold that will
[1:10:35] perish it is rich it is complacent
[1:10:39] see that's the word i was looking for it
[1:10:40] is complacent it has made of affluence
[1:10:44] the major
[1:10:45] criterion of spirituality the evidence
[1:10:49] of god's blessings and the correctness
[1:10:51] of doctrine and etc is now based upon
[1:10:54] how many rich folks are involved in it
[1:11:01] yeah jesus didn't have none
[1:11:05] you had better come before it too late
[1:11:07] said the lord and by me gold tried in
[1:11:11] the fire amen and then you will be truly
[1:11:15] rich
[1:11:16] let me say it like this
[1:11:20] this is what i love about it
[1:11:22] god has given us illustration after
[1:11:24] illustration i'll never leave you nor
[1:11:27] will i forsake you
[1:11:29] and when you think about gold truck when
[1:11:31] i think about gold tried in the fire i
[1:11:33] think about those hebrew boys they did
[1:11:35] not know
[1:11:37] did you know that when they went down to
[1:11:40] babylon god told them you got to go
[1:11:44] and if you don't go
[1:11:46] you'll be killed
[1:11:48] he forced the issue why because god
[1:11:51] wanted to manifest himself in babylon
[1:11:55] sometimes god puts you in positions and
[1:11:58] you don't even know why you're there but
[1:11:59] the reason why god puts you in awkward
[1:12:02] position is so that you can shine the
[1:12:05] light of god to these unbelievers
[1:12:08] it's the truth
[1:12:11] think about it
[1:12:13] think about this these secrets that god
[1:12:16] unfolds and then we come to a place and
[1:12:19] then we begin to see it's like a job you
[1:12:22] come to work and you don't understand
[1:12:24] that they you don't even know that
[1:12:25] they've actually added more work to your
[1:12:27] schedule
[1:12:30] but you knew and you know
[1:12:32] god gave you the job
[1:12:36] you understand me you don't get upset
[1:12:39] there's a reason for it
[1:12:41] god want to see what you're going to do
[1:12:43] under pressure and that's who you are
[1:12:45] under pressure
[1:12:49] you know what i'm saying and when we see
[1:12:51] ourselves exploding like a volcano we
[1:12:53] need to get before god and say god have
[1:12:55] mercy on me take this evil out of my
[1:12:58] heart
[1:12:59] see because god knows your tester is
[1:13:02] evil but he's trying to get that evil
[1:13:04] out of your heart
[1:13:06] that's what he's doing
[1:13:09] he wants examples he you say bride god
[1:13:11] god got plenty of church members there a
[1:13:13] lot of church folks out there god
[1:13:15] working with pride he's making folks
[1:13:17] into his image and into his likeness the
[1:13:19] same the same the same and whatever
[1:13:23] jesus did under pressure is what we're
[1:13:25] supposed to do under pressure
[1:13:33] he said you better come before it's too
[1:13:35] late said the lord and by me gold tried
[1:13:38] in the fire and then you will be truly
[1:13:40] rich
[1:13:41] are we getting it listen to me
[1:13:44] naked physically we came into the world
[1:13:46] but naked spiritually will not leave it
[1:13:49] oh no we are going to take something
[1:13:51] with us what that something is is all we
[1:13:55] can take with us
[1:13:57] nothing less nothing more so when so we
[1:14:00] had better be real careful how to see
[1:14:04] that we take something that we make us
[1:14:07] right before god so then
[1:14:11] what will we we take with us
[1:14:13] we will take our character brother
[1:14:16] that is what we will take with us
[1:14:19] now what kind of a character will you
[1:14:21] take with you
[1:14:23] will it be his
[1:14:24] his whole character was molded by
[1:14:26] suffering in the fiery furnace
[1:14:28] affliction or will it be the softness of
[1:14:32] this character-less
[1:14:34] character-less laodicean people
[1:14:38] it is up to each one of us
[1:14:41] for in that day every man will bear his
[1:14:44] own burden
[1:14:48] the lord requires it
[1:14:51] don't be afraid of the fire no more than
[1:14:53] the three hebrew boys were they said if
[1:14:57] he deliver us or if he does not deliver
[1:15:01] us we will not bow
[1:15:03] and that's the thing we're not going to
[1:15:05] vow
[1:15:07] you understand me now i'm kind of moving
[1:15:09] to the future of things because what
[1:15:11] we're going through now is not that not
[1:15:12] the pressure that's coming
[1:15:14] but the pressure that will come the
[1:15:16] prophet god said they will turn against
[1:15:18] you they will turn against us and we
[1:15:21] will be persecuted we will run
[1:15:25] we'll try to run
[1:15:28] y'all understand me it's not going to be
[1:15:31] pleasant
[1:15:32] and none of us will escape
[1:15:36] right
[1:15:37] oh well you say well praise god you know
[1:15:40] that's that was my attitude i'm under
[1:15:41] the blood
[1:15:43] i can't get corona
[1:15:47] huh
[1:15:48] that's how we think sometimes i got
[1:15:50] enough faith it ain't going to happen
[1:15:52] but if it's ordained
[1:15:55] it's going to happen
[1:15:56] we never knew that jesus christ got sick
[1:15:59] at times
[1:16:01] except the prophet told us
[1:16:03] he had afflictions
[1:16:05] there were times he had headaches
[1:16:08] he had to get away from the crowd
[1:16:11] he went to go find peace
[1:16:15] as a man he had those things but he had
[1:16:18] it he had so much god he never did sin
[1:16:23] amen
[1:16:26] he wasn't like job cursed the day that i
[1:16:28] was born
[1:16:31] he didn't get no he wasn't there
[1:16:34] and sometimes we get there amen
[1:16:38] don't you ever wonder
[1:16:41] you just trust that by god's grace i'm
[1:16:43] right and i'm gonna make it
[1:16:46] because sometimes when you if you ever
[1:16:48] wonder you think where would i appear
[1:16:52] you understand me
[1:16:54] my point is we know too much
[1:16:57] we've heard the word we know too much
[1:17:00] i'm not fussing
[1:17:02] please don't take it that way
[1:17:04] i'm just trying to explain and trying to
[1:17:07] get you to see that the fire is required
[1:17:11] when you when you
[1:17:13] answer the call
[1:17:15] there in in
[1:17:16] in revelation the third chapter he said
[1:17:18] come
[1:17:19] you know buy of me gold
[1:17:21] tried in the fire
[1:17:23] the fire is required
[1:17:25] to refine you
[1:17:27] to refine me
[1:17:29] or test his tests
[1:17:32] and god is going to test you in the in
[1:17:34] the ways that he knows it's going to
[1:17:36] hurt the most
[1:17:39] hello he said what do you mean
[1:17:41] jesus
[1:17:43] where did you get those scars
[1:17:46] what is the wound in the house of my
[1:17:49] friend
[1:17:52] watch ye therefore and pray always
[1:17:56] that you may be accounted worthy to
[1:17:58] escape all these things that shall come
[1:18:01] to pass
[1:18:02] and to stand before the son of man
[1:18:07] watching therefore and pray always that
[1:18:10] right now you got two things that we
[1:18:12] more than likely don't do we don't watch
[1:18:15] and we don't pray
[1:18:18] and those are the two things that god
[1:18:20] put together that you may be accounted
[1:18:22] worthy to escape
[1:18:28] god tries his children he always will
[1:18:30] and he always has from the time of the
[1:18:33] uh of
[1:18:34] the garden of eden
[1:18:36] you know what it's amazing because
[1:18:38] it looked like god didn't know what he
[1:18:41] was doing but he did
[1:18:42] he tried those who were standing perfect
[1:18:48] yeah
[1:18:48] and he put the serpent there
[1:18:51] and that's why i always say i said
[1:18:53] somehow adam in that short period of
[1:18:55] time gained a greater love for for for
[1:18:58] eve than he had for for god
[1:19:01] god's sadness has always been the same
[1:19:03] if you love me keep my commandments
[1:19:06] that's right he also had a law you know
[1:19:08] that you leave mother and father you
[1:19:10] know cleave to your wife so you know in
[1:19:13] all of that adam moved out knowing
[1:19:17] that he was wrong doing what he was
[1:19:18] doing even though eve
[1:19:22] was deceived
[1:19:24] probably god said god tries his children
[1:19:27] now listen to the message i'm not going
[1:19:28] to be long folks i know this is a
[1:19:30] wednesday night most of you tired and
[1:19:32] all of that but i wanted to bring this
[1:19:35] to you in the sense that you know we
[1:19:37] just had a glorious time i did
[1:19:41] but you understand that when god gives
[1:19:43] you a glorious time
[1:19:45] the devil is coming amen
[1:19:49] he's always there to try to take away
[1:19:52] what god has given you
[1:19:55] he's been appointed to do so that's
[1:19:58] right
[1:19:59] and you must understand that when you
[1:20:01] have a great time in charge is not a
[1:20:03] time to walk out those doors relaxed
[1:20:08] you better arm yourself with what god
[1:20:10] has given you because the storm is
[1:20:12] coming
[1:20:16] now listen to the message
[1:20:19] noah on the 17th day of february
[1:20:21] according to the word of the of god
[1:20:23] entered that ark
[1:20:25] and the next morning all of them was
[1:20:27] around expecting to see the rain start
[1:20:30] falling but the sun come up just exactly
[1:20:33] like it always did
[1:20:35] just a couple more hours and it start
[1:20:37] and it'll start the rain will start
[1:20:40] the day passed
[1:20:42] and i imagine noah her heart began to
[1:20:45] flutter
[1:20:46] i could say something
[1:20:48] uh right there
[1:20:50] but i better not but you you notice
[1:20:53] he couldn't get out if he wanted to
[1:20:57] he was sealed inside that let that sound
[1:21:01] it sound
[1:21:03] but what are you saying
[1:21:04] he was sealed he couldn't get out of the
[1:21:06] troubles
[1:21:09] out of the stone he was sealed in the
[1:21:11] stone
[1:21:13] and you know we've heard songs about
[1:21:15] when the storm you know lord the storm
[1:21:17] we've been in the storm too long what
[1:21:19] kind of stuff is that
[1:21:22] whatever the storm is
[1:21:24] we need to find out what it is that god
[1:21:26] is trying to get
[1:21:28] to get us to reflect amen
[1:21:33] hallelujah
[1:21:35] even as a man a woman tell a lie on you
[1:21:38] you need to start rejoicing
[1:21:40] that you've been counted worthy
[1:21:43] that god will allow that kind of a lie
[1:21:45] to be told on you
[1:21:47] look at peter james and john when they
[1:21:48] were thrown into the prison and his old
[1:21:51] always being you know that kind of thing
[1:21:54] you know why me lord
[1:21:57] no they rejoiced
[1:21:59] they were glad
[1:22:02] times and disappointments are going to
[1:22:04] come folks
[1:22:05] no they're not pleasant
[1:22:07] but at the same time
[1:22:09] it should never make you doubt your love
[1:22:12] for god amen and your trust for him
[1:22:18] i could just recall when my mom died at
[1:22:20] a
[1:22:21] young age just going to high school i
[1:22:23] didn't have nowhere to stay i had to go
[1:22:24] from one house to a neck to the next
[1:22:27] until eventually somebody in the family
[1:22:29] allowed me to stay
[1:22:31] as a young boy i could have gotten angry
[1:22:34] at god like some some people do that
[1:22:36] don't have no better sense than that
[1:22:40] but i can look back and say hey that
[1:22:42] worked for my good
[1:22:44] because as long as my mom was there i
[1:22:46] could i would have never seen god
[1:22:50] is when god removed my idol
[1:22:54] i was able to see him
[1:22:56] all things work and those things that
[1:22:58] seem like it's just
[1:23:00] it's so crushing to you
[1:23:02] praise god in it
[1:23:05] because god is not trying to kill you
[1:23:08] he's trying to bring life
[1:23:11] god is a god of life
[1:23:14] look at ruth and naomi and all of them
[1:23:16] what naomi had to go through in moab god
[1:23:20] never told uh them before they left when
[1:23:23] you go to moab you're going to have such
[1:23:24] a hardship no they went to moab because
[1:23:27] moab was flourishing
[1:23:29] they thought they had a good life for a
[1:23:31] while
[1:23:32] but the times turn
[1:23:35] and god didn't tell him when you go down
[1:23:37] there
[1:23:38] i got a young lady by the name of ruth
[1:23:40] that i want you to bring with you no he
[1:23:43] never told the secret
[1:23:45] because he was hiding those things even
[1:23:48] from the devil himself
[1:23:52] here well ruth is now saved through this
[1:23:55] whole situation and out of her comes
[1:24:00] jesus that line
[1:24:03] that's right you see what i'm saying
[1:24:05] so why didn't god the devil he he tried
[1:24:08] you know he i know he tried to kill you
[1:24:10] at some point in time but he couldn't do
[1:24:13] it
[1:24:14] why because your purpose is today
[1:24:16] what god wants to do with you it's still
[1:24:19] unfolding but you need to look to see
[1:24:22] what it is he wants you to do other than
[1:24:24] to be dilatory no no no no no there's a
[1:24:27] word there's a purpose for you being
[1:24:31] here and it's not to be just church
[1:24:33] members
[1:24:34] your pride
[1:24:36] you are free
[1:24:39] and god want to see you free
[1:24:42] so free that you can hear his voice
[1:24:44] and do what he's telling you to do
[1:24:47] even when it doesn't make sense
[1:24:54] he goes on to say how many days it was
[1:24:58] and then the second day passed the third
[1:25:00] day passed the fourth day fifth day six
[1:25:02] until a complete week pass and north set
[1:25:05] and sweated it out
[1:25:07] then what lesson do we get from that
[1:25:10] if god see god what if miss shakarian
[1:25:14] would have said when the holy spirit
[1:25:16] spoke thus said the lord there's a white
[1:25:18] mist going from her
[1:25:20] the cataract will leave and it never
[1:25:22] left for about two or three weeks but
[1:25:26] she kept sitting there saying it's got
[1:25:29] to be so it's got to be so y'all
[1:25:32] understand that
[1:25:34] it's like when healing comes
[1:25:37] and and you know god then gave you the
[1:25:40] victory
[1:25:41] you got to speak it
[1:25:43] amen you got to speak it's like that
[1:25:45] lady who had that big guard on her and
[1:25:48] and the other lady was dying from cancer
[1:25:50] and then her husband and their people
[1:25:52] was making fun and brotherhood say one
[1:25:55] day the angel of the lord came through
[1:25:57] the city
[1:25:58] you can't force his hand you just gotta
[1:26:00] wait till your change comes
[1:26:03] that's what god is trying to and that
[1:26:04] comes with trust
[1:26:09] i married a girl i didn't know
[1:26:14] but i wasn't worried about not knowing
[1:26:16] her
[1:26:17] god knew her
[1:26:20] y'all know what i'm saying i never dated
[1:26:22] my wife i got a word from the lord she
[1:26:25] was my wife i got up and i proposed to
[1:26:27] her three months later we were married
[1:26:33] we've never talked divorced you
[1:26:36] understand what i'm saying
[1:26:38] why because god i had a connection and
[1:26:41] god we connected god told me and i've
[1:26:44] never regretted married my wife
[1:26:49] what what i'm trying to say is it's real
[1:26:54] it's real can you say oh but that's not
[1:26:56] bible yes it is
[1:26:59] isaac never never met rebecca
[1:27:02] until that day
[1:27:05] and he didn't question her either
[1:27:09] immediately he took her and they went
[1:27:11] into the tent
[1:27:13] it's supernatural that you won't you
[1:27:15] want god to work in every aspect of your
[1:27:19] life
[1:27:20] especially when it comes to marriage
[1:27:25] somebody say hallelujah
[1:27:28] glory to god
[1:27:32] it's the truth
[1:27:34] it's the truth
[1:27:35] but you know what we can't dictate to
[1:27:37] him we can't tell him what to do we've
[1:27:40] got to wait on him
[1:27:42] he's lord he's shepherd sheep never
[1:27:44] leaves the shepherd leaves the sheep
[1:27:49] hallelujah
[1:27:51] is that right
[1:27:52] when i had that little stroke and
[1:27:54] everything or whatever that was and my
[1:27:56] foot my left foot didn't want to obey my
[1:27:58] mind i walked and i ran saying in the
[1:28:01] name of jesus i'm healed
[1:28:03] now i'm healed amen
[1:28:08] it's the way it works
[1:28:10] when god gives you something you hold on
[1:28:12] to it that's building your faith
[1:28:15] that's preparing you for a rapture
[1:28:18] that's working on your translation
[1:28:21] trust
[1:28:23] because it's coming whether you see it's
[1:28:25] coming
[1:28:27] and how can you believe you're going to
[1:28:28] be translated if you can't believe on
[1:28:30] these natural little things that you ask
[1:28:32] god for and you need to wait on
[1:28:35] how many people had to wait longer than
[1:28:37] you
[1:28:40] abraham how many years he had to wait
[1:28:43] sarah how many years they had to wait
[1:28:44] for a son
[1:28:46] years i think it was 75 or so
[1:28:55] we can't even wait a day
[1:28:59] that is a while but you still have to
[1:29:01] wait
[1:29:04] huh
[1:29:04] hey look look look let me say it like
[1:29:07] this you you say well well what what
[1:29:09] look about look at jacob
[1:29:14] 14 years
[1:29:19] and jacob was so in love
[1:29:21] he said it was like being there day i'm
[1:29:24] like that's powerful
[1:29:26] that's powerful
[1:29:28] you understand me but that's how it is
[1:29:30] with god
[1:29:31] once you're in love with god your trials
[1:29:33] don't seem so long
[1:29:36] when you really fascinated about him and
[1:29:39] like you understand what i'm saying
[1:29:41] there's a brother there's a brother and
[1:29:43] i'm talking about bride i'm talking
[1:29:45] about marriage i'm talking about all of
[1:29:46] the things that we talk about when it
[1:29:48] comes to making a rapture this is what
[1:29:49] it's all about your bride
[1:29:52] then you ought to be fascinated
[1:29:57] fascinated
[1:29:58] about your bride
[1:30:00] or your husband rather
[1:30:02] right
[1:30:03] i remember a young man i mean he was so
[1:30:05] oh i had never seen it before in my life
[1:30:09] and he and his girlfriend was in the in
[1:30:12] the restaurant
[1:30:14] and he was like
[1:30:16] i mean it was like he was spelled out
[1:30:20] everybody
[1:30:22] we were driving through we were driving
[1:30:25] through the
[1:30:26] to the drive-through and we looked in
[1:30:28] the window and we saw the way he was
[1:30:30] breaking and all of us couldn't do
[1:30:33] nothing but laugh
[1:30:35] but that's
[1:30:36] the way it's supposed to learn
[1:30:42] you know the ark was made out of
[1:30:44] tomorrow and if you ever know what that
[1:30:46] was it lights her it's lighter than
[1:30:49] blossom it's nothing it's just like a
[1:30:52] sponge so light you could pick up a
[1:30:56] great big beam of it
[1:30:58] and hold it in one hand
[1:31:01] and would and wouldn't it seem strange
[1:31:04] that god would construct his art out of
[1:31:07] such a thing as that
[1:31:09] pour it and poured it into it to fill it
[1:31:12] up the pores and then he becomes harder
[1:31:15] than steel
[1:31:17] that's the way we have to do
[1:31:19] is empty out every creed everything that
[1:31:23] is in us every nonsense every ungodly
[1:31:27] unbelief that the holy spirit might feel
[1:31:30] us
[1:31:31] and seal every pore of our
[1:31:33] of of
[1:31:35] of of our uh excuse me of your neighbor
[1:31:37] excuse me and feel every poor believing
[1:31:41] every pore of our minds until you you
[1:31:44] won't notice whether it's your neighbor
[1:31:46] or who is setting around you you're
[1:31:49] sealed into the kingdom of god and then
[1:31:52] you can stand
[1:31:53] the buffet
[1:31:55] of the waves
[1:31:56] as you go through
[1:31:58] a persecution
[1:32:02] i'm giving instructions
[1:32:04] tonight
[1:32:06] i'm telling some secrets
[1:32:10] because we don't know what tomorrow is
[1:32:11] going to bring
[1:32:14] we don't know
[1:32:16] we have no idea what's up the road
[1:32:19] but whatever it is
[1:32:21] the will of the lord be done
[1:32:24] whatever it is it's yes lord
[1:32:28] hello
[1:32:29] whatever it is
[1:32:31] it's still i thank you lord
[1:32:35] i i'm closing in just a minute
[1:32:39] hallelujah
[1:32:40] for you're a gene of your father
[1:32:44] you were in your father yet your father
[1:32:46] had no fellowship with you because
[1:32:48] see you was there you were in there but
[1:32:50] you knew it not
[1:32:52] and he knew it not but you was
[1:32:54] manifested
[1:32:56] that you might that he might fellowship
[1:32:58] with you
[1:33:00] and you being born again
[1:33:02] you're born of eternal life
[1:33:04] and that's the only one form of eternal
[1:33:06] life and that's god's life zoe the greek
[1:33:10] word is zoe only one form of eternal
[1:33:14] life amen then if you are a son of god
[1:33:17] this is my last quote
[1:33:19] or daughter of god you were in god all
[1:33:21] the time we've heard this many times
[1:33:23] but he knew
[1:33:25] that bed in the end time that you'll be
[1:33:29] planted
[1:33:30] so now you made a you made a creature a
[1:33:33] son of god manifest the son of god
[1:33:35] daughter of god to meet the challenges
[1:33:38] of this hour
[1:33:40] y'all hear me
[1:33:42] if you're a son and a daughter of god
[1:33:44] you have been made and put in this age
[1:33:47] at this present time to meet the
[1:33:50] challenges
[1:33:51] of this hour to vindicate the truth
[1:33:55] and living god of this hour the message
[1:33:58] that's coming forth in this time so you
[1:34:01] got to understand it's not we didn't
[1:34:03] come here to be educated
[1:34:06] we come to be born
[1:34:08] we come to live we come to be the
[1:34:10] expression of jesus christ himself
[1:34:14] and understand with to come to the
[1:34:15] rapture go listen to christ revealing
[1:34:18] his own words i think that's 1964. you
[1:34:21] listen to that and see where you and i
[1:34:24] supposed to be going the goal that god
[1:34:27] has has established for us to achieve
[1:34:31] listen to it
[1:34:32] and you'll see that be prior to the
[1:34:35] rapture before he comes
[1:34:37] and literally comes you and i must be so
[1:34:40] much like him brother i'm saying we will
[1:34:42] be jesus christ
[1:34:45] in feminine form
[1:34:48] that's more than words
[1:34:51] that's a life that most of us
[1:34:54] have not yet obtained
[1:34:56] a place where we are pressing into
[1:35:00] but you've got to press
[1:35:02] i'm just going to cut it off
[1:35:04] we got to press into it we've got to
[1:35:05] understand it's going to we're going to
[1:35:07] have hardships
[1:35:09] things are going to get bad
[1:35:12] what about the early church
[1:35:15] what about them
[1:35:17] people who saw their moms their dads
[1:35:19] their brothers and sisters burned at the
[1:35:21] stake
[1:35:24] and yet
[1:35:25] they could not allow a speck
[1:35:28] of evil
[1:35:30] or hatred
[1:35:32] to enter their hearts
[1:35:36] they had to be so illuminated so
[1:35:39] uh into a place of god
[1:35:43] that when they were being burned or
[1:35:45] praised to the state
[1:35:47] they were actually feeling sorry for
[1:35:49] those who were persecuted
[1:35:51] you say that's not scripture yes it is
[1:35:54] because even stephen says father don't
[1:35:57] hold these things to their children
[1:35:59] he was feeling sorry for them that's the
[1:36:02] kind of love that's the kind of power
[1:36:04] that's the kind of god that must live in
[1:36:08] us in this day otherwise
[1:36:10] we're going to find ourselves
[1:36:12] fighting like peter before he was
[1:36:15] converted
[1:36:19] the secrets
[1:36:23] the secret is like what jesus said to
[1:36:25] peter
[1:36:27] peter
[1:36:28] love me
[1:36:30] more than these
[1:36:34] see you've got to love god more than you
[1:36:35] love yourself
[1:36:38] and only that comes through prayer
[1:36:41] it comes to prayer only prayer
[1:36:45] you can hear the word all day without
[1:36:47] prayer
[1:36:50] it's not going to work let's stay in
[1:37:05] god don't have to explain nothing to us
[1:37:09] remember the time that that little boy a
[1:37:11] little girl whichever it was died
[1:37:15] the brother adam told god you owe me an
[1:37:17] explanation
[1:37:20] said that to god god
[1:37:22] departed for him for about a month
[1:37:25] brother branham said when the lord
[1:37:26] returned
[1:37:28] to him fellowship
[1:37:31] he gave him
[1:37:37] that's what we do when we don't get our
[1:37:39] way we power
[1:37:41] we think that god told us something no
[1:37:43] we oh god
[1:37:45] and the saddest thing is we could never
[1:37:47] repay him for what he's done for us
[1:37:52] we
[1:37:53] know by god's grace now
[1:37:55] [Music]
[1:37:58] my life is still a secret
[1:38:01] i don't know what tomorrow brings
[1:38:03] but i know who brings tomorrow
[1:38:06] whatever comes my way
[1:38:09] i will trust him
[1:38:12] i'm going to hold fast to that which i
[1:38:14] know is real and true everything around
[1:38:17] me is some kind of illusion
[1:38:19] a nightmare or some kind of dream but i
[1:38:21] know god is real
[1:38:24] and
[1:38:26] sometimes god tries you in a
[1:38:28] place where
[1:38:31] it hurts the most
[1:38:35] i can tell you what even
[1:38:37] when it comes to my own children
[1:38:40] satan knew he couldn't get me to turn
[1:38:42] around so he
[1:38:43] jumped there
[1:38:46] what you think
[1:38:47] [Music]
[1:38:49] there's a place in my heart
[1:38:53] i'll never betray him
[1:38:57] he always will be my lord
[1:39:00] my savior and my king
[1:39:04] i started out i was determined
[1:39:10] if i had to go by myself
[1:39:12] [Music]
[1:39:15] and that's basically the way you ought
[1:39:17] to think
[1:39:18] because it is an individual race it is
[1:39:21] an individual walk
[1:39:24] it must be determined to meet jesus
[1:39:26] because i think to myself
[1:39:29] you're going to meet him
[1:39:31] whether you're on the right side or the
[1:39:33] left side
[1:39:34] you're going to meet him but you want to
[1:39:36] meet him on the right side
[1:39:38] i hate commit suicide kill yourself
[1:39:41] whatever you do you still got to meet
[1:39:44] him
[1:39:46] and i know how the devil said you won't
[1:39:48] you know want you to get out of things
[1:39:50] and i he's you know he's annoying me
[1:39:52] with those kind of thoughts too
[1:39:54] you know
[1:39:56] but thank god he didn't allow it to
[1:39:57] happen
[1:40:00] if he had not intervened it would have
[1:40:01] happened
[1:40:02] but he intervened
[1:40:05] i'm so glad he did it made me know
[1:40:08] he has a purpose
[1:40:13] you love the lord
[1:40:14] let's have a word of prayer
[1:40:16] [Music]
