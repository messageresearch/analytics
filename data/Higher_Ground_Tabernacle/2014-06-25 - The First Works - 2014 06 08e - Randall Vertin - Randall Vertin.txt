TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen how many have love loved the Lord down in your heart amen he's been so good to us amen let's turn to Revelation if we could by the grace of God we're just going to get right into the word it's good to see everybody here enjoyed the wonderful message from Brother Troy this morning we just appreciate all the Ministries that God has you know you find everyone's unique and uh we know brother Troy's is unique mine's unique everyone's unique you know speaking from an outsider's perspective I enjoy brother Troy's Ministry more than I enjoy my own and I think any other minister would say that about anybody's Ministry you just really appreciate the way the Lord uses different ones and just thank brother Troy for the sacrifice I know you know you you don't preach too often you know any Minister like you know is just kind of helping out in the church you don't always preach too often then to get thrown thrown uh from the frying pan into the the fire for all those Services right in a few weeks is a you know it's a sacrifice so we thank the the Lord for brother Troy and sister Aaron having to handle more of the burden with the children during the services all by herself so I know she's thankful to have to have her help me back again so we're just going to turn to Revelation Chapter 2 we're going to read Verses 4 through five by the grace of God and then we're going to turn to the Galatians s chapter 1 it says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove the thy Candlestick out from his place except thou repent amen let's turn over to Galatians chapter one it's a pretty Stern warning says repent and do the first works and that's what we want to preach on this evening we want to preach a message called the first Works amen Galatians chapter 1 and we're going to read verses 6-9 it says I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you unto the grace of Christ unto another gospel El which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a cursed as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be a curse amen let's just bow our heads in the little of prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we come once again for you father Lord we're not able in our Earthly body Lord to say anything that would be profitable to a man Lord we could certainly say words that would maybe encourage them in a in a fleshly way Lord but except you speak the words of Life by your Holy Ghost father there's no profit that can come from it Lord and we're asking right now oh God that your Holy Spirit would be here this evening Lord to speak to your people may you open the door to to the hearts Lord of each and every one here this morning this afternoon Lord that they Lord would just pull upon the word of God lord lord you're here even now Lord to to give the people exactly what they have need of father if they could just have faith oh God that that you're here to speak directly to them lord it's not just a man here to talk but Lord you've come down lord in a in a body of Flesh Lord Lord not just in in the the speaker Lord but even amongst your people Lord You're Here Lord you've come in the flesh Lord and we just pray that you would manifest yourself once again this evening Lord I pray that you'd speak to each and every heart Lord be be glorified in this place oh God may may something be said that would be profitable to the people Lord something that would go anchor deep into the hearts of the people Lord God and Lord we're not here Lord God just in a form or a fashion Lord we're not here to make a show but Lord God we want to draw closer to you we want Lord to when we go out of this place Lord God we wanted to be said that it was good to be in the house of the Lord and Lord God that you would have Lord we would feel Lord those bands of love that you spoke of Lord drawing us closer to you Lord that Lord every time we've heard these words father from this book Lord that you would just draw us deeper into your presence father you just as our brother preached this morning that that anchor we've put behind that Veil Lord that it would just be tugged on a little a little stronger Lord God and draw us deeper into your presence Lord closer to you than we were before we thank you for that father right now and we just ask that you'd bless each and everyone in a special way in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated by the grace of God we just want to speak on the first works you know it's so often that we get tossed and turned about we want to if you could just turn it down just a little bit brother it's seems as though it's almost kind of rebounding just a little bit a little bit of the Reverb there but we we we we get into the the presence of God we've come to understand so many of the Mysteries of the gospel of Christ that so many times you know we've heard a prophet preach against it over and over and over again about that intellectual spirit that comes into the gospel you have the spirit that comes by and wants to they just want to explain every little thing and there's no problems with explaining the scripture says in fact that that the people of God often perish for lack of understanding and and and and understanding is such an important part of being a Christian we want to understand the things of God we want to go deeper into the things of God but as we see here in the first church age in Ephesians and Revelation he says repent and do the first Works he said else I'll come and remove your Candlestick out from its place by what had happened he said they lost their first love something had happened there was something that happened to take the people of God away from the things that once anchored them to this word that Spirit of the nians had come into the church and tried to conquer those people through intellectual ideas they had a they had a they had a a a priesthood as it were it was supposed to be a five-fold Ministry prophets preachers the these teachers evangelists all these we know these things that are supposed to come through and preach the gospel to the people but what it happened was they started to take away the the power that was in the people and they placed it solely behind a Pulpit see what by the grace of God when when when the when the when I come up to preach my goal as a preacher is not to take away your part in the kingdom of God from you and place it upon me but but a preacher or a prophet or a teacher or an apostle or an evangelist I don't care who they are the the true Ministers of God have come to empower the people of God to do the works of God that's the first Works we're not here to take it upon myself to say I'm some great individual I'm some great man brother Brooks isn't here brother Troy's not here no matter who you are we're not here to to try to be just some great man but but as a preacher I want to empower the people of God to be everything that God's called you to be in this hour but it's a natural Spirit of man because man by Nature desires to be led there is a nature in a man that knows that there's a God they know that there is something greater than themselves you know you can hear it everywhere whether it be a spiritualist or a new AG person or whether it's a Catholic or a Baptist or whoever it is most everybody except the fool as the scripture has has said there's no God everybody knows that there is a God and there's a there is a deep desire though many can't understand it because they seek to fulfill it with everything else besides Jesus Christ they they they seek to fulfill that that feeling of leadership they seek to fulfill it through a through a demon whether it be drugs whether it be lust of the flesh whether it be alcohol it could be it could be anything it could be women it could be this or that or the other but but one thing or another is for sure is that a man will have a God that's something that cannot be denied a man will worship something but the problem is is that nature of a man if if not shown the true path to Jesus Christ the only true and living God there is a man will fulfill it with something and what happened in the church was that the church stopped preaching the true gospel of Christ and started preaching as he said another gospel he said you reject when Jesus was on the scene he said you reject me and I came in my father's name he said but there will come another in his own name and you'll receive him him and that's what we have now we've got so many coming in their own name and that's what caus the people to fall from grace in the first place because they all of a sudden they had these great supposed teachers and Prophets that would come through and preach in their own name it didn't seem like much at first but all it took was a twisting just a little bit here and there to twist it just enough to tweak it in such a way that what happened it made the people comfortable with it just like Eve see the Devil Couldn't just come out and say come do this Antichrist Spirit over here follow this Antichrist Spirit it would be a little too obvious so we had to cloak it in truth I mean it's a fact that if you buy rat poison and if you looked at the label on the rat poison 99.9% of that rat poison is actually rat food with just a tiny bit of poison mixed in there to kill the rat it never fails to kill the rat as long as they eat the food that that poison is laced in and that's what the people came to is a place where these supposed Apostles came to preach the supposed gospel they came in their own name preaching something that wasn't this word and it caused the people to fall it caused them to get lukewarm the scripture remember the word the word Ephesian means aim at and relaxed when you're a Christian you are an aimed at individual you are going every gun that the devil has his train upon You Yet brother Troy preached this morning when you went down to that water baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you made a confession whether you knew it or not you made it just as much before all the dev of hell as you did the people that were there to witness it and when you made that confession that you will follow Jesus Christ all the rest of the days of your life Satan made a vow right then and there he said I'll make it so he doesn't make it so and every day of your life that devil has been on you we can all witness to that we've all fought the battles we've all been through the trials the tribulations we've had the people talking about us and what happens is you see there's a scripture that's just been in my heart so much lately he says he says be ye not weary and well-doing because that's what the devil has really gotten the church with today we've seen through a prophet a gospel that could be lived God used brother William brandom in such a way to show the people not to make him a God but as an example to show that when a man or a woman could get their life behind the veil they can live so much so before God so righteously before God so much in that anointing that people would mistake him for God himself and people think that's a bad thing it's not a bad thing to be mistaken for God you're his son or daughter after all you guys are quiet did you guys eat too much it's all right it's all right we'll we'll plow through anyhow but the problem is is is people that that those first Works have been forgotten you know if you go back you find brother brandom he talks about that in that scripture he says what were the first Works he said Pentecost was the first works that was the beginning of the church the day of Pentecost and and what has happened in this message is exactly that I if you could look if you would look at the way that God has typed out his church Through the Ages you will see that this very message and even your life types out those seven Church ages each one of us has had an Ephesian time in our lives where we were that lion anointing go boldly going out there just ramming through everybody preaching the gospel with boldness living a life for God and then we've all gone through those relaxed moments of the Ephesian age where all of a sudden we cooled off a little more than we ought to have but by the grace of God God was able to give us space to repent you see this is what's so powerful about knowing who you are in Christ is to realize that no matter how far down you get in your walk all it takes is a repentant heart before God to bring you back in an instant that's probably one of the greatest tricks right now in this neurotic age that the devil's playing on the people is he gets the people to think he's brought them straight back into law again and they don't even know it because they're so busy looking in the mirror at themselves seeing how imperfect they are because they've made this word a law instead of seeing the grace behind it that all they can see is their shortcomings we've all been there I believe every single one of us has got to go through a Sinai experience you go through those periods where you can't see anything but judgment in your life every time you look in the word of God all you see is the Judgment because you can't live up to it and and that's what's happened to so many Believers is the devil see the devil will let you all day long believe that this word is true that's just fine by him you can believe it all you want to remember the the demons believe and tremble the devil will let you believe all you ought to that it's true what he doesn't want is that you could believe that it's true for you that's where he tries to get you at oh lay hands on the sick and they shall recover well that's just fine for brother Adam but I didn't live very good this week so God won't hear my prayer that's not true it I have a question if it was true that God wouldn't hear a sinner's prayer how did you get saved in the beginning anyhow God had to hear a sinner's prayer just to bring your heart to him and if you could have faith in that state how much more should you have faith right now knowing that you're sealed by the Holy Ghost into the kingdom of God but the devil Whispers In Your Ear constantly you're just not good enough I saw what you looked at this week on the internet I saw what you told this guy at work I saw what you said to your wife or husband yesterday how you disrespected him God doesn't hear you that's a lie from the pit of Hell yes there will be time brother brand we saw it in brother brandom's life when he prayed for his little baby and he said it was like a sheet came down between him God God like God wouldn't hear his prayer God heard his prayer his answer was no and there are times when God has to put the rod to you David had to go through it we heard the brother preach during the meetings Memorial Day meetings about David and basba but when when that baby came and go and Nathan said that baby will die David went and fasted seven days in sackcloth and Ashes for that baby and what happened the baby died anyhow David didn't get up from that and say well Curse God he didn't hear my prayer I thought he said I had the sure mercies of David no the scripture actually says his servants were confused because as soon as the baby died he they were worried cuz they said if this if he's this bad when the baby's still barely alive how bad is it going to be when we tell him the baby died and David had a little bit of wisdom about him he saw his servants all getting nervous about telling him he said the baby's dead isn't it they said yeah the baby's dead he didn't get all upset he went washed himself anointed himself and went and sat down and got some food food and his servants got mad they said why do you do this thing he said they said you fasted and prayed he said he said you know what he said I know God just a little bit he said he said I thought just perhaps maybe while the baby was still living that God would hear my prayer and let the baby live but he didn't go David did not go about the rest of his life lamenting well God you should have done this God you should have done that and isn't that what the devil gets us to do sometimes instead of believing that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord we spend so much time in could havein and has been instead of just believing God has his hand on your life I this I know this is hard stuff but see we got to get to a place where Pentecost can come alive again and until we have confidence in the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and the god of William bradam for your life we can't get anywhere as a church how are we going to succeed as a body of Believers if if the people of God cannot get behind the idea that you are blameless perfect Sons and Daughters of God in Christ Jesus and two we could not only that not only for yourself but you got to believe that about your brother or sister if you didn't hear what brother brother Choy preached this morning said sometimes you look at a brother or sister you don't know what's going on in their life you don't know what God's leading them through or how he's going to lead them out of it how many people would have written David off right after they heard about basba they say he ain't no King I thought I heard this was a guy after God's Own Heart I ain't going to follow him anywhere well they would have been in a big heap of trouble because God never put him out from being King but how many times do we see brothers and sisters having trouble and instead of of seeking after them you know I would just reading in the scripture it says if you find a brother overtaken in a fault he said go to them in the spirit of weakness how many of us have done that legitimately done that amen legitimately amen gone up to a brother or sister not because you just wanted to to beat him over the head with something that you held over them but because you loved and cared for that person you truly believed that God was in their life and maybe they just needed someone to tell them I know what you're going through I'm going to pray with you see because the scripture says to go and restore that brother it didn't say go to beat him over the head it didn't say go to accuse them and and take it before some kind of counsel but H how many of us could even do that in real love because all the while you're thinking well this I thought this person was somebody special or this or that well it could be it said go to them in the spirit of meekness lest the same thing come upon you oh my see now we're getting somewhere because there has got to be brothers and sisters there's got to be a love of Christ in this place that isn't here yet I hate to put up the the the big signs or something W you know this or that oh what is he saying but it's true I'm just speaking from the heart this I don't know why you know this is coming out the way it is I know it's cuz God wants it but you know we got to get to a place you you better real and I preached this before but I'm going to say it all again because apparently the Lord wants me say it again but you better we better get it through our heads and into our hearts get it out of your head get it into your heart this is the only real family you've got I don't care what the devil tells you I I don't care what you think you're wrong did not we hear see brother Troy you know through the Lord through brother troyb stole some of the words right out of my mind cuz I started thinking about said that's exactly right do not be unequally yolked together with unbelievers and what do we do oh they're family see make excuses oh they're this or that or they're these friends of mine or they're this of mine or this no do not be unequally yolked together with unbelievers that's not a that's not a suggestion and it's about time we realize what we have here we we have we have the only truth that this world can know right now we've got the only true believers in the world right here in De Mo Iowa and I don't care how hard you try I don't care if this person or that person Rubes you the wrong way you better start loving them and you better pray not for them pray for yourself that you can love people regardless of what they do because if you can't you won't be there oh brother that's hard but it's the truth how could you think that you're going to be in heaven with someone you can't supposedly stand it's not gonna happen and and it's not your willpower that's going to overcome these things it's only going to be the holy ghost in your heart we got so many Clicks in this church and we don't even have that many people it's a paradox but it's the truth I'm sorry I'm preaching hard but I got to preach from what in my heart and until this place this church the people of God could come together as one body without division among you the scripture says without division what Accord that means of the same mind that means of the same motive that means of the same ideas you know you're not always going to have the same ideas about a particular thing but what do you do you get behind what the Lord wants to do stop taking things personal about everything I'm I see I I'm a simple guy so I'm coming right down to where you're living okay I'm not going to try and preach way up here when I know we need down here all right you you got an idea you put it forth and and it doesn't go that way don't get all hurt about it go behind what the Lord is trying to do get get in one Accord with it put your hand to the plow and start pushing but we got we got people pulling in 35 different directions and the church can't go anywhere it's just the fact God wants to do something here he wants to do something but except we get back to the first works it's not going to go anywhere because if you don't start right you won't end right and God's not going to start nothing except it does start right but there's got to be a a heart amongst all of I'm speaking of myself all right I'm not just trying to beat someone up up on the head with it I'm talking to myself too if we cannot all get get behind the ministry here and that means brother Brooks that means the people of God that God has sent here if the people cannot get fully behind it then what's the point what is the point are you just here to fill a seat or yeah exactly it ought to be a little quiet he ought to be thinking sometimes you got to more like a lion I'm sorry I I shouldn't say I'm sorry I'm sorry if your flesh is hurt but that's just the way it is I hope you can push through that and see something spiritual here this this evening you better get past your ideas your ideas are terrible your ideas are going to send you to Hell your ideas are going to cause you to be a foolish vergin because you think you can do whatever you want to do it's not like that you either get behind what God's doing or get off the train be that's why I say you know I'm going here don't hinder me don't hinder me I want to go I may not be perfect but I'm going to do everything I can to get there and I I believe all of us could say the same thing but you see what it is there's isms there's schisms there's ideas most of them probably false that God that Satan has gotten people's heads he's playing mind games with people and I'm exposed to him right now that's probably why you're uncomfortable that's all right get uncomfortable cuz the flesh does not like this gospel and you better get used to it you want to be part of this gospel then don't be part of the world you have no part with Bal you have no part with the world if you love anything of the world the love of God is not in you that's the truth we want to make excuse after excuse after excuse to let these enemies squat on our land oh this or that oh you know I just can't relate to anybody here you are a message believer there's what 250,000 people in the greater de MO area thereabouts what there's what at the max when everybody's here maybe 70 of us if you want to feel special that's kind of an elite club if if I'm see I'm going I'm trying to even hit your fleshly side here there's no excuses if you want to feel a part of some elite club like this world tries to tell you you need to be I got to be VIP I heard it before you are VIP God saw fit to put you and the court group in Deo Iowa not just to fill a seat but to rock this city to shake this city for Jesus Christ somebody's got to step up and I'm telling you right now if this church doesn't God will raise up another one what did he say to the Ephesians he said I'll pull your Candlestick right out of its place he he'll pull AA on you if you're not careful he'll say I'll give your spot to one that's better than you do you want to hear God say that to you I don't believe there's anybody in here that's not good enough because it's not about how good you are I don't believe there's anybody in here that doesn't want to make a Rapture but it is time that we stop making excuses it's time that we stop blaming everything else and realize you know they got the old saying when you point your finger somebody else there's three fingers pointing right back at you you better realize that it's the truth of the matter I don't care what your brain is telling you right now the truth of the matter is what it is it I if if those disciples 120 in the upper room Lord only knows what backgrounds they came from they all didn't get along are you kidding me you put 120 people in this room and you're telling me there aren't going to be conflicts but there was one thing that United every single one of them see if you can't see I don't care if you don't like the way brother Adam raises his hands in church or you don't like the way Brother Rich says amen or you don't like the way brother Keith sings or I don't care what it is if you don't like that you know what forget about it ignore it because if there's one thing we should be able to get on one Accord about it's Jesus Christ and making a Rapture it it you know when you're doing math and you got two sides that don't agree you're doing fractions you know what they say find the lowest common denominator that's what I'm telling you to do this evening find the lowest common denominator if that's all you can do he's like I like the fish me and brother Austin been fishing a lot lately with brother Dan I kind of found I really like doing that I hadn't done in a long time I know brother Marshall likes to fish too maybe brother Isaac thinks fish is the nastiest thing that's ever happened I don't care why because I know when it's all said and done we on the same team it's not a see but that's how foolish it is that's how foolish it looks in the eyes of God I don't care how big it looks to you in the eyes of God it's foolishness I hope you're hearing what's what's being said this evening we need to get back to an ananas safier gospel and it's going to happen one way or the other and you're either going to be with it or against it but no matter how much you push against it it's still going to happen anyhow so you might as well get on the winning team and that means getting behind the ministry here brother Brooks didn't ask me to preach this but I'm going to preach it anyway you better whether you think he's the pastor or not you better start treating them like it I don't care what your mind says because your mind your mind to God doesn't mean anything you brother Braham said you ain't got one thought coming so stop trying to think they kiss thoughts God put him here God put you here I I don't see anybody here that I that that I know God put every single one of us here I've talked to Brother Rich I've heard his story I know brother Keith's story I know brother Connelly's story I know brother Adam brother Adam wouldn't be here if it wasn't for God God gave him that first job he had and now look where God's got him God's got him poised to possibly get a better one that's God proving his people and I'm going to tell you right now when God brought me here I know it was God I slept in my car in a Walmart parking lot for two weeks there ain't no man that put me here and there's no man that can take me out of here brother Brooks didn't sponsor me to come here I left everything I had and packed every belonging I had and a little G Liberty so much so I couldn't sit straight in my car cuz my mattress was crushing my head down and see I know where God put me and I believe I really believe that everyone here knows God put them here I believe that because almost nobody I see here I know brother Troy and sister Aaron you guys kind of grew up here and different ones were here and God used those people to start the core group group that brought everybody else so even if you started here you know you're supposed to be here cuz God has already used you I think about someone like brother Keith had a nice job was Cincinnati wasn't it down there working for Eco and then God transplants you look at look at what God's got here he's already bringing the people from everywhere I go from Li to Denver to here I didn't want to go to Ohio 2.0 but I'm here if I had my choice I'd probably be still in the mountains but God called me God called you all it's just the way God's got it so let's get behind it realize what we've got and work with what we got God's got people here for a reason you're not here just to fill a spot in a seat in or Pew whatever you want to call it that's not what you're here for you have a purpose even if it's just to sing every song service at the top of your lungs I say that's a pretty good Ministry because it did wonders for at Jericho that's a pretty good Ministry I don't care if it's just to clap your hands as hard as you can I don't care if it's just to pull on the word every time the preacher gets up to preach but you have a purpose and you better start realizing that your brothers and sisters have purposes too the you know they replaced that supposed Holy Trinity which we know is evil anyway they replaced it this age with an even more Unholy Trinity the Trinity of Me Myself and I and that's the Trinity people are living for now they don't even care about Christ anymore they're living for themselves I'm sorry to say but that's what I see in the church oh you say brother you don't have authority to say this well it's being said anyhow and either God speaking or he's not and I'm just getting that out of the way right now but God's going to say what he wants to say but either you're living for yourself or you're living for Christ and and the people of God because eternal life is living for others each each brother or sister ought to esteem one another before themselves and you don't realize what effect you have you're no it's noticed when people aren't here legitimately or not sometimes people got to go people got to go places or do things or whatever but rest assured it's noticed if brother Keith's not here I don't hear that Bas those bass tones going and I miss it if brother Troy's not here and sister Aaron's not here I I I don't get to see brother Troy raising his hands and I and I notice it if if if I can notice it and I'm just a natural Man without even a very good memory most of the the time how much more does god notice it I'm saying legitimate and non-legitimate and problem is there's a lot of illegitimacy going on you people people can't show up to prayer meetings people can't people couldn't show up to Bible studies you know it's just either either we're serving God all we got and putting everything oh you say I'm not trying to serve the church you're not serving a church you're serving God and you you don't realize how much you serve God by coming to the house of God you you want to get back to First works whatever happened to the all night prayer meetings those people of Pentecost used to do whatever happened to just getting in the house of God and worshiping so much so it's like a book of act experience in the house was shaken with the power of God it's real and it it's achievable for the people of God it's not just some far off f see land and even though maybe it doesn't sound like it in your natural mind I'm trying to encourage you right now cuz you got to realize it's for you and and and and brother brandom said the door to the heart the gate the key to the heart is your free will and you're either going to give your will to God or you're going to give it to the devil that's your that's your choice you only only have you only have one choice to make you're either going to give it to God or you're going to give it to the devil and many people are caught in that Valley of decision they want to serve God but they don't want to give up the things of the world and and I'm telling you right now brothers and sisters rest assured that when it comes to things of the world God will require the most precious thing you think you have he'll put you to the test oh you loved this you love this driving these cars over here God will might require that of you just to prove you why because God's approving God there there are times God wants to prove you so you can understand yourself isn't that what he said to the children of Israel he said I've wandered you around the werness he said I wanted to prove to you what was in you and then there are times when God sometimes wants to prove you to yourself and the devil just like he did with job job knew what he had he knew what he had he maybe didn't understand it all but he knew what he had because he knew he had his integrity that's why he told his wife I ain't going to listen to you I have my Integrity he knew who he was but he wanted to prove to the devil just what he did have see they're God but God's a proving God don't think you're just going to skate through unscathed you're going to fight your battles God's going to put you to the test you have I if the gold is never put in the fire it can't come out pure but we have a culture specifically in America but really all over the world now because America's infiltrated everything every almost everything's become Americanized but we have a culture let's turn to Second Timothy 3 if we could we're not going to hold you too much longer I know this is being hard but brothers and sisters I'm being real I wasn't planning on preaching any of this most of it 99% of what what we're preaching what what's being preached right now that's just that's just of God you take it or leave it 2 Timothy 3 we've all heard this scripture before but let's read just a little bit of it because you better understand what you're up against this though also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves can we not see that in this age I don't care if it's the NFL player doing his dance in the end zone or or the preacher in the mega church that just can't get out of the spotlight men are L lovers of their own selves they're Covetous they're boasters they're proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded and this is what I want to get you they're lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God you'd rather go to a movie or sit at home and watch TV that to be in the house of God that scripture ought to scream to you that you're lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God we've all been in those situations where the devil tempts us with those things because the flesh wants nothing more than to not be in the house of God and you'll find excuses oh it's really easy to get yourself to believe your own excuses all you got to do is believe it yourself if you can believe your own lie you can convince others because you really believe it that's why people can they can fake off the polygraph test and everything because that's what man that's what man and their fallen nature can do and you'll make excuse after excuse after excuse after excuse I don't like the preacher I don't like the singing I don't like the seats I don't like the look of the place oh the roof leaks sometimes oh it was too cold oh it was too hot oh the babies were too loud oh this or that I didn't like the perfume the person in front of me was wearing I didn't like the clothes this person was wearing I don't like the way this person sings your excuses are rubbish I do not come to the house of God to impress anybody but God I want to come to the house of God and give him what I've got if we could say it this way in a in a natural form we know that we are the Temple of Christ but this place is also supposed to to be a temple where you bring your sacrifices of Praise where you bring your offerings and prayers before God obviously you can do that anywhere you are a temple but this sacred place is where we come as a as an open show to show where we're standing and we come in we sit down we don't give God anything we act like he hasn't done nothing for us today we act like we don't have anything in common with the brother sitting next to us or the sister sitting next to us we act like there's there's something wrong with God when we stop when we fail to realize the problem is always with us what what man is going to try to find fault with God and you don't realize it you don't realize it right now in your mind when you're thinking why is this brother preaching like this that you're finding Fault With God not with me you would take it before God not my fault I preach this way God made me who I am God made you who you are how could I be mad at brother Marshall for for being who he is he was born that way so you can't get mad at me for preaching the way I do because that's just the way God made me unless I do something outside the word then you can go ahead and come to me because then that's just not me that's the devil anyhow are we all right I'm not going to stay I'm not going to preach much longer but you know there there's got to come to a place where the love of God in our hearts burns more than the love of anything for this world it's got to that when we're talking about first works this morning this is what I'm talking about where is your first love you know the devil has people convinced that they cannot maintain the level of dedication to Christ that they had when they were first Saved he has them convinced because why that's why do you think Paul had to say that scripture don't be weary and well doing why because your flesh doesn't like to pray your flesh doesn't like to to talk to people about Christ your flesh doesn't like to read your Bible your flesh in your natural self will get tired of hearing brother brandom's voice on the tapes you'll get tired of hearing my voice you'll get tired of hear in brother Brooks's or brother Troy's voice oh you might even get tired of hearing Donnie Reagan's voice I don't know but one day or another the flesh will try to tell you to do something that you're not supposed to do and until you can push through that you have to be talked to as babes as Paul said you can only be fed with milk you say brother this is so low well until we get to a place where we can love one another where are we going to go I'm really curious where are we going to go if we sit here fractured divided and separated one from another if I cut my hand off which I almost did my hand will die if you cut yourself off from the body of Christ you will die it is a foreg god conclusion why you oh well I could yeah there are you know see I could almost hear the excuses well brother sometimes you're just you're not in a place where there's a church you are the Temple of the Living God I'm talking about here we're we're talking about Higher Ground Tabernacle as a body of believers who have a purpose to fulfill in this day there is a reason I'm going to go back to it there's a reason you're here right now if God didn't want you to hear this you would not be here because I can guarantee you the dev devil does not want you to hear this right now but you're hearing it for a purpose so stop sulking stop pity partying and realize that we're on the same team get behind the one with the ball and start pressing for the End Zone we like sports in this nation so I'm going to use Sports analogies brother Brooks is the qub back the Lord Jesus is the head coach offensive coordinator defensive coordinator general manager and owner and we're the blockers let's get behind this gospel and start pushing for the kingdom of God I'm not talking about somewhere in the future I'm talking about right now I'm talking about being sincere before before God you could take this or leave it and you know what some of you may just leave it and you know what that's between you and God God you will hear my voice at the day of judgment when you don't make a Rapture because you won't love your you won't love the people of this church you won't fellowship with the people of this church because that we we don't have that I am sorry to say I'm speaking plainly because I can see what I see we do not have Godly Fellowship the way it ought to be in this church it is nonexistent we would rather fellowship with the world many of people we rather fellowship with their natural families whether they'd be saved or not if they're saved go ahead that's great if they're believing this message go ahead but you know what too many of us are more than willing to tread on the enemy's ground and then make ourselves believe in our heads that we're doing God a service you have no rights I you could look up the quote if you want but brother brandham said it he said you have no rights to meet them on their ground that's the Devil's Ground for a reason he owns it so don't go in there thinking you're going to change something because you're the one going on their ground that's like forgive me for being so blunt but that's like me going into a bar sitting down having a drink and thinking I'm going to win the bartender to Christ I have no rights on his ground that's not my area that's what we do we want to go on the Devil's Ground we'll we'll Fellowship all the time but oh Lord we have something for the church I it sounds like I'm fussing with you but I'm not I I I'm saying this out of love because I know for a fact that being on one Accord can bring the whole Holy Ghost why because the scripture says that it will bring the Holy Ghost down in this place so let's get there we want to do the first works we want an acts gospel here in Higher Ground we want to see the dead raised the blinded eyes open the lame walk the dumb talk and the power of God is more than able but he cannot be fully expressed until his people get behind the work of God it can't happen why because God doesn't just want to use anybody he wants to use you you are the instrument God wants to use in De Mo that's why you're here but until you actually get behind this work of God and start working with it you can't be used the way he wants you to so you say well why aren't I seeing these Miracles why are they seeing people get saved well maybe God wants to use you for that but he can't because you're not in tune with him oh that now it kind of hits down there doesn't it see we're making all excuses why God can't use us we don't know all along maybe he wants to but you just have to let yourself be used you have to give up the things of this world that's why you hear probably 50% or more or if not 90% of the sermons brother Brandon preach you'll hear him use that scripture if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God is not in you there's a reason why almost every service you'll hear Brother Braham say that at least once it seems like I mean I'm maybe over exaggerating but it seems like almost every sermon I hear that scripture I hear that scripture all the time why because that's what the devil's trying to do and the devil is going to be perseverant when it comes to attacking you and he's not going to use the things that you don't like if if you don't like football Satan's not going to try to tempt you with football he's going to try to tempt you with drinking or whatever thing that you thought you loved at one time you know and so we'll make the excuse over and over and over and over and over again why it's okay to do whatever it is that we do when we stop making excuses and realize that it's time to get things moving for God things will happen we gotta we have to have if I could say this we we have to have a Mount Si experience he said sanctify yourselves and prepare to meet your god so let's get to it let's get to it let's let's start by ignoring if I could say it this way ignoring our brothers and sisters in in terms of what they're doing Paul said I could be as others I don't want to be as others that try to commend themselves he said if you compare yourselves among yourselves he said you're not wise why because it's a moov it's a moving measuring stick if I compare myself to Brother Rich one day I might look like a saint because he's having a bad day another day I might be in hell because he's having a great day you see what I'm saying and this is where we get these up and down experiences because we're so busy measuring ourselves against rubber rulers that we can't just we just look to Christ he's the measuring stick I know I'm just talking but I feel like I'm pleading with you this morning or this afternoon I really want this to sink in because we've got to get there I I know God has got such a powerful Ministry for this church as a whole there's a reason we're all here there's a reason why the Lord took brother Brooks from Ohio and and brought him here you the God just doesn't uproot a pastor and bring him somewhere else for no purpose I don't believe God uprooted people and planted them here for them to die he planted them here for them to live this is Iowa right the land of the Corn and the and the fruits and all this fertile ground I believe there's a reason for that this is what they call the Heartland this is what they call the Bread Basket of America so let the bread come out out let that buy that that bread without money without price start letting God use you and stop letting the devil use you the choice is yours let's stand I'm not going to go any longer this is from my heart brothers and sisters I'm not trying to make myself to be something I'm preaching to myself I I told Troy this morning I said sometimes you come up and preach and instead of feeling like you're Swinging The Sword sometimes it feels like like you're falling on the sword you know cuz it cuts both ways but I I'm just speaking from my heart because there's got to be more for this church than where we're at and you oh you're not the pastor brother I'm not the pastor but I you know I have to speak what the Lord tells me to speak and I believe brother Brooks would amen every word of what's being said and I know the Lord is because he wouldn't let me preach it otherwise like I said if you don't want brother to be your pastor then you know what this might not be the church for you because God sent I'm a witness God sent brother Brooks here I I was there when he left I saw what he went through to uproot himself from there and come here I was a firsthand experiencer of that I wept when when he had to tell the church because he the Lord had used him in such a way and brought us all together brought different ones out of the denominations brought us there but I knew it was for a purpose and he knew it was for a purpose and you need to know it's for a purpose and you need to have faith that God sent brother Troy here you got to have faith that God sent me here if you don't then you know that's fine I I'm not going to try to convince you for my sake and I know brother Troy wouldn't this isn't about a popularity contest I'm not here to try and convince you for my sake but you know what I know that when God Speak speaks through me and I know God speaks through brother Troy and I know God speaks through brother Brooks and God speaks through everybody here this isn't again I'm not trying to to empower just preachers or or or anybody this is for everybody here I want to be the opposite of a nickon I don't want to conquer the lady I want to empower everybody in this church to realize that you have a place here we're not going to be perfect like those stones that rub up against one another people are going to rub up against you in the church people that you love they're going to irritate you I mean come on let's be real about it we got to understand this is a family right how many of you had brothers and sisters and how many of you didn't like them a lot sometimes but you love them now don't you why because most of us why I see all of us okay except for the ones sleeping back there little Lydia and different ones the little little ones we've all grown up right we've all matured we've come to realiz that all those little things about you know one time I had these big I'm just give you an experience I used to build these 3D puzzles they were the big three with the foam pieces and stuff and I built huge ones I built like the Notre Dame Cathedral and I built this huge castle and all these different they were big I was really proud of them they all sat in my room on the floor and collected dust because I didn't do anything with them but I was really proud of them and my sister one day came in and she tripped and fell and busted one of my puzzles and I got so mad I yelled at her and made her cry Lord forgive me I made her cry because I yelled at her so hard but you know what I look back we talk about those things now and we think you know what they're just memories now why because we've all matured to a place where we realize yeah we've gone through our little things and then we used to rub up against each other but now we can really appreciate each other as a brother and a sister and that's what God's looking for the people of God to do is to grow if I can say it this way without sounding like I'm being condescending but we need to grow up and start appreciating each other for who we are brothers and sisters fellow Warriors in the military there's one thing about people that'll tell you in the military you may hate the guy sitting next to you but when the bullets start to fly you better believe you're glad he's got your back brother Rich you were in the military you know what it's like there were probably especially in the Navy when you're cooped up with guys on a boat oh my goodness I bet you times you couldn't stand each other probably about getting to fist fights but I tell you what when the orders came that the enemy was coming or it was time to Shell the beach you better believe every Soldier was at his battle station why because he knew if he failed to hit that button to launch the shell if he failed to watch that radar to watch for enemy submarines if he failed to watch that radar for the aircraft or the whatever it was that might be coming everybody could die and I'm here to tell you right now that that is us if you're not at your post of Duty you may not even feel the consequence quences but your brother might achen took gold wedge in a Babylonian garment he paid in the end but his whole family paid not only that the men of Israel who went up to Ai and died paid the price so how many brothers and sisters have to die before we realize what we're up against here this isn't this isn't a joke this isn't just for fun and games this isn't this isn't uh uh just a exercise this is real life whether you realize it or not they had this thing they you know they call the butterfly effect in science they say you know just because everything affects they say they're looking at it in a whole Global scheme that every single thing affects itself everything affects the other thing they call it the butterfly effect because they say supposedly you know according to the theory that you know if you just maybe there's a there's a butterfly floating around in Japan and one flap of its wings changes something in the atmosphere that causes a tornado here in Iowa that's how it is that's real and you take you do one thing you better realize that your responsibility here in this church is more than you think it is even if you think you are just a Pew warmer you affect your atmosphere affects the people around you the things that you say and do affect everybody around you the attitudes that you have the way you carry yourself oh you know it sound oh brother we're not focused on the flesh no but you better realize that these things manifest there's a reason see I I I I'm not GNA hold you much longer but I got I'm a guy I tend to wear my emotions on my sleeve I was telling a guy at work I said you know that's just who I am I got that from unfortunately I got that from my mom's side and my dad's side so I really didn't have a choice and I'm not a guy who can who can just act everything's cheery all the time some people have such a positive disposition about them that everything is always roses and gumdrops I'm not like that God didn't make me that way when I feel something it just comes out and I have to realize and I and I know I'm not perfect but at least I by the grace of God I know enough to know that my countenance can affect others because people can see it when you're down people can see it when you're happy even when you think you're a good actor people can see right through it especially if they're spiritual at all they got the Holy Ghost you think you're looking fine and dandy you think you got everybody fooled and then a brother comes brother you all right and you're like who told you you know but instead of being you know and I think I preached this last time but instead of being so defensed when it comes to brothers and sisters if we could learn to trust each other and really love each other other and if I could say things be more vulnerable with each other and be real with each other I really think we get somewhere because I think when it all boiled down when we got past all the facades when we got past all the fact you know because whether you may think I'm the most perfect guy in the world and I can guarantee you I'm not but from a distance you may think that but I guarantee you get to know me and you'll realize brother Ry ain't always cracked up to be in in himself he's not perfect he makes mistakes and see that's one of the Fatal flaws with the people of this message they think William brandom was his perfect individual but I guarantee you that's one of one of the things that confused the people was that when they hung around the man he was just a normal guy well I say normal in the fact that he was just a human not normal in the sense that he was a prophet and they were confused about it because this was a man that could get angry this is a man that could get sad just like Jesus Christ Jesus Christ could get angry brother that brother gab Smith pre that me message emotions of Christ that ought to hit right home and make you realize we're all this same boat when it comes down to it amen I hope this all right let's just bow in a word of prayer we're not trying to say anything to condemn you but you know I really believe God's got every single one of us here for a purpose and and you know I I'll just Echo brother Brooks there's nobody here that I wouldn't want to be here why why would I do that to try to take away from the body of Christ I wouldn't do it neither should any any of you let's not do that let's let's you know as that time comes draw together the more this circle ought to be tightening as these days come we see what's coming we're not blinded to iten let's just bow our heads in word of prayer Lord Jesus as we just come before you Lord after Lord we just preach such a maybe a hard sermon this evening father but Lord you know it it's just from my heart is what you just placed there by the grace of God lord you you put it there to be said father we don't want to condemn anybody May people necessarily feel bad but Lord as as our brother Paul once said he said I I don't regret that I made you to sorrow if it made you to sorrow into repentance and Lord God we we want to come to a place father where we can truly have that Godly sorrow that bringeth us to repentance Lord we want to get behind the the that carrier of the ball as we heard our Prophet say Lord we want to block for the one with the ball we want to get behind these ones Lord God that God has called to be out front and realize that we all have a purpose Lord Lord if Lord even looking in the natural if that football team Lord if if that that one person on the offensive line he may be this guy that nobody knows even knows his name but if he fails to do his job Lord the quarterback might get hurt because a man could hit him so hard and Lord how much more if it's even that in the natural is that in the spiritual Lord when we ought to Lord have one another's back where we ought to give a brother or sister the benefit of the doubt and not to run rush to judgment Lord but as the scripture said if we see someone in a fault and we know it's a fault to go to them in the spirit of meekness Lord but Lord even even then we ought to be praying for that individual Lord we ought to be loving that individual we ought to love each other father you said you said that little children love one another Lord and if we have that love of God in our hearts oh God I believe that your spirit could come and reign in this place so much that Lord Your shikina Glory itself would come down and fill this place I know it to be true father for your word says it's true Lord that they were all in the upper room Lord on the day of Pentecost in one Accord and your Holy Spirit came down like a rushing Mighty Wind Lord bring us to that place again soften out all those rough edges Lord bring us to that place of one accordance father where we can Lord come together Lord even if we don't have anything in common in the natural Lord at the very least Lord we're serving the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob we're serving you Jesus Christ the only true and living God Lord we we believe a message that is so precious in this hour father and Lord we see that that puts us into a into a company Lord that's so few help us to know oh God that that that's not in vain that that's not Lord just as a show lord it's not just something that we're just here to to show up and like to clock in and clock out of a job Lord but every day that we live our lives oh God we're living for you we're living for each other Lord because each one of us affects one another help us to come to a real revelation of that Lord Jesus Lord increase my revelation of it Lord increase each and every one of us revelation of it father I pray that you'd just bless your people Lord God if there's anything that was said that wasn't according to your will I pray you'd forgive me Lord and Lord God I pray that each one here would be blessed Lord we just also want to pray a special blessing on our brother Brooks Lord as he's traveling Lord may you just give him strength Lord may you give him virtue in his flesh Lord and his spirit and his soul lord that he would be able to preach the word with boldness where he is Lord and that he would Lord come back even though he maybe have preached many times Lord he'd still be able to come back refresh Lord Lord we know that you're the God of All Comfort I pray that you'd comfort him as he he's away from his family and friends but Lord he's with in the company of of friends in the faith oh God may you just be with him be with each and every one of us in like in like manner father as we depart from this place may we have a love for us so strong Lord as our Prophet said that they would come to that place where we would weep to toart from one another Lord people may call me oldfashioned Lord but I believe that's just the way it can be and the way it will be Lord we love you and we appreciate you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen if there's anybody that desires prayer we'll be more than happy to pray for you brother Isaac has a song go ahead and sing a song brother we we love you all we're not trying to preach anything to make people feel bad sometimes the devil will get up there and try he just trying to hit you right upside the the head this isn't about that I don't care where you came from or who you are we're all on the same team and that Devil's going to do everything he can to try and fracture and divide because he knows if he can divide he can conquer but if if we can realize that you know there's a binding going on we've heard of The Binding of the tears but there's a binding of the wheat and as that wheat's being bound what we we're drawing closer and closer and closer together amen and I believe that that that I believe that's for the people of God in this age thank you
