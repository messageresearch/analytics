[33:24] just trying to figure out things what's
[33:27] going on how things are going to work
[33:28] out
[33:29] then god just dropped this scripture
[33:31] into my heart
[33:32] says his word is a lamb
[33:36] and to our feet and the light onto our
[33:38] path
[33:40] so just looking at it many times we look
[33:42] at scriptures and we just peruse through
[33:44] but when i was looking at it it says
[33:46] here's a lamp
[33:47] onto our feet so when you're walking at
[33:50] night and you have a lamb you don't know
[33:51] where you're going
[33:53] but you trust the very next step that
[33:56] you have
[33:57] so when you have god you might not know
[34:00] where you're going but you
[34:01] trust him he is our lamb you know he's
[34:03] going to take us where we're going so
[34:06] that just gave me
[34:07] comfort that i don't have to worry about
[34:09] that i just have to let go
[34:11] and let him help his way amen

[48:11] god i hold that song
[48:14] i want to get you while you're still
[48:15] awake
[48:17] amen it's been a wonderful day for me
[48:21] and i hope the trust has been a
[48:22] wonderful day for you
[48:24] and then we appreciate our brother jude
[48:27] being here and his wife and how he even
[48:29] helped us
[48:30] as they helped us with the sound system
[48:34] amen so i appreciate him and continue to
[48:37] pray for him that god will give them a
[48:39] safe trip
[48:40] home
[48:44] he said that they really enjoyed the
[48:46] service today
[48:48] you know we we enjoyed being out there
[48:51] it was just
[48:52] i don't know how how it all happened but
[48:54] i appreciate the lord
[48:56] uh they went all the way to chicago to
[48:59] pick up a car and it's such a beautiful
[49:01] car
[49:02] then they wanted us to dedicate it and
[49:04] it was wonderful and
[49:07] i don't know he's just a special brother
[49:10] we've known for years and
[49:12] nothing has ever changed you know i mean
[49:14] in that sense he's just been genuine
[49:17] from day one
[49:21] yes he has reasons to be a proud man but
[49:23] he's not he's very humble
[49:26] and we appreciate him as we stand
[49:29] uh let's turn to psalm 16. i appreciate
[49:32] everybody
[49:33] being here tonight
[49:36] oh we'll let go and let god
[49:41] that was a wonderful song i hadn't heard
[49:43] that song in a while brother but
[49:45] i could i could hear it as you sang it
[49:47] it was and that's the thing that's
[49:49] i think that's been uh our major
[49:52] problems
[49:53] letting go and let god and it comes back
[49:56] to the will everything come back to the
[49:58] will
[50:00] um because you got to understand
[50:04] no matter how we may even say well the
[50:07] devil made me do it well we've gotten to
[50:09] a place where we must know we know now
[50:11] the devil didn't make you do nothing
[50:13] you gave a will you gave in and
[50:16] that's why we do what we do you allow
[50:19] the will and this is why
[50:20] jesus says father not my will but let
[50:23] thine be done
[50:24] and in all of that that's iniquity when
[50:27] you do it that way
[50:28] and he was bruised his stripes
[50:32] healed not only just our sin but our
[50:36] iniquities and
[50:38] how can you not love of god like this
[50:40] you know
[50:41] it's not like no other god he doesn't i
[50:43] ask you for anything
[50:46] other than your will he'll do the rest
[50:50] psalm 16 11.
[50:55] i just uh oh if i could just
[50:59] get it over to you people of god the way
[51:01] the lord is
[51:02] giving it to me i feel like i'm and i
[51:06] trust that uh
[51:08] god by his own way of giving us
[51:10] revelation and understanding and i don't
[51:12] say these things to
[51:13] say it as if i know something you don't
[51:15] know
[51:16] i just know that that the word in itself
[51:20] laying on the page you hear it but the
[51:22] revelation
[51:23] is so much deeper than what you're
[51:25] hearing it goes beyond
[51:28] the pages and uh it's hard to explain
[51:32] but i know that once god quickened
[51:34] things to us it
[51:36] it it it has nothing to do with your
[51:40] works
[51:41] it literally works in you once it's
[51:44] quickened to you
[51:46] it takes the job on and that's all i can
[51:48] say i don't know how else to say it
[51:50] psalms 16 beginning at the 11th verse
[51:56] thou will show me the path of life
[52:00] in thy presence is fullness of joy
[52:04] at that right hand there are pleasures
[52:06] forevermore
[52:10] i love that let us pray
[52:14] father we so thank you for your grace
[52:17] we thank you for the mercy your mercy
[52:19] your grace and
[52:20] all that you have done for us we love
[52:23] you in such a way
[52:25] but father we just don't love you enough
[52:28] we want to love you with everything we
[52:30] have
[52:32] our minds our bodies our soul
[52:35] we want to commit all that we possess
[52:39] into your hands that you will have total
[52:41] control
[52:43] of our minds our bodies and our souls
[52:46] lord we come here to do one thing
[52:49] and that is to prove that you are god
[52:52] and to glorify you
[52:55] in whatever condition we find ourselves
[52:57] in
[52:58] we want to be able to give you the
[53:00] praise glory and honor
[53:01] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[53:05] you may be seated
[53:11] as i was saying earlier this morning you
[53:13] know we they get things all mixed up and
[53:15] we get religion
[53:17] into our system and sometimes
[53:21] religion in itself can be such a
[53:24] deception
[53:26] because there are thousands of religions
[53:30] in the world and jesus christ
[53:34] plainly states that he is the way he's
[53:37] the only way
[53:39] the truth in the life and
[53:42] you know think about it if you
[53:45] had to find truth
[53:49] without truth quickening you
[53:52] most of us in our intellect wouldn't be
[53:55] capable
[53:57] of finding out what truth is i mean
[54:00] we've had
[54:01] some of the greatest philosophers
[54:03] theologians and
[54:05] psychiatrists and whatever more all
[54:08] kinds of
[54:09] science trying to
[54:12] prove or show us what truth is and
[54:15] the bible plainly states jesus christ
[54:19] is being the only truth with him being
[54:22] the only truth that means
[54:24] his word is the only truth
[54:27] um and understanding this word in itself
[54:31] can be read by millions of people
[54:34] and many millions of them can still walk
[54:37] out
[54:38] from reading it and never understanding
[54:41] anything
[54:42] it says because it's not given
[54:45] to millions as such because the bible
[54:49] said that
[54:50] jesus christ or god has hidden
[54:54] this from the wise and the prudent
[54:57] but he revealed it reveals it to babes
[55:01] and we're we're thankful that when it
[55:04] comes to life we
[55:06] don't have to cross the sea like
[55:09] i think his name was pastor leon i can't
[55:12] pronounce it correctly but
[55:14] i think he was looking for the fountain
[55:16] of youth
[55:18] he had the right idea he wanted to live
[55:21] he wanted to live forever but no doubt
[55:26] he had the remedy somewhere around
[55:29] by way of the holy scriptures and
[55:33] that was the only place he would have
[55:34] been able to find
[55:36] the fountain of youth even to this day
[55:39] we still got scientists trying to
[55:43] give you everlasting life
[55:46] you know if you take this pill or that
[55:48] pill you'll live longer you'll be
[55:50] healthier
[55:52] well that's not exactly what god says
[55:57] because life and death
[56:01] is held in the hands of almighty god
[56:04] you can be physically apt physically
[56:07] healthy
[56:08] and drop dead within a second
[56:12] you know i look at people and i've seen
[56:15] people who
[56:16] health-wise look like they should not
[56:18] even be living still
[56:21] and i've seen them outlive
[56:25] people who exercise
[56:28] and work out and these people could be
[56:31] in a horrible condition
[56:33] according to the eyes and yet they
[56:35] outlive the man who's trying to live
[56:40] you know even as solomon says it's all
[56:42] vanity
[56:44] no matter how you look at it it's all
[56:46] vanity it's just in our minds that we
[56:48] add a few years to our lives but
[56:51] understand your number is already
[56:53] numbered
[56:54] the day that you're going to die has
[56:57] already been
[56:58] determined by god no matter what you do
[57:01] trying to preserve it now i do believe
[57:03] that
[57:04] you know if you exercise and do a little
[57:06] something
[57:07] you know what i mean it might make you
[57:09] feel better
[57:12] it'll make you appreciate life uh better
[57:16] but it cannot give you
[57:20] a day longer than what god has already
[57:24] determined
[57:26] now i said all of that to get back to
[57:30] the path of life
[57:34] this message is the path
[57:38] it is the right way back to life
[57:41] and think about the thousands of
[57:43] christians
[57:44] who have stumbled along the way
[57:48] and have not yet found the path
[57:51] because the bible says broad is the way
[57:54] that leadeth to destruction
[57:56] and straight and narrow is the way that
[57:58] leadeth to eternal life and
[58:00] a few be that find it
[58:03] you know this is why we all always have
[58:06] at least
[58:07] joy in our hearts because we realize
[58:11] amen that the
[58:12] path of life has been given to us y'all
[58:15] hear me
[58:16] you didn't look for it it searched you
[58:19] out
[58:20] it found you and you and i ought to
[58:23] thank god for the quickening power
[58:27] however how else do you come to know who
[58:30] jesus
[58:31] is you can't come to know who jesus
[58:34] is by just reading this bible it
[58:38] must be quickened to you
[58:41] right think about the number of
[58:43] christians
[58:44] that still do not know that jesus christ
[58:49] is god
[58:52] it will amaze you yet they may be able
[58:56] to out quote this bible
[59:01] but just like the prophet god says
[59:04] i may not know
[59:08] everything in the book but i do know the
[59:11] author
[59:12] see that's what's more important than
[59:15] anything else
[59:16] christ in you the hope of glory
[59:21] now we're on a journey how many of y'all
[59:23] know that
[59:24] we're on a journey and how in what
[59:28] direction
[59:29] uh uh uh you are going in is the
[59:31] determine is determined by god
[59:33] and it's determined by the map that god
[59:36] has given you
[59:38] i don't think when he not began to walk
[59:40] with god he was just going any kind of
[59:42] way
[59:43] but there was a leading there was a an
[59:46] anointing there was a guiding
[59:49] there was an action amen that told him
[59:51] when he needed to turn
[59:52] left turn left or turn right or turn you
[59:54] know keep forward see
[59:56] god leads us that's how we lead animals
[1:00:01] and god will lead us amen into the path
[1:00:04] of righteousness for what
[1:00:05] his name sake sometimes we think god
[1:00:09] answer prayer because we pray it
[1:00:12] no god answer prayer for his name's sake
[1:00:16] he understands and knows what he's hit
[1:00:19] the path in which he takes you
[1:00:21] it's all about glorifying god not
[1:00:25] us and god answered his your
[1:00:28] prayers according to his will
[1:00:32] enoch with that perfect testimony think
[1:00:35] about it how many of y'all got a perfect
[1:00:37] one
[1:00:38] hallelujah let me tell you something i
[1:00:41] do
[1:00:43] and every christian does
[1:00:46] you you say a perfect testimony eh
[1:00:51] because wherever i failed it doesn't
[1:00:54] show up
[1:00:57] you understand me the bible said abraham
[1:01:01] staggered not at the promises of god
[1:01:03] amen
[1:01:04] but if you read the old testament
[1:01:08] and you look at the new testament
[1:01:10] something
[1:01:12] don't seem to add up but you see
[1:01:15] when the blood gets ahold of all your
[1:01:18] failures
[1:01:20] and all of your uh your wrongdoings
[1:01:24] the blood washes it away y'all
[1:01:27] understand me
[1:01:28] the only way we can have a perfect
[1:01:30] testimony like enoch
[1:01:32] is that because we stayed under the
[1:01:34] blood
[1:01:35] oh my god you know i thought by now you
[1:01:38] guys would be cheering
[1:01:43] because you got to realize amen it is a
[1:01:46] blood that washes away
[1:01:48] your sins think about how powerful the
[1:01:51] blood is
[1:01:53] the blood is so powerful
[1:01:56] it will sanctify your children
[1:02:01] job's children was caught in the act
[1:02:05] but because of job's testimony
[1:02:09] is that right the bible said job was
[1:02:12] perfect
[1:02:13] that's in heaven like the brother
[1:02:14] preached on earth he has some issues
[1:02:18] but in heaven because he had the blood
[1:02:20] sacrifice
[1:02:23] it cleansed and blocked his sin
[1:02:27] so much so that god says job was perfect
[1:02:32] y'all understand me job didn't have
[1:02:35] jesus christ as we have him
[1:02:37] hallelujah and job all he had was a
[1:02:40] blood sacrifice of an animal
[1:02:43] hallelujah but we just don't have i mean
[1:02:46] just a little lamb we don't have
[1:02:48] a little lamb like mary had glory to god
[1:02:52] we have the lamb the lamb of god is that
[1:02:56] right
[1:02:57] yes john didn't say behold a lamb
[1:03:00] he said behold the lamb that taketh away
[1:03:04] the sins of the world
[1:03:07] help us lord so we're in a time of
[1:03:11] manifestation
[1:03:12] i don't know about you i long
[1:03:16] to let christ be fully manifested in me
[1:03:21] i hate it when i allow the devil
[1:03:24] to manifest himself through me
[1:03:28] because i'm not of the devil hallelujah
[1:03:31] i
[1:03:31] am of the lord and i need his quickening
[1:03:35] power
[1:03:36] every day hallelujah
[1:03:39] i want him to what is this life without
[1:03:42] jesus y'all remember
[1:03:44] i remember don't want nothing to do with
[1:03:47] that
[1:03:49] yes sir like the psalm says if thou
[1:03:52] withdraw thy hands from me
[1:03:55] where else will i go oh help us jesus
[1:04:00] in the message it is the rising of the
[1:04:01] sun he said that same quickening power
[1:04:04] that we have right now see it will
[1:04:07] quicken your mortal body
[1:04:09] isn't that right it's the quickening
[1:04:11] power see what you understand what i'm
[1:04:13] saying
[1:04:13] he didn't say it was going to quicken
[1:04:15] your spirit it was going to quicken your
[1:04:17] mortal
[1:04:18] body amen and if it can quicken your
[1:04:22] mortal body and make it from mortal to
[1:04:24] immortality
[1:04:25] what can it do when you are being
[1:04:27] anointed by the devil
[1:04:30] you understand me the problem is we just
[1:04:33] don't call on the quicker now
[1:04:35] that's my word amen but we need to call
[1:04:39] on the name of jesus y'all hear what i'm
[1:04:41] saying
[1:04:42] because it's at the name of jesus demons
[1:04:45] tremble
[1:04:47] right you know brother branham said it
[1:04:48] like this he said the more you talk
[1:04:50] about jesus
[1:04:51] the closer he draws to you
[1:04:54] that's what he said and if we could
[1:04:56] learn
[1:04:57] and see what we that's why i read that
[1:04:59] quote about the man
[1:05:01] uh mountain transfiguration
[1:05:05] experience only glorify
[1:05:09] how do you glorify jesus
[1:05:12] by the fruits of your lips
[1:05:15] the bible said they overcame
[1:05:20] by the word of their what testimony
[1:05:24] and the blood of the lamb hallelujah
[1:05:28] you know and you must understand you
[1:05:31] can't have a testimony
[1:05:33] without having a test you got to be
[1:05:36] tried
[1:05:38] hallelujah but like i brought out esther
[1:05:42] in her most difficult time she
[1:05:45] put on the garment of praise
[1:05:48] hallelujah and this is what we must do
[1:05:50] when times get rough
[1:05:52] don't say oh lord war with me oh god how
[1:05:55] come this happening to me
[1:05:56] put on a comet of praise amen the devil
[1:06:00] don't understand that he confuses him
[1:06:02] when you glorified god in the midst of
[1:06:05] trouble
[1:06:06] he tried to get israel to do that
[1:06:09] he said put the music put the band in
[1:06:12] the front
[1:06:14] hallelujah and i'll go before you
[1:06:17] is that right he said confuse the devil
[1:06:20] with your worship and your praise and i
[1:06:23] will fight your battle
[1:06:25] amen that's the essence of that
[1:06:28] hallelujah remember i read this morning
[1:06:32] that in his presence even this evening
[1:06:34] in his presence
[1:06:35] is fullness of joy think about it in his
[1:06:38] presence his fullness of joy
[1:06:39] so when the joy is lacking it's evidence
[1:06:42] that you're not
[1:06:43] in his presence and that's where the
[1:06:47] devil fights us all the time
[1:06:49] to pull us out of the presence of god
[1:06:52] hallelujah
[1:06:53] is that right and the prophet god said
[1:06:55] he's a sensitive spirit he's a dove
[1:06:58] hallelujah the least little thing can
[1:07:01] grieve him
[1:07:02] so therefore we must be watchful unto
[1:07:04] prayer to keep that atmosphere going
[1:07:08] hallelujah help us all lord jesus we're
[1:07:11] here to magnify the lord
[1:07:14] hallelujah and like i said
[1:07:17] it ain't just it ain't even just worship
[1:07:19] and praise
[1:07:20] it's in the very life of christ the path
[1:07:23] of
[1:07:24] life the path to life
[1:07:27] is jesus christ the path of life is
[1:07:30] jesus christ
[1:07:31] the path to live life is jesus christ
[1:07:34] everything
[1:07:35] is jesus christ hallelujah
[1:07:38] listen when god in this last day
[1:07:42] came and you know we know this to be
[1:07:44] true
[1:07:46] each age had a measure of faith each age
[1:07:50] had a measure of god and they lived
[1:07:53] that measure of god that they were
[1:07:55] ordained to live
[1:07:57] and understand this age and people say
[1:07:59] well it's not an eighth a
[1:08:00] eighth day i mean a h a a eighth age
[1:08:05] call it what you want to let me say we
[1:08:07] know it's seven days okay
[1:08:09] seven ages but this is a mysterious age
[1:08:13] this is what we call the bride age now
[1:08:15] if the seventh
[1:08:16] age was ordained to bring forth
[1:08:19] brotherly kindness in which they did
[1:08:22] hallelujah and understand that brother
[1:08:25] branham
[1:08:25] amen when he came to the seventh age it
[1:08:28] was over
[1:08:29] basically over because every messenger
[1:08:32] comes at the end of the age now if that
[1:08:36] was
[1:08:36] basically over and the prophet of god
[1:08:39] has left
[1:08:40] he's gone we must figure out who is the
[1:08:44] head
[1:08:47] right and i'll bring you back to the
[1:08:49] scripture
[1:08:51] when eliezer introduced uh
[1:08:54] rebecca to isaac eliezer disappeared
[1:08:59] right because you got to understand she
[1:09:02] fell
[1:09:02] in love with elohees's message
[1:09:06] and eliezer's message was all about
[1:09:09] isaac
[1:09:10] so when she met isaac eliezer went off
[1:09:14] the scene
[1:09:15] and she went into the tent with isaac
[1:09:21] hallelujah so what are you bringing i'm
[1:09:24] bringing you to the understanding
[1:09:26] as it was in the garden of eden where
[1:09:29] god
[1:09:30] was the head
[1:09:33] he was a headship even though adam was a
[1:09:36] representation
[1:09:38] of who he was the truth of the whole
[1:09:40] matter is that god
[1:09:42] orchestrated everything even as he does
[1:09:46] now
[1:09:47] so where who is the head now
[1:09:50] this is why the capstone came down this
[1:09:53] is why they had
[1:09:54] the head came and showed seven things oh
[1:09:57] come on somebody
[1:09:58] it was a changing of the gods if i could
[1:10:00] say it like that
[1:10:01] there was a noun there was something
[1:10:03] changing from a
[1:10:04] from the from the layer of sin that's
[1:10:06] what the brother said well yeah we're
[1:10:08] still in the lair of the sea and i said
[1:10:09] maybe you
[1:10:10] are but i'm not in laodicea
[1:10:15] y'all hear what i'm saying i am not
[1:10:17] being affected by
[1:10:18] it why because the bible says come out
[1:10:21] of her
[1:10:22] you think god would just talk about
[1:10:23] coming out of the catholic church no
[1:10:26] come out of laodicea whether it be
[1:10:29] denomination organization
[1:10:31] non-denomination
[1:10:33] whatever it is come out of that lukewarm
[1:10:35] condition
[1:10:37] that condition amen that's being
[1:10:39] influenced by the fifth dimension come
[1:10:41] out of her
[1:10:42] and be not partakers of her sin is that
[1:10:45] right
[1:10:46] the bible said i would that you be hot
[1:10:49] or cold
[1:10:50] not lukewarm hot or cold
[1:10:54] germs abide in lukewarmness
[1:10:58] germs hallelujah y'all understand me
[1:11:03] hallelujah so you said what what are you
[1:11:06] saying
[1:11:06] look what so you can understand
[1:11:11] you know when esther dealt with uh king
[1:11:13] asura
[1:11:14] you must understand not only was he king
[1:11:17] but he was supreme judge
[1:11:20] you so in what way remember when essa
[1:11:23] went to the king and says
[1:11:24] can you change it can you change the
[1:11:27] order that
[1:11:28] that haman was responsible about the
[1:11:31] jews being killed
[1:11:33] and the king says no
[1:11:36] because the king's word was spoken
[1:11:41] it's settled it can't be retracted
[1:11:44] he is the supreme judge he is the only
[1:11:48] potentate
[1:11:49] your understanding and so what we must
[1:11:52] understand
[1:11:53] is that when god came and and it was it
[1:11:57] is a coming
[1:11:58] i i'm not saying that you know we won't
[1:12:00] see him but i'm saying
[1:12:01] it is a coming in which nobody
[1:12:03] understood was coming
[1:12:06] huh because it'd have to be a secret
[1:12:08] coming
[1:12:09] see but that was hidden on the seventh
[1:12:11] seal
[1:12:13] or the sixth year however you want to
[1:12:15] want to say it
[1:12:16] but you understand the the seventh seal
[1:12:19] could not be opened
[1:12:20] or none of the others could be open if
[1:12:22] it wasn't for the seventh seal
[1:12:26] see so we understand you say okay the
[1:12:28] seven seals were
[1:12:30] they open and and if they are that means
[1:12:33] there's something being revealed
[1:12:35] to a people that wasn't known
[1:12:38] throughout the seven church ages amen
[1:12:41] you can't preach the same message
[1:12:44] and say oh we the seventh seal is open
[1:12:47] and that's all you're preaching
[1:12:50] there have to be something deeper
[1:12:53] something more secretive than what we've
[1:12:56] learned
[1:12:57] through the pentecostal age
[1:13:00] and most of the things that we learned
[1:13:03] was creeds and dogmas
[1:13:07] so what are you saying brother brooks
[1:13:08] this message
[1:13:11] exposes all of the wrongdoings
[1:13:15] and establishes all of the right
[1:13:19] hallelujah why because god said i'm
[1:13:22] coming for a bride
[1:13:23] without spot wrinkle of blemish
[1:13:26] and while we were in the church ages we
[1:13:29] had plenty of wrinkles
[1:13:31] plenty of spots and plenty of blemishes
[1:13:34] because the world was being manhandled
[1:13:39] amen hallelujah
[1:13:42] but we're not in the age where we're
[1:13:44] under a manhandling
[1:13:47] age we have now come into
[1:13:51] the capstone we have met him
[1:13:54] amen amen
[1:13:58] hallelujah i feel good tonight i won't
[1:14:01] be much longer
[1:14:02] but but i want you to understand that
[1:14:05] this message is such a powerful thing
[1:14:07] but you see it's only powerful to them
[1:14:10] that believe
[1:14:12] i'm going back to faith because if you
[1:14:14] want don't allow your heart
[1:14:16] to get this thing to get into your heart
[1:14:20] amen you're going to miss it
[1:14:23] hallelujah because this is where god
[1:14:26] connects with you
[1:14:27] not in your head he connects with you in
[1:14:30] the holies of holies
[1:14:32] god sits in the holy place and that's
[1:14:35] in your heart
[1:14:38] that's where you become united not in
[1:14:41] your intellect
[1:14:42] in your heart hallelujah and you can be
[1:14:46] a
[1:14:46] dumb as a donor right you might not even
[1:14:49] know your abc's
[1:14:51] but when he comes in there
[1:14:54] he gives you an understanding a
[1:14:57] revelation
[1:14:58] that most of the doctors of divinity
[1:15:00] don't even know
[1:15:03] is that right that woman was that was at
[1:15:06] the well
[1:15:07] amen when jesus began to talk to her she
[1:15:10] was an ill-famed prostitute
[1:15:12] hallelujah i'm sure she wasn't as bad as
[1:15:14] the ones we got now
[1:15:16] but the bible says she had five husbands
[1:15:19] the one
[1:15:19] she was with wasn't her own right but
[1:15:22] one thing she
[1:15:23] knew she knew that there was a coming
[1:15:25] messiah
[1:15:27] and he would be a prophet
[1:15:31] yeah that was the mystery
[1:15:34] of this coming is that god will
[1:15:37] come as the son of man he will come as a
[1:15:40] prophet
[1:15:42] yet be god no don't say that brother
[1:15:45] brooks
[1:15:46] you see what well they said to jesus
[1:15:49] say how can you forgive sin only god can
[1:15:52] forgive sin
[1:15:54] but they didn't understand it it wasn't
[1:15:56] the man who was forgiving sin
[1:15:58] it was the god in the man they were so
[1:16:01] blind
[1:16:02] they couldn't see the coming of the lord
[1:16:05] right
[1:16:06] the whole time jesus walking on the face
[1:16:09] think about it people
[1:16:10] amen from birth all the way up to his
[1:16:13] death
[1:16:13] and the people were blinded the whole
[1:16:17] time they says he was born illegitimate
[1:16:20] the whole time there says hey could any
[1:16:22] good thing come out of nazareth
[1:16:24] hallelujah well they can look at you and
[1:16:26] say can any good thing be coming out of
[1:16:28] that
[1:16:30] but they don't understand this is that
[1:16:33] that was spoken by the prophet william
[1:16:35] branham
[1:16:36] not joe or william and we
[1:16:40] are the the the the very uh uh
[1:16:43] expression of malachi 4. the seeds have
[1:16:46] been sown
[1:16:48] this is harvest time this is manifesting
[1:16:51] time
[1:16:52] and there must be a people that is
[1:16:54] willing
[1:16:55] amen to manifest what how you're going
[1:16:58] to manifest
[1:16:59] what god wants you to do first of all
[1:17:02] you got to give up your will
[1:17:07] god can't work with your will
[1:17:10] and you can't work with god's will
[1:17:13] until you yield your will
[1:17:18] whenever god wants something from you
[1:17:20] like i said this morning
[1:17:23] you all right until he asks for your
[1:17:24] stuff
[1:17:28] whatever that may be you don't want to
[1:17:30] give it up
[1:17:31] and it's hard to depart with it
[1:17:36] i remember you've heard me say this too
[1:17:38] before when i was a
[1:17:39] uh uh a young married christian
[1:17:43] and my little kitties would come around
[1:17:45] you could ask to offer them
[1:17:47] you want a bite of the burger no that i
[1:17:49] don't want you you sure you don't want
[1:17:50] to bite no i don't
[1:17:51] and they will wait till you get to the
[1:17:54] last
[1:17:55] bite and everybody knows
[1:17:58] the last bite of the burger is the best
[1:18:02] i don't understand the psychology or
[1:18:04] what that is behind it
[1:18:06] but it was so difficult you're getting
[1:18:08] mad i when i had more you wanted some
[1:18:11] now you want my
[1:18:12] last bite y'all act like i'm crazy but
[1:18:15] that's the way i acted
[1:18:17] not my last bite then i i would make
[1:18:20] sure to get a bite but i would cover
[1:18:22] most of it
[1:18:23] go ahead and get a bite
[1:18:27] see that was my will but god don't
[1:18:30] handle us like that
[1:18:32] right he just think yes that's right
[1:18:34] brother he doesn't
[1:18:35] he just don't handle us that way if we
[1:18:38] ask of
[1:18:39] anything believing that we shall receive
[1:18:42] it it shall be ours
[1:18:45] to show you how humble god is show you
[1:18:49] how humble god is
[1:18:50] he took on the form of a man
[1:18:56] and mankind fallen the way it is is the
[1:18:59] worst of all creatures
[1:19:02] and he took on a man the image of a man
[1:19:06] and this god knelt down
[1:19:10] put an apron around him and washed his
[1:19:13] servant's
[1:19:14] feet and sometimes we don't see the
[1:19:17] humility that comes with that
[1:19:20] what a mighty god what was it he became
[1:19:24] the servant
[1:19:25] he allowed his will to be taken
[1:19:30] that he might do the father's will
[1:19:33] somebody help me here see in the message
[1:19:37] it is the rising of the sun brother i'm
[1:19:39] talking about the seven angels
[1:19:41] and i want to go back to that for for a
[1:19:43] moment and he said the very
[1:19:45] seven angels which represented the seven
[1:19:48] church ages
[1:19:49] all completed and we couldn't even
[1:19:53] see it they did they took the picture
[1:19:57] not
[1:19:57] us and there he is standing there
[1:20:01] supreme judge showing
[1:20:04] that he is alpha and omega the beginning
[1:20:08] and the
[1:20:08] end what identification quickening power
[1:20:13] did that to us right so he said well
[1:20:16] what do you mean
[1:20:17] those seven angels represented seven
[1:20:20] church ages completed
[1:20:24] the prophet of god could not have gone
[1:20:25] off the scene
[1:20:27] until it was completed
[1:20:30] see peter well he's coming back well i
[1:20:32] don't have that revelation like that yet
[1:20:34] if it is and how he's going to do it
[1:20:38] that's up to him
[1:20:40] but brother bannon said a man can't go
[1:20:41] off the scene until god is finished with
[1:20:44] him
[1:20:46] and the only two that i know that's
[1:20:47] going to return
[1:20:49] is moses and elijah that's the scripture
[1:20:53] but the whole point is if he completed
[1:20:56] it
[1:20:57] what about us
[1:21:01] are we supposed to look back like frogs
[1:21:04] no that's not the word no
[1:21:08] none of the church ages ever had to look
[1:21:10] back
[1:21:11] it was always on with christian soldier
[1:21:15] marching as to wall you see this is a
[1:21:18] mystery
[1:21:19] that the devil can't catch a hold of and
[1:21:22] the
[1:21:23] the mystery is christ in you
[1:21:26] the hope of glory you see he can't read
[1:21:29] you
[1:21:30] he can't understand you right you're too
[1:21:33] faulty when he looks at you that's all
[1:21:37] he can see
[1:21:38] but when god looks at you he sees
[1:21:40] perfection
[1:21:42] he sees a person an individual he can
[1:21:44] use at any time
[1:21:46] because he's already justified them and
[1:21:49] already has glorified them
[1:21:53] huh you're already glorified and you
[1:21:55] don't even know it some of us
[1:21:57] the bible says we're sitting in heavenly
[1:21:59] places in christ jesus
[1:22:02] i don't have to work and sweat
[1:22:05] that's part of the curse y'all hear me
[1:22:09] oh over there i don't have to work in
[1:22:12] scratch to get over there
[1:22:18] you know the bible says work out your
[1:22:19] own soul salvation
[1:22:21] and i've had that in the apostolic
[1:22:23] church and they mean they mean work too
[1:22:25] you got to work yes sir
[1:22:29] everything you got to do you got to work
[1:22:32] to get to heaven
[1:22:33] that ain't what he's saying
[1:22:35] understanding is what he's talking about
[1:22:38] understanding your own soul salvation
[1:22:41] that's the only work
[1:22:42] what work lord what work believe on him
[1:22:46] whom god has sent
[1:22:48] that's the only word god requires it
[1:22:51] goes back to
[1:22:52] faith right everybody that believed
[1:22:55] nor escaped the flood
[1:22:59] everybody that believed jesus escaped
[1:23:02] from titus
[1:23:04] right and everybody that believed this
[1:23:07] message listen
[1:23:08] listen it doesn't stop at the death of
[1:23:11] the prophet
[1:23:12] it continue on the message of jesus
[1:23:16] christ continues on
[1:23:18] why amen because remember when when when
[1:23:21] ella easily went off the scene with
[1:23:22] rebecca amen it didn't stop
[1:23:25] the only thing it changed to you
[1:23:29] was rebecca and isaac now the story has
[1:23:33] changed
[1:23:34] y'all understand me hallelujah
[1:23:37] oh glory to god if you can understand
[1:23:40] the relationship
[1:23:41] now is it is isaac and rebecca
[1:23:45] the scene changes it's their love affair
[1:23:49] and what goes on in their lives and you
[1:23:52] and i must understand
[1:23:54] that's what's happening now the scene
[1:23:56] has changed
[1:23:58] it's christ the bridegroom and his bride
[1:24:02] is now the setting of the stage
[1:24:05] their love affair their intimacy
[1:24:10] oh lord be glorified
[1:24:14] think about it you have a husband
[1:24:19] who is the supreme judge
[1:24:23] and he finds you not guilty
[1:24:29] the supreme judge have already judged
[1:24:31] you
[1:24:33] so much so he said you won't even go
[1:24:36] through the great tribulation
[1:24:40] huh he has judged you so much
[1:24:44] to when he see you he sees his own
[1:24:48] reflection
[1:24:49] you say oh i don't know about that well
[1:24:51] when you go through the fire
[1:24:53] that's what brings him to the surface
[1:24:58] yeah you know what i'm saying that's
[1:25:00] what brings him to the surface
[1:25:02] when you go through testing title is
[1:25:04] when you see jesus
[1:25:08] showing that he's alpha and omega the
[1:25:11] beginning and the end
[1:25:12] what identification quickening power did
[1:25:15] that
[1:25:15] to us how many times the devil
[1:25:20] would come to your mind and says you
[1:25:22] know what
[1:25:23] you've done this too many times that god
[1:25:27] doesn't seal your conscience
[1:25:29] he's such a liar whenever the devil
[1:25:32] tells you something like that you know
[1:25:33] you're still free
[1:25:35] he's a liar
[1:25:39] you say well what do you mean didn't not
[1:25:40] he tell brother branham that too
[1:25:42] he said you can't be saved you don't did
[1:25:43] too much sin brother battle said i don't
[1:25:46] believe that
[1:25:48] the devil approached him the same way
[1:25:50] that he approaches us
[1:25:52] he'll say oh you know you ain't got no
[1:25:53] holy ghost look how you know
[1:25:55] faulty you are hello you don't even know
[1:25:58] how faulty you are until you get the
[1:26:00] holy ghost
[1:26:05] power quickening power lets us see
[1:26:08] his coming do you think the whole world
[1:26:11] can see
[1:26:11] the coming of the lord not even people
[1:26:14] in this message
[1:26:15] they just think it's a cloud
[1:26:18] they just think it's just seven seven
[1:26:20] angels up there
[1:26:22] that's all do you think god do public
[1:26:24] stuff like
[1:26:25] it wasn't public it was only for the
[1:26:27] bride you know it might have been a
[1:26:29] sinner that took the picture but they
[1:26:30] had no idea what it was
[1:26:32] but there was a message behind that
[1:26:35] that was a message preparing the bride
[1:26:37] for rapture
[1:26:39] yeah i understand and what people look
[1:26:42] and says well if there was a message
[1:26:44] you know um preparing us for the rapture
[1:26:46] how much we
[1:26:47] we prepare well
[1:26:51] from this dimension you got to make sure
[1:26:53] you dress right
[1:26:54] from this dimension you got to make sure
[1:26:56] you don't go to the wrong places
[1:26:58] from this dimension you better make sure
[1:27:00] you keep the right company
[1:27:02] nonsense
[1:27:05] you ain't got to make sure nothing
[1:27:08] if you've got the dub nature you're not
[1:27:12] going to want to do anything
[1:27:14] it'll never be you well i can't go there
[1:27:17] listen like i heard somebody say
[1:27:20] if you tell somebody okay i am allowing
[1:27:24] you to do this
[1:27:25] i am allowing you to do that that means
[1:27:28] you are in control
[1:27:32] because you are allowing them you
[1:27:35] understand me
[1:27:37] that ain't the way god wants it that's
[1:27:40] not the way god have it has it
[1:27:42] you know whosoever will let him come
[1:27:48] god has never sent a man to hell
[1:27:52] not one time every man that has gone to
[1:27:55] hell have sent themselves there
[1:27:57] because they refused to surrender their
[1:27:59] will
[1:28:03] well you know how could this be a good
[1:28:05] god and he's sending people to hell god
[1:28:07] never sent nobody here
[1:28:10] he had a way and you made the choice
[1:28:16] that's the message you make the choice
[1:28:19] the prophet god said you have to fight
[1:28:21] your way to hell
[1:28:22] because god is not willing that any
[1:28:24] should perish
[1:28:29] it was a quickening power that snatched
[1:28:31] us
[1:28:33] from death and brought us to this life
[1:28:37] y'all know what i'm saying and then he
[1:28:39] comes along because we know y'all know i
[1:28:41] said
[1:28:42] you've heard me say this so many times
[1:28:44] if you don't
[1:28:45] if you do good i'll bless you if you do
[1:28:47] bad i'll
[1:28:49] curse you you know that's
[1:28:52] that's not our covenant
[1:28:55] yeah i believe your covenant your
[1:28:57] abrahamic covenant
[1:28:59] is unconditional i'm going to bless you
[1:29:03] regardless it's not my will that you
[1:29:06] failed but i know you will fail
[1:29:08] you understand me but in the course of
[1:29:10] all of that i'm still going to bless you
[1:29:13] he's got such a blessing on us he says
[1:29:16] touch
[1:29:16] not my anointed nor do my prophet any
[1:29:19] harm
[1:29:21] hallelujah he didn't say it was
[1:29:22] conditional that means even if your
[1:29:24] prophet is not
[1:29:25] in the right place he should be you
[1:29:28] better not touch him
[1:29:29] is that right saul was backslidden
[1:29:32] and david was about to do some harm he
[1:29:35] could have
[1:29:36] but david reminded himself this is an
[1:29:39] anointed man
[1:29:41] of god though he backbeat backslidden he
[1:29:44] had to confess
[1:29:45] saul you know i cut your garment and i
[1:29:47] could have killed you
[1:29:50] hmm don't ever think god
[1:29:54] forgets remember that crippled man
[1:29:58] that cursed david while he was going up
[1:30:00] the mountain and sped on him
[1:30:02] you know he didn't hit judgment didn't
[1:30:04] come right off
[1:30:06] hallelujah but when solomon came on the
[1:30:09] scene
[1:30:10] when there was a change in the gods
[1:30:13] david said don't you forget
[1:30:15] what he did to me
[1:30:19] hey sometimes people do us harm
[1:30:21] sometimes they do
[1:30:22] do us evil hello and it looks like god
[1:30:26] judgment is not coming but let me tell
[1:30:29] you
[1:30:30] god's judgment must come
[1:30:33] it has to and if you don't pray for them
[1:30:36] it'll be worse than you would imagine
[1:30:42] he said well it was my loved one god
[1:30:44] don't care about that
[1:30:48] y'all understand me you are he is
[1:30:52] right look what god did to brother
[1:30:55] brown's wife
[1:30:58] you boom you you come and raise the
[1:31:00] children
[1:31:01] oh touch not my anointing
[1:31:05] didn't even offend brother branham but
[1:31:07] he defended god
[1:31:12] god's smoter you understand me
[1:31:16] see when people mistreat you you must
[1:31:19] come on somebody
[1:31:20] god is teaching you how to forgive
[1:31:26] they purposely are placed there so that
[1:31:29] you can learn how
[1:31:30] to forgive in the midst of your pain
[1:31:37] not when the pain is over in the midst
[1:31:39] of your pain
[1:31:41] jesus father forgive them
[1:31:45] in the midst of his pain for they know
[1:31:47] not what they do
[1:31:49] is that right oh yes you said well that
[1:31:52] was
[1:31:52] jesus
[1:31:56] what about stephen can you imagine
[1:31:59] bricks and rocks and stones hitting your
[1:32:02] face your neck whatever
[1:32:04] and he says lord hold these not to their
[1:32:06] charge
[1:32:08] now that's quickening power
[1:32:11] that's the power of the holy ghost most
[1:32:14] of us would not have stood there and let
[1:32:15] him do it
[1:32:16] we'd have tried to charge the rocks
[1:32:19] but nevertheless he stood and he had so
[1:32:23] much
[1:32:23] god in him to god came on the scene
[1:32:25] remember
[1:32:27] he was being squeezed
[1:32:30] and while he was being squeezed heaven
[1:32:32] opened
[1:32:34] and he says i see the son standing on
[1:32:37] the right hand of god
[1:32:39] and to the ears of the the persecutors
[1:32:42] that was blasphemy
[1:32:45] and they ran and they gnashed upon him
[1:32:47] with their teeth
[1:32:49] can you imagine an intellectual group of
[1:32:52] people that's supposed to be
[1:32:54] the top of the line acting like animals
[1:32:58] but you know what in the midst of all of
[1:33:00] that
[1:33:01] he loved them all stephen did
[1:33:05] not go to sleep
[1:33:10] with one revengeful thought
[1:33:16] and when you place a revengeful thought
[1:33:18] in your mind
[1:33:19] that is not of god because the bride
[1:33:23] is a bride of forgiveness we're born
[1:33:26] under that father
[1:33:28] they don't know what they do we'll we're
[1:33:30] up higher
[1:33:31] we can see that's not my brother sister
[1:33:35] whatever
[1:33:36] that is the devil anointing them
[1:33:39] we're here they're there
[1:33:43] under the inspiration of the devil we
[1:33:45] can see a drunkard
[1:33:47] that that's the devil but what about
[1:33:48] when somebody really gets upset with you
[1:33:52] see he he is the one the seals will open
[1:33:56] to bring us to what to your head
[1:34:02] the seals will open to bring you to the
[1:34:04] capstone
[1:34:06] to pull you out of those that system of
[1:34:08] works and slavery
[1:34:10] coming out of denominations was like
[1:34:12] coming out of egypt
[1:34:15] you have no more slave drivers here
[1:34:17] that's why i try to tell people
[1:34:19] i'm not going to try to make you live
[1:34:21] right no
[1:34:22] i'm not going to scream at you and haul
[1:34:24] at you like you some child
[1:34:26] and say well you know this is what it
[1:34:28] said and you must do it
[1:34:30] no that's not the age we're living in
[1:34:34] whosoever will
[1:34:39] i was telling somebody if i says it
[1:34:44] softly
[1:34:47] just softly
[1:34:50] thou shall not commit adultery and if i
[1:34:54] said
[1:34:54] thou shalt not commit adultery what's
[1:34:57] the difference
[1:34:59] your words of shouting will not make a
[1:35:02] person
[1:35:02] change it takes the quickening power
[1:35:07] it takes the holy ghost riding on those
[1:35:10] words
[1:35:11] to enter into a man or woman's heart
[1:35:16] you see what i'm saying see what i'm
[1:35:19] trying to say too
[1:35:20] we're not in the age of manhandling
[1:35:24] you know the pastor has no business man
[1:35:26] handling
[1:35:27] someone else's wife and this
[1:35:30] wife belongs to jesus
[1:35:34] y'all understand me this wife belongs to
[1:35:37] jesus
[1:35:38] you can't manhandle her hallelujah
[1:35:41] this is a free of freedom here her head
[1:35:44] is christ
[1:35:45] this is why john says when the
[1:35:48] bridegroom come
[1:35:49] i've got to move out the way it's no
[1:35:51] longer
[1:35:52] my my business anymore i must move and
[1:35:55] i'm rejoicing
[1:35:56] to see him come behold the lamb that
[1:35:58] takes away the sins of the world
[1:36:00] and john moved out the way and once amen
[1:36:04] jesus christ was revealed amen by way of
[1:36:07] the seventh seal
[1:36:08] john the anointed elijah had to move out
[1:36:11] the way
[1:36:12] because now the bride and the bridegroom
[1:36:16] he's come together
[1:36:22] what is it the opening of the seals then
[1:36:26] it's revealing christ
[1:36:30] and the very seven angels which
[1:36:32] represented the seven church ages
[1:36:34] are completed and we couldn't even see
[1:36:37] it
[1:36:38] they did they took the picture
[1:36:41] not us and there he is standing there
[1:36:45] supreme judge showing that he's the
[1:36:47] alpha and the omega
[1:36:49] the beginning and the end what
[1:36:51] identification
[1:36:53] quickening power did that to us
[1:36:57] is that right you say brother branham
[1:36:59] didn't identify yes he did
[1:37:01] he said that's my lord
[1:37:05] and it's blasphemy for the people to
[1:37:08] speak evil of that
[1:37:10] and said it was caused by some kind of
[1:37:12] airplane
[1:37:15] those kind of things will not be
[1:37:16] forgiven
[1:37:18] y'all understand me quickening powers
[1:37:22] lets us see his coming how we would have
[1:37:25] seen his coming
[1:37:26] how would we have known it was time for
[1:37:29] the rapture
[1:37:32] had he not done something different
[1:37:35] he had to do something different
[1:37:42] fear not little flock i'm almost done
[1:37:44] but it's your father's good pleasure to
[1:37:46] give you the kingdom
[1:37:49] it's your father good pleasure to give
[1:37:51] you the kingdom
[1:37:53] and like i said for where your treasure
[1:37:55] is there will your heart be also
[1:37:58] is that right oh it's nothing but the
[1:38:01] truth
[1:38:02] you and i must understand that we're
[1:38:04] living in the last days
[1:38:06] this is the thing that always gets me
[1:38:07] there's one scripture according to saint
[1:38:09] john 14
[1:38:10] 20 i'm almost done he said at that day
[1:38:14] you shall know that i am in
[1:38:17] my father ye and me and i
[1:38:21] in you now what message has ever given
[1:38:24] us that idea
[1:38:27] right what man of god
[1:38:30] was able to go into the mind of god and
[1:38:33] make this scripture live
[1:38:36] it was william brown you know what i'm
[1:38:38] saying i'm not glorifying him but i'm
[1:38:40] trying to tell you
[1:38:41] he was a messenger that god
[1:38:45] sent to the bride of jesus christ so she
[1:38:48] could understand
[1:38:49] who she was courting
[1:38:53] huh and he comes along and unfolds to us
[1:38:56] because
[1:38:56] listen denominations always give you
[1:38:58] hope
[1:39:00] well i hope you're saved you know what
[1:39:03] can i do to be saved
[1:39:05] making it all laws and rules and
[1:39:07] regulations what can i do
[1:39:08] you can't do nothing because the bible
[1:39:11] says
[1:39:12] amen no man was worthy
[1:39:15] to loose the seal
[1:39:19] no man was worthy
[1:39:24] no man not paul not
[1:39:27] peter not james not john
[1:39:30] not moses not abraham no
[1:39:33] man not even enoch
[1:39:37] was able to take the book
[1:39:40] and lose the seals there was only one
[1:39:43] perfect man
[1:39:45] and that man is christ jesus and what
[1:39:48] makes us perfect
[1:39:49] is us being in him now when did you
[1:39:53] become
[1:39:54] a part of him before the foundation of
[1:39:58] the world
[1:39:59] before he even came to be word
[1:40:03] you were in him y'all understand me
[1:40:06] before he condescended to what we call
[1:40:09] the word he was just elohim the
[1:40:12] self-existing one
[1:40:14] we were in him as attributes
[1:40:18] and one thing about god's attributes
[1:40:21] they cannot
[1:40:22] fail nor fall away it's real
[1:40:26] and the attribute in which he had us in
[1:40:28] his mind
[1:40:29] as being children
[1:40:32] his children see what one thing i'm
[1:40:36] gonna tell you something
[1:40:37] listen people of god the devil make you
[1:40:39] think sometimes you
[1:40:40] got nothing going but as long as you're
[1:40:43] hungering for more god
[1:40:44] there's more god for you one of the
[1:40:48] greatest things you could ever have
[1:40:49] going on in you is now
[1:40:51] hunger a hunger to be made perfect
[1:40:54] a hunger to do righteous a hunger to be
[1:40:57] holy
[1:40:58] that's god there's something living in
[1:41:02] you
[1:41:02] pulling it and if there's a deep call to
[1:41:05] the deep
[1:41:06] there's one to respond don't you feel
[1:41:08] little flock
[1:41:09] it is your father's good pleasure to
[1:41:12] give you the kingdom you just wait
[1:41:14] you just trust him with all your heart
[1:41:16] lean not to your understanding and he
[1:41:18] will direct your path
[1:41:20] um oh have mercy on us you know it's
[1:41:23] just
[1:41:24] you know sometimes we think we know the
[1:41:25] ways of the lord and and god will use us
[1:41:28] you know take us through a jonah
[1:41:30] experience
[1:41:32] and jonah just thought he was just
[1:41:33] getting away you know
[1:41:35] he didn't want to do what god wanted him
[1:41:37] to do he says god said okay
[1:41:38] i got something you said god didn't know
[1:41:40] what he was going to do yes he did
[1:41:43] because before jonah got there the whale
[1:41:44] was already prepared
[1:41:48] oh we're already waiting on him with
[1:41:51] instructions
[1:41:55] and the boat was already there god knew
[1:41:58] he was going to take a ship to go into
[1:41:59] nineveh
[1:42:01] wherever they were going i don't know
[1:42:02] shortcut long cut
[1:42:04] either way god had a purpose brother bam
[1:42:07] said he was not backslidden
[1:42:10] so what was it he was being led how did
[1:42:12] jonah know
[1:42:14] to tell those people throw me overboard
[1:42:18] and the winds and the sea will cease how
[1:42:20] did he know
[1:42:24] and they obeyed his word and the wind
[1:42:26] and the cc's
[1:42:29] and the well or whatever you want to
[1:42:32] call it
[1:42:33] that god prepared was waiting
[1:42:36] now watch this anytime you eat something
[1:42:40] your digestive system kicks in
[1:42:44] whatever kind of whale those ears
[1:42:46] couldn't touch jonah
[1:42:49] couldn't sense him the acid and whatever
[1:42:52] else that was in this belly of his whale
[1:42:54] couldn't touch him didn't blind him
[1:42:58] god gave him some kind of oxygen tank
[1:43:00] down there
[1:43:02] however god did it he got up
[1:43:05] out of that whale's belly you understand
[1:43:08] me
[1:43:09] he wasn't weak and tired he came out
[1:43:12] with
[1:43:12] fire preaching to the ninevites
[1:43:16] you understand me so what i'm trying to
[1:43:18] tell you is that whatever condition god
[1:43:20] put you in when he brings you out you're
[1:43:22] better than what you went into
[1:43:24] hallelujah lord of god are hungering to
[1:43:27] see him in you
[1:43:28] that's all i'm talking about i have a
[1:43:30] hungering to see him totally you know
[1:43:33] i don't care about me i really don't
[1:43:37] care about me
[1:43:39] see there's something in you hungering
[1:43:42] and moving
[1:43:43] like it was jacob see you wrestle with
[1:43:46] the lord you walk
[1:43:47] different after that something is
[1:43:49] different in you
[1:43:50] and you have changed he says now it has
[1:43:54] for it can be done it has to be inspired
[1:43:57] to you
[1:43:58] i don't care i couldn't stand here and
[1:44:00] preach till i got
[1:44:02] uh what hair i got left fell out till my
[1:44:05] shoulder stoop down and i was 90 years
[1:44:08] old
[1:44:09] and you listen every day until god
[1:44:12] quickens that to you you're still in the
[1:44:15] same
[1:44:16] shape y'all know that's real how many
[1:44:20] times we've come to church
[1:44:23] and we leave the same way we came in
[1:44:27] you know why because sometimes we think
[1:44:29] we're quickened because our mind catches
[1:44:31] it
[1:44:33] ahead but that ain't where god is aimed
[1:44:36] he's aiming at the heart until god can
[1:44:39] quicken his word in your heart
[1:44:42] you say what do you mean because the
[1:44:43] bible said out of the heart flows the
[1:44:45] issues of life
[1:44:47] that's where life is whatever you're
[1:44:49] thinking in your heart is what you're
[1:44:50] going to do
[1:44:51] not in your head so you you need to come
[1:44:54] here and says lord feed me here
[1:44:57] break the bread that in this place
[1:45:00] it becomes life
[1:45:03] hallelujah he said two days he said i've
[1:45:06] been studying and praying on this sea
[1:45:08] and i said lord should i say that to the
[1:45:11] church
[1:45:12] something said say it the hour is at
[1:45:16] hand
[1:45:18] saying i feel he's pulling me away
[1:45:21] pretty soon so
[1:45:22] i want you to know it now you say why he
[1:45:25] said the time is coming
[1:45:26] coming to come it's at hand brother you
[1:45:29] see
[1:45:29] you got on this is 1960 so he leaves in
[1:45:32] 65
[1:45:33] and so god is trying to get over to the
[1:45:35] people that
[1:45:36] you've got to come up higher that's why
[1:45:40] people come into church so carna minded
[1:45:42] and they expect to receive of god and
[1:45:44] god
[1:45:45] that ain't happening you don't you come
[1:45:48] in that's why you come in here in prayer
[1:45:50] supposedly a half hour so you can empty
[1:45:52] out and get
[1:45:53] climb up into god into a higher level
[1:45:56] so that when god speaks you'll catch it
[1:46:00] you'll receive it but when you're carnal
[1:46:02] you're going to wait and look for time
[1:46:04] to end
[1:46:07] that's the truth but if you come in here
[1:46:09] spiritual
[1:46:10] the least things say
[1:46:14] it will quicken your heart and get you
[1:46:17] out come
[1:46:17] have you coming out here singing and
[1:46:19] praising god
[1:46:22] see jesus doesn't change when he really
[1:46:25] speaks
[1:46:26] and the people are a little literally
[1:46:28] hungry and thirsty and they're
[1:46:29] spellbound by his preaching
[1:46:32] and like i said it ain't the screaming
[1:46:34] and the hauling
[1:46:35] you know we do that and maybe we've been
[1:46:37] influenced by hollywood a little bit
[1:46:39] but my point is once it's said and if
[1:46:42] you
[1:46:43] are bride and it catches you you'll
[1:46:46] never be the same
[1:46:48] why because jesus the bible said he
[1:46:50] didn't even lift his voice
[1:46:52] he wasn't a screamer he wasn't a hollow
[1:46:54] and you know what
[1:46:55] they left out and said you know we've
[1:46:56] never heard a man spake like this before
[1:47:02] where did you get your authority they
[1:47:04] knew something was different about the
[1:47:06] man
[1:47:06] not by the way he presented himself but
[1:47:09] but the words that came
[1:47:11] out of his my mouth was spirit and life
[1:47:17] something said say it now i was at hand
[1:47:20] say it
[1:47:21] i feel he's he'll be pulling me away
[1:47:24] pretty soon so
[1:47:25] i want you to know it no man can come to
[1:47:29] me
[1:47:29] said jesus except my father's draw him
[1:47:33] first oh i know you say
[1:47:36] uh i know you i i know you say you have
[1:47:40] god and abraham
[1:47:41] and to your father but i tell you this
[1:47:44] your
[1:47:44] your father's the devil said jesus
[1:47:47] religious men
[1:47:48] priests great men you are of the devil
[1:47:51] your father see
[1:47:54] huh and when you see a strong-handed
[1:47:57] preacher
[1:47:58] with an iron fist and you gonna wear
[1:48:01] this and you're gonna do it the way i
[1:48:03] say it
[1:48:04] and this is the way brother branham said
[1:48:06] it
[1:48:07] and all you're doing is making him a
[1:48:08] twofold child a hair
[1:48:15] because if god don't quicken it you just
[1:48:18] put those people in prison
[1:48:21] and that's why so many people hate the
[1:48:23] message
[1:48:25] they hate it we try to change
[1:48:28] their appearance without changing their
[1:48:31] nature
[1:48:34] the nature must be changed come on
[1:48:37] i'm guilty i've been guilty
[1:48:41] we made it on the wrong paul
[1:48:45] we fail to get them to christ
[1:48:49] you get them to christ you'll never hear
[1:48:51] dove complaining he's always
[1:48:53] cool and he's enjoying jesus
[1:49:01] we just do things wrong and instead of
[1:49:03] applying this is why
[1:49:04] why love is the only thing going to
[1:49:06] conquer this age
[1:49:07] it is so wicked now love is the only
[1:49:10] thing that's going to conquer anything
[1:49:13] right you remember that man that came on
[1:49:14] when his wife was treating somebody says
[1:49:16] come out of her satan
[1:49:20] don't forgive me for laughing i know
[1:49:22] that ain't funny
[1:49:25] brother the man brother i'm saying
[1:49:28] he called his wife satan and said it was
[1:49:30] on the verge of a divorce
[1:49:33] his brother said that ain't the way you
[1:49:35] do it
[1:49:37] you go get you some flowers of some sort
[1:49:41] yay yes or you call you
[1:49:44] something you call it uh whatever now
[1:49:47] you better throw it up cause she's
[1:49:48] coming
[1:49:51] you know people people are different now
[1:49:55] it takes wisdom
[1:50:01] oh jesus i used to be one of them
[1:50:06] them apostolics them pentecostals
[1:50:12] we call you a devil before you know it
[1:50:16] he was so right we were so self we were
[1:50:19] we were so right
[1:50:20] self righteous and everything else in my
[1:50:22] denomination we even put
[1:50:24] babies in hell yeah
[1:50:28] we if they die don't know jesus they're
[1:50:31] going to hell
[1:50:33] yeah yeah but you know people we didn't
[1:50:37] know scripture
[1:50:38] but we took that message of of that age
[1:50:41] and
[1:50:41] we beat people i mean we you think the
[1:50:43] trinitarians they people we beat them
[1:50:45] with that acts 238 we
[1:50:46] chop them up let me move on by the grace
[1:50:50] of god
[1:50:52] see we look at these things and we say
[1:50:54] well
[1:50:55] you know god
[1:50:59] he's beyond and i'm closing
[1:51:04] i just want you to understand that what
[1:51:06] we're looking for
[1:51:14] has happened in such a mighty way
[1:51:18] even though there's a greater part to it
[1:51:22] there will be a changing of the body
[1:51:27] the bible don't tell us how how how
[1:51:29] enoch was changed
[1:51:32] but brother branham said that's our type
[1:51:35] and the bible said enoch walked with god
[1:51:37] and was found not
[1:51:42] do you think brother branham when when
[1:51:44] when he was in that storm and he heard a
[1:51:46] voice says
[1:51:47] can i walk with you
[1:51:51] i fell flat in the in in the ice
[1:51:56] you understand me here was god asking a
[1:52:00] man
[1:52:02] can i walk with you now come on somebody
[1:52:06] humility humbleness sweetness
[1:52:10] hey i don't god
[1:52:14] asking man
[1:52:18] oh lord have mercy y'all hear what i'm
[1:52:21] saying
[1:52:23] a man born of sin
[1:52:27] huh and god so
[1:52:30] loved him and admired him that god
[1:52:33] humbled himself
[1:52:35] and asked him may i walk with you
[1:52:44] ah my
[1:52:47] there had to be some love affair going
[1:52:49] on in there
[1:52:51] there was a uniting of a union of some
[1:52:53] sort going there
[1:52:55] let me read this one quote so and i'm
[1:52:57] gonna close here i'm not done with this
[1:52:59] message
[1:53:00] i'm trying to i'm gonna keep driving
[1:53:02] this thing until
[1:53:03] by god's grace we can see you know
[1:53:06] hopefully god will quicken these things
[1:53:07] and
[1:53:08] and give y'all understanding what i'm
[1:53:10] trying to
[1:53:12] preach i remember one time in lima
[1:53:15] ohio i was working with the pyramid and
[1:53:18] typing it out and this and that
[1:53:20] and showing this net i hadn't spent over
[1:53:23] a month and a half seemed like
[1:53:25] trying to get the people to see what i
[1:53:27] was talking about
[1:53:28] and randy burton came and taught it
[1:53:33] in one night
[1:53:38] and one of the deacons says is that what
[1:53:39] you was trying to get us to see
[1:53:42] i'm like yeah it's gifts
[1:53:45] gifts some people know how to word
[1:53:48] things and
[1:53:49] bring it just so accurate but i'm gonna
[1:53:51] tell you the secret
[1:53:53] of perfection is denying
[1:53:56] yourself
[1:54:00] denying yourself to obey god's will
[1:54:06] but here amen coming from the first seal
[1:54:08] and i'm closing on this
[1:54:10] there's other things i can over uh
[1:54:11] scripture
[1:54:13] because according to revelation 3 21 it
[1:54:15] says to him that overcometh will i grant
[1:54:17] to sit with me in my throne even as i
[1:54:19] also overcame
[1:54:21] and am set down with my father in his
[1:54:23] throne
[1:54:26] and i always ask the question do you
[1:54:29] really believe that there's a big
[1:54:30] chair up there what chair can
[1:54:35] set god or god can sit in
[1:54:39] you know what he was working with the
[1:54:42] very
[1:54:43] reality of the holies of holies
[1:54:46] he sat down when he says this is my
[1:54:49] beloved son
[1:54:51] and whom i well pleased to dwell in you
[1:54:54] said dad brother brother brother well
[1:54:57] how can you be the temple of god
[1:55:01] and the bible says don't you know that
[1:55:02] your body is the temple of god
[1:55:06] and the temple of god was built with
[1:55:09] three
[1:55:10] courts out of court in accord
[1:55:13] in the holies of holies and those
[1:55:16] cherubims that with the swept back wings
[1:55:19] that
[1:55:20] guarded the table of stone
[1:55:23] and the mercer seat that was covered was
[1:55:27] with god covered the law by his blood
[1:55:29] and that blood typed out of
[1:55:31] the grace of god because once the blood
[1:55:34] is taken off the mercy seat is
[1:55:36] outright judgment and see god comes in
[1:55:40] and he sets
[1:55:41] on the throne of your heart oh i'm gonna
[1:55:43] read it and just
[1:55:44] say oh the kingdom of god what is the
[1:55:47] kingdom of god
[1:55:49] and jesus explained it remember as the
[1:55:51] wind it comes
[1:55:52] and it goes no man know where it comes
[1:55:54] from and nowhere it goes no man knows
[1:55:56] where it goes
[1:55:58] but you got to understand that the
[1:56:00] kingdom of god is come
[1:56:03] and the king is here
[1:56:06] and he's in your heart listen if
[1:56:09] but he said if my kingdom was of this
[1:56:12] world
[1:56:13] then my subjects would fight my kingdom
[1:56:16] is above but he said when you pray
[1:56:19] pray thy kingdom come thy will be done
[1:56:24] in earth here like it is in heaven
[1:56:30] right so if let me put it this way
[1:56:34] if there is a chair then it is a replica
[1:56:38] of what the real thing is
[1:56:41] it is something symbol uh symbolic
[1:56:44] of what is really here
[1:56:48] he said left he said listen
[1:56:52] thy kingdom come now will be done on
[1:56:53] earth as it is in heaven amen
[1:56:56] how glorious this great thing
[1:56:59] left the father's throne to take his own
[1:57:02] throne
[1:57:03] he now has come forth from the
[1:57:05] intercessory work
[1:57:07] to claim his own throne
[1:57:11] well who is his throne
[1:57:15] he come to claim you
[1:57:18] you're his throne you are
[1:57:22] his resting place
[1:57:26] you don't believe he says
[1:57:29] his intercessory work to claim his own
[1:57:33] throne
[1:57:34] his redeemed subjects
[1:57:37] that's what he come forth from the
[1:57:40] throne to do
[1:57:41] it is then that the lion-like
[1:57:44] creature said to john come see
[1:57:48] watch
[1:57:51] so you say oh brother brooks
[1:57:54] like i said if you're not in your
[1:57:56] spiritual mind you won't catch it
[1:57:58] you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna
[1:57:59] catch it in the sense of your
[1:58:01] this but let me tell you something once
[1:58:04] it's here
[1:58:06] it destroys all
[1:58:09] of the works of the enemy
[1:58:12] all because whatever
[1:58:16] is a lie
[1:58:19] he's going to tell you
[1:58:22] he will make you even if you don't
[1:58:26] understand it
[1:58:28] you understand me he is the temple god
[1:58:33] you underst
[1:58:34] you say well oh brother you say i'm
[1:58:37] trying to tell us
[1:58:38] this is why the devil don't want us with
[1:58:40] the holy ghost
[1:58:41] this is why he don't want the ceiling he
[1:58:43] don't want you to grow up into christ
[1:58:44] he wants you to remain children all the
[1:58:47] time and just rely on grace instead of
[1:58:50] election
[1:58:52] i'll say it again because we use grace
[1:58:56] in such a terrible way but because of
[1:58:59] grace
[1:59:01] we also feel condemned
[1:59:06] but what are you going to do with the
[1:59:08] scripture there is
[1:59:10] now no condemnation
[1:59:13] to those who are
[1:59:16] in christ
[1:59:21] why because they see that there's a
[1:59:22] greater
[1:59:24] you hear me it is amazing grace
[1:59:28] but election came before grace
[1:59:32] y'all understand what i'm saying god saw
[1:59:34] you
[1:59:35] in him grace wasn't needed in heaven
[1:59:43] grace is needed here
[1:59:48] when you get over there it's because
[1:59:50] election
[1:59:54] we say oh
[1:59:57] yes because grace showed us who we were
[2:00:02] grace took away the amnesia
[2:00:06] god unmerited grace unmerited favor
[2:00:10] because he knew who we were and jesus
[2:00:14] said
[2:00:15] he knows his sheep and his sheep knows
[2:00:18] him now let's stand
[2:00:22] and wake up
[2:00:29] god is so good to us and i apologize i
[2:00:31] said i want to stay long in here i do it
[2:00:33] all the way to five o'clock
[2:00:35] but by god's grace i just felt like i
[2:00:37] needed to say what i needed to say
[2:00:40] i don't know i just know with all my
[2:00:43] heart
[2:00:44] god is going to produce if i believe
[2:00:46] that
[2:00:47] that he's going to produce a real
[2:00:48] revival in this place
[2:00:52] and y'all understand what i mean by
[2:00:54] revival
[2:00:55] we're to get all of the trash out of our
[2:00:57] lives
[2:00:59] and every one of us is going to learn
[2:01:00] how to give over our will to the holy
[2:01:02] spirit
[2:01:04] i believe that and i believe that satan
[2:01:07] has fought this
[2:01:08] little assembly in his own way to try to
[2:01:10] keep us from getting where we need to go
[2:01:13] what he doesn't understand is that it's
[2:01:16] already ordained
[2:01:18] god has already ordained this
[2:01:21] i remember the first time that brother
[2:01:23] keith told me that i was going to be his
[2:01:24] pastor and i laughed
[2:01:26] five years later
[2:01:31] see what i'm saying it ain't about us
[2:01:34] you know what i'm saying nobody could
[2:01:36] have paid me to come here
[2:01:38] i didn't know nothing about iowa and i
[2:01:41] hope
[2:01:42] my precious brothers and sisters don't
[2:01:44] get offended i didn't even know people
[2:01:46] of color lived here
[2:01:50] i had never heard of black folks and
[2:01:54] [Music]
[2:01:55] in iowa and when i would tell people i'm
[2:01:58] i'm living tonight they say
[2:02:00] you mean to tell me we up there
[2:02:03] what you see because you know
[2:02:06] you know it's just ignorance you know
[2:02:08] it's just ignorance but we didn't know
[2:02:11] and when we first moved to ayah well my
[2:02:14] wife was almost we almost believed it
[2:02:16] was true
[2:02:18] we'll be walking and people was looking
[2:02:20] at me us like oh look at that
[2:02:27] is that right amen but the truth
[2:02:30] now now god is just bringing people in
[2:02:33] from everywhere
[2:02:35] but you know it's just god has a
[2:02:39] you got to understand when i left lima
[2:02:42] we had music everywhere
[2:02:44] people was almost fussing on those
[2:02:46] weekends like who's gonna play
[2:02:50] then i come to iowa and all we had was a
[2:02:52] a musician who was a
[2:02:54] tambourine player
[2:02:58] and we prayed and god brought these
[2:03:02] brothers
[2:03:04] and we're grateful
[2:03:07] grateful for the song leaders grateful
[2:03:09] for the so uh the musicians grateful
[2:03:12] for the technicians and all of everybody
[2:03:14] that's really you know the ministries
[2:03:16] we we appreciate every one of you but
[2:03:19] we're
[2:03:20] not going to stay here
[2:03:24] i believe god is going to give us
[2:03:26] something more than churchianity
[2:03:29] i'm praying for that i want everybody to
[2:03:31] pray that
[2:03:32] god will make this church
[2:03:37] an example not we're here not to glorify
[2:03:41] ourselves
[2:03:42] we're here to glorify him and that's
[2:03:44] what i'm saying
[2:03:45] that we will come to a place that jesus
[2:03:47] is always under our lips
[2:03:50] that we'll glorify god under pressure
[2:03:53] when we're not under pressure in the
[2:03:54] street at home on the job
[2:03:56] we'll glorify him we'll fulfill our
[2:03:59] ministries and all of us have ministries
[2:04:01] you know
[2:04:02] brother bob said everybody in the church
[2:04:04] has a ministry
[2:04:06] and we need to find out what that really
[2:04:08] is and let me tell you something if it's
[2:04:10] nothing but to glorify god and let
[2:04:12] people know that you're a christian
[2:04:14] because somebody is dying for love
[2:04:17] and dying for the truth
[2:04:21] i love this message with all my heart
[2:04:24] and the more i learn the more i'm
[2:04:26] enjoying it
[2:04:28] and i thank god for everything that he's
[2:04:30] revealed
[2:04:31] to me
