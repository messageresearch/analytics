Christ had to run back out from a mic surely God is good to us as we stand let us turn right away to revelations the nineteenth chapter revelations 19 and to have everybody here tonight will read the sixth and seventh verse of Revelations the nineteenth chapter and then from there we'll go to Ephesians the third chapter revelations 19 six seven and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready Ephesians three I mean if you want to yes you did a good fee just three and we're going to read from Ephesians that there chapter chapter we read the fourteenth in the nineteenth verse for this calls I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ you may turn that down a little bit of whom maybe it's this let me start over please for this cause I bow my knees and to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and in earth is named that he regret you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with the might with his might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and death and height and to know the love of God of Christ which passes knowledge that he might be filled with the fullness of God now unto him that is able to exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or to think according to the power that worketh in us unto Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without him let us pray father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us Lord you've been better to us and we've been to ourselves there is no words o God to express our gratitude Lord we just pray tonight that you would come down and minister unto your people we are needy people Lord we really stand in a great need that need is we need more of you Lord we need faith Lord that faith that was once delivered unto the Saints we need that for this exodus Lord that we're about to embrace help us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I had been working by God's grace on a few thoughts and as I was having lunch with my brother Richard a thought came to my heart and mind something he said because I didn't know what to really entitle this message but I like to entitle this message standing as the bride I hope and trust that God will give us understanding and what I'm about to say for these thoughts are not my thoughts but they are he is and in this message I hope and trust that God will give us understanding of who we really are that's very important I have heard many times and even myself have preached when the bride comes to recognize who she is well if you haven't recognized who you are as of yet you need some prayer you need to get before God because it's too late to not know who you are and we're getting ready to embrace a translation that God is by faith promised us and we know by God's grace that God never breaks a promise every word of the Lord is yay God always fulfill his promises and God always interprets his word we don't need to interpret it it's already interpreted sometimes we don't understand actually actually where we are but supposedly the word didn't know that he was the word but the prophet of God came came to tell us that Jesus Christ learned of who he was by way of the word that's how you come to know who you are by the Word of God if you don't read the words you'll never know who you are it is important that you read the word it's important in men that you search the Scriptures because the Bible says in them you think you have eternal life when this thought came to me as I said the scriptures were flowing and by God's grace I want to recoat something brother Branham said from the message hear ye him he said I want you to remember this and this is for the weakest Christian that there is in the building or in the world you don't have to have gifts you don't have to wait till some person come by it comes by who pray for the sick I'll I'll go on record because there's a tape recorder taping in here and I say this that the right mental attitude toward any divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can get the right mental attitude toward that divine promise and the Word of God will defeat the enemy any place anywhere at any time all the greatest power all the great power of God was in Christ he was God bother me God in Christ reconciling the world to himself but when he met Satan he never used any of his power when Satan met him he said now in other words like if you a miracle performer if you are son of God do a miracle here before me and turn these stones into bread but you realize that Jesus was not Satan's puppet it was not by Satan's demands a command that the word will move the word only moves by faith and you and I must understand that when Satan did what he did or tried to do Jesus didn't say boy don't you know who I am he just used the word get behind me Satan see you would not you Jesus would not have known that Satan twisted or covered a close quote cloaked the word is that right he he covered it up but he didn't quote the real scripture and if you don't know the real script and he had not known the real scripture he could have been deceived that's why it's important to know the revelation of the word is that all right now the Bible tells us that we're born about this bone in flesh of his flesh and as I was thinking I thought oh my isn't that wonderful how even in our marriage ceremonies the groomsmen wait for the bride but in our minds somehow we think that God is waiting on us but God can't move the groomer Guzman can't move until the bride presents herself she has already been chosen right all of the bridesmaids have been chosen everything everyone that's going to be partake of the partakers of this wedding are now presenting themselves but the beauty of the whole wedding is not the groomsman mister bride and she comes out and when she comes out the music begins to play everything in the room has changed from whatever worship it is or what's going on and they focus on the bride and how she comes in why because it has been a task I have a long it took her to prepare herself right it has been a task and understand a man that this whole ceremony is not about mr. Brooks is about the woman who's become whose bill who will become his wife and I love it the scripture says his wife hath made herself ready didn't say didn't say bride said wife and in this terminology you you and I know Amen that somewhere somehow there was an invisible union hallelujah between the male and the female hallelujah Amen is that right probably God tells us that when God impregnates us with the word Amen it seals up everything seals up so the devil can get in there God's bride will not bring forth two seeds she can only bring forth one seed and that seed is God is that right the Bible says let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to who him see because without him there would not be a wedding without him there will not be a marriage hallelujah for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready hallelujah now you and I must understand the Bible calls us written it Kissel's read of all men but it's more powerful than what your ears are hearing let me say it the way the Prophet said it in the unveiling of God he said as it is written or you are written epistles the Bible says now what is an epistle is a written word and you are the written word and you are written in other words you read it like this oh you read it like this it says you are written epistles or you are the word that has been written hallelujah see that's a difference it makes it clearer why because the grass may with us and the flowers fade away but the word of the Lord shall stand and if God has written you hallelujah you're in the book you are the book and you and I must understand nothing can fail you saw a Lord I'm making a lot of mistakes but understand the bride is written it's not that is she shall be written she's already in the book hallelujah and her life is being guarded by the things that have been written of her and when she is quickened because you understand Jesus was born the word but he was quickened hallelujah at the age of 33 the Holy Ghost came down at the age of 30 is that right and so you and I must understand you until then you're just the word you just a dead letter but when the Holy Ghost come you become a living epistle T when that Holy Ghost come it proves that you're in there and you're part of that word that was spoken before the foundation of the world I just did not come to exist I was always and so are you and you will always be as long as God lives you live what is your name the Bible says for this cause I bow my knees into the father of our Lord Jesus Christ I really caught that father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that it's written what is your name jesus says that I came in my father name so we realize the name of the father is the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says that the whole family is named the world don't understand you know more that they understand Malachi 4 because they don't understand that Malachi 4 was veiled he was just a vessel that bailed God well he blew the world's mine if I could say like that he confused them because they couldn't understand how a man who didn't know this man of that woman he meant all the women over here or whatever they couldn't understand how this man could discern the hearts now the Bible tells us that the word is only they only one that's capable of discerning the heart oh but they didn't understand it I mean they saw a man it confused him and instead of glorifying God they called him Beelzebub that's the truth the Bible said if Jesus said if they did it in the green tree they gonna do it in the dry everybody can't see this it was purposely veiled said God wouldn't do such a thing is that he did it in those day if everybody knew that Noah was the voice of God or Noah was the mercy of God it would have been a packed house more or less ship but they couldn't see God but no was the living word for his name that he regret you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man his spirit in you strengthens you that Christ may dwell in your heart oh my god I don't have to see him I know he's real hallelujah oh my that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth in the length and the death and the height don't you understand Paul is writing a Ephesians because he knows it's not impossible it's impossible it's impossible how you only comprehend what God is when you fully comprehend that he's no longer God you understand me what is Paul trying to tell you this is beyond you your model that part of you is model but that Holy Ghost is immortal hallelujah come on you said well listen even Jesus Christ when he was on earth did not even know when the rapture would take place but yet he was God don't feel rain though you don't know either but when he conquered all things hallelujah everything was put in his hands he knows now maybe even comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and death and height and to know the love of Christ with passes knowledge that he might be filled with excuse me that ye might be filled with all the food don't you understand what God is doing the mystery of this so-called Gentile bride it's beyond comprehension that's why the only thing you can do is have faith and believe it the mental attitude the right mental attitude toward God's Word is a man yes Lord hallelujah you don't have to understand it as a man tell me what scientists you know and this day can turn water into wine hallelujah but just by the movement of Christ amen it turned you understand me this is no logic in that it shows that even those kind of things can be changed every situation can be changed when faith is applied with the right attitude your attitude makes the difference if your god is if you're in your mind God is weak you would always be weak to you but if he's omnipotent you will always be omnipotent to you I love it unanimous understand what the scripture says herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world right your attitude your comprehension your faith will determine how much God you have in you nowadays because he's God he's the Almighty God hallelujah there's nothing here from him you know one thing for certain when you realize that God is in you there is no fear in love hallelujah when you fear you come in short hallelujah you're not made perfect yet it doesn't mean that God is not in you but you have a surrender the whole house yet but perfect love casts out fear once the Holy Ghost coming you he boosts the devil house he keeps fear and everything that comes with fear right on out the door hallelujah because fear hath torment no God ain't come to torment you he came to help give you life he came to give you joy that you may have it more abundantly that's the word oh my god I just love him but the Bible said we love him because what he first loved us hmmm I love this for if a man say I love God and hate of his brother he is a liar but he that loveth not his brother whom he have seen how can he love God whom he had not seen now I love that one could that give that punches everybody everybody hallelujah is that okay you know the Lord urghhh he did too so standing as a bride are you standing you know I'm standing as a bride as I stand on the promises of God hallelujah because I believe I don't care how long it takes perfection is mine and in his eyes I am perfected you are perfected who me justify he do he does he does he glorifies God's not going to glorify anything that's imperfect glorification comes from perfection hallelujah let's put it this way the Masters touch oh come on somebody there's no hiding place but one there is no acceptance of you except this one place there's only one place of acceptance remember Amen in Egypt when they were coming out there was only one place of acceptance and that was under the blood and that blood was the blood of a lamb Wow because that lamb died in your place when you should have died is that right the Bible says to the praise of the glory of His grace glory of His grace that means grace got glory you got to understand Amen that look at how messed up you and I are without God without God without the blood of the Lamb you and I are worthy of nothing but death every day we were we're worthy of death but the blood of Jesus Christ keep the holy God obey a beast I keep guard even from us only the blood well you said what brother branham was perfect well let me tell you how to only go stat showed that that was a little old woman in the juke joint restaurant or whatever it was she had purple hair too purple nails and all kinds of stuff with lewd clothes on brother branham said to God how could you let such stuff like that remain God said come here son I got I want a conference with you behind this door and what did brother random see not the woman scenes he saw his own sense going up to heaven hallelujah and he saw Christ being smitten every time one sin went up how do you understand me and the only thing that kept him was the blood the blood very old hallelujah let me tell you right now is the only thing that keeps you is a blood veil the Bible says to the praise of the glory of His grace when in he have made us accepted in the beloved he hath made us accepted with we didn't make ourselves you can't even give yourself the Holy Ghost even the Holy Ghost is bi-election another lujah in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace he is a glorious grace wherein he have abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence hmm listen God did not have to open your eyes your understanding we could have been as blind and really honest here but it was God's grace that has opened her eyes hallelujah - what having made known us the mystery of his will see God we look at these things God wasn't interested amen enables and imperfection he wanted them to fulfill his will because his will was the thing that were that he was accepting y'all better hear what I'm saying he knew that were sinners but God wanted his will to be done and his will was to sacrifice a bloody lamb not instead what I'm trying to say see you can't get to heaven on your wheel hallelujah it's not him that willeth know he that run it but is God that shows mercy so you must understand God knows you a sinner but he wants you and me to do his will his will you must understand his will is for you to recognize you our failure to begin with you were born a sinner hallelujah and the only way out of this is for you to apply the token you must accept the blood of Jesus Christ has your atonement and your way of escape and if you can do that to recognize that nothing you can do to save you religious people come a dime a dozen still maybe 50 now for dying but it doesn't matter cuz in this last days only a few be a few will amen make a rap show and is those people whose desire is to do the perfect will of God that right cuz the scripture says if you have a will to do God would count it done see if you have an honest will that's why I love the Lord because he can look beyond all of my faults go right into the heart of me and see what my earnest will hallelujah he knows hallelujah I desire to serve him with the perfect heart in spite of all my failures hallelujah he knows you that's what he looks for somebody not so weak he knows you weak mallalieu yuh that's why he says when I'm your weak he strong they had made a real real Christian no matter how weak he is he knows there's some strength in Jesus that in the dispensation of the fullness of time let me he says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in us he's the one that's getting pleasure right that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him and I love to say he said gather all things that are in church ha ha everything that's in Christ she is not you just be Christ being in you but you must be in Christ there's a union here hallelujah and the only hiding place is Christ who is the life of the blood right look what Ezekiel 111 5 says and the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me and said unto me speak thus said the Lord thus have you said o house of Israel for I know the things that come into your mind every one of them so don't think you can hide from God God knows every thought that comes in our mind that's why we supposed to fight them things that's why we supposed to gird up the Lord of my mind think about it God hears your thinking he knows that thought we imitate he knows the thought we fall - hallelujah hello and the Bible says as a man so is he you've got to change that thinking you've got to let God change your thinking because you don't tell me don't mean God doesn't know louia he knows every wicked thought you think and can't you yes what about said grieve not the Holy Spirit it doesn't mean you don't have the Holy Ghost but sometimes we just let thoughts fly right on through and we just have a party when but God is not pleased you love the Lord I'm enjoying this now I I stand as the bride but I recognize Amen he has made he he said the bride has made herself ready but listen we won't be able to get up being glory about nothing because we realize who made us ready he had to give us a substance to make ourselves ready hallelujah and the Bible said you have not because you ask not like that old colored man said I don't want no trouble at the river ha ha ha oh when I'm ready to cross over I don't want no trouble at the river John 3:16 y'all love that for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life how many of us really believe that do you really believe in Jesus that's what he said not one word can fall to the ground no I don't care about nobody's theology he said it for God son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saying she people get it all mixed up salvation and and they get the bride and mixed up they're gonna be linear folks say that is not right and I'm not gonna take this salvation away from them if they come up fullest version so be it at least they come up whatever my like the scripture said we wish we gotta be careful cuz Peter looked at that could mean them I said to the Lord you know I I'm not eating anything and clean up I've not touched it no I don't have nothing to do with the unclean things but look what Jesus said see that's what people on the dead they look at at Kamiya's and they don't understand canoes have been walking with God and praying for a long time he had already been sanctified you say oh I don't know about that listen the Bible tells me that Jesus said a man to Peter called nothing unclean that I have sanctified hallelujah and of God and could say to find him how you gonna call him unclean cannot do it mmm I'm enjoying this folks but God sent his son of the world to come for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is a condemnation that light has come into the world and Men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil and everyone that doeth evil hated the light and say dislike it he said hated it that's a continuation of hate neither come to the light lest the deeds should be reproved and that's the problem this there's no problem in the message but one thing about the message it reproved your error we thought if a man had gifts he was safe we thought if they jump if they shout if they spoke in tongues if they could quote the scriptures they were saying hallelujah but they didn't like our prophet the reason why I didn't like him because he was different than any other preacher what they didn't understand that behind him in the veil of this prophet was God himself hallelujah and God came to bring us light hallelujah and those who obey the light was just no longer read me pistols but they became the Living Word for their day hallelujah that's what God want he wont the Living Word manifestations of the word has been preached is what God is looking for and if that manifestation doesn't come on the sea it will declare that you are not because the anointing of God has come to anoint the word for this power to bring into a manifestation does that make clear but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God you know when you when you say something is raw in God that's working it like [Laughter] rock gold that's beating go oh there's a work with it amen God doesn't work with that individual God works it a man is it's okay the unveiling of God he said listen first Timothy 3:16 say without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God Elohim capital G OD in the Bible refers it back everybody it refers to the original it says L ahem in the beginning L him and Ella him without controversy is the mystery without controversy great is the mystery of Ella him oh yeah oh do you get it great is the mystery of ever him godly to do something he was a mystery to his angels hallelujah and all the prophets that came forth never understood who L he was they knew he was God but we are seeing something I'm folded in how they that no one else have seen hallelujah Israel whatever you look at this is her oh he was your hova but Israel name was never Jehovah but those who love the family of God his name after God and whatever his name is is our name whatever he is we are is that right the bow said whatever he is whatever he is we are in this world somebody I'm standing Amen as the Bride of Christ mmm well ahem was made flesh and we handed him Elohim veiled in human flesh the great Jehovah that covered all space-time and everywhere was made man we handled him L on him in the beginning L or him and L ahem was made flesh and dwelt among us what this is his way the part of the drama that's the way he he's to act it out his way of revealing himself to us at some different person we are model and we know that and we only understand as mortals we only know as models we only know as our senses will let us know and the rest of it we have to believe by faith we have to say there is a God whether we see him or not we believe it anyhow whether there is not is or not we believe still believe it because God said so like Abraham could not see the Sun no sign no pregnancy of a Sarah no eat not even a administration administration period of anything but yet God said so I hopes her womb was dead and his life and he'll was gone the stream of his life had dried up her life had dried up within her and yet he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was true giving praise knowing that God was able to perform anything he said he would do what are you saying relevance is likened unto us why do we allow our faults why do we allow our flesh our failures and handicaps of our flesh it meant to dictate to us when God said so y'all understand me if God said there be a bride there will be a bride if God has put it to you through the world under the preaching of the word and you able to class I'm bride you are bride hallelujah why because the word could only be quickened to those Louie he has predestinated it to be a quickened - this ain't no joke it is a real thing this is the reality of Malachi for you and I must understand this is a serious power that we're living in and what we were working with you and I got God don't have any kind of special treatment toward you unless you're walking in his word believing his word you understand me only the seat of God will escape this generation only the seat of God hope this understanding listen Matthew 27:51 54 beheld behold the veil of the temple was rent did you know oh let me hurry up the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and again came out of the graves at this resurrection went into the holy city and appeared unto many now when the Centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly a saying truly this was the son of God now listen what brother Brown say let me just see you got to understand when that veil was rent those Jews can look through the window like the prophet of God say and he's from that temple they saw Jesus hanging on the cross what was he doing unveiling himself that not some lamb behind the curtain it was being crucified they saw the naked word he unveiled himself and they still did not want to recognize who he was that's why the veil was red so that they could see who the real Lamb of God was that's why the denominational there must be raped robbed because it's not your organization or your you know your denomination that saves you it's still the lamb it's still the blood of Jesus he's the only one that can save you it's not because you group yourself with the message is what you coming cut who you come in contact with you must know him that's what Paul said I don't want to just be a churchgoer I want to know him in the power of his resurrection don't notice the very word that Jesus reported back to them but they come to see who he was he talking about the Greeks they come to see him we would see Jesus he was and they could not see him they see in the form but he was in his temple God was in his temple veiled in human flesh notice the words he said except the corn of wheat falls into the ground seat and dies it dies alone y'all understand what he's saying that he said unless I die I can't produce any more of my kind I was telling somebody the other day today on the phones and when I said don't you know that corner wheat must die you bury one corner wheat and it's going to come up with a stalk you know or whatever and I said if it's corn you're gonna have more than just one corn you gonna have several in corn and with that several ears of corn you will have multiple seeds that one seed produced that you plant those seeds and multiply it multiply it multiply by the same order that God gave him in the first atom the second atom had the same commandment replenish and multiply hallelujah not some human seed but your own seed can I say like that's God see here what couldn't they see Jesus he was mask God was mask the Great the greet one a God and here he was but they couldn't see him because of the veil think that's something and the Bible said he wasn't good to look at he wasn't some tall statute God with big muscles and you know there are shoulders and a little thin ways know the Bible said he wasn't even good to look at but nothing beautiful about Jesus hello it just messed him up well you see God shed a little wet foot I was a 49 and a 5-1 when her brother Brandon had high height was a little fella like that who had to look up the Billy Graham God you know what's his name um the Pentecostal brother or robbers and everything have you seen the picture he's the shortest thing on the picture but but people looked at I mean you know meek and humble you know they looking at in that debt that whole character blinded them but you see they couldn't understand how can people say bad things to him and then drop dead and he did that was God these things are on record it's not imagination it's a reality and what makes you believe this when millions of people won't have nothing to do with it wake up you are the Word of God and God wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost you will be that Living Word right they don't recognize us we're veiled we don't have our DVDs and LCDs and all of this education we're not lusting for all that stuff because we're satisfied I'm so sorry if the world want more out of me they won't get it my heart is fixing my mind is made up yeah all I want is Jesus I don't want nothing else it doesn't matter what work what cost what kind of price I must pay he's long at the end of the day I'm in his arms y'all look at me like you're gonna be in his arms now if those sisters ran up to brother branham and said my precious brother you don't think we're gonna get a chance to hug my Jesus I'm gonna hug my Jesus that's one of my rewards they couldn't see God because God was veiled to him now keep that on your mind God was veiled in a man they couldn't say no man can do these words except it be God that's what they said they could say that no man can do these things except they be God but they did not want to give him his proper position right no man can do it and how here stands a man and yet the worst of God is manifested through him see they couldn't understand God was veiled see that's how it is with us a lot of time that's all you laying hands on as you can recovery you is him be careful all of us must be careful that we don't get the glory for that it's always God is that ride in the olden days he said he was in them that's what he did he was but but now he lives his life through us in the prophecy step in a step out and step in a step out but now he's in US and Jesus said I'll never leave it nor forsake you that means I'm always with you if you want to stay in the Shekinah glory you can stay in the Shekinah glory it's your attitude toward every promise mmm lower to God you love the Lord amen Corinthians 3:16 through 17 says no you not ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you If any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is holy which temple ye are hallelujah so you gotta be careful if you having problems you gotta ask God for deliverance hallelujah cuz you know if you continue to do wicked things or bad things in the your the setting of your body you know disease and things gonna jump on you something gonna happen you're not going to get away with it free you know you paying a price he didn't say he was going to destroy you he said your temple your position what is your position do you have any idea what your position is you know we're not a part of this Christendom per se we're not part of some organization somewhere you can join this thing hmm you know God Jesus told Nicodemus you must be born again and those are right like I said you may hurt you heard me said many times you were born into this world you know you didn't bring it you didn't come in on a jet plane or some stock brought you you was literally birth into this world and in order for you to get in the world to come you have to be born into it it exists but that's the only way that you can get there psalms 82:6 2:7 says I have said Ye are gods and all you are the children of the Most High wait a minute that's psalms 82:6 through seven says that ye are God's little G I'm not all of him but I'm a part of Elohim I am a part of his attributes his thoughts hallelujah no come on somebody but he said even though you're little God's you should die like men and fall like one of the princess but death gonna get you hallelujah but don't you realize what eternal life is eternal life is just saying you are eternal is that right whereas the Prophet said Jesus God could not die so he had to make a body that could just to show you what he was feeling so that you can get a comprehension our understanding of His divine love for you there's death in God hallelujah but that's what he said if a man believe it on me he said he is passed from death I'm delaying believe what he is God see that that was a problem Amen with Lucifer he got to know got a notion that he was not the only God and Lucifer thought well maybe I could become one he did the god of this evil a hallelujah shade are we gonna tell you a kingdom down it is what it is yes we are tearing his kingdom down that's what's so important for us to witness folks so important so that God could show and display himself that somebody who's in prison might be able to believe and receive eternal life in about you and ain't about me is about him God in morph is that right whew what that mean God changes God changes his mass oh if people could just see it hallelujah you said well what do you mean let's say Adam he was Adam with male and female enemy and nobody knew it until it the veil was the seal was broken want to put it that way right and then how comes he who is a part of him her origin was Adam and Adams origin was God hallelujah oh come on somebody when Jesus Christ the word when God he created that body he put male and female hallelujah we are out of him Jesus and Jesus is out from God if you want to see it's only one guard person but in order for us to understand that he had to break it down like that because we're mortal mind you and I we don't know nothing about he existing without a maker but the maker existed without a maker listen he had always been God hallelujah y'all can hit me in the word if you like it is the word but that's how that they couldn't you can't get this straightened out and have three gods that's what I'm saying he said you would never sell a Jew dad I'll tell you that one who knows better he knows there's only one God I knew that when I was in the Baptist Church I couldn't explain it but I knew it and I knew Jesus Christ was God I didn't understand the Father part but I knew he was God hallelujah that's what God has done to this age it's been here and all these things have been here and it's supposed to be revealed in this age now the Bible says they will be revealed in the latter times it's like a sculptor keeping his piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it and there it is that's what the Bible has been it has been a work of God that's been covered up and it's seen it's been here since the foundation of the world and his 7th all mystery and God promising this day that at that age of this latest in church he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing being made in the likeness of Christ God's own image held him poured into you it's not like he vomited up no song he gave it to you he poured himself he placed himself into you got him awful mask in the pillar fire guard him awful in a man called Jesus goddamn awful in his church God above us God with us God in us the condescending of God who hallelujah we couldn't go there he had to come here hallelujah up holy no one could touch him he settled upon the mountain and even if the animals at just the mountain had to die and then God come down and changes tent come down and live with us become one of us and we we held him we the Bible said first Timothy 3:16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh handled with hands God eat meat God drink water God slept God cried he was one of us beautiful type in the Bible that's what God above were us God with us now is God in us the Holy Spirit not the third person the same person God came down and become flesh and died the death in Christ so that he could clean the church in order to get into it for fellowship God loves fellowship that's what he made the man at the first time for was for fellowship in that funny and that's where the devil try to do break our fellowship with God every day and that's what Calvary part of it was about a mentor is somebody just like the Bible tells it then the prophet of God said God Satan could never never destroy the relationship but he destroyed the fellowship he brought a breach amen into our fellowship into our union with God but thank God for Christ hallelujah he's the one that binded up the breach that we could have fellowship with him that's what he made the man at first time for was for worship fellowship God dwells alone with cherubims I'm trying to finish off see we must be the Living Word the Bible says yea yea ye are our epistle written in our hearts yay our epistles written in our hearts known and read of our men see for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ see the manifestation must be there right ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart right so the manifestation must be it is it has that token that is put up so you can see it the manifestation of the Word of God living today in you and me it must be a personal vindication it can't be because you you know you know you're in a group it must be you must have a personal vindication of God that you are of an epistle of God in this day you said what he said listen think by the living presence of the Living Christ by the Living Word all living Christ living presence Living Word watch by his own personal personal vindication proves his church not membership he never done it in that days of Moses he never done it in the days of anybody else at the end of the world and when it comes to the place where it was the destruction the days of lot it wasn't membership it was personal vindication God in fleshy personal vindication remember think of it that people born of his spirit in a day like this in the great denomination or age that we live and the Living God takes his living word and vindicates it personally this life that's in the word the germ that's in the seed and the word is a seed thatis or with off the soul and the life is Christ in the word personally in you vindicating something that you cannot do proven yourself that is not you but is him and you become a love slave to him to be a bride oh thanks be to the Living God who created the heavens and the earth and all that is in the midst no wonder he's an alpha and omega he's the beginning in the ending he was at first he was which is and all and shall come the root and offspring of David the bright and Morning Star he is all and in all y'all understand me hey that's what makes a difference that's why we're standing because God has got a personal vindication he put his signature on you hallelujah didn't leave you out there he personally vindicated this message to you now I'm almost done you love the Lord see you you and I must understand him God is still hiding from all unbelievers I mean even if he they unveiled himself they gonna believe it he can show it show them and say hey he come down say I am God ain't gonna believe it hmm ain't nothing in him to believe will see God here behind the veil Moses was very Moses veiled his face Moses was the Living Word veiled in the people saw that the pillar of fire said now we are satisfied she let Moses speak see don't let God speak lest we die Moses walked right into the pillar of fire see what they didn't understand they had rather man standing there with them right and in fact they fail to see that the same man that was standing with them wasn't preaching his own words he was preaching the same words that God told him he could not go - contrary to what the pillar fire told him to say Wow because what they did not see was that Moses was just a veil of the pillar of fire that same one that was rub the mountain hallelujah was now in a flash male right he said oh now I want to speak no more like this I give them a prophesy and that's the way he has always did it see now it's let them go up but this prophet has to have this word if you fail with a tradition God never sent him if he's veiled with the word God were vindicated God interpret his own word Moses spoke them listen how can a man say I'm gonna be over in this foreign country over there and Russia somewhere in him the little boy that's gonna get killed will be wearing a certain kind of cold I mean he's gonna be hit and he's gonna be dead and all this kind of stuff he said write it in the Flyleaf or your book cause it's gonna happen did it happen matter fact when he got there and saw the little boy in the streets he didn't even know who the boy was until the Holy Ghost quicken it like something was familiar but it couldn't put his mind listen people you gotta understand God was controlling the Prophet like God controls us I don't understand why people don't just get their own glory like that my prophet never glorified himself ever that's the word in your sealed book he said forget all about me did he say it he said it he said the wondering are worse things that you can do a man is take the tradition of it and live by it tradition is tradition we're free that's what makes denomination and organizations because they traditionalized things and then God moves on and you standing in your traditions is this okay but this prophet has to have his word and it is very with tradition God never sent him if he's veiled with the word God were vindicated God interprets his own word Moses spoke to him God and interpreted him right right the Lord said so and the Lord did just what he said that makes it right now he said now Moses you understand the people understand now see I have showed you I have indicated you God had veiled himself in a prophet so speak to speak to his word to his people Moses was the Living God to them yeah y'all better understand what I'm saying because at some point in time oh lord have mercy brother Adam said if they would have received this message America would not have knee not even an army why because they had a profit on the scene he's real we would have never we would have never lost about him so how do you know what's happening over here when they've got a prophet by the name of Elijah and he knows everything that y'all doing in secret i paraphrased things forgive me because maybe I say it not just right but the content of what I'm saying is right so you must understand by God's grace amen had this method listen when they put Jesus when they put brother branham out of the churches remember he said I moved to Arizona he said they know I'm here and I've been here so many years now and not one person has invited me to preach in their pulpit oh they thought they were putting this crazy prophet out oh they didn't understand they were fulfilling revelations 3 I stand at the door not King trying to get into your church because you have put me out what was it his way was to straight this way is a straight and narrow way they can't just do what you want to do and expect you go to heaven Aspray is narrow it straighter than anything you've got on the earth ah and it doesn't become a burden when you're born again when you got the right spirit of living holy it's hard it's hard to the man who's trying to do it by his own works but ask a sheep is it difficult for you to bring forth this wool the sheep don't manufacture wool it's part of it you understand me and when you truly born again the desires of the world you it doesn't mean you're not gonna have a battle in your face because your flesh is not converted that's why God gonna give you a new one y'all need me read that again again you know now Moses you understand that people understand now see I've showed you I have vindicated you God has failed himself in this prophet to speak his word to the people Moses was a living God to them the Living Word of God made manifest that's the reason his face is veiled hello and when brother Brandon was here amen the people saw him as God now they got confused because they didn't see the God behind brother Branham like the people did not see the God behind Moses but Moses had the Word of God hello that's why he could stand there when Nathan and Cora had done done all that wicked stuff he says who all is on the Lord saw he was the only one that could bring a separation because all the other people have been deceived that the God that they had just raised up denomination right because remember they were one people but when they would raise up that golden calf they deified their denomination and it took a prophet and said that's not God you worship Him huh he lied you had to do the same thing the word Bale means Lord because everyone has it Lord lot is that you gonna say one of these days you called me Lord Lord have not we done you didn't do nothing in the scripture Jesus saying you can't do nothing outside of me I'm almost done let me hurry so you can understand by the grace of God we understand how people can you know Paul said they they took him as God - you know Paul had to rebuke Ulysses now listen I'm so glad I didn't baptize none of you I'm baptized none of y'all on my name not nothin right right he said but then there was some of you who would have plucked your own eyes out for me you even saw me as being God that's yo scripture so the same thing that happened to brother our Paul happen to brother man and he was basically trying to get the people not to do that I'm just a veil here mmm not taking away from brother Branham I thank God because you know what that's what I try to tell people I say y'all don't understand self estas was in his hands brother Branham was one of them so where are your star [Laughter] he couldn't preach listen I may be corny but not verbatim with brother Graham said listen because he said about giving glorifying himself he said I couldn't glorify myself because he wouldn't let me you know he's saying he'd never try to get the glory he would never do that and besides that he wouldn't let me now the Lu you said what brother bands I'm sure I'm so tired I'm so tired I'm just gonna drink this I'm just going drinking it that that holy sweet oh you can't defy yourself where women are why Jesus when I used to hear people say that night what Jesus now I understand it well there we are and after you know the same listen God failed himself as Moses and it goes on and says and and God the Living Word of God made manifest that's the reason he his face is veiled see and do you know the same thing in a genuine Christian is veiled today to unbelievers they say see them women and with long hand things and say look at that old model women twist their hair up on the back say God flat tire spare tire up there see it's all Vail they're blind they say you know and that's what people say oh that ain't necessary it is Bob Taylor women won't make a rapture because you when a woman cuts her hair she refusing her headship that's the word and I said when you woman cuts her hair she might as well be bald in the sight of God I didn't say she wasn't saying but she won't make a rapture straight no such custom in the house of God that's what Paul says go throughout the scripture women we cut our hair you know who cut their hair bail worship person you say where you get that from jazzy kind of sound like Jay Z isn't it jazzy Jezebel hallelujah I don't care what you got you still ignore you still ignorant of the word you hear what he says see they're blind he said they say I got a PhD in L whatever I don't care what you got you still ignorant of the word is that good right oh that's just something minor take this fall lessons first oh yeah I'm at the end so you cannot know by God's grace it's just a 45 I got a couple minutes he said listen we're partakers of his glory well they'll say it saying now all that glory here is heed for us in Christ the word who is our temple oh now I'm going to have to dig down in a little bit excuse me for me my emotions this morning but see I want to give this out so long I just I'm binding up in me I'm a unity he says notice all the glory that is in God is in the word and all the blessings that is in God is in the word it's here to the unbeliever by tradition see what I mean but it's all in crime all that God was he emptied himself kenosis and came into Christ and we into Christ are behind the veil you understand me so he's saying all the glory of this book is in you it's yours is there anything to Harper died that's why people you know then they stage for Stage five I don't know stage seven if they got it who cares what the doctor says when God said with this stripe you healed God takes his time don't you can't rush guard you can wander like the kid mom with you you said you gonna have some pop card here how's the oh can I have some popcorn God that God don't pay no attention you're whining he's building character you know what my mom and you say you keep that whining up you know what's next for you you're gonna get a whuppin that's your natural parents garden gonna put up with that whining when he's trying to teach you how to be a god I don't know how else to express it but God wants his children to be just like him in every respect right oh he saw those people Peter come look look carried out not that we perish what how could he have ever said that fear made him do that how did you accuse God for not caring for you tell my patience and love and Jesus just there Dan said all ye of little faith about it you just accused God of not caring for you when it all he's done was care for you peridot not with Parrish and what's so bad about it Amen you got the tool you could have done it yourself but you want me to do it right I told you it meant that you and with me before the foundation of the world he told them that you're no stranger than me you always being with me I gave you the authority to cast out Devils don't you understand this storm is full of them cast the devil's out of the storm you say it's not true the Bible says Satan comes to steal kill and destroy whenever you see anything being destroyed that's of the devil and demons are behind it listen he said we're in him this is my last quote we're in him then we being in him we are still veiled to the religious and professors of the world see our glory that we have and enjoy we are still veiled to them outside us they think we're crazy a nut again that's right but we who are in here in Christ baptized into him on the first Corinthians 12 into him we are partakers of his glory see but not on the outside you're still looking in denying it see so now we are invited into him to be partakers of all that he is well we're invited into him which is here - the unbeliever by the veil of the human flesh see they know that glory they read of it it is the word here the glory of God and things like that and it's just word to them to us it's a manifestation see is not law is it is no more a word it's a reality huh he said God said let there be light that was the word but now there is light it ain't the word is the light whoa yo hit me that's what he's saying the bride has been spoken demon into existence hallelujah amen and she lost bare record of the word that's been spoken she becomes the light of that word T now it isn't just a written word to us it's a reality we are in him now we're rejoicing enjoying now we behold him now we see him the word manifesting himself is here out there because why it's veiled in human flesh that's why they can't see it oh Jesus Christ ain't the same today as he was yesterday yes he is oh all that he is we are invited to be part of that all that here tell me something that God is not you understand what I'm saying everything that's positive is God everything that is good is God hallelujah you know I don't know you know you know and I'm closing job I think about was talking about job today I said you know Joe job didn't have no script like this Joe was supposed to be he supposed to be the oldest book but he knew God how did he know God by revelation how else would he have known to sacrifice animals for his children's disobedience hallelujah and job did everything in faith don't you understand the more faithful you are the more blessings you get this is true when God can trust you he'll give you whatever but they know you're not going to ask for the wrong stuff when in took can trust you you said why this man got a million dollars because he know you ain't gonna do right with it yeah that's the truth gotta give you a million dollars if you're gonna you know you're not gonna you're not gonna trade something for your soul we look at this thing and I'm telling you this message is so beautiful it's wonderful it's it's like I said up beyond comprehension and I'm I'm not worried about that part I'm just believing it I'm having faith in this thing because you know what just like I was telling brother today I don't worry about not being taking the rapture I don't worry about being lost or left behind or any of that I just don't God took that from me when God revealed to me I'm his bride it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks Paul said is not it's not the touch not taste not handle not that was of the law and you and I must understand by God's grace I all I can tell you it must become a revelation to you you see a brother book do you get down I do I do get down sometime only because of my own will somewhere my will is not being met and you know the sad thing about it is it's not about our will as he is and we can keep that focus that everything we go through it's not gonna be you who glory hallelujah you know what what have you go got into an army and you're not trained what's going to happen to you you die the first day but God has to train us we got more work to do you know after we raptured y'all think it's just gonna be hallelujah all the time we got a we got another thousand more years to come down in and work with these people the Bible said with the de Baba said we will rule them with an iron rod y'all understand me do y'all think that's oh happy day I don't even understand that but the Bible said we'd be here brother Branham said we'll come back and we're after that three and a half years of ha wonderful life I don't know who all gonna be sitting next to me but ah it's gonna be wonderful don't bother me while I'm eating it's gonna be a wonderful thing and you know I look at this thing and I says Lord if you don't speak it I have an angel every one I've got an angel but of them said when we speak faith we got an angel amen that's their Amen to make it come to pass and glory hallelujah I I just can't explain it but the Lord is here he's assured me things and I can't explain it that's all I can tell you some things you just don't tell but nevertheless to say I don't make mistake I make mistakes but the blood of Jesus the grace of God is unconditional less than and the Lord didn't have to do this for me he's done it for me you didn't have to do it for you that's the glory of this amen I so love the Lord and I trust that you do too you know what I don't know about you but something's happening on the inside of me and it's all positive and I'm gonna let God have his way yeah I'm tired of this world don't ya yeah I'm so tired of it I'm tired of all of the vanities and things of that nature and you know just tired and I'm not begging it but I'm telling God please however you need to finish me under whatever cost please do so I realize is temporal all this stuff people hold on and all this man I'm going to heaven when I'm gonna hold on to this floor I have nothing to offer God except for what he's given me and that's his dear son that's Christ that's my token that's my life that's my lifesaver I have nothing else like Abel had nothing else to give God but the lamb that's all I have thank God for a prophet who brought us the bloody bleeding word of the Lamb that's what he called the message the bloody greedy word of the Son of Man Father we think you know for your goodness and your grace you know my heart and I honor your prophet law because lord I I can somewhat see all that he had to go through to get this message over you didn't even spare him Lord like it didn't even spare your dear son Jesus you didn't spare him from heart aches and pains and trials and tribulations and father you're not going to spare us either but I pray Lord Jesus that when you return father that you remember us take us with your father we believe Lord even as your prophet Paul said sometimes to do what's right it doesn't always come right that good that I would sometime I don't do father but I know your blood has covered us I know your has protected us and your mercy in door to all generations I pray father for the family of God in this church now you be merciful to us Lord forgive us for being so good further if you give us other things we come short in and give us grace to grow into your perfection help us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen so that you will be aware whether Connelly will no longer be cleaning up the church he's been a real warrior I love my brother I'm only a mousing this so so that if something's is out of order you won't be blaming him or his wife they have served as long as I know and we so thank God for them both in the family there who have actually done a wonderful job but you got to understand we're growing older and I've always marveled at our brother stem stampers strength but you and I can tell that he's slowing up a little bit only in his physical his heart is still young and vibrant and we thank God for him and in his wife I know my daughter crystal said that she'd be willing to help I'll clean the church and so if there's no one else we'll just let her do it and how she does it there between her and God but we're believing that that should do a good job it was so amazing because she said some things about this some time ago and and I thought well you know and to a girl of collie tails I'll say something differently I'm just gonna let it go and then he came tonight I just wish we could just I know he is not asking for anything I just wish I could do something special for him because brother Conley has done so many special things for me and I know that he's done these things only because God is in his heart is that he and his wife I just believe it all my heart they are bride I just believe that and I've seen God's work in action through them now I'm carrying on because there's so much in my heart you know we we disagree some time but we still stand with each other and I really appreciate him I've never felt a difference in the spirit and I trust and hope he had felt you know a lasting one anyway but I do love him I really do I love him and his wife and family and whatever God's will is or him let it be done amen you love the Lord
