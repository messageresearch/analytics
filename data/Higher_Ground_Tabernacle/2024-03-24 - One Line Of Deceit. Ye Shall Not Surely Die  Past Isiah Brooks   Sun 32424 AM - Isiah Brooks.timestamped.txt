[49:30] thoughts and ideas that have not been
[49:32] aligned to your
[49:34] word Jesus
[49:37] Christ amen amen you may be
[49:44] seated well you know I I want to say by
[49:48] the grace of
[49:50] God we welcome everyone once
[49:55] again but I also want to stir up your
[50:03] conscience so that you could realize the
[50:05] day that you're living
[50:09] in some things are so
[50:14] uncertain and we think sometimes we
[50:18] stand in a place of
[50:21] [Music]
[50:22] security but there is only one place of
[50:25] security
[50:28] and that's in Jesus
[50:31] Christ I think about the
[50:35] Titanic and it's amazing how Hollywood
[50:38] won't let it
[50:43] die but I don't believe it's
[50:46] Hollywood Hollywood uh that brings that
[50:51] inspiration I believe God makes it
[50:55] happen just to remind
[50:58] people that anything man
[51:01] made cannot be
[51:04] trusted you can't put your
[51:08] Assurance in these natural
[51:11] things because the natural things are
[51:14] not the real
[51:16] things the real things are the
[51:18] supernatural
[51:20] things some people uh put their trust in
[51:25] people put their trust in
[51:29] businesses put their uh their trust in
[51:35] churches and remember the
[51:40] scripture in in the wisdom of
[51:43] Solomon he found seven
[51:47] churches and none of them were
[51:50] faithful he used the type as
[51:55] women church is Aiken as to a
[51:59] woman some people Church in uh trust in
[52:05] [Music]
[52:06] families but your family will fail
[52:11] you some people trust in
[52:16] friends but your friends will fail
[52:19] you the Bible said put no
[52:23] trust in the arms of Flesh
[52:29] but we'll do
[52:31] that and as I
[52:34] said there's only one place you can put
[52:37] your
[52:39] trust there's only one place of
[52:44] assurance the Bible said the grass will
[52:48] wither the flowers fade
[52:51] away but the word of the Lord shall
[52:55] stand
[52:57] the Bible tells us that heaven and Earth
[53:00] shall pass away but my word shall not
[53:04] pass
[53:05] away they ask a man one
[53:08] time where would you rather be
[53:13] standing in
[53:15] heaven or the
[53:18] word and the man said the
[53:22] word because heaven and
[53:25] earth
[53:26] away but the word of the Lord shall
[53:30] stand I want to say something to those
[53:33] of us who follow this
[53:36] message the message of the end
[53:39] time the message that God sent
[53:42] us to help us prepare for a
[53:47] Rapture I want to say to you it's later
[53:51] than what you
[53:53] think uh your denomination can't save
[53:58] you your pastor can't save
[54:01] you hallelujah hallelujah y'all getting
[54:04] quiet over the only person that can save
[54:08] you is the Lord Jesus
[54:12] Christ that's not an
[54:20] uncertainty that is a
[54:23] certainty Hallelujah I'm trying not to
[54:26] get excited I'm already excited I'm
[54:29] trying to to keep this together
[54:33] today Jesus said come unto
[54:37] me all ye that
[54:39] labor and I heavy
[54:42] laden and I will give you
[54:46] rest hallelujah hallelujah is that
[54:50] right uh when we think about
[54:55] salvation sometimes we hold on to things
[54:58] that we
[55:00] shouldn't but the only place of
[55:04] security is in the scripture that and
[55:07] and we call
[55:09] it the City of
[55:13] Refuge because we all have
[55:16] sinned and come short of the glory of
[55:21] God but the Bible says take my yoke upon
[55:25] you
[55:27] and learn of
[55:30] me that's what people don't want to see
[55:33] they don't want to understand you don't
[55:36] just come to
[55:37] Christ you must learn of
[55:40] him and the only way to learn of
[55:44] him is to learn his
[55:48] word for I am
[55:51] meek and lowly in
[55:53] heart now let me go back to the learn
[55:57] part this has nothing to do with
[56:01] education you can be as ignorant as a
[56:04] rock and you can learn of
[56:09] God because the Bible says that the holy
[56:14] spirit will lead you and guide you into
[56:18] all
[56:19] truth when you learn of God you learn by
[56:25] experience
[56:27] not by somebody telling
[56:29] you it's a one-on-one
[56:33] situation where you literally come to
[56:36] understand
[56:38] God by his
[56:41] leadership Hallelujah is that right
[56:44] remember the woman with the issue of
[56:47] blood Hallelujah she more than likely
[56:50] wasn't
[56:53] educated but one thing for certain
[56:56] she was a true servant of the
[56:59] Lord hallelujah now what told
[57:03] her or who told her if I would just
[57:08] touch the H of His
[57:11] Garment I would be made whole that was a
[57:16] revelation that only God could have
[57:18] given
[57:19] her it wasn't
[57:21] written the Pharisees couldn't have
[57:24] given it to
[57:25] us sades could not have given it to
[57:28] her the only one that could have given
[57:31] her this Revelation was God himself
[57:35] hello somebody let me say it like this
[57:39] God bypassed the humanity of
[57:44] Jesus
[57:46] Hallelujah you say what do you mean
[57:49] because even Jesus turned and said who
[57:52] touched
[57:54] me Hallelujah Hallelujah is that right I
[57:58] look at what what what Jesus asked
[58:01] Peter Jesus asked Peter who do men say I
[58:07] the son of man
[58:11] am and Peter
[58:14] said some
[58:16] say that's the thing you can't go by
[58:19] what some
[58:21] say You must have a revelation of him
[58:25] yourself
[58:26] some say he's
[58:29] Jeremiah you understand or some of the
[58:32] other
[58:33] prophets but Jesus said who do you
[58:37] say I am Hallelujah is that right he
[58:42] said Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[58:45] Living
[58:46] God and what did Jesus say
[58:50] Flesh and Blood theology didn't give you
[58:54] this going to greatest school that's
[58:57] here in Jerusalem didn't give that to
[58:59] you Hallelujah My Father which is in
[59:04] heaven he has given this unto you in
[59:07] other words he is basically saying it's
[59:10] the spirit of God the Holy Spirit has
[59:15] revealed this unto you and Upon This
[59:19] Rock hallelujah hallelujah the Gates of
[59:23] Hell shall not
[59:25] prevail see if you can be educated into
[59:29] Jesus you can also be
[59:32] uneducated somebody can take your
[59:38] education Hallelujah huj now what are
[59:40] you saying brother my daddy my natural
[59:44] daddy Hallelujah was a Christian he sang
[59:48] gospel
[59:50] music he was well
[59:52] known his
[59:55] era among the
[59:58] quartex but he was
[1:00:01] persuaded to become a
[1:00:06] Muslim you understand me he didn't have
[1:00:09] a true
[1:00:10] knowledge of the God he was
[1:00:14] worshiping he didn't have a
[1:00:17] revelation of Jesus Christ because once
[1:00:20] you have a
[1:00:22] revelation Jesus
[1:00:24] Christ no matter the winds may
[1:00:28] blow the waves May
[1:00:30] Dash but nothing will remove
[1:00:33] you from that
[1:00:36] Revelation that your life is built upon
[1:00:40] which is Jesus Christ
[1:00:43] himself think about
[1:00:45] this one line of
[1:00:50] dece and We Know by the grace of
[1:00:53] God the serpent didn't preach
[1:00:57] a great
[1:01:00] sermon to
[1:01:02] persuade Eve to do what she
[1:01:04] did matter of fact he preached the very
[1:01:08] sermon God gave to
[1:01:11] ad he just added one
[1:01:15] word
[1:01:17] not you shall surely not
[1:01:21] die y hear what I'm
[1:01:23] saying that one line of Deceit
[1:01:27] hased us into this chaos
[1:01:31] today every
[1:01:33] hospital because of that one line of
[1:01:35] dece every graveyard is because of that
[1:01:39] one line of Deceit
[1:01:41] exist every
[1:01:43] fire that destroy
[1:01:46] families is because of that one line of
[1:01:49] Deceit every hurricane sh sh every
[1:01:53] tornado sh every
[1:01:57] earthquake is because of that one line
[1:01:59] of
[1:02:00] dece your physical
[1:02:03] conditions right now is because of that
[1:02:06] one line of Deceit Hallelujah the demons
[1:02:10] that you
[1:02:11] fight it's because of that one line of
[1:02:14] Deceit Hallelujah those
[1:02:17] Dimensions were
[1:02:20] separated hallelujah hallelujah the
[1:02:22] demons
[1:02:23] existed but they had no way of entering
[1:02:27] in Hallelujah until the word was
[1:02:31] broken in the time of Adam and Eve they
[1:02:35] never
[1:02:36] suffered they never had a need they
[1:02:39] never had a want Hallelujah because God
[1:02:43] had those demonic Powers
[1:02:49] separated you say that brother I don't
[1:02:52] know what you're saying but the Bible
[1:02:54] tells us that Lucifer and his Angel was
[1:02:58] cast
[1:02:59] out Hallelujah but see they couldn't get
[1:03:02] into Human
[1:03:05] family the serent beg the
[1:03:09] woman follow
[1:03:11] suit Hallelujah and the breach was
[1:03:16] brought brought
[1:03:18] in Hallelujah right y'all know what I'm
[1:03:22] saying if you cut
[1:03:24] yourself it brings a
[1:03:27] breach and if you don't take care of
[1:03:30] it it will get
[1:03:32] infected hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:03:35] that's the way it
[1:03:36] was
[1:03:38] Genesis all the way up to
[1:03:41] Calvary
[1:03:42] mankind was suffering from
[1:03:47] infections
[1:03:49] diseases Hallelujah because of the
[1:03:52] breach because of one line of Deceit
[1:03:57] hallelujah hallelujah is that all right
[1:04:01] the moving of the serpent
[1:04:04] seed from the beginning to the
[1:04:08] end
[1:04:10] Satan from that point on began to build
[1:04:14] his
[1:04:14] kingdom Hallelujah is that the truth it
[1:04:18] got so
[1:04:19] bad so God had to destroy the
[1:04:24] Earth by water
[1:04:27] started all over
[1:04:29] again Hallelujah is that right even in
[1:04:33] Sodom God it got so bad God had to
[1:04:37] destroy
[1:04:39] it why because Satan was moving
[1:04:43] fast
[1:04:46] a God does things in order hallelujah
[1:04:50] hallelujah and and had Satan won
[1:04:54] then we wouldn't be here
[1:04:59] today listen he's people say well I
[1:05:01] don't believe in the devil you don't
[1:05:03] have to believe
[1:05:05] in I can hold up this handkerchief and
[1:05:08] you say and you can say I don't believe
[1:05:10] you got a handkerchief in your
[1:05:12] hand what difference doesn't me me if
[1:05:15] you don't believe the reality is I have
[1:05:19] a handkerchief in my hand people say
[1:05:22] well I don't believe in Jesus CH what
[1:05:24] different does it make
[1:05:26] Hallelujah huj he's
[1:05:29] come he's died he
[1:05:32] resurrected and he's living today
[1:05:35] hallelujah hallelujah how do you know
[1:05:37] he's living brother because he lives in
[1:05:40] me he's still heals he still delivers
[1:05:45] he's still raised from the dead
[1:05:47] Hallelujah he's still
[1:05:50] God so what difference does it
[1:05:53] make Satan offered this world to
[1:05:57] Christ
[1:06:00] Hallelujah but he he turned it
[1:06:03] down thank God is that right why because
[1:06:08] of the
[1:06:09] breach Satan had control of the
[1:06:13] Earth the
[1:06:14] air Prince and the power of the
[1:06:18] air hallelujah hallelujah and it's still
[1:06:22] that
[1:06:22] way and how is he controlling it now
[1:06:27] television through
[1:06:29] radio all these
[1:06:32] technology Hallelujah that uses the
[1:06:36] airwaves to get to the hearts of the
[1:06:39] people still
[1:06:42] ruling hallelujah hallelujah is that
[1:06:45] right but Jesus said don't you
[1:06:48] worry my Kingdom's
[1:06:50] coming hallelujah hallelujah is that
[1:06:53] right because that's what pil said to
[1:06:56] him that's what pilot said to
[1:06:59] Jesus basically he asked the
[1:07:02] question are you a
[1:07:04] king and Jesus said thou sayth
[1:07:08] Hallelujah and he said if this kingdom
[1:07:11] was mine I would fight for
[1:07:15] it hallelujah hallelujah is that right
[1:07:18] but he said for this purpose came out
[1:07:22] into the
[1:07:24] world what do you mean
[1:07:26] to establish my
[1:07:29] kingdom in this
[1:07:31] earth not in heaven in this earth
[1:07:36] Hallelujah don't mean we're not going to
[1:07:38] heaven it doesn't mean we're not going
[1:07:41] to
[1:07:41] heaven but Jesus said let thy will be
[1:07:45] done in earth as it is in
[1:07:48] heaven because he knew that he was one
[1:07:51] day inherited
[1:07:53] all are you listening people
[1:07:56] we are now living in Satan's
[1:08:00] Eden but thanks be to
[1:08:03] God that we have had a
[1:08:07] Calvary Hallelujah you see everything
[1:08:10] now is so
[1:08:13] uncertain we we are on pins and
[1:08:17] needles we on edge because we don't know
[1:08:21] what tomorrow will hold for
[1:08:23] us hallelujah uh and this is not just in

[1:09:01] Gathering of the
[1:09:03] darkness there is a war
[1:09:05] coming Hallelujah and you better believe
[1:09:09] you the only way you're going to be able
[1:09:13] to withstand
[1:09:15] Satan is that you have put on the whole
[1:09:18] armor of
[1:09:20] God Jesus Christ
[1:09:23] himself hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:25] cuz if you fight by the sword you're
[1:09:28] going to
[1:09:30] die hallelujah hallelujah these
[1:09:35] others this is this is my
[1:09:37] subtopic one or the
[1:09:40] other one or the other which one you
[1:09:43] going to
[1:09:46] be or the
[1:09:48] other see you got to decide what you're
[1:09:51] going to be who you
[1:09:53] are you know like I said I was in
[1:09:57] Colombia Carina and we ministered there
[1:10:00] at my old
[1:10:01] church and I preached on the likeness
[1:10:04] and the image the very thing I preached
[1:10:07] here except for God dealt with their
[1:10:13] needs and the people were so
[1:10:16] blessed and they said this is what we
[1:10:20] need I can give you great Revelation
[1:10:23] play with you now we're in the season
[1:10:28] where the bride makes herself
[1:10:31] ready how many agree with
[1:10:33] that yes we're in the season where God
[1:10:38] where the bride makes herself
[1:10:41] ready ready for what the
[1:10:46] translation what people call the Rapture
[1:10:49] the
[1:10:51] translation but understand there's two
[1:10:54] Destin
[1:10:57] one destiny is heaven and the other
[1:11:01] Destiny is Hell there's only two seeds
[1:11:05] one seed is of God and the other seed is
[1:11:08] of
[1:11:09] the Hallelujah Hallelujah one or the
[1:11:14] other the others were in John the
[1:11:17] Baptist
[1:11:18] day is that right I'm talking about the
[1:11:21] devil and his children the others were
[1:11:24] in Jes
[1:11:26] day is that right even Jesus when you he
[1:11:31] saw the the
[1:11:33] Pharisees he basically said you had a
[1:11:36] cloak and you had a
[1:11:39] covering Hallelujah you look
[1:11:41] religious Pi you're
[1:11:44] Pious and if I had not come you would
[1:11:47] have been able to
[1:11:49] hide you can't hide from the
[1:11:51] light that's the Bible and the word of
[1:11:55] God is light you can't hide from the
[1:11:58] light Hallelujah the light comes to
[1:12:01] despair
[1:12:03] Darkness Hallelujah and listen the devil
[1:12:06] don't care where he
[1:12:08] hides Hallelujah is that right he can
[1:12:12] hide in your
[1:12:13] boss he can hide you know in your
[1:12:16] school he hides wherever he
[1:12:19] wants but when the light comes you
[1:12:23] understand me the Bible said we are the
[1:12:25] light of the
[1:12:26] world a city that sits on a hill that
[1:12:30] can be Hallelujah don't get
[1:12:34] upset because you can't be like
[1:12:38] them Hallelujah you ought to
[1:12:41] Rejoice that God has chosen you to be a
[1:12:46] light of the
[1:12:48] world hallelujah hallelujah don't get
[1:12:50] jealous of them let them have all this
[1:12:54] world
[1:12:56] me but give me
[1:13:00] Jesus hallelujah hallelujah we're at an
[1:13:04] hour that we must watch and
[1:13:09] pray Hallelujah you heard me
[1:13:12] say Satan in his
[1:13:15] battle battling the
[1:13:17] bride knew her powers and her strength
[1:13:23] Hallelujah he know
[1:13:26] that the word of God and prayer are the
[1:13:30] two
[1:13:31] greatest weapons that they
[1:13:33] have hallelujah hallelujah so he knows
[1:13:37] if he gets you to stop reading the
[1:13:40] Bible the
[1:13:42] message
[1:13:46] pray Hallelujah and he also know that if
[1:13:51] he can divide a
[1:13:52] church they won't be able to move
[1:13:55] forward because a house body cannot
[1:13:59] stand you said what do you mean brother
[1:14:01] R look at our own country we have never
[1:14:05] been so divided in our lives or our
[1:14:08] history and what's happening to us we
[1:14:11] are being
[1:14:13] conquered Hallelujah not by a political
[1:14:16] Realm by Satan
[1:14:21] himself amen they are devils are always
[1:14:25] they are in great and high
[1:14:28] positions Hallelujah is that right are
[1:14:31] they in the
[1:14:32] government politics
[1:14:36] religion look at all the
[1:14:38] preachers amen that that claim to be
[1:14:40] giving uh Salvation to the
[1:14:43] people and basically all they're doing
[1:14:45] is preaching
[1:14:47] psychology Hallelujah I don't need to
[1:14:49] know how to live
[1:14:51] here I find my way in this place
[1:14:55] I need to prepare for the life to come
[1:14:59] y'all hear me this this life is going to
[1:15:03] end every one of us if the Lord carries
[1:15:07] we are going to go to the
[1:15:09] Grave Hallelujah and is at that point
[1:15:13] you need to know whether you one or the
[1:15:18] other to be honest with you it will be
[1:15:23] revealed
[1:15:25] yeah there's nothing more
[1:15:27] horrifying to be on your death
[1:15:31] bed to know you missed
[1:15:35] it many people come down to that
[1:15:40] point and you know what often time they
[1:15:43] don't even
[1:15:44] repent or even have a desire to
[1:15:50] repent my my sister was a nurse of some
[1:15:53] sort

[1:27:11] Jesus yall better hear what I'm saying
[1:27:14] then he's talking to
[1:27:16] you then why won't you believe
[1:27:21] it which of you can search these
[1:27:23] scriptures
[1:27:26] say Jesus Christ came short of being the
[1:27:32] Messiah he did that was
[1:27:36] WR and he did many things that is not
[1:27:40] written the Bible said he did so many
[1:27:45] things that it would take
[1:27:49] books
[1:27:50] Hallelujah you understand me so he G
[1:27:54] gives us a taste of
[1:27:56] it but every taste is
[1:28:00] true every bit of it is
[1:28:03] right I don't listen to say I understand
[1:28:07] everything would make me a
[1:28:09] liar but I believe
[1:28:13] everything I don't know
[1:28:15] how no's AR
[1:28:20] floated scientifically I don't know
[1:28:23] how Lazarus came up from the
[1:28:27] grave I don't even know
[1:28:29] how Jonah was swallowed by a
[1:28:33] way but I believe every bit of
[1:28:36] it hallelujah hallelujah I don't know
[1:28:40] how Hallelujah that man of the Old
[1:28:43] Testament was thrown in the grave of
[1:28:48] Elijah and the quicking power of Elijah
[1:28:51] bone brought him back to life
[1:28:54] I don't know how but I believe every bit
[1:28:57] of it I don't know how he turned water

[1:29:03] wine somebody but I believe every bit of
[1:29:07] it hallelujah hallelujah yes sir I don't
[1:29:11] know how he chose
[1:29:14] Malachi but he did it
[1:29:16] any I don't know how how he chose me how
[1:29:21] he chose you I believe
[1:29:25] Hallelujah hallu yes sir because of
[1:29:29] Jesus Christ because he turned down the
[1:29:32] offer that Satan gave him it was a
[1:29:36] doorway for my life it was a doorway for
[1:29:39] your life come into
[1:29:42] Holiness come into
[1:29:45] sanctification come into
[1:29:47] justification it was God's
[1:29:49] way Hallelujah can you
[1:29:53] imagine if Jesus had taken the
[1:29:58] offer our entire life would have been
[1:30:03] different we would have been full of
[1:30:07] demons without no
[1:30:11] Deliverance hell would have been on
[1:30:14] Earth Hallelujah so here I'm going to
[1:30:16] say I got a quote for that but I'm going
[1:30:18] to
[1:30:19] read in the beginning of time when Jesus
[1:30:23] Christ
[1:30:24] or God began to
[1:30:27] make
[1:30:29] creatures he created
[1:30:31] angels but Angels were not
[1:30:34] Sons they were Spirits
[1:30:38] sarim uh you know
[1:30:41] cherubim and those angels that that fa
[1:30:46] now did you know Jesus God knew that
[1:30:50] that that these Angels were going to
[1:30:52] fall
[1:30:54] he needed
[1:30:56] them in that Fallen
[1:31:00] State Hallelujah y'all hear me so let me
[1:31:04] tell you what
[1:31:05] happened so when you're
[1:31:09] born in this this this
[1:31:11] world God
[1:31:14] permits a
[1:31:16] demon a fallen
[1:31:19] angel to come into your
[1:31:22] spirit
[1:31:26] you may not believe that but that's the
[1:31:29] true that's why when that baby
[1:31:33] lies is the demon that
[1:31:37] makes when that child
[1:31:39] steal it's a demon that makes that
[1:31:42] child you say what do you mean that's
[1:31:44] why that's why you got to be born
[1:31:47] again all of us we you know when we come
[1:31:50] to God we got
[1:31:52] devils we look at Mary Magdalene because
[1:31:55] she had
[1:31:58] seven Legion had a
[1:32:01] thousand and I wonder how many of us got
[1:32:05] more than
[1:32:07] Legion hallelujah hallelujah I'm just
[1:32:10] trying to tell you everybody born I got
[1:32:13] the word I got a I got a message every
[1:32:17] one of
[1:32:19] us this is the way the prophet says God
[1:32:22] permits that spirit
[1:32:25] he permits that Spirit to come on
[1:32:28] you Hallelujah you understand me if you
[1:32:32] didn't have that Spirit you would need
[1:32:37] sanctification hallelujah hallelujah you
[1:32:40] understand me but these demons that you
[1:32:43] have or Fallen
[1:32:46] Spirits must be taken out of
[1:32:49] you come on somebody and the only one
[1:32:52] who can do that
[1:32:54] Jesus Christ
[1:32:57] himself hallelujah hallelujah how many
[1:32:59] of times we we do things we don't want
[1:33:01] to
[1:33:04] doall and then whose will is that it
[1:33:06] surely is not your
[1:33:08] will because you're grieved in your
[1:33:10] heart about
[1:33:12] it and you say God I don't want to do
[1:33:14] that no more but you see you haven't met
[1:33:18] Jesus the way you need to meet him
[1:33:21] Hallelujah and the only way
[1:33:24] you going to get rid of those Spirit you
[1:33:27] got to shine the light on it you got to
[1:33:31] take the word let the word wash you
[1:33:38] clean that's the truth this is that very
[1:33:42] yes sir
[1:33:44] amen you know in some devils We
[1:33:51] inherited really every we God we
[1:33:54] inherited uh because because of the
[1:33:57] flesh Hallelujah but it's not that with
[1:34:00] in the spirit God is more concerned
[1:34:04] about he's concerned about that
[1:34:08] Soul because all of us the Bible says
[1:34:10] were
[1:34:12] born like the children of
[1:34:15] Wrath we all were born
[1:34:18] Sinners but in the
[1:34:21] soul God has a seed
[1:34:25] hallelujah oh come on somebody is that
[1:34:28] true because now remember the sour sold
[1:34:31] the good seed that was God sowing the
[1:34:37] seed but there was another man that came
[1:34:40] after him that was an evil man that was
[1:34:44] the devil come on somebody and he sold
[1:34:47] the seed
[1:34:49] too that's where Eve messed up
[1:34:56] up to that
[1:34:57] point the devil had no Avenue into the
[1:35:00] human
[1:35:02] race
[1:35:04] hallel but then he began he sold his
[1:35:06] seed too so it had to happen it had to
[1:35:10] happen that's why Jesus said
[1:35:14] Nicodemus everything You' done all your
[1:35:18] Works has been human
[1:35:20] effort Hallelujah you did because you
[1:35:24] knew how to do it and the law commanded
[1:35:27] you to do it but I've got a new law you
[1:35:31] must be born again Hallelujah that seed
[1:35:36] that I planted in
[1:35:38] you must be quick Hallelujah so that you
[1:35:42] can become the one and not the
[1:35:46] other y hear what I'm saying so that you
[1:35:49] can become the one and not the other
[1:35:53] Hallelujah Hallelujah and you ought to
[1:35:54] be tired of being the
[1:35:56] other when you got a way out you got a
[1:36:00] way out Hallelujah come unto me all you
[1:36:05] that are
[1:36:07] Laden and I will give you
[1:36:10] what for your soul that's right and
[1:36:14] Hebrew
[1:36:16] says hallelujah is that right we ought
[1:36:19] to
[1:36:21] labor to enter into his rest
[1:36:24] how do you labor how do you get a real
[1:36:28] Birth by way of
[1:36:33] prayer people say well
[1:36:35] I I got the Holy Ghost when I
[1:36:38] believe that's not the
[1:36:41] scripture the scripture says have you
[1:36:44] received the Holy
[1:36:46] Ghost since you
[1:36:49] believe see because you believe that's
[1:36:53] good
[1:36:54] that's
[1:36:55] justification Hallelujah justification
[1:36:58] will bring you up that same Holy Ghost
[1:36:59] will bring you to
[1:37:01] sanctification hallel but all of us need
[1:37:04] to fire
[1:37:08] baptism
[1:37:10] hallelujah oh my right one or the other
[1:37:15] choose you this
[1:37:17] day
[1:37:19] serve hallelujah hallelujah now you
[1:37:22] watch them two seeds
[1:37:25] one fighting the evil trying to destroy
[1:37:28] the righteous
[1:37:29] SE and he tried to destroy
[1:37:33] Abel but God raised up SE to
[1:37:38] take he thought he had Jesus right

[1:38:16] righteous but God delivered them out of
[1:38:18] them
[1:38:19] all hallelu you you you God didn't say
[1:38:23] put on the whole arm of
[1:38:26] God because we're going to have a
[1:38:28] fashion
[1:38:29] show Hallelujah you put on the whole God

[1:38:36] fight people think being a Christian is
[1:38:39] easy a hard way if you real

[1:42:28] squeeze and it's
[1:42:32] coming right now they're trying to get
[1:42:35] rid of the
[1:42:37] Bible so what you going to do about

[1:42:45] true the American Constitution will be
[1:42:49] changed that's the word of the
[1:42:51] Lord that's all right the whole system
[1:42:55] will be
[1:42:56] changed Christianity will become the
[1:43:00] enemy to God we've been told Hallelujah
[1:43:05] there will come become a union of the
[1:43:08] churches the churches will
[1:43:11] unify but they don't know that's a trick
[1:43:14] of the
[1:43:15] devil hallelujah hallelujah they will be
[1:43:18] taking the mark of the
[1:43:19] beast y'all hear what I'm saying it's
[1:43:22] the truth
[1:43:23] but the Bride of Jesus Christ knows that
[1:43:26] her true
[1:43:27] Refuge is not in the church not in the
[1:43:32] organization true Refuge is in Jesus
[1:43:35] Christ
[1:43:37] Alone is that right the Bible says the
[1:43:41] name of the Lord is a strong power and
[1:43:44] the righteous running there in and they
[1:43:47] are saved Hallelujah you're saved In the
[1:43:50] Arms of Jesus
[1:43:54] Hallelujah glory to God now it's it's a
[1:43:57] crazy
[1:43:58] thing when you run into the City of
[1:44:01] Refuge I'm have
[1:44:03] to when you run into the City of Refuge
[1:44:07] that means when you go in
[1:44:08] there you you got to make a confession
[1:44:11] to the
[1:44:14] elders that you didn't mean to do
[1:44:18] wrong but you know if they find out that
[1:44:21] you made a lie
[1:44:24] they will put you
[1:44:26] out and now you are at the hands of your
[1:44:31] enemy Hallelujah but as long as you be
[1:44:34] truthful in
[1:44:35] there as long as you you you you
[1:44:39] appreciate the
[1:44:40] safety you can stay there
[1:44:43] forever Hallelujah and that was just a
[1:44:46] shout out type in the Old
[1:44:50] Testament hallelujah hallelujah so when
[1:44:52] you come to Jesus Christ you better stay
[1:44:57] there Hallelujah cuz whether you realize
[1:44:59] it or not you have a enemy waiting on

[1:45:15] thought they would do
[1:45:18] Hallelujah yeah and it's all
[1:45:21] because they left the place

[1:45:48] Calvary but God raised him up
[1:45:51] again the third day right and then he
[1:45:54] sent the Holy Ghost
[1:45:56] back to call Sons and Daughters of God
[1:46:00] and that
[1:46:01] same religious
[1:46:04] seed is persecuting the righteous seed
[1:46:07] yet
[1:46:08] today you
[1:46:09] see they're trying to destroy that
[1:46:12] righteous branch of
[1:46:15] God all over sees people are
[1:46:20] hiding their Christianity

[1:49:07] to where I want to
[1:49:08] go because that same evil is
[1:49:11] here
[1:49:14] hallelujah see now let let me say this
[1:49:18] if you are Abraham's
[1:49:20] seed you have the same faith that
[1:49:25] Abraham let's stop there because that's
[1:49:28] not because you say you have
[1:49:32] it that faith is
[1:49:35] action Hallelujah is an action
[1:49:39] word Abraham believed
[1:49:43] God the Bible said he staggered
[1:49:47] not the promises of
[1:49:50] God hallelujah hallelujah Abraham
[1:49:54] knew that God would
[1:49:58] perform everything he had
[1:50:01] promised hallelujah hallelujah and the
[1:50:04] only way you can have Abraham
[1:50:07] Faith to have the Christ which is the
[1:50:09] Holy Ghost in
[1:50:11] you because it is his faith and the
[1:50:15] Bible said the just shall live
[1:50:18] by
[1:50:20] I'm especially in the church
[1:50:23] it's the Royal Seed of
[1:50:25] Abraham there are two seeds of Abraham
[1:50:28] one of them was the natural
[1:50:31] seed and the other one was Christ The
[1:50:34] Promise so through Isaac Israel was
[1:50:38] blessed through Christ he become the
[1:50:41] father of
[1:50:42] Nations so the Royal
[1:50:45] seed much greater than what we be than
[1:50:49] the natural Seed of
[1:50:51] Abraham
[1:50:53] how much greater excuse
[1:50:55] me so if you are in Christ you have a
[1:51:01] sued a super of what Abraham
[1:51:06] was because you come by the Roy you see
[1:51:11] Christ I'm talking about I'm not talking
[1:51:15] about a watered down Holy
[1:51:21] Ghost water down holy ghost that only
[1:51:25] knows about
[1:51:27] entertainment I'm talking about the real
[1:51:29] Holy
[1:51:30] Ghost the same Holy Ghost they had on
[1:51:34] the day of
[1:51:36] Pentecost the same holy ghost that fell
[1:51:39] on theu street and brought a worldwide
[1:51:43] Revival hallelujah hallelujah I'm
[1:51:45] talking about the same holy ghost that
[1:51:48] not only changes a man
[1:51:50] heart changes way thinking changes way
[1:51:54] of living changes everything about him
[1:51:58] Hallelujah till he or she becomes a
[1:52:02] onean
[1:52:03] army Hallelujah the
[1:52:07] very the Holy Ghost where the very
[1:52:10] omnipotent of God lives in the heart of
[1:52:14] men hallelujah what are you going to be
[1:52:18] one or the other
[1:52:21] I'm hallelujah hallelujah what are you
[1:52:24] going to be one or the
[1:52:25] other remember God chose
[1:52:29] Samuel and and Samuel had to go anoint
[1:52:33] Saul who was the People's
[1:52:35] Choice hallelujah hallelujah but Saul
[1:52:38] was
[1:52:39] carnal hallah even though God anointed
[1:52:42] him anointed him with a cruise of
[1:52:45] oil Hallelujah but David was
[1:52:49] anointed with a horn of
[1:52:51] all uh
[1:52:54] um
[1:52:55] horn and that that horn that oil is it
[1:52:59] it uh Hallelujah was poured onto David's
[1:53:03] head and it ran all the way down the
[1:53:06] Garment and all the way down to se that
[1:53:08] means the anointing of
[1:53:11] God everything of you everything you
[1:53:15] possess anoint your eyes your mouth your
[1:53:19] lips your ears

[1:53:35] when God told him to kill the AM

[2:23:02] not and then in the New
[2:23:05] Testament we know that the word of God
[2:23:08] says Jesus Christ is the
[2:23:11] same yesterday today and
[2:23:14] forever so he changes not
[2:23:17] either the church may change
[2:23:20] people may
[2:23:21] change but the word Remains the
[2:23:26] Same so I hope to see more than two or
