be speaking to you again I have only a few months left to stay with you here unfortunately I don't have time to be to be coming to church as often as I want to because I'm so busy I have to finish up with my teases by meters by April and I have to defend my thesis and it's a lot of work so if you don't see me here it's not because of anything is just because I'm just I will move with ya but I some when I mean I came out I mean I'll do my best to come in and courage bravery name because I believe in fellowship so bad I hate heavenly righteous God want to thank and bless your Holy Name this morning I want to thank you O God that you are never without a witness Lord we are meeting as a witness that there is a God in heaven has sent his message to this world in his endtime and that there is a remnant in the morning in Windsor Heights all over the surrounding the morning that believe this truth and we are congregating this morning Lord around that bread of life that came down from heaven trusting that we shall feed on it and our hungry souls will be satisfied Lord come down Lord even as you broke that bread to those two brothers died chained it from Jerusalem to a mouse and they recognized you Lord may be present this morning a breaking of thy bread that's this little flock will recognize you that you are in our miss you are not in a multitude but you are in little places like this precious father I yield myself completely unto you praying that you come and take control of my lives that I would say only those things that would edify and encourage somebody Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth it's a trembling fear that one day I'll have to account for every way that I speak from this altar but I'm trusting law that I'm not I'm not going to speak of my own but I'm coming to speak what you have given to your prophet for this age Lord their food into seizing have mercy on us this morning even in Jesus name we pray amen hallelujah less than our Bibles to Acts chapter 1 sorry for keeping you Stanley I'll read quickly so we can proceed Acts chapter 1 where I read verse 7 and 8 then we read again Matthew 24 Acts chapter 1 verse 7 and 8 then again Matthew 24 so except our one verse 7 reads and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth amen let's flip back to Matthew Matthew 24 Matthew 24 all right verse 14 just 1 this and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come may the Lord bless the reading of his word amen shall be seated hallelujah give me your undivided attention for the next few minutes and we'll be done and don't hallelujah beloved in Christ this morning I want to speak to you on the topic a qualified witness a qualified witness amen we are supposed to be ghost witnesses and when our Lord was living this earth some 2,000 years ago he gave his disciples and by extension those who believe on his disciples what we call in a Bible the Great Commission hallelujah the Great Commission he said go out into the world and preach the gospel it's written in the Gospels and in the acts of the Holy Ghost in the Apostles just before the Lord was taken away visibly in their sight this was the last thing that he told them when they were asking to know are you going to restore the kingdom again back to Israel he said it is not in your power to know the times and the seasons that the father has proposed to do his things hallelujah my heart you are supposed to know now is that you must be my witnesses starting from Jerusalem in all of Judea into Samaria and into Iowa hallelujah so we are covered said the whole world amen and fortunately hidden e and it's in Samaria in gdf not I only have it covered because I come from a very remote part of the world very remote village but words that were spoken 2,000 years ago found me there hallelujah amen so that was the Great Commission that has been given to us and it's often referred to as a Great Commission of the change we must evangelize hallelujah my brother before they could go out to evangelize she says told them that you aren't qualified yet to be my witnesses amen if you go out this way you'll be defeated if you go out this way the outcome would not be good so you wait in Jerusalem amen wait in Jerusalem till you have met the requirement of a true witness when you have met the requirements and you go out you'll be victorious and possibly the disciples might have been wondering but he gave us power I mean in Luke 11 and in other scriptures you read that when he commissioned the seven year he commissioned the twelve and when they went out and he came back what testimony they bring back he said Devils were subject to us when we spoke or when we preach and mention your name demons were FLE so by the disciples own understanding they knew what it was to go out and go and preach in the name of Jesus hallelujah so they might have wondered how is it a game that this man is saying that we should wait to really target what of the power he gave us when we went out wouldn't that be sufficient for us bother me with witnesses are you following Church so they might have wondered but I'm sure the day that they met the qualification they knew the difference hallelujah I said the day that the medical if occasion they knew the difference and you see where Abraham made a distinction without him would he have known he made we have a lujah that's why you can't do without the Prophet for this end time he made a distinction between having the gifts of the Holy Ghost and having a giver so at the time that they went out in Luke and Matthew and in all our scriptures when the twelve winter when the seventy went out and they preach demons were truly subject to them hallelujah but don't forget in that when they went out Judas was part of them hallelujah so demons were subject to them they could cast out demons they could heal the sick they could perform all the miracles but they didn't have the giver inside then we have the giver and that is the good thing that we know in this Center because the Pentecostals before the Prophet came on the scene were also deceived likewise the hardness is a street revival in 1906 and they carried on in their revival and you remember the message of the Prophet where he met this Pentecostals and this people speaking tongues and they could interpret and he said it was like a machine gun fire said wow I've never met a group as great as this this is what I have been longing for hallelujah after the meeting he went and greeted the two men one was a genuine believer the other was a hypocrite he was married by had a mistress and we had a child by the mistress and the Prophet has had this gift all through his life so he saw it and to him say I see you are married but for shufai that was somebody who had anointing who could speak in tongues who could interpret a tongue genuinely I'm not talking about the victims to the Ali Baba Baba like some madhouse and I'm not talking about that I'm talking about the genuine tones that came Pentacles or a disaster let me put it away I promise I could understand it he when said I don't you know some of you know the story when searching the scriptures fellow Hebrews is he ready we understand it God gave him the interpretation hallelujah so beloved the disciples before Jesus Christ went away had manifested the power of the Holy Ghost they are exercised the gifts of the Holy Ghost they had seen the gift of healing of course they had the a limitations and they had done all those things but Jesus was telling them that you are not yet qualified to be my witnesses so you wait in Jerusalem when you wait in Jerusalem the qualification will come when the qualification comes you realize it yourself you go out there and you testify of me hallelujah very some time ago I preached a sermon here that I can't those days were not doing the youtube link so I don't think it's on YouTube but I mean if we have all the things there should be some way that this gospel of the kingdom so brethren you see as God was in the beginning so shall it be in the end that is why in a Bible the Bible makes a lot of references to things of the past it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of pseudo hallelujah and I have two people always that the world is overly focused on what the evil that happened in the days of Sodom there are overly focused on the evil that happen in the days of Noah but for me as a bride of Jesus Christ I'm focused on what Noah did right admit it me as a bride of Jesus Christ I'm focused on what Abraham did right and was not in sodium but he stayed who the angel that came down as mighty God that is what is my focus hallelujah of course I can look at what happened among those who are perishing in sodium and understand the condition of the world but for me I have to study carefully what did Abraham do right I he made it and I believe that applies to you too hallelujah so beloved ask God was in the beginning as he was in the beginning parabrahma said that the first thing that God did is always a correcting hallelujah so when he came out with a church on the day of Pentecost filled with the Holy Ghost and power that was the standard so Pentecost is always what their standard when when William Branham was teaching about a church ages amen he said he used a biblical standard he said the first church age without question in the Bible was led by poor support we all know that he was apostle to the Gentiles so how did he find the messengers for the subsequent age is simple that was was ministry was process to Paul because God's first work was poor and that is the standard so in the subsequent it is the one whose ministry was closest to Paul he was the one chosen as the leader of that age or the messenger of the age hallelujah reverence so in the same vein the standard is always Pentacles the LHH hallelujah so the church that patterns more closely after Pentacles is a true church rather because we have so many churches and so many interpretations but in the mists of counterfeit there has to be a genuine currency beloved if there is nothing like dollar the US dollar bill I don't have one in my pocket the US all of you if there is nothing like that will their signature the Treasury secretary if you go manufacturing dollar bills you can't use it because there's no currency called dollar but the reason why if you manufa doing counterfeit dollar you may be able to get away with it and use it some ways because there's a currency called dollar so Breitling the reason why there's counterfeit gospel is because there is genuine gospel hallelujah but it is God's desire that as it was in the beginning when that where there was a clear distinction between genuine Holy Ghost gospel and counterfeit gospel in this end time before he comes again for his bride that distinction has been made a game and God is looking up to you it's looking up to me for that distinction to be made hallelujah brother so it's not a small bet in doubt with Terry on our show this that is why when we come here this is not a time for us to be struggling with basic living this is not a time for the preacher to come and be struggling with the way you dress our sisters the way issue I mean you should look as brethren hallelujah these things we should have overcome them by now and we should be looking forward to rest coming on the Lord for another Pentacles that will put us in the rapture hallelujah because when I win up so hope we've got now cannot make it we need something that is going to defy Oh hallelujah that is going to defy the laws of gravity and Flass hallelujah so brethren is the time for us to be serious is a time families has to pray this is the time that we say no to everything so this was because the devil is born bugging you with everything hallelujah I bought a phone when when did I buy my last one Laos I think last year January or so it's not obsolete I'm sure if I buy one now by next year to be obsolete hallelujah they are just bombarding us with things people cannot talk anymore you sit in a bus now I used the school bus a lot everybody's on a gadget hallelujah if we couples cannot have quality times to talk every when they are eating there's a phone bag I remember one lady in my country remarked to me said she visited a cup of work we are offering student was telling them that he saw in the 90 plus from where you don't know somebody's by the laptop you want corner up the ladies also buy the laptop and they don't I see some homework someway fully I was telling me I can't live that way sort of life is that I mean there is something wrong and we have to say this incident will recognize it and we put our lives right we can't be married to gadgets and I said that applies to me it's not like I'm free from it it's it's a disease that I caught all of us including me we can't be married to gadgets but if there is something I should be married to that is it this is the time that you are supposed to be married to this the Word of God the Bible so we are supposed to be his witnesses by witnesses of what witnesses of the gospel of the kingdom so in my Semin some months ago about this gospel of the kingdom it meant said much is 24 way we read is saying that the gospel of the kingdom has to be preached the whole world before he can come because if it is not preached to the whole world as a witness he will not be justified in trying anybody may be caught hallelujah and our God is a just God so he must give everybody an opportunity hallelujah so when brother Brown was preaching these in the 50s in the 60s Rob Ram said that in some messages he said that only one-third of the world has had a gospel in all our messages he said how well has had a gospel hallelujah Amen now but see the Prophet when he speaks you just continue really just continuous steady you understand you understand him how could he say one place that who has said that gospel so Jesus Christ is coming and another place you say that only one tell has had a gospel so we have to do more amen bye see the truth is that there are two kinds of gospel amen LeBron distinguish between two kinds of gospel and one kind of gospel one type of the gospel has gone around the whole world but the true gospel the one that Apostle Paul preached the one that Peter preach the true gospel that John followed the wonderfully preached in the deserts of Samaria the one that he preached that European Enoch the one that he went and preached in Samaria and even Simon associate got converted that gospel has not gone around the world but there is a gospel of tracks there is problem call it a psychic part of the gospel the psychic part of the gospel the mental part of the gospel that geology part of the gospel you see when Jesus told the disciples to tarry in Jerusalem till they are endued with power he didn't say Tyree in Jerusalem till you are taught enough geology to go out with he didn't say Terry in Jerusalem amen till you are taught enough Greece to go out with till you know how to recite all the Torah before you can go out he said Terry in Jerusalem until you are endued with power amen so Rob Rob said personal tract teaching geology hallelujah is not preaching the gospel and beloved endtime I said believers this is where we are missing it oh can I say that again I say anytime I say believers this is where we are missing it we are overly to focus on geology to that geology has divided us into many pieces and segments and there's nothing wrong with geology I'm not saying there's something wrong I say anytime I see believers are to focus on what geology they are to focus on mysteries they want to do a typology they want to take a mystery from the Old Testament and put it in the days of Abraham nothing wrong with that beloved winner Brom said the highlight of my entire ministry is that talking he said be born again and going to Pentacles that is the whole essence of the coming of the prophet of God receive the new birth cuts divine revelation about where Christ is hiding in your day well he that believes that Jesus Christ is born of God is of God is that no some of the scriptures that's what John said in first John chapter 5 verse 1 I mean so kinda Revelation divine revelation is important catch it Peter caught it ye are the Christ the Son of the Living God he said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you by my father who is in heaven and you are Peter and on this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it that's true if my revelation is important in name divine revelation must change your life when it changes your life you must move on through that pyramid and get to pentacles that's the whole essence of what we believe that because when you live a life of power you are the greatest witness you are the greatest testimony that God has on earth hallelujah amen I'm feeling inspired this morning amen so beloved in Christ there's a scriptural requirement LeBron said look before you can be a witness even in our law courts one of the things that I don't know how many of us having to contrive into God and one of the things that a good attorney would do if you have a witness is to question the credibility of the witness you know that they have something they call cross-examination and when you have been your witness is being cross-examined enough I mean in serious high-profile cases like in meta trials and things like that somebody who said he saw it you have to question him where were you when you said you saw it what happened if they notice any discrepancies in the things that you say questions your credibility and we want to true Matt as much as possible to your credibility so that they judge you see this is not a credible witness I can't rely on his testimony to pass judgment is that right now but in the same way I'll come to that versa but let me say it before I continue in the same way if you go out there as a witness of the Lord Jesus Christ as a witness of this gospel hallelujah that enemy the devil has his has his lawyers out there yes his demons out there he has his defense attorneys out there who are going to question your credibility well ah so you better be a credible witness or you don't venture out Alleluia I said better be a credible witness or you don't think how they don't know what you are talking about if you don't know what you are talking about don't go say it I'll give you some examples very soon about my first time when I went out what I experienced myself hallelujah amen but let's go back to this idea about the gospel of the kingdom memory so we must be witnesses to the gospel of the kingdom and I'm saying that the gospel of the kingdom is the original gospel our streets and Pentacles amen and in this end time we have seen we saw a church we saw a man that exemplified that same gospel and even more because he said what he did in my ministry in one night was more than what he did his own earthly ministry for three and a half years hallelujah because jesus said that I go to the Father hallelujah that when I go I'll send you the promise of the father hallelujah when you if you received our promise amen you are going to do more works that I have done and we saw that that on the day of Pentecost when pentacles finally came and Peter went out there with the on the twelve and with all their 120-dollar in the upper room power from for service came and they were preaching and yeah shadows were healing people when paul made a lot on the road to damascus after his conversion he started preaching and aprons and hacka Jews were placed on his body and carried to distant lands and people were healed and he is so passe I did not come to you in the excellency of speech he said when I came if my gospel my gospel was not in fine West my gospel was 14 flurry worse when I sewed on my my African assets hallelujah cause we must come him power south flurry waves it's not how beautiful people are falling dead before I'm ox look at these churches you are Austin and all these mighty preachers with fifteen hundred thousand congregation nine speakers amen brother problem was not a nice picker he didn't know his grammar a man species English like a Kentucky a country boy amen I didn't did it yes that's correct God doesn't care about your loss of grammar he doesn't care about that but the man had power I say he had power God gave him power he was a qualified witness hallelujah so brethren the gospel of trucks and literature probrem said if that gospel is the only place the gospel thomas go around the world then the indians are finished you know the Indians are they believe in many gods I don't know how many of you have traveled to India before there are idols everywhere they believe in the Astrophysical world where I come from Africa I mean Ghana West Africa you know how many of your head of juju they mean Ghana to Guam or my people especially and we're people we are their home of Juji and I know what I'm talking about and you better you can't go out there and talk about bye boo when you don't know what you are talking about you die I have a friend who was like that he told he was all-powerful and he used to go to these shrines to win pray he said he was battling them spiritually to destroy their power that's all I he did they call it prayer genies living went as far as the pyramids of Egypt where pre day that's a symbol of idolatry and he started venturing out to my region to win pray Chris just died tight like a slain like excuse my language like a dog just started having some back pain and he went to every hospital he couldn't be dead what it was he just died but you better know what we are talking about when William Brandt got to Bombay and you know the story of the blind man that the man that was blind from what sheep in the Sun he told a story about a man I was blind from worshiping the Sun and he challenged the muhammadans my god because in the vision that his God could make this man who he said look if you can come it's like Elijah in the professor bow if you can come and make this man who I believe your God so I stand here calm I said they said no one can do it you know they were already in a crowd because before them by Brahma I've seen a vision and a vision told him that there will be three hundred thousand people at a meeting to be a him as far as his eye scoffs it was that's seized of people said come heal him none of them came and when he prayed and God had his prayer and God open the eyes of that person it's not Ramu did it God made no distinction when God open the eyes of that man what do you think those people would do they run in your tassles to the altar to assert that God the God who open the eye of the blind hallelujah brethren well problem go to Durban South Africa when he go to South Africa and Southern Africa Tanganyika in these places that he went at a time LeBron go there and the African natives came and they were holding idols muha Brahm said we have been sending missionaries to these people for years and they came and they packed the idols one of them he mean stop and ask him why is he still carrying the idol he told him how the idols save him from a lion attack before and that if if he's carrying me because if God feels this one who know filled why because they were taught the gospel of tracks they were taught the psychic side of the gospel let me read let me read this to you in life story 54 amen they read the gospel of tracks is what has gone around the world but this gospel of the kingdom must also go around the world if it doesn't happen the end you know come he said this gospel of the kingdom must go around the world look at how Brabham put it he said in a message life story she said oh no let me read first one he did commissioned us to preach the gospel to all the world and one third of the world is all does head about Jesus but after all person trust is not preaching the gospel Oh hallelujah it doesn't mean the passing tracks is wrong I mean I hope you are mature enough to understand it hallelujah the gospel came not in word only said Paul but true power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost brethren this is what is lacking in today's Gospel and I'm saying that just as in the beginning God brought the gospel in power and demonstration of his way to make a distinction between the Jews and the true believers in this end time before rapture he must do the same hallelujah I say in this end time before a rapture he must do the same but because I know something in the Bible and I always question myself till I found the answers in brother Browns message you know brahbrah mean sub from 1960 instead he started questioning himself why is it that all the revived a revival that he used to have in the 50s and the 40's why's that those things are not happening again before God told him that the revival was over hallelujah and now that we understand by the message that when Jesus Christ came Jesus Christ had a revival among the Jews the whole population both Jews and Samaritans there were SWAT Reviva when he fed the five thousand the five thousand were not only believers and followers of his message because at the time that Jesus Christ finishes mission three half years and he was living he had made only 120 converts that's how hard the heart of - the Lord the creator himself dwell in a body came to this egg and it will have three and a half years after raising the dead after healing the sick after cleansing the leper after making the lame walk after stopping the blood issue of twelve years and after all that 120 that's how hard of moneys in name amen so when I come here and I mean this is not a packed place something that rejoices my heart I don't have always in my life belong to small churches it's not my choice I didn't choose that way but in my search for the truth I've always found that the truth is hidden in very small little places when nobody assets I've been to big churches before don't get me wrong and these I go there and I don't find the truth day hallelujah so beloved Jesus Christ came to this earth and when he was living amen small number of people of course after Pentecost the animal was added to but still during the minority so when he came and preached the Jews preached the four thousand preach the multitude and a lot of people were there when he was crucified amen that ended the revival for the Jews get a physically that and then what the revival for the Jews but the revival of those who believed on him started after Pentacles are you getting it so all was of apologies because they have rejected the message but for those who believe Jesus when he came they revived I was yet to start but I believe that the same thing is repeating in this end time but Abraham came and preached to hundreds of thousands he healed hundreds of thousands of thousands hundreds of thousands I don't know the number by the way meaning you know the testimonies but by 1960 the Pentecostals died he came to have rejected him there were no more moving with him he said his teaching his doctrine was wrong so they had rejected him but the small group that accepted him just like the smoked guta accepted Jesus Christ amen that small group must move on to pentacles what for for the rapture same pattern are you getting it so all the world can not see another revival are you getting it the world will never see another river because every they'd miss their hour of visitation just like Israel miss her hour of visitation so the world miss her our visitation the purifier came down again and they rejected it that is why brother Brown preach the message indictments spinach the cancer in a they can't see any revival again but listen the bride of Jesus Christ does a little group that will remain faithful to the message that the Prophet brought the group is promised a revival tour rapture so same pattern same pattern hallelujah let me give you another coat he said in a message Great Commission said Jesus said into all the world these signs are followed and the gospel come not in word only but true power and manifestation of the Holy Spirit the same taught the Bible said they went for preaching everywhere the Lord working with them with signs following hallelujah but I've already told you that science can follow you without a giver because the disciple started signs that they're following the disciples before Pentecost so science following you it's not an invitation that you had The Giver you must go on and be sure Rob Ram said it is when you can say Amen to every word of God when every word of God does and Kobol cannot reject it so wait is that when I advise you when I want to advise you amen and your heart to reject it then there's something wrong when I tell you that the Prophet says this is wrong that is wrong or when pasta tells you or valetroy tells you and you in your heart you reject it there is something wrong it means that give us no day because the give is there I can't tell you something from the bronze message and you throw it away and you go on and do it anyhow and live anyhow because the the most difficult people to preach to our people that are seen signs and wonders in their life I have a friend like that on campus because he's a preacher he preaches and see signs and wonders if you tell him anything about this message take it but God cannot reject it oh wait is that button or jet is on wait so if something is in the word and you are told and you reject it it means there is a lacking day so you have to go hide yourself in a corner and pray so that in comes if God is inside if God is important a heart if their word because in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God so if God sees you they Wed must be you and if you hear the same way you'll be excited Oh hallelujah even baby and Oh hallelujah John the Baptist's in a womb of Elizabeth hallelujah because he was filled with that spirit right from the inside of them of the mother when Jesus went Mary went a Oh hallelujah and Mary just greeted hey the baby lived for joy but every child of God that the Word of God is uncle in his heart when he hears the word of God would live for joy you not dispute the Word of God Oh hallelujah he will rejoice I hearing the Word of God he will be happy on hearing the Word of God but when the pastor preaches in Europe you FRA amazing reject them believe this something is wrong hallelujah I said something is wrong she stopped right I want to see all of you when we cross over I don't want anybody to be left behind including myself I'm working out my own salvation with fear and trembling but all these useless certificates we are parent who come to not if at the end our souls who perish I'm not saying don't go to school when this message first came to Africa those were their wrong things that we're teaching the people women were made to quit their jobs amen I knew who I was who had a very decent job and she was so like I must know why she quit her job the husband couldn't take care of her she had to be carrying carrying stuff on her head and self to make a living I'm not a fanatic I believe the message of God but I believe in dividing it right amen so I'm not saying school is bad but I'm saying that if you go to school and you become rich you become successful in this well they did I died those certificates will not go with you nobody will remember the world will continue as if it really exists what matters is where your soul is going that's what matters because you are going to account to God if you are not ready to account to God you'll be in trouble my brother the swamp man who lived in recent time that saw him and he saw paradise amen all the same dimension whatever I want to call it and Abram said ma what he saw in hell a literal fire resource that I imprisoned he said a literal fire Benny you it's better than all he saw this and I told you the last time that all these pains that we put on our faces those are the people he saw in hell and he saw the same people in JC Penney in Jeffersonville one of them so the same people with all these green stuff eyes but the good news to us is that he also went into that dimension where the sins are he said there's no word in the English language that can describe that he said there's no way he said if you say it's beautiful it's an understatement if you say so blind is an understatement if you say it's pathetic another statement so there's no way I can describe it toss this toss it was beyond perfect it was beyond beautiful it was beyond sublime Oh hallelujah pasta hot eyes have now seen what years have no head what has no he ain't dead in two months thoughts that's what God has prepared for his children can God make mistake so why can't we this joy temporary joy we read in the Bible that Moses where you it refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter chose to suffer affliction with the children of Israel Ranade enjoyed the pleasures of sin for a season but us seems pleasures is only for a season I've watched some of the so called beautiful women of the world miss Luxx Miss Universe see when you grow old my wrinkled bodies say who wants this play game all that fame is only for a season plastic surgery upon plastic surgery will do now a time will come when he cannot help you again it meant you fall under the weight of care very successful people Steve Jobs when he had cancer he was dying the Apple Empire couldn't help him you ready specimen is that when he was left and Loan they're dying he realized that all the years he's playing North sleeping and thinking about how to be successful successful successful it all counted to not he wish he had done things differently by then it was too late and I will know the truth we know the truth work hard I'm not saying to me work hard work hard try for success but beyond oh let the Bible let the message be your guide believe in it for in each you have life in it you have a treasure and no other passing us hallelujah then we give you another coat he said I'll be closing shortly he said look if the church I say this with respect if the church can produce tons produce no more than reading writing and arithmetic and the psychic sight of the gospel the Indians are finished now sell you this alien the Indians like the natives of Africa has got to see the power of God in demonstration hallelujah sea beans you've been sending missionaries over there for 15 years in Africa and when they're supposed to be Christians come they was packing little mud Idol under their arm why the missionary told them why about healing they go healing out of the idol not true the idol true God God wink at their endurance you see we people were ignorant so the more something to represent God as long as it is sincerely what allow you to happen he we are there in ignorance but when he come to a place where he has to be healed the missionary said oh those things their days are past we got that in the seminary see they ain't no such thing as that well he carried his and all for healing so brethren this gospel of the kingdom now we have the means to spread it ray bram said before the first Pentecost three things happened one a unified Empire but then the whole known world was under the Romans so it was easy to move about and spread the gospel then they had this developed a system of rules then they have and language I was come on to almost the whole known world at the time Greek Greece is it Greek or Greece or horrible Akali the language of the Greek people yeah so these treaties came together to create a perfect condition for the word to go around the first time now what about this end time the world almost has a universal language English right most people who speak or if you go to Europe almost everybody speaks English even though they have their own local languages in Africa I mean telling people that it's very easy for you to meet a French person who speaks English by difficult for you to come together I met a guy named who speaks French right so a lot of people speak English Chinese I lamien English Indian speak English these are the two most focused on is this at a populous countries of the world they all speak English so we have a language almost a universal language to spread the gospel even even that we are translated the Bible into all languages now even our own local African languages we have transferred translated a Bible now we have the modern means of communication there news horses back then amen we have the highway system in America in many other countries now we can reach every remote part of the world we have the aeroplanes that is travelling crisscross in the world now we have the jumbo jets we have formerly food travel from America to Europe you have to stay on the ship for like a month or two all right now you don't have to do that now we do five hours you can fly from New York and you are in London Heathrow now how I should fly from New York in a crackdown on my country so we have the means the modern means are spreading the gospel then God has added something else God has added technology amen formerly if I want to preach before the cable was made this app that we use for a message now before there was internet in the 90s before you cannot easily you could easily access internet in Ghana if you wanted to search messages to treat you have to have tons of books and that books don't have table of contents you don't have anything to be read in underline things and writing things down but now I can just go I give you a good then I read so we have the perfect condition for another time when this gospel of the kingdom must go forth in power and Brabham say to only be a short time hallelujah are we following so brethren let me wind up so the gospel of power is a kind of gospel we to be witnesses of a men as it was at Pentacles now for you as I said earlier for you to be a witness of that gospel you must first be qualified so don't venture out without authority now let me tell you what I was they were in the Bible the way people who ventured out without authority in acts 19 the Bible talks about the seven sons of Seaver they had helped Paul preached Paul cast out demons Paul pray for the sick say wow that's power we also how did he do it when he prays he mention and nib Jesus okay we also go pray mess in the name of Jesus and when we mention it seemed to happen see you were trying to steal the copyright kept those patent on Latino and they were trying to steal it so they went without a copyright authority they went anyway exercising it the demon taught them into pieces there was this lady Indiana who Pentecostal when the missionaries from America came and all these Pentecostal charismatic movements that telangana in the 70s and 80s she went out to believe in the sheer power demos so this boy who was a friend of his the boy I don't know the relationship that existed between she and a boy but the boy was having cement a problem and she thought she could pray for the boy she went there before she could say Jack the boy was on her trying to make love to her brother you have to have it before you venture out go to them that is a secret go to them don't venture out without authority if you venture out without authority you'll be defeated I see when they're trying to access to to to cast out demons and she was embarrassed but for some friends were around to rescue that you have in embarrassed reverie I first believed this message I went for a funeral an old man had died in my my hometown I went for the Fuhrer and when I went for the funeral I was asked when somebody dies in Ghana we know might have something we call wick keeping we keep wick meaning that we stay very late into the night singing and maybe having a chaser busy on other person so at a way keeping I was asked to preach so I preach I told I testified our hot I've now found out and how the things that our fathers worship were evil so they should throw those things away I come and follow the true God I just testified of what has what I found that has changed me why I don't live like them anymore so the following morning one of my cousin's an older cousin he sent for me he was a cousin but a divvy I don't have any link with him I don't communicate so I was suspicious so I asked the lady who came and told me and this is a true story as the lady who came and coffee are you sure that who is calling me you say yes so I went when I went to me he lives in a small madhouse I'm at hat he told me that oh I mean as his brother and I'm you know cousins but we call ourselves brothers so as his brother living in a big city just one day to have my phone number those were the days this was in 2003 those were the days when mobile phones had just come everybody was using mobile phones in Ghana so I was having about three different mobile phones in my hand belonging to other people who came for the funeral so he saying he does needed my number but I was suspicious something something to be and upright so I told him I did he have a pain I didn't have the means of giving him the number so he entered his room and brought out a pen and a book and gave to me to write the number on so I gave him my number after I give him the number I couldn't write it behind I just had severe pain in my hand I couldn't write I know you don't understand what I'm saying now when you venture out one day you lot when you when you went out one time where Abraham was in Germany to preach we brother agam right and they were and I can't wait he's before he could start speaking 15 which doctors came that he wanted to talk to him that this territory was deer territory and he had come to their territory without their permission so he wanted to talk to him bragging rights and the other brothers supah abraham said no do not allow them to talk to around then they also vow that the meeting would not be held so they divided themselves into the four corners of the canvas tent where we having a meeting you know the story I think it's him he dies greater he that is in you or something like that I forgot in the title of the message they started they are enchantment they were chanting father son Holy Ghost Bravo's making a son if you listen to the tape father son Holy Ghost who father son Holy Ghost who death suddenly there was a storm there was thundering storm the tent was being judged I pray Lord you sent me to step he prayed the whole atmosphere just clicked and when he cleared people rushed over to give their lives to God what did the odd minute they saw the power in the demonstration of the gospel so I couldn't write my hand was so I told my singing brother who is also a reverend minister with one of the pentacle such edges and we started praying about it we prayed for about three weeks then the pain ceased so this happened in October so I travel back to our craft my siblings were that's teasing me so I'm so fearful by they don't think that it was anything so in December I went back to the village because my mother lives there so it makes me I've really frequent the place so I went back there to see my mom for the end of year so when I went back the following morning the first person I met was dumb and so when I met him we are relatives yeah we come from the same grandfather it's a great grandfather so I walk towards him and I wanted to greet him say oh my brother how are you my straight fold my hand and when I stretch my hand he gave me his elbow so he gave me his elbow then I said hey so I realized that his whole hand had been bandaged in help his hand this father had he had used a lot of hepzibah need a hand I said what is wrong with your hand they said there is something I don't know how to say it in English but I say it's Kaka Kaka is like some just a saw Hanna saw that that spreads like it's a form of cancer by it's not malignant so nothing has spread over the same place that was having the pain so worried our peppers for me and since then dama doesn't talk to me and he never he took my number he never called me nothing so God confirmed my suspicions that hey who is this small boy to come and preach to us in because he's the man I don't man and he's the main I dog killer in the town so he wanted to prove that as this man got a goose so if you venture out there they are going to preach this gospel without authority I'm going to face the enemy's defense attorneys they who cross exam you where are you i cannibal witness or not but I see my battle with comedy and there I wasn't gonna last you all know that I came back in me in January my mother was baptized and she died in February we witnessed all that so when I went home I saw them I was driving in my car and I saw them walking by the roadside with all that religion so I stopped the car and when I saw the car they came I was Crittenden when I was greeting them I saw that he put his hand on my kind was chanting yeah tell you he has not given out the fight I've done nothing to him nothing just the mere fact that I proclaim and I testified to be a Christian and I had simplified one I don't join them in the our drunken parties and there are sex parties he wants to I mean he won't also find a way of spiritually destroying me or something I don't know he did that I drove to our cry when I was going to I cried the car give me a lot of problem on a week when I go to a crowd then I was continuing to where I was which was 600 kilometres from a craft had a nasty accident on the way I did in front of me the car does v8 into my apartment I just run we not not even a cat so baby I'm saying this and I've given an example in the Bible about the seven sons of silver that if you go out there as a true witness of God they see that demons can make a difference Seppo we know Jesus we know but you who are you so if we don't have what you are talking about that they must know whether you have it or you don't have it bring that it was a servant of God you must never let down the ammo like this guy that I'm having this encounter with in my country he's did it once it didn't work he didn't give up after how many 20 2003 to do 15 years later he tried it again he nearly had me because I took it for granted I just thought that I didn't even really like the first time when it happened and I prayed I really prayed about it this time I did I guess I do it's not gonna happen though protected me but I spoiled it I destroyed the car in him so brethren when Jesus was living he told them to go into the world to become his witnesses and it applies to us today we must go into the world and become his witnesses witnesses not of tracks not a psychic not of theology the witnesses of the power gospel don't go unprepared amen because the maniac of Ghaderi is dead waiting for you the bull is there waiting for you know where Abraham was crossing that field to Grand Prix for a sick person and I Buddha has killed some people before the bull is worth waiting for you the maniac of Portland Oregon is waiting for you remember the story when I maniac wanted to destroy a brand they say you are fake and I want to prove to these people that you are fake hallelujah Carranza he wasn't afraid of him everybody thought that Robin was good we know he's a small man everybody was gonna be destroy but your physical size doesn't matter it is what is in that body it is what is in our body amen the witch doctors of Africa and of Germany of India the Muhammadans are witching you better have it they meant and if you are true witness God is going to stand by you so make sure that you come out prepared David came out prepared he had an experience his testimony was in a lion and a bear he said this was second sight Philistine this Philistine with other Holy Ghost coming to challenge the army of God that is supposed to have the Holy Ghost unfortunately being led by a backslidden King what we have to prove that there is still a God in Israel so if you are a true witness I'm saying God is going to back you if you know what you are talking about God is going to back you amen Alleluia even God backed Moses did he back him because Moses had met him Moses was sure his talk was talking about Moses was sure he saw a bush that was on fire by the bush was not being consumed he was sure that a voice spoke to him from the bush sure of it so when he went out there and painted Pharaoh's Palace God was duty-bound to back him very poor knew what he was talking about so when he went out there to the cities of Asia and throughout all of the known world at that time Greece and so many places when you went to those places I was preaching I was casting out Devils he knew what was Tandy know and God but him no one knew that God had instructed him to build a back and God back him amen I said God back him so did we didn't venture without authority you would have been killed it's not as a foolish feet you know people people just people have what we call some people exercise distance before and they just die hope and no fate a cousin of mine was diagnosed with hiv/aids in Ghana I didn't know at the time that that's what she was diagnosed with and she was sent to a prayer camp and in the prayer camp she was asked to do too fast for 21 days the sick person who have you ever seen a sick person don't go to grab remember Abraham see were fast for 21 days for your sickness to be healed if the person could help himself we have come to you so she so she was asked to fast for 21 days so at the end of any one days I met her father and hey do a driving and I was somewhere we just bump into each other somewhere in a crack and say who is in a car who is lying on the seat they say oh that's very own cousin you know oh yeah but she's changed he said no she just went for a 21 big fast I said I said to do a 21-day fast my brother she died HIV some immune disease your immune system is weak so if your immune system is weak why do you go for another 21 days you to kill you so you see people who are you see doctors why in hospital who don't know how to mean diagnosable I mean they are giving wrong prescription unfortunately in our part of the world nobody takes this sin seriously and these deaths are not even investigated probably here that the operation who prescribed to anyone they first would have any right now he's supposed to be in jail hallelujah so Bradley a witness can give a report a speech if you go to a court any UI witness you can't go there and be saying that Abraham said Abraham said LeBron said is good but it must be backed by our own experience hallelujah Bram said is good right might be backed by our own experience if it's not bad by your own SPR given a reported speech that's actually part of the gospel maybe I'm saying is that we must move from the trilogy path to where God want us to be because the angel of God to the Prophet that this endtime Church is going to be a super Church saying hail will be the fullness of pentacles it says you go back to the bride she was at the beginning ready we must go back to the bride we're at the beginning where no Ananias and Sapphira could stand in the church just coming to declare their tights and they under declare tight yes because they lie to the Holy Ghost I do you know but her arm said that the days of Ananias and Sapphira will return before the rapture to the true church so if we are not saying that in a true church a true church is full of lies and lasts and all these of clean living and all these there's something wrong I mean we are getting close to there and it has to happen the cohort we've got now economic the rapture we've got something that I saw Steve in us that is healing the sick that is doing all the background saving because he had I said even with all the power he demonstrated say what we have not and not because the cohort is to come for the rapture should be higher than what Kim our Pentacles we are barometer what you have seen and prolly in me will be made manifest in the fullness of power said after a short quick demonstration on the Gospel the bride will be taken away hallelujah red rain this should be our cry I don't know what I'll speak to you again if I go back to Ghana but I'll be coming to church amen but this don't let this mess never forget this message that we must go back to the tentacles of the begin you must go back to the bright way at the beginning because we are Brahmins and the data will recognize who we are will be raptured but it's a lack of recognition that is what is creating the problem because we are betting with a kiss on this world and then we recognize that we are peculiar nation we had peculiar people a royal priesthood and then we are not just anything common in this world we are the bride we are going to live within the gate now outside the gate I mean the same Jews will be outside the gate the 144 thousand right of Christ Oh hallelujah hallelujah we'll be in the inner court for the gospel goes back we know the song go this a band Dantley able to deliver who to deliver God easy boo who abundantly boo to deliver those who trust we don't know that can we sing I am weak but how strong do you have it I want us to sing that
