[31:24] he read
[31:25] where the bottom of the sea
[31:28] there was no bottom to it
[31:43] because she knew he didn't have a bible
[31:47] and he said well i was just reading like
[31:49] the wish is this something wrong whether
[31:52] the ocean had no bottom to it
[31:57] and he said all i thought about was how
[31:59] my sins
[32:01] stay
[32:02] cast into the sea of forgetfulness
[32:05] and that was enough to inspire him
[32:10] so even though i'm going to take my time
[32:24] i told my wife i wasn't going to preach
[32:25] this morning
[32:40] [Music]
[32:47] [Music]
[32:53] let us turn to
[32:56] the scripture
[32:58] saint john 3.
[33:02] john
[33:10] saint john 3.
[33:20] and we're going to read a 16th verse
[33:25] jean-claude says
[33:26] and then we'll go to romans 8.
[33:31] and we'll read the 9th through the 16th
[33:33] verse there
[33:35] only
[33:36] says
[33:37] the word of god says
[33:39] according to saint john 3 16
[33:44] for god so loved the world
[33:46] and that he gave his only begotten son
[33:49] that whosoever shall believe in him
[33:53] should not perish
[33:54] but have everlasting life
[34:00] says
[34:10] let us turn to romans 8 now
[34:12] roman wheats
[34:26] yeah we begin reading at the ninth verse
[34:29] of that chapter
[34:33] i will not belong tonight this morning
[34:38] it may be the shortest message i've ever
[34:39] preached
[34:43] but we give all glory to god
[34:49] but ye are not in the flesh
[34:52] but in the spirit
[34:53] if so be that the spirit of god dwell in
[34:56] you
[34:57] now if any man have not the spirit of
[35:00] christ
[35:01] he is none of his
[35:03] pardon
[35:14] and if christ be in you
[35:17] the body is dead because of sin
[35:20] but the spirit is life because of
[35:23] righteousness
[35:28] acoustic
[35:33] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[35:35] jesus christ from the dead dwelleth in
[35:38] you
[35:39] he that raised up christ from the dead
[35:41] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[35:44] this by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[35:52] christ
[35:56] is
[35:58] therefore brethren we are debtors
[36:02] not to the flesh
[36:03] to live after the flesh
[36:11] for if we live after the flesh
[36:14] you shall die
[36:16] but if ye through the spirit do mortify
[36:18] the deeds of the body ye shall live
[36:29] for as many are led by the spirit of god
[36:32] they are the sons of god
[36:38] feasted you for ye have not received the
[36:41] spirit of bondage again to fear
[36:45] but ye have received the spirit of
[36:47] adoption whereby we cry our father
[36:51] paris
[37:01] the spirit itself beareth witness
[37:04] with our spirit
[37:06] that we are the children of god list
[37:12] unfounded
[37:13] amen let us pray
[37:15] heavenly father god
[37:17] we thank you for your grace
[37:36] in your name jesus christ we pray
[37:39] amen amen
[37:41] you may be seated
[37:44] we appreciate our brother charles
[37:45] interpreting for us
[37:48] our interpreter
[38:08] yeah okay okay yeah
[38:11] they don't know about these things i
[38:13] don't
[38:16] god is good to us
[38:21] just in testimony of the surgery that i
[38:24] had
[38:28] i was looking for god to completely give
[38:31] me a healing before the service
[38:37] yeah
[38:38] but instead
[38:40] he chose to do it his way
[38:45] and either way i'm pleased
[38:47] as you see satisfaction
[38:50] i expected pain and discomfort
[38:54] after the surgery
[38:58] i thought my eye was
[39:08] a matter of fact
[39:10] i can see better now than then
[39:25] and
[39:27] it doesn't work so much please
[39:28] unfunctionally placed a lot of stress on
[39:30] my eyes
[39:33] hallelujah
[39:34] good to us
[39:39] we'd like to entitle our message tonight
[39:42] or this morning
[39:44] the reason
[39:46] and the purpose
[39:54] as i spoke the last time
[39:58] i talked about brother branham and the
[40:00] vision that god gave him
[40:04] nobody could see
[40:08] what he was trying to get over to us
[40:12] right
[40:13] so we know by the grace of god
[40:17] that the vision that he left with us
[40:22] we must press into it
[40:26] brother branham talked about pressing
[40:27] into
[40:29] uh
[40:30] the vision of healing
[40:35] he said if you can see yourself here
[40:40] you need to walk into that
[40:44] and of course that that will take place
[40:48] the reason why i'm dealing with
[40:50] redemption
[40:55] because a lot of people don't even know
[40:57] what
[40:58] redemption is
[41:03] to redeem
[41:18] in other words you you gain back your
[41:20] own your property
[41:24] by way of payment
[41:29] we know that
[41:30] adam and eve sinned
[41:32] i don't
[41:49] but what was this all about
[41:52] first of all it was the love of god
[41:56] in in his expression of redemption is an
[41:59] expression of redemption we don't know
[42:01] what it's going to be like after
[42:04] we're redeemed
[42:06] and make heaven
[42:11] but paul said
[42:13] eyes have not seen amen
[42:28] the purpose
[42:44] because god has made that provision for
[42:46] us
[42:49] and that provision is to bring us back
[42:51] to that place from whence we fail
[42:58] i marvel at the position
[43:02] that a lot of christians hold
[43:04] uh right now
[43:08] position
[43:10] uh
[43:25] that means we are in the end times
[43:28] that means that god is getting ready to
[43:30] burn the earth
[43:33] that means it's shorter uh the time is
[43:36] much shorter than what when we first
[43:38] believed
[43:53] the seventh church age is over
[43:57] though it continues
[44:01] it does not continue for us
[44:05] because the message of the hour has
[44:07] brought us out of the seventh
[44:10] message
[44:15] a lot of people will argue with you on
[44:17] that
[44:20] but the reason why they'll argue
[44:23] it's because they have not seen the
[44:24] coming of the lord
[44:27] they don't understand uh in 1963 when
[44:31] those seven angels standed out of heaven
[44:33] in a comprehensive
[44:44] if you notice through studying the
[44:46] scripture
[44:48] and the things that brother branham said
[44:52] there was a point in time
[44:54] brother branham
[44:56] began to talk about the bride
[45:01] husband
[45:13] [Music]
[45:14] because that has all had already been
[45:16] established
[45:19] and you and i if you if we read the
[45:21] message
[45:23] brother branham talked about when the
[45:24] seals were open
[45:28] went to sleep
[45:45] and the cry
[45:49] you know
[45:50] isaac in the field
[45:53] she understands that this is a time of
[45:58] translation a man that she can no longer
[46:02] be influenced
[46:04] by the spirit of leia the season
[46:09] amazement
[46:12] people are still
[46:13] [Music]
[46:22] that god is calling for us
[46:25] to come to a place of perfection
[46:29] this is why you have all of these
[46:31] distractions
[46:34] we got distracted by the kovic
[46:37] now we've been distracted by the wars
[46:43] [Music]
[46:54] if you
[47:22] revelation 3.
[47:27] she can see clearly now
[47:29] she once was blind
[47:32] but now she sees me
[47:34] and so you and i must understand
[47:46] into the image in which he wants us to
[47:49] be
[47:54] can you see what god's trying to do with
[47:56] you
[47:57] he said if
[47:58] you could just say the father
[48:00] you must understand
[48:02] every trial
[48:31] don't sit down will you allow yourself
[48:33] to be distracted
[48:37] like peter was complete
[48:39] when jesus bade him to come
[48:43] he began to look at all the winds and
[48:45] the waves
[48:51] [Applause]
[48:59] even though he was walking on the water
[49:02] hallelujah
[49:03] your vision must change
[49:06] you must change from the natural
[49:10] to the supernatural
[49:12] hallelujah
[49:13] amen because what's happening with you
[49:15] right now
[49:17] you're literally walking on the waters
[49:21] hallelujah you're walking on leia
[49:25] hallelujah you're walking on all
[49:27] circumstances
[49:32] but the moment you fail to keep your
[49:35] eyes on jesus
[49:38] you will begin to sink
[49:41] hallelujah
[49:43] into the very place
[49:45] god ordained you to walk on top of
[49:49] jesus
[49:54] coming from the message
[49:57] god is his own interpreter
[50:02] is some proper enterprise brother banham
[50:04] says
[50:06] hallelujah
[50:08] just hold jesus
[50:20] the coming of the of the lord of the son
[50:21] of man loving the fifth dilemma the
[50:23] spirit of god
[50:25] would come upon the earth this way did
[50:27] you disunderscore the form of human
[50:29] beings
[50:31] now here brother branham is talking
[50:32] about
[50:34] the prophet you see
[50:36] he's talking about brother branham
[50:38] but you understand it doesn't stop there
[50:42] right right because now the prophet of
[50:44] god is gone
[50:47] where is the spirit of god now
[50:49] let's play the germans now hallelujah
[50:52] william branham was not a fake
[50:56] his his vindication
[50:59] or god's vindication
[51:02] in his life
[51:04] proved who he was
[51:19] so you and i must understand who's the
[51:22] we're not here to be church
[51:24] members
[51:26] it's a frightening thing
[51:28] for me
[51:30] it's a frightening thing for me
[51:32] to see the condition
[51:34] of
[51:48] the spirit that's living in you
[51:51] it's what it is
[51:53] it's defined in you
[51:56] no no matter how you confess with your
[51:58] mouth
[52:00] what you are doing to scare faith is
[52:16] and you're living like hell if we become
[52:18] unfair amen
[52:21] let me say that again that's my lady you
[52:24] cannot say
[52:26] you've come from heaven
[52:28] and you're living like hell if we become
[52:41] it's the way we use that word
[52:58] the
[53:15] and the bible says he whom the son is
[53:17] set free
[53:22] hallelujah hallelujah now if you're not
[53:24] free
[53:26] you still can be free
[53:29] now let's go on
[53:32] he said the spirit of god would come
[53:34] upon the earth in a form of a human
[53:36] being in in the form of human beings
[53:44] [Music]
[53:51] [Music]
[53:52] and would do
[53:54] the same thing that god did in the human
[53:57] flesh as sodom
[54:02] remember
[54:04] they were waiting for a promised son
[54:20] use abraham you like to reject
[54:30] isaac was basically the rapture okay
[54:33] the coming of the promises
[54:45] and the bible said she received strength
[54:48] from god
[54:52] now the mystery of the whole scripture
[54:54] is
[54:56] god said to abraham and sarah
[55:00] before isaac was born i'm going to visit
[55:03] you ivanka
[55:29] [Music]
[55:32] isaac showed up
[55:36] this is what the message is supposed to
[55:38] do to you
[55:40] i failed if you're not being changed
[55:44] hallelujah you will not receive isaac
[55:49] hallelujah hallelujah i understand
[55:52] as leia are the seals as we were
[55:59] we could not produce
[56:14] this is where rapturing faith lay
[56:18] within the message
[56:19] don't let me sign what brother branham
[56:21] told us
[56:22] we must lay in the presence of the sun
[56:27] hallelujah he didn't say
[56:40] amen
[56:45] acknowledge
[56:46] yourself
[56:48] as being nothing
[56:51] else
[56:55] see this message didn't come to just
[56:56] give you an intellectual
[56:58] understanding
[57:04] and when you see people
[57:08] amen in this message
[57:12] that still have a problem with hatred
[57:17] you need to be born again
[57:21] jesus was even able to love his enemies
[57:38] you must love your enemy they've
[57:39] admitted in me amen
[57:46] we we we must understand that this is
[57:49] not
[57:50] uh
[57:52] you can't one thing about love you can't
[57:54] fake it
[58:00] you you can't pretend
[58:03] and let me say like this one of the
[58:05] things that i hate the most
[58:17] literally gets next to my spirit
[58:30] and let me tell you something
[58:32] brother branham said it makes him sick
[58:34] too
[59:00] but let somebody in the church mess up
[59:08] we're still working we're still working
[59:10] and at the end of the day god will get
[59:11] victory in everything
[59:16] um let's move on continue
[59:22] let me back it up here
[59:27] right right after that
[59:30] you
[59:35] that was the last sign that sodom
[59:38] and abraham group saw before the
[59:40] promised son arrived
[59:50] that and now the church spiritual has
[59:52] come to that hour
[59:55] church the spiritual has come to that
[59:57] hour the spirituality
[1:00:30] and so when god speaks
