[26:03] in the name of the law say you got the
[26:33] power a man a man let us turn to Matthew
[26:38] 13 and we'll also come from Psalms 1
[26:44] Matthew 13 chapter and we'll read the
[26:48] 23rd verse glad to be in the house of
[26:55] the Lord by God's grace Matt through 13
[27:07] 23 but he that receiveth she's me but he
[27:15] that received seed into the good ground
[27:19] is he that heareth the word and
[27:21] understandeth it which also hid beareth
[27:27] fruit and bringeth forth psalm a hundred
[27:30] fold some sixty some thirty psalms one
[27:49] regaining it the first verse blessed is
[27:55] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[27:57] of the ungodly nor standeth in the way
[28:01] of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of
[28:04] the scornful but his delight is in the
[28:09] law of the Lord and his law doth he
[28:12] meditate both day and night and he shall
[28:17] be like a tree planted by the rivers of
[28:19] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[28:23] his season his leaf also shall not
[28:26] wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[28:31] prosper
[28:32] let us pray father we come before you
[28:37] Lord we thank you for the grace and your
[28:40] mercy we thank you for being so good to
[28:43] us we pray father God that you will
[28:46] bless this service strengthen us right
[28:49] now Lord give us grace and mercy father
[28:53] we thank you for everything we pray that
[28:56] you have preeminence here tonight in
[28:58] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may
[29:02] be seen it I told my grandchildren
[29:07] before coming that if they disrupt the
[29:10] service I'm gonna stop preaching and I'm
[29:13] gonna come and I'm going to discipline
[29:15] you do all you understand that's what I
[29:19] mean so we thank God for His grace we
[29:24] think God for His mercy I just want to
[29:28] give a thought tonight because it was
[29:30] such a blessing to me in the course of
[29:32] my listening to the restoration of the
[29:36] bride tree it was a lot so many things
[29:38] in that message that really it inspired
[29:41] me and encouraged me and and I just kind
[29:45] of God gave me a thought planted in him
[29:51] when we talk about something being
[29:54] planted we
[29:57] normally think about a flowerpot or
[30:01] whatever it may be but but soil ground
[30:04] you plant it in the ground you know
[30:06] especially when you you're planting
[30:08] something to grow that's the definition
[30:12] it means to put or set in the ground for
[30:15] growth as seeds or young trees and and
[30:20] when we plant it something in the ground
[30:24] we expect it to grow we look forward to
[30:26] grow we may even add some fertilizer and
[30:29] whatever it takes for that plant to grow
[30:32] we are expecting whatever by way of seed
[30:36] or by way of a little tree I forgot what
[30:40] they call them like a furling or
[30:41] something that's a little animal or
[30:43] thing but whatever
[30:44] whatever it is that's what we know we
[30:46] try to we do that but when I was
[30:50] thinking about god I just something
[30:53] opened up and and I just I could say
[30:57] like this I can't really grasp it it's
[30:59] just when I saw the vastness of God it
[31:04] was so great that my mind couldn't
[31:06] couldn't couldn't contain you know the
[31:08] thought because God is a spirit and
[31:12] oftentimes God
[31:15] he helps us out by saying you know
[31:18] planted in Christ but if you understand
[31:21] Christ you understand that this is God
[31:23] and you know we realized by God's grace
[31:28] the Bible tells us that there are those
[31:30] who are planted in good ground and the
[31:36] Bible said that they will bring forth a
[31:39] hundredfold 60 and 30 now you got to
[31:46] understand these people who bring forth
[31:49] 30 didn't decide they were going to
[31:52] bring 30 and the people who bring forth
[31:56] 60 did not decide with themselves that
[31:59] they were going to bring 60 and the ones
[32:02] who bring forth a hundredfold didn't
[32:06] decide within themselves that they were
[32:07] going to bring forth a hundredfold
[32:10] you and I must understand that these
[32:12] numbers were determined by God and each
[32:16] and every one of us have a different
[32:18] faith we have the faith of God but our
[32:20] faith is measured and God was the one
[32:24] who measured that faith to you before
[32:27] the foundation of the world I might be
[32:30] able to do something you can't do and
[32:31] you may be able to do something that I
[32:33] can't do for an example we look at
[32:37] brother Branham I would say he brought
[32:39] forth a hundredfold now I don't know
[32:42] what my foe will be compared to what he
[32:47] did throughout his ministry but but but
[32:50] you had to understand he was ordained
[32:53] every seed you know you find out that
[32:56] you know some people when they get
[33:00] married they they they plant seeds and
[33:03] some may bring forth two children and
[33:06] maybe that's all they can bring forth
[33:08] some may bring forth one then you got
[33:11] those who can bring forth ten and on up
[33:15] well those people did not determine that
[33:19] it was God who determined how many
[33:22] children they were going to have now I
[33:24] know we're dealing with modern things
[33:26] now but I'm saying you know back in the
[33:28] olden days when they were really feared
[33:31] God in a way in man perhaps may not have
[33:34] understood a lot of things the way we do
[33:36] now they were one through Warner
[33:39] children and couldn't produce children
[33:41] right but but I say all of that is to
[33:45] say that when we talk about being
[33:47] planted in God how can you not bring
[33:52] forth good fruit how can you not bring
[33:55] forth God how can you not bring forth
[33:59] what you need to bring forth right and
[34:04] you know we look at these things and we
[34:06] must understand by God's grace that we
[34:10] are planted in him and I want you to
[34:12] just meditate just think about that just
[34:14] for a moment we are planted in him
[34:20] all right Psalms
[34:22] one one two three says blessed is the
[34:25] man that walketh not in the counsel of
[34:28] the ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[34:31] sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[34:34] scornful for his but his delight is in
[34:38] the law of the Lord and in his law doth
[34:42] he meditate day and night and I want to
[34:46] say this to you you cannot do that
[34:48] unless it's in you to do it and when
[34:52] it's in you to do it it is not by your
[34:55] own ability right it's by God's ability
[34:59] you and I must understand that God is
[35:02] not let's put it this way properly
[35:05] brother Branham said that he is a
[35:07] gentleman God will give you something
[35:10] but he will never make you do it there
[35:14] must become there must first be a
[35:16] willing mind right and when there's a
[35:20] willing mind and God would bring it to a
[35:23] place where whatever you will to do for
[35:27] him in and his glory he will make that
[35:30] thing happen right now you take for an
[35:35] example it takes faith everybody wasn't
[35:38] a Benjamin Franklin Benjamin Franklin
[35:42] didn't ask for his scientific abilities
[35:45] it was a gift given from God and you
[35:49] know even though his gift was given from
[35:52] God at the time when he first began to
[35:54] do what God wanted him to do he looked
[35:57] totally insane right I think about the
[36:02] men who who literally built the
[36:05] automobile oh my if they could see what
[36:08] things have become now they would really
[36:10] get excited well think about the being
[36:13] who's that thought oh one day we will
[36:15] fly where the gift was in them but it
[36:19] wasn't given to everybody it was given
[36:22] to a certain group of men who caught the
[36:25] vision and they ran with it and guess
[36:28] what God anointed them you see God works
[36:32] with science it is
[36:35] is Satan's perversion but without
[36:37] science how could I sit this way God
[36:40] prophesied and certain things had to
[36:43] become what they are because the word
[36:46] said it would be you understand me
[36:50] God allows Satan amen or however you
[36:54] want to put it God allowed science to -
[36:57] to kind of like parallel itself with the
[37:01] word well the venom talked about the
[37:04] automobile and at the time where I think
[37:07] it was Wesley and all of the ones and in
[37:09] the airplane the Pentecostals and things
[37:11] like that and the horse and a buggy
[37:13] justification you know he goes on and he
[37:15] tells all these inventions ran neck to
[37:19] neck with what God was doing with his
[37:21] church and remember Joel said I shall
[37:24] restore saith the Lord we look at all of
[37:28] these scientific experience things that
[37:30] are happening now and and and and some
[37:32] of us came in grass a lot I used my
[37:35] phone is iPad I have no idea how it
[37:37] works if you try to explain it to me I
[37:41] still would know how it works because
[37:45] there is a supernatural element behind
[37:50] these things that most people don't see
[37:51] they see science but they don't see the
[37:54] supernatural part about it that that man
[37:58] can make an instrument that can
[38:00] literally transfer our data from this
[38:06] end of the world to that end in the
[38:07] world in a matter of seconds it just
[38:11] shows that the rapture is real if data
[38:14] can travel like that we can't do right
[38:19] because that data is just words
[38:23] scientific things that that that men
[38:26] have have allowed to form and shape into
[38:30] what we can a language we can understand
[38:32] and you know it travels and so you and I
[38:36] must understand that when God has
[38:38] planted us I love this I can't explain
[38:42] it I'm seeing something I've never seen
[38:43] before I can't even explain it but I see
[38:46] myself in this gray
[38:49] eat and vast is everything his love his
[38:57] pieces Joyce it's all of that I can't
[39:01] even explain it
[39:02] but I do know one thing in there if a
[39:06] man ever gets in there if he's ever
[39:09] planted in there you'll never die
[39:14] because remember just like water is the
[39:18] source of life for a natural tree God is
[39:21] the source of life or spiritual one and
[39:25] we have been we have been made in the
[39:29] natural image and in the scripture
[39:31] according to Corinthians 15:1 15 tells
[39:34] us that one day we're going to bear the
[39:36] same image but a spiritual image
[39:39] oh my and so we must understand that it
[39:44] is is important to be planted not
[39:48] sprinkled you understand me
[39:52] because prickling may not give you the
[39:54] necessary water you need to grow by but
[39:58] when you are planted that means you are
[40:00] berry you are covered and all of the
[40:03] nutrients of that work that's in that
[40:05] water finds its way into the seed or the
[40:09] life of the seed and it helps that see
[40:10] grow into a mature church a mature tree
[40:13] excuse me is that okay
[40:17] Joshua 24:13 you have to turn he says
[40:22] and I have given you a land for which ye
[40:25] did not labor and cities which you built
[40:29] not and he dwell in them of the
[40:32] vineyards and olive yards which he
[40:36] planted not do he eat and when I read
[40:41] the spirit judge all of a sudden I be I
[40:42] just got my mind just started thinking
[40:45] about God and all of the many blessings
[40:48] that God he is he
[40:52] you know I saw oh you know you want a
[40:54] house God has one you need a car
[40:58] God has one oh come on somebody
[41:02] everything you need is in God because a
[41:06] car could not be a car if it wasn't for
[41:08] God a house that we know of cannot be a
[41:11] house if it wasn't for God because God
[41:14] is the very creator of all things and if
[41:19] you channel yourself into God that is
[41:23] that how could I say it you draw
[41:25] whatever you need from God into yourself
[41:29] it's amazing what God has already done
[41:34] it's just so amazing that these things
[41:36] are laying right in front of our eyes
[41:37] it's like this dimension that I'm ready
[41:39] to travel through it's right here and
[41:43] I'm seeing that God is right here
[41:46] hallelujah
[41:47] somebody say man God is here
[41:50] first of all he said where two or three
[41:52] are gathered in my name there I am in
[41:54] the mist and God said I will never leave
[41:57] you nor forsake you he's here and we
[42:01] realized because of the message that
[42:02] probably God said God sees us just like
[42:07] radio waves travel through God is in
[42:12] this place but we forget but you know
[42:20] what all you got to do is keep connected
[42:25] right see electrical wires and outlets
[42:28] and all that you have to be careful how
[42:30] you handle that those things why because
[42:33] you can easily get a shock that could
[42:36] take you out here if you mess around
[42:38] with those wires in the wrong way in
[42:40] other words there's a-there principles
[42:42] there's the laws that goes with
[42:44] electricity and electricity is something
[42:47] that even science to this day cannot
[42:49] explain then I'll have a real definition
[42:52] front for it because they don't know
[42:54] what it is it's alive it's like fire
[43:00] they really don't understand fire fire
[43:03] is alive it's true
[43:08] get so happy when when
[43:09] win-win-win-win-win they they fire walks
[43:14] hmm we may not understand the language
[43:18] but fire talks
[43:21] yeah saw fire leaks it purifies it
[43:28] cleans oh come on
[43:31] because it is it's an element that we
[43:33] can see that we can relate or tie God
[43:36] into God is fire and the Bible said he's
[43:41] a consuming fire right so when we look
[43:46] at these things you and I must
[43:47] understand Amen that God has something
[43:50] that we must understand if we stay
[43:53] planted Romans six one through six says
[43:59] what shall we say then shall we continue
[44:02] in sin that grace may abound god forbid
[44:05] how shall we that are dead to sin live
[44:10] any longer therein no II not that so
[44:14] many of us as were baptized into Jesus
[44:17] Christ were baptized into his death
[44:20] oh we are buried with him by baptism
[44:23] into death let me say that again
[44:28] therefore we are buried with him by
[44:31] baptism into death that like as Christ
[44:35] was raised from the dead by the glory of
[44:38] the Father even so we also should walk
[44:41] in newness of life how can you be
[44:45] planted spiritually in God and not have
[44:48] a new life because the life and death
[44:51] cannot abide at the same time that was
[44:56] the whole thing about Calvary
[44:58] they took life and they tied him up
[45:01] nailed him to a cross him and that cross
[45:05] represented death life and death face to
[45:10] face but they could never abide in the
[45:13] same place he had to come off the cross
[45:16] because he was alive right and
[45:20] they took a Roman tree and tied the word
[45:23] to it you understand me and that's
[45:26] exactly what they've done today
[45:28] they've taken the word in a Roman tree
[45:31] denominations increase hallelujah and
[45:34] they want to pin Jesus down on the cross
[45:36] but I'm here today or tonight to say
[45:39] he's risen and he's alive and well
[45:44] hallelujah Jesus ain't on the cross no
[45:48] more hallelujah
[45:51] that was a cursed thing hallelujah and
[45:55] he was a curse for us you understand me
[45:59] he took our death that we could live now
[46:04] that he's arise he's arisen a menu and I
[46:07] can be planted in him I love this I love
[46:10] this because I see God in a way that I
[46:13] came him explain him I see God amen as
[46:16] everything nothing outside of him he
[46:20] just God and even though God in his own
[46:23] thoughts made what we see this is like a
[46:28] drop in the bucket if we can see how
[46:35] great he is we'd never feel how let me
[46:42] ask you a question
[46:42] if you had cancer and and he was an
[46:45] ocean ocean how can I say Lord our ocean
[46:50] of life and you could just plant your
[46:53] hands into that ocean and you connected
[46:56] and you know life always conquers death
[47:00] how can the cancer ever remain if you
[47:04] are plugged into life hello but my thing
[47:11] is this in your if the roots of your
[47:13] tree it's planted in this water
[47:20] tell me and all of the nutrients of that
[47:25] holy ghost water is not flowing through
[47:29] your roots the roots of your tree how
[47:32] can this tree not live
[47:36] hey because if God could take a dead rod
[47:40] and connect it with the fountain of life
[47:44] beyond behind the cow
[47:47] this should cut in there with the
[47:48] Shekinah glory is and how could that
[47:52] tree ever not bear or bird right it had
[47:58] to there wasn't a choice you see because
[48:04] you said what do you mean let me say it
[48:05] like this
[48:06] Jesus never went to a funeral he never
[48:10] preached a funeral everyone he met the
[48:14] man going down the street the one the
[48:16] girl - haven't all of them when like
[48:18] came hallelujah death had to flee just
[48:23] making that connection with him amen it
[48:27] just it's amazing I believe that if this
[48:32] thing keep growing on what I'm seeing
[48:34] I'm gonna be translated in a little
[48:36] while because there's no way that I
[48:40] could be seeing I can't give me what I'm
[48:43] seeing even now I cannot give this to me
[48:47] I didn't ask this I just asked God to
[48:49] bless the service but I believe with all
[48:54] my heart I mean that's what Jesus could
[48:57] never let's put it this way brother
[48:59] Branham said like that
[49:00] he lied John women to be a servant said
[49:07] Lord it is more than than than us you
[49:09] know and we're surrounded and then
[49:11] Elijah said don't feel because it's more
[49:13] them than you know y'all know what I'm
[49:16] saying and you know but brother then
[49:18] said he said it by faith he didn't see
[49:22] all those chariots but but by faith he
[49:26] did and if that Bible said that the
[49:29] angel the Lord is encamped about us we
[49:31] by faith
[49:34] believe that as though we can touch it
[49:38] because they are they really are here
[49:43] but you know what we let our natural
[49:46] senses dictate to us and your natural
[49:50] sense is not even you
[49:52] this whole body that ain't you if it was
[49:56] you God would take it to heaven
[50:01] hallelujah but nothing nothing this so
[50:03] corrupt be hybrid Amen I don't know what
[50:06] it's all mixed with but I know one thing
[50:08] it ain't nothing but a body of sin is
[50:12] that the Bible pulse at all who's gonna
[50:15] deliver me from this body of sin and
[50:17] death y'all want to call it something
[50:20] else that's what it is and you cannot
[50:23] expect sin and death to offer you
[50:26] holiness it ain't happening right but
[50:32] the real use on the inside of this thing
[50:34] I don't know how God is doing but I know
[50:37] one thing for certain that God intended
[50:40] for us to understand that we are planted
[50:43] in him and when you O Lord let me get
[50:46] that scripture we sometimes fail to see
[50:52] and I'm jumping a little bit but we fail
[50:56] to see there's a time for everything
[50:59] and I love this because you and I when
[51:02] we can see ourselves as being trees then
[51:04] we can understand you're gonna have four
[51:06] seasons in your life you're gonna have a
[51:08] spring you'll have a summer I went to in
[51:10] the fall and all of us know what fall is
[51:14] right that's why the boughs ADA just
[51:21] made fall several taps in a date and he
[51:23] gets up sometime I think I go over a
[51:26] little seven over seven you know what
[51:30] I'm a man this is flash the real me is
[51:35] inside is the only thing and I'm trying
[51:39] by God's grace to kill him every day he
[51:42] is my worst enemy he lies to me
[51:48] and all that you know you know you know
[51:53] he's one of those buddies you wish you
[51:54] could get rid of oh god help us Psalms
[52:01] 92 and 12 I'm coming in that scripture
[52:03] in just a moment I just want to take my
[52:04] time I get excited the righteous shall
[52:07] flourish like the palm tree he shall
[52:10] grow like a cedar in Lebanon those that
[52:14] be planted in the house of the Lord
[52:17] shall flourish in the courts of our God
[52:20] and when I thought about that as a
[52:23] hallelujah cuz I saw I saw this thing I
[52:26] said now God asked David what house are
[52:31] you gonna build me in other words can I
[52:34] be contained I feel all in all what
[52:41] house will be big enough for me but the
[52:44] Bible says those that be planted in the
[52:49] house of the Lord shall flourish in the
[52:51] course of our God planted and where is a
[52:59] couple somebody it's God and me guarding
[53:03] yoona and we are in God this God is so
[53:09] powerful brother it meant that he could
[53:11] not only just give me the Holy Ghost but
[53:13] he clothed me I don't understand that
[53:17] that there is a rogue that I'm wearing
[53:20] right now you can't see it but the devil
[53:23] can it's real why do it why is it like
[53:31] that because I am planted probably God
[53:38] talks about the pommel worm the
[53:40] cankerworm the locusts and the
[53:42] caterpillars and you and I we fail to
[53:44] see we're dealing with a four-stage
[53:45] animal devil how do you want to call it
[53:48] worm right and the first thing that
[53:52] thing do is come and he eat your love
[53:54] away he now comes at each oak each Oh
[53:58] praise away eat
[54:00] off your tree and bring you down to
[54:02] a stump y'all understand me
[54:05] and the only pesticide that can get rid
[54:08] of and mr. word it is a word that
[54:13] fortifies us it is a word that keeps us
[54:16] it is the word that makes every devil
[54:19] afraid to come in knock on your door
[54:23] don't you understand worms some of them
[54:27] can sense when sprayed has been sprayed
[54:31] pesticide that's why you get your
[54:37] collard greens and how beautiful and
[54:39] green nothing has chewed on them or
[54:42] anything somehow those bugs know that
[54:46] those greens have been fortified with
[54:50] something that will possibly will not
[54:53] possibly kill this the devil no
[54:59] definitely no joke you know
[55:01] and the devil understands who you are
[55:04] even though you may not know it and
[55:09] people will I don't know why I'm going
[55:12] through this trouble in this net oh my
[55:13] god you better be glad you being tested
[55:17] well if you're not gonna if you're not
[55:20] being tested water lucky you not even a
[55:22] son or daughter god you come to be tried
[55:26] and tested and what we don't understand
[55:32] is overcoming means exactly what it says
[55:35] overcoming that means before you
[55:38] overcome you are under come
[55:41] I understand me oh you gonna be a
[55:45] failure into God in his season you can't
[55:52] overcome in your own season no more than
[55:55] a baby tree can bring forth fruit even
[55:59] though all the life is in that tree to
[56:02] bring food feet forward it cannot to the
[56:06] season is right
[56:09] hello you understand me
[56:13] it's like all the children do I can't
[56:16] wait to get 18 right it's in them if
[56:20] they live continue to live they go get
[56:23] 18 and 50 mall net and as long as God
[56:27] give them grace ago you don't say but is
[56:30] a desire it is something in those
[56:32] children that wants to be an adult so is
[56:37] it with us those of us who are children
[56:39] of God there's something on the inside
[56:41] of us makes us say oh I came how to wait
[56:45] to God bring me to perfection but God
[56:49] planted the tree I've seen apple trees
[56:53] and some apple trees they've got so many
[56:56] fruit on it's the same seed now until
[56:58] they all hung down then you got this
[57:00] apple tree just barely got anything on
[57:02] it what is it and you fail to say well I
[57:06] want to do more for God God say okay
[57:09] you've got these things that need to be
[57:10] proved oh boy we don't like when God
[57:17] takes the sword and cut them things off
[57:19] and you forget it was your prayer cause
[57:22] you said Lord I want to be more like you
[57:24] oh Jesus Lord and he knows he knows God
[57:33] knows the exact moment that you go get
[57:36] up one day talk totally victorious if he
[57:45] knows how many time a bet or fly or flee
[57:49] bets his I don't you know he knows all
[57:51] about you you he planted you you didn't
[57:57] plant to himself Oh Lord I decided to
[58:00] get baptized only because the grace of
[58:02] God told you to all of that is God you
[58:08] can't save yourself God saves you he's
[58:11] the keeper of the soul that's why we're
[58:14] not supposed to easily judge other
[58:15] people because we don't know what God is
[58:18] working out no you don't know you know
[58:24] like
[58:24] probably God said he said when it came
[58:26] to Jacob and Esau he said it was Jacob
[58:28] Jacob excuse me he said he saw was the
[58:32] one that looked good
[58:34] he was he was daddy's servant did
[58:36] everything cook him some good grubs and
[58:38] all that and he said Jacob was always a
[58:40] side shyster ooh but it's the inside
[58:45] that God is looking at the seed that he
[58:49] planted in you before the foundation of
[58:52] the world why am I saying this because
[58:55] when the Bible town says blessed is the
[58:57] man that trusteth in the Lord and whose
[59:00] hope is in the Lord it in me it ain't in
[59:04] the preacher it ain't in the bishop
[59:06] nobody is in God for he shall be like a
[59:11] tree planted by the waters and that
[59:14] spreaded out her roots by the river and
[59:17] shall not see when that coming but her
[59:19] leaf shall be green and shall not be
[59:22] careful in the years of drought neither
[59:24] shall cease from yielding fruit in other
[59:28] words those who are anchored in Christ
[59:31] those who are planted in him do not
[59:34] experience and not afraid if the
[59:36] preacher don't preach what they need why
[59:40] are they already nourished they don't
[59:43] worry about it man be the Villar how
[59:46] could I say it a drought hallelujah
[59:53] a real believer fees themselves
[1:00:00] he didn't preach what I need and I want
[1:00:03] to tell people some God he didn't preach
[1:00:05] what you need didn't tell me something
[1:00:06] wind it allows you read you read ha
[1:00:12] young history when you say that when you
[1:00:16] know people felt fair to see that when
[1:00:18] they say well the preacher you put it on
[1:00:19] the preacher it shows you still a baby
[1:00:21] you still won't survive in the spoon
[1:00:24] feed you but you supposed to come come
[1:00:27] to church with a hey man Lord I don't
[1:00:30] already taste some of that already
[1:00:32] ah amen I don't read I study you got me
[1:00:35] and our we're on the same a car
[1:00:40] is this okay
[1:00:41] we're planted that means I want to be
[1:00:44] buried so nobody can see me and that
[1:00:47] life of God comes right up my roots
[1:00:51] because if we allow God to saturate us
[1:00:55] like that water would a tree in us and
[1:00:57] it's a root you don't have to worry
[1:01:00] about it because there is a law is that
[1:01:05] right there is a law and the law is this
[1:01:08] God is going to pull it up he's going to
[1:01:12] take that water in the roots and pull it
[1:01:15] up that tree I was gonna I was going to
[1:01:19] entitle this the Sun the resurrection of
[1:01:21] the Sun because that Sun has a law
[1:01:25] behind it
[1:01:26] that no matter where the seas are it
[1:01:30] duty is to pour that life up because the
[1:01:37] Sun itself is the resurrection in this
[1:01:40] natural without that there is no
[1:01:43] resurrection in the natural young you
[1:01:46] understand what I'm saying so that law
[1:01:48] that God that's why she says I am the
[1:01:51] resurrection if you're the body go to
[1:01:54] get up if anybody's going to mature I'm
[1:01:57] the Sun I'm the one that will bring you
[1:02:01] to maturity till you can't bring
[1:02:07] yourself to maturity it's God that
[1:02:09] brings you to maturity that's why the
[1:02:12] Bible said is not him that weird no he
[1:02:14] that rugged but God that showed mercy
[1:02:16] and I thank God for a prophet of God in
[1:02:20] the message that we have to know that I
[1:02:22] am I'm not gonna struggle Amen well Lord
[1:02:25] am I going to make it no I've already
[1:02:26] made it Wow because I'm planted in him
[1:02:30] you understand me and just like he could
[1:02:33] not die I can't die because the same
[1:02:36] source that kept him is the same source
[1:02:38] that keeps us
[1:02:40] wool hallelujah stir truth is the truth
[1:02:44] is the truth and when you planting in
[1:02:47] Christ amen for many of you have been
[1:02:50] baptized into Christ have put on on no
[1:02:54] y'all know what put him on like taking
[1:02:57] this off and put that means you wearing
[1:02:59] him hallelujah I was up there that day
[1:03:05] at the hobby the other day and and they
[1:03:07] had this guy you know he was dressed
[1:03:09] like Batman he was a proud young man and
[1:03:12] you know I thought he might be one of
[1:03:15] them friends of Mines associates that
[1:03:17] hadn't seen a long time so I had to make
[1:03:19] myself I had to go up there to look in
[1:03:22] his face cuz I was ready for a good
[1:03:27] laugh if it had been a friend of mine I
[1:03:29] would have left but you know it wasn't
[1:03:32] him but my point is some reason the guy
[1:03:37] looked like he was overtaken by that
[1:03:40] conscious thought costume he was
[1:03:44] overtaken and I thought you're not
[1:03:49] really thinking you Batman are you but
[1:03:57] you know it's in the same sense that
[1:03:59] that man could get out and probably
[1:04:02] dressed in that what about us there is
[1:04:09] no costume that we can put on like to
[1:04:12] express Jesus but we got the Holy Spirit
[1:04:16] and that Holy Spirit is supposed to
[1:04:18] reflect Christ so much to people can see
[1:04:21] us like I saw that man right cuz one day
[1:04:24] he even had a Batmobile out there but
[1:04:31] it's just something I don't know what
[1:04:32] he's he's working on his own or what but
[1:04:35] the point is he's overtaken if we love
[1:04:40] Jesus like that can you imagine the kind
[1:04:44] of results we would get but that's what
[1:04:49] I planted being planted being
[1:04:53] planted and understand this when you
[1:04:56] planted in Christ there's seasons that's
[1:04:59] going to come and make you flourish you
[1:05:04] into doing it is him he's gonna make you
[1:05:08] flourish is that right
[1:05:10] come on I know some of y'all have seen
[1:05:12] trees that looks so dead so you thought
[1:05:16] no this thing must be dead at the root
[1:05:17] and then here comes spring that thing is
[1:05:20] living again but it is it never died it
[1:05:24] kept its strength in the roots see what
[1:05:28] I'm saying what I'm saying is the
[1:05:30] seasons will come
[1:05:31] well you can't praise God like you won't
[1:05:34] him won't - you may not scream you mean
[1:05:36] that shout and all you can look like as
[1:05:38] a dare treat but there's something on
[1:05:41] the inside of you that will always keep
[1:05:44] you alive no matter how bad the weather
[1:05:48] gets that life is in the root and in his
[1:05:52] all season his season not yours
[1:05:56] his season he'll make that life come
[1:05:59] back up it has to that's the law that's
[1:06:06] a law of nature that's the law of God
[1:06:11] first John is what I love he said first
[1:06:14] John three eight through ten says he
[1:06:16] that committeth sin is of the devil for
[1:06:18] the devil sinneth from the beginning for
[1:06:23] this purpose the Son of God was
[1:06:24] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:06:26] works of the devil now understand sin is
[1:06:29] unbelief sinneth is to continue to UM in
[1:06:33] disbelief
[1:06:34] you're not that you overcome us that
[1:06:38] means I have fallen maybe because of a
[1:06:41] little doubt but I'm going to overcome
[1:06:42] this doubt I'm going to overcome this
[1:06:45] fear because we are overcomers
[1:06:48] we're not sinners and and we do not
[1:06:51] commit sin that's the Bible and
[1:06:57] whatsoever
[1:06:59] one of God does not commit sin why cuz
[1:07:04] he's great
[1:07:05] oh the Bible says for his seed remaineth
[1:07:09] in him and he cannot sin because he is
[1:07:12] born of God
[1:07:15] she is the seed that God looks at and
[1:07:19] I'm trying to hurry but it look like I
[1:07:21] can't move fast enough is to see that
[1:07:23] that that that that that God looks at
[1:07:26] when he you and God become Union that
[1:07:32] right you heard me say this before you a
[1:07:36] tree cannot produce tree without one
[1:07:39] being male and the other one female uh
[1:07:42] y'all got to know that and then they do
[1:07:47] this pollination thing and then the
[1:07:48] seeds come and they may you know so you
[1:07:54] saying brothers what are you saying it
[1:07:56] would not have but good if Jesus had
[1:07:58] come and had not a female part he would
[1:08:04] not have been able to produce his
[1:08:06] children Adam had to have Eve you know
[1:08:11] female part to produce we got Christ
[1:08:16] Himself Jesus himself and what is that
[1:08:19] bit that he didn't even get married
[1:08:21] because it wasn't the natural part that
[1:08:24] God was looking at he was coming with
[1:08:26] spiritual yes what on the day of
[1:08:33] Pentecost the female part was in place
[1:08:38] hallelujah all of a sudden people get
[1:08:41] excited about twins and triplets and he
[1:08:43] had a hundred and twenty one shot one
[1:08:47] time right oh he goes on to say you and
[1:08:55] I must understand this this whole ocean
[1:08:58] of God if I can say like Lord for the
[1:09:01] time said just like getting a little
[1:09:02] teaspoon out of the ocean so I'm using
[1:09:03] that word ocean just trying to describe
[1:09:05] because ocean if you're standing on the
[1:09:07] land there's no end to it you can't see
[1:09:10] the end or the opposite the other side
[1:09:12] of the
[1:09:12] it's ocean and that's how God is you
[1:09:14] can't there is no end to him and and yet
[1:09:18] you know the Bible tells us that yet in
[1:09:21] all of that there are those who did not
[1:09:23] come from God right and you saw what do
[1:09:29] you mean brother books and this is not
[1:09:30] to scare anybody because you must you
[1:09:32] should be confident now to know that you
[1:09:34] are a son or daughter of God by now
[1:09:37] hallelujah because that's what that's
[1:09:40] what make grace so amazing that all of
[1:09:45] the bad stuff you do you have done God
[1:09:47] still loves you
[1:09:49] hallelujah now the button that the
[1:09:52] probably God said now don't think you're
[1:09:53] gonna sin and get away guarding go cover
[1:09:56] it up you reap what you sow but it won't
[1:09:59] stop God from saving you hmm
[1:10:05] and then late to brush your teeth you
[1:10:06] get a cavity and guess what it's gonna
[1:10:09] paint the teeth was perfect in itself
[1:10:14] but it was your deflection that brought
[1:10:16] in the damage and that's what how it is
[1:10:19] what else you push you neglect to read
[1:10:20] your word you need like to pray you
[1:10:23] didn't like to keep in in connection
[1:10:25] with God you're going to pay for it and
[1:10:29] you know we call God that never know the
[1:10:31] devil is there only because you didn't

[1:11:00] hypnotize me I don't know he's a serpent
[1:11:02] he don't look the serpent in the high
[1:11:08] he'd been on his journey into a trance
[1:11:14] you know you gotta watch that fella he's
[1:11:17] spy hey God
[1:11:22] to us but I love this way says if you

[1:11:33] of the tree if this thing is already
[1:11:36] doomed its dying every day right come on
[1:11:40] but on the inside of you understand you
[1:11:42] soil your dirt your dirt but on the
[1:11:45] inside of you it's been another tree
[1:11:47] planting hallelujah and it is called
[1:11:50] what we called the bride tree so a
[1:11:54] brother brother brigs am I gonna ever
[1:11:56] huh woo I love this people said but
[1:11:59] brother books you off the scripture no
[1:12:00] because the Bible said that jesus said
[1:12:03] himself I am the vine and you are the
[1:12:05] branches in order for you to continue
[1:12:09] you must abide in me that means you got
[1:12:14] to stay there that's why I love about
[1:12:16] trees I think about trees and I think
[1:12:18] man everybody time I when they go
[1:12:20] through think about a tree no matter
[1:12:23] what weather change that tree got to
[1:12:25] stay there it can't move it can't run it
[1:12:29] has to stay where it's planted and
[1:12:31] wherever it's been printed it will blue
[1:12:37] because the weather is gonna make sure
[1:12:39] it happened mmm
[1:12:44] God is so good to us jesus said only
[1:12:48] those who are from above will understand
[1:12:50] me right
[1:12:52] he told Oh decide those pharisees and
[1:12:54] sadducees say you can't understand me
[1:12:56] because you're not from where I am where
[1:12:58] I came from where did you come from I
[1:13:01] came out of that ocean you know that's
[1:13:05] what that's what they saying you know in
[1:13:07] evolution everything came out of but I
[1:13:09] came from out of the ocean the ocean of
[1:13:13] God I love the parable the parable said
[1:13:22] about the fishing and some will yield
[1:13:24] and some were snakes and all of that and
[1:13:26] it's amazing the fisherman caught him
[1:13:28] but he couldn't change them because they
[1:13:31] were who they they are who they were you
[1:13:34] know me you came in the met that
[1:13:36] so what are you gonna say who are you
[1:13:41] you first can I help your net you fish
[1:13:47] caught in the gospel net and guess what
[1:13:50] some of us all of us I don't know one
[1:13:52] fish that doesn't have to be clean
[1:13:55] before using it right it's the truth I
[1:14:00] don't I if somebody caught some fish and
[1:14:02] they cooked it with the guts and all in
[1:14:04] it
[1:14:04] excuse me you know you know you don't
[1:14:11] take the scales off of them oh I just
[1:14:13] cooked me some fish and you still got
[1:14:14] the scales for some reason that fish is
[1:14:17] no longer appealing but God knows how to
[1:14:23] get it all together I got a few more
[1:14:25] minutes is this okay
[1:14:28] he told him he said you you you you're
[1:14:32] gonna die your sins because there's
[1:14:33] nothing in you they gonna believe me cuz
[1:14:36] he came did that and before Cain amen
[1:14:39] his daddy did it
[1:14:41] all those years or whatever you call it
[1:14:44] with God and Lucifer still disbelieve
[1:14:53] faith is a gift you know faith is not
[1:14:57] some oh I got faith cuz I read it every
[1:15:00] on all of the Bible that don't give you
[1:15:03] faith faith is a gift from God we didn't
[1:15:08] know that we thought I had to come up
[1:15:10] with it now it's a gift
[1:15:12] and sometimes when God gives you the
[1:15:15] faith some people won't receive it it
[1:15:18] ain't faith to you if you won't receive
[1:15:19] it remember remember the one lady could
[1:15:23] have lived and brother Balaam said if
[1:15:25] you don't catch it
[1:15:26] you're gonna die basically what happened
[1:15:28] she didn't get it and she died it wasn't
[1:15:32] that God didn't give her the faith but
[1:15:35] she just didn't have it she couldn't get
[1:15:37] it why because most of us think it's so
[1:15:41] big
[1:15:44] oh I the more I see God and I at je
[1:15:47] trouve the more simple he becomes it's
[1:15:53] when we we we look like he's this this
[1:15:56] great giant you know what I'm saying
[1:15:58] and he comes in and here he comes in the
[1:16:01] form of a man and brother man don't say
[1:16:03] that Jesus is about his size his height
[1:16:05] short hmm
[1:16:10] and we look at this thing we think
[1:16:11] within ourselves that God has to have
[1:16:13] muscles God don't need no muscle
[1:16:17] it's his word and we must understand him
[1:16:23] in that when you plant it this is what I
[1:16:28] love about honey whatever territory or
[1:16:34] whatever territory the flowers that
[1:16:35] those that's in that particular
[1:16:37] territory is it's gonna tell what kind
[1:16:40] of the characteristics of that honey now
[1:16:43] honey's gonna be sweet but not all honey
[1:16:45] is sweet because the flowers are not all
[1:16:48] sweet good tasting honey you know I mean
[1:16:52] that's what I mean
[1:16:53] and my point is you know you go over to
[1:16:56] clover a covert a overhead and near
[1:16:58] Vancouver where the honey it's just
[1:17:01] white and look like smooth sometimes
[1:17:03] white some time is like creamy color it
[1:17:06] looks like almost like lard but good I
[1:17:10] even put it on my chicken so I want you
[1:17:14] to understand by God's grace it's just
[1:17:16] they're good you know you look at these
[1:17:20] things and you said what brother was
[1:17:22] what he said then if you go over to to
[1:17:24] uh I used to have all kinds of balls of
[1:17:26] honey your Trinidad and all and that the
[1:17:28] honey is different the texture is
[1:17:30] different you know what I'm saying and
[1:17:33] we must understand that even though we
[1:17:36] are eating honey is where you raised and
[1:17:43] what portion of the ocean you've been
[1:17:45] planted
[1:17:49] eating from the same table when you say
[1:17:51] what brothers explain it to me because
[1:17:53] understand water one water rivers of
[1:17:58] water right and bill don't talk about
[1:18:02] the nine gifts nine fruits of the spirit
[1:18:05] all of that but one water and God is
[1:18:12] expecting us to show that prove that
[1:18:18] that the word proving it that you have
[1:18:22] been with God before the foundation of
[1:18:24] the world this is your hour and your
[1:18:26] time to prove that you were with him and
[1:18:29] how do you believe how do you prove that
[1:18:32] you were with him by believing every
[1:18:35] word and acting upon it almost done
[1:18:49] brother where God is speaking of his
[1:18:51] fruit tree that he had planted God
[1:18:56] planted a fruit tree he planted it on
[1:19:00] the day of Pentecost and he brought that
[1:19:03] tree there for purpose he wanted it to
[1:19:07] bear his fruit see according to Psalm
[1:19:11] says his fruit in his season right
[1:19:15] it showed that God was going to not a
[1:19:18] prophet that was going to sow the seeds
[1:19:20] and in that season that God has
[1:19:23] prophesied would come to pass that seed
[1:19:26] would manifest itself read it it's to
[1:19:32] his brother Adam brings it out one is
[1:19:35] what he is is God and the other one is
[1:19:37] the Prophet because the word of the Lord
[1:19:39] comes to the prophet and that word that
[1:19:43] prophet is the one who sews the seeds
[1:19:46] right whether Luther Wesleyan you know
[1:19:51] these men God ordained or so to see but
[1:19:54] there you know it's like this you know
[1:19:56] when you plant a seed you expect for it
[1:19:58] you wanted to come up in a day no sir
[1:20:00] it will not come up in the day
[1:20:02] it has a season he planted it on the day
[1:20:11] of Pentecost that's what policy some
[1:20:13] plant some water and God gives the
[1:20:15] increase right he planted on the day of
[1:20:19] Pentecost and he brought that tree there
[1:20:22] for purpose he wanted to bear the bear
[1:20:24] his fruit word God word he wanted a
[1:20:27] church that will keep his word
[1:20:29] all down through the ages he had failed
[1:20:31] to keep it the Jews did fail to keep it
[1:20:33] the law had failed yeah all had failed
[1:20:36] so God planted him a tree that's right a
[1:20:39] tree now remember there was two trees in
[1:20:41] the Garden of Eden now know that you
[1:20:44] called them whatever you want to I have
[1:20:46] my idea but not but anyhow one of them
[1:20:49] was defiled tree it got defiled and the
[1:20:52] other one wasn't defiled that tree of
[1:20:55] life come from God out of heaven he said
[1:20:57] your father eat manna and our dead but
[1:21:01] this tree you eat and you live forever
[1:21:04] and angel God at that tree of life from
[1:21:07] the Garden of Eden kept it in Eden that
[1:21:09] tree of life is in Eden now spiritually
[1:21:14] speaking now so where is the Tree of
[1:21:17] Life and who is Eden okay right you're
[1:21:23] the tree
[1:21:28] mmm-hmm now let's stop oh oh
[1:21:33] business begin now when these trees that
[1:21:35] got planted it was to bear nine
[1:21:37] different kinds of fruit nine different
[1:21:39] kind which means nine spiritual gifts
[1:21:42] and nine of the spirit nine of the
[1:21:45] Spirit
[1:21:46] now skew the nine fruits of the spirit
[1:21:48] to go with one with the nine spiritual
[1:21:51] gifts that was God's tree he planted it
[1:21:55] on in earth on the day of Pentecost see
[1:21:58] now let's stop always so limited with
[1:22:01] time I'm going to skip all right so you
[1:22:04] know what the whole point is you know we
[1:22:06] must understand he said he shall be like
[1:22:07] a tree God's tree planted where by the
[1:22:10] river
[1:22:10] rivers plural rivers of water singular
[1:22:14] so you know just one water one God
[1:22:17] bringing forth all of these things I'm
[1:22:19] I'm gonna stop in just a minute give me
[1:22:22] grace Elmer's here you must understand
[1:22:26] that this tree in itself will bring
[1:22:28] forth you how can I say it I love God I
[1:22:33] just love the way he explained things he
[1:22:36] said seed see one thing about the seed
[1:22:40] you can't you can't disguise what it is
[1:22:43] time will make manifest what it is
[1:22:47] whether it be an apple tree or orange
[1:22:50] tree whatever that seed can't change
[1:22:55] itself it is what it is gives you a
[1:23:01] preference what about remember because
[1:23:04] Bob said he'd never lose one not one he
[1:23:07] knows exactly all of his God in his God
[1:23:15] do not go through the process of a
[1:23:19] elimination in our own physical body we
[1:23:27] go through a process of elimination
[1:23:29] those who were not elected yet they come
[1:23:33] from out of our body they die but none
[1:23:38] of God sees never die everyone
[1:23:42] God put out there will grow will be born
[1:23:45] he can't he can't see because all of
[1:23:48] that is God you take one piece of that
[1:23:51] away it unless is God because all of
[1:23:54] that scar you understand me it's like a
[1:23:56] piece of puzzle a puzzle you can't take
[1:23:58] one part out of it and expect that
[1:24:01] puzzle not to be affected affected by
[1:24:04] you understand me it takes all of us to
[1:24:07] make him not one part of God amen has
[1:24:13] been taken and done away with everything
[1:24:16] that you see that is destroyed and God
[1:24:19] put away was not God's in the beginning
[1:24:27] you say well what about this
[1:24:29] God knows day they were not sons of God
[1:24:32] though they were called sons of God
[1:24:33] because they we are born in the image
[1:24:35] and likeness of God whether them said
[1:24:37] all man is in the image of sons of God
[1:24:42] but his was in you make sure your son
[1:24:45] huh children of the promise are sons and
[1:24:50] daughters of God that's why people get
[1:24:58] mixed up the sons of God saw the
[1:25:00] daughters of men want to marry no money
[1:25:03] and whether the men come from it took us
[1:25:09] a prophet to tell us that that that came
[1:25:11] married his own sister who was even
[1:25:17] going to marry that's your message and
[1:25:25] they produce Giants there wasn't no
[1:25:29] angels from heaven coming now because
[1:25:31] they don't have sexual things going on
[1:25:34] up there
[1:25:37] if that was the case Lucifer would not
[1:25:41] have needed the serpent he needed the
[1:25:49] serpent to bring that kind of hybrid
[1:25:52] ational you know the Lord my last quote
[1:26:01] I know we got some late Springs late
[1:26:04] seasons of Easter monk coming
[1:26:06] the Lord is tearing his coming they say
[1:26:09] and every time everything like that and
[1:26:11] the cold winds killed a lot of them
[1:26:14] denominational 's with the same branches
[1:26:17] but it can't kill the life that's
[1:26:20] predestinated heaven and earth will pass
[1:26:24] away but my words shall not all that he
[1:26:28] foreknew he called those he called he
[1:26:32] has justified those who he had justified
[1:26:34] he has already glorified hallelujah it's
[1:26:38] written in the book the Lamb's Book of
[1:26:40] Life
[1:26:40] and cannot die
[1:26:43] all the bugs that hell can turn loose on
[1:26:46] her will never stop her
[1:26:48] no communism no Catholicism no nothing
[1:26:52] else would stop it
[1:26:53] I will restore said the Lord all the
[1:26:57] man-made Roman trees will never hang it
[1:26:59] there all the graves will never keep it
[1:27:02] there all the big denominational stones
[1:27:05] laying all at the door will never keep
[1:27:07] it in there I will restore said the Lord
[1:27:11] there will be an Easter it'll bring
[1:27:14] forth the same church in this same power
[1:27:17] here to bring a bride out just like she
[1:27:21] was back there with the same signs the
[1:27:23] same fruits the same thing that they did
[1:27:26] it'll bring I'll bring her back again I
[1:27:29] will restore said the Lord
[1:27:32] what restore all that the denomination's
[1:27:35] eat all restore all the organization's
[1:27:38] eat off I will restore said the Lord all
[1:27:42] of it he's our Lord when his time and in
[1:27:57] his season God knows exactly what he's
[1:28:00] doing you know and and we've got to
[1:28:04] trust him we can stand we must trust him
[1:28:11] God has never planted a bad seed whoa no
[1:28:16] it's true the parable of the seed there
[1:28:19] was a good man who sowed good seed and a
[1:28:22] bad man there so bad seed
[1:28:24] God never mixed the seeds we are so
[1:28:30] blessed in this last day and I don't
[1:28:32] even know how to describe it
[1:28:33] I don't but one thing I can truly say is
[1:28:37] that I I'm really seeing things that I
[1:28:40] don't even maybe don't even know what
[1:28:41] I'm seeing here but I do see things and
[1:28:44] I realized one thing I my perfectionism
[1:28:47] in him if I didn't have his life in me I
[1:28:51] would be just like anyone else wretched
[1:28:54] miserable blind naked
[1:28:56] you know there's nothing god then choose
[1:28:59] me because of the way I look or whatever
[1:29:01] family I came out of no the choice that
[1:29:06] God made was before the foundation of
[1:29:08] the world you all of us you know I look
[1:29:11] at us and cold outside on the wind and
[1:29:13] Wednesday night and y'all still come out
[1:29:15] you don't you think God sees that you
[1:29:19] may think you know I didn't do anything
[1:29:20] but you did you came and and God will
[1:29:24] honor that because he knows all the
[1:29:27] obstacles of the battles that you had
[1:29:29] before you did come but you pressed your
[1:29:32] way out to come see brother Brooks know
[1:29:35] you came to hear the word the attraction
[1:29:40] is the word not some preacher not know
[1:29:44] musically the attraction is the word
[1:29:46] that's what's pulling you and if that is
[1:29:49] pulling you guess what it's doing
[1:29:51] something it's transforming you you
[1:30:02] can't see it but that life is moving on
[1:30:04] up it is it's transforming you but you
[1:30:08] don't heard me say this so many times
[1:30:10] you know I asked somebody what do you
[1:30:12] see on this piece of paper yeah nobody's
[1:30:17] gonna say oh I see all that whatever
[1:30:19] color that is whatever it is you wanted
[1:30:24] to say I see this is the table desktop
[1:30:26] but what about all this what about all
[1:30:30] is and that's what the devil shows you
[1:30:33] he shows you your mistake and you forget
[1:30:37] about all the blessings that God has
[1:30:38] given you all of the sins that he's
[1:30:41] forgiven you of and there's not one
[1:30:43] piece of anything here that's showing
[1:30:45] that you've ever seen before now you
[1:30:49] look at this and you say well I got one
[1:30:51] thing that bothers me all the time what
[1:30:53] you're blessed he just got one thing you
[1:31:01] are blessed
[1:31:05] as many of the afflictions of the
[1:31:06] righteous but God delivered them all
[1:31:11] from them all right oh you got many but
[1:31:15] don't think he meant that that God is
[1:31:17] did you know just punishing you think
[1:31:19] about all this and I think about it as a
[1:31:21] whole bad you know I don't know how much
[1:31:23] more suffering and trials and things
[1:31:25] I've got to go through but oh my when I
[1:31:28] get to heaven it's gonna be worth it all
[1:31:31] like I said that like that song said
[1:31:34] when we look back these old trials will
[1:31:36] seem small God can do anything but fail
[1:31:44] [Music]
[1:31:46] I'm so glad to see my brother John a man
[1:31:50] we've been talking about it ever since I
[1:31:52] you know just it shows you none of us
[1:31:57] knows the mind of God but I know for
[1:32:02] certain every night in the end God would
[1:32:04] have me praying for the brother my love
[1:32:08] for Josh is unconditional for this
[1:32:13] brother as well I mean for the Marsha
[1:32:16] and all of them I don't how can I judge
[1:32:19] anybody Jesus even said I didn't come to
[1:32:25] judge did you know that he said but if I
[1:32:28] would judge my judgment would be true
[1:32:34] we'll leave that up to God to do all
[1:32:39] that he needs to do but I said like this
[1:32:41] I don't know what tomorrow holds for you
[1:32:45] today I stand he understand what I'm
[1:32:51] saying
[1:32:51] only God orders the foot prints of the
[1:32:57] son are sons of God but I are saying
[1:33:01] like this in closing I love every choice
[1:33:06] that God has made for me
[1:33:10] [Music]
[1:33:12] because I realized that I would not have
[1:33:15] the love of God in my heart don't get me
[1:33:17] wrong folks I stand up here and I'm they
[1:33:20] sound like whoo
