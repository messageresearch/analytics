[30:05] amen it's good to be back with you again
[30:07] this morning and
[30:09] and uh
[30:10] enjoyed the fellowship last night and
[30:12] the presence of the lord that came in
[30:14] amongst us
[30:15] and uh just
[30:17] got to talking with brother uh keith
[30:20] this morning out in the uh
[30:22] parking lot and
[30:24] just thinking about
[30:25] you know where keith i said something to
[30:27] you there about what i'd been through
[30:28] and
[30:29] i'm gonna switch okay
[30:34] you said it was what you were going
[30:36] through and i i tell you i i was
[30:38] thinking about how that
[30:40] we don't go through anything for no
[30:42] reason
[30:43] everything we go through is for a
[30:44] purpose
[30:48] we may never know what that purpose is
[30:51] but sometimes you see because you begin
[30:54] to tell someone else
[30:59] and then god will begin to reveal to you
[31:01] that it was all for that other person
[31:04] [Music]
[31:07] sometimes you you go through
[31:09] trouble with your children
[31:14] and it's all so that one day you can
[31:16] help someone else
[31:20] that's going through the same problems
[31:24] never doubt god
[31:27] you're going to be you can be seated for
[31:29] a moment with the sword for mom
[31:32] i'll i'll just share something with you
[31:34] that the lord's been dealing with me all
[31:35] right
[31:41] when i was a young man and seeking the
[31:43] baptism of the holy ghost lost
[31:57] and in my point of worry
[32:07] and so i just want to tell you this
[32:09] morning if you're worried
[32:12] if the devil has you torn up
[32:16] tormenting your mind
[32:18] just relax
[32:20] because any decision made in haste
[32:25] anything done in a hurry
[32:29] it's going to be the wrong decision
[32:32] look at the decision abraham
[32:36] he made a decision in haste
[32:48] yeah it produced a wild person it it
[32:51] produced we still have wars
[33:06] amen if we could let's turn to ephesians
[33:08] chapter two
[33:25] ephesians 2 verse 2.
[33:30] now we read this last night
[33:34] but i want to pick it up and go over it
[33:37] a little bit more
[33:40] among whom also
[33:42] we all had our conversation
[33:45] in times past
[33:47] in the lust of our flesh
[33:49] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[33:52] of the mind
[33:53] and were by nature the children of wrath
[33:56] even as others
[34:02] do not
[34:03] accomplish
[34:32] according to the prince of the power of
[34:35] the air
[34:38] now brother branham tells us that the
[34:39] prince of the power of the earth
[34:43] is the devil
[34:45] so we all walked
[35:02] the course of this world there's a
[35:04] direction that this world is going
[35:09] there's a direction that satan is taking
[35:12] the people
[35:24] we used to hear of crooked politics in
[35:27] other countries
[35:35] there's wars here there's rumors of wars
[35:38] here
[35:40] you see there's hatred here yeah
[35:55] it's the course of this world
[36:00] the word course means
[36:05] moving in a path
[36:07] from one point to another
[36:21] and this broad road of destruction
[36:37] sickness on every hand
[36:50] determines your destination determines
[37:04] but
[37:05] there's
[37:06] there's an opportunity an opportunity to
[37:09] make a u-turn
[37:11] there is an opportunity to turn around
[37:16] and go another direction
[37:19] and i want to thank god
[37:34] god
[37:36] [Music]
[37:45] the word course also means
[37:50] the way you conduct yourself
[37:54] you can tell by how someone acts videos
[38:00] what course they're on
[38:02] election if someone is
[38:06] if they have love in their heart
[38:10] they love their brother
[38:12] they pray
[38:14] they study the word
[38:44] the way
[39:00] and brother branham said that all of the
[39:02] other women that went to the king
[39:07] would dress in jewels and adorn
[39:10] themselves
[39:12] on
[39:26] and what they thought the king wanted it
[39:30] but the king had told one man what he
[39:33] wanted
[39:36] and brother branham said that esther
[39:38] only wore it
[39:52] that was told by god what he wanted
[40:08] that's the one that knows what the king
[40:10] wants
[40:13] and brother branham said esther if
[40:15] robert is there dressed in what he told
[40:18] her
[40:21] all we have to do is
[40:50] so all you have
[41:02] tells me you're headed to the kingdom
[41:10] so there was a lady that had a dream
[41:12] about brother branham
[41:18] and brother branham said
[41:21] he said i was saying a person has to
[41:23] come by these three steps
[41:27] to be able to walk that highway
[41:32] there was a lady came by
[41:36] and she had on these
[41:38] high-heeled shoes
[41:42] and she said i said wait a minute sister
[41:45] i don't mind sir you can't walk that
[41:47] highway
[41:50] with that avexula now i understand it
[41:53] wasn't that she couldn't walk
[41:57] but she couldn't walk that highway
[42:12] as i said last night this is
[42:43] it's another question
[42:47] brother bran uh a sister asked brother
[42:49] branham
[42:51] if a woman should wear jewelry she uh uh
[42:53] informed
[42:55] me
[42:58] yeah so brother brandon begins to tell
[43:01] if happened
[43:04] something small
[43:06] he said but when you see it's getting a
[43:09] hold of you the
[43:16] you can tell if something's getting a
[43:18] hold of someone
[43:23] i love the fish jumpy
[43:26] and sometimes fishing gets ahold of me
[43:31] i begin to think about it as i'm at work
[43:36] and i i go home and i sit
[43:53] shoes this amount whether it's our
[43:55] clothing
[43:57] whether it's our job
[44:00] a girlfriend
[44:03] boyfriend uh
[44:05] anything like that
[44:20] the control
[44:34] you
[44:48] said
[44:49] that what esther was dressed in
[44:53] this there was a meek
[44:55] and humble spirit
[45:00] brother
[45:02] around this message i don't see a lot of
[45:05] humility anymore
[45:07] humility
[45:09] people are lifted up now
[45:12] preachers are looking for popularity the
[45:15] predicate
[45:16] popularity they quit preaching holiness
[45:20] entity because they want to be popular
[45:24] i don't want to be popular
[45:26] there's only one man i want to please
[45:56] i want him to be pleased with me
[46:12] says who's adorning let it not be that
[46:14] of outward adorning and plaiting of hair
[46:18] and wearing of gold or putting on of
[46:21] apparel
[46:25] exterior consistency
[46:32] but let it be
[46:35] the hidden man
[46:36] of the heart
[47:51] is the way it's passed
[47:53] that lead us to destruction
[47:56] and many there be that go in iona
[48:01] now this what this broad
[49:00] the
[49:14] it's because he does not love you
[49:19] but if you have a pastor
[49:22] that preaches the straight and narrow
[49:26] he preaches how to live
[49:40] it's pastor appreciation month they
[49:56] thank him for preaching the truth
[50:01] sometimes it's tough it's difficult
[50:04] sometimes it hurts the philosophy like i
[50:06] said last night about the shepherd
[50:10] sometimes
[50:24] loves you
[50:26] he's not here for the money in a
[50:28] participle
[50:29] he's not here for a bunch of people
[50:33] he's not here for popularity
[50:35] thank god for pastors
[51:06] this is not
[51:07] a code of conduct
[51:10] this is not rules
[51:13] this is not law
[51:16] we're bringing you to life
[51:20] the reason we shouldn't have television
[51:24] is they give us more time in the word
[51:29] and the word is life
[51:31] when you understand that
[51:34] it's no longer
[51:36] [Music]
[51:43] says beware
[51:44] of false prophets
[51:51] a false prophet
[51:54] preaches
[51:55] falsehood
[51:59] he teaches things that aren't true
[52:15] but that's not what he meant
[52:27] right now in the world i think there's
[52:29] eight billion people
[52:58] i believe he got the right man
[53:02] and so when that man says it i lost
[53:05] it's the truth
[53:07] brother saying i don't have to question
[53:10] what's the problem
[53:26] but inwardly
[53:28] they are ravening wolves
[53:31] sir
[53:32] now
[53:33] this word ravening
[53:37] it means to gain
[53:40] by convincing in an argument
[53:47] you find people that love to argue the
[53:49] word
[53:52] watch out for that guy yeah
[54:06] there you find the spirit of christ
[54:17] a false prophet will do whatever it
[54:19] takes
[54:22] to get
[54:32] sounds good to me
[54:37] because a false prophet only wants to
[54:40] lift himself up
[54:43] but a man lift it up
[54:47] we'll bring you to destruction evolved
[54:55] [Music]
[55:04] you'll
[55:18] that's what
[55:33] brother adam had a vision
[55:38] of the bride
[55:40] and then he saw the vision of the church
[55:46] and brother branham said the church
[55:49] was dressed immorally
[55:53] and he said they were dancing
[55:57] to the beat of rock and roll you don't
[56:00] see urithmed you rock
[56:01] he did not say they were dancing to rock
[56:04] and roll
[56:07] they were dancing to the beat
[56:11] of rock and roll you rock and roll and
[56:13] around the message
[56:26] it sounds like rock and roll
[56:31] but it has gospel lyrics
[56:36] but that's what the church was marching
[56:38] to messi
[56:40] don't see and brother branham said i
[56:42] thought
[57:08] but he said it i saw one of them get out
[57:11] of step
[57:13] um
[57:15] [Music]
[57:17] and he said i begin to scream
[57:21] thank god for a prophet that would
[57:24] scream merciless
[57:50] thank god for a man that was crying out
[57:54] get back
[58:00] today
[58:02] let's get back inside

[58:58] to say i've been going the wrong
[59:00] direction
[59:02] you can
[59:14] and he changed the whole course
[59:31] the impossible happened
[59:35] maybe you're praying about something
[59:37] right now
[59:40] you want god to do something for you
[59:44] that seems impossible
[59:47] you say how can it happen
[59:50] take him at his word
[59:52] believe the word
[59:58] mary's choice
[1:00:01] brought jesus on the scene
[1:00:04] because she believed the words
[1:00:08] it brought jesus to the earth
[1:00:10] jesus
[1:00:11] i thought brother troy
[1:00:24] it's bringing jesus back on the earth
[1:00:39] christ in you the hope
[1:00:54] when the devil says it's impossible
[1:00:57] and you believe anyway
[1:01:00] you bring christ on the scene
[1:01:03] um
[1:01:04] brother branham tells about a little
[1:01:06] woman in memphis tennessee
