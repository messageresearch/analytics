love the Lord I'm so glad we we have such a full house all in no room in this place oh my gosh I thank God for His goodness good-few colada God is so good to us always victories out the victories out the victory J then well I know the Lord though it's on outside oh okay I just want to make sure I wasn't imagine it to us and we appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ we're not gonna prolong the time which is going to get right into the Word of God we used to have others come on Sunday evening but don't get discouraged it's the sign of the times I somehow believe that Noah when he first started preaching they probably feel the place but Noah continued to preach the same message over and over a game and you know people just get tired somehow the message become commonplace and and then they fail to see that it is the saving grace of God and at the end of the day all job had in his church was his family no doubt all of the make believe us when the door was shut wish they had stayed in service and all that didn't believe wish they had believed but you've heard me say this so many times all that was left out became believers but they believed too late and that's how it's going to be right now Jesus Christ is probably the center of folly comedy comedy and all of the things they make fun of him because they don't think he exists or they think he's dead but one of these old days and not far from hints when the world is on fire all those who made fun of it gonna wish they had and they go to cry out the same God they thought that did not exist they go to crowd lord have mercy but what they fail to see is that mercy and grace as a time period and there are times when God says no more it's finished and when that time is finished it's finished but you and I are so blessed that God has been merciful to us and we thank God for His grace and it's mercy we started a message down in Iowa City and the message is entitled escape from the grip of the mark of the beast and tonight or today we are going to do part two of that so we ask as we stand we want you to go to the scripture and we try not to be long we're just gonna kind of pick up where we left off and perhaps by God's grace we kind of reverse it around the next time we preach with preach hope part one here but you know we we look at things and we fail to see that God is so real I think oftentimes people fail to see that I don't understand that the concept of mindset of men because I know I didn't create myself and I know I didn't give myself breath there been times I was so miserable for John I wish I could hold my breath and die but I couldn't give up the ghost so in in that I realized that it's not in my control there are people who wish they could hold on to the ghosts and the ghosts leave them you understand what I mean there are people who die and don't want to die yet their time has come and we realized by God's grace is in God's control and so why people don't believe that God is I don't know even as a child I knew that God was real my mom didn't have to beat it into me somehow it became a revelation to me at an early age that God was real and not only that that God was one as we stand let us turn to revelations 2 13th chapter beginning at the 16th burst and then we'll run to Jobe the 32nd chapter xxxiii chapter I really like this scripture in job and I think our four brother Troy he shared this scripture with me and I'm like oh my goodness gotta go right with the message so I asked him first of all I didn't pleasure ride or steal it from him I asked him was it okay revelation is the thirteenth chapter in the sixteenth verse how many y'all believe we're living in the last day we are we are and I'm so glad to be one of them can you imagine oh it just gets to me every time I meditate and think on it but let's move on revelation 13:16 and he calls this all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead hallelujah is that all right think about it that scripture goes on to says all who names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life they received the mark of the beast now let's go by God's grace to scripture according to job job 33 and 27 and he looketh upon man Joba he had 3327 and he looked at the pun man and if any say I have sinned and perverted that which was right and it profit me not he would deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the light now I'm not done with that scripture but I want you to really take note to the fact that he's saying he's saying if you repent baby this is what he's saying if you can acknowledge your sin and repent God says I will deliver you he would deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the light and lo all these things work at God often time with man now I love dad to bring back his soul from the pit to be enlightened with the light of the living now that's powerful let us pray father we so thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your goodness we thank you for being real to us we pray Lord God that your perfect will be done Lord give us grace to minister the very thoughts that you would have ministered to this church this morning this evening in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated we worked on that thought on grip and when something is gripped it means that it is act of grasping a seizing holding fast to and I use the illustration of an eagle when the Eagle comes down and hits the prey with his talents he grabbed that little animo so tight the animal can't get away it becomes a prayer and that prey that purpose of that eagle is to eliminate to kill amen that prey and to devour it and I use the eagle but I could have used a wolf or any other great animal that comes and prey on the smaller animals or the weaker animals we have seen that many times amen in in film Dilla with Africa how the lion comes in or and destroys a little spring buck or something we seen how the enemy can come in like hyenas and that's one animal I really just doesn't like I think it's it came from another world it's something about them that's so creepy you know I just it's just the way they laugh and you see they always these these animals always attack and they don't care if you alive or not they just take chunks out of you until til you're dead once in their grip there's no escape then there's those animals that that may be small but they know how to latch on you and then pull you and drag you you take a leopard a leopard it men can kill an animal that's perhaps twice its size and then pull it on up into the tree for later snack but the whole idea is that your desire you know if you and I look at I've looked at animal kingdom at times and I think Oh God I'm so glad I'm not of that Kingdom there they die horribly and the fact to know that I'm not gonna normally die from old age something is going to just devour and eat me at some point dying whether I'm young and oh something's gonna grab me something's gonna siege me I'm not going to always remain strong but something is going to get me that's just the way it I call it the circle of life whatever you want to call it but to me all of that was and is because of sin and it's because Amen Adam and Eve fell this is why we death is such a horrible thing I think if we could understand what Jesus did on Calvary when he conquered death hell and the grave we look at death like okay he conquered death that was such a great victory that we will be celebrating that victory throughout eternity is that right because remember he meant the property God said when Jesus when we see Jesus and then him being his glorified body but you better understand he'll still have the nail-scarred hands bah because he don't want us to ever forget what it took for him to redeem us now when we look at this thing we talk about the mark of the beast a lot of times we don't understand the mark of the beast ain't just 666 the mark of the beast is spiritual it is something that people get ahold of or it get ahold of people and won't let them go it is a ravenous beast it's a thing that grabs you holds you and won't let you go think about it we can have the opportunity to receive God's blessing understand this there's only one or two ways that's good or evil right or wrong you get the Holy Ghost or you get the mark of the beast the Holy Ghost is a seal it's a confirmation that you came from God and you go back to God the mark of the beast is a mark that shows you came from Satan and you're going back to Satan the Bible said the Lord knoweth them that are his that's why God could seal us not only seal us but save us amen before the foundation of the world because he knew us like he knew Jeremiah hallelujah like e-news Josiah people Amen that we know in the scripture said that God says they will be born hallelujah before they were born and God knew the very time you would strike the earth but understand he doesn't take away the battle when Jesus came he knew when he came he came to die of all mankind he found himself in the scripture but he knew that had not he would become the victor had not he defeated Satan on his grounds we would not have been qualified ever to reach heaven again when we look at this thing you and I must understand Amen that the mark of the beast is so simple it's not something that just started it has been from Genesis whenever you take religion and put it above the word you take the mark of the beast whenever you take science or anything and put it in place and stand up you receive the mark of the beast you said what do you mean remember God told King if you do as your brother Abel is done go sacrifice a lamb sacrifice an animal for me show me a blood sacrifice then I will do to you I will even let you be the head of your brother but Cain in his very reasoning the intellect of Cain thought that his religion was good enough if you think religion will save you that is what we consider the mark of the beast because Cain thought his religion was going to save him there is no salvation outside of the blood of Jesus Christ your religion can't save you your works can't save you the Bible said we are saved by grace and grace alone so you and I must understand what brings people to a mark is when they can see truth and walk away from it you understand me everybody you don't have truth always we learn we grow in the into the knowledge and the grace of truth we don't always have it all but there are always stations in your life where you must come true to to determine how far you go with God in other words even in the Christian world we come to justification when we confess the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior when we believe him in our hearts and confess with our mouth at that point in time we pass from death unto life but it doesn't stop there there's another Junction that we call sanctification and that sanctification is something that we must have as well the same Holy Ghost amen that justifies you and impresses a little life in you that is only begotten that is when a child a men has been got begotten in the mother's womb but you see you still need a birth and that bird consists of water blood and spirit so you have to be justified you have to be sanctified is that right because remember sanctification in this day is not enough God is a progression god he moves forward and Satan knows that if he can keep you with truth in the past that pass becomes error hello in other words the past can work against you because once God unfolds truth to you and you stay in a position and you say well I mean it wait a minute now Luther Luther was the you know the angel of the first angel you know to to to to almost this Exodus hearing I know that God used Lucifer a loose I'm sorry Luther because he actually put the thesis on the Catholic Church the just shall live by faith and I know Luther was right but he was right for his day and every Lutheran that refused Wesley message was marked you understand me so you say Oh what I mean in every Wesleyan that refused the Pentecostal uu was marked because they didn't go any further and what I mean by mark I don't mean they didn't understand I mean they came to the knowledge of the truth and did what call the move of God a devil that's what they did it's happened in every age you don't believe it Jewish the Jews were right in what they taught and what they understood they were right but when Jesus came he was a revelation of their work the written word and he said to the Jews who had studied the Pharisees the Sadducees described Herodian he spoke to them and said except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sin but they were raised Jewish they were thoroughbreds Pharisees of Pharisees but when truth comes walk in the light as he is in the light and doing well and the blood you have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ would cleanse you from all unrighteousness in other words as Christ move you move stay in the sunlight at the Sun move over the earth it brings light but remember if the Sun moves forward and you stand still your life becomes darkness that's how the gospel works so you must understand as Christ began to unfold himself you and I by God's grace must walk in the light as he reveals it right thing about the Holy Ghost is the Bible says the holy ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth now remember Amen I spoke this this morning coming out of Psalms 91 he says surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler and there are times that if if someone didn't wouldn't come to deliver you you would be devoured a friend of mine he was a game warden there in South Africa Brian Jones I don't know what I want to call him a friend and I but he was an associate and a brother y'all got a dough you don't know what I'm talking about but it happened Brian Jones Amen he was one that were being a game warden he would find animals that have been entrapped and he would break those traps off of those animals take him home and nurtured them until they are strong enough to go back into the wild he wasn't always successful because some of the wolves of the animals were so severe - they died there were times he meant that some of the animals that they that he fared and and help was was was was became almost domestic so they lost the instinct and understanding of how to hunt so that will become devastating - but to put a put put it in short term because of who he was he still was able to extend that animal's life by breaking the trap in which they were caught in there is a snare and that's how the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost will break every trap and snare that land and the devil has set for you he will bring you in and nurture you is that right remember the man who was on his way down to Jericho and he was caught by robbers and beaten and Here Come this man who was a Samaritan now the religious people they moved to the side why they had already received the mark you see because their religion was more important than the leadership of the Holy Spirit Jesus said well you know what it's ok what you do is good but you're leaving off the weightier things mercy grace and truth things that means more to you than just looking pious and holy in front of others am I right or wrong Jesus didn't care he meant about what people thought of him he went to a Simon's house knowing that the woman who was a prostitute was going to come had he been a man who trusted in a church he would have never done that but his leadership was not the Pharisees of the Sadducees of the scribe or the Aronian his leadership was his father y'all hear what I'm saying where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and whom the wear out spirit of the law set free is free indeed so you and I must understand that I'm coming I'm moving down we must understand we have a challenge because anything can snare you Satan has a little way of making you worship and you don't even know you worship II can I can I put it this way the television used to be on the floor y'all remember that when you watch the television you were sitting down and you were it was on the floor but as it became elevated and worshiped more it began to rise now is up on the wall and guess what people you're looking up you're worshipping and don't even know you worshipping because the television has been elevated and you have been lowered hello it becomes your Lord it becomes your ruler oh come on somebody you know and I know I've been there some bad she come on and you might click it the first time fast forward but every time that motion gets slower and slower Oh somebody help me what is he I'm preaching on myself now because I've been there God had to deliver me you understand me I'm telling you this because I want you to know you can be delivered God is able to break the spell of snare he can break it y'all know I'm telling the truth soon as you get bored or feeling tired or feeling ah that thing's a hello it summons you and you come on is this ok Lord you don't say it but that's what you're doing that's a trap it's a grip and you think it doesn't have a hold on you stop it let's see how long you can stop it hallelujah you cannot you gotta ask God for help oh it's the truth I'm talking about my cell phone your cell phone your cell phone can become a grip you know and I know it is against the law to look at your cell phone and talk on your phone and everything else and as soon as a thing yeah yeah hear what I'm saying I'm trying to tell you what we and we fail to see that we how much were saying we must obey even though we don't do like we should the laws of the land hello I don't know how come I'm there but let's move on we are always at a challenge as I was saying this morning you should never say I can't not do it Paul says not only are we more than conquerors to Christ but he says I can do all things all things not something all things through Christ he's the one who strengthens me it's not my strength it's not that power is not by mine but it's by my spirit saith the Lord listen but there LM says amen in that question and answering and I read this this morning when those children of Israel when God told him you go conquer the land now watch this now people they had already been in Egypt they had already seen the power of Goshen they'd seen all the plagues of Egypt they'd seen the Red Sea open they seen the pillar of fire they'd seen the pillar of cloud and they still got across they jumped they shout they had a good Pentecostal meeting and they got in the wilderness and the first thing you know they're complaining hallelujah like I said it ain't the things that you wear it ain't the things that you smell it ain't the things that even you see is what comes out of your mouth that defiles you because what's gonna come out of your mouth disease of faith or unbelief you understand me that's what Jesus said they wild disciples are not washing you their hands it ain't the washing of the hands jesus said that would befall you whether you do it or not he said what defiles you is what comes out of your mouth oh I got a scripture cuz he said every evil thing comes out of your heart if the sinner is coming out hallelujah he said listen they go over there and and they had a challenge let me tell you something you think you just gonna get the Holy Ghost you're gonna walk in there and says God give me the Holy Ghost thank you though you gotta fight for it God made it so if you yours is for your possession but you gotta fight for it huh how do you fight for it on your knees wherever you may be you could be in the mountain in the river on the bank it doesn't matter but you've got to cry out for it is that the message you got to cry out that is that about how cute you can be he wanna hear a cry a desperate cry like a baby that needs something that's what he said and people in these intellectual let me tell you something the Bible said God needs their men but there are certain men crept in unawares who were before old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our Lord into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ what are you saying they're denying the Holy Ghost they have intellectually infiltrated and they're telling you all you got to do like a Baptist is believe this message it's not just believing it's acting upon it you've got to act upon what you beat you hear hallelujah believing is good but it doesn't stop there have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe I know people think I'm crazy but my point is people either have the Holy Ghost and make a rapture or you wanna have the mark of the beast and left behind it's the truth this is a desperate time the seals have been open the visions of the prophet of God has been made clear we see they got cause now that's on the road egg-shape no drivers or stern-wheel right now they're still experimenting them and in Europe and in in in our California right now why do you think they're building all these rolls and refining them because they have something in mind and you and I must understand have this night is it not true that women are more beautiful they may ever been come on somebody you brothers know heart is everyday you have to turn your head you know to me because of the beauty that you see there used to be at a time that even fat women wasn't so pretty but now they pretty I remember in my school you may have one out of a class that was real pretty some of y'all young brothers don't know what I'm talking about but I came I came when food was real this hybrid stuff that made everybody pretty y'all they know that it's the hybrid food that's making everybody pretty it's the hybrid you don't believe me what you're getting in in the store is an apple that's not a real Apple that's a hybrid look how pretty and red it is no spot something green whatever it is yellow pretty yeah I had no brother brother stepping over them talking about an apple is really ugly yes no it has no no Beauty to it shine all that shine y'all crunching in that's wax but I want you to say The Hobbit stop it's the stuff that's beautiful and the hybrid corn the hybrid beans die Hobbit fruits the Hobbit that because it's beautiful it's making you beautiful you become what you eat o come out and at the same time it weakens you right because the hybrid cannot stand up against the original huh is that right brother and so you got to spray everything just to keep it going but when it's a real hot with a real thoroughbred fruit or thoroughbred vegetable it fears for itself has his own immune system oh it's the truth and you say oh brother what are you saying understand this the God gave me this message several weeks ago and I've been taking bits and pieces and bits and pieces I've been listening to the mark of the beast is your life worthy and others and God has just been taking this word and just brick why why am I doing this I'm doing this because I realized that I myself was in a grip you understand me when you got habits that's a grip that grip is of the devil and out of God and I knew that the only way I can get free or you know I don't want to be a man a man who's preaching liberty and his in bondage himself hello how you gonna preach somebody Liberty and you got problems yourself and so that's where we must understand we all have issues that we must clean up you know it's true sometimes when you when you people are let's move on I'm not gonna follow it that spirit you're not must understand we're living in the Ancient of Days and you said what brother books how do we get their time brought us here and time has been declared to be no more is that right when the word and the seals were opened the angels proclaimed time will be no more that means everything that had a beginning must end this is the ending of all things the ending of politics the ending of science the ending of religion everything that God did not start must come to an end everything ha-la-lu yeah and you and I you say what do you mean before God destroyed Sodom who did God go to first Abraham and Abraham is a type of the ancient he was an old man yet he became a young man he was the ancient yeah he what I'm saying no doubt his hair was white as wool he was an old man over 97 years old but he was a shadow and he was a type and guess what God came to him why because he became the judge he says Lord saying that there be 50 if there be 40 if there be 30 if there be 10 hallelujah before the destruction of Sodom and just before the destruction of the world which have become like Sodom the ancient the real one the real one with the white wing revelation 10 comes down hallelujah one foot on the land one foot on the sea and he had a white wig so he was the judge hallelujah you said what are you saying I'm saying the very same thing that happened in Sodom is now getting ready to happen here and all God is saying can I get fifty can I get forty is that right brother branham said he doubted that many make a rapture that's just how small the number has become oh come on somebody so I want you to understand why did God use Sodom because remember he goes on like I said this morning he said remember Lot's wife and I told you this morning what that was about but the point is what happened to all of the herdsmen that went down to Sodom Whitlock you know what happened they all became sodomites huh y'all better hear me and that is what's happening to all of the churches that refused stay in the presence of the Holy Ghost y'all him he are very would him say because if you don't stay within the presence of the Holy Ghost the spirit of this age will grab you don't tell me what you won't do you flesh will flesh and if you don't stay in the presence of the Holy Skip's ghost the spirit of this last aid will grab you and pull you in hallelujah and even when you think you're free like I said this morning that devil oh yank that cord and you'll be like Lot's wife hello it's just the truth we know what we're dealing with we know what we're dealing with look at all of the people that have left because jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood it's too hard this way is too straight this way is too narrow nobody can live it that's a lie no it's true in a way no you and I we can't live it but if Christ is in us he lives a life through us that's why we need this Holy Ghost we need it I don't care what people are saying it's a scariest thing you you can see them jumping you can see him shouting they can come this in Israel was just justified and they were on the banks a man shouting and dancing before God that don't mean they didn't they didn't have it inside you understand me they had enough Holy Ghost to make them shout they had enough Holy Ghost to make them rejoice but when they got out there in the wilderness they defile themselves with their mouths come on somebody he defiled themselves with their mouths how by complaining all the time Oh somebody help me here you and I must understand by God's grace amen we have come to a time that we that the sixth seal and everything else is about to break who we know it's really open now it's broken but just like brother bellum said it over over overlaps they overlap each other mmm-hmm it's open but at the same time some parse is not revealed or manifested but we don't by God's grace amen when that portion of the fourth or fifth fits you when when the world began to shake rock and quake the bride of Jesus Christ is gone hmm listen the fifth vision he I'm DOMA start with that he said the fifth vision had to do with the moral problem of our age similarly mostly around women God showed me that women began to be out of their place with the granting of the vote then they cut off their hair which signified they were no longer under the authority of a man but insisted on either equal rights or in most cases more than equal rights she adopted men's clothes and went into a state of undress unto the last picture I saw of a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron with this vision I saw the terrible perversion and moral plight of the whole world so there are things that he doesn't even tell us what he saw but he said this was the plight the immoral plight of the whole world not just America everywhere what's next then done took off everything else except they don't they don't they don't know what we used to call short is not short anymore huh they are literally wearing their underwear in the streets can I get a bag that's all I'm asking y'all work with me I know you're tired out too but my point is I'm trying to show you how the mark of the beast can slip up on you without you realizing you've been marked hmm the Bobby said for him to know to do good and do it and not to them it is sin and don't get me wrong folks well you and I go to make mistakes to Jesus come but the point is what's in the heart you understand me brother ever said when his daddy died with his wife died when his brother died he said he just wanted to give up he said in the devil gave him every reason to quit and give up he said but when he hadn't thought about everything and the reason had already came to his end he said there was something on the inside holding me that's what we need that's what we want when the squeeze come when the power that they shut the doors and when that when you can't buy or sell you need more than a shop in a dance you need more than just memory of the word you need Christ on the inside of you that if they said I kill you if you don't denounce them you need that we need that holding power cuz we can't hold it it must hold us remember brother Adam how did you how did you hope keep it he said I didn't keep it it kept me that's what we need we need that kind of our Holy Ghost that will not make what won't allow us to be ashamed I was talking to some young men on their own the phone the other day and he used the Lord named in vain Jesus Christ and I he came back on the phone he was helping me out I say young man I said you need to be having more respect for that word those words Jesus Christ I said that name holds in reverence he's a yes sir yes sir yes sir you know I'm sorry yeah you know there's a time I just let people say it I said no no no no no if it caused problems with me if they cursed me out they need to know I love that name I'm not gonna let you just say it and it got away and get away with it profane my Lord's name no I used to I ain't doing that no more don't use the Lord's name in my face and expect for me not to say anything if it calls for persecution on me so let it be but you're gonna know I love the Lord you love the Lord am I making sense are we getting it my thing is because we always thought that the mark of the beast related to just Church but it is a spirit it's a religious spirit that'll take you away from the word and make you a compromiser you don't need to compromise nothing stay with the word because when you compromise you are endangering your own soul right y'all understand what I'm trying to say if it's going to cause for your your people to UM persecute you let it be it's for the name of Jesus Christ is that all right listen guess what the mark guess what of disobedience to the word did disobedience to the word called the first murder these disobedience to the word caused idolatry disobedient to the word guess what produce intellectuals did y'all know that it was the falling of man that made him become intellectual he didn't need it they pronounced that God don't need you to be smart he needs you to be obedient but we think we because we're smart with this with that and we what we do we reason the Word of God and we think God wants this and that's not what God won't God wants obedience he wants a surrendered heart he wants someone who would trust him hallelujah is that right because you remember Kate thought his way was better than God's Way and that's what religious people think because I have built a big church I got a big choir I got all of this thing going for me I got outreach program I got all of this and you know God losing yourself mean joke right i'ma tell you the kind of people job God accepts given my John the Baptist John didn't have nothing but John knew how to be obedient hallelujah John didn't even have an outfit to wear all he had was the clothes of animals nah I doubt if he had a toothbrush he was Paul okay you said all brothers what do you said I'm not bro I'm not promoting being poor no sir the Bible said seek ye first the kingdom of God and it's righteousness and all these things will be added my point is don't seek all those other things before you see God because you can gather Satan to give you everything rule the Lord and bless I got a new house and I got a new job Oh God I got all this money take ease my soul is that what happened the rich man received the mark because he refused the Commission of God Jesus said come follow me sell all that you have and follow me he asked the question Lord how and what must I do to inherit eternal life and you know what Jesus says sell all you have and come follow me you know why he did that cuz he knew that stuff that man hand was his God is that right because original ruler comes at the end of the day and he's worshiping everything his his has made Obie's I've got all this in my barn I might as well just have a alone period of rest and God said thou fool you've trusted it in these things they can't save you you've trusted in all this material stuff and now your soul is required of thee and this man was called to preach whenever God said come come and follow me here he was with the evangelistic anointing on him in hell Lord somebody go tell my brother this let somebody go tell them let them warn them of this place and Jesus say they're gonna do no good so if a man died and raised from the dead that still won't believe you know why because the seed of the devil can't he can't repent what yes you said what Judas repent did he he went to the road High Priest he should have came to Jesus but he went to Caiaphas or whoever else was there that's where he went and you say well what do you mean if he had really repented he would assault Jesus's I'm sorry Lord he never showed up y'all hear what I'm saying and the thing about it is you look at Cain Cain couldn't say hey you need the Holy Ghost but he says now my way is all right I don't need to act like that I don't need all that blood everywhere mmm and that's what message people are doing now we don't need to act like that we're mature hmm the prophet of God says the only kind of babies this message can bring is acts 2:38 screaming and hollering all right and we go to some of these churches and you can hear a pin drop what is it it's the grips it's the grips because if the people don't get into a state of urgency if they don't come to a place and see that they don't have the goods hello the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe how many people can testify that literally seen miracles and signs and wonders and they are supposed to follow us you understand me it ain't no ifs about it first of em said if they don't follow you you're not a believer because God is gonna always put something in your way that's go cause faith it's gonna it's gonna mean faith to overcome it am i make am I crazy I've almost done we understand there's two types of worship and I remember Chris Hall this is not just a thought that he preached years ago now he don't even believe in this message because he and I oh Lord I didn't mean to call his name but he and I used to go back and forth on what the baptism of the Holy Ghost was and of course he had the intellectual concept and now he don't believe this message at all anymore hello but he and I being good friends we could come discuss this thing we go back and forth and and and and and still loved each other but now he's denounced everything y'all hear what I'm saying and you know what he preached bloodless worship and what he was working with was that how people in this message have become it gotten you in a place where they worship have become bloodless traditional worship becomes bloodless worship because when the blood of Jesus Christ is there you know how you worship you worship like David because David saw the Ark of God coming and recognized that that was life when you see the blood you know that's life because he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you right but you come in here and we began to form religion within the framework we've reformed kingdoms with the framework of what we call the message and the moment you do that it's the moment you die it's just okay but you got to understand in my closing you got to understand brother Branham says the way that's the way the true church that's the way of the true church it stays in the presence of God you hear what I'm hearing that the church that is or not of truth is like is like Cain he was moved out of the presence of the Lord it scares me when I go to church and I don't see God moving all I hear you know you come and you got to understand when I came to this message the message was so alive we had tongues we had interpretation of tongues we had prophecies we had dreams we had visions we had all those things happening and now everybody has been gripped everybody has come and I'm saying everybody but not everybody but you know what I mean most of the people have been gripped by Satan's distractions and everybody is now trying to build their own Little Kingdom they're trying to get their own power house and power car they power everything and at the end of the day Satan gonna keep them all so busy and they find out one day because they've been so busy they missed the rapture have mercy on us Lord you and I must understand there's two like I said of fugitive watch these people you know came became a fugitive watch it they run from one church to another now I'm not talking about because they have to I'm talking about because people don't have nothing else to do they get tired of the preach I'm going I'm going right Wanderers they don't know where they come from where they going like driftwood you know and whatever the churches believe that's what I believe it you must suss the scriptures yourself the Bible says search the Scriptures because it is in them you have eternal life I'm almost done brother will say like this don't you use this life just to drift around and float around get a better job and to dress better and to get a new television or a better car life means more than that don't you try to use it just to say well if the rest of them joined church I will too when you join church you should find first of our first seek out and find out what that church stands for if that church don't stand for the whole word you need to get out of it oh we don't believe in prophets well my Bible says they do my Bible says their prophets come on it's the truth well I don't I think since Jesus Christ has come we don't have another prophet hello every preachers a prophet but there are major and minor prophets and before God does anything according to Amos 3:7 he always reveals his secrets to his prophet before God destroyed the earth amen in the flood who did he bring Noah he didn't bring knowing his cousins one man a man before he destroyed Egypt he brought how many one man Moses when God wanted to introduce him in the New Testament church of the old church which were the Jews to Greece before he did it who did he sing send Jesus and Jesus says your laws been good but now there's a turning in the corner there's a turning of corner law won't work the more Paul said it it doesn't work all I did was condemn you but now there's a grace period but if you stay in law you're gonna die you understand me and then these last days think about it everybody that did not listen to Lucifer Luke I keep saying Lucifer excuse me everybody that didn't listen to Luther died in their sins some became what foolish virgins each period consist of virgin wise and foolish and those Amen who didn't move like like like the Methodist people stop blaspheming the Holy Ghost when they talked about the Pentecostal world being a Devils Devils they gone they done it doesn't matter how methodically they lived at the end of the day it was over and you and I must understand I'm closing on this because I want people to understand that this is a serious matter there'll be a lot of people who have taken the mark of the beast and don't even know they took it well my mama was a Baptist and so mapped it Baptist bread and Baptists dead that's exactly right it's gonna be Baptists dead and people don't understand where I work I was a Methodist I'm already my daddy ain't got nothin to do with you they done made it what if they made it and you lose out because you followed them instead of following you the word am I making sense if I can say oh I was raised a Baptist but that door I didn't stay there because God kept dealing with my heart and when God moves you move with it sometimes you don't even understand me why are you moving but you gotta move and when you how you get older my relatives thought I was going crazy but I remember in 1977 back in the day I did a lot of fasting and praying and one day I saw I believe what we call UFOs because now you can go into YouTube and the very things I saw in 1977 I saw I see on the youtubes the very life I saw nah I didn't know the message at that time but I had enough prayer I used to pray three times a day and I pray and pray and fast but in this day I was I was just right outside the church and being that I had been in the Air Force I knew that these were not regular planes this was something else and I don't know why I knew this all I knew is I began to jump and I began to shout I forgot where I was I was right on the street so people were passing behind their car see me jump it anyway I was crying out Lord Jesus whatever you do don't let me mr. rapture now I don't even know why I just know that was the anointing on me and then in 1982-83 this message came to me took about five years for it to get there but it came you understand me and then when I saw this message it tied me back into what my mom said when I got first she told me before she died on her dying bed she said junior she said God go save you you're gonna go to this church and and she directed me to churches that baptize in the name of Jesus Christ my mother couldn't read or write so she would not have known other than God revealed it somehow she told me that I would come to these churches and she told me she said junior times are gonna get hard she said but don't you go nowhere you stay there because God is gonna send you a greater light God did that when I came to this message and had been into the message for a while they was having a picnic at one of the sisters houses Chivers sister showers and brother showers and the Holy Ghost spoke to me and says now you know the greater light see so nobody can tell me whether it's right but let duty is to give all our heart to it alright God has done his part and I must do my part y'all hear what I'm saying like I told you in closing but I was a little boy playing football out there I mean American football with some of the young boys here's a white man come in my neighborhood and back in the day white men did not come into black neighborhoods unless they were the insurance man or the milkman and this man had on a black jacket white shirt and dark pants whatever I don't know whether it was a suit or whatever it was but I remember I can't remember exactly what he looked like but he was a small frame man all I know is he had that Life magazine and he came up to us he approached us they come in boys come here I got something to show you he opened that magazine up to the cloud you understand what I'm saying he opened that magazine up to the and he says Jesus Christ is soon to come can you see it can you see him in the cloud other boys probably would I ran the other two with me and then we looked at it I can't see it but I could see the face and as soon as I said I can see the face that man shut that book he walked back from where he came from and I never seen him again all that magazine again till I came to this message so I don't care what people say what the intellectuals say what the preachers say I have had my own experience I know that God called me from a boy you understand me I used to hear these voices calling me my mama say don't answer that Jew did that death scared me half to death and I stopped but it never stopped and the very day I got baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ that same voice when I was 12 I was baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost and when I came up out of that water I heard a voice saying what is the name years I wondered what was the name and the very day I got baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I come up out of that water and that same boy said to me so nobody can tell I'm not what I'm trying to do people has not lift me up I'm trying to just encourage you this message is 100 percent right that's all I'm saying by my own experience and by what God has shown me I could never give it up because it would never give me up you understand me one thing for certain I was praying in here to check in the church and just encourage you to pray I've been coming every day praying just me and God and I'm gonna tell you something God reveals some in me that I didn't even know was there and I'm telling you it was positive I saw something and I don't know when but I just say God showed me something I had never seen before in me and you know what he told me you gotta have faith and believe and have courage to perform you understand see the Holy Ghost will be laying right there but if you don't know it you can't it can't be used of you you can be used you know me you got to know what you got like Samson you got to know what you got you got to know he's there and he's greater than anything else it literally takes the fear out of you that's what kind of God we serve and that's what we need to understand Amen that we're not serving a denominational God or some kind of Moab Moloch or anything like that we are serving the true and living God that has always been and always will be and we can get from him just exactly what he said we can get he said if you believe you could ask anything in my name and it shall be given to you that Stan don't let the devil grab you and take you down you fight if you can't get out of the snare you call on Jesus somebody help me here because I'm gonna tell you something when I got saved I didn't know I had this thing I didn't know of drinking it was in me because I worked in a club I didn't know I even had a habit until after I got saved and you know what the enemy came to me that day I was home by myself wanted me to go back drinking you know what I did I can't be ashamed with this testimony I screamed out to God like a madman I could care less I had never neighbors we lived in a project but I screamed out like somebody was murdering me now I didn't plan it I just knew I didn't want to go back and I cried out to God and I'm telling you the windows were shut all of a sudden a wind came like it came through the window and it just came straight through me and it felt like something cool was breathing flowing out of me and when it left every desire to dream left to I didn't have to go through DTS or detox or whatever you call it all I know is that God I've never had a desire or a habit like that again see so no you can't tell me I don't care how long you been on drunkard all I know if you cry out to God God would do it for you but he needs to hear people desire life more than they do death and that's how some people are they just love death but if you won't life you scream out for it enough you ever have a scene you know movies and you know bad movies well somebody's gonna be killed and they just begging for their life why can't we beg God for that why can't we get before God and says God I want to live I don't want to die Lord I don't want to go to hell I want life eternal yeah I want to live right that's what I tell my god I said Lord you know what I love your word because I love your character when I read the Bible I get excited about how God handles situations I just love it it's not boring to me I love it I love the way God intervenes I love the way he talks I love the way it's written and all I want to do is live it that's what frustrates me if there be any frustration in my life is only because like Paul says how to obtain it how to do this is what I need to know and by this message I've came to understand I've come to understand that if we surrender to God God had come to our rescue hallelujah I've got a baptism on the 10th of August and on the 11th of August in Iowa City I'm excited about that I love to see people repair reach out and touch the law as he passes by you if I he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry he's seen pies moment your knees to supply reach out and touch the Lord as he Oh reach out and touch the Lord as he passes by your thigh he's not too busy to he your hearts cry he's passing by smallness your knees to supply reach out and touch the law as he sail again reach out who as she passed you will find two hijo he's passing by Smallman your knees to supply Rita I [Music] just want to say to the young people those don't let nobody despise you you you you you can't get too holy you can't get too righteous or you're going off the edge no if you're the only one in your church living holy and saved before God do that you know I even was criticized in my church now I want you to understand we're not against people's churches because God has Christians and everyone that's why he said come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins because if you stay in there then you're going to receive the same plagues you see what I'm saying God had to bring lot out of Sodom he had to bring Israel out of Egypt before he destroyed so God has to bring us out of this worldly Laodicean Church age condition in order to save us to bring us all the way through I was raised a Baptist from the Baptist I went to the Catholic from the Catholic I went to the Methodist from the Methodist I went to apostolic so I had my rounds and once you come to know all that they know or know enough then you still feel that boy something's missing then you come into this message and God brought this message to me and let me say it like this I had to have an experience I had to come to know that this message was right I couldn't go by somebody else's thoughts in there yeah I had to know for myself and when God dropped that in my soul amen there's nothing can change me all I ask God is to keep me true just keep me true because how that song go nothing between my soul hallelujah delusive Bree I have renounced all sinful pleasure jesus is my there's nothing between nothing between much solace so that his blessed
