TRANSCRIPT
========================================
going to ask you that uh that you would turn with us to Joshua we're going to be coming from the third chapter we read Joshua all the way up to the fourth chapter we trust that you'll be blessed by by the gra of God still working with the Statue of a perfect man uh and those things that are pertaining to it I just want to bring out a few things in the scripture that uh I I know I mentioned it before some time ago but maybe you don't recall but nevertheless I trust that God will anoint the word tonight and just do something special for us I I I would uh would to see uh those of us really who have been really pressing into more of God uh if you haven't been I I want to say shame on you uh because the word of God has been coming and the grace of God has been working with us uh uh abundantly because a lot of us amen uh didn't know some of these things and maybe you did know it but it's just the right season right now so I I want to say this I don't care if it's just a little press a little something you should be giving uh God something every day asking the Lord to help you on a daily basis uh you know what you need to be delivered from you know your enemy and you know the one that you've got to die with uh so by the grace of God I trust that you know we Are Spiritual enough to know that this is the last go round there's not another church age and uh I want to say this by the grace of God so that you could plainly understand there is no neutral ground you either save or you're lost there is no no neutral ground and you know God has given us all of us an opportunity to be on the right side amen you love the Lord amen uh Joshua we're going to start at the third chapter uh we'll begin at the third verse and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests and the Levites bearing it then you shall remove from your place and go after it yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2,000 cubits by measure come not near unto it that you may know the way by which you must go for ye have not passed this way here to for so it took about 2,000 years for this Ark to be spaced between the people and God uh God God and his people ever since the day of Pentecost amen and so now we realize by the grace of God it's almost time for this Ark to return to the Jews and understand they will find the ark just the same way we did amen by the way of a Prophet by the grace of God 2,000 years so it shows us exactly where we are right now amen that uh God has uh took 2,000 years to bring it back to us and uh he's he's basically uh coming and and now we see where we are but look what he's telling the Jews he said you have not passed this way hitherto for this is a different way it's not law but it's Grace and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you and Joshua spake unto the pr priests saying take up the ark of the covenant passed over before the people and they took up the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people and the Lord said unto Joshua now we're working with the spirit Joshua now okay this day will I began to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that you may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with thee and so the prophet of God came in our last day and preached that message so that we can see that these scriptures that are pertaining to Israel is now pertaining to us and as God was with Moses he is with us because we are underneath the anointing of Joshua who is Jesus Christ himself and the Lord said unto Joshua this day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all of Israel that you may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with thee and thou shall command the priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant saying we come to the brink of the Waters of Jordan you should stand still in Jordan amen because Jordan amen is also a sign of death so you come into the Jordan you stand still is that all right and Joshua said unto his children of Israel come hither and hear the words of the Lord your God and Joshua said hereby ye shall know that the Living God is among you now here Joshua said to God said to Joshua Joshua is now taken to the people and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites now see if God did it for them he'll do it for you sir he said under the Joshua Ministry every inhabitant of your land will be driven out amen right amen driven dri drive out from before you the Canaanites the Hittites the hivites the perizzites the girgashites the amorites and the jebusites you know we had a message on this years ago I I I can't find my notes but uh each one of these uh uh tribal uh people actually represents a work of the Flesh and um and hindrances so you got to understand that God is working with the same thing there was in the natural here is in the spiritual amen behold the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all of Earth passes over before you into Jordan now therefore take you 12 men out of the tribe of Israel out of of every tribe of man so that's why Jesus Christ himself Joshua had to take 12 because in the Old Testament he had told them taken told them to take 12 and so he himself took 12 Apostles right that's the scripture is that right Ephesians 2:20 and built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophet Jesus Christ being the chief Corner Stone and Joshua said unto the children of Israel come hither because you got to understand these 12 Le Le us amen came through right they came through and because they came through on the day of Pentecost we can come through they stand as a memorial amen as those stood Stones stood as a memorial for Israel amen uh those 12 Apostles stand as a memorial to us is that all right amen amen sure enough and now for take 12 men out of the tribe of Israel out of every tribe of man and it shall come to pass as soon as the soul of the feet of the tri priest that bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord of all of the Earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the Waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon a heap and you got to understand that their time of crossing over was not when the Waters of Jordan was low but the Bible tell us it was at his highest ple amen so this was a difficult time to cross over and that's what God makes it so so you can realize it's not you by power not by might might but by my spirit sayeth the Lord and it shall come to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over Jordan the priest bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people and as they bear the ark uh where were come unto Jordan and the feet of the priest that bear the ark were dipped into the brim of the water for Jordan overflowed all his Banks all the time all the time of harvest that the waters which came down from above stood and Rose up in a heat very far from the city Adam that is besides zaratan and those that came down toward the Sea of the plain even salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed over right against Jericho so you got to realize by the grace of God that what God was doing he was basically pushed positionally the positionally placing amen the children of Israel and uh so let's just have a word of prayer right now and I'll let you be seated Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us and we pray father that you be merciful to us father give us these things that we stand in need of and Lord we cry out every day Lord all during the day Lord for more of you father we realize we can't add a cubba to our statue but we know the man who can hallelujah oh we know the Creator and the make of all things father you are my father and Lord you are the master of all winds principalities and Powers I pray here tonight that you would just bless each and every heart in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated amen just remember uh brother uh uh Fields will be coming in tomorrow we will be having service on tomorrow night Friday Saturday and Sunday early I mean Friday excuse me Thursday Friday and Saturday early Saturday by the grace of God hallelujah so they took 12 men out of the people out of every tribe of man and those men had to go and pick up a stone from the bottom of the Jordan and they had to take those stones and build a heat so that when the children of Israel would see that it would be as a memorial remember amen he says remember remember and he even comes along when he dealt with his disciples he said always remember remember amen so listen I want you to understand that even when it comes to the communion amen of the saints of God you've heard me say this but if Jesus Christ can wash the bride's feet because that's what he did with Peter he stooped and he served his wife so therefore that's why brother brandham could truly say that eternal life is living for others if we're not living for others then we might we check our uh uh uh experience to see whether it's real or not amen so we're not going to be long tonight because like I said this is going to take forever trying to get finished because the more I see the more seem to unveil so we want to uh say by the grace of God that here by the the priest or I could put it this way is that those 12 disciples opened the way for us amen by the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen and that's why Paul was able to able to say you know except a man believe the gospel in which I preach let him be a curse see Paul told us as I said according to SEC first SEC uh second Peter 1 Chapter Paul talks about that interest being made and and I broke it down and said to you how throughout the church ages we built from Ephesus all the way up and so that entrance into the holies of holies could not have come in no other day outside of our day amen that's why it took a prophet Amen to come down and he was not just a prophet but he was a priest he also was a king is that right amen because God has made us priest and King is that right so you and I must understand amen that that brother even though brother Bram had to come along and tie up all the loose ends you got to understand that there were times amen he was Moses there were times he stood as Jesus there was times he stood as Joshua there's times amen he stood as David there are times that God was using his ministry Amen in so many ways amen because because he was a son of man revealing the son of man so what God was doing if you know anything about a play you know or or or story right they give you the uh uh the they first tell you in the first paragraph everything that's going to happen they build a body and at the end of the uh page or the or the or the or the uh work uh then they then they uh how could I said they recapture everything else it becomes um uh uh the the very Crooks of everything they recaptures everything else and then they bring it to the complete head and that's what the Lord did through uh the prophet of God he recaptured a lot of great events that took place I mean there was a time that he stood there and it was no no it was absolutely mzad de standing in human flesh amen because he literally turned his back Amen to the audience and he began to call out amen people's names their disease he discerned their hearts that was not William Brandon that was mckz standing there Amen in his flesh now I want you to understand that when you get the completion of God you get MDC you get Lord Jesus you get the word you get the complete full godhead of God inside of you amen and that's why the devil don't want us to uh come to that place but brother Bram even preached a message great is he that is in you and he took it out of First John 4:4 because the Bible tells us greater is he that is in in you than he that is in the world because if you recognize the man of God or The God that's in you you'll understand that he's omnipotent amen he is the uh potentate he is the head of all things and to be honest with you he's the only true Living God everything else is an illusion or some fake thing that Satan himself have set up now understand that when we we see what God was doing with the children of Israel they weren not just going over there to defeat Jericho but they were going to defeat every inhabitant of the land and only a few of them that really conquered everything now God told them he said now if you don't conquer them down the road they will become a thorn in your flesh and that's what has happened to most of us who are Christians we started out right we conquered almost everything in the land except those pet sins right those sins and those sins have come right back to torment us but God has given us a second chance amen where we can come back and says no you must die even as Samson said I must die with my enemy is that all right so you and I as the the men of God I was listening to uh the Oneness of God a unity in the church and brother brand tells us that we must fight the devil down I like I like the way he said that fight the devil down I mean just don't punch him but bring him down you know and so he kept saying that you got to fight him down because if you recognize that God is in you he first when he tells you that God is not he's already exalted himself above the word so your faith must come up there grab him and put him down where he belongs down under your feet is that right amen let us turn him to Ephesians 3 because I want you to understand the battle is not yours but is the Lord but you must surrender to him he's not going to fight for you if you don't surrender you to him is that all right you must surrender to him and Trust his word that that's the way it goes it's a battle I don't know about you but I got I've been getting victories in my life every day amen got a great big victory today I really had a wonderful time me and the Lord and and I just want to say by the grace of God you know it becomes clear and plain that if you trust this word you'll come out Victorious as the word of God said we don't have a thought coming is what the word word of God says I I was just telling a brother that the other day I said we always call it the voice of God until we want some to see it made different then it comes brother bram's voice yeah Ephesians the 3 chapter for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given to me toward you how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote a four in new few words whereby when we read you may understand by knowledge in the mystery of Christ I would ask anybody tonight what is uh the Seal of God in your forehead you know a lot of us you know think that there's something up here you know what brother R said it's not in your forehead he says it's in your heart under standing you got the seal see in your mind you know that you got it he said that's where it is the Seal of God is in your heart he said he said why God say he because it's your understanding that you got it hallelu whereby when you read you may understand by knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not made Unto the Sons of men as it is now revealed unto you his Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit so you haven't gone this way before amen see this is what he's writing here he says listen Israel you haven't gone come this way feans you haven't come this this is something that excuse me been revealed it is what I'm laying out to you and if you follow this you'll make it he says listen that the Gentiles should be f Hees and of the same body and the and the uh partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel because remember the Ark of the Covenant was nothing but God himself amen right I mean come on it was God's resting place which was amen your heart that's right symbolically of your heart but the point is is that you couldn't touch it and that's why God said in this last day the work that he would do will never be defiled hello I believe it was Troy or somebody was talking about that the other day somebody either I dreamed it or something but they said it'll never be defiled again why because it'll never be handled by man what you got amen what God is doing you God ain't let no man handle that that's God in you right amen God in you it's a is a personal relationship with you right but you know what you can't love God and and and not and hate hate your brothers right you can't even obey God until you obey one another that's right that's right if you can't serve me and I serve you you're not obeying God that's right and it's the truth you know brother B said that that in one case people say well I Don't Need No Man to teach me he said then you a liar and you're the scripture that's why God said in a five-fold Ministry these are the ones who perfect you these Ministries we're not like Samson or one of those giants that has six fingers we only have five let's move on when another Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men as it is not revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit that the gench child should be fa and of the same body and partaker of his promise in Christ by the gospel wherefore whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ so you can't search it scripture by scripture it is by Revelation that God have to bring these things into your heart and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers Heavenly places might be known by the church to manifold wisdom of God Accord according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and excess with confidence by the faith of him wherefore I desire that I faint not that ye faint not at my tribulation for you which is your glory now here I'm coming to the last part for this cause I bow my knee unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you excuse me according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his Spirit excuse me in the Inner Man Hallelujah here it is that that he might Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthen with might by his spirit in the Inner Man now he's basically bringing a synopsis exactly what Peter said see instead of saying Seven Virtues he's just telling you that the only way the inner man will ever be strengthened with might would be by his spirit so it's not by your your power or your strength the the inner man is what God is concerned with he ain't he ain't concerned about your flesh your flesh is nasty is condemned it will always be that way until you change but he says listen to The Riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in Your Hearts by faith amen what is Faith a revelation he's in there he's dwelling there that ye being rooted and grounded where in love there it is rooted and grounded in love and he ain't talking about filio he ain't talking about filio he's talking about agape love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the bread and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God Amen all the fullness of God now to him that is able to do don't even tell me God ain't able he's working with the statute of a perfect man he's working with Christ being formed in you bringing you into a fullness because he couldn't bring it Peter had to bring it and he's bringing it and breaking it down to you but here the Paul Paul is basically telling you amen that here the family of God Amen will be strengthened now that if he grants it to you you don't earn it that's right he gives it he grants it to you because of who you are you don't believe it Paul said God used me for an example I was a murderer I was a persecutor of the church I I I I made many blaspheming I was the least of them all but God granted me this amen H because of who I was and who I am I am in the family of God because of God's thoughts and his word spoken concerning me before the foundation of the world and this has been a mystery that has always been election amen now to him that is able to do what exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that work in US amen right unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages amen World Without End I hope you got it amen amen because here we are it's been a mystery you have been the mystery I'm I'mma tired right back Israel knew the outer Court Israel perhaps seen the inner court but they had never been behind the veil amen only the high priest amen and he and that was a mystery to Israel Amen on what was laying back there and God is coming about and he says now here is the mystery unveiled amen he read the veil into he exposed what was there and who come forth but the Bride of Jesus because we came out of the heart of Goden is that all right thank you Lord now we know by the grace of God you either born again or you're not and and if you're not you you you know you one of the reasons why you you you're getting frustrated all the time is because you're trying to put new wine in Old bottles you can't do that you can't do that you first got to get down and says Lord forgive me I am a sinner cleanse me of my in my heart amen accept me as right see because you can't well I've been baptized no no no no no baptism don't mean no good to you if you haven't repented that's right if you haven't gone to the Cross first cuz baptism is just an outward show of what has already taking place you got to get before the cross and say God I accept you as and there are many Christians who's never done that but yet they've been baptized hello but you got to go before God and you got to meet him at the blood meet him at the cross you got to look up amen and see who's on the on the pole y'all understand what I mean you got to look at your sins know you're wrong ask God to forgive you that's the beginning that's it Hallelujah that's the beginning otherwise you're trying to be a sheep right and with God ain't looking you know for the wolves and sheep clothes and he's not looking for that so God is looking for real sheep amen you know and like I said earlier there is no neutral ground Ephesians 4:30 most of us know that well said brother do I have the Holy Ghost I believe many of us do but you know what we still needing virtue we still at the bottom of the thing come on somebody we still at the bottom it ain't nobody's fault with your own cuz the word's been preached am Hallelujah come on somebody and brother brownon when he said that the R should be laying in the presence of the Sun that don't mean you got to be at my house to lay in it amen you lay in the presence of the sun wherever you are you got books you got tapes you got the word amen get in there that's how you'll be ripened you'll never be ripen if you don't know when you're wrong you got to know when you're wrong and this Bible is word is a book of correction amen but yet fill with love Ephesians 4 4:30 says and grieve not the holy spirit let me back up let no com let no corrupt communication perceived out of your mouth help us Lord because that Grieves the Holy Ghost did you know that but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hear us not the kind of kind of talk that you people don't even want to talk to you but it remember with Grace oh you know he that I love talking with that brother cuz always positive hello somebody listen so therefore it can be grieved you can be grieve you can grieve the Holy Ghost amen even though you're already sealed whereby ye are sealed until the day of your Redemption of the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all mou us now how can that be because you still wrapped in flesh you still wrapped in flesh so it's CA you're capable of G being sealed but yet grieve the Holy Spirit and when you do that sometime the devil will make you think you don't even have it because of your behavior ain't God good to us he's got a word for the devil every time the devil triy to accuse us of something God already got a word for him oh my goodness it's true it's true we look at things and and you know we must be a witness uh you know what and and and can I can I I wish I was I wish this was a Sunday morning I might have have to say it again sometime soon but you know what uh and I know we all come in tired I'm tired today I've been really busy and uh and stuff but you know nevertheless I I come to give my best my all and I I I'm I'm I'm I know that it ain't going to always be a jumping service but you know it's been a while since we had one and may God have mercy on us sir because we supposed to bring the fire with us and there should not be one or two individuals in here feeling out of place cuz they jumping and nobody else is no one else you know I look at this thing and I says come on folks we got to do something we got Young people they're depending on this anointing if we can't bring the anointing we might as well quit Church hello let me say it again if we don't bring the anointing we might as well quit church because it is the anointing that destroy the yolks these young people that's coming up these little kids amen they need to see God real amen not just law they need to see the supernatural happening among usen they need to and if we're not going to show them how they going to get the Holy Ghost with a dry service you got to have fire amen you got to have fire in here and if we going to have a dry service we might as well go to a denominational church and sit up there because they have it like that all the time but we must be a witness of Malachi 4 honestly those tapes of more spirit filled than most church services Lord and it's a shame it it really is a shame because we we come here like it's a duty it's not listen it proves we're not where we ought to be listen brother R said a lot of time we don't get our healing and deliverance he said a lot of time because of unbelief he said an unbelief would destroy us if it wasn't for the blood of Jesus Christ is that right and he goes on and he types that with Abraham and Sarah he said when Sarah laughed he said God couldn't destroy her because she was a part of Abraham but that unbelief made her laugh unbelief make us do what we do Lord unbelief makes us blind like I said when you are your eyes in my eyes are blind to the spiritual World somewhere the Delila got to us throughout the day amen because is that right when we get blinded to the spiritual things and we come in here and we having church and we we fail to see we come to meet God as a group amen not to hear Brother Brook's lecture as a group we come to hear God that's right and the more you pull on him the more he gives that's what he said brother B said amen and this is there anything too hard for God he says let's look at the holy come Spirit come uh spirit to come in the Supernatural oh let me put it this way let's not look for church haird and new dresses let's look for the Holy Spirit to come in the Supernatural and raise some things the church don't need a fa lift it needs a birth the Holy Ghost to come into the church and bring back and that believes the Supernatural and holds on and wait and waiting for Life coming of the Lord amen excuse me waiting for the coming of the Lord as if it might be any hour living in them conditions living in the condition that he may come any hour here she was in that shape saying now how could that happen in our modern time how could it happen to me in my condition but it happened just the same Abraham out there waiting with anticipation you see it wasn't made known unto her it was made known to them that was looking for it that's the that's the way it comes yet to those those who are looking amen so he was watching see that's the point if you're not looking for virtue you won't get none amen if you're not seeking God Amen for patience and longsuffering brotherly kindness all those you won't get it he's all of that yes and that's what God is looking for listen I don't care like you said well you didn't get it today it doesn't matter if I didn't get it today I get it tomorrow if I don't get it tomorrow it'll come after that but it's coming It Won't Stop until it's complete complete amen cuz the Bible said he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it we're talking about dyamics amen Dynamics and you know uh we look at these things and and I I've been I you know I don't know whether anybody else been troubled and when I say troubled uh I don't believe it's a lack of faith on my part or anyone else's uh uh but but I think about my sister Vanda every day almost praying and uh you know if it if it was something that God would reveal I I I would be more than happy I don't know what he's doing but I wonder how many others are concerned y'all hear what I'm saying because and and and I hope my brother don't mind me saying that but you know I put myself in her place and I don't know the kind of pain she's going through but I can see it's it's some sometime unbearable hello amen so you got to understand if so I put myself in her place and that's how I pray God help me if if there's be anything that I'm missing or not seeing or or if this is a test so be it but give me the the Revelation for victory see I mean it it's something and the doctors can't find out what it is but but I'm wondering is God got her there like that to make the church more concerned because I don't think we are I I really don't think we're concerned like God want us to but if you love her with a Godly love you'll be concerned and whether I preach it or not you'll be praying in your closet concerning her matter every day until it happens amen that's what the early church did when Divine love was there we can't just let her sit there and nobody's do nothing like Cas s s whatever will be will be no sir she's one of us and people I pray that God put a burden on the church heart Amen to seek God until that thing break from her whatever it is we know it Ain it's a spirit people love her love her like you love yourself and your own soul seek God you know to God do something that bothers me cuz we're the Church of the Living God where all things are possible amen and no Spirit should sit up in here comfortable none not one I'm seeking God I hope somebody else is in here seeking because that that that could easily be me or it could easily be my wife I am concerned listen he said being a witness we got to prove this thing there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection until we come to the place until we find that place and what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a face lift like a simonized job when there's done no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there's got to be a dynamic to make it workall and you know I had a dream or whatever it was and I I tell you about it not to lift myself up but I had a dream in the pill of fire came to me and uh it was it was an awesome dream and I thought Lord did I dream that was it my imagination what was it and then I went when I was at the wedding uh brother Dave Luellen came to me and says brother Brooks he said I got a to tell you about this dream I had of you he said I had dream that the God come down like it was on the when when he came down on Moses and when you walked out the room the glory of God came with you he said I tell you what I've never felt that place that that like that in my life not in a service or anywhere he said and I felt it in that dream I said well brother that was just a witness amen if God can give you a witness of me over there you know because I was wondering I asked God was it a dream was it something I imagined what it was all I know I'm not a Moses but I am just bride amen and I'm going tell you something that same pfy that came down on Moses will come down on us amen is that all right and how would he know I mean here I am preaching on the statute of perfect man and adoption and that God God coming down like it did on Jesus amen and I believe that's the way it's supposed to be and I'm waiting for it and I'm looking for it and it's going to happen yes sir nothing shall hinder God amen I I tell you what I learned a few things about the Lord today he's full of Mercy I can tell you that he's rich in Mercy is that all right amen amen amen hallelujah Hebrews 10:5 says wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offering thou West not but a body has thou prepared for me now listen that listen listen God don't care about your sacrifice nor your offerings God wants your body amen hallelujah that's what he wants he wants that body of yours under complete obedience to him is that all right hello amen listen brother B talks about two classes of people why people are so talked about he said there are two classes of people today them same classes that trying to do something to save themselves each one say I go to church every Sunday that's very good I want to be religious that's that's very good that's still under the law but when the other by going to church and being good is not something that you do yourself is something in you doing it for you the holy spirit in your heart and I brought that just to say when God is in you amen everything is in you Faith virtue knowledge temp all of that is in you and it is God in you doing it yes God in you doing it is that all right he said you men and women live a good life and love God by menal conception but the real hiding place is in your heart hid with Christ and when Christ the Holy Spirit comes into your heart he is in you with your Temperance he's living his own life through his own will through you I know it sounds awful but it's but it's right Christ so yielded you are that Christ speaks the kind of word he speak he thinks the kind of thoughts he thinks he would think through you he does the kind of works he would do through you you are yielded and rested thank you Lord oh my God if we could yield to God like we yield to some of these Devils we'd be all right hello [Music] somebody ain't God good to us that's right we need the Holy Ghost to be a witness there ain't no way you can be a witness without the Holy Ghost he wouldn't even let his disciples preach the the new gospel until they were endured with power he said go ye to Jerusalem and there you'll be a witness of me so the witness is the Holy Ghost how you going to say Jesus Christ is alive and you ain't got it amen hey somebody you got to have God on the inside Amen to know to be a witness he said a witness has to know something a witness has to receive an experience and you cannot be a witness of Christ until the Holy Ghost has baptized you amen Jesus would not permit his disciples to preach the gospel until they received the Holy Ghost yet they have been honored to walk with him three and a half years though they were holy men accepted in his sight but he would not let them go preach until they waited up there and got all the differences out of them and then the Holy Spirit came what the world needs today is that same feeling when the dumbing out come comes dumping out comes it needs a feeling what does the feeling do when it comes in where you will have doubt it brings Faith where you have indifferences it bring love where you have hatred it brings fellowship and then the Church of the Living God someday will be United under that one great head and that will be the head of God God into the unity of the body of Christ will be the governor and the king and the Lord over the entire church under his control then she will be received up under his control under his control it it this Rapture can't even take place until we completely yielded and surrendered under his control not your control not your flesh his control oh I love this part because you know I was thinking I said here they they they tore down the towels of uh uh uh when Towers there you know 911 and and uh now they building this great tower and we we've heard the harbinger and and you know I thought about this I I said you know they've done it every time every time God spank them and triy to give them a warning even in the days of uh when uh uh uh tow of Babel was built Nimrod and all they thought they can outsmart God now the thing about it is the only thing is it's just a mimic of what God is doing God is building a tower right God is building a skyscraper amen he's building a building that's what prophet said he said listen in the Oneness of unity he says today all of the towers they may build all of the rockets that they may find all of the socialism and communism that they may stir up all the ecclesiastic system will fail but in spite of all of it God will have a church United his King under his kingship by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus said so and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they should cast out Devils speak with tongues if they take up serpents or should drink any deadly thing it will not harm them see it goes all the way back to the same thing they always had or supposed to have is that all right just give me a few more minutes what am I saying if you're not seeing Dynamics in your life you need to see God more every one of us it ain't the preacher that's supposed to pray just lay hand he said if they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover amen it's not just my responsibility it's the church it's a order give a commandment or order given to the church is that all right amen so you and I are all guilty it's amazing how much the cares of the world can take the Life of Christ out let me read this scripture Galatians 4 but when the fullness of the Gentiles beginning at the fourth verse but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth a son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God have sent forth the spirit of his son in your hearts crying ABA father he says because you are Sons that's why you cry ABA father because you are son but it doesn't mean that you are fully adopted the spirit of adoption which is the Holy Ghost in you gave you birth to become an adopted son and brother brandham explained that to us how that God test and tries us amen and we either do well or we don't do bad but the report is given to God on a daily basis God don't wait on you know month by month it'll be too much he works with a daily basis me and reports you to God Amen he says now because you're Sons God have sent forth the spirit of sons in your heart crying Our Father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son than an heir of God through Christ and understand this now because you are a son and yet not fully adopted it doesn't mean that you can't get from your father what you need that's why you crying ABA father because you know he's the one that will supply your needs amen the only thing between a son and an adopted son is that the son is still learning the adopted son have learn has learn he's learned already and now he has the authority amen that his father had that's right all the authority that his father have he has but while you still Sons he can't give you full Authority until you have passed all your tests but now after that you have known God or rather are known of God how turn ye again to the weak and begly elements where you desire again to be in bondage You observe days and months and times and years I am afraid of you lest I bestow upon you my labor in vain Brethren I beseech you be as I am for I am as ye are ye have not injured me at all ye know how through infirmities of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first and my Temptation which was in the flesh ye uh ye desired not nor rejected but received me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus it what really gets me because the same Ministry that Paul had William brandham had the same he had to labor to bring people to birth he literally labeled and this is what Paul saiding because when he when the prophet of God came in our day we were under law the law of church ages right the dos and the don'ts that's what Holiness remember he said these are Nazarite people they wouldn't even wear jewelry and the Methodist but it was dos and don'ts it was law it wasn't life it was law and he comes around he says now look at the Methodist children look at the Methodist daughters now they're wearing jewelry shorts and everything else why because it wasn't a lie that's right and so he comes and he labors amen these people were Christians but they were just right there at the confession level so he was trying to bring them to a full birth and he labor with them right and he says listen even there's a time in you know Willam Brandon's life how the people loved him even called him God and all of that stuff you know and my point is here it is he says listen but Jerusalem is from above she's free it is the Bond woman that is in bondage right and you're not a bonds woman sir you are a free woman you're born free amen so therefore you know you are to be free and be a witness of your freedom amen so God listen say add to this and add to this because remember I brought out that quote the last time you can't ask God asks you can ask and he said you have not because you ask not you can ask and if you ask sincerely you'll get it am when brother Brooks I don't even care when as long as it get here my point is I keep asking till I get it till I see Christ completely formed in me I will not give him rest amen that's the scripture say don't give him rest to the glory of God is in Jerusalem and Zion don't give him rest God don't look at the outward appearance he proved that through David's election and how the children were brothers denominational big boys came before the prophet and you know the story how Saul was uh I'm trying to think which is the biggest Saul was anointed with the little what it call the uh is it the little uh vow and and and David was anointed with a a ear in other words the denomination got a little anointed and David got the kind that ran from all his feet and all the way down y'all hear what I'm saying it showed that this Saul was going to disobey God he was he was elected by man you know but when God elects you he anoints you he puts that anointing all over you is that all right so you and I must understand that you know David said uh he anointed my head with oil and my my cup runneth over and that's that's the believer that's that's the believer that's that's the kind of anointing God wants to anoint us with now I'm I'm going to come to this and I'm going to stop with St Luke 12:25 and I know I'm just talking my way through it but I really want us to get more serious about these messages that's been preached because I don't believe God going to have me coming around again now he might send somebody else through here that's going to preach it but listen people you got to get this now you can't Daily Bread not not not not bread for tomorrow daily amen and and this is what God is requiring of us and I believe if we work with God in this season as I said last week you know when it came this is got to be the season because amen you know when it came to Sam ballad and TOA look what where we at I mean we got it happening Among Us and almost every Church got one or two something's going on even like it was amen when it comes to uh uh uh believe the sign all that you got to realize there are people now who coming who are in this message who are now coming to say I can't do it they're recognizing who they are and when they do that you know what they saying my name is not on the book see they're saying my name is not on the book and that's what happened to tobah when he thought he was they couldn't find record they couldn't find his name in the lineage so he was basically pushed aside and so when he was pushed aside amen he he became uh nehemiah's enemy Israel enemy once served in the same church but now BEC an enemy because amen they wouldn't accept him but the truth of the man is he did not fully believe because I'm going to tell you something even if his name wasn't in on the lineage if he truly was a Believer he would have stayed anyhow that's right am he would have become a proelite or something he wouldn't have fought against it he wouldn't have fought against it Luke 12:25 and which of you will taking thought can add to his statue one Cuban you know I look at this and I say why did God why did God have doub in Thomas there why because he knew so many people let me put it this way even though Thomas didn't have the Holy Ghost yet he was elected and I'm going to tell you something he might have been doubting but he still never went with the 70 that's right Lord y'all hear what I'm saying he didn't have the strength to go with them he might have had problems but he still knew he couldn't go with the 70 am it was that election that kept him folks that's what I'm trying to tell you y'all we look at these things and we have all these battles but you got to recognize I'm yet here I'm still here I'm still here amen Lord that's the beauty of it I'm still here no matter what I'm still here like that blind man I might not be able to read on right but I want you to know whose side I'm [Laughter] on that's right I may not understand all the mysteries of the thing but I still want you to know whose side I'm on I was telling a brother that today I said man I said if I have known what I know now way back then I'd have been way up the road but you know what I tried my best to teach it right if you then be be be not able to do that thing which at least why why take you thought for the rest come on if you can't do it why you why you worried about it you got to go to the man who can do it for you right it's like my I love my my grand kids you know especially when they can't open something it might be as small as a little candy rapper cuz they make them tough nowadays and they come and say grandpa can you open this for me they don't just give it to me and walk away they write they're right there till I unwrap that piece of candy and they waiting not for the rapper for the candy and that's how it is with us we can't just ask God to do something for us and just leave him you stay right there till he give it you wait right there until the candy is received amen he can do whatever he want to do with the rapper but bring the candy cuz the kids ain't interested in the rapper they interested in the candy you and I we are interested in the ver Virtues Of God we want his character you ask him for it he's the only one that can supply it and you stay there till you get it now I got to believe the word I got to believe it because brother said if you go there believing you going to get the Holy Ghost even if that's what you need he said you'll get it amen he said because God want to give it to you more than you want it but what it is is that unbelief oh if will it be this time how I don't know how we think it my mind but you know a lot of time you want to pray and the devil say well you done thought all these thoughts all day do you really think he's going to give it to you my point is when did he make it labor when did he make it work for you that's right I thought the Holy Ghost was a gift and I thought it was an unmar gift God ain't giving you the Holy Ghost cuz you screamed to the height of your voice God has G you the Holy Ghost because your faith said amen yeah I mean if you got to screen to the height your boss to to convince your faith inside whatever inside that is that your do it whatever it takes but he operates by faith not by sound am I making sense and he goes on and talk about father knoweth that you have need of all these things working with the worldly good but rather seek ye first seek ye the kingdom of God and all the these things shall be added unto you fear not little flock for it's your father good pleasure to give you the kingdom is that okay I'm not trying to put fear as such in us because even if you fear going to hell that still won't save you it ain't what fear is not what God is looking for he's looking for somebody to love him right I was talk thinking about this the other day I said you know why John laid in his bosom John knew where he came from and he wanted to go back there I came from his bosom I go back to his bosom amen he was magnetized to where he came from and that's where we are we're magnetized to where we come from our desire is to go back into the book wiom of the Lord Jesus amen you love the Lord let's stand Hallelujah Jes Hallelujah hey father God we come before you Lord as humble as we know how we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy God you've been better to us and we've been to ourselves Lord we just pray Lord tonight and that you would just move move in in the people's hearts father we all have come short but we desire more of you every day Lord we're asking father that you would fill us with more of you Lord oh God we want to live we want to be completely surrendered oh Lord to all of our ways dead to ourselves rotted that we might just be a shell for the Living God help us right now Lord we can't do it on our own and except you drop the Revelation in our hearts we will be just like the world blind to what your will would be father but I pray Lord that you would let your grace and mercy be upon us according to that abundant grace that have been ad ministered to us Lord we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen
