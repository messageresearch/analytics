TRANSCRIPT
========================================
myself i thank you for those reigns that you use as lord in those dark times in the night seasons how you lead us and how you guide us and protect us from unseen dangers and harms lord jesus we pray tonight that you would bless the service and bless all of the hearers of our via uh youtube bless those who are here tonight give us lord jesus what we stand in need of and we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i like to entitle the message tonight i will wait until my change come i i one of the things that i rejoice in knowing that there is only one god i really wouldn't know how to serve three and to be honest with you i'm not good serving the one and by his grace we'll make it the word of god is so steadfast it's it amazes me how god could have so many and never lose one amen i remember one time being at the fairground with my little children and i lost one he got lost in the crowd we don't know how he got out of our reach but it was a time of panic because you all know that you know when you're at the fair and this has been years and years ago in south carolina people love to steal children so it was a horrible time for us and you know the thing about it you get angry for a while but when you see him that anger turns into joy but i marvel at god how he can have so many and he says i i'll never lose one i'm glad to understand predestination and election most of all i'm glad to understand what grace is because that's what really saves us it's not his justice it's his grace we've seen how god has been able to hide his ways away from men and so none of his ways can be corrupted by any man because he always keeps him a secret even the coming of the lord what god has done in this last day and and as i was studying i really god quickened something to me because i said lord i i need to see this i need to see the error as well as the truth because we must realize by god's grace that the way the word is written it could never be taken literally until i say it is first taken literally until god reveals it every word of god must be revealed because the bible said that the letter killeth but but the spirit gives life you know i was talking with a brother the other day and i was we were talking about the the automobile and how i can't think of the prophet that spoke of it the old testament and he talked about the the how it be like a torch the carrots running down the highway or whatever and how they would be jostling into each other well who would have known what that was i mean we would have thought what a torch was and that day was a flame of fire and a man was holding a stick with it but in our day we understand that to be the automobile it's like all of these symbolisms throughout the word and in the book of revelation you know you read the book of revelation and you think you're going to see monsters you know things that these prophets couldn't understand they didn't know how to describe them and what they could do with the word is just basically explain to you what they saw and being able to comprehend it's like heaven we can't comprehend that and by faith we believe it you know what i'm saying i mean just think if you were transported if you had lived in the days of the roman days and was transported into this day and and without the uh the instruction or the constraints of the holy spirit you would literally faint or die uh because you could not you would not be able to uh comprehend you know the lifestyle of of of this day and to see what they're doing and to see a man running down the road in a car with no horses i mean you would think that it's the most powerful witchcraft you ever seen so you got to understand that when god speaks something it takes god to interpret his own word if we try to interpret it we always messes up for an example i'm saying all of these things so you understand that that's what made israel miss jesus the first time they interpreted his word they thought he was go come one way and he came in such a humble way they missed it now god can't change he's the same yesterday today and forever and so however he did it the first time he'll do it again and listen he was here for such a long time 30 something years and they still didn't know he was here they had no idea who he was and only a few people like anna and you know simeon and different ones you know but even his own mother denied his birth even at the temple you know she struggled with peer pressure pressure from people and she ran up to jesus when he was teaching in the temple thinking he was lost know ye not that uh he said uh your father mary said uh your father joseph and i we've been looking for you and he says know ye not that i'm about my father's business signifying that joseph was not his father i wonder did she catch it because the word is always going to correct us in our air thank god for that one of the greatest mysteries of of all time is the coming of the lord so the lord just so quickened something to me oh my god it was wonderful and maybe i'll be able to share it and you know i i've read the scripture and and you know because let me tell you how it's difficult even in words to express what it really is it's just like when jesus said to his disciples when tabitha was dead or when when when lazarus was dead he kept saying lazarus sleeping and listen the word is perfect because lazarus could not be a true christian or believer in christ and be dead he would sleep now in order for jesus to uh make them understand he had to condemn sin he had to come back to their language and their understanding lazarus is dead let's go wake him think about it oh my god oh it amazes me and even so paul talks about it he says oh death where's your your sting oh grave where is your victory and then paul comes right back around and said the dead in christ there is no death in christ but that don't that's the only way he could express it to the people because they were concerned about their dead loved ones but the revelation is they're not dead they're alive because they're in christ and so when we understand what god is saying and what he's doing in this day it'll give us a better revelation you cannot die you can't make the scripture lie jesus said if you believe in me and you believe in me and trust in me you accept me and confess me with your mouth you have passed from death unto life you're either dead or you're alive but the bible said once you give your heart to christ at that moment you enter into eternal life now let me ask you something what is it to enter into eternal life because eternal life is a dimension because the seventh seal is a dimension because the seventh seal is christ it is god it's where god dwells and so what happens is that dimension that dimension comes into your heart which is god and remember now we're we're living in this this threefold you know three three three dimensional world i think it was just with richard i mean come on uh let me just pull this off right now you know how we used to draw you know how in elementary you just draw your little figurines and everything was so flat even the cartoons in our day our day my day was just flat they had they weren't three dimensional nowadays they could make the cartoons look so real but they can't go beyond that and see that's what the message has come to do make us go beyond the dimensions we've been locked into because this dimension amen rest that the stronghold of this dimension is time without time you and i would never know the speed of light because there would be no such thing without time you would know uh uh uh can i say it like that what how were you awake and what hour you go to sleep and this time was placed because i want you to know that time is a part of eternity but time is also goes back to eternity everything god is eternal so we realize by god's grace god allowed this time you know to come in to to basically give us understanding of redemption of him himself and to make you understand that in his world there is no time it's eternal so let me ask you a question so when god gives you eternal life what happens to you you're no longer controlled by time i think what brother brother richter said that time is a prisoner it it really is it locks you in you know you got to go to work on this time you get off from work you know you don't have you you just don't have time just to do just what you want to do time without time there will be no aging because time makes you age how old are you you understand what i'm saying but god come to do away with time but before he can do away with time he must first do away with time in you the eternal listen if god is eternal and you're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus there is no time amen so that you can understand that time will be no more doesn't happen just at once sure it moves but we realize that it comes to the ending of all things and at the ending of all things you come to what eternal life and that's the seventh dimension amen and so we realized by the grace of god when the message came to you you accept it in yourself in you time will be no more amen because when you accept the message and you receive the holy ghost amen you are now eternal you have been born again and if you can understand what i'm working with you'll understand that you have the power to conquer time amen it was shown in elijah he outran a chariot amen it showed in jesus he walked through a wall amen now the reason why this look like a wall is because it's moving slowly but all of these things are moving molecules but you see we can't see that because of this dimension and to make you understand that even as as as the radio waves move through this building or even dimensions moving through this building we can't see it because it's going too fast and you and i have seen it you know you're on a bicycle and you're going slowly and you can see the sport wheels right but if you speed it up it becomes one and that's what's happening now time has began to blend into eternity and death is swallowed up because remember time and death comes together it was lucifer amen when when he when he rebelled against god god placed him into time because remember he was once eternal or of that eternal being and from that point on we find out that time conquered all men amen that's why god get real he will get rid of it and everywhere you say well what do you mean brother listen my time here on earth would be different if i lived in jupiter on jupiter or mars we we regulate our time by the 24 hours the rotation of what we call around the sun and all that stuff but listen how long will it take jupiter to do the same thing so that time element will be different listen time will so be no more you and i will never need a son because in eternity you don't need the sun i don't believe there's a sunrise in sunset in heaven it's a different dimension god is the light and remember there was a light before there was a light before there ever was a sun there was a light that light was the light of god here in first thessalonians thessalonians uh uh here paul is saying he says in the fourth chapter beginning at the 13th verse he said but i would not have you be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye saw or not even as others which have no hope now he calling them asleep don't you know when you're in christ that's what you are amen you say but prove that to me brother branham said when jesus raised from the dead and he went by the paradise he didn't have to knock on the door and says wake up when he went beyond the curtain of time they were active they were doing things but yet here on earth in time they were asleep the bodies were i got a question before let me ask let me ask this question because i no i'll ask it later i want you to understand that we we have these things in our mind and if we're not careful we'll miss god because we don't understand the seventh seal and what god is doing for us now right now is your most crucial time the time we've that god is changing you from glory to glory this is your time where the the power of this of the spoken word is now being manifested through you and by you this is why we we we can't afford to allow ourselves to be distracted with all of the things that's going on because god is making us into his own image and likeness don't worry about pressure it's going to come it's going to test you it's going to show what's in you and what's not in you today was one of my testing days only god can grade it but in all of that i could see god moving you know in me and i want him i want him to show me all my errand ways so so they can be corrected now and and i love the lord i love him because i realize this grace has given me a life in me that changes me i can't change myself i've tried so many years to do to do so but the bible tells me if i have a willing mind i love that scripture he counted as soul he counted as being done and i have a willing mind my willing mind is to wield that god would make me perfect even as he is perfect he said for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which are which is sleep in jesus will god bring with him now you can't deny the scripture it's amazing what god is going to do and is doing and has done because i believe that the god is the lord has slipped something over on the devil and he has no idea what he's working with amen amen and you and i must understand that we're not alone i love that no no no no no the bible said that the the the the angel of the lord in camp about us is that right and also in in hebrews it says whereby we are we are encamped about with so great a cloud of witnesses what is these witnesses for to edge us on to push us on you can make it you can make it it's in you to make it the power of the resurrection let me ask the question let me ask the question before i go any further because i'm dealing with this when jesus rose from the dead the bible says let me put it when he was crucified when he died on calvary the bible says and then the graves will open the graves weren't open on easter it was open when he died somebody helped me here so if the graves were open let me ask you a question do you really think that all of the earth just opened up and no there was nothing like that ain't what happened can you imagine how many holes would have been in palestine that's what the way people believe now when the rapture take place the graves are open and all of these oh no it will not it's not going to be that way if if so it wouldn't be a secret and jesus resurrection was a secret and all of them do you think that think about it now you're talking about coming from all the way from the garden of eden all the way up all those people that died in in jehovah was walking around why didn't everybody see him the city would have been overcrowded they were there they were in just a different dimension and god allowed a few people to see them amen but they were there yes sir jesus help me lord see what we fail to see is there's so many things happening right now and because we're lacking it we're not aware of it we're not looking for it and therefore we don't see it and so we realize and so let me clarify something this is what the lord showed me and you can correct me on this if you like because i said the bible says and i got that scripture down here in luke it talks about the resurrection when when jesus uh let me go down to it uh when he ascended right and the lord showed me this today luke 24 26-32 and i said what happened at the sounding of the thunders that's that's the question now you and i must understand that here was jesus and his disciples right he was to a sin you had two angels down there now i'm assuming they were moses and elijah i don't know doesn't give them names but if i go along with the way it was before a mount transfiguration it was moses and elijah and you and i must understand there are going to be two prophets there when he returns now the bible says that when he comes it will be in like manner let's read it oh not christ you have suffered these things oh that might be the wrong one i'm looking at yeah that's not the right one i mean axe approach i'm sorry acts the first chapter forgive me acts the first chapter beginning the ninth verse and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfast toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel whoever they were they were also at the grave site when miriam came up which also said you men of galilee white stanley gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manna as ye have seen him go into heaven and i thought and like manna there was no gentiles no gentiles saw his ascension and no gentile was there when all the others ascended with him but they said there was a cloud [Music] and and i thought now lord i don't understand because like man of which one what we looking for what are we looking for remember the seven seal was a mystery first of all nobody knew that we were going to have a gentile prophet brother branham is a part of the seventh seal mystery there had never been a gentile prophet other than balaam and you know whatever he was but my point is with those people standing there seeing jesus ascended where were all the others where where were those who rose from the dead where were they those who came up out of the grave where were they it's a good question isn't it not because he said that's the way he would return but my question is return to who and when i when when the lord quickened this to my mind i said oh my god at the at the at the uh coming of the lord when jesus literally come the way he should come like he came here moses and elijah would be preaching to the jews and you got to understand at that time you know we're now preparing for what the millennium so jesus christ comes again but he's coming again with what clouds and who were the clouds his army the host they were all dressed in white coming to what rule and to be a part of that millennium just something that you could think about so if that be the case what was this seventh seal about what was jesus doing he was outside the church people said well he could not have come that wasn't him well just like i said the other day in the preaching if he didn't come who was that knocking at the door in laodicea knocking trying to get in it was jesus and he came but what they didn't see he did not come in the way they thought he was going to come he came amen in the form of a prophet not that brother branham was jesus no no no no he was a son of man revealing the son of man it was god coming again and at that time we know amen the prophet god said what time is it sir he said he said laodicea was going to go into a sleep and that's what has happened and he prayed lord deliver us keep us fill us with the holy ghost don't let that happen to us go listen to it that's what he said and you got to understand if that be the case there was a message and the message had to do with revelation i mean matthew 25 go you out to meet him come out of laodicea come out of her come out of mr babylon go ye out to meet him and the only way you can meet him is you got to be dressed hide in him hidden in in in in in in christ amen see the mystery of this thing is that god is creating even now himself in you it's not the oh in the twinkling of an eye folks when that happens it's over amen we would have changed and understand listen brother brandon said this when he went behind the curtain of time he said there were men and women thousands upon thousands running to him my precious brother but here they were asleep but there they're alive and well amen they were quickened you say well let's go back to the scripture then you say what do you mean let me go back to the time when jesus rose from the dead you and i know that here was these righteous and the unrighteous was in the same dimension the difference was that there was a gulf between the right and the wrong the rich young ruler was in hell or torment and and and lazarus was was in the bosom of abraham or paradise whichever way you want to call it and they could see each other huh but what happened is when jesus rose from the dead he was setting everything in order he emptied out paradise and left those souls that were in hell and that torment there but he took those that were in paradise on the righteous side and they were quickened into another dimension amen which we call the sixth but what happened to their graves you understand nothing happened to their graves it was the man that was out of the shell that god dealt with it ain't this that god is working with is the inner man amen your perfection is now being you're being perfect perfected in the inner man and it's not you he's the carpenter amen you understand me he's molding us he's making us in his own way and we have no idea like even brother branham said he said i can't even describe the bodies those people were in he's but all i know is i could feel them i knew they were real this body must come into the statue of a perfect man in order for redemption to be complete yeah you understand what i'm saying oh let me say that again this body this this body when i'm talking about body the person in this body must come into the statue of a perfect man the person inside the body in order for god to redeem the body amen amen amen you see it's not by power it's not by might but it's by my spirit said the law you don't have to worry about it can i say it like this would a man impregnate a woman the seed and the germ is already ordained to do what it's supposed to do and all that woman has to do is feed it and it comes up healthy unless the devil gets into it but the devil can't get into this you understand me because you have been preserved he's a preserver he keeps you the thing is we must allow ourselves to separate ourselves from the flesh you're no longer he says i'm no longer you know william branham how he said it but i'm no longer isaiah and clara brooks son i've been born again i'm being changed and now i'm learning how to separate this from the real me amen and i'm learning how to allow him to take control of this false man amen this crook amen that's what he is and god is learning us teaching us to do it how by the spoken word the same power of the original atom is in the power of the second atom and the second adam always created by the spoken word amen you've got to speak to your situation that's why he allows situations to come up in your life so that you can learn like a baby how to speak you can't worry about the three dimensions you got to call it like abraham call it you got to look to the unseen that's that sixth that seventh dimension and you gotta call it and that god will make that thing happen amen he'll bring that visible he'll bring it into visibility amen amen hallelujah this is more than church entity this is the building of a bride hallelujah should work right way to praise him jesus christ the same yesterday brother branham said we we've had years now there hasn't been too much done but i truly believe that we're entering into the greatest time this world has ever seen i certainly believe that there is coming a time and it's at hand now of god going to do going to make himself manifest the greatest he's ever done in all ages come on somebody this is the ending of time time will be no more one of these days he said we come out of and then of eternity steps into a little time space here we step out of time back into eternity yes sir we was before there was a world then we came into the world and we go out of the world back into the unknown to us now amen now in here we've had our savior come here to earth god himself made himself manifested to us and give us the hope of each everlasting life eternal life and also in there he promised us joy and happiness and contentment which is the earnest of our salvation that we have now as a golden inheritance hey i like that as a golden inheritance jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever 1955. it's good ain't no time in the message now no time yes so you and i must understand by god's grace that when god brings us to this place and we see what we are and who we are then all of a sudden it quickens us amen let me ask you a question what happened you believe the message something quickened you amen and when it quickened you it took you from laodicea into the word yes amen not that your body changed position it was your soul it changed position and now the headstone listen just like i was saying to somebody else the other day i said we i i didn't think about it but the bible says let this mind be in you that was also in christ do you understand what that means think about that that has nothing to do with your reasoning it has nothing with your processing or however you think his mind you can't comprehend the way he thinks but he says let it be that's all that's something god says let this mind be a state of being you have the ability to receive the mind of god amen and with the mind of god all things become possible no fear imperfect love but that doesn't come by reading that comes by god yes amen he has to anoint you amen like even though david was a prophet he needed samuel to anoint him jesus was the son of god but he needed god to anoint him amen see the anointing must bring it to you because you can't see it that's why no matter how jesus talked his disciples couldn't see it because they were carnal and he said the carnal mind can't perceive the things that are of god it takes a spiritual mind you can't have a spiritual mind unless a spirit mind is in you and that spirit mind is god himself amen see where we are and listen there is no way you ask god for something good and he refused to give it to you there is no way if you ask god for his mind that he'll refuse you must i say this though he makes all things beautiful in his time [Laughter] he's still working with time he comes with it now he knows how to work with it hallelujah march mark 4. let's go to mark 4 10 through 12. i'm enjoying myself i don't know what y'all feeling but i'm enjoying myself because i'm seeing things that i've never seen before now now now people then how is this rapture going to take place if it's a secret how is it going to take place and if so is it being take is it happening now absolutely yes yes it is amen the brother brown said it he said it he said the shout the voice in the trunk as he descends as he descends descend from where that seventh dimension he descends amen there's a lot more i want to say but y'all might think i'm crazy anyhow in all of this you must understand if he descended he comes to do something brother branham call it the gathering amen see because right now this is the gathering of the wheat and the gathering of the tears yes amen you understand me this is a gathering you understand me and the bible tells us that we are baptized into what one body by the holy spirit and the word of god says when i see the blood i pass over you amen and even at the exodus of egypt israel and egypt there was a gathering yes amen everybody that was going to leave out of egypt had to gather underneath the blood amen and understand everybody that's going to leave out of this egypt has to gather under the blood and the blood you've got to find out god's place of worship underneath the blood and where's the blood the bleeding bloody word of god is this message mark 4 10-12 and when he was alone they that were about him with the 12 ask of him the parable let me say this to you don't reject what i'm saying i need you to at least think about what i'm saying because if if you got a denominational way of thinking the rapture is going to take place more than likely you're going to miss it like layer the seal wheel because they're going to say even the foolish version i thought the rapture would take place before these these days come upon the earth and brother adam said they will hear a voice saying he's already come and you missed him that's how much of a secret yes sir that's how a difference that's why you know like i said he came as a baby they didn't see him he was at 12 years old they didn't see him he came as a grown man and instead of seeing him they call him a devil right so he always he always confound the wise and he reveals himself to these simple-minded people that just want to see him come we don't care how he comes we don't care how he does it just as long as it's done amen and we're part of it we're not going to stumble at this because if you live a holy life before the lord and you trust in the word of god he'll reveal and he'll quicken you to the things that you need to know for an example you know when god quickened peter to who he was ever all the other disciples didn't see it they didn't know it but it didn't make them less a an apostle you know god had his appointed time think about it you think about the resurrection how many times he revealed himself to his disciples in different ways the seventh seal who jesus was raised from the dead and here it was jesus himself in a form that they couldn't recognize him in in fact luke says their eyes were holden see what i'm saying and yet here he came and guess what he did after the resurrection he broke the word started from genesis or all the way up through the prophets explaining who he was and all they could say oh but didn't our heart burn then open according to luke 24 44 45 then open he their understanding to the scripture all that time and they still couldn't see open their understanding to the scripture that this christ was not only christ but he was lord amen can you imagine how they felt talking to the word talking to him and says oh we just thought he was going to be the one [Laughter] and jesus let him talk just whoa we thought he was going to be the one huh but what happened he died in a way they couldn't see nor understand even though he told them so amen and then when mary went running to them said i've seen the christ they say you crazy see the unbelief but the change came and remember now peter was spiritually was dead he was a real christian he had been justified he was sanctified but he still had to go to pentecost he didn't receive a spiritual mind until he got the holy ghost because up before then he wanted to kill folks you see what i'm saying but the moment you see what i love this thing is is that god is he loves i don't know god loves drama [Laughter] he loves to take us through it and it's for his own pleasure his own good he knows what's in the man have you considered job you understand what i'm saying and think about it people no matter how small you think you are tonight god chose you to be bride it'll make your head explode your heart explode if you really think about it too much oh because you were good no you're not good because you've been so great today no you haven't been great then a great thing about you you know we're just not appreciative enough we don't see it it's just become too common and the thing about it is what we do we we work these things in our mind i don't care about what other people have thought there's supposed to be something new you should see and understand as you grow in christ because if you're standing still with the teachings you had years ago something's wrong because god is progressive this message brother branham said is like a rocket it goes up and five comes out and break then one goes up and five comes out of that that's the seventh seal it's supposed to unveil unveil itself as we go on it's never supposed to be like the denomination stuck in one place preaching the song same message getting the people to shout and all that kind of stuff it's more than that it's supposed to bring a change and the change much first than you start in your heart not your head help us jesus let's go i i've stayed too long on these let me hurry up a 10th 10th verse and when he was alone they were about with him 12 ask of him the parable and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables you understand me so now you're talking about two classes of people there's a people that god has said you're ordained to receive greater revelation you are ordained to see the mystery of the these things that i'm speaking but then there's another group that is there and they're not supposed to see it that's right it will always be a parable to them and the seventh seal in the mystery of what god did in this day is not supposed to remain a parable that's right amen something that you don't understand and you can't explain even the portion remember i said this the other day even the person unless you believe brother brown is going to come back and explain that to us even the portion brother brandon said i couldn't figure it out it must be figured out and it will be figured out but i believe that's the bride's portion amen and she's getting it she's getting it just like rebecca amen right when she watered the cameras and watered the man all that abraham asked that her his men be watered but she caught the latter part of that revelation that joined her and isaac together amen unspoken but manifested because brother branham said it like this he said god was working on both ends eliezer and teller god told her amen and that's the way it is now amen that seeing they may see and not perceive hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them you understand me so the thing that's hidden from them becomes sin it becomes unbelief brother branham said it like this he said we must remember that the seventh seal is the end of time of all things i used to wonder what do you mean the end of times everything is still here but watch everything everything is ending we're now approaching armageddon whatever that is the earthquake that he talked about now that thing is more locked and loaded than it ever been you can't deny the condition of the world is worse than it's ever been amen murders and everything else are days of noah whatever you want to call it i believe we're beyond that we're in a worse age we're in the darkness of all darkness but guess what the darkness is just before the dawn yeah amen that's right the things written in the seven seal book sealed up of the plan of redemption from from before the foundation of the world it's every bit ends it is the end it is the end of the struggling world it is the end of the struggling nature it's the end of everything don't it look like it's coming to an end and ever since the sea has been opening everything has been moving on a faster pace much faster pace right is the end of the trump is it the end of the vials is the end of the earth it's the end of the time time runs out the bible says in matthew 7 uh chapter uh revelation excuse me 17 10 chapter he says that time runs out the angel said time will be no more when that in that day of this great thing to happen so what is he saying even for the christian laodicea you're dead you're done but the bride of jesus christ i'm working with you but you're no longer in time you're in eternity it's the truth you've got to accept that though you be in time you are in eternity because eternity is in you amen hallelujah hallelujah you've been quickened and translated we're now sitting in heavenly places where in christ jesus amen we're standing perfect blameless justified as though we've never sinned in the first place why because god erased time and he erased the history that went with him amen is that the truth amen the bible said abraham staggered not at the promise of god amen and if you didn't have an old testament you wouldn't have known nothing about what abraham did that's right amen everything runs out that's what i'm saying it's a process people boom boom boom boom it's coming to an end everything's coming to an end and you and i know it you feel it you see it the earth groaning never in the history of the earth have we seen so many volcano eruptions ever the ring of fire is active brother bradley said it i think i heard someone tell me this and whether he said or not he said with the way you watch it when that when that when that he called it a dragon begins to wag its tail and it's wagging it people worried about yellowstone yellowstone got nothing no power over the believer what we don't know if it ever erupts whenever it goes i don't know but i do know one thing if the fire that nebuchadnezzar uh set up for the hebrew boys couldn't burn them amen amen we serve the same god amen and understand those people that went to the lion's den and now they chose to go that way they hear him hebrews said some got there delivered some did not but they faith hell that's what your faith gonna have to do because i'm gonna tell you something at the end of the day you're going to be persecuted you better believe it this message is going to be tried you're to be the only one that won't join into that union amen and they're coming after you but you got to know what you're possessing huh you got to know what's in you the bible said if god be for you no man can be against you everything runs out in this time the end of the of the seventh seal notice is the end of the church age is the end of the seventh seal it's the end of the trumpets is the end of viles an end of the ushering in and all see if you didn't understand that millennium you think it all happened no no it's progressive progressive but it's the seventh seal changed everything at the breaking of the seventh seal it changed the order of everything and what happens is no longer running this way it's now running this way to end everything up you understand what i'm trying to tell you it's like a film brother branham said it's just like fire a rocket in an air and that rocket explodes here and it goes up and then explodes again it puts the fire star it put five stars one of those stars explode blows out five stars from it and then one of them stars explodes and blows out what he's trying to say it will continue to unveil itself it is a mystery it is a secret but it's given to you to know the mysteries as long as you stay under the shekinah you understand you stay under the word of god for this day god will begin to unveil things to you don't be afraid to see new things because whatever you see you'll find it in the word it's just hidden in there is that right it's true malachi 4 william branham ministry was hidden in the word we would have never seen it when it was always there acts 2 38 though it went through the whole church ages it was always there why couldn't they see it because of the time god worked with the time he makes all things beautiful in his own time almost done it's just ends up time for the world it is a time for this it ends up time for that it ends up the time for this it ends up time for that everything just ending up on the seventh seal now how is it going to do it that's what we don't know isn't it we don't know brother branham is good at that it's even the time of all these things and the ushering in of the millennium even if brother branham tried to tell us how would he have told us we've got machines and things that he'd never seen before and the only thing he could tell us is to watch russia yeah now he says not only just watch russia but watch that purple curtain and if you don't see that something's wrong with your eyes notice the breaking of the seals was so great that heaven was hushed by it in silence for the space of a half hour now it is a great what is it it's was hushed heaven there wasn't a thing moved for a half hour he talked about heaven another dimension and whatever was happening in heaven god was on earth preaching bringing the word unveiling the scripture to us calling a bride see and that's what people don't understand they try to you know i've had so many people try to explain that i don't know how long a half hour is with god in heaven if there's time at the space of a half hour these stars falling see brother say these stars falling into their consolation back yonder that angel coming and said as john was sent to win to line up the old testament and to bring forth the introduction of christ now let me tell you like this if brother branham didn't do that what john did we need another prophet he did it and and this is what gets people they can't understand it comprehend it because when the seventh seal was broken and those that mysterious cloud formed out there and he called it his lord he said that's my lord he did the same thing john the baptist did the same thing he pointed jesus out he pointed his coming amen he pointed his coming now how are you going to argue with those things all i'm saying is there's so much i don't know i'm just giving you what i do know of what i do see and as john baptist went to wind up the old testament and bring forth the introduction of christ a message will wind up the loose ends and we'll introduce the messiah just before his what coming the message of the last days what his coming the message of the last days his coming the message of the last days y'all understand english yes notice the pro the mighty angel swore with an oath that time would be no more now i don't want to keep you too long just think of this a minute now now listen the angel come down from heaven see the other seven angels of the seven church ages with earthly angels but this angel all the message is finished the seventh angel winds up the whole thing and this angel come not to the earth uh not to the earth he isn't a man from the earth as a messenger to the church age that's finished but the angel brings the next announcement and an angel means a messenger and he comes down from heaven clothed in that pillar of light cloud with a rainbow over his head and a rainbow is a covenant it was christ with one foot on the land and one on the sea and swore that time will be no more amen where are we at sir what are this is about i'm asking you the other angel was messenger men of the earth but this angel to the church of laodicea to the angel of the church of ephesus messengers of the earth see men messengers prophets and so forth to the church but this one didn't come from the earth he came come down from heaven because the mystery is all finished and when the mystery is finished the angel said time shall be no more and seven thunders threw their voices out there's more i could say but my point is i'm trying to get us to see by god's grace can i read this last one and i'll be done and that was is this signs of time sir this is the same message he says now listen he said these thoughts falling into their consolation back yonder the angel coming and saying as john was sent to wind up the old testament and to pray okay notice the mighty angel swore with an oath time would be no more now i don't want to keep you too long just think of this for a minute i think i just read that yeah so we're we're right at the end of this so yeah i just read that that that was the last quote i'm sorry but just just so that it could give you something to feed on and something that god could work on and and i'm opening up to you that if god will reveal or show something more to you about what i'm trying to bring over i'm open to it i'm open to it because i really believe that the time that we've many of us have been dollar tory with that time is up i believe we're right at the brink of a translation and i'm going to tell you something god has a bride amen and don't say well god left me out no no no god predestinates us according to our choice you choose that's what it's all it's been all about and let me tell you something you can't have a longing and a thirst for christ or jesus christ and unless god put it there and what we must need to do we need to say lord i surrender i surrender all i surrender all you're dealing with me i've been stubborn i've been slaughterful for my own personal reasons all of us and my thing is god wherever i've fallen short forgive me quicken me make me right amen i see this word i know that this word comes to change me give me the grace to yield to your word let's stand in the morning when i rise in the morning when i rise in
