You know, brother Keith was someone who witnessed quite a lot around in the city. And one brother who came I was talking to um one brother texted me. He says, "I came to visit the church once and he said he's the first person who came to greet me and he welcomed me and he showed me a place to see." So just that one encounter he could not for forget him and you can imagine each and every one of us just fellowshipping with him just his genuiness we we all miss him and more so his family. Amen.

And we thank God for his amazing grace. We started on a message on Sunday going beyond this dimension and we were trying to tell the people that we need to go higher in God. The first place in the first place we must learn to know who we are. I believe once we come to know who we are we will become an invincible army. Those are the words of our prophet. Amen. And I believe within our hearts, in order for us to go any further, we must first recognize our freedom. If you don't feel free, you're in bondage and you can't do what God wants you to do. But when you know that you know, amen, that you're free, then nothing can hold you back. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's read by the grace of God as we stand. First Corinthians 8 and six. But to us there is but one God, the Father of whom are all things. Amen. We in him and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things and we by him. Hebrews 2, we'll read 8 and 10. The important point or place in the scripture I want to emphasize tonight is that we are in him. Hallelujah. Amen. We are in him. Yes. Hebrews 2 8 through10. Thou has put all things in subjection under his feet. Hallelujah. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. Amen. But now we see not yet all things put under him. But we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor that he may that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. Let us pray. Father God, we thank you for your grace and your mercy. We thank you for being so good to us. You are the only living God and we thank you, Father God, for giving us the grace and the mercy to know you. It is so wonderful knowing you because I know you know us. You know our down sitting. You know our getting up. You know when we go in and we go out. You know the beginning of our days and you know the ending of our days. For you are God. And we worship you tonight. We thank you for your word. Hallelujah. We thank you for being so good to us. Lord, we stand here tonight expectation to hear from you in your lovely name Jesus Christ. Speak to our hearts in Jesus Christ's name. Change us from glory to glory, Lord. Hallelujah. and we'll be careful to give you the praise, glory, and honor. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. So, I decided by the grace of God to be here on Sunday because of um our brother Keith passing on to be with the Lord. I have a powerful testimony I'd like to share, but I will share that on Sunday. I saw him a little while before he went on to be with the Lord. Hallelujah. You love the Lord. The Bible says in that 10th verse, for it became him, of whom are all things, and by whom are all things. Amen. and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect suffering. So I want to bring this in a way that you understand though you be free it doesn't make you free from suffering because the Bible said that Jesus learned his obedience through the things in which he suffered and we can enjoy the joy of the Lord, the joy of the peace of God and the blessings of God. But we must realize in order to come to perfection you must bear your greatest enemy as the prophet of God says is you. It's not the devil, it's you. We now understand that better. Now we must understand if our lives are hid in Christ in Christ. Brother explained that he said being under the blood, God don't see us but he hears that voice. I love that because if we can understand we are truly free. We let our flesh dictate to us. We let our flesh condemn us. The Bible says there is no condemnation to walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. So if you are walking after the spirit of God, you should not allow the devil to live in you because you're full of his holy spirit. Christ lives in you who is the hope of glory. Hallelujah. Glory to God. You love the Lord. We must understand having a good conscience means that we really believe the word. You understand me? Having a good conscience is also being able to hear the word because everybody can hear the word. Just a simple in just a simple message. Everybody can't see Acts 2:38 though it is right there in the book. But those who have a good conscience, those God has given a good conscience. They are able to see the word. They act upon the word. Really simple. I told a brother one time, "If you really want the Holy Ghost, the real Holy Ghost, follow Acts 2:38. Repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins. You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." Hallelujah. But you got to repent. You can't get it without repenting. Hallelujah. And that means you you're determined to turn around for God to change your life that you presently live to a life of godliness. Now coming from the message, God provided place of worship 1965 0425. Hallelujah. Paragraph 155. No. Okay. Now remember in Christ we are flesh of flesh, bone of his bone. When God wounded Christ at Calvary, he was wounded for me and you. We are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone, body of his body, name of his name, bride of him. See, we are in him. We are flesh and we are his flesh and his bones. Do you understand that? That means if God going to see, he's seeing through your eyes. He's walking in your shoes. Hallelujah. That's right. When you are unified with God, you become the very living temple of the Holy God. Now, I'm not trying to mess with your mind. This is this must become a reality. When this becomes a reality, it is when you know then no weapon formed against you shall prosper. Hallelujah. It doesn't matter what Satan brings to you. You know that God has full control, not the God that's in heaven, the God that's in you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And God has already raised us up potentially. The quickening power that raised us from a life of sin. It changed our being. It has the potential. It has potentially raised us up in Christ Jesus which the resurrection will bring us in the full [Applause] maturity. You can't do it. God is Christ in you that's bringing you fully into maturity. Little by little. Hallelujah. We're possessing this land. He says, "Now remember, we died in our own name and raised in his will no more of our own." of which that great name of Jesus Christ which the Bible said over here in Ephesians 1:21 that both families in heaven and in earth is named after that name that whether that's where God puts his name that's the family name in heaven that's the family name on earth. Do we you see you got to go beyond even what I'm saying that that the word is a spirit. The word is life. And you can't listen to this with your head. You must listen with your heart. Is that right? For the Bible said, "As he thinkketh in his heart, so is he." If you if you in this third dimension and that's all you know, you you're not going to get anywhere. Some people don't know that God is there or here unless they feel him. I don't have to feel God. Some people think if I don't see him, I don't have to see him. I don't have to taste him. I don't have to smell him. I know he's here because his Bible says so. And the Bible also tell me he's so much here. He's living in me. He's living in you. We must focus if we're going to see a rapture. The bride will have no spot, wrinkle or blemish. That means she believed the word for her day. She really believed the word for her day. She focuses on the word for her day. Hallelujah. Your focus creates your reality. You understand me? Whatever you think you are, that's who you are. Oh, come on. If you think you are a failure, that's what you are. Hallelujah. If you think you are a hypocrite, that's what you are. But if you believe and know that you are son of God, hallelujah, and understand the scriptures, as I said last week, as far as the east is from the west, Psalm 103:12, Hallelujah. As far as the east is from the west, so have he removed our transgressions from us. Oh, it's the truth. Why are you burdened? Because as long as you are in this flesh, you're going to make mistakes. But God got you covered. Hallelujah. The blood of Jesus Christ has washed me, has cleansed me. It justifies me. It sanctifies me. It fills me with his Holy Spirit. See, I've got to say this. that Jesus Christ must become your all in all in order for you to make these transitions. We do not have a different Holy Ghost than they had on the day of Pentecost. We do not have a different Holy Ghost that God gave William Brandon. Hallelujah. That same spirit, that's what the Bible said. If that same spirit dwells in you, hallelujah. Hallelujah. It will quicken your mortal body. Hallelujah. You've got to walk in freedom. Oh, come on, somebody. Forget about your flesh. And think about the inner man. Hallelujah. You got to think about the inner man. What is the inner man doing? What is the inner man saying? What does the inner man what does he want from you? What is it? Hallelujah. What he wants is for you to walk with him. That's what it's all about. Calvary came to restore relationship. Calvary came to restore fellowship. Hallelujah. Calvary came to produce his own that they may do exactly the things he did when he walked on the earth. This is the last age. There's not coming another. And God has chosen you because he believe and know. You see, God has faith in his own word and you are his word. Hallelujah. And he knows that you're going to make it even when you don't know. Hallelujah. Is that all right? Isaiah 65 and 24. How many times? How many times we fail to pray? Amen. Amen. And God still answer prayer. You didn't even pray about it. You thought about it. Y'all been hear what I'm saying? Amen. And God still gave it to you. Hallelujah. We love to pray, but prayer don't save you. This is all about election. Y'all better hear what I'm saying. As I say, we're favored. We're favored. I don't care what I go through. I'm favored. That's right. Peter cursed God three times. Hallelujah. Is that right? He cursed three times. I don't know the man. I don't know the man. Hallelujah. And then Judas. One time. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Think about even the things. And I I'm not telling anybody to go out and sin because if there if you sin, there is a reward. Hallelujah. You going to be spanked. God is going to deal with you son and daughter. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But you got to realize that God still have more mercy on you than he does to sinner. The Bible says, "If it had not been for the mercies of God, it would not be Hallelujah." Isaiah 25:24, "And it shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer. And while they are yet speaking, I will hear." Hallelujah. Y'all believe that? I believe it with all my heart. How many times God has answered my prayer while I was speaking? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But you got to free yourself from condemnation. That is the biggest thing that we hold. Satan holds on us. We make a mistake and then he brings a condemnation. But you got to believe. The scripture says there is no condemnation. Y'all better understand what I'm saying. When you allow yourself to be condemned, that means you're allowing yourself to feel lost. How can you feel lost when God has saved you? Hallelujah. God didn't save you to lose you. Hallelujah. Like I said, the word will correct you. But it's not here to condemn you. Hallelujah. It is God who justifies. Who shall lay any charge to God's elect? Y'all better understand it. God said, "I justify and those whom I justify, I glorify." Who's going to lay any charge to God? Hallelujah. Nobody can do it. Even the devil tried to to do that in front of God with his long list. Hallelujah. Long list and with all that he present before God. In God's list, there is nothing. Hallelujah. Why? Because everything has been washed away. Satan has no evidence to condemn you with you under the blood. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And as that song say, under the blood. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, we we we we pity ourselves. Why? You're the true queen of heaven. You understand me? Generation. This generation is going to take her rapture. I don't know about you, but I'm making that. Hallelujah. And now that Keith has gone on home. I'm looking forward to seeing him again. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. St. John 14 1-6. Amen. You love the Lord. No condemnation. People come to condemn you, you tell him a liar. You are a liar. But the Bible said, "No weapon shall be formed against you shall prosper and nobody in the judgment will be able to judge me." Hallelujah. You know why? I was judged with him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When Jesus was judged, our judgment upon him with his stripes we are healed. I'm not a sick Christian. Somebody help me. I'm not a sick Christian, but I'm a healthy Christian. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Not just in my flesh, but in my soul. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How you'd say that, brother? Because God conquered it all. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Every sickness, every piece of death, everything Satan could put on him. And guess where? Guess what? When he was conquering the devil, I was in him in him. Listen, if we could see what I'm seeing, it's on another plane. So, what do you mean, brother? Just like Jesus said, as a man thinks, he said, "If a man look upon a woman, he took that same thing that was the law and took it up higher." You understand me? And what Jesus did, he said those things, he put everybody on the same plane in the same pot. You better hear what I'm saying. But God has a remedy. [Laughter] He is the one that's going to take He is taking us higher. The world can't see Jesus. But it's necessary for you to see Jesus. You are the mystery of God. Christ in you. Amen. Hallelujah. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. And we always say that at funerals, don't let your heart be troubled. Y'all understand what he's saying? In other words, don't let it be troubled. Let me say that again. Don't let it be trouble. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We we we don't we don't get depressed when somebody die. We don't grieve like we're sinners grieve. Oh, we cry. We're broken. It hurts, but we move on up because we have a greater hope. Hallelujah. We can serve. We can see it. Hallelujah. Amen. Now I I can say it like this. If Abraham was be was able to see a city was building and make of God. You mean to tell me you can't see your loved ones over there? Abraham saw a city builder and maker was God. He was a different dimension people. Hallelujah. He had a different vibration. Y'all better hear what I'm saying. He was on a different frequency. And real Christians, they walk on that in that frequency. That's why God calls us peculiar. That's why God said you are strangers. That means you are strange to the world. Amen. I don't mind being strange. In my father's house are many mansions. If so, I would have told you prepare a place for you. You know, brother Brandham said, "Those mansions are palaces. In my kingdom, my kingdom." Hallelujah. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive your command. And where I am, there you may be also on earth. Don't believe there's another dimension. Jesus just said it. I'm going to prepare a place for you that where I am, there you might be also. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He told Nicodemus, "You can't even see what I'm talking about unless you be born again. You got to come up higher. Let the Holy Spirit take you higher. Shake up the bands of worry and fear. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God." You know, when you worry, you get sick. And where I go, you know. And the way you know, Thomas said unto him, "Brother, brother, you got to understand Jesus was talking from another dimension because he's telling Thomas, you know, you know, but Thomas had a he had a theophony." You know what I'm saying? He said, "You may not know now, but you know." Hallelujah. right? Whether thou goest, and how can we know the way? Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man cometh unto the father but by me." Amen. He wasn't dealing with flesh and blood. Hallelujah. When we go up, we do not go up in flesh and blood. We go up as a theophony. Y what I'm saying? Flesh and blood cannot enter into that kingdom. We go up. We shed this old body. Hallelujah. Stepped in some something called theophony right places us in heaven where we should be at the moment. At the moment. Glory. That's why Paul says, "You going to know me and I'll be known as I've known Paul's basically saying it's going to be the same me but a better me." Hallelujah. Don't you want a better me? No more pain, no more sorrow, no more sickness. Hallelujah. There'll never be another cloudy day. I don't know about you, but I know it exists. Hallelujah. Glory. People say, you know, serving Jesus Christ is a fairy tale, but this is the best fairy tale I know. And you talk about we shall live forever. Hallelujah. Is that all right? Just so you understand, by the grace of God, the Bible says, "For by grace are you saved and that not of yourself, it is a gift from God." If you don't have the grace or you don't have the faith that he that he gives out, you need to ask him for am I out of my mind. No, I am not. I'm gonna read a prayer by brother Brandon. Amen. Coming from looking at the unseen. That is year 590410. Paragraph two. Paragraph. He said, "Almighty God, the creator of heaven, the creator of heaven and earth and the author of everlasting life and the giver of every good and perfect gift. to thee, oh Lord, who raised up Jesus thy son on the third day for our consolation that we might be reconciled to thee being justified by faith, believe in the story. We pray that you would raise us tonight, your children to a higher heights, deeper depths, eternal presence. May we recognize thee, Lord. May new faith come tonight. Something that will just set our soul. Hallelujah. They're burning with old fashion Pentecostal fire. Remember those Lord tonight who are weak and feeble knees, feeble hands. We pray that they will be strengthened tonight by thy presence of thy spirit. Bring those wondering ones back to the fold and all of those Lord who has never yet accepted thee as their personal savior this the night that they'll settle it once for all [Music] and then Lord remember those who are sick and afflicted may we have a resurrection tonight new hopes new faith grant it Lord speak to us through thy word, further weight in the name of Jesus Christ, thy son, we ask it. Amen. Amen. A higher height, a deeper depth of his presence. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He didn't say just word. His presence. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. 2 Corinthians Corinthians 4:16. Are you there? For this cause we faint not. But though our outward man perish, our inward man is renewed day by day. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If it if if Paul can say that his outward man, he's getting older. He's perishing. Hallelujah. But he said, "Listen, something's happening that the flesh has no control of it." In other words, I'm being renewed every day, day by day, one step at a time. Hallelujah. Listen. And he said, "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, workketh for a far excellent uh more a far more exceeding eternal weight of glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, And as I said the other day, what you see is not real. It is the unseen things that are real. Hallelujah. Whether or not you see it or not, but the angels of the Lord are encounter with every whenever two or three are gathered together in his name on one occur. The host of heaven is right here. Amen. To make it come to pass. Whatever, whatsoever you ask in my name believing it, it shall be given unto thee. That's the Bible. We got to believe that. Help us Jesus. Israel, one thing, Israel believed in one God. You know sometimes even even the believer don't know that they sometimes think Jesus is too or God is father and then you got Jesus. You understand me? They don't understand that Jesus Christ is the housing of God. Hallelujah. And he calls us brothers and sisters. So therefore we must be the housing of God. Is that what he said? Paul said know you not that you are the temple of God. He didn't say gods. He said God. But there's only one God. He made the heavens. He made the earth. He made the universe. He's made everything that you can see. Even those things that you cannot see. He's the maker. Hallelujah. As I said, as you believe God in your heart, that's his strength. If your faith is weak in your heart, then God is weak to you. That's it. But if you got the faith that God has given you, which is the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ, Jesus believe his own word. Hallelujah. God will correct you. Brother, didn't you not ask for three squirrels? You asked for three squirrels. Why do you settle for less? If you ask God for something, don't back up from the devil. believe God. Possess your land. Well, it must not have been God's will. That's the devil. Hallelujah. That's really the truth. You just don't know how to wait on God and believe. You don't God can't lie. And if you have the faith of a mustard seed, you can say to a mountain be thy move. That's the word. Hallelujah. Deuteronomy 64-5. Yes, sir. If we're going to go higher, we got to think the word. Let the mind that that would be in Christ, let it be in us. My thoughts doesn't matter. My feelings doesn't matter. What somebody else has told me doesn't matter. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Elijah believed God so much. He spoke it. He said, "It will not rain until I call for it." Hey, somebody. And it didn't rain for three and a half years. H y'all hear what I'm saying? And if we got the spirit of Elijah, which is Elisha, we've got to double portion. You got to talk to this thing with authority. Not like a little baby learning how to be a king. Hallelujah. You are kings and priests. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Deuteronomy 6:14 here. O Israel. The Lord our God is one Lord. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. That's what makes it work. Hallelujah. You love the Lord. In your heart, not your head. Hallelujah. Hebrews 8, please. We'll read 8 chapter 8th chapter 10th and through the 13th verse. See, see, see what people don't understand why it's so important. Get the Holy Ghost. I don't care how you scream and holler at the altar. God waiting for you to surrender. Yeah, you surrender. You understand me? We can do all that. That's good. But at the end of the day, he ain't going to move until you surrender. And let me tell you something. If you know what I'm talking about, While you're praying, God is telling you everything you need to surrender, everything you need to confess. Am I am I making up something? He talks to you. And if you follow his instruction, you'll come to the victory. But he knows when you want to halfway give him something until you give it all. Y'all know y'all know what I'm saying? 8:10 through13. That's why so many people don't have it because they're not willing or they're not willing to give up this world. They got too many riches. That's what's wrong with us. We've got too like the rich young ruler. I can't give all of this up and follow you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I might end up like you. Where's your house? You know what I'm saying? Your clothes are tattered. What? What? What? You want me to give up all of this? Listen, I'm going to tell you something. Where the devil trick people, they still think they going to take all them riches with them? You can't even take the clothes that they wrapped you in when you're dead. You rot and die in there. And that's how you ride up. Your clothes going to ride up. And I heard that, brother. Your casket going to ride up. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. That's why God gave us clothes. Paul said, I want to be clothed. And what do I want to be clothed with? His virtue. His character. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And if I got his character, he's going to give me a white robe. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I will not appear before him naked. Hallelujah. As that song say, step by step will make this journey. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. For this is the covenant. 10th verse. For this is the covenant that I will make with with the house of Israel. In those days, said the Lord, I will put my laws into mine. and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be a people. Be to me a people, and they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, "Know the Lord. For all shall know me from the least to the greatest." What is he saying? All is going to have the Holy Spirit. Oh, and I will be merciful to their unrighteousness. In their sins, in their iniquities will I remember no more. And how many of us know what iniquity is? When you know what to do, you do it willfully. It ain't the devil made me do it. And God still have mercy on you. Because because before your iniquity, he suffered for your iniquity. What a mighty God. No condemnation. You got to realize, you got to stop allowing the devil. Hallelujah. For I will have mercy to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. In that he said a new covenant heath made the first old. Now that which decayth and waxes old is ready to vanish away. What is the new covenant? Brother said it's unconditional. It's not what you do. is what I've done for you. Why do we allow ourselves to get in a place of depression when we didn't choose ourselves? Hallelujah. Let me run on. Let me read Ephesians quickly, first chapter. I'm almost done. The third to the 8th verse. The Bible said, "Blessed be the God, father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who have blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places." Christ accordingly has he chosen us in him? in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will of the glory of his grace wherein he have made us oh I love this right I love this made us accepted in the beloved. I didn't earn it, but I was accepted. You didn't earn it, but you was accepted. Y'all forgive me. I'm licking my lips like crazy cuz I'm so thirsty. Forgive me. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace. Wherein he have abounded toward us all wisdom and prudence. I'm going to quit. It's this. Calling Jesus on the scene is what we need to do. Sometimes we're not where we should be. But he is helpful. You know, we talk about Jehovah Gyra. We he can furnish me with a house. He can furnish me with a car. He can furnish me with with a job. But he can furnish you with faith. Amen. That's what we need. We need faith. Perfect faith, the kind that will not waver. Brother Brandham said that Jesus had undisturbed faith. No matter how bad the news was, he never was shaken. He didn't go out of control. Don't get me wrong. He was in full control at Lazarus's grave. He wept. Y'all hear what I'm saying? So, ain't nothing wrong with crying, but he knew who he was and he knew what he was coming to do. Hallelujah. Let's go to Mark the 9th chapter 19-24. Hallelujah. You love the Lord here. Jesus is dealing with some devils that needed to be cast out and his disciples were not able to do it. Starting at the 19th verse, he answered him and said, "Oh ye, oh faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him unto me." And they brought him unto him. And when he saw him straight away, the spirit teared him and he fell on the ground while forming. If we had seen that, we would jump back and we would call him Jesus. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Y'all hear what I'm saying? But all that calling would be under under the spirit of unbelief. In the light of God before Jesus could even speak, the devil shows off. And it was all what he was trying to do is produce fear. Y'all better hear me. Cuz fear is torment. The first time I saw demons cast out of a person, I had just come to the message and I was scared. Amen. That girl crawled on the floor like a serpent, eyes red as fire making sounds like birds. And she switched over to pigs. And I'm standing there shaking. and they say, "Close your eyes." She was headed my way. I didn't know the message like I know it now. But I kept my eye. I'm being honest. I kept my eyes on her. There was another brother who kept his eyes on her, too. So when brothers prayed for that woman, something came out of her. And it went by me. And that brother said, "Oh, Jesus. I'm just telling you, it ain't nothing to play with, but it's real." Amen. It didn't scare Brother Simmons. So the next time we had a situation like that, I wasn't there. Brother Simmons said, "All who don't believe and the whole church emptied out. At least they were honest. But listen, let's move on. See what I want you to understand. These they face the same thing we face. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And he and they bought him unto him. 20th verse. And when he saw him, straightway the spirit tear him fell on the ground and wallowed for me. And he asked his father, "How long is how long is it ago?" Sisters came upon him and he said of a child. So you understand what Jesus did? He literally ignored the performance of the demon and he addresses the father. How long is the father says often time it have cast him into the fire to destroy him. But if thou can do anything comp compassion on us and help him. And Jesus said, "If thou can't believe, all things are possible to him that believeth." You got to continue to believe. Even if the devil doesn't move right then, you got to believe that what has been said is done. And straightway the father of the tribe child cried out and said with tears, Lord, I believe. Help thou my unbelief. As simple as it gets. If your faith is not to the level, my unbelief. At least the man knew something wasn't quite right. Ask God for more faith. Lord, help me. I believe, right? But help thou my unbelief. Hallelujah. You understand me? So, we must understand that sometime we are confronted with situations. faith, but it's not enough. It's not solid. Y'all understand what I'm trying to say? So, you have to ask God, help my How do you know you don't have it? See what happened. boy wasn't that demon kept quiet until Jesus presence and then he really acted up and that's what the devil does with our children that's what we pray for they get worse and then we think oh my god we feel v we feel we feel um um defeated don't back up Stand your ground. You can act up all you want to. But the word of God has come to you. You got to go. Stand there. I don't care how bad it get. Stand there. You are little amateur God. You're Messiah. The word of creation is in your mouth. However you think in your heart, that's what you'll be. If you can see yourself free, the devil says you ain't no you you you're a hypocrite. You listen you got to put the word with his stripes I'm healed. God has settled my debt. You have nothing over me. God justified me as though I was never sin in the first place. You cannot hold me. You are not charged me. Hallelujah. No accusation, nothing. Amen. God has set me free and he's given me the authority. That's what he said. After which the Holy Ghost has come upon you receive power. God said that power is the authority of the almighty God. We got to do it people. We got to keep it. We got to keep pressing forward. I'm going to stop here by the grace of God. Perhaps Sunday I'll continue. It would be the will of the Lord because there's so much I'm trying to get us to see. Faith without works is dead. We're the bride of Christ. I believe that with all my heart. Brother said, "One man can't make bring a revival. It takes the people. And if you want to see God come in this place like he wants, Hallelujah. Right. You got to start saying Lord, not my will but thine be done. Whatever your word say is what I want to be. My heart, oh God. Make me more like thee. That's it. Let us stand. Hallelujah.
