[49:47] morning
[49:48] it's it's just good to be up here
[49:51] you see
[49:53] in iowa are you on it's been a long time
[49:57] since we've had the privilege of being
[49:59] up here
[50:08] i'm normally good with faces but you
[50:21] because they frequent florida questions
[50:24] even in florida before
[50:26] when there's a meeting
[50:29] we look forward to having them
[50:33] their musical talents
[50:36] hey man they they sing and play
[50:45] [Music]
[50:52] we appreciate them
[50:55] uh it's it's good to see young men
[50:59] do everything that they can to serve the
[51:01] lord
[51:04] that's a real tremendous blessing in
[51:06] itself
[51:09] they drive a lot of miles it conduces
[51:11] the long distance i can't drive like
[51:14] that anymore
[51:16] so we had
[51:17] we had
[51:18] the fly
[51:19] no no
[51:36] because i realize it's it's a difficult
[51:38] job
[51:41] we passed it for 23 years
[51:46] now we're just an associate with my
[51:48] brother-in-law brother
[51:56] [Music]
[52:02] it's
[52:04] [Music]
[52:10] [Music]
[52:31] so you have to keep them in prayer
[52:34] genesis chapter 1 verse 1
[52:38] uh we want to start the first verse
[52:41] and it reads in the beginning god
[52:43] created the heavens and the earth
[52:47] and the earth was without form and void
[52:52] and darkness was upon the face of the
[52:54] deep yeah
[52:56] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[52:58] face of
[53:27] and see you on suarez
[53:30] let's just buy his for a word of
[53:31] presence
[53:36] we come this morning humbly as we know
[53:41] just to get ourselves out of the way
[53:44] we're just an instrument this morning
[53:47] uh we're not here to be uh seen in
[53:50] somebody
[53:51] we're just here to express jesus christ
[54:08] so just annoying us oh god you know when
[54:10] new bear anoint the heroes of the word
[54:13] of god this morning
[54:15] uh we just trust that when we leave this
[54:18] place
[54:20] we can leave here blessed this morning
[54:44] we just thank god for the revealed word
[54:46] of the hour
[54:49] is that right
[54:51] you thank god for the message of the
[54:52] hour
[54:54] we thank god for god sending us a
[54:57] prophet in this hour
[55:01] because uh without a prophet in this
[55:04] hour
[55:07] we wouldn't have the right
[55:09] interpretations to the scriptures
[55:14] because one of the things we realize is
[55:31] there were so many things that were tied
[55:34] up and hid
[55:37] is that right
[55:39] so we we appreciate uh a prophet
[55:43] one of the things that um brother
[55:46] branham taught
[55:56] uh we can go further than genesis 1 and
[55:59] 1.
[56:01] uh
[56:02] we can go back to what was in god's mind
[56:05] before the foundations of the world
[56:10] and i appreciate that
[56:14] being able to understand what was the
[56:16] motive of god
[56:20] what would what was god doing when
[56:24] he started creating yes
[56:28] uh there's a purpose in the things that
[56:30] god does yeah an objective
[56:34] god doesn't do things foolishly during
[56:37] the faith
[56:38] uh we have a tendency of doing things
[56:41] without purpose
[56:50] we a lot of times humanly we don't give
[56:52] things thought
[56:54] upon some people
[56:56] but god thinks about the things or he
[56:58] thought about the things that he was
[57:00] doing
[57:04] one of the things that we find in
[57:06] studying the word of god
[57:21] uh and one of those attributes was to be
[57:23] a fob elon
[57:37] he helps us a lot when we look in the
[57:39] book of genesis
[57:43] because we see fatherhood in the book of
[57:45] genesis
[57:49] it may not look like it
[57:52] but what we find is fatherhood in the
[57:55] book of genesis
[57:59] because he had a family in his mind
[58:03] [Music]
[58:05] he put a lot of thought in in creation
[58:11] god wanted to create a perfect
[58:13] environment
[58:17] for his children post his own phone
[58:19] knowing that he would have a family
[58:22] for me see that that should help us as
[58:25] fathers this morning
[58:29] amen amen
[58:31] we want to make sure
[58:48] in order for our children to be
[58:51] uh prosperous
[58:56] come to full manifestation
[58:58] of their uh natural and spiritual
[59:02] potential
[59:08] they need to have the right kind of
[59:10] environment zombies
[59:13] is that right
[59:15] come on church
[59:17] how many believe that
[59:19] said right
[59:20] we must create the right kind of
[59:22] environment
[59:25] the right kind of situations situation
[59:28] correct for our family
[59:31] is that right
[59:33] you know uh i wish a lot of these
[59:35] principles
[59:38] i could have understood
[59:41] as a young man
[59:44] and this is why we try to relate things
[59:49] to this younger generation
[59:52] it's important for for
[59:55] for men it's important
[59:58] for
[1:00:06] it's important for you to create the
[1:00:08] right kind of environment
[1:00:12] in order for your seat to come to a much
[1:00:15] a place of development and maturity
[1:00:21] maturity
[1:00:24] the scripture lets us know
[1:00:38] it was out it was void
[1:00:54] of darkness
[1:01:00] uh uh
[1:01:03] and he saw
[1:01:04] he love you
[1:01:06] that it was necessary because it didn't
[1:01:08] necessarily
[1:01:17] is something
[1:01:19] uh necessary
[1:01:21] security
[1:01:22] or
[1:01:36] when you're young
[1:01:39] and you're immature it was that mature
[1:01:42] uh
[1:01:43] you don't see things as necessary
[1:01:46] necessity sometimes young people don't
[1:01:49] see why it's necessary the fallacions
[1:02:33] so i believe this morning
[1:02:36] that is it's it's necessary because it
[1:02:38] necessary to to just to walk in the
[1:02:41] light of the word of god
[1:02:45] because one of the things we've learned
[1:02:47] from studying the message
[1:02:51] is that
[1:02:51] god can only be identified
[1:02:56] by certain characteristics
[1:02:59] no characteristic
[1:03:00] there are certain things that god will
[1:03:02] not be identified with yeah yeah these
[1:03:04] shows okay
[1:03:06] is that right
[1:03:08] amen and as as ministry there's certain
[1:03:10] things that we won't be identified with
[1:03:29] with family in his mind
[1:03:34] realizing that he wanted to create
[1:03:37] realization
[1:03:39] a positive environment
[1:03:43] a place where they they could have a
[1:03:45] oneness
[1:03:48] a place that that you know uh that would
[1:03:51] be a harmony
[1:03:54] a place that there will be joy uh
[1:04:02] amen
[1:04:04] don't you just love harmony in the house
[1:04:08] don't you just love peace in the house
[1:04:22] because of its characteristics
[1:04:27] wouldn't be the right kind of
[1:04:29] environment
[1:04:32] corrector for his children to raise up
[1:04:34] it focuses on foreign is that right
[1:04:52] light was necessary
[1:04:55] necessary light is necessary
[1:05:00] is that right
[1:05:02] if if
[1:05:03] we're to ever see manifestation pokemon
[1:05:21] realizing uh in a message called um
[1:05:25] it's the rising of the sun
[1:05:29] so that we could see the characteristics
[1:05:32] of the characters of darkness
[1:05:36] uh and see why it was necessary
[1:05:40] for god to bring light who could drop
[1:05:43] amen brother branham he talks a little
[1:05:45] bit about
[1:05:47] bowler and he uses this term gloom
[1:05:51] um
[1:05:53] g-l-o-o-m
[1:05:56] g-l-o-o-m
[1:05:57] and what it represents
[1:06:01] it's it's it's darkness
[1:06:05] uh
[1:06:06] despondency
[1:06:08] the
[1:06:09] despondency the dependence depression
[1:06:13] depression dejection la
[1:06:16] rejection
[1:06:33] is that right
[1:06:34] so so you could see why
[1:06:38] god god looking at this darkness
[1:06:44] because there's always this law of
[1:06:46] contrast
[1:06:49] to everything no on to chosen and then
[1:06:52] in the beginning
[1:06:55] god wanted to bring forth a separation
[1:06:58] opportunity
[1:07:01] hey man god wanted his children juventus
[1:07:04] is on phone to be in light
[1:07:07] uh
[1:07:09] and we are the one our children in new
[1:07:11] zealand
[1:07:40] who wants to be depressed
[1:07:43] right
[1:07:44] no one wants to be depressed
[1:07:48] no one wants to be down come on
[1:07:52] is that right
[1:07:54] who who wants to live
[1:07:57] give a viva in those conditions
[1:08:00] under those conditions
[1:08:03] is that right
[1:08:05] being dejected
[1:08:08] is that right
[1:08:10] so we we we have to thank god for life
[1:08:15] we have to thank god for a condition
[1:08:20] god brought something into existence
[1:08:25] of existence that he can identify
[1:08:27] himself
[1:08:30] with avec
[1:08:32] [Applause]
[1:08:35] a coma
[1:08:36] right glory to god god you god because
[1:08:40] he can only be identified
[1:08:44] by his characteristics
[1:08:47] and according to scripture it's only
[1:08:50] true
[1:09:02] and the characteristics
[1:09:15] you know i have six children i know she
[1:09:17] sees on phone and i thank god
[1:09:21] that i was birthed under the evening
[1:09:24] time message
[1:09:28] which is light in this age
[1:09:32] brother branham preached a message
[1:09:35] uh
[1:09:36] call shalom
[1:09:37] shalom y'all heard the message
[1:09:40] right
[1:09:41] and he used the scripture is this like
[1:09:44] real uh from the book of isaiah we don't
[1:09:47] believe right
[1:09:49] and and what was brother branham trying
[1:09:51] to relate to us
[1:09:54] right
[1:09:55] because the the patterns of god don't
[1:09:58] change
[1:09:59] what do you think
[1:10:01] if god brought light in the book of
[1:10:03] genesis
[1:10:07] and and light is a is a positive term
[1:10:13] right
[1:10:26] it represents the oneness of the family
[1:10:31] is that right
[1:10:32] it it represents
[1:10:35] fulfillment of potential accomplishments
[1:10:39] right
[1:10:40] because brother branham makes this
[1:10:41] statement
[1:11:09] those seeds needed the power
[1:11:36] and he realized that could never come to
[1:11:52] because what darkness represents
[1:11:56] those seats this samosa needed the power
[1:12:00] of light
[1:12:03] oh glory to god
[1:12:04] see that was a predestinated scene
[1:12:44] because hey man i was walking in dark
[1:12:46] that's because your mouth is only the
[1:12:47] neighbor hey man as a drug addict
[1:12:53] a gang member a mumble dude the ganga
[1:12:56] but that was a sea lion
[1:13:00] and all that i had to do
[1:13:12] the principles of god that's not
[1:13:16] changed see we
[1:13:19] one thing i i've learned and studied in
[1:13:20] the world
[1:13:23] is that that redemption
[1:13:26] keeps a pattern
[1:13:29] that right
[1:13:44] and he looked at what darkness
[1:13:46] represented yeah we got the observation
[1:13:48] representative and he realized
[1:13:52] in order to bring forth these seeds
[1:13:56] i got to bring i got to bring something
[1:13:58] else
[1:14:21] if we understand the principles of
[1:14:23] scripture
[1:14:26] right
[1:14:54] to bring light do it
[1:14:57] temporary and wait like the ponte la
[1:14:59] lumiere comes home
[1:15:07] and y'all ought to be more happy to do
[1:15:09] that
[1:15:12] if you understand what light represents
[1:15:15] simple components
[1:15:17] if you really understand what your
[1:15:19] message is
[1:15:34] this preacher is trying to show you
[1:15:36] something
[1:15:47] we're living we're living it you know in
[1:15:50] a day
[1:15:55] [Applause]
[1:16:02] we thank god for light being in the
[1:16:05] church
[1:16:07] is that right amen we thank god for the
[1:16:10] light of the world being in the church
[1:16:15] because gross darkness is upon the
[1:16:17] people pascality never
[1:16:22] amen
[1:16:23] gross darkness is upon this world
[1:16:29] it's it's only getting worse and worse
[1:16:31] and worse
[1:16:47] and it's only getting worse
[1:16:51] it's getting worse for our children
[1:16:54] it's getting worse for our families
[1:16:58] but thank god for life
[1:17:26] is
[1:17:39] it shows me uh how to be a husband
[1:18:24] it opens up our understanding
[1:18:29] see this is what paul
[1:18:31] paul taught in ephesians says crippled
[1:18:33] uh i want you don't listen
[1:18:35] the eyes of our understanding
[1:18:38] do
[1:18:53] thank god god saw that it was necessary
[1:18:57] is that right
[1:18:59] thank god
[1:19:01] he saw her necessarily
[1:19:05] what
[1:19:06] is
[1:19:16] and how and what god starts out with
[1:19:19] it's good
[1:19:31] right
[1:19:32] because jesus is the light that's jesus
[1:19:48] glory
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:20:02] amen so you can see why
[1:20:06] god thought it necessary
[1:20:10] necessary to bring light damn
[1:20:14] and life
[1:20:16] because
[1:20:57] i love the
[1:20:59] is it true jesus brought something into
[1:21:01] ex god brought something into existence
[1:21:04] do applications of existence that he
[1:21:06] could be identified as
[1:21:11] right
[1:21:12] because he's a positive particular
[1:21:14] positive is that right
[1:21:16] he's positive light is positive
[1:21:20] because of light i can have joy i cause
[1:21:22] that should be available right amen
[1:21:26] because you know we're all living in in
[1:21:28] a time of gross darkness
[1:21:32] and we could see
[1:21:34] now why brother branham preached alone
[1:21:39] is that right
[1:21:41] because being a prophet
[1:21:44] he could see what was coming upon this
[1:21:46] earth
[1:21:49] the unimaginable
[1:21:51] imaginable
[1:21:53] bunny priest the message shalom
[1:22:01] amen the glory of the lord is rich
[1:22:03] that's it
[1:22:05] the glory of the lord is racist like the
[1:22:08] jewish the glory of the lord is here
[1:22:10] that grant do do it to see
[1:22:13] because god don't change his principles
[1:22:16] i'm so glad about that
[1:22:19] i'm so glad for life
[1:22:24] amen amen
[1:22:26] it's just in the midst of
[1:22:28] you know this lay out of scene
[1:22:34] light elevated me
[1:22:36] la lumiere
[1:23:12] [Applause]
[1:23:22] you you find people going back to the
[1:23:24] world
[1:23:27] going back to denominationalism
[1:23:31] because yes maybe that deeds are evil
[1:23:35] observers
[1:23:37] or just maybe
[1:23:40] they they
[1:23:42] lack the understanding
[1:23:45] that god had in the beginning
[1:23:49] of what bringing light into existence
[1:23:54] would represent for us
[1:23:58] i'm grateful for life
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:41] oh
[1:24:55] is a positive attribute
[1:25:00] unfortunately
[1:25:02] some people don't see it as that certain
[1:25:04] person
[1:25:06] they see light void
[1:25:08] as constraining
[1:25:10] um
[1:25:24] we sing the song it's grace
[1:25:27] it's grace
[1:25:28] it's grace to serve the lord
[1:25:32] is that right
[1:25:34] it's not constraining
[1:25:36] it's not restricting
[1:25:48] and these are the things that we have to
[1:25:50] relate to
[1:25:51] a younger generation
[1:26:14] there's things that we can do as
[1:26:16] christians
[1:26:19] outside of church on del delisa
[1:26:24] [Applause]
[1:26:37] is that right
[1:26:39] because rap music that's good
[1:26:41] rap music
[1:26:45] i think i'm speaking french
[1:26:51] i i i asked the brothers this morning
[1:26:55] was i talking too fast
[1:26:58] once i get started
[1:27:00] it's another language
[1:27:07] [Music]

[1:27:24] amen but there's a lot of positive
[1:27:26] things
[1:27:30] that we can do as christians
[1:27:34] we we just got to understand the
[1:27:35] boundaries
[1:27:37] frontier
[1:27:39] right
[1:27:40] this this scripturally
[1:27:42] scripture
[1:27:43] there's always been been boundaries
[1:27:47] is that right
[1:27:49] there's there's a heavenly host brother

[1:44:23] his word is able to keep us
[1:44:27] able to keep me from falling
[1:44:32] i
[1:45:00] i see some of y'all look just as old as
[1:45:02] me
[1:45:04] so you all know what i'm talking about
[1:45:06] when you're 15.
[1:45:09] 16.
[1:45:10] when you're about 20 what is the event
[1:45:12] on oh you know all the answers of
[1:45:15] constitution
[1:45:18] but you know you don't even know the
[1:45:19] question
[1:45:23] it ain't till you get by
[1:45:28] 600
[1:45:43] and when when the light struck him down
[1:45:45] he lost
[1:45:47] he said no
[1:45:51] i i counted all i counted all done
[1:45:57] and that's what a whole lot of young
[1:45:58] folk need to do and a whole lot of old
[1:46:00] folk need to do because
[1:46:03] we just need to realize we don't know
[1:46:05] nothing
[1:46:07] so god can teach us something
[1:46:24] the man that's teaching us
[1:46:27] ain't this crazy
[1:46:31] the the man that baptized you the lump
[1:46:34] keeps about to see in the name of the
[1:46:36] lord jesus christ
[1:46:52] that's a shame before god sent on to the
[1:46:54] wonder
[1:46:55] but it's the truth
[1:46:57] you see it on all levels
[1:47:01] i'ma say something here
[1:47:03] and i hope it's not offensive
[1:47:06] i'll just talk
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:41] in order for your ministry to progress
[1:47:46] what what kills a young ministry
[1:47:49] lee john minister is young brothers get
[1:47:52] a little knowledge
[1:47:56] with no real experience
[1:47:59] experience
[1:48:00] because if you're 20 years old
[1:48:16] you don't even know the hardship because
[1:48:19] the difficulty of raising children
[1:48:21] deliveries on phone
[1:48:23] and and paying bills
[1:48:26] with a little bit of money

[2:05:10] [Music]
[2:05:30] we thank god for the word of god
[2:05:45] [Music]
[2:05:50] but the bright light here
[2:05:53] kept it from being as dark as i wanted
[2:05:55] it to be
[2:05:57] i wanted everybody to see what darkness
[2:06:00] really is like
[2:06:09] [Music]
[2:06:13] i appreciate that brother
[2:06:19] [Music]
[2:06:27] but not only did god quicken my soul
[2:06:31] but he's still transforming me
[2:06:34] he's still changing me
[2:06:37] and thank god for the light
[2:06:39] thank god for this message
[2:06:42] i give my
[2:06:54] amen just for a moment you may be seated
[2:07:00] i just want to
[2:07:02] uh just uh say a little something
[2:07:06] kind of connecting with our brother's
[2:07:08] ministry
[2:07:10] the word he brought
[2:07:24] you should never miss church
[2:07:27] because brother brooks is not here
[2:07:30] it takes a five-fold ministry to perfect
[2:07:32] you before the
[2:07:34] minister the president of young brothers
[2:07:36] at this point in time they're being
[2:07:38] they're learning to be evangelists
[2:07:41] or they're learning to to become a
[2:07:43] pastor
[2:07:45] they're in their early stages of
[2:07:47] ministry
[2:07:50] need your support
[2:08:17] and the most difficult part about it
[2:08:20] is learning how to move out of the way
[2:08:23] so god can have his way
[2:08:26] so i want to encourage this church
[2:08:30] it doesn't matter if i'm here or not
[2:08:33] if you truly believe god
[2:08:38] [Music]
[2:08:48] how young
[2:09:03] hallelujah
[2:09:04] is that right
[2:09:05] god calls josiah
[2:09:08] at the age of 12.
[2:09:13] it's not the man
[2:09:15] he's the god behind the man
[2:09:30] a life of sanctification giving me the
[2:09:32] certificate that gave me the strength i
[2:09:34] needed to to have stuck
[2:09:37] as a young person
[2:09:39] and young people need young people
[2:09:42] as examples
[2:09:44] hallelujah
[2:09:46] at least the young people always say
[2:09:48] amen
[2:09:50] it's the truth why i needed young people
[2:09:52] when i was younger
[2:09:54] i needed to see somebody young
[2:09:56] living the life
[2:10:00] [Music]
[2:10:05] amen you love the lord
[2:10:07] i appreciate my brother so much
[2:10:09] [Music]
[2:10:10] amen it looked like there was something
[2:10:12] else i wanted to say
[2:10:14] oh i wanted to say
[2:10:17] we're going to get some more headsets
[2:10:21] right now we we're in the process of
[2:10:23] looking at some new ones
[2:10:36] for those who don't understand english
[2:10:40] and
[2:10:42] and some who are struggling uh with
[2:10:44] french as well as healing
[2:10:49] even when you got a headset
[2:10:52] you could still say hallelujah
[2:10:56] now some of y'all came in here with
[2:10:58] gloom on you
[2:11:03] and what's amazing how the brother was
[2:11:04] preaching on light is it
[2:11:06] and i could feel the happiness and i
[2:11:08] said oh
[2:11:31] [Music]
[2:11:34] and you're making it difficult for the
[2:11:35] preacher to preach
[2:11:51] am i the only one that felt the
[2:11:52] heaviness in here
[2:11:57] and and you know it's because listen we
[2:12:00] understand
[2:12:02] one thing the lord has shown me
[2:12:18] you got to learn how to release those
[2:12:20] things
[2:12:23] is that right
[2:12:24] you got to learn how to confess it
[2:12:29] that's the only way you're going to ever
[2:12:30] be free
[2:12:32] believe that you're truly the seed of
[2:12:34] god
[2:12:36] and if you believe you truly the seed of
[2:12:39] god
[2:12:40] no weapon formed against you
[2:12:44] can prosper
[2:12:47] all of us need to be full of joy
[2:12:51] people of god don't you see the enemy
[2:12:54] the enemy is trying to keep you in the
[2:12:56] anointing of the atmosphere of gloom
[2:13:00] and darkness
[2:13:14] came
[2:13:16] [Music]
[2:13:22] sometimes i feel like uh a spectacle the
[2:13:25] fashion song come on
[2:13:27] because when i come in here
[2:13:42] you come to
[2:13:51] [Applause]
[2:13:54] is that brother billy back there
[2:13:58] to see you
[2:13:59] you'll look alike right here
[2:14:03] hey man good to see you brother but my
[2:14:05] point is this i'm on point
[2:14:07] we sunday who was here sunday
[2:14:09] last sunday
[2:14:11] such a sweet spirit
[2:14:14] of unity came in this place
[2:14:17] and all was it that we reached out to
[2:14:19] one another
[2:14:22] um
[2:14:23] by one blood
[2:14:33] and that's the spirit of jesus christ
[2:14:36] hallelujah
[2:14:38] i believe this message if we take it for
[2:14:41] what it really is
[2:14:43] will set us in heavenly places
[2:14:47] in christ jesus christ
[2:14:50] and we're coming here rejoicing
[2:15:02] and i guarantee you god will break every
[2:15:05] yolk
[2:15:08] [Music]
[2:15:21] that's the light we're living in
[2:15:24] look how brother branham lives so so
[2:15:26] before the lord regardless
[2:15:29] to god came to him and say
[2:15:32] how many squirrels you want
[2:15:42] [Music]
[2:15:56] but i believe if you enjoy jesus
[2:16:00] jesus will enjoy
[2:16:07] [Music]
[2:16:08] is that right
[2:16:10] you look at that woman that that was at
[2:16:11] jesus feet
[2:16:14] washing his feet
[2:16:16] worshiping him
[2:16:18] she had more than probably a long list
[2:16:20] of things protecting long list
[2:16:23] but god caught in the spirit
[2:16:26] what she needed the most
[2:16:29] she needed forgiveness
[2:16:31] [Music]
[2:16:37] the bible says amen god inhabits the
[2:16:40] praise of his people
[2:16:44] i'm not talking i'm not saying no more
[2:16:47] but i'm saying this brother god used him
[2:16:49] to preach light
[2:16:52] i can't imagine i can't imagine
[2:16:55] if the atmosphere had been on another
[2:16:57] level
[2:17:13] [Music]
[2:17:34] like i said i went and cut that switch
[2:17:36] off and i forgot about this big thing up
[2:17:39] here
[2:17:41] i really wanted y'all to see what
[2:17:42] darkness felt like while he was
[2:17:44] preaching
[2:17:46] if it had been dark enough i was going
[2:17:47] to leave it on for a bit let it off for
[2:17:48] a bit
[2:17:50] said him preach in the dark so you can
[2:17:51] understand
[2:17:53] what god has done in your soul
[2:17:58] god has done a wonderful thing in your
[2:17:59] soul
[2:18:01] hallelujah
