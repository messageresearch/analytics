[42:52] i i told him at 12 but
[42:55] but the service should start around 11
[42:58] 30.
[42:59] but however you know we trusted
[43:01] everybody had come out
[43:03] it's mainly geared toward the young
[43:05] people but we really would like
[43:07] all of the elders to come as well
[43:09] mothers fathers sisters brothers
[43:11] grandparents everybody
[43:13] amen uh it'll be a blessing to you i'm
[43:16] sure
[43:17] um i'm looking forward to the weekend
[43:22] forward to the word of god we're living
[43:25] in a time that uh
[43:27] the word of god is precious a lot of
[43:31] people don't believe that we're in a
[43:32] famine but we are
[43:35] even among our own we find out that
[43:38] many of the people are suffering because
[43:40] they're not
[43:42] basically in tune with the word of god
[43:44] and what god is requiring
[43:45] for us to have and to be but as we stand
[43:48] let us turn we'll get right on into the
[43:50] word of god i'll try my best being that
[43:52] it's wednesday and that is wednesday
[43:54] i try not to
[43:57] preach too long but uh
[44:00] anyway not prolonging the time let us
[44:03] turn to first corinthians the 15th
[44:05] chapter
[44:07] we'll begin reading at the 13th verse
[44:11] first corinthians 15th chapter
[44:23] but if there be beginning at the 13th
[44:25] first
[44:27] but if there be no resurrection of the
[44:29] dead
[44:31] then is christ not risen if christ be
[44:35] not risen
[44:36] then is our preaching vain
[44:39] and your faith is also vain amen
[44:42] yea we have found false witness of god
[44:45] because
[44:46] excuse me yay and we are found false
[44:50] witnesses of god
[44:52] because we have testified of god that he
[44:54] raised up christ
[44:55] whom he raised not up if so be that the
[44:59] dead rise
[45:00] not for if the dead rise not then
[45:04] is not christ raised and if christ be
[45:07] not raised your faith in vain
[45:10] ye are yet in your sins then they also
[45:13] which are fallen asleep in christ
[45:16] are perished if in this life
[45:19] only we have hope in christ
[45:23] we have all men
[45:26] most miserable i left out something
[45:30] there but nevertheless god knows
[45:32] you love the lord
[45:39] let's read on down 20th verse but now is
[45:42] christ
[45:43] risen from the dead and become the first
[45:46] fruit of them that slept
[45:48] for since by man came death
[45:52] by man came also the resurrection of the
[45:54] dead
[45:56] for as in adam all died even so in
[46:00] christ shall all be made alive
[46:04] but every man in his own order christ
[46:07] the first fruit
[46:09] after they that are christ at his coming
[46:13] then cometh the end when he shall have
[46:16] delivered up the kingdom to god
[46:18] even the father when he shall have put
[46:21] down all rule in all authority
[46:25] and power let us pray
[46:30] our dear heavenly father we thank you
[46:32] this evening for being so good to us
[46:35] we thank you for being our all in all
[46:39] and we pray father that you would bless
[46:41] the service in a special way
[46:43] forgive us of our sins and our
[46:45] trespasses
[46:46] all things we may have done and said
[46:48] that have not been pleasing in your
[46:50] sight lord you are a holy god and in
[46:53] your sight lord we are
[46:54] so filthy without your holiness so we
[46:57] pray father that you'll look beyond our
[46:59] faults and see our needs
[47:01] and cover us lord cover us with your
[47:03] blood in jesus christ's name we pray
[47:06] amen you may be seated
[47:11] i wanted to entitle this message the
[47:14] resurrection of the lord jesus christ
[47:17] the sub-topic would be christ in you
[47:21] the hope of glory when we talk about
[47:24] the resurrection or speak of the
[47:26] resurrection
[47:28] we understanding stand that it is the
[47:30] rising or
[47:32] the act of rising from the dead
[47:36] resurrection doesn't mean a replacement
[47:40] it means to take the same thing that
[47:42] went down and bring it back up
[47:46] and when something is brought back up
[47:48] per se to bring back it
[47:49] is brought back for use something to be
[47:53] uh used to gain for example on the mount
[47:58] uh
[47:58] transfiguration we had moses and elijah
[48:03] now they have been dead for hundreds of
[48:06] years
[48:07] in this dimension but
[48:10] true true believers cannot die
[48:14] but when they stood there amen on mount
[48:17] transfiguration with jesus christ they
[48:19] represented the resurrection or the
[48:22] translation of the old
[48:24] and new testament saints and they stood
[48:27] with jesus because jesus says
[48:29] i am the resurrection and i am the life
[48:33] he is the only one that can produce a
[48:36] resurrection
[48:38] when we talk about uh being resurrected
[48:41] or the lord jesus christ
[48:43] being resurrected you know many people
[48:46] look at him uh as he was 2
[48:50] 000 years ago and they can't see him
[48:53] today
[48:54] and it's not something that just so
[48:57] happened
[48:59] uh jesus said that in this day there
[49:02] will be many who can who will not be
[49:04] able
[49:05] to see him he said but you will see him
[49:09] there is an elected group a group of
[49:12] people that
[49:13] god has chosen from the foundation of
[49:16] the world it's
[49:17] it's by the grace of god none of us
[49:19] merited it
[49:20] but we also know that when jesus rose
[49:24] from the dead the bible says
[49:26] 500 or more people saw him uh
[49:30] it's amazing because only 120 showed up
[49:33] at the uh upper room experience on the
[49:36] day of pentecost
[49:37] but you and i understand by god's grace
[49:40] that
[49:41] this resurrection now is is exactly
[49:44] taking place
[49:46] and it has uh gone on for about
[49:49] um i would say 2 000 years
[49:53] uh starting you know when it came to
[49:57] the early church and them falling into
[49:59] the ground the bible said if a
[50:00] seed die and he's not buried it's wasted
[50:05] but if it's planted and if it died if
[50:07] it's rot it'll bring forth more of its
[50:09] kind
[50:10] and that was the mystery of the church
[50:13] through the church ages
[50:14] that the early church would die the seed
[50:18] amen but as the time as time progressed
[50:22] amen that same life that went down in
[50:24] the ground
[50:25] would come up again and began to live in
[50:29] man
[50:30] again but in this day it's greater than
[50:33] it's ever been before
[50:35] because we know that the alpha has
[50:38] become the omega the seed that went down
[50:40] has now
[50:41] come to itself understand by god's grace
[50:45] that the
[50:45] the seed is the life that was in the
[50:49] stalk
[50:50] right and that stalk has to be
[50:52] completely dead and rotted out
[50:55] amen in order for that life to go into
[50:57] the seed
[50:58] and so we must understand that the
[51:01] pentecostal
[51:02] age or that age that we were
[51:05] brought out of has now died and erotic
[51:09] you say well brother looks look at all
[51:10] the what they're doing but
[51:12] if you can understand the purity of the
[51:14] word you can understand amen what god is
[51:17] calling for
[51:18] every church age had a mixture of some
[51:21] kind
[51:22] you know you had the uh uh
[51:25] luther's age was a little mixture with
[51:28] wesley and wesley age was a
[51:30] little mixture with the pentecostal age
[51:32] but in this
[51:33] age amen the seed comes to a pure
[51:37] state it leaves everything that
[51:41] was erroneous amen back into the
[51:44] pentecostal age and now
[51:45] it stands as a pure seed why because
[51:48] it represents the word of god
[51:51] you understand me so you say well what
[51:54] do you mean brother books let's say it
[51:55] like this
[51:56] we have come out of laodicea but has
[51:59] laodicea come out of us
[52:02] there are a lot of things that they did
[52:04] pentecostal people like
[52:06] things that they believed that seemed to
[52:08] be all right until
[52:10] malachi 4 came and then when malachi 4
[52:13] came he was the
[52:14] voice of god he was a prophet of god
[52:16] that was able to identify the error
[52:19] that was in that particular age and he
[52:22] says now
[52:23] you and i who came out of that most of
[52:25] us some of us came right off the street
[52:27] but
[52:27] the age that we come out of was the
[52:29] pentecostal age
[52:30] and that age has to die all of his
[52:34] error in all of his erring ways has to
[52:37] die
[52:37] and this is why the word of god has come
[52:40] to us
[52:40] in such a pure form right
[52:44] we can't look at god as a trinity we
[52:46] can't look at god
[52:47] in in the light of three persons we
[52:50] can't look at
[52:51] uh the baptism and all of those things
[52:52] that that that was around us to
[52:54] erroneous during that time we must have
[52:57] to die we must die and rot to that in
[53:00] order to produce jesus christ
[53:02] because remember the bible tells us that
[53:04] he was going to produce
[53:05] a church without spot wrinkle or blemish
[53:08] that means none of man's stuff
[53:12] will be added to this word the word
[53:15] itself would produce the very christ
[53:18] jesus that died uh and rose again
[53:22] when we see by god's grace the spirit of
[53:26] the lord moving
[53:27] god has come to the this age where he
[53:30] has
[53:30] brought down the capstone and he has
[53:33] placed us in a mysterious age or
[53:36] an age that a lot of people cannot to
[53:38] this day see
[53:39] even in the message uh some people don't
[53:41] want to recognize the eighth day and
[53:43] some people don't want to recognize the
[53:45] bride age and you know they said it was
[53:47] only seven but brother branham said
[53:49] there were eight
[53:50] he comes along and says well let's put
[53:52] it this way he said that
[53:54] seventh was the completion but god
[53:56] brought us back to a holy convocation
[53:59] which was the eighth day which was the
[54:00] first day
[54:02] so if we're now in the first day what
[54:04] are we supposed to produce and
[54:05] by god's grace i want you to understand
[54:07] that there's a reflection there is
[54:09] something
[54:09] that god is doing in each and every one
[54:11] of us
[54:13] and being just ordinary christians
[54:16] will not work for this day there is a
[54:19] process there is something that god is
[54:21] doing
[54:22] amen and he's creating because remember
[54:25] the bible according to revelation the
[54:26] third chapter
[54:27] tells us that jesus christ was the
[54:30] beginning of god's creation
[54:32] right he created adam but now he's
[54:35] there's a second atom that's being
[54:36] formed and he's not being formed out of
[54:39] the dust of the earth
[54:40] but he's being formed by spirit and he's
[54:43] being formed by
[54:44] character amen you know his character
[54:48] he's now forming and shaping us into
[54:51] himself
[54:52] right hallelujah now
[54:55] let me read a few quotes so you can
[54:57] understand where i'm coming from
[54:59] the death and burial and resurrection of
[55:01] jesus christ wasn't just
[55:03] for us to celebrate like we do now
[55:07] with these uh great easter bunnies and
[55:09] eggs and all of these kind of
[55:11] uh strange things that the uh uh
[55:16] manufacturers have have have placed in
[55:18] there
[55:19] but if we're going to celebrate easter
[55:22] the best way of
[55:23] celebrating easter is not outwardly but
[55:26] inwardly
[55:30] because that's where the real easter is
[55:32] that's where the real resurrection is
[55:35] he said in that day you'll know that i'm
[55:38] in the father the father's in me
[55:40] and i am in you and he declared amen and
[55:43] lazarus to me says
[55:44] i am the resurrection so
[55:48] what what are we looking for brethren
[55:50] said when this spirit has found you
[55:53] the individual and has come upon you
[55:57] it is the potential of your eternal
[56:00] inheritance
[56:01] that god thought of you and made
[56:06] for you before the foundation of the
[56:09] world
[56:11] that is your potential like if you ask
[56:14] me of an oak tree and i give you an
[56:16] acorn
[56:17] the life for the egg oak tree
[56:20] is in the acon now but you have to
[56:24] wait till it grow now he's talking about
[56:28] being born again right when you confess
[56:31] with your mouth believe with your heart
[56:33] at that point in time amen you pass from
[56:36] death unto life
[56:37] well that's just a seed that's just the
[56:40] beginning of something
[56:42] uh a marvelous happening in you and
[56:44] that's why paul said
[56:45] we must grow up into him in other words
[56:48] you must grow up
[56:49] into what we call the holy spirit all
[56:52] right
[56:53] so do we when you receive the holy
[56:56] spirit of god
[56:57] it's god's potential waiting upon you
[57:01] that's already recognized you
[57:04] and you're sealed by the spirit of
[57:06] promise of god
[57:08] into the body of christ when god looked
[57:11] down
[57:12] at calvary and seen jesus dying
[57:16] you heard what he said sealed with the
[57:18] spirit of promise
[57:20] okay right he not only he
[57:24] died for his bride the body which is the
[57:27] word
[57:27] church the church that believes the word
[57:30] of god
[57:31] for the age whether it's feet body head
[57:34] or whatever it is see
[57:36] christ was bleeding and dying and god
[57:40] looking upon him saw his resurrection
[57:42] and the church
[57:44] raised with him on easter
[57:48] amen now that's amazing to me because i
[57:51] don't remember it but i believe it with
[57:55] all my heart hallelujah
[57:58] now i by god's grace if you've got to
[58:00] believe it this way
[58:02] because it has nothing to do with your
[58:04] flesh
[58:06] you've got nothing to do with this it's
[58:09] all in the hands of god right
[58:12] amen and he that begun the good work in
[58:15] you
[58:15] is faithful to complete it now we are
[58:18] going to all go
[58:19] our own separate ways we're going to
[58:22] have our own trials and our own
[58:23] disappointments
[58:25] uh are we going to have our personal
[58:26] pressures and all of those things but
[58:29] all of these trials work together for
[58:32] the good
[58:33] hey you don't have to understand it
[58:35] right
[58:36] i don't understand how you mix eggs and
[58:38] sugar and flour and
[58:40] all that good stuff and it comes out as
[58:42] a cake i don't understand it put some
[58:44] heat to it
[58:45] all i know is that it's real good when
[58:46] it's finished
[58:49] hallelujah hey you know i don't know the
[58:51] chemistry of it but i know if you mix
[58:53] certain things together
[58:54] you can come out with a good product and
[58:56] that's what god is doing
[58:59] with you and me it's what what he's
[59:02] doing and i'm appreciating
[59:04] that's why god said in all things give
[59:06] thanks now i'mma hurry up by god's grace
[59:09] because when jesus christ died when he
[59:12] died
[59:14] the bible tells us that the romans he
[59:16] was he was buried and the romans
[59:18] put a roman seal a stone
[59:23] in front because uh
[59:26] you said what they didn't put the stone
[59:27] but they put the seal of rome they
[59:29] wrapped it
[59:30] trying to make sure he wouldn't get out
[59:33] right
[59:34] and that's that's the practice of every
[59:37] organization
[59:38] and denomination they tried to seal
[59:42] the body of christ inside their tomb
[59:47] hallelujah but you see no seal
[59:51] no denomination no organization
[59:54] nothing can hold christ
[59:59] keep him back wrong tried to keep him
[1:00:02] and every church system crucifies him
[1:00:06] buries him and then bind him and then
[1:00:09] they seal him with
[1:00:10] their stone of unbelief
[1:00:14] hallelujah but you see one thing for
[1:00:17] certain
[1:00:18] they could have had all of the roman
[1:00:20] soldiers out there
[1:00:22] outside of the tomb pressing on the
[1:00:24] stone
[1:00:25] it still would not have been able to
[1:00:28] hold his body down
[1:00:30] hallelujah amen why because the word of
[1:00:33] god had already said
[1:00:35] i'll not let your your soul seek
[1:00:38] corruption
[1:00:39] y'all know how it goes and your fleshy
[1:00:41] corruption right
[1:00:43] he said i won't let it happen by god's
[1:00:45] grace and he did not
[1:00:48] hallelujah no seal could hold him that's
[1:00:51] what brother adam said
[1:00:53] no seal could hold him he'd come forth
[1:00:56] god broke the seal
[1:00:57] the seal of the tomb broke the seal of
[1:01:00] death
[1:01:00] broke the seal of hell broke the seal of
[1:01:03] the grave
[1:01:04] and came forth triumphant what did it
[1:01:07] wait a minute let me put my can i say
[1:01:09] this because i want you to understand
[1:01:11] what he said he broke the seal of death
[1:01:14] that's why two christians aren't afraid
[1:01:16] to die
[1:01:18] he broke the seal of hell that's why
[1:01:20] true christians
[1:01:21] are afraid to go to hell they cannot go
[1:01:25] hallelujah and he broke the seal of the
[1:01:28] grave
[1:01:29] you know it's amazing because we really
[1:01:32] don't go to the grave
[1:01:34] just the body the shell go there but as
[1:01:36] soon as we depart from the
[1:01:38] shell we go up hallelujah
[1:01:41] thank god for what we call easter the
[1:01:44] resurrection amen
[1:01:46] they couldn't destroy the body they but
[1:01:48] they
[1:01:49] they could never destroy the seal
[1:01:53] see god gave the church a seal then
[1:01:56] that could never be destroyed when they
[1:01:59] destroyed abel
[1:02:00] he raised up south when they destroyed
[1:02:03] one prophet
[1:02:04] there raised up another prophet they
[1:02:06] kept destroying
[1:02:08] but god give them something then
[1:02:11] that they cannot destroy it's the
[1:02:13] supernatural spirit
[1:02:15] it's the holy ghost itself and it's
[1:02:19] infallible
[1:02:20] and it's imperishable it cannot be
[1:02:23] destroyed
[1:02:25] it lives on and on and on
[1:02:28] and because he lives we live with him
[1:02:32] because we are sealed into the body of
[1:02:34] the lord jesus christ
[1:02:36] hallelujah that means once you're in
[1:02:38] there you can't come out
[1:02:40] he seals it up amen
[1:02:43] no way to ever be destroyed what
[1:02:46] so when the devil tells you that you're
[1:02:48] going to be destroyed you say no way
[1:02:51] no way no way to ever be destroyed
[1:02:54] cannot perish
[1:02:55] but the but has eternal life amen
[1:02:59] god's great ripping of them seals
[1:03:04] you see there was also a seal
[1:03:10] we call it the veil it kept us
[1:03:13] out of heaven but on the day of
[1:03:16] the resurrection when the day of death
[1:03:20] amen when they died it says it's
[1:03:21] finished the bible said amen
[1:03:24] he ripped that veil and twain
[1:03:27] from top to bottom hallelujah
[1:03:30] if he would have said from bottom to top
[1:03:32] we may have thought it was a man
[1:03:34] but it was god amen from heaven coming
[1:03:38] down
[1:03:40] oh my christ died at calvary
[1:03:43] how that he went up to that cross and i
[1:03:46] i want to go on now
[1:03:47] i was reading a little book and this is
[1:03:49] the thing that really excited me
[1:03:51] brother adam said he was reading a
[1:03:52] little book here not long ago that
[1:03:55] on to some kind of research somebody did
[1:03:58] some research
[1:03:59] and in this research he said i found
[1:04:01] something
[1:04:02] most startling i sat down
[1:04:06] and i laid the book down i raised up my
[1:04:08] hand
[1:04:09] and praised god and i got up walked and
[1:04:12] walked around a little bit
[1:04:14] sat down and read it again and i thought
[1:04:17] oh
[1:04:18] is that so that on this same
[1:04:21] hill where jesus was crucified
[1:04:25] adam died and was buried
[1:04:28] the same hill that jesus died on
[1:04:32] and was buried on the same hill where
[1:04:34] adam died
[1:04:36] he died on golgotha and was buried on
[1:04:39] golgotha
[1:04:41] and you know what he was raised
[1:04:44] from golgotha because when jesus raised
[1:04:48] from the dead
[1:04:49] all the old testament saints raced with
[1:04:52] him
[1:04:53] i thought what uh how appropriate this
[1:04:57] is whether it's right or wrong
[1:05:00] [Laughter]
[1:05:04] hallelujah amen we may not be able to
[1:05:07] prove it but how
[1:05:08] appropriate that would be god cannot
[1:05:10] change
[1:05:12] hallelujah that's why i get stirred up
[1:05:14] about easter i get stirred about the
[1:05:16] resurrection i get stirred about spring
[1:05:18] amen because i heard and i read some
[1:05:20] things where they said that
[1:05:22] that uh jesus died on the sixth and uh
[1:05:25] and if he did died on the
[1:05:26] excuse he said that uh and his birthday
[1:05:29] was on the ninth or
[1:05:30] you know and and you know um brother
[1:05:33] birthday is on the ninth i believe it is
[1:05:35] six or the ninth one of the two but
[1:05:36] anyway it's still april
[1:05:40] april it's the springtime and when
[1:05:43] people say well what brother around we
[1:05:44] got to do with it well
[1:05:45] amen that medium told him that his
[1:05:47] birthday was a memorial to jesus
[1:05:49] christ's birthday
[1:05:50] so they had the same birthday
[1:05:54] man that gets rid of december but
[1:05:57] nevertheless
[1:05:58] let's let's move on so what are you
[1:06:00] saying
[1:06:02] easter springtime god cannot change
[1:06:05] his ways resurrection must
[1:06:09] occur in the spring
[1:06:12] it cannot in the winter neither can it
[1:06:15] happen in the fall
[1:06:17] oh lord have mercy so we don't have to
[1:06:20] pray about lord
[1:06:21] not this side of not this side of the
[1:06:23] earth don't let my flight be in the
[1:06:25] wintertime
[1:06:28] hallelujah so you say well what do you
[1:06:30] mean brother see
[1:06:31] and i don't know i just i'm just going
[1:06:33] by what you know i heard this
[1:06:35] uh from some of the saints and they've
[1:06:37] gone on the glory now but they told me
[1:06:38] that brother branham told them
[1:06:40] that that the resurrection would take
[1:06:42] place one early easter
[1:06:44] now i mean you can't get it no earlier
[1:06:48] than the fourth
[1:06:50] i don't know but it's but don't get me
[1:06:52] i'm not prophesying anything
[1:06:54] i'm just saying i think we need to wake
[1:06:56] up and smell the coffee
[1:06:58] because it's in this time of plagues
[1:07:02] that's what he said in the time of
[1:07:04] plagues
[1:07:05] is when the resurrection will take place
[1:07:08] that's what he said hallelujah
[1:07:12] whoo
[1:07:16] he said but if there listen the
[1:07:17] scripture said but if there be no
[1:07:19] resurrection of the dead
[1:07:20] then is christ not risen can you imagine
[1:07:23] that this would be it
[1:07:25] oh hallelujah y'all understand me
[1:07:29] if this was it how can you be happy with
[1:07:32] this
[1:07:36] i was telling somebody the other day i
[1:07:38] said it's getting so bad i hear myself
[1:07:39] get up at the chair and i hear myself go
[1:07:41] down
[1:07:46] and it's going to get worse your future
[1:07:49] it's going to get worse
[1:07:53] you know a close friend of mine uh
[1:07:57] died the other day and i was hoping it's
[1:08:00] just a strange thing i
[1:08:01] kept thinking about and thinking about
[1:08:02] it and i called one of the friends down
[1:08:04] south and i said
[1:08:05] well when sister reece died where if she
[1:08:08] should go home to be with the lord i
[1:08:10] said
[1:08:10] would you please call me so i because
[1:08:12] i'd like to come to the funeral well the
[1:08:14] funeral is saturday so i won't be able
[1:08:15] to go

[1:08:20] 109 years old
[1:08:25] she wasn't sick she was worn out
[1:08:30] but she kept god i'm telling you that
[1:08:32] lady
[1:08:33] if you had seen her bible you would well
[1:08:35] i was powerful
[1:08:37] because she she knew her words she kept
[1:08:39] on it she loved the lord she
[1:08:41] she had a uh uh uh uh uh
[1:08:46] her husband was not wasn't a saved man i
[1:08:48] don't know whether he did get saved or
[1:08:49] not but
[1:08:50] i just know one thing you would have
[1:08:51] never known
[1:08:53] that later rolled her husband in church
[1:08:55] every time she could and
[1:08:56] you would have never known and you know
[1:08:59] how a man he got he was in a real

[1:12:21] tried in the fire
[1:12:23] hallelujah ephesians this is why i love

[1:12:51] of your mind
[1:12:52] if you don't read your mind or your
[1:12:53] bible and if you don't listen to the
[1:12:55] tapes and if you don't
[1:12:56] you don't pray you'll never renew your
[1:12:58] mind
[1:13:02] your mind will always be carnal and
[1:13:05] he says and and be renewed in the spirit
[1:13:07] of your mind
[1:13:08] and that you put on the new man with
[1:13:11] after god is created
[1:13:13] in righteousness and what true holiness
[1:13:17] you know what true holiness is the holy
[1:13:19] ghost
[1:13:22] i told you i'm not going to be long
[1:13:25] but but i'm coming to something turn
[1:13:28] with me to daniel
[1:13:29] please the third chapter and we've heard
[1:13:32] about daniel in so many
[1:13:34] so many ways and so we've heard him
[1:13:35] preach in a lot of ways but
[1:13:37] you know there's there's something that
[1:13:38] happened here in this third chapter that
[1:13:40] i trust god would give me grace to to
[1:13:42] show you tonight
[1:13:48] y'all remember in daniel when uh
[1:13:51] the image of the brass and
[1:13:55] gold and clay and iron and
[1:14:00] you know the image of the end time it
[1:14:02] was actually
[1:14:03] god showing daniel what the future was
[1:14:05] to be
[1:14:06] uh but when it came down to the iron and
[1:14:09] the clay those were gentile nations
[1:14:12] and um and those nations never did mix
[1:14:16] they tried to be but you know clay and
[1:14:18] iron don't mix
[1:14:21] and uh so we know what brother adam said
[1:14:23] about you know go uh uh
[1:14:24] the different men who who uh khrushchev
[1:14:27] and
[1:14:28] the other guy who uh they didn't mix but
[1:14:32] um
[1:14:32] but nevertheless let's move on reading
[1:14:35] from the 19th verse then with neville
[1:14:37] ganesa full of fury
[1:14:39] and the form of his vision was changed
[1:14:41] against shadrach
[1:14:43] meshach and abednego therefore he spake
[1:14:45] and commanded that they should heat
[1:14:48] the furnace one seven times more than it
[1:14:51] was
[1:14:52] was want to be heated and he commanded
[1:14:55] the most
[1:14:56] mighty men that were in his army to bind
[1:14:59] shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:15:01] and to cast them into the furnace of
[1:15:03] burning furnish now i want you to
[1:15:04] understand that this
[1:15:05] this king right now
[1:15:09] he's really a type of the church because
[1:15:12] he's lifted up
[1:15:13] he's prideful you think he ought to be
[1:15:15] worshipped and if you don't if you
[1:15:17] if you get what i'm saying even in this
[1:15:19] day you find out that
[1:15:21] churches want to be worshipped i'm a
[1:15:23] baptist i'm a methodist or
[1:15:25] i'm a great church you know and
[1:15:27] according to proverbs
[1:15:28] 7 you'll find out that the churches and
[1:15:31] then they sit on the corners
[1:15:33] and you know they invite people in you
[1:15:36] know and
[1:15:36] and they're serving them stolen waters
[1:15:39] you know yeah you understand they're
[1:15:42] feeding them they're deceiving them
[1:15:44] and the bible said that men don't even
[1:15:46] know that their way
[1:15:47] is leading down to hell and that's what
[1:15:50] we got today we've got all kinds of
[1:15:53] worship and all kinds of idolatry
[1:15:55] you know nothing no image not even a
[1:15:58] prophet's image should come into the
[1:16:00] in in in to block your vision of jesus
[1:16:03] christ
[1:16:04] hallelujah that's why john said i must
[1:16:06] decrease that he must increase
[1:16:09] and so it is in our day it is jesus
[1:16:11] christ and him only
[1:16:13] amen right and he commanded the most
[1:16:17] mighty men
[1:16:18] that were in his army to bind shadrach
[1:16:20] meshach and abednego
[1:16:22] and to cast them into the burning fire
[1:16:24] furnace
[1:16:25] then these men were bound in their coats
[1:16:28] their
[1:16:29] hosums and their hats and their other
[1:16:31] garments and were cast into the midst
[1:16:34] of the burning furnace therefore
[1:16:37] because the king commandment was urgent
[1:16:40] and the furnace exceedingly hot
[1:16:42] the flame of the fire slew those men
[1:16:45] that took up shadrach meshach and
[1:16:48] abednego
[1:16:49] in other words the very thing they tried
[1:16:51] to bind them with and destroy them with
[1:16:53] is the very thing that came back to
[1:16:55] destroy them
[1:16:56] and these three men shattered right
[1:16:58] meshach and abednego fell
[1:16:59] down bound into the midst of the fiery
[1:17:02] furnace
[1:17:06] the then nebuchadnezzar the king was uh
[1:17:10] uh stoned aston
[1:17:13] and rose up in haste and spake and said
[1:17:16] unto
[1:17:17] his counselors did not we cast three men
[1:17:20] bound into the midst of the fire
[1:17:23] and they answered and said unto the king
[1:17:25] true o king
[1:17:27] and he answered and said lo i see four
[1:17:30] men
[1:17:30] loosed walking in the midst of the fire
[1:17:34] and they have no hurt and the form of
[1:17:37] the fourth
[1:17:38] is like the son of god
[1:17:41] amen now when we look at this we you
[1:17:44] know we automatically see
[1:17:46] you know basically what has been given
[1:17:48] to us to see
[1:17:50] but brother branham says an astonishing
[1:17:52] thing
[1:17:53] uh that uh that that really caught my
[1:17:56] attention and i'll read it in just a
[1:17:59] moment
[1:18:00] because i want you to understand that
[1:18:02] these men brother brown said they prayed
[1:18:06] and they didn't get an answer god didn't
[1:18:10] come to their rescue there was no
[1:18:11] lightning bolt
[1:18:13] or any kind of feeling or whatever but
[1:18:15] they said within themselves
[1:18:17] if whether he deliver us or not we're
[1:18:20] not going to bow to the image
[1:18:23] in other words they were under pressure
[1:18:26] what happened to all of the other
[1:18:27] israelites and all of the other jews
[1:18:30] that were down
[1:18:31] in babylon evidently they they bowed
[1:18:34] but these one who had something they had
[1:18:38] a substance call it faith if you like
[1:18:41] they had something amen they were
[1:18:43] holding on to that wasn't
[1:18:45] visible to the eye until
[1:18:49] the pressure came you see what i'm
[1:18:51] saying in other words when pressure
[1:18:52] comes you
[1:18:53] everybody can look like a christian you
[1:18:56] know look look perfect
[1:18:57] but when pressure come that's when the
[1:18:59] real you
[1:19:00] shows up hallelujah
[1:19:03] and no matter how embarrassing he the
[1:19:05] real uv
[1:19:06] is he's coming through right
[1:19:10] amen because amen it is a carnal
[1:19:12] situation you're working with
[1:19:14] but when you're born again and there is
[1:19:17] a true
[1:19:17] life of god on the inside when the
[1:19:20] pressure comes
[1:19:21] now i'm telling you this you can you can
[1:19:24] have that beginning you can have that
[1:19:26] that uh you know uh like i said that
[1:19:28] promise
[1:19:30] you know the promise is sure he's gonna
[1:19:32] make you perfect
[1:19:34] amen but you must understand your trials
[1:19:38] come to make you perfect
[1:19:40] it comes to make you strong in the areas
[1:19:43] that you're weak in
[1:19:44] right if you suffer in patience you're
[1:19:47] going to keep having those trials until
[1:19:48] that patient is perfected
[1:19:50] and it will not be your patience it will
[1:19:53] be his
[1:19:54] it's something that you must die out to
[1:19:57] and let him live it for you
[1:20:00] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:20:04] now here it says in uh god's preparation
[1:20:10] he says we know king nebuchadnezzar
[1:20:12] dream dreams and daniel
[1:20:13] interpreted which set the whole gentile
[1:20:16] world see
[1:20:18] show it from the beginning to the end of
[1:20:20] it
[1:20:21] the second coming of christ and all
[1:20:25] a man's dream how
[1:20:28] king pharaoh dream dreams and joseph the
[1:20:32] interpreter
[1:20:33] told him what it meant but here it's
[1:20:36] amazing how god
[1:20:38] talked to these kings who weren't even
[1:20:41] christians
[1:20:42] they didn't believe in the faith they
[1:20:44] didn't have the faith
[1:20:46] but god used them to make a believer
[1:20:50] right and when we saw this great man
[1:20:53] with the
[1:20:54] big helmet on his head and brass and you
[1:20:57] know
[1:20:57] stood there as he as the image of
[1:21:00] of the future uh we didn't we didn't see
[1:21:04] the rapture in it
[1:21:06] we didn't see that we saw all that
[1:21:08] israel went through but remember
[1:21:10] there was a stone hewn out of the
[1:21:12] mountain and that stone
[1:21:14] came down from babylon crushing
[1:21:18] all of the kingdoms now i want to say
[1:21:21] this to you
[1:21:22] because a stone did come down and the
[1:21:26] way we have
[1:21:26] seen it perhaps is working in a
[1:21:29] different way
[1:21:30] all of the kingdoms are being crushed
[1:21:34] right now because the stone
[1:21:37] came down and now that the stone who is
[1:21:40] christ is in his
[1:21:42] believers amen you don't even know
[1:21:44] you're working something
[1:21:46] you don't even know you're doing
[1:21:47] something but god because of you
[1:21:50] is destroying all of the kingdoms right
[1:21:54] now
[1:21:56] now
[1:21:59] if you ain't doing it now when is he
[1:22:00] going to do it
[1:22:06] and almost every kingdom around is so
[1:22:09] they so disoriented they you know they
[1:22:11] they have this
[1:22:12] insanity going on to to destroy
[1:22:15] everything
[1:22:16] yeah it's true or even china come out
[1:22:19] you know a nuclear war hello
[1:22:22] you know you can't have one without
[1:22:23] destroying the world
[1:22:26] but you got those out there
[1:22:30] you know what i'm saying it's real y'all
[1:22:32] understand me
[1:22:33] we're not in there so we don't see
[1:22:35] really all the darkness that's going on
[1:22:38] we're standing out here we're looking at
[1:22:39] them and like that doesn't make sense
[1:22:43] but to them it makes sense because they
[1:22:46] are anointed with the spirit of
[1:22:47] destruction
[1:22:49] this is god's doing because they
[1:22:52] rejected the gospel
[1:22:53] now they are they are confused
[1:22:58] you remember that the story about the
[1:22:59] leopards
[1:23:01] they were they says uh why you know
[1:23:04] are we going to stay out here and die
[1:23:06] why should we stay out here and die
[1:23:08] right you know i think it was assyrians
[1:23:11] i can't remember which army it was but
[1:23:13] here god calls the noise at night and
[1:23:16] the army got to fighting and killing
[1:23:18] each other
[1:23:21] hallelujah and the lepers they walked in
[1:23:24] their eating
[1:23:26] right i forgot and this one man said
[1:23:29] ain't going dead it never happened
[1:23:30] he got trampled because he disbelieved
[1:23:35] hallelujah let me tell you something
[1:23:37] there's nothing too hard for god
[1:23:40] if god can pour the red sea raise the
[1:23:42] man from the dead hallelujah
[1:23:44] amen turn water into wine what is your
[1:23:47] problem
[1:23:48] it ain't god he's not the problem our
[1:23:51] problem is unbelief
[1:23:53] hey the bible said if you have the faith
[1:23:55] to believe
[1:23:56] you can speak to a mountain and that
[1:23:58] mountain has to move
[1:23:59] he didn't say it was going to move when
[1:24:01] you wanted it to but it must move
[1:24:03] if you really believe huh
[1:24:06] how can god in this day give a person
[1:24:09] eyes who didn't even have sockets
[1:24:12] and then ask the little girl what color
[1:24:14] you want
[1:24:18] see we because what it is we got to
[1:24:21] understand
[1:24:22] that same life that was in william
[1:24:23] branham has shifted
[1:24:25] he's moved up into the bride
[1:24:29] but if you don't have the faith to work
[1:24:31] it it will never be worked
[1:24:35] is that right that's the word when the
[1:24:38] storm came and the
[1:24:40] disciple was on the seat and they woke
[1:24:43] jesus up and said carrot thou not that
[1:24:45] we perish
[1:24:46] jesus didn't say nothing but one thing
[1:24:49] peace be still
[1:24:50] and then he looked at them and says oh
[1:24:52] ye of little faith
[1:24:54] in other words you had the ability i've
[1:24:56] given you to the author
[1:24:58] the authority to do it but you want it
[1:25:00] can't work without faith
[1:25:02] you got to believe it you listen if you
[1:25:05] have the faith to believe it will
[1:25:07] materialize
[1:25:11] why because you and i when our faith is
[1:25:13] not working with this dimension
[1:25:15] there's nothing that can hold it there's
[1:25:18] nothing that can stop faith
[1:25:20] nothing
[1:25:24] you believe that the bible says all
[1:25:26] those old testament saints
[1:25:28] died in faith thousands of years they
[1:25:31] probably didn't have enough ash to put
[1:25:33] in a teaspoon
[1:25:34] but when god got up hallelujah
[1:25:38] and he that that voice of the
[1:25:40] resurrection called amen
[1:25:42] all of those ashes potash whatever
[1:25:44] calcium
[1:25:45] no matter where they were they got back
[1:25:47] together
[1:25:50] but they died in faith believing in the
[1:25:53] resurrection
[1:25:56] hallelujah christ lives
[1:25:59] say how you know he lives brother he
[1:26:01] lives in me
[1:26:03] hallelujah see we look at the fourth man
[1:26:07] but i'm gonna show you what brother adam
[1:26:08] said the fourth man was about
[1:26:13] i'm excited because you got to
[1:26:16] understand
[1:26:18] christ is doing something and brother
[1:26:21] branham said
[1:26:22] that the fire that will the the uh the
[1:26:25] trial that will come in this last day
[1:26:27] will be seven times harder
[1:26:30] there were seven times so seven times
[1:26:32] what hotter
[1:26:34] is what seven times seven is what
[1:26:39] yeah 48 49.
[1:26:43] okay i want to make sure i said 49 too
[1:26:46] but i
[1:26:48] want to make sure anyway
[1:26:51] he said daniel and this is what you got
[1:26:53] to understand
[1:26:54] you've got a purpose in your heart that
[1:26:57] you're not going to defile yourself
[1:27:02] it starts with you it's
[1:27:05] i can't do it for you i got to do it for
[1:27:07] me
[1:27:11] daniel had purpose in his heart he
[1:27:14] wasn't going to
[1:27:15] defile himself with the world
[1:27:18] it has to start here and what did he do
[1:27:23] it saved his life
[1:27:26] the hebrews children the same way
[1:27:29] and every person that ever served god
[1:27:33] becomes an image of god
[1:27:39] was god expressing his own
[1:27:43] word through them you understand me
[1:27:47] daniel was an image of god the three who
[1:27:50] hebrew boys were images of god
[1:27:53] god expressing himself
[1:27:56] through them you are image of god
[1:28:00] this is what it's all about we are here
[1:28:03] to prove that the resurrection
[1:28:05] is real
[1:28:10] we're here to prove that the
[1:28:13] resurrection is
[1:28:14] real how else the world is going to know
[1:28:18] the bible said you are a light that
[1:28:20] it upon a hill
[1:28:22] that cannot be hid and he says listen
[1:28:24] don't put your light on the bushel
[1:28:27] don't hide it shine it glorify god
[1:28:31] that's right
[1:28:35] hallelujah he says because the hebrew
[1:28:38] children said
[1:28:39] our god listen because the hebrew
[1:28:43] children
[1:28:43] said our god is able to deliver
[1:28:47] us they had no revelation of it
[1:28:51] no more than that
[1:28:54] because we don't hear nothing about the
[1:28:56] miracles happening in their lives
[1:28:58] they were in babylon they were basically
[1:29:01] slaves
[1:29:03] they had no rights hallelujah
[1:29:07] see they had no revelation of it nor
[1:29:11] more than that but said
[1:29:14] however excuse me but
[1:29:18] whoever however we are
[1:29:21] not bow down to your image what was it
[1:29:25] this is a key they were expressing faith
[1:29:29] in the word of god and god
[1:29:34] expressed himself back and reflected
[1:29:39] and he was the fourth man that they seen
[1:29:44] in the mirror in there
[1:29:48] yes it meant that god was
[1:29:51] reflecting through those boys to the to
[1:29:54] the to
[1:29:54] until the the king says i see a fourth
[1:29:58] one
[1:29:59] but he was seeing supernatural what was
[1:30:02] in them was now reflecting in an image
[1:30:06] that he saw
[1:30:10] hallelujah and that's the kind of
[1:30:12] reflection god
[1:30:13] wants reflected through us
[1:30:17] that under pressure they'll see god in
[1:30:21] you
[1:30:21] and he'll stand there amen reflecting
[1:30:24] himself
[1:30:27] and god expressed himself back and
[1:30:29] reflected and he was the fourth man that
[1:30:32] they seen in the mirror in there
[1:30:36] god expressing himself through the
[1:30:39] living
[1:30:40] images hallelujah
[1:30:43] see what they do not understand he's the
[1:30:47] same yesterday today and forever
[1:30:49] hallelujah so what i'm trying to tell
[1:30:51] you is that
[1:30:52] when that this is this is under the
[1:30:55] seals now this is this is some of that
[1:30:56] mystery
[1:30:57] so when god this pressure come on us the
[1:31:00] character will be just like
[1:31:02] his and whether he deliver us or not we
[1:31:05] know he's able
[1:31:06] when we do the we we go through the test
[1:31:10] you understand me you got to go through
[1:31:12] the test
[1:31:13] you must go through the test you've got
[1:31:15] to be tried
[1:31:17] hallelujah boy
[1:31:20] but when they see what they see
[1:31:26] huh oh you say brothers what are you
[1:31:28] talking about listen
[1:31:30] they tried to bore john
[1:31:34] they tried everything they could they
[1:31:35] thought he'd die out there on that
[1:31:37] island
[1:31:39] they tied him to the polls and i think
[1:31:40] they they pierced him because
[1:31:43] you know they tried to burn him he
[1:31:44] couldn't burn
[1:31:46] the fire would go back the fire's
[1:31:49] supposed to come this way
[1:31:50] if i said hi that's john that's anointed
[1:31:53] you understand me amen so they couldn't
[1:31:56] kill him so they pierced him
[1:31:57] and then when they pierced him amen his
[1:31:59] blood flowed out put the fire out and
[1:32:01] here come a dove
[1:32:05] oh the holy ghost flew out of him he had
[1:32:08] to be in there somewhere
[1:32:09] so you see god will never leave himself
[1:32:12] without a witness
[1:32:14] hallelujah that's right
[1:32:18] so you said oh god brother brown says
[1:32:21] until and i'm closing
[1:32:23] until the church of the living god
[1:32:26] that's called the bride of christ
[1:32:28] get herself connected with god like that
[1:32:33] she'll still wallow in the world in the
[1:32:36] mirror clay of sin
[1:32:38] until she's connected with god in such a
[1:32:41] way
[1:32:42] till her heart is so filled with glory
[1:32:45] and power of god
[1:32:47] until she can't see nothing else but
[1:32:49] christ
[1:32:51] that's right that's what we have to do
[1:32:54] that's the only plan the only program
[1:32:57] god has
[1:32:58] is to do a thing like that you've got to
[1:33:00] be not artificially took in
[1:33:03] you got to be born in not shook in
[1:33:06] or bring a letter to the church but to
[1:33:09] be born into the church of the living
[1:33:11] god
[1:33:11] by the regeneration by the power of the
[1:33:14] resurrection of jesus christ
[1:33:16] that makes you a new creature in him
[1:33:18] amen
[1:33:19] he said that straighten it up that's
[1:33:22] straightening it up
[1:33:24] that does it see yes sir you got we got
[1:33:27] to straighten it up
[1:33:28] we're talking about the resurrection we
[1:33:30] have to straighten it up somehow we've
[1:33:32] got to get down
[1:33:33] on our knees and say lord amen take it
[1:33:36] all
[1:33:37] i surrender all oh no matter what that
[1:33:41] is
[1:33:41] i mean take it
[1:33:44] oh you're just holding on to a little
[1:33:46] bit of something he can't do it
[1:33:48] you can't do it a little elevens were
[1:33:50] loving the whole lump and you know if
[1:33:51] you go to peter and he says if you come
[1:33:53] short of any of those
[1:33:54] you fall one time he said you'll forget
[1:33:57] you even saved
[1:33:58] you'll forget you were even saved that's
[1:34:00] how bad
[1:34:01] missing a step will take you into a
[1:34:04] place that you will even question your
[1:34:06] salvation
[1:34:08] we got to keep going moving on up
[1:34:11] hey if the president came in can fall a
[1:34:15] couple of times and get back up
[1:34:20] you can too he didn't stop he got right
[1:34:23] back
[1:34:25] i don't know how he felt once he got on
[1:34:27] the plane
[1:34:29] but one thing for certain he didn't have
[1:34:31] a you know he didn't have
[1:34:32] uh too much pride that he just laid
[1:34:34] there no he got
[1:34:36] up he kept moving y'all hear what i'm
[1:34:39] saying
[1:34:42] oh lord god is good to us you see those
[1:34:44] things and you don't understand
[1:34:46] even in those little things there's a
[1:34:49] spiritual lesson behind it
[1:34:54] and you and i are the we are the
[1:34:57] resurrection
[1:34:59] of jesus christ i don't know how else to
[1:35:02] say it
[1:35:03] the bible said they were first called
[1:35:04] christians at antioch
[1:35:06] why because they walked like him they
[1:35:08] talked like them the miracles followed
[1:35:10] they had loved one toward another all of
[1:35:13] those things were
[1:35:14] there and so much so when they saw those
[1:35:16] group of people they said that's just
[1:35:18] like jesus that's the same christ the
[1:35:19] way christ was
[1:35:21] right they could have been poor no they
[1:35:23] didn't look at the outward
[1:35:25] they looked at the character they saw
[1:35:26] the character that was being formed in
[1:35:28] those people
[1:35:29] and they called them christians wouldn't
[1:35:31] it be wonderful
[1:35:32] amen that you don't have to tell people
[1:35:34] i'm a christian or you got a sign on
[1:35:35] your back i'm a christian or a cross
[1:35:37] i got some of those shirts too but you
[1:35:39] know what that doesn't make you a
[1:35:41] christian
[1:35:43] no no more than standing in a garage
[1:35:44] makes you a car
[1:35:49] you know but that's
[1:35:52] we must understand by god's grace what
[1:35:54] god is doing for us listen people we
[1:35:56] can't remain
[1:35:57] remember i told you in the last few
[1:36:00] services you got to elevate your mind
[1:36:03] you got to renew your mind understand
[1:36:05] who you are and what you came to do
[1:36:07] we have a purpose what made brother
[1:36:11] branham brother branham
[1:36:12] malachi 4 he saw the purpose he
[1:36:15] fulfilled the purpose
[1:36:16] everything that he was supposed to do he
[1:36:18] did it
[1:36:20] right that's what made jesus christ the
[1:36:22] real jesus christ
[1:36:24] he did everything the scripture said he
[1:36:25] was supposed to do
[1:36:27] we're the bride we must do everything
[1:36:31] the bible says we're supposed to do and
[1:36:33] if we don't come there we're not so
[1:36:37] let's stand
[1:36:41] that reflection of christ in us
[1:36:45] is to prove that he's alive and well
[1:36:49] character we've got the word that
[1:36:51] produces character
[1:36:53] we must allow the character to be
[1:36:55] produced in us
[1:36:57] people is through we we think we've got
[1:36:59] to be yes we're human flesh but that's
[1:37:01] not
[1:37:01] us this is not us this is just a shell
[1:37:05] and you think about it you know i can
[1:37:08] remember the time
[1:37:11] you know when god ain't with you you
[1:37:13] know you you
[1:37:15] you're thinking carnal because you you
[1:37:17] profess to be a christian and
[1:37:21] i can remember the time when i was in
[1:37:22] south africa and they let that lioness
[1:37:24] out of the cage
[1:37:28] we were walking it they didn't tell me
[1:37:30] about
[1:37:32] walking sarah i knew sarah when she was
[1:37:34] a cub
[1:37:36] now sarah was a full-grown cat they were
[1:37:40] trying to teach her how to hunt they had
[1:37:42] starved her for about a month
[1:37:45] and so i was there just in time for them
[1:37:48] to let the cat out
[1:37:49] to go hunting but nobody told me
[1:37:52] everybody else
[1:37:54] to be honest with you when they opened
[1:37:56] that cage
[1:37:57] i ran
[1:38:02] i'm just going to tell you how it is and
[1:38:04] was i afraid
[1:38:05] yeah because the whole thing i'm
[1:38:08] thinking
[1:38:08] [Music]
[1:38:10] i'm thinking you know these people crazy
[1:38:12] why are they doing this to me
[1:38:14] and i'm running i'm the only one that
[1:38:16] didn't know and they thought it was a
[1:38:17] joke
[1:38:18] but then the you know brian jones
[1:38:21] started screaming at me
[1:38:22] like i was at fault i said
[1:38:26] what you didn't tell me first of all you
[1:38:29] give me this little piece of stick and
[1:38:31] i'm like
[1:38:32] what is this going to do to a lion
[1:38:36] i didn't know they gave sarah a stick to
[1:38:38] it i guess now we're part of the
[1:38:42] pride to make a long story short
[1:38:47] sarah started pouncing on some men and
[1:38:49] i'm i'm nervous now i'm messed up
[1:38:52] i'm thinking about my wife and all my
[1:38:53] children
[1:38:54] [Music]
[1:38:56] see i don't play with the devil you know
[1:38:58] my mama says don't give that devil an
[1:38:59] inch he'll take a mile
[1:39:01] so i've always had that guy in my mind
[1:39:04] i'm not gonna play with him like that
[1:39:06] and i was very angry i think that was
[1:39:08] probably one of the times i was the
[1:39:10] most i was just if you could have seen
[1:39:13] the spiritual i had steam coming out of
[1:39:15] my head
[1:39:17] and i i just just just was so upset i
[1:39:19] was nervous in my stomach
[1:39:22] and
[1:39:22] [Music]
[1:39:25] but it wasn't all over we're walking and
[1:39:28] sarah she goes and tried to
[1:39:30] catch this animal and she missed it
[1:39:33] and then gideon ratif goes up
[1:39:37] to the house to get a camera he's coming
[1:39:39] back with the camera
[1:39:41] and now sarah is in
[1:39:45] and brian jones is too far to catch her
[1:39:48] with distance but she's closer to to
[1:39:51] retie
[1:39:52] and i'm thinking oh my goodness this cat
[1:39:55] is gonna
[1:39:56] you know jump it and brian started
[1:39:59] running
[1:40:00] sarah sarah he got there just in time
[1:40:05] she was getting ready to go leap at him
[1:40:07] and
[1:40:08] now you can't imagine what i was feeling
[1:40:13] but one thing for certain i promised
[1:40:15] myself i'd never go back
[1:40:17] i have kept my promise but you know it's
[1:40:21] my thing is this i was a preacher
[1:40:26] i had the holy ghost you know
[1:40:30] but it it didn't kick in y'all
[1:40:32] understand me
[1:40:33] there was i was so overwhelmed with fear
[1:40:36] so i'm trying to tell you this
[1:40:40] it's not something you can do
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:44] no god has to be there to stop that
[1:40:48] right brother was getting ready to shoot
[1:40:50] that bull but god stepped in
[1:40:53] see he has to step in every time
[1:40:57] and the lord showed me that there was a
[1:40:59] level of fear you know that i had i had
[1:41:01] never had it before
[1:41:03] never had a sense but i experienced it
[1:41:06] till
[1:41:07] you know you you you you get weak
[1:41:10] [Music]
[1:41:12] i don't know how it be it would be now
[1:41:14] that
[1:41:16] what god has given me much more than
[1:41:18] since then
[1:41:20] and uh but i want to be to a place where
[1:41:24] nothing moves
[1:41:26] [Music]
[1:41:28] those old saints when they were placed
[1:41:30] in the
[1:41:31] in their rome arenas they ran to the
[1:41:33] lines they didn't run from it
[1:41:37] you know it's just something
[1:41:40] we've got to come up to and you know
[1:41:41] from the pulpit to the door
[1:41:44] we got to let go and let god
[1:41:47] some of y'all know i'm leaving on the
[1:41:49] 9th of april and
[1:41:51] and i'm going to seek the lord in a
[1:41:52] special way pray for me
[1:41:56] that when i come back i have something
[1:41:59] to share
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:02] i believe it's just that close i believe
[1:42:05] it's
[1:42:05] it's just that close this is not going
[1:42:08] somewhere to preach or to say
[1:42:11] no just a few people will know that i'm
[1:42:13] there and that you
[1:42:14] all the place will outstand so i can
[1:42:18] have some
[1:42:19] accountability but uh
[1:42:22] i just say maybe i'm out of my mind but
[1:42:25] i really have a strong pull in my life
[1:42:28] i have something that's moving me that
[1:42:30] just
[1:42:31] i can't explain it it just i fight to
[1:42:34] keep from being
[1:42:34] [Music]
[1:42:37] depressed if i want to say it that way
[1:42:40] because i see that we're not where we
[1:42:42] should be
[1:42:43] i'm looking for a supernatural church
[1:42:47] i don't care about everybody now i do
[1:42:49] care but y'all know what i'm saying and
[1:42:51] people going to do what they got to do
[1:42:52] let them do but not me
[1:42:54] i can't stay here because i believe with
[1:42:56] all my heart that the rapture is
[1:42:58] to take place and i just preach to you
[1:43:01] what god is requiring
[1:43:03] that's just not for you that's for me
[1:43:05] too
[1:43:06] and so i just desire your prayers please
[1:43:09] pray for me
[1:43:10] you know
[1:43:13] i've been preparation preparing myself
[1:43:17] the best way i know how and
[1:43:20] i owe it to the church and to myself
[1:43:23] myself first and then the church
[1:43:26] you know so pray for me um
[1:43:30] we're looking forward to this weekend
[1:43:32] brother jesse will be coming i thought
[1:43:34] but since i'm not preaching i'd give you
[1:43:36] a little thought on
[1:43:37] some things that god showed me and i i
[1:43:40] believe right now that the
[1:43:43] what we we're looking at is because of
[1:43:45] what took place in 1963
[1:43:47] brother bradham said even he said that
[1:43:49] thing kept rolling and rolling going on
[1:43:52] going on further and further it didn't
[1:43:54] go off the earth it just went around
[1:43:57] right he talks about the seals when they
[1:43:59] were open and rockets going up
[1:44:01] everything is beginning to unfold and
[1:44:04] and you got to understand we're coming
[1:44:05] into a place
[1:44:06] a heavenly place where we're sitting in
[1:44:09] heavenly places
[1:44:10] thinking like god acting like god
[1:44:13] walking like god talking like god those
[1:44:16] are the things that god
[1:44:17] that pleases him now because this is
[1:44:19] what it's always been
[1:44:21] it's the replenishing of the earth with
[1:44:24] his seed and his seed alone
[1:44:26] that's what it really is let us pray
[1:44:29] father god we come before you we thank
[1:44:32] you for your grace and your mercy
