[18:52] you mean you can you can be seated I'm
[18:55] gonna try to sing a song thank you sure
[18:58] gets our brother I stood in the
[19:18] courtroom the judge turned my way it
[19:24] looks like you're guilty now what do you
[19:29] see
[19:33] I spoke Your Honor I have no defense but
[19:40] that's when mercy walked and mercy
[19:49] walked in and feed it my case call to
[19:57] the stand God's saving grace the blood
[20:04] was presented but covered my sin
[20:10] forgiven when mercy walked in I stood
[20:18] there and wonder how could this be it
[20:25] someone so guilty had just been set free
[20:34] my chains were broken I was born again

[20:58] the stand God's angry
[21:04] the blood was presented but covered my
[21:10] sane forgiven when mercy walked in the
[21:21] blood was presented that covered my sea
[21:28] in forgiving when mercy
[21:36] [Music]
[21:39] Thank you very
[21:42] I'm an ready to be condemned that's a
[21:47] story that I I love to tell and it's not
[21:51] a good story on one side but on the
[21:54] other side it's great i my wife had a
[21:56] cousin who was he was just really it was
[22:00] really rough and the law was pretty well
[22:02] against him and he was he was a drug
[22:04] dealer so he actually was shot in cold
[22:10] blood murder and the law didn't not much
[22:14] about it but when they went to court the
[22:17] lawyer for the for the man that had shot
[22:21] him shows up but the judge didn't show
[22:23] up so they had someone to sit in for the
[22:26] judge and the one that they had to sit
[22:28] in for the judge was this man's lawyer
[22:31] and I said that's a rigged court but I
[22:39] got to thinking about it I said but you
[22:40] know my judge was my lawyer and so I was
[22:47] judged in a rigged court there was no
[22:50] way I could lose because the one
[22:53] standing for me was the same one that
[22:55] was judging me I'm thankful for it
[23:00] Amen if we could this morning let's just
[23:03] turn to the book of Malachi and I was I
[23:08] was telling John and I fer I didn't
[23:11] announce brother John Friday night at
[23:14] Iowa City so I better do it this morning
[23:16] I know you all know Burres john hayes
[23:17] but he's mine he's mine my companion in
[23:21] driving and man I'm thinking will have a
[23:24] driver I get to sleep most away and so
[23:27] Saturday morning yesterday morning I
[23:29] sent him a text I was downstairs I said
[23:31] man are you up yet or what he said hey
[23:33] not all of us got to sleep the whole
[23:35] Drive so but I'm thankful that he got to
[23:40] come with me and so I was thankful that
[23:43] relies a I went back to Iowa City this
[23:45] morning because the Lord laid the same
[23:47] thought on my heart for this more
[23:48] that it was on my heart that I had
[23:51] preached Friday night and I said man I
[23:54] don't want him to have to hear this
[23:56] twice but God knows all things so man we
[24:01] we think for this morning Malachi
[24:04] chapter 4 for behold the day cometh that
[24:09] shall burn as an oven and all the proud
[24:13] yea and all that do wickedly shall be
[24:17] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[24:20] burn them up saith the Lord of Hosts
[24:22] that it shall leave them neither root
[24:24] nor branch now this is not a good
[24:28] prophecy this is this is not positive
[24:32] this is not telling you oh everything's
[24:34] going to be good and it's all going to
[24:36] work out for you know this is this
[24:38] sounds pretty negative but I want you to
[24:40] notice that he's not speaking to the
[24:41] bride here because now he's going to
[24:44] make a turn he says but unto you oh
[24:47] brother I'm thankful the Prophet came
[24:49] and and he gave he gave witness of
[24:52] things that were going to happen he
[24:54] talked about that the earth was going to
[24:56] see a Great Tribulation he said that the
[24:58] United States would be laying in craters
[25:00] and ashes he saw it by a vision but but
[25:02] he wasn't talking to us remember because
[25:04] at one point in his ministry turns and
[25:06] he says now I'm gonna call you the bride
[25:08] so you'll understand it he wasn't
[25:10] calling us the church he was speaking
[25:12] lip to ear God to his bride to us so
[25:15] there's some there's some things that
[25:17] are not positive sounding in the Bible
[25:19] but they're not for us he still but unto
[25:24] you that fear my name shall the Sun of
[25:27] righteousness arise with healing in his
[25:29] wings and he you shall go forth and grow
[25:32] up as calves of the stall and you shall
[25:34] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[25:36] as ashes under the soles of your feet in
[25:38] the day that I shall do this saith the
[25:40] Lord of hosts remember you the law of
[25:43] Moses my servant which I commanded under
[25:46] human orab for all Israel with the
[25:48] statutes and judgment behold I will send
[25:52] to you it lied to the Prophet what you
[25:56] to understand this scripture I'll send
[25:58] you who's he
[26:03] who's you it's me this is personal I was
[26:09] sharing with them an hour an hour city
[26:12] church and you you're welcome to look in
[26:14] my Bible but brother Mike I kind of
[26:16] scribbled out you and I wrote in over at
[26:19] the top of that cliff farmer because
[26:23] when I read my Bible it says I sin unto
[26:25] cliff Elijah the Prophet I you know what
[26:29] I don't know who all he sent him to but
[26:31] I know personally brother rich I know
[26:34] personally then he sent him to me I know
[26:37] when I heard water from the rock that
[26:39] was preached to me I know when I heard
[26:42] invisible Union of the bride that was
[26:44] preached to me so when I read this it
[26:46] says I'm sinning unto cliff I sinned
[26:50] this morning under brother Isaac Elijah
[26:53] the Prophet I send this morning to
[26:55] brother Adam Elijah the Prophet this has
[26:58] got to be a personal revelation
[27:01] I sent unto you Elijah the Prophet
[27:05] before the great before the coming of
[27:08] the Great and dreadful day of the Lord
[27:09] now what you notice something my name
[27:12] was in that scripture before the
[27:14] prophets was and he shall turn the heart
[27:20] of the father's to the children and the
[27:23] heart of the children to their fathers
[27:24] lest I come and smite the earth with a
[27:28] curse and you can be seated this morning
[27:30] I want to title this this morning the
[27:34] reason for Malachi 4 you know I was
[27:40] sharing what Isaiah said you know I feel
[27:41] like I'm going back now and going back
[27:44] over the things that we knew until you
[27:47] know we've almost forgot them but but I
[27:49] see something in this you know right now
[27:51] we're watching a following away people
[27:53] are leaving this message and but you
[27:55] know what so I'm going back and I'm
[27:57] looking at what is the absolute end and
[27:59] what was the purpose for Malachi 4 and
[28:02] so that that's just the things that are
[28:03] on my heart but you know I wanted to
[28:06] pick out something brother Branham he
[28:07] made a statement you know what is the
[28:10] attraction on the mountain he's reading
[28:12] this scripture Malachi chapter 4
[28:15] and this is the way that he reads it he
[28:17] says but unto you that fear my name
[28:19] shall the Sun of righteousness rise with
[28:22] healing campaigns instead of healing in
[28:26] his wings so when he says that he kind
[28:28] of chuckles and I thought you know
[28:30] that's funny because brother Branham
[28:32] knew what was going on and those other
[28:35] people thought well he just misstated it
[28:37] but as I looked at this I caught
[28:40] something very striking to me the
[28:43] scripture said he'll arise with healing
[28:46] not for healing the prophet of God did
[28:50] not come on the scene so we could talk
[28:52] about miracles that he had in his
[28:54] ministry as much as we loved those
[28:56] things as much as I appreciate the fact
[28:59] you know my dad was born crippled and
[29:01] was healed in the prophets meetings I
[29:03] love to be able to tell that story it's
[29:05] you know what's it's kind of a family
[29:07] heritage you know my my grandmother had
[29:10] female trouble and in spiritual food and
[29:12] due season 1965 she comes up before
[29:15] brother Branham and brother Branham says
[29:17] you've got female trouble he says but
[29:19] you're healed in the name of the Lord
[29:20] they told her she couldn't have any more
[29:23] children but 9 months and 15 days after
[29:26] that service my uncle was born hi but
[29:30] let me say this that's not what he come
[29:32] for he did not come to bring healing to
[29:36] my grandmother he did not come but it
[29:38] was an added benefit of the coming
[29:43] brother Branham says this isn't a prayer
[29:46] line he says how do you do we are
[29:48] strangers to each other
[29:50] I don't know you but Jesus Christ knows
[29:53] you do you believe that he is able to
[29:56] give me his spirit I want you to watch
[29:58] what he's asking his sister she's
[30:01] wanting prayer for healing and he's not
[30:04] going to address the healing now he's
[30:06] not going to ask her do you believe that
[30:07] God will heal you he's not gonna ask do
[30:09] you believe you know that the Lord can
[30:12] take the pain from you but to ask her he
[30:15] says do you believe he's able to give me
[30:17] his spirit our words I don't care if you
[30:22] think God's a healer right now what I
[30:24] want to know is do you believe that God
[30:27] can embody
[30:29] himself in a man this is the way this is
[30:33] the access to her healing he says which
[30:37] I'm not sufficient as a minister you
[30:39] know but by a gift that's promised in
[30:43] the last days watch what he's doing he's
[30:45] pointing her now to Malachi 4 to restore
[30:48] the faith of the children back to the
[30:52] father's I didn't read that verse 6 he
[30:57] shall turn the heart of the children I
[30:58] did read that I'm sorry but he says to
[31:01] restore the faith of the children back
[31:03] to the father's did you believe the hour
[31:06] has arrived for that and that that
[31:08] ministry is an operation in the church
[31:11] today
[31:11] now I'm thinking as me listening to this
[31:15] if I was her I would have wanted him to
[31:16] just say sister I'll pray for your
[31:18] healing but he wasn't there to pray for
[31:21] healing
[31:22] he was asking her do you believe that
[31:25] the ministry of Malachi 4 is in
[31:28] operation the hour has come and now it
[31:32] is because if you can understand that
[31:35] then you can see that healing is an
[31:38] added benefit the Prophet wasn't there
[31:40] for healing but if you could accept what
[31:42] the Ministry of the Malachi 4 was that
[31:46] healing was an added benefit he says you
[31:51] two you've come from Chicago cuz I see
[31:55] you going on a street looks like Clark
[31:57] Street to me that's right you suffer
[31:59] with arthritis different affliction in
[32:01] your body you can go back now your faith
[32:03] makes you whole it wasn't faith that God
[32:08] was a healer what's this he'd never
[32:11] asked do you believe God's a healer but
[32:13] the faith was do you believe that his
[32:16] spirit can end well in a body and do you
[32:19] believe that the ministry that's to turn
[32:22] the hearts of the children back to the
[32:25] father's is on the earth again and when
[32:28] she believed Malachi 4 was in operation
[32:32] healing came to her body I want to tell
[32:35] you that's why their sickness across the
[32:37] land today because the United States
[32:39] rejected the gift of Malachi 4 that was
[32:42] given
[32:43] that's the real reason why there are
[32:45] school shootings is because the gift of
[32:48] Malachi 4 was rejected the real reason
[32:51] that there's transgenders and
[32:52] homosexuals that and all this stuff
[32:54] going on is because the gift of Malachi
[32:57] 4 was not received but believing this
[33:03] gift brought healing to her body so I'm
[33:06] going to give you another quote I won't
[33:07] read the whole time but I just want to
[33:09] lay a foundation he says how many
[33:12] believes that in the resurrection you'll
[33:13] raise and have an immortal body divine
[33:17] healing is the down payment or the
[33:20] earnest money of your immortal body so
[33:25] when she accepted yes I believe that the
[33:29] ministry is only earth that's here to
[33:31] turn the heart of the children back to
[33:33] the father's when she caught the
[33:35] revelation it healed her body and
[33:38] brother Branham said that healing was
[33:40] the down payment God keeps his word
[33:43] brother Branham said so when she
[33:46] accepted the message the message and the
[33:49] messenger then she received the down
[33:51] payment which is saying you will receive
[33:55] a new body
[33:57] oh let me tell you something it's
[33:59] important that we accept this message
[34:01] it's important that we recognize who the
[34:04] messenger was I'm not stuck back on what
[34:07] it used to be but it's important to see
[34:10] this because I want to tell you
[34:12] something a lot of people are looking at
[34:14] Malachi 4 as a scripture of days gone by
[34:17] people are looking at Malachi 4 about a
[34:19] scripture that that talked about
[34:21] something that was but I want to tell
[34:22] you today Malachi 4 is fresh and new and
[34:25] alive today I'll tell you how it's alive
[34:30] today the other day I was I was sitting
[34:32] out I was worried about something I was
[34:34] praying about something and I was
[34:37] actually I was just I was battling some
[34:39] nervousness I was driving down the road
[34:41] and I had a tape going in my truck
[34:43] and I'll never forget I as I was driving
[34:47] down the road I just reached something I
[34:48] went like this and when I did brother
[34:50] branham said you young man scratching
[34:52] your nose
[34:55] listen the words alive he said do you
[34:59] believe God will take the nervousness
[35:00] from you oh let me tell you something so
[35:06] this now that was a few years ago but
[35:08] just about six months ago
[35:10] I was sitting in church on a Sunday
[35:11] morning I was just dealing with pain in
[35:13] my stomach and I didn't know what was
[35:14] causing and so my pastor asked me said
[35:16] do you think you could preach for us
[35:17] tonight I said I will and I went home
[35:19] and man I was just hurt hurting so I
[35:22] told my wife s I'm just gonna take a
[35:24] walk outside so I I was walking outside
[35:26] I was listening to a tape and I come and
[35:29] I went and I just set in my car for a
[35:30] minute I was sitting there and brother
[35:32] branham he starts to work the prayer
[35:34] line and all of a sudden I just felt the
[35:35] power come over me and I felt that
[35:38] presence and it just I thought man I'm
[35:41] fixing to rapture and about that time
[35:45] brother Branham says that's feeling that
[35:48] you're feeling he said that's the pillar
[35:50] of fire it's hanging right over you I
[35:53] begin to shout I begin to scream and I
[35:57] said oh my god what's going I just
[35:59] worship for a while and so I didn't hear
[36:03] what he said after that so I went back
[36:07] and I listened to it again this will
[36:09] blow your mind he when he said he said
[36:12] that pillar of fires hanging over you he
[36:14] said your stomach trouble is gone oh let
[36:18] me tell you the world is alive the word
[36:21] is fresh this is not a dead gospel it's
[36:24] an alive living breathing word but what
[36:32] this prophet came to do brother Graham
[36:35] tells us he came to tie up the loose
[36:37] ends he come to to bring the mystery of
[36:40] God and so we'll just read this I know
[36:42] it's familiar scripture revelation 10 7
[36:44] but in the days of the voice of the
[36:49] seventh angel we're still under the
[36:51] voice of the seventh angel I tell you a
[36:54] brother one time he eat not too long ago
[36:56] he was trying to promote playing tapes
[36:58] for service and he said we need brother
[37:01] Branham in the pulpit I said he never
[37:02] left ours
[37:04] we preached what the Prophet preached
[37:07] every Sunday every Wednesday the
[37:10] ministry of william branham has never
[37:12] left this pulpit so don't tell don't
[37:16] come tell me that he's gone go don't
[37:18] come tell me that though you know we got
[37:20] a movie on him no we're still there he
[37:26] said but in the days of the voice of the
[37:28] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[37:31] sound the mystery of God not mysteries
[37:37] the mystery of God should be finished
[37:42] now mysteries were finished but that was
[37:46] not what he come to do he come to bring
[37:50] the mystery and to bring an end to what
[37:55] everyone was wondering about the mystery
[37:58] of God should be finished as he hath
[38:00] declared to his servants the prophets I
[38:03] want you to to look at this now I was
[38:06] talking with someone the other day about
[38:07] how brother Branham said in one place he
[38:10] you know brother Branham I know he would
[38:12] change things as he preached and he
[38:14] would say you know I used to see it this
[38:15] way and now see it this way but then
[38:17] brother Branham would come back and he
[38:18] would say my doctrine never changed and
[38:21] someone was asking me the question I
[38:22] said well let me describe it like this
[38:25] because brother Branham said this he
[38:26] said my doctrines never changed it's
[38:28] always been Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus
[38:31] Christ the same yesterday today and
[38:32] forever and I said you know youyou
[38:34] understand as you come to know someone
[38:39] you find out more about him now so let
[38:43] me let me bring you the example like
[38:45] this brother I've known you for 10 years
[38:48] now right but all I knew was his name
[38:51] and I could have went all across the
[38:53] world saying I know this brother I know
[38:55] his name but then there come a point to
[38:59] where I spent the night in his home so I
[39:04] saw more of him and I learned more of
[39:07] him than I had before he didn't change
[39:10] and I didn't change but now if I was to
[39:14] talk to you about our brother I could
[39:16] say he lives in a white house
[39:18] it's a four-bedroom house what because I
[39:22] understand more about why because as I
[39:25] come to know him better there is a
[39:27] better relationship with him and now the
[39:31] things that were once mysteries now I
[39:34] know III didn't know his address now I
[39:38] knew I didn't know how many bedroom it
[39:40] sounds was now I know you see what I'm
[39:42] getting at so when the Prophet comes he
[39:44] is preaching Hebrews 13 and 8 but he's
[39:46] telling you about a Christ of 2000 years
[39:49] ago then he's telling you about a Christ
[39:51] of present today then he begins to show
[39:54] you how that Christ is going to act
[39:56] what operation he'll be in in the church
[40:00] so what was the mystery well we can go
[40:06] back to the beginning of time and we can
[40:08] see what the mystery was because after
[40:11] Adam and Eve were ran out of the Garden
[40:13] of Eden the mystery was no man could see
[40:15] God remember Moses Moses was speaking to
[40:19] him and he said Lord just show me your
[40:20] face Saturday night for you you can't
[40:24] see it Moses there's a bride coming the
[40:26] can but you can't see it
[40:28] Moses tried to bargain him with God you
[40:31] know he said Lord please just show me
[40:33] come on Lord you know let's make a deal
[40:35] and the Lord said I'll tell you what
[40:37] I'll do he said I'll show you my Honda
[40:39] parts but you can't see my face no man
[40:42] could even touch the mountain that God
[40:44] lived on but listen we're not going to a
[40:47] mountain now that God lived on we're not
[40:50] trying to touch a mountain what we come
[40:52] by revelation is to find out we are the
[40:54] mountain where God dwells he said that
[40:57] Mount Zion what is Mount Zion the
[40:59] prophet of God said that's the bride
[41:02] what is the mystery Tabernacle in the
[41:06] wilderness what wasn't really random
[41:07] said it was all types all these types
[41:11] were coming up and it was because God
[41:13] wanted to be seen but he couldn't he
[41:16] wanted to show himself brother but he
[41:18] couldn't show it because it wasn't time
[41:20] yet Romans chapter 16 chapter 6
[41:30] 25 it says now to him that is of power
[41:37] to establish you according to my gospel
[41:39] and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[41:42] according to the revelation of the
[41:44] mystery which was kept secret since the
[41:47] world begin now see we when we read
[41:51] scriptures like this sometimes it puts
[41:54] our head in a spin oh he's talking about
[41:59] the revelation of the mystery but you
[42:03] know what the mystery is finished if you
[42:08] hear a preacher trying to make a mystery
[42:09] he ain't seen it yet
[42:11] a brother said one time he endured a
[42:15] mystery preacher I said there are no
[42:16] mysteries let me tell you something if
[42:22] we preach a gospel so mysterious that
[42:25] the young people of the church cannot
[42:26] get it then we've missed it
[42:29] my goal for Adam my goal is to preach a
[42:33] gospel that the seven and eight year old
[42:36] children can understand this gospel my
[42:39] goal is to preach to where that young
[42:42] people at that age are coming to an
[42:44] altar and receiving the baptism of the
[42:46] Holy Ghost we preach it so over people's
[42:48] head sometimes
[42:49] so we're there thirty and forty years
[42:52] old before they even know what you're
[42:53] talking about but I prayed God give me a
[42:55] simple gospel he said the mystery which
[43:02] was kept secret since the world began
[43:04] but now is made manifest look they
[43:09] wanted to see it but they couldn't see
[43:12] it but Paul could Paul said it's now
[43:17] made manifest and by the scriptures of
[43:20] the prophets according to the
[43:22] commandment of the everlasting God made
[43:24] known to all nations for oh wait a
[43:30] minute he arose with healing in his
[43:32] wings not for healing right but there is
[43:36] scripture is saying the mystery come for
[43:39] something so now he's going to tell us
[43:41] what it's for for the obedience
[43:44] of faith brother I thought the mystery
[43:49] comes so we could argue a doctrine no I
[43:52] thought the mystery comes so we could
[43:54] have big name preachers and and talk
[43:56] about who's the greatest it no that was
[43:58] the problem
[43:59] back in Jesus day when everybody went to
[44:02] argue about who was the greatest and he
[44:03] said which one of you will be a servant
[44:06] which one of you will wash my feet they
[44:09] were here they were setting the
[44:11] preachers the top ten of that day the
[44:14] ones that preached all the meetings they
[44:16] they were sitting there arguing who's
[44:18] the best and Jesus is over there
[44:19] wrapping a towel around himself oh yeah
[44:24] you want to talk about who's the
[44:25] greatest who will humble himself made
[44:30] known to all nations for the obedience
[44:33] of faith the mystery come to calls and
[44:38] obedience to happen in your life one of
[44:42] the scriptures say he'll turn the heart
[44:44] back to the faith of the original
[44:48] fathers this scripture said the mystery
[44:51] was made known for the obedience of
[44:54] faith let me say this the church said I
[44:58] was raised up in I don't go there
[45:00] anymore
[45:00] we were taught obedience but it was by
[45:04] this you know they had the pastor had
[45:08] his thumb on you and he beat you to
[45:10] death we didn't know God love this let
[45:15] me tell you this a lot of young people
[45:18] around this message have walked away
[45:20] because they don't know God loved them
[45:22] now I'm not preaching a loose gospel I
[45:25] believe in living it as strict as you
[45:27] can live it but people present I was
[45:29] saying when I say yesterday preachers
[45:31] are not honest enough to present to the
[45:34] church we fail to deacons fail so
[45:39] leaders fail men husbands fail I don't
[45:43] care how great it this flesh is just
[45:46] dirt I don't care how prayed up you are
[45:51] I don't care how godly and how many
[45:53] tapes you listen to you still got a
[45:56] flesh that likes money
[45:58] you've still got a flesh that lusts
[46:00] pulls at you still got the flesh that
[46:02] will lie if you get in trouble you have
[46:05] a black dog that is fighting against the
[46:09] white dog and whoever you feed the most
[46:11] is who's gonna win that's what the
[46:15] prophet of God said yeah praise the Lord
[46:21] but the mystery comes to bring you into
[46:25] obedience you see under that ministry I
[46:30] tried being obedient I tried to quit
[46:33] lust but the mystery wasn't in here yet
[46:36] so it was all trying I tried to quit
[46:40] lying but I couldn't help it I tried to
[46:44] be a good kid but I couldn't help it I
[46:46] tried to not break the law but I
[46:48] couldn't help it because the mystery was
[46:51] not made known to me yet I did not
[46:54] understand yet what the mystery was and
[46:57] the mystery was not something that
[47:00] someone brought and laid out and you
[47:02] know a pie chart or not a pie chart but
[47:04] you know a chart on the wall and you
[47:07] know I heard a brother say he said the
[47:08] most anointed that people get around the
[47:10] message it seems like as you know you
[47:12] can tell by how many color pencils they
[47:14] got whatever they're at marking on the
[47:15] wall you know but when the mystery came
[47:22] to me was our pastor walked to the
[47:25] pulpit one Sunday and I was struggling I
[47:28] was struck I couldn't live it my
[47:30] marriage was a wreck my life was a wreck
[47:33] my finances was a wreck everything about
[47:36] me was a wreck and our pastor walked to
[47:39] the pulpit one Sunday morning he said
[47:40] the Lord's laid it on my heart to preach
[47:42] the adoption series and when he began to
[47:45] preach about the mystery of adoption I
[47:48] begin to hear my name called well Isaac
[47:52] I begin to hear that I was part of that
[47:55] adoption I begin to hear that I was one
[47:58] of those that was predestinated before
[48:00] the world began and when the revelation
[48:03] of the mystery came to me it caused an
[48:06] obedience to come in me because when I
[48:09] me when I was sealed into the
[48:11] kingdom then I was not trying to not
[48:14] less but because I love my father I did
[48:18] not want to us
[48:20] I did not want rap music anymore
[48:23] I didn't want the things of the world
[48:25] any longer because when he the Spirit of
[48:28] Truth came in here the mystery was over
[48:32] the mystery to me was mi son of God mi
[48:36] the Bride of Christ I don't know but
[48:38] when the mystery was settled I
[48:41] recognized this is for me and to live
[48:44] this I was predestinated to overcome to
[48:52] the obedience of faith you want to talk
[48:57] about obedience look at those men of old
[49:00] they would lay their head down on a
[49:02] chopping block for the gospel they would
[49:06] say take me now but brother branham said
[49:10] God don't want you to die for him now he
[49:12] wants you to live for him but how can
[49:15] you live for him you got to die you know
[49:20] our problem we got too much of the old
[49:22] man still living cliffs biggest problem
[49:26] is because cliff is still alive
[49:28] sometimes I'll just preach to me and
[49:31] then y'all can say man about it you know
[49:32] my biggest problem is me and when I get
[49:37] in the way what I want to do really
[49:39] hinders God sometimes I told somebody I
[49:43] said I think sometimes God six back sits
[49:45] back with his arms folded until I figure
[49:48] out I can't do it and then he goes on
[49:50] now you gonna let me have a shot you you
[49:53] gonna let me work on it now I'll tell
[49:58] you you got the scripture says you got
[50:00] to come as a child the other day I
[50:01] couldn't figure something out on my
[50:02] phone you know and my wife said why
[50:05] don't you just give it to your daughter
[50:06] and I said listen
[50:10] I said I got this
[50:15] and you know what they're coming point
[50:18] what I said and she figured that thing
[50:24] out for me you know but we get so caught
[50:26] up in me and and my Friday oh I can do
[50:30] this I can work it out alone you can't
[50:32] do it alone why do you think the
[50:35] scripture said confess your faults one
[50:38] to the other you need each other
[50:41] this church cannot exist one person on
[50:45] its own you've got to have each other
[50:47] you've gotta talk to one another you've
[50:49] gotta be like this it's gotta be a
[50:52] family you said well they don't
[50:56] understand me fellowship with them till
[50:58] they do I don't know why I'll leave that
[51:02] alone the mystery being made known
[51:07] brings obedience see the mystery don't
[51:13] just tell you what the seven seals is
[51:14] the mystery causes you to kick the TV
[51:17] out the mist well the mystery causes you
[51:23] to listen to the right kind of music and
[51:25] let me tell you something I'm just
[51:27] talking about rap I ain't just talking
[51:30] about rock now it causes you to listen
[51:33] to the right kind of so-called Christian
[51:35] music because let me tell you some of
[51:37] the same lyrics not lyrics but some of
[51:40] the same music in the so called gospel
[51:43] songs now let me tell you this there is
[51:47] a gospel recording artist that I just
[51:50] found this out Friday me and brother
[51:52] John I said are you kidding me man
[51:54] a gospel recording artist wanted one
[51:57] verse of their song to be a rap song not
[52:01] to be a rap song but one verse to be rap
[52:03] so they went and got a well-known
[52:06] prostitute rap artist woman to do a
[52:11] verse in the song and then we listened
[52:16] to that
[52:17] and we call it gospel and we worship and
[52:21] you don't know what you worshipping when
[52:24] you are worshiping a god under some
[52:27] woman with a spirit of a harlot upon her
[52:30] that is is rapping I said are you
[52:34] kidding me
[52:35] who who was thinking this who thought
[52:41] this was a good idea well praise the
[52:45] Lord I'm better I better get ready to
[52:46] fight yeah you know you can't eat or
[52:52] fight with a coat on so I thank you
[52:53] brother hey let me tell you something
[52:56] the young people of our church we don't
[52:58] even recognize sometimes why the spirits
[53:00] are so battling the minds of people but
[53:02] the prophet of God said that when a
[53:04] person sings their spirit goes out and
[53:09] when a rap artist is singing that spirit
[53:12] upon them is ministering to us when a
[53:15] man that is is singing and maybe it
[53:17] sounds good but he's got a lust spirit
[53:19] on it that lust is being ministered out
[53:21] that's why you should listen to message
[53:24] believers I'm gonna leave that alone
[53:29] Paul said Colossians 1:25 where of I am
[53:35] made a minister according to the
[53:37] dispensation of God which is given to me
[53:41] for you now look at this Paul the
[53:47] Apostle the Prophet the first
[53:52] church age messenger it's telling you
[53:54] this ain't given for me he gave me the
[53:58] word her name for me it's for you that's
[54:02] why you remember the prophet of God one
[54:04] time someone asked him they said brother
[54:06] Branham you remember II had the stomach
[54:08] sickness and he said they said brother
[54:10] Branham they said you you know you pray
[54:11] for people you pray for the dead they're
[54:13] raised up you pray for the crippled they
[54:14] walk the blind eyes are open and yet you
[54:17] got sickness he said it ain't for me
[54:19] remember Jesus when he was standing on
[54:21] the earth it said that a sound came from
[54:23] heaven avoid the voice of God spoke from
[54:25] heaven
[54:26] and Jesus said he said this voice came
[54:28] not for me but for your sake milah
[54:30] Branham knew he was he was bringing a
[54:32] message to call you to who you were
[54:37] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[54:41] the Word of God the scripture tells us
[54:45] that Jesus humbled himself to fulfill
[54:50] the Father's will it said that he made
[54:52] of himself no reputation oh let me tell
[54:56] you you that's the problem we want a
[54:58] reputation oh I want to be known as a
[55:00] singer I want to be known as the
[55:02] preacher of the message listen I don't
[55:03] need a reputation I want to humble
[55:06] myself to the Father's will when you
[55:11] share this we're here we look at things
[55:14] the wrong way can I want to share
[55:16] personal testimony with you there's a
[55:19] man in our area I walked into a
[55:21] McDonald's after church and and this man
[55:25] I've never seen him in my life he was
[55:26] brand new to the area he kind of high
[55:29] balled me up and down and he looked at
[55:31] my wife up and down he said brother I
[55:34] want you to come preach for me I said
[55:37] okay so I went down and I preached for
[55:40] him a little Pentecostal church
[55:41] and he said I want you to understand
[55:43] something when we got there I took my
[55:45] pastor with me he said I want y'all to
[55:47] know something he said I know the
[55:48] science says UPC but I ain't UPC he said
[55:51] I'm not part of a denomination I said
[55:55] well isn't this something now you know
[55:57] what this ain't gonna get me famous in
[55:59] the message for going to preaching to a
[56:00] Pentecostal Church but I wanted to
[56:03] humble myself to the father's will
[56:05] I preached there that night and when I
[56:08] got through the brother got it behind
[56:09] and he said I want to say something
[56:11] he said ministry like this he said was
[56:13] ministry like this he said and he told
[56:15] my pastor he said brother Morris he said
[56:17] any man in your church that ever has a
[56:19] message for my church the doors open
[56:22] we've been going back for the next eight
[56:25] months or so we and right now the door
[56:28] is wide open I was just there just a
[56:30] couple of months ago and preached again
[56:31] in the church and he got up and he said
[56:33] brother I want you to know something I
[56:34] love you and I trust you the man come
[56:41] down with stomach cancer and I found out
[56:43] this morning
[56:45] but they just put him in Hospice excuse
[56:50] me last night I found it out and I I
[56:52] thought why and it just come to me like
[56:56] this he had to have an opportunity he
[57:00] had to have the opportunity to accept
[57:02] this and let me tell you something I
[57:05] believe he did I believe that God gave
[57:09] him an opportunity before he left this
[57:11] earth and I said let me tell you so I
[57:14] told someone I told my wife I said if
[57:15] nothing else brother Branham said there
[57:18] would be people there simply because
[57:20] they were kind to the bride and I said
[57:22] that man loved our people
[57:24] he looked listen I don't know God's plan
[57:26] but I want to be humble enough that if
[57:29] he wants me to preach in a little
[57:31] Baptist Church on the corner or a little
[57:33] Pentecostal church it's not about Fame
[57:36] it's not about a name it's about
[57:39] humbling to the Father's will
[57:42] maybe the Father's will is for you to
[57:46] just be a housewife maybe the Father's
[57:48] will is for you to just be a godly
[57:51] mother
[57:51] maybe the Father's will is for your
[57:54] testimony when you walk through the mall
[57:56] to show someone the light of the hour
[57:59] just be humble it's given the
[58:08] me for you to fulfill the word of God
[58:14] somebody's got to fulfill the word
[58:17] there's a word promise for this
[58:19] generation
[58:20] somebody's got to fulfill it he said
[58:25] even the mystery which hath been hid
[58:28] from ages and from generations but now
[58:31] is made manifest oh this mystery
[58:34] remember the scripture said many kings
[58:35] and rich man desired to see this but you
[58:39] you were the elect he picked you
[58:43] I think about I think about when the
[58:47] Lord sent spies down to Jericho he
[58:49] didn't go to the mayor he he didn't go
[58:53] to up to the king he went to the lowdown
[58:58] to the prostitutes house I was telling
[59:02] what Isaiah yesterday I said you know I
[59:04] believe if we would have wrote the book
[59:06] of Joshua we would have wrote a
[59:07] different story
[59:08] if we were God we wouldn't have sent
[59:12] them to the prostitutes house but
[59:14] sometimes God wants you to get humble
[59:17] sometimes God wants to strip everything
[59:19] away from you until you know you are
[59:21] nothing I told the church back home I
[59:26] said if you want to sing good get up
[59:28] knowing you can't hello if you want to
[59:34] preach good get up knowing you can't if
[59:37] you want to live the message get up
[59:39] every day knowing you can't but if you
[59:42] can humble yourself he can even the
[59:50] mystery which has been here for ages and
[59:52] from generations is now made manifest to
[59:56] whom god would make known what is the
[59:58] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:00:02] among the gentiles which is christ in
[1:00:06] you well mark that was the whole mystery
[1:00:12] all along was that Christ was not going
[1:00:15] to be worshiped on a mountain Christ was
[1:00:19] not going to be worshipped hanging on a
[1:00:20] cross brother branham said
[1:00:22] 18:49 deity of Christ he said we're not
[1:00:25] worshipping Christ in a manger we're
[1:00:28] worshipping Christ in you
[1:00:30] we're not worshipping a god that we used
[1:00:33] to hear about we're not worshipping a
[1:00:35] god that that used to heal in the 60s
[1:00:38] when the Prophet was here but we're
[1:00:39] worshipping a fresh alive God because
[1:00:43] Christ is in his bride so I want to see
[1:00:49] God look around you know I told someone
[1:00:57] the other day and and don't think I've
[1:00:59] gone too far with this but I said what
[1:01:01] caused me to have the respect I do for
[1:01:03] my pastor is not his preaching it said I
[1:01:08] saw God in a man I saw grace in a man I
[1:01:13] didn't see a man that was ready to cut
[1:01:15] people's head off whenever they fail but
[1:01:17] I saw grace I saw look listen we are
[1:01:20] never I don't know why I'm getting on
[1:01:21] this again but we are never going to
[1:01:23] help anyone without love we never going
[1:01:28] to help anyone Paul said look if I know
[1:01:30] all mysteries I got all this revelation
[1:01:33] but I don't have love I don't have
[1:01:35] tyranny it's nothing
[1:01:37] he said it's as dung to me he said which
[1:01:43] is Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:01:46] I remember jesus said father glorify thy
[1:01:51] name and he said I have glorified it and
[1:01:54] I'll glorify it again well how is that
[1:01:56] glory gonna come he said the hope of
[1:01:58] glory is Christ in you brother the only
[1:02:05] hope of him being glorified again is for
[1:02:08] you to see the mystery that he's in you
[1:02:10] the only hope of him being glorified
[1:02:12] again is for you to recognize that it
[1:02:16] was not look at this brother branham now
[1:02:19] it's easier to see Christ here but what
[1:02:26] we reckon I
[1:02:27] is that there was a man born in 1909
[1:02:30] that was born by sex birth he said he
[1:02:36] had to hang across from his mirror
[1:02:38] listen I'm not talking bad about him I'm
[1:02:40] just talking Matt he was a flesh blood
[1:02:42] man he battled like we battle he had
[1:02:46] thoughts like we had thoughts and yet
[1:02:48] that man flesh body found a place that
[1:02:53] he could so move out of the way that
[1:02:56] another being could enter into his body
[1:02:58] and could open up the seven seals
[1:03:02] another being could enter into his body
[1:03:05] and tell you every address you ever
[1:03:07] lived at tell you what the color
[1:03:09] defenses around her house
[1:03:11] tell you what color the couch was and
[1:03:13] what what you did twenty years ago being
[1:03:16] a blessed man but the scripture was not
[1:03:20] to see Christ in the profit the hope of
[1:03:22] glory but there was to be a bride to
[1:03:27] come forth William Branham our prophet
[1:03:30] was a wave sheep he was the first one to
[1:03:32] come to maturity but the wave sheaf is
[1:03:35] only saying there's an entire crop
[1:03:37] coming after this that'll move forward
[1:03:41] in the same works Jesus it's a hill that
[1:03:44] believeth not the illness a prophet to
[1:03:46] he'll not believe it this morning if you
[1:03:48] believe you can do the greater works
[1:03:51] Christ in you if that man being a flesh
[1:03:56] and blood and bone man couldn't move
[1:04:00] that far out of the way then you know
[1:04:02] what it tells me I can't do if I can get
[1:04:06] this guy moved out of the way this guy
[1:04:10] my thoughts my wants my will if I can
[1:04:15] get my wheel out of the way he can do
[1:04:17] something if I can ever throw down every
[1:04:22] imagination that exalteth itself against
[1:04:24] God if I can cast down all those things
[1:04:28] he could step into this body the same
[1:04:30] way he stepped into that party I'll give
[1:04:34] you a quote for it
[1:04:35] brother Branham said now if there are
[1:04:38] some here who doesn't know him you're
[1:04:40] jobs are not right you're invited now to
[1:04:42] stand here in the presence of this
[1:04:44] audience the face of God
[1:04:49] can we read that again you're invited to
[1:04:53] stand in the presence of this audience
[1:04:56] the face of God
[1:05:01] the audience was the face of God he said
[1:05:07] he had been here from ages and
[1:05:08] generations but now I've made manifest
[1:05:10] Paul said we've seen him through a glass
[1:05:11] darkly but now we're face to face how am
[1:05:14] i face to face with Christ right here
[1:05:17] how are you face to face with Christ
[1:05:19] right here
[1:05:20] how are you face to face with Christ
[1:05:22] right here my god brother Branham said
[1:05:27] how is the Lord coming he said in his
[1:05:29] bride he said the Alpha was Jesus the
[1:05:34] Omega was the bride he said I'm the root
[1:05:38] I'm the offspring I'm the first on the
[1:05:39] last I'm the Alpha and the Omega and
[1:05:42] then brother Branham said now the Alpha
[1:05:44] has become the Omega Christ is still
[1:05:50] walking the earth in a 16 element body
[1:05:54] [Music]
[1:05:55] watch this when he was here he said I go
[1:05:58] away to prepare a place for you that
[1:06:00] where I am there you may be also
[1:06:05] right now we talked about that as going
[1:06:08] over there but he said that where I am
[1:06:11] you can be well where was he
[1:06:15] where was he he was walking on the earth
[1:06:19] in a 16 element body and every demon
[1:06:21] power was subject to his command and he
[1:06:23] said I'm preparing a place for you that
[1:06:25] where I'm at that's where you can be but
[1:06:29] I think he was preparing it to where
[1:06:31] that me and you in a flesh body could
[1:06:33] still overcome temptation we can still
[1:06:36] overcome depression we kill overcome
[1:06:38] cancer we can overcome every demon power
[1:06:41] of the devil in this generation
[1:06:45] the face of God I say I was I was seeing
[1:06:50] this at home and I didn't know we was
[1:06:52] gonna have communion but maybe this will
[1:06:56] be appropriate if you can take communion
[1:07:00] and recognize Christ in your brother
[1:07:04] it'll change the way you take communion
[1:07:06] I want to tell you to you like this if
[1:07:10] you can look down in that communion pan
[1:07:12] in that pan of water and you can see
[1:07:15] nail-scarred feet jesus said whatever
[1:07:20] you've done to the least of these you
[1:07:22] did it to me when you wash that brother
[1:07:25] or sister speak tonight I want you to
[1:07:28] look in that pan and I want you to see
[1:07:29] nail prints in those feet because you're
[1:07:32] not washing the feet of another human
[1:07:34] being but you're washing the feet of
[1:07:37] your Lord and Savior when their hands
[1:07:41] are washed in your feet I want you to
[1:07:42] look in that pan and see nail scarred
[1:07:44] hands brother sister we can recognize
[1:07:47] Christ is in our brothers he's in our
[1:07:50] sisters Christ is in the church this
[1:07:53] morning in a broad body when you look at
[1:07:59] your brother and sister you'll see them
[1:08:00] different why let me tell you something
[1:08:03] you couldn't hold a grudge against Jesus
[1:08:05] you couldn't gossip about Jesus and if
[1:08:10] we ever saw our brother and sister as
[1:08:12] Jesus or what a change in make so the
[1:08:20] mystery unveiled was that it brought her
[1:08:23] an invisible God back to visible a God
[1:08:28] that couldn't be seen now can't be
[1:08:31] unseen but the scripture said that he
[1:08:36] came to turn our heart back to the faith
[1:08:39] this is the reason turn our heart back
[1:08:43] to the faith of the Apostolic fathers so
[1:08:45] let me ask you this if I'm gonna be what
[1:08:49] the Apostolic father's fathers were then
[1:08:51] I need to be looking at what the
[1:08:52] Apostolic fathers did and I'm gonna know
[1:08:55] what I'm supposed to be
[1:08:57] well let me tell you what the Apostolic
[1:08:59] father's done they walk by the gate
[1:09:01] beautiful and there was a man laying
[1:09:03] there asking of alms and they didn't
[1:09:07] have a prayer meeting they operated the
[1:09:10] third pool Paul walked by and he said
[1:09:12] such as I have I give to the rise and
[1:09:15] walk and the man rose up immediately and
[1:09:18] walk what was he doing he was walking
[1:09:19] forth
[1:09:20] Paul in Hebrews 13 and 8 he said Jesus
[1:09:23] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:09:24] forever Jesus of yesterday walked by the
[1:09:27] lame and they walked and Paul was saying
[1:09:29] he's still the same today and I'm
[1:09:31] walking by the lame and they walk but
[1:09:33] listen somebody's got to be the Jesus
[1:09:35] forever and I choose to rika to
[1:09:38] recognize I am the Jesus of forever
[1:09:42] I don't walk by the lemon they'll walk
[1:09:44] again I'll walk by the dead and they'll
[1:09:46] race again I won't buy the bond and
[1:09:49] their eyes will be open again oh my god
[1:09:57] I know I told the testimony here many
[1:10:01] years ago but I was in Nicaraguan I was
[1:10:03] preaching on the spoken word and I got
[1:10:06] to the end of my message and they wanted
[1:10:08] to have a prayer line you go overseas
[1:10:09] you gonna pray for everybody in the
[1:10:10] church and I thought God I ain't I ain't
[1:10:13] got enough strength pray for all these
[1:10:14] people so I said we're just gonna pray
[1:10:17] one prayer over everybody I said
[1:10:19] everybody come out and we don't pray one
[1:10:20] prayer and the power of God dropped down
[1:10:23] in that room and I didn't pray but
[1:10:25] sister Ruby I prophesied and I said thus
[1:10:29] saith the Lord receive you the Holy
[1:10:32] Ghost and I watched 40 people fall in
[1:10:37] the floor screaming speaking out crying
[1:10:40] running around the building listen we
[1:10:43] are we're waiting on something to happen
[1:10:45] that is happening now a brother said to
[1:10:51] me the other nation I believe pretty
[1:10:52] soon we're going to start seeing that
[1:10:55] short and powerful demonstration I said
[1:10:57] brother I am the short and powerful
[1:10:59] demonstration oh pretty soon we're going
[1:11:03] to see the works being made manifest I
[1:11:05] am no works being late manifest oh
[1:11:07] pretty soon we're going to see the
[1:11:09] coming of the Lord
[1:11:10] I am NOT coming of all he's in his bride
[1:11:19] man brother branham said I'm gonna try
[1:11:24] to close what time is it they know Clark
[1:11:27] know where brother branham said then the
[1:11:33] works that the Holy Spirit is doing
[1:11:35] today by these visions never failing
[1:11:37] promises never failing all the Apostolic
[1:11:41] signs promised in the Bible of Malachi 4
[1:11:43] and old revelation 10 7 I like I said
[1:11:46] that he said oh-ho-ho Malachi 4 and old
[1:11:50] revelation 10 7 all that of that is
[1:11:53] being fulfilled and proved by science
[1:11:57] and every other way and if I haven't
[1:11:58] told you the truth these things would
[1:12:00] not happen but if I have told you the
[1:12:02] truth they bear record that I've told
[1:12:04] you the truth he's still the same
[1:12:06] yesterday today and forever I want you
[1:12:11] to listen to this the manifestation of
[1:12:13] his Spirit is catching away a bride now
[1:12:18] we've said for years we're already in
[1:12:20] the rapture but what puts you there the
[1:12:23] revelation of the mystery what he come
[1:12:27] to do was call you into a rapture and in
[1:12:30] that rapture you can do the greater
[1:12:32] works you don't have to wait for a
[1:12:34] preacher to come preach a revival for
[1:12:36] you to have greater works you don't have
[1:12:38] to wait on some some big name or you
[1:12:40] don't have to wait to go to a camp
[1:12:42] meeting the greater works is you in your
[1:12:44] prayer closet alone with God getting to
[1:12:47] the police to where he speaks through
[1:12:49] your lips he said the manifestation of
[1:12:54] his Spirit is catching away a bride he
[1:12:56] said let that faith revelation fall into
[1:12:59] your heart that this is the hour
[1:13:04] don't push it away it's something coming
[1:13:06] it's now the hours now I was reading the
[1:13:10] other day in the book of Judges that
[1:13:11] Deborah got up one morning and I forget
[1:13:13] the dinner but she went home she said
[1:13:15] get up for this is the day the Lord will
[1:13:16] deliver the enemy in our hands they had
[1:13:18] looked forward to it they had prayed
[1:13:20] about it but there came a day that that
[1:13:22] woman went over and she said listen
[1:13:23] there
[1:13:24] I'm praying about it there ain't no more
[1:13:25] looking forward to it it's now listen we
[1:13:29] keep pushing away I'll put it to you
[1:13:31] like this you ever seen a child like
[1:13:33] they have a little ball on the floor and
[1:13:34] they try to grab it and they push it
[1:13:35] away from them and they just keep
[1:13:37] chasing it around the room when if they
[1:13:38] would ever just grab ahold if there's
[1:13:40] and we keep slapping at this thing like
[1:13:43] one of these days one of these days
[1:13:45] today's the day hey man would you stand
[1:13:49] your feet with me the reason for Malachi
[1:13:55] 4 he said the manifestation of his
[1:13:59] spirit he's catching you away you know
[1:14:04] we've got a biology teacher a professor
[1:14:07] that goes to church with us and I asked
[1:14:11] the church the other day I said how
[1:14:13] smart do you think it would be of me to
[1:14:15] go sit in his class and when he
[1:14:18] describes the human body that I would
[1:14:20] say I don't think you said that right
[1:14:24] that would show my ignorance because he
[1:14:29] is the authority on the subject and you
[1:14:33] know when I see that this message is
[1:14:35] what's going to rapture me out how in
[1:14:39] the world could I ever stand and say
[1:14:41] well the Prophet was wrong there now let
[1:14:44] me tell you something when you recognize
[1:14:45] what that message came to do it came to
[1:14:48] right let me tell you something I was
[1:14:50] hearing with the church in our city
[1:14:51] brother Branham said in 1965 he said now
[1:14:54] the he said science says the earth is
[1:14:56] round he said but they just found out
[1:14:57] it's square he said even the Bible says
[1:14:59] the four corners of the earth I told the
[1:15:02] church has let me tell you something I
[1:15:03] don't care
[1:15:04] he is scientifically wrong well y'all
[1:15:10] look at me funny now but you know what I
[1:15:14] never did believe the message by
[1:15:15] scientific proof I believed it by
[1:15:17] revelation and I said I don't care you
[1:15:20] call me crazy if the man that preached
[1:15:22] the message that's going to rapture me
[1:15:24] out set it Square it's square
[1:15:26] I believe it sister I don't care what
[1:15:30] anybody thinks call me a fanatic call me
[1:15:33] crazy I want to be crazy
[1:15:36] you said cliff you lose
[1:15:38] your mind Paul told me to he said let
[1:15:41] this mind be and you get out of your
[1:15:43] mind let this mind in you that was in
[1:15:46] Christ Jesus that thought it not Robert
[1:15:48] he be equal it wasn't robbery to be
[1:15:51] equal he said I want you to think like
[1:15:53] this Isaac it's not robbery you're equal
[1:15:54] I want to share with you just before I
[1:16:00] turn it back over the eysie I want to
[1:16:01] share with you a dream that I had the
[1:16:02] other day I was it was a very short
[1:16:07] dream but I was uh I was I was somewhere
[1:16:11] and I still don't know where I was at
[1:16:13] but it was a very small group of people
[1:16:14] and I saw brother branham and I thought
[1:16:18] man I got to go I got to go shake that
[1:16:20] guy's hand you know some running and I'm
[1:16:22] waiting for my turn you know and so when
[1:16:24] I finally get up to him I just grabbed
[1:16:27] him and hugged him and I'll never forget
[1:16:30] I just laid I laid my head over on him
[1:16:32] and I said brother bite him I want you
[1:16:33] to know that I love you and the dream
[1:16:38] was over and I I was awake and I was
[1:16:41] like I want to go back I got some
[1:16:45] questions for him Eileen and I I mean
[1:16:47] I'm trying you know how you force
[1:16:48] yourself to go back to sleep I'm like
[1:16:49] come on come on come on go back to sleep
[1:16:51] go back so the next day I was just it
[1:16:55] was going over my mind what is this got
[1:16:57] to do with anything
[1:16:59] and I heard the prophet of God say on
[1:17:01] the tape he said the message and the
[1:17:03] messenger are one and I said well what's
[1:17:08] that got to do with anything and the
[1:17:09] Lord just spoke to my heart and said you
[1:17:11] have embraced this message and as I
[1:17:16] begin to think about that I said wait a
[1:17:17] minute
[1:17:18] what would be greater to hug the man or
[1:17:22] to embrace the message that he brought
[1:17:24] but Mike there was many people that
[1:17:26] embraced the man William Branham and
[1:17:28] turned and went right back to sin many
[1:17:30] people were raised up people raised from
[1:17:32] the dead people raised out of
[1:17:33] wheelchairs and they went right back to
[1:17:35] their denominations but the Lord was
[1:17:36] showing me like never before I am
[1:17:38] embracing this message embracing this
[1:17:42] message does what he said it'll catch
[1:17:45] you away you want a body change embrace
