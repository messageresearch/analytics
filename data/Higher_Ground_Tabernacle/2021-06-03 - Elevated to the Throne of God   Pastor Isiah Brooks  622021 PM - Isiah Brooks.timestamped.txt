[40:31] we're going to ask that you turn with us
[40:32] to
[40:35] excuse me i tell you what let's start
[40:39] with
[40:40] the scriptures that we were working with
[40:43] on the last message because i want to
[40:45] kind of tie this in
[40:50] let's go to isaiah
[40:57] 43.
[41:05] should regardless good in this place
[41:10] we're looking at a time where
[41:16] god is getting ready to do some greater
[41:18] things
[41:22] let's start by god's grace i'm just
[41:25] going to start up here
[41:26] at the first verse
[41:37] but now thus said the lord that created
[41:40] thee o jacob
[41:42] and he that formed thee o israel fear
[41:45] not
[41:46] for i have redeemed thee i have called
[41:49] thee
[41:49] by name thou art mine
[41:53] when thou passes through the waters i
[41:56] will be with thee
[41:58] and though the rivers and through the
[42:00] rivers
[42:02] they shall not overflow thee
[42:05] when thou walketh through the fire thou
[42:08] shall not be burned
[42:10] neither shall the flame kindle a pundi
[42:15] for i am the lord thy god the holy one
[42:18] of israel
[42:19] thy savior i gave egypt for thy ransom
[42:24] ethiopia and zebra for thee
[42:27] since thou was precious in my sight
[42:30] thou has been honorable and i have loved
[42:33] thee therefore
[42:34] i will give men for thee and thy
[42:38] and people for thy life fear not
[42:41] for i am with thee i will bring thy seed
[42:44] from the east
[42:45] and gather thee from the west i will say
[42:48] to the north give up
[42:49] unto the south keep not back bring my
[42:52] sons from afar
[42:53] my daughters from the ends of the earth
[42:57] even everyone that is called by my name
[43:00] for i have created him for my glory i
[43:03] have
[43:04] formed him yea i have made
[43:07] him one more scripture please
[43:12] we ask that you turn with us to
[43:14] revelations
[43:17] the third chapter
[43:26] revelations third chapter
[43:34] you love the lord we ask that you turn
[43:38] with us to the 20th verse
[43:50] i'm sorry
[43:54] behold i stand at the door
[43:57] and knock if any man hear my voice
[44:02] and open the door i will come in to him
[44:06] and i will suck with him and he with me
[44:10] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[44:12] sit with me
[44:13] in my throne even as i
[44:16] also overcame and have sat down with my
[44:20] father
[44:21] in his throne he that have an ear
[44:24] let him hear what the spirit saith
[44:27] unto the church is let us pray
[44:31] father god we come before you lord we
[44:34] thank you for your grace and your mercy
[44:37] lord we realize lord that there is
[44:38] nothing that we can say or do
[44:41] oh god it's all about you so we're
[44:44] asking tonight lord that you forgive us
[44:47] of our sin cleanse us from all of our
[44:50] unrighteousness lord and
[44:52] we pray that you'll speak through this
[44:53] earth and vessel
[44:55] lord give us ears to hear in our heart
[44:58] to receive
[44:59] lord give us a place o god in your
[45:03] kingdom to grow and mature
[45:05] oh god to the perfect statue of christ
[45:08] bless us lord because we know it's not
[45:10] him that willeth
[45:12] nor he that runeth but you lord jesus
[45:15] who shows
[45:16] us the mercy give us the mercy and grace
[45:18] that we need
[45:20] to be perfect in that sight in jesus
[45:23] christ's name we pray
[45:25] amen you may be seated
[45:32] one of the scriptures that i really
[45:34] wanted to get to and i'm not gonna
[45:36] uh i'll just verbalize it
[45:41] when god called john in the book of
[45:45] revelation and you heard me say this
[45:46] many times he says
[45:48] come up hither and the bible said that
[45:52] john was
[45:53] in the spirit on the lord's day
[45:57] so we understand according to brother
[45:59] branham that john represents and types
[46:01] out the bride
[46:04] and john couldn't get the revelation
[46:06] that he needed standing earthly
[46:09] he had to be in the spirit
[46:12] so is it with this message we have come
[46:15] a long way we've seen some stand
[46:19] we've seen some fall we've seen some
[46:22] come and we've seen some go
[46:24] and we've seen sun some return
[46:28] but at the end of the day god has never
[46:31] lost
[46:32] one we entitled this message
[46:36] when we first started the destiny of
[46:39] god's will
[46:41] and it's amazing uh how and testament
[46:45] it's amazing how brother uh orlando was
[46:48] just kind of
[46:50] tapping into thoughts and things that we
[46:53] have ministered
[46:55] because you know we know what a
[46:56] testament is the testator has to die
[47:01] but we must understand by god's grace in
[47:03] order for us to have
[47:05] what the bible calls a testimony
[47:09] we not only should be test tested
[47:12] but we in the trial that we go through
[47:15] we must die
[47:17] in order to live and so we
[47:20] we we want to kind of tie this in
[47:22] because like i said this
[47:24] bible this book is like god's uh
[47:26] redemption diary
[47:28] and in this book it tells all of the
[47:31] events that
[47:33] he has done and wanted to be recorded
[47:38] because there were a lot of things that
[47:40] were done and not yet recorded
[47:43] even in the new testament we find out
[47:45] that he said that
[47:46] they said that if everything had been
[47:49] recorded there would not be enough books
[47:52] to put those things in and of course you
[47:55] know our prophet he came and he
[47:58] he said that in his ministry which is
[48:00] christ's ministry he did
[48:02] more things than what jesus did at least
[48:06] things that are recorded
[48:08] so we we look at this thing and we we
[48:10] wonder what god is doing
[48:13] as i said by god's grace
[48:17] that this is a destiny
[48:20] you know it's a journey there is a point
[48:24] of ending but our ending is just only
[48:27] the beginning
[48:29] of what we call eternity
[48:32] and it's not him that willeth nor he
[48:34] that run it but it's god
[48:36] who shows the mercy and the grace of god
[48:39] as we were saying we have come through
[48:42] uh justification sanctification baptism
[48:45] of the holy ghost
[48:46] and now we've come to a time
[48:50] where uh the person of christ
[48:54] is supposed to be seen we've come
[48:57] through the jumping we come through the
[48:58] shouting we've come through the speaking
[49:00] in tongues and
[49:01] all of those things are good but none of
[49:04] that can guarantee you
[49:06] heaven you can do all of that you can be
[49:09] as religious as religion can be
[49:13] but it's not based upon those things
[49:15] everything we do
[49:18] has already been decided and god by way
[49:22] of his foreknowledge
[49:24] knew every decision we would make
[49:27] and at the end of the day it boils down
[49:31] to the
[49:32] place where god has chosen you
[49:36] and elected to you to be bribed
[49:39] you can't work your way into it you
[49:42] can't fast your way into
[49:44] it you can be the most like i said the
[49:46] most religious person
[49:47] in the message and it still doesn't
[49:50] guarantee you
[49:52] we have heard the prophet of god say
[49:53] many things
[49:55] and one of the things that he said you
[49:57] can have the holy ghost
[49:59] all of your life and still be lost
[50:04] but he's not talking about your soul
[50:07] he's working with the spirit man because
[50:10] the holy spirit can work on your spirit
[50:14] use you and yet you haven't been
[50:18] converted
[50:19] and you say well prove that to me peter
[50:23] james john and all of the disciples
[50:27] were sanctified they cast out devils in
[50:30] in the name of the lord they saw
[50:33] miracles
[50:35] and yet they were not converted
[50:38] and god told peter peter when you are
[50:41] converted
[50:42] strengthen your brethren see conversion
[50:45] is something
[50:46] you can't do only god can do that
[50:51] but i want to read a quote here coming
[50:54] from
[50:54] the mighty god unveil and brother battle
[50:58] said and that's
[50:59] what's the matter today my lutheran
[51:02] brothers
[51:03] my baptist brethren my pentecostal
[51:06] brethren
[51:07] and all of my brethren of different
[51:09] denominations
[51:11] that's what it is see you're trying to
[51:14] give
[51:15] a note hit back in the days
[51:19] of luther wesley like the like when
[51:23] uh you know the actually the music sheet
[51:26] here shows that it's another day
[51:30] and that is the problem with a lot of
[51:33] the people around the message
[51:36] now i understand you understand me if
[51:39] you ordained to make the rapture
[51:41] it is god's duty to reveal it to you
[51:46] because he said it is given unto you
[51:49] to know the mysteries you didn't earn it
[51:52] it's given to you when peter received
[51:56] the
[51:56] revelation of who jesus christ was all
[51:59] of them
[52:01] at that point in time did not know
[52:04] but peter voiced it because the lord
[52:06] knew
[52:07] peter had it and he said unto peter
[52:10] flesh and blood
[52:12] did not reveal this unto you but my
[52:15] father which is in heaven
[52:17] and upon this rock this revelation
[52:20] of who jesus is i build my church
[52:25] see that's deep that's really something
[52:28] that
[52:29] a lot of people think well you know it
[52:31] was a revelation given to peter but
[52:33] everybody in that in
[52:36] all the disciples had to come to know
[52:39] who jesus
[52:40] was right because they had a commission
[52:44] go ye therefore and baptize all in the
[52:46] name of the father and of the son and of
[52:48] the holy ghost they had to know
[52:50] who jesus was in order to fulfill the
[52:53] scripture
[52:54] according to acts 2 38 they had to know
[52:58] that this wasn't a trinity this wasn't a
[53:00] duet or a dual thing
[53:02] this was one god in your faith
[53:05] manifested himself in three different
[53:08] attributes he was the father in creation
[53:12] the son in redemption and the holy ghost
[53:14] in the
[53:15] world today now i'm saying let me move
[53:18] on see
[53:19] he said we can't live in the light of
[53:21] luther
[53:22] he was a forerunner we appreciate his
[53:25] part
[53:26] but we played that out
[53:29] we're way over here and this is the
[53:32] point i wanted to say
[53:33] in the back of the book
[53:40] we're in the back of the book all of
[53:43] those
[53:43] other things they're all good they
[53:45] played a part in the music sheet
[53:49] but now we're coming to the end of the
[53:51] sheet
[53:52] we're coming to the finale you know i
[53:55] love the way those musicians would do
[53:57] they'll play that music all the way in
[53:59] to the end and then after at the end
[54:01] they give that little final drama
[54:03] zoom i like that
[54:07] and we know that when he gives that
[54:09] final
[54:10] that those are cards
[54:13] that final card is the end
[54:18] and you understand that's the end
[54:21] it is at that time people began to
[54:25] applaud
[54:26] somehow it seems like that final in
[54:30] gets more applause than all of the other
[54:33] works
[54:36] because that musician is saying i have
[54:39] come you have heard
[54:40] you've been it's been wonderful to you
[54:42] but now this is the end
[54:44] room and that's what god is saying
[54:49] understand that last chord is the
[54:51] important chord
[54:53] it's the finishing chord hallelujah and
[54:56] that is what the pride is she is that
[54:59] finishing card
[55:01] hallelujah she emphasized that
[55:05] everything was complete and in order
[55:09] now we're in the back of the book so
[55:12] therefore there must be something
[55:14] greater remember i told you that being
[55:17] born
[55:18] of god it's very important
[55:21] we can't allow ourselves to be pulled
[55:24] into a system
[55:25] because it is the system that deceives
[55:29] cain was a system of worship
[55:33] abel was worshipped
[55:36] you understand me let me say it again
[55:39] cain
[55:39] had a system of worship but
[55:43] abel was worshiped
[55:46] it wasn't a system so you can understand
[55:50] one was a sheep and the other one was a
[55:53] goat
[55:54] and the goat was trying to impersonate
[55:57] the sheep
[55:59] but the sheep didn't have to do an
[56:00] impersonation
[56:02] the sheep itself was the person
[56:06] hallelujah and remember as i said in the
[56:09] last message
[56:10] or two that god could not give abel
[56:14] the birthright even though he was the
[56:17] firstborn
[56:18] but he was not the first born of adam
[56:21] and this is why
[56:22] cain got angry at abel
[56:25] because he realized that he could not
[56:28] inherit
[56:30] he wasn't a part of the original
[56:32] bloodline
[56:33] so he could not inherit what belonged
[56:36] unto abel you understand me so
[56:40] you can understand what i'm saying think
[56:42] about it
[56:44] jesus when he was on earth
[56:47] they hated him they were jealous of him
[56:51] because he was not impersonating
[56:54] he was the real life and that life
[56:58] produced the supernatural it was his it
[57:01] was his
[57:03] he didn't have to muster it up all he
[57:05] had to do was yield to the anointing
[57:09] those who were impersonating
[57:12] may have looked more righteous than he
[57:16] the system always looked better they
[57:19] perfect
[57:20] the system they perfected so much
[57:23] until it literally looked like the real
[57:26] thing
[57:27] the difference is the life versus the
[57:30] imitation of life
[57:33] and we realized by god's grace amen that
[57:35] here it was the life of christ
[57:37] that was on display and jesus himself
[57:41] said it's not me i'm just a reflection
[57:44] of the one that's greater than i
[57:46] am and i can't do nothing except i see
[57:49] the father doing it then jesus said
[57:53] also he said if you're not born again if
[57:56] you're not spiritual
[57:57] you can't even perceive the kingdom of
[57:59] god so we find out that jesus
[58:02] had a a complete connection
[58:05] with the unseen uh dimension
[58:08] of god hallelujah you don't believe it
[58:12] he did so much so when they crucified
[58:16] him
[58:16] he said my god my god why has thou
[58:19] forsaken me
[58:20] and brother branham said it was at that
[58:22] time during that time of the crucifixion
[58:25] that jesus christ had never been
[58:26] separated from his father
[58:29] amen he went to calvary as a man
[58:33] he suffered as a man he felt
[58:36] disconnected as a man
[58:38] y'all understand me so but it was god
[58:42] moving this man into a position
[58:45] so that we could be redeemed hallelujah
[58:49] and why would we need redeeming because
[58:52] the bloodline had been defiled
[58:57] hallelujah and god needed a perfect
[58:59] blood
[59:00] adam mess it up but god needed a perfect
[59:04] blood
[59:04] and that perfect blood could only come
[59:06] through jesus christ
[59:08] fallen man that's what we were
[59:13] fallen man and i showed by the
[59:17] the the other uh this age is different
[59:22] it's different it's not uh it consists
[59:25] of two kind of
[59:27] you know kind of intertwined but but you
[59:29] you you've got an enoch and a and a noah
[59:32] kind of you know you know connected so
[59:35] much so that
[59:36] you you got a foolish version and a wise
[59:39] version
[59:40] but the you got to understand that the
[59:42] foolish version
[59:43] had a different covenant than the wise
[59:46] the wise virgin had an unconditional
[59:49] covenant
[59:50] hallelujah and they followed the leading
[59:53] of the holy spirit
[59:54] the foolish virgin did not have
[59:57] that oil to sustain them
[1:00:01] and to carry them all the way through so
[1:00:04] they had a covenant which
[1:00:05] you got to understand if you don't have
[1:00:07] the grace of god the only thing left is
[1:00:09] law
[1:00:11] and the bible see because they were
[1:00:13] virgins they lived it but they lived it
[1:00:15] according to the law
[1:00:17] and not according to the spirit even
[1:00:20] though because there was a time
[1:00:21] they did have the spirit but understand
[1:00:24] it they ran
[1:00:25] out of oil and what would make you run
[1:00:29] out of oil
[1:00:30] is when you don't know how to get
[1:00:33] refilled
[1:00:36] right you don't know how to get refilled
[1:00:38] because
[1:00:39] the the the age of change
[1:00:42] the dispensation pretty much like i said
[1:00:44] let's leave it like that
[1:00:45] the age have changed it's changed
[1:00:49] from laodicea to the bride age
[1:00:52] and the one who could you could buy the
[1:00:54] oil from it's no longer present
[1:00:57] you can't get it you see because without
[1:01:01] william branham
[1:01:02] we would not have had the oil and the
[1:01:03] extra oil
[1:01:05] that represented the stimulation of the
[1:01:07] revelation of the word
[1:01:09] it was the light that was going to carry
[1:01:11] us to
[1:01:12] our destination hallelujah i love this
[1:01:16] because let me say it like this let's
[1:01:18] take a worm
[1:01:20] that would soon be a butterfly the life
[1:01:22] is already in the worm
[1:01:24] hallelujah there's nothing he needs to
[1:01:26] do other than be a worm
[1:01:29] it is the life that changes him you we
[1:01:32] don't do it
[1:01:33] it's the life in us that changes us from
[1:01:36] glory to glory
[1:01:38] to glory to glory hallelujah amen enough
[1:01:41] walk with god understand
[1:01:43] walking with god is walking with the
[1:01:44] word walking with god is walking with
[1:01:46] the anointing
[1:01:47] walking with god is also walking with
[1:01:50] the inside
[1:01:51] of the word the revelation
[1:01:55] of the word and when you walk with that
[1:01:57] you can't help but to have
[1:01:59] an ascension
[1:02:03] is that right because you understand the
[1:02:05] ascension
[1:02:06] is that act of rising to an important or
[1:02:09] higher
[1:02:10] level like for example
[1:02:13] christ ascended right
[1:02:17] and when he ascended he said well what
[1:02:19] do you mean
[1:02:20] enoch ascended hallelujah
[1:02:24] moses ascended yes
[1:02:28] if he didn't they couldn't find his body
[1:02:30] brother brown said he typed out the
[1:02:32] resurrection
[1:02:33] the resurrection the dead saint that
[1:02:35] will be resurrected
[1:02:37] and when they were they were resurrected
[1:02:39] were they did they accept i said yes sir
[1:02:42] they did
[1:02:43] hallelujah they went into a different
[1:02:45] place a different place other than
[1:02:47] paradise
[1:02:49] because paradise was emptied out but we
[1:02:52] went into that
[1:02:53] what we call now the sixth dimension
[1:02:56] that dimension underneath the altar
[1:02:59] that plays that that william branham was
[1:03:01] ascended to
[1:03:02] right in there amen he was in a place
[1:03:07] and we don't fully understand it but he
[1:03:10] was in a place
[1:03:11] he saw his dog he saw his horse
[1:03:14] he saw a mansion he saw his wife
[1:03:18] he saw his daughter you see what i'm
[1:03:20] saying amen
[1:03:22] but that was a place he said i didn't
[1:03:24] call it heaven
[1:03:25] i just told you it was there you didn't
[1:03:28] know it was that but i was there
[1:03:30] and you know you got to understand that
[1:03:32] these things these dimensions
[1:03:34] that that just far beyond anything we
[1:03:37] can imagine
[1:03:38] because all we know is just these little
[1:03:40] three things
[1:03:42] right we just know this dimension feel
[1:03:44] and touch and taste and
[1:03:46] you know what we see and all that stuff
[1:03:48] but it's beyond
[1:03:49] that amen so you what are you saying
[1:03:53] it was a preview a prelude amen
[1:03:57] of of of where we're going he said when
[1:04:00] i
[1:04:00] saw those millions they were running and
[1:04:03] hugging me and said oh
[1:04:04] that precious brother why are you
[1:04:05] preaching this that's
[1:04:07] our destiny that's where we are going
[1:04:11] hallelujah and when you have heard this
[1:04:14] message you've literally heard
[1:04:16] from your theophany it is a vindication
[1:04:19] that you're not only here but you're
[1:04:21] there
[1:04:22] hallelujah i love that because you know
[1:04:25] einstein he came up to that theory
[1:04:27] a real relativity where you could be in
[1:04:30] one place
[1:04:31] and then be in another place but he got
[1:04:34] it from jesus
[1:04:35] the bible said jesus said tell me
[1:04:38] how can the son of man be standing here
[1:04:41] and standing in heaven at the same time
[1:04:43] hallelujah he was trying to tell him
[1:04:46] this is not
[1:04:46] the only place you're being reflected
[1:04:49] there's a reflection a higher influx of
[1:04:51] reflection
[1:04:52] over there hallelujah i just believe
[1:04:55] that when you're in the spirit
[1:04:57] of god you're literally fellowshipping
[1:04:59] with your theophany
[1:05:01] hallelujah so anyway let's move on by
[1:05:04] god's grace
[1:05:06] you're talking about the sentence you
[1:05:08] know paul says i can't even tell you
[1:05:10] amen whether i was in the what heaven i
[1:05:12] was in the third heaven wherever
[1:05:14] he said but the things i saw was
[1:05:16] unlawful for me to speak
[1:05:18] in other words it's not right it ain't
[1:05:19] the time yet hallelujah amen
[1:05:22] and so these things that can only be
[1:05:24] known at the end time why do you
[1:05:26] think god would tell you come to these
[1:05:29] things to tell you
[1:05:30] what what was prepared for you uh you
[1:05:33] know he said i go to prepare a plate for
[1:05:35] you that where i am there you may be
[1:05:36] also
[1:05:38] understand the place that we're going is
[1:05:40] not the final is not the ultimate goal
[1:05:43] the ultimate goal is for god to see
[1:05:47] himself in you in that day you'll know
[1:05:50] that i am in the father
[1:05:51] the father's in me and i am in you
[1:05:55] is that right that's the ultimate goal
[1:05:57] because remember i told you
[1:05:59] that adam and eve purpose was to
[1:06:02] replenish the earth
[1:06:04] the first element is that their main
[1:06:07] purpose was to replenish the earth
[1:06:09] with true sons and daughters of god and
[1:06:13] they
[1:06:13] missed it because of their sin
[1:06:17] hallelujah but the second adam who's a
[1:06:20] quickening spirit
[1:06:22] the bible said he's the lord of heaven
[1:06:23] and heaven y'all understand what that
[1:06:25] means
[1:06:26] that's our father and if he's a
[1:06:28] quickening spirit
[1:06:30] you must be a quickening spirit see but
[1:06:33] we
[1:06:33] must go beyond as our brother was saying
[1:06:35] beyond the veil
[1:06:37] this is what the prophet god was saying
[1:06:39] that when you go
[1:06:40] beyond the veil if you just shut the
[1:06:42] door that's that's what we're having the
[1:06:44] problem
[1:06:45] of shutting the door once we get behind
[1:06:47] there
[1:06:48] because when you shut the door you have
[1:06:50] you have
[1:06:51] rested from all of your labor there's
[1:06:54] nothing you need to do from that point
[1:06:57] on
[1:06:58] hallelujah you just that dead rod
[1:07:01] and god because you're in the presence
[1:07:03] of god it is
[1:07:04] god who gives you life it is god who
[1:07:06] makes you flourish
[1:07:07] it is god who makes you blossom it is
[1:07:10] god who makes you bloom
[1:07:11] it is god who brings forth the fruit is
[1:07:14] god
[1:07:15] as it was supposed to be from the
[1:07:17] beginning
[1:07:19] because of the fall we instituted human
[1:07:22] effort
[1:07:24] we are the ones amen that put this thing
[1:07:27] in action
[1:07:28] adam and eve they brought works
[1:07:32] into into place of grace you know this
[1:07:35] thing started off with grace
[1:07:37] it started off with love it unmerited
[1:07:42] and this is what the message have come
[1:07:44] to restore
[1:07:45] you know we we look at god and he says
[1:07:47] well
[1:07:49] unmerited favor unmerited grace
[1:07:52] it was always that but you see a lot of
[1:07:55] times people don't understand
[1:07:57] that when unmerited grace and the
[1:07:58] unmerited love is given to you
[1:08:00] you're still supposed to keep the word
[1:08:03] amen
[1:08:04] you see you're supposed to keep it if he
[1:08:07] says don't do
[1:08:08] that means don't do but you're doing the
[1:08:11] don't
[1:08:11] do not because it's law but because you
[1:08:14] love him
[1:08:15] the key of the whole message is love
[1:08:19] jesus is love that's why the bible said
[1:08:22] if you say
[1:08:23] i love my brother i hate my brother and
[1:08:25] love my god
[1:08:26] he said you are a liar you can't love
[1:08:29] god without loving your brother
[1:08:32] hallelujah
[1:08:35] a lot of times people want this thing to
[1:08:37] be easy
[1:08:42] my subject this evening is to
[1:08:46] elevate it to the throne of god
[1:08:49] elevate it to the throne of god
[1:08:52] and when you elevate it to the throne of
[1:08:55] god you must understand
[1:08:57] it's not something you do because the
[1:09:00] bible says no man can add one cubit to a
[1:09:02] statue
[1:09:03] so how do i get to the place i need to
[1:09:06] go
[1:09:09] here's the simple answer to that
[1:09:12] they that are led by the spirit of god
[1:09:16] they are the sons of god see
[1:09:19] it's being led by he's the shepherd
[1:09:22] and we're the sheep as long as we follow
[1:09:25] him that's what david said didn't he say
[1:09:29] it
[1:09:30] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:09:33] that's what he said but one of the
[1:09:36] things that
[1:09:36] really caught my attention was that he
[1:09:39] said
[1:09:42] he thou prepared a table before me
[1:09:46] in the presence of my enemies
[1:09:49] huh thou anointed my head with oil
[1:09:53] and my cup running over think about it
[1:09:58] it's it's literally predestination
[1:10:00] that's what david said
[1:10:02] you prepared it you know what prepared
[1:10:04] me
[1:10:05] it means it was done before we got there
[1:10:08] it was already ready like i was telling
[1:10:11] somebody
[1:10:12] no wonder brother branham said that that
[1:10:14] uh jonah was not vaccinated
[1:10:16] the reason why he could truly say that
[1:10:18] is because
[1:10:19] when jonah got there on the boat the
[1:10:22] boat was predestinated
[1:10:24] waiting on it it wasn't just a boat
[1:10:28] waiting on it
[1:10:30] the fish was waiting on him and not only
[1:10:33] was the fish waiting on him
[1:10:35] none of it was waiting on him god had
[1:10:38] already prepared it
[1:10:41] hallelujah sometimes we because we can't
[1:10:44] see the future
[1:10:44] we think we're in the wrong place
[1:10:46] oftentimes you're in the right place
[1:10:49] for the right things to happen so god
[1:10:51] can take you to the destiny
[1:10:53] he's already planned for you to go to
[1:10:56] there's nothing that's mistake it's
[1:10:58] prepared to take
[1:11:00] oh i'm in a place and people don't like
[1:11:02] me they hate me
[1:11:03] prepared
[1:11:07] prepared hallelujah the table is
[1:11:10] prepared in social enemies
[1:11:13] that's why the bible said you must love
[1:11:15] your enemy
[1:11:16] they pray they are the ones that can
[1:11:20] help you
[1:11:21] how can my enemy help you help me he is
[1:11:24] there
[1:11:25] to help develop your character
[1:11:29] hallelujah though anointed listen and
[1:11:32] that's the thing
[1:11:33] when you come to a table
[1:11:36] when you come to a table you know a
[1:11:39] table is a place of inter
[1:11:41] interaction it's a place where
[1:11:44] you know you
[1:11:47] you how can i say you nourish yourselves
[1:11:50] you share
[1:11:53] at experiences table new creation new
[1:11:55] new revelation is created
[1:11:57] that's why the bible says our
[1:11:58] conversation should be holy we talk with
[1:12:00] one another so
[1:12:01] sometimes we hear something like oh i've
[1:12:03] never seen that before
[1:12:04] that you're at the table hallelujah
[1:12:08] and understand amen what that the simmer
[1:12:10] says
[1:12:11] and my cup i thought lord what is that
[1:12:13] cup what is the symbolism of the cup
[1:12:15] the cup is your soul it is your soul
[1:12:19] that's being
[1:12:20] filled and built is that right you grow
[1:12:23] up
[1:12:23] into him hallelujah when
[1:12:27] at the table you say well what do you
[1:12:29] mean
[1:12:30] remember on the road to emmaus they went
[1:12:32] into that little hut
[1:12:34] the whole time jesus talked with them
[1:12:36] and all he got was a burning heart
[1:12:39] did not our heart burn as he talked to
[1:12:42] us
[1:12:42] along the way see because you feel good
[1:12:44] about the word doesn't mean that you got
[1:12:46] the revelation of it
[1:12:48] hallelujah the bible said when he did a
[1:12:51] certain thing and broke the bread
[1:12:53] then were the eyes open everybody leave
[1:12:57] out a church
[1:12:58] feeling good but you don't need to let
[1:13:00] go out just feeling good
[1:13:01] you need to understand what he's telling
[1:13:03] you at the table
[1:13:05] walking out there and they ran back he's
[1:13:08] alive
[1:13:10] he's alive understand that's what it's
[1:13:12] all about
[1:13:13] the whole thing is that you're setting
[1:13:14] at the table of malachi
[1:13:16] 4 and revelation 10 7 you're eating the
[1:13:19] word
[1:13:19] but that word is not set there just to
[1:13:22] make you feel good
[1:13:23] it is to bring identification and and to
[1:13:26] to know that christ is identified with
[1:13:28] you and you identify with him
[1:13:31] and what did he bring you back to even
[1:13:34] at the table
[1:13:35] he brought you back to the cross the
[1:13:38] sacrifice
[1:13:39] the piercing of the hands huh
[1:13:42] that's what it's all about the symbolism
[1:13:45] of that cup when that word is given to
[1:13:48] you and that revelation
[1:13:49] began to flow deep down and it's what is
[1:13:53] going to what does the true revelation
[1:13:55] of god produces love
[1:13:58] not only love for god but love for your
[1:14:00] brother have you ever felt like that
[1:14:02] you come out of service and you want to
[1:14:03] hug everybody even the sisters
[1:14:05] but you know you can't and you say oh
[1:14:07] sis i feel so good when we get over
[1:14:09] there we'll do it
[1:14:11] you know it's just that love that
[1:14:13] overflowing love that literally comes in
[1:14:15] your heart and come to yourself
[1:14:16] and you're feeling so good you stimulate
[1:14:18] it right brother keep coming time and
[1:14:20] you come out staggering
[1:14:21] you don't mean to stagger but that
[1:14:23] anointing
[1:14:24] is overflowing it feels your soul it
[1:14:27] overflows
[1:14:29] in your soul the cup might come running
[1:14:32] over
[1:14:33] and what is the revelation surely
[1:14:36] goodness
[1:14:37] and mercy shall follow me all the days
[1:14:41] of my life what did he tell you then
[1:14:44] he'll
[1:14:44] he'll never keep the mercies from you
[1:14:46] he'll never
[1:14:47] to keep goodness from you you you just
[1:14:49] had an intimate relationship with him
[1:14:52] sitting at the table a table that's been
[1:14:56] prepared for you
[1:14:58] oh yes yes amen
[1:15:02] you say do you get what do you eat there
[1:15:04] at the table
[1:15:05] huh the bread the word
[1:15:10] he said if you eat this bread you'll
[1:15:12] never hunger ever again
[1:15:14] you there's bread there there's is that
[1:15:16] what he what happened in the communion
[1:15:18] what did he bring
[1:15:19] amen he brought the symbolism of life to
[1:15:21] you
[1:15:22] i am that bread ah he took wine he said
[1:15:26] stimulated amen
[1:15:28] i'm gonna not just give you some dead
[1:15:30] piece of bread
[1:15:31] hallelujah but if i bring light to that
[1:15:33] bread through that wine it stimulates
[1:15:36] you
[1:15:37] is that right and he told the woman at
[1:15:39] the well he says listen if you drink of
[1:15:40] this water
[1:15:42] you'll never thirst again hallelujah so
[1:15:45] there's more david was looking at
[1:15:47] something he saw a prophecy he saw
[1:15:49] something fulfilled there he says and
[1:15:51] me what i want you to understand i'm in
[1:15:53] the hands of the shepherd
[1:15:56] hallelujah i fear no evil
[1:15:59] why because thou art with me is that
[1:16:02] right
[1:16:03] surely surely thou art with me he said
[1:16:06] i'll never leave you
[1:16:07] nor will i forsake you i will always be
[1:16:10] with you
[1:16:11] what do you mean even through the hard
[1:16:13] times
[1:16:16] it's still the will of god
[1:16:19] hallelujah you don't think john
[1:16:21] understood that john the baptist
[1:16:24] it took him a bit but john didn't want
[1:16:27] to just die without knowing
[1:16:29] his work had not been fulfilled once he
[1:16:32] realized his destiny had come to an end
[1:16:35] he said i just want to know are you the
[1:16:37] one because john
[1:16:39] understood i must decrease while he
[1:16:42] increased
[1:16:43] you understand me but what we must
[1:16:45] understand
[1:16:46] is that the denomination has come to a
[1:16:48] place where they're dead i know
[1:16:51] they can still shout they can still
[1:16:52] dance they can still speak in tongues
[1:16:54] they can still prophesy
[1:16:56] they still pray and people get healed
[1:16:58] listen
[1:16:59] but he said it's more to this than that
[1:17:03] hallelujah what are you doing is just
[1:17:05] straightening up the mess that adam and
[1:17:06] eve did
[1:17:08] but i did it jesus did it
[1:17:11] right and i'm doing all of these things
[1:17:13] but that's not what i want
[1:17:15] i don't want the strength of samson
[1:17:18] i want his heart hallelujah
[1:17:21] yes i gave him those miraculous things
[1:17:24] that in his life but that's not what i
[1:17:26] wanted
[1:17:26] i had to send him through oh what were
[1:17:28] you saying do you think
[1:17:31] that the capture of samson
[1:17:34] was a mistake may have been on his part
[1:17:38] but god ordained it hallelujah you think
[1:17:42] the
[1:17:42] delilah was a vessel of dishonor
[1:17:46] prepared hello
[1:17:50] prepare for samson
[1:17:54] she took samson's in a place he had
[1:17:56] never been
[1:18:00] he was blind he was mocked he was
[1:18:03] laughed at
[1:18:05] backslidden but he was seed
[1:18:10] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:18:13] me
[1:18:14] all the days of my life what yes
[1:18:18] that's what it's going to take to get to
[1:18:20] the throne you can't get there on your
[1:18:22] own
[1:18:24] you know i used to think enough when he
[1:18:26] said enoch walked with god and was
[1:18:27] translated
[1:18:28] i thought for a long time you know you
[1:18:30] know you know how you have you know we
[1:18:32] think law
[1:18:34] i did he not well you know he had to
[1:18:37] walk so circumspect but don't you
[1:18:39] understand it was never enoch
[1:18:42] it was the anointing
[1:18:45] folks it's the anointing it is the
[1:18:47] christ
[1:18:49] that made enoch walk with god
[1:18:52] it wasn't law it was christ it was the
[1:18:55] anointing and enoch had a
[1:18:58] had a had a how can i say he was uh
[1:19:02] sensitive enough
[1:19:03] [Laughter]
[1:19:05] to know when god was leading him that's
[1:19:08] what we need
[1:19:09] we need some anointing uh christ
[1:19:11] sensitivity
[1:19:14] hallelujah you love the lord right he
[1:19:17] was that bread he said you'll never
[1:19:18] thirst he told a woman at the well
[1:19:20] you know you know if you drink of this
[1:19:22] water you shall never thirst again
[1:19:24] so god has never changed his menu
[1:19:29] hallelujah he's never changed his menu
[1:19:33] hallelujah he may have given you cannot
[1:19:35] say it like this
[1:19:36] without us being carnal he may giving
[1:19:39] you some better seasoning
[1:19:42] but he's still been serving the same
[1:19:44] thing
[1:19:47] is that right common manner
[1:19:50] becomes something great in the eyes of
[1:19:53] the believer
[1:19:55] you think if they would if they had
[1:19:56] known that was christ in the wilderness
[1:19:58] they would have handled it differently
[1:20:01] if the people know that the message
[1:20:03] is christ it is the revealed word
[1:20:06] it is the anointed word of the hour if
[1:20:09] people could see that they would give it
[1:20:11] a better
[1:20:12] revelation a reverence than what they do
[1:20:15] is the truth it's become common manner
[1:20:18] to a lot of people
[1:20:19] and when it become common you can't grow
[1:20:22] you can't live
[1:20:23] you're going to do just what they did in
[1:20:24] the wilderness they died
[1:20:27] hallelujah because it was so common they
[1:20:29] kept complaining they kept murmuring
[1:20:31] hallelujah and they failed to see that
[1:20:33] the thing that they were eating was the
[1:20:35] thing that was giving them life
[1:20:37] man does not live by bread alone but by
[1:20:40] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:20:41] mouth of god
[1:20:43] hallelujah you love the lord amen we
[1:20:47] we we must understand that this message
[1:20:50] has taken us to a higher level
[1:20:52] you know samson did some great works he
[1:20:54] did but the latter end was great
[1:20:57] that was you see
[1:21:00] that was you sampson was blind to
[1:21:03] himself
[1:21:04] blind to the philistines hallelujah
[1:21:07] dead to himself dead to the philistines
[1:21:11] and the only thing that he had left was
[1:21:12] the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:21:15] that's where the bride must come to be
[1:21:18] blind to herself
[1:21:19] blind to this organization blind to the
[1:21:22] system of the message
[1:21:23] you understand me it is here that's why
[1:21:26] people sat and died the way they've been
[1:21:28] dying
[1:21:29] because they've fallen in love with the
[1:21:30] system they're practicing
[1:21:33] they're trying to produce the rapture on
[1:21:35] their own effort you can't do it
[1:21:37] it's christ in you if that same spirit
[1:21:41] be
[1:21:41] in you that was also in christ jesus as
[1:21:44] it quickened his body
[1:21:46] it shall quicken yours it will raise you
[1:21:49] up
[1:21:49] you cannot raise yourself it will raise
[1:21:52] you
[1:21:53] it is the life or the law of the life
[1:21:56] hey it's the law of the light it's
[1:21:59] called
[1:21:59] in you the hope of glory hallelujah
[1:22:04] hallelujah coming from the north not
[1:22:07] brother says now people can live in the
[1:22:10] spirit
[1:22:11] dance in the spirit they shout in the
[1:22:13] spirit they go to church in the spirit
[1:22:15] and they can absolutely have the real
[1:22:18] spirit of the
[1:22:19] of god anointed on that spirit but still
[1:22:23] be lost and just a devil possessed
[1:22:26] and just as devil possessed as they can
[1:22:29] be
[1:22:30] with that spirit why because it's on the
[1:22:33] spirit
[1:22:35] the anointing is on the spirit
[1:22:37] conversion
[1:22:38] come by the soul with that soul
[1:22:41] die it shall live hallelujah y'all
[1:22:45] understand what he's saying
[1:22:46] and we've seen that pentecost isn't all
[1:22:49] messaging all
[1:22:50] i mean you know can't even love each
[1:22:52] other but they can shout they can dance
[1:22:54] they can
[1:22:54] whatever more that ain't it we're
[1:22:57] falling into the same trap
[1:22:59] of the devil because you feel good and
[1:23:02] because you got a good thing
[1:23:03] and you know it's a real anointing but
[1:23:06] yet
[1:23:06] in your soul you know you're not
[1:23:10] converted
[1:23:12] you should know
[1:23:17] hallelujah think about it
[1:23:20] i think about the this is a drama
[1:23:23] you know you got to have those exciting
[1:23:25] parts you got to have those love stories
[1:23:27] come on
[1:23:28] hollywood does it you know it's not good
[1:23:31] until you get the love scene
[1:23:34] yeah come on folks let's not be connor
[1:23:35] but it's true
[1:23:37] people don't look at donald duck anymore
[1:23:39] they want some exciting
[1:23:41] portions war and fighting and love and
[1:23:44] romance and
[1:23:45] all of those things where did they get
[1:23:46] it from though they have perverted it
[1:23:49] the true love story is in this bible
[1:23:54] the true love story all hollywood does
[1:23:57] is mimic what god has already done
[1:23:59] and twist it and make it perverted and
[1:24:01] filthy but there is a real love story in
[1:24:04] this day
[1:24:05] and you and i we're the queen
[1:24:09] you understand me we're the center of
[1:24:11] the attraction
[1:24:12] we are the things that have been hidden
[1:24:14] from the foundation of the world
[1:24:16] remember when i quoted that quote last
[1:24:19] week uh wednesday
[1:24:21] and i showed you the fullness of the
[1:24:23] godhead bodily right
[1:24:25] the foothill was father son and holy
[1:24:27] ghost right
[1:24:29] but i showed you by god's grace how the
[1:24:31] fullness and i got the quote too
[1:24:33] the fullness of the godhead bodily has
[1:24:35] moved it's shifted
[1:24:37] into the bride of jesus christ she is
[1:24:40] the fullness of the god is that right
[1:24:42] after which you have received the holy
[1:24:44] ghost you shall receive what
[1:24:46] power that means authority
[1:24:49] that means you're no longer amen uh how
[1:24:52] can i say it
[1:24:53] god has break brought you to an
[1:24:56] inequality
[1:24:58] hold up brother an equality absolutely
[1:25:01] he showed it in type hallelujah that's
[1:25:03] why the seals had to be open
[1:25:05] so you could see what god is calling you
[1:25:08] to where your destiny is taken to you
[1:25:11] did jesus say it he said if you overcome
[1:25:14] it i'm just i'm
[1:25:14] gonna worry about it now he said if you
[1:25:16] can overcome he said i'll cause you to
[1:25:18] to sit in my throne even i have i have
[1:25:21] sit
[1:25:22] in my father's throne you say that's not
[1:25:25] equality yes it is
[1:25:26] saint john 10 30 he said i and my father
[1:25:29] are one
[1:25:30] he made himself they said what you make
[1:25:32] yourself equal with god
[1:25:34] hallelujah see he was equal
[1:25:38] y'all understand me more than that he
[1:25:40] was god
[1:25:41] so when he said amen i i that's why paul
[1:25:44] said we're joined with christ
[1:25:46] in the old the seals had to be opened
[1:25:48] the headstone had to come
[1:25:50] why because it was marrying time it was
[1:25:53] wedding time
[1:25:54] it was wedding supper time and you
[1:25:56] cannot
[1:25:57] marry the groom if he's not there so he
[1:26:00] had to come by way of seven thunders
[1:26:03] yeah i'd rather hear what i'm saying
[1:26:05] there was a predestinated bride that had
[1:26:07] to
[1:26:08] be there is that right and you had to
[1:26:11] have somebody
[1:26:12] to introduce the bride to the bridegroom
[1:26:15] and that was william branham oh
[1:26:18] will you take this man to be your
[1:26:21] lawfully wedded husband
[1:26:23] and she says i do
[1:26:26] hallelujah amen so you said what do you
[1:26:29] mean brother brooks
[1:26:31] esther says listen i got it written down
[1:26:34] somewhere
[1:26:35] esther the fifth chapter
[1:26:38] one through three three and esther goes
[1:26:42] to see the king
[1:26:43] now they told us that you can't do this
[1:26:45] but that's to say if i perish let me
[1:26:47] perish
[1:26:48] i'm going to see the king and when she
[1:26:51] went before a king i have to hear
[1:26:53] it was out of season he did not call for
[1:26:56] her
[1:26:57] you understand me the bride had made
[1:27:00] herself ready
[1:27:01] he did not call for her she went to
[1:27:04] him say where is that scripture
[1:27:07] when rebecca saw isaac in the field
[1:27:12] she went to him
[1:27:16] somebody i feel like shouting john up
[1:27:18] here because you got to realize it's
[1:27:20] something
[1:27:21] you've got to see who's in the field
[1:27:23] who's in the field
[1:27:26] you've got to come up to him hi from
[1:27:29] glory to glory to glory to glory
[1:27:32] amen from faith amen to knowledge to you
[1:27:35] know
[1:27:36] temperance patience all the way up god
[1:27:39] doing what filling your cup
[1:27:43] changing you and when you get to that
[1:27:46] final your cup was so run over
[1:27:48] it'll quicken your mortal body and
[1:27:51] change you from your
[1:27:52] from his this immortal immortality oh we
[1:27:55] we better understand this thing this
[1:27:57] thing is
[1:27:58] life it is the law of life like that
[1:28:00] that worm could not change itself into a
[1:28:02] caterpillar
[1:28:03] you cannot change yourself to a saint
[1:28:05] you cannot change on
[1:28:06] and bring on the theophany and the
[1:28:08] glorified oh it's the life
[1:28:10] in you that does it and god's word
[1:28:13] cannot come back forward
[1:28:18] you're talking about authority he put
[1:28:20] that staff out there and she didn't put
[1:28:21] it on the side she didn't bring it down
[1:28:23] to the bottom
[1:28:24] she touched the top showing she was
[1:28:27] equal
[1:28:28] oh come on somebody and he didn't say
[1:28:30] get your hand down from there
[1:28:33] he said no come on come on come on what
[1:28:35] is it that you want
[1:28:36] i'll give you the half of the king see
[1:28:38] you see what i'm saying he's already
[1:28:40] told her
[1:28:40] what he's going to give her she hadn't
[1:28:43] even asked yet
[1:28:44] he's telling her i'm giving you the half
[1:28:46] of the kingdom
[1:28:47] he said brother branham because you have
[1:28:49] chosen the hardaway
[1:28:51] i have reserved for you a greater
[1:28:53] portion a big part of this whole
[1:28:56] thing and the problem god said these
[1:28:58] people who overcome in his message
[1:29:00] we get the greater part we get the
[1:29:02] greater reward
[1:29:03] we suffer we got to go through it why
[1:29:05] because the greatest battle ever thought
[1:29:07] where
[1:29:07] is in your mind
[1:29:12] brother keith and i were talking
[1:29:15] and i thought you know that's true
[1:29:18] we fight the same devil
[1:29:23] most of our battles come from the sexual
[1:29:27] battle that's how it started
[1:29:32] and that's how it ends
[1:29:35] keeping yourself from the filth of the
[1:29:37] world
[1:29:39] that's your greatest battle
[1:29:42] that was great as battle that was
[1:29:43] brother brown whose greatest battle
[1:29:46] it wasn't a demon of epilepsy or the
[1:29:48] demon of that or that it was sex
[1:29:50] he had to put that cross in front of him
[1:29:52] because of the naked women and
[1:29:54] everything
[1:29:55] y'all hear what i'm saying it was then
[1:29:57] it is now
[1:29:59] hallelujah everything everything
[1:30:04] is centered around that thing that took
[1:30:07] place in the garden
[1:30:09] no matter what you look at on on tv and
[1:30:12] the billboards and everything else
[1:30:14] it's all about sex
[1:30:17] you can't even sell a product without it
[1:30:19] being sexy
[1:30:21] when a truck became sexy but take that
[1:30:24] take a woman
[1:30:25] and put it in front of that a naked
[1:30:27] woman and put it in front of that truck
[1:30:30] and she gonna sell that truck for you
[1:30:34] hallelujah you know what they say you
[1:30:36] got to treat this thing like it's a
[1:30:38] woman
[1:30:40] a man don't drive a man truck that
[1:30:43] that truck becomes a sheep
[1:30:48] yeah y'all hear what i'm saying it's
[1:30:50] always that
[1:30:51] musicians a lot of the musicians in the
[1:30:53] world they play it
[1:30:55] oh let me not go there because it is
[1:30:58] true
[1:30:59] it's something that's going on in their
[1:31:01] spirit that makes them play certain ways
[1:31:05] anyhow go look it up
[1:31:08] but my whole point is everything is
[1:31:11] centered around the very fact
[1:31:13] that it was sex in the garden instead of
[1:31:15] an apple
[1:31:19] you said well what about esther did not
[1:31:21] he give her the authority
[1:31:24] esther not only became the authority
[1:31:26] that saved
[1:31:27] the the foolish virgins which were those
[1:31:31] ones who got
[1:31:32] was going to get killed and they had had
[1:31:34] the right to fight
[1:31:36] that was a type she was already in the
[1:31:39] castle
[1:31:40] they were the ones who had to deal with
[1:31:41] the devil after she left
[1:31:43] she exposed the devil and haman
[1:31:46] you said who was haman type the devil
[1:31:50] that's why the prophet we pray for the
[1:31:52] foolish virgins
[1:31:53] because we don't pray for them they
[1:31:55] wouldn't make it they won't make it
[1:31:58] we're the queen of the foolish virgins
[1:32:01] hello now esther didn't have to fight
[1:32:06] to stay alive but they have to fight
[1:32:09] and that's when that tribulation that
[1:32:11] period comes on them they're going to
[1:32:12] have to fight
[1:32:14] to stay alive you know what i mean
[1:32:16] spiritually
[1:32:19] and because they fought roles were given
[1:32:21] to them
[1:32:22] it's still the grace of god you hear
[1:32:25] what i'm saying
[1:32:26] and esther became the mediator oh you
[1:32:29] better not say
[1:32:30] that yes she did she
[1:32:33] mediated between her people and and the
[1:32:36] foolish out there
[1:32:38] she mediated that's why we must pray
[1:32:43] for those who are not of the foe
[1:32:47] we we have a responsibility we're under
[1:32:50] the blood they are not they just think
[1:32:52] that they are
[1:32:54] that's the words of the prophet they
[1:32:56] they find themselves in the tribulation
[1:32:58] because they thought they were under the
[1:32:59] blood and they were not
[1:33:01] where is the blood under the reveal word
[1:33:06] god has moved the ark of the covenant
[1:33:08] where is it now
[1:33:09] in you hallelujah and where is the blood
[1:33:13] on the altar that's why we can pray for
[1:33:16] mercy we can pray for grace
[1:33:18] we are those who are praying that's why
[1:33:23] the word of god said to ezekiel those
[1:33:25] that sigh and cry
[1:33:28] hallelujah what about ruth you
[1:33:30] understand me
[1:33:31] ruth looked like this was a this was a
[1:33:33] mistake you know
[1:33:35] how could naomi and her husband them go
[1:33:37] out to moab when there was a law
[1:33:38] against moab don't have nothing to do
[1:33:40] with them god
[1:33:42] god held that thing against them but
[1:33:44] there is a seed
[1:33:46] the lord knoweth them that are his god
[1:33:49] don't care about your background
[1:33:51] the only thing he's looking at is your
[1:33:53] seed his seed
[1:33:54] you understand me all of us was in a
[1:33:56] messed up background
[1:33:58] everyone especially in america
[1:34:02] america has been an adulterous
[1:34:03] generation for years
[1:34:06] do you know how long it takes to clean
[1:34:08] that up
[1:34:10] 400 years and we haven't even existed
[1:34:13] for that
[1:34:15] so if it wasn't for the grace of god
[1:34:18] none of us would be suitable to be saved
[1:34:21] it's not your fleshly inheritance
[1:34:24] god ain't working with that because the
[1:34:26] gentiles have been mutts for ages
[1:34:29] god's looking at the seed that was
[1:34:32] planted in you before the foundation of
[1:34:34] the world
[1:34:35] that's it and god showed that through
[1:34:38] ruth
[1:34:39] right she was a morbidity she was a
[1:34:41] mixed breed
[1:34:42] but that god didn't care about that she
[1:34:45] wasn't that in her soul
[1:34:47] she was thoroughbred in her soul y'all
[1:34:50] understand me
[1:34:52] and god saw that and god
[1:34:55] went through he took naomi and her
[1:34:58] husbands and her sons
[1:34:59] through all that hardship to produce
[1:35:03] what
[1:35:05] one roof
[1:35:09] and this world is going to go through
[1:35:10] all of that crazy stuff
[1:35:12] to produce one prize amen
[1:35:16] who israel got to go through stuff to do
[1:35:19] what
[1:35:20] to produce a hundred and forty four
[1:35:22] thousand
[1:35:24] it was playing the table was prepared
[1:35:27] hallelujah the anti-crisis
[1:35:29] is building up for one thing to put
[1:35:32] pressure on the bride
[1:35:33] destroy denominationalism uh uh
[1:35:36] the foolish right foolish young virgins
[1:35:39] and to do what
[1:35:41] to kill a hundred and forty four
[1:35:43] thousand
[1:35:44] won't be one lead lest it won't be one
[1:35:47] more
[1:35:48] and only god will know the number you
[1:35:50] understand me
[1:35:51] you say well well brothers what are you
[1:35:53] saying listen you gotta understand like
[1:35:56] brother brown said
[1:35:56] the book of ruth is a very beautiful
[1:35:59] picture
[1:36:00] there how that boasts type out christ
[1:36:03] how that ruth went over in a strange
[1:36:05] country
[1:36:05] as a backslid sliding went out of the
[1:36:08] land
[1:36:09] and brought back with her uh uh uh uh
[1:36:13] uh you know naomi did that he had it
[1:36:16] switched over he said i mean naomi
[1:36:17] and brought back ruth and ruth came back
[1:36:20] and she was what uh of another country
[1:36:23] of a more
[1:36:24] bite and when she came back she
[1:36:27] was a morbidity absolutely a picture of
[1:36:30] the gentile bride
[1:36:31] of the church because every one of us
[1:36:34] most of us who were in denominations
[1:36:36] we were more by this half word have
[1:36:39] organization
[1:36:40] amen listen he said he said and listen
[1:36:44] he he goes on and says
[1:36:45] and let your people he said when when
[1:36:48] ruth
[1:36:49] said to naomi let your people
[1:36:52] be my people and let your dwelling be my
[1:36:55] dwelling
[1:36:56] and let your god be my god and nothing
[1:37:00] but
[1:37:00] death shall separate us he said where
[1:37:03] you die
[1:37:04] i die when you are buried
[1:37:08] i'll be buried now there is a picture of
[1:37:11] the gentile
[1:37:12] coming into christ
[1:37:18] she's dying her whole goal is to die to
[1:37:22] self
[1:37:23] that he might live yes sir you love the
[1:37:26] lord
[1:37:28] amen god is so good to us amen
[1:37:31] god is so good to us now we we said well
[1:37:34] what do you mean brother we have a
[1:37:35] destiny
[1:37:36] and that destiny amen has been planned
[1:37:41] by god no matter how messed up it is
[1:37:44] now y'all y'all i'm gonna use my
[1:37:46] brethren you got one from the congo and
[1:37:48] one from zimbabwe
[1:37:51] how did you get here i'm just saying
[1:37:55] tonight
[1:37:55] think about it now this you didn't know
[1:37:58] me i didn't know you
[1:38:01] think about keith up in des moines
[1:38:05] i never dreamed i would ever be in des
[1:38:08] moines
[1:38:09] never had a desire to be in des moines
[1:38:11] and when he told me
[1:38:13] about how the lord showed him i was
[1:38:14] going to be pastor demon i laughed
[1:38:18] so what i'm trying to say is all of this
[1:38:20] has been ordained
[1:38:22] look at my brother here i've seen him in
[1:38:24] years you know the last time i seen him
[1:38:27] he
[1:38:27] came through by iowa city do you think
[1:38:29] it was a coincidence
[1:38:31] i don't know what god has in store for
[1:38:33] him but tonight was no coincidence
[1:38:37] everything is ordained by god and you
[1:38:40] and i must understand
[1:38:41] is what brother brooks you say what can
[1:38:44] that be
[1:38:44] well remember when paul was preaching so
[1:38:47] long and a young man fell asleep and
[1:38:49] failed after
[1:38:50] he died do you think that was an
[1:38:52] accident
[1:38:54] god didn't know what was going to happen
[1:38:56] he knew it
[1:38:57] and it all was done for the glory of god
[1:39:01] so even the most tragical things that
[1:39:04] may in our minds think
[1:39:05] how can it happen let me tell y'all
[1:39:07] something my children right now you look
[1:39:09] at them
[1:39:10] whether they're looking at this i don't
[1:39:12] know i'm not saying all of them but let
[1:39:14] me tell you something
[1:39:14] and i want the devil to take note to
[1:39:16] this it doesn't matter
[1:39:19] what it looks like it doesn't even
[1:39:22] matter how the devil judges it
[1:39:24] it has nothing to do with the devil i
[1:39:27] don't have to understand what he's doing
[1:39:30] but he promised me every one of my
[1:39:34] children
[1:39:34] i don't know how god's going to bring
[1:39:36] him through but in my mind
[1:39:38] they already come through i don't have
[1:39:41] to help it
[1:39:42] i don't have to usher it i don't have to
[1:39:44] do nothing because he promised it
[1:39:47] y'all understand me a promise can never
[1:39:50] be broken by god
[1:39:52] hallelujah ask whatsoever you will and
[1:39:54] believe it in your heart
[1:39:56] it shall be given unto you he can't stop
[1:39:59] that
[1:39:59] that's his law and life itself will make
[1:40:02] it happen
[1:40:05] hallelujah you look at these things and
[1:40:07] you say oh brother brooks
[1:40:09] what are you trying to say let me tell
[1:40:10] you something and i'm closing on this
[1:40:13] it's unconditional
[1:40:17] don't even think it don't even let satan
[1:40:20] come to your mind
[1:40:21] because of what you've done this is
[1:40:23] what's why it's happening
[1:40:25] well if it is it's going to have to be
[1:40:26] undone
[1:40:30] because god's purpose is going to be
[1:40:31] filled yeah
[1:40:33] how many of us let me ask a question
[1:40:35] it's as much as
[1:40:37] when it comes to parents there is no
[1:40:40] such thing as a perfect parent
[1:40:43] no such thing we all make mistakes
[1:40:47] i have made plenty if i could go back
[1:40:48] and change it i would
[1:40:50] i think but you know what i think about
[1:40:53] how god is playing this thing
[1:40:54] i better leave it alone because he's the
[1:40:56] one that's bringing forth the virtue
[1:40:59] he's the one that's going to bring the
[1:41:00] change he hasn't made a mistake
[1:41:03] even though my mistakes may seem like
[1:41:05] mistakes
[1:41:06] the bible said that the lord knows how
[1:41:09] to do what
[1:41:11] everything that works against you
[1:41:14] he knows how to turn it into good
[1:41:17] because
[1:41:17] all things work together for the good
[1:41:20] of them that love god now you say well
[1:41:24] well brother where where are you taking
[1:41:26] me with this so let me let me say this
[1:41:29] something that we were discussing
[1:41:30] earlier today
[1:41:33] we know we can't change ourselves
[1:41:38] but forgiveness from the lord is needed
[1:41:42] for us every day
[1:41:46] and the only way that we can ever get
[1:41:48] cleansed every day
[1:41:50] is to confess our sins because he said
[1:41:53] if you confess your sins he is faithful
[1:41:55] and just
[1:41:57] to forgive you of your sins and to
[1:41:58] cleanse you
[1:42:00] from all unrighteousness that's it
[1:42:03] that's all we have to do you say well
[1:42:05] what do you mean because
[1:42:07] when you confess your sins you're
[1:42:08] basically saying god you're right
[1:42:10] and i'm wrong that's all adam and eve
[1:42:12] had to do but they did not
[1:42:15] they will got in the way and they
[1:42:19] when they will got in the way they they
[1:42:22] produce pride
[1:42:24] father lord that woman you gave me the
[1:42:27] woman says lord
[1:42:28] that serpent you gave me but when it
[1:42:30] comes down to decisions
[1:42:32] it's your choosing at the end of the day
[1:42:35] you can say the devil made me do it but
[1:42:36] listen
[1:42:37] brother i'm saying you can't even blame
[1:42:38] the devil no
[1:42:41] ain't the more it's you it's your will
[1:42:44] your will
[1:42:45] he may have influenced you but you find
[1:42:47] your the final choice
[1:42:49] was yours other than so you got to
[1:42:51] understand
[1:42:52] god god going to get the devil but he
[1:42:54] going to judge you too
[1:42:56] god judges us all and you got to
[1:42:59] understand at the end of the day
[1:43:00] is what i have done and that's why you
[1:43:02] can't this is what people never grow up
[1:43:04] in mature
[1:43:05] because they want to blame everybody
[1:43:07] else for their faults and the problem is
[1:43:09] not
[1:43:10] everybody else is that individual
[1:43:14] right god gonna say what have you what
[1:43:16] did you do
[1:43:17] with this gospel well so and so no no no
[1:43:20] no
[1:43:20] what did you do you're standing
[1:43:24] alone but that's how it is now
[1:43:28] you're standing alone with god it's you
[1:43:31] and god at the table
[1:43:32] you and god that's fellowshipping at the
[1:43:34] table he's prepared the table and then
[1:43:36] he told he shows you
[1:43:38] where your enemies are is that right
[1:43:40] that's israel what they had to do
[1:43:42] god said don't worry about it i'll go
[1:43:44] before you i prepared it for you
[1:43:46] but i'm gonna go before you you're gonna
[1:43:48] win the battle all you got to do is do
[1:43:50] exactly as i told you to do
[1:43:52] you do what i tell you to do you'll come
[1:43:54] out as a winner
[1:43:56] right but lord there's so many no no no
[1:43:59] i told you to get before the army and
[1:44:01] you shout and praise god
[1:44:02] do you know you know make some good
[1:44:04] noise some worship noise and i
[1:44:06] i'll fight the battle for you that's
[1:44:08] what he did
[1:44:10] a lot of time we try not fight about you
[1:44:12] can't fight the devil
[1:44:14] he you pull your fist up at him he
[1:44:15] laughs what can the natural do with the
[1:44:18] supernatural
[1:44:19] absolutely nothing let's stand i'll
[1:44:22] finish it
[1:44:23] i'm not done but i want you to
[1:44:25] understand that
[1:44:26] we get with this whole message has come
[1:44:29] to
[1:44:30] elevate us take us from this carnal
[1:44:33] state to a higher plane
[1:44:35] you just this church was a name higher
[1:44:36] ground for nothing you got to believe
[1:44:38] that it was inspired for god by god of
[1:44:40] it it was
[1:44:41] amen that means god intend to take us
[1:44:44] there
[1:44:45] and so we we must understand that it
[1:44:48] doesn't matter what everybody else is
[1:44:49] doing
[1:44:50] it's what god expects us to do as
[1:44:52] individuals
[1:44:53] people keep pressing i know it's
[1:44:55] difficult
[1:44:56] i know it's hard i have battles now look
[1:44:59] like a like i've never had before
[1:45:01] my mind sometimes my mind goes on a
[1:45:03] freeze
[1:45:07] right in the middle of a subject or a
[1:45:08] sentence and all of a sudden it freezes
[1:45:12] you know you can't you can't do nothing
[1:45:13] wait till it come back
[1:45:15] right but god knows every freeze
[1:45:21] he talks at all you know and you look at
[1:45:24] it like he doesn't understand
[1:45:26] no he does but sometimes you know what
[1:45:30] if pride is there it becomes so
[1:45:31] embarrassing
[1:45:33] and we try to make excuses for it but
[1:45:35] there's no excuse you didn't turn it on
[1:45:37] and you can't turn it off
[1:45:39] it works at his own will in his own pace
[1:45:42] you understand
[1:45:44] today i had a little a talk with god
[1:45:49] and um i remember
[1:45:52] uh saying that i wasn't gonna
[1:45:56] take that shot and i told
[1:46:00] everybody that god told me not to and i
[1:46:03] really believe he did but then
[1:46:06] i did take the pfizer
[1:46:09] i apologize to you all for that
[1:46:12] um i don't know what really made me do
[1:46:16] it other than forgetting
[1:46:17] the word of god like he did
[1:46:21] i told her not to eat the tree and she
[1:46:23] did it and basically that's the way i
[1:46:25] felt when
[1:46:26] the conviction came upon me i don't
[1:46:29] one of the things that really bothered
[1:46:30] me is because i had someone say to me
[1:46:33] brother brooks i haven't taken the shot
[1:46:35] because you're not taking it
[1:46:37] no no no you can't do that don't put
[1:46:40] that weight on him
[1:46:41] every man for himself if you feel
[1:46:44] like you should take it take it
[1:46:48] the reason why i say that is because if
[1:46:50] you take
[1:46:51] a surface the bible says nothing shall
[1:46:53] now you can't do it if you ain't taking
[1:46:55] it in favor
[1:46:57] i didn't take it because i was fearful
[1:46:59] my purpose is one of the things that
[1:47:01] hurt me the most is because i don't want
[1:47:04] to be one that would transmit anything
[1:47:06] to anybody you know
[1:47:09] um and then i thought if i'm gonna
[1:47:13] travel i want to go somewhere where i
[1:47:15] can come back home
[1:47:17] i don't want to be locked overseas
[1:47:21] because i can't i don't have a shot and
[1:47:23] they don't ban it you know what i'm
[1:47:24] trying to say it's just that kind of
[1:47:25] thing it's way i've been thinking
[1:47:27] and people of god i i just the reason
[1:47:30] why i'm apologizing i've
[1:47:31] made it right with god because i really
[1:47:33] believe he told me
[1:47:34] and i did it and whatever the
[1:47:36] consequences are
[1:47:37] if there'll be any maybe you know he
[1:47:40] said he would
[1:47:41] i made things right but i don't want
[1:47:44] anybody to depend
[1:47:45] on my leadership in that area that's
[1:47:47] common but
[1:47:48] spiritual things that's a different
[1:47:50] thing
[1:47:52] and uh you know it's like okay brother
[1:47:55] bruce because you're jumping off the
[1:47:56] river i
[1:47:57] jumping off the bridge i'll jump off
[1:47:59] because you're jumping no no
[1:48:01] no no that's not the word wise
[1:48:04] [Music]
[1:48:06] we must all inquire of the lord
[1:48:09] and see what the will of the lord is now
[1:48:11] they saying that this vaccine has all
[1:48:13] kinds of effects and side effects
[1:48:16] it's a modern day genocide so we had
[1:48:21] whatever comes whatever comes like i
[1:48:24] said
[1:48:24] do you think god didn't know what i was
[1:48:27] going to do
[1:48:28] even though he told me i'm the one
[1:48:30] that's finding out what i
[1:48:32] and like i was telling brother keith
[1:48:34] today i said there was no pressure
[1:48:37] but you know i knew it was wrong because
[1:48:39] i hid it from the bike
[1:48:41] and the very day i was going to tell her
[1:48:44] she discovered the
[1:48:45] paperwork in my car
[1:48:48] and i told her i was going to tell her
[1:48:50] and i would tell keith i'm going to tell
[1:48:51] the church
[1:48:52] why because i want to be open and honest
[1:48:55] with everybody
[1:48:57] and so this is my confession i pray that
[1:49:00] you forgive us
[1:49:03] [Music]
[1:49:10] one thing about me i'm not shy
[1:49:18] we love the lord and
[1:49:22] i don't believe anything can harm me
[1:49:25] that's one thing
[1:49:27] i didn't say nothing couldn't test me
[1:49:30] but there's nothing can hurt me
[1:49:33] if god can protect
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:37] the saints of old and boiling oil and
[1:49:41] everything else they had to go through
[1:49:42] it's not my flesh i'm concerned about
[1:49:44] it's my soul
[1:49:46] this is why i'm making confession
[1:49:48] because of my soul i'm not
[1:49:50] i just trust that all of you understand
[1:49:54] and so i made
[1:49:57] i was afraid to make it right publicly
[1:50:00] because my friend
[1:50:01] brother barnes stanley barnes he's going
[1:50:03] to hear this
[1:50:04] and i want to say to him i'm sorry
[1:50:08] he's very fearful for me and anybody
[1:50:11] he found out his mom took it and he just
[1:50:14] really upset him
[1:50:15] [Music]
[1:50:17] when he hears this
[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:34] anyway you love the lord
[1:50:38] let's have a word of prayer and we'll
[1:50:40] have our song
