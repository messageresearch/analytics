[23:38] of you and be with you

[23:43] gathered here this morning we've

[23:46] Jesus Christ amen and we are here to
[23:49] partake of that promise
[23:51] amen what an honor it is to be in the
[23:53] presence of the Most High God Amen I
[23:56] don't know if sometimes we realize
[23:58] exactly what happens when we come into
[24:00] this place hey man we think you know we
[24:03] we tend to sometimes over supernatural
[24:06] eyes everything but we come into this
[24:07] natural building where Jesus gave us a
[24:11] natural promise of a supernatural
[24:15] current just a natural church service
[24:18] that has a supernatural meaning amen
[24:22] there where Christ is right here a man
[24:24] sometimes when we gather into this place
[24:26] we don't realize exactly what's
[24:27] happening that we were actually
[24:29] gathering in his name that Christ comes
[24:31] right in the midst of us amen let's just
[24:34] as we stand let's open our Bibles to
[24:37] Psalms chapter 145
[24:41] I want to spend quite a bit of time
[24:46] today in John chapter 17 later on we'll
[24:50] read through quite a bit of it but for
[24:52] the beginning here let's just go to
[24:54] Psalms 145th Psalm read the 14th through
[24:59] the 16th verse I want to speak a message
[25:04] called the power of crying out to God
[25:07] amen the power of crying out to God Amen
[25:14] 145th psalm start with the fourteenth
[25:17] verse and it says the lord upholdeth all
[25:21] that fall and raise us up all those that
[25:26] be bowed down the eyes of all wait upon
[25:30] thee and now give us them their meat in
[25:33] due season now open the stein hand and
[25:36] satisfy us the desire of every living
[25:40] thing a man let's just power has an
[25:44] order prayer Heavenly Father we just
[25:46] approach unto you this morning Lord
[25:48] given you all the glory and the honor
[25:51] and the praise do unto your name father
[25:53] or as we and gather into this room Lord
[25:56] we quiet ourselves down father we lay
[25:59] aside all the thoughts of the week and
[26:01] all the thoughts of the cares of this
[26:02] world Lord and we just begin to focus
[26:05] upon you lord Lauren we just want to
[26:07] thank you for coming into this place
[26:08] father well we didn't gather out
[26:10] tradition Lord of any other reason or
[26:14] motive or purpose Lord but just together
[26:15] together in your presence Lord and to
[26:18] rejoice around your word that you gave
[26:20] unto us and Laura as we say here Lord
[26:23] underneath your word father we pray that
[26:24] you would open up our hearts father if
[26:27] we've done anything wrong we pray Lord
[26:29] you forgive us if we have sinned father
[26:31] we ask that you would wash us with your
[26:33] blood father and take our iniquities and
[26:36] transgressions away from a slore now we
[26:38] might sit Lord in purity a underneath
[26:41] your gospel father and and and just a
[26:44] complete understanding and rejoicing in
[26:46] your presence we pray you'd break open
[26:48] the word of life to us Lord and that way
[26:51] the only only you can do it Laura like
[26:53] you did on the road
[26:54] to emmaus Lord we pray you'd do it again
[26:56] once more here in our midst and we just
[26:59] think ask all these things and the name
[27:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[27:05] amen you can be seated when I read there
[27:11] in that 145th Psalm it just caught me
[27:18] about how you know the promise of God
[27:21] would uphold those that fall down and if
[27:25] someone is bowed down he would raise
[27:27] them up amen if someone falls down it'll
[27:31] stand them up amen and and you know and
[27:35] part of this it had to do with then we
[27:40] get down to verse 16 he says thou
[27:42] openess 9 hand and you satisfied the
[27:47] desire of every living thing amen and as
[27:52] I read that I began to you know just
[27:53] kind of picture in my mind of a a field
[27:57] or a field or a meadow that is lacking
[28:01] in water you know and how the the plants
[28:05] you know they begin to bow themselves
[28:07] down you know and there and as the but
[28:10] as I said there though satisfies the
[28:13] desire of every living thing you know
[28:16] when when you like you take like a
[28:17] meadow or a place that is beginning to
[28:19] go through a drought or a time of
[28:23] dryness then every living thing begins
[28:26] to cry out to God amen everything that
[28:29] is in the meadow when it begins to lack
[28:31] water no matter what type of plant it is
[28:34] whether it be an animal or a plant or
[28:37] whatever type of life it is when the
[28:39] with the water begins to to go out into
[28:43] a drought season then everything that is
[28:45] living begins to cry out to God
[28:48] everything that is alive begins to just
[28:51] begins crying out what was it doing it's
[28:53] beginning to cry out to water
[28:55] how many remembers you and the Lord told
[28:57] Moses I have heard the cry of my people
[29:01] Amen they've been there in Egypt now for
[29:04] 400 years and they're crying out you
[29:06] know there that would wear its star
[29:08] out where they had a place in Goshen yos
[29:11] well water they had a place that was
[29:13] pretty nice than Egypt and they were
[29:15] rejoicing they had a name where they
[29:17] were the family of Joseph you know in a
[29:20] place of honor in Egypt but as they rose
[29:22] up a pharaoh that didn't know Joseph
[29:24] things began to get pretty tough things
[29:27] began to get pretty rough and then the
[29:29] cries they started out is just a low
[29:32] murmur they meant that the cry just
[29:36] start out as a low murmur but as the
[29:38] times got more or more difficult the
[29:41] cries began to get more stronger and
[29:43] stronger amen amen and we got down to
[29:45] the time of of Moses the children of
[29:49] Israel were crying out unto the Lord
[29:51] their God save us from where we are now
[29:54] why were they crying out because they
[29:57] are beginning to realize that their
[29:59] condition had gotten so far away from
[30:02] what God intended for them back in the
[30:05] beginning amen now is one thing that
[30:07] when they are just a little bit out of
[30:09] the way but now in the time of Moses
[30:12] they've gotten so far away from where
[30:14] God intended them to be and there's just
[30:17] something about their own natural being
[30:19] that they realize it's not supposed to
[30:21] be like this hey man this is not the
[30:24] condition that we're supposed to be in
[30:25] amen a drove a cry down on the inside of
[30:29] them and as the more they cried out unto
[30:32] God the more they cried out in cry out
[30:34] craft and God began to hear them and God
[30:36] set them exactly what they had needed
[30:39] they had need of to be delivered from
[30:42] the condition that they were in amen and
[30:45] now they didn't necessarily know how to
[30:47] be delivered they didn't necessarily
[30:49] know exactly what they needed but they
[30:51] just knew that what the condition that
[30:53] they were in was not the condition that
[30:55] God intended for them to be in amen they
[30:58] may not have considered their known or
[31:00] had the wisdom to think exactly where
[31:02] they wanted to go where they needed to
[31:04] go or what condition they should be in
[31:06] but all they knew how to do exactly was
[31:08] to cry amen
[31:11] that's a good thing to know how to do
[31:12] amen
[31:14] because when you begin when when the
[31:16] things of this earth begin crying out to
[31:19] God God looks back into the beginning
[31:22] what condition are they supposed to be
[31:25] in and what condition are they in now
[31:28] and when God begins to listen to their
[31:31] cry and God refers back to looking into
[31:35] what condition they're supposed to be in
[31:37] and comparing that with the condition
[31:40] that they are in then God begins to look
[31:42] and see what can I do to bring them back
[31:45] to the condition that they're supposed
[31:47] to be amen and when when I consider what
[31:54] the what did the children you know when
[31:56] when I look at Moses God sent them to
[32:00] Moses and the very first thing was was I
[32:02] got I get these guys out of Egypt amen I
[32:06] cannot bless you while you're here in
[32:08] the midst of Egypt I cannot perform my
[32:11] work upon you while you're here in the
[32:13] in the midst of Egypt so the very first
[32:15] thing that God did was he sent Moses to
[32:17] draw them out of that condition amen and
[32:21] to get them up to the mountain a mint
[32:23] where God could reveal himself unto them
[32:26] amen once they got their eyes off of
[32:29] Egypt and got their eyes upon the glory
[32:32] of God that once they saw that glory
[32:35] then they begin to realize that there's
[32:38] something besides Egypt for their lives
[32:41] amen so remember one and what would they
[32:44] do he took him off to that most off to
[32:45] that mountain what they do they saw the
[32:47] glory of God it's parting the Red Sea
[32:49] Amen they saw the glory of God as it was
[32:52] a thick cloud they saw the glory of God
[32:54] as a pillar or a fire they saw the glory
[32:57] of God come down upon the mountain where
[32:59] Joshua and Moses went up into the
[33:01] mountain they saw I remember the it says
[33:03] that the Moses and Aaron and all of his
[33:05] sons went up into the mountain amen and
[33:09] that as they set there and then there
[33:11] are 70 of them that went up with them as
[33:13] they set down there to eat that they saw
[33:15] the Living God of Israel they saw the
[33:18] Living God of the Living God and that
[33:23] scripture always amazes me back there in
[33:25] the Old Testament where they saw a guy
[33:27] there was like 80 people there and they
[33:30] all saw God and they're sitting there
[33:31] community was another God is giving them
[33:35] something
[33:36] first he drew them out of Egypt and
[33:39] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[33:40] restore them back to be in the condition
[33:42] where they were supposed to be Oh what
[33:46] condition of this think about what
[33:47] condition are people supposed to be in
[33:51] honestly what condition or people
[33:54] doesn't matter whether you're in the
[33:55] time of Moses doesn't matter whether
[33:57] you're times of Jesus Christ or today
[33:59] what condition our people are really
[34:02] supposed to be if we were created by the
[34:06] Most High God if we if God has created
[34:09] this earth and God has created people to
[34:11] be on the earth then really what
[34:13] condition where we create here to be a
[34:15] mate well in order to understand that to
[34:18] declare that to figure that out
[34:20] you got to go back a bit to the very
[34:22] beginning if you're ever going to
[34:24] understand the condition that people are
[34:26] supposed to be in what the original
[34:28] design is then you have to go back to
[34:31] the beginning amen you know like we I
[34:35] use the the thing of a meadow when it's
[34:39] lacking in water you know when you take
[34:43] like say a garden and that is well
[34:46] watered and you take the water away from
[34:49] it everything begins to wilt it begins
[34:53] to the flowers begin to fade any beauty
[34:57] that it has begins to fade away and
[34:59] pretty soon it doesn't look anything
[35:02] like whoever designed it intended for it
[35:05] to look like now all the information is
[35:08] there for it to look exactly the way
[35:10] it's supposed to look but because of the
[35:13] lack of the water it can't get to the
[35:15] position that's supposed to be in amen
[35:18] but once you begin adding water back
[35:20] into the garden all sudden things begin
[35:23] springing right back up to the condition
[35:26] that they're supposed to be in you know
[35:28] I was like you know like when my wife
[35:30] cooks a meal you know every whenever you
[35:34] went whenever you walk into a place like
[35:37] say a garden you want to see it in the
[35:41] condition that whoever made that garden
[35:44] had in his mind he when he created that
[35:47] he had something in his mind and that's
[35:49] the condemned
[35:49] and I want to see it a man no one wants
[35:52] to see something this ruined direct they
[35:55] want to see it in the condition that the
[35:58] person who created it wants it to be in
[36:00] you know I was like when my wife makes a
[36:01] meal you know and she makes a meal and
[36:04] she puts everything out on the table and
[36:06] you know and sometimes she'll have some
[36:08] toppings off over here and when you get
[36:10] there to sit down you don't sometimes
[36:12] I'll just I'll grab the first thing I
[36:14] see I'll put it on my plate and if I'm
[36:16] not careful I'll just start eating and
[36:18] also I'll watch her she'll grab
[36:19] something off over here start spreading
[36:22] it on top this should put grab something
[36:24] over here and put it over here and mix
[36:26] it in and I realized that I've been
[36:28] missing out on something because I
[36:30] wasn't paying attention
[36:31] amen I'm not experiencing the meal the
[36:34] way she designed for it to be experience
[36:36] now if my wife is going to make a meal I
[36:38] want to eat it exactly in the way that
[36:42] she had in her mind for it to be a man I
[36:45] want an experience and why because when
[36:47] she cooks a meal I want to experience
[36:49] that meal exactly how she considers it
[36:52] to be cooked now if you know if like so
[36:54] and lays out a bowl of rice and some
[36:56] other things over here and you just grab
[36:57] the rice put it on your plate and begin
[36:59] to eat rice bare rice you're not
[37:02] experiencing the meal the way the cooked
[37:05] experience designed for you to
[37:07] experience it and so it is with my wife
[37:10] when she cooks a meal I want to
[37:12] experience it exactly the way she
[37:14] intends for it to be cooked I think
[37:16] about like like I was reading about the
[37:18] pyramids a while back in Egypt they say
[37:21] that the pyramids used to be coated with
[37:23] these white stones they were a covering
[37:26] stone a covering for the pyramids and
[37:29] then back you know they back about 1500
[37:32] years ago so inside they wanted to take
[37:35] those stones off and go use them to
[37:37] build some other building somewhere else
[37:38] they strip the entire pyramid of it's an
[37:40] outer coating now if you go to look at
[37:42] those pyramids you can never see them
[37:45] the way the build are designed for them
[37:47] to be seen so if I go see the pyramids I
[37:50] feel like I'm missing out on something
[37:52] because I can't see it the way it was
[37:54] designed for it to be I can't see in his
[37:56] full glory the glory that was designed
[37:58] to be in amen
[38:00] and you know and so it is a saint
[38:03] with a Christian if I cannot see a
[38:05] Christian the way God designed for them
[38:08] to be that I feel like I'm missing out
[38:09] on something amen
[38:11] their God designed his people to live in
[38:14] a certain type of way God designed for
[38:16] his his sons and daughters to have
[38:19] certain things in their mind to have
[38:21] certain things that to live a certain
[38:23] way amen so that they would be here on
[38:25] this earth that they not be of the earth
[38:27] amen
[38:28] when God drew the people out of Egypt he
[38:30] had to draw them out of Egypt so they
[38:33] could come and experience his glory amen
[38:35] he wanted to get them over into the
[38:37] promised land so they could begin to
[38:39] experience things the way God wanted
[38:41] them to experience a man what'd he do he
[38:44] took Moses and he showed them a pattern
[38:46] and he began to say whatever you see up
[38:49] in the heavens I want you to recreate
[38:51] that down on the earth a man and that's
[38:54] when he began to create a lamb sacrifice
[38:56] that's when he began to create an altar
[38:59] or man and God kimete that's where he
[39:01] began to create a holy place where God
[39:03] could come down and be amongst his
[39:04] people why because there are things that
[39:06] Moses saw up in the heavens and he was
[39:10] trying to recreate that down on the
[39:12] earth you know that thing is still going
[39:15] on today amen you know that's still
[39:18] supposed to be in place today amen that
[39:21] we are still have the same Commission
[39:23] the Moses had to take things that are up
[39:26] in the heavens amen and recreate them
[39:28] right down here on the earth Amen that
[39:31] Commission still stands here today let
[39:33] us draw her to a John chapter 17 you
[39:41] know if I cannot experience something
[39:43] the way it's supposed to be experienced
[39:45] then you can begin to feel like you're
[39:47] being cheated out of something you know
[39:50] like like go into a 3d movie not putting
[39:53] those 3d glasses on you're missing
[39:56] something you're not seeing it the way
[39:59] it was designed to be seen amen or or be
[40:02] like going to go into a concert and
[40:06] sitting there with your hands over your
[40:08] ears you're not experiencing it the way
[40:11] or what if you go to go to a go to a
[40:14] symphony or an orchestra
[40:16] and next to you is sitting a child as
[40:19] screaming his head off and you want to
[40:23] enjoy the music but you can't when you
[40:25] were getting upset because there's this
[40:27] child screaming over here and you're
[40:29] like I can't experience this the way I
[40:31] wanted to I can't see this or have it
[40:34] listen this Orchestra and it's full
[40:35] glory because of this distraction that's
[40:38] off over here
[40:39] well there's times where you see things
[40:42] in this world that are so beautiful
[40:44] because they're being done exactly the
[40:46] way the designer had them in their mind
[40:49] whether it be a painting or an orchestra
[40:52] or going to see a play any men are going
[40:55] to see a movie that has been well
[40:58] created you know or something like this
[41:00] any time I see something that's been
[41:02] well done and you get to see it exactly
[41:06] way the man that designed it design it
[41:08] then it just it does something to you
[41:10] because you're seeing something that is
[41:12] perfection and there's something about
[41:14] mankind when they see something in its
[41:17] perfection it drives an awe inside of
[41:20] them why because you're seeing something
[41:22] in its full glory you're seeing
[41:23] something exactly the way it's supposed
[41:25] to be seen there's no distractions it's
[41:28] not been tampered with it's not being
[41:30] contaminated but it's in its full beauty
[41:32] and then just it does something to you
[41:34] and you always remember those times when
[41:37] you get to see something in its full
[41:39] glory and even when you go down years
[41:41] and years later you always think back to
[41:43] you I remember the time when I saw this
[41:46] symphony or this Orchestra amen I
[41:48] remember the time when I went out into
[41:50] the mountains and I saw something just
[41:53] the way God created a thousands of years
[41:55] ago amen and you get to see something in
[41:57] its full glory what why it did it
[41:59] creates a certain atmosphere within you
[42:02] that you saw something that was perfect
[42:05] amen and God has still designed us to to
[42:09] be in that condition to where we would
[42:11] enjoy seeing things that are perfect why
[42:13] because we're supposed to be perfect God
[42:16] told tole to command us to be perfect on
[42:19] this earth as your heavenly father in
[42:22] heaven is perfect
[42:23] amen though we on this earth should be
[42:25] complete just like our Heavenly Father
[42:27] is complete
[42:30] man John chapter 17 verse 22 it says and
[42:35] the glory which thou gavest me I have
[42:41] given them that they may be one even as
[42:44] we are one
[42:46] amen the glory so Jesus Christ 2,000
[42:51] years ago when he came to this earth he
[42:54] had a certain glory that was given to
[42:56] him
[42:57] amen and that glory that he had with him
[43:00] was perfect it was complete amen and
[43:04] that glory came from something that he
[43:07] had before with the father before the
[43:09] foundation of the world amen so when
[43:13] Jesus Christ came to the earth he came
[43:16] to a world those in ruins
[43:18] it wasn't perfect it was incomplete it
[43:21] wasn't in the same condition that the
[43:23] designer created to be in amen but the
[43:26] designer came to the earth which was the
[43:29] Lord Jesus Christ and he had in within
[43:32] himself the same glory of perfection
[43:35] that was back at the beginning amen and
[43:38] as he came to this earth every time he
[43:40] ran across things that were not in their
[43:42] original glory he would reach out his
[43:45] hand to change the situation to be back
[43:48] in the original glory amen so that could
[43:50] be back in the glory of the creator'
[43:53] amen and as he is testifying to his
[43:56] disciples he said he's praying he says
[43:59] Lord that the glory which thou gavest me
[44:02] I have now given unto them that they
[44:05] that they might be one just like we are
[44:08] one a man who can deny that when the
[44:11] Lord Jesus Christ was here on the earth
[44:14] though he was not one with the father
[44:16] who could deny that amen when he came to
[44:20] this earth he had a perfect union with
[44:24] his father he had a perfect union with
[44:28] his father amen
[44:30] all he had to do was bow his head and
[44:33] close his eyes and he could be caught
[44:35] talking face to face with this father
[44:37] amen
[44:39] if he ever prayed her prayer he knew
[44:41] where his prayer win amen
[44:43] when he when he saw something on this
[44:46] earth that he wanted to fix he knew he
[44:49] could draw from perfection from before
[44:51] the foundation of the world bring it
[44:53] right to the present time and changed
[44:56] the position of whatever situation he
[44:59] was in and make it just like perfect
[45:01] like it was supposed to be before the
[45:03] foundation of the world amen now what
[45:06] was it before the foundation of the
[45:08] world what happened there was a lamb
[45:10] that was slain before the foundation of
[45:14] the world there were his names were
[45:16] written upon a book of life a man saw
[45:19] God before the foundation of the world
[45:21] wrote down on his book that these names
[45:23] should have life and that they should
[45:25] have it more abundantly
[45:27] amen amen now a Fiat now if any of these
[45:30] names at any one time should fall short
[45:32] of the glory of God as Romans 3:23 says
[45:35] that there would be a lamb that was
[45:37] slain to bring those those names back to
[45:40] the condition that they once were now
[45:42] before the foundation of the world these
[45:44] names are written on the book so that
[45:46] they might have the glory of the life of
[45:48] God amen that was the condition before
[45:51] the foundation of the world and when God
[45:53] began to put these names in the Garden
[45:56] of Eden amens the first the first man
[45:58] the first woman and when they
[46:00] experienced their life
[46:02] life upon the earth everything was
[46:04] perfect they had full power over heaven
[46:07] and earth
[46:08] they were Kings over the earth a man
[46:10] they had Dominion they had all was
[46:12] perfect he meant and they lived in a
[46:14] perfect condition
[46:15] and if they need anything they could ask
[46:18] their Father and he would give it to
[46:19] them amen if they if they wanted to
[46:22] communion with their father all they had
[46:23] to do is bow their heads and ask and
[46:25] they are one with their father there was
[46:27] nothing there was separating them from
[46:29] their father but their father would come
[46:32] and walk with them and talk with him
[46:33] every day that was the condition amen
[46:37] but suddenly when the fall happened it
[46:40] separated man from their original
[46:42] condition amen you know one of the
[46:44] things that brother band said over and
[46:45] over again that strikes me is he says
[46:47] that we'd be restored back to the Garden
[46:49] of Eden again like it was before the
[46:52] fall that's what we were designed to do
[46:54] the message now there were
[46:57] the the the sit when the seals were
[46:59] broke it's here to bring us back to the
[47:02] same condition like we were in the
[47:04] Garden of Eden like it was before the
[47:06] fall and tell you let me tell you if we
[47:09] are missing out on that then we've
[47:10] missed something amen if we have not
[47:13] been restored back then we missed
[47:15] something if God gives us something then
[47:17] why don't we have it it's like that says
[47:20] there in Ephesians that when God
[47:22] ascended up on high he led captivity
[47:24] captive and he gave gifts unto men amen
[47:27] he gave some pastors some teachers amen
[47:30] now as he gave the fifl miss for the
[47:32] people he gave it for a specific purpose
[47:35] it was for the perfecting of the Saints
[47:37] so they can be back in the condition who
[47:40] was like they were before the fall amen
[47:43] and if we are missing that then then
[47:45] we've missed something it's like sitting
[47:47] down at a meal and you're eating the
[47:49] bare rice when you have all these
[47:50] toppings off over here and you're not
[47:52] eating a meal the way the designer had
[47:55] in their mind you're missing the full
[47:57] glory of the meal
[47:59] amen be like going to an orchestra and
[48:02] having a crying baby there you're not
[48:04] experienced in the way the the the
[48:07] conductor had in his mind for you to
[48:09] experience it Amen is so our men and
[48:12] women sons and daughters of the Living
[48:13] God not experiencing life on this earth
[48:17] in the condition that God expected them
[48:20] to experience it Amen when Adam and Eve
[48:23] were placed here on the earth they
[48:24] experienced life and life more
[48:26] abundantly
[48:28] amen and so should you and if you're not
[48:31] then you're missing something
[48:33] amen now first before God could get the
[48:36] children of Israel to experience the
[48:39] life that he gave unto Abraham he first
[48:42] had to draw them out of Egypt amen he
[48:44] had to show them the slain lamb he had
[48:46] to show them the power that could split
[48:48] the Red Sea he had to show them the
[48:50] power that could split the river Jordan
[48:52] amen and once they fully experienced his
[48:54] power I want to say it fully experienced
[48:57] his glory and fully experienced his
[48:59] forgiveness then they could really enter
[49:02] into the Promised Land and begin to
[49:03] experience it the way God expected them
[49:05] to experience a man you know Caleb had
[49:08] that had that revelation and that's why
[49:10] he said
[49:11] your mouth give me my Mountain you gave
[49:13] it to me and I'm here to experience it
[49:16] exactly how you want me to experience it
[49:18] Amen now if you don't have that
[49:20] experience and you're missing something
[49:22] you're sitting at the meal but all
[49:24] you're doing is eating the bare rice why
[49:26] because you're not experienced life and
[49:29] life more abundantly yours you're
[49:33] missing something let me tell you if you
[49:35] go through this life just staring at
[49:37] your cell phone all day you're missing
[49:39] something then amen if you go through
[49:41] life loving the world or the things in
[49:43] the world let me tell you you're missing
[49:45] something
[49:46] amen if you go through life and you've
[49:48] never been convicted of your sins I want
[49:51] to tell you something that you've gone
[49:53] to the movies but your worth you have
[49:55] your blindfold on you sit down at the
[49:58] meal but all you're eating is bear write
[49:59] a menu you went to to the to the
[50:04] vineyard where the best wine has ever
[50:06] been create and all your drinking is
[50:08] water amen you are missing something
[50:11] amen if you have never experienced the
[50:15] Lord Jesus Christ in his majesty if you
[50:17] have never been filled with the Holy
[50:19] Ghost then then you're just eating bare
[50:21] rice because you have never experienced
[50:26] the majesty of the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:31] if anybody that has ever traveled and
[50:35] gone to say a mountain meadow or or
[50:39] climb the been to a place is just so
[50:42] scenic it takes your breath away let me
[50:45] tell you that is what your the condition
[50:47] your Christian life is supposed to be
[50:48] and if you do not have that you've
[50:50] missed something amen when Jesus Christ
[50:53] ascended up on high he led captivity
[50:55] captive so if you are captive to
[50:58] something then you're missing the whole
[51:01] reason why Christ came amen and if you
[51:04] have not been perfected then you're then
[51:07] you have been the if you don't have a
[51:09] pastor then you're missing a gift that
[51:12] God gave you God gave you something and
[51:14] you're missing it amen now let me tell
[51:17] you if God gives me something I want to
[51:19] have it Amen it's just like the when
[51:22] they came out of Egypt a lot of them
[51:24] well
[51:25] almost everybody that came out of Egypt
[51:26] all they got to experience was the dry
[51:28] sand of the desert now I want you to
[51:33] think about that real plainly real
[51:35] clearly almost everybody that came out
[51:38] of Egypt came out underneath the power
[51:40] of God and all they got to experience
[51:42] was a dry desert sandy place and so it
[51:47] was the same is true in the Church of
[51:49] the Most High God now let me tell you
[51:52] was that what they were supposed to
[51:54] experience no God had a land that he
[51:59] wanted to bring them to amen God had a
[52:02] place that he is trying to get the
[52:04] people to but because they couldn't get
[52:07] themselves extracted from Egypt enough
[52:10] they couldn't experience what God had in
[52:12] their mind a man you know that Ark of
[52:15] the Covenant was never designed to be
[52:17] dragged around the desert for 40 years
[52:20] it was not what it was meant for they
[52:23] built the Ark of the Covenant but once
[52:25] they built it God would rich the glory
[52:28] of God showed up over the Ark of the
[52:30] Covenant but then they just dragged it
[52:32] around the desert for 40 years the place
[52:35] where the glory of God would come and
[52:37] soda and they dry it it was meant to be
[52:39] taken right to the river Jordan pass on
[52:41] through and go and take over under the
[52:43] power of God be it because they couldn't
[52:47] get their eyes off Egypt and the things
[52:48] of Egypt they could never experience the
[52:51] power of God the way it was supposed to
[52:54] be experienced amen and God has a glory
[52:58] as we've read there in John 17 the glory
[53:01] that thou has given me Christ did have a
[53:03] glory amen
[53:05] he had a glory when he came to this
[53:07] world Jesus Christ had a glory amen that
[53:11] heum his father were one and every time
[53:14] he saw a situation there was contrary to
[53:17] the glory of God all he had to do is
[53:19] touch it all I had to do is speak to it
[53:21] all he had to do is pray about it and it
[53:23] would be changed exactly the way he
[53:25] designed for it to be changed and now
[53:27] that same glory that he had from the
[53:30] Creator he has now given unto them the
[53:33] disciples why that they might be one
[53:35] even as we are one
[53:37] so now here
[53:38] it's beginning to express into the
[53:40] disciples that his idea what he had in
[53:43] his mind was not just the him himself
[53:46] would have the glory of God but now that
[53:49] the disciples would also have the glory
[53:51] of God and be able to go out as
[53:53] emissaries and do the same thing Jesus
[53:55] Christ did what a promise let's go back
[53:59] to John 17 as I want in this second half
[54:03] of the sermon I want to begin going
[54:05] through Psalm 17 we're gonna read
[54:06] several of these verses amen and just
[54:09] gonna go through one by one because as
[54:12] Jesus is coming to the end of his
[54:14] ministry on the earth he prayed this
[54:18] prayer over his disciples I want to
[54:21] think about that very clearly Jesus
[54:23] Christ have been with his disciples
[54:25] three and a half years he's coming to
[54:27] the very end of his ministry amen to
[54:30] where he's going to be he's gonna he's
[54:32] not going to just leave them without a
[54:34] witness but they're gonna no longer be
[54:36] able to see him with their natural eyes
[54:39] amen and so as the end of that ministry
[54:42] is coming on the earth here he he prays
[54:44] this prayer as John 17 1 or we'll read
[54:48] the first three verses here it says and
[54:52] these words spake Jesus and lifted up
[54:56] his eyes to heaven and said father the
[54:58] hour has come glorify thy son that thy
[55:03] son also may glorify thee as thou has
[55:06] given him power over all flesh that he
[55:09] should give eternal life to as many as
[55:11] thou has given him and this is life
[55:15] eternal that they may know thee the only
[55:18] true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has
[55:21] sent amen now that prayer that same
[55:27] pattern is to recreate itself over and
[55:31] over and over again throughout the
[55:34] entire church age amen
[55:36] that the same pattern that Moses saw
[55:39] would now be recreated us amen that
[55:41] those had their names written upon the
[55:43] Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation
[55:45] of the world that those same ones amen
[55:48] we experience life have it more
[55:49] abundantly
[55:50] they experience forgiveness for their
[55:52] amen they'd be pulled out of Egypt
[55:54] everything they've ever been done if
[55:56] they've ever done wrong will be forgiven
[55:57] them and that they could have their eyes
[55:59] taken away from the things that are
[56:01] natural amen and they began to
[56:03] experience the glory of God amen they
[56:07] would be like Moses standing on top of
[56:09] the mountain
[56:10] amen they'd be like the children of
[56:11] Israel staying at the Red Sea when they
[56:14] washed the waters part what are they
[56:16] doing they're getting their eyes off the
[56:17] world and beginning to experience the
[56:19] power of the Almighty God amen amen
[56:23] father I pray Lord that that that they
[56:30] would hear amen and this is a verse week
[56:36] and this is life eternal that they might
[56:38] know thee the only true God and Jesus
[56:41] Christ whom thou has sent a man verse
[56:44] four I have glorified thee on the earth
[56:46] I finished the work that thou gavest me
[56:48] to do now who can deny that we that in
[56:51] the ministry of Jesus Christ we saw the
[56:53] power of the Almighty God amen
[56:56] everywhere he went
[56:57] there was nothing was beholden from
[57:00] nothing everything was in his power he
[57:03] could do anything that if the father
[57:06] showed him something he could do it
[57:08] amen the glory of the Father was shown
[57:10] to him perfectly he meant
[57:12] now let's going on to verse four and
[57:14] five it says I have glorified thee on
[57:17] the work on the earth I have finished
[57:19] the work that the hell gave us me to do
[57:21] watch this on verse five
[57:23] oh now Oh father glorify thou me with
[57:27] thine own self with the glory which I
[57:30] had with thee before the world was
[57:34] so Jesus Christ is standing here in the
[57:37] natural body on the earth he's looking
[57:39] back to before the foundation of the
[57:42] world he's crying out Lord take that
[57:46] glory that I had with you before the
[57:48] foundation of the world and bring it and
[57:51] set it upon me just now a man died might
[57:55] be filled with the exact same glory that
[57:57] had with thee before the foundation of
[57:58] the world what's he crying out boys cry
[58:00] out for the perfection he's crying out
[58:02] for the same majesty the same power
[58:04] whatever he was supposed to
[58:06] back then that he did have back then now
[58:08] that here in the midst of a natural
[58:10] world if you look around all you see is
[58:13] a natural room made with natural walls
[58:16] amen and natural people sitting there in
[58:18] the room but that those now those
[58:21] natural people will begin to experience
[58:23] something that was from before the
[58:26] foundation of the world that that same
[58:28] glory would now come down into that room
[58:30] come into that body and fill that body
[58:32] with the Holy Ghost to fill that body
[58:34] with the creation fill that body was
[58:36] exactly whatever God had in his mind for
[58:39] the beginning that now be recreated
[58:42] there amen amen because you know in the
[58:46] fall took place it ruined everything
[58:49] there is nothing that the fall didn't
[58:52] touch when the fall took place when Adam
[58:55] and Eve sinned a man when the fall took
[58:58] place it ruined everything on the earth
[59:01] there was nothing there wasn't ruined
[59:04] there was nothing there wasn't tight
[59:06] hampered with there was nothing that
[59:08] wasn't touched but now in this little
[59:10] upper room there is a man by the name of
[59:13] the Lord Jesus Christ a God man and He
[59:17] is calling out he is crying out for
[59:20] something for a glory that was way back
[59:22] before the fall to come down into the
[59:25] natural and to enter into that room and
[59:28] to fill the natural with the
[59:31] supernatural he's crying for now do you
[59:34] think it happened do you think Jesus's
[59:37] prayer was answered amen all power in
[59:40] heaven and earth is given unto me he
[59:41] said amen
[59:43] now let's keep going
[59:46] let's go down to verse 13 and 14 they're
[59:50] still in this Upper Room here amen he's
[59:53] cried out for the power from before the
[59:55] foundation of the world to come and fill
[59:56] him a man he's still praying unto the
[59:58] father and he says in verse 13 and now
[1:00:02] come I to thee he's getting ready to
[1:00:06] leave them amen and these things I speak
[1:00:09] in the world right there in the natural
[1:00:12] world the world that's been ruined by
[1:00:13] the fall these things I speak in the
[1:00:16] world that they might have my joy
[1:00:20] filled in themselves I have given them
[1:00:23] thy word and the world has hated them
[1:00:26] because they are not of the world even
[1:00:29] as I am NOT of the world so now these
[1:00:33] disciples are beginning to be separated
[1:00:36] from the world just like the shore of
[1:00:39] Israel being separated from Egypt Damon
[1:00:41] they're being separated from the world
[1:00:46] and he's beginning to declare unto Him
[1:00:48] they're just like I am not of the world
[1:00:52] so are you not of this world well that's
[1:00:57] a powerful thing because if you are in
[1:00:59] that room look at him they would look
[1:01:00] like natural men amen they look they
[1:01:03] have hands like we have hands they have
[1:01:05] faces like we have faces they're sitting
[1:01:08] there at a natural table amen they're
[1:01:10] sitting there in a room with stone walls
[1:01:12] but here is a man by a god man by the
[1:01:15] name of Lord Jesus Christ he wasn't born
[1:01:18] he didn't just come from Mary amen
[1:01:21] but he came from the holy powerful
[1:01:24] eternal Holy Ghost amen and now he is
[1:01:27] saying that the power that came back
[1:01:29] from before the foundation of the world
[1:01:30] has now come down into that room inside
[1:01:33] of him that the glory that he had with
[1:01:36] the father before the foundation of the
[1:01:37] world has now come down inside of him
[1:01:40] amen and now this same eternal one is
[1:01:42] crying out and he's saying Lord I these
[1:01:45] things I'm speaking here in the ruined
[1:01:47] earth that they might have my joy
[1:01:49] fulfilled also inside of them and that
[1:01:53] they I have given them thy world and now
[1:01:55] I'm now that they are not of the world
[1:01:58] even as I am NOT of the world amen
[1:02:00] now he is taking them these natural 12th
[1:02:03] he's separating them away from the world
[1:02:05] and joining them to himself amen the
[1:02:09] all-powerful Almighty God in flesh is
[1:02:11] taking 12 natural men separating them
[1:02:14] away from the world the things of the
[1:02:16] world and joining them to himself
[1:02:18] Amen so the same joy that when Jesus the
[1:02:21] joy Jesus Christ said when he said
[1:02:23] Lazarus come forth that same joy he's
[1:02:28] now giving to them
[1:02:30] whatever joy he had in the world where
[1:02:33] he could speak to the natural situations
[1:02:35] and make supernatural things happen that
[1:02:37] same joy is now given to them amen the
[1:02:40] same joy where Jesus could reach back
[1:02:42] before the fall and draw from things
[1:02:45] before the fall and enjoy those things
[1:02:47] now he's given that same joy unto these
[1:02:50] 12 amen let's keep going let's go into
[1:02:54] verse 15 through 19 he says I pray not
[1:03:00] that thou should take them out of the
[1:03:01] world but that thou should keep them
[1:03:04] from the evil praise God
[1:03:08] so it's not that work just going to be
[1:03:10] so supernatural that God's taking us up
[1:03:13] out of the world but he's praying that
[1:03:14] we could be here in the world but
[1:03:16] somehow be separated from all the wicked
[1:03:19] and evil things of this world and let me
[1:03:21] tell you if you have not experienced
[1:03:22] that you're missing something you're not
[1:03:25] eating the meal that God designed for
[1:03:28] you to eat Amen you're missing something
[1:03:32] verse 16 they are not of the world even
[1:03:36] s just like even as I am NOT of the
[1:03:40] world so in the same way that the Lord
[1:03:46] Jesus Christ was not of the world now
[1:03:51] these are not of the world now they
[1:03:54] didn't go through the virgin birth or
[1:03:56] did they when they're born again of the
[1:04:00] Holy Ghost they went through the virgin
[1:04:02] birth with him why because they died to
[1:04:04] themselves and they were born again amen
[1:04:08] when you have the born against perience
[1:04:10] now you're in the world but not of the
[1:04:13] world you are in the world like Jesus
[1:04:14] Christ was a man why because you're no
[1:04:17] longer born of your natural parents
[1:04:19] you're giving given power to become sons
[1:04:22] and daughters of God and if you haven't
[1:04:25] experienced that you're missing
[1:04:26] something God gave you something but you
[1:04:29] even miss it you have an inheritance but
[1:04:31] you haven't grabbed it amen
[1:04:33] God gave you a gift but you haven't
[1:04:35] opened it yet
[1:04:36] amen you have an inheritance but you
[1:04:38] haven't cashed the check yet Amen God
[1:04:41] gave you something you're missing it
[1:04:42] you're not experiencing the meal like to
[1:04:45] cook intended for you to experience it
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:51] they are verse 16 they're not of the
[1:04:54] world even as I am NOT of the world
[1:04:56] verse 17 through 19 or says sanctify
[1:05:01] them through thy truth thy Word is truth
[1:05:04] as thou has sent me into the world even
[1:05:07] so have I sent them into the world and
[1:05:10] for their sakes I sanctify themselves
[1:05:13] that they also might be sanctified
[1:05:16] through the truth
[1:05:18] amen so now that verse 18 look at that
[1:05:21] just the same way as thou sent me into
[1:05:24] the world even so if I sent them amen so
[1:05:27] now those that had their names on the
[1:05:29] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:05:30] foundation of the world and the land
[1:05:32] that was slain for those names before
[1:05:34] the foundation of the world are being
[1:05:35] pulled off the Lamb's Book of Life amen
[1:05:38] set down into the world and living here
[1:05:41] in natural bodies but they're being
[1:05:42] separated away from the wickedness and
[1:05:44] the evil world and they're being given
[1:05:46] the glory of God the same glory that
[1:05:50] Jesus Christ had with the Father from
[1:05:52] before the foundation of the world and
[1:05:54] is now in dwelling not just Jesus Christ
[1:05:57] but these same twelve they were with him
[1:05:59] my what a blessing how'd you like to
[1:06:04] have been there we are there amen we
[1:06:10] that same opportunities been laid set
[1:06:12] before every single one of us amen now
[1:06:17] let's keep going verse 20
[1:06:24] neither pray I for these alone but for
[1:06:29] them also which shall believe on me
[1:06:31] through their word amen now I think
[1:06:34] we're getting to our present day
[1:06:36] condition Amen I have heard the word
[1:06:38] that these disciples preached I heard it
[1:06:41] I believed it and now I am experience it
[1:06:44] amen amen
[1:06:47] neither pray I for these alone but for
[1:06:49] them also which shall believe on me
[1:06:51] through their word that they made all
[1:06:54] that they all may be one as thou father
[1:06:57] are in me and I in thee that they also
[1:07:00] may be one in us that the world may
[1:07:03] believe that thou has sent me amen
[1:07:06] so now we've been separated from the
[1:07:08] world we've been sanctified from the
[1:07:10] world
[1:07:11] we're being removed from the world and
[1:07:13] now what we're becoming one with the
[1:07:15] Father even just like Jesus Christ was
[1:07:18] one with the father on the earth
[1:07:19] we've been filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:07:22] now we can begin to experience life like
[1:07:27] it was before the fall why because we've
[1:07:29] been filled with the glory of God amen
[1:07:32] and if we have if you have not
[1:07:34] experienced that you're missing
[1:07:36] something that was given to you amen you
[1:07:40] can come to this church all day long
[1:07:42] amen every day in day out but if you
[1:07:45] still love the world love the things of
[1:07:46] the world you are missing something
[1:07:48] you're missing something God designed
[1:07:51] you to live here like you were in the
[1:07:54] Garden of Eden before the fall and all
[1:07:56] power in heaven earth has been given
[1:07:58] unto you to have that experience and
[1:08:00] amen but because of the blindness of
[1:08:03] this age it is so easy for Christians to
[1:08:06] lose sight of that amen and the only way
[1:08:08] to get back to seeing that is through
[1:08:10] Communion and fellowship with him amen
[1:08:13] he's still here he has not left himself
[1:08:15] with our witness amen and there are men
[1:08:18] and women that are experiencing life on
[1:08:21] this earth in the Garden of Eden like it
[1:08:24] was before the fall and if you don't
[1:08:28] have that experience you're missing
[1:08:29] something
[1:08:29] amen
[1:08:32] nobody likes to miss out amen
[1:08:36] nobody likes to miss out on something
[1:08:44] amen verse 22 and the glory which thou
[1:08:50] gavest me I have given them that they
[1:08:55] may be one even as we are one yeah you
[1:09:03] know Jesus Christ one day he told his
[1:09:06] disciples I beheld Satan falling from
[1:09:12] heaven like a bolt of lightning you know
[1:09:20] Jesus Christ knew exactly who Satan was
[1:09:23] he knew exactly everything that he had
[1:09:27] done he knew the power of the Satan had
[1:09:30] over the earth and yet when he came to
[1:09:32] this earth he knew exactly the power of
[1:09:34] the slip Satan was powerless amen when
[1:09:37] he took away the power of Satan he knew
[1:09:40] what kin did what he was placing us into
[1:09:43] amen that he said remember when the when
[1:09:46] when the disciples came back her choice
[1:09:48] and they said oh look even the Devils
[1:09:50] are subject unto us name you know unto
[1:09:53] us he says don't just rejoice because
[1:09:54] the Devils are subject unto you look I
[1:09:57] even saw Satan falling down from him but
[1:09:59] I want you to rejoice that your names
[1:10:01] were written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:10:04] and before the foundation of the world
[1:10:05] amen because once you begin to realize
[1:10:08] who you are
[1:10:09] amen and the place the inheritance
[1:10:12] you've been given then all power in
[1:10:14] heaven is and devils mean nothing to you
[1:10:17] as jesus says i cast out devils with the
[1:10:21] finger of god my you know you know jesus
[1:10:25] did not jump up and down when he was
[1:10:27] casting out Devils he didn't scream and
[1:10:30] you know I I wouldn't I grew up in
[1:10:32] Pentecost amen and when I see the way
[1:10:36] some people cast out Devils you can tell
[1:10:39] that they're doing it from a hope so
[1:10:42] they're doing it from like I hope this
[1:10:44] works
[1:10:45] oh boy I sure hope this happens and
[1:10:48] maybe if I scream a little louder that
[1:10:50] Devil might come out or maybe if I just
[1:10:52] pray a little bit if ice scream for
[1:10:54] another hour this devil might come out
[1:10:57] and you realize that they don't know who
[1:11:00] they are they don't know the power they
[1:11:02] have that they're just doing they're
[1:11:04] like the sons of sceva they're taking
[1:11:06] the experience of another and hoping
[1:11:09] that it will work for them
[1:11:11] and there's nothing like I just cannot
[1:11:14] stand watching Devils laugh to
[1:11:17] themselves in the middle of a church
[1:11:18] service because they're the people
[1:11:21] praying have no power inside of
[1:11:23] themselves hey man I've seen that before
[1:11:25] and I just it just something that that
[1:11:28] that just drives me up a wall when I see
[1:11:30] Satan comfortable in a church service
[1:11:33] because he knows that he is sheltered
[1:11:36] from any power than anybody might have
[1:11:38] because of the unbelief Amen or the sins
[1:11:41] of the people that's just something that
[1:11:43] drives a minister up a wall when he sees
[1:11:45] that Amen I remember seeing that down in
[1:11:49] South America once when we were we were
[1:11:51] praying and you you'd see people come up
[1:11:53] and and and they would be you know
[1:11:57] people would pray over them and shout
[1:12:00] over them and you know they'd look like
[1:12:01] they were delivered they'd fall
[1:12:02] backwards their eyes and roll up they'd
[1:12:04] be riding around on the ground and
[1:12:06] they'll sudden they get quiet and they
[1:12:07] get up and you'd know in your heart that
[1:12:08] person was not delivered you know but
[1:12:13] date but Satan always likes to sin a
[1:12:15] diversion into the service so he can
[1:12:17] attract the attention of everybody so
[1:12:19] eat so then said the Holy Spirit getting
[1:12:21] the attention now the devil is getting
[1:12:23] the attention Amen it's not supposed to
[1:12:25] be that way
[1:12:26] Amen it's not supposed to be that way
[1:12:30] Amen but we are called to have the same
[1:12:34] glory that we could be one with each
[1:12:37] other and one with God this in the exact
[1:12:39] same way that Jesus Christ was one with
[1:12:42] the father when he was on here on the
[1:12:43] earth in the same way amen
[1:12:48] it's possible that's the thing about it
[1:12:51] is it's possible
[1:12:54] aim as we read there back in the
[1:12:56] beginning lord upholdeth all that fall
[1:13:01] he raiseth up all those that be bound
[1:13:03] down amen verse 16 has said thou open a
[1:13:07] thine hand and satisfies the desire of
[1:13:10] every living thing so if there is a
[1:13:15] living thing somewhere the word is in
[1:13:18] his DNA but because of a lack of water
[1:13:21] or a lack of nutrients that that plant
[1:13:25] cannot express the fullness of what DNA
[1:13:29] is says it's supposed to express was you
[1:13:32] it begins to cry out why because it's
[1:13:34] lacking something it can't it can't have
[1:13:37] it can't express what's supposed to
[1:13:39] express the DNA the DNA is there to - to
[1:13:43] know what a perfect plant is supposed to
[1:13:45] look like amen but because of a lack of
[1:13:48] water because of a lack of nutrients it
[1:13:52] can't be what's supposed to be then it
[1:13:54] begins to cry out a man as sore as a
[1:13:57] Christian Amen when you read this book
[1:13:59] when you read the Bible and you realize
[1:14:02] that's written in your DNA to be
[1:14:04] perfected it's written in your DNA that
[1:14:06] all that the power that was given unto
[1:14:09] the Lord Jesus Christ that the same
[1:14:10] works that you were supposed to do when
[1:14:12] you realize that's written in your DNA
[1:14:14] and you look down in your life and
[1:14:16] you're like I don't have it when you
[1:14:19] begin to realize that you don't have the
[1:14:21] overcoming Christian life Amen when you
[1:14:23] realize that you love the world or the
[1:14:25] things of the world a man when you
[1:14:27] realize that you're bored and coming
[1:14:28] into church when you realize that you
[1:14:30] you don't enjoy coming to church and you
[1:14:32] wish you could then your life begins to
[1:14:35] cry out a many being the more you cry
[1:14:38] out the closer you are to getting the
[1:14:41] inheritance that you're supposed to have
[1:14:42] in the beginning Amen why because God
[1:14:44] has an inheritance for you Amen God was
[1:14:48] praying to the Father amen that the same
[1:14:50] glory that he had that you would have
[1:14:53] Amen and that he was praying to the
[1:14:55] Father at the same power that the same
[1:14:58] overcoming power Amen - he had now that
[1:15:02] you had Amen he had this little prayer
[1:15:05] meeting in this upper room aim
[1:15:07] as they are sitting there in a natural
[1:15:09] it's just a natural room like we are
[1:15:12] today Amen with walls that were built by
[1:15:15] natural hands Amen or roof this place
[1:15:19] Sarabhai by natural men but yet this man
[1:15:22] this god man the Lord Jesus Christ began
[1:15:25] crying out unto the Father amen
[1:15:29] sitting there in a natural setting with
[1:15:31] natural friends natural disciples they
[1:15:33] meant but he begins crying out for
[1:15:36] something that was given unto him before
[1:15:39] the foundation of the world and the
[1:15:42] thing is is it actually happen
[1:15:44] he said glorify thou me glorify me with
[1:15:48] the same glory that I had with you
[1:15:50] before the foundation of the world and
[1:15:51] every single one of us was given a glory
[1:15:54] before the foundation of the world if
[1:15:56] your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:15:57] it's yours it belongs to you it's
[1:16:02] written in your DNA your spiritual DNA
[1:16:06] it's written in you it's an inheritance
[1:16:08] that belongs to you amen and if it's
[1:16:11] just lacking the moisture if it's just
[1:16:14] lacking the proper soil it begins to cry
[1:16:16] out unto God Lord fill me with that
[1:16:19] glory that I had with you before the
[1:16:22] foundation of the world whatever it is
[1:16:24] that you had in your mind for me to be
[1:16:26] that's what I want to be Laura what when
[1:16:28] you are dying upon that cross and you
[1:16:31] are thinking about me as you are dying
[1:16:33] Laura what did you have why did you die
[1:16:36] for me what were you trying to restore
[1:16:38] me back to you when you were dying on
[1:16:40] the cross that's what I want to be
[1:16:42] whatever you had in mind Lord when you
[1:16:44] were thinking about me on the cross
[1:16:45] that's what I want to be when you wrote
[1:16:48] my name upon the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:16:49] Lord when you wrote down all that I
[1:16:52] would be all of my potential everything
[1:16:54] that I would do everything that I would
[1:16:56] say what I was supposed to be here on
[1:16:58] the earth Lord that's what I want to be
[1:17:00] Amen because if I can't fulfill that I'm
[1:17:03] missing something a man if I can't be
[1:17:06] what God designed me to be then I'm
[1:17:08] missing something and I don't want to
[1:17:10] miss out on anything that God has for me
[1:17:13] to be amen I don't think anybody does
[1:17:17] amen I want to experience this life
[1:17:21] exactly how the Creator intended me to
[1:17:25] experience it I don't want to miss one
[1:17:28] thing I want the fullness of the glory
[1:17:31] of God on the inside of me I don't want
[1:17:33] to miss anything I don't want to miss
[1:17:34] out on anything
[1:17:35] if God has something for me it's my
[1:17:37] inheritance it's mine I claim it I cry
[1:17:40] out for it and here standing in a
[1:17:43] natural room I say Lord fill me with the
[1:17:45] glory that I had with you before the
[1:17:48] foundation of the world fill me with the
[1:17:50] glory that I had with you and you wrote
[1:17:52] my name upon the book Lord fill me with
[1:17:54] the glory that I had with you when you
[1:17:56] said that if you fall short of the glory
[1:17:58] of God that I will restore that glory
[1:18:01] back to you
[1:18:02] amen amen
[1:18:06] why because it's possible that's the
[1:18:09] thing about it is is it's possible
[1:18:11] amen why because Jesus Christ came to
[1:18:14] the natural earth and he prayed this
[1:18:16] prayer in this natural earth so that we
[1:18:19] might have his prayer answered in our
[1:18:22] lives he meant let's keep going let's go
[1:18:26] down to verse verse 24 he says father I
[1:18:34] will that they also whom thou has given
[1:18:38] me be with me where I am now when he
[1:18:46] prayed that prayer he was in a natural
[1:18:48] room with him but that's not what he was
[1:18:49] speaking with he was standing in
[1:18:51] perfection with the father they meant he
[1:18:54] was standing in glory with the father a
[1:18:56] man he says I wants them to be with me
[1:18:58] right where I am
[1:18:59] amen that they may behold my glory which
[1:19:09] thou has given me for thou lovest me
[1:19:12] before the foundation of the world hey
[1:19:15] man you all reminds me of the time when
[1:19:16] Elijah was standing there and he said O
[1:19:19] Lord I pray you would open get Hayes's
[1:19:22] eyes hey man why so that so they so that
[1:19:26] Elijah's servant even though he is
[1:19:28] standing right there with him
[1:19:31] behold the glory of their amen he
[1:19:35] couldn't behold the glory of where they
[1:19:37] were standing here the servant was
[1:19:39] looking at all the enemies surrounding
[1:19:41] them hey men and here the Prophet is
[1:19:43] looking at the power of God all over the
[1:19:46] place two different visions Lord I pray
[1:19:49] that you would give my servant a haze'
[1:19:51] the power to stand here and view and see
[1:19:55] be with me right where I'm standing
[1:19:57] where I'm standing by BK hey Z even
[1:19:59] though he was standing physically where
[1:20:01] he was standing was a staying especially
[1:20:03] and now when Jesus Christ was on the
[1:20:06] earth he had the glory of God amen he
[1:20:09] knew that all power in heaven and earth
[1:20:11] was given unto him amen and that that
[1:20:13] same power he had now to give unto
[1:20:15] others and he said Lord I pray Lord that
[1:20:18] these standing here would stand with me
[1:20:22] Amen father I will that they also whom
[1:20:26] thou has given me be with me where I am
[1:20:29] that they may behold my glory which thou
[1:20:32] hast given me for thou lovest me before
[1:20:35] the foundation of the world you know
[1:20:37] brother band said the true Christian is
[1:20:39] a mystic to the world is a mystic to the
[1:20:43] world why is that it's because they're
[1:20:46] always standing between two worlds
[1:20:50] they're here
[1:20:51] standing on the earth but the whole time
[1:20:54] they have this heavenly vision where
[1:20:56] they're always looking up something the
[1:20:58] spirit is showing them a man the
[1:21:00] following the leadership of the Holy
[1:21:02] Ghost amen
[1:21:03] a man has led of the Holy Ghost is like
[1:21:06] the wind
[1:21:06] nobody knows where he comes from nobody
[1:21:08] knows where he's going why because he's
[1:21:10] being led by the Holy Ghost you never
[1:21:12] know what a man like that is gonna do
[1:21:14] next because he's being led by the Holy
[1:21:16] Spirit amen and so it's supposed to be
[1:21:19] with every true Christian Amen you're to
[1:21:21] be led by the Holy Ghost Lord what would
[1:21:24] you like to do today amen
[1:21:27] Lord as I get myself up this morning I'm
[1:21:29] submitting myself to you for service and
[1:21:32] making myself available to the Holy
[1:21:34] Ghost
[1:21:35] Lord Lord if I've done anything wrong
[1:21:37] though it that would stop me from being
[1:21:39] to commune with you perfectly Lord I
[1:21:41] repent of it Lord forgive me and Lord
[1:21:43] I'm reporting here for do
[1:21:45] Lord what would you like to do today
[1:21:47] amen reporting for service being
[1:21:49] available amen
[1:21:51] David why so the glory of God you're
[1:21:53] standing there amen
[1:21:55] where Jesus Christ stood not beholding
[1:21:57] the natural things of where you're at
[1:21:58] but looking at the heavenly amen
[1:22:01] breaking into the heavenly to see where
[1:22:03] we're at as brother Brown said amen
[1:22:09] out of lujah verse 25
[1:22:20] Oh righteous father the world hath not
[1:22:23] known thee and that is true they're
[1:22:28] going on about their daily lives but
[1:22:30] they don't know amen but I have known
[1:22:33] thee and these have known that thou has
[1:22:40] sent me now their understanding was
[1:22:44] being opened that the almighty invisible
[1:22:48] God had sent the Lord Jesus Christ to
[1:22:51] the earth
[1:22:51] he didn't come of his own will amen but
[1:22:54] he came of the will of the Father the
[1:22:57] centum amen and as their understanding
[1:22:59] is being open to this and beginning to
[1:23:02] realize that the man staying before them
[1:23:04] was not just a natural man it was a god
[1:23:06] man amen
[1:23:07] he was not just born of Mary and Joseph
[1:23:09] Amen but he was born of the Holy Spirit
[1:23:12] born of Almighty God and began to
[1:23:15] realize that this was not a natural man
[1:23:17] but this was Jesus Christ the Son of the
[1:23:20] Most High God and as their understanding
[1:23:22] was beginning to open being open to that
[1:23:24] as he is opening their understanding he
[1:23:27] looks like this says and the power that
[1:23:28] God has given me before the foundation
[1:23:31] of the world I am now giving unto you
[1:23:33] the same glory that I had with the
[1:23:35] father before the foundation the world
[1:23:36] I'm now giving unto you and the same
[1:23:39] place that I am standing right now in
[1:23:41] heavenly places of the Father now I'm
[1:23:43] giving you the ability to stand there
[1:23:45] with me amen and now the same parentage
[1:23:50] the same lineage that I have to where I
[1:23:52] was not born of of Mary about whose womb
[1:23:55] that I came but I was actually was born
[1:23:58] of the Holy Ghost before the foundation
[1:24:00] of the world now I'm given that same
[1:24:02] power unto you a man is even though as
[1:24:04] John the Baptist said the one that the
[1:24:08] angel told John the Baptist the one that
[1:24:10] you see the Holy Spirit descending upon
[1:24:12] and remaining upon that is the one that
[1:24:15] is going to baptize with the Holy Ghost
[1:24:17] that is a little lamb that was slain
[1:24:19] before the foundation of the world that
[1:24:21] is one that is going to cleanse the men
[1:24:23] of God from their sins now that same one
[1:24:26] is telling them that same Holy Ghost
[1:24:28] that descended upon me and remained is
[1:24:32] now going to
[1:24:33] from heaven upon you and remain so wait
[1:24:36] here until you be endued with power from
[1:24:38] on high because it's going to come unto
[1:24:40] you amen and now though all those that
[1:24:43] had believed on him have the same
[1:24:46] ability that the same Holy Ghost be sent
[1:24:49] unto you amen
[1:24:52] o righteous father the world hath not
[1:24:56] known thee but I have known thee and
[1:24:57] these have known that thou has sent me
[1:25:00] and I have declared unto them thy name
[1:25:03] and will declare it and that the love
[1:25:05] wherewith thou has loved me may be in
[1:25:09] them and I in them and now that the same
[1:25:13] love that G's is there in the natural
[1:25:15] body on the earth had between him and
[1:25:17] his father they United them completely
[1:25:20] seamless together Amen that that same
[1:25:23] love would now be in US and he and us
[1:25:26] now we would love the father so much we
[1:25:29] be joined with him as joint heirs
[1:25:31] together partners on this life together
[1:25:34] on this journey together that we will be
[1:25:37] one with the Holy Ghost doing exactly
[1:25:39] what the Holy Ghost says to do in our
[1:25:41] lives
[1:25:41] amen that the glory of God might be in
[1:25:44] us amen and if you are lacking that
[1:25:47] right now if you are missing out on that
[1:25:51] your soul is crying out for the glory
[1:25:55] that you had with the father before the
[1:25:57] foundation of the world
[1:25:58] if you are missing that you're missing
[1:26:01] something amen if God doesn't come by
[1:26:03] your place and fellowship with you
[1:26:05] you're missing out on inheritance that
[1:26:07] was given to you
[1:26:08] amen if you haven't had an experience
[1:26:12] with God you're missing out on something
[1:26:14] that was given unto you God gave you an
[1:26:16] inheritance where's your inheritance why
[1:26:19] don't you have your inheritance God gave
[1:26:21] you something but you're missing out on
[1:26:23] it where's Jesus Christ's ascended up on
[1:26:25] high he led captivity captive amen and
[1:26:29] he gave gifts unto men amen and the so
[1:26:31] those gifts were he gave them to him
[1:26:33] apostles and prophets evangelists amen
[1:26:36] and all in the fivefold ministry why'd
[1:26:38] he give it to you for the perfecting of
[1:26:40] the Saints that the Word of God will go
[1:26:43] out over the pulpit amen
[1:26:44] we'll go out onto the people they would
[1:26:46] hear the word
[1:26:47] it would enter in through their ears
[1:26:49] into their mind they would consider it
[1:26:51] on the field of their mind and as they
[1:26:53] considered the Word of God they say
[1:26:55] that's the truth that's nothing but the
[1:26:58] truth
[1:26:58] I'd say Amen to it I believe that and as
[1:27:01] they begin to agree with the word that
[1:27:03] has preached it would drop from their
[1:27:05] mind down into their heart amen and they
[1:27:09] have began to realize oh my I am a son
[1:27:12] or a daughter of God oh my I have been
[1:27:15] separate I'm in this world but not of
[1:27:17] the world oh my I'm not the being I'm
[1:27:20] not a partaker of the evil this world
[1:27:22] but I've been separated from it and now
[1:27:24] I'm standing like I was in the Garden of
[1:27:26] Eden like it was before the fall
[1:27:28] I've been filled with the Holy Ghost I
[1:27:30] then you began to speak to him you'd be
[1:27:33] able to talk to him you'd begin to live
[1:27:35] with him you'd begin to be perfected in
[1:27:36] him why because now he is in you you are
[1:27:39] in him and the same love that existed
[1:27:42] between Jesus Christ and the father
[1:27:44] there now that same love is existing
[1:27:48] between you and him amen and you are
[1:27:51] united with your heavenly Father and
[1:27:55] you've been given power to become a son
[1:27:57] or a daughter of God amen and you're no
[1:28:00] longer you're a mystic to the world why
[1:28:03] because you're no longer of the lineage
[1:28:06] of your parents just like Jesus Christ
[1:28:09] says I was not just of Mary or of Joseph
[1:28:13] but I was the son of the Most High God
[1:28:16] and now you begin the same power to
[1:28:20] become a son or a daughter of God and
[1:28:23] you walk through this world fill with
[1:28:25] the Holy Ghost going wherever the Holy
[1:28:28] Ghost says go doing whatever the Holy
[1:28:31] Ghost says do a man when you go to
[1:28:33] witnesses someone words come out of your
[1:28:35] mouth that you didn't know we're in
[1:28:37] there Amen why because the Holy Spirit
[1:28:39] is still walking this earth drawing men
[1:28:42] and women to itself but now he's doing
[1:28:44] it through you and now you are the
[1:28:47] depository of the love of Jesus Christ
[1:28:49] on this earth and the same love that
[1:28:52] Jesus Christ have now you have and now
[1:28:56] you can love one another
[1:28:58] and all men will know that you are my
[1:29:01] disciples when you have loved one for
[1:29:03] the other
[1:29:04] amen why because you're no longer living
[1:29:06] with the evils of this world but now you
[1:29:09] can love with the same love that the
[1:29:11] thorah Jesus Christ had you've been
[1:29:13] changed from the creature that you wants
[1:29:16] one but now you have been changed into a
[1:29:19] son the son or daughter of God just like
[1:29:22] the Lord Jesus Christ you and him have
[1:29:24] become one if you have not had that
[1:29:27] experience then you've missed something
[1:29:31] somehow somewhere you've missed
[1:29:34] something and as your spirit cries out
[1:29:37] for it God has it here for you Amen just
[1:29:41] like any plant that is going through a
[1:29:43] dry or a desert time as it begins to cry
[1:29:46] out for water so as your soul cry out
[1:29:49] for the Living God Lord come and fill me
[1:29:52] with your Holy Ghost come Lord restore
[1:29:54] me back like it was in the Garden of
[1:29:57] Eden amen we're hues that's what Jesus
[1:29:59] Christ is doing he was crying out in
[1:30:01] that natural room for the Garden of Eden
[1:30:04] to return to the earth amen and we've
[1:30:07] been given that opportunity to live with
[1:30:10] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:30:13] a mystic to the world that's why Christ
[1:30:17] came amen that the same glory that he
[1:30:20] had with the father would now be living
[1:30:23] inside of us amen and and and I can't
[1:30:27] stand the idea of missing something if
[1:30:29] God gave it to me like I say about the
[1:30:32] children of Israel almost everybody that
[1:30:34] left Egypt never got to actually
[1:30:37] experience the very reason they left
[1:30:40] Egypt forward and I'd hate to think that
[1:30:44] that was the same thing was true of our
[1:30:46] church here this morning that the very
[1:30:49] thing that Jesus Christ cried out for
[1:30:52] there and John 17 as we left the world
[1:30:55] and things of the world that somehow we
[1:30:57] would miss and turn into it what a shame
[1:31:00] it missed something
[1:31:03] God wants to live with you every day
[1:31:05] God wants to walk with you talk with you
[1:31:08] every day
[1:31:09] and if you don't have that type of
[1:31:10] relationship with him then you
[1:31:12] the what how can we look back at the
[1:31:14] chair is really think why didn't they
[1:31:16] believe Moses why didn't they do all do
[1:31:18] all they should do why didn't they just
[1:31:20] obey the word that Moses said why did
[1:31:22] they reject the the inheritance at
[1:31:25] Kadesh Barnea why didn't they just go
[1:31:27] into the Promised Land why were they so
[1:31:29] scared why were they so afraid why don't
[1:31:31] you pray every morning why don't you
[1:31:34] read your Bible why don't you ask the
[1:31:36] Holy Spirit what would you like to do
[1:31:37] Lord why don't you leave the world
[1:31:39] things of the world behind why don't you
[1:31:41] remove your hand from all the wicked
[1:31:43] things of this earth
[1:31:44] why aren't you you know we can't rebuke
[1:31:47] them too much because we are guilty of
[1:31:49] the same things amen but yet the same
[1:31:52] reward lays before you if we will enter
[1:31:54] into it amen amen
[1:31:56] when you begin to in your eyes oh I wish
[1:31:59] that our eyes could be open and we could
[1:32:03] begin to see that we are not just
[1:32:05] standing in the natural building but we
[1:32:07] are encompassed about with a cloud of
[1:32:10] witnesses of those have gone on before
[1:32:12] us amen than that those two have entered
[1:32:16] into the heavens already amen are
[1:32:18] beholding the throne of God and seeing
[1:32:20] these things and are shot around as a
[1:32:22] cloud of witnesses are saying come on
[1:32:24] keep going
[1:32:25] don't stop don't stop now there's a
[1:32:28] reward that lays at the end there is a
[1:32:30] there's a place beyond the river just
[1:32:33] keep going there's an inheritance is
[1:32:34] laid up for you Jesus Christ said I go
[1:32:37] to prepare a place for you and I will
[1:32:39] come back and receive you unto myself
[1:32:40] but when I come back will there be faith
[1:32:43] on the earth when I come back will there
[1:32:45] be ebuddy still standing on the earth
[1:32:46] when I come back well there me buddy
[1:32:48] keep themselves clean from the world
[1:32:50] when I come back will there be anybody
[1:32:52] praying with me
[1:32:53] when I come back will there be Ebay
[1:32:54] living in the Garden of Eden like it was
[1:32:56] before the fall amen because I sent my
[1:33:00] word unto the earth but did you listen
[1:33:02] to what I had said amen the pattern
[1:33:06] repeats itself over and over and over
[1:33:08] again we're still living in Bible days
[1:33:10] and people are still ignoring the
[1:33:12] prophets and God sends into the earth a
[1:33:14] man whoa unto us if we ignore the
[1:33:18] prophets they got sins into the earth we
[1:33:21] could look back and then and say why
[1:33:22] didn't they listen to the things that
[1:33:24] Moses said why don't we listen to
[1:33:26] the brother branham said amen amen amen
[1:33:32] I could just see them there one talking
[1:33:35] to the other you know oh did you hear
[1:33:36] what Moses said the other day no I was
[1:33:38] busy and I didn't have time to make it
[1:33:40] to our Moses was gonna be talking and
[1:33:42] and he said well yeah he said he had a
[1:33:44] word from the Most High God he gotten
[1:33:46] upon the mountain something that would
[1:33:48] prepare us for this journey of the
[1:33:49] promised land and well I you know I've
[1:33:52] just been a little busy and didn't
[1:33:54] really have time to listen to the things
[1:33:55] that Moses said but like why why did you
[1:33:57] ever leave do you even eat chips then
[1:34:02] why would you why would you even want to
[1:34:05] leave Egypt if you're not gonna listen
[1:34:07] to the one that's taking you on further
[1:34:10] and sometimes I wonder why are we even
[1:34:12] sitting here in this church if we won't
[1:34:14] listen to the things to take us on
[1:34:16] further into Christ it's like some of us
[1:34:18] are standing and beholding the things of
[1:34:20] heaven and some are just standing here
[1:34:22] looking at the natural walls of this
[1:34:24] room lord I pray that you would open up
[1:34:26] gazes eyes Amen that he might see the
[1:34:30] cloud of witnesses that standing around
[1:34:32] us amen and the glory that is available
[1:34:36] unto us amen verse 20 neither pray I for
[1:34:45] these alone or for them also that shall
[1:34:48] believe on me through their word that
[1:34:50] they may all be be one as thou father
[1:34:52] art and me and I in thee that they also
[1:34:55] may be one in us and I wonder do we have
[1:34:58] that same oneness with the Almighty all
[1:35:01] power all powerful God in the same way
[1:35:05] that Jesus Christ envisioned it because
[1:35:08] I want to experience life on this earth
[1:35:10] in the exact same way that Jesus Christ
[1:35:13] had in his mind but he was dying for me
[1:35:16] on Calvary now whatever Jesus Christ had
[1:35:19] in his mind when he was dying for me in
[1:35:21] Calvary that's why I want experience
[1:35:23] here on this earth because if I don't
[1:35:25] experience life in that way that I know
[1:35:27] that I'm missing something and I don't
[1:35:29] want to miss out on anything
[1:35:31] a man let's just stand
[1:35:33] the power of crying out to God Lord I
[1:35:38] don't want to miss anything
[1:35:41] amen if I have missed something of this
[1:35:44] experience of living in the Garden of
[1:35:46] Eden like it was before the fall and
[1:35:48] brother Brahim talked about the Lord I
[1:35:50] pray you to restore back to me right now
[1:35:53] amen let's just bow our heads in word of
[1:35:55] Prayer Heavenly Father as we pray father
[1:35:58] we see Lord that you knew full well the
[1:36:01] glory that you had with the father
[1:36:03] before the foundation of the world as
[1:36:05] you said here when you were here on the
[1:36:07] earth and Lord we are crying out Lord
[1:36:09] right now as we live our natural lives
[1:36:12] on this earth Lord we pray that we'd be
[1:36:14] separated from the world or the things
[1:36:16] of the world as you said that we could
[1:36:18] be separate from the evil that is on
[1:36:20] this world but we could live in the
[1:36:23] glory of God and father I pray Lord if
[1:36:26] there be anybody here amongst us Lord
[1:36:28] that somehow is missed out on living at
[1:36:32] oneness with you having the glory of God
[1:36:36] Lord that you would reveal them to them
[1:36:38] just now that the power of the Almighty
[1:36:41] God might overshadow them Lord that they
[1:36:42] could be be given that power to be the
[1:36:45] sons or daughters of God and then Lord
[1:36:47] that they would be a mystic to the world
[1:36:49] living Lord reporting to service every
[1:36:51] day Lord Lord what would you like to do
[1:36:53] this day father how can I live with you
[1:36:56] how can I live with you on this life
[1:36:58] Lord how can I be filled with the Holy
[1:37:00] Ghost again refilled Lord Lord because I
[1:37:02] want to be about my father's business
[1:37:05] Laura that's why we came on this journey
[1:37:07] or we didn't come to see how far away
[1:37:10] from you we could live and still make it
[1:37:12] but Laura won't be as close to you as we
[1:37:14] can
[1:37:15] Lord if we've missed something upon this
[1:37:17] journey we pray Lord that you would
[1:37:19] restore it unto us and just now in the
[1:37:21] name with Lord Jesus Christ as our souls
[1:37:24] cry out to you Lord as a Alea as a plant
[1:37:27] in the dry and thirsty land cries out
[1:37:30] for the living water Laura saw our soul
[1:37:32] cries out unto you Lord restore us back
[1:37:36] to the condition that we're supposed to
[1:37:37] be in Lord Laura that would be filled
[1:37:39] with the Holy Ghost Lord that the we'd
[1:37:41] be filled with the glory of God because
[1:37:43] all we don't want to miss anything Lord
