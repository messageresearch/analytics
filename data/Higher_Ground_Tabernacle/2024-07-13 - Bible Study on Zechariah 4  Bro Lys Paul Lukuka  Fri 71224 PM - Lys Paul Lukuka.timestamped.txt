[5:40] Zechariah just let me know whenever
[5:42] you're ready
[6:02] chapter 4 Zechariah Chapter 4 Verse
[6:06] 1-4 so pretty much the entire
[6:19] chapter and let me know when you guys
[6:21] are ready then we'll we'll read it
[6:23] together
[6:31] Isaac Zechariah Chapter 4 Verse
[6:36] 1-4 we'll gu
[6:38] started let's read together uh and the
[6:40] angel that talked with me came again and
[6:44] wake me as a man that is waken out of
[6:46] his sleep and said unto me what seest
[6:50] thou and I said I have looked and behold
[6:54] a Candlestick all of gold with a bowel
[6:57] upon on the top of it and he seven lamps
[7:00] thereon and seven pipes to the seven
[7:04] lamps which are upon the top thereof and
[7:07] two olive trees by it one up on the
[7:09] right side of the bow and the other uh
[7:13] up on the left side
[7:16] thereof so I answered and spake to the
[7:18] angel that talked with me saying what
[7:21] are these my Lord then the angel that
[7:24] talked with me answered and said unto me
[7:27] knowest thou not what these be and I
[7:30] said no my Lord then he answered and
[7:33] spake unto me saying this is the word of
[7:36] the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by
[7:39] might nor by power but by my spirit um
[7:43] sayith the Lord of
[7:45] host who art thou oh great Mountain
[7:48] before zerubabel that shall become plain
[7:51] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[7:53] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[7:57] Grace unto it more moreover the word of
[8:00] the Lord came unto me saying the hands
[8:04] the hands of zerubabel have laid the
[8:06] foundation of this house his hands shall
[8:09] also finish it and thou shalt know that
[8:12] the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you
[8:15] for who has despised the day of small
[8:18] things for they shall rejoice and shall
[8:20] see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel
[8:23] with those seven they are the eyes of
[8:26] the Lord which run to and from
[8:30] um to and fro through the whole earth
[8:33] then answered I and said unto him what
[8:36] are these two olive trees up on the
[8:38] right side of the Candlestick and up on
[8:41] the left side thereof and I answered
[8:44] again and said unto him what be these
[8:47] two Olive branches which threw the the
[8:49] two golden pipes empty the golden oil
[8:52] out of themselves and he answered me and
[8:55] said knowest thou not what this be and I
[8:59] said no my Lord then he said he these
[9:03] are the two anointed ones that stand by
[9:06] the lord of the whole of the whole
[9:10] earth may the Lord add uh blessing to to
[9:14] his word you may have your
[9:17] seat and like I said um if you guys have
[9:19] any comments you know feel free this is
[9:21] not just me here like it's let's make it
[9:23] a collective effort right we're just
[9:25] sharing the word of God together so um
[9:28] let's we just break down this chap this
[9:30] uh chapter one by one so um here we see
[9:35] that um there were like they they were
[9:38] um after being led into captivity in
[9:41] Babylon you know they they the children
[9:43] of Israel left the Captivity and they
[9:45] went back to to their to their Homeland
[9:48] and because the first temple was
[9:50] destroyed you know they wanted to
[9:52] rebuild the second temple and um so this
[9:56] is in the process while they're trying
[9:58] to rebuild the second temple this is a
[10:00] vision that God is giving to zerubabel
[10:03] um uh encouraging him you know um for
[10:07] the for the uh construction of the
[10:09] second temple and I just want to show
[10:13] like The Parallel between the ministry
[10:16] of zerubabel and the ministry of William
[10:17] brandham because they're very similar
[10:20] and um so the first chap verse says and
[10:24] the angel that talk with me came again
[10:26] and wake me as a man that is waken out
[10:28] of his sleep and said unto said unto me
[10:32] um what seest thou and I said I have
[10:35] looked and behold a
[10:37] Candlestick so this is the the the verse
[10:40] that we start breaking down so he saw a
[10:42] Candlestick all of gold with a bow up on
[10:45] the top of it and his seven lamps
[10:48] thereof and seven pipes to the seven
[10:51] lamps which are up on the top thereof
[10:54] and two Olive Tree by it one up on the
[10:56] right side of the bowl and the other up
[10:59] on the left side thereof um Isaac can
[11:02] you hide the Bible and project the just
[11:05] click on hide yeah there we go all right
[11:07] so this is the vision that U this is the
[11:11] image of the vision that um Zariah saw
[11:14] right you can see the two Olive Tree
[11:16] trees one on the left one on the right
[11:18] and then the the Golden Stick the
[11:20] Candlestick um uh with seven pipes and
[11:23] seven lamps and there's a Golden Bowl in
[11:26] the middle and those two tree uh trees
[11:29] on the left and the right they actually
[11:32] um pouring oil and that oil oil is what
[11:37] is bringing the fire to the U it's what
[11:39] actually helping um the Candlestick be
[11:42] on fire right and so um but let's let's
[11:47] break down what are those what are those
[11:48] trees what does this represent what does
[11:50] this mean you know and uh so if we go to
[11:53] the Book of Revelation chap chapter 22
[11:56] verse
[11:57] 1-2 uh let let me know whenever you guys
[12:00] are
[12:06] there so first we'll break down the that
[12:08] that those two tree uh uh trees that um
[12:12] that Zechariah saw in the vision um so
[12:15] Revelation ch 22: 1-2 um it says and he
[12:19] showed me a pure River of Water of Life
[12:23] clear as Crystal proceeding out of the
[12:26] Throne of God and of the L
[12:29] and in the midst of the streets of it
[12:32] and on either side of the river was
[12:35] there the Tree of Life which bear 12
[12:38] manner of fruits and yielded her fruit
[12:42] every month and the leaves of the tree
[12:45] um were for the healing of the Nations
[12:48] right so in the Book of Revelation we
[12:50] see that uh the we see the the the
[12:54] appearance of trees that that tree again
[12:56] right and then he but the thing the
[12:58] thing here is saying that it's it
[13:00] doesn't say it doesn't say trees he said
[13:02] the tree of life right but then they
[13:05] were on either side you know that that's
[13:07] one thing that I was at first I was kind
[13:09] of confused about you know I was I was
[13:11] like the vision is talking about two
[13:13] trees you know but here it's it's
[13:16] referring on either side right it's
[13:18] making it seem as if it's two but then
[13:20] he says the the tree of the tree of life
[13:22] right so
[13:24] um um that's so that's that's one place
[13:29] in the Bible where they reference that
[13:30] tree of life so if we go to Psalm 1
[13:33] verse 1-3 there's another place again
[13:35] where that tree of life is being
[13:38] referenced uh so that Psalm is talking
[13:40] it says blessed is the man let me know
[13:43] when of you guys are there I don't want
[13:44] to go too fast right so because this is
[13:47] a collective U study so just let me know
[13:50] whenever you guys are there
[13:59] right amen so um blessed is the man I
[14:04] wish we had a second mic I could have
[14:05] someone else read um but blessed is just
[14:09] because if one person reads then without
[14:11] the mic people on the live stream won't
[14:13] be able to to to to hear right so
[14:16] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[14:18] the counil of the
[14:20] ungodly nor standeth you want to
[14:25] read no that doesn't work
[14:32] I just read slowly right the first
[14:34] verse bless blessed I'm reading the ASV
[14:38] translation blessed is the man who walks
[14:41] not in the counsil of the wicked nor
[14:44] stands in the way of Sinners nor sits in
[14:46] the seats of scoffers okay and verse two
[14:50] um just because you're reading a
[14:51] different version you know read right
[14:54] yeah just read there verse two but his
[14:56] Delights is in the law of the Lord and
[14:58] his and in his law does he meditate day
[15:02] and night right and verse three and he
[15:05] shall be like a tree planted by the
[15:07] rivers of water Waters that bringeth
[15:10] forth his fruits in his season his Leaf
[15:13] ALS also shall not wither and whatsoever
[15:15] he does shall prosper amen amen um I
[15:19] love this scripture first of all you
[15:20] know because there's a blessing that
[15:22] comes with the man that meditate upon
[15:24] the word of God day and night right so
[15:27] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[15:29] the counil of the ungodly but his
[15:31] Delight is in the Lord um and his
[15:33] Delight he and in his La do he meditat
[15:36] day and night in verse three it says and
[15:38] he shall be like a tree planted by the
[15:41] rivers of water you know it keeps on
[15:44] being on Revelation it was also planted
[15:47] by the rivers of water and here again
[15:49] you know David is comparing this man
[15:51] that meditates day and night he's like a
[15:53] tree that's planty by the rivers of
[15:55] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[15:57] his season his leaf leaf also shall not
[16:01] wither and whatsoever he does shall
[16:04] prosper right so
[16:08] um something very interesting about this
[16:11] uh Psalm um if if you let's read again
[16:14] the third chapter and he shall be like a
[16:16] tree planted by the rivers of water
[16:20] right the prophet I was reading a quote
[16:22] uh that's where I got all these things
[16:24] you know I it's not from myself it's
[16:26] from the message right so the prophet um
[16:29] says he says somewhere where it's like
[16:31] notice the difference it's multiple
[16:33] Rivers but one water right like rivers
[16:36] of water it doesn't say rivers of waters
[16:39] it's rivers of water I I might have that
[16:42] quotes here out read it and and he's
[16:44] he's saying that it's like it's like the
[16:46] same thing one Spirit you know you know
[16:49] multiple diversity of of gifts you know
[16:52] but then it's still the same Spirits you
[16:54] know let let just read cor Corinthians
[16:57] chapter 12
[16:59] 4-7 it says now there are diversities of
[17:03] gift but the Same Spirit right you
[17:06] remember we just read Psalm where it
[17:08] says by the rivers of water multiple
[17:10] Rivers but one water multiple gifts but
[17:14] it's the same spirit and there are
[17:17] differences of admin
[17:19] administrations but the same Lord right
[17:23] different sort of different
[17:25] Administration same Lord different
[17:27] multiple Rivers same water and there are
[17:30] diversities of of operations but it is
[17:33] the same God which worketh all in all
[17:37] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[17:39] given to every man to Pro profit with
[17:42] all you know following verse for by one
[17:46] is given uh for by one is given by the
[17:50] spirit the word of wisdom to another the
[17:53] word of knowledge by The Same Spirit you
[17:56] know some people they might have the
[17:57] gift of wisdom other people you know
[18:00] they might have the word of knowledge
[18:02] but it's still the same Spirit right to
[18:04] another Faith by The Same Spirit to
[18:08] another the gift of healing by The Same
[18:11] Spirit to another the working of
[18:13] Miracles to another prophecy to another
[18:15] Discerning of spirits to another diverse
[18:18] kinds of tongues to another the
[18:20] interpretation of tongues and the
[18:23] following verse says um but all these
[18:27] worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit
[18:31] dividing to every man severly as he will
[18:35] right so this is main stream of water
[18:38] main source of water dividing you know
[18:41] different gifts you know different
[18:43] Rivers you know that's that's that tree
[18:45] that uh um that David was referring to
[18:48] you know the prophet say that that water
[18:50] is pretty much it just a a
[18:52] representation of saying that it's the
[18:54] same Spirit but multiple gifts you know
[18:57] and for by one Spirit it doesn't say by
[19:00] two by three by four Spirits by one
[19:03] Spirit are we all baptized into one body
[19:06] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[19:09] we be bored or free and have been all
[19:12] made to drink into one Spirit you know I
[19:15] love this verse because Paul keeps on
[19:18] emphasizing on one one body one Spirit
[19:22] you know a selfsame spirit you know so
[19:25] it goes back to just uh if we if I just
[19:27] read again that PM a tree planted by the
[19:31] rivers of water you know the scripture
[19:35] it's just beautiful and um so let's
[19:39] continue the study so Revelation chapter
[19:41] 4 verse4 says and run about The Throne
[19:45] were four and 20 seats and up on the
[19:49] seats I saw four I saw four and 20
[19:52] Elders seating clothed in white rment
[19:55] and they had on their heads crowns of
[19:58] gold
[19:59] right so we already so we noticing that
[20:02] there's a tree planted you know by by
[20:05] the rivers of water right and then
[20:08] uh one on the left one on the right
[20:12] right and then now let's see what those
[20:14] those um what the those those uh tree
[20:16] means according to the prophet so in the
[20:19] message questions and answers on Hebrews
[20:21] Parts three verse 6 I mean paragraph 691
[20:25] the prophet says now the four and 20
[20:27] elders an elder is an overseer now
[20:32] notice there were 12
[20:34] Patriarchs and 12 Apostles and they were
[20:37] sitting 12 on one side and 12 on the
[20:41] other they were the 2 and4 Elders which
[20:45] were the 12 patriarch Patriarchs on one
[20:49] side the Old Testament the 12 apostles
[20:52] on the other side the New Testament then
[20:55] Jesus say you you'll set on 12 Thrones
[20:59] judging the 12 tribes of Israel uh the
[21:02] next U uh paragraph he says now the
[21:07] foundation now the foundations look
[21:09] there is a there is even a tree in there
[21:13] and the tree on either side Bears 12
[21:16] manners of
[21:17] fruit and they yield their fruit once a
[21:20] month which is 12 months in the year
[21:23] they render 12 manners of fruits every
[21:26] year as it goes by 12 is the worship
[21:28] number you see there's 20 and4 would be
[21:32] 24 12 Apostles and 12 picture they're
[21:35] sitting at the throne so this is just
[21:36] laying the foundation we're trying to
[21:38] understand what those two trees means
[21:40] and we seeing according to the prophet
[21:42] it's the Old Testament and the New
[21:43] Testament because the old patriarch
[21:46] Patriarchs they represent the Old
[21:47] Testament and the the the the 12
[21:49] apostles they represent the New
[21:51] Testament and uh you know it's even
[21:53] clear here on on this qu the prophet
[21:55] says it
[21:56] is the Church age book The Prophet says
[22:00] it is Burning Brightly because it has
[22:03] plenty of oil which is it is getting
[22:06] from the two olive
[22:08] trees which stand on either side the two
[22:13] represent the old and the New Testament
[22:17] and of course the oil typifies the Holy
[22:20] Ghost who alone can give the light of
[22:22] God to the people right so only the Holy
[22:25] Ghost can give the light of God so this
[22:28] is beautiful so the only light we are
[22:30] receiving is coming from that that ball
[22:33] that's giving the the um that has the
[22:36] oil that and that ball is receiving the
[22:39] oils from the two
[22:41] trees so the the Holy Ghost is only a a
[22:45] product of the of the word of God right
[22:47] so it can only come from the Old
[22:49] Testament and the New Testament we don't
[22:51] want to receive any spirits that comes
[22:54] outside of the word of God right because
[22:56] now it even makes more sense why we
[22:58] should always stay with the word because
[22:59] the only source of inspiration is coming
[23:01] from only those two trees right the Old
[23:04] Testament the New Testament and that's
[23:06] producing the Holy Ghost and you know
[23:08] and uh giving the oil and the prophet
[23:11] says that's the only light uh that's the
[23:13] that's the only thing the only one that
[23:16] can give the light of God to the people
[23:18] the angel who spoke to Zechariah was as
[23:20] much saying this so this is now the
[23:22] prophet just making it plain for us to
[23:24] for us to understand that this is what
[23:27] you see means that the church cannot
[23:29] accomplish anything by its own might or
[23:32] power but by the Holy Ghost cuz you know
[23:36] those seven seven lamps represent the
[23:38] seven you know it's like the it's to the
[23:40] seven Church ages right and then the
[23:42] only light they receive is coming from
[23:45] those trees and coming from the Holy
[23:47] Ghost the the the the b in the middle so
[23:50] the only um the church can only
[23:53] accomplish anything by the Holy Ghost
[23:55] right you can never do anything by your
[23:58] own within your own power no wonder he
[23:59] says not by power nor by might but by my
[24:03] spirit sayith the Lord right so um the
[24:08] next uh quote says in the me the message
[24:11] of Grace uh the prophet says I turn and
[24:14] looked again and I screamed out oh God
[24:16] why would you have your servant know
[24:19] just then the spirit of the Lord came in
[24:21] and said Jesus of the New Testament is
[24:24] Jehovah of the of the old he only
[24:27] changed his m from Spirit to man that
[24:30] was confirming of course my message of
[24:32] him you know this is just to bring into
[24:35] Clarity because you you know this some
[24:37] places they talk about one tree the
[24:39] other place they talk about one tree
[24:40] that's it's like it's one tree is
[24:42] planted on the waters and then the same
[24:44] time it seems like it's two trees but
[24:46] the prophet is saying that it's Jesus of
[24:48] the Old Testament is Jesus Christ je
[24:51] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus
[24:52] Christ of the New Testament right he
[24:55] just changed his M from Spirits to men
[24:57] so it's the same tree it's the same God
[25:00] you know it just like it over there it
[25:02] was the Old Testament and here it's the
[25:04] New Testament right and so let's
[25:09] continue so
[25:12] um sorry so let's continue so in John
[25:16] chapter 10: 10 John chapter 10: 10 it
[25:20] says um the
[25:24] thief then he heard and said unto me
[25:27] okay so
[25:29] this this is just trying to show you the
[25:32] parallel between you know the
[25:35] the um the zerubabel and the the the
[25:39] ministry of Will William Brenham you
[25:41] know zerubabel he came to restore
[25:44] something that was broken the temple you
[25:47] know the temple was destroyed and
[25:49] zerubabel he was he came to restore the
[25:52] temple you know cuz the enemy they came
[25:55] and they destroyed you know cuz and and
[25:58] and we see that it's the same thing in
[25:59] the ministry of William Bram you his
[26:01] ministry shall restore us back to the
[26:04] faith you know you know what the
[26:06] caterpillar has has eaten you know I
[26:08] shall restore all those things right so
[26:11] ver uh John chapter 10: 10 we know that
[26:14] the Devil comes uh so the thief cometh
[26:16] not but for to steal and to kill and to
[26:20] destroy but I'm come that they might
[26:23] have life and that they might have it
[26:26] abundantly right so
[26:29] so and then the the message of Grace the
[26:31] prophet says zerubabel the prince with
[26:33] Joshua was the one that was to bring
[26:36] forth his this headstone he had laid the
[26:40] foundation he had took the people back
[26:43] to the foundation and I like he said in
[26:45] type right because the scriptures you
[26:49] have to this is a shadow these are types
[26:52] to you know for what what what we living
[26:54] right right now so zabel he had to take
[26:57] the people back to the foundation you
[26:59] know because like I said again you know
[27:02] they were the they were dispersed going
[27:03] to Babylon you know in captivity but now
[27:06] that they returned they wanted to work
[27:08] they the previous study that we did the
[27:10] other day I show in book of he guy is
[27:14] that ha guy or hagy the book of hey that
[27:17] like they were concerned that okay we
[27:20] have we have good clothes we know we
[27:22] have good houses but then the house of
[27:25] the Lord is not built you know so they
[27:28] wanted to build a house for the Lord
[27:30] they wanted to restore that that that
[27:32] Temple of the Lord right and then uh uh
[27:36] the prophet talks about The Headstone
[27:38] right and so he had to take the people
[27:41] back to the foundation in Ty so that was
[27:44] the ministry of zerubabel right and the
[27:47] prophet says that was in type now let's
[27:49] compare that with the prophet's Ministry
[27:51] Malachi chapter 4 5 Verse 6 behold I
[27:55] will send you Elijah the prophet before
[27:57] the coming of the great and Dreadful day
[27:59] of the Lord and he shall turn the heart
[28:02] of the fathers to the children and the
[28:04] Heart of the children to their fathers
[28:06] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[28:10] curse curse right so there's been a
[28:12] Destro something has been destroyed or
[28:15] something has been perverted right
[28:17] something has changed because if you
[28:18] want to turn the heart back to where be
[28:20] it belong that means something change in
[28:22] the on the way right and uh and we saw
[28:25] that the enemy the enemy is there to to
[28:28] kill steal and destroy and if you study
[28:30] the seven Church ages you will see how
[28:32] throughout the the the church age how
[28:34] the devil has tried to destroyed you
[28:37] know that that that that seed of God you
[28:39] know destroyed uh uh the promise that
[28:42] that that God gave for for the bride
[28:44] right and um he tried to to change the
[28:47] word of God you know saying okay baptize
[28:49] in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[28:51] being bringing Trinity multiple
[28:54] doctrines you know that are again that's
[28:56] how you know how the devil operates his
[28:59] doctrines doesn't align with the word of
[29:02] God we just saw from that Vision that
[29:04] everything we receive is coming from the
[29:06] two trees the Old Testament and the New
[29:09] Testament that's why the prophet always
[29:10] tells us stay with the word you know
[29:13] because that's that's where we get
[29:14] everything and so Luke chapter 1 uh
[29:18] verse 11 it says and there appear unto
[29:20] him an angel of the Lord standing on the
[29:23] right side of the altar of incense and
[29:26] when Zechariah saw him he was TR
[29:28] troubled and fear um fell upon him but
[29:32] the angel said unto him fear not
[29:34] Zechariah for thy prayer is heard and
[29:37] thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son
[29:41] and th shall call his name John and um
[29:45] the next um verse he says and he shall
[29:47] go before him in the spirit of God in
[29:50] the spirit and the power of Elias to
[29:53] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[29:55] children and the disob disobedience
[29:58] obedient to the wisdom of the just to
[30:00] make ready a people prepared prepared
[30:03] for the Lord and um I think most of you
[30:07] guys already know this you know uh this
[30:08] is just a repetition but like you notice
[30:11] that in Luke chap 1 verse1 17 maybe you
[30:14] can help someone on the live stream he
[30:16] says he shall go before him in the
[30:18] spirit and power of Elias to turn the
[30:20] heart of the fathers to the children
[30:23] right he did not say to turn the heart
[30:25] of the children to the fathers he just
[30:27] says the heart of the fathers to the
[30:29] children right but if but we just read
[30:32] Malachi uh chapter 4 that says he had
[30:35] two Mission this Elijah yet one was to
[30:38] turn the heart uh to turn the heart of
[30:41] the fathers to the children the second
[30:43] to the left to turn the heart of the
[30:45] father to the children on the right to
[30:47] turn the heart of the children to their
[30:48] fathers but then when the angel came to
[30:51] give Zechariah the the word for John the
[30:54] Baptist he did not mention to turn the
[30:56] hearts of the children back to their
[30:58] fathers because that Ministry did not
[30:59] belong to um John the Baptist that was
[31:03] for the later days you know for the
[31:04] ministry of William Bram right so to
[31:07] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[31:09] children and this is a pattern that
[31:12] happens in the Bible you know even Jesus
[31:14] you know in for instance in Isaiah 61
[31:17] verse 1-2 the spirit of the Lord God is
[31:20] upon me hopefully I'm not going too fast
[31:22] right so the spirit of God the spirit of
[31:25] the Lord God is upon me because the Lord
[31:27] has anointed me to preach Good Tidings
[31:30] unto the meek he has sent me to bind up
[31:33] the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to
[31:36] the captive and the opening of the
[31:38] prison to them that are bound to
[31:41] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[31:44] and the day of Vengeance of our God so
[31:47] right to conform all the all that
[31:49] morning so two missions that that that
[31:52] Jesus that that the Christ said to
[31:54] fulfill right to proclaim the acceptable
[31:56] year of the Lord and the day of
[31:58] Vengeance of our God but then when
[32:01] Jesus uh read that scripture and said
[32:03] today this the scripture is fulfilled he
[32:06] only let just read and he so Luke
[32:09] Chapter
[32:10] 4:16-17 he says and he came to Nazareth
[32:13] where he had been brought up and as his
[32:16] custom was he went into the synagogue of
[32:19] the on the Sabbath day and stood up for
[32:22] the for for to read and there was
[32:24] delivered unto him the book of The
[32:26] Prophet uh isah
[32:28] and when Isaiah and when he had opened
[32:31] the book he found the place where it's
[32:34] written it's written and he came to wait
[32:37] hold on it's written the spirit of the
[32:40] Lord you know so even Jesus had a habit
[32:42] of reading the word you know if Jesus
[32:45] could read the Bible we should also read
[32:46] the Bible and we should be able to
[32:48] identify ourselves in the word because
[32:50] that's what Jesus did he he wasn't just
[32:52] reading the word just for the S he he
[32:54] identified himself with the scripture he
[32:56] knew exactly where stood on the
[32:58] scripture you know the devil the devil
[33:00] will play with you if you don't know
[33:01] your position in the word you know so
[33:03] Luke 48:19 it says the spirit of the
[33:06] Lord is upon me because he has anointed
[33:08] me to preach the gospel to the poor he
[33:10] has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[33:13] preach the Deliverance to the captive
[33:14] and recovering of sight to the blind to
[33:17] set a Liber at Liberty them that are
[33:19] bruised to preach the acceptable year of
[33:23] the Lord and he just paused there you
[33:25] know and then he says again and he
[33:27] closed the book so he did not he didn't
[33:29] even finish the full chapter he just
[33:31] closed the book and he says and he gave
[33:34] it again to the ministry and said down
[33:36] and the eyes of all that were in the
[33:37] synagogue were fasting on him and he
[33:40] began to say unto them this day is the
[33:43] scripture fulfilled in your ears right
[33:46] so just to show you that that's the same
[33:48] thing that's happening with Malachi
[33:50] right the first mission was for John the
[33:52] Baptist and the second mission is for
[33:55] the later days um and going back to the
[33:58] restoring Ministry we just read earlier
[34:00] where the Prophet says that you know
[34:02] Zechariah his ministry was to restore uh
[34:05] uh uh back the people right and then we
[34:08] see in Joel 2:25 he says and I will
[34:10] restore to you the years that the Locust
[34:13] has eaten the cankerworm and the
[34:16] caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great
[34:19] Army which I sent among you right and if
[34:23] you have a if you have a chance to
[34:25] listen to that message I think in the
[34:27] the prophet preach I will restore I
[34:29] think that's the message he explains
[34:31] this deeper you know explaining what the
[34:34] caterpillar means what the canker worm
[34:36] it's just the devil changing his form
[34:38] you know it's the same an it's the same
[34:40] insect but it's just in different
[34:43] manifestations right and then that
[34:45] insects try to eat from like you know to
[34:48] destroy the the people of God but then
[34:51] God promises us that he will restore
[34:53] just like with zobel that had to restore
[34:56] the temple this Ministry of the end time
[34:59] will restore us but to the Faith of Our
[35:01] Fathers right and so now um I'm almost
[35:06] done so let's go back to Zechariah Isaac
[35:09] Isaac can you project Zechariah
[35:16] 4:7 all right okay let's read that so
[35:18] who are thou oh great Mountain before
[35:21] zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and
[35:25] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[35:27] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[35:31] Grace unto it right so we see here that
[35:34] zerubabel in his restoring Ministry he's
[35:37] crying with shoutings you know shoutings
[35:40] crying Grace Grace so there are three
[35:42] things happening he's first shouting and
[35:44] he's crying and what is he crying he's
[35:47] crying a message of Grace Grace Grace
[35:49] unto it this is exactly the ministry of
[35:52] the end time ministry you know first as
[35:55] you can hide it now I'll put so first
[35:57] the Thessalonians 4:16 says for the Lord
[36:01] himself will descend from heaven with a
[36:05] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[36:08] and with the trumpet of God and the dead
[36:11] in Christ will rise first just in
[36:14] comparison with zakar right he's he's
[36:17] coming first with shoutings and here
[36:19] this says for the Lord himself will
[36:20] descend from heaven with a shout you
[36:24] know and with the voice uh with a shout
[36:27] with the voice of an archangel and with
[36:31] the trumpet of God now let's see what
[36:33] the prophet says about about that uh in
[36:35] the message of rapture paragraph 130
[36:38] says three things
[36:40] happen uh a shout a voice a trumpet has
[36:44] to happen to happen before Jesus
[36:46] appears Jesus does all three of them
[36:50] he's
[36:51] descending there is a shout what is the
[36:53] shout now we understand the prophet is
[36:55] breaking out what is the shout it's the
[36:57] message going forth first the living
[37:01] bread of life bringing forth the bride
[37:04] that's how the the restoration happens
[37:07] if how zerubabel was restoring the
[37:10] temple you know we we are the Temple of
[37:12] the Living God you know the devil has
[37:15] come and tried to destroy us but we've
[37:17] received a first the shout the shout we
[37:20] received the
[37:21] message in the uh process of restoration
[37:25] the message going forth the the living
[37:28] bread of life bringing forth the bride
[37:32] right and um the in paragraph U 141 of
[37:37] the same message he says the first thing
[37:39] comes when he starts descending from
[37:40] Heaven there's a shout what is it it's a
[37:43] message to get the people together a
[37:46] message come forth
[37:48] first now lamp trimming uh time rise and
[37:53] trim your lamps that's the message you
[37:55] know get ready the is coming you know
[37:59] rise and trim your
[38:01] lamps what what watch was that the
[38:05] seventh not the sixth the seventh behold
[38:09] the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your
[38:12] lamps and they did isn't that what the
[38:15] message of William bham is about Jesus
[38:17] is coming get ready trim your lamps the
[38:20] bridegroom cometh you know rise and trim
[38:23] your lamps and they did some of them
[38:25] found they didn't even have any oil in
[38:28] their lamp but it's lamp trimming time
[38:32] right so Zechariah Chapter 4 zel in his
[38:35] ministry restoring the temple you know
[38:38] bringing forth The Headstone with the
[38:40] shoutings and we understand that the
[38:42] prophet tells us that the shouting is
[38:43] the message telling us to get ready the
[38:45] bridegroom is coming right and uh the
[38:49] the next um uh quote says uh this
[38:52] morning the message this morning to me
[38:56] the High the Highlight message of my
[39:00] entire Ministry this morning see a
[39:03] highlight message of my entire Ministry
[39:05] someday and and okay this is just in
[39:08] reference to the message the token right
[39:11] the prophet is saying that that is the
[39:12] highlights um of his
[39:15] ministry um someday I'll tell you how it
[39:18] come about I know that everything has
[39:20] worked for months and month up to that
[39:22] one
[39:24] message all right so um almost done then
[39:28] the next thing okay let's read Matthew
[39:31] 25:1 to4 then shall the Kingdom of
[39:34] Heaven be liken unto 10 virgins which
[39:38] took their lamps and went forth to meet
[39:41] the
[39:42] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[39:45] and five were foolish they that were
[39:48] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[39:51] with them but the wise took oil in their
[39:56] vessels with their lamps
[39:58] right they were wise and they took the
[40:00] they took oil in their vessels we
[40:02] understand that the only way the pro we
[40:04] just going back again to that quotes the
[40:06] prophet says that the only way the
[40:07] church gets the light is from the Holy
[40:10] Ghost right from that bow like the that
[40:13] Vision that the prop that zerob saw
[40:16] there was a bowl with full of oil and
[40:19] the prophet says oil represents the Holy
[40:21] Ghost right and so the only way you can
[40:24] meet the bridegroom you got to have the
[40:26] oil Right In Your Vessel and uh verse
[40:30] five it says while the bridegroom teared
[40:33] they all slumbered and slept so even
[40:37] those that had the holy ghost slumbered
[40:39] and slept cuz he said the Bible says all
[40:42] so the prophet says that so there are
[40:44] the foolish virgins and the wise virgins
[40:47] but all of them slumbered and slept so
[40:50] some somehow in the process this is
[40:53] beautiful because that's what happening
[40:54] in the church age you know like the
[40:56] devil got in the church so distracted
[40:59] you know and then and then we even see
[41:01] that the vision that the um the prophet
[41:04] the angel of God drew the seven Church
[41:06] how you could see how the light started
[41:08] getting deer and deer you know as as as
[41:11] the ages are going forward slumbered and
[41:14] slept but at the midnight there was a
[41:17] cry
[41:20] made so remember Zechariah says with
[41:23] shoutings crying so there is a cry in
[41:26] the restoration of Z zerubabel right and
[41:29] here also at Midnight Cry there was a
[41:31] cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go
[41:36] ye out to meet him so if that cry wasn't
[41:39] made imagine they were all sleeping the
[41:41] bride bridegroom would have come and
[41:43] they would have not been ready right so
[41:45] we needed a message to come forth First
[41:49] crying you know behold the Bri the
[41:52] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[41:55] that that's those are steps of the
[41:56] restoration
[41:58] and um and the prophet says
[42:02] um in the message the uniting time and
[42:05] sign like the wise men coming down from
[42:08] Babylon they screamed where is he born
[42:13] King of the Jews he's on Earth right now
[42:16] we've got to find him that's right I
[42:19] believe he's so close to coming that I
[42:21] can say behold the bridegroom cometh I
[42:26] hear the midnight right amen so he say I
[42:29] I believe I can say so now it's no
[42:32] longer you just reading what we just
[42:33] read the verse say oh behold the bright
[42:36] bright bridegroom cometh this is that
[42:39] messenger that same voice that we heard
[42:41] that the Bible is talking about be uh uh
[42:43] uh let just let just read that again
[42:45] hold on uh and at midnight there was a
[42:48] cry behold the bridegroom cometh that
[42:51] same cry is being said here in the
[42:54] message uniting time he's not even
[42:56] saying oh I I don't I don't think he
[42:58] said I can now say behold the bridegroom
[43:01] cometh I hear the Midnight Cry right
[43:05] amen we we're right at the end of the
[43:08] time my hour oh my the hour we're living
[43:12] in so the bre the cry has been made the
[43:15] message has gone forth right and then
[43:18] what message is he crying he's crying
[43:20] Grace Grace unto and then and another
[43:23] thing too it was at the midnight uh it
[43:25] was at the Midnight Hour right right
[43:27] that the message uh the cry went forth
[43:29] and it's the same thing with the prophet
[43:31] is saying by faith in the message by
[43:33] faith Moses um brother I tell you when
[43:36] Israel got ready at midnight they had
[43:38] everything they had in this world packed
[43:41] up and ready to go God send us a Revival
[43:44] like that we pack up everything and get
[43:48] ready to go the Midnight Cry is a
[43:52] coming go ye out to meet him you better
[43:55] have everything backed up you better not
[43:59] have nothing this world luring you back
[44:02] any strings to hold you down you know
[44:06] the first Exodus what did he do he
[44:09] brought them out of a natural land to a
[44:12] natural land the second Exodus he
[44:15] brought them out from a spiritual
[44:17] condition into a spiritual baptism of
[44:20] the Holy Ghost now he's bringing them
[44:23] from the spiritual baptism of the Holy
[44:25] Ghost right back into the Eternal land
[44:28] of the Millennium and the great
[44:30] Hereafter same Pillar of Fire it goes
[44:34] back again Same Spirit same body same
[44:37] pill pillow of fire the same pillow of
[44:40] fire that brought the children of Israel
[44:42] out of Egypt is the same that um that is
[44:46] the same that's bringing them from the
[44:48] spiritual baptism right back to Eternal
[44:50] land so that same pill fire that Rapture
[44:53] us right and um by the same anointed
[44:58] system he has to be anointed you know we
[45:01] don't just want any we want an anointed
[45:04] system the same God doing the same
[45:08] things and the same word you know it
[45:11] goes back again to same same God Same
[45:14] Spirit one word you know declare the
[45:17] first word declare the second one so
[45:19] that same word that decare the first
[45:21] word is the same word that's declaring
[45:24] the second one the same word declar the
[45:26] second one has declared the third one
[45:29] and here we see it among us right this
[45:33] is beautiful and uh as I said like I'll
[45:36] finish it with this uh last quot you
[45:38] know what was that he zeru Bell is
[45:41] shouting crying Grace Grace unto it so
[45:43] it's a message of grace and the prophet
[45:45] tells us in Jesus Christ the same
[45:47] yesterday today and forever I believe
[45:50] that we are now living in the last day I
[45:53] believe that this is the last message
[45:55] this message of Grace that God has given
