[Music] [Music] oh just before we start reading those bowel heads is lord look at your children they could have been other places doing other things they decided to come into your house that's in your house that's what salvation is because we know the letter alone because in this place amen hebrews in chapter 1 hebrews chapter 11 verse 1. the bible says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand the works the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things which are sin were not made of things which do appear amen by faith offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh amen by faith enoch was translated that he would not see death and he was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had his testimony that he pleased him amen but without faith it is impossible to please him amen foreign for he that coming to god must believe that he is and that he is a reward of them that diligently seek him to exist but without faith it is impossible to please him faith is the revelation without revelation you cannot please god amen the lord blessings to the reading of his word amen in the book of hebrews when we were reading paul is talking about all the sages of old paul how they please god because they had faith and the bible tells us that you and me without faith we cannot please god at all so for you to please god it is required and it is mandatory that you have faith amen in the book of romans paul tells us that faith comes by hearing and by hearing the word of god in many places the prophet of god tells us that faith is our victory so since satan knows that faith comes by hearing the word and that faith is your victory making sure that we are distracted amen and many times we think faith as a as something that that is uh um something that is abstract something that's intangible but here paul tells us that faith is the substance of things hopeful in your early education they told you substance is something you can hold something that you know for sure it is present it is there so faith is the tangible part of the thing that you are hoping for that's right amen and many times when we think about it and we're just look we think faith is a very difficult thing but faith is simple if we open our bibles to the book of second peter chapter one in verse five he says and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith to patients godliness and if we go down we see us building up to the stature of a perfect man but if you look clearly at a second at verse five so faith is already there faith was already there before you had to add these other virtues to build the stature of a perfect man so as soon as you are saved you already have faith you just have to to that understanding and that knowledge that god has already given it to me the prophet of god says you can only have faith as god gives you faith faith is a gift of god however religious you may be you must have faith amen it is a gift from god when you are saved if you are seated right then you accepted christ as your savior you have faith because the bible tells us that faith without works is dead so you gotta exercise it to put it to use amen so faith brings us brings to us victory the prophet of god also says faith is the most common thing there is you can't even get a drink of water without faith you couldn't come to this meeting without faith when you came in to sit on your chair how many tried to check if the chair was gonna was not gonna was not gonna fall under them no one did you have you had faith in that chair so each and every one of us in this building have faith so you are on your way to pleasing god but our problem is we only have faith in natural things and when it comes to god then we no longer have faith and of all the air crashes we've ever had you still have faith that i'm going to reach my destination amen and we thank god for the prophet of our days able to work for you he says patience and soul for this mockery pretending of nature giving faith the faith that we're talking about that's nature giving faith and he says all these things are nature-given and he says and the biggest part of our faith is mental faith and i like this part it says and when the word itself is pouring into your faith our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation [Music] if you just pour the word of god onto that face amen so it is not that difficult we all have faith but we all do not trust the word of god as we ought to so if you just apply that word of god to your faith then you know it's a done deal it's already settled because faith changes impossible to possible it is not and i think when the children of israel were crossing after they crossed over the other ten came back saying we saw giants we cannot take this land they say we are like grasshoppers they were looking at what their site was telling them but you see the word of god they didn't talk about the graves and the good land that the world was talking about but joshua and caleb they were looking at the word they applied the word to their faith and they said we sold the milk and honey the land is ours whatever is standing between me and the promise does not matter that's right because i'm standing on the word of god they did not say we might be able to go and take it but they say the land is there it is ours we are able to go and play man [Music] why because they were using their faith they were looking at it with the eyes of god amen they did not let the circumstances or what they saw to affect god what god had said about it amen but when you are walking with your eyes of faith so i know if god say that we don't know how long it took for that light to be there but one thing we know for sure is light was there because when god speaks a word that word is eternal and a word that is spoken carries the same authority as the person who is spoken if someone comes to you and told you that someone said go do this and this the first question you ask is who said that the answer you will get will determine the speed at which you will do that because you're attaching authority to that word if it is your friend then you say oh i'll do some other time okay but if it is someone who's in authority you go and do it right away so when god speaks word that word has the same authority as god himself and he has never failed before amen in isaiah the bible says when god speaks a word it does not come back to him void it only comes back after it has accomplished its commissioner and if he is a father of faith they are children of faith despite what his body looked like so it doesn't matter if you try to match up the word and what the situation is looking like that's i believe and i have enough faith that the world has enough power to change that situation to match what the world says amen the prophet of god tells us that abraham and sarah their bodies were rejuvenated they were transformed [Music] it was not their own doing and make that promise to come to pass that's why abraham never staggered on the promises of god and he is written in hebrews 11 in the hall of fame of the saints as the people who had faith cause he stood on the word of god so when god tells you to do anything you go right ahead and do it because you know he's going to fulfill his word amen i don't worry about it because i'm not responsible for it he is fully responsible of his own word [Music] the prophet of god said god is willing to bankrupt heaven to make sure his word comes to pass so when the when god told me and when the word tells me that jesus said it is finished whatever i come across i would just say it is finished how is it going to get finished i don't know i'm not worried about it that's not my business hey man if i'm sick i'm just going to say by his traps i was healed i don't care whether it's diabetes whether it's cancer whether it's just a headache i'll just profess and say i am healed because i'm not the one who's going to heal myself so i'm not worried about it i'm just going to speak the word and go forward because i know god will do it it gives you a permission to be reckless what the dictionary uh defines reckless as careless of the consequences you just don't care what the consequences are consequence or you can say it's question-less it says now joshua knowing that the command was that was gonna come before him or how many how many uh how many other armies that enemy had overcome he was reckless because of the commission god had given him in the right direction so we are pointed in the way of the word we are pointed in the direction of the word so all we have to do is to be fearless and reckless it is not my duty to heal them the commission says lay hands on them and they shall recover as soon as you fulfill the word of god it is up to him to complete it also talks about how it's like a check that is that has a blank amount on it all you have to do is just put it's already signed all you have to do is put in the amount [Music] they everything is already settled because they know this is going to give me that food that's what faith is in our hands whatever you've been praying for your faith is the evidence of that thing that you need it is the tangible part amen amen so all you just have to do is have faith speak you can chase away tormenting spirits why because you are taking god at his word and we know he can do it because his word has the same authority as him himself first of all he was told to build a boat because it was gonna rain and second of all he was told to build a an ark which was also one of the most ridiculous things people had ever heard but no i didn't care about all that um you know that if god say that it is going to happen if god said it is going to rain it is going to rain if he said that build an ark see concrete i don't care what material it is that arc is going to bring me salvation no i didn't care about the engineering or the mechanics of the boat he was just looking at the word of god and now when we got to look at it god for wood is made of a material that's like a sponge [Music] it is it is porous so if you put it in water it sucks in all the water and it sinks that's why people say that is so ridiculous how can you build a boat with a material that if you put it in water it will just sink he told him to go boil that gopher wood in the evergreen tree the sap the sap from the evergreen tree he was going to boil that golfer within it it would suck in all that sap from this evergreen tree and after boiling it it was solid so the ark ended up being made of a mature that it was light as paper material but it was solid like steel and no man would have ever thought about it and we know he to the holy ghost it's supposed to be porous to the world so that when we lay in the presence of the holy ghost when we lay in the presence of the word why because you have christ in you you have that holy ghost fortifying you hey man so if you just stand on the word of god no temptation can come in your way you will be more than an overcomer a man i'll rather spend five minutes in the will of god than 50 years out of it because when you are in the will of god god is responsible to protect you but that's why it's important for us to have faith which is a revelation from god and we can only please him when we are in his will and when we are in his will we know that nothing can come it can can take us by surprise because he is there to protect you he is there to heal you if you fall sick he will take you out of it out of them out of them all we think that righteous means that someone who never sins but if that was the case then no one of us would have that scripture applying to us but the prophet of god gave us a definition of a righteous man whom when they fall down they don't stay there so whatever you have failed and you fall down just get up and keep on going it doesn't matter what you have done if you just get up repent of it god will forgive you and you have that ability and you can call god in his word and you say lord i have this affliction many are they but god would deliver you out of them all not some but all of them amen the prophet of god was talking about his testimony how he was sick he had a stomach trouble he couldn't he couldn't eat beans or have his stuff that couldn't stay in this in the stomach examine me say it's impossible for him to ever get well but he said and i read god's word amen that's what he and i eat cornbread greens and onions you say this one time i took a big mouthful and my mother got scared and called the doctor he said i swallowed them and went out swallowed they try to come back up again and i held my hand over my mouth he says oh no you can't do that you said i just kept on doing that she continued until it stayed down and he was killed because he was being persistent he was not in that number no it doesn't matter how many times i'm fighting this demon god has to deliver me out of this affliction because he called god on his word amen so when you have this faith it changes your vocabulary from impossible to possible you cannot be shaken because it's nothing i think so but it's in i know so you amen because you have a revelation that's why we know many testimonies william branham he'll say i'm speaking according to the revelation of my faith it's not for us just to look and say oh wow that was great it is for you to see that if a man who's filled with the holy ghost can do this myself i can do the same thing too that's why you gotta share your testimony you can do the same thing for me too prophetic god says if mr john doe out there had cancer and was healed see uh mr if mr john doe was out there and had cancer it was healed and you are in that same position you know that it's happening it's going to happen for me as well it says if this man was blind and now they can see me and then you see if you are blind oh is it a verb and also if this person is crippled and couldn't walk and now they can walk and you hear of a testimony of someone who had diabetes and got healed hey man if you're reading and you're here talking to the prophet talking about someone getting healed of cancer these testimonies did not end in 1965. the bible says greater works than this shall you do so it is for you and me too he says that's the way congress uh congressman abso was healed um we know he was he was in the he was in the wheelchair for 66 years don't do it and then he heard the testimony of um of of florence nightingale and how she was they had been like that for 66 years and science says it's it's hard for for someone to have a bone regeneration when they are older like that and he walked up out of that wheelchair if you receive the holy ghost share the testimony to somebody else if you were fighting depression and god came and delivered you share with somebody else your testimony is somebody else's weapon and god will use that same testimony to bring another testimony to you remember [Music] it is david's testimonies that gave him the testimony of killing goliath because he knew that if god did this with a lion he said and he did this with the beast and this goliath is just another beast that's why the bible says david ran towards goliath that was nothing else but faith he did not think that goliath was going to fall he knew that goliath was going to fall because he was standing on the promise of god and he was standing on his experiences amen so don't be afraid to testify so they can also get their deliverance amen the prophet of god says genuine faith does not take no for an answer he says it's got hairs on the chest it's muscular it's big and burly it speaks and everything has to set down [Music] amen here's the one who told us that faith is the sixth sense that sixth sense we're supposed to supersede all the other fights that's the ones that bring doubt to us when you look and see something you say no this is not it and it makes you doubt the word of god but that sixth sense he says it's muscular when it speaks everything has to settle down i probably told this story before when i was uh when i was when i was younger in um i was i was in primary school middle school and then i i was writing this test in school and the question was how many senses does a human have songs this was a thursday the previous ones i'd heard my dad preach about how faith is the sixth sense and we have six senses i'm the only one who had six senses i had the answer wrong and i was i was mad i went back to my dad i said hey this is what you're preaching i wrote this but i got this wrong what does this mean then he told me no we are different we have a sixth we sense different from the rest of the world that just operate on five senses we have that sixth one that supersedes all of them that's why when you see the doctor's report those senses to shut up and only look at the word of god that's the one the prophet is saying it has it has big muscles and it tells all the other five senses to shut up and settle down [Music] he says if the old if the old feelings rise up and you say i don't feel any different to [Music] because faith is looking at the word of god it's not looking at what your senses are saying no amen so we gotta rely more on that sixth sense over the other five because faith is that it gives us that communication and it gives us contact with god because if you don't have faith and you don't even believe in god how are you going to be able to pray to him without faith you cannot please him without faith you cannot even contact god we know faith prayer is the most powerful weapon that god ever plays in the hands of man so if you cannot have faith how can you pray for things to happen that the prayer of the son of god goes a million times faster than the prayer of an angel that happens if you're in contact with god the prophet tells us that the most the three most powerful weapons he talks about he talks about prayer and he talks about the power of confession [Music] if you believe and accept it on those basis and believe it keep confessing that's right people other people look at the symptoms yeah this is wrong but if you keep on confessing keep on believing god's going to do it despite what you feel amen amen so you gotta confess it rely on that sixth sense god will give you that victory keep on believing amen you will never fail and we do not receive because we do not ask bible says you receive not because you ask not and you ask not because you don't have faith in god because you you don't even know if god is going to do it and he says you will brother branham says you can never exhaust the love of gods to you he says he says you're gonna say well i hate to bother you so much further he says he wants to be bothered that way amen don't you ever think that you could ever ask too much of god he said he wants us to ask and believe that our joys were don't limit your fate to some little mustard seed only get out there and get out there or some kind of faith and move out big things fit the controls big things are just as easy to receive as little things imagine a little fish that's in the sea the image it says i'll just a few sips of water otherwise i'm gonna finish this water you think god that god is limited the bible says he will give it to you it doesn't matter even if it's not just for yourself you can ask for your children did it for his for her children and it was given to them you can ask for your family hey man you can apply the talking for your family why that's big things god can do it he is not limited the prophet of god i was going to choke it uh i was going to not say it but i'm just going to say it men is omnipotent i know what it means but i had to go look back and see what it means omnipotent means unlimited authority your authority is not limited to anything because we get that authority from god if god is in you you have unlimited authority because you are allowing him to work within your you are allowing him to use your lips you allow him to use your hands to use your feet so when you speak and he says whatsoever you things you say don't doubt it in your heart you can have what you say because he was omnipotent he was given god's authority but after he lost that authority jesus went on the cross of calvary to claim back that authority and give it back to us so now that he has given it back to us and he is in us that same authority that adam had is lying within you and me yeah because he was omnipotent his god and he says what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and men comes together something's got to shake whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of god knowing that he's promised it things that is not it makes them as though they are because the word that you speak has authority so it has to happen [Music] the prophet talks about it he says don't fear john don't fear little flock and john is a type of the bride says all that i am you are here too all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as i stand in your midst [Music] unto me and it's yours to use you speak the word and i will perform it [Music] that is my covenant and it can never fail that is our covenant or your covenant god says this is my covenant because every time god tried to have a covenant with men men failed he said this is on me all you have to do is speak the word you speak salvation for your loved one and i will save them you ask for the holy ghost and i will give it to you you ask for change and i will give it to you why you just speak it and i will perform it that gives me each and every right to be reckless amen i have the right to be reckless because i know i'm not performing none of it it's all on god amen i'll give an example of being reckless when i was little in middle school if i had if if if the school would give me my tuition invoice i wouldn't even look at how much that was i'll just rush with that invoice and just go hand it over to my dad you see i don't care if he has the money or not i just know he's going to find it he's going to pay for it i don't even i'm not going to have a sleepless night because he could not find money to pay for it i know because i've been going to school he's been paying for it so therefore he's going to keep on paying for it amen so what more about god he has done all these things for you back in the past what makes you think that he's going to fail you today just go put it in the hands of god and you say i'm done it is up to him to fulfill it because he will do it i believe hey man so it doesn't matter who you are that covenant applies to you and you say is there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what this is he is the word so when a spirit born and spirit-filled men in faith takes that word into his heart and then places it upon his lips you can say i'm not maybe i'm not a deacon i haven't done a lot of things i don't have a lot of testimonies it doesn't matter you use that one weapon god gave you use that faith jesus is going to give you victory because that faith is what you're going to need for the changing of your body you do not have faith what makes you think you're going to have faith for a transformation of your body that's why you gotta exercise it but god said daniel you go you go that way because i have a special people for the last days so you are more qualified than daniel to leave in this day you were more qualified than the three hebrew boys today so if you don't perform experts when you go to heaven daniel is going to ask what did you do when you were on earth and you don't have a testimony he's going to regret to say you should have switched me out with this guy because you didn't take use of the promises god gave you promise to do that so all you just have to do is stand have faith in god when your faith is anchored in god it's supreme faith and that faith will go and bring things to you is it forever so long is based on the will of god so long it's based on the word of god let us stand upon our feet amen [Applause] amen we thank god for that weapon that he gave to us foreign [Music]
