[13:40] we thank you for
[13:42] guiding us and showing us to
[13:45] come here with a humble spirit heart
[13:49] a place where you desire
[13:52] to dwell here within us
[13:56] we thank you lord for those who
[13:59] rose up early and
[14:02] that you met them there
[14:04] and they've
[14:05] [Music]
[14:06] come here with that holy ghost revival
[14:09] like you desire
[14:14] we thank you lord for
[14:17] your design
[14:19] for your children
[14:22] which is you
[14:23] lord
[14:25] we i we desire to be just like
[14:28] you and we come here this morning
[14:32] pulling on you el shaddai
[14:33] [Music]
[14:35] as a
[14:36] our
[14:37] servant
[14:39] has prepared himself
[14:41] to receive the word the fresh manna that
[14:43] you have this morning
[14:46] we thank you lord for
[14:49] the word of this hour
[14:53] we thank you lord
[14:55] just
[14:56] like peter preached
[14:58] after the outpouring of the holy spirit
[15:02] that moses said there would be
[15:05] another
[15:07] prophet just like himself
[15:09] that would be risen
[15:11] and raised up
[15:14] and we thank you lord for that
[15:17] prophet that was raised up in
[15:19] our day
[15:22] you said to listen to all that he had to
[15:25] say
[15:27] and i i pray father god that
[15:31] we're
[15:32] listening to those messages
[15:35] in the privacy of our home
[15:37] maybe in the privacy of our vehicle
[15:40] wherever it may be
[15:43] those words that come out of the jaws of
[15:45] clay of our
[15:47] minister
[15:48] our pastor
[15:50] [Music]
[15:51] i pray father god that we will listen to
[15:54] all of them
[15:55] just like
[15:58] peter had instructed
[16:02] and the downside of it was very extreme
[16:05] if we would not listen
[16:07] that person would be pulled out and
[16:09] destroyed
[16:11] and we we know the gravity lord there in
[16:13] chapter three of acts that
[16:16] it's important that we know what
[16:19] brother branham said and
[16:21] to listen to all of it
[16:24] be obedient
[16:27] i just take authority right now over
[16:29] this place
[16:33] i pray father god if there be any spirit
[16:36] here
[16:37] as you said whatever i bind here on
[16:40] earth you bind in heaven as long as i do
[16:42] it in the name of jesus christ
[16:45] and i pray father god that every spirit
[16:48] contrary to your holy spirit
[16:50] be bound and pulled down and swept away
[16:53] brought to new effect
[16:55] in the name of jesus christ
[16:58] we thank you lord for your love lord
[17:01] [Music]
[17:02] i pray now you'll lose your word that
[17:07] your spirit
[17:09] moves
[17:10] in and abound us
[17:13] [Music]
[17:15] we thank you lord for your love that
[17:18] the love of jesus christ
[17:21] be in us
[17:24] be projected to each one of us around us
[17:29] and as we leave this place today that
[17:32] love continue
[17:34] to be witnessed to those that come in
[17:37] contact
[17:38] we thank you lord for this hour
[17:42] i pray that you'll just move in each
[17:45] heart now
[17:46] and settle each one of us if there be
[17:49] any thoughts outside
[17:51] receiving your word
[17:53] i just pray your holy spirit move with
[17:55] that person and settle them
[17:59] and draw them close to you
[18:01] and we're just careful to ask it in the
[18:03] name of jesus christ

[35:56] for us

[36:11] else
[36:14] one day in his place
[36:18] more valuable than any other day
[36:19] somewhere else
[36:23] and we're in a good place
[36:26] we're in the good place in the correct
[36:28] place
[36:28] [Music]
[36:32] we're in a place where god can do
[36:34] anything any time
[36:52] first king chapter 18
[36:58] verse 22 to 29.
[37:06] read in the name of the lord jesus
[37:07] christ
[37:19] then said elijah unto the people i even
[37:22] i only remain a prophet of the lord but
[37:24] baal's prophets are four hundred and
[37:26] fifty men
[37:38] therefore give us two bullocks and let
[37:40] them choose one block for themselves and
[37:42] cut it in pieces and lay it in the wood
[37:45] no fire under
[37:54] and i will dress the other block and lay
[37:56] it on the wood and put no fire under pre
[37:59] envelope
[38:18] and all the people entered and said it
[38:20] is well spoken
[38:23] and elijah said unto the prophet of baal
[38:28] prepared
[38:59] even until noon saying oh they'll hear
[39:01] us
[39:07] but there was no voice nor any that
[39:09] entered and they leaped upon the altar
[39:11] which was made
[39:25] and it came to pass at noon that elijah
[39:28] mocked them and said cry loud for he is
[39:30] god for he he is a god either he's
[39:34] talking or is pursuing or is in a
[39:36] journey or pre-adventure he's
[39:38] or her adventure he slippeth
[39:54] with knives
[40:09] midday was passed that they prophesied
[40:11] until the time of the offering of the
[40:13] evening sacrifice that there was neither
[40:15] voice neither any
[40:17] they need to enter nor any that regarded
[40:22] so
[41:44] [Music]
[42:14] for
[42:51] amen amen
[43:00] i'm going to keep reading in psalm
[43:03] chapter 20.
[43:08] from the first verse to the ninth
[44:02] and in the name of our god we will set
[44:05] set up our banners the lord will fulfill
[44:07] all thy petition verses
[44:10] 6 he says jesus
[44:14] know i that the lord saveth is anointed
[44:20] he will hear him from his holy heaven
[44:23] with the saving strength of his right
[44:25] hand
[44:28] some trust in chariots
[45:03] [Music]
[45:09] we call upon the name of the
[45:17] and i'm lord going to continue from the
[45:19] message i preached last time
[45:25] it's a sermon that i preach in series
[45:43] because last time we talked about where
[45:44] was the god of elijah
[45:47] in confrontation
[45:52] it was when elijah was with elijah
[45:58] and he was in the in
[46:00] in front of the jordan
[46:06] and he had to be sure that the god of
[46:08] elijah was with him
[46:10] [Music]
[46:12] elizabeth
[46:15] and we noticed that elijah before saying
[46:17] we're asking where was the god of elijah
[46:24] he had to fulfill everything elijah told
[46:26] him to
[46:52] [Music]
[47:13] [Music]
[47:23] israel started worshiping other gods
[47:28] a lot of them went away got away from
[47:30] the principles
[47:34] to the point where there was confusion
[47:53] who had the duty of restoring the true
[47:55] worship in israel
[48:00] and it was a challenge in front of the
[48:02] people
[48:15] to the people which god was a true god
[48:33] because the people of israel started
[48:34] worshiping a dead deity
[48:40] and elijah called the people of israel
[48:42] in mount carmel
[48:45] it was a battle between him and and the
[48:47] and the prophets of baal bible
[48:51] bible shows it says we read okay
[48:56] elijah was standing in front of four
[48:59] hundred prophets the number they got
[49:41] did not deny his faith because of the
[49:44] four hundred four hundred problems
[49:47] neither their way of dressing
[49:50] is unfair he didn't care about all the
[49:52] uh everything they were doing very
[49:53] importantly
[49:56] no matter how much they they cut their
[49:58] their skin
[50:01] that their blood was coming out
[50:05] they didn't bother elijah said
[50:10] was never panicked and proud of those
[50:12] circumstances
[50:13] [Applause]
[50:14] they're they're called worship remember
[50:17] even they're they're they're caught
[50:18] their bodies
[50:21] those things did not make elijah afraid
[51:20] who only had
[51:34] david
[51:48] yes
[52:32] yes god does not need that
[52:36] that's what happened we met that sir yes
[52:38] brothers and sisters
[52:40] i just want you to know this thing
[52:44] because jesus
[53:10] he never tells them to vote if they have
[53:11] to remember
[53:25] they're just there to execute
[53:44] [Music]
