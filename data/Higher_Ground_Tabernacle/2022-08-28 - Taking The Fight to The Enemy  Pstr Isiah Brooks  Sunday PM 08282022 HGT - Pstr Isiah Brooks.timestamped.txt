[26:50] done we uh
[26:53] oh we just know that God is real
[26:57] and we realize by God's grace that
[27:03] uh
[27:06] just managing this morning was a
[27:10] uh
[27:14] something that was burding me a burden
[27:17] but but God's grace God saw us through
[27:23] and I know I can't explain it
[27:26] but I know that we're
[27:28] closer now to the coming of the Lord
[27:30] more now than ever
[27:34] My Heart Cries Out
[27:37] I'm not saying that I've achieved
[27:39] everything I desire to achieve in Christ
[27:42] but one thing I do know I'm not wrong
[27:48] I know if the birds can feel it
[27:51] and the animals can feel it
[27:54] the nature is declaring it
[27:58] I know it's real
[28:01] first Samuel please
[28:04] 17 29 I apologize Brothers I
[28:08] I really wanted to sing that song but I
[28:11] guess you got to do everything in faith
[28:13] and I was lacking faith
[28:17] amen it's not your fault my fault
[28:21] but uh first Samuel please
[28:36] good to see everybody here
[28:42] first Samuel 17
[28:45] we're going to read the 29th verse
[28:58] everybody there

[29:23] we've been to ourselves and
[29:25] we thank God for the great victories in
[29:28] our lives
[29:29] we realize oh God that without you we
[29:31] would be nothing
[29:33] as we sang this morning will be like a
[29:36] drifting Ship Without a sail
[29:40] I'm so thankful to be in this message
[29:42] and I'm so thankful that you have given
[29:46] me understanding Lord too see the day
[29:49] and hour that we're living in it Lord I
[29:52] Thank for electioning I thank your God
[29:55] for choosing us all to be a part of your
[29:59] bride

[30:10] us and choosing us as a Dwelling Place
[30:13] Lord we pray tonight that you would
[30:16] bless every soul in Jesus Christ's name
[30:18] we pray amen you may be seated I'm not
[30:21] going to be long uh by the grace of God
[30:25] good to see sister Ruth I hadn't seen
[30:27] you since the victory
[30:31] good to see you God is so good to us
[30:35] and we thank God for his Amazing Grace
[30:41] some of the things that I have been
[30:42] thinking about for a few days maybe a
[30:44] week or so I'm not sure but
[30:47] I know for personally it spoke to me
[30:51] and I was studying something and I saw
[30:54] something there in the 17th chapter of
[30:56] Samuel that I had never seen before
[31:00] and it it expired it inspired me to to
[31:05] bring this little message like I said it
[31:06] won't be long
[31:08] but then I began to see a pattern in the
[31:10] scripture
[31:12] where True Believers don't run
[31:17] we don't run
[31:20] oftentimes we stand in the midst of the
[31:22] battle and we don't know how we're going
[31:25] to come out as a winner
[31:27] we can't foresee the next day or the
[31:30] next moment and sometimes it's a
[31:32] midnight for us
[31:33] but there's something on the inside of
[31:36] us that makes us trust God
[31:39] and you know when I think about David
[31:42] and and the preached dog or brother
[31:44] random preached on the message uh Faith
[31:47] by experience
[31:48] was a real blessing and I began to share
[31:51] it with some of you all but that was the
[31:53] message that stirred me up
[31:56] because really it was not Israel that
[31:58] picked the fight it was Goliath that
[32:00] picked the fight
[32:02] and Goliath was a great giant of course
[32:04] of USA we know that the one of the gath
[32:07] brothers
[32:09] you know and but but we find out that
[32:11] somehow this little fella by the name of
[32:13] David understood who he was
[32:16] and he understood it was his position to
[32:19] take
[32:19] to challenge the devil or Goliath
[32:23] because Goliath had all Israel scared
[32:26] and it reminds me of the message people
[32:28] are so afraid now they're they're afraid
[32:31] of everything and and when when the
[32:34] enemy comes in you know instead of
[32:36] running to God or really standing up for
[32:38] the word we have a tendency to run and
[32:41] hide just like Israel and we we wonder
[32:43] how how could it be Israel when God was
[32:46] so with them how can they huddle up like
[32:49] a bunch of chickens you know afraid of
[32:51] the Wolf
[32:52] but one thing for certain David had an
[32:55] experience more than once
[32:57] and you heard me say last week uh
[33:00] Wednesday I believe it was I said this
[33:02] has nothing to do with feelings
[33:04] when you know that you know that you
[33:07] know that you know that there was a
[33:09] miracle that took place in your life
[33:12] because it's unexplainable you know God
[33:15] did it wasn't because of your goodness
[33:18] what what because you thought you
[33:20] merited it but because he chose to do it
[33:23] God is Sovereign within his within
[33:26] himself and I think I started thinking
[33:29] about the many things in you've heard me
[33:31] testify but I've I've thought about the
[33:34] many things that God brought me through
[33:36] that I did not deserve
[33:41] yeah
[33:42] because I trusted him
[33:45] I never understood
[33:47] many times why I was in battle
[33:51] and why certain things had to happen to
[33:53] me
[33:54] but I could see and can see how God
[33:57] brought me out
[34:00] and so when I saw David
[34:02] the same words that Goliath spoke
[34:06] against David
[34:08] took those words because you know
[34:12] the nomination of churches do that right
[34:14] naming and claim it is what they call it
[34:18] speak it is what they say and and you
[34:22] know here it is in the message we almost
[34:24] afraid to speak it because we don't
[34:26] believe what we're speaking
[34:28] but these people they decree it
[34:31] because they believe it so much and they
[34:34] get results
[34:37] and here it is amen we who got the
[34:40] fullness of the word and Goliath and I'm
[34:43] gonna use Goliath tonight Science
[34:45] Biology
[34:48] psychology all of these things that are
[34:51] now bombarding our minds with all of
[34:55] these perverted thoughts and things and
[34:57] if you're not careful
[35:00] Goliath would take your head
[35:02] because that's what he said to David I'm
[35:05] going to take your head and you know
[35:06] your mind comes with your head
[35:09] so basically it was an attack on Israel
[35:12] but God put David why do you think
[35:14] brother Brown was screamed out I wish we
[35:16] had a lot of a lot a lot of little
[35:19] Davids look it up it's a quote
[35:22] where are all the little Davids
[35:25] We're In the Heat of the battle
[35:27] and the thing that I love about David he
[35:29] didn't run like his brothers
[35:31] but he took the battle
[35:34] to the enemy
[35:36] with one Revelation and this is where I
[35:39] call it my little one stone Jesus Christ
[35:42] is saying yesterday today and forever he
[35:46] is a God that
[35:48] and whatever he
[35:55] Ave it
[35:57] Hallelujah
[35:58] you love the Lord
[36:00] see we can't I put it this way like the
[36:03] prophet said God can't use and don't
[36:07] want no coward soldiers
[36:11] Saul was a coward Soldier
[36:15] he was so cowardly he he allowed David
[36:19] to go fight for him
[36:22] a big man a strong man the Bible said he
[36:26] stood Head and Shoulder above all the
[36:28] people
[36:29] so where did that put David
[36:32] but nevertheless it's not your size
[36:36] it's not even your religion
[36:39] brother said it's not the size of the
[36:41] dog in the fight
[36:43] but it's the size of the fight in the
[36:45] dog
[36:46] and I believe by God's grace even those
[36:49] of us who will we may not be many in
[36:51] number I didn't expect a whole lot of
[36:53] people to come this evening they never
[36:55] do
[36:57] and the reason being is because they
[36:59] don't have a revelation that when they
[37:02] miss communion they rejecting Christ
[37:06] literally rejected him you damn if you
[37:09] do and you're damn if you don't
[37:12] and they always use the excuse I'm not
[37:14] maybe I'm not ready I'm not I mean fix
[37:16] show me anybody that's ready
[37:20] who's worthy of communion nobody is
[37:23] truly worthy that's why the Bible gives
[37:26] that time for us to examine ourselves
[37:28] that we may confess our sins and make
[37:30] right before God
[37:35] but people don't understand to come to
[37:37] reject communion is to reject Calvary
[37:42] y'all understand that the death barrier
[37:45] and Resurrection is in communion
[37:48] and to reject that and say I can't be a
[37:50] part of that
[37:52] if you can't be a part of his death
[37:54] burial and Resurrection you can't be a
[37:56] part of him
[37:58] and there is no Resurrection for you
[38:01] because you have in your own way and
[38:03] actions declared that you're not part of
[38:05] that broken body
[38:08] but let's move on
[38:11] in the message Lord show us the father
[38:13] in it suffices us
[38:15] he said and I look again and happen to
[38:18] notice by the way I'm talking about how
[38:20] there was a storm and he had just gotten
[38:23] there uh in that he was in that storm
[38:25] and he found that an eagle had been
[38:27] brought down by the storm and you
[38:29] remember the little chipmunk or whatever
[38:30] that was that was making all the chatter
[38:32] chatter chatter
[38:33] but it is in himself when he saw that
[38:36] eagle he thought to himself you know I
[38:38] want you to know he's talking to him you
[38:39] know
[38:40] I could shoot you if I want to
[38:44] he said even then that he eager looked
[38:46] at him like you don't bother me
[38:49] and he said I happen to know that the
[38:52] ego had bravery
[38:54] it wasn't scared
[38:56] no matter what I'll do
[38:59] or what anything it was Brave and I
[39:04] thought that's it God
[39:07] you don't want cowards
[39:10] God wants men and women
[39:13] who's got a backbone
[39:16] instead of a wishbone When God says
[39:19] anything we believe in that's all that
[39:23] settles it God says so that makes it
[39:26] true is that right that makes it true
[39:29] that's what people understand this is
[39:31] God's word because it's God's word it
[39:35] makes this true it's true
[39:37] you can Bank on it
[39:42] think about it David was so powerful
[39:46] even as a Young Man
[39:49] he became uh can I say it I think a
[39:51] Saul's armor Bearer Saul's servant he's
[39:54] his musician
[39:57] and you know how Saul got Dave God got
[39:59] jealous of of David
[40:01] we look at the story and we read it as
[40:04] if it's nothing
[40:05] but in the eyes of Saul he wanted to
[40:08] kill David
[40:09] it got so bad he threw a javelin trying
[40:12] to feed him
[40:14] that would have been the day I quit
[40:18] but nevertheless amen David had a love
[40:20] for Saul
[40:22] even though and he understood
[40:24] Saul was not being himself
[40:29] Saul had an evil spirit on him
[40:33] because of what he had done
[40:36] and even when David could have killed
[40:39] Saul in the cave David would not kill
[40:41] them in fact he felt guilty and really
[40:44] bad for cutting His Garment
[40:48] but he wanted to show Saul if I wanted
[40:51] to kill you I could have done so
[40:54] right
[40:56] but still there was a conviction
[40:59] you touched the anointed of God
[41:02] and though he was Fallen
[41:04] he's still at that one point was the
[41:07] chosen of God is that right and even
[41:10] though we've been told Saul wasn't saved
[41:12] we realized Saul was saved
[41:17] but David even in Saul's Fallen position
[41:22] had respect for him now that's something
[41:25] to learn
[41:26] because we find out that people don't
[41:28] know how to find respect for each other
[41:31] when they fall or come short they can
[41:34] remember all they used to do this they
[41:36] used to do that listen people if God
[41:38] chose them to do that they they still
[41:41] chosen of God
[41:44] but we forget
[41:47] and we let the devil divide Us by
[41:50] forgetting
[41:54] think about it if we had the ability to
[41:57] really forgive and look into people's
[41:58] lives and hearts and become what they
[42:01] are then we'll understand why they did
[42:04] what they did and our compassion and our
[42:06] love for each other would keep us in
[42:08] that Unity
[42:10] oh it's true
[42:12] true even in this church it ain't about
[42:15] how many times you've Fallen what you
[42:17] did when you failed it's about getting
[42:19] up
[42:22] that's it that's it Christians do fall
[42:25] but they get up
[42:29] but we'll hold it like we're righteous
[42:32] we're more righteous
[42:36] and understand if you can't forgive your
[42:38] brother
[42:39] neither will God forgive you
[42:42] Matthew 6 12-15 says and forgive us our
[42:45] debts as we forgive our debtors
[42:48] and lead us not into temptation but
[42:51] Deliver Us from Evil
[42:53] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[42:56] and the glory forever amen
[42:58] for if we forgive men their trespasses
[43:01] your heavenly father will also forgive
[43:04] you
[43:05] let me tell you something I'd rather
[43:07] forgive a person for something he can't
[43:09] be forgiven of than to forgive him of
[43:11] for than to never forgive him if it
[43:15] means I've got to have more grace than
[43:16] God give me that I'd rather stand before
[43:19] God Amen with that
[43:21] then a harsh judgment are behind or
[43:24] toward a person
[43:27] but if we forgive not men that
[43:29] trespasses
[43:31] neither will your father forgive you
[43:34] your trespasses think about it and
[43:37] that's in the scripture
[43:40] all that you have done
[43:43] as a Christian
[43:45] at the end of the road if there be
[43:48] somebody in your life
[43:49] in your heart that you have not forgiven
[43:52] God said he raises every good work
[43:55] you've ever done
[43:57] and place you back in prison
[44:00] as though you've never been forgiven
[44:03] in your entire life
[44:06] now that's a harsh penalty that's rough
[44:10] and I don't think any of us want to ever
[44:12] fall into that
[44:14] what it is is that we allow the enemy to
[44:18] put these strongholds in US
[44:21] and we fail to see that these
[44:23] strongholds are there to destroy you
[44:26] and to change you and to deform you amen
[44:31] into something that God did not intend
[44:34] for you to be
[44:35] how can you ever reach perfect love
[44:39] if there's bitterness in your heart
[44:41] toward anybody
[44:43] you can't do it
[44:48] Psalms 23 1-6 says the Lord is my
[44:52] shepherd
[44:53] I shall not want I love that
[44:56] that means everything I need
[44:59] everything I need he will supply
[45:03] and I quoted this today he making me lie
[45:06] down in cream pastures he leaded me
[45:08] beside the Steel Waters that's deep
[45:10] stuffs deep deep deep he restores my
[45:13] soul I need that
[45:16] he leadeth me in the path of
[45:19] righteousness for what his name say oh
[45:21] you don't Merit nothing
[45:24] there's no good thing about us
[45:27] he only does what he do he do for his
[45:30] name's sake
[45:35] yeah though I walk through the valley
[45:37] of the shadow of death
[45:40] I will fear no evil
[45:44] and I don't
[45:46] by the grace of God
[45:49] for thou art with me
[45:51] if I don't know nothing else I do know
[45:54] that
[45:55] that the Lord is with me
[45:57] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me it
[46:01] is the word that comforts me listen let
[46:05] me tell you something it's good to have
[46:07] friends
[46:08] relatives and all that will give you
[46:11] confident kinds but somewhere they will
[46:14] come short not intentionally we just
[46:17] can't be there when you need us all the
[46:19] time but there is one thing that can be
[46:22] there at all times and that's the word
[46:25] and let me tell you something there are
[46:27] times you've got to just encourage
[46:28] yourself like David did himself he
[46:31] courage encouraged himself in the Lord
[46:33] hallelujah
[46:36] there here it is and like I said a lot
[46:39] of time we don't expect the table to be
[46:41] but the table
[46:43] thou prepares a table
[46:46] before me
[46:47] in the presence of my enemies and you
[46:51] gotta eat
[46:53] whatever he prepared
[46:55] you gotta take it is that right he said
[46:59] well what do you mean
[47:01] the Lord prepared the table before Jesus
[47:05] he had to suffer
[47:07] he he had to take everything that was
[47:10] given to he had because it was prepared
[47:13] for him Calvary was prepared for one man
[47:17] and that was Jesus and he had to walk it
[47:20] all along there was no comforting
[47:22] friends everybody was screaming I
[47:25] Blasphemous stuff people hated him and
[47:29] yet he had to walk alone carrying that
[47:31] Cross by himself sometimes you got to
[47:35] walk that path
[47:38] huh sometimes you gotta do it that's
[47:40] been prepared Lord why me why not you
[47:43] stop praying if you want to be just like
[47:45] him stop up keep on praying but if you
[47:48] don't want to be like him stop praying
[47:50] because all God is doing is answering
[47:52] your prayer tough times are going to
[47:54] come straight and narrates away
[47:57] yeah yeah
[48:00] but one thing for certain in the midst
[48:01] of all of this surely goodness and mercy
[48:03] shall follow me all the days of my life
[48:06] and I I like that word all that word all
[48:10] means nothing is left out all of my days
[48:14] and I would dwell in the house of the
[48:16] Lord forever
[48:18] you got to take listen
[48:21] one thing I learned when you take the
[48:23] battle to the devil you don't get in his
[48:25] face with your flesh
[48:28] this come by prayer
[48:31] this come by fasting
[48:33] and how she wanted the Holy Ghost so bad
[48:35] she fasted seven days
[48:37] and God gave her the Holy Ghost
[48:40] that I Marvel at that
[48:43] it was Billy Paul having been married
[48:45] before
[48:48] this is his second wife
[48:51] right and God still gave it the Holy
[48:53] Ghost
[48:56] see it throws it throws all these people
[48:58] ideas out of the way God God justify
[49:02] whom he will God have mercy on whom he
[49:06] will he give the Holy Ghost to whom he
[49:08] will and who's going to stop him
[49:11] God don't care about your theology
[49:15] God loves people that's what Calvary was
[49:18] all about do you think if I had had a
[49:21] choice to be born in another somebody
[49:23] else's family that I would not take it
[49:26] because of the times
[49:29] and it tends to have gone through y'all
[49:32] know what I'm saying everybody wish they
[49:34] would have been born somewhere else or
[49:36] something something else would have been
[49:38] different doesn't mean that you don't
[49:39] didn't love your parents but you wish
[49:41] the conditions would have been different
[49:44] right but you would have never become
[49:46] the person that you are now
[49:48] had it been different
[49:51] and that's why I thank God for
[49:52] everything that I've ever gone through
[49:54] in my life
[49:59] we've got to understand that this word
[50:01] is God
[50:02] you know I've said that so many times
[50:05] the word is God
[50:09] so if you can't believe the word you
[50:12] can't believe God it makes you an
[50:14] unbeliever
[50:16] the word is god let's say it again the
[50:20] word is God
[50:23] and when you believe the word that's
[50:25] believing God
[50:26] and God listen when Faith projects
[50:31] something has to change something has to
[50:33] happen hey God can't see you believing
[50:37] his word and say ah no that doesn't
[50:39] matter no no no those are the kinds of
[50:41] things that pleases God remember when
[50:44] Jesus saw faith that was off the chart
[50:46] he says no I have not seen such faith in
[50:49] all of Israel
[50:50] right it pleases God he compliments you
[50:54] when you can hold fast to those things
[50:57] that seems impossible
[51:00] listen
[51:02] in the message absolute
[51:04] president said and the God and the god
[51:07] that could deliver them he Hebrew
[51:10] children from the death sale of a fiery
[51:13] furnace how much more can he deliver
[51:16] this little Jewish boy out here
[51:19] you see a lot of people say I want to
[51:22] have faith and I believe it and at least
[51:24] a little wind come by you let go of the
[51:27] Rope
[51:30] you got faith faith will take you to
[51:33] your death
[51:34] I believe it till I die you should have
[51:37] said Faith don't quit
[51:38] it doesn't give up it's not Faith it's
[51:41] not based upon your five senses you'll
[51:44] see your smell your taste your re no no
[51:46] not even in your Consciousness faith
[51:49] faith call those things that be no not
[51:51] as though they were Faith don't care if
[51:53] there's a mountain in front of the
[51:56] object
[51:57] Faith believed that somehow that
[51:59] mountain is going to move or that object
[52:01] going to find a way through the mountain
[52:03] that's what faith is it's got it's got
[52:06] to be there's no way it's impossible for
[52:09] it not to happen I believe it I receive
[52:12] it I'll die with it
[52:14] it must happen it has to happen
[52:18] and one thing I'm gonna say say like
[52:20] this God don't oh nobody knows nothing
[52:22] and if he won't do it on this side he'll
[52:24] do it on the other but you're going to
[52:26] get what you prayed for
[52:29] foreign
[52:31] Hallelujah he delivered those little
[52:34] Jewish boys out here that's laying Yandy
[52:37] in a death sale how much more and if
[52:40] he's still the same Jehovah God that he
[52:44] always was we like Apostle Paul can
[52:47] realize that the saying God lives today
[52:50] yesterday today and forever I used to
[52:53] get jealous of the Old Testament things
[52:55] I know that sound crazy but I used to
[52:58] get jealous God performs you know for
[53:01] the Hebrew boys God performed for David
[53:04] God performed for Joshua
[53:07] and you know for whatever reason I I
[53:09] didn't think he would perform for us
[53:11] like that but he's the same when that
[53:14] revelation of Hebrews 13 8 comes to you
[53:17] it makes your God not small but great
[53:20] and there is nothing greater than he is
[53:25] you can't look at them like they special
[53:27] and they Jews and they had a special
[53:28] something no no no no your Covenant is
[53:30] greater than that because your Covenant
[53:32] is unconditional that means that it's
[53:35] y'all understand that God don't base you
[53:38] base uh your blessings on on your
[53:41] conditions
[53:43] you see what I'm saying
[53:46] it's what it is
[53:48] I mean you know you think about what
[53:50] Abraham did
[53:52] you know it's got to be unconditional
[53:54] sell out your wife come on
[53:59] yes ah
[54:01] right and today forever my nose is not
[54:04] running it just feel like it
[54:07] then Christians I anyway I'm
[54:10] inappropriate I'll tell you later
[54:12] Christians hope to God
[54:16] my wife says when you talk like that
[54:18] that means you're sleepy
[54:21] Christian can hold God's unchanging your
[54:24] hand I can almost hear a voice and
[54:26] change the whole situation
[54:29] Prayer Changes Things
[54:32] I believe that
[54:34] that's what we want to do how can we say
[54:38] about Joshua how is he going to cross
[54:41] the Jordan seem like God was a strange
[54:43] military man right in the month of April
[54:46] when the waters was up like that but he
[54:49] said to Joshua take the ark and go
[54:52] forward that's all he had to do and God
[54:55] moved back to Jordan and made dry
[54:58] grounds and they walked across and was
[55:01] delivered how was it no wonder Joshua
[55:04] said for me and my house
[55:08] will serve the Lord
[55:12] see
[55:13] because what it was the spies came back
[55:16] and said no you can't go there
[55:20] sorry you can't go there
[55:22] and uh I don't know what that was amen
[55:25] it ain't my phone you can't go there but
[55:28] the problem is Joshua took the battle to
[55:31] the enemy
[55:36] I never knew this thing could talk
[55:38] where is coming from
[55:40] but anyhow that means they're listening
[55:43] right
[55:47] it's what God wants us to do
[55:49] when the opposition comes don't run from
[55:52] it as if it's impossible
[55:54] no no no no no God put it there we
[55:57] forget oh the devil didn't know but God
[55:59] allowed the devil to do it
[56:02] that means you can conquer it you know
[56:05] it's the conquest is yours
[56:07] but it's not you fighting it's not a
[56:10] count of battle it's a knee battle it's
[56:13] when you begin to pray and believe God
[56:15] you trust God and you don't stop until
[56:17] you get a peace that's the problem we
[56:20] pray but we pray and we pray but we
[56:22] don't get the peace when the peace come
[56:24] that's the peace Giver he just told you
[56:27] you just won the battle
[56:31] yeah hear what I'm saying I'm gonna say
[56:33] that again
[56:34] because when the peace is given that's
[56:36] like the Holy Ghost you might not speak
[56:39] in tongues you and I might jump and
[56:40] Shout but when that peace comes
[56:43] that's God settling it for you
[56:47] now you can say I got it because I got
[56:50] the peace of God
[56:52] you might shouting days later but why
[56:54] all that you know what I'm trying to say
[56:56] I want people to understand that God
[56:58] will always vindicate your victory
[57:01] right he told Israel don't you worry I'm
[57:04] giving you peace
[57:05] right I'm gonna give you so much peace I
[57:08] want you to put the music before the for
[57:10] the Army
[57:11] I've given you the battle understand the
[57:14] battle is not yours it is the Lord
[57:17] but when God put you in the battle he
[57:20] expect you to come on the Forefront not
[57:23] run like Israel did
[57:29] I believe it
[57:31] Esther to the battle
[57:34] you know
[57:36] you know most people
[57:38] when it seems like you're outnumbered
[57:40] they really do get scared
[57:43] and they think to themselves how in the
[57:45] world I'm going to do this
[57:46] you know the problem is you you think yo
[57:50] how can I say it because your requests
[57:53] may be something that seems impossible
[57:56] to other people
[57:58] doesn't mean it's impossible for God
[58:02] I'm gonna say that again if God put a
[58:05] request or thirst in your heart for
[58:08] something
[58:09] if God now
[58:11] and
[58:13] and everything that you desire would be
[58:16] for the glory of God
[58:18] don't you ever think God cannot do it
[58:23] because if he put in in your heart that
[58:27] means he placed it there to fulfill it
[58:32] that's true
[58:35] you don't even have to be a Christian to
[58:37] have that kind of a faith most people
[58:39] when it comes to business they set a
[58:42] goal they believe it's going to happen
[58:44] and they go for it it doesn't mean they
[58:46] don't have disappointments
[58:49] this apartment is going to come but they
[58:51] realize it's just a trial it's just a
[58:54] test and I know what I want I'm not
[58:56] quitting I'm going forward and they
[58:59] normally get it they get it
[59:02] that's the difference between those
[59:04] stars out there in Hollywood they
[59:06] wouldn't give up and they would do
[59:09] whatever it costs or take
[59:11] to get the a position that they wanted
[59:13] to
[59:15] right to get it's just the way it works
[59:18] you don't sit on the couch and say I'm
[59:20] going to be president in 10 years
[59:22] no you get out there and you do some
[59:24] work
[59:26] Faith brings an action
[59:29] it's an active word you gotta show
[59:33] that you really believe that you're
[59:35] capable of doing it
[59:37] and most of all they're capable it that
[59:40] God is capable of giving it
[59:43] in every trial every test I'm not long
[59:45] I'm not long every trial and test
[59:49] is there to bring us an experience to
[59:52] you
[59:53] that will glorify God
[59:56] you know what and that's I think we
[59:58] failed to see that because we don't
[1:00:00] testify like we should and the more you
[1:00:03] testify the more God will use you Lord I
[1:00:06] want to be used by God well I just did
[1:00:08] this for you and you didn't even think
[1:00:10] or you didn't even tell nobody I did why
[1:00:13] people are so ashamed of testimony they
[1:00:15] don't know they don't testify no more
[1:00:18] but people in my day when I was coming
[1:00:20] up no matter what if it was you know I
[1:00:23] didn't have money to pay my light bill
[1:00:25] and God blessed me with the money to pay
[1:00:27] my light bill praise the Lord and then
[1:00:29] you hear the music
[1:00:36] we would dance we would Shout
[1:00:39] over over testimony such as that it
[1:00:42] didn't have to be like I won the lottery
[1:00:44] it was something small
[1:00:47] but now
[1:00:49] we don't see the testimonies no more
[1:00:53] we need to
[1:00:55] thank God for all things
[1:01:00] Psalm 27 1-5 I'm telling you if you
[1:01:04] praise him the way he should be praised
[1:01:07] there would not be anything you asked
[1:01:10] God for and he won't give it to you
[1:01:12] I know what I'm talking about
[1:01:15] and don't be ashamed Praise Him in the
[1:01:17] front of enemies and everything you know
[1:01:18] even on the job tell them what God has
[1:01:21] done for you they're going to look at
[1:01:22] you like you're crazy but yeah God did
[1:01:24] it
[1:01:27] how they gonna know God is real if you
[1:01:29] don't testify to it
[1:01:34] I tell you what really struck me the
[1:01:35] other day is when I was sent that that
[1:01:38] uh little uh testimony where the lady
[1:01:42] was raised from the dead and and I know
[1:01:45] a lot of people don't believe in and the
[1:01:47] lady on the testimony said the doctor
[1:01:48] didn't believe she said but I didn't
[1:01:49] care what he believed
[1:01:52] here she is calling the people a Holy
[1:01:54] Roller and she's acting like one
[1:01:58] and you know I know it's true
[1:02:01] because that's being the Rod's sister uh
[1:02:04] benaraz wife
[1:02:06] cousin or niece but they're related
[1:02:09] to Tabitha who's been the Rod's wife and
[1:02:13] so Joseph Hammond had already heard of
[1:02:16] the testimony but you know it gave me
[1:02:20] a joy to know that something's moving
[1:02:25] and let me tell you something God will
[1:02:28] testify he said listen if you don't
[1:02:30] praise me
[1:02:31] I'll cause the rocks to cry out he
[1:02:34] deserved to praise
[1:02:36] you know I'll tell you what our
[1:02:38] atmosphere is supposed to be energized
[1:02:40] we're not a denomination we're not in an
[1:02:43] organization we're in the word and
[1:02:45] rejoicing of the word we're you know
[1:02:48] we're at a place where we we should
[1:02:50] almost take the roof off this building
[1:02:53] really it's true if you realize what you
[1:02:57] possess
[1:02:58] and I'm gonna say it again the word is
[1:03:01] God
[1:03:03] amen and then for God to send a
[1:03:05] messenger
[1:03:06] with a message to keep us from being
[1:03:08] lost to keep us from making uh making
[1:03:11] them the same mistake they're doing and
[1:03:13] taking the mark of the beast if you take
[1:03:15] the mark of these knowing this message
[1:03:17] you willfully did it
[1:03:19] but nobody here
[1:03:21] knowing the word how can you take the
[1:03:24] mark you can't
[1:03:26] you can't
[1:03:28] you've been instructed you know what it
[1:03:31] is where it came from how it started you
[1:03:34] know from Jesus to revelation
[1:03:38] now he's molding us and making us and we
[1:03:40] say oh praise God you know you got to
[1:03:43] understand let me say it like this you
[1:03:45] don't have much time so you better
[1:03:46] redeem the time and worship God and
[1:03:48] praise him like you ought to and I'll
[1:03:50] tell you one thing if you do that you
[1:03:52] could answer at your your will and he'll
[1:03:53] give it to you let me say it like this
[1:03:55] that woman who was in Simon house could
[1:03:59] have got anything she wanted
[1:04:02] just by worshiping
[1:04:04] she didn't even open her mouth just by
[1:04:06] worshiping she could have got anything
[1:04:09] she wanted
[1:04:10] right when Esther came into into the
[1:04:13] that's why I like that Esther took it to
[1:04:15] the King right Esther took it to
[1:04:17] Mordecai right Mordecai came to Esther
[1:04:20] and and and said think not with thyself
[1:04:23] that thou shall Escape in the King's
[1:04:25] house more than all the Jews don't you
[1:04:27] think the wrath of God you're gonna it's
[1:04:30] gonna miss you
[1:04:31] because the point is of who you are
[1:04:33] where you're located
[1:04:35] understand judgment is going to hit this
[1:04:37] this whole earth
[1:04:38] everywhere there's no hiding place and
[1:04:42] the only place that is a hiding is in
[1:04:45] Christ Jesus
[1:04:46] right and Esther she said wait a minute
[1:04:49] something struck her amen and she got
[1:04:52] Anointed with the with the spirit of
[1:04:54] that moment and nobody you can't do that
[1:04:56] on your own God has to do it for you
[1:04:58] right
[1:05:00] she got anointed
[1:05:02] and I love it because she fasted for
[1:05:04] three days and and now she says don't
[1:05:07] drink no water or eat no bread right you
[1:05:09] know what that was that was her death
[1:05:11] burial and resurrection and she rose up
[1:05:13] the next day to go to see the okay
[1:05:16] right and you and I must understand
[1:05:18] because she said one thing if I perish
[1:05:22] let me perish in other words I'm saying
[1:05:25] the same thing if if I perish trying to
[1:05:27] be perfected by the Holy Spirit if
[1:05:30] whatever he has in store for me so let
[1:05:33] it be I've got to see him face to face
[1:05:36] I'm not preaching something to you
[1:05:39] that's not happening in me
[1:05:41] no it's happening in me changes are
[1:05:44] being made in me
[1:05:50] but it left
[1:05:52] with just that you know
[1:05:54] Esther didn't have nothing written on
[1:05:56] paper like we do
[1:05:58] she didn't say well we you know is is in
[1:06:01] the Scrolls
[1:06:03] no she was
[1:06:10] she was the inspiration of this message
[1:06:12] to strike us
[1:06:15] testimony of experience there because
[1:06:17] we're going to have a long praise and
[1:06:19] worship service
[1:06:21] with all of the testimonies that's going
[1:06:23] to go up before God
[1:06:27] I tell you this and I don't I don't
[1:06:29] normally say things like this but when I
[1:06:31] think I've said it here before I'm not a
[1:06:34] smart fellow I don't you know I've had
[1:06:37] um
[1:06:38] you know a couple of Strokes in my life
[1:06:40] and
[1:06:41] I feel like it affected me but
[1:06:44] nevertheless they affected me but
[1:06:46] nevertheless you know when I graduated
[1:06:48] from high school I graduated with the
[1:06:50] highest honor and and you know far
[1:06:52] scholarships
[1:06:56] and um
[1:06:59] what got me there excuse me
[1:07:02] what got me there wasn't that I was more
[1:07:04] brilliant than the others
[1:07:06] but I knew I had a had had a mama that
[1:07:09] taught me how to pray
[1:07:13] and I saw Faith but I didn't even
[1:07:16] understand it because when my mom said
[1:07:18] Junior don't worry about it this is
[1:07:21] what's going to happen it happened
[1:07:26] and there were times because my daddy
[1:07:28] left us at When We Were Young and my
[1:07:30] mother had to struggle with all those
[1:07:32] children by herself so there was times
[1:07:34] there were food a lot a lack of food in
[1:07:38] the house and mama said Junior don't
[1:07:40] worry because you know I used I used to
[1:07:41] love to eat and that's the way it is
[1:07:44] when you ain't got nothing
[1:07:49] huh
[1:07:50] where it is
[1:07:51] but nevertheless you would say
[1:07:54] we say bring some food today now she had
[1:07:57] just told me that
[1:07:59] and I'm going outside through the back
[1:08:01] door to go play
[1:08:03] and I'll open that door and there's
[1:08:04] about three to four sacks of food
[1:08:08] and to this day we don't know where that
[1:08:10] food came from
[1:08:12] but we know God brought it you
[1:08:14] understand me so she taught me Faith
[1:08:17] speak it and believe it
[1:08:20] and it happened
[1:08:22] a woman that didn't even have an
[1:08:24] education knew God in a way that would
[1:08:28] always move him
[1:08:30] when the wicked
[1:08:32] listen the Lord is my light
[1:08:35] and my salvation
[1:08:36] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the
[1:08:41] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[1:08:44] afraid
[1:08:45] you know when you wait on God
[1:08:48] that means it doesn't come when you
[1:08:50] think it ought to
[1:08:51] or when you want it to it comes when God
[1:08:54] ordained it to
[1:08:57] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[1:09:00] foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:09:03] they stumbled and fell
[1:09:06] and though a host
[1:09:07] should encamp against me
[1:09:10] my heart shall not fear the wall should
[1:09:13] rise against me in this will I be
[1:09:16] confident I wasn't even a Christian and
[1:09:19] I had a gang of girls surround me want
[1:09:22] to fight I didn't fear because I didn't
[1:09:24] even know they wanted to fight
[1:09:27] they wanted to beat me but I I said the
[1:09:30] right things and didn't do nothing well
[1:09:32] I didn't know until finally later on to
[1:09:34] it down the road I'm like what
[1:09:40] what thing I have desired of the Lord
[1:09:44] that I will seek after y'all might I'm
[1:09:47] telling you
[1:09:48] I was in I was in Brazil and a brother
[1:09:51] was taking advantage of me and he was
[1:09:54] literally belittling me in front of the
[1:09:57] Brazilians and the Guyanese and they got
[1:10:00] so angry at the at this brother they
[1:10:02] wanted to fight him well I was in
[1:10:05] oblivious I was
[1:10:07] I didn't even know it
[1:10:10] they thought it was all his character
[1:10:15] I just ignored him
[1:10:18] ah
[1:10:19] and they remind me today to this day
[1:10:21] they admire me for handling it the way I
[1:10:23] did but God blinded me y'all understand
[1:10:26] me he Blinded Me
[1:10:29] one thing I desire to the Lord that will
[1:10:31] I seek after that I may dwell let me
[1:10:34] tell you something
[1:10:35] is that right this is the rapture
[1:10:38] scripture
[1:10:39] he said one thing
[1:10:41] out of all that's been said one thing I
[1:10:44] desire
[1:10:46] that I may dwell in the house of the
[1:10:48] Lord all the days of my life to behold
[1:10:51] the beauty of the Lord and inquiring his
[1:10:53] Temple for in the time of trouble he
[1:10:56] shall what hide me in his provision
[1:10:59] in the secret of the Tabernacle shall he
[1:11:01] hide me he shall set me up upon a rock a
[1:11:05] revelation
[1:11:07] see every Victory brings testimonies of
[1:11:10] the Lord's doing
[1:11:11] right now I've been here long enough
[1:11:15] so I'm just going to read these and then
[1:11:16] we'll go into the communion
[1:11:19] I wait patiently for the Lord
[1:11:23] and he inclined unto me and heard My Cry
[1:11:27] see let me say it like this
[1:11:30] if the enemy is coming and you are
[1:11:33] suffering and you're going through
[1:11:34] things
[1:11:35] you're talking to somebody else and
[1:11:38] trying to reason with somebody else
[1:11:40] it's not the solution to your problem
[1:11:43] the solution to your problem is prayer
[1:11:47] When you pray
[1:11:49] ER changes things
[1:11:52] change the conditions of everything
[1:11:55] around you
[1:11:57] listen if you got an enemy on the job
[1:12:00] pray
[1:12:01] ER my sons they always call me this is
[1:12:05] what's happening not always but they
[1:12:06] call me and and and usually they'll get
[1:12:08] a promotion or the brother the person
[1:12:10] get moved out of the way or get fired or
[1:12:12] something I mean it happens all the time
[1:12:14] you don't have to scream at somebody on
[1:12:16] the job because they scream at you you
[1:12:18] pray
[1:12:20] Lord this is my enemy that's what David
[1:12:22] did
[1:12:23] avenge me oh God you can't fight but he
[1:12:26] can
[1:12:27] he's your Shepherd he brought me up also
[1:12:30] out of a horrible pit out of the Maori
[1:12:33] claim and set my feet upon a rock and
[1:12:36] establish my goings hmm
[1:12:40] you know that listen people this might
[1:12:42] sound crazy but way before I was just a
[1:12:45] young people across the church and uh uh
[1:12:47] Christian and I had this manager she
[1:12:50] wanted she had me in her mind
[1:12:57] come on the job one night all drunk and
[1:12:59] stuff and looking at them that ain't
[1:13:01] happening
[1:13:03] you know what God did he moved that
[1:13:06] woman
[1:13:09] oh yeah
[1:13:10] and I wasn't tempted no no no no no I
[1:13:13] was not tempted
[1:13:15] but he moved her she got in my way I
[1:13:18] tell you that
[1:13:19] she was my boss so she could have fired
[1:13:21] me but nevertheless the next day when
[1:13:25] she came back to work she was so a shame
[1:13:27] of her what she tried to do
[1:13:32] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:13:35] any other she wasn't ugly
[1:13:42] you understand me
[1:13:43] if I was looking for something she would
[1:13:45] have been pleasing to my eyes
[1:13:47] but I was not y'all understand me
[1:13:51] he have put a new song in my mouth even
[1:13:54] praise unto our God many shall see it
[1:13:58] and fear
[1:14:00] and shall trust the Lord so I said all
[1:14:03] that to say that's what I'm trying to
[1:14:05] tell you let me let me hurry up through
[1:14:07] this
[1:14:09] brother Adam calls her spiritual
[1:14:11] astronauts
[1:14:13] he said a spiritual astronaut is
[1:14:15] controlled by unit also a unit of Prayer
[1:14:21] that controls the spiritual astronaut
[1:14:24] keeps him lying up uh-huh is prayer oh
[1:14:27] it's good I tell you God had a little
[1:14:30] unit setting on Earth one time when his
[1:14:33] first astronaut was here and you know
[1:14:35] one little touch of Faith stopped him
[1:14:38] and that has that answered him back
[1:14:41] Prayer Changes Things
[1:14:44] it changes positions by prayer
[1:14:47] that can control see we see what can
[1:14:51] what can be done in the natural
[1:14:54] and it's a type of the spiritual
[1:14:57] the spiritual happenings it can be
[1:15:00] controlled that way y'all hear what I'm
[1:15:04] saying with attitudes and everything
[1:15:06] else goes wrong on the job and and and
[1:15:09] and and the enemy tell listen you heard
[1:15:11] me say that time amen when the man said
[1:15:14] well I don't have a job for you well I
[1:15:16] didn't go home and you know crying and
[1:15:19] worried because I know God what God told
[1:15:21] me by the time I got home that manager
[1:15:24] had called back told my wife to come
[1:15:26] back tell me to come back and I got the
[1:15:28] job was one of the best jobs I ever had
[1:15:33] he made a position for me do y'all
[1:15:37] understand what I'm saying
[1:15:39] he made a position for and and I don't
[1:15:42] want you to ever think that's impossible
[1:15:43] because God said in his word if you
[1:15:46] whatsoever you desire
[1:15:50] he'll give it to you if you abide in my
[1:15:52] word and my my word abide in you living
[1:15:56] as close to God as you possibly can God
[1:15:59] said it
[1:16:00] he'll give it to you he'll do just what
[1:16:03] you ask him to do because he know
[1:16:05] whatever He blesses with you blesses you
[1:16:07] with you will glorify him
[1:16:10] we love the Lord I I you know I I'm
[1:16:13] saying this from now on don't run from
[1:16:15] the battles
[1:16:17] what I've been doing is just setting
[1:16:18] myself aside praying fasting and I'm
[1:16:21] praying and fasting not just for myself
[1:16:23] but others
[1:16:28] and having victory in this church and
[1:16:31] that's who I'm praying for I'm praying
[1:16:33] for the people here and I believe I
[1:16:35] believe God is has answers to my prayer
[1:16:37] I'm just waiting for the manifestation
[1:16:40] yeah yeah yeah that's that's it
[1:16:43] that's it I can't do it but I do know
[1:16:46] the greater Shepherd who knows the enemy
[1:16:48] of far all
[1:16:50] you love the Lord
[1:16:52] it's about time for us to prepare for
[1:16:53] our communion
