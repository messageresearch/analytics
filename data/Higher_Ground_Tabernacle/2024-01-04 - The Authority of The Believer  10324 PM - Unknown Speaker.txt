shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth amen we'll go to Jeremiah 29 11 14 and it reads for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayeth the Lord though are thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end [Music] then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me amen when you shall search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you sayeth the Lord and I will turn away your captivity amen and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you remember that he says where I have driven you sayth the Lord and I will bring you again into the place when I called called you to be carried away [Music] captive let us pray our gracious father we come before you Lord Jesus we know Lord we know without the blood of Jesus none of us would be worthy to stand in your presence father because of what you have done for us because of the sacrificial lamb of Jesus Christ we can stand before you in a bold way if there be any sin if there be anything that may have left out in my confession pray father that you forgive us cleans us from all unrighteousness Lord bless this service in a special way let your Holy Spirit anoint your people anoint your word break and Destroy every yoke of the enemy Lord and we'll be careful Lord to give you the praise glory and hon Jes Christ name we pray amen amen you may be seated we' like to entitle the message tonight the authority of the believer if I had a subtopic I will entitle it this is who you are we read the Bible as a book a story book sometime a book of history or excitement but every word of God is connected to us that's true because God is the word and we are connected to the word one thing I love about the Bible brother Bram said is the greatest love story God has not come to destroy us the Bible said he came to give us life and that we might have it more abundantly the trouble with with us the trouble is with us the word of God is perfect as it is but the saddest thing is is that we have not come fully realize who we are Israel is because of their neglect to remember who they were and who their God was were they they literally uh moved away from God so so that you understand Satan never comes in your face and says I am the devil worship me Satan is a shrewd fellow in being believe you not Satan has patience he moves slowly when it comes to his agenda accomplish something he's never in in haste it may takes him years but if we are not careful if we're not watchful of him if we don't know our enemy will lead us back into captivity Israel had been freed remember Abraham came from bondage a place called Babylon where everybody worshiped idols and all and God called him out of the land of Chala and made a promise to him that he would be blessed above all people and not only will he be blessed but his seed will be blessed let me say it like this if it wasn't for the blood of Jesus all of us would be wiped out Hallelujah I mean the Bible says we had all sin come short of the glory of God but thank God we had one who could rescue us and Deliver Us from the snares of the enemy years Israel was in captivity hallelujah amen at Babylon and the reason why they were in Babylon in captivity because they failed to walk in the word of God but you no matter where they were those who were in Babylon it never changed the relationship that they had with God every one of the Sons and Daughters of God that was in Babylon were still Sons and Daughters of God is that right I mean it didn't change Daniel's position never Chang shra could have been the position they were always Sons and Daughters of God and let me tell you something even if you captivity now does change your relationship with God we must be encouraged because God has an expected end hallelujah our latter end is a great end it's a end of Victory Hallelujah but we must come to recognize who we are listen when God sets you free of anything you got to fight for it Israel though she was free to leave Babylon she had to fight she had to fight to get to Jerusalem Hallelujah and she had to fight to remain there and she had to fight to build the wall of the city again is that right and that wall was important Hallelujah so I'll say it like unto you when God deliver you from something you got to fight to get there you got to fight to remain there and you got to fight to get that wall built but you're not the builder of the wall in this instance it is a Holy Spirit who is a wall that he that wants to surround you but listen that wall cannot be formed around you until the wall is on the inside of you Hallelujah think about it you and I have an authority a god-given Authority that we often sometimes forget I'm raising my hand because sometimes when Satan battles you and fights you you literally forget like James says we we look into the M mirror of Liberty and we walk and forget the kind of man we are when you forget the kind of man that you are that's when Satan can attack you Hallelujah let me let me go now to Genesis 1 just to refresh our minds on who we really are Genesis 27-29 God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and sedo it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth hallelu so we can understand God had given us dominion over the fish of the sea is that right God gave us dominion over the Earth God gave us dominion over the fows of the air Hallelujah God gave us dominion over every living thing that moved upon the Earth now you say well what do you mean that was given to Adam but we were in ad so when God gave this authority to Adam The Authority was broken it was taken from him because of the Fall Hallelujah but even so it did not change his relationship with God Adam died a saved man Hallelujah why because of the blood of the L understand me once a son is always a son once a daughter it's always a daughter nothing can change that hallelujah amen and God said behold I have given you every her herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the Earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of the tree yielding seed to you it shall be for [Music] meat so in reality everything that God created was for us hallelujah it is ours is that right remember the time when David uh went and ate the shoe bread as if he was out of order but David had a revelation of who he was not only did did did did uh uh David do something that was a little uh looked like it was out of order but Jesus they went in the field and they ate corn Hallelujah but in reality amen people thought that was wrong to do but for some reason they had a wrong understanding of the scripture because it was not against the law eat eat eat eat the leftover corn that which once Harvest was come it was in order for you you can go in and eat you just couldn't bring out with Hallelujah but nevertheless it was still God's corn amen I'm trying to get you to see something here because when we realize what God did to us and for us I often I often wonder how did Jesus have power to walk on the water the reason why he had the authority to walk on the water because the water had to obey him it was his water and we don't know what he spoke if he spoke anything at all but but he was so much God the water had to Humble itself y'all hear what I'm saying hallelujah we we're in the image and likeness of God I'm going to say something just a moment let's go to Genesis 5 I'm not going to be long tonight 1 through two these are scriptures that we know you there y this is the book of the generation of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he [Music] him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created Hallelujah now it it it it it if it looks and and and when I say it like this because Adam was a basically the the god of the earth and his wife had his name as long as she stood on the word b the same name Hallelujah and that name Adam was an authority to all nature everything God had had had given Adam was subject to the very name yall hear what I'm trying to say if you can follow that you can see what I'm trying to say the first Adam his name was Authority his name represented God his character represented God everything about him represented God there was no flaw in [Music] Adam Hallelujah you say yes it was no it wasn't Adam willfully sinned when he rescued his wife Eve you hear what I'm saying Philippians 2 9 through2 that's why the Bible says meditate on this and that's what we don't do most of us don't we don't meditate on the word read it we may even preach it but we need to think about it because once when you're thinking about it and meditating on it God can speak to you hallelujah it's just what he does when you hit that channel can hear God talk Hallelujah when nobody else can hear him talk when no one else can hear him speak you can hear him but that's how it happens in my studying I I I start studying something then also God he jumps into fellowship and he began to tell me what to write down I couldn't come up with these thoughts it's God's thoughts because God represent how could say you and I represent God no matter where we go whether you feel like it or not you and I represent God Amen Philippians 2 9 through 12 see the world hate this they hate this kind of a thing Hallelujah because the the the the the the the the the definition of a worldly Christian is an attachment to God we are not an attachment to God hallelujah we're part of God we're Bor of his bone flesh of his flesh and as long as you feel like you are an attachment you'll never come to understand who you are hallelujah hallelujah he was an attachment God in Adam and Adam was God in her one FLH one Spirit Philippians 2 9-2 wheree God also highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should B vow of things in heaven and things in Earth and things that's under the Earth doesn't that sound like genesis The Authority Hallelujah that God gave to Adam now has been restored back to us by the second Adam by by and because of his name Hallelujah yes sir that every tongue should confess Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father Hallelujah this is done for his own pleasure this is for God's Own pleasure Hallelujah I I us to sang this song years ago I'm so glad Satan is mad he thought he he he he missed this Soul he thought he had amen amen hallelujah amen when you know when God when Jesus went down into Paradise he basically bankrupt Satan Hallelujah he he left him with nothing Hallelujah and you and I must understand that God is going to do the same thing in your life he's going to take every ounce of Darkness away from you just like he went into the reasons of the loss he's going to go in here wherever the darkness is he's going to remove it Hallelujah he is a separator he separates the night from The Day The Darkness from light Hallelujah the rich from the poor the righteous from the unrighteous that's what God does and this is what he's doing now he could not leave Israel in Babylon because he promised that he would restore is that not what God Said in the Book of Joel I shall restore said the Lord there shall be light in the evening time Hallelujah and now God is separating the we from the tear hallelujah hallelujah amen wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling amen that that word work is an action word that means you don't sit back and say God do it Hallelujah is that right Adam had the authority in the garden but he used the spoken word to get the work done hallelujah and God has restored that spoken word back to the Bride of Jesus Hallelujah not by power not by might but by my spirit say the Lord you see why it is important we must receive more of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah the portion that we're now working with is not Hallelujah but there is more of him is that right that's what brother Ram said he talk about the man with the pie once he got a piece of the pie and it was so good he said I know there's more of it and that's how it is when you get the Holy Ghost it's more of it in filling of the Holy Ghost every day sanctifying yourself every day confessing every day that you're Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah we listen that's the truth the Bible told Israel put the word in your forehead where let and necklaces and whatever you must need do do this so you will always keep me before you Hallelujah and the Bride of Jesus Christ always keeps him before her with Christian Soldier Maring as to with the cross of Jesus going on before you must realize the battle is not yours the battle is the Lord and you got to keep him before you in order to win this war Jesus must go before you Romans 8 16-8 hallelujah hallelujah oh y'all thought since we had such a good night on on on on New Year bother I'm here to tell he I don't know about you but he pull out everything on me but you see I'm still standing Hallelujah no weapon formed against me shall prosper Hallelujah and you got to believe that for yourself hallel is that the right that's the word Romans 81618 when it looks like you defeated the devil is deceived you that you are we cannot be de there is no possible way it's like being lost we cannot be lost somebody sent me a little little saying when I look at myself I can't see how I could be saved but when I look at Christ I can't help to see I when I look at Christ I didn't know that I cannot be lost I may not quote it just right but don't you get what I'm saying every time we look at s we say no way it can happen look how look how I am but God don't ask you to look at him look at Calvary look at the CR hallel look at the blood that's where your Victory is hallelujah no man was worthy you're not worthy I'm not worthy but the blood of Jesus christes worth Hallelujah like that brother brought out the other day is like filthy rags come on somebody that's bad Hallelujah if you think about it that's rough and God knew exactly what he was doing when he described it like that Hallelujah Romans 8 the spirit itself bearth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God let me ask a question how many of y'all believe that you're Devils I'm so glad y'all heard me clearly I you I rephrase that one time said how many of y'all believe that your serpent seed and S didn't he it right she just threw her hand up it brought some shame to her but nevertheless it's always good to hear because I don't believe any of us believe that we're serpents there's only two seed serpent seed in God seed Hallelujah and if you ain't the serpent seed you know that it means you're the seed of God receive the word as a as a seed of God and if children then hes hes of God join a with Christ Hallelujah if so be that you suffer with him that you may also be glorified together glorified together 18th verse for I reckon they said Paul must have been Southern but I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us I don't care what you go through in this life hallelujah hallelujah said well I'm a fair I fall all the time brother said we are failed to begin with amen God don't need us to help save us it is the Lord who preserve our souls I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worth to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US Glory oh my H see we got to I say we because I'm including myself this Bible must become your mind because this Bible is the mind of God the holy spirit is well but brother said the Holy Spirit feeds off of the word hallelujah let me go back here where the scripture say their name was called Adam and this is not an accident Eve's name was never restored by Adam she never came back to the name Adam she remained Fallen you hear what I'm saying and he could never restore her back to the name the character of Eve could never be changed Hallelujah until the second Adam came and it was Adam who called her Eve he named her God never named her Eve because he was the god of the earth God had to listen you understand me God placed him in authority and whatever he said that's exactly you brother I don't know about that well let me just say it like this when Elijah called for those bears that was El y'all hear what I'm saying so you got to realize when the prophet says something even if he doesn't say th said the Lord You Better Be watchful hallelujah amen amen he knew what she had done with the serpent Hallelujah she remained Eve until the day she died Hallelujah why because the name changed was because the the the character has changed understand even even if you say I'm I'm I'm I'm the bride you you that that CH your character must change Paul said put on the new man you got to put him on in order for your name to be bride but don't get don't get it wrong we got to fight for it we got to press into it it doesn't come easy even though God has given us the liberty Hallelujah God had given is uh Israel the promised land for every inch of we of Jesus Christ we got to fight for every you may stumble you may fall got to get up hallelujah hallelujah huj there is no condemnation those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Hallelujah you say well I failed in the flesh that's the only way you fall it's your flesh that makes you fall Hallelujah if your flesh was Sanctified if your flesh was full of the Holy Ghost you understand me but your flesh won't be redeemed until it's almost over that's the last thing why this is your testing ground this is where you got to be tried Hallelujah but just like Adam I always think about that I said somewhere Adam was supposed to do that serpent let that serpent roam around y'all hear what I'm saying that serpent should have been bound y'all hear what I'm saying oh you said what do you mean Jesus bound the serpent he said you can try her you can touch her but don't you take that allil in that wine understand that that that that real part of her you can't touch her y'all hear what I'm saying and and but but the second Adam he comes along and he binds the serpent she can't even try you he can't he serpent can't even try you without talking to Jesus [Music] first y'all hear what I'm saying hallelujah and God demonstrated that with job and y'all don't want to believe but God get you in trouble he put you right there in the spot Hallelujah y oh my I fell I came shot do you think God oh I didn't know that no sir God done already fixed it before you even fall already fixed it you know why he said that God said before they even call I hear their voice I heard you Hallelujah because he knows what's on the inside and let me tell you something you know what's in the inside nothing but victory victory is in you hallelujah oh you might look like you might be like down like Sam but what theil didn't understand was different he had something more powerful than Goliath and the change they had in Bound with he had the deliverer on the inside is that right and that's what we have think about it think about it think about all the things that God has brought you through you didn't do it it's God who it all Hallelujah many times you probably felt like turning around there something holding hallelujah what was that it is God in you the hope of glory hallelujah hallelujah amen but the second Adam came to restore the nature and by restoring the nature he restores her name Hallelujah and gives her a name like his name cuz when we are Miss Jesus Christ it is speaking character hallelujah amen see and the position of her fall he came to restore he had to die for her to bring her back to that position Hallelujah she was called the church but every Church age fell like eeve but God predestinated a little group a special class of people that will meet the challenge of the hour stand on every word of God she is born B bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh Hallelujah let me say it like this she is the beginning of God's creation somebody you see when I say that because the Bible said the Jesus Christ is the beginning of God's creation he created first he created a male and female he created Jesus are male and female hallelujah we're not the last we're the beginning Hallelujah theeg that's beauti Hallelujah see she was in him Before Time began and it's now come to be manifested of Hallelujah she was with him when he went to Calvary and every Victory he won because she was in him you got to meditate on it Hallelujah that's why the word of God says hallelujah she is so Justified it's though she's never done it in the first place because she takes on the nature of Christ never A Hallelujah to the Sea for hallelujah thank you Jesus amen this is not a Time be so burdened and none of us like to come short but when we do the Bible said we have an advocate with the father hallelujah look what brother says in the provid provided way 19 53 Hallelujah he said a Christian Church will produce the Bible evidence these signs should follow them that believe say say the master root the root and offspring of David that's right these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast our devil and speak with new tongues serpents and bring deadly things lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover this will be practiced till the end of the world when I come these things are not supposed to die let me tell you what I believe we do many of us wait for a group reaction is not a group this an individual reaction Hallelujah even though he said they shall lay hands on the you are one of them Hallelujah and God just need one man in his Hallelujah you and I must begin to think like that going to Hallelujah yes sir not wait on the church you wait on the church D this is an individual thing come to know who you are hallelujah hallelujah amen and he never said will will I find TI people he never asked that will I find good religious people he never he said will I find faith return that's it faith is the thing find it people confess to have it their prove that they haven't got it you know them by the fruit they bear Hallelujah glory to God that don't mean when you stumbl and fall when you are consistent in in your wrong livu Hallelujah you understand me this is who you are you understand me the authority of God has been given to his [Music] brideu and just as Jesus said in John 10:30 and my father are one we must come to that status must come to that place that is the plane that God wants to see us on Hallelujah not by power it's not by might it's by the holy spirit let me tell you something this is why the church is are lacking we're not putting enough stress on the Holy Ghost Hallelujah but we we we we're like a car without the fire Hallelujah without the Holy Ghost we can look as good as we want to look we can have everything in order without it gives us nothing it profits us nothing say this to you the Holy Ghost is more than shouting the Holy Ghost is more than dancing the Holy Ghost is more than running it's more than than what we display it as being the Holy Ghost is the Life of Christ Living in you and me Hallelujah Ephesians 3 amen 14 to 21 for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven in Earth is name did you get it this Your Name Lord Jesus Christ understand that you see what I don't understand that but let me ask you the question then at the white Throne judgment who will be setting in the throne with him judging the people huh his wife she will be there amen hallelujah amen and when he receives a name that name is given to her too that's the sequence of the word whatever it may be she receives the name too is that right well the Bible say she'll receive a new name hallelujah oh God let me tell y'all something your mind can't fathom it neither can mine but one thing for certain I believe that it's like like Mary says how can this thing be how can it be but yet Lord be it unto me according to Thy word hallelujah don't think what your head think with your heart Hallelujah listen that we would Grant you you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that's the way that Christ May dwell in your what Hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with the Saints what is the bread and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of [Music] God let me tell you something I'm stop just right here not stop but remember RAB she was a harol in Jero Hallelujah and guess what she was seed yes sir amen she was seed and no no no doubt her life was horrific and God knew who she was but God always has an appointed time and AO season for your deliverance it's just that way it's not like he's not going to deliver you but his mind is far beyond ours and his thoughts and ways are Beyond ours it is what it is hallelujah hallelujah but when it's time nothing can defer it can change it when God is ready you will be ready hallelu it's your truth let me tell you let me say it so you can see it again did you know God knew that Peter had a hot temper had a role to play God couldn't remove he could have removed it he had been healing everybody else delivering everybody else but he left Peter the way he was because he foresaw Peter he knew Peter was going to cut the man ear off he Peter was going to deny him but he needed all of that to play out because that was the script but then that same Peter was delivered and then wrote to us then wrote in the word the statue of a perfect man see God he works a mysterious way Hallelujah that's good don't ever think God said let me say it like this God said all things work together for the good of them that love God amen amen I wonder how we would have taken the test like Joseph did who had dreams and Visions who had to walk with god did nothing wrong and yet he was thrown in a ditch hated of his brothers sold to Egypt had deal with p's wife then had to De those lying the ones who was delivered like that brother said Just remember me that's all he asked and that's all all Jesus asked we just took communion he said remember me that's all God asked us to do as long as we keep him on our mind we don't have to worry about the devil it's when we forget him hallelujah amen is that all right right it says and to know the love of Christ which passes not that he might be filled with all the fullness of [Music] God so you understand God's will to be filled with the fullness of God and now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power power what that worketh in us wait a [Music] minute you don't even know that there's a power working in you there is a power working in you Hallelujah is that right like that song would say please be patient with me God is not through with me yes and he's still working on me how many of y'all is he still working God is still working have you reached Perfection yet by faith but right now I'm still climbing by the grace of God hallelujah unto him be glory in the church by Christ jesuses throughout all ages World Without End am uh uhuh he he he didn't say to he didn't say to to the bishop be all glory to the pope be all glory to the pastor be all glory and so and it's so funny because when in in the denomination of church the bishop is the big man but in the Bible the Elder is greater than the bishop but in the world you got to be an elder before you be Bishop Hallelujah I'm almost done 63 you pray for me and I'll pray for you Luke 4E and the devil said unto him all this power I will give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whosoever I will give [Music] it if therefore will thou worship me all shall be thine and and Jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me Satan amen for it is written thou shall Worship the Lord thy God and him only shall thou [Music] serve so so that you understand that you are the god of Satan yes sir and if there's going to be any worship let him bow to you you say Satan won't bow yes he will if your character is right will bow to you Legion saw Jesus coming and he said have you come to to torment us before our time then they broke down and prayed Lord let us go into the see even the devil's got to pray Hallelujah so you and I must understand that the devil talk about about you all the time when you are victorious they tell tell their buddies about you you don't want to go knock on that door so they know you but then when you weak they come in a gang yeah they come to jump you as they say hallelujah but let me tell you something it could be 800 Philistines you have the power to defeat him understand me Hallelujah and he brought him to Jerusalem the ninth verse and he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pentacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down from hence for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against the stone and Jesus answered and said unto him it is said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God amen and when the devil had ended all the Temptation he departed from him for a season you know in in in in in the days of King Aur Esther was his wife and the King was God to the people and whenever the king spoke something his word could not come back void regardless of what he it was because remember when when the king made a decree Jew would be killed he could not recant he couldn't take it back but he but but God in his wisdom gave him a way to get around it and he made another law that the Jews would be able to fight and defend themselves so you can understand when I say that that that the Bride of Jesus Christ is join HS with with with God and and she has the same Authority because here was Esther with the authority of the king he gave it to she came to have a banquet and when he saw he said I give you over half of the Kingdom so God gave us this this this Authority we didn't have to ask for it and and guess what about Esther she received it she knew she had the authority and the power Hallelujah but she she was humble with it Lord can you call uh nonon call hmon to the to the banquet and she knew she was setting up a trap she understood it she knew she was setting up a trap now brother B said God work on both ends she had been fasted three days and three nights you know God was talking to her Hallelujah and she set him up guess what she was the one who judged him not only did she judge hmon but she also judged his sons his whole house was destroyed and who would judge at the end that's all I'm saying it will be the wife of God bringing the Judgment Hallelujah is this okay yes amen I'm almost done just just forgot where I was and got excited here okay I'll be coming with a quote here for it is written he should give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee but Jesus did what put him in his place hallelujah amen he love the Lord and the Bible says Rejoice all ye Holy Angels and you Saints upon the Earth for the kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our God and of his Christ and he shall R Satan took Jesus up on the mountain showed him all the kingdom of the world and said these all are mine give them to you and Jesus said get thee H Satan that's right he was he wasn't caring he said if my kingdom of this uh if my kingdom was of this world I could call any Legion of angels Hallelujah but my kingdom is not of this world but my kingdom is in heaven and he said the kingdom of God will be within you Hallelujah so therefore the legions talking about Jesus Legion so therefore the legion and the powers and the backing of the Holy Angels Hallelujah said he said in you this morning by the deity of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said yes sir let me read this again he said so the kingdom of God will be within you so therefore the legion those Legions that Jesus would have called and the powers and the backing of the Holy Angels Hallelujah is in you this morning by theity of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah this is who you are who are you this morning who is Christ Jesus he is in you as much as you will let him [Music] be trying to get into you move into you today and you stand off and wonder and look and beh hold and be hold back a little while that move right straight into the bosom of God here hallelujah hallelujah one more quote that was coming from the de of Jesus Christ now Hallelujah same same same uh message paragraph 32 you know now that's all all all I'm interested in friend I'm here out there I pray for the sick but in here I'm interested in one thing and that's God's Born Again Church one thing is that right brother ROM even call his message the Holy Ghost that's right he said that's what I'm interested in I'm not interested in bylaw and all orders of churches I'm interested in the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon the church but this day that we're living in that's the fundament part and that's what we're looking for Hallelujah now he says I'm almost done he says in the deity of Christ paragra 80 and that's the same power same Christ Hallelujah let the fundamentalist let them people who deny the power of God say wrong but that same power the world into existence in those people got the Holy Ghost that's right men and women it's time we find out who you are is trying to hide you back you some little cow down you not you are the sons and daughters of God the deity is not in heaven it's in you Hallelujah I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize the almighty God lives in you immortal immortal life Hallelujah my life I give the life of God is in the human being hallelujah hallelujah 84 he said brother when the deity of God by the Holy Ghost comes into the human heart calls out everything that Christ hasn't created you know that's the truth everything that's what I'm saying all the darkness the Holy Ghost is going to get rid of it that's the truth I didn't say you were going to get rid of it I said the Holy Ghost would get rid of it Hallelujah he separated the darkness from the night hallelujah amen doing it again one more time can I say this 98 one more but that is the god the Creator living in you giving you all the power and you're in possession of anything that he has so is it in you to abstain from Evil to do good to shine evil ande to righteousness to turn away from temptation all malice hatred so turn away from it but all that that'll take him from your heart if you receive him Embrace him and love him and hold him in your heart love him I can tell you the church I can tell you the church together in the kind of a power has power to bind the heavens open eyes blind hallel the speak the speak and the death hear walk see recognizing the power God in your heart he is the deity Hallelujah and that's what God is calling us to recognize he is in the house hallelujah hallelujah one more one more please one one more know and I'll let you go he said in paragraph 109 he said what makes the people cry and Shout what's the matter if the holy ghost moving in them if they could only realize Embrace him embrace the Holy Ghost believe him hug him to your bosom live right do nothing that would hinder him say oh Lord Jesus I want you I want you to stand by me I'm going to stand by you father and as long as you do he is just pressing to get into you he wants in he is ring you to him all the time now friends I know that that to be the truth I know people don't realize who you are every person in here live above sin live without sin live in God you'll make mistakes but the blood of Christ will forgive you Hallelujah father forgive them they know not what they do is that right the same power of Christ that was hung on calvary's cross the same God hallelujah amen the same God I lost my place I'll be there in just a minute God is so good 110 M yeah the same God that raised him up on the day of the Resurrection is in you you that God the Holy Ghost don't you love him oh my hear his voice call today Hallelujah we we'll just stop there God is so good to us hallelujah and I appreciate everything that he does hallelujah there was more but we which time it's time to let let's stand we've got to recognize Who We Are the brother brandom said that once we do we will become an invincible Army we can think we know but it's a different thing when your heart knows it displays God in a different manner Hallelujah one thing I can truly say I know I'm pressing toward the mark of a high but one thing God stripped me of even during this uh weekend and I know that I have to be really careful he took away all fear that's all I'm going to say he took away allar and I surely thank God for that because I know that no matter what I must go through I have a crown of life waiting and I know that my journey is not in vain I don't fear that my life is not by chance your life is not by chance Hallelujah I don't know what I got this thing right or not but um we know that every step we make has been ordained in order hallelujah amen the Bible says who knows the mind of God and who can instruct him and so it doesn't matter who we are and where we come from at the end of the day we'll be there because of him because of his blood because of his grace because of his mercy and this is not the season to be overtaken with condemnation when Christ has paid the price and has made the way he said if you confess your sins that God is faithful to forgive you of your sins and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness and I don't know about you but I have to make confessions every day throughout the day day but one thing for certain I know my redeemer living and you going to have to come to recognize that in order to re re re re re retain your joy and keep your focus you must always remember that you are born of God hallelujah you love the Lord if there be anybody that desire [Music] prayer you in moment like I sing song I sing out the love song to Jesus in moments like this I lift up my hands
