TRANSCRIPT
========================================

in these parts you may just take your seats praise God and I'm so happy to be here and we know what the word of God says vers ever two or three GA together in his name that he's there in the midst to bless praise God and I believe that he's here this morning and we come to recognize that the pr of God says there is no preacher that can bring the Revival Revival doesn't come in a suitcase praise God you are that Revival and when you come with a right mental attitude you will receive from God hallelujah and I want to let you know there is no preacher upon the face of the Earth can bring anything new to you amen hallelujah because all all has has been spoken all has been said is in the message of the hour that God has provided through a very Prophet Hallelujah and we come to realize that people they talk about deep Revelation and high Revelation but you know what I discover men have gone so deep that they drowning themselves in their own deepness amen hallelujah because we serve a god who's a god of Simplicity Hallelujah and you know and God the greatness of God is in his simplicity so we truly thankful to be here this this morning I want to bring you greetings from the church back in Georgetown Guyana they send their greetings and their regards to you and also for my family and we truly thank God for this privilege to be here and you know I never really expect to be here at this time but God has arranged it to be so because there are so many invitations time after time but you know God have his time and you have his season praise God so we truly thank him to be here and I'm happy for the invitation from Brother Isaiah and also brother Jesse from Ohio and we truly believe that you know it will be a blessing and I'm receiving a blessing just to see the different faces Allelujah of the bride of Christ in Fellowship in this season and we truly believe that we living in the end time praise God but this there's a message of perfection which all the Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah is coming to the fullness of the light of the hour that God has given unto us I like to sing a song before I Minister the word of God I know it's one of my favorites we know it's a congregational song but it means a lot to my heart fill my way every day with loveallah praise God and we truly thank God for his love that it's because of the love of God that is why we are here today Hallelujah if it was not for his love we would not have been here praise God God's love it it broke everything every [Music] barer let me walk blessed Lord in the way thou has gone leading straight to the land above giving cheer everywhere to the sad and alone fill my way every day with with love oh fill my way every day with love as I walk with the Heavenly dark let me go all the while with a song and a smile F my way every day with love keep me close to the side of my savior and guide let me never in darkness rule keep my path free from wrath and my soul satisfied fill my way every day with love oh fill my way every day with love as I walk with the Heavenly D let me go all the while with our song and a smile fill my way every day with love soon the race will be your and I'll travel no more but I abide in my home above let me sing blessed King all the way to the shore fill my way every day with love let's sing together fill my way every day with love as I walk with the Heavenly do let me go all the while with a song and a smile fill my way every day with love fill my way fill my way every day with love as I walk with the Heavenly do let me go all the while with a song and a smile fill my way every day with love amen praise God hallelujah what life would have been without love Hallelujah not the love of man but the love of God because the love of man can wax cold and it can it can get weary Hallelujah and we even find the song writer says the love of God is greater far than tongue or pen can ever tell it goes beyond a highest sky and it reaches to the lowest hell so when we look at each other faces we can truly say that we seeing the love of God hallelujah so we thankful to be here this morning praise God at this time we all could stand together as we turn into our Bibles praise God we want to read from the scripture the book of St Luke chapter 21 reading from verses 25 to 28 and I would like to speak on a little thought this morning the perplexity of Life the perplexity of life and we come to realize the time and season that we living in there's so many things that are happening but we want to thank God for grace and his love and his mercies that we can come into His presence St Luke chapter 21 reading verses 25- 28 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the Stars and upon the Earth distress of nation with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's hearts are failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory amen and when these things began to come to pass then look up Hallelujah and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh gracious God in Heavenly Father we want to thank thee for the reading of the portion of your word this text Lord but we pray that your presence come and give us the context of your word we give you the praise the honor and the glory in Jesus name amen praise God you may be seated we so thankful to be in the house of God Amen and we come to realize that you know the the prophet of God tells us that every angle of the Scripture it points you back to Christ Jesus the word praise God so the subject this morning is the perplexity of life and perplex it means to agitate or trouble attained by the movement of its parts to and fro to cause one inward commotion take away calmness of Mind disturb his eunity to disquiet make Restless to stir up or to trouble to strike one's spirit with fear and dread to render anxious or distress to perplex the mind of one by suggesting Scruples or doubts and we find that this is the spirit of the age today Hallelujah that there doubts and there confusion Hallelujah but it's here in the gospel it talks about the lexity Hallelujah and the proud of God spoke of the perplexity of life and what we see that is happening and from the message Comm communion paragraph 40 the pr of God tells us that we cannot prophesy now of good things to this modern world the only thing that we can prophesy through the spirit is disaster and we see that is happening around the world we don't have to go too far Hallelujah we see disaster troubles earthquakes great tidal waves all are prophecies that is being fulfilled am sun and moon failing Allelujah the church in the lisian age Christ outside a door knocking to get in amen and we see that is happening we see just the other day the moon how it became red and what condition it is amen we see these earthquake the tsunamis and all these tornadoes what is happening yes Hallelujah it is a sign of the time that we are living in Hallelujah but to the bride of Christ Jesus says don't be fearful look up your Redemption draw night Hallelujah but what is happening today because of faar and scres and all these disired conditioning people they are looking around to see what is happening Hallelujah they are looking for a better job they are looking for a better future but the only future that you could have Hallelujah is coming into Christ Jesus in receiving the fullness of his word Hallelujah and not in an intellectual conception but receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life Hallelujah that is our safety today and that will save us from every condition that is existing Hallelujah so when we look over disasters and everything that is happening saints of God we know that these things must be we know it has to happen but for you the believer in Christ Jesus saints of God you are Beyond those things because God has given you a faith Hallelujah because you have a anointing praise God to rise above every condition but when you see the troubles around and people are being fearful saints of God it means that they have not come to the place that they can have an experience with Christ Jesus because when you have an true experience with him saints of God you're going to come and you're going to sit at his feet and you're going to cast all your cares aside it's not that we not troubled and we not worried saints of God but when we put everything upon him he's the way maker he's the provider for each in every one of us and we truly want to thank God this morning for his great love and mercy in the great coming revival and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit paragraph 36 tells us it says I tell you brother today if there ever was a time since I remember or any time that I can read in history since the going away of our Lord Jesus Christ the coming of the holy spirit in the first age is today there's signs there's moving in the mulberry trees God is moving ahead in this nation just as sure as anything signs and wonders are being begin to appear that we see we at the end time we're right now merging into the greatest Revival do you believe that we are merging into the greatest Revival that this world has ever seen Hallelujah when we talk about the world we not talking about everybody in the world when we talk about the world we talk about his world hallelujah praise God so we right now emerging into the greatest destruction that ever hit all mankind since we ever was a world this time and season the whole world is falling apart amen hallelujah in the Old Testament says the world is going to shake it's going to reel like a drunken man amen hallelujah Heaven and Earth have to pass away but the word of God will never pass away sints of God that is why why you got to feed upon the word and what we feed upon that is what you'll become and when you become the word for this day saints of God you part of God hallelujah and when you become part of God there is nothing in this world that can stop you from serving God hallelujah so don't let a disasters and the troubles and all these things take a hold upon you Hallelujah because the Bible says to be carnally minded is death but his spiritually minded is life eternal and we come to recognize that we are not looking at the things of the world because it's just a passing show Hallelujah God's word is eternal and you are also Eternal because you are in the mind of God before the foundation of the world before any one of these things can happen saints of God you are already safe and secure Hallelujah people running to and fro upon the face of the earth going into different places for safety but the only safety that you could find saints of God is getting into the Ark of the hour it's getting into the word for the hour and when you get there Saints of God you stay there Hallelujah because this word is our refuge in the Old Testament when somebody did something wrong not willfully they have to run and when they run into the Refuge City saints of God they are safe amen hallelujah so no matter what you have done if you're a true son and daughter of God you don't do anything intentionally to be wrong amen hallelujah but when you make a mistake you could get back into the presence of God and God will forgive you hallelujah praise God remember one time brother Dy was in Guyana and he was preaching and he say you know when a Believer you know when a Believer do something wrong is a mistake Allelujah because a true elected child or seed of God don't sin you only make mistakes and he also say uh when The Sinner Man on the outside do something good is a mistake because all the time they always everything they do is always wrong Hallelujah so we want to thank God Hallelujah that the mistakes that we have made God look Beyond fault and he saw that need amen hallelujah so we come to realize because of the perplexity of time and all these things that are happening we see men are more nervous more than any other time Hallelujah men are suspicious more than any other time and there is a mistrust upon the face of the Earth Hallelujah and because of the spirit of the Antichrist against the word of God you find it even creeping into the church the house of God but saints of God a house of God should have that Unity of the faith that we must have a trust we must have a confidence in the word of God hallelujah we must know each other saints of God in the place that God have called us onto that we are a redeemed people amen hallelujah that we could come into the presence of God and have the Fulfillment of his word hallelujah we got to stay with the fullness of the word for the hour so we come to recognize that there's a the greatest Revival that will ever hit the face of the Earth and it's on right now hallah it's on in the true elected seed of God it will not be a worldwide Revival that the Pentecostal denominations and what they are looking for they are looking for a big great move but God hallelujah is moving in a Simplicity and even people around the message they want to see a big Mighty move but they're failing to see what is happening right now Hallelujah when Elijah was in a condition when he heard the thunderings and the earthquake and all those things God was not in those big Mighty move but God was in the still Small Voice Hallelujah and that's the way God is moving amongst his bride today Hallelujah because we come to realize it's the invisible Union of the bride of Christ Jesus praise God and unconsciously you see the word bride Hallelujah is forming by the very word of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so the scripture is true that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded forth out from the mouth of God hallelujah and so we want to thank God is our praise God for the message for the fivefold ministry which is God's Dr way for the bride in this hour and you have to respect whatever Ministry that God plac you under because you are a privileged people many time you go places people complain about a Ministry they complain about this they complain about that but you know what contentment with godliness amen is great many times you don't know what you have until you don't have a Allelujah so we got to thank God for whatever God has given onto us hallelujah many timesday there people are playing the story of the dog and the bone I don't know how many you know that story the dog he had a bone in his mouth and when he was crossing over by the little water you know it was so mirrorlike that he saw a dog with another bone in his mouth and that bone seemed to be so big and he was so coitous he dropped it to get the order and when he dropped that he lose everything that he had so saints of God you have to take inventory what God has given unto you you have to cherish God gift that he has placed among you praise God to rec I that he's the same yesterday today and forever and God always uses man amen hallelujah but what happened man man uses devices Hallelujah and the power of God tells us that you know we as God's people hallelujah we should we must be in the service of God hallelujah and whatever we we do if we not doing what God will have us to do and we do otherwise we are paralyzing the program of God because of our unbelief because of our condition we are paralyzing the move of God but God want us to live by his grace and do what he wants us to do so we see the time and the season that we living in that a proud of God says the only thing we can prophesy about is disaster and troubles and no good in this modern day Hallelujah but we come to recognize that with all of this condition God still have his bride Hallelujah the pr of God said nothing is out to cater with the bride of Christ she is just in a rightful condition Hallelujah and we just want to stay with the word of God in a message of pill of fire praise God paragraph 8 he says but I believe that we living in the days just before the coming of the Lord he says now if it's fanaticism to believe that then I a fanatic amen all what we seeing that is happening around us hallelujah we see that the world is falling apart amen we see everything every sign and everything that is happening is scriptures are being fulfilled Hallelujah you have to be blind or out of your mind before you don't recognize what is happening even a man on the street who don't have a knowledge Hallelujah of this message they can tell you that something is happening and things are different Hallelujah but if we are the ones who claim to believe the message of yahwah and we not seeing this then something is happening amen hallelujah that we are blinded and we are twice plucked up but we want to thank God for the revelation of the hour he says friends I know this that I believe that God is fixing to do a real hurrying work how many you believe that Hallelujah God have a hurrying work to do and it's among the true elect Hallelujah so saints of God we got the proud of God said the time and season that we living in we got to be on our toes Hallelujah we got to be on our peas and our cues as we normally would say for some person to be on the toe you're very cautious about you're doing but you're on the Move Hallelujah we have to be on the move for God in the hour that we are living in because we will be overtaken if we cannot move when the word tells us to move amen hallelujah because God never changed his mind about his word he is the same yesterday today and forever so saints of God let us stay with the fullness of the word for the hour that God has given unto us so whatever happen on the outside it shall not Shake us it should not worry us it should not trouble us and drive us into fear that what is going to happen to my job what is going to happen to my children what is going to happen saints of God get into the ark Hallelujah get the get into Christ Jesus is the word for the hour and when you receive the fullness of the Holy Ghost in your life Hallelujah not your troubles will be over but you have a security that there is nothing that can stop you H because as long as you have life inside of you there are battles and there are struggles and you can never stop that H because the devil he will the proud of God say he's going to punch you down punch you going down till you going down to the grave and said the only chance that you have how to retaliate is while he's pun in at you that's the only time you have so it means that you're engaged in battle you are in a Warfare saints of God and when you're in a Warfare you don't turn your back on the enemy because God did not give us protection for cowards to turn your back on the enemy God give us a courage that we'll face the enemy and we'll fight because God called us hallelujah to stand upon his promised word hallelujah and don't turn to the right nor to the left but stay upon the promised word of God that he has given onto US Hallelujah Israel and the church paragraph 57 he says now we coming down to the last plague last thing God said I'm I'm tired fooling now I'm going to give the last plague that was with the children of Israel Hallelujah coming out from the land of Egypt when Pharaoh was so stubborn and God allowed him to be stubborn or to harden his heart that a power of God can be manifested so now I want you to notice the last plague was yet now we had earthquakes we had wars and rumors of wars we had tidal waves as Jesus said would be the sea roaring man's Hearts failing Hallelujah more heart troubles he says number one disease fear perplex of time distress between Nation Horseless carges in the Broadway all these things fulfilled these things are happening Hallelujah and we see what is happening around the world we see all the heads of governments and we see the perplexity we see wars and rumors of wars but the word of God tells us that when they cry peace peace then there'll be sudden destruction and all the peace talks that they're going on with in the Middle East we see what is really happening the word of God has to be fulfilled huah the heads of the governments of the world they're calling for a new world order but the only new world order that you have Hallelujah it will be with a bride of Christ Jesus Hallelujah because the word is the greatest order Hallelujah man's order is disorder amen because they make laws and they break laws but God Don't Make law and break law God is a perfect God hallelujah and when he started out in the beginning saints of God is that same word that is coming for today Hallelujah so we need to stand upon the promised word of God hallelujah praise God so the we got to thank God for this great love and mercy that he have provided for us so we see the power of God says here but the last plague is death and he says listen now not physically speaking but spiritually speaking death spiritually in the church yes you don't have less people coming to church you have more churches you have more evangelists you have more preachers more than any other time Hallelujah but how many are complying with the word of God how many are really being called of God back home we said there the CNT ones and they have the scn ones so we got to we got to come to recognize Hallelujah where our calling is hallelujah and the calling is not man calling you hallelujah it's of God before the foundation of the world that he placed that inside of you Hallelujah so we truly thankful for God he says you notice it was among the sons spiritual death the church has got more members than it ever had how many you agree with that Hallelujah thriving better than it ever did and yet the weakest in spirit that it ever was my that's true that's just like it was in Egypt and S what happened way back then was just types and Shadow but today it's a reality Hallelujah so the season that we are living in it's the unfailing realities of the promised word of God we see that is taking place yeah and every prophecy that has been spoken is being fulfilled in our day Hallelujah and everything that is happening God is bringing us onto Perfection and he has giving us that strength that we could stand that is why he gave us his word for this hour the greatest encouragement that you could have saints of God is when you receive the fullness of Christ in your life amen hallelujah I don't mean just when you come to understand and you when you could read all the messages and listen to all the messages but it's when that life that revelation of that can come inside you because the word said a letter kill it but a spirit give life Hallelujah that is why there's so much of Confusion And there's so many doubts and Scruples and fears and Hallelujah anxiety around the message but saints of God we ought to look up because our Redemption Jo nigh God is good to his people hallelujah so we come and see what is happening the one of the what me say the greatest disease that is still killing men today is heart disease the the word word say men's hearts are failing for fear Hallelujah and you know when you look around the world it truly say that men are suffering more men are suffering from heart attack more than women that's true that's why he said men's heart are failing for fear Hallelujah but saints of God God want to create in us a clean heart when you have a clean heart there is no devil in hell that can come and bring anything to drop it down here you want to have a pure Spirit saints of God that when we come into the Pres pres of God we think no evil must have no art against your brother or sister Hallelujah why because if we have anything against each other we cannot make the Rapture amen for us to have rapturing faith we must have the revelation of true forgiveness Hallelujah and true forgiveness is not with our mouth and is not to put on a smile but it comes from the depth of your heart Hallelujah when you truly come Hallelujah with a penitent heart many times is not a smile on your face Hallelujah but it's something in the depths of the inside hallelujah praise God so we want to thank God for the season that he has placed us when we look around the proud of God in handwriting of the wall tells us in paragraph 52 the Bible said there will be signs in heavens above Hallelujah we got saucers flying saucers that a pentagon can't even think of what they are there's so many mysterious things that is happening around the world and the scientists of the day they have no answer amen it's just like the time Hallelujah when Daniel was there in the time of Nebuchadnezzar there were so many things happen and they have no answer the world leaders have no answer the scientists they have no answer but every answer is in the word of God every answer is in the message of the hour Hallelujah because this message that has given to us saints of God it's prophetic Hallelujah and everything has to come to pass hallelujah praise God in this time and this season that we are living it's the best time for us amen hallelujah for the true elected seed of God but it's the worst time for those who are not believing the word of God because this is a time of judgment this message is life and this message is death all in a time of Noah the same water that saved Noah and his family that same water that drunk the people the same very word that is so precious to us hallelujah the same very word is bringing judgment upon those who cannot accept the word for the hour are you not a privilege people today to know that you could accept the word of God in the depth of your heart to be Sons and Daughters of God marching into the army that he have called you onto hallelujah praise God Mystic signs in the heaven upon the Earth sea Roar tidal waves earthquake in diver places all kind of things happening Hallelujah when we are little children going to school we never hear about tsunamis and all these big Mighty waves that's right Hallelujah but in the past you hear about earthquakes and when you hear about earthquake now probably 10 years 5 years after then you hear about another Earth earthquake but now it's happening so rapidly and people are getting so accustomed to these things that their Fe is not nothing amen hallelujah just the other day when they had the tsunami in Japan they were telling you about the earthquakes and people they were testifying and saying you know they're so accustomed to the earthquake you see just as though God is preparing his people for the Rapture the devil is preparing his people for Destruction amen hallelujah and they will so fall into it that they will not even realize what is happening until they're being caught up with whole thing Hallelujah so we want to thank God for Grace we want to thank God for the hour that we are living in Hallelujah that he can love us so much Hallelujah that we can have the revealed word so Mystic sign in heaven upon the Earth sea roaring tidal waves earthquakes in D places all kind of things happening but it's very sad he say and the church lukewarm they can't even see through a meeting or rather set through a meeting what's the matter it's because the Bibles got to be fulfilled the handwriting is on the wall he says America and Russia if they want to you know they never display their best Hallelujah and he said we don't either amen God keeps the best for the last Hallelujah there always a surprise for the enemy when the enemy think he got to you know I I really like this thought Hallelujah when the devil you know you got to thank God when the devil is after you Hallelujah if the devil is after you that means he don't have a hole upon you that's right Hallelujah so we want to thank God in this hour that when you have your trials when you have your testing and all these battles the devil is after you amen hallelujah praise God so we come to realize today that when the enemy comes and want to bombard your mind with all kind of conditions and thoughts and these kind of thing you just let him know amen hallelujah of of his end when the devil want to remind you about your past you tell him about his future am he don't want to hear that Hallelujah because he know what future he have but he's so barefaced Hallelujah and he's so stubborn he want to come and mess with God's people but it's coming a Time Hallelujah he will be whipped you know what a shame it is for a woman to beat up on a man amen hallelujah amen you know back in Guyana there's a a little story that they had some friends and they always would go and they will hang out and they'll talk how they can fight and how what they can do and all these things and one F always boasting that you know his wife she always got to get an D on her knees and and she have to beg him and everybody feel you know that he was such a big bad bully but what happened when he goes home his wife would put such a liquor on him he will go and hide under the bed and when he go there she got to get down and he said come come out from under there get out from there so that is what the enemy is all about all what he is he is a bluff Hallelujah but we want to thank God for Grace we want to thank God for his love in this hour that he has provided for us hallelujah that when the enemy comes in like a flood there's a standard that is being raised up against him could you imagine the stubbornness of the enemy there's so many time he's being ripped and he's being beaten and B but still he's coming again I think that's a part that that should be the bride of Christ no matter how much licks you get Hallelujah you have a greater hope you know that you have a security Hallelujah that you could come and don't let nothing in this world discourage you coming at the end of their Journey there all kind of discouragement that will come along your way because of the perplexity of life and what has taken place Hallelujah but don't look at these things look to the word that is our absolute when we can look to the fullness of the word of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so when you look around us we see what is happening the pr of God says now to to those without a hope those without Christ without God they're lost in the world you're in a miserable condition those without God hallelujah is it's not those coming to church people can still come to church and don't have God hallelujah you see God didn't call us to be Benchwarmers or to have a good place in the church but our position must be placed in Christ Jesus Hallelujah that's the position that he wants us to be Hallelujah so without God lost in the world you are in a miserable condition but those that are in Christ Jesus should be happy and lift up your head for Redemption draw it nigh hallelujah it's wonderful to know that Hallelujah so we come to realize that in Romans chapter 8 tells us there is therefore no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus Hallelujah but there's a sad condition today people are boasting of the message church that they're going to and who's their pastor and where we fellowship and we are the elites there is no Elite hallelujah it's one God it's one baptism it's one heavenly father and we are all one in Christ Jesus Hallelujah and we come to realize that God a love me more than you and he don't love you more than the other saints of God his love is being shed abroad amongst his sons and his daughters Hallelujah I want to let you know this morning God don't have any favorites amen hallelujah as human you might have favorites unconsciously Hallelujah whether conscious or unconscious God don't have no favorite Hallelujah we all part of his bride hallelujah praise God whether it's a big church or little church but the word of God said fear not little flock it is a father's good pleasure Hallelujah so saints of God that should make us happy to recognize today the position where we standing upon the promised word of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Hallelujah remember the prophecy of the the prophecy of the Chicago earthquake and all those shaking what was happening when are proud of God when when he saw exactly what was taking place when the scientists didn't even know what was happening until the prophet of God prophesy about the S Andre's fault fault and what was taking place and then the scientist they start to look at it so God hallelujah he knows every condition there is nothing that can hide from God he's the Creator he's the maker he's the Redeemer he's everything in this hour Hallelujah so we want to thank God so what we see all these things that is happening today the proud of God say it's the finger of almighty God moving telling you that end time is at hand Hallelujah you flee from the Wrath to come Hallelujah why because God have called us in this hour that we could stay with the fullness of the word of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and as we stay with the word but what is taking place today we we come to realize whatever is happening the proud of God says in a message trying to do God a service without being in his being the will of God paragraph 47 he regulates the church he predestines the bride to meet the season that they are living in amen how many you believe that amen hallelujah he is doing that today Hallelujah he regulates the church he know what's the need of every believer Hallelujah he predestinated the bride to meet the season that they are living in so everything is in the hands of God Amen Hallelujah and if everything is in the hands of God we should be secure we should be free we should be happy we should be the most happiest people today upon the face of the Earth that when we come into the house of God hallelujah praise got that Joy is inside of you that is bubbling up Hallelujah he says even nature itself tells us today as we see nations are breaking the Earth sinking in the handwriting is on the wall we see the church and the state it's in we see the bride and the state she is in amen you should know for yourself where you at and what is happening because today hardly you find that people are really being encouraged when you see them you say how are you doing brother say man what I'm going to tell you I'm trying and things are so hard and things are so difficult you a bride when you're a bride you're under expectation H because there's a there's a marriage hallelujah praise God there's a reception that you're going into but today look at the condition of the heart of man today because there are twoo carnally minded the word said to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life Eternal Hallelujah so we come to realize what is taking place even nature itself tells us today we see nations are breaking the Earth sinking handwriting on the wall we see the church and the states it in we see the bride and the state she's in and We Know by Nature that the church is getting ready to leave yes do you have leaving on your mind Hallelujah that is what we should have not the leaving of the world but leaving this Earth amen hallelujah whether you're young whether you old or middleaged we should have that

head against the wall but we know exactly what has taking place so when all these things are happening they are just buzzers that set a heart alarm he says Lord that we know to be ready we don't know what time or hour it we might appear so we come to realize what has taking place but you know what the scripture says there's a way that seeth right unto man but the end of the ways is death but remember God needs no interpreter he's The Interpreter of his own word all what God is calling us today saints of God is to believe his word because all things are possible to him that believe it amen and we got to believe that word Hallelujah with all our heart with all our soul with all our strength Hallelujah that God has provided for us stay in line with the word that he has provided for us so

daughters to be there Hallelujah God has prophesied it she's rotten it's all of her system and she's got to do that to rut away whatever you see happening the scriptures are being fulfilled why that's what that's why she said I said she is so nervous and red in the face and frustrated he's talking about the Earth and earthquakes everywhere and up and down the coast and tidal waves in Alaskan and shaking up and down the coast huah of earthquakes and things and people writing shall we leave it shall we leave it see they don't know what to do people just don't know what to do but you as the bride of Christ Jesus you know exactly what to do Hallelujah see what is happening today God is preparing a people unto himself and that people saints of God God is looking for a character with all these things that are happening Hallelujah there's a people upon the face of the Earth that God have Hallelujah so we come to recognize that we have to suffer to reign with him amen but this suffering is not for our stupidity because you find a lot of people they suffer because of their own stupidity and they want to spiritualize the whole thing and say oh because of this gospel because of this message but water to be deception that is why they can have no peace and they can have no joy but when you suffer for righteousness Hallelujah it don't matter how it comes on you know that there's a hope and there's a joy how many you believe that how many you have experience that when we suffer for our own stupidity we feel so messed up Hallelujah but is for the truth you say come on let the pressure come on because there is something inside of you that is giving you that strength Hallelujah the proud of God s this morning church age paragraph 171 one is in the church age book chapter 4 many of you know this portion of the little quote here unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him Hallelujah you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering today people don't want to suffer they don't want to have the birth pains but we have a saying no pain no gains Hallelujah the reason for this is that simply character is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift alah know sometimes we receive gift and we're not worthy of that gift sometime a gift is being misset but when it comes to character you have to earn that character is a victory not a gift a man without character cannot Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule Hallelujah so no human being upon the face of the earth is fit to rule Hallelujah because there is no character the only character is in Christ Jesus Christ and his word hallelujah and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcome and is sat down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him so we have to overcome all the perplexities of life and everything that is happening around us that we could reign with him Hallelujah we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering Hallelujah we go through now it's not worthy to be compared and he says to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes amen what a hope what a treasure what a joy what a peace that we have that God has provided for us he says oh what a treasure are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation amen hallelujah what is building through all of this that is happening God is giving us the the opportunity that our character can be built that we could come to that place that we must be worthy hallelujah praise God to be part of that Rapture because we are feeding upon his word amen hallelujah what is character it's in an individual somebody considered in terms of Personality or behavior or appearance distinctive qualities the set of qualities that make somebody or something distinctive especially somebody's quality of mind and feelings think of it what God through his word Allelujah with everything that is happening is to build character that we could be worthy of his appear of his coming Hallelujah because we already have his appearing Hallelujah and if you miss the appearing you want to miss is coming and a lot of people it's missing it and it's very sad to recogn what is happening saints of God we need to be on the right track amen by the grace and the mercies of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so we come to realize where we are at today Hallelujah so the only safety zone that we could have is in Christ Jesus the word amen because it is being fulfilled in his word today hallelujah praise His Wonderful Name broken sisters paragraph 46 someone called me not long ago from up in the East and said brother Bram I hear you move to Arizona and you formed a place where that there is safety and as soon and as you know how the message come and the Lord told me what would happen in Alaska and how down through California it would be and it's just being that way they said now if that's shaking and everything where is the safety zone Hallelujah that was way back then 49 years ago it was being said so where is the safety zone he says there is no safety zone that I know of Hallelujah yeah that's in Christ for those that are in Christ will it's the only one I know amen so you see how simple it is hallelujah the only safety that we could have is the message of the hour the ark for the hour that we can come in yes Hallelujah God's provided way what is it it's God's warning to you people when we see all these things happening he said it's God's warning towards his people to prepare to meet God he says get ready why should I prepare to meet God brother brandham he says brother you prepare for

for those who are really wanting to escape the wrath of God the only way you can escape the route of God is getting to him it is being said that the best way for a criminal to hide is right under the nose of the law Hallelujah and the best way for you to escape the rout of God is getting into him is receiving him and be obedient to him Hallelujah that you can become one with him amen that is the best way that when judgments strike all around you are in safety sir Hallelujah let us get wrapped up tied up and Tangled Up in him hallelujah praise God get in Christ now where you safe each one of those animals they went in two by two God always makes a way for those who are really wanting to escape the rod of God amen hallelujah what a time we are living in Revelation chap 3 20:22 tells tell us behold I stand at a door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will comeing to him will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcome and I'm sat down with my father in his throne he that had an ear let him hear what the spirit sayeth onto the church hallelu God want us to have that ear Hallelujah that we could hear that we could recognize and we can realize our position in this day that God has provided Hallelujah that we could see what is taking place saints of God we have a great hope Hallelujah there is nothing for us to be afraid of H in a message thinking on our ways the proud of God was saying in paragraph 7 you David was saying I'm told at David I'm told at the time of writing of this Psalms that he had been in trouble Hallelujah and many times Sons and Daughters of God we find ourselves in trouble but there's a hope and David was just a man like all of us that he had his ups and downs and his differences and he had being very much in trouble and the proud of God says here God has not promised to to go through any believer to go through without troubles he a promised us to go through without troubles but he promis Grace sufficient to take care of these troubles isn't that wonderful we all have troubles but he give us Grace enough God didn't call us to pray to to take away the Temptation our trials but he want us to overcome so he give us an opportunity that we can have all these troubles and all these things that are happening around us but when we see the perplexity of life and what is happening around us the proud of God said that there only buzzers to set our hearts alarm to recognize the time and season that we living in and we ought to be equipped for the journey amen hallelujah and everything for this journey is in the word of God is right here you don't have to run and jump on a a plane or get into Mars to get it Hallelujah you get down upon your knees and cry before God the word say they that are Hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled amen hallelujah so we got to come in God's provided way so but he has promis Grace sufficient to take care of these troubles that's what trills my heart you said that is trilling our hearts it's to know that his grace is sufficient no matter all that we do and there are sometimes we even think that we have crossed the line and we want to give up but other words his grace is sufficient Hallelujah no elected true Born Again seed of God can ever commit the unpardonable sin no way it is not possible Hallelujah because the seed of God in you cannot sin hallelujah praise God so what Thrills my heart is to know that his grace is sufficient all of our depths and troubles and frustrations yet God has promised to see us through that's just as much as we could ask of him knowing that he knows the road saints of God he knows the road he knows the way Hallelujah so we come to recognize he knows the way he is leading us are we willing to follow are we willing to go in God's provided way now the final quotes is from Israel and the church paragraph he says notice and don't you un underestimate Jesus Christ either because he is the power over all power don't be afraid of Satan as long as you are in him but if you're not in him you better tremble but if you are in him not even death itself can harm you you're free from all fear oh when I think of that I want to shout hallelujah amen when we think there is no fear in the word there is no fear in love Hallelujah there is no fear in this gospel that God God has given unto us the only fear that they have is the fear of God and that will bring you onto righteousness that will draw you closer to him Hallelujah the power of God even says we thank God that there men and there are still men and women hallah upon the face of the Earth that can be so that can be so close to God hallelujah that the devil don't know what to do with them don't you want to be in that position do you know what a position it is that you want somebody want to fight you and you stand and give you the very best and you still stand up and look at them it's a terrifying thing you could imagine what goes through the heart or the mind of that person who give his very best and still see you standing there there is no fear in love SS of God so consider the time and the season that we living in and the perplexity of life and and what is happening Hallelujah we just got to stay in line with a full of the word of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ because we come to realize hallelujah what is taking place in this dark sinful hour Hallelujah just to be Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah in his presence you know God wants us just to be the way that he would have us to be you see when God finishes with us a long life Journey he'll change our nature completely when God finish with you you end up like J Jacob Jacob became a prince with God you know we got to look at what is happening all these things are just buzzers that we have to take inventory of our life and we got to look to the word of God just think on our ways and to see where we are at if you're in the word of God you are in safety zone you're not you are in trouble I always remember Jacob on his way back home and we are like Jacob on our way back home that in our life no matter what we do and what we have done sometime we try to be smart to try to do things that you know that we can survive Jacob tried that and it came a time in his life that all his tricks run out from him and that is what is happening today but saints of God in this life there is no tricks but when God finish with you have you ever thought or read of any what me say ch personality in the Bible but when go with some of us we end up like Chinese become liming the proud of God tells us he says when God finished with Jacob he became a limping Prince so I just slow it down a little you know know just a little humor in the thing but we come to realize that when God is finished with you saints of God the world cannot have a ho upon you and you're ready to face your enemy when God was finished with Jacob he was ready to face the esa with all the perplexity of life and everything that happened when God is finished with you Hallelujah there's no devil in hell can come near you the proud of God said when God is working upon you the devil cannot have a hole upon you and when God is finished with you the devil can't even come near you hallelujah what a position to be in Christ Jesus how many you love the Lord today saints of God we have a remedy for every condition that faces us hallelujah upon the face of the Earth and we want to thank God for Grace we want to thank God for his love we want to thank him for his Mercy Hallelujah and every good gift and everything God has provided for us because we recognize the time and the season that we are living in it's a priv privilege to be Sons and Daughters of a Lord and Savior Jesus Christ God bless you just sing a little chorus before we turn the service back to your pastor victory is mine victory is mine let us all just stand together victory is mine victory is mine Victory today is mine I told Satan to get the behind Victory today is mine one more
