soul Hallelujah [Music] God is good to us he's going to get right into the word of God shake the Lord Jesus thank you musicians I'm really beginning to understand that scripture the kingdom of God suffered violence and the violence take it by force when we know that God is Worthy of all praise sometimes even our own flesh fights against you but you got to push you've got to take control of the situation because Satan would love for us to give God something that's haphazardly and you know but God wants us to give us his all right we appreciate the Lord I know that there's victory in Praise I was thinking this evening when I as I was coming to church how that you know there was a time that God told uh the Joshua and Moses or you know just told the children of Israel just put the music before and uh we realized amen sometimes we that music comes to cast out Devils people say they don't believe in that but truth music will cast out Devils because the word of God uh tells us that that that's how he he has done it in the past and he's the same yesterday today and forever even when uh Saul had a bad Spirit on him uh we know that uh uh David would play music and it would just drive the evil spirit away it's something about consecrated music today or tonight we're just going to preach on a message uh that I mean I I've enjoyed putting together uh by his grace but uh as we talk let's uh speak as we let us turn to Colossians 2 10. today has been a busy day for me but uh I appreciate every every moment of it um everything he's done and is doing for us today the message that really inspired me Is possessing the gates of the enemy Colossians 2 10 and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and Power Colossians 4 12. you there ephra who is one of you a servant of Christ salute you always laboring fervently for you in prayer that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God that really blessed me uh that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God one more scripture First Corinthians 15. beginning at the 57th verse but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved brethren be yeast that fast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us truly you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves and Lord we don't even fully understand all that's going on in our lives but we know that you are the great Shepherd you knew us and you know us and you know the path that we all take and I pray father God that whatever that may be that you may be glorified in it Lord bless this service in a special way remember as I brother spoken early our brother Orville kabamba we just been constantly in our prayers and Lord we're still preaching and praying but we're praying Victory Lord we thank you Father God because your word said so in your name Jesus Christ bless this service and bless the hearers as well in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated in all of the battling that we go through and I know that we all go through difficulties but oftentimes we forget that our time being born in this day is not some kind of a mistake and God didn't throw out some kind of dice to see whether which lot we were going to fall in but everything that has uh it's is being done has already been pre-planned by God and many people don't believe in predestination but I do and I believe that the mind of God knew exactly where we would be how we would be thinking all of the battles that we would go through because every battle has been designed especially for you your battles uh have been patterned for you in order for you to reach Perfection this is why all of us have different battles we go through our different things but we have one goal and that is to reach that Mark that Paul talked about uh reaching for that Mark and and to understand we know that as the scripture says that you know you don't easily get into the kingdom of God you've got to press into it it's meaning that you have an opposition you have something that's going to keep you or try to keep you from getting there but one thing about the true Seed of Abraham they always make it right so Satan is one of the things that we must we're going to talk about because we hardly ever talk about him uh but I want to say something tonight that so that you can uh it could really uh impress your heart and I don't mean your head I mean your heart Satan is already defeated sometimes we work in a Christian realm like we're trying to defeat Satan what but Satan is already defeated and uh you know there is no giant there is no mountain there is no River there is no valley that can keep you from your goals your destiny is certain just as certain as your breathing breath right now we know that by God's grace that uh Jesus Christ when he conquered Satan uh he he he he became the victor of Heaven and Earth uh you know and uh Satan lost the battle you know even at Calvary because their God conquered Satan and he destroyed him death Hell In The Grave the Trinity of the devil and we realize amen those are the three things that Satan tried to hold over our head we don't think about death being sickness but sickness would be would be if there was no death right so we understand uh the grave wouldn't have any power uh if if it wasn't uh from the fall but we understand that everything Satan has uh designed for us or to destroy us uh God has already got it written in the word that he is the one that will be cast into the Lake of Fire in Shadow and tight we know by God's grace that even Iniesta that's why I love Esther so much because I see the whole pattern of of the of redemption there in Esther uh now for the Jews as well as the Gentiles because remember it was it was uh Esther who uh said unto her husband that she would like to see um Haman and all of his sons a basic option to say throw in the Lake of Fire but in reality amen they were destroyed at the end and and when we see these things we it gives us courage uh because sometimes the Satan tried to place a fear on us a fear of what there is no fear in God Amen the Bible said kept perfect love cast out fear right and there is only one perfect love and that's God himself Hallelujah now we must understand amen that God didn't barely conquer Satan he totally conquered him right amen that means everything that Satan in way of opposition can come at you he can never be uh Victorious amen uh when we think about God and I want to say it like this we think about the Old Testament Saints and how they had to suffer you know in the Lions then in the fire and all kinds of persecution they had to go through and still they became victors Hallelujah is that right because when Jesus Christ died he went into the low regions the Bible tell us and he preached to the souls that was in prison but when he got up he didn't get up by himself he was the first to get up but after he rose uh from the dead then all of those saints that died in a way that it looked like Jehovah was defeated that they were defeated but God proved to the devil amen that that his subject amen was Victorious and how come they were victorious because they were in him before the foundation of the world Hallelujah it had nothing to do with all of their failures because everybody was born of failure so it had nothing to do with their failures Hallelujah it was where what what it really was is where it is what what the position they were in before the foundation of the world y'all understand what I'm saying they were in Christ in every victory that Jesus Christ won we were there we won the Victory and that's why amen the Bible tells us that that we are to always rejoice and again he says rejoice amen so you you say well what do you mean because there's always something working in the Unseen things that we can't see Hallelujah but God has already fought the Battle and the Victory is already won Hallelujah I love the scene when Jesus died died and he was Rose from the grave and he began to sin up in heaven and and here he says the Lord Of Glory when they asked him who is the king of glory you know who is this knocking on heaven's Gates amen approaching Heaven's Gate and he said the Lord Of Glory Mighty and host Mighty hosts here they come in marching Jesus led captivity captive and here he comes with an Old Testament Saints and went in the new gates up there and said lift up ye Everlasting Gates and be lifted up and let the king of glory come in Hallelujah when he said the king of glory it almost sounded like it was just him but the king of glory had a host with him and all the hosts of The Old Saint Testament Saints amen marched into the gate uh of Heaven victoriously right hey and I love that scene because The Voice come from the inside and said who is this king of glory now I want you to listen because he said the Lord Mighty in battle didn't say you were and didn't say Samson was didn't say Jeremiah Was didn't say David was it said the Lord Mighty in battle is that right because it wasn't David who battled though David was there it was God in David Hallelujah hallelujah amen the gates flew open and Jesus a conqueror LED captivity captive them that had believed on him and the word had come to them there the Old Testament Saints laying in there waiting he led captivity captive ascended on high took the Old Testament Saints and went in there is one rapture and that's important for us to see because in this time we are in the darkest of all ages hallelujah amen you can look back and say oh but if I was in that day Hallelujah no I'm glad to be in this day because you and I have been designed to put the devil under our feet in this day Hallelujah right when I think about the victories that that that uh that was one in the Old Testament can you imagine the cries and and I I sometimes Envision when David took the head off of Goliath and and Israel saw the victory that David had just won by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and he took that head and he lifted it up can you imagine how the Earth roared and how it the the very vibration of Victory went throughout the whole Army of Israel so much so they all charged the enemy Hallelujah and can you see how it how it is now that's why there's no no uh how can I say it the prophet God says it like this he calls it the victory of vibration or the vibrational victories Hallelujah and those victories ought to be felt Hallelujah right now those you say what do you mean the battle is over no sir let me say how can I say it Lord you say the victory is already won that's true but the vibration of the victories are still moving Hallelujah is that right those vibration never stops hallelujah amen and we ought to be able to pick up on those vibrations glory to God Amen the Earth must have shook when when when when when when David amen uh when they won that battle and they began to chase can you imagine listen to that can you imagine thousands of feet Hallelujah stopping amen it's shook the vibration that was in them shook the Earth hallelujah oh God have mercy yes sir and when the earth vibrated you can imagine even the Rocks were rejoicing with God hallelujah see that we must understand that we we sometimes fight when we don't have to fight because the battle has already been won you understand me we don't have to fight listen every enemy has been defeated amen hallelujah but we must really believe that that every enemy has been defeated by whom Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah he came in this day is that right he visited us by even the way of a prophet but it doesn't stop there the vibrations must continue [Laughter] Hallelujah it will give you such a joy to recognize I am secure man that gay homie if I die it can't hold me but when God revealed to me that I'm Healed death sickness can't hold his place y'all understand me because the Bible said if we say with his stripes we're healed and we believe that Hallelujah but the man who said it like this he says it's like Joshua I give you the land it's yours but you gotta fight for it Hallelujah we don't fight physically but we fight without faith our faith is unmovable our faith stands still it doesn't matter what it looks like hallelujah we're not going by our sight we're going by the power of God hallelujah this is what I love about him because when you get the Holy Ghost it's no longer your faith it's not your mental your way of reasoning your way of processing Hallelujah turn it over to Jesus Hallelujah let him step in when you let him step in he then takes over Hallelujah there is a conqueror you talk about jerking off Avril aprons and waving it people say we are crazy because we shout and we run and we scream and we holler where are those people where are they Hallelujah they have never felt the Victor victorious vibrations of Heaven that's what he said they have never felt the Victorious vibrations of Heaven that that that the battle is over you don't know that amen when when they Israel saw David take off the head of Goliath they knew the battle was over Hallelujah that's right they uh they understood because there was none greater than Goliath at that time except God himself Hallelujah and Goliath represent the devil Goliath represent death Hallelujah Goliath represents sickness Goliath represent everything the devil could put out Hallelujah but guess what God conquered Goliath with a young boy Hallelujah and one word One Revelation he understood by God's grace that God was with him that is what the devil tries to do to us he tried to make us feel that God is not with us Hallelujah but we're not like Saul Hallelujah we are we have we are not appointed by people we haven't been appointed by men we have been appointed by God and when God's appoint you he's anoint you Hallelujah yes sir and you and I must understand that God has given us complete Victory oh you say well brother Brooks it don't look like it what are you looking at Hallelujah I'm looking at the word and the word brings promises to me and his promises are yay and not nay Hallelujah is that right God can get you out of whatever situation you're in Hallelujah but your faith must hold it must not waver Hallelujah no matter what Satan brings to you you got to believe what God says Hallelujah people say you're crazy about you because we shout and we run and we scream and we holler they have never felt the Victorious vibration of Heaven that the battle is over our Great Mighty conqueror has won every Victory he stands alone this morning untouched hallelujah amen no man no man no there is no other God he's the only true God right God gives us perfect Victory Hallelujah is that right and that's what we must see is already given let me let me what you got to fight for something if it's already given to you you don't fight the battle the the one who's fought for our victory has given us a victory is that right and Jesus Christ Alone stands as our trophy Hallelujah the word and I heard our brother say that tonight Lord let please come and have preeminence in it right this is what we want we want God to have preeminence Hallelujah complete preeminence we want him to rule our bodies our mind our souls our spirit everything about the whole being Lord have preemness this tonight Hallelujah that people might be able to see you and us Hallelujah the Bible said we are completing him I don't know whether I'll understand that or not but you understand we're completing me Hallelujah we you are complete in him what are you struggling with what are you struggling for if you are come he is complete right and you're completing him like I was telling somebody my life is here in Christ Jesus that's it Hallelujah you got to believe this you got to believe it if you're going to make a Rapture you can't think that you're going to be perfect you got to think that you are believe that you are it's not what you see it's what he's looking at Hallelujah he is the head is that right Oh Glory the Bible says listen Paul says if anybody knows anything if anybody knew anything it would have been Paul he said but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ this is the part I like therefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast unmovable I love that word unmovable you can almost put it this way Unstoppable always abounding in the work of the law that means going forward amen amen not standing still going forward Amen in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain where in the Lord as long as in it is in the Lord your laboring is not in vain Christ's Victory brought us the Holy Ghost y'all understand that that you know a lot of the the downplayed the Holy Ghost I don't like that because the Holy Ghost is God there is no other Holy Ghost there's only one spirit and that is the holy spirit right and that spirit that conquers and that's the spirit that conquered Satan in his own territory y'all understand that so let me say it like this if God if Jesus Christ was able to go down into the region of the Lost into hell and conquer him that what power he must have here Hallelujah conquer them right in his own territory and if he conquered him in hell he can conquer him on Earth Hallelujah that's right not only enough he conquers him in heaven yeah there's no way Satan can run he's conquered in heaven he's conquered on Earth y'all don't believe that oh yes when Daniel Prayed pray pray and he wondered what was going on but the angel said Daniel I heard you 21 days ago but there's a battle going on and we defeated the the Prince of Persia is that right see you what we don't understand is that our prayers are not just Earthbound but our prayers amen goes to heaven it moves Beyond this Dimension and the angels are in charge to make sure our prayers are heard or our prayers come to pass is that right oh my brother Randall said even if you would look in the spiritual realm and see those lights and the Darkness fighting each other Hallelujah yes sir you and I must understand because because the devil wants us to think we're just by ourselves and and and we pray and perhaps God will hear us and the Bible said God hears your prayers Hallelujah when you covered by the blood God knows your thoughts afar off Hallelujah on the day of Pentecost this is a quote he went down he sent down the Holy Ghost to what to continue through the Gentiles to take out a seed of promise to give to the Gentiles the Off cast to give to them the baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring them into the promise now we have a right to conquer all sickness amen Hallelujah that's what the Holy Ghost is for it's given to you to conquer all sickness we don't have to conquer it it's already conquered let me say that again we do not have to conquer it it's already conquered we just have to claim the promise and go take it hallelujah it's already conquered death is conquered hell is conquered sickness is conquered temptation is conquered when I heard that I say yes Lord hallelujah that means Temptation can be conquered by you in you if you have the faith amen that same thing that'll move Mountain moves Temptation y'all understand me temptation is conquered amen amen hallelujah oh devil all Devils amen is conquered hell is conquered death is conquered the grave is conquered Hallelujah we stand in the gate taking it don't have to fire a shot it's already been paid for Hallelujah you understand what I'm saying that's why he's at Shalom peace to the bride oh come on somebody all before we had the fight fight fight fight fight fight but when the angel when God himself come down y'all understand me when that lamb opened that book he came as a Victorious one he put his foot on the land and the Sea and he declared that time would be no more Hallelujah is that right that's the same thing that boy has said to Ruth you wait here you rest I'll battle for it I'll take it for it you just rest I'll conquer it for it when I come back I'm coming back for you you'll understand me at that point she did not have to worry ever again that's what we're dealing with we're dealing with the lamb taking the book telling the saints of God have faith in what I have already done Hallelujah is that right you don't have to do nothing but have faith take it that's what he said his enemies he will possess the Gate of his enemy how many thousands of millions he will possess the gates of his enemy every enemy he rose from the dead he possessed it because he gave it to us Hallelujah hallelujah it's all a what free gift besides all of that and everything that he has done and conquered every gate he conquers sickness took the gates only thing we have to do is walk up to the gate and say the name of Jesus Christ the Conqueror amen amen amen young all people of God this is not a mental thing I'm not trying to tell you to process it I'm trying to say believe it man speaking Hallelujah go with it with all of your heart and God will bring it to pass you got Pastor pattern to him Hallelujah when he comes to die and death said watch we make him take back his religion in the name of Jesus Christ have never rolled back Jordan the Seed of Abraham takes the gate while Paul said when they were fixing to cut his head off a Seed of Abraham he said death where is your sting grave where is your Victory thanks be to God who gives us a victory through Jesus Christ do you understand what giving means when somebody gives you something you didn't have to work one bit for it it was given to you let me say it like this if you believe your salvation was given to you you should believe that your healing and deliverance is true because that's all part of the package how can you believe that you you're saved and can't believe that you're healed amen it's all part of the atonement huh or delivered yeah yeah have y'all noticed all men all the whole congregation tonight her brethren and there's ten of us separated divided by two you get double Grace Hallelujah and you and I mean Lord knows I'm guilty but I've got to learn and I'm learning Hallelujah they cast all my cares upon Him Hallelujah in the Church of the Living God this morning lays the power to heal all sickness y'all believe that you do you believe the message this is God speaking to his bride I'm not talking about the prophet I'm talking about God in the man amen hallelujah in the Church of the Living God this morning lays the power to heal all sick he didn't say some he said all sickness in the Church of the Living God lays the power to overcome all temptation in the in the possession of the Church of the Living God this morning leads the power to change her change sin and throw it away and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the Church of Jesus Christ whatsoever you desire ask in my name and it shall be given to you a little while in the world the the the the world not the seed the unregenerated seed will see me no more yet you'll see me Hallelujah for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world watch the Royal Sea that the work that I do shall you do also I'll verify myself that I'm with you for these signs shall follow them that believe he said I will verify myself he puts that he shall possess the seed of his enemy he shall possess his his his seed shall possess the Gate of his Enemy No matter what the gate is if his sickness Temptation sin whatever the gate is it's conquered amen amen see we don't have an excuse now we don't have an excuse not even with temptation we don't have an excuse it's conquered and if it's conquered that means you can conquer it by faith let the Conqueror conquer it the Seed of Abraham possesses it aren't you happy this morning to know that we stand more than conquerors more than a conqueror oh there's nothing to fight about [Music] that's what he said there's nothing to fight about the fight is over here if the fight is over what do you do you relax in him have faith in God Hallelujah is that right listen if my brother would come up here and there's a fight that I need to a guy want to jump me and my brother said no no no you just sit still I fight for you what are they doing over there I'm going to be cheering the cheering my brother get him get him watch and then when he knocks him out I'm gonna cheer you understand me then what makes me more than a conqueror I didn't have to fight he fought for me Hallelujah you understand me the fight is over Hallelujah the whistle has blown the flag has Rose and in the midst of every sin pile every minute in every mist of every secret is The Old Rugged Cross planted by the blood of Jesus Christ a conqueror only thing we do is believe look and live Hallelujah I'll be with you I'll prove oh my people some in the last days and say oh well that's what that was but uh I'll be with you and and everything that I did here on Earth I'll be in you doing the same very same thing then they'll know they'll see me my people will see me the Seed of Abraham will see me they'll know me they'll recognize me and the others will call me beers above just like they have done but you shall know me for I'll be with you see you'll see me see with your eyes amen you see me for I'll be with you even to the end of the world the very same things I do he that believeth on me the work that I'll do shall he do also same kind of work amen hallelujah the Bible according to Matthew 5 48 it says be perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect I believe that and the only way that we can be perfect is have the perfect God in us like you've heard me say there's no such thing as a Holy Mountain except the god the holy God is on the mountain Hallelujah Romans 12 1-2 I'm not going to be long said I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service you say oh Lord I don't I've fallen again what I must do the very thing that you did the first time repent confess make right and it's already ready Captain already fixed it you understand me he fixed it before you did it oh he did you say well why did he let me let me do that why did he let Abraham lie and that lie continued right after Abraham Isaac lied after Isaac lied Jacob lied right God allowed it but he was perfecting them he was doing something with them he was doing just like you you think God don't see you yet he called you when he knew you was going to make all those mistakes but he's trying to get somebody somebody believed that the blood of Jesus Christ took care of it all elujah God the Bible said he died once and for all elujah you better hear what I'm saying because if you ever come down to the end of your road the devil is going to be there to try to take your crown Hallelujah but when you know that he can't take it because he didn't give it Hallelujah when you know that the blood of Jesus Christ has washed you when you know that you have been filled with the Holy Ghost and God has already Vindicated you you're laughing his face like like Paul did that's right oh death where is your stay oh grave where is your Victory you think let me tell you something I think about that all

no I do that's right there are times I don't feel it but Salvation is not feeling salvation is Faith Hallelujah glory to God Byron knew that we want that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God what is it to believe God amen Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him as righteousness Hallelujah is that right if God can take a 90 year old man and an 80 year old woman or a 100 year old man and transform him change him Hallelujah you understand me why they yet lived he changed him to young people if that's the same God we serving tonight Hallelujah God in this age has given new Hearts new livers new eyes New Blood right in this day that wasn't yesterday that's today limbs have grown back today amen that same God works today if you have faith and believe

hasn't he'll never change because it can't change Hallelujah he's not wavering you know right he's consistent Hallelujah Ephesians 4 15. Listen we're growing up to express all things this is what he's maturing us up into so we can express him the God of this day right not the age of also Luther or Wesley but he he wants to express himself in this age we call the bride age let's speak the truth in love May grow up into him in all things you understand me what he's saying here amen which is the head so God wants us to grow up in all things everything about him everything that that is pertaining to God he wants to see it manifest through us amen hallelujah first Peter 5 10-11 but the God of all Grace who have called us unto his eternal glory by Jesus Christ after ye have suffered a while you you can't make this journey without suffering forget it if you think it's going to be so easy no you and I have chosen the harder way and let me tell you something that's I can remember when when I use myself for an example when that enemy came to me and says oh you got cancer all in you it's called you know more than likely in your bone and everything else whose report are you going to believe what was that that was the kingdom of God now we're getting ready to suffer violence now his report in my report going to battle huh the word is going to battle science and the word always defeats science hallelujah it's not listen you know we said well Lord ha let me tell you what God has a purpose and I believe that when God has a purpose nobody can stop it not me nor you Hallelujah and I'm gonna tell you something I believe What God Says if I pray for somebody and God should take them I still believe just like I would if he would raise him up Hallelujah that's right it does not diminish the word it doesn't diminish the promise God says so amen amen I don't care what people think it ain't your mind it ain't your thoughts it's what God thinks about it and I'm going to trust and believe till I see differently amen amen amen and then when it's all over Victory is still victory Hallelujah but the God of all Grace who have called us into his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthens settles you let me tell you something the Bible said the suffering of this world cannot be compared amen and I don't know why we think because we suffer God don't love us most of the time God is loving on you man huh yes yes you think God said look at job I'm gonna make him suffer that's not the purpose the purpose was devil look at job a man of integrity that's right he's perfect Joe you can't move him y'all hear me and a True born-again Believer cannot be moved no matter what they go through they know that God is in the mix they may not understand it and God don't have to explain it but it's yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord yes Hallelujah whatever your will is yes Lord whatever you want to do with me yes Lord hallelujah whatever your purpose is for me yes Lord Hallelujah to him be glory Hallelujah and listen people let me tell you what like like I see it even when it comes to the three who Hebrew boys brother Branham said they had a prayer meeting and God didn't even answer but they had such a so much God in them they said even if he don't deliver us I will not bow to you Hallelujah that's what I'm talking about even if he don't deliver I will not bow to you Satan my God is God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God my God is God amen hallelujah thank you Jesus to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen hallelujah you love the Lord I'm not going to be long healing is is your possession see God gave me this for me amen amen y'all might be you know y'all might not understand what's happening with here but yesterday I was even was it yesterday I was saying how much pain I had on the inside and I didn't even know how to release it and her sister sent me a little text uh voice text from this message and it just set my soul if I Set Me Free you know because you know it just I can't explain it it just was sitting there and I couldn't move it and it was looked like it was overwhelming me and I'm trying to move forward and trying to be happy and and all of this pain spiritual pain is what I'm not physical spiritual pain inside of me and God delivered yes sir and I thought man this too good not to share it huh the Holy Ghost is your possession let me tell y'all something there's nothing I own or nothing I do I wouldn't give up for Jesus and and the devil knows it he knows it the Holy Ghost is your possession there's great thousands of preachers and so forth in the land today that says that's not so did y'all hear what he said the Holy Ghost is your possession amen Amen in other words possess Me Lord they wait right in and possess the gates of the enemy God said they would they believe it because it's a promise his she shall possess the gates of the enemy is that right the Bible said Abraham staggered not at the promise did Abraham go through tests yes even with his own wife he went through it Hallelujah but he never staggered at the promises of God Hallelujah God is still more than able Hallelujah and he says Abraham seed is seed and material amen glory to God they believe it because it's a promise his seed ship is possess the gates of the enemies now you'll go through testing you'll go through trials and Joshua stood there loyal that's what he's looking for the little fellow said I don't care how big they are I don't care what kind of Spears they got I how high their city is is Walled and how great it is our promise is that the gate will be possessed by the seed of the God God's children and we're going over to take them we're more than a match for them oh that's the true seed yes is that right I don't care what anybody said listen if you can't whip him here how you gonna whip him anywhere else listen those saints of God of the Old Testament they died in faith and because they died in faith they were able to rise amen amen hallelujah and the word of God said even when it came to the New Testament there were some of them who didn't want to be delivered right but if you want to be delivered God will deliver you you don't have to work at it you just stand still and see the salvation of the Lord Joshua stood there loyal a little fellow said I don't care how big they are I don't care what kind of Spears they got how high their city is Walled how great it is how our promise is that the gate will possess but y'all we we read these things and we have no idea we didn't we you you've never seen a giant you've never seen a giant can y'all are y'all so sleepy y'all can't say Amen you've never seen a giant and this city had big folks with big grapes and you know fear tactic had already come Satan had already set up ten spies to say it's too much for us to take care of you know that's how the devil is the devil will come through a doctor or somebody else oh it can't be done Hallelujah remember that that little nurse said oh well why are you exciting these people be like this before we've never seen this machine go down so low and somebody come back up that old man who had heard the prophet pray said my daughter you you go about all that you know but I'm going by promise y'all understand me Hallelujah and healing came in the room it doesn't matter why is it safe and if God has anointed you to believe how fast amen amen hallelujah Satan cannot defeat faith Hallelujah glory to God you understand me oh that's the truth see lots of them that was was born natural she said we just can't do it there's no need to try it see we are outnumbered we are outclassed and everything no matter he wouldn't see they looked at that what the eyes saw and Joshua was looking what God Said hmm and the Seed of Abraham doesn't look to any of the natural things they look to what the Lord said that's the promise What If Abraham would have looked to that natural at a woman 100 years old 90 she was and he was a hundred and had lived with her since she was a little girl and he was a little boy and no seed he didn't look at those things he said he counted those things as if they were not that's the way you got to do I don't care what it looks like it's all lion bandages that's what that's what Jonah said Jonah was in the bed a little way all lying Valley vanities huh is that right think about your look what you look what you go through every day that looked like your failure the way Satan sets you up Hallelujah you know if anybody could see just like my wife and somebody else was we were talking I was talking to somebody I said man if you would see what goes on in this I think it was maybe it was rich I don't know who it was but we were talking about how if people could hear and what we think if we all get out through in our minds I wonder how many people would like you but the point is that God sees all of that he knows all of that and he loves you anyway yes that was Brother Rich he loves you anyway can I say it like this even conquered your thoughts amen I'm almost done the Perfection of God is given to the believer by the blood of Jesus Christ just the other day when I was preaching Sunday I think I said you are you are becoming everybody's becoming something that's true you're maturing into something you either maturing into the image of God are you maturing into the image of the devil there's no in between and you got to know you know every man that has the life of God in them knows they've got the life of God even though you can't explain it and if the life of God is in you the Bible said he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it it ain't your working end it's him working it through you right listen Hebrews 9 10 9-14 says then said he lo I come to to that to do thy will o God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest standard daily ministering and offering offering often time the same sacrifice we can't which can never take away sin but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever set down on the right hand of God amen y'all understand me all your sins everything that you could possibly dream of doing wrong was taken care of at Calvary from his fault expecting to the enemy to understand where we are we're the last Church age and in this church age we will put the enemy and make him our footstool the footstool is it's it's it's something that you could use in your advantage if you can't reach something you could step on that footstool and get it Hallelujah it ain't there just to be relaxing your feet but you can use it as a ladder right you can use it as a stepping stone Hallelujah for his fourth expecting till the enemy be made his first two for by one offering he had perfected forever them that are sanctified one offering Hallelujah this is my last scripture Hebrews 12 22-25 what I'm trying to say is complete brothers and sisters you know stop your worrying stop your fretting you know it's all in his control Hallelujah you know it's if you if you study you know the prayer a life of William Branham and when God used him in discernment you'll find out that there was nothing hidden in the services and some things sometimes God went all the way back to somebody's childhood y'all hear me there was nothing hidden and I guess if God wanted to expose all of somebody every bit of somebody's life he could have done it right think about all of those people and he would tell these people these things and this happened to you when you was a little girl and this is what happened to you when you and I you know what I mean and you said well what how in the world it because it wasn't a man but those things were said to Enlighten us that every move we make he knows about it before we make the move and you know it doesn't and some of us may have thought oh my god I've done such ugly sins but don't you understand God knows and let me say it like this there's always somebody worse always but the thing that I love about this is that you come to recognize I'm no different from anybody else it's just that the grace of God is with me Hallelujah but yeah come to Mount Zion unto the city of the Living God the Heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly in the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all thank you Jesus and to the spirits of just men made perfect you know what the word made means when you're not in control he making you he made you you perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Testament Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel seeing that you refuse not him that speak it for if they escape not who refused him that speaketh on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that's speaketh from heaven y'all understand that this message didn't come from Earth this message came from heaven and those who refused him that spoke on earth like Moses and and and and it was was destroyed what about us now don't refuse him that speaketh from Heaven because that Jesus Christ himself the devil is defeated the lamb the blood of lamb triumph over Heaven Satan stands as a as a trophy to the believer the defeat of him rather you love the Lord amen I will close with this uh let me finish it's just a short period it's just a short thing if you got an enemy this morning then my brother there's only if you are a Seed of Abraham after hearing this there's not enough devils in hell can keep that gate before you it it it it will open I don't care what it is you walk up there as a promise seed and say I claim this for mine this is mine because God swore that he'd raise up Jesus and threw Jesus out conquer it I come in the name of that conqueror Jesus Christ step back I'm passing through amen he should possess the gates of the enemy then stand up there with your shoulders back in your Shield a shining covered by the blood of the Lord Jesus the enemy will recognize our Christian friend put on the whole arm of God don't stand back with some little idea of some Creed or something that you're standing by put on the whole arm of God when you go to fight against the enemy like our Lord did he showed that how he how the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan just with the word he had power he could have smoked Satan anyway he wanted to but he didn't use it he just took the word and defeated him with it it is written it is written everywhere it is written so he defeated Satan by the word of God but God at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he's infinite God now seeing there was going to be a conflict and there was going to be a battle God equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition right kind of a of an attack the right kind of everything that they had need of that would sweep them all the way from Eden to the Rapture what is it the word the word that's what defeats Satan is the word it'll defeat him anywhere anyplace now why do you want to substitute something else when we have already got the best thing that there is the word Hallelujah my last one that's what Jesus defeated Satan he never used his power he was God manifested in flesh but he didn't use his power all the gifts that there was in heaven he had them in him but he didn't use that he just took the father's word he said it's written thou shall Worship the Lord thy God it is written it is written it is written it is written and he defeated Satan and the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere on any ground under any conditions God's holy word Hallelujah glory to God that is nothing but the truth and when you and I see that and really understand that it takes away the worry right amen you go through your suffering you go through things we all will do we'll have to but at the end of the day God is a revelation amen and God will reveal to you I don't think David thought oh my God what if he doesn't come on the scene David had confidence that The God Who slew the bear the goddess flew the lion which slay also Goliath amen right each each test got more difficult but when David slew Goliath he was king forever you understand me so you and I must understand we all have to have our battles and each one will escalate get higher and harder but God has given us victory over every one of them and right now we're all going through something I don't know what you're going through but I'm telling you the battle has been fought and the victory has already been won if we could only receive that leave our reasoning alone the way we process things in our minds you know it it comes to defeat us because we try to figure it out you can't figure it out it's what God does you know it's it's you know who I I still wonder I I I I often wonder you know how Jonah when we get to heaven what his testimony is going to be because as far as I know of the way I am I would have died in the belly of a way unless God would have shown me something just by the fact that he swallowed me would have left me in a mental state that's the truth I'm talking carnal but it's true but this man came out fighting you know no matter what it looked like he he knew he had a work to do because God told him you got to go preach to Nineveh so he understood he could not die right when you understand that you cannot die because God has a work for you to do Satan Can't Stop Hallelujah Satan can't stop you you love the Lord Hallelujah let's stand Fire won't burn you flood can't drown you nothing can stop you when you know you have your work has not been completed amen amen what you singing amen for me I took
