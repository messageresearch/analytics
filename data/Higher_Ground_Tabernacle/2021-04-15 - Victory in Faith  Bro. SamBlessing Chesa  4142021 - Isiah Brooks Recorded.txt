every one of y'all who made it to church tonight amen it's always good to come to church because we know god always comes to meet us he's a god who never misses an appointment hallelujah um let's read hebrews chapter 11 verse one and eight one through eight now faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had his testimony that he pleased god for without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must come must believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him let us bow our heads is whilst we're standing dear father we approach the tone of grace and mercy this evening oh father knowing at this time oh father god of the night in the cold of the evening that's when he used to come down in fellowship with adam and eve that was before the fall oh father but thank you for the cross lord jesus christ you came to restore back the fellowship that man had with you oh lord here we are tonight in the cool of the evening father we are waiting to hear from you lord we're in anticipation oh father the people with different needs all got different questions oh lord i just pray oh god that may you be over jared lord and provide all our needs oh jesus christ you said in your word you were jehovah rapha you healed all our diseases whether you'd be physical or spiritual lord you heal at all of that all father i just pray oh god that you grant unto everyone according to their desires lord now that we have read your word oh father the few minutes that we have to speak about your word oh lord i pray that you come and give action unto these words of father god may you please come and anoint your word lord come and anoint the word that's in your bible because only you can give life to it i pray in jesus christ's name believing amen let me take your seats so for some time tonight we want to speak on this subject victory in faith when brother troy asked me to to speak i was just waiting on god to see which inspiration he was leading me and um he led me to this subject so i believe is going to help a few people amen so we're speaking on victory in faith so in the bible that we in the verse that we read in um hebrews chapter 11 it says paul says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so faith is not something that's imaginary but it's something that it's a substance substance is something that's tangible of the the evidence of the things not seen so the things that you are hoping for the thing that you are believing that you are going to have faith is a tangible part of it and in the last verse in verse 6 it says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is so without faith you cannot please god the prophet of god tells us that in the soul of you in the soul of a human there are only two things that can stay within there that is either doubt or faith and if you have doubt then you are not being led of of god but if you have faith then you have that space for god to come and dwell in because faith is of god and if you have doubt you don't have god in your life you have darkness but for you to please god you have to have that faith inside of your life many times we don't understand faith it seems the way we read and it seems like something that's abstract something that don't exist or something that's imaginary but faith like the bible just just told us it is a substance it is tangible you coming to church that was faith getting into your car that was faith because you had faith in your car that your car was going to take you here each and every one of you when you sat on your chair you didn't check to see if it was gonna if it was gonna buckle under you why because you had faith in that chair so faith is that simple we see it in our every day-to-day lives but many times when we want to use it for what we are believing on the devil will make it seem as if it's something imaginary and something that's unachievable the prophet of god said in her faith in god he says faith why is the most common thing there is you can't even get a drink of water without faith you couldn't come to this meeting without faith you cannot move your finger without faith so whatever you do you have to believe in it for you to achieve it you would have already have faith and then in romans chapter 10 verse 17 paul tells us that so then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god so every time we listen to the word of god every time we read in the bible that's how we get our faith that's how faith comes in into your heart and the devil knows that the more you listen to the word of god the more you read the word of god you're going to have faith and faith is a weapon that god gave us so we can overcome the devil so the devil has put destructions in front of us so that we don't have enough time to listen to the word we don't have enough time to read the word we don't have time for bible study we don't have time for devotions why it is the devil that's bringing it in front of us so he distracts us because he wants to keep that faith that you have so little because he knows the moment you have faith it is trouble for his kingdom so we got to be cognizant of that and know that every time the devil is trying to distract us but when the moment you realize that that's the devil's technique the prophet of god says you would have already overcome and then you go on every day you read your bible you pray every day the prophet of god was as somebody said how do i make it into the rapture he said read your bible and pray every day not every other day but each and every day so every time when you listen to that word because in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god so we have god in written form we are we have god right at our fingertips the more we are reading the bible we are hearing what god is saying to us we are getting god into us because you are supposed to get god within you that's what jesus wants for us you and me when you get the holy ghost to have jesus christ to come and dwell within you and me so you have to stand firm on that word the word that you have read what you would have heard what you have read you have to stand firm on it because the devil brings reasoning that's how he first fell at the first god gave them the word but the devil came and he reasoned the word out of them and that's how they become they became um they came to fall but the prophet of god tells us that he says that's the death struck to satan when a man takes god at his word brother that will kill satan every time not some other time but every time when a man takes guarded his word that will kill satan every time so the devil knows that the more you read the more you listen to the word that's a potential deathstroke to him so that's why you and me we all have to be focused to make sure that we are focused on god and listen to each and every word that he says we should do when a man takes god at his word that's a death stroke amen yes sir and now faith is so simple you don't have to crank for you to go get faith because faith it is already given when we read in the bible um ii peter chapter one if we if you can open up bibles to second peter chapter one verse five verse 5 reads and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue add to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ when we go back to verse five it says add to your faith virtue so all the if you look at the stature of a perfect man according to what peter wrote here he is saying add virtue to faith to virtue and knowledge so that faith is already there is the basis of the stature of a perfect man so you don't have to crank about it the moment you are converted the more you receive christ as your personal savior god gives you faith as a gift the prophet of god tells us that faith is a gift from god so you don't have to worry to say where am i gonna get faith i don't have faith the moment you just accept christ as your personal savior god already places faith in your heart that's how we get to start building up the stature of a perfect man because without faith there is no foundation faith is the foundation for us to come into the perfect image of christ because we know the stage of a perfect man is the stature of jesus christ and that's what each and every believer is yearning to be to end up in a place where when jesus looks in us he sees himself when jesus looks at you he sees a mirror image of himself a perfect reflection because we would have gotten into the stage of a perfect man but we cannot get there without faith and faith is already given to you improving israel the prophet of god said you can only have faith as god gives you faith you cannot fake it god has to give you that faith however religious you may be yet it must take you must have faith and your faith can only rest if you're a christian upon the proven word of god so faith rests on the proven word of god that basis when you take it is going to be a death stroke why because your faith is resting on it on the firm foundation that never fails because we know the word of god never fails god is not a man that he should lie or a son of man that he should repent but we know that his word never fails so faith it is a gift from god the moment you are saved god has already given you the faith and when you accept christ into your heart into your soul you have that you have that open space already for faith to come and live in because we know that it can only be either faith or doubt that very small space that's created in the in the heart of a human being so we need faith for us to become overcomers and in some place brother branham says faith is a revelation god has to reveal that faith with you to you amen at one place he was explaining faith he says patience and so forth there is a mockery of it a pretending to be in nature given faith and nature given virtue there's a nature given temperance all these things are nature given and the biggest part of our faith is mental faith by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of god so that faith we were talking about earlier on that made you sit where you are without looking at the chair that made you get into your car and come here that faith that mental faith by when you hear the word it brings you to a mental recognition of god and he says but if this coming from above brother if it ever strikes this there is a godly spiritual faith when what does this faith do the faith recognizes only the word no matter what anything else says it only recognizes the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word is still god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation so the faith that you already have when you when the word itself pours into your faith then that mental faith that you have it becomes a spiritual revelation it becomes the spiritual faith of the prophet who god was talking about because without faith it is impossible to please god and when we have faith we know all things are possible we know the the the principal theme of the met of the ministry of brother branham it was only believe all things are possible believing is an atmosphere with where faith can operate and believing in an ad is an atmosphere where faith is going to produce those results so what we all need to do is only believe all things are possible when you believe nothing can stand before you when you believe you can be healed when you believe all demons can be cast out away from your way when you believe you'll be able to have victory amen when you have faith all the impossibles they are changed to being possibilities faith is not in i think so matter it's not enough i think so but it's and i know so i think so that's hope we are not required to have hope but we have to get faith knowing that whatever i say it is going to happen faith in god's word that each and every word that god says is yea and amen everything that god says is gonna come to pass it is and i know so and we have absolute confidence in what god had amen so it changes all the impossibilities two possibilities we know joshua and caleb when they went with the other ten spies they were not looking at what their side was saying in first corinthians tells us that we live by faith and not by sight so we do not look at what our eyes say when you when in school you learn that our eyes give us what we call optical illusion there is an illusion that your eyes give you and satan maximizes on that but we know we don't live by that faith we live by we don't live by that sight we live by faith so when joshua and caleb and them when they went to to spy the land they saw giants but they were not looking at what their eyes were saying their eyes were giving them an optical illusion according to the word of god because the word of god said you are supposed to go and overcome and take that land that's your land so the other 10 spies they were not looking at faith they were focusing on what their side was telling them they were focusing on what their eyes were seeing and the moment you do that you are already defeated but when you look to faith knowing that whatever god said i believe it i don't care what my eyes see i don't care what the symptoms may be i know it's going to come to pass why because god said it and i'm resting on god's faith and not my eyesight if god said so i know it will happen it doesn't matter how many years it will it takes for it to come to pass but i know it is going to happen why is it because god said so at an appointed time god will make sure that will happen because god is willing to bankrupt heaven to make sure his word comes to pass so don't be afraid to take god at his word just have that faith in what god says and apply that word in whatever situation you have in whatever aspect in life you have the bible has everything apply that faith god is able to come through and he will help you out isaiah isaiah said when god speaks the word it cannot go back to him void but only after it accomplishes that which he has sent it for so when god speaks it has to happen it can never fail so all the all the verses from genesis 1 to revelation 22 all the word that god put in here it is valid everything that god put here is his word so when god speaks when you open and look at that bible and what god says know that it will never go back to him void but it will go back to him after it accomplishes that what he sent it for abraham knew that god had told him he was going to have a son so he knew that that word was not going to go back to god after until he had had a son so that's why he had that patience and he had that faith to wait for 25 years in hebrews chapter 11 tells us that he's tagged not on the promises of god why because he knew that god this word would never go back to him void but after he does what he sent it for so he was resting upon god's word to say god say god said i will have a son so i will have a son i don't care i don't care when it's going to happen how it's going to happen but i know it will happen hallelujah so when god says something in his word just go ahead take it god will go god will come through for you when in his word he says that you are healed don't look at the circumstances don't look at the symptoms you say god said it i believe it and it is going to happen because he said in his word i was healed two thousand years ago when he said it all you have to do is step in and claim it that's all you have to do it's already there for you to take because god's word never failed when he says it is finished two thousand years ago when he was hanging on the cross when he said it is finished that's when everything was finished so you don't be afraid to take god at his word so you just go and you say satan i don't care whatever you're putting in my way i know it was already finished so whatever i'm seeing right now doesn't determine the outcome what determines the outcome is what god said revelation 8 11 tells us that the bride has a ministry of what prophesying again and we know the bible is a book of prophecy all we have to do is prophesy again again means you are repeating what has already been said so whenever you are in a situation you take that and you say the bible say i am an overcomer you are prophesying that's what faith takes you go go on ahead and know god will never fail if god say lay hands on the sick they shall recover i'm not afraid to do that you should not be afraid to do that why because god never fails i'm not worried about the outcome why because i'm not the one who's responsible for the action when god says in his word lay hands on the sick and they shall recover i will go and i will do what his words say go lay hands on the sick they shall recover it is not up to me to make that person recover it is up to god so that's why i can go ahead i know i have absolute faith in god he has never failed and he is not failing and he shall never fail amen so whenever you see what god said you go ahead you are not responsible for it god himself is responsible to make sure that his word comes to pass do not be scared to take god at his word hallelujah he gave the disciples the commission he said go preach the gospel to the uttermost parts of the world they were not afraid to do it because they knew that he was with them he was in them he was the one who was doing those wonders he was the one doing those miracles when peter and them said um when that uh beggar was asking for money he says we don't have silver or gold but such as we would give it to you what was he talking about he knew that jesus was already in him so he was just giving he was giving jesus out that's what he had he was not scared he was not worried how is that man how is his legs going to straighten up that was not up to him because he knew that god's word never fails god is responsible he takes full responsibility of his word he will never let his word be shamed he will stand for it amen so you just take god at his word and you know he can do it he will never fail noah said it's going to rain scientists they came and they proved it to him they said it has never rained he says i don't know i don't care how it is going to happen but why because i know god said it so he went on around and preached for 120 years saying rain is going to come it is going to rain he had no he had no scientific explanation to that but he knew that was going to happen he was not scared to do it because he knew he was not responsible for it he knew god was responsible for forming the rain clouds and making it rain he was not worried he was just speaking the word what god had told him he knew god never fails you know god's word never fails but it always come to pass so he preached for all those 120 years and it reigned because god when in due time god's word he will make it come to pass so when god said it will happen i'm not worried about how it's going to happen god will make you god will prepare a way for his word to happen to you look at abraham and sarah they were old people they were now old scientifically their bodies could not were not able to bear children but they didn't care about that they were holding on to the word god was responsible for rejuvenating them for rejuvenating their bodies to make them younger so that his promises could be fulfilled in their lives so when you look at god's promises in your life it doesn't matter what your situation is looking like it doesn't matter how much doubt is trying to come within you don't care about that because god himself he will make way for that promise to happen to you because he will make sure his word never fails god is god changes every impossibility to possible amen we all know of the song that says god any reavers you think are uncrossable any mountains you think you cannot tunnel through but we know we serve a god that specializes in things that men call impossible our god calls those possible if we only have faith in him that's how we get our victory when we are relying on god because he never fails us amen so we got to change our vocabularies christians from impossible to it's possible not i think so but i know so i know god will do it you cannot be shaken because you know that the revelation that god has given you that is faith it cannot be shaken god can do nothing nothing can move it because god is behind it and he is the one who has given it to you and sometimes the prophet will say i'm speaking according to the revelation of my faith because he knew what he was standing on amen many times faith is contagious that's why we are supposed to share our testimonies when you hear somebody when you have a testimony that happened to you god done something for you in your life don't be afraid to share it because god helped you god came to your health so that you can share that testimony and spike the faith that's in your brother that's in your sister so you have to do it in this quote the prophet of god says now um if mr john doe out here had cancer and was healed so you can have it and be healed faith comes by hearing is that right and he says that's the way congress uh congressman absol who preached um i believe from this puppet here when he read of florence nightingale and her trouble he had heard of this shoemaker down here who had been paralyzed laying in his chair for about 10 years wheeling him up and down the floor to give or to do his work his office at the baptist and then when a vision appeared over him and saying he was bound in that wheelchair for those years with his back broken and down in that place and his prince in his back until he he couldn't even move and the man was made perfect whoa congressman absolute said if that can happen to him it can happen to me too god what he did for you he can do the same for me too what he did for me he can do the same thing for you as well so when god heals you that's not your own testimony go give it to the bride of christ somebody else is waiting on that testimony somebody else you might not know is suffering from the similar problem so when you say the testimony god is going to use it to heal somebody else and it will go on right on ahead until all the children of god have been delivered until the children of god have been saved so don't be scared don't be ashamed don't be shy to share your testimony god is using your testimony he is waiting on you to help somebody else god wants you to use your experience how you receive the holy ghost somebody else is probably in a similar situation probably you you were stuck and you were bound by this addiction maybe you were bound by demons of whatever sorry it was and god delivered you you never know there is probably someone somewhere who is going through the same thing that when you share their testimony is going to be evidence to them that if god did it for them he can do it for me as well so go share the testimony give it to the people somebody else will be helped by that amen and make sure that when you give it you testify of the goodness of the lord because it is not for our own glory it is not proving how good we are but we know it is telling and testifying of how good our god is each and every testimony is for us to give glory back to god because he's the one who deserves all the glory and he's the only one who is supposed to get it and not anyone else amen so faith we are supposed to have faith because faith the prophet of god sees it is muscular he says in this uh quote he says genuine faith doesn't take no for an answer it's got hairs on the chest it's big and burly it speaks and everything else says down that's all you know if those feelings raise up and say you don't feel any different you just say shut up faith will say shut up sit down and god will take over why because faith is that sixth cent that will put to submission all the other five it doesn't matter what your eyes are saying it doesn't matter what your your feelings are saying they might say we are we are still feeling sick we are still feeling painful but faith is saying no the word of god does not say that the word of god says you are healed so your five senses have to be set under subjection to what faith is saying your face says shut up don't even feel it that's it just look at what god says god say so so faith believes it you can just hold on to faith and just let faith take over it makes the rest of them look look like little to us it makes them sit down because he is the boss god he's got great big brownie muscles and i tell you everything else all feelings and superstitions and little isms and things will just sit down when faith takes over faith will sub faith will put fear into some submission faith will make sure that you have victories because you are resting on the word of god and you have faith you have the i know so that god will do it so we are just supposed to have faith in god because that's how our victories come it is that sick sense that people think that we are crazy it makes us it makes you extraordinary because it is out of the ordinary um i shared this story one uh some time ago when i was when i was younger i should have been um in middle school i think i was 12 years old then i heard my dad preaching in church he said oh faith is a sixth sense two days afterwards i had a quiz in in class and the quiz was saying how many senses does a person have and i sat there then i took out my pen and i wrote six senses and right there when i was seated i knew everyone else was writing five senses and i was so proud that i was the only one who knew that i have six we have six senses amen then after i submitted my paper and it got graded and uh of course i got it wrong then i went back i was so mad i went back to my dad i said you were preaching that we have six senses but this is what i wrote and the teacher he graded the teacher she graded it wrong that's when he explained to me that we are different people they have five senses but we we have six senses when you have the holy ghost within your life it is different the world will make mockery of us because it sounds so absurd amen that faith will make us receive whatever we want the bible in um i believe it is in john it says ask whatsoever you will and this shall be given unto you because you already have faith in you know god is going to grant it to you and we don't receive because we ask not we are scared to bother god but if your motive is right go on ahead go ask god god is more than willing to give you your request he is ready to make the heavens bankrupt just to make sure his word has come to pass to make sure his word has been fulfilled and the prophet of god says you can never exhaust god's love and mercy to you you say well i hate to bother you so much father he wants to be bothered that way he does don't ever think that you would ever ask too much of god i believe the scripture said you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not he wants us to ask and believe that our joys would be full he wants you to ask abundantly he is our heavenly father he is an affection for you and me he loves us so he wants you to ask whatever you want and he is willing to give it to you because he is our heavenly father amen and he says ask for big things don't limit your faith to some little master seed get on out here to some other kind of faith move out in big things big things is just as easy to receive as little things you just have to believe that's all and you got faith just know exactly how to use it and it will be all right you can put it right to work and it'll be just fine could you imagine talking about exhausting god's love and power and beneficiaries for you could you imagine a little bit of fish about that about that lung probably way out in the middle of the ocean and he says now wait a minute i better consider this thing i better drink of this water sparingly because i might run out someday imagine that just a little fish this big it's in a whole ocean it says i have to save this water because it might finish that's how you are taking god when you are scared to ask that's how you were seeing him you you saying you are this little pretty much and all his promises are that big all you just have to do is ask you can never ask enough just ask and god is willing to give you because he wants your joys to be full and he says um well that could easily be done more easy than you could ask too much of god he is the inexhaustible fountain of life whatever you need of him ask ask him and you believe it he provided it in the redemptive blessings when he died at the calvary and gave a promise to you for everything you have need of while you're in the journey and it's yours if you will ask and believe it all you have to do is only believe that's right you will receive what you're asking for you could imagine a little mouse about this long under the great goddess of egypt saying now wait a minute i better not eat just about two grains a day because i might run out before the winter is over it is just the same thing when uh when joseph when joseph had to store all those grain imagine a little mouse saying i have to eat only two twice a day because i'll finish it that's impossible when you go to god don't ask for a little bit and say no i just have to ask for just for this only because maybe that might be too much no sir you go ahead ask god what your heart desires and just make sure that you are asking him according to his will and you are asking god for the right objectives and you have the right motive because uh in james 4 says you ask and receive not because you ask amiss that you might consume it upon your lust when you're saying ask big and ask god so many things that you want you just don't go and start blabbering and say i want this i want this and i want that but because you have the holy ghost you have that sense sensitivity you're saying lord what do i need in my life and god will inspire you what to pray for god will inspire you to let you know what you need for this journey because he's the one who knows so whenever you are asking make sure that you are not asking amiss just to to to consume it upon your last like the bible says and many times the reason why we do not receive it's either god is strong is trying our patience like abraham he did not just give him just like that but he was working his virtue of patience and he was working it out if god is not trying your patience and building it up maybe you are asking i miss maybe you're asking for you to to to satisfy your lust so we have to be connected to god to know the right thing that we're asking for we have to be connected to know what we need at that particular time amen many times maybe people are asking for blessings so that they prove their haters to be wrong saying i need this big car so that i show off the soul and so that oh now i made it in life that's your motive your motive is for you not to serve god so god is not going to give you because he knows your motive is wrong you you are asking amidst and you will not receive it but if you ask according to him and say lord if you need a genuine blessing god is able to do it i'm not saying god doesn't give you won't give you a car if you need it and your motive is right he will give it to you if you need a house and your motive is right god will give it to you if you need a job and your motive is right god is able to give it to you because you said ask and i will give it to you so that your joys might be full some people maybe one the reason they don't receive is because they're asking so that they compare with with the johns or or somebody else with their friends or prove that i'm better now that set is just satisfying your lust and god does not want that and he might not give that to you because so every time you have to make sure you have that connection with god and you're constantly in prayer and sensitive for god to let you know what you need at that point in time and when you pray knowing that you have that connection you know for sure that his word is not going to fail you know that god is going to give it to you god knows his children well he knows that if i give so and so that thing he knows that this person is not going to serve me no more if if you have a child who's probably five years old and they say i want i want a car even if you can afford it you're not gonna buy it to them because you know they don't need it then they are asking amiss but if they ask for a toy that's that's at their own level you will give it to them because that is necessary that's what they need at that point in time so it's the same thing with god sometimes we ask things that god knows that the moment they give you that blessing that blessing is not going to be a blessing but it is going to stop you from serving god or is going to push you further away from god and god does not regret so he's he's going to make sure you not have it until you get to the point where you can receive it so we are supposed to ask god in abundance and we are supposed to make sure we are asking the right thing we are not asking amiss it's just like elijah elisha he was elisha was under the ministry of elijah he enjoyed the way god was working with elijah and when elijah was about to depart elijah said ask whatever you want and i'll give it to you elisha was not scared he said he did not say oh you are a great man could i just be used by god just a quarter of the way god used you no he was not scared he went all in he says i want a double portion of your spirit i want that spirit to be on me why because he was not scared he was asking for a big thing that's what we got to do and we also know we are the bride of jesus christ we have the elijah anointing the our elijah he has gone on forth to be he has gone on for to be with the lord and we are here we are supposed to ask for that double portion to be working in our midst all the miracles that brother branham did they were just not there just to be written in books but the way as an example that you and me we can do it jesus said greater works than this shall you do not in not in um in quality but it was in quantity because we are a many member bride so we have to ask for more we are the spiritual elisha we say lord we want that double portion we want to do more the way you work in your servant may you work like that in us and god is able to do it because he wants to give us big things he is willing to let us ask and the greatest thing you could ever ask god of is the holy ghost at one point the prophet of god says god is more than willing to give the holy ghost more than you want it so you just know god is already there with his arms out all you just have to go and say lord i'm ready it just takes that desperation to get to the point where you say i need it and when you ask for it god is more than willing to give it to you and when you get the holy ghost within you the prophet of god said we become omnipotent i'mma read this quote he says he says now man i was going to choke it but i'm going to say it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent did he not say in mark 11 22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it will come to pass you can have what you have said and he goes on to say what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together it's too omnipotent something's got to shake so when you have the holy ghost when you have received christ as your personal savior you are a pertain your a potential omnipotent when you have the holy ghost you are omnipotent so he says what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together he says something's got to shake whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of god knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word he says it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass that's things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotent have met isn't this the same scripture that's in isaiah that says when god speaks his word does not come back to him void so when you become omnipotent god is sharing with you that creative power you just gotta believe it you just gotta know what you're talking about you just gotta have that faith which gives you that victory amen so we have to know that we are omnipotent and the devil is always trying to confuse us he's always trying to distract us and has brings that doubt within us you think i cannot pray for this thing to happen i might though i might not have that authority but i'm here to tell you the prophet of god is telling this we are omnipotent and every time two omnipotents meet you and god these are shaking that's gonna happen that sickness has to shake off that whatever problem that's in your life that is tormenting you it has to shake when two omnipotents meet there's no problem that can stand before you so you gotta know your true identity you gotta know who you are and the prophet of god said um you know the padma's vision he says don't fear john we know john is a representation of the bride he was a top of the bridge he says all that i am you are heir to all my power that is yours my omnipotence is yours as i stand in your midst i have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and i will perform it that is my covenant and it can never fail what is that covenant the covenant is you speak the word and i will perform it so we just got to take god at his word he says that's my covenant we serve a god that doesn't break his covenant we have seen out through the bible he had a covenant with abraham he fulfilled it to the t everything god has said in his word every covenant he made it with man he did it so why would he break his covenant now so if you just got to remember that god has a covenant with me that i have to speak the word and he will perform it that is the third pool ministry that we saw in the in the in the ministry of of of the prophet of god that put the third pool ministry when he spoke things happened when he spoke those uh squirrels were created and that same power is laying in you and me all we have to do is speak and we know god will perform it because we know that that's his covenant with him and us and um we said earlier on that faith comes by hearing and by hearing the word of god again here in the prophet god says there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what jesus is he is the word so when a spirit-born spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man i'ma repeat that he says when a spirit filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips so when you are listening to that tape when you're in church listening to that word and you are reading that bible when you take that word and you take it to your heart and then you put it on your lips the prophet of god says that is the same as deity speaking no don't take it to your head but take it to your heart because in the head that's where the devil reasons out and the moment you start reasoning with the devil you are already defeated so don't take that word to your to your mind but take it to your heart and when you take it to your lips it is the same as deer is speaking that is the deadpool and we have to exercise it this comes we are supposed to come to a point where you can tell the brother and you say i give you rain why that is the power we have the power to do it and we believe at some place the prophet of god calls it reckless faith someplace stubborn faith because you know it is happening you know it will happen because you have that faith and you have that confidence in god that his word when he says i have a covenant with you he will never fail we know hetty wright she was there and her sons they were they were playing wherever they were and when she was asked what do you need she realized that the anointing was there she knew that god was the and she believed she had that atmosphere believing is that atmosphere that faith can work in and she believed for her children and when and when she said i want the salvation of my two boys when the prophet of god spake and gave it to her she received the salvation and the boys were saved why because she had faith she knew it can happen it could happen so it doesn't matter if you have loved ones that that are not saved you know god can still do it what he did before he can do it again all those things that god did in the past was just not for history we do not serve a god of history what he did back then he can do it today that was just an example to show you that what i did i can do it in your life here we are in the last age we are the last people we don't have no history to be written no more so everything that's there everything that's in the bible it is there for us to use every story that happened in the bible every testimony i'll call it that's in the bible is to encourage you and me when you come across a similar situation you say lord that is me i need that in my life and god is able to do that for you and me so we just have to have faith and believe and god will give us the victory so it doesn't matter where you are you say i don't have a gift the the bible says the gift will kill 6 000 and you kill your 1 000. so you're gonna have to stand and say lord where is my thousand i have that faith i gotta kill my one thousand demons i gotta kill my one thousand problems i have that sickness i have to kill it because i have that faith and your word says i'm gonna have to i will overcome and you take god in his word amen so we just have to have faith and we know that faith is going to take us to the rapture that faith is what we need for our bodies to be translated how can you be translated if you don't have faith to heal a headache that cannot happen you have to have faith and faith the more you use it thus the more it grows bigger the bible says if you have faith like a mustard seed you can say to a mountain be moved when he was talking about that there are two sides to it a mustard seed is small so if you have small faith you can speak things for things to happen if you have that little faith but also a mustard seed it is because a mustard seed it cannot be high bread this that's one of the only seeds that cannot be hybrid or mixed with anything else so if you have that faith and you don't mix the word of god with anything else and you are just resting your faith only on the word you know that with your faith god can perform wonders with your faith god can grant you your heart's desires why because it is unadulterated it is not hybrid with any unbelief that faith don't let it hybrid with any doubt it's because god can use that little faith to move that mountain into the sea when he says that you shouldn't care wait is where is the um the the earth move or the crane where is it going to come from to move the the mountain into the sea that is not your problem the word of god just says when you say that mountain is going to be moved so when i speak i'm not worried about how it's going to go there because that's not my responsibility it's not my responsibility to make it come to pass my responsibility is just to speak i know god will do it one way or the other because he has never failed and he will never fail you and i will promise to do exploits daniel wanted to leave in this day when when he saw god gave him a snapshot of what was going on today he said lord i want to live in that in that day i also want to live there daniel wanted to sit where you are seated right now but god said you go your way daniel this is not your time i have a special person who is supposed to be there and we all know the testimony of daniel he was cast in the lion's den and we know the the three hebrew boys they were cast into a lake of fire and they were not burnt and with that testimony god says no you go your way the better people were supposed to learn to run the final race so imagine when you go to heaven then daniel asks you what did you do in your age then you say nothing he's going to say that's where i wanted to live because he understood with the full revelation of the power anything is possible he understood that with all the mysteries open all the seven seals open and all the power that god has given to the bride the covenant that god has with you and me that when you speak things has to happen he knew that it is unlimited it is an ending what god can do in your life what god can do in my in my life so that's why he wanted to live there so you and me we are not supposed to be troubled by circumstances that come away problems that come away we have to use that faith when diseases come we are supposed to pray and we know that the disease will leave not for ourselves only but even for our loved ones when we pray for them we know they're supposed to be delivered not only diseases probably an evil habit that is the faith can actually change that away as well because while we have the power we have the power to speak we have the power to pray and things will happen because god wants to use you god wants to use me because those exploits that daniel saw was for you and me and we can only do that if we have faith and that is how we will get our victory amen let us stand up on our feet amen you know with faith everything is possible just if you could just only believe you know all things are possible nothing can stand before you if you have faith you know of that lady that was in memphis tennessee it was have faith that brought a whole flight down there were businessmen in there were running to meetings or people who had different schedules but have faith stopped all that because she saw herself in the word and she says i believe that's me and that has to happen for me and have faith brought the whole plane down and it was delayed so that her desire could be fulfilled so that her petition could be fulfilled because she knew who she was she knew what she was believing on she knew that god's word never fails she saw herself in the word and says that's me lord thank you i know you never failed your word and she was relaxed because she knew god never fails let us bow heads and pray dear father we thank you o father god for this opportunity you've given us our lord to hear you speak your word to our hearts oh lord thank you oh father god reminding us oh god of the faith that you have given to us lord we just pray oh father god that you give us more diligence oh father god and uh remind us lord to know that we can do a lot more with the faith that you've given us lord please increase our faith just like the disciples ask you lord this is our praying house desire because we know that without faith we cannot please you and all we want to do for the rest of our lives lord is to please you of jesus christ give us this faith because we know the victories that you promised us you said we are more than conquerors we are overcomers how can we be overcomers without that faith oh lord i pray oh lord we know you already gave it to us but lord may you just give us that realization that it's already lying there we just don't want it to lie dormant but father help us to activate it and use it when we need it oh father god because we know we're gonna need that same faith for the translation of our bodies we know we're gonna need that faith for the healing of our bodies we need that faith for this our relatives for our dear loved ones to be saved for them to return back to the world we know we need that faith just to know that you will do it father just help us to stand firm on your word and never to be wavered by the destructions of the devil for we know you can do it for us in jesus christ's name i pray believing amen let us sing this song of victory is mine as brother friend comes back oh victory is mine
