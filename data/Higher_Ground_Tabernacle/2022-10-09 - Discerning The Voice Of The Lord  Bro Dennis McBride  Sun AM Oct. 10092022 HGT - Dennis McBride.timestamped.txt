[37:20] have performed the Commandment of the
[37:22] Lord
[37:29] and Samuel said what meaneth the what
[37:32] meaneth then this bleeding of the sheep
[37:34] in my ears and the lowering of the ox in
[37:37] which I hear Samir indeed kids
[37:47] amen let's pray
[37:49] Heavenly Father
[37:51] yeah
[37:52] for again Lord blessing us to be able to
[37:56] come foreign
[37:57] [Music]
[38:36] [Music]
[38:50] and you said that's who you came for
[38:53] questions for those that know that they
[38:56] need help
[38:59] so we don't want to be a proud people
[39:03] because what follows Pride because sweet
[39:08] like like logo is destruction it's like
[39:10] destruction and father we need healing
[39:14] we need help to help us to be humble
[39:19] to your Holy Spirit
[39:22] we ask this in your name
[39:26] the name of our Lord and Savior
[39:30] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ amen amen amen
[39:33] God bless you Saints
[39:35] you maybe
[39:41] and I want to continue reading on now
[39:45] scripture
[39:49] I just didn't want to keep you standing
[39:51] long
[39:53] I do starting at verse 15.
[39:59] it says and Saul said they have brought
[40:02] them from the amlicites for the people
[40:04] spared the best of the sheep and of The
[40:07] Oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God
[40:09] and the rest we have utterly destroyed
[40:14] the is
[40:21] [Music]
[40:29] then Samuel said unto Saul stay
[40:32] and I will tell thee what the Lord has
[40:35] said to me this night and he said unto
[40:37] him say all yes
[40:48] it says in Samuel and Samuel said when
[40:52] thou was little in our own sight was
[40:55] thou not made the head of the tribes of
[40:58] Israel and the Lord Anointed The King
[41:00] over Israel Samir died
[41:13] and the Lord sent thee on a journey and
[41:16] said go and ugly destroy the Sinners the
[41:19] amalekites and fight against them until
[41:21] they be consumed wherefore then did as
[41:24] thou not obey notice this it says the
[41:26] voice of the Lord but thou didst fly
[41:29] upon the spoil and did his evil in the
[41:32] sight of the Lord
[41:34] is
[41:51] so to God I know I told you it's evil
[41:56] not to be his voice
[42:00] can we say praise the Lord
[42:03] amen so let's read on down
[42:09] and Saul said unto Samuel yea I have
[42:12] obeyed the voice of the Lord
[42:14] and have gone the way which the Lord
[42:16] sent me and have brought a gag the king
[42:19] of amlak and have utterly destroyed the
[42:22] amalekites yes
[42:37] so Samuel was a prophet of God
[42:40] did you and man he was the he was a very
[42:44] mouthpiece of God
[42:46] when Samuel spoke
[42:48] that was God's speech did you keep out
[42:51] there isn't that right
[42:53] so here it is Samuel is talking to Saul
[42:56] hello
[42:57] and Saul knows that Samuel is a prophet
[43:00] is
[43:02] he knows that Samuel is a man of God
[43:07] and God is now speaking through Samuel
[43:10] amen
[43:12] he tells Saul
[43:14] you have not obeyed my voice
[43:17] and Saul looks at Samuel
[43:20] who is speaking by the spirit of God
[43:23] and he's telling God
[43:26] no no I did obey your voice
[43:32] Samuel was confused
[43:36] he didn't understand what he was doing
[43:39] and we say praise the Lord
[43:41] God was speaking to him
[43:45] but he was telling God no you're wrong
[43:50] but he didn't think that he was doing
[43:52] that
[43:53] in his own side
[43:56] but he was doing it in the sight of God
[44:01] you he was challenging god dude
[44:07] and he didn't realize
[44:10] since we never want to find ourselves we
[44:14] never want to find ourselves
[44:21] so my title this morning
[44:24] is Discerning
[44:27] the voice of the Lord
[44:32] the voice of the Lord
[44:38] the time we're living in right now
[44:44] everybody's saying they're here that
[44:46] they hear from God
[44:49] amen amen especially in the church ma'am
[44:52] don't produce something called don't eat
[44:54] please everybody want to feel
[44:56] Judy like they're being led by God
[45:01] and many people will say
[45:04] the Lord led me
[45:07] or the Lord spoke to me
[45:09] but the question is
[45:12] did God really speak to you
[45:17] that's very important
[45:19] because the Bible says as many as are
[45:23] led by the spirit of God
[45:26] it says they are the sons of God
[45:30] and the daughters of God
[45:32] can we say praise the Lord so understand
[45:35] this if you don't have the direct
[45:39] leading of God in your life
[45:41] the leadership the Jew you don't have
[45:45] nothing
[45:47] whatever decisions you make
[45:50] if they're not being led by God
[45:54] they are wrong decisions
[45:57] can we say praise the Lord I'm talking
[46:00] about in our everyday lives
[46:02] in home business don't don't hold
[46:07] how you conduct your home
[46:10] the activities that go on in your home
[46:13] right we need the leading of God
[46:17] in our homes Amazon we need to be able
[46:20] to hear
[46:22] God's voice
[46:25] because if we don't have that sound
[46:28] we'll be misled
[46:31] and nobody wants to be misled
[46:37] our young adults
[46:40] you have you get you're getting ready to
[46:42] step out into your careers
[46:46] you just don't want to go into whatever
[46:48] career you want to go into universities
[46:53] can we say praise the Lord I do you want
[46:57] to go into the career
[46:59] or the occupation
[47:01] that God has for you
[47:04] can we say praise the Lord
[47:06] you can't go into a job
[47:10] solely based upon
[47:14] how much money you'll make
[47:18] even though that's what we all want
[47:22] I want to make more money myself
[47:26] but what's the point in making more
[47:27] money
[47:29] if you're outside of the will of God
[47:33] because with that more money is going to
[47:36] come troubles
[47:38] trouble you don't have to deal with
[47:40] it
[47:44] see God has a perfect will you and God
[47:49] has a permissive will you're outside
[47:53] God's perfect will
[47:55] it's what he wants
[47:58] [Applause]
[48:06] for the fam because you want to do it
[48:11] and you don't care enough if you're not
[48:14] fool about his will
[48:17] so God will let you go
[48:21] and have your own way
[48:26] that you don't want his way
[48:29] our Prophet said
[48:32] that God will give you the desire of
[48:36] your heart
[48:37] even though it be against
[48:40] his will stop hold on 10. when he gives
[48:43] you an answer going to do concerning a
[48:46] prayer uh
[48:48] yeah when you've asked him a question
[48:51] and he gives you that answers
[48:54] and he sees that you're dissatisfied
[48:58] with his choice
[49:00] and you come to him again
[49:04] because the answer you gave that he gave
[49:06] you
[49:07] was not the answer that you wanted to
[49:10] hear
[49:11] so you want to go back to God In Prayer
[49:15] if you want to Pray Again
[49:18] because maybe
[49:21] maybe I didn't hear God Christian
[49:24] and brother Brandon said God will give
[49:28] you the desire of your heart just like
[49:32] he did with Baylor
[49:39] should he go es
[49:42] back to him and God came to him and he
[49:46] said no don't go back and he heard dogs
[49:51] but it wasn't according to his desires
[49:55] because our Prophet said
[49:58] that Balaam wanted to curse Israel
[50:03] so he was able to go to God again
[50:06] because of what was really in his heart
[50:10] but notice this
[50:12] when he went back to God the second time
[50:16] for it God didn't give him no resistance
[50:23] the second time fought when God gave him
[50:27] that answer yeah
[50:31] God spoke to me
[50:40] Balaam can say God spoke to me
[50:43] and he wouldn't be lying
[50:49] but even though God spoke to him
[50:53] God said go ahead
[50:56] as though there was no problem
[51:01] but when Balaam went
[51:04] the Bible says there was an angel
[51:07] that was standing in the way
[51:10] to kill Baylor
[51:17] so it would have been much better
[51:19] for him to be accepting
[51:23] of whatever the initial voice of God was
[51:29] so now Saul hello he heard clearly
[51:34] what Samuel told him
[51:36] before they went to fight with the
[51:39] amlikas
[51:42] because God spoke to Samuel
[51:45] and then Samuel spoke to Saul
[51:48] and the instruction was very clear
[51:51] can we say praise the Lord but when he
[51:55] got there
[51:56] and he began to listen to other people
[52:01] then there was an influence
[52:07] to put down the perfect will of God
[52:12] and to enter into the permissive will of
[52:16] God
[52:37] please no
[52:39] that when you put down the voice of God
[52:43] when you refuse to accept the voice of
[52:46] God
[52:48] immediately
[52:50] you begin to follow
[52:52] your voice
[52:59] Saul did not know
[53:01] that he had actually began to be led
[53:06] by an evil spirit
[53:10] that was causing him to do the exact
[53:12] opposite
[53:14] of what God had actually said
[53:19] but when that evil spirit came the soul
[53:23] Saul actually thought Cyrus that he was
[53:27] hearing from God
[53:29] because Saul says I have done I have
[53:34] obeyed the voice of the Lord
[53:56] that is God
[54:03] so when you hear people say
[54:07] the Lord is leading me
[54:10] well the Lord told me
[54:14] you just can't accept that as being God
[54:19] many times people are there
[54:22] by their own desires
[54:26] have you ever thought about this
[54:28] when somebody really like say for
[54:31] instance
[54:32] for example
[54:33] somebody might want um
[54:36] a Rolls-Royce Roy's Royce you've watched
[54:40] your Rolls-Royce right
[54:42] how many don't like how many don't like
[54:45] a Rolls Royce
[54:46] rewards Royce they watch your Rolls
[54:48] Royce I'll take a Rolls Royce
[54:51] if it's the Lord's Wheels
[54:54] but if it's not Lord the Lord
[54:57] I don't want a Rolls-Royce but some
[55:01] people can have a Rolls-Royce sowing
[55:03] their hearts itself
[55:06] until just got screwed if it looks as
[55:10] though
[55:13] if it looks as though they can get one
[55:17] I've watched it towards Royce even if
[55:19] it's not the Lord's will
[55:22] because they so desire it is
[55:26] if somehow a way opens up that they can
[55:30] actually get one
[55:33] many people would think
[55:36] that that was God
[55:38] giving them that Rolls-Royce
[55:41] because it's the very thing they wanted
[55:44] anyway
[56:02] in the yard
[56:05] he sit in the yard he drives
[56:08] your happiness they gotta lose their
[56:10] house
[56:13] because they can't make no house
[56:15] payments
[56:17] but yeah they thought it was of the Lord
[56:23] but everything shows
[56:26] when you lost your house
[56:28] when you can't pay your bills when
[56:31] you're struggling to have this
[56:34] Rolls-Royce
[56:36] that shows you that that wasn't God's
[56:39] will
[56:42] and sometimes people people are so set
[56:45] in their own ways
[56:50] until God has to allow them
[56:54] to make wrong decisions
[57:03] amen they have to train them to what his
[57:06] voice really is
[57:12] the woman you want
[57:14] God
[57:16] get the man that you want Lord have
[57:19] mercy
[57:21] you understand
[57:28] just so you can see
[57:30] right that that wasn't his choice
[57:35] because after you get that person
[57:40] brother said your life on Earth yeah
[57:49] you have so many troubles
[57:52] so many problems
[57:56] see God's way is so much better I don't
[57:58] know why did you said you know so so
[58:00] mayor you understand what I'm saying but
[58:03] you got to come to the place so where
[58:06] you really want God's way
[58:09] in the Bible in Proverbs chapter 3
[58:14] the Bible says don't lean to your own
[58:17] understanding
[58:20] it said trust in the Lord
[58:24] with all of your heart
[58:27] if you're trusting with all of your
[58:29] heart
[58:31] that don't leave any of your heart
[58:35] to trust in anything else
[58:38] he says trust in the Lord with all of
[58:42] your heart
[58:46] to your own understanding yeah
[58:49] but in all your ways
[58:53] no matter what it is
[58:55] every decision of your everyday life
[58:59] he said in all your ways
[59:09] we pray to God
[59:11] we pray we live a prayer for life
[59:15] amen but we're constantly asking God
[59:18] for his leadership can we say praise the
[59:22] Lord because we don't want to make a
[59:25] wrong move
[59:26] amen without God being with us
[59:30] we want to we want to be able to step
[59:32] correctly
[59:35] we've all made wrong decisions
[59:39] can we say praise the Lord
[59:41] and now we can see back when we look
[59:44] back at those decisions
[59:46] and decisions that you thought you were
[59:49] being Led Led by God to me this is
[59:53] God allows you to make that decision
[59:57] and then he comes to you and he shows
[1:00:00] you that was not me
[1:00:03] and now he wants you to look and study
[1:00:06] that decision
[1:00:07] study that situation so you can
[1:00:11] understand where you went wrong
[1:00:15] because then you learn from that music
[1:00:18] no you're beginning to be trained to the
[1:00:22] voice of God
[1:00:24] now as we begin to make more decisions
[1:00:28] you will be more careful now
[1:00:30] you understand what I'm saying because
[1:00:33] you don't want that trouble no more that
[1:00:35] came with that wrong decision you don't
[1:00:38] want to go through those hardships no
[1:00:39] more
[1:00:40] an emotional heartbreak
[1:00:44] when you got the woman you shouldn't
[1:00:45] have had when you got the man you
[1:00:48] shouldn't have had and you experienced
[1:00:51] that heartbreak amen when your mind is
[1:00:56] on your emotions
[1:01:03] because of your wrong decision
[1:01:06] you don't want to go through that no
[1:01:09] more
[1:01:10] amen life is a good teacher life life
[1:01:16] lessons are good teachers for us to help
[1:01:21] us to begin to find

[1:09:39] I look forward to being in that Rapture
[1:09:42] with each one of you
[1:09:44] amen and that will rise up together by
[1:09:48] the grace of God God loves every one of
[1:09:50] us
[1:09:52] and we are all a work in progress
[1:09:55] [Applause]
[1:09:56] you make mistakes
[1:09:59] you my tomato you might have made a
[1:10:01] wrong decision yesterday with
[1:10:07] God understands us
[1:10:10] and he's here to help us
[1:10:12] he'll correct us and he'll work with us
[1:10:16] and then he'll teach us to give us
[1:10:19] strength to be able to overcome the
[1:10:21] enemy no matter where he is in our lives
[1:10:30] he knows how to work with us
[1:10:34] I got five children
[1:10:36] I learned a lot
[1:10:39] I know how to work with them now
[1:10:42] but I made a lot of mistakes
[1:10:45] I didn't want to make
[1:10:47] it but I'm human vegetarian
[1:10:51] I'm still being trained to the voice of
[1:10:53] God
[1:10:57] first Samuel chapter three
[1:10:59] starting at verse
[1:11:01] please pay close attention
[1:11:06] this is very good
[1:11:09] it says and the child Samuel ministered
[1:11:12] unto the Lord before Eli jeans
[1:11:17] now this is the same Samuel I don't
[1:11:20] remember Samuel that was speaking by the
[1:11:23] spirit of God
[1:11:28] see when we read in first Samuel 15.
[1:11:33] see he was old enough
[1:11:36] see he had experience with God now you
[1:11:39] know
[1:11:41] now now when God speaks to him I may not
[1:11:45] come true rebound he wasn't confused
[1:11:48] he knew precisely
[1:11:50] that it was God because it did you but
[1:11:53] his life wasn't always like that
[1:11:56] comes up so here in verse 1 of chapter
[1:12:00] three
[1:12:01] it says and the word of the Lord was
[1:12:04] precious in those days
[1:12:08] it says there was no open vision
[1:12:11] and it came to pass that time when Eli
[1:12:16] was laid down in his place
[1:12:20] and his eyes begin to wax them
[1:12:23] that he could not see it is
[1:12:28] where the lamp of God went out in the
[1:12:30] temple of the Lord
[1:12:34] where the Ark of God was
[1:12:37] and Samuel was laid down to sleep
[1:12:46] Samuel was laid down to sleep
[1:12:51] so now Samuel asleep
[1:12:54] he's in the temple of God don't don't
[1:12:57] put the Jew doing the service unto the
[1:12:59] Lord on selfie on the cell phone he was
[1:13:02] a prophet
[1:13:03] he was born a prophet and we say praise
[1:13:06] the Lord
[1:13:08] see
[1:13:26] so he heard her voice
[1:13:30] but he couldn't discern that voice
[1:13:33] he responded but he didn't know who he
[1:13:37] was responding to tell me
[1:13:41] amen
[1:13:44] verse five thou said sunk so because he
[1:13:48] didn't know who he was responding to
[1:13:49] hello
[1:13:52] in his mind
[1:13:54] he said well you know he lies here
[1:13:58] and I heard the voice
[1:14:01] so let me go see what Eli wanted I don't
[1:14:04] know
[1:14:05] so it says that he ran unto Eli
[1:14:08] and he said here am I notice this
[1:14:12] thou call this me got you my happily he
[1:14:16] heard the voice of God why don't you
[1:14:18] have what did you but he thought it was
[1:14:19] the voice of a man
[1:14:24] see at this point he's growing I said
[1:14:27] we're going to you but everything is not
[1:14:29] clear yet
[1:14:31] I don't doubt that there's times
[1:14:35] among our young people dude
[1:14:37] that God is speaking to you
[1:14:40] but you just can't quite understand it
[1:14:43] just yeah
[1:14:47] notice this
[1:15:33] and he was doing a service unto God
[1:15:36] badger
[1:15:40] the word no more
[1:15:44] in the dictionary
[1:15:46] everybody with me
[1:15:49] the word no the meaning of no
[1:15:52] in the dictionary
[1:15:54] it means to develop a relationship with
[1:15:59] someone
[1:16:00] it says through meeting and spending
[1:16:04] time with them
[1:16:08] [Music]
[1:16:10] everybody in here
[1:16:13] not just young people you could be in
[1:16:16] the church for 10 years 15 years or 30
[1:16:22] years and still not know the Lord
[1:16:26] you understand what I'm saying
[1:16:28] that's nothing to be ashamed about
[1:16:31] but if you're able to recognize that
[1:16:34] it's a blessing to you
[1:16:38] [Applause]
[1:16:40] to get to know the Lord
[1:16:44] because there are many people
[1:16:46] understand this the Bible says there are
[1:16:51] many people yeah that are walking
[1:16:52] through this life
[1:16:55] and they're having experiences with God
[1:16:58] he's on this experience meaning the true
[1:17:01] anointing of God
[1:17:04] it's coming down upon their lives
[1:18:42] the most important thing foreign
[1:19:12] even though they were being used by God
[1:19:14] memories
[1:19:16] they were living their lives
[1:19:23] they were being led by an evil spirit
[1:19:29] right
[1:19:31] he said depart from me
[1:19:34] for I never knew
[1:19:42] so I don't Rejoice because I can
[1:19:45] preaching
[1:19:46] I don't Rejoice because somebody might
[1:19:49] say oh brother
[1:19:51] you preached a good message oh you're a
[1:19:56] man of God
[1:19:57] I'm beyond that
[1:20:00] because of my life
[1:20:02] in my personal private life
[1:20:06] listen you know if you got a
[1:20:09] relationship with God enough
[1:20:11] you understand what I'm saying don't let
[1:20:20] first John chapter four I don't know
[1:20:24] I'm going back to First Samuel three
[1:20:28] but I want to touch on First John
[1:20:31] chapter four
[1:20:32] got them
[1:20:34] listen to this this is very important
[1:20:36] we're dealing with Spirits
[1:20:39] please understand Spirits are in this
[1:20:42] room right now
[1:20:45] you understand what I'm saying they're
[1:20:48] folks that are coming to people's minds
[1:20:49] right now
[1:20:51] and if you can't discern that violence
[1:20:54] you could be listen you can be given
[1:20:57] place
[1:20:59] but considering the thought of a devil
[1:21:04] that's trying to distract you yes from
[1:21:07] the voice of God
[1:21:09] you
[1:21:12] the Bible says in first John chapter
[1:21:14] four now people don't understand in
[1:21:17] verse one
[1:21:18] explain the Bible says beloved
[1:21:22] believe not every Spirit
[1:21:27] but then it says but try the spirits
[1:21:33] whether they are of God will I see sold
[1:21:36] the jury now you understand that means
[1:21:38] listen I don't feel confidential when we
[1:21:41] come to church you know some not just
[1:21:44] when we come to church we can be at home
[1:21:47] no some people get real good
[1:21:51] and looking at everybody else
[1:21:55] and trying to see evil spirits on
[1:21:58] everybody else while the movies and
[1:22:00] speed on two more and they become
[1:22:01] professionals
[1:22:04] and being able to see spirits on
[1:22:06] everybody else
[1:22:09] but then when they come to themselves
[1:22:15] they can't seem to see where the evil
[1:22:17] spirit
[1:22:22] the Bible says before you can cast The
[1:22:25] Beam out of your brothers
[1:23:13] now you can help somebody else
[1:23:17] foreign
[1:23:48] so try every spirit I don't improve it
[1:23:51] do this is free how does the Spirit come
[1:23:53] to you come on this is
[1:23:58] see you have a spirit
[1:24:01] so when the spirit comes to you
[1:24:04] it speaks to you powder but when a
[1:24:08] spirit speaks to you
[1:24:09] you hear it as a thought coming Ponce
[1:24:17] see many people don't understand
[1:24:20] they have thoughts all day
[1:24:24] you're having thoughts right now
[1:24:27] the Bible saying try the thoughts you
[1:24:30] having in your mind right now
[1:24:34] to see whether or not it be of God
[1:24:41] if it's something that's trying to get
[1:24:42] your mind
[1:24:45] during that power did you some people
[1:24:47] are already thinking about what they're
[1:24:48] gonna eat it is
[1:24:51] but God is trying to give us something
[1:24:54] make sure we don't need to catch your
[1:24:55] shoes some people are already thinking
[1:24:57] about what they're going to wear to work
[1:24:58] tomorrow
[1:25:01] or what they gonna wear when they get
[1:25:03] out of church
[1:25:07] because dress clothes aren't always the
[1:25:09] most comfortable clothes
[1:25:11] but dress clothes are not always the
[1:25:13] most comfortable clothes
[1:25:19] so some people are thinking but I don't
[1:25:22] have ten pounds and I can't wait to get
[1:25:24] out of these clothes
[1:25:26] and you're already thinking about what
[1:25:28] you're gonna put on when you get here
[1:25:31] but we're in church right now
[1:25:34] and see evil spirits they want to
[1:25:37] distract us at all times we know
[1:25:41] ourselves don't we when you at home
[1:25:44] and you know you need to pray
[1:25:48] [Applause]
[1:25:50] think about how that devil tries to
[1:25:52] distract you oh my God then come on so
[1:25:54] yes to demo is trap you gotta do
[1:25:56] everything else
[1:25:59] but look because of how those don't
[1:26:01] because of how those spirits come
[1:26:04] here you don't see it as an evil spirit
[1:26:07] God to help you
[1:26:10] to be able to see how the devil is
[1:26:13] trying to hinder you in your day-to-day
[1:26:16] life
[1:26:17] can we say praise the Lord
[1:26:20] I want to read something here
[1:26:24] our prophet in a message called hear his
[1:26:28] voice
[1:26:31] brother Brandon said he says but listen
[1:26:34] he says to his small steel voice his
[1:26:38] steel Small Voice
[1:26:40] he says every one of you people he said
[1:26:43] who professed to be Christians
[1:26:46] he said get yourself quiet
[1:26:49] before him God was that Devon wreath now
[1:26:53] remember the word no I don't know
[1:26:55] it's for you to begin to become familiar
[1:26:58] with someone
[1:27:01] through communicating with them
[1:27:04] and spending time with them
[1:27:07] many people say they know the Lord
[1:27:10] and they don't know the Lord they want
[1:27:14] to know the Lord but they are not
[1:27:16] willing to put the time to spend time
[1:27:20] with God maybe there are too many things
[1:27:23] he last book through the shows take up
[1:27:25] that time poem was shut down but listen
[1:27:28] God want to spend time with you
[1:27:32] more than what you want to spend time
[1:27:34] with him
[1:27:37] he's always waiting
[1:27:40] he's always ready
[1:27:44] because he loves you let's keep Museum
[1:27:46] you're the apple of his eyes he wants
[1:27:50] your attention

[1:29:19] separate the clothes

[1:29:25] and put the clothes up amen
[1:29:28] my daughter shares part in that too I
[1:29:32] got four Sons
[1:29:35] my daughter is the baby and my my feet
[1:29:39] maybe one day you'll get a chance to
[1:29:41] meet him
[1:29:43] some of the brothers that came down to
[1:29:45] South Carolina
[1:29:46] they had a chance to see my family
[1:29:50] but notice what the prophet says
[1:29:53] he says get quiet before God
[1:29:57] he says don't let the washing hinder you
[1:30:00] oh
[1:30:04] don't let the washing hinder Elizabeth
[1:30:08] he said don't let the work hinder
[1:30:14] so sisters and brothers hello finally
[1:30:17] sir there might be things that need to
[1:30:19] be done it puts you it puts you have one
[1:30:21] of the shows but when the king
[1:30:24] wants to spend time with you
[1:30:28] what God is saying
[1:30:30] you put me you remember me before
[1:30:34] washing the dishes
[1:30:36] yet you might say oh I gotta wash the
[1:30:40] dishes remember Martha and Mary
[1:30:45] Martha was busy
[1:30:49] she was cleaning up
[1:30:55] and Jesus was in Jesus was in the
[1:30:58] building
[1:31:02] but she was cleaning up I like don't
[1:31:04] touch it
[1:31:05] and in her mind don't sit on sick she
[1:31:08] looking at her sister
[1:31:10] she relaxing
[1:31:13] but she wasn't being lazy see I didn't
[1:31:16] tell you
[1:31:17] she was relaxing and it did at the feet
[1:31:24] see Jesus was speaking about it and it
[1:31:29] was more important than Mary
[1:31:31] to hear his voice
[1:31:35] versus washing a dish
[1:32:09] that she was not hearing the voice of
[1:32:12] God
[1:32:14] okay
[1:32:15] that was another voice from another
[1:32:18] spirit
[1:32:19] that was trying to pull Mary out from
[1:32:22] the voice of God
[1:32:26] what did Jesus say oh Jesus
[1:32:30] you got so many things on your mind
[1:32:34] he said but Mary has found that good
[1:32:37] part
[1:32:40] from her okay
[1:32:45] he said don't let the washing hinder
[1:32:47] twice he said don't let the work
[1:32:51] he said don't let nothing happen
[1:32:54] he says don't let nobody know what
[1:32:57] you're doing
[1:32:59] listen now
[1:33:00] he said just go before him
[1:33:05] get up in the woods somewhere
[1:33:09] get out on the side of the road
[1:33:14] so that means if you driving somewhere
[1:33:17] foreign
[1:33:59] that's the kind of leadership God wants
[1:34:01] us
[1:34:03] that's how sensitive
[1:34:06] sensitive
[1:34:08] that God wants us to be could you say
[1:34:11] come on
[1:34:15] see that's that's what he's growing us
[1:34:18] up into since
[1:34:20] the prophet said we're going to get to a
[1:34:23] place
[1:34:25] until she won't move
[1:34:28] Jesus
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:35:08] we're becoming him you're different only
[1:35:18] you understand that
[1:35:21] I don't know about you
[1:35:24] but experiences are increasing
[1:35:26] experience
[1:35:30] but it's happening so simple
[1:35:33] listen God is moving in such a simple
[1:35:36] way
[1:35:39] because many people are looking right at
[1:35:41] God it is
[1:35:50] me and Brother Rich went out for dinner
[1:35:53] last night
[1:35:55] and I mentioned something to him
[1:35:59] I said
[1:36:01] it don't happen all the time
[1:36:04] but they're all tired and I know I ain't
[1:36:07] the only one it happened
[1:36:09] sometimes somebody can be talking to you
[1:36:14] you know we got a lot of things on our
[1:36:16] minds but sometimes a God God will bring
[1:36:19] you conscious
[1:36:22] that's that's him because work on this
[1:36:25] liquor it's actually and now when you
[1:36:26] look at that person and now God is
[1:36:28] bringing you conscience and that's
[1:36:30] actually him speaking through that
[1:36:31] person's mouth could you don't
[1:36:33] understand
[1:36:34] has that ever happened to you before
[1:36:41] and as we would God can actually use one
[1:36:44] of you dripper trees and you don't even
[1:36:47] realize
[1:36:51] but it's such a blessing message
[1:36:53] benediction for God to be dealing with
[1:36:56] us could you no matter who he's living
[1:36:58] with us through
[1:37:00] and to be able to see it
[1:37:03] you understand that you're capturing the
[1:37:07] visitation of God
[1:37:10] Jesus said blessed are your eyes
[1:37:15] in your ears
[1:37:23] the prophet says this Prophet Jesus he
[1:37:25] says go up in the woods somewhere
[1:37:27] divided he says get out on the side of
[1:37:30] the road
[1:37:31] he says go into the secret closet and
[1:37:34] then close the door why don't that show
[1:37:35] more secrets he found that book he says
[1:37:37] when the kids get out at school hey they
[1:37:40] call his own phone today when your kids
[1:37:42] go to school he says there get down on
[1:37:45] your knees
[1:37:47] amen amen he says you've heard all kinds
[1:37:51] of voices everywhere
[1:37:55] I don't have time to get into everything
[1:37:57] I want to get in here
[1:38:02] how many real life
[1:38:05] we need to discern the voice of the Lord
[1:38:09] how many know that Peter is a Peter was
[1:38:12] a Son of God
[1:38:14] he is the Son of God right
[1:38:17] God used him the preach the gospel your
[1:38:19] life
[1:38:22] the same mouth that preached the gospel
[1:38:24] by the spirit of God
[1:38:28] that was a Son of God
[1:38:31] he was an apostle of God
[1:38:33] giving the keys to the kingdom
[1:38:37] please understand
[1:38:40] it don't matter what your relationship
[1:38:42] to somebody is
[1:38:45] it don't matter if it's the pastor
[1:38:48] one of the ministers your husband your
[1:38:52] wife it don't matter who it is the Bible
[1:38:55] says try every Spirit they prove it
[1:38:59] through even though they're your loved
[1:39:01] ones
[1:39:02] and they are true children of God
[1:39:06] sometimes the devil can grab a person
[1:39:09] and they not even know it
[1:39:12] and Satan speak out of their mouths
[1:39:16] Peter was a Son of God an apostle of God
[1:39:21] but listen Satan was able to step inside
[1:39:26] and when Satan came inside of people
[1:39:30] Peter didn't even know it yeah
[1:39:44] Christ
[1:39:47] had just made known what his purpose was
[1:39:51] he had just made noise
[1:39:56] on boots but Satan didn't want the word
[1:39:59] to be carried out
[1:40:04] because he loved Jesus
[1:40:08] he's talking to his friends
[1:40:14] that's not going to happen to you
[1:40:17] when Jesus heard Peter's voice
[1:40:21] he recognized that was a country boy
[1:40:24] and even though that was his son and
[1:40:27] Madison said this on Feast you
[1:40:28] understand this even though Peter was
[1:40:31] his very solid
[1:40:33] the Bible says he looked at Peter and he
[1:40:36] said get thee behind me
[1:40:41] thou savior is the things that be a man
[1:40:43] and not of God
[1:40:48] the same mouth that spoke by the spirit
[1:40:50] of God
[1:40:56] we have to have discernment of spirit
[1:40:59] world
[1:41:00] so you can recognize that difference
[1:41:04] and not just go along with something
[1:41:08] because of how you feel about that
[1:41:10] person
[1:41:12] because of the position that person
[1:41:14] holds in your life I don't care if it's
[1:41:17] your father I don't care if it's your
[1:41:19] mother I don't care if it's the ministry

[1:41:25] hey
[1:41:37] can we say praise the Lord
[1:41:39] that's the time we in right now
[1:41:42] all Prophet says what's that true church

[1:41:54] spirit of God be able to

[1:42:10] invincible
[1:42:12] he says Satan won't be able to do
[1:42:14] nothing with him
[1:42:16] Hallelujah
[1:42:18] [Music]
[1:42:21] so as we walk on to know the Lord
[1:42:24] as we walk on to know the Lord
[1:42:27] we spend more time with him
[1:42:31] it changes us
[1:42:35] you realize the voice of God it got
[1:42:37] power right yeah
[1:42:41] the power of transformation
[1:42:44] how do you think you sitting here this
[1:42:46] morning
[1:43:09] this morning devils are being cast out
[1:43:13] the kingdom of Satan is being challenged
[1:43:15] by the spirit of God
[1:43:20] you understand that
[1:43:25] brother Brandon when he was in those
[1:43:27] services and he was in that spiritual
[1:43:30] realm he could see Devil's colors he
[1:43:34] could see him moving around because
[1:43:36] people were beginning to believe
[1:43:39] people were beginning to believe
[1:43:42] and evil spirits that were on certain
[1:43:45] people begin to cry out for help wow
[1:43:50] because they were being cast out
[1:43:52] they felt themselves getting weak they
[1:43:56] were losing their holes
[1:44:00] they understand what I'm saying and the
[1:44:03] prophet could see that
[1:44:06] what was happening God was getting the
[1:44:08] victory
[1:44:09] God is getting the victory this morning
[1:44:17] he's delivering his children
[1:44:32] God is changing your thoughts
[1:44:39] I'm gonna try to close I'm gonna end
[1:44:42] with this right here
[1:44:44] I'm gonna start with this all right tell
[1:44:46] me that like seven though
[1:44:50] God is having his ways
[1:44:54] see I didn't know that in the beginning
[1:44:55] of my journey when I first started
[1:44:58] ministering it was a gift that was there
[1:45:01] but that gift needed to be mature
[1:45:05] see when you first step off into you
[1:45:07] into God using you and your purpose
[1:45:11] you still have a lot of growing to do
[1:45:13] what's happening
[1:45:15] you understand what I'm saying God still
[1:45:18] gotta deal with you to a great degree do
[1:45:21] I do I covered
[1:45:24] to bring you the way you need to be
[1:45:28] um to where you can be more effective
[1:45:31] effective
[1:45:35] but the more effective you become May
[1:45:37] the proves effective good evening you
[1:45:38] know it's going to automatically come
[1:45:39] with that video
[1:45:48] you don't care about no attention
[1:45:51] you don't care about no reputations
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:45:59] when God is really in your heart
[1:46:02] everything is about him
[1:46:05] you will never point the people to
[1:46:07] yourself
[1:46:08] because you will know that you are
[1:46:11] nothing
[1:46:15] there's no there's no such thing as a
[1:46:17] good Ministry
[1:46:20] means down
[1:46:24] there's no no there's no such thing as a
[1:46:26] good preacher yeah
[1:46:30] all we're seeing is god
[1:46:33] making himself known
[1:46:36] through certain vessels
[1:46:39] that vessel ain't got nothing to do with
[1:46:42] it God survives there is no glory that
[1:46:45] goes to that vessel
[1:46:48] I'm trying to stop
[1:46:50] Jesus himself
[1:46:52] when he was in the flesh and he would do
[1:46:56] signs and wonders of America
[1:46:58] yeah you know what Jesus said
[1:47:01] he says see that you tell no man about
[1:47:03] it
[1:47:07] the Bible says he made himself of no
[1:47:09] reputation
[1:47:13] that's the almighty God
[1:47:15] veiled in flesh
[1:47:20] brother Brandon said what made him so
[1:47:22] great
[1:47:23] it's because he was able to make himself
[1:47:26] so small
[1:47:30] yeah
[1:47:33] I'm getting ready to close
[1:47:38] I'm just going to leave you with this
[1:47:39] the end of this quote right here
[1:47:42] he says get up in the woods somewhere
[1:47:45] foreign
[1:48:32] and you begin to lift up if you come on
[1:48:38] this is a real thing
[1:48:41] your prayer life our prayer lives
[1:48:44] can enter into this place
[1:48:47] to where we listen cause when you first
[1:48:49] go into prayer
[1:48:51] the devil don't want you to pray
[1:48:54] so you said you kneeling down trying to
[1:48:56] pray all kinds of thoughts come in your
[1:48:59] mind
[1:49:02] hmm
[1:49:04] the devil trying to get you to get up
[1:49:05] you have to say that was on living
[1:49:07] you're trying to get you distracted
[1:49:09] but brother Brandon said you stay there
[1:49:13] until every other voice is
[1:49:18] now you've entered into his presence
[1:49:21] he says then you begin to lift up
[1:49:24] he says it'll change it he says it'll
[1:49:29] make you different
[1:49:31] praise the Lord he says like it did this
[1:49:34] little Samuel somebody else
[1:49:36] he says it'll do something to you if
[1:49:39] you'll just do it
[1:49:42] he says now it'll make you what you
[1:49:45] should be
[1:49:47] it'll make you it'll make you the kind
[1:49:50] of Christian that you ought to be
[1:49:54] what is that that's a simple prayer life
[1:50:00] the Bible said that there's a song that
[1:50:02] says oh what peace we often forfeit okay
[1:50:07] we often forfeit
[1:50:10] we often give up news it says oh what
[1:50:14] needless pain we Bear
[1:50:16] Creek
[1:50:18] all because we do not care just the best
[1:50:23] Everything To God In Prayer
[1:50:27] but then once you get in prayer you
[1:50:30] gotta fight to get into his presence
[1:50:35] you just can't go and give up
[1:50:39] can we say praise the Lord praise the
[1:50:42] Lord
[1:50:43] you gotta fight and I'm Gonna Leave You
[1:50:47] with this
[1:50:49] when you have a chance conference go
[1:50:52] back and listen did this message
[1:50:55] hear his voice
[1:50:58] 1958
[1:51:01] October on another October
[1:51:05] when it comes to hearing God's voice
[1:51:10] did you he said you have to sit there
[1:51:14] every other voice because
[1:51:18] he said but when you get in the prayer
[1:51:20] God who's gonna take it out PM say
[1:51:22] what's on your heart these circuits but
[1:51:25] you can't be in a hurry
[1:51:30] he said because many times when we go
[1:51:33] pray
[1:51:35] he said we do all the Talking new news
[1:51:39] many people think that's what prayer is
[1:51:43] I got a lot of problems
[1:51:46] I got a lot of things
[1:51:51] it was that very least and you go and
[1:51:54] you pray and you begin to tell God your
[1:51:57] list
[1:51:58] released and once you feel like you
[1:52:00] don't told him everything you need to
[1:52:02] tell him
[1:52:04] then you say oh man no amen and you get
[1:52:08] up
[1:52:09] and you walk off but brother Branham
[1:52:13] we don't give God enough time
[1:52:17] to speak back spooky new powder
[1:52:21] kindergarten
[1:52:24] see for husband and wives poor Maria
[1:52:26] Farm whenever y'all were getting to know
[1:52:29] one another
[1:52:30] if the husband or the wife
[1:52:33] did all the talking
[1:52:35] to the power and then give you a chance
[1:52:38] to say nothing
[1:52:39] y'all wouldn't be together today
[1:52:44] when you talk to somebody
[1:52:45] you have to be interested enough
[1:52:49] to hear what they got to say back
[1:52:52] um
[1:52:56] I recently started to implement this in
[1:52:59] my life
[1:53:02] I did it this morning
[1:53:04] and as I was in prayer
[1:53:07] I prayed and I just kind of sat there
[1:53:10] let me know I wasn't in a hurry
[1:53:14] and after a while yeah
[1:53:17] additional scriptures begin to come to
[1:53:19] my mind
[1:53:56] because we need to hear his voice
[1:54:00] it's vital to our lives
[1:54:05] it can be it can mean life or death
[1:54:12] I'm gonna start right there
[1:54:14] I could say more but I'm gonna say yes
[1:54:17] but it's a matter of life and death see
[1:54:20] um
[1:54:21] don't play with it
[1:54:24] it's more important to you
[1:54:27] than what you may realize right now
[1:54:31] you must hear his voice
[1:54:37] [Music]
[1:54:39] you don't want to be led in a room
[1:54:42] you don't want anybody to come to you
[1:54:45] that you might look up to because
[1:54:48] that might be a true son and daughter of
[1:54:50] God
[1:54:52] but in a moment be led by a wrong Spirit
[1:54:57] tell you something
[1:55:00] that didn't come from God
[1:55:04] you want to be able to see that
[1:55:11] is
[1:55:16] can we say praise the Lord
[1:55:18] so you pray for me
[1:55:20] I'll be praying for you let us all Stand
[1:55:24] Together
[1:55:26] praise the Lord
[1:55:32] amen let's just bow our hearts sometimes
[1:55:38] Heavenly Father
[1:55:41] this is very important
[1:55:45] you're emphasizing it to my heart
[1:55:49] because you see my need for it that's
[1:55:52] what you've watched because you're busy
[1:55:53] they are truly many voices
[1:55:56] but you only have one voice
[1:55:59] and Lord is very needful I don't know
[1:56:03] that I hear that voice
[1:56:07] the Bible says when Elijah was in the
[1:56:10] cave
[1:56:12] he heard a strong wind come by you don't
[1:56:16] know
[1:56:17] and that wind knocked off pieces of the
[1:56:20] mountains
[1:56:23] but the Bible says that you were not in
[1:56:26] the wind
[1:56:29] the Bible says there was an earthquake
[1:56:31] that came live
[1:56:34] but Elijah wasn't moved by the
[1:56:36] earthquake
[1:56:40] he stayed in the cave
[1:56:43] laying down
[1:56:46] even though he felt the earthquake
[1:56:50] the Bible says that you were not in the
[1:56:52] earthquake
[1:56:54] then the Bible says there was a fire
[1:56:57] and even though Elijah knew that there
[1:57:00] was a fire
[1:57:02] he didn't feel to come out to see what
[1:57:05] was going on at that time
[1:57:08] and the Bible says
[1:57:14] but yet when that small steel voice came
[1:57:18] that voice he had become familiar with
[1:57:22] family then it caused the prophet to
[1:57:25] move I don't think of the prophets
[1:57:27] because he was able to recognize how you
[1:57:29] were speaking
[1:57:31] he was able to discern your your
[1:57:33] movement and your voice
[1:57:36] and he got up
[1:57:39] and he wrapped himself he said he said
[1:57:42] he said in his medal and he came out
[1:57:45] to hear what more you would say to him
[1:57:49] Lord he was in a beautiful place
[1:57:52] to where he was he was familiar with
[1:57:55] your voice
[1:57:57] father let us come into that place now
[1:58:00] Alaska news Lord you're already speaking
[1:58:03] to us
[1:58:04] but Lord you speak more than what we're
[1:58:07] able to hear
[1:58:08] father help us to hear your voice
[1:58:12] help us to follow your lead
[1:58:14] [Music]
[1:58:22] lord it's causing so many to turn away
[1:58:25] from the truth
[1:58:27] unto a lie
[1:58:31] Lord you calls me to read in your word
[1:58:33] this morning
[1:58:35] were Satan's ministers
[1:58:40] they change themselves to be Ministers
[1:58:43] of righteousness
[1:58:47] and they say it says that Satan himself
[1:58:53] transforms himself
[1:58:55] to appear as an angel of Light
[1:59:00] Lord how important is it for us to be
[1:59:04] led by your spirit
[1:59:07] so as your Bible says we will try every
[1:59:12] Spirit
[1:59:14] every Spirit
[1:59:16] to see whether or not
[1:59:21] and we can't do that without you
[1:59:24] so Lord may you help every one of us
