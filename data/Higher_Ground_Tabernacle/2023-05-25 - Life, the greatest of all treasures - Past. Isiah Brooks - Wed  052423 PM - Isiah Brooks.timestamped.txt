[53:29] moaning because of the oppression of the
[53:32] enemies
[53:41] let us pray our gracious father we come
[53:46] before you Lord as humbly as we know how
[53:48] this is
[53:49] thank you for being so good to us Lord
[53:53] you have been better to us we have been
[53:56] to ourselves
[53:58] there is nothing we can do other than to
[54:02] praise you okay
[54:05] for all that you do for us every moment
[54:09] of the day every hour of the day Lord
[54:13] you will always keep us Lord you have
[54:16] kept us in the shadows of your wings
[54:25] victory tonight
[54:27] in your name Jesus Christ we pray
[54:31] amen amen you may be seated
[54:36] amen we like to entitle this message
[54:42] the greatest of all Treasures
[54:51] the greatest of all Treasures
[54:57] and no doubt it will come to there have
[54:59] come many people to this Revelation
[55:02] without knowing what life is
[55:06] they have spent their lives
[55:09] uh you know gaining material
[55:12] wealthy populations
[55:16] Just Doing Great Things worldly things
[55:21] and every day you hear of some great
[55:24] stars
[55:32] and I often thinks did they know him
[55:38] boy did they come to know life I can't
[55:42] once until that Rebecca because what
[55:43] Satan has done with us
[55:46] third Dimensions he has come to make us
[55:50] think
[55:52] that this life because
[55:58] life was with the original
[56:02] Adam and Eve before they failure
[56:09] we began to experience what we know
[56:15] and when a baby is born
[56:18] the first moment he takes his breath
[56:22] he begins to die
[56:26] right that that's just using new we
[56:31] experience the Pains of death this is
[56:34] trying to cover it
[56:37] what we call life
[56:40] but this is not life
[56:43] hallelujah amen see let's say it like
[56:46] this this only comes to see if you take
[56:48] a seat and you put it in the ground
[56:53] so much once that seed die and rot to
[56:57] itself
[56:59] something takes place
[57:04] scientists don't know how to find
[57:06] zombies
[57:10] but it's in there but the only way that
[57:14] life can produce itself
[57:17] manifests itself
[57:19] that seed has to die and Rise
[57:24] it doesn't stay here
[57:28] it begins to move
[57:51] it is
[57:55] [Music]
[58:13] but that's not what happens to us
[58:16] as human beings
[58:20] [Applause]
[58:25] but the original life
[58:34] then if you if you if you keep yourself
[58:38] if you do not eat of the tree
[59:36] [Applause]
[59:38] you've got to go
[59:41] don't make no difference
[59:51] no one can stop it
[59:54] this is the truth this is what church is
[59:58] about
[59:59] Jesus Christ is about
[1:00:02] preparing people to live
[1:00:06] Hallelujah but the world died
[1:00:17] true life
[1:00:19] in Jesus Christ amen
[1:00:25] see we're living in a day
[1:00:28] where we don't have much time left on
[1:00:34] according to Genesis 6
[1:00:37] this world is repeating itself
[1:00:46] I mean it's everywhere
[1:00:48] you know all kinds of uh crazy things
[1:00:52] are happening to solve the shoes and
[1:00:56] everything is spinning out of control
[1:01:01] earthquakes
[1:01:04] everything falling apart
[1:01:07] my question is
[1:01:10] do you know life
[1:01:15] because what
[1:01:17] riches will do you particularly
[1:01:20] think about it all those wealthy people
[1:01:24] on the Titanic Deuces
[1:01:27] but their money couldn't save them
[1:01:30] they were playing all of the rock and
[1:01:33] roll and whatever jazz music
[1:01:40] that that boat was going to sing
[1:01:44] in history they began to sing I played
[1:01:47] Nearer My God
[1:02:10] [Applause]
[1:02:17] don't know
[1:02:22] who paid the price
[1:02:25] Hallelujah I did not say no of him I
[1:02:29] said you've got to know him
[1:02:31] Hallelujah
[1:02:35] now you can't tell me there's not a
[1:02:38] thirst in you
[1:02:41] everybody want more god dude
[1:02:47] seeking life they go to this church
[1:02:55] that saves you to solve her Jesus Christ
[1:03:02] he's the only one that can he says
[1:03:06] hallelujah if you get to heaven God is
[1:03:11] not going to ask you
[1:03:13] belong to tell you he's going to look
[1:03:17] for the blood tanks
[1:03:19] that's the way it was in Egypt
[1:03:23] he said when I see the blood
[1:03:29] Hallelujah see this woman at the well so
[1:03:32] he says she's a prostitute you know I I
[1:03:36] personally I love this story one of the
[1:03:40] stories that I love
[1:03:44] a woman but I was an infamy man
[1:03:50] I did my dirt yeah
[1:03:54] and I was just like her I was Ella
[1:03:59] swear
[1:04:01] you know what it means to be in bondage
[1:04:18] is
[1:05:05] that's the only way you're gonna get out
[1:05:09] and people think well if I run here and
[1:05:11] run there it is
[1:05:13] the part that I like them in the
[1:05:17] scripture because Jacob
[1:05:18] today was a well-known man
[1:05:22] yeah is that right
[1:05:24] a true servant of the Lord
[1:05:27] changed to Israel
[1:05:35] but you see it was a man-made whale
[1:05:39] and when Jesus came by
[1:05:42] that lady that the prostitution
[1:05:46] all that were in Samaria
[1:05:55] but the whales of all well
[1:05:59] Hallelujah was talking to her
[1:06:03] I can give you some water
[1:06:09] and you'll never thirst again
[1:06:18] Hallelujah he didn't say sip it
[1:06:23] he said drinking
[1:06:27] Hallelujah you know that's what people
[1:06:30] do this is they come to church and they
[1:06:32] sip even at least
[1:06:34] oh it was a good time
[1:06:37] [Music]
[1:06:39] no that's not gonna get you anywhere
[1:06:43] sometimes when I'm real thirsty
[1:06:47] like this
[1:06:49] and before I bring it back down it's
[1:06:51] almost empty yeah
[1:06:54] Hallelujah
[1:06:59] Hallelujah and listen when you search
[1:07:01] for something
[1:07:03] you don't find it to quench The Thirst
[1:07:11] Hallelujah according to the dictionary
[1:07:15] and one of the most powerful and natural
[1:07:18] appetites
[1:07:20] the craving for water or other drinks
[1:07:25] besides its natural significance on the
[1:07:28] other side
[1:07:30] is a figurative used of the strong
[1:07:35] spiritual desires figure
[1:08:09] being Workaholics
[1:08:19] [Music]
[1:08:20] amen amen that's nothing but the truth
[1:08:24] sometimes we have to mature to
[1:08:26] understand
[1:08:27] but that is nothing but the truth
[1:08:31] why I love this Psalms 42.
[1:08:42] that has been wounded
[1:08:45] by a hunter
[1:08:48] is bleeding
[1:08:52] and the deer knows that if he doesn't
[1:08:54] get to water
[1:08:57] he is more than likely will die
[1:09:01] so when a deer gets shot or wounded
[1:09:45] Hallelujah
[1:09:53] sometimes people try to satisfy we're
[1:09:55] just going to church
[1:09:58] we had a good time
[1:10:07] was more faithful to church
[1:10:10] and his religious sect is not as a
[1:10:14] sector who is used then perhaps most of
[1:10:16] us of all of us
[1:10:19] and Jesus still told him
[1:10:22] what you have scripture I'm not going to
[1:10:26] do
[1:10:27] you must be born again
[1:10:30] Hallelujah but the water the low end of
[1:10:34] the spirit
[1:10:36] hallelujah amen is that right that was
[1:10:39] Nicodemus
[1:10:42] at the top of the line Christians
[1:10:48] Jesus had something
[1:10:54] and eat people say all Nicodemus he came
[1:10:57] back
[1:11:02] hallelujah amen
[1:11:06] yes and did you know
[1:11:20] you know we thought Nicodemus walked
[1:11:22] away loud
[1:11:33] everybody want to live
[1:11:36] nobody wants to die
[1:11:39] you know talking like this people get
[1:11:41] all nervous conditions
[1:12:46] [Applause]
[1:12:51] a dog or a cat um
[1:12:58] four for its life
[1:13:03] oh yeah every
[1:13:06] area
[1:13:08] and if they can't fight
[1:13:13] [Laughter]
[1:13:16] but everybody wants to live
[1:13:20] I'll tell you what
[1:13:23] when we went down to Iowa Ohio excuse me
[1:13:27] Ohio I really ran to get a little bit of
[1:13:29] rest
[1:13:31] my wife we were went to uh Captain D's
[1:13:35] yeah
[1:13:36] Captain D's at the restaurant seller
[1:13:39] store and um we sat down to eat
[1:13:43] and there's
[1:13:45] a man in here and two women yeah that's
[1:13:49] his wife I don't know who the other lady
[1:13:50] was
[1:13:52] sat down
[1:13:54] God in my heart right here you see say
[1:13:58] you go testify to that man
[1:14:03] delivered you come on
[1:14:09] you know I'm like Lord is that you
[1:14:11] something else I didn't want to get up
[1:14:14] I mean excuse me he spoke to me
[1:14:18] and the third time
[1:14:34] do I know you know me
[1:14:36] I said you don't know it really I came
[1:14:39] to testify about Jesus so
[1:14:43] tell the lady
[1:14:51] and she said that's my husband he's
[1:14:54] fighting cancer right now
[1:15:00] if I pray for him
[1:15:07] I said don't they say well what what
[1:15:10] church you go to I said
[1:15:13] better I don't know
[1:15:17] God knows
[1:15:23] I said you gotta believe this is the
[1:15:27] chance
[1:15:43] that man believed so much
[1:15:45] he went to the restroom
[1:15:52] Hallelujah and when he came back
[1:15:55] she had a little uh look on his face
[1:16:00] explain to him
[1:16:07] I said sure a miracle happens
[1:16:10] instantaneously
[1:16:15] three days
[1:16:39] I may not ever see him again
[1:16:50] nobody could have done that
[1:16:52] I ask the Lord for forgiveness
[1:16:55] because I said that's
[1:17:57] silver
[1:18:15] amen hallelujah amen
[1:18:19] yes we
[1:18:21] it's so amazing
[1:18:25] because you know what
[1:18:27] our sister and I'm not gonna go ahead on
[1:18:29] with this but I know a sister and she is
[1:18:37] adamant when it comes to her
[1:18:40] Christianity
[1:18:44] she's actually uh people have said that
[1:18:47] about her
[1:18:48] and I thought to myself I used to weigh
[1:18:52] every Christian is supposed to be
[1:18:55] she's up in the hospital correcting the
[1:18:58] doctors
[1:19:07] at the end she says I don't have time to
[1:19:09] die
[1:19:14] but faith is what keeps us
[1:19:18] hallelujah God is good to us see one
[1:19:22] thing that Jesus said
[1:19:24] my word is life
[1:19:29] and that's the problem with most
[1:19:31] Christians
[1:19:34] they don't read the word
[1:19:39] if you read the word
[1:19:42] you'll find life in it
[1:19:48] what is life
[1:19:50] [Music]
[1:19:54] it's not something you can control
[1:20:02] as the prophet said tell me what life is
[1:20:06] and I'll tell you who God is
[1:20:10] huh T because without what we call life
[1:20:15] but because
[1:20:16] he existed is it like this thing what we
[1:20:20] call Life
[1:20:21] what he labored it to be
[1:20:25] it's what he passioned it to be
[1:20:29] right because he always was
[1:20:37] he was Elohim
[1:20:40] except existing ones
[1:20:42] every time we try to think about that
[1:20:45] dude
[1:20:54] because you can't go any further
[1:20:58] natural mind allows you to go
[1:21:03] she said Holiness we cannot even explain
[1:21:07] what it is
[1:21:11] because God is
[1:21:14] Holy son
[1:21:16] [Music]
[1:21:19] Hallelujah you know it's amazing
[1:21:22] a lot of people in the understanding
[1:21:25] they just think that um
[1:21:29] those uh seraphims and cherubimes
[1:21:33] they forever that's all they say they
[1:21:35] ain't got nothing else to say
[1:21:38] some old people the atmosphere that's
[1:21:42] was setting the atmosphere
[1:21:44] they're describing to you the atmosphere
[1:21:53] Hallelujah they don't know no other
[1:21:55] thing to say
[1:21:58] but you think that's all they do
[1:22:02] you know it's a possibility it's
[1:22:05] impossible but the point is they're
[1:22:07] trying to get you to understand
[1:22:21] it is God and it's going to take us
[1:22:25] eternity
[1:22:36] and he gives us the Holy Ghost
[1:22:39] and we still don't know what it is
[1:22:43] we just say something got a hold on me
[1:22:45] huh
[1:22:49] the Holy Ghost the sentence you say well
[1:22:51] what it is
[1:23:01] free he is alive
[1:23:05] Hallelujah that's why you know working
[1:23:08] in a system or a way of worship won't
[1:23:11] give you the Holy Ghost it gives you a
[1:23:25] [Music]
[1:23:43] as God
[1:24:15] that's the way it is Hallelujah
[1:24:21] [Music]
[1:24:32] [Applause]
[1:24:43] I'm sorry I meant to take these old fake
[1:24:45] things out
[1:24:47] but anyway I do the best I can listen
[1:24:50] man we're promised a new new life is
[1:24:54] promised
[1:24:56] can you imagine we must look at the day
[1:25:00] that Adam and Eve was
[1:25:30] Hallelujah and that blood sacrifice
[1:25:34] could not be a beast or an animal
[1:25:49] standing there as a man
[1:25:59] let me say that again
[1:26:02] Hallelujah
[1:26:17] you don't know
[1:26:28] if you believe on me
[1:26:38] [Applause]
[1:26:39] [Music]
[1:26:42] that woman said from though she was
[1:26:45] their faith
[1:26:47] he said give me that water Hallelujah
[1:26:50] [Applause]
[1:26:52] [Music]
[1:26:57] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:27:01] one thing about this water the reason
[1:27:03] why you don't thirsty
[1:27:10] he didn't say I'm a glass of water
[1:27:12] please
[1:27:28] [Laughter]
[1:27:31] oh my
[1:27:35] listen Equity as sure as there is a God
[1:27:39] in heaven
[1:27:41] I believe if I live true to him
[1:27:49] I'll be with all my loved ones
[1:27:52] for those who have gone on before me
[1:27:56] that's right so that's really the main
[1:27:59] thing
[1:28:00] after all that is
[1:28:15] [Music]

[1:42:01] months
[1:42:05] the air conditioning
[1:42:10] right I mean we we got it
[1:42:13] but that's why it's so hard for
[1:42:15] Americans

[1:42:21] savior
[1:42:34] oh yeah
