[Music] I am foreign [Music] [Music] all the beautiful beautiful [Music] holy mountains foreign [Music] together once again [Music] [Music] beautiful beautiful [Music] foreign of God I will always love that song every time I sing it I envisioned my mom that was her first that was her love song said in that Baptist Church but to sing that from the depths of her heart I came to love it still love it and you know for some reason every time I sing that song I see the Bride of crying into heaven God is good to us we thank God for his goodness and his grace without him we would be nothing yeah appreciate everybody who's come out to the house of God yes Lord amen you may be seated for just a moment some of you may not even know what I'm about to say or you may not have heard but there was a lot of rumors and things going on yeah among the Believers concerning uh brother Daniel yeah so I want to say this is every one of you this morning stop it now both of them and myself met the other day everything was cleared the um they both made right with it they both uh left out in peace and so did I yeah so I want to say this by the grace of God [Music] how can I say it um things will happen the show's wrong today you can't stop the enemy we all are flesh but one thing God commanded us to do I love one another and the Bible says this one of the disciples asked Jesus how often should we forgive our brothers and Jesus says no no seven times seventy um every time someone make a mistake yes you have to forgive them and the Bride of Jesus Christ knows how to forgive [Music] so I want to say to those who have been uh spreading the fire have Sanctified ears don't let nobody trust you when somebody bring garbage to you you tell them to keep that garbage y'all understand what I'm saying uh if we're going to move toward Perfection we must learn how to Bridle our tongues when things are come your way and you don't understand it join in with it is that right Satan is the midst of is in the midst of all confusion and whenever is broken it'll always bring chaos and the only reason why I'm saying what I'm saying it's because neither other brothers are here to say it but but it's going to say what he needs to say in in Des Moines excuse me I I was sitting Iowa City and I was and brother Danny is in Iowa City Iowa City and they're worshiping together so let's go on with God and for those of you who don't know you don't need to know that's just the way it goes don't tell nobody nothing is dead from this moment on if something else should pop up but not as nicely as we are handling it now [Music] this is a yeah you'll see God in action you know people we love each other it's it's human you're human you're going to make mistakes you're going to say things that you shouldn't saying we allow our emotions to get in is I'm not going in detail but I heard things that were blatantly lies and I was in the midst of it so I should know whether it was a lie or true nonsense this is nonsense anyway you love me well like I say all the time if you don't love me you won't make the Rapture because not only do are you supposed to love your brothers but you're supposed to love your enemy too so you got nowhere to run you love the Lord that's what the difference in the message is now in denominations we we were motivated by law offices since the head stone is we come into Grace [Music] when someone does do wrong unto you foreign laughs oh God is so good to me I don't know whether he's that good to you but he's good very very good I can't even tell you how good God is to me we're coming from second chronicles second chronicles the 15th chapter we're going to begin at the first verse we have a long reading but uh be patient with us beginning at the first verse and the spirit of God Came Upon Azariah the son of obedience and he went out to meet ASA and said unto him here ye me ASA and all Judah and Benjamin the Lord is with you while ye be with him and if you seek Him He will be found of you but if you forsake Him He will forsake you yes [Music] now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God and without a teaching priest and without law well but when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord God of Israel and sought him he was found of them may Los Angeles and in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor him that came in but great vexation vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the country security I'm going to read that fifth verse again to pay attention to it and in those times there was no peace to him that went out no door to him that came in but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries and Nations was destroyed of Nations and city of cities for God did vexed them with all adversity be strong therefore and let not your hands be weak for your work shall be rewarded and when Acer heard these words and the prophecy of Obed the prophet he took courage and put away the Abominable Idols of all the land of Judah and Benjamin and out of the city which he had taken from Mount Ephraim and renewed the altar of the Lord that was before the porch of the Lord [Music] even in this time we see by God's grace there was a cleaning of the house and and we understand when it goes on to say and he renewed the altar of the Lord Prayer was reinstituted [Music] something yeah and he gathered all Judah and Benjamin and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and manessa and out of Simeon for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance and when they saw the Lord his God was with him oh is amen amen what it caused well it was a it was a a Revival started people began to do something about their conditions [Music] so they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month in the 15th year of the reign of Asa is and they offered unto the Lord the same time of the spoils which they had brought 700 oxen and seven thousand sheep is and they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with their heart and with all their souls [Music] that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death whether small or great where the man or woman for those of us who truly understand the message even though this is in the Old Testament referring to us in the sense that God wants us to seek us seek him with all our hearts will put us to death and they swear unto the Lord with a loud voice 14 first and they swear unto the Lord with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with coronets [Music] and all Judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found of them you hear me and the lord gave them rest round about [Music] it is [Music] and also concerning Marca the mother of Asa the king he removed her from being Queen because she had made an idol in a Grove and ASA cut down their Idol and stamped it and burned it at the brook key drawn [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] foreign and and that Spirit has become your idols may God help us this morning but the high places were not taken away out of Israel nevertheless the heart of Asia was perfect in all his ways [Music] let us pray father God we come before you we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for all that you do have done Lord we pray this morning perfect and divine will be done here this morning for who he really is we ask oh God perfect in the Divine will happen Lord give me the grace the word of God will be known for you amen amen you may be seated the scripture here Amen in second chronicles it it really uh stirred me because what I saw uh was the uh father the uh the Holy Spirit taking a people that was totally backslidden and Reviving their souls you know when we think about Judah and Benjamin Judah means praise everybody knows and and Benjamin means the son of the right when studying this I saw not only uh the Bride of Jesus from Israel too Israel now the word means the help help so we know by God's grace that God is trying to get us a a picture here it is his name has a purpose take these characters [Applause] one of the things that Judah and Benjamin was a guilty of and then the souls they have become worldly long season they had seen a move of God hallelujah so when it came into that place What God Says in Chronicles they which are called by my names [Applause] I will hear from heaven and forgive their sins she turned from their Wicked Ways he said the Bride of Jesus Christ the sickest of all people I'm talking naturally alone spiritually and the worst thing about being sick and you don't know and people go a long time it becomes terminal and we don't want no terminal here we want to get it while it's there somebody the other day you know infections know how to hide they'll hide in the body the body begins to fight back on the surface so when when things happen and they began things began to surface because now you know there's something working bad in the body a place where you can fix it is that right disagreements is not bad and that's where we're here today we're here to fix it actions will help you today the Bible says that but whenever Israel would turn whenever they would seek him he would always answer foreign [Music] who ever thank God for the grace now I never said my subject the subject tonight [Music] [Applause] that happened even at my own house it had not my wife mode [Music] Hallelujah but it took something and before I knew it yeah I had a change positions I was once standing back uh I was moving forward yes and I'm thinking Lord I need more work y'all better hear what I'm saying I don't want to be like Peter when your pressure comes y'all hear what I'm saying because you fight with the swords I'm going on now where I was in the scripture because uh remember Judah means praise it means a worshiper or servant of God you see all these connections because they were blood related um about the Lamb of God somebody said me a little thing that did this morning the poison has an effect but because of the uh whatever that is in that Lamb's blood yeah y'all hear what I'm saying so what I'm saying is the blood of Jesus you might get bitten but the serpent bite can't can't kill you the blood of resist the Venom of the bike [Music] no matter what Satan [Music] because your names were written you can stop the Bride of Jesus oh I've been cast down yeah but not destroyed and so let me say it like this so you could better understand because you have failures doesn't mean it's done father you understand me the Bible says it like this a just man falls seven times in a day foreign [Music] Hallelujah let me move on by the grace of God now we we understand the spirit of marker is to press you down see that's why the Bible says lift up your head Hallelujah hey no no time right now to be looking down sorry for yourself when God said clap your hands right let's move on by the grace of God but the thing that got my caught my attention more than anything they made a covenant and I trust this morning you wouldn't make a covenant they made a covenant that they would [Music] you are going to miss it man you see what I'm saying so this message has come to us give us a vision that we must see the time that we're living in [Applause] and the word ASA means doctor it means he a lot so when brother Branham came he was under the inspiration of ASAP he came to heal Hallelujah he's the doctor he was the one that God used to diagnose our case [Music] recognize the conditions because they rejected the doctor but when he was here is that right amen oh may God help us this morning because you you know how I am I can't stand uh systematic worship the revelation of God strikes Hallelujah I believe there's anybody in the world full of joy it should be the bride of Christ no matter what comes our way y'all better hear what I'm saying the Holy Ghost brother Branham didn't take the joy away he didn't take the dancing away don't you take the shouting or something brother Adam said in 67th paragraph foreign [Music] uh about who when you marry this certain woman you are one then that's not the way you are with Christ and together if that's what's in your hands your heart when we talk about the Statue of a perfect man [Music] you and I must realize this Faith virtue knowledge into the very image and likeness of foreign you'll recognize who he is hallelujah you make no excuses for the flesh you've got even if I'm if it's me Lord man standing in the need of practice [Music] the one who makes the decision [Music] Hallelujah come back to where it started the bride and the bridegrooms in the same garments that's one thing I love about the Congolese weddings y'all make it look good now because in the wedding you don't have to think they have something similar yeah just the way it is when she was a a period before the king the Garment that that the king gave her [Music] the kind of thing is oh my God the Bride Comes Down Over Heaven is that right according to the Book of Revelation Bride Comes Down Out of Heaven Jerusalem comes down out of here the glory of God hallelujah amen just the other day I'll say the other day it's been a couple of weeks they failed to write it all down but I was dreaming and it was in the evening time or so after lunch or whatever time that you want to find a little nap and I saw the the the the pyramid and in this pyramid I I saw those colors rainbow but they were doing it they were living and as they moved they were blending uh blending a blending the best way I can describe describe characteristics and when I came out of the dream something said the blending of these Natures there's only one character right so it's not seven gods or seven angels it's literally the very nature of God broken down in his Simplicity somewhat what God is like because the natural man cannot comprehend God broke it down Hallelujah is that right and the Bible says if these Natures these characters really seducing a lot of people [Music] I ask you nothing about God will not ask you somebody else he's going to ask you about you well Lord Brothers you know what Jesus is going to say to be a lamb means to fall before your sheer or dumb this is he's the lamb foreign [Music] foreign in this message that's right even I'm telling you the truth you're wasting your time what you gonna do when you pull up with some kind of uh uh uh thing against a brother or sister died he's gonna go all the way back in your life before you were ever convert it and he's gonna pull all that stuff up the word is remember when that servant and the big boss says what you did was it not I forgave you of all your sins Hallelujah things that happened to you years ago [Music] and you'll never get the true Holy Ghost Hallelujah until you will leave to let ASA work on you until you let the doctor work on you until you get to the place that you gotta re you you're returning Lord Jesus Christ and every time you break that order it can't end up no other way you did a great job amen huh see God put things in our lives that would drive us out of our comfort zones oh every time you think you comfortable here he will shake you he was shaking an earthquake comes if your city is not built on Iraq y'all hear what I'm saying but God will always bring things in your life when you feel like you're he don't want you you know to be around is a soldier that have that is overconfident um you think you got it all together but I don't want to hang with you because your Pride's gonna get me killed thank you I need somebody going to have a little nervousness about it no no names are good it makes sense you know what I'm saying it makes you sensitive the things around you right when you walk in somewhere shut down you you're in trouble walking into Chicago like you you're gonna you're gonna you know you you the man you better put something on You You Better Be watchful and you better have to watch something in every direction y'all hear what I'm saying you can go in there like oh you know luck if you want to show you I heard somebody said they was they were interested I shouldn't say that it's in the way of a joke I better not do that but anyway it's right over there but you got to be careful [Music] so when God brings you to that place now I'm talking about it people okay I'll say it like this is not easy to die to sell because you got to do it every day every day two Satan is there waiting right he's already there how many y'all wait to try to push something something else on your mind other than prayer Hallelujah now I don't know desperation this message call supposed to be desperate one of us can make ourselves desperate sometimes we go down to prayer we want to feel him and you you get down there and it feels like he's not even there by those feelings right he's in you you may not even feel him but God always hear your prayers but you can hear me you understand me [Music] yes [Applause] and we use prayer huh I'm almost I'm almost done talk about desperation Hannah could not have a baby and she needed a son yeah and she went into desperation oh I'm gonna go in desperation [Applause] the desperation was given to her by Grace because God had a purpose in her teeth sometimes we don't even understand [Music] that's the grace and love of God hallelujah and she sought the Lord God and she suffered ridicule people said well you ain't got to pray like that [Music] than to suffer patience like I said the other day God is something else he can take a little toy and work that toy trying your patience that little kid is on the floor and your patience is running out y'all hear what I'm saying and God you don't even know God looking at it every moment I'm gonna let this noise get louder right y'all know what I'm saying and if you're not careful you want to throw the kid and the toy this way y'all looking at me like I'm crazy because you know what y'all know I'm real you know I'm real so she she and if you don't do that that's what happened yeah your voice and you don't even realize God is working with you and everything that comes your way mm-hmm how many of y'all and I I'm gonna I'm just I've got some things here but man you talk about pressure and most of us will never know the kind of pressure and Tamar wanted a son that represented us without the Holy Ghost and that's the way we are to think about it and if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're desperate um how you gonna get desperate come on brother just told me a testimony I don't want to do but the young brother I don't want to steal his Thunder but but one Young Brother basically I'm not asking you for healing but is it so hard that you can't give me the holy God right when we know God is more willing to give you the holy ghosts [Music] and the Holy Ghost came to this brother came up y'all hear me God will do it whenever he wants to do it somehow you got to say the right words amen amen right the message is supposed to be seen Jesus didn't say oh I'm the Messiah when did Brother Branham and how long he was a prophet everything that God did to him [Music] and the Bible says they'll know my disciples because of the love you have one for another reason it might be simple everybody is entitled The Believer um to receive all that is promised to see you before this day all the blessings and you don't even have to work for it somebody help me here you don't have to work for it is [Music] all things are possible [Applause] but what he wants to see messages Emma amen oh come on somebody he wants to see himself that message that we praise brother Branham live in US can you do it no no you cannot uh the Life of Christ that's what we must do you must say Lord that life Hallelujah like in the days of Noah the altar had to be restored is that right as in the Days of Elijah had to be restored sacrifice had to be restored the word of the Lord had to be restored by a prophet [Music] the word must be restored in you first and when it's restored but we shackle ourselves because of the laws and traditions Satan condemns us and he condemns us because we fail to see the sacrifice that's it amen yeah we like feeling condemned so they say we're not Catholic but we like to that that Kenton statements you know you people how you do oh I did wrong you know what I'm saying you go through all those changes and you think God's happy with it usually [Music] y'all hear what I'm saying you fall down you do you're crying somebody got a little scratch on them look at my name I don't want to see it but you should have been there where I feel no I shouldn't have said [Music] I don't care what comes my mouth now you hear people killing folks because it's the right sauce on that McDonald's burger now we laughing but that's true oh they didn't give me enough ketchup they go in and they kill people but people have been doing crazy stuff like that suicide ourselves foreign repeat Hallelujah think about it the whole church that they will seek the Lord with all their hearts also made in that Covenant somebody that was not seeking God they would be killed brother random basically came and told us all right [Music] we're gonna get the first verse and it shall come to pass first verse 28 uh Deuteronomy yeah and it should come to pass if thou shall hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his Commandments which I command thee this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the Earth [Music] in all these blessings shall come on deep and overtake thee if thou shall hearken unto the voice of the Lord I like the idea of blessings overtaking me if thou shall Hawken into the voice of the Lord thy God foreign [Music] the Lord you don't answer your calls thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face amen that they shall come out against thee one way and free before these seven ways yes [Music] Hallelujah the Lord shall call thy enemy the Lord thy face they should come out against thee one way before these seven ways to our house and he shall bless thee in the land and as long as you stay in your land the Lord shall establish thee and holy people unto himself you know one day if you know if I really believe that we could do a week of teachings [Music] but I don't I don't I don't want to waste my time in my effort if no one is going to show up so anyway when you make up your mind you want to do such a thing Ephesians beginning at the first verse Paul the Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus every word you must take as your your own it's a personal letter letter to you and peace blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ beings [Music] that is why Satan tries to keep you from being in Christ oh Heavenly blessings spiritual blessings it's given to you hallelujah amen according that he has chosen Us in him fourth verse according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to him according to the good pleasure of his will soon whether you realize it or not justified how you said our our security not for security once they've always saved I can't think of it took my mind but what a lot of people don't understand but if you truly is the bride of Christ you can't become unsafe why because predestinations y'all hear what I'm saying before you got here God had already saved you is that right in the mind of God foreign [Laughter] the food brother said that shows you don't have it having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will soon the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he have made us accepted in the Beloved that's why the devil don't want you with the Holy Ghost we don't care if you got the Holy Ghost on your spirits on your flesh the Holy Ghost in that secret place once he reach there it's
