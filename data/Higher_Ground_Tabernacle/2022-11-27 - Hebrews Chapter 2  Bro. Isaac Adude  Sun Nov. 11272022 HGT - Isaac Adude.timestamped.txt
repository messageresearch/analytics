[30:06] done for us
[30:09] to just express our feelings
[30:14] we meant to express her to tell them how
[30:16] we love him

[30:35] Lord thank you Father for everything

[30:43] that we have heard
[30:45] thank you Father God for being there
[30:48] among us foreign
[30:53] [Music]
[30:55] Lord we just pray father God that you
[30:58] call my Lord Jesus
[31:03] Glory that you teach this word to us
[31:07] Lord and you explain it to us the Lord
[31:11] we thank you Father Lord Praise Your
[31:14] Name Lord we lift you up
[31:17] but we give you all the glory
[31:20] because you are worthy to be praised
[31:24] in Jesus Christ
[31:27] [Music]
[31:28] amen he met this morning we'll open our
[31:33] Bibles in the book of Hebrews
[31:43] Hebrews chapter 2 it was
[31:46] when we read from verse 1 to verse 4.
[31:53] amen when I was doing my Bible study
[31:55] just getting ready for the service my
[31:58] hookers verses
[32:00] amen I tried to find a way out to title
[32:03] my sermon this morning but I couldn't
[32:04] find a way because subsided to do most
[32:07] of them
[32:08] so we'll be we'll be talking about the
[32:11] book of Hebrews chapter 2.
[32:14] from
[32:23] by the grace of God will go from verse 1
[32:26] to verse 18 which is throughout the
[32:28] service center but against all
[32:31] um
[32:36] show how you know what Paul was
[32:39] expressing not only about it this girl
[32:41] it's
[32:42] I mean let's read uh Hebrews chapter 2
[32:45] verse 1 to verse 4.
[32:49] when the Bible says therefore we ought
[32:53] to give the more Earnest Heat to the
[32:55] things which we have heard let's say any
[32:59] time we should let them sleep the man
[33:06] is
[33:09] for if the word spoken by Angels was
[33:13] steadfast and every transpiration and
[33:16] Disobedience received they're just
[33:18] recompense of reward
[33:25] foreign
[33:29] how shall we escape
[33:32] if we neglect so create salvation which
[33:35] at first began to be spoken by the Lord
[33:38] and was confirmed unto us by them that
[33:41] hurt him amen
[33:50] verse 4 God also bearing them weakness
[33:54] both with signs and wonders and with
[33:57] diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy
[34:01] Ghost according to his own will because
[34:17] Paul says therefore we ought to give the
[34:20] more Earnest Heat to the things which we
[34:22] have heard less at any time you should
[34:25] let them
[34:28] sleeps
[34:33] for if the word spoken by angels
[34:42] it's not
[34:44] Angels here it means all the profits you
[34:48] see the results
[34:49] amen because uh if you go to the first
[34:53] chapter of of Hebrews the first verse
[34:56] you will see how Paul was explaining it
[34:57] for me um
[35:02] and he says therefore if the word spoken
[35:05] by Angels or prophets was steadfast
[35:11] and every transpiration and Disobedience
[35:14] received are just recompense of the
[35:17] world
[35:24] and let's uh bow our heads again
[35:29] father God again will come before
[35:32] Eternal Grace
[35:34] Lord we just ask you father God to come
[35:37] and help us
[35:39] Lord I pray for the Lord that you help
[35:41] me to be so sensible to the holy spirit
[35:45] so that could say exactly and only what
[35:48] you want me to say this is
[35:50] Lord we have read your word
[35:53] Lord we pray father God that you come
[35:55] and teach it to yourself
[35:58] in Jesus Christ
[36:02] and but this morning as I said we'll be
[36:05] talking about Hebrews chapter 2.
[36:09] it might work all through the entire
[36:11] chapter and we see wherever God will
[36:13] lead us
[36:17] amen because if you read all the books
[36:21] of Hebrews
[36:23] yeah but you'll understand that Paul was
[36:26] there is one thing about Paul that he
[36:28] was exalting Jesus Christ
[36:31] all an example from Hebrews chapter 1 to
[36:35] the last chapter I forget what chapter
[36:37] it is
[36:41] exalting Jesus he was talking about
[36:43] Jesus
[36:45] I mean he was talking about how Jesus
[36:48] died on the cross for us
[36:51] he was talking about how Jesus became a
[36:54] high priest
[36:58] he talked about so many things about
[37:00] Jesus and so many interesting if you
[37:03] have time just go and do a study on
[37:06] these books it shows those interests you
[37:09] see
[38:21] boats and and and planes and stuff like
[38:24] that is
[38:28] we'll find out on our own way out
[38:33] but no I received a clear message from
[38:36] the Lord
[38:39] there is no other way out
[38:43] there is
[38:46] amen and that was to go into the ark
[38:50] the only way for you to be saved was to
[38:53] go into that Ark the soulmate
[38:57] but as the Bible tells us that they
[39:00] didn't go they didn't uh receive what
[39:02] Noah told them
[39:06] so all of them perished
[39:08] amen we see the same thing with Moses
[39:13] reality obey God and and to do exactly
[39:17] what God told them to do that
[39:22] of Israel about that great land about
[39:25] the promise of the that God gave to
[39:27] Abraham
[39:29] Israel
[39:32] the children of Israel about that that
[39:35] lane that that with milk and honey
[39:41] amen even sent spies and they went to
[39:44] spy on the country and they came back
[39:46] with the fruits
[39:51] they came back with testimony saying
[39:53] that God is truly I mean what God Said
[39:55] is is right and it's truth and and these
[39:58] are the fruits
[40:02] but yet instead of serving God that's
[40:05] the only true God that wanted to serve
[40:08] an
[40:09] Idols
[40:12] amen they rejected everything Moses tell
[40:15] them
[40:16] even though they saw all the Miracles
[40:19] they're so bread coming down from heaven
[40:21] says
[40:24] there's some meat coming down from
[40:26] heaven
[40:28] this year there's so water coming coming
[40:31] out of the of a rocket
[40:34] they sell all those impossible things
[40:37] that a human a human mind couldn't
[40:40] comprehend but but still they rejected
[40:42] that word
[40:48] they walked in the desert for I don't I
[40:50] don't remember how many years and and
[40:52] still their clothes were not destroyed
[40:54] his own his own mind
[40:59] they were seeing Miracles every day
[41:03] they had experiences with the Lord every
[41:06] day of their lives
[41:10] amen they were receiving cooked bread
[41:12] from Heaven every day
[41:18] but still instead of believing what
[41:21] Moses was telling them
[41:22] even instead of trusting the Lord
[41:26] they wanted to build their own Idol his
[41:29] own preference amen they wanted to go
[41:32] back to Egypt
[41:34] so all those old people and and parents
[41:37] of that time they all missed the line
[41:40] they didn't go in
[41:42] um
[41:43] that's what Paul here is telling us in
[41:45] verse 1.
[41:47] it says that we are to give the more
[41:50] Earnest here to the things which we have
[41:52] heard
[41:56] Lester at any time we should let them
[41:59] sleep
[42:02] amen verse 2 he says that for if the
[42:05] word spoken by Angels was steadfast
[42:11] amen and every transgression and
[42:14] Disobedience received a just recompense
[42:17] of reward
[42:20] amen the angel the word that was spoken
[42:24] by the prophets were steadfast
[42:27] it
[42:29] amen the words that were spoken by the
[42:32] Angels they were true that
[42:37] amen all those prophecies that came to
[42:40] pass
[42:41] and everyone who neglected those
[42:45] prophecies and those warnings
[42:48] amen they all perished
[42:50] amen they all were punished
[42:53] amen they all received amen amen
[42:56] according to their actions
[42:59] amen because because the Bible says that
[43:02] that God puts a Watchman on top of the
[43:06] tower
[43:09] plus
[43:10] [Music]
[43:12] amen amen he's there to see and to watch
[43:15] over to see if there's a danger coming
[43:17] to warn the people inside of the city
[43:22] amen and this watch means amen there are
[43:25] prophets and and and Servants of God
[43:28] Amen God places them there to see the
[43:30] the oncoming danger is it said something
[43:33] else
[43:36] to warn us about the things that are
[43:39] coming
[43:41] to warn us about the destructions that
[43:43] are coming
[43:45] you see that if you read the Bible will
[43:47] tell you that those who will hear those
[43:50] warnings and Truth to neglect it and
[43:52] obviously
[43:54] this is
[44:12] so it's up to you now to take it to to
[44:16] take that word and and apply it I see a
[44:19] woman
[44:20] it's now your job to take that word and
[44:24] live by
[44:25] itself
[44:27] she used to reject the word
[44:31] even your blood will be on yourself
[44:34] amen you won't be there blaming God for
[44:37] not saving you or for doing something
[44:39] wrong
[44:42] amen because God gave you the word of
[44:44] Grace
[44:46] I will give you the warning of Grace and
[44:49] you chose to refuse it
[44:51] is
[44:54] the prophet says that Grace is Grace
[44:56] when it is received as Grace
[45:31] am I talking about the the the the the
[45:33] the age and how people are being
[45:36] multiplied and and how all the
[45:38] Prophecies of the Bible are being
[45:39] fulfilled but alone
[45:45] telling us that it's a time to check our
[45:49] lamps
[45:53] it's a time to make sure that we do have
[45:56] the oil
[45:59] imagine
[46:59] make sure that he was serving the true
[47:01] God
[47:03] when he came back he started telling his
[47:06] church that we've been wrong we've been
[47:08] doing things the wrong way
[47:18] we have to follow them
[47:21] we have to live like them
[47:24] they have the true love is
[47:27] they serve the Living God
[47:31] he had that experience
[47:36] amen and every one of us have to have
[47:39] that experience
[47:41] the prophet says that that experience of
[47:44] the back of the desert
[47:46] experience
[47:48] how you met God and when and where
[47:52] Edgars
[47:57] who you were before and what you were
[48:00] doing before
[48:03] now you're a complete new man amen
[48:08] he has placed all those Watchmen to take
[48:11] care to uh uh warn us about the the
[48:14] dangerous
[48:17] amen he says the profit says that Israel
[48:19] had to uh in the in the message the
[48:22] uniting time and sign uh paragraph 59.
[48:29] he said that Israel had to turn down the
[48:32] message first
[48:35] and when they turned down the message
[48:40] the National Life United itself together
[48:44] other nations look
[48:55] and today they have turned down the
[48:58] message of the Lord Jesus
[49:01] and they have turned it down and now the
[49:05] time has come to where communism is
[49:08] uniting the world together against the
[49:10] church
[49:16] see it has to be that way
[49:19] now it's hard to say that
[49:23] they had first to reject that message
[49:26] they have first to reject that warning
[49:30] that's exactly that's the same thing
[49:32] that people are doing today is it a
[49:35] mentioned amen people are rejecting the
[49:38] message
[49:39] amen people are rejecting the warnings
[49:42] amen people are choosing what to hear
[49:46] amen people are choosing what kind of
[49:48] message they want to hear
[49:51] amen if you bring the message of
[49:53] repentance they will say we passed that
[49:55] age and we're no longer there is
[50:00] preach about the Holy Spirit they'll
[50:02] tell you we need some meats and we need
[50:04] some grown-up stuff

[50:18] and that's when destruction comes
[50:22] amen and when you start to reject the
[50:24] message
[50:33] and they all perished amen we have the
[50:37] entire Old Testament to tell us about
[50:39] these stories
[50:41] that every time the message of warning
[50:44] was rejected
[50:47] even these people had to pay for it
[50:50] because you will see today people are
[50:53] concerned about other stuff
[50:56] please
[51:00] that is coming up and listening
[51:05] about the new movies are about to be
[51:07] produced
[51:10] people are concerned about what's the
[51:13] next show what's the next game
[51:16] and they are neglecting the very same
[51:19] thing that can save them
[51:23] they are more concerned about worldly
[51:26] stuff
[51:28] they spend their entire week about you
[51:31] know on these things
[51:35] and not having time for God
[51:38] not having time to open their Bible and
[51:41] read it
[51:43] not having time to listen to the message
[52:41] amen if you see someone who only speaks
[52:44] about the word
[52:47] his friends will say well this man is
[52:49] boring
[52:50] that is everything that he talks about
[52:53] it and then he only talks about God and
[52:56] only talks about the word
[52:59] amen but in that first church
[53:05] that was the same that was exactly what
[53:08] they were talking about
[53:10] amen people were talking about God from
[53:13] morning to night

[53:32] brought it together the money and they
[53:34] live in the in that same place that
[53:36] communion in life

[1:42:08] by he broke the veil
[1:42:13] he opened up the way
[1:42:16] he broke the veil of sickness
[1:42:20] he broke the veil of sin is
[1:42:24] he broke the veil of weary
[1:42:28] and he broke the veil of depressed
[1:42:33] he broke everywhere
[1:42:36] and made the highway
[1:42:40] for the wayfaring man
[1:42:44] walking up the King's Highway
[1:42:48] amen he had to do it for you and me
[1:42:52] Amen to give you
[1:42:55] the the that first uh that priority
[1:43:01] they meant to open up that line of
[1:43:04] Prayer
[1:43:05] in Minnesota When you pray because
[1:43:12] that's why you had to break that Veil
[1:43:15] that's why he had to break that shadow
[1:43:18] of death of Darkness of death that was
[1:43:20] hanging over in the atmosphere
[1:43:28] you can directly go to him
[1:43:31] instead of When you pray God will hear
[1:43:33] it and God will give you what you need
[1:43:41] that's why Paul was trying to explain
[1:43:43] the Hebrews this is
[1:43:46] that you no longer abide on the law
[1:43:50] amen but he was introducing Grace to
[1:43:53] them
[1:43:55] yes this is the grace
[1:43:58] Jesus died for you
[1:44:00] amen this is the grace
[1:44:03] Jesus took your place
[1:44:05] amen this is the grace for us
[1:44:08] Jesus died for every one of us Jesus
[1:44:12] took our place
[1:44:17] amen he suffered all these things
[1:44:26] Amen to give us the power to overcome
[1:44:28] death
[1:44:31] I mean he had to be sick
[1:44:34] to give us the power to be healed
[1:44:38] and then he had to become sin
[1:44:41] Amen to give us the power to be safe
[1:44:45] amen the Grace has been given to us
[1:44:48] amen we have to take it as Grace
[1:44:52] because there is a prophet says that
[1:44:54] Grace is Grace
[1:45:15] sin just go to God and open up your
[1:45:18] heart and confess so you sin you have
[1:45:20] the Forgiveness
[1:45:26] you may know that that Grace is not an
[1:45:29] eternal thing
[1:45:31] amen because that Grace when it is
[1:45:33] rejected
[1:45:35] when he becomes a judgment
[1:45:38] will be judged but the same word that we
[1:45:41] are reading right now
[1:45:46] people will be judged by this book
[1:45:50] amen the same book that brings us Grace
[1:45:55] image of same book brings judgment to
[1:45:58] others
[1:46:00] so you have to be on the right side
[1:46:04] where the grace of God is
[1:46:07] supposed to take you have to claim that
[1:46:10] Grace
[1:46:11] amen God bless you can come
