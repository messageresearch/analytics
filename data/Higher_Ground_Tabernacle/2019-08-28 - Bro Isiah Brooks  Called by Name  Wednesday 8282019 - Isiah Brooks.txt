God is good to us thank him for its goodness appreciate our musicians I try my best to move out of the way so God could speak to us tonight while we're standing you guys have to sing this song but I want to ask if you would turn with us to jeremiah 15 jeremiah 15 chapter we're gonna read the sixteenth verse there and then we'll read revelations the TIMP chapter beginning at the ninth verse revelation 6:15 to Jeremiah 15 will read the 16th and the 17th verses of Jeremiah love the Lord surely God is good to us in words cannot express our gratitude especially in this day and time I trust that we are all seeing alike we realize we don't have much time and we understand that it is a matter of life and death we have come along for years being church members church groups church societies but now God is requiring something that I think a lot of people have missed out on it's not something new God has always required the token from Genesis to Revelation the blood of Jesus Christ must and have to be applied to each and every individual it is only it is God's only way of escape he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you Jeremiah 15:16 it reads thy words were found and I did eat them and that words was in unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart for I am called by thy name o Lord God of hosts revelations please will come from the temp chapter of revelations and I trust that God would give us the grace to get in what he would have us to have tonight revelations 10 beginning at the ninth verse and I went unto the angel and I said unto him give me the little book and he said it to me take it eat it up and it shall make that belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I did eat it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people and nations and tongues and kings let us pray father we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us father you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves and I pray Lord God tonight that you would visit us Lord in a special way we we humble ourselves before you Lord there's nothing within ourselves that we can glorify but we come to glorify you and your name Holy Spirit cleanse us from all our unrighteousness and forgive us of all of our sins lord I pray that you allow your victory to be seen in us tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I like to entitle this message call-by-name one of the things that I like to bring out is that God and his people has always been one God told Israel that's what his relationship with Israel was was to be one his name was to be one when we think about a name a name can be a word or a combination of words by which a person place or thing a body or class or any object of thought is designed called or known for an example we call we know that a dog is a dog but sometimes we give that dog a name and that name is to distinguish it from all of the other dogs in the neighborhood when we continue to call that dog by name he began to recognize his name and so when he hears the master call he responds to that name now we look at the beginning in Genesis v 5 we found out that when God made Adam and God gave Adam that Dane God didn't have a I Adam didn't have a choice of name God called his name Adam and we find out that in the Genesis 5 that Adam now masculine part and his feminine part was the same named Adam the Bible said according to the second verse of the fifth chapter and he called their name Adam well when Adam failed God didn't say Adam where are you where are you and Eve where are you but we find out that when they failed God call Adam and at that point in time they both responded but because of Eve's or Adam's the feminine part of Adam because of the sin she was entrapped because now amen she has a seed in within her womb that was not God's seed it actually came from the serpent and because she carried that seed she was now bring fourth a different kind of fruit and God said your name shall be called Eve because you are now the mother of all living so names are important with God and names always have a meaning with God and so you and I must understand that names also give one's their identity is that right and when when when God would name something there was always a meaning behind it amen like when God called Abram Abraham it was because Abraham or Abram and God which means ham came together to be one and now Abraham represented God on earth because God told Abraham you are and you will be the father of many nations him and he took that tight in that shadow from God and when God attached his name to you oh my what a beautiful thing amen so you must understand that we we are in a time in a place where we must know our name because we are not a denomination we are not at organization we are not a man-made system but we are called the body of Christ and the Bible tells us that the body of Christ takes on the name of Jesus Christ is that right a man according to the Word of God it says and know of whom aha the Bible tells us that the whole heaven and earth is named after him is that right that's in Ephesians 3:14 215 so we realized names are important but the thing about it is that when God call you by name that is a personal that is a personal thing that God is doing hello is that right remember the Bible tells us about Josiah Josiah was named Josiah before he even arrived on earth it was a name given by God which showed us that Josiah was not only chosen but he was elected to be king God tells us in the book that did Jeremiah he says listen I knew you Jeremiah and I called you by name hallelujah I formed you in your mother's womb not only did I call you but I justified you I sanctified you I gifted you and you'll be a prophet so those things Amen that God told about Jeremiah he actually became that hallelujah now you must understand by God's grace that God has a great thing going on with us today now you said why why does names names mean so important because I said names will identify you a name would distinguish you right Amen that's why God even called he said there's a male that's a female hallelujah Amen he separated them after the fall uh-uh and gave them such a name Amen that they were actually different Adam and Eve but at the beginning though they be male and female they all they hope they both had the same name you understand me it's going to be important and I'm trying to teach a little bit but I want to say this today you know names are important because people who call you a dog remembering the time some of us remember amen during the 60s they used to call them cats they're cool cat but now they call them dogs so they done switched over now they're no longer catch their dogs even and you know that you should call you know man that went when somebody would with what would be a big person he was a man he's a monster but they don't call him monster now they say he's a beast right amen it's a descriptive name because when somebody is called a beast you don't expect to see a lamb you expect to see somebody that's big and ferocious right amen now I've heard just read they just the other day that people are calling them to their children little demons now if you would call your child a little demon what do you expect them to be demons because demons will have a right to manifest themselves through your children that's why I tell people don't call me a dog a dog is an insult the word dog evening when you call me a dog or car it's an insult it's like calling somebody a pig or swine it's an unclean animal hallelujah and you and I must understand that we are beyond all of that God has given his people a name and I'm trying to get to it and I'm not going to be long but I want to say this you know we have been chosen and elected understand Eve received her name because of her fall now there must be a woman who God will restore and in that restoration he will then restore her name back to what it should be hallelujah it is important because I want you to say the Bible said if my people and this is the answer if my people which are called by my name right so understand on earth we represents the name of God if you're not a Christian don't be a Christian right but when you say I am a Christian you are a representative of God which is in heaven right if my people which are called by my name called by his name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land this is the answer to everybody in here and for those who are not in here this is the answer if you have been called by God's name if you humble yourselves and pray and seek his face God said I will heal the land and this was our restore it back to his healthy state ha I will forgive your sins right and will heal your land he said I want you to understand I'm waiting on you now my eyes shall be open and my ears attend unto the prayer that is made in this place so he says I am here to hear your prayer I've given you the solution to restoration I've given you too little the solution to bring you back to the place you used to be or you should be right listen it's the truth a name is so important according to the scripture of Isaiah 45 and 1 it says in brother Branham said like that she said this scripture refers to this day in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our bread and we're our own apparel and let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach he was working with this because he said in this day would be such looseness with women and I want to say it like this he's not just talking about women only he's working with churches they have left the moral standards and the life of Christ to there take any name to take away their reproach in other words I'm Baptist I method I'm presbyterian a message I'd like to say who all in here and you don't have to raise your him because I want I'm not trying to put you on the spot who all believe this message in here I'm sure you answer but let me ask you a question who all are in here that are Christians see I can ask ask that question who are who are it everybody in here that are truly a message believer amen let me see you raise your hand right and no doubt everybody erased ahead but the next question is that everybody raised and everybody that's a Christian let us raise your hand see that it's two different things two different things so when people say I'm a message believer that does not mean that they are Christian no more than a person would say I'm a Baptist or Methodist or Pentecostal that does not mean you are a Christian hello is that right that's what the brother Brennan said did that I forgot the brother who asked his sister are you a Christian she said I want you to I want you to know that I burn a candle every night burning a candle every night yeah are you a Christian I am I want you to know I am an American what that has to do with Christianity right you must understand we are living in an age of blasphemous names well people are considering themselves to be Christian because of the name of their church or their organization and it has nothing to do with Christianity we need some real Christians now Dave listen at the Garden of Eden what caused death and all this sorrow every heartache every little dying baby every rattle in the throat every ambulance screaming every hospital every graveyard was because he doubted one word that this always gets me she doubted one word now not not all of it it just perverted it now God said man there he was to keep every word of God that was the first Bible every word of God and I would ask you tonight how many of us are keeping every word of God don't incident but I will for you in a minute in the middle of the Bible Jesus come and he says men should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God right not just part of them everyone now if Eve breaking one word prejudice into this devastation how are we going to get back to heaven when we are all guilty of breaking more than one see I'm working with this now so you can understand and then you and I can't do it the Bible has already told us that the righteous our righteousness is less filthy rags right filthy rags we can't we can't do it somehow we've got to find a way for them says in the last of the Bible revelation 22 Jesus give the testimony of himself the revelation the Bible's Jesus Christ and he said who should ever shall eat one word I take one word excuse me out of there or add one word to it this part will be taken from the book of life right one word take it away or attitude right so you must understand this is a serious matter and people don't understand this is why election is so important this is why when God calls you is your way of escape and that's why we must respond is our responding to the call that shows us who we really are is that right remember there was a young man Amen in the Bible he was a rich young ruler and the Bible said that Jesus loved him he was called by God right he approached God with his works that's where I'm going with you he approached God with works good master what must I do to inherit the kingdom of God and God said okay you gonna approach me with the law and I'm gonna give you the law right and Jesus went down the line come out said he loved him that means that this young man was good he was well educated well schooled he did exactly all of the right things so you can do all the right things and still not make it Oh help me Jesus this man did all the right things and then Jesus being the Word of God look deep into his heart right the Word of God is a two-edged sword is able to divide it pierces to the soul it goes right in there and it finds that little secret spot and he Jesus went in there and found out where the man treasure is ah come on somebody your treasure is hidden right here whether it be earthly or whether be heavenly it's in the heart and the Bible will search it out and he will expose it exactly just like he did the rich young ruler it doesn't matter how well you behave yourself and how good and clean you live it's who and what you are have as a treasure mmm and he went right in there and he said unto the rich young ruler sell all that you have see let me tell you something that's why people don't have the Holy Ghost because they're not willing to sell all that they have and Jesus says a little leaven leavens the whole lump so you can't have nothing in you that's of the world you must separate every come o somebody that's the word of the Prophet God calls for total separation of unbilled from every unbelief you know that word only believe that means there's nothing else you can do you you got so much belief you can't that's all you can do there's no space for not believing only believe that's I can do right no no doubt let's cap this is a mini way I can only believe that was the theme of the angel's message only believe when you just only believe that means you have a faith that's incorruptible it's a mustard seed faith or whatever but it cannot be broken it's real and that same faith to bring down mountains when you only believe but this man was not only believer he was an unbeliever when the test came and the test will always just determine who and what you are hallelujah when that word comes is going to find you out whether you be a believer or a non-believer let me tell you like this the only one the only thing that can make you a real believer is the Holy Ghost you say well what do you mean Peter follow Jesus and Peter acted like he believed and Peter said Lord I'd die for you and when the test came hallelujah he did not in three times that's how you can tell whether you got it or not cuz when the Holy Ghost comes no matter how great the pressure is you still come out with Jesus Christ but Peter because of the pressure he denied Jesus oh Lord a real Christian will never deny Jesus died a me when Peter got converted the Bible said Peter after you are converted go strengthen your brother let them know where the good come from let them know where the straight come from the strength comes from the power of God in you that you now have it was then when Peter became a full believer even died for Jesus hallelujah is that Alright he said now you go through the thinking man's filter right so I want you to understand whosoever shall take one word out of here or add one word to it his part will be taken from the book of life now you go through the thinking man's filter you have to have a holy man's taste when you come out of there right you have to have a safety at saintly taste sisters you that wear those clothes think of it you're going to say I'm virtuous to my husband I'm virtuous to my boyfriend I'm a virtuous girl but what about the sinner that looks at you and when he answers for adultery who did it you'll be guilty it is written in the word she be a thinking woman and not only just the women but the men as well we must not allow ourselves to be presented in such a way that somebody will lust for us come on somebody you must understand the Bible said and for as many as led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God I'm going to come to the name in just a moment see it doesn't mean you won't have shortcomings it doesn't mean you're not gonna you know stumble and fall as long as you in this flash Amen but God is building of people to bring them to a perfection amen and that perfection is in Christ it's not in your flesh it is not what you do is what he has already done hallelujah understand this that a man that does not come to the full statue of Christ is not God's fault because he's poured out his spirit it is here all that was in God imported into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into his bride the Holy Ghost is here and all of the virtues of crisis here the reason why many won't make it because they refuse to get rid of the leavening and you and I must circumcise our hearts every day in order to come to the full statue of Christ who helped me Lord for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear you know why I'm preaching this because there are tons of people in the message that can shout that can dance that can speak in tongues that can run up and down the house and nothing's wrong with that but what's wrong isn't is that nobody is pressing into the kingdom hallelujah we need a revival we need a Holy Ghost revival that's gonna take away all of this self all of this lust all of these things that people are still doing we need a Holy Ghost revival that's gonna burn all of the stuff out uh hey so we can see the real Church of God God the devil don't care if you call yourself a message you don't care about that he don't even care about how good a preacher preach coz the many preachers gonna be there out of there y'all here I'm saying God didn't say that the preachers were exempt the preachers must come into the full statue of Christ oh they must have the same Holy Ghost William Branham had hallelujah oh we can look at the present all look what he did but the reason why he did what he did because he had the genuine Holy Ghost and when he came hallelujah that same Holy Ghost was released and given back to the church so we have no excuse but the Brennan said no matter how good you are what what you quit doing what you start doing you've got to accept the person of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah that's it justification make room for sanctification st. vacation make room for the baptism the Holy Ghost and a lot of people stop there when I praise God I've been who I got it that ain't it you don't stop there it that's the mystery of the seventh seal you must have the person of Jesus Christ in you that don't me hey and God is God ain't working with no duplex there's only one personality that will reach heaven and that's Jesus Christ the personality of Jesus Christ is the only one that's gonna be taken y'all hear what I'm saying when Jesus come oh I'm jumping a little bit up man swear say it the Holy Spirit when Jesus come and that Archangel cry out he's not gonna cry eyes here Joe to Peter James John no he's gonna scream one name that's we did he's gonna call his own name one name whatever that name is the bride of Jesus Christ will get up it's got to be that way because that's the way it was when God said Adam they both turn hallelujah and has got to be restored and the Bible said the whole heaven and earth is named after him and that name is a lot Jesus Christ hallelujah so when he calls now watch this cuz he receives a new name you know but whatever it is the bride will know it I don't care if she's been laying in the grave for hundreds of years hallelujah when he called that name hallelujah hey somebody she'll get up hallelujah is this okay no matter how good you are how much you say you're believer God requires the token he requires it in Egypt he requires it tonight he requires it tonight still the token is just as much required in this age as it was in that day age I don't care if you was a Bible student how well you can explain the scriptures Satan can do the same thing but remember that has nothing to do with it God requires one thing and that's the token the token shows that you are identified with your sacrifice that you claim that you worship a man there's only one lamb and that lamb was Jesus Christ halle-loo is that right Revelation tells us hallelujah he showed up as a bloody lamb that lion II mean that John saw turned up to be a lamb and he was bloody as though he and he's been slain we're from the foundation of the world that means that God just didn't start this work he started before the foundation of the world he put your names our names in the Lamb's Book of Life and we'll see one thing about the land the name true believe us know that the lead the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the true name of God they know it they know it hallelujah wow he was given to him before they came here that's the truth I knew that Jesus Christ was God before I came to this message I was a Baptist and I knew that there was only one God and I knew his name was Lord Jesus Christ how did I know people of God God revealed it it wasn't me it was because I was there with him Oh Lord hallelujah it's got to be real God God listen I don't know whether I said this but i'ma say it now Michelangelo he made a statue called Moses right and he built that Moses and it became a masterpiece but since then they have had replicas you know people can make a replica of it but that's it's a cheap replica right and understand Christians can be replicated become replicas yes but God in looking for a replica he's looking for the original he's looking for an individual a man who is from the original that's why God couldn't give you something outside of himself he had to give you the original life am I making sense he had to give you the original life he could not give you something that was secondary a substitutional he had to give you the original life which was himself the Holy Ghost is the original life you got to be real and we find out I'm a hurry we find out Amen that you know a real Christian you're preachers like I said a lot of preachers are not even believe us the Bible says these signs shall follow them that believe you don't have no signs you're not a believer if he's a preach all the days of miracles man don't care what's he preaching he's a non-believer he's a sinner in the eyes of God the word sin means unbelief hello there's only two factions that is a believer and unbeliever right come on somebody so Sid is unbelievable like I was telling somebody the other day even if you just got small miracles it's okay at least you've got some signs following you right but there should never be a Christian who can say I've never seen the supernatural something's wrong first of all you just told me you're not born again because nothing can become more supernatural than being born again Oh somebody help me that's that's a justified person or sinner right that's all if you an unbeliever you're a sinner no matter how good you are how much you go to church or even if you a preacher you still an unbeliever the Pharisees were preachers and they were unbelievers and in Hell today for it somebody that's right that's the Hebrews chapter 2 y'all must understand you and I we the only way that you can truly believe you can't even comprehend God without the Holy Ghost the just shall live by his faith hello not your own the just shall live by his faith hallelujah by faith God by faith God created so the just shall live by his faith the just shall live by the faith of God the just shall live by the faith of Jesus Christ that's it that's it see we waste our time and our energy trying to make something happen when all we need to do is depend on him oh come on somebody look at the woman with the issue of blood she didn't even have no scripture for what she was going to do hallelujah but her faith kicked in she realized that this man Jesus had to be the messiah or somebody sent from God and she said if I can just but touch the heel in this comment I shall be made whole by somebody it was God who gave me that revelation if you thirst for God he said I will fill you I would oka most about it I will feed you if you hunger and thirst for me ain't no such thing but God you didn't help wow you got a hunger thirst so a Lord I don't know how to ask for it that's how you hunger in thirst you don't know how to do it ask him for it hallelujah she calling it an Easter seal he says true he said Christian's doesn't ask for easy things there's so much promises today made among Christian people so many ministers promise the people of false thing if you just come to Christ all your troubles are settled I'll tell you when you come to Christ they then begin that's when you put on a uniform and take a gun and enter the battlefield right the Christian Road is not a flowerbed of ease it's a battle from the very power you start until the Spirit is set free by death you are not at a picnic you are own a battle cry that's modern-day Hollywood oh if you gain you go prosper yeah yeah right modern day Christianity look down on poor Christians Oh God can't be with you because he promised us if you are true Christian you go prize but you gonna have all these riches you're gonna be the head and not the tail hallelujah well I wonder who Lazarus was who was just Lazarus who's a poor man who laid at the rich young ruler stable running for the crumbs trying to get to the scrapings that he scraped off his table before the dogs got to it who was this Lazarus I tell you who he was he was chosen and elected of God some time God make us poor allow us to be poor so that he testing those who say they're Christians is that right oh come on somebody what what on the road to Jericho there was a man that was that had been beaten and wounded the Pharisees walked on by Sadducees walk to him by y'all know y'all understand me and here was a publican right he was a man a man who was who was I put it this way of mixed race but he saw this man come on somebody a Samaritan and he saw this man this man was a low-life in his day that's the way they looked at him you ain't nothing that's the way people in this message look at people you ain't nothing but let me tell you it doesn't matter what you know physical composition is made out of it's whether or not you got the C gene of God on the inside and when you have to see Gino you need inside you maybe his point art in this world but in that world he said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also in my father's house are many mansions God don't care but all the stuff that we care about hallelujah and here he said this Samaritan says hey I'm gonna bond you I'm gonna take you over here amen and push you into this hotel and I'm gonna pay for it hallelujah and he told the innkeeper good take good care of him preacher he came in here wounded I found him almost dead but preacher don't you let him die keep putting the oil the bomb of getting on him hallelujah bring him back to health huh and I'm gonna tell you something the only way to bring the Christian back to health is get those to see if you can get those pretty Christians to repent because the only reason why our Christian becomes spiritually sick is because they doing things and have done things that they shouldn't have done or and they won't repent if my people think which are called by my name if they would humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways he said I hear from heaven honey and I he know the lane I'll forgive you of your sins and I heal the land that's not in every case but I'm talking about in general we're talking about a revival brother but I would say the only way we can have a revival we must get the trash out of our lives and he said the bride has not had her revival yet that means the bride has not trashed out her trash I believe we are but we got too many isms we got too many things laying within us dark spots this has to go brother em said that's the only way you're gonna make a rapture go listen to the message leadership it's all got to go every world in this thing about you it must go leadership come on that's what it don't listen to it he said every every little worldly thing has to be separated you gotta leave it no matter how painful it is you got to leave it is that right think about it you think you giving up something if Bobby said Moses was a rich young ruler Moses could have had women on top of women wine and dine chariot summer homes winter houses whatever he woman it but the Bible says he refused to be called the son of the Pharaoh's daughter he refused to be part of this world why because he exceed the riches of Christ hallelujah and when you extend the Holy Ghost over all of these other things God can use you but we got so many people they don't even look at the Holy Ghost I mean let me let me tell y'all something God took the tree of life and moved it out of the way and then he but what I'm saying he's got a morphing right so the same tree of life he comes and he comes in the form of bread they call it manna and he hid himself in that manner is that right am I wrong okay so come on it's true he there's only one life and that's Christ and that same life hid himself in that manner you said what do you say am I saying like the Bible said Jesus said how was that bread how was that manner that came down in the wilderness how was that manna and the Bible said listen they think they got to a place they hated it they wanted meat and that's the way where is in this message everybody want meat but they don't want the manner but let me say it like this God never said I was that meat in the wilderness but he said I was that bread I would that matter that fell from heaven and it is the matter that Pat's out the Holy Ghost hallelujah is that right because he breaks bread and communion hallelujah is the if the people can really see it is that right the same thing the Jewish Church did the cornerstone they rejected the cornerstone and that cornerstone was the holy goat the cornerstone was Jesus Christ why because people don't want the Holy Ghost in their charges anymore like I said they just want that almost pimsy calls almost don't go all the way but you can raise your hand a little bit and shout hallelujah a little bit but don't go all the way but i'ma tell you the only ones that's gonna make a rapture are those who are deign to go all the way don't tell me there aren't any but there are amen and those names will never come up short everybody that God has ordained now I don't know about you but I'm one of them I'm that man that's gonna that's that's in the process and God is moving me now in the process of cleaning up everything I'm not mature forsaken everything and I thought dude this guy shows me something else got got to go to it's constantly showing me things that got to die and move out of my way but I'm gonna tell you something people of God I'm making it my name is in the book I don't care yeah I was telling somebody it cuz you know lately I've had you know friends to fall back on me and but I says Lord Jesus if this is a test I accept because nothing means more to me than my Jesus as much as I love friends and family nothing means more to me than my Jesus Christ hallelujah y'all understand me hallelujah is this okay brother branham tells us of a story where the farmers the 4-h club was able to make a seed that looks just like a coin your coin I caught on the car he said it was so identical you couldn't tell the difference between the two but the man who manufactured it says the only difference the only way you can tell the difference is to bury the boat both of them he said the original will always come up but the one that's man-made it will rot hallelujah and that's what's happening right now those who are in the message those who are claiming to be Christians they have adapted systems that have hot bread at the Word of God and instead of producing Christ they're rotting somebody help me only Jesus Christ can bring forth the resurrection only the life of Christ in the original seed hey man it has nothing to do with what we call ourselves is what he calls us mmm John 1318 says listen I know of whom I have chosen so nobody can pull the wool over God's eyes God knows who have chosen right it doesn't matter how beautiful it is that's what brother brown say there's two men sitting on the same seat in the church both of them deacons or pastors or whatever they may be or two of the lady laity but of them going to going to both of them going to church listening at the same message both but one has life and the other one does not it takes the hand of God to do something for a man if you're born again got the Spirit of God in you you've got to live again no matter how good you are how religious you are if that spirit of life is not in you your parish ain't about calling yourself Pentecost oh because I'm gonna tell you something the Pentecost ahead the real Holy Ghost but it was only spirit on the spirit the revelation of this message took us beyond beyond the inner court hallelujah the message of this hour takes you into the Holies of Holies with where the soul is whether some kind of glory is whether real birth of God is death cannot stand in the Shekinah glory hallelujah is that right it was proven by Aaron's rod if you stand and stay in the Chicago glory not into that the only thing that can happen if you go in there dead you rise again hallelujah there's a showdown coming and you know people don't understand that every trial and test that you having is sent by God people don't don't make think oh it's terrible and I can't hardly take it in No the Bible said God will not put no more on you than you can bear God knows every trial he's already designed it for you hallelujah which one you rather rather have would you rather have a lion eat you would you rather go through the fire hmm would you rather go through the chopping block mmm all these people have gone through things like this that you and I cannot imagine hallelujah but they kept the faith look throughout all times and then they took those Christians and they rip the out of their bodies they fed them to the Lions they burned him at the stake they skinned them alive they rose kissing them and yet the hell home I think about what I'm saying they kept the faith why because God called them by name and when God calls you by name you become invincible his word cannot fall neither can it fail hallelujah you ought to be some thankful that you do have a name there are women who have been so bad God wouldn't even call him by name is that right come on you say who you tell my Lot's wife [Laughter] God didn't even give her a name yeah and I'm saying hallelujah you said what well you oh come on there's another one Saul's daughter God just took her name off the book and everything didn't even tell us what it's you know me you said oh listen we know that Bathsheba what she did but in the New Testament God don't in combat Sheba name he'd cheat kahiko Uriah's wife that was no compliment you see what I'm saying but the Bible tells us that he we have a name y'all don't understand what William Branham brought to us was a revelation of Jesus Christ oh because you have the revelation of Jesus Christ you have the name hallelujah that's why he said listen don't add to the word don't take away because that is the name the Bible said his name shall be called the Word of God Oh somebody help me here it's got to be real mmm is that right listen he said I don't steal I don't drink I don't do these things that has nothing to do with it see it's the inside no matter how good you are how Mario you are how truthful you are those things are respected but jesus said except a man be born again there's got to be something happened inside if you don't that out of fissure put on fall down in your heart you desire to do it anyhow it can't be artificial it's got to be real whoo y'all hear me I'm trying to hurry now listen we come in this last day and you know I always loved Esther because God had already put put away - die God ain't moving in those organizations I can say some things that'll blow your mind yup not blow your mind forgive me for saying it that way but you know I can tell you some truth that'll really shake you up because if Jesus are calling the revelation the third chapter is outside the door let me ask you a question then who's on the inside it's an impersonator it's the scripture right in later see of Jesus Christ is outside the door trying to get in and if he's only outside who's on the inside the Bible said in these last days Satan will deceive all whose names are not written on the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah he Paul says be careful he would disguise himself as an angel of light he will even call himself Christ so he in the church calling himself Christ and he's deceiving and what is he deceiving where is he bringing them to the mark of the beast I'm gonna stay with my organization I'm gonna stay with my church I'm gonna stay with your charge can't save you that is the mark of the beast whenever you choose a system over the line that is the mark of the beast done exactly what Cain is done hallelujah come on somebody uh uh you know I I don't mean no harm I don't care how deep these preachers get in the message if they don't bring me back to the blood of Jesus Christ I don't want to have nothing to do with it if they don't bring me back to the power of the Holy and coming into a statue of a person man I don't have nothing to do with it why because I know that when when Moses left out of Egypt he had dated Ankara with him and they're here too everybody want to interpret remember they were way off for what brother wept with Moses said hallelujah Joshua go ahead on the on your mission but always remember what Moses said we must remember what Malachi for has said holida y'all y'all understand me listen I'm gonna tell you that's the truth of the matter everybody that think they got the Holy Ghost do not have it and some of them have it but just only spirit it ain't going today so because they still doing that nasty stuff hallelujah and all that must go no one clean thing shall enter it's up to you the choice is up to you whether you're gonna go all the way with God or not see people don't like it when I preach like this cuz I'm telling you the truth God gonna hold me for this I'm gonna tell you cuz I don't want Peter when I'm in the message I think about a million's with Moses in his message and they all died except two of that generation don't be foolish he told Nicodemus except you be born again he got to be listen in the latter rain you know where we're coming into a Mount Zion showdown you know God is gonna prove who the true church is hmm don't get me wrong when the anointing fall that's coming under the anointing I know some people don't believe that but I've seen it in the word another unknown thing is coming guarded gonna pour down for the last time mmm and it's gonna bring everything into harvest rain do not change this seed it just manifests what it is if it's weed it's gonna come up and praise the law if it's weed it's gonna come up and praise the Lord y'all know what I'm saying what's ever in there right who would have thought the rich young ruler was a devil and God loved him who would have thought Judas who could cast out devils and each unordered by the holy ghost yet he was born the son of perdition look at Peter he looked like he looked like he was in worse shape than Judas Judas just denied in one time Peter said three times and he cashed but on the inside of the inside he had representation it ain't how good we are we supposed to be as good as we could be but it's all about Jesus Christ and His salvation hallelujah I don't want to scare you into something but I wouldn't if I could scare you into prayer I would because prayer is the only way out I'm telling you people don't understand prayer is there at all people thousands when we have two heard the word one out of a million got to do with it I'm talking about the rapture I'm not talking about salvation many will have salvation I'm talking about making a rapture whoo in the latter rain will come a mount calmer showdown brothers here watch this carefully down to see it in the word John was the forerunner of Malachi 3 and I got a hurry up cuz the time is right now but let me say it like this the Bible says that listen listen he first talking to the preachers that's why I'm hollering and screaming the way I'm screaming how's their 62 beginning at the first verse he says for Zions sake will I not hold my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteousness they're up go forth as brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burn it and the Gentiles shall see that righteousness and all kings that glory and thou shall be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name is that right he's talking to either but the new name in which God was speaking of at that time was not Jehovah it was Jesus because God made the Son of God thou shalt call his name Jesus and he shall save his people from their sin so it transformed it it moved forward from just your home to Jehovah's salvation which is Jesus Christ right he says now listen and the Gentiles that see the righteousness and all the kings that glory and that should be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name thou shall also be a crown of glory in the land of the Lord and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God for thou for thou shall no more be term forsaken neither shall I land anymore be termed desolate but thou shalt be called head Sabha and the lamb Beulah for the Lord delighted indeed and that land shall be married hello not just engaged married for as a young man marries a virgin so shall the sons marry thee and there's a bridegroom rejoices over the bride so shall the God rejoices over thee what is it why why the scripture said that that that that that that John rejoiced to see the bridegroom you know why because he knew if there was a bridegroom there's got to be a bride hallelujah that's why we umbrella rejoiced through all of the suffering he had to go through with these organizations denomination they didn't know when they kicked him out they were kicking Jesus out when they closed the doors on him they closed the doors on Jesus Wow because he was the voice of God hallelujah y'all hear me it was that point we said listen all heaven save me remember even demons he said demons as Forsaken Lee it was the same in Paul's day he had a demons and demons forsook him this demons of our day he brought the Pentecostal Church into the World Council of Churches why because of riches money better you know what it is Christian businessman they got warned you know they were warned you saw what do you mean God warned him so much and told them you go this way you're going to be lost no matter how good you are how big of your kingdom your building you lost because you rejected the word of the hour hallelujah he said ban you you should listen the truth is the truth he said I've set my watchman upon the walls o Jerusalem which shall never hold their peace day no night the watchman's are the preachers and if the preachers in this day you know what they're not trying to get the people to the Holy Ghost something's wrong with them they cannot be a watchman not a watchman for God because they know except you see the blood if the token is not applied I don't care how glorious your kingdom is you've made the blood is the only way of escape and we know that the blood is the life of Jesus it is the Holy Ghost and I don't mean in baby thorns we must have the fullness of Christ all that was in God he poured it into Christ all that was in Christ he poured it into his bride so the fullness of Christ must be in the bride of Jesus Christ you said well you mean it ain't gonna be a lot that's why God didn't call groups God calls individuals I'm almost done right okay let me read this quickly he said give him no rest till he established until he make jerusalem a praise in the earth don't give him no rest who is Jerusalem you are you are the New Jerusalem hallelujah it's the truth you are Jerusalem you are the City of God hallelujah no you not that your body is the temple of God you are the New Jerusalem Oh him that overcomes when I make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and I were right upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of the heaven from God and I were right upon him my new name he that haven't he let him hear what the Spirit why is he anointing her Amen because she's no longer a bride she's a wife and her his wife must have his name that's where we are this can't be no religion you can make it that but you in for something I'm talking to everybody tonight you've got to escape this darkness I'm telling you yeah God God God don't like it when we we come up in here starchy and you know don't don't listen I know it ain't all shouting and dancing and all that I know that but how can the goodness of God being you is that right in the presence of the Lord is what fullness of joy come on somebody how can we do that to him if it's real to you you ought to so show some signs right that's what we should say in that pillar cause if the Lord of God has been good to you you are to show some sign if the Lord God has been good to you you are the soul some signs is that right oh yeah how can you say he been good to you you know he's showing no signs oh well yeah that that old donkey that Oh God that old me that donkey that was been sick fed real good he was about there kicking out there right and that one that all got all them vitamins and stuff all educated and everything else you know he couldn't hardly move but that big fat when any man who's been out there eating all that grass and getting fed real good he was out there bucking and kicking yeah have you ever seen that I passed Farms and knows how those animals out there just bucking and kicking they're happy grasping good I'm almost done people I'm almost oh but I can't help it he said I heard a voice from heaven behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he would dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall be any more pain for the former things have passed away and he that said upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said it to me right but these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I were given to him that is athirst of the fountain of the waters of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful and the unbelieving and the abominable murderers whoremongers sorcerers idolaters and all Liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show thee the bride the Lambs wife and he carried away in the spirit of a great and high mountain and showed me that the great city that holy Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God having what having the glory of God breaking it down you see those virtues up on the wall they got to come off the wall into the heart that is the glory of God alright people don't understand you know each each age I told you told you earlier each age emphases all the way up carry their virtue they died holding those virtues patience and godliness and everything else but the difference between us and them they can't be complete without us because we must have them all right this age must be kept with divine love and you can't get divine love without brotherly kindness hello that's why the devil fights all of us with each other he want to keep you away from brotherly kindness I'm telling you that's what it's all about if he can stop you for going there because you may be all the way up there but every time you get the brotherly kindness you fall because somebody stepped on your toe yeah but that's one of those things you got to get over you know a dead man can't say ouch he's dead he's dead and you can kick him you could scream at him and he won't move that's the kind we must have that's the kind we must be in this message you love the lord call by name that means that your name is the Lord Jesus Christ the devil when those verses come is that right I'm a closing for the realms are like this he said Legion was not afraid of the man it was the character that he saw in Jesus Christ that's what the devil is scared of he don't won't see the character of Jesus Christ in you because he understands when that character is there he's no longer fighting you he's fighting Jesus and he understand the battle is already lost he's lost the battle you love the Lord sisters I hope I was clear enough for you I did get fight fast I hope you got something tonight but let us
