service thank you brother appreciate the energy I used to be that thank you for the musicians all of you it's just a blessing to have everybody here we realized that we're living in the last days and the choices that we make will determine our destiny I believe with all of our heart that my heart that it's a real a very serious time and keeping our hearts and our mind focus all the times that we're living in is actually a matter of life and death it's easy to say I'm gonna keep my mind on Jesus but we do have an adversary who is seeking to devour seyton we know doesn't play any games but he's serious about what he's doing and we should be serious about what we're doing it doesn't make it easy but one thing I noticed the the theme of of the song service and that is victory and God has given us the victory did you what I said I said God has given us to fix it we don't we don't we don't do nothing but receive it and if you receive it you have it it's yours God don't need your reasoning he doesn't need your processing by faith the just shall live by his faith turn with me to Genesis 3 please Genesis 3 understand by God's grace I heard a brother say this today it i don't normally listen to people's messages other than brother branham's but today i was sent a link to something and actually it was brother Craig or speaking down in Lima Ohio and what a what a powerful message he was speaking I really enjoyed it but I I know one of the things that he emphasized which we all do and he used the mirror situation it's about had a mirror I'll show you who your greatest enemy is and I like that I like that you know because the prophet of God he tells us the greatest enemy is ourselves ah if we're going to become something in Christ we must first deny ourselves that's the sensible principle of the gospel deny yourself take up your cross and follow me and I think that's where we are right now in a season of constantly constantly denying ourselves because Paul said that we must die daily and we must die - I will every day Lord not my will but thine be done reading from Genesis 3 9 through 24 we are familiar with these scriptures and by God's grace we read them and then we'll have another word our scripture would ask you to turn to and then we'll go from there and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto Him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told thee that thou had was naked as thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded that thou should not should not eat amen and the man said the woman whom thou gave it to me to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat in the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field and upon thy belly thou shalt go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of their life and I will put in between between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel amen we could read on but let's just jump down there to the last two verses of that that particular one there chapter therefore the Lord God sent forth sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way and to keep the way of the two Tree of Life for more scripture please Psalms 5 excuse me for songs 53 and 1 to the chief musician upon the Halleck basket a psalm of David the fool have said in his heart there is no God corrupt are they that have done abominable iniquity there is none that doeth good let us pray father God we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy we need your guidance we need your help Lord and we pray that you would take my being make sanctify and cleanse it let nothing hinder your usage of my body tonight speak through the lips of this man and glorify your word and your name and your name Jesus Christ we pray you may be seated I was asking the Lord just the other day on what to speak and I said Lord I have been a place where I don't know which direction to go how to continue the thought you know I did not want to just jump into something that would just excite us but at the same time I didn't want to preach in such a way that it would discourage you because the message in itself is good news not bad good news and we are in a time where we should feel really blessed that we are hearing the thoughts of God and the reason why we can hear the thoughts of God is because God in our last his last day sent out the voice by the way of Malachi 4 and so God gave me a picture of some sort and I don't know how else to say it but he said to me the fate of foolishness and we know what foolishness is it comes from the result as the resulting from or showing a lack of since you're considered unwise some foolish action you know speech or lack of forethought or caution you know when it comes to God sometimes people just say things with no caution you know with no thought you know lacking understanding who God is you know I remember the prophet of God said that he was there Amen in California and there was an earthquake and this man was out on the side while shaking his fist at God well that's what you call foolishness you know that's like an ant threatening a man when that man has to do one motion you know stamp a mountain not even consider that he was ever there and I think about this what Adam and Eve did was foolishness he had orders not to even touch the tree or basically have no real conversation with it but we understand the thought on what happened but the point I wanted to bring out is because of their foolish act they were kicked out of the Garden of Eden they no longer had everlasting life on earth now they never lost their eternal life because they came from God and there was only one place to go back and that was to go back to God we understand by God's grace because before the foundation of the world God saw the situation but men we have a tendency to be foolish sometimes we speak things that out of my arm out of our mouths as if God doesn't care nor does God hear it was one of the things that Israel did they constantly complained and murmured and didn't even realize that God was listening see God hears your thoughts afar off the Bible says before we even get to a place where we can other words out of our mouth God has already heard us amen he knows our hearts by the things and we speak because the Bible says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and sometimes we do we make foolish gestures and things of that nature not realizing Amen that God is not pleased with it but one of the greater sins is that it's of a man is to be a man who believed that God doesn't exist in that way I feel like a man has more more faith in what that than I could possibly have I think about the people who believe in atheism and uh you know evolution you know believing that we evolved from some Polliwog and you know you can trace it all the way back and then I want to find out where this thing started and if it started with a grain of sand or whatever then how did it start and why did it start and why isn't everything just alike you know but we we in our great minds we think that that we are are super you know it if the scientists could see that the previous world the ant eluvian day those people were far more intelligent than what I think it would brush their bubbles a little bit or to bring them down a little low because they could do things that we couldn't we can't even do today and we still don't know all the things that they could do a reason being because God loves to erased things he will erase it and then allow men to start all over again but because we're fallen we make the same mistakes that's why Solomon said there's no new thing under the Sun what has been to will be and you know he goes on to say no matter how men think they are achieving things he said I tell you the conclusion of the matter in to feel God and keep his Commandments now we know by God's grace that the Bible said that the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighted in his way though he thought he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand I have been young and now I am old yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he is ever merciful and linda's and his seed is blessed is that right blessed depart from evil and do good and dwell forever for the Lord loveth judgment and forsaken not the Saints they are preserved forever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein forever so we realize they meant that God has already sent a word out there that holds you that preserves you that literally sets your boundaries a seed of God cannot blasting the Holy Ghost because God has set boundaries he can't Goldman so far and that's God's doing had not God put that word out like that then we would have been almost like James said you know James talked about a double minded man house he is unstable in all of his ways he talked about wicked people how they're like waves that - up against the rocks and stuff in other words they have no sense of direction they're there in a state of confusion all of their lives but that is the evidence or the sign of what fate is because fate when we think about it as we said is a it's a it's the result you know of lacking sense we we think we know and we don't and that's why the Bible says that in all of our ways we ought to acknowledge him and if we would acknowledge him he will direct our path with sheep and we have no sense of direction we always and always will lead a shepherd other than we we find that sometimes we talk about fate and you know people who have had Harlow both times in this life you know many are the afflictions even the Bible says of the righteous but God delivers them out of them all and we realize Amen that you and I must understand Amen that God protects us even when we don't know we're being protected because fate would Saul upon all of us but God protects us by directing our paths sometimes people are born in situations where they fate has a grip upon them for example many men born poor in a poor condition and there is no place in the country or in the city where they could ever pull themselves out of it you know I think about people over in India who are born naked pool and because of their names it could never be anything that's fate it's disastrous it's horrific it's this condition that that only God can get a man out of but God is more than able I've seen God by the Word of God pull poor people off the street even in India when they were nothing and made them something we talk about fate we talk about our destiny you know they talk about bad children and you know we look at the condition of a person when they're a child and we think to us how cells and sometimes we speak that we said you know if they're continued that way that their fate will will in in in in a bad way sometimes they become murderers you know and often time they they become imprisoned because of the various things that they tend to do don't mean to do it but that's the way fate has handled them but the fool is part about all of that is that God gives every man a chance the gospel will even go into the prison house yeah God seek those that are lost and is ending the Bible said it is his will that none should perish but have everlasting life see so no matter how doom and gloom it may appear you make your life they appear God said with every temptation there's a way of escape he make it so and even though things seem so foolish it seems like we're not when I say it like that it could be so dark he said what do you mean brother sometimes it seems like God ordered these things to be so so that he can come and show his power think about the man who was born blind Waterway but it was a result of fate something terrible happened to this man and he had no control over and they asked a question who did see it Jesus had no one this was all done for the glory of God so what are you saying but look even when you're in a dark place and it seems like fate has grabbed you thought something occurred in your life and you had nothing to do with it it wasn't even your fault but God will always give a man a choice he always come by those places where it seems like there is no way out yeah he is a deliverer of fate but it takes faith to be delivered from feet see you said what brother what are you saying I'm trying to say faith is foolishness once you see that there is a way out once you see that no matter how dark your situation may be there is a way out faith is laid there for people who have no hope but the Bible says I hope go beyond the grave we always have hope faith will never become a prison house for the believer this is why I even pass it on death where is your sting o grave where is no victory see death is a is the fruit of fate yeah because Adam and Eve sin brought death to all of us and fate rides on it like I was saying to something to Bob to a brother the other day I said you know what that's why the Bible says perfect love casts out fear because fate brings fear something that dramatically grips youa grabs you less for example you a cancer comes if the fruit of fate something happened you had no control of it right but it comes and it grabs you but listen faith conquer fate you let me say like this let me give me your thought on this don't you know fear it's the greatest weapon of Satan hell would have no power if the people in hell could relinquish fear if they could good rid of fear they would have power to fight but because they are afraid and it changed them it locks them into a position where every enemy in Hell can whip them beat them whatever it is going on in half it is it is what whole hell in this place fear love is what holds heaven love is a conqueror it couples all things that's why Jesus was able to go down into hell because he was the one who brought love to hell he was able to conquer hell and he came out of here see faint hair was the faith that we fell into because of sin but when he wrote here he descended into hell there was no fear hallelujah matter of fact he went to the devas dog and took the keys from death hell in the grave right he took them see what I'm trying to say one thing I know a minute look like see mister grab Joe but joke the Bible said when he ended up into the belly of the whale it wasn't all over because he had a faith he had a hope he may not have understood everything but he says Lord is it not written in your word that if I would turn toward the temple and pray that you would hear my cry she does that's that that breaks the chain I don't care what you into and what I seem to have a hold of you whatever bad habit it does that's not your fate you don't have to remain hallelujah because faith come cuz all of that and it's foolishness to believe that fate is your destiny if that makes sense that you whenever you're trapped into it is what it is see that's what's wrong with the world today because faith the reality of the one who could get the power of the conditions they're into they don't want to believe in him but he's the only one he's the only one that conquered the grave he's the only one that can deliver you he is faith now let me move on one thing about the Bible I love because there's so many illustrations of faith when you get into situations where you had no control over it but then there are times we read what we saw we get into things because we fail to consult God is that right we failed us look at God's okay God what is your will I've been there I've done that hallelujah and I have to be careful even now oh and everything because we are children of God as I said our greatest enemy is ourselves and sometimes we fall into situations and we can't blame God about it for it is it's but he also uses it as a tool of teaching he teaches us that's why the Bible said adjust man fall seven times in a day and he gets up he would never fall if he only would listen to the voice of God is that right oh that's why David said the Lord is my shepherd and has shared now walked right and he understood though he leads me though I walk in the valley in the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for thou art with me see as long as he's with you faint King grab you he can't touch you and what looks looks really like he's looks like the strongman yeah y'all notice man look at Israel who had a promise of God and here was Goliath they fell into something I'm sure that the Israelites didn't realize that Goliath was coming they were just fighting the Philistines they didn't know the first signs had a secret weapon hallelujah is that right but they also the Philistine didn't know that God had a secret weapon and you must understand that when it looks like the devil is getting the best of you there's a secret weapon somewhere God has something I heard a brother saying like this he preached it he said God has something obviously he always gonna bring you out he will bring fate unto the belly disastrous you think the devil wouldn't know by now not to touch God's anointed you think he'll know better than to come even when the Prophet God says if the weakest saying get down to pray Satan shakes he troubles because it doesn't matter how weak you feel because the Bible says when you're weak he's strong that right I read the scripture even if you fall God is there to keep you hallelujah it ought to really confused at there because when he fell it was it but even now how many times God forgive us because of our foolishness and you know what foolishness is that brings on a bad ending it's when we fail as I said again Lord not my will but thine be done is that okay let me ask you a question its obedient to the word is something it's not always looked upon I mean you don't always come out looking good think about it Jesus who had divine healing he was and he did and God told him go by the Pool of Bethesda and all of those sick people sicker than the man who who who who was rushing off of the car sicker brother I said there were people much sicker than he was but God came to that man take up your bed and walk and the healing campaign was over there was no more no one else but had he not done that you shoot him saying he was the kind of a person that can hear the voice of God and obey the voice of God but look at all that we have in this day what is the fate of those men who lose that gift for so many of them it's a real gift but they use God as a Hollywood show and their fate ain't looking good y'all understand what I'm sayin obedience is better than sacrifice listen just a quote from kingdom redeemer Americans act like Americans Germans act like Germans because their that's their national spirit now I'm saying something here because I don't really think that the people that with the Holy Ghost understand how you and I must be controlled by the spirit that comes from above we battle every one of us battle every day with demons from from beneath but you gotta break the holes why because they want to put you in a position where God backs up they're trying to give you a disastrous here but there is a word of god this is listen I have thoughts of you I'm in a great expectation and know that I want to give you and I have already given you and expected in not one of his famous sadness but one of success that's what God has given to us that word holds us keeps us right in that framework otherwise we would be just like anybody else making foolish mistakes but this is our guy and God knows I need this guy I don't know what I'd do without this guy hallelujah listen the Holy Spirit's coming from above from God and you know it's the truth every nation has a national spirit and out of heaven and you act like that makes you conduct yourself as they do up there because you are of another world I love that I preach on it we're from another world we must live like we're from another world in the near future I'm gonna have an all men's meeting and all women's meeting I'm gonna call the churches together because until we get up we need to understand that we are the we are the standard of what mere men supposed to be we are the standard of what women are supposed to be y'all hear what I'm saying let me say it again but if we get confused on the standard then where is the standard we are living in a society that really don't know what the standard of a woman's supposed to be and the standard of a man supposed to be huh that's why we ugly stop we make so foolish mistakes and you know what it's it's because of what Adam and Eve did is to faint I heard a brother say the other day which is so true did you not know that every religion came from the fall it used to be truth Adam and Eve lived under truth but when they fell it kept going farther and farther and farther and farther away till we got all kinds of cults all kinds of religions all kinds of gods and they all started from the same place because really when you leave the Word of God you plunge into darkness that's what happens and it just like us in the daytime in this period of time we look at things where well well well let me say like this there's a king by the name of never kanessa and never could never had an experience with God I don't know whether he was save a doctor but never could never knew that the God of Israel was the God of Israel and I think that the chance I was either his nephew a relative we know he was son but we find out in Daniel instead of staying with the laws of God knowing what had happened to never kanessa better chairs they thought he was going to have a different kind of life see he knew the difference heard about it but he thought I'm going to do what I want to do and see that's what I'm saying that's what happens we know the truth we know the word and we still feel that we can do what we want to do see that's the thing we fail to see that the profit that was in the profit still lives Jesus Christ is the profit he's a prophet of our prophets and he sees everything every move we make he sees it and he knows the thoughts and the intents of the heart commotion about it it is listen God gives us will he'll never take your will your wheel will always have to be in order for God to work with you you must give your wheel to him he'll never take it he will always make you allow you to make your charges whether it be good or evil thank God for his protection thank God that God even died for our iniquities hallelujah that's when we know to do good and we do it not right if I was from a below my that's what Jesus said let me go back up to this quote we live from above because we're born from above all Christians come from above Jesus said I am NOT from below I'm above if I was from a below my subjects will fight for me but my kingdom is from above so is every man that's born of the kingdom of God he's from above yeah I understand what I'm saying so if he's from the but from above he is a part of God's dynasty he he is a part he thinks like that he think that's what about said let this mind be new that was also in Christ Jesus this is what I love the Bible says Jesus wouldn't do nothing until he saw the father's doing it every thought that came from God he received it he didn't ask questions he just did what God wanted him to do even if it seemed like it was putting him in harm's way but foolishness is when you don't give God's Word the consideration that's what happened to Adam and Eve they put it this way Eve because he was deceived Adam was not but I wonder that I don't think now if I do this and I say Eve what will be the results or the end results of it I think if he had a whole a clear picture of the things that we're suffering now because of their disobedience I'm not sure on how his response would have been and maybe he did see it I don't know but my question is and what we all do we do stooop my wife said I should that's right bad word I'm trying to change it we do bad things we do bad things not realizing there is a consequence God came changes were because of us whatsoever man so he will also reap that is just the word have you ever done something wrong that mistake and you still reaped it hello you know you stumbled and you threw out some seeds you didn't mean the sword Oh Sees there but give time to grow see something's gonna happen to him and that's what happened to us sometime we unintentionally do something all because we've stopped following the Shepherd it's when you stop following the Shepherd and start falling within your own wheel in your own mind is when you make mistakes I hope I'm helping you this morning but here Belcher says our and then in their drunken party thinking God don't see God sees everything all of a sudden they were so drunk I don't know what they were thinking but a hands not come from somewhere it's not writing on the wall what happened to us the same thing sometimes we engage in things during the day and then the preacher comes and knock it for you you think somebody done told him you didn't tell nobody but Jesus knows what we do and his God coming down like the handwriting on the wall it is up to us to repent but when it came to that dish as I admit that he was right why because he crossed the line he knew better and God said because of what you've done the person's gonna take your kingdom that's right Dan you're fired not only did they take take his kingdom when he was killed the very night is that right Solomon and all his wisdom look at the end of Solomon I believe he was saved but he died in embarrassment the great man of God that produced such a season in Israel it was like the Millennium but he got caught up by making wrong decisions foolish decisions but one thing I love about Solomon he did not fail to leave us instructions and he says listen I've tried everything I've done everything that came in my mind to do and I came to conclusion the thing that I'm and to do the whole duty of man is to fear God and keep his Commandments for God shall bring every work into judgment every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil Solomon said listen I'm gonna be judged for everything I hope I'm making sense and the reason why I'm bringing this out of trying to bring it out the best way I know how because we're at the end and the Bible said that the bride of Jesus Christ will be without spot wrinkle or blemish and God can't change his word for you this is not potential it's a reality that the bride of Jesus Christ must come to a place which he has no spot wrinkle or blemish without all right she's got to be safe to fire and she's had to be filled with the Holy Ghost and she's got to come up to the Statue of a perfect man to make a rapture now I'm not saying they have many um who will lose out and not be saying no the foolish virgins what made them foolish because they heard the midnight cry and they were doll Ettore they weren't about their father's business the pub's had trimmed - laughs that means sanctify yourself trim your left cut off all the world circumcise your heart that's the Holy Ghost feel you seal you give us up your oil what I owe go buy and sell for your going get something for yourself how did you get it down on my knees hallelujah I'm telling you prayer is the key whenever you find yourself in a bit that's what David said My Lord is great I was in a horrible pick but he delivered me and he set my feet upon a rock he didn't get out of that pit by throwing a rope over there and climbing out himself pride whatever faith whatever got him in that that was his faith but he had faith to get out of it every situation you into right now you can get out of you don't have to stay there the devil will make you feel like you hopeless and ain't no way you can get out of this oh my I've been this way all my life God don't care that man who was blind 30 years was there crying all his life and God gave him sight you sure he didn't nobody educated in him he even found them fundamentally taught no sure all you had to do was fake to believe that Jesus could do it in Jesus did it well would you have a minute I want my sight that was it hallelujah that all right I wish sometimes I think you know what you say saying some things are unavoidable but we must understand that everything is planned and set by God right the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered by the Lord and if we end up in a disastrous situation doesn't mean that God can't gonna just let you stay there or I put it this way if we find ourselves in a position that we do not like to be into one thing God will do he still will talk to you what's it mean brother brother God the Bible says that the Lord knows how to deliver the righteous not out of some of the things all of them many other affliction of the righteous and God would deliver us from them all now it's up to us to believe that we can be delivered faith say you can be delivered crippled blind lame whatever you can be delivered you know it's just like people all I'm in my stage four cancer so uh if you know the deliverer I don't know maybe I'm wrong but I just say it like this if a man by the name of Hezekiah can pray and God can give him 15 more years what about you cancer is not you know it doesn't necessarily have to be you'll find or your fate and foolishness and things like that my point is if you seek God this is what I tell people I said listen if God don't tell me I'm dying I ain't dying you say why do you get that from because I look in the word and every true believer of God I believe God tells them brother Bosworth are you sick either no brother and I'm not sick I'm just getting too old to live these are you afraid to die he said I cannot die I died years ago somebody help me here but you see God had told he says look no further than him it is nothing like that I'm going home see he was a righteous man God showed him that dad had no hold on him it looked like his faith but he knew that death had no hope that was not his faith and God proved it to him before he died he was shaking hands with his relatives we can't allow anything anything Amen become a threat to us because we conquer all we are the conquerors and if you really believed that you would with God before the foundation the world and you were with him now and he's in you all things are possible I still wonder how David was able to take Sampson scuse me was able to take the jawbone of an ass and kill all those feelings stands with it it looks like a horrible situation he was into oh this is you're in there's no way you could whip all those but something happened to it faith struck him now that which look like faith became Victoria victory for him that's all I'm saying you and I have the ability to change these things but if you are foolish to believe that God can't change it it becomes your fate whatever that might be [Music] but the Benham says here he says one night on the platform I looked and Here Come on a poor Mexican old Mexican brother blind as he could be his feet bare calloused all over his old hat in his hand sewed with quartz his trouser legs tore off up there I looked at him dusty all over he was coming along the those holding his hat in his hand he was mumbling mumbling off something to the man that was bringing him when he got close to me he reached down in his pocket and got out a little kusa thick and began to say Hail Mary I had him to put it up and so he come up there and I looked at him and I thought here's a poor old fella probably never had a decent meal in his life there he is now looking not even shoes on it here I stand with good pair of shoes here I stand with a suit I believe this is the same suit brother car and Williams and his bike give me there and he says I was standing there and I thought here I could I got a suit on I thought I put my shoe shoulders and and I thought if I could fit him I should give it to him but I put my feet and the side of his and it wouldn't fit him and all and I thought what could I do and I thought there he is staggering in blindness poor old fella you've got to feel for the people you see you got a feel for if somebody's in the situation is in bad circumstances you got a feel for why you are the deliverer because the deliverer is in you if we don't think ourselves to be sons of God if we don't think we can change the atmosphere if we don't think that we can change the fate of people then who are we what are you here for because listen in the Bible everybody can't jesus came in contact with was changed something happened to them especially when they were coming for the change huh oh what about the woman at the well what about the woman in Simon's house they're faint whatever happened plunged him into being prostitutes but faith brought it out faith delivered them out of that right by somebody else's foolish decision they were plunged into a dark situation oh it's true and it's not always somebody else's fault or the person's fault sometimes somebody else makes it let me put it this way what about those four hundred men preachers that that that literally refused the message of the hour and they went back preaching and the Bible says the blind leaders lead the blind they over there and everybody's shouting and dancing and speaking in tongues and running and everything else pay the costos but the faint but those people was death because the leader right refused the word but in all of that God still have a seed and it's the seed of God that ends up into these particular situations and the Bible says everyone that has a clean heart escapes everybody that has a desire to serve God will xscape that's it that's how we escaped because of the seed of God that's in us now you say what brother was where you going with this I know I'm throwing out a lot of thinking but I'm hoping that you get what I'm trying to say see some things happen because of somebody else's foolish decision and some things happen because of our decisions right but when it comes to fate even it always because of somebody's foolishness that's how it started that's how it is people receive the mark of the beast because they make a decision and the market of beans become their fate because they made a foolish decision not to receive the Holy Ghost the foolish versions heard the message heard the word but because of their decision they went through the tribulation period see hallelujah somebody I know you're tired and it's hot in here so it's kind of difficult to concentrate I understand but let me move on I'm almost done I'm only gonna be too much longer because I want you to understand that if the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered by the Lord God will deliver you now you say well what do you mean job Joan excuse me running from the presence of the Lord he ends up into a whale of a Bennett I'm barely awake I know I didn't do that just now but I did in the belly of a whale and we find out I'm thinking about that heat folks I'm sorry but I'm you know the thing is he did not let that faint because his decision plunged him into that position right and he wouldn't loud that to conquer him you see what I'm saying you can end up into a bad position but that don't mean you can you need to let it conquer you bring out some faith bring out some faith believe God ask anything you will and he said if you believe it it shall be yours I just believe that second Kings and and I'm gonna I'm gonna close on this let me make sure I get the right one I'm working with here remember the Shulamite woman there in second Kings second chapter that Shunammite woman y'all know the law back in the day when you couldn't pay your debt you had sons they can take your sons as debt that's what the Jubilee is all about this lady husband died she she she she she couldn't pay her death and no doubt the man comes as oh I'm sorry but you either pay your debt why take your son but God always see us when we in those bad positions he always make a way of escape the Bible says with every temptation God makes a way of extending he makes a way of escape it's not that the way is already there he makes it he literally a man crafts it just for you he opened the door that you even know was there and it's up to you to go through the door and here come Elijah Elijah brother and y'all know the story he loves them listen well I'll tell you what go get me some empty vessels and I love this part because God need empty vessels he can't use you to you empty yourself he can't fill you unto you empty yourself he does that go give me some some feel that no give me some empty vessels and God is gonna feel it you see and that's the thing we fail to see that that's what God can't even work with us unto God you empty yourself these are all God I want to be great well first of all you'll never be great because you won't to be it ain't about you God in interested in your ability that's where preachers mess up that's where song leaders mess up that's where musicians mess up that's where all the gifts mess up because sometimes we get in ourselves and we think we can do it you can't do nothing if we don't humble ourselves amen before the Lord gives me out and let God do it you can always tell people get all lift it up arrogance and all that God ain't in that you now must understand Amen that God is looking for somebody who can empty themselves and do some great things I'm trying not to read Because because of the timing because what's happening but nevertheless we realize a man that God God is looking for you to once he gives you something he's looking for you to give it back to her I feel the dozens up with oil and the woman never ran out no doubt she could perhaps sell a little bit of something something you know but she gave back to God what God gave back to her I think about even even even enough when I was thinking about this tonight this little thought coming I thought oh look how beautiful God is here was a woman that we mentioned her and we ought to close with that we mentioned her how God comes along and and this woman by somebody's else's word she finds her way to Simon's house and she literally get get an alabaster box and before God can even do something I guess she just felt privileged that his she was washing the feet of a prophet the Messiah she's anointing him huh northing him and you know what this is what I just don't understand how come people come to church and they want God to always give them but they don't give God nothing it's your decision don't you know that God inhabits the praises of me you give God praise he will break your chains he will set you free oh you said what do you mean I don't care if they say you and stays for five or six if you give God the praise he will break every chain you don't break you know you don't make foolish decision oh I'm just so sick I just can't hardly take it no that's my advantage hallelujah Jordan and Jonathan care where he was I don't care if he smelt the stench of everything in the belly of the whale even he realized that God had already shown him by faith that was not his fate he's not going down that way hallelujah I don't care they're like everything's going wild and crazy but let me tell you something the Bible said that God hears the prayers of the righteous hallelujah and we're not righteous overall but when you know that the blood of Jesus Christ has covered you you can pray and believe God is going to answer because he will he will she gives that out of the bracelet oh I just I wish I was there I would have loved to see that you know you think they're gonna rehearse it when I get over there take me back time cuz you know I'm a time traveler take me back in that day so I could just see how I was actually darling wouldn't that be wonderful he can do it my thing is you know she just washed his feet and cried and everything else I don't know what kind of makeup she had on but whatever she had it was all smeared everywhere have you ever seen a woman with smeared makeup that's really horrifying yeah but anyway she went on to do everything she this is the part of M say God I let you worship if you really want to hear even let you get out of order worshipping him because he loves wash up and we're so afraid to wash it but don't you understand when you give God worship you're literally giving back to him what he's already given to you you're not been created to do so oh my I can't seem to get this over like I want to but my quote my thought is that we're in a time we use in all these examples so that you understand that no matter where you are at this point in your life we're talking about a rapture we're talking about being killed we're talking about being clean we're talking about being without spot wrinkle or blemish I don't care where you are you've got to believe that that's not your fate you're not going to remain here and God is going to bring you to victory you have to believe that your faith must strike somewhere and if they can strike Amen in the right place which is your heart it would defeat fate and deliver you from whatever condition you're into right now I believe that with all my heart hallelujah I believe that with all of my heart you don't have to remain in the conditions well I've been like this all my life God don't care about that that's a sorry excuse when Jesus passed by that woman saw him said but if I just touch the hem of His garment I'll be made whole that's all you need to touch him or let him touch you don't oh it's your truth well you know probation he had people in the prayer line they were healed but they did not have the faith to grab it so they left out sick but God had already healed to be even so we've got it heal them so oh lord help me give me something to say to that person so he gonna listen if I don't say it you think about that how how unbelief can be so strong and you have God properly tell you you healed and you won't believe it because you're looking at condition you're feeling sorry for yourself and you believe that's just your fate mmm help us Jesus help us help us help us you mean to tell me that God I take a little fishy that that guts is already pulled out and give his life and then look over you opossum a man on his way out full of wines and everything is dying and God heals an opossum stinking nasty and then we look at like this you wanna let her dump down I'll have more faith than you a dumb animal eleven that's pretty worse than that I did and God did all of those things so that you and I can know that with him all things are possible I'm pretty close so did you understand if you have a disastrous is only because you have been you've been influenced with foolish disbelieving the word then God said I've given you the expected he's giving you the word and faith will conquer fate cien brought us into this fate none of us in desire to be here it's something Adam and he did and because they did it we do it because that's the sin nature they Bobby said that Columbine can even would proceed things that are spiritual because we in image are natural fathers we do what they do but God says aren't you must be born again you must be born of it from above in order to follow me in the way that you should help us Jesus y'all hear me because the Lord is soon to come don't give up on God because he will not give up on you don't let these messages discourage you they're not here to discourage you they're here to shine the light on you to show you where you stand in God but because we find ourselves in a crippled way or put a bad place a Harvey Wallace say it doesn't mean that we must remain oh come on somebody fete a man puts you in the grave and faiths come get you out of it you love the Lord I hope I hope I was able to bless you tonight in that way I I believe God gave me that message I just feel like I don't know but I trust that something was said to make you realize that yes it seems almost impossible because you see all the things that you've got to overcome to get there but those things means nothing to God God can change things at the snap of his finger but he needs you to have faith in Him to do it is that right when it came to Lazarus amen he's not looking it looked like fate got put in there you know it looked like it's a it's a situation that can't not be resolved as a situation that's impossible in married mother we've never seen that like that he's been dead for days but you said I want you to understand I'm the resurrection I can change things just by the speaking with my voice my words would change the situation his word will change your situation and all you had to do was call laughs by name and then been dead for days worms and stinking and everything else there and then God calls him by naming he comes back to life so I said this if your situation is worse than that then maybe I can see where you can have a little problem with believing but nobody in here has a condition like that no not in your life where it seems like it your situation is so rotted and it got worms in it and if it is you believe this you believe that God that same God is gonna call the dust of the earth and it's gonna come back oh yeah Ezekiel said I saw bones they're dried bones are me wounded and killed in battle why what happened but God says still they're mine and he calls in my name and they come together and they become a mighty army and that's what I'm saying if God has called you no matter how dare you were when he got you maybe he was a dry bone maybe you had you know I don't know where you were and I don't know where you are but the same God that spoke life to you those bones speaking life to you now it's up to us to decide whether we gonna go forward let me tell you something I cannot fathom in my mind missing the rapture and that's something you do not want to miss well how are you gonna make it by His grace but I know if I have faith in Him and trust him according to his word he that begun the good work at me and favoriting believe you see I know I'm gonna make it on his word believing him trusting him yes we all have issues in our lives right now is that about right things that we need to be you know God to give us great deliverance are like I said if you can deny yourself and kill your will all your bad habits will stop it's the truth that's day that old Mexican man you know it looked like it was all over forward no doubt he suffered many days as a poor beggar God sent a man of God it's we you think awesome oh if we go to Mexico we may have maybe there'll be somebody Khalu he knew just like God knows your conditions he knows no guesswork with him and I know I'm gonna tell you something I don't know who this message is for I know it's for me and I know that God is warning you to receive like oh my god he's making away from me I'm escaping through this way by trusting his word I can't see it I may not understand it I don't need the science of it I just know that he said you'll do it I believe let's pray father we come before you he's humble as we know how Lord we thank you for your amazing grace as we have said many times we found ourselves in conditions in circumstances bad words because of our decisions finding our self in a place where fate has placed but father you said that even in those darkest times and darkest moments nor you bring light into our lives you have given us hope you've given us faith you've given us understanding of your word to trust the Lord that's the whole theme of the message only believe all things are possible things that seems like it just no change ever happen I remember the old lady Lord God who had a drunken husband came home drunk all the time no doubt she spent countless hours in prayer but one day you heard him and in that whole situation she not only proved to her husband free is that she was a Christian but in that dark moment because she stood on your word she made your word her decision her light to her God you gave her a complete victory not only just for a husband but even her friends his friends became Christians Lord let us be that way whatever suffering we gotta go through whatever we must do for that name sake let us stay with your word help us now Jesus let us not make foolish mistakes and say foolish things that put us in a position of darkness let us continue to walk in the light let us continue to have fellowship one with another Lord o God let your love divine keep us Ranas featuring Lord no matter where we are let us be determined that whatever this thing that looks like faith whatever this prison house is whatever I've done to to come to this place or maybe somebody else did it I don't know but lord I know we don't have to stay you have always come to our risk help us now [Music] / colors we may be too [Music] by the blood of Jesus you leave it man [Music] we [Music] even me [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're in [Music] [Music] you Oh [Music] Oh [Music] suppose we click on a freak there is power in the name of Jesus there is power
