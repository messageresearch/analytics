[49:07] His name
[49:09] in the dance
[49:12] now the word let means to allow now
[49:18] so the holy spirit is saying
[49:21] allow my people
[49:24] to dance the don't say and praise the
[49:27] Lord

[52:12] journey to praise His name

[52:22] the Bible doesn't say
[52:25] you might want to praise him
[52:29] you have the option to praise
[52:34] God just commanded it and he said praise
[52:38] His name
[52:47] [Applause]
[53:19] um
[53:23] about God's accomplishments
[53:28] so God is saying brag and all he said

[54:02] that's what the Bible says
[54:04] Praise Him in the dance

[1:29:29] it took years
[1:29:33] for me to study the scriptures

[1:36:01] I remember those all those times
[1:36:06] Lord if you have brother Brooks play
[1:36:09] this song send yourself
[1:36:12] but then I got too afraid message
[1:36:18] and I feel discouraged
[1:36:20] but God had to teach me
[1:36:23] about the freedom of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:27] God had to teach me what it means today
[1:36:32] [Applause]
[1:36:34] it means to have the Victory
[1:36:38] and God wants to know
[1:36:41] have I ever had that much victory

[1:38:38] God had me go to an Amish church
[1:38:42] and they've come out of the Amish
[1:38:44] community
[1:38:46] I baptized 17 of them
[1:38:50] had nothing to do with me
[1:38:53] I was just there when God did it
[1:38:58] and I preached to them
[1:39:01] the revelation of this message
[1:39:04] the Seven Seals they said so the seven
[1:39:08] churches
[1:39:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:12] and they received it
[1:39:14] and I said who wants prayer
[1:39:20] only one person came up
[1:39:24] well there must be no other needs
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:27] yeah
[1:39:29] I said is there another need that I
[1:39:32] can't see
[1:39:34] one of the elderly brothers
[1:39:39] and said I need Victory
[1:39:42] from the fear of man
[1:39:49] yep amen amen the biggest enemy they
[1:39:52] fought
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:57] they're afraid of their former pastors
[1:40:00] he was a legalist
[1:40:04] you could only wear certain colors
[1:40:07] your horses could only be a few colors
[1:40:12] if you disagree with him on anything
[1:40:17] you're threatened to get kicked out of
[1:40:19] the church
[1:40:21] and I said who else it needs Deliverance
[1:40:32] wow amen the Holy Ghost discerns the
[1:40:35] thoughts and intentions
[1:40:39] so they come up one by one hello
[1:40:43] and we prayed for them to get Victory
[1:40:49] and after that I said now that we're
[1:40:52] free
[1:40:54] I said you might not be ready for
[1:40:57] dancing
[1:40:58] and I show them how I dance
[1:41:01] [Applause]
[1:41:04] I leave as high as I can yeah
[1:41:08] David leave with all of his mouth
[1:41:13] results
[1:41:29] and so I said now that you're free
[1:41:33] let's experience a victory
[1:41:36] I said I don't expect you to dance
[1:41:44] I'm sorry brother Brooks
[1:41:48] is
[1:41:50] but it just proves messages
[1:41:58] so I so I said for the first time
[1:42:02] you are mistakes
[1:42:05] let's clap our hands and stomp our feet
[1:42:14] how would you feel brother Brook said no
[1:42:16] clapping I don't see people
[1:42:22] Brothers don't say amen I don't failures
[1:42:24] sisters don't say amen that's how they
[1:42:27] live their whole life
[1:42:29] under the fear of man
[1:42:33] thank God
[1:42:37] you got freedom here
[1:42:47] down there
[1:42:50] so for the first time I said Saints
[1:42:52] alone
[1:42:58] you should have saw their faces
[1:43:13] did you ever have that much victory was
[1:43:16] having this area comes up Hallelujah
[1:43:20] the leader comes up afterwards
[1:43:28] he said for 58 years
[1:43:34] and I've been afraid of man
[1:43:38] I thought my life would end like this
[1:43:42] oh God would just let me keep going
[1:43:51] he said but God has given us Revenue
[1:43:59] 59 years old
[1:44:01] now I'm 59 years old
[1:44:03] and now my mind is now transformed
[1:44:14] oh my God is setting people free
[1:44:19] there's 350 000. yeah
[1:44:24] Amish
[1:44:28] [Applause]
[1:44:45] because God's children
[1:44:51] Hallelujah
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:14] the second reason we need to dance
[1:45:18] it's because the word finds its place in
[1:45:20] our hearts
[1:45:23] that's why David dares said
[1:45:30] the ark returned to its position
[1:45:33] as a position did you ever think about
[1:45:35] that
[1:45:36] when was the ark previous in that
[1:45:39] position
[1:46:13] [Applause]
[1:46:41] [Applause]
[1:46:44] of the believer
[1:46:47] oh and 800 years later
[1:46:51] I play David meets Christ
[1:46:55] the spirit of melchized let's pray the
[1:46:58] message today in the ark don't laugh and
[1:47:01] says the prince of
[1:47:04] God's position
[1:47:07] oh my God
[1:47:10] what does that means
[1:47:12] what was the benefit of having the Ark
[1:47:14] Church
[1:47:16] what the Bible says
[1:47:20] [Applause]
[1:47:23] he didn't want to inquire of the Arkham
[1:47:30] he didn't want to seek God for
[1:47:32] Revelations
[1:47:35] it's just like denominations today
[1:47:38] brother you know ask a denomination
[1:47:41] can I get tattoos that's because
[1:47:44] he won't even look at the ark
[1:47:46] environment
[1:47:50] but the Bible says make no cuttings in
[1:47:54] your flesh nope
[1:47:55] [Music]
[1:48:00] see the difference we've got the art
[1:48:03] Brothers slam sisters
[1:48:10] we've got the Seven Seals
[1:48:13] got the seven churches destinations
[1:48:49] [Applause]
[1:48:57] hallelujah praise God that was the
[1:49:01] difference between David
[1:49:25] [Applause]
[1:49:32] [Applause]
[1:49:36] oh yeah amen
[1:49:41] amen amen
[1:49:44] so now you got two reasons today
[1:49:48] you're baptized amen hallelujah
[1:49:52] hallelujah the word is in its place
[1:49:58] in church there's a little nugget in
[1:49:59] there
[1:50:00] the second Samuel says
[1:50:05] verse 21.
[1:50:22] look at the end of verse 21.
[1:50:27] David tells us wife
[1:50:30] who is in the seat of the scornful
[1:50:36] who is criticizing him
[1:50:39] he said therefore will I play before the
[1:50:42] Lord
[1:50:48] the word play means to Rejoice
[1:50:54] look at the next verse so he'd already
[1:50:56] dance in the spirit with all his might
[1:50:58] look at the next verse verse 22. and
[1:51:01] I'll yet be more vile than thus it is
[1:51:10] spoken of
[1:51:12] uh
[1:51:14] of them shall I be had an honor enjoy
[1:51:19] now church this verse proves and also if
[1:51:22] I said prove that you can plan out
[1:51:25] or you can know when you're gonna dance
[1:51:29] some people say it just has to be
[1:51:32] spontaneously
[1:51:36] this verse proves
[1:51:38] David said I've already danced because I
[1:51:42] don't see it but if you didn't like that
[1:51:44] message
[1:51:45] I'll do even more damage
[1:51:49] [Applause]
[1:51:52] he said if you don't like my tapes
[1:52:10] yes sir and he tells us
[1:52:13] he said because I was not dancing for
[1:52:16] you
[1:52:22] I will play
[1:52:25] I will laugh
[1:52:29] because I'm rejoicing in God
[1:52:34] Amen that's how David is
[1:52:38] I hope that helps somebody
[1:52:41] so I planted on our church I said we're
[1:52:43] gonna have a dance service

[2:11:16] yes sir that's what's happened for me
[2:11:21] I went through awful Seasons
[2:11:24] battle critical Spirits
[2:11:28] I battled church people
[2:11:34] God
[2:11:57] [Applause]
[2:12:00] amen
[2:12:09] [Applause]
[2:12:24] [Applause]
[2:12:34] [Applause]
[2:12:36] put up Ecclesiastes uh don't don't leave
[2:12:47] this is the will of God
[2:12:50] it's God's will
[2:12:52] for you to have a season of Victory
[2:12:55] [Music]
[2:12:56] there's a time to weep Church
[2:13:00] there's a time to laugh yeah
[2:13:04] there's a time to mourn yeah
[2:13:11] the opposite of Dance
[2:13:16] so the Bible says you're either in one
[2:13:18] of those seasons
[2:13:23] are you in a season of mourn now someone
[2:13:25] might expect the Brotherhood
[2:13:31] in the morning no doubt yeah that's
[2:13:34] awesome
[2:13:36] and so we should more with him
[2:13:40] but God promised
[2:13:42] by his grace he'll bring us to a season
[2:13:46] of Dancing
[2:13:47] says on the doors
[2:13:51] that's how the world works
[2:13:53] every year there's four seasons
[2:13:58] when it's negative 10 degrees here
[2:14:03] you're frustrated
[2:14:26] [Applause]
[2:14:35] [Applause]
[2:14:51] the fourth reason people dance
[2:14:56] it's because I want to be like Jesus
[2:15:01] you say oh Jesus never danced preachers
[2:15:05] I beg your part
[2:15:08] go to Proverbs chapter eight
[2:15:12] in verse 22.
[2:15:16] the Bible says eye wisdom
[2:15:19] spirit of God
[2:15:23] was with God
[2:15:24] before the foundation
[2:15:28] who knows where I'm going with it
[2:15:31] verse 30.
[2:15:34] this is Jesus talking Jesus we keep out
[2:15:37] this is the low God's talk
[2:15:41] so the logos was before God
[2:15:44] the first thing that there was was light
[2:15:49] God said let there be life
[2:15:53] brother random tells us who that light
[2:15:55] was
[2:15:57] the logos that was the son of God that
[2:16:02] was the Holy Spirit
[2:16:03] invisible form those uniform and zebra
[2:16:07] and Jesus said then I was by him
[2:16:10] as one brought up with him
[2:16:14] and I was daily his delighted
[2:16:22] amen that word rejoice
[2:16:26] song
[2:16:37] so just like shouting religions
[2:16:42] started before the foundation
[2:16:47] started
[2:17:02] he's talking about the logos logos he
[2:17:06] said this little Halo comes
[2:17:09] I didn't see nothing yet
[2:17:12] just by the eyes
[2:17:14] of Supernatural
[2:17:17] we see a Halo standing here
[2:17:22] now that's the Son of God
[2:17:25] the logos
[2:17:42] so if those first three reasons
[2:17:49] [Applause]
[2:17:57] if Jesus was the first dancer
[2:18:01] then that gives me permission today
[2:18:12] repair
[2:18:15] [Applause]
[2:18:21] he dance back and forth
[2:18:25] amen I love you Daddy oh it's your damn
[2:18:27] bath
[2:18:29] he just played before
[2:18:32] [Applause]
[2:18:35] he says Watch Me dance Daddy
[2:18:39] go like this
[2:18:42] and then he'll throw himself on the
[2:18:44] floor
[2:18:46] take a video on me Daddy
[2:18:54] that's like Jesus
[2:18:56] Jesus
[2:19:01] just read that logos I'm the image
[2:19:06] and when you dance Hey Kung Fu don't say
[2:19:09] proves it's a pool nor the image
[2:19:12] Heavenly Father
[2:19:18] oh you need another witness okay
[2:19:23] one verse is enough okay Solomon
[2:19:28] [Applause]
[2:19:30] they can't take the contig two verse
[2:19:33] eight
[2:19:35] continu
[2:19:39] Ed in the mouth of two or three
[2:19:40] Witnesses
[2:19:43] let every word
[2:19:48] foreign
[2:20:01] he says I've come into my garden
[2:20:05] I've eaten and I've I I've opened my
[2:20:08] garden
[2:20:10] so before that they were in courtship
[2:20:16] they were courting before marriage
[2:20:20] and the bride would Daydream

[2:21:33] I'm gonna hear him
[2:21:36] he's gonna come off the
[2:21:39] mountains
[2:21:41] [Applause]
[2:21:48] God is rejoicing
[2:21:51] the Bible says God rejoices
[2:21:55] the Bible said God sings over here
[2:21:59] so why would he not dance over here
[2:22:06] just like the Angels were the first
[2:22:08] shouters
[2:22:09] like just like the Angels
[2:22:16] is the oldest religions

[2:24:12] verse Joy of our heart is cease our
[2:24:15] dances

[2:24:23] but then the next verse says
[2:24:27] almost fallen off our head
