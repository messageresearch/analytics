How many happy to be in the house with the Lord? Amen. I don't sing a lot, but this song just goes along with my sermon for tonight. So, I trust it's going to be a blessing to you. The news came to Jesus. Please comfort. [music] Lazarus is sick and without [music] your help he will not last. Mary [singing] and Martha. [music] Watch their brother die. They're waiting [singing and music] for Jesus. He did not come. And they [music and singing] wonder why. Oh, the death watch was over. [music] Oh, [singing] buried for days.

[music] [bell] Oh, Lazarus [singing] comfort that somebody [music] said he's alive. He's alive. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; for [singing] days [music] [bell] and all hope is gone. [bell] Oh Lord, we don't understand [music] why you've waited so [singing] long. Oh, by his way, God's [music] way. But [singing] now you're so mine. Oh, isn't it great when [music] they late, but he's still on time. Oh, you may [music] be fighting a battle of me. [bell] You've cried to the Lord. [music] I need you right now. But he has not appeared. [music] [bell] But friend, don't be [singing] discouraged, cuz [singing] he's still the same. [music] He'll soon be here. [bell] He'll roll [singing] back the stone [music] and he called out your name. Oh, and his [singing] poor days and [music and singing] all hope is gone. And you [music] say, "Lord, I [singing] don't understand [music] why you waited so long." Oh, by his way, God's way. [music] I so mine. [bell] Oh, isn't [singing] it great [music] when he's 4 days late, he's still on time? Oh, isn't it great [music] that I'm serving a God that's always on time? [bell] God [music] bless you. standing. How many are happy to be serving a God that's always on time? You may think he's late, but according to his schedule, God is never late. He's an ontime God. Let's turn our Bible to Jeremiah chapter chapter 29. uh 29 verse 11 and I'll try to be short &gt;&gt; and just to try to encourage you tonight. So Jeremiah 29:1 says, "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, &gt;&gt; to give you an expected end." &gt;&gt; Amen. I like I like how the Amplified Translation reads. He reads like, "For I know the plans and thoughts I have for you, sayeth the Lord, plans for peace and well-being and not for disaster." So God has a plan for each one of us. It's a plan for plan of peace and well-being and not for disaster to give you a future and a hope. And again, I like the the French translation that says so it doesn't just says I know the thoughts, but the French says I know the project I have worked towards you. So God is a project for each and every one of us. Thank you father Lord. as I surrender myself to you, Father. And I pray, Lord, that you have full control over the service and that you bless your children, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; as you have made an appointment with us that wherever two or three are gathered in your name, Father, you told us that you will be there. Not not that you will just send your angels, but you personally will be there. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for being here, Lord. as we pray in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may still uh stand. Let's go to the next scripture which is Ecclesiastic uh Ecclesiast chapter 3 &gt;&gt; and I'll just read the amplified version but feel free to &gt;&gt; so the Bible in verse one says that &gt;&gt; there is a season and a time appointed for everything and a time for every delight and event or purpose under heaven. You may have your seats. &gt;&gt; So my title for tonight is going to be &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ always keeps his appointment. That's that's I was reading a place where the prophet says that's something I can rest assured on that Jesus always keeps his appointment. And then you see when Jesus created the heavens and the earth like he had a whole plan. You know, God is the best events planner that that ever existed. You know, there's no there's no hazard or coincidences with God. Everything that happens in the life of a Christian, there is a reason for it. It's part of the the plans of God. &gt;&gt; Even the the things that seem as if it's it's going the wrong way, it's still part of God's plan. You know, we humans when we try to plan things, sometimes coincidence can can come in the way. But I believe in a God that knows the end from the beginning. And so he had this whole plan of redemption or this whole plan on earth and he has planned every single event. That's why even before I remember one time when people challenged the the prophet wanted to challenge the prophet when the first time the pillar of fire appeared God gave a vision to the prophet and told him exactly where everybody would be seated. No, that event had to happen in order for us to have the picture of the pillar of fire. So, I'm here to remind you that you're not here just in by coincidence. God knew exactly the sit where you'll be seated. God knew the type of clothes that you will be wearing. Why? Because it's part of his purpose. It's part of his plan. But you know his plan, he says it's to give you a an expected end. You know, the prophet says in the message the the oneness of unity. &gt;&gt; He says in paragraph 11, he says, "And you know, that's God's plan." &gt;&gt; God wants people to be one. &gt;&gt; And it's strange to think, but the devil tries to put his plan into existence and make the people one under his plan. Now look what he says. He says, "Now God has a plan and the devil also has a plan." &gt;&gt; You know, and he says the devil is trying to get all the people under his plan while God is trying to get people to be one under his plan. I don't know about you, but I want to be under God's plan. Why? Because in the plans of God, even when I fall short, he is merciful to me. &gt;&gt; You know, one time they even asked David who did he want to be uh uh under which which plan did he want to be under? Whose mercy, you know, under God's punishment or under man's punishment? You know, but David had chose the plan of God. &gt;&gt; Why? Because when God makes you go through an experience, when God makes you, the Bible says that for every temptation there is a way of escape. And in this beautiful plan of God, he says that your his mercies are new every morning. So that every time when I fall short, I know that the mercy of God is new every morning. So, let's go back to uh the Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and continue that chapter. &gt;&gt; So, there's a season, a time appointed for everything. &gt;&gt; And I I like he even used the word for every event. So, this Wednesday evening was part of God's plan. &gt;&gt; He says, "A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted. &gt;&gt; A time to kill and a time to heal. &gt;&gt; And a time to tear down and a time to build up. So there's a time where there's a time where you got to tear things down. And I know we're here to tear down the kingdom of Satan, you know, and to build up the kingdom of God. and a time to weep and a time to laugh. So according to God's plan, there's a contrast to everything. That's why in Psalm chapter 30, I believe David says that weeping weeping may endure for a night by by joy comes in the morning. So don't be too sad for too long. But I'm here to tell you that God has a plan for everything that happens to you right now. It may just be that you're in a season of weeping. &gt;&gt; It may be that you're in a season where you're sad, &gt;&gt; but but you're not just to be in that season forever. &gt;&gt; David tells me that there is going to be a time where joy will come when things are tore down. The Bible tells me there's going to be a things where things a time where things will be BUILT UP. SO LIFT up your head, you know. Don't be too sad about the situation that you're going through right now. JUST KNOW THAT THE BIBLE says that I am not to be here forever. But what I need to ask God is, God, teach me to be patient. No, teach me to to be patient because this is part OF YOUR PLAN. GOD DOESN'T want you to complain based on your circumstances. God doesn't want you to complain based based on your situations but he wants you to trust him who is God. God is the word. So that's you know that's why we get the devil agitated with you is when you are walking in the valley of the shadow of death. YOU ARE STILL SMILING. YOU ARE STILL HAPPY. WHY? Because you know that you you you don't have to stay there forever. Yeah, there is there's going to be a time where the light will come. The Bible even says that in the evening time shall the light shall be there. There shall be light. So walk as a Christian. Walk through your trials as a Christian. That's what makes you that that's what makes the difference between a mature Christian and a baby Christian. Don't walk with your head down all the time. Walk like a son a son of the king. So he has a plan for everything that happens in our lives. You know that's why even in my own experiences I've had like my first car that I had like my sister had an accident two actually all my cars my sisters my women have had accidents with my my cars and then my my sister I think one time she had an accident with one of my cars &gt;&gt; and I'm I'm sure she was really mad and she probably thought I was going to be mad at her, but I just couldn't be mad because I understand that it's God who gives and it's God who takes away that there's nothing she could have done to prevent that. Why? Because I believe that it's just part of God's plan. It's part it's a trial. It's things that it's God. If you have a car, it's God that decides to give you a car. If you if you have a house, it's God who decides to give you a house. If you have a job, it's God who decides to give you the job. &gt;&gt; And then one day you MIGHT LOSE YOUR JOB, BUT DON'T DON'T PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN. JUST SAY THANK YOU. That's why the Bible says give thanks in all things. Whether he gives or he takes away, I still thank the name of the Lord. Rather, it's a time to tear down or a time to build up. I thank the name of the Lord. A time to mourn and a time to dance. A time to throw away stones and a time to gather stones. A time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing. A time to search and a time to give up as lost. So sometimes even when you look for something you don't have to keep looking forever. Some there is a time where things are to be found and things sometimes you cannot find them. That's why we call them lost you know even even Jesus doesn't go after all after the lost. &gt;&gt; What I mean by that is that there are some who are already predestinated to be lost. They are the seed of Satan. He doesn't bother going for them because he understand it's a time to be lost. A time to keep and a time to throw away. A time to keep silent and a time to speak. A time to love and a time to hate. A time for war and a time for peace. Now let's skip to verse 11. He says but then he has made everything beautiful and appropriate in its time lord I lost my job. &gt;&gt; Oh that's very beautiful. Lord I lost this and that. It's very beautiful because it says all things works for good to them that love God. So this message is just to to encourage you. I don't know whoever who is going through situations. He has also planted eternity. &gt;&gt; And this is what the amplified version says, a sense of divine purpose. heart. Now this is what the amplified version explains in the that verse says it's a mysterious longing which nothing under the sun can satisfy except God. The prophet has explained to us that every Christian you know that's why you know I I think people are leaving the message because they don't read their Bibles. Because everything that the prophet preached is in is in the Bible. &gt;&gt; You know when I when I saw this I thought about the message the pre the prophet preach on thirst. &gt;&gt; He says that every man that is born has God has put in his heart a thirst for God whether you want IT OR NOT. I wonder if he took it from this verse. mysterious longing which nothing under the sun can satisfy except God. The prophet says that some try to satisfy with alcohol. Some try to satisfy with the THINGS OF THIS WORLD. ONLY God can satisfy that curse. There's nothing in this world that will ever take the place of God in your in your heart. So there's a time for everything &gt;&gt; in the message um the mighty conqueror &gt;&gt; paragraph 140. So my subtopic is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever because I want to know that if he kept his appointment back in the Bible he's still the same today. You know, don't put God as a God of THE PAST. DON'T PUT JESUS as the God of as the Jesus of the past. But he's the same today and he's here in this building right now. The Bible says that and if this Bible said he is risen from the dead that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He's got to be the same in resurrection. He's got to be the same in power. He's got to be the same in principle. And I love this part. He says, sorry, my bad. He said, he has got to be the same in every way except his corporal body. I rest on what the prophet said. He's got to be the same in every way. So if Jesus was always on time to all of his appointments, if he's got to be the same in every way today, JESUS IS ON TIME IN MY LIFE. JESUS IS ON TIME IN MY SITUATION. Jesus in your is on time in your whatever things you've been praying for. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT HE'S not late. He's right on time. His time may not be your time. HIS WAY is not your way. You know, but he's on time. I'll read a quote where the prophet says Jesus Jesus always get to places early. He says that sometime he would even leave glory sometimes he would leave glory a few minutes early so he could be on time. Hallelujah. The prophet says in the message of believers thou this he says if you look the word if you look at the word was way back there. and Christ lived years ago and he's not today. So if you're saying that Christ lived years ago but today he's not leaving and you say and you say he's not the same yesterday, today and forever. That's just what you'll get out of it. So if to you God is a God of history, when you read the Bible, you just read the Bible like you're reading a history book. That's why then you will not get any experiences with God. He says it's not to be looked as history. This book change the way you read the Bible. You want to go anywhere with God, change the way you look AT THE WORD. THIS IS NOT TO BE looked off as a history book. It's it's it's to be get down and look up to it and believe it. So Lord, help me to believe your word. help me to to bring this word to quicken this word in my LIFE SO that I also can have a testimony that Jesus always keeps HIS APPOINTMENT YOU KNOW it's not enough to just read books he stories where Jesus kept his appointment what good does HE DO TO YOU I WANT A GOD THAT IS alive today &gt;&gt; and I WANT A GOD THAT ALWAYS KEEPS HIS IF GOD BE GOD, then where are THE MIRACLES? IF GOD be God, then where IS HE? IF GOD BE GOD, then where is he in your life? Where is he IN THIS CHURCH? Where is the manifestation of the Holy Ghost? THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THESE SIGNS SHALL follow the believers, not the believers following the signs. getting Jesus Christ out of history in the unwelcome Christ. The prophet says, "Notice Jesus had entered this Pharisee home." I believe he he left a little early. He's never late. It's right before paragraph 42, you know. He said he's never late. If you believe the prophet to be the prophet of God, then this word should comfort me to know that I can count that Jesus will never be late in my situation. So then why worrying? Why worrying when Jesus is telling you that it's not over yet? Why worrying when Jesus is TELLING YOU I AM still planning to be there on time? You know, maybe maybe when you don't see Jesus in that situation yet, then that means that the time has not yet come because he always comes on time. And Jesus always keeps his appointment. The Bible say Jesus is here tonight. How many believe that Jesus keeps his appointment no matter how or WHERE YOU ARE? IT DOESN'T MATTER THE SITUATION that you're in. Jesus always keeps his appointment. He kept his appointment with Jonah in the belly OF A WELL. He kept his appointment with Daniel in the lion's den. And then he's here tonight. Wherever two or three are gathered together in my name, I'll be IN THEIR MIDST. THAT'S OUR APPOINTMENT, you know. So, WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT with the King of Kings. Jesus keeps his appointment always. Now, look at what he says. He says he leaves glory maybe a little early so that he can get here on time. &gt;&gt; I wonder if this is why the prophets always advise on coming to church early because we have to be like Christ. He leaves glory a little bit. &gt;&gt; So I'm I'm here to tell you that Jesus is not late in your situation. He's not He's not late. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; Lift up your head. Cheer up. Be of good courage. I'm here to announce to you that Jesus is on his way. I'm here to announce to you. HE WILL EVEN leave his glory a little early to meet you in your situation. So let's let's let's let's read at a few examples in the in the Bible where Jesus had a few appointments. You know remember Jesus had his whole plan and in his plan in this plan he has he has written maybe on a planner somewhere on this specific day I got to go to Iowa City. &gt;&gt; I have to go to walk to higher ground higher ground. Let let let me explain that. Let's read the John chapter 4 verse4 with the story of the woman at the well. The Bible says when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John. Verse one. Though Jesus himself baptized not by his disciples, he left Judea and departed again into Galilee. But then verse four, remember he has a God has a planner. &gt;&gt; He has a plan for everything. And in his plan be because he says I never did anything before the my father revealed that to me. &gt;&gt; So in other words it's like I never did anything without checking my plan first without checking the the plan what what was I supposed to do today and that day he sees that and he must need to go through Samaria. So according to his plan today I have to go through Samaria but remember but remember the Jews didn't have anything to do with the Samar Samaritans you know so usually when the Jews used to go through uh uhh to Galilee because Samaria was between uh what's the city Judea and Galilee they usually bypass Samaria to go to Galilee But then Jesus that day, he was like, I must go there. I have an appointment. I have an appointment with someone in that city. And because I have a reputation that I never miss my appointment, I am a respector of no persons. I don't care what the Jews have between the Samaritans and the Jews. must arrive at my appointment. Then he cometh to a city of Samaria which is called &gt;&gt; Sichar. Let's skip uh to verse seven. Now you see that the verse seven says there there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. So remember I said there's no coincidence with God. &gt;&gt; SO how come just around the same time that Jesus maybe the only time he had to go through that city to that well the the the only opportunity for this woman to to get in contact with Jesus and somehow she happened to find herself the same place the same moment where Jesus said to be there. What was it? It was God. The great planner who always works on both ends of the line and he's like Jesus is coming this way and he's putting in the heart of the woman, the Samaritan woman around the same time to go get water. Brothers, you're not here on by coincidence. &gt;&gt; There's a reason why only you could be here to this Wednesday. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God orchestrated the whole thing. &gt;&gt; And what did he do? &gt;&gt; This woman was a woman that that was living with multiple husbands. &gt;&gt; You know, she had, I believe, six husbands. you know and then God was able Jesus was able to discern her her life and then her life was changed. She just needed one one one appointment with Jesus. That is you don't need multiple appointment with Jesus. Just one encounter with Jesus is enough for you. You know, a lot of people claim to have encountered Jesus. &gt;&gt; But to truly encounter Jesus, you will never be the same. This woman went from living a a life with multiple husbands to being convinced that Jesus was the Messiah. So that's the first example of Jesus keeping his appoint. second appointment that Jesus said. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Luke chapter 19. &gt;&gt; The story of Zakius. &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 19. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. &gt;&gt; And behold, there was a a man named Zakius, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. He sought to see Jesus who he was &gt;&gt; and could not for the press because he was little of stature. And verse four says, "And he ran before and climb climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him." Look what I like. I like what the Bible says, "For he was to pass that way. In other words, for he had an appointment in that city. You know, the Bible is precise on everything. It even says for he had to pass that way and when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him and said unto him, &gt;&gt; so imagine this guy that was too short. He's on a place thinking that no one can see him. But Jesus knows everyone of of he of his of his son. He says he'll never lose anyone. You can never hide from God. If you are God, he's always going to find you. You don't find God, but he finds you. You know, Zakius probably didn't think it was that important. that Jesus probably that day he had to look at his planner again. He's like, I have to go through Jericho because I have an appointment with my son. Even though my son was not in a condition where he was serving God, God still had an appointment with him. So it doesn't matter your your your circumstance. It doesn't matter how deep you are in sin. The day that God has appointed you to be delivered of all those sins, you will be delivered. There's not enough demons in hell to keep you from being delivered. God's purpose will always prevail. He said, "And when Jesus came to the place, he says, "Look up." He saw him and said unto him, &gt;&gt; he said, "Zakius, &gt;&gt; make haste &gt;&gt; and come down." Why? For today when the day that was appointed for you. The Bible says there is a season and a time for everything. So that was Zakius day. So everyone of every one of you, you have a day appointed with the Lord Jesus Christ and no one is going to take your place in that day. There were multiple people on the roads, but no one could take Zaki's position. There were even maybe way taller people in the land that day. But the world would say it was coincidence that somehow when Jesus walks and he just gets by the tree where the tree where Zakius was and he looks up to Zakius it's not coincidence. He knew you know he says he says for today I must abide at thy house. Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever. Every one of you, you have a day that the Lord must abide in your house. The Bible even says that in that they do not resist the Lord. You know, some resist the Lord. And the Bible says that in the the the the the children of Israel in the wilderness, they failed to enter into that REST because they didn't believe in the Lord for that day. But but the Paul says, "But you do not hearken your harden your heart." You have a day that the Lord is going to come to your house. But I might say, "Lord, prepare me. Lord, prepare me for the day that you're going to visit me. That's why THE BIBLE SAYS that the bride had to make herself ready. &gt;&gt; Lord, prepare me and he made haste and then look, Jesus didn't tell Zakius. Zakius, slowly come down from the tree. &gt;&gt; Make haste. That's why the Bible says the prophet repent quickly. When the Lord knocks at your door, if you wait too long, he's going to move right on and you will be left behind. Amen. You know, and because he had an a time appointed in verse 9, he even says, "And Jesus said unto him, this day is salvation come to this house." Remember the subtopic is Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. You have children that you want to be saved. I'm here to tell you that there's going there's a day appointed for them where you too you can be like Zakius. You can be like today salvation has come into my house. So stop looking at Jesus as the Jesus of history because the purpose is that he will just be a Jesus of a history to you but he's the same today and today and forever. Lord, I also need you in my house. I'm here to tell you the Lord is on his way. There is a day appointed for your children to be saved. There is a day appointed that you can also say salvation has come into my house. For so much as he also is a son of Abraham. So that was the second appointment. So so far we know Jesus keeps his word. He keeps his appointment. And you may wonder you know some you know sometimes the way with Jesus is he may let you may only have a few minutes left on earth. It seems like not even left on earth but it seems like in your situation time is running out. It keeps on looking worse and worse. The third appointment was the thief on the thief on the cross. Things started getting worse and worse for the thief. The first the first event he went to steal or he did whatever wrong he did and then the second event he was caught. Oh, I used I used to steal but I never got caught. But then today I got caught. &gt;&gt; So things are getting worse for me. &gt;&gt; But then when he he just thought that okay I just got caught. &gt;&gt; But then they're like you going to be crucified. &gt;&gt; He's like oh it's worseer again. &gt;&gt; It's worse again. And he's like, "Okay, you're going to be crucified, but if you don't meet the Lord, he knew that he was going to go to hell. He was going to be lost." Because you remember on the cross, he acknowledges wrong. HE says that Jesus didn't deserve this, but we deserve to be on this place. But Jesus knew that he had an appointment with one of his sons. That's right. Even on the cross, Jesus had an appointment. Don't be discouraged, brothers and sisters. It's never too late for God. This thief on the cross thought that it was too late for him. Maybe he didn't even know he was going to be crucified next to the Lord and Savior. And he says, he says verse Luke 23:43 says, "And Jesus said unto him, verily I say unto thee, &gt;&gt; today in my planner, &gt;&gt; today thou shalt be with me in paradise." So his situation got changed from worse to to better because paradise was a better place. His situation got changed from worst to better. There is a time for weeping. But now that was the time for joy. I am sure on the way to the cross he was crying. &gt;&gt; Oh, if only I knew better. You know sometimes when you do something wrong you start feeling guilty and you start you start crying out to God you know you start regretting Lord if I had known I would have not done this I would have not done that but then weeping endureth by for night but Jesus had an appointment with him even on the cross he was still faithful to his appointment. You know the cross you might have been might have been considered one of the weak the weakest points in in the life of Jesus that the that whole journey. You remember even in when he was praying he got so weak that he even asked if this cup may be gone away from me. He was even crying, "Father, father, why have you for forgotten me or forsook me?" He was in his weakest moment. &gt;&gt; But even in his weakest moments, he still was faithful to his appointment. What about now that he's been lifted up and now he's at the right hand of God? The pro the prophet says the right hand of God means the power of God. ALL POWER has been given to me. &gt;&gt; Now you think he's not going to keep his appointment with you. &gt;&gt; Don't be discouraged. &gt;&gt; The fourth one I'm going to wrap up very soon. We I just sang sang about that. It's the story of Mary and Martha and Lazarus. their brother died &gt;&gt; and they went to send someone to tell Jesus [snorts] about his uh Lazarus death and they told him it's he had already been two days that he was dead but Jesus kept right on with what whatever he was doing &gt;&gt; and they buried Lazarus And then Jesus, the Bible says he was four days late to humans timing according to to our timing. &gt;&gt; You remember in his time he wasn't late because you remember the prophet says the the greater your trials the the greater God is in your life. The God gets the glory in your life. The prophet says that Abraham kept having more faith the more the longer he waited. So God was Jesus wasn't late. He was right on time. And when he came, they're like, "Oh, if only you had been here, my brother would have not been dead." I wonder how many times we apply that in our situations. Oh, if only Jesus you had intervened. If only Lord you could have done this then I would have not found myself in this situation. And a lot of time we say it when we find ourselves in bad situations. But our Bible tells us that there is a time for everything. &gt;&gt; Even in that situation Jesus was like Then I tell you that you will see the glory of God. Those that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. There's there's a revelation on on patience, on waiting. You renew your strength the more you wait on the Lord. Jesus had an appointment and he was on time. &gt;&gt; And you know when Lazarus when Jesus spoke the word &gt;&gt; when Lazarus came out of the tomb the Bible if you read it he says like so he he came with all the symptoms of someone that's supposed to be dead. He was bound with like things around his hands and they even put things in his mouth. He couldn't even speak to say, "Hey, I'm alive. But my point is that &gt;&gt; when Jesus speaks a word, &gt;&gt; you know, Jesus didn't speak uh uh uh uh um Lazarus come forth and Lazarus came with all those um everything that he was done. He didn't even say Lazarus come forth again. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus spoke, there was life that was breathed in in Lazarus. his word, his life. &gt;&gt; That's why he says that if you eat of this bread, &gt;&gt; you'll have eternal life. So, he kept his appointment with Lazarus and Mary and Martha and they gave glory to God. So, as I wrap I wrap up, I'm probably going to skip something. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Another appointment that Jesus had It was with the saints &gt;&gt; in paradise &gt;&gt; after they died. Years went by. &gt;&gt; But they knew they had a promise &gt;&gt; that Jesus will come for them one day. And when Jesus died, the Bible says he went to he went to hell. And the prophet explains to us how he he he gives an illustration how he went to the to paradise. You know, the prophet says he knew he was coming near the gates of paradise where those who heeded the message of Noah uh they were waiting because they could not go up. It's in the message the mighty conqueror paragraph 49. &gt;&gt; You know the key thing it says they were waiting. What were they waiting on that appointment time that they had with Jesus? Even in hell, &gt;&gt; even in paradise, even after death, even in death, he was still faithful to to his appointment. Jesus will never fail you. And I I won't read deep into it. But the prophet says that another place the same scripture he says these are those who waited patiently for this hour. He's saying that was that was what Jesus was telling the father when he was bringing the saints to enter heaven. &gt;&gt; He says father I have finished that work that you have given me to do. I paid the debt for sin. I have the keys of both death and hell &gt;&gt; and your enemy is defeated. &gt;&gt; And now he says, "And these are those who waited patiently for this hour. Wait on the Lord. WAIT FOR THAT HOUR. He's going to come. WAIT FOR THE HOUR. Don't Don't be in a haste. Don't be in a hurry. Lord, teach me how to wait up on the Lord. There he sets the mighty conqueror, trusting in his word, believing everything he says, trusting him as my all, as my breath, as my life, as all that I have. Tonight, I fully surrender myself to him. soul, body, and spirit looking for his second coming in glory. When I'm sad, WHEN I'M SAD, I TRUST HIM. WHEN I AM GLAD, I TRUST HIM. WHEN I AM SICK, I TRUST HIM. AND WHEN I am lost, I TRUST HIM. WHATEVER BEFALLS ME, I trust him. I TRUST IN GOD. I SAW THE LORD AND HE HEARD ME. I TRUST IN GOD. BUT PUT YOUR TRUST IN THE LORD. WHY? BECAUSE HE always keeps HIS APPOINTMENT. HE'S never late. [snorts] He's always on time. He is a He has a reputation for being on time. You know, we had a situation with immigrations. It took about 10 years that we had been waiting for an answer for immigration, you know, we started getting worried, you know, with everything that that's happening with the administration administration. But in God's mind, he knew that there would be a day, there would be a day that would be appointed where we would get our papers. And he had that planned before the foundation of the world. And then in his own time, &gt;&gt; he made all things beautiful. Whatever you're waiting for, whatever you've been praying for for years, for months, for weeks, &gt;&gt; when that things come, &gt;&gt; you'll say like the song says, &gt;&gt; "Look what the Lord has done." Amen. &gt;&gt; What we've been waiting for has now come to pass. Now I can also say he always keeps his appointment. I can always say that he's the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; I was I was in need of him in for immigration. And he answered. You are in need of him. He's there to answer to you. I'm going to close with this one. &gt;&gt; We have an upcoming appointment with the Lord. We have two. We had two. One is in Luke 17:30. The Bible says in Luke 17:30 &gt;&gt; that even thus shall it be in the day that day that appointed day when the son of man is revealed. So he's not revealed any other time but there is a specific day and and if you read right before that verse he'll he give he gives us the sign whatever happened in the time of Noah Sodom and Gomorrah and we are seeing those things happening in our day. So then by reading the scripture we have a revelation or an understanding that there's an appointment for the son of man to be revealed. And in Malachi 4 verse 5-6 he says again before the grateful day of the Lord I will send you Elijah the prophet before that day I have an appointment with this generation that I will send them Elijah the prophet and The prophet explained to us that he was just a son of man revealing the son of man. What did the son of man did do? If you read the bible, if you really are a bible reader, you will see that Jesus discerned the thoughts of men. Even when he went to Pharisees, the assimon the Pharisees house when the Bible says the Pharisees were murmuring in their heart within themselves. But Jesus heard that and he spoke to them what they were remembering about. &gt;&gt; So through everywhere throughout the Bible you even Philillip and Nathaniel Nathaniel. He says where you were under the tree before Philip CALLED YOU. I SAW YOU. WHAT was that? It was Jesus in the ministry of a prophet. He was the son of man's ministry. And he promised that in our day, I have an appointment with Leicia. I have an appointment with this generation. And I have a reputation for always keeping my appointment. &gt;&gt; And when we we see the message looking for Jesus, the prophet says, "Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You believe me to be HIS PROPHET. &gt;&gt; YOU have a mighty good faith. HE SAYS NOW YOU ARE SUFFERING with a stomach trouble. Is that right? &gt;&gt; It's caused from a peptic peptic condition in your stomach. &gt;&gt; Here is now the prophet discerning what was wrong in the in the in the life of this brother. He says you also are a very nervous person. That's what's causing the stomach condition and doing that has caused you to have hemoroid hemorrhoid hemorrhoid. I see you I see you having some kind of trouble coughing. He says it's a as asthmatic condition. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And you also have a a heart trouble. &gt;&gt; This brother had a lot of health problems. But it's never too big for God. He said, "Is that right? You believe me to be his prophet? Then I see somebody standing near your side. So he's having a vision. He says, "It's a woman. &gt;&gt; It's your wife. She's got some," you know. So the same way that Jesus could see Nathaniel under the tree. Now the prophet is having a vision and he's seeing a woman and he says, "It's your wife. She's got something wrong with her on her face. and it's cancer. And he says, "Is that right? And look, your house number is 1154 on McKinley Street, this morning, this tonight. The same Lord Jesus Christ know your house address. He knows how many turns you have to make to be home. The Lord Jesus Christ knows how many turns Satan has to make to reach your house. Then he set up ambushes. He set up an ambush so that Satan doesn't get near your house. You know he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He says, "And your name is CBI." The Lord Jesus Christ is the same today. He knows your name. He knows your spouse name. He know your family member's name. He knows those that you've been praying for. He knows every one of those names. And even those that you forgot to pray for. He knows their names. You know, &gt;&gt; is that right? He says, "Go home and be made well. lay lay your hand on your wife in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Did he keep his appointment? &gt;&gt; He sent us a prophet, &gt;&gt; the son of man, which is God in a Jesus in a in a prophet form. In a prophetic form, a prophet revealing Jesus Christ to us. He kept that appointment with us. &gt;&gt; And there are many instances of like discerning if you know the message. The last one is he has we have an upcoming appointment. This is to to encourage you for the future. We have an appointment with God to s with him. He promised to come back and get his bride. He has a day appointed for it. He says, he says, "We have an appointment with him to s with him." &gt;&gt; Let's read Revelation 19:7. The Bible says, "Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come." So in other words, for that day, the day of the marriage, that appointment, the appointment with you, his bride, that appointment has come. In other words, he kept his his appointment, and his wife has made herself ready. And he say unto me, write, &gt;&gt; blessed are they which are called unto the marriage of the supper of the lamb. He has an appointment. Will you be there? He keeps his appointment. But do you? Jesus is going to be there whether you you there or not. But do you keep yours? &gt;&gt; We may stand. We have an appointment &gt;&gt; with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And in that appointment, he says there, I will wipe away all tears from their eyes. All the tears that you've been shedding, I will wipe your tears from your eyes. And there shall be no more death, &gt;&gt; neither sorrow, &gt;&gt; nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, &gt;&gt; for the former things are passed away, &gt;&gt; and he said unto me in verse six, &gt;&gt; it is done. &gt;&gt; I kept my appointment. &gt;&gt; I am Alpha and Omega. I am the beginning and the end. &gt;&gt; He keeps his appointment. &gt;&gt; So Lord prepare me &gt;&gt; so that my day when my day comes I am ready. &gt;&gt; You know the prophet I just for the sake of time I'm not going to read that quote. It's here somewhere. The prophet says he's going to let me just read that. He says that um &gt;&gt; um let me find the quotes if I even have it here. No. Okay, I'll probably just paraphrase it. I don't know where I put that. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, I found it. the the worst sinner in the city. The pro the prophet says this, "There said Jesus, dirty foot [snorts] stinking, nobody paying any attention to him." And I encourage you to go listen to the message, the worst sinner in the city. The prophet explains how we, you know, we invite Jesus and he always will come. But how do we entertain him? Many time we leave Jesus we we care about everything else but Jesus and he's there we're sitting with dirty food stinking nobody paying any attention to him. In other words, nobody paying attention to the word. Oh Jesus come in my house. But then you go a week without reading your Bible. You go a week without praying. But yet you invited Jesus to come to your house that day. You know the prophet gave a story of this one man. One time he invited Jesus for a dinner at his house. You know he invited Jesus and then he prepared a good meal for Jesus. But then he was disappointed because he Jesus didn't show up according to him. But then there was a beggar that came in the door and he asked for food. And this man said, "No, I don't have any food because what I have, I have prepared that for someone else." &gt;&gt; You know, Jesus may not come in the form that you expect to expect him to come. But he always comes. I wonder if some of us have has missed Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, if I have missed you, I pray that you come back again and condition my heart. Open my eyes that I may see you, LORD. May you maybe you came in the form of my brother. Maybe you came in the form of my sister, maybe my coworker, but I missed you. I missed you. Maybe that one day if I had open my Bible, you were going to reveal yourself to me. But I missed you, Lord. Dirty food stinking. Nobody paying any attention to him. You know, history repeats itself. I just pray that we pay attention more to Jesus. He says he was left. He left his place up there where he was ministering to the people. He walked two days down through the sun and had to start a little early. There there's a pattern to Jesus always coming early. He says he never misses an appointment. He always keeps his appointment. I love him for that. He keeps his appointment. That's the reason tonight I got confidence IN HIM. THAT'S THE reason tonight I've got confidence that the creator of heaven and earth is right here. He said he's never failed and he will never fail. But he says, "And remember, men and women, boy and girl, you got an appointment, too. &gt;&gt; You got an appointment with him. &gt;&gt; You're going to either meet him in peace here or you're going to meet him at the judgment. Whether you want whether you want it or not, God has already an appointment with each and every one of us. It's your choice. Do you want to meet him in judgment? or do you want to meet him in peace? He says, but you're going to keep that appointment. That's one thing you're going to do. So, you don't even have a choice. He says, "That's right." He keeps his Lord, prepare me. I want to make my life ready cuz I don't know when my time will come. you know, I'm sure January 1st of 2025 some people were looking forward to seeing 2026, they are no longer part of this world. How do you know you're not next? But he's given you room to repent. The bride made herself ready. by our head. Lord Jesus, I pray that you help us to make ourselves ready. Lord Jesus, I pray that you search our lives. And Father, if there be anything that's hindering, if there be anything that's hindering us from meeting you in peace, Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; Help us to be ready. &gt;&gt; Lord, you have an appointment for every one of us. in 2025. There's never been a man that was 500 years old. You will, your day will come somehow. &gt;&gt; He has an appointment. Just pray to your heart while the Lord is here and ask him &gt;&gt; to make you ready &gt;&gt; or give you the will or the the desire to want to be ready. When Jesus comes, he always comes. When Jesus comes, &gt;&gt; the tempter's power is broken. When Jesus comes, &gt;&gt; the tears are wiped away. He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory. For all is changed when Jesus comes to Oh, when Jesus comes, when Jesus comes, the tempter's power is broken. When Jesus [singing and music] comes, the tears are wiped away. &gt;&gt; He takes the gloom and fills the life [singing and music] with glory.

Bless us, Lord, tonight. Keep us and guide us. Strengthen our brotherly Paul. Strengthen his body and his spirit, Lord. Oh God, and bless him now, Lord. Father, we thank you right now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Jesus come. When Jesus comes, the temptor's power is broken. [music] When Jesus comes, the tears are wiped away.
