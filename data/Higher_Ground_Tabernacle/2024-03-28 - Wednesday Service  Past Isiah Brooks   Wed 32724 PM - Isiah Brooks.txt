TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you will love everybody we forget we forget we got so much to thank God Hallelujah listen he said there's only one thing in the world that is yet left undone that is physical death we all got to die because that was the only way God has to bring us up home that's the only Avenue we can travel is through death to get home so everything is under his feet everything except death and death has been done hallelujah the penalty of death um the penalty of death taken off and now we just go right into his presence hallelujah hallelujah so what are you saying brother when a true Christian so-called

Immortal live on this Earth A Thousand Years Jus chist I believe that listen I'm strictly a Hebrew Pro I'm I'm strictly a a millennial I believe in the Millennium I believe all these Hebrew prophets through ages spoke of that golden age and I believe we're going to have it we re here with him thousand years we just don't rejoice and the reason why we don't because con Satan Put negative thoughts in our mind when we ought to be thinking about Jesus think about him you think on him he near to you see that's why Satan constantly put all the negative stuff in your mind not the only one we go through these battles every day says put on the H Faith tells me I can never be removed Hallelujah Faith tells me Hallelujah that I am Eternal Hallelujah Faith tells me that God chose me Hallelujah Faith tells me I shall not die but live why I can live why he said if you believe on me the scriptures have said you were dead live that's what faith tells me no matter what the devil tells you listen to his lies Hey listen brother Bon was talking about when he was in the forest or the woods and he saw these old trees that once lived and it was in the dark and these trees had been burnt over and he said it was such a spooky place and he said when the wind would blow all those trees could say was right and he looked like what happened Happ we're not to allow the fires of persecution to kill us hallelujah understand me the fires of persecution come for you to step into the fire the Hebrew boys didn't run from the fire because they they said to themselves if God don't deliver me Hallelujah I Will Not Bow I have to suffer I never find myself worshiping the devil not politically socially not religiously why because you and I have been ordain God hallelujah hallelujah yes sir he said the fires of persecution them and the members have come in ritualistic form and ungodliness and burnt the bark off of them and they're nothing but a dead bunch of Representatives only to groan and moan and make a of fuss about something God's uh doing let me tell you something that is so easy to do so easy to get into the negative atmosphere all you can complain about things understand that we call the Antichrist to stop you from worshiping Christ from entering into the SP of God hallelujah brother goes on to say there the undergrowth coming up Hallelujah he said out of all that burning over those same trees Dro some seeds Hallelujah and though the trees were dead another generation am and so when the wind began to blow they got to sing and jum that that that's the kind of people that is

right Hallelujah the problem is it ain't about you doing right about him doing right in you he became our sin that we might become the righteousness of God we're not sinful are listen you got to believe this I am the righteousness of God hallelujah it's not what I look like on the outside taken place on the inside you might think I'm a hypocrite a saint been washed in the blood so have you been washed in the blood forget awake folks awake up to this blessing the message brought to us we're not supposed to be just religious happiest people in the world you've allowed Satan to take things from you you sold yourself for not the word says God will redeem you or has redeem price I didn't have to pay for my Redemption have to pay for your red given to you thank God for the resurrection hallelujah hallelujah this world Think Jesus Is Dead He's far from being dead and just a little while they're going to see Jesus going to see how alive he really is hallelujah they going to they going to realize the god they serve is only one only one there only one baptism Hallelujah I'm talking about the fire B y'all better hear what I'm saying he says listen in the resurrection of Lazarus Hallelujah he said I believe in the resurrection I believe in the bodily physical Resurrection I believe in the physical body return of Jesus Christ I believe that the his church is his representative on the earth now understand his church is a representative not representing yourself representing him why you can't just do what you want to do but the the the God of this evil age he makes us forget who we here representing but we're not children of Wrath has given us grace and mercy hallelujah hallelujah we're not vessels of Dishonor God has us vessels of Hallelujah Hallelujah he said listen I believe that his church is his representative on the earth now I believe that that church is washed BL of Jesus Christ and the church is a holy ghost filled Church PR Holiness to the very extremes he preaches it to the extreme say when you think that I'm just too hard the ghost fi Church extreme don't you think so hallu amen amen you love the Lord hallelujah hallelujah listen what he says he said God always sends his warnings that's Resurrection s his warnings hallelujah hallelujah just before the coming of Jesus he sent an angel down Out Of Heaven by the name of Gabriel so I want you to understand it's not just having the Holy Ghost but we have Guardian Angels that's why we still alive today God dispatched an angel to you you are born in this physical world hallelujah hallelujah and that Angel has always protected you even when you didn't see him protecting he's been there hallelujah hallelujah just before the coming of Jesus he sent an angel down Out Of Heaven by the name of Gabriel now minor Angels comes he said yes you see Angels everyone has a guardian angel according to the scripture he Jesus said that Angels always behold my father's face which is in heaven so you got somebody always telling on you whether it's good or bad your angel is telling him you see God has an order it's not like he doesn't know but he has an angel telling on you Hallelujah brother which what you're saying remember when the angel went before God said Lord you seen what they're doing down in God said been and wormwood Hall maybe Gabriel Michel God said no no no no no this one is for me you understand me sometimes God himself into the fire and your himself step down into the yes sir Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus that's right he said here some time ago a minister told me said brother there's no such a thing as seeing angels Angels don't lead the church the Holy Ghost leads the church I said that's right but we still have Angelic beings as Min Spirit sent from the presence of God he said well our church don't believe in that I said I don't know what your Church believes the teach you never alone and when you feel alone that is the inspiration of the devil and all of us fight that sometime or I'm telling you it is a Lie from Heaven because once you accept that lonely feeling Satan will have you looking for a companionship he he has a right demon for you y'all better hear what I'm saying he ain't going to get an angel to fellowship with you going to get some buddy demons and they going to come in fellowship with you Hallelujah and cause you to sin and cause you to get depressed everybody knows about it Hallelujah that's why the Bible says if you keep your mind on me I will grant you perfect peace hallelu Hallelujah help us Jesus new is that right he said well brother Bram Angels might have been back in Daniel's time but not since the Holy Ghost has come angs I said do you believe that philli had the Holy Ghost he said certainly I said well who was it to come him come to him who was it come to him told him to leave that great Revival having and go out into the desert to meet the Ethiopian no sir the angel of the Lord come to him the Holy Ghost believe Peter had the Holy Ghost yall hear what I'm saying I'm trying to get you to understand that this battle has been so victoriously won that whenever you need an angel God see fit to give a message but if you don't believe it God can't work with you hallelujah hallelujah but God that those things what I'm trying to say even the prophet of God said it like this your house can be so holy till angels will visit it if you keep your house holy and C it is an invitation for an angel to come visit hallelujah hallelujah glory to God he said oh he said how many believe Peter had the Holy Ghost he said all do well who was it that night when he was in jail to cut his head off the next morning they was having a prayer meeting down at John Mark's house who was it shine in there Fire Light and hovered over him and touch Dr the shackles off of him Street Angel of the Lord that's exactly the Holy Ghost because down the road when the persecution comes Hallelujah is that right that's what brother Brandon described the third pool come pool will be into his full for to see Angels I'm expecting to see the supernatural going to enter this as cowards conquers in Christ we need to wake up and know that God is on our side hallelujah hallelujah glory to God listen that early church didn't even know the power of pray the Bible said If my people and turned from their Wicked Ways heav will heal the land hallelujah hallelujah and that goes for every individual you must forsake your ways must become more consecrated preaching on you I'm saying from the pit to the back of the door God how many need more of him we need and he's here tonight I know you feel that anointing anointing the Holy Spirit what you need to do is take anointing the Holy Ghost your heart if you want the Holy [Music] Ghost

Christ is here tonight and he's here to deliver you free you f you T if you can believe it you can receive it hallelujah hallelujah wherefore Hallelujah you understand me who was Paul that great Saint 14 days and nights no moon stars or all no moon stars ever be saved was gone and he went down in the gallilee to pray and he come out and said wherefore be of a good courage but the angel of God I am by me last night fear not Paul right the angel of God told Paul that fear fear is torment God has everything under control he does you know I I I I I I was telling somebody today I have a tendency of worrying about my children but but I got to give it up y hear what I'm saying God is in control I think I heard my wife talking to somebody a sister today and they were talking about job and how job received his children they were in heaven when he got there you understand they had to die but they died partying now the devil must have know that J's children was going to go out there and party and it took them when they were vulnerable but one thing job had devil didn't recognize the saelah had a sacrifice and you've got the token your children your wife your them under the to work for wake up

situation God is our father hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah he said I I I Jesus have sent my angel to show you things that shortly come to is that right see and John started to worship

the glory of the father Hallelujah Hallelujah you can't be ashamed of that name Hallelujah that name is resurrection Hallelujah he's been dead for a long time let me say it like this even the Pentecostals have killed the day but the of Jesus Christ she possessed the power Hallelujah we've got the real Holy Ghost but you got to wake up you got realize like Samson the Covenant has been restored to you all of us I don't mean to point my fingers but I'm saying the Covenant has been restored the power of God is now in you and all Samson had to do was say oh Lord once more not from his mouth or his head from his heart and when he asked God to do it one more time from his [Applause] the Holy Ghost showed up hallelujah hallelujah he didn't leave out here without finishing his commission commission was to kill the Philistines and he did the Bible said he killed more in his death than he did in his life but in order for you to kill more you got to die to yourself what about John as I said on the ale of patmas they tried to ball him is that right they tried to boil him but they had Jesus on the inside this is where I want you to know he's at not in heaven far away somewhere you understand me you can't just limit God God is everywhere but we're talking about the person of Jesus Christ he in you Hallelujah you got to recognize this we do it all the time when we almost in a Rec or something we call in the name of Jesus you think he just dispatched himself from Heaven no he's in you he instantly stops whatever getting ready to take place though those uh Godly Saints of old they just had Jesus with them this day we got Jesus in us the power of the Resurrection is not only to translate you to heaven but the power of the Resurrection can translate you from a Revival to the desert there coming a time your automobile won't work amen your automobile won't work it doesn't mean your traveling days over understand kind of God that's in you that's not laying in

this the scripture reading you there starting at the third verse and no man in heaven no on Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there nobody Moses Joseph nobody amen nobody person no jacobob no no body the only person not Paul none of them the only person that was worthy was Jesus Christ the Lamb of God so see if they made heaven and and they weren't worthy of themselves his worthiness when they threw the crowns off their head they weren't said Worthy is Moses they Worthy is the Lamb before the foundation to re glory to receive wisdom receive hon what does he when he's receiving [Music] that I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book need to look there on and on the and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the of David had prevailed to open the and to loose the Seven Seals thereof that's where you were hiding that's where you were hiding Hallelujah and now that the seals are open is manifesting time and and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain Hallelujah having seven horns and seven eyes boy I'm so glad he didn't have six horns and six he had seven that means he included he's my horn he's my power he's my strength Hallelujah he is my Revelation Hallelujah which are the seven spirits of God sent for into all the Earth and he came and took the book out the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four Beast and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood of every Kindred people and Nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests we shall re on hallelujah hallelujah let me move on and I beheld and I heard the voice of many Ang the and the Beast and the ERS and the number of them that was 10,000 10 thousands of thousand with a loud voice is that to receive the power and Rich wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing hallelujah hallelujah let's read that together sing with aoud voice that wasain to receive power and Rich and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing hallelujah hallelujah glory to God oh Jesus hallelujah hallelujah and every creature and on Earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in there all in them I saying understand me hurt me wh Hur me everything hallelujah hallelujah oh my God thank you Jesus Hallelujah saying blessings and honor glory and power be unto him that sat upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four Beast say amen amen and four and 20 Elders fell down and worship him that live forever and ever let's give God hallelujah glory to your name Jes let that Resurrection live in US Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God rer glory to God I better read this one more scripture Revelation 10 9-11 and I went into the angel and said him give me the little book and he said unto me take it eat it and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings that's the bride so I'll say this is also symbolic of the Passover because the Passover they had to eat the bitter herbs they eat the sweetness they had to eat the sweetness of the of the meat and things of that nature and we're not feing on the bleeding bloody word of the son of manuj what he saying is you're going to have a some a glorious time but you're going to suffer you got to build a part two
