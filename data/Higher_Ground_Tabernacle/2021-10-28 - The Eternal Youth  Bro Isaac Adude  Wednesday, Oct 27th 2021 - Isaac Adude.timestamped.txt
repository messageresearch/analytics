[0:40] in you
[0:41] and then when the dove comes in you amen
[0:43] then you know and then then you'll have
[0:45] that that promise of eternal life

[0:51] the ground has to receive the wheat
[0:54] in order to reproduce life
[0:56] and you have to receive the word of god
[0:58] in your heart to produce what the word
[1:00] says it will be
[1:03] every word of god is a seed
[1:06] jesus said it was the sour
[1:08] and the sower uh went for went forth
[1:11] sowing seeds
[1:13] he said the seed was the word of god
[1:16] and now notice a corn will bring forth a
[1:18] corn
[1:19] a wheat a wheat
[1:21] a barley a barley
[1:24] whatever it may be it'll produce

[11:38] you have to follow all the process that
[11:40] he gave you amen you have to go through
[11:42] justification
[11:43] you know sanctification the baptism of
[11:45] the holy spirit but the good thing is
[11:47] that you know he promised us all of that
[11:49] and then he said that he will never let
[11:51] us go through it alone all by ourselves
[11:53] amen he's always there to guide us
[11:55] through amen in other words that you
[11:57] know you don't have to you know to to
[11:59] work hard for you to get to heaven amen
[12:02] what you have to do is just surrender
[12:04] amen you surrender yourself and then god
[12:06] will lead you through amen that's what
[12:08] we need we need to follow him tonight
[12:11] and if we do that god will always bless
[12:13] us and we will have we'll have that
[12:15] promise that you promised us about the
[12:17] eternal life amen god bless you
[12:34] hearing the gospel it never grows old
[12:38] and i tell you what sometimes we forget
[12:40] how
[12:41] beautiful it is but
[12:44] the gospel in itself is the most
[12:46] powerful message a person can bring
[12:50] i can remember
[12:53] my mother being a christian
[12:56] how i admired her
[12:58] walk in christ
[13:01] but i was a very proud person
[13:03] [Music]
[13:04] i enjoyed seeing other christians and i
[13:07] wanted to be a christian but
[13:09] i was so involved in the world
[13:12] and i didn't want to really give up my
[13:14] worldly things
[13:16] and i didn't want to be picked at and
[13:18] mocked like i had seen the christians
[13:20] picked out and marked
[13:23] i literally played the role of a
[13:24] hypocrite because of my heart i really
[13:26] wanted to be a christian
[13:29] and there were times in my life
[13:31] as the brother said when he was speaking
[13:34] i imitated the christian
[13:36] i tried not to live a christian life
[13:39] without the holy ghost
[13:42] and every time i look around i would
[13:43] fall in my face
[13:45] and then
[13:47] the reality of a christian
[13:50] became to more difficult in my mind
[13:54] and i said who could live like that
[13:57] who could live a christian life
[14:00] i didn't know that once you become a
[14:02] christian
[14:04] you don't have to live it
[14:06] but christ lives it through you
[14:09] i didn't understand the power of the
[14:11] holy ghost
[14:12] because the holy ghost come to live that
[14:14] life through you it's not you
[14:17] paul said it's not i that live but it's
[14:19] christ that lives in me
[14:21] or through me
[14:23] and once i caught that revelation
[14:26] i was no longer afraid of the holy ghost
[14:29] i was inviting god in
[14:31] and
[14:33] i can truly say that every change that
[14:36] has occurred in my life
[14:38] has not been because of my efforts
[14:41] but it's because of my prayer
[14:45] david said
[14:48] that when we fall into trouble we
[14:52] look toward the hill from which cometh
[14:54] our help and our help comes from the
[14:56] lord
[14:57] he goes on to say that the name of the
[14:59] lord is a strong towel and the righteous
[15:01] run in and they are saved
[15:03] and so i learned even now even now i
[15:06] sometimes forget
[15:08] it's not human effort
[15:10] it's the grace of god and it's the grace
[15:13] of god that changes you
[15:15] like our brother said in his ministry
[15:17] tonight
[15:19] when you commune with him
[15:21] when you fellowship with him and the
[15:23] more you give him attention the more
[15:26] revelation you get
[15:28] the greater the change
[15:30] the more praise the more worship the
[15:32] more surrender
[15:34] everything you do is more and more and
[15:36] more and the more you do
[15:38] the more he gives
[15:40] he talked about the woman at simon's
[15:42] house
[15:44] how she began to wash his feet
[15:47] then she began to
[15:49] dry his feet with her hair and
[15:52] wash it with her tears and the more she
[15:54] gave the more she gave the more she
[15:57] would give and
[15:58] then jesus asked the woman what would
[16:00] you have of me
[16:02] i'm sorry he then said unto the woman
[16:03] knowing her needs
[16:05] woman your sins be forgiven
[16:08] she didn't even have to ask
[16:11] he perceived it
[16:13] and that's how it is with god sometimes
[16:14] you get into worship and praise you
[16:16] don't even have to ask him
[16:19] he changes you
[16:20] he takes it away
[16:22] because i'm gonna tell you something the
[16:23] saints of god that one person not one
[16:26] person that i know of can live a true
[16:30] life for christ without the holy spirit
[16:34] without god in you changing you
[16:37] amen god is good
[16:40] i enjoyed the word
[16:42] thank god for our brother isaac it's
[16:43] been a while since i've heard him
[16:45] preaching i enjoyed it
[16:48] because i realize is that
[16:50] the way god brings himself in such a
[16:53] simple way when you can get it
