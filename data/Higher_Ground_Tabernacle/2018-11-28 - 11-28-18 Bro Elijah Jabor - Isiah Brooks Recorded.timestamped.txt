[1:11:50] being dalla Torian slothful it's so true
[1:11:57] how he Illustrated we rush everywhere go
[1:12:01] everywhere but when it comes down to
[1:12:03] prayer we get tired that's the working
[1:12:08] of the enemy I want to thank your
[1:12:10] brother for allowing God to use you
[1:12:12] tonight somebody has to make a sacrifice
[1:12:16] and I know that each and every time you
[1:12:19] guys come here on Wednesday it's always
[1:12:22] the same room Oh God he sees your
[1:12:29] efforts and we realized tonight amen but
[1:12:34] we can always give more always I like
[1:12:40] the way he says it and the way he put it
[1:12:42] the way prophet of God said salvation is
[1:12:46] sacrifice and when sacrifice is
[1:12:50] something that is given that's going to
[1:12:52] cause pain you know if I had ten dollars
[1:12:57] and you wanted five it won't hurt me too
[1:13:01] bad you say brother Brooks I need ten
[1:13:05] and that's all like god that's a
[1:13:08] sacrifice and giving that sacrifice like
[1:13:12] that you know God sees it and I believe
[1:13:17] that each and every one of us can look
[1:13:19] within ourselves and say Lord show me
[1:13:22] where I can give more where I can be a
[1:13:26] greater sacrifice for the kingdom of God
[1:13:30] that's what I was saying tonight as I
[1:13:33] heard the war word ministered to me and
[1:13:36] sometimes I think to myself you know I
[1:13:38] remember brother Branham I had then
[1:13:40] traveled so much and he was still
[1:13:43] driving and he was so sleepy and he said
[1:13:49] he prayed that he wouldn't give over to
[1:13:51] the lust of the flesh we would have
[1:13:55] called it high here and warned out who
[1:13:59] he called it the lust of the flesh
[1:14:02] it really shook me because I knew that I
[1:14:06] was guilty it's amazing how we could be
[1:14:12] so tired and then a friend call or
[1:14:14] somebody come by and all of a sudden the
[1:14:16] energy comes from somewhere it's always
[1:14:19] more you can give less Stan we're gonna
[1:14:26] take our ties in offense Father we thank
[1:14:32] you right now for your grace and your
[1:14:33] mercy
[1:14:34] I know prayers have gone up before but
[1:14:38] we pray a gang Lord that you bless those
[1:14:42] that give and those who have a desire
[1:14:44] has a doc desire to give bless
[1:14:47] everything Lord that is given to the
[1:14:50] furtherance of the ministry Lord and
[1:14:52] will be careful to give you the praise
[1:14:54] glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name
