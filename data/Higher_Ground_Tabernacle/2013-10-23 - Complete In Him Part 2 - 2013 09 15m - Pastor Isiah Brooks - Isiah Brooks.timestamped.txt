[2:22] things in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[2:24] amen you may be seated and uh my service
[2:28] a subject amen this morning is still on
[2:31] completion and what house will you Bill
[2:34] me uh we uh basically shared amen that
[2:39] uh we coming from the message uh why are
[2:42] people so tossed about uh we're coming
[2:45] from the message
[2:47] um
[2:48] uh uh statue of a perfect man uh you
[2:53] know we we just by the grace of God want
[2:55] you to understand that we're living in a
[2:57] day that you and I amen must understand
[3:00] what God has come to do remember amen we
[3:04] read the scripture amen where the word
[3:07] of God said that there will be a
[3:09] Ministry of administered amen unto us
[3:13] and that was the 11th verse for so an
[3:15] interest shall be ministered unto you
[3:18] abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom
[3:21] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and
[3:24] we showed you by the grace of God on
[3:27] last Wednesday how that God is calling
[3:30] us to a higher calling for those of us
[3:33] who have uh received the baptism of the
[3:36] Holy Ghost brother Branham said that is
[3:38] just the beginning we are in a maturing
[3:42] uh our maturing stage of our life and
[3:47] remember by the grace of God God we read
[3:49] there in Hebrews where the Bible says
[3:51] that they cannot be complete without us
[3:53] and brother Branham said that we are the
[3:56] age that will come into the perfect
[3:58] Capstone amen so coming through these uh
[4:02] stages in life amen we recognize amen
[4:06] that there is nothing that we can do
[4:08] uh to make these things happen you
[4:12] either are or you're not but the Bible
[4:14] tells us that God's word of how hard was
[4:18] saith my sheep Hearth my voice and a
[4:21] stranger they will not follow is that
[4:23] right so you and I must understand amen
[4:27] that it is all about hearing the voice
[4:29] of God that was one of the things amen
[4:32] that we studied this morning amen what
[4:34] made Abraham know that the God he had
[4:37] heard who hadn't he had not seen amen
[4:40] with his own eyes how did he know amen
[4:43] that that voice was God's voice it was
[4:45] by election amen if you have been
[4:48] elected to hear the voice of God then
[4:51] you will follow the voice of God is that
[4:53] right understand brother Branham said it
[4:56] like this he said that he did not come
[4:58] Amen to build uh uh uh uh uh uh excuse
[5:04] me he did not come to build an
[5:05] organization that's in the message
[5:07] statue of a burger man he said we're not
[5:10] building an organization he says I'm not
[5:12] here this morning to build an
[5:14] organization Christ never sent me to
[5:17] build an organization so I tied that
[5:20] into II Peter amen I mean yeah the first
[5:23] chapter the 11th verse he said Christ
[5:25] sent me to build individuals to the
[5:29] statue of Jesus Christ that they might
[5:32] be the powerhouse
[5:34] Dwelling Place of his Spirit by his word
[5:37] by his word built up the individual to
[5:42] that place not built an organization to
[5:45] a greater denomination but the
[5:47] individuals to Sons and Daughters of God
[5:50] he said that's the idea
[5:54] he said and to your faith virtue to
[5:56] virtue of knowledge he says well you're
[5:58] coming to a place when you begin to say
[6:00] well we don't have to accept that today
[6:02] you do have to it must be and the reason
[6:06] why I brought that out because there are
[6:08] so many ministers Amen in this message
[6:11] who are literally cutting this portion
[6:13] out and they're basically saying once
[6:15] you've got the experience it's finished
[6:17] but really the problem that God said
[6:19] when you get the experience of the
[6:21] baptism amen you're just beginning
[6:26] it is a work that God is doing in you
[6:30] I I jotted some thoughts down today this
[6:34] morning uh because uh it's not an evil
[6:37] place it's not an evil person or evil
[6:41] thing
[6:42] it is the devil
[6:45] if the devil is on the mountain the
[6:48] mountain is evil
[6:49] right if the devil is in the tree the
[6:52] tree is evil y'all understand what I'm
[6:54] saying amen like it is with God what
[6:56] makes God plays holy is because God is
[6:59] presently there is that right so
[7:02] whenever the devil is somewhere and I'm
[7:04] saying this because as long as you can
[7:07] catch this it's no longer your brother
[7:11] or your sister is that right it is the
[7:14] devil that's moving them or making them
[7:17] or causing that's the word I want
[7:20] causing them
[7:22] to do the things they do
[7:24] so your enemy is not your brother it's
[7:27] not your sister it's not your job
[7:31] or the people on your job it's the devil
[7:35] oh come on somebody that inspires them
[7:39] because of your prayer
[7:44] you said Lord I want to be just like you
[7:49] God said come along and take the trip
[7:51] with me
[7:52] right because he's building you he's
[7:55] making you he's creating you and he is
[7:58] the only one that knows where the
[8:01] darkness is in your life
[8:04] nobody else knows the heart like God
[8:07] does hallelujah and once you begin to
[8:11] look at the calls
[8:13] the calls you can take a better attitude
[8:16] with all of your trials with all of your
[8:19] tests you can have a better attitude and
[8:23] you can say thank you Jesus
[8:27] in the midst of all the storms how often
[8:31] have we ever heard how often we've heard
[8:33] where Satan can't even try you without
[8:35] going by God
[8:37] God must give his permission for you to
[8:41] be tested and tried oh the devil did the
[8:44] devil did know your prayer did
[8:48] and the will of God
[8:50] because it is his good pleasure
[8:55] is that all right see we're talking
[8:57] about coming to a place of completion
[9:00] and I said by the grace of God we
[9:03] looking at the Raptor win it's going to
[9:04] Rapture going to take place looking at
[9:05] all the historical things in the world
[9:07] that ain't what's holding the Rapture
[9:09] back was holding the Rapture back as you
[9:12] and I
[9:15] God can't Dave that went on before us of
[9:19] the the seven churches can't even get up
[9:21] out of the ground until this bride reach
[9:24] her potential
[9:25] her expectancy amen amen she must come
[9:29] to Divine love and when she comes to
[9:32] that place then the other ones can get
[9:34] up because brother Branham said God
[9:37] built the church through seven Church
[9:39] ages right emphasis was Faith right come
[9:43] on all the way up to brotherly kindness
[9:46] which was the Philadelphia age
[9:49] he comes all the way up to the
[9:51] Pentecostal y'all understand what I'm
[9:53] saying amen so you and I must understand
[9:56] what God is doing
[9:59] each age had a virtue that's brother
[10:02] Branham amen come on Amen each age had a
[10:05] virtue going all the way up after your
[10:09] faith virtue and he said that's the way
[10:11] God builds the individual
[10:14] now we can just say oh praise God I've
[10:17] arrived but if you still got a temper
[10:19] you haven't arrived
[10:22] come on somebody if you still got places
[10:25] in your life that's dark there and it's
[10:27] ruling you you have not arrived you
[10:30] might be on a journey
[10:32] but you're not there yet I'm talking
[10:34] about Rapture material
[10:37] what are you saying the Bible said be
[10:39] perfect even as your father which is in
[10:41] heaven is perfect
[10:42] I think that's Matthew 5 48 but
[10:45] nevertheless and you and I must
[10:48] understand Amen to God is saying be
[10:50] perfect and brother Randall said if God
[10:52] requires you to be perfect he has to
[10:55] make a way
[10:57] Hallelujah and he is the only one that
[11:02] was perfect so in order to be perfect
[11:04] you must have the perfect one where in
[11:08] you
[11:12] see now listen he said so see he don't
[11:16] have to and I want you I don't want you
[11:18] to worry about because I want you to
[11:19] understand that what I'm working with is
[11:21] a seed see the seed of God first of all
[11:24] must be in you in order for God to work
[11:27] it he germatized that seed when you said
[11:31] Lord Jesus I receive you as my personal
[11:33] Savior and you confess it with your
[11:35] mouth and believe in your heart at that
[11:37] point brother random says you have
[11:39] passed from Death unto life but that's
[11:41] just the beginning
[11:44] when God's life comes into that seed now
[11:48] it's ready to grow
[11:51] so amen like he said in the second
[11:54] coming he said I give you a Akon and you
[11:57] have an in-country potentially
[12:00] but it isn't but it's in the sea form
[12:04] you can say you have actually got a tree
[12:06] right you can't say you have actually a
[12:11] god of tree until the seed has produced
[12:14] a tree
[12:16] see so this message didn't come just to
[12:19] identify that you are the seed of God it
[12:23] also came to Quicken the seat and to
[12:26] mature the sea is that what brother
[12:28] random said he comes along right and now
[12:31] he says listen I come to build
[12:32] individuals to the statue of Jesus
[12:35] Christ
[12:36] Paul said it was going to come it came
[12:39] Hallelujah and if these things be in you
[12:43] the Bible says you will never fail
[12:45] you'll never falter amen you'll be
[12:47] perfect even as your father which is in
[12:49] heaven is perfect
[12:51] oh my
[12:53] right
[12:55] it goes on he says listen it's only for
[12:59] the bride this is not for denominational
[13:01] churches amen is that all right he says
[13:05] listen Amen in the message token he says
[13:07] I have obtained this faith and I'm
[13:10] addressing this this to them that has
[13:13] obtained the life that precious faith
[13:15] I'm not to to the outside world this is
[13:19] to the church those that are in Christ
[13:22] Grace and P be multiplied unto you
[13:25] through the knowledge of God and
[13:28] remember brother Graham said it can't be
[13:30] just any kind of knowledge this
[13:31] knowledge got to be God sent and if you
[13:34] listen to the message amen a statue of a
[13:37] broken man brother man said I said
[13:39] outside I was out there in the woods I
[13:41] waited for him this is what came to me
[13:44] he sent this to me I had a jubilee time
[13:47] he said I was so loud and I had such a
[13:49] shouting time he said I probably scared
[13:51] the squirrels away
[13:55] so this man wasn't giving you an us he
[13:58] wasn't giving out his thoughts
[14:00] he was literally relaying the thoughts
[14:03] of God to us and this is not something
[14:06] that is optional this is a must
[14:09] now don't feel bad
[14:12] the Bible tells us that when Sarah a man
[14:15] heard that she was going to bring forth
[14:17] a child in her old age the Bible said
[14:19] that she laughed up her sleeve
[14:22] brother Brandon brings that out she
[14:24] laughed and God said you know has she
[14:26] not been Abram's wife he would have
[14:29] slayed her he would have killed her but
[14:31] it didn't stop there because an
[14:33] unconditional it was an unconditional
[14:37] listen the true seed of God I won't I
[14:39] don't want you to worry I want you to
[14:42] press
[14:43] it's not a word I'm not trying to scare
[14:46] a tactic I'm trying to tell you the the
[14:49] entrance had been a ministered to you in
[14:51] abundant way and this thing is about the
[14:54] grace of God to you multiply
[14:59] I showed you last week amen that you
[15:01] have not because you asked not is that
[15:04] nasty statue of a person he said you
[15:06] ought not to stop seeking God he said
[15:08] seek him every day until all these
[15:12] things be in you
[15:14] go listen to it
[15:16] oh but listen to what I'm going to say
[15:18] here you don't add to it it adds to you
[15:22] because everything you need for the
[15:25] Rapture is in the seed amen and all you
[15:28] got to do is eat and pray Eat and Pray
[15:31] water the seed and it will take care of
[15:34] itself
[15:37] is that all right
[15:39] oh thank you Jesus amen so you and I
[15:43] must understand amen amen God does
[15:46] things he he worked with us amen like
[15:48] you said well you know he has out in the
[15:51] book of Isaiah he said the heaven is my
[15:52] throne and Earth is my footstool where
[15:54] is the house that you build unto me and
[15:56] where's the place of my rest
[15:58] and then he goes on he said oh but thou
[16:01] has prepared a body what was the body it
[16:03] was the temple of God and the Bible says
[16:06] know ye not that ye are the temple of
[16:08] God
[16:09] 's desire is the final rest in your soul
[16:14] and in order for him to find rest in
[16:17] your soul you must find rest
[16:19] amen that's the rest Joshua was talking
[16:23] about God coming down living amen into
[16:27] your into your souls is that right like
[16:30] Hebrews listen it ain't about just you
[16:32] the Bible said they cannot be made
[16:35] perfect
[16:36] they can't even come up out of the
[16:38] Resurrection until you and I get in our
[16:41] minds that we're going to do the will of
[16:43] God
[16:45] hello somebody amen so you and I we're
[16:48] holding up the process
[16:50] as I said it's unconditional so what is
[16:54] the lacking the thing that's lacking
[16:55] your faith to believe it can happen
[17:00] me be perfect yes you
[17:04] just as perfect as God is
[17:07] for my show brother man I'm saying like
[17:08] this he said God will make you a shell
[17:11] yes sir hallelujah oh Jesus was was a
[17:15] shell a housing
[17:17] because he said I can't do nothing
[17:19] except the father showed me see that's a
[17:22] total surrendering to God a total
[17:24] surrendering to God and that's our goal
[17:27] when is it going to happen at the
[17:28] squeeze like I said God will
[17:32] either lead you like a lamb or he'll
[17:35] drive you like cattle
[17:36] listen he goes on and I was working with
[17:39] Sarah because the Bible he created
[17:43] recreated in Sarah a womb that will
[17:48] accept seed
[17:49] is that right it's the same thing
[17:52] Ezekiel said amen in the 26th 27th verse
[17:55] a new heart also I would give you and a
[17:59] new spirit within you and I would take
[18:01] the Stony heart out of the Flesh and
[18:04] I'll give you a heart of Flesh and I
[18:07] will put my spirit within you and cause
[18:11] you to walk in my statues his Spirit In
[18:16] You causes you to walk in his statue and
[18:20] ye shall keep my weight my my judgments
[18:24] and do them so you you and I can't even
[18:28] do it except God comes in you to do it
[18:33] that's why he said in Beethoven is in
[18:35] you you do the works of Beethoven
[18:38] right so Ezekiel ties right into what
[18:41] took place at Sarah's life Sarah laughed
[18:44] at it but God had to give her a new
[18:46] spirit he had to create something in her
[18:50] uh uh like brother I said a new spirit
[18:52] to receive his spirit and he said that
[18:55] new spirit amen is given to you so you
[18:58] can be agreeable with the word
[19:00] and yourself
[19:06] is that all right I showed you all you
[19:09] got to do is travail he says Amen in the
[19:12] scripture before she travails she
[19:13] brought forth and for her pain came she
[19:16] was delivered of a man child and that's
[19:18] the thing is a lot of us don't like to
[19:19] prevail
[19:21] you know we want that our little soft
[19:23] cry you know
[19:24] you know just one tear like Hollywood
[19:26] gives you know amen God wants some real
[19:29] travailing like I said you know if Jacob
[19:32] had the Rapture with the angel you will
[19:33] too
[19:34] Hallelujah you got to get out of your
[19:37] comfort zone God God sent a prophet the
[19:40] devil know that
[19:42] believes it the devil got more faith
[19:44] than God than some of us
[19:47] the Bible said that Satan believes and
[19:49] tremble
[19:52] he tramples at the word of God because
[19:55] he knows the word of God the word of
[19:57] listen the devil knows the word of God
[20:00] so much he knows at the end time he'll
[20:02] be destroyed he said prove that those
[20:05] Legions amen that was in Legion said
[20:07] Lord did you come to torment us before
[20:10] our time
[20:11] did I know that Tom is coming and if
[20:14] demons know their time coming the bride
[20:16] knows her time is coming
[20:20] oh Lord hallelujah I'm so excited even
[20:24] because I can see God working on the
[20:26] inside
[20:28] working on the inside amen bringing out
[20:31] a transformation in this place
[20:34] amen is that all right it means so we
[20:36] realize by the grace of God Amen the
[20:39] Bible said except the Lord builds the
[20:42] house they labor in vain that build it
[20:45] except the Lord keep the city The
[20:49] Watchmen
[20:50] wake it but in the night now here
[20:53] brother Banner goes on and says listen
[20:54] he said a lot of you guys oh I can't do
[20:57] this because I might get caught I can't
[20:59] do this because amen I might hurt
[21:00] somebody feeling oh I know no no no no
[21:04] no no no as long as we're doing it that
[21:07] way
[21:09] it's only law
[21:12] there is not listen I don't care amen
[21:15] you can take alcohol and remember I used
[21:18] to be addicted to it you can take it and
[21:20] you can put it all to my face and
[21:22] everything else amen it doesn't bother
[21:24] me I don't go out drinking
[21:28] it's gone
[21:30] see once the demon is gone there's no
[21:32] desire
[21:34] remember I showed you the Bible said if
[21:36] you tempted and you're drawn away you
[21:39] according to James it's your own lust
[21:41] and desire that means you got company in
[21:43] the house
[21:47] demon power is on the inside of you
[21:49] that's calling for that but if there's
[21:52] nothing in you that's gonna call for it
[21:57] no no as much as I used to dance out
[21:59] there in the world and I mean I used to
[22:01] dance there ain't nothing in me no more
[22:03] whatever demon was in me that had me all
[22:06] on the floor it's gone there's no
[22:09] temptation I don't care if it's a rap
[22:11] Boogie Woogie whatever it may be there
[22:13] is nothing that pulls me to that
[22:18] and that's the way it's supposed to be
[22:20] with everything amen
[22:22] of the world totally dead to everything
[22:26] of the world is what God is looking for
[22:29] In You and I
[22:31] hello
[22:33] amen remember I told you denominations
[22:36] cannot produce a bride not in this age
[22:39] every age has produced their bride but
[22:42] not this one
[22:43] what I mean denominations God has
[22:45] already selected those come out of her
[22:47] my people be not partakers of her sin
[22:50] you're part of that group that God has
[22:52] selected Amen to be his bride and I
[22:54] showed you about the grace of God Amen
[22:56] that how Amen in the Book of Revelations
[22:58] the third chapter you have been invited
[23:01] as gold tried in the fire
[23:05] you're going to be tried but you
[23:08] accepted the invitation because you
[23:11] believe your gold
[23:15] come on your gold tried in the fire so
[23:18] the fire is coming and the prophet of
[23:20] God said in this age the fire is heated
[23:23] up seven times harder
[23:29] telling me in Hebrews 10 please
[23:31] is that all right
[23:34] it's a good thing
[23:36] that this message has come to us to
[23:38] bring us to a perfection
[23:40] and as I said amen it's just
[23:43] communication
[23:45] God allows us to see what's wrong in us
[23:48] and it's up to us to do something about
[23:50] it brother Bruce what could I do nothing
[23:52] other than pray the Bible said you have
[23:54] not because you ask not amen come on
[23:57] somebody your your efforts all these
[24:00] things are going okay but you don't want
[24:01] it to remain there you want the complete
[24:04] nature to be changed you'll never find a
[24:07] dove associating with the crow they're
[24:10] two different kind of birds that eat two
[24:11] different kinds of diets amen so you and
[24:14] I must understand the dub nature amen
[24:17] has nothing to do with the world
[24:21] you can be a dove like he said you know
[24:23] you can be a peacock a crow trying to
[24:27] put peacock feathers in you and anybody
[24:29] looking at you know the difference
[24:32] amen because the Seal of God is Not only
[24:35] on the outside but it's on the inside
[24:36] too
[24:37] y'all hear what I'm saying people are
[24:39] busy you're visible amen even demons
[24:42] know you when you don't even know you
[24:49] they know when you don't fit
[24:52] is the light that you carry with you
[24:56] you come on somebody
[24:59] amen I'm trying to take it slow but I'll
[25:01] tell you what I'm not too far from
[25:02] preaching
[25:03] now my point is amen by the grace of God
[25:06] that you and I were blessed if we could
[25:07] get the people to see we're blessed
[25:10] amen and not cursed no matter what Satan
[25:12] says you're not cursed
[25:15] right
[25:17] if God can comes around and and sanctify
[25:20] uh hadessa
[25:22] and comes around and sanctify amen uh
[25:26] uriah's wife
[25:29] come on somebody God can come and
[25:31] sanctify you
[25:34] but understand you can't get into the
[25:37] king's chamber without the process of
[25:40] sanctification
[25:42] did you catch that you cannot get into
[25:46] the king's chamber without the process
[25:49] of sanctification
[25:53] it has to be so you got to come to the
[25:56] grips and say Lord I really want this to
[25:58] be delivered
[26:00] from because you're the only reason why
[26:03] things still exist
[26:06] you have to make the choice of giving it
[26:08] up
[26:10] man you have to make the choice of
[26:12] wanting it to be cleansed
[26:14] come on somebody whosoever will let him
[26:17] come come on this is not a forceful
[26:19] issue but if you are true see
[26:22] you thirst for the Living God with such
[26:25] a intensity brother Banner said million
[26:28] times Millions amen you have such a
[26:30] thirst in your heart to be just like him
[26:34] right
[26:37] Hebrews 10 meaning at the 19th verse
[26:41] having therefore Brethren boldness to
[26:45] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[26:48] Jesus
[26:50] that's your privilege
[26:52] this is your privilege with a boldness
[26:56] not a pride now
[26:58] not a pride a boldness humility amen but
[27:03] knowing it's yours
[27:06] by a New and Living weight that's why so
[27:09] many people don't get nothing from God
[27:10] because I'm Brian oh yes I'm right oh
[27:12] I'm such a pride about it
[27:15] right but that's not the wrong kind of
[27:17] pride
[27:18] you should be thankful that God has
[27:20] chosen you to be that but understand
[27:22] what's not by your own works it was by
[27:26] the grace of God
[27:28] but a New and Living Way which he have
[27:31] consecrated for us through the veil that
[27:34] is to say his flesh and having a high
[27:37] priest over the house of God let us draw
[27:40] near with a True Heart in full Assurance
[27:45] of Faith remember because none of these
[27:48] virtues will ever operate in you without
[27:50] faith having our heart sprinkled from an
[27:54] evil conscience and our bodies washed
[27:57] with pure water let us hold faster
[28:00] profession about faith what without wave
[28:03] ring and he is faithful that promise
[28:06] sound like the same kind of way God
[28:09] worded that thing with Abraham
[28:11] and in the book of Hebrews the 11th
[28:14] chapter by faith is that all right
[28:18] so amen by the grace of God just give me
[28:20] give me a little more time amen I'm not
[28:22] going to be too much longer I'm trying
[28:23] to recap and at the same time I'm trying
[28:25] to get to where I want to go to this
[28:27] morning now God you must recognize you
[28:31] know how can I put it I said it this
[28:35] last week Wednesday I said listen uh uh
[28:38] a chain is as strong as his weakest link
[28:42] and y'all who ever seen little beads if
[28:45] you pull that cord tight wherever the
[28:47] weak point is it'll break and what
[28:49] happens a lot of times you think you
[28:51] don't have the Holy Ghost you think you
[28:53] don't have God in you because you let
[28:55] the chain be broken or the bees pop
[28:59] and come on somebody and that's what the
[29:02] prophet of God said when you when it
[29:03] does happen that means you got to start
[29:05] up again is that right you get those
[29:07] same bees and you line them right back
[29:09] up the way they supposed to be until
[29:11] that one point that's weak becomes
[29:13] strong he called it Vulcanizing when
[29:16] that thing one level strengthens the
[29:19] other
[29:20] amen until you become a Powerhouse
[29:25] oh well brother Brooks how I'm gonna do
[29:27] it you can't do it that's the point I'm
[29:29] trying to tell you you can't do it but
[29:31] God in you will do it if you're willing
[29:34] to let him do it
[29:37] say brother Brooks what are you saying
[29:39] you're gonna have to suffer
[29:42] yeah people gonna get all in your face
[29:47] call you names
[29:49] mistreat you
[29:51] you speak to them and they'll turn their
[29:53] heads
[29:55] and you gotta love them
[30:00] come on somebody amen there's a real
[30:03] sleepy Spirit everywhere in this place
[30:06] but you know by the grace of God Amen we
[30:08] rebuke that devil
[30:10] amen because you know that's he's trying
[30:12] to keep and it's a lot of y'all so don't
[30:13] think it's just you on it I can see
[30:15] everybody that's fighting it so I want
[30:17] you to understand some of y'all are just
[30:19] tired I understand that we're not saying
[30:21] that but God is still able to rejuvenate
[30:22] you
[30:24] that's what we're asking for now we're
[30:26] coming in at five time but here you got
[30:29] to recognize you're recognizing every
[30:30] one of us know
[30:32] Divine love
[30:34] most of us if I could put it that way
[30:36] it's still our goal
[30:41] how many of y'all guided in this all on
[30:43] display come on we know by the grace of
[30:46] God you won't leave out of here in a
[30:49] Rapture without it brother random said
[30:51] that's the only thing that makes it
[30:53] how you gonna get to Divine love if you
[30:55] don't have temperance
[30:59] long-suffering come on somebody's true
[31:01] you gotta have all of this not
[31:03] potentially
[31:04] on display the token was something that
[31:08] even Egyptians could see
[31:12] it ain't about oh I'm in the message
[31:14] it's whether the message is in you
[31:18] on display
[31:21] right brotherly kindness
[31:25] we can use a lesson in that one
[31:27] right we ain't got it like we ought to
[31:29] have right the reason why I say that
[31:31] we're two clickish
[31:33] to clanish
[31:35] every family separated to themselves
[31:37] that's wrong we are the family of God
[31:42] Hallelujah
[31:45] and when your natural family means more
[31:48] to you than your your spiritual family
[31:51] you are out of the wheel
[31:53] why because even Jesus said who is my
[31:55] mother my father my sister and my
[31:57] brother but those who do my father's
[31:59] will
[31:59] oh but listen listen your mama and your
[32:02] brothers come to see you he wouldn't
[32:04] even stop service to serve
[32:10] D hello
[32:11] yeah it's true anyhow
[32:14] listen I want you to know there's a war
[32:16] but let me go to Deuteronomy 8 2. y'all
[32:19] love that
[32:20] Deuteronomy 8 2.
[32:22] none of us are exempt we all learning
[32:29] you love God
[32:32] we all learning and listen that's how I
[32:35] know the Holy Ghost ain't working in our
[32:36] lives like it ought to because it's
[32:39] evident
[32:40] not just in this church it's everywhere
[32:43] but the Bible said amen the love of many
[32:45] shall wax cold
[32:52] it's going to happen if you don't keep
[32:54] the fire burning
[32:56] everybody in here will begin to look
[32:59] faulty to you
[33:00] everybody you look at will become a
[33:02] hypocrite but you
[33:07] um
[33:09] hey and I don't know Divine love
[33:11] thinketh no evil so that's the Bible
[33:15] Revelation 7 24 I'm sorry excuse me
[33:19] Deuteronomy 8 and 2.
[33:23] amen he says what
[33:26] and thou shall remember all the ways
[33:29] which the Lord thy God LED these 40
[33:31] years in the wilderness to Humble thee
[33:34] to prove thee to know that was in thy to
[33:37] know what was in thine heart whether
[33:40] thou would keep his commandment or no
[33:42] and he humbled thee and suffered thee to
[33:46] hunger and Faith thee with Manna which
[33:48] thou kneweth not neither did thy fathers
[33:51] know that he might make thee know that
[33:54] man does not live by bread only but by
[33:56] every word that proceedeth out of the
[33:58] mouth of the Lord does Man live
[34:01] so that is one of the lessons that you
[34:03] and I in this as I said you can't have
[34:06] knowledge knowledges means that God's
[34:08] word is amen
[34:10] amen no matter what anybody else says
[34:12] God's word is amen there is no
[34:16] contradictions
[34:18] in God's word
[34:20] every bit of it is amen and if your
[34:23] reasoning take you away from that you'll
[34:26] never come to a full ceiling of
[34:28] knowledge in you and listen what brother
[34:30] Brandon said y'all know it's the truth
[34:32] he said character is a victory
[34:35] so that means you gotta fight
[34:40] um
[34:41] I know y'all love this kind of preaching
[34:43] don't you
[34:44] I do I love something that's going to go
[34:46] to my heart hallelujah amen that head
[34:49] stuff is okay too but I I like it I like
[34:51] it to go right here amen so when I after
[34:54] the service is over I can say hallelujah
[34:56] God help me
[35:00] I ain't putting no fingers here that
[35:02] blade go both ways here y'all hear what
[35:05] I'm saying amen so you and I we and I
[35:08] must know that he come to Humble us and
[35:10] to try us and you're going to suffer
[35:13] forget it
[35:14] they're gonna be times your bills ain't
[35:16] gonna be paid or or you know something
[35:18] gonna happen you might hunger you might
[35:20] have to go without changing of clothes
[35:22] all these things gonna happen to you and
[35:25] you know what the devil says to you
[35:26] how can you be in the will of God never
[35:29] have I seen the righteous forsaken nor
[35:31] seed begging bread he loves that
[35:32] scripture but when he brings that
[35:34] scripture to me I said well then if that
[35:36] be true you tell me about the man
[35:37] Lazarus who laid at the rich man table
[35:42] he was hungry come on somebody but God's
[35:46] will amen who is the rich man God was
[35:49] proving something who was the rich man
[35:51] was it the man with all the natural
[35:52] wealths or was it the man who had God
[35:55] you're the rich man you got God you got
[35:59] everything
[36:01] oh
[36:03] Paul said there's a war and don't you
[36:05] think you're gonna just walk on easy
[36:07] through this thing
[36:10] Paul said oh Wretched Man that I am who
[36:14] shall deliver me from this body of this
[36:16] death I looked that up who's going to
[36:19] deliver me from the power of death
[36:21] because that's what you're living in
[36:22] that's your house
[36:25] your house is a body of death your house
[36:29] is a body that don't want to serve God
[36:31] it doesn't want to pray it don't want to
[36:34] worship it don't want to give
[36:36] Thanksgiving it just don't have nothing
[36:38] to do it it hates God your body
[36:42] that's why it's been condemned
[36:46] don't even think your body want to serve
[36:49] God
[36:49] you have to bring this thing into
[36:51] subjection Paul said I have to Die daily
[36:54] I got to do it every day
[36:57] and that's where we fail we wake up and
[37:00] think well yesterday going to take care

[37:14] you he hadn't given up yet he still
[37:17] think he's going to win the war
[37:19] huh
[37:22] he still thinks he's got a chance
[37:26] and he's got all these people believing
[37:28] he is God
[37:34] yeah yes yes

[43:31] be that so connected to you amen that
[43:34] you you no longer he said like Paul said
[43:36] it's not I that live but Christ that
[43:38] lives in me see that's where we're
[43:40] headed we've got to come to that place I
[43:43] said we from the pulpit to the back of
[43:45] the door we must come to that place
[43:50] don't y'all desire to be perfect I do
[43:53] I do I get tired of coming short
[43:56] um
[43:57] somebody and it ain't nothing ain't
[44:00] nothing as fast as I ever thought
[44:02] right it comes so quickly you know
[44:05] whether it be by your brother your
[44:07] sister you you know it comes
[44:11] wherever you may be something comes and
[44:13] it's up to you to accept it or reject it
[44:15] and the Bible said perfect love thinking
[44:19] no ill it thinks no evil but we'll let
[44:21] it come right on through right you can't
[44:24] stop it from coming to the head but when
[44:26] it goes to the heart you need a hard
[44:29] operation
[44:30] thank you Lord all of us
[44:32] got to start getting down to prayer and
[44:35] that's the problem with the prayer that
[44:36] the message church is now they so they
[44:38] they are so
[44:40] how you say elected and predestinated
[44:42] they don't even pray no more
[44:45] that's nonsense
[44:51] hmm
[44:52] it's unconditional yes but you got to
[44:55] understand that unconditional also
[44:56] brought some things through there right
[45:00] oh
[45:02] it's true you can't you see that's what
[45:05] I'm saying this is what you and I must
[45:06] understand we can't make it happen
[45:10] but he can
[45:12] I look towards to hear from which cometh
[45:14] my help my health coming from the Lord
[45:16] hallelujah the Bible said in the name of
[45:18] the Lord is a strong child and the
[45:20] righteous running and they are safe you
[45:22] need and I need to turn more to God
[45:23] that's the only way it's going to happen
[45:26] I'm telling you if you're trying to do
[45:28] it on your own you're gonna you're gonna
[45:29] mess up
[45:30] you're gonna mess up and Satan always
[45:32] that's how he discouraged so many
[45:34] Christians he got you working it out
[45:36] working it out working it out you know
[45:38] what the scripture said your works of
[45:40] the Lord is is to believe on him whom
[45:42] God hath sent
[45:43] that's your work because once you
[45:45] believe on him whom God has sent amen
[45:48] you'll do the things that's right he
[45:50] said if you believe Abraham was my
[45:52] father he said you do the works of
[45:53] Abraham amen that's right and if you
[45:56] believe that William Branham is the
[45:58] seventh Church age messenger you you'll
[46:00] do the works
[46:02] it comes with it just like uh uh I was
[46:06] listening to uh what message is that
[46:08] um
[46:09] why are people so talked about he goes
[46:11] on I believe he said amen where he was
[46:13] talking about uh uh uh uh uh pharaoh and
[46:16] and Moses and and he and and and he was
[46:19] telling the people except you do what I
[46:21] say do you gonna perish
[46:25] that thing hit me
[46:27] so is it with our Angel our messenger
[46:30] you know brother Bradham God told him
[46:32] that your your ministry was greater than
[46:34] Moses and Elijah and all the other
[46:35] Ministries that have come greater
[46:39] greater and if you believe on him you
[46:42] must do as he say
[46:44] oh I got you quiet now that's all right
[46:48] it's true anyhow
[46:49] amen I ain't missing the Raptor for
[46:51] nobody
[46:54] Ephesians 6 12.
[46:59] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[47:01] blood but against principalities against
[47:04] Powers against the rulers of the
[47:06] darkness of this world against spiritual
[47:09] wickedness in high places wherefore take
[47:13] on the whole arm of God that you may be
[47:16] able to withstand in the evil day and
[47:19] having done all to stand what is the
[47:22] whole arm of God he feeds you I mean
[47:24] excuse me second Peter we just read that
[47:26] after your face virtual knowledge to
[47:28] Allah that's the whole armor
[47:32] amen
[47:34] Hallelujah
[47:36] glory to God Amen Colossians 1 please
[47:41] the whole armor
[47:43] the devil will shake at you oh I gotta
[47:46] say it I gotta quote read that quote in
[47:48] just a moment ah Colossians 1 16.
[47:52] for by him we were all things created
[47:55] that are in heaven that are in Earth
[47:57] visible invisible whether they be
[47:59] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[48:01] or Powers all things created by Him and
[48:04] what for him so if he created
[48:07] principalities don't you know he's got
[48:09] rule over him
[48:11] whew he's got all power I'll rule all
[48:15] without that time principalities I read
[48:17] that so that you can go to me with me to
[48:20] Colossians 2 8 15.
[48:22] 2 15. is that right having and having
[48:26] spoiled principalities and power he made
[48:29] a show of them openly triumphant over
[48:31] them in it so he'd try out and the
[48:35] prophet God said every Victory Jesus won
[48:38] we won it
[48:39] every victory
[48:48] I'll tell you what
[48:50] ah I forgot that brother the Indian
[48:52] brother the Navajo what's his name
[48:53] brother
[48:55] brother Mark when brother Mark came in
[48:57] he prophesied something
[48:58] you know about my daughter and I tell
[49:00] you what it happened just like he said
[49:03] two days it was done
[49:05] now with that same restoration my
[49:09] daughter who's been married eight years
[49:10] is pregnant
[49:14] Hallelujah come on he whispered in my
[49:16] ear and it came to pass in two days
[49:25] Gibson callings without repentance now
[49:28] we don't know where all he's going to
[49:29] lead and I believe God going real men he
[49:31] said he'd turn he'll return so we'll see
[49:34] see what God is going to do with it but
[49:36] you know what if I had shot on him
[49:38] because he was a little different
[49:41] I would have never got what God had for
[49:42] me
[49:46] hello somebody we don't forgot how
[49:49] messed up we were until we came into
[49:50] this message
[49:52] but one thing that man got a testimony
[49:54] of that the property God preached at his
[49:56] tribe Hallelujah brought the message
[49:59] hiya come on somebody now you and I must
[50:02] understand God is still God
[50:05] I refuse to be in denominational
[50:07] organization I'm so sorry
[50:10] If Abraham said the lot was his brother
[50:15] then I've got a brother too
[50:19] and Abraham was willing to die for his
[50:22] brother I'm willing to die for mine too
[50:26] come on somebody Colossians 2 15 did I
[50:30] read that he spoiled it is that right he
[50:33] brought an open show he on Calvary he
[50:35] said listen oh he said all power in
[50:37] Heaven and Earth is given unto me and
[50:38] then he comes along and said I'm giving
[50:40] you that
[50:41] I'm giving you that same power
[50:43] is that all right let's turn him into
[50:46] Romans 8 38. you love God I'm enjoying
[50:49] this I hope you are amen because this is
[50:52] wonderful to me that God is building us
[50:54] I got five minutes God is building us
[50:56] Amen to a perfect place in him and I'm
[50:59] enjoying it I am enjoying it I can see
[51:02] now when the Devil Comes it's the devil
[51:04] whether it comes to a a daughter or a a
[51:07] a lamb a neighbor it doesn't matter I
[51:11] know who I am and you must know who you
[51:13] are and that God has come to try you and
[51:16] test you amen
[51:17] so that you can be that kind of a sheep
[51:19] that won't open his mouth
[51:21] while you're being persecuted
[51:27] it's a higher calling
[51:30] is a higher calling
[51:32] 8 38 is that all right
[51:36] for I am persuaded
[51:41] that neither death nor life nor angels
[51:45] nor principalities
[51:48] nor power nor things present nor things
[51:51] to come no height nor death nor any
[51:55] other creature shall be able to watch
[51:57] separate us he didn't say separate me he
[52:01] said separate us from the love of God
[52:04] which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[52:06] nothing
[52:11] your attitude toward the word of God
[52:14] will bring things to pass
[52:19] so no evil formed against me shall
[52:21] prosper
[52:22] come on somebody
[52:24] you love the Lord
[52:26] I'm gonna jump here because I hadn't
[52:28] even gotten to the virtues again I
[52:29] stopped at I think uh patience was it a
[52:32] whichever it was but we'll start there
[52:34] this evening but let me read just a
[52:35] portion of this quote uh and I'll start
[52:38] that off
[52:39] uh this evening
[52:41] he said he said what we need in in in in
[52:43] in Jeffersonville and brown Tabernacle
[52:46] he said thousands of lived voices
[52:49] thundering of God thundering out in
[52:53] sweetness and Holiness Purity
[52:57] undefiled living walking around in the
[53:00] Earth today without a blemish he said
[53:04] yes sir real Christians there's Thunders
[53:07] against the enemy the devil don't care
[53:11] uh how loud you holla uh jumping shop
[53:16] but What Hurts The Devil is to see that
[53:20] Sanctified holy life consecrated unto
[53:23] God Amen and then he goes on and said
[53:25] that's the Thunder that shakes the devil
[53:28] and
[53:32] y'all hear that that's what gets him
[53:34] upset when he see he can't move you You
[53:37] Like a Rock of Gibraltar Hallelujah when
[53:40] he see a man that your faith is so
[53:43] steadfast amen that you're not wondering
[53:45] or am I saved today or am I lost
[53:47] Hallelujah well I'm gonna make a Rapture
[53:49] whether I'm not gonna make a Rapture
[53:51] Hallelujah Abraham how do you know
[53:54] you're gonna have that son 25 years
[53:57] because God Said So how do you know
[54:00] you're gonna come to Perfection because
[54:02] God said so that's how I know not my
[54:07] work not by power but by my spirit said
[54:10] the Lord
[54:13] let's stand
[54:21] yeah
[54:23] so what we gonna do
[54:25] this evening we'll go through the the
[54:27] we'll try to go through the uh
[54:30] those virtues again all of them uh as
[54:33] briefly as we possibly can just to give
[54:35] you an idea what you you must be watch
[54:37] for love Watch and Pray
[54:39] right watch and pray I showed you how
[54:42] the other day I was running you know I
[54:43] do not I just do a little jogging but
[54:46] you know I was jogging down the road and
[54:47] of course I was crossing over and here I
[54:51] was amen still in the street and I knew
[54:54] the guy was going to say
[54:55] something you get out of the street
[54:58] and I didn't say nothing but I said move
[55:02] over
[55:03] you see what I'm saying I shouldn't have
[55:05] said anything
[55:08] that was a test I failed y'all hear me
[55:11] y'all hear what I'm saying hey man I
[55:14] heard listen I I don't I hope y'all
[55:16] don't nobody take this bad I'm running
[55:18] in my neighborhood and and and and these
[55:21] people said hey you black
[55:25] and I'm thinking I know it
[55:32] hello that must have been a divine
[55:34] revelation to somebody
[55:36] I know what color I am you know but I
[55:38] could have got upset
[55:40] right and then it's just the same then
[55:44] there was a group of boys and they heard
[55:46] of something out of the car too and you
[55:48] know the devil said you're gonna take
[55:49] that and I kept running like I ignored
[55:51] him
[55:52] old fella like me gonna take on four
[55:54] boys come on somebody and you know if I
[55:57] had said something they're going to turn
[55:58] around
[56:00] huh so you say you got to have wisdom
[56:06] and you know right because remember
[56:09] Satan it takes two to tangle
[56:12] and you can't argue with without
[56:14] somebody that's going to follow it up
[56:16] through right a person when they're
[56:18] screaming and hollering at you and you
[56:19] ain't saying nothing feel really stupid
[56:25] y'all hear what I'm saying
[56:27] one of the worst one of the best things
[56:30] you can tell somebody when they get all
[56:31] messy with you is to say you know I
[56:34] really love you
[56:35] it just messes them up
[56:40] yeah see it from the heart you know I
[56:44] really love you
[56:46] and you know you'll be surprised it just
[56:49] makes the devil shake you know that
[56:52] normally when you do that to a person
[56:53] they feel so bad they come back and ask
[56:55] for forgiveness
[56:57] people you got to be that example you
[57:00] can't let the devil just toss you to and
[57:02] fro and make some kind of puppet out of
[57:03] you and you know what I'm saying you
[57:05] just gotta just start saying God help me
[57:07] and when you see I'm gonna tell you
[57:09] something if you in the spirit you can
[57:10] almost feel it coming before you even
[57:12] get there you can feel it
[57:13] y'all know what I'm talking about it's
[57:15] like a dimensional thing you cannot you
[57:17] I can feel it coming because I I would
[57:19] feel it most of the time when before
[57:21] things come I can feel it coming my way
[57:23] don't know what the person might say or
[57:25] do but I know it's coming
[57:27] see that's walking in the spirit that's
[57:29] literally walking and that's where God
[57:30] wants all of us to walk in the spirit
[57:33] right can I share one more thing and I
[57:35] was just a young Christian wisdom in
[57:37] school
[57:38] you know I learned that when you're in
[57:41] school you learn how to save all your
[57:44] test papers
[57:45] don't ever assume your instructor is
[57:48] going to be fair to you
[57:50] y'all hear what I'm saying now I say
[57:52] that and I don't know who is it for but
[57:54] you better remember what I'm saying
[57:55] because amen I was at that time a little
[57:58] arrogant didn't know it but I
[58:02] anyway should have gotten an a out of
[58:04] the class
[58:05] right at the end of the day at the last
[58:08] test I knew I scored good on it I knew I
[58:11] did and I walked out that room said to
[58:13] that teacher I know I got my a
[58:16] H I'm supposed to be I'm a Christian now
[58:18] supposedly anyway what happened
[58:21] when it came through the mail in the
[58:24] summertime I had a c
[58:25] but you see I didn't keep all my
[58:27] paperwork I didn't keep all my test
[58:29] exams I couldn't even argue with this
[58:31] man
[58:33] and I really was so broken I cried and
[58:35] went to my past in the church
[58:37] told him about he says listen do you
[58:39] have this this man again for uh another
[58:42] uh time I'm saying all of this because
[58:45] remember whether it be your boss whoever
[58:47] it is is uh is superior at work at
[58:51] school wherever you are you have to be
[58:53] careful what you say
[58:55] don't ever get into a place where you
[58:57] think that you you got it all together
[58:59] and you could be arrogant in your stand
[59:00] just as soon as you get proud and puffy
[59:03] God bringing you down
[59:05] you see because that's what happened to
[59:06] me God brought me down now when I came
[59:10] back to that after the summer the first
[59:12] thing that instructor said to me to let
[59:14] me know he purposely did what he did he
[59:17] said Isaiah you might get an A this year
[59:21] but what I'm going to do swell up like a
[59:23] frog
[59:26] you see what I'm saying it would have
[59:27] caused more trouble but I learned
[59:29] through a wise man keep your mouth shut
[59:32] and guess what I got that Aid
[59:36] am I making sense
[59:37] well no matter where it is you've got to
[59:40] be careful on how you say and do things
[59:43] in this world because first of all the
[59:45] world only love their own
[59:48] and you've got to remember you're not of
[59:50] the world and I don't care how much they
[59:52] smile in your face they are not your
[59:55] friends
[59:57] huh I'm telling
[59:59] telling it comes to standing with a
[1:00:01] sinner versus standing with you they're
[1:00:02] going to stand with the sinner even
[1:00:04] though they know
[1:00:06] The Sinner is wrong
[1:00:08] and you're right
[1:00:10] that's the word
[1:00:11] you love God just giving you some wisdom
[1:00:14] somebody gonna need this
[1:00:16] somebody's gonna need it listen amen
[1:00:19] because I'm telling you now we've come
[1:00:21] to be a standard and the world is not
[1:00:23] worthy of us
[1:00:26] let's pray
[1:00:28] father God we come before you Lord as
[1:00:30] homeless we know how we think it for
[1:00:31] your grace and your mercy Lord we
[1:00:34] appreciate you Lord for being so good to
[1:00:36] us Lord we pray that you bless the
[1:00:38] servant in a special way Lord let the
[1:00:41] word be anchored into the hearts of the
[1:00:43] people father that their change will
[1:00:46] come about in our lives we ask these
[1:00:48] things in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:00:50] amen
