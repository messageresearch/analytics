[Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah god is so good to us he has made us glad we're just going to get right into the word of god we're gonna ask that you turn with us to daniel the fourth chapter in first peter the fourth chapter i believe i've got that correct what can we say at a time like this i hope everybody was really blessed with the services that was rendered unto us on sunday um i don't know about you but uh it had me weeping not just for myself but for others as well i realized by the grace of god that uh you know we're living in such a time where people just they're just not aware it's not like that hasn't been told to them but if you don't believe that which has been said it will profit you nothing and when we look at the times that we're living in in the very condition that we're living in understand that we're not the first actually we're the last the things in which we are now seeing has already been done people have gone on before us people who thought they were christians and they ended up lost people who actually uh heard the word of god but didn't have ears to hear yes but i thank god for his election i am confident that he that begun the good work in us is faithful to complete it daniel the fourth chapter we're going to read by god's grace and i think i've got it mixed up but uh it must be 12 and 4. i think it's 12 and 4. i must have mixed it up 4 and 12. uh-huh sounds more like it yeah daniel 12 and 4. sorry about that but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall increa shall be increased first peter i believe i got this one right fourth chapter 17th verse hallelujah first peter glad to have everybody here tonight we come to worship the lord and um we thank for god for his grace and his mercy i'm glad to be one in a number this is the hour of maturing and you can't mature on your own not even the thought of your maturing can never bring you to maturity god himself is the only one that could add to the cubit he's the only one that can bill you and the bible says except the lord builds the house we who labor labor in vain first peter the fourth chapter 17th verse for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first began at us what shall the end beto of them that obey not the gospel of god amen let us pray father we come before you lord as humanly as we know how and we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being good to us thank you for waking us up this morning clothing on our right mind you've done a great work in this day and thank you father for allowing my eyes to behold your goodness and your grace many have eyes to see and cannot see and many have ears to hear and cannot hear but thank you father for your amazing grace lord how my heart breaking how my heart is so troubled because i have many friends i say many but i have several friends lord that just cannot see and lord i know that there's nothing that i can do but we're praying we're not giving up lord we pray for our friends and our loved ones we'll never give up lord we'll keep knocking on your door that your grace may find them and that their eyes and ears may be open and that you will grant them repentance we ask these things in your lovely name have thine own way in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i just want to thank the lord for his grace i thank the lord for uh this message and as we continue in this way we really see the loving of great and grace of god um when we talk about the end time message we must all understand that this book was once sealed up that many people who thought they had faith went by hope but nevertheless god has said according to zechariah once the vision has been made plain that he that reason we must run and i believe this is a time that you and i must know that we should be running first of all we have come in a lateness of the hour i really believe that god has held the rapture up uh particularly for me you got to put yourself in there but we're talking about a book and we're talking about the opening of the word remember i told you that's my subject the age of the opening of the word because one time it was sealed and daniel said that this book would be opened at the end time now when it comes to the book of revelation many people don't look into it and they don't understand it the world is at large has this intellectual understanding of what the rapture is all about or the coming of the lord and of course in their understanding they've got all these hideous monsters coming up and doing whatever they got to do when god has already come and many of the things in which they're looking for for has already taken place we see by god's grace that uh america is in the book of revelation according to the 13th chapter she is that little beast that comes up that little animal that comes up like a lamb and then turns into the beast and you and i can see the transformation things that are taking place now our country will be changed and is changing when we understand what's happening we look at the coronavirus and we look at all of the systems that are being shut down and we see our country not only just our country but the world in itself falling in such a rate that no one would be will be able to save them the world is in for a crash an economical crash that cannot even be presented prevented right now uh they can give us all of the stimulus packages that they want to but it will never bring this country back up to power why because god has all ordained a way and the way in which god has ordained for this country and the world uh to come back into a place of livelihood would be a way where men will have to sell their souls we call it the mark of the beast a joining of a system that's why i do not like systems regardless of where they are just don't like men or women or whoever we may be to worship god according to a system because where god is there is liberty now in this message i want to bring out a few little things because brother branham tells us that even when in the 60s when we voted in kennedy and all of us know what kennedy did kennedy interpreted the constitution in the way that he wanted to the constitution of america was set there to as a guideline it was to be uh uh obeyed it was i could say it like this it was actually the american bible if you want to say it this way but we find out that when the integration came through and men began to raise up and y'all know the the facts about uh martin luther king and all of the the inspiration in which he was undone uh it looked really good uh but we find out that his inspiration wasn't really of the lord my fact brother branham was saying how that he wished he could talk to this man uh to to to to uh warn him about what he's getting ready to do or what he was doing anyhow we realized amen what what leaving martin luther king what kennedy did who was a catholic who never would swear or or or or do an oath to freedom of religion and he was likened unto a pharaoh who did not know joseph that's in the third exodus message and brother adam began to tell us that what he did he broke the constitution and he interpreted the way he wanted to because he said when those two blacks wanted to go to another school and kennedy brought in the military force to make this thing happen every government every state the law was that they could make their own choices but the federal government stepped in and made those choices for the whole united states and then so it really brought a hardness to the people's heart see you can't make people do something they don't want to do the only way that this nation it would have changed if they would have waited on god but instead they we did not we forced the issue but understand the hearts of the people never was changed and we find out by god's grace brother adam said it like this according to the third exodus he said and we not we will not fight no sir and said i hope the nation can find out that we're not living anymore under a democracy but under military dictatorship since the 60s we have been living under dictatorship without even realizing it because satan knows how to hide his schemes and i want to say this because something when i was studying it it just moved against upon me because i can see that even now the person that we have in in power is moving in the same direction the man before he moved in that direction dictating to the people and let me say it like this so i you won't think it's my wording but america as i see it whether it's by uh everybody would see it or not but let me let me say it like this we will come into a place of dictatorship fully made manifest let me read what the prophet said he says watch now god did that exodus what preparations he made and study just a minute didn't look at today all right notice before this exodus there was a pharaoh who didn't know joseph see a pharaoh who didn't know joseph didn't know joseph what was joseph represented the spiritual part of the spiritual exodus they're raised up now we are freedom a woman was nourished for a time and a time in a dividing of time but finally there was a joseph or pharaoh dictator who knew not the freedom of religion uniting them together now i'm not finished with this because in the latter part of that same message brother branham said there come basically a president that would also acknowledge a cardinal that will then put us into bondage now you say well what do you mean but he goes on to say when you see that happening no it's time to get out of here so understand that our country though it be a land where we talk about freedom and anyway it's not going to remain that way because also the world council of churches will be involved in this and y'all we know the story they'll raise up now we are freedom right he goes on to say he said goes on but finally there raised up a joseph or dictator who knew not the freedom of religion united them together don't let it pass you listen listen let me go back but finally they'll raise up a joseph or pharaoh dictator who knew not the freedom of religion uniting them together and then he goes says don't let it pass you in other words i'm saying something to you you need to hear what i'm saying there'll come a time where there was a pharaoh first he had to come and the organization live lusciously uh lived as a grafted branch into the real vine of christianity but it's still bearing its original fruit women have dress men intellectuals and denying the power of the spirit but it lived under the name of christianity church christian church it's a grafted vine but the husband is coming by now to prune that vine and as he said he will do all those that don't have the fruit is cut off and thrown into the fire and consumed so what are you saying i'm saying we're at a time where the political realm is moving i love the way our brother ben said things are moving now and you can't even see them but that doesn't mean it's not moving and what people don't understand is that god ordained pharaoh pharaoh never was converted god ordained him hallelujah and these men whether they be evil or good god ordained them now you and i must understand that it's not going to get easier not for the moment things are going to come to a place to people would be will be glad for this system to come in play because everybody want to live but what profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul hallelujah that's the age we're living in you see it goes on for a long period of time noah preached 120 years so much so the people more than likely or the generation to come the generation to come the generation with noah went into the oc that generation that was lost only went by hearsay they didn't know noah's god hallelujah so is it in our united states they don't know our god right now we're at a time amen where men are being deceived and the bible says be careful in the last days right it goes on to say in the last days amen there'll be a narrow way a straight way hallelujah in that narrative straight way only a few be that find it but broad is the way that leader to destruction thank god for a prophet who told us that that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and we come to know god by his character hallelujah that's right and you don't know god if you don't have an intimate relationship with him that's how we come to know god i like that i told b and i really enjoyed that you and i must understand that we're at a place where you're going to be tried you're going to be tried in a way like you've never been tried before oh not the bride yes go listen to the message third exodus and see whether it be whether i'm right on that or not he said as it was then so shall it be now amen those were natural exodus but this is a spiritual exodus and right now the death angel is killing people right in church because it's the church who has become mr babylon the great absolutely how many was here and heard me tell about that now let me let me say it like this if it wasn't for the opening of the word all of us will still be blind hallelujah you know god is a god is a mighty god because you know in in in nosa when we read uh revelations and the bible said there were seven stars in his hand we never knew that one of those stars was going to be a gentile prophet and never before in history has there ever been a gentile prophet i'm not talking about just a little prophet i mean a major prophet where god himself steps in the human flesh is that right that's the truth because before before sodom burned god came down said i've heard the cry of the people is that right now we're seeing the same ufos unidentifying objects investigating the world going back to god and says hey it's just like sodom or worse hallelujah and if that be the case it's time for god to drop the fire [Music] hey they're now finding the place where sodom and gomorrah was we know at the dead sea but they can tell that everything god said came to pass from the fire and the brimstone right because they said even the software there was 98 and we don't have such a thing coming out of our volcanoes it's a far lesser percent i think a four percent of whatever it is i just read it now i can't remember exactly what it was but it showed that the sofa and the brimstone that came out of heaven came from somewhere not from this world hallelujah wherever it fell it consumed everything and the scientist said it rained fire and brimstone because the brimstone was on fire and it rained like pebbles you know god don't have to do that but he does it to help the unbeliever believe there it is now brother talks about we know this when brother adam was on the scene sir is this the time he wasn't certain of things now a lot of people say you probably said you shouldn't say that but he wasn't he was a man amen and during the time of his trying to figure out what this blast was all about can you imagine trying to put it all together about the seven angels coming to him in the doves and you know and a little you know and then these angels he didn't know that's why you'll hear him say could it be is it can it be because he himself had not a clear vision of it and you know the prophet god he wanted to be right he said i'm the kind of person that that has to shoot uh uh uh a squirrel in the center of his head i'm not the kind of man that could aim and because i hit him he dies and i'm okay no i am a perfect shooter i aim straight why was that because he was elijah he was a spirit that is you know god put on him this just that way he was the kind of man that wasn't gonna move from the word of god he was gonna stay straight with it so let me go on to say it so he didn't know for a long period of time you go go what's the attraction of the mountain he he talks about things like that too could it be and he said a lot of things that people took these pieces here and instead of examining in the sense that the prophet asked questions they took those statements as they were those questions as they were statements and they built doctrines all around it which caused confusion hallelujah but in the third exodus brother bannon ain't saying if you say well oh the seven thunders or the seven uh thunders were the seven messengers it could not have been in the sense that people say because those seven thunders amen were angels heavenly angels he said the angels yes angels of the lord visited me and he said the angels of the lord amen one every day was in my room and if it had been brother madame theophany that means he would have known the mystery of all the other six because the theophany knows everything so god was doing something see that's what i'm saying that's why brother said don't try to interpret just say what i say now listen that's what he said but you got to understand what time period the man is working with from 1962 all the way up to 1963 when the seals were broken y'all don't believe it yeah he didn't understand it but somebody said he was god he did not understand it and god allowed him to think it was his death now how can he think it he was agonizing he didn't fully understand he didn't understand amen a junior's jackson dream he was trying to see god didn't give him a full revelation of it until those seven angels that one blast became seven angels breaking through heaven lifted him up amen into uh uh the constellation hello that did the prophet lie did he come down and says hey i was lifted up in the constellation but i don't understand a thing is that what he said yes he said i did not understand every day an angel came and he taught me when i was in that little room a messenger came and he began to unfold the word to me it's the truth and what we need to see is that this message is beyond pentecost i fully understand it now it's beyond pentecost they have no idea of a seven thunder message they have no idea that the seals have been broken they don't know that they are in an age where god is spewing them out of their mouth i said something the last time i preached and i said the seven church ages was over and i used a quote of brother branham but there in the in the in the conduct and order i mean excuse the question and answers brother branham says no you must have misunderstood me or i didn't mean it that way wait a minute that's what he said i got the quote and he said no the church ages are not over until the bride leaves so i thought i better correct this because we're not gone yet so i want you to understand listen you got to understand the prophet of god he has several ministries falls of his ministry there was a time he was playing eliza right there was a time he was elijah you understand me and so he had different ministries that he was unfolding into and a lot of time if you don't know and then i want you to understand there were times he was just a preacher but everybody tried to pull it all together and that's why we've been having so many misunderstandings right let me go home go on he says there it is they don't know what it's all about the scientists are trying to anybody got a picture of it called called in a cloud 26 miles high in the shape of a pyramid seven angels represented seven angels represented in there brought back and brought you the word of god under the inspiration he didn't break the seals the lamb broke the seals you know i got i got a word for you this morning or this evening because a lot of times people and that's the way i was looking at it that gabrielle is different from christ or jesus how you want to say it i found that today but gabriel is another i can have god putting on another mask like micah right so when gabriel comes he's the archangel the top the top oh i got some i i just can't do that now but my point is is that whenever you see someone representing christ uh it is christ it is him but just got on a different mask who are you amen amen if christ is in you you're dead paul says not i that live but crisis lives in me and you and i represent jesus christ today hallelujah that's why even jesus christ said when you see me you see the father hallelujah that's deep that's deep listen it tells you these hours that you're coming and living in the spiritual mind will pick that right now see and get it it's an extra dust we're going to leave one of these days thanks be to god now we say oh this have to happen listen what he says and now anybody with spiritual understanding remember i keep quoting spiritual understanding right so let me ask you how many of you ever read the seventh seal and came out it with like i don't know what he's saying hello you know why because the seventh seal is still spoken in parables it's a mystery that only the elect would pick up give it to a colonel-minded man and you know what he's gonna say something wrong with this man's grandma i can't deal with this but the spiritual minded man can read that seven seal i'm not talking about one two three four five six i'm talking about the seventh seal he even comes back at the end of it and preaches another part to it and i was looking like oh my i'm going to get it this time but it's got to be a spiritual understanding hallelujah just like i spoke the last time those seven angels that we called thunders amen what were they they're the ones who actually broke out of the out of uh out of time broke into time peaked brother branham up they were the ones seven angels who formed into the pyramid who also was christ who also was the wig for christ that's right but even those seven angels still didn't know the day nor the hour that's why brother brandon went on to say listen it was those seven angels that unfolded the seals to me and he goes on to say now listen he said that that seventh seal had a threefold purpose i saw the first i saw the second but that last portion i could not interpret but he kept tying it into the coming of christ he kept tying it in to to to to the rapturing of the bride hallelujah and guess who comes to announce his coming gabriel oh you don't get it gabriel now how can gabriel come to announce a coming with no angels about says not even the angels in heaven knows but christ himself listen it listen i i i don't know whether i can have time to but anyway he says listen let's put gabriel came to to to to to elizabeth and her husband and her husband disbelieved and gabriel said because you have disbelieved my word you shall remain dumb but why didn't he say because you have you did not you didn't believe the word of the lord no he said my word what was it it was still christ it was still god amorphy hallelujah and it was gabriel who gave mary the name jesus there's a name change in here and i'm the father of this thing and i got some quotes so i i i i want you to understand his name going to be named jesus because he's he's stepping into another move he's stepping into another position and he shall save his people from their sins oh god help us jesus you love the lord see we are at a time that you and i must understand amen that the seven seals and the seven thunders is the bride's revival this whole message that we have received amen is to give us rapturing faith by which way to know that you've been chosen and elected to hear this blessed is a man that heareth blesses the one who sees it listen it's not you gotta understand the fundamental of the gospel he became our sin that we might become his righteousness god know who you are he knows where you come from hallelujah i'm talking about i got down here i'm gonna jump to my nose because this is really good he says listen i call it the strand the strand all of us have a strand a dna strand you know i mean people say well brother brooks the older you get the more you look like your daddy i like that hallelujah why because the older we get the more we stay around the world now if you got it in you you got to be born again you got to have his dna in you and that dna strand will make you look like him walk like him talk like him act like him that's what makes us different than all the other christians is to see the seed germ of god that's in us don't make no difference what you go through he that begun the good work in you he's faithful to complete it how many of y'all y'all know it's the truth many of us right now got shortcomings and we want them to disappear and you done prayed and you done prayed and they still there you know why because you won't get rid of it until god is ready for you to get rid of it but he wants you to cry out he wants you to cry out to get rid of it oh come on somebody it's the truth brother bannon was sick with that disease how many stomach disease he cried out just like paul did paul wanted to be delivered god never lost his power but there was a purpose that he was using that devil there amen to do with him to bring him into the position that he wanted him to be in hallelujah god will allow you to fall god allows you to come short he'll cause you or allow you to fall on your face but it's not that he's getting rid of you he's trying to train you first of all if you don't come to a place to know that this is about grace you're still lost okay don't make no difference how much how much message you say you got hallelujah amen yes sir listen so you got to understand this thing got to be uh uh uh um understood spiritually you organize and reorganize and organize and organize and now she's confederate and joining with something else the iniquity is filled up it's time for an exodus time for the calling out to be the to the promised land not the promise just another country to go to but a home the millennium the time for calling out the iniquity of this nation strike on it again tonight the lord's willing is filled up she is filthy because god couldn't move until the iniquities of the amorites was full he's saying it's full then if it's already full since 1963 what are we doing what what what are we living on other than the grace of god and god is not we're not waiting on god god's waiting on us it's christ only it's christ's only people you must be the seed of god or there is no rapture for you it's christ only and listen you can get down on this thing and you can beat all night until you receive what god has spoken to you you'll get off of this this this uh your knees steal the center the message is what we must receive not oh i believe the message that means nothing the devil believes you got to receive what he says i'm bride i'm seed hallelujah i'm a special class of people hallelujah is that right i'm a covenant people unconditional somebody help me here i said unconditional covenant it's not what we do for him is what he's already done for us paul said i'm a press toward the mark of our calling i'm oppressed nothing is against me but i want to see the living christ in me hallelujah this is to bring us uh bring us the rapturing faith right it's an exodus of the wheat you see what i'm saying because what's getting ready to happen and we see it already there's a bundling and there's a bundle it's amazing how they they used to come i don't have a tv but they used to come on tv talk about bundling i think your ipad and your iphone in your computer that would be speaking stuff you know showing you what season we're living in we're living in the season of the bundling hallelujah but the bible says amen that also he would also bring the wheat into his garnish gardener is that right into his place of hiding hallelujah come on somebody there's only one place to hide and that's in christ jesus matthew 13 turn with me there matthew 13. now i'm just starting i'm just trying to throw these things out at you because i realize we're living in the last days and if we don't understand our message our message is to get right with god right and the truth of the matter is you can't get right with god without neology that's the bible revelation third chapter laodicea you can have me if you repent and the bible says be zealous to repent that's what he said and you and i must understand that repentance is not an emotional workup even repentance is a gift from god hallelujah matthew 13 beginning at the 36th verse you know we look at these things and we see how god is working people don't like for you to preach on their wrong doing but i'll just say it like this there was not one man who was worthy to loose the book not one man worthy to loose the seals or to look on them hallelujah there was only one man and that was christ jesus don't you ever forget it because if you think you're worthy of anything you are deceived all of us are worthy of hell hallelujah it is the grace of god that makes us worthy none of your works will work it's good to have good works it's good to have a good name hallelujah but you must understand it is the grace of god that gives you the holy ghost is that right why are you why are you not connected like the brother says why you haven't become a part of the system and if you are part of the system god sent a powerful message last sunday and said get rid of that thing oh i'm i'm part of the message i'm in the message what that means if the message ain't in you god don't dwell in your head god dwells in your heart hallelujah hey i thought lord that's it you got to have a real relationship the whole message is about relationship with god because that's what we lost in genesis hallelujah matthew 13. you love the lord i'm not going to be too long too much longer i don't think but i you know i look at this thing and i says here the scriptures are right in our faces you know you think people would be running the church but i guarantee you they home looking at tv somewhere and you know what they ain't looking at the service most of them are looking at whatever they want to look at y'all understand me what is it they're deceived people are deceived because they say oh i know brother branham is the prophet the devil knows that huh oh look at the millions of people oh more than moses he's the true prophet you and i must understand that this this thing is getting closer it's closer i don't know whether y'all heard what i heard i wasn't even here but when i listened to the man and what he brought it it did something and if it didn't do something to you you need to get on your knees and ask god for mercy it was powerful just absolutely powerful now and understand what i'm saying i'm not bragging on the brother i thank god that he made himself available and i told him that but what i see is that god came and visited us god visited us he told us things that a lot of people can't even see that message god visited us you need to take heed and if you didn't hear it the first time go back and get it again listen i i can't express what i was going through and what i what i yeah just amazing how many times you say oh lord i ain't no good he said don't you even dare say that about yourself when you are the elected seed of god did y'all catch that one somebody should have been shouting but everybody was so quiet i'm like whoa that's something i don't hear nothing hardly anything i heard a few voices but not many matthew 13 i said ooh they getting licks hallelujah i was glad i told you i told a friend of mine who said now if that had been me they wouldn't have received it but thank god hallelujah i got being coming back soon amen listen in the 36th verse it says then jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man which is a prophet the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one how can people say that where did the wicked one come from the wicked one you can find him in genesis came from the order of cain not from god it was a perversion of the devil and those same wicked ones are ruling the earth right now because this is satan's eden what a dump the enemy that sold them is the devil the harvard is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels so we know that the harvest is the end of the world where is it in the world now this is the end time shall be no more everything is running out hallelujah every kingdom that started amen in genesis ends up in revelation and those kingdoms that ended up in revelation that was started by satan himself was totally destroyed and all of his people was thrown into the lake of fire people say god god mean no he's not mean he can't help being who he is hallelujah he knows all things he sees all things he doesn't make you live holy but it gives you the choice and listen none of us can live holy on ourselves of ourselves so we seek the god that can bring us to holiness and that is the holy ghost that's why we preach the holy ghost because you can't live holy without him hallelujah right and as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world sounds like something it sounds like malachi 4 right maleficent he said that that that it's going to burn right it sounds sounds like an elijah ministry and you you and i must understand by god's grace that if it wasn't the end of the world we would not have had elijah but elijah has come and gone and so what are we going to do now amen we are the children of the prophecy and as his word in malachi 4 was prophesied luke 17 30 that prophecy became how can i say that the prophecy came it was fulfilled and you and i must be a fulfilling of the word when it comes to the bride of jesus hallelujah listen let me move on and the son of man shall send forth his angels and they should gather out of his kingdom and all things that offend and them which do eve what iniquity when you know to do good and do it does not when you keep your house dirty and you know you need to clean it up hallelujah i ain't talking about your house on the street corner i'm talking about this body because the bible said the body is the temple of the holy ghost and god will not indwell in nothing that's unclean hallelujah we did not know that just being sanctified was good enough it ain't i'm holy and sanctified that's good but you've got to go all the way you got to die and write to yourself that god can live in you i don't know about you but that's my ultimate goal that god will live fully in me i want to be like those of the old that when he nods i'll know what he wants me to do listen it should cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth what is that what has cast them into a furnace of fire tribulation period folks that's when the bomb hits hallelujah that's when the earthquake shakes did you know oh i oh i heard some things i had never heard before but i know that the earthquake in the rapture is tied together there's coming a great earthquake and it's tied together with the coming with the rapturing of the church listen i'm gonna tell you watch our politics just as soon as this thing switch over to what it's going to switch over to you better make sure you got it right hallelujah because when satan starts moving he's moving in a fierce way oh you ain't gonna have no house to go to look what they did that same demonic power look what they did to the jews do you think they're going to spare you no because it's the same demons the same devils that came up out of the euphrates during world war one amen you know where they are here in america and everywhere else they settled in hollywood but now there are principalities and powers set up all over the world and the bible said god put in their hearts to give the power over to the beast how are you going to escape there's only one way to escape and that is in christ jesus hallelujah listen let me move on i could yeah listen so you and i know what listen and in this parable the reapers are not the messengers they are angels with appear at the end to bring the final exodus of the wheat from amongst the tears now you say well what do you mean like you understand me the angels let's say martin luther and wesley and all of them they were just like brother bannon they didn't know they're calling at the first god had to work with them for them to see who they were if they ever came to the fullness of that knowledge hallelujah it took brother branham years before he saw himself as the elijah hallelujah but there was always a thirst in his heart to know that there was something else coming forth he knew it that his ministry could not be completed until whatever it is pulling on him would he would be fulfilled y'all don't understand can you imagine a prophet who's able to see things and understands things and things like that but yet god is holding something and he's not understanding what what is this i know it's something great coming from god but i don't know hallelujah but when those angels picked him up and took him into that pyramid there was no more questions there was no more doubting about it hallelujah you understand me those questions he asked in search is the time god answered hallelujah and when it came to those that's why i tried to tell you that third that third fold of those seven seals if you want to put it the third fold of the seventh seal i might have said that wrong it's a mystery that even brother branham didn't know he said i saw it but i couldn't interpret it but he always go back to is the coming of the lord see because no man knows the day not the hour but you and i have been given the first pull we've been given the second pool and we've been given the third pool what is the third pool the opening of the word it is a manifestation of what god did in this hour not a man amen it was god somebody helped me it's the truth it was all god you say oh i know that i know listen listen it's one thing to know it here your actions will tell me and everybody else whether you know it here and the servants are the ones who work during the ages to to nurture and to prepare the wheat for the for the harvest that's what my job is to help nurture and prepare you for the wheat for the harvest huh that's what i'm here for to resound what has already been sounded as the revelation breaks as it began to unfold to us hallelujah that's what it's doing everybody that went on a shipwreck you know with the thunders and and the presence and they all shipwrecked why because they failed to wait and we allowed our intellectualism to get in the way but i believe with all my heart that this is the hour we're living in right now where god is making the vision plain making it clear oh brother brooks what are you saying i'm looking and i'm in expectation of a work of god in me that only those seven angels is ordained to do oh god in the exodus of the week see that's what a lot of times people think it's all over no no no no no we don't pass we're struggling with the church we're struggling with uh the uh uh uh virtues we're struggling with them don't you understand that what took place at the top there is out of the seventh that's the eighth day that's what we call the eighth age that's the holy convocation that's a different thing here because if you notice that these are connected together in such a way it it's it's it's it's earthly but here the headstone had to come down amen right and you and i must understand that god has been so gracious to us i love to say it like this let me say it like this is the way i see it you know i'm not trying to add to it but i look look at brotherly kindness like like it's the landing pad for divine love it's the platform that we all must reach hello now you said brother brooks uh are you insane let me say it like this every time god got ready to do something he dispatched an angel well no matter what prophet it was he dispatched an angel guess what who came to gay who came to mary gabriel and who was gabriel but christ right he comes to mary and tell her you're gonna have a son didn't he tell you that what's your son gonna be named jesus you're gonna have a son she said well how how can it be when i don't have a denominational bishop i don't have a pope for a husband i don't have a system for a husband how can this thing be because the holy ghost is going to overshadow you glory [Music] and that's all she said brother and that's all we can say be it unto us according to your word hallelujah listen let me move on because i'm moving too slow there's a little preacher one time a prophet who had a double portion elijah he went ball-headed he and when he was a young man some of the little children running behind him teasing him bald-headed ball-headed and he turned around and put a curse on those children in the name of the lord and two she-bears killed 42 little children is that scripture no that wasn't the holy spirit the nature of god would have wanted would not have wanted that you said what are you saying now my point is i'm showing you just the tab of the character christ because there's no way i can finish what i want to do tonight but the point is the character of christ will not curse the enemy you got to love your enemy the character of christ in this hour is to love your enemy hey the character of christ in this hour must forgive your enemy hallelujah is that right i'm talking about raptured material i i know i know there's uh different doctrines about the thunders and all that and i'm not trying to be uh contrary but i really do think that people have made things a mess because all they had to do was really listen and see what brother random said about a lot of things because if it's true revelation it will produce what it's saying it's going to produce but i find out that a lot of people in the message even preach us they don't even have love for one another how can you have such a great revelation like that and you can't even love your enemy or your friend yeah but you got the thunders see you gotta understand the character of christ the character of christ is different and the bride must have the character that's the only way you're gonna know him you know god by his character if he says something if he promised something it's yes amen oh abraham you're going to have a son i don't care how long it takes abraham says i know he said it i believe him because i know his character and he cannot lie understand the word cannot lie you know many people believe that these seven thunders are seven men come on those men didn't pick brother ran them up angels did and they were the one holding the mysteries they came to his room during church service of before church and explained to him what what it was hallelujah he didn't know he tried all kinds of books and everything else and tried to do it himself but when god came on the scene he even said to the people have you noticed did you see what was going on did anybody pick up what was going on basically what he said with everything i was struggling with god is now unfolding it unto us right now who help us jesus enticing spirit he says i say today my people that really wanting to find god they won't let no church dictate to them the things that they can't live that or that other if you got the nature of god in you you'll go to holiness you go the right thing you'll stand for the right things you do the right things you will think the right things you'll live the right things and if you are duck you like water and if you're a christian you're like christ if you're a devil you like the things of the devil if you're a buzzard you'll eat dead things if you are pig you eat maduro where you are you at today right you claiming to be up here eating the things of the lord then go down and root with the devil there's something wrong with it quit listening to them spirits they're devils no matter if you have to stand alone men and women that ever attend amount to anything nearly he didn't say have to he says nearly has been men and women who stood along with god that's what i said people think god is god is not fair but he's more than fair i'm going to start with this scripture ii peter 1 4. you love the lord whereby given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so let me say it like this he was fashioned and likened on earth and came with the nature of a man so that he could be tried and so he could be tempted as a man and in return he gives us his nature his divine nature right if you're going to be compatible with god you must have the same nature right and so god in this last day the bride of jesus christ who has a special covenant with god uh it's coming this last day so and you know what i tell you what if if you can hear what i'm trying to say and put what was said sunday back to together it literally relieved the pressure because you understand as brother uh then say if you are 10 that's all you're going to be is a 10. don't try to be a 12 just be a good 10. right be who you are and what god has made you amen listen and in all ages god had men and he had had his ministry in every age god is supernatural and when god comes on the scene supernatural take place for he is supernatural let me say it like this folks we're too busy we're too busy you got to make time for god and that making time for god is making time for yourself you've got to pray i can't exist you know that's why most people don't pray most people don't even read their bibles and call us christians whoo y'all got quiet and when god comes on the scene just a simple brother branham how do we make the rapture simple read your bible and pray every day and we can't even do the simplicity we can't even do the simple huh read your bible every day he didn't say you had to read the whole thing get you some scriptures pull something out of that you know y'all you get the bible like you got to read the whole book in one hour no ask the lord to direct you where to go but you need to be fed you need something in your system every day hallelujah god is supernatural and when god comes on the scene supernatural takes place for he is supernatural and his people always look for him in the supernatural because when they become sons of god they become the nature of god amen hello when you become sons of god or daughters of god you become the nature of god in that they pick up that believing him by faith they believe that what god says is true and no matter how contrary it may seem hallelujah they're going to believe it i'ma close it here because i you know we're looking at things and let me tell you let's say it like this you may be as ignorant as a rock but if god is in you you're a son of god i'm so glad that god didn't say you had to have a certain level of intelligence to make it you know what makes it your faith in him because your faith will bring action you really believe his word it'll change you because it's life and here you are believing that god sent a prophet when the world can't see it here you are believing somebody that looked like noah right you going in the awkward noah let me tell y'all something brother adam knew he was going off the scene and he basically tells us that he's going off the scene because he said once i'm done my ministry is done i'm gone hallelujah shows us joshua who is jesus christ himself hello the real hey christ was in moses job all the patriots that was christ you think david had enough courage to take on a bear a lion oh you know what some of us can't even take on a spider you know what i'm saying it takes god it's god and you folks don't fail god he won't fail you my point is you stop thinking about what you are let me how can i say it your failures even took care of all of that it doesn't mean that you know as long as you win this thing you're gonna make mistakes but the bible said a just man get up seven times in a day in other words you make it right amen that's why paul said i got to kill this thing see if you kill it it'll stay dead for a while you got to kill him every day every time he raises his head you knock him down with the word people of god we are blessed people special people i can't even i can't even preach it the way i feel i i really can't i just feel so good and i just see things that i the lord is uh showing me you know and i'm just seeing stuff that i stumped only because i listen to other interpretations before i listen to the prophet you understand what i'm saying you hear people preaching and they can take a quote and put a quote here put a quote here but then when you start that season began to unfold because you understand this at the same time that god the devil was trained trained in ramses god had a moses so understand that what god is doing here he's training us he's getting us to see who we are and that's the thing if you don't understand your relationship to the thunders you won't even understand who you are because everybody don't get it that's a mystery and that thing has to be personally identified and revealed to you personally do you think the revelation of the thunder is going to come over the pulpit uh-uh god gonna give it to you in your in your secret closet that's why you know you don't pray just let the devil don't don't pray just don't pray don't pray and see whether you get what you need for this hour don't pray is that right because the bible said whatever you do in the secret in your closet i reward you openly when brother branham needed something he needed he went to pray he had his cave he had his places where he could go and find fellowship with god so god could explain to him what what was so and so you need god i need him and we need to pray more this is the hour of prayer the bible says amen those vials that they had amen was what the prayers are the saints i hope some of y'all got a few drops in there let's stand i'm not finished with this i'm just beginning i just i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying my best you know um i all i know is what i deserve excuse me i deserve what i desire and my desire is uh to see the word fully made manifested me uh so much so till like brother branham said the brother get to a place where the devil won't know what to do with her that's what i want to be that's the way i want to be i examine myself every day i have faults just like everybody else but i'm looking at i'm looking for a time that something supernatural is going to happen in my life and i trust that you're looking for the same thing that god will approve the life that's in me and set me out as he did jesus christ his own son hear ye him that's what brother ellen said i believe with all my heart that everybody need to have a mountain transfiguration experience i believe that every individual need to know like he said in that day you know i am in the father the father's in me and i am in you we are we we worry about such stuff [Music] i just wonder how people christians who are in other countries who don't have much clothing they don't have fancy stuff they don't have a fancy house they don't have to worry about things you know some people don't even have cones or toothbrushes they don't they don't have a change of shoes but one thing they do they have god think about that woman who the seraphinisian woman who like things didn't have much the woman amen who was uh to her last little meal she and her sons were gonna die you think that she was worried about the way she looked no you think the bride of jesus christ cared because let me tell you something all these little luxuries you don't have to you don't have to worry god gonna make you get rid of them [Music] huh everything's gonna be shut down oh yeah you're gonna get rid of him because he's gonna make it happen just like the jews they were actually stripped from their homes the same demons the same demons we're getting ready to face is the same demons that his body hitler and all of the rest of them the same demons who didn't have no mercy kill little children put them in the gas chamber all that when you say well brother looks we're not going to experience that all i know is brother branham said that we'll crest every wave he didn't say the wave wasn't coming he said we'll crest every way he did say that churches like this will be shut down [Music] huh you won't be able to buy oh we won't live to see yes we will that's what you call the squeeze when the confederacy comes upon the churches and say you either join with us or you can't buy or sell you can't do this and you can't do that you said that cannot be they're coming to a place right now if you don't wear a mask [Music] you can't buy or sell huh you got to have something more than religion it's got to be real and i'll tell you what i just pray for my i pray lord have mercy on me because one thing i know i won't confess that but i'll just say this i need just as much mercy and grace as y'all [Music] i'm only up here because this is what god chose me to do he chose me but i'm a man like elijah of like passion i need to pray just like you need to pray i need his grace like you need his grace i need his mercy just like you need his mercy but anyway anyhow i just that's about the word of prayer father we come before you lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for being so good to us only you know what what's in the hearts of the people father god i thank you right now for your amazing grace how you chose to have mercy and grace upon us and how you open our eyes that we can see we're not alone and we never can be alone because you said so the bible says the angel of the lord and camp about us lord you're always there you're always trying to influence us in a good way and i pray father that you give us the grace to be obedient to feel and to know the direction you want us to move into we're coming at a time where your coming is right at hand the world is getting ready to change and lord it can happen overnight like it was in germany tanks rolling through yards just overnight lord you we see what's happening in these other states and we see the the government getting involved and yes there's a need but lord how far will the enemy take this thing you and i lord we know that this thing this whole persecution is going to turn toward the christian because lord our civilization is not of this world we are of a faith civilization and father not the science or the intellectual lord help us jesus to stand the oncoming storm may our house be built upon the rock christ jesus the revelation of who he is and may we see the revelation of who we are in christ bless each and every one tonight touch them now in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] so [Music] mercy rewrote my life oh soul cast down [Music] my life [Music] rewrote my life oh
