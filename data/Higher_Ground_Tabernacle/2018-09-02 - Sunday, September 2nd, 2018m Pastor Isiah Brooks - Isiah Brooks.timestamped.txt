[16:45] bow father we come before your Lord as
[16:49] humbly as we know how we've come to this
[16:53] place in our day and time where you have
[16:58] given us a message and father you chose
[17:02] us out of millions to worship you and to
[17:06] serve you and father we realized that
[17:10] this is not a time of giving up this is
[17:13] not a time to quit or to turn back you
[17:18] never told us that the way would be easy
[17:20] for you say it O God our Father that if
[17:23] any man would be your disciple he must
[17:26] take up his cross and follow you and
[17:29] father we realize that the cross is a
[17:31] heavy burden to carry especially
[17:35] in this day according to your profit you
[17:37] he told us that this day was the most
[17:41] evilest age of all ages and yet you
[17:44] chose us insignificant people law to
[17:48] take your cross to take the Word of God
[17:52] and run into the day of the rapture
[17:55] father we realized that all everybody is
[17:58] being attacked or God in so many ways

[23:47] be coming from Matthew the fourth
[23:49] chapter Matthew 4 Hebrews 10
[24:10] Matthew the fourth chapter Hebrews 10
[24:14] and then will be coming from Psalm 63
[24:18] and 3 Matthew 4 fourth verse but he
[24:26] answered and said it is written man
[24:30] shall not live by bread alone but by
[24:36] every word that proceedeth out of the
[24:39] mouth of God
[24:40] Hebrews 10:38 everybody believe that
[24:49] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today

[24:54] heart
[24:55] Hebrews 10:38 now the judge
[25:06] live by faith but if any man draw back
[25:11] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[25:18] but we are not of them who draw back
[25:22] unto perdition but of them that believe
[25:25] to the saving of the soul one more
[25:30] scripture Psalm 63 and 3 thank you Jesus
[25:49] for your grace and your mercy Lord Psalm
[25:52] 63 and 3 because thy loving-kindness is
[25:58] better than life my lips shall praise

[26:14] dear Jesus once again as we come to you
[26:20] we thank you for your amazing grace
[26:24] father we're living at a time where only
[26:29] a few will make it press you on every
[26:33] hand many are surrendering to the
[26:38] adversaries lies but father you said
[26:41] you'll never leave yourself without a
[26:43] witness and father we thank your father
[26:46] as we spoke or you spoke Lord when the
[26:51] enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit
[26:54] of God lifts up a standard and father we
[26:58] as the body of Christ love to be that
[27:04] standard in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[27:07] amen
[27:08] you may be seated
[27:13] I like to entitle my message tonight
[27:19] this morning life what is it or what is
[27:27] life if I had a theme it would be living
[27:34] to live when we think about the
[27:42] beginning and understand there are more
[27:45] than one life there's two kind according
[27:49] to the message we realized there is a
[27:51] real life genuine and there is what we
[27:56] call a perverted life and understand
[28:01] that in the beginning when Eve took the
[28:09] devil's bait he offered her life offered
[28:16] her a better life but in reality we
[28:22] realized that the life he offered her
[28:24] was not life it was death and we
[28:30] realized by God's grace that that death
[28:32] have rain and was raining and in some
[28:35] people's lives still raining but the
[28:39] Bible said that death reigned - Jesus
[28:41] came now when we think about life a lot
[28:47] of times many of us think about just
[28:49] breathing the breath of life but even
[28:54] those who are dead lives because the
[28:58] Bible
[28:58] that if a woman lives in pleasure she's
[29:00] already dead and we understand by God's
[29:05] grace that there are definitions that
[29:09] maybe the dictionary tried to give and
[29:14] one of the definitions of life is is the
[29:17] condition that distinguishes organisms
[29:20] from in organ organic organic objects in
[29:24] other words of birds verses a rock a
[29:27] bird has life in a rock doesn't but we
[29:33] realize a man that it's also something
[29:37] that is manifested by way of growth and
[29:40] metabolism something that can reproduce
[29:43] or something that has their power to
[29:46] update to environmental things changes
[29:50] and things of that nature
[29:51] now we don't believe in the evolution in
[29:54] which which the scientists talks about
[30:00] but because of life we all have adapted
[30:04] where the venom tells us that because we
[30:07] are different colors have come by way of
[30:13] a Baptist there's one time we were one
[30:17] people of one language the Continental
[30:20] Divide brought us to a different place
[30:23] we ate of the soil some of us became
[30:26] black some of us became white some of us
[30:29] whatever the original was we all changed
[30:32] and understand by God's grace but we
[30:36] were all of one blood but because of
[30:39] life the inaturalist
[30:42] were able to maintain a continue on in
[30:46] our environment I mean just to say that
[30:52] let's say it like the European they have
[30:54] the smaller nose or the thin nose and
[30:57] that nose were given to them so that the
[31:00] cold air wouldn't go directly to their
[31:02] brain that would kill them but those of
[31:06] us who are black we have the wider nose
[31:08] and I like by
[31:11] and it was given to us so that because
[31:14] of the heat we didn't need to shut it
[31:16] off we needed it to survive so God
[31:24] didn't make a mistake and he allowed
[31:27] these things to take place but we are
[31:30] all of one blood sad to say Amen because
[31:36] of sin being a one blood causes all of
[31:40] us to die now there's nothing wrong with
[31:46] life in itself God said that he would
[31:50] that we all prosper even as our soul
[31:53] prosper so there's nothing wrong with
[31:58] prosperity job was a man who was wealthy
[32:02] he prospered but one thing job had that
[32:07] a lot of the others in his day did not
[32:09] have job had a different kind of life he
[32:15] had the real kind
[32:17] according to Cleese Yancy's 815 says
[32:20] then i commended Murr
[32:21] because a man have no better thing under
[32:25] the Sun than to eat and to drink and to
[32:27] be merry for that shall abide with him
[32:30] of his labor the days of his life which
[32:35] God giveth him under the Sun so being
[32:38] able to prosper it's God's giving us
[32:40] something he's giving us a great thing
[32:43] in life this life but understand this
[32:48] life has an ending to it I'm living to
[32:52] live and she that's the difference with
[32:57] Adam and Eve they did not understand
[32:59] Adam did but he was to see she really
[33:03] had the genuine life she had something
[33:08] going on amen that she was not aware of
[33:12] if she had not if they had not sinned
[33:15] then we would not be afflicted in the
[33:17] way that we are you know there was no
[33:22] glasses
[33:23] in Eden and for those of us who wear
[33:27] them we know it's not going to get
[33:30] better every year because prescriptions
[33:34] get a little thicker why because it's
[33:39] something though we live we're dying in
[33:42] the flesh we're dying people you're
[33:45] dying this there's got to be something
[33:47] and let me say it like this every one of
[33:50] us has a thirst every one of us are not
[33:55] satisfied everyone there's only one true
[34:00] status at efficacious satisfying portion
[34:03] and that is the Holy Ghost why do you
[34:07] think you get lonely when you have
[34:11] friends why do you think Amen you feel
[34:16] all alone sometimes when there's so many
[34:18] people in the room you still feel that
[34:20] emptiness ah because there is a call
[34:24] it's a higher calling in your life God
[34:28] is trying to shake you and wake you
[34:31] trying to make you know that there's
[34:33] something that's greater than this the
[34:40] danger of this is this calling your life
[34:43] is is that sometimes people they try to
[34:46] rush it they become drug addicts
[34:51] alcoholics - nikita's
[34:55] adulteress all of this because there's a
[34:58] thirst something is trying to feel that
[35:01] life that hole in your heart something
[35:03] is you see but there's only one thing
[35:07] they can feel that that little spot in
[35:12] your heart can only be filled by God
[35:16] that little thing that that causes you
[35:19] to to be miserable sometime cry at night
[35:24] and sometime cry in the morning he is
[35:29] just is this God is calling you that
[35:32] light that is above this life
[35:36] right Davis said that loving-kindness is
[35:40] better than life huh
[35:44] what could be better than this I don't
[35:49] know where I read the Franklin is but
[35:51] some of y'all may not know who she is
[35:52] but I don't know where she is but I
[35:57] remember Amen when she was a little girl
[36:00] he meant you said how do you remember I
[36:02] had a dream about her years ago I saw
[36:05] the whole Aretha Franklin life my wife I
[36:10] tell you I've told this dream many time
[36:11] way before she died I saw all of that
[36:15] but she was really a female Judas who
[36:23] literally knew what the Holy Ghost felt
[36:26] she was one of those people and then
[36:28] that width and she tasted of the land
[36:31] she knew the joy of the Holy Ghost even
[36:34] said it on television she knew she had
[36:37] the Holy Ghost now she didn't have it in
[36:40] her soul but she had it she knew what
[36:46] the feeling of God was about but instead
[36:48] she chose the world you know she wasn't
[36:53] the first
[36:54] he was the first Eve understood him in
[36:59] the presence of the Lord she knew what
[37:00] it was all about but she chose the world
[37:04] now she's got to deal with a perverted
[37:07] life before he fell she had no pain she
[37:12] didn't know what it was
[37:15] what is it sisters that you and I go
[37:19] through are you brothers and sisters
[37:21] because brothers go to it too we call it
[37:24] meant appalls and on the brother side we
[37:31] call it the change of life what is it
[37:34] there's something on the inside that
[37:36] recognize you're dying and you're
[37:38] struggling for life hmm
[37:41] y'all know what I'm talking about when
[37:43] you see a 56 year old man or 70 year old
[37:46] man driving a sports car
[37:50] that's called change of life there's
[37:57] something in him that wants to remain
[37:59] young oh it's the same way with sisters
[38:04] sometime they don't even know what's
[38:05] going on them own with them but they
[38:07] want to be young again they do things
[38:12] that they don't normally do they wear
[38:14] clothes and things that they normally
[38:15] wouldn't do but they're do it anyway
[38:17] because they just feel like it and all
[38:22] it is is a change in life don't scorn
[38:25] them they can't help it just be there
[38:28] when they when you need they need you
[38:32] because one thing for sure brothers and
[38:35] sisters you're coming there too if the
[38:37] launcher Terry you're coming there too
[38:40] so that you'll know that I know what I'm
[38:43] talking about at the age of 40 I started
[38:45] going through my change at 45 I was
[38:50] insane from 45 to 50 totally with the
[38:58] Holy Ghost I was going through changes
[39:03] and doing things and think of things
[39:05] that you know it was just stupid but my
[39:11] wife and I started around the same time
[39:14] we talked about it I said honey when you
[39:17] see I need some space give me some space
[39:19] when I see you need space I'm gonna give
[39:20] you some right cuz that's the way it is
[39:24] you got to talk about it there was a
[39:28] time you know my wife would have
[39:30] everybody over con all over dinner come
[39:32] on over dinner
[39:33] all of a sudden Wow oh she don't mind I
[39:36] better be careful

[39:43] in one day so and I was sitting there
[39:48] wondering what is going on with my wife

[39:53] through changes people who come to my
[39:56] office they come up to my office for for
[39:59] for for counseling and I'm sitting there
[40:02] oh praise the Lord you
[40:03] yes whatever I can do but inside of me I
[40:06] was screaming but that's what it does it
[40:15] just somehow you can't explain it but
[40:18] you know that you're not in your right
[40:19] mind and guess what seem like you have
[40:22] no control we have no control at that
[40:27] time is when you need a friend at that
[40:32] time is when you really need somebody to
[40:35] talk to somebody to listen and not reply
[40:40] a good listener that's what I had you
[40:48] understand me
[40:49] but see that's in this life every animal
[40:52] watch it doesn't make any different you
[40:54] hit an animal on the street with the car
[40:57] all of a sudden you see them shaking in
[40:59] there and what are they doing they're
[41:01] fighting to remain to contain the life
[41:03] that they have in them even animals and
[41:06] we're part animal
[41:07] and so therefore we fight for it we
[41:09] fight for it but it doesn't make any
[41:11] difference your hair is gonna grow gray
[41:13] or ball like mine or both it is what it
[41:19] is you don't stay young all your life
[41:22] but that's what this life has given us
[41:25] this life gave us death this life gave
[41:33] us death I remember a sister said well I
[41:38] don't remember going through my
[41:40] menopause and she had been married three
[41:45] times she didn't have to remember her
[41:53] rector tells us now hear what I'm saying
[41:58] you must understand Amen by God's grace
[42:01] amen that we are in a a time body this
[42:05] body is based upon time and in order to
[42:11] save this body you must know one person
[42:16] they asked of eternal life am I making
[42:20] any sense now we talk about satisfying
[42:23] portion the only way that you're gonna
[42:27] come out of this disturb oh you know my
[42:31] thing is it's a blessing you know
[42:33] everybody loves nice things and and if
[42:36] you're not careful the devil of poodle
[42:37] trick over your eyes he'll make you lust
[42:42] and thirst out of after things other
[42:44] than God yeah I used to have such a bad
[42:51] habit that whenever I got depressed I
[42:54] usually eat or go buy something
[43:01] something that I thought was gonna make
[43:03] me feel good see y'all won't tell those
[43:04] stories but I'll tell it but you see
[43:08] what it was it was a devil amen making
[43:12] me try to feel this thing in my heart
[43:14] with something that was never going to
[43:17] satisfy me nothing in this world's gonna
[43:22] satisfy that first and why did God put
[43:26] that thirst in you so that you at the
[43:29] Day of Judgment will never say God I
[43:33] never thirst after you everyman thirst
[43:38] for the Living God even when Indians in
[43:42] here in America they didn't know God
[43:45] many of them didn't but they had
[43:49] something it's in you to worship it's in
[43:55] you to always look up there's gotta be
[43:58] somebody higher than I it's in you
[44:02] you're gonna worship a stone a frog a
[44:05] monkey or something you've gone to
[44:09] worship and sometimes it's worship of
[44:11] self you go worship something you're
[44:19] gonna try to feel this thing with
[44:23] something and brothers
[44:26] even brother branham said it like this
[44:28] he said that's where most men make their
[44:32] big mistakes is when they're going
[44:34] through a change of life when you go
[44:39] through a change of life you feel like
[44:41] nobody loves you you go through a state
[44:45] of paranoia people can say whatever they
[44:47] want to say to you and you're gonna
[44:49] twist it when you go through a change of
[44:53] life a man you feel so isolated and
[44:55] alone nobody understands me it is what
[45:00] it is you're dying
[45:04] and every one of us has will die in that
[45:09] manner except God takes us in a rapture
[45:12] it's just okay
[45:14] I'm living to live I'm gonna fight you
[45:19] see I was in such a bad state you know
[45:23] all men don't go through this the way I
[45:25] did but there were some brothers that I
[45:28] knew I didn't know them but I was told
[45:30] by my because that went through worse
[45:31] than I did because I would tell him
[45:34] something wrong with me here I'm crying
[45:36] and can't help but cry sometime and
[45:38] don't know why I'm crying and you know
[45:40] my wife would say something to me and my
[45:42] feelings get hurt not just my wife just
[45:48] anybody how I want you to understand I
[45:50] probably hurt her feelings too at times
[45:53] that I didn't even know it
[45:55] but we're sensitive because we're dying
[45:59] you understand me I'm trying to tell you
[46:02] or something I'm trying to say listen

[48:37] you need to be praying and talking to
[48:39] God that is the enemy he's trying to
[48:43] hush the call in you remember when the
[48:46] prophet of God talks about this minor
[48:47] this goldminer this minor that this man
[48:51] who hit and struck a gold mine and he
[48:53] had a vein
[48:54] this happy about this gold that he was
[48:57] about to have and he had a pet dog and
[49:01] this dog started barking that night and

[49:08] it is he said listen that's that soul in
[49:10] you see if anybody knows everybody know
[49:15] where you standing death don't have to
[49:17] come to you to let you know where you
[49:19] spend you know the Bible said search
[49:23] yourself examine yourself see whether
[49:26] you be in the faith and every man know
[49:29] right now you know if you fall in short
[49:33] doesn't matter how we appear to be
[49:36] religious to one another we know if
[49:38] we're falling short hey and you and I
[49:44] realized Amen there is a barking don't
[49:47] let this peep listen just like I said

[50:03] the message for his day but Judas fail
[50:07] to get up to the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[50:11] you must come all the way to the Holy
[50:14] Ghost if you just believed the message
[50:18] as we say you are just like the
[50:22] Methodist Baptist the Pentecostals they
[50:26] believe because one day they met there's
[50:28] a time their message was right and God
[50:32] moved right on hallelujah and everybody
[50:37] that's why people are just living any
[50:39] kind of way even in this message they're
[50:42] trying to satisfy their thirst with with
[50:45] wicked things and listen I don't care
[50:49] what kind of pleasure Satan can give you
[50:51] it will never replace the holy ghost
[50:57] happy moments in this life does not
[51:00] guarantee you to heaven everybody won't
[51:03] joy Turner and
[51:06] so the devil I give you fake joy here
[51:09] give you something to drink or something
[51:12] to smoke or something to take that will
[51:16] make you feel good but that is a false
[51:19] that is a lying spirit that is a spirit
[51:22] of deception that is a spirit amen of
[51:26] this life is that right
[51:30] remember the Prophet God went to
[51:32] Concannon de amen and while he was up
[51:34] there in Canada some of the Americans
[51:36] was up there and here was these women
[51:39] Amen half dressed and everything in they
[51:41] staggering me this is life they should
[51:45] have never said that around the Prophet
[51:47] hallelujah he said they were so drunk he
[51:51] went over there he grabbed both arm and
[51:53] he noticed that they had wedding rings
[51:56] on their fingers he said you ought to be
[51:58] ashamed of yourself you got your husband
[52:00] home babysitting it and hell you out
[52:02] here partying and things are like that
[52:04] well we were trying to have some clean
[52:06] fun see that's how the devil tricks you
[52:09] there is no such thing as clean fun not
[52:14] when it comes to that kind of a thing oh
[52:18] he said that ain't no life that's death
[52:23] he loved the Lord listen but here in
[52:29] Ephesians 4 says 17 he said this I say
[52:33] therefore and testify in the Lord that
[52:36] ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles
[52:39] walk in the vanity of their mind huh
[52:43] what is it you know here he tells about

[54:35] this and so many people think when I get
[54:37] married the lust will stop you are so

[55:11] to live I'm trying to get where I'm
[55:12] going cuz I'm taking too much time have
[55:15] any understanding darken some of the
[55:18] Gentiles walk in the vanity like Michael
[55:22] Jackson like a lot of these evangelistic
[55:27] old preachers fulfilling all their lust
[55:30] you know oh it's great to be
[55:33] don't y'all know that oh well you got
[55:36] your doctorate in the wrong with your
[55:39] doctorate as long as God is your dachi
[55:41] God is your number one you are right get
[55:46] as much education as you can but God
[55:48] must be number one he would did we be
[55:53] the head and not the tail he would that
[55:56] we be the Linda and not the Barra is
[55:59] that right it's okay brother sisters
[56:02] whatever these things are given to you
[56:05] for your pleasures in life but if we
[56:07] could all be like a joke no matter how
[56:11] rich God made him God was always number
[56:13] one how is number one as long as we can
[56:19] live right and do right before God God
[56:22] is always number one in our life God to
[56:25] give you whatever you want
[56:26] you said God I'd give you a million your
[56:29] give it to you if you are number he he's
[56:32] number one in your life I believe that
[56:36] but some of us scared to ask for that is
[56:41] that right it's the truth we rather work
[56:44] the lottery Lord I hope I can get him
[56:47] here you about that pray he said if you
[56:57] ask ask whatsoever you will is that the
[56:59] truth you you bother me and my word
[57:03] abide in you you could ask whatsoever
[57:04] you will and then be given to you that's
[57:07] the key a body in the word Oh help us
[57:12] Lord
[57:13] let me hurry hurry hurry hurry have any
[57:16] understanding doc Dokken being elevated
[57:18] from a life of God through the ignorance
[57:22] that is in them because of the blindness
[57:24] of their heart you see you know what we
[57:32] baptize seven times a day and if your
[57:35] heart is not right and it makes no
[57:36] difference you go down a wet Center and
[57:39] you come up you go down the drive center
[57:42] come up where the hive is you however
[57:43] they said my point is it no change is
[57:46] made
[57:46] it's your heart that God wants that's
[57:50] where the devil works it's your heart
[57:51] it's your heart with God can change your
[57:54] heart listen somebody said you know well
[57:57] uh let's put it this way if you knew
[57:59] I'll use your sisters because if you
[58:01] know man he's a millionaire and you want
[58:05] all that man hat you want what he you
[58:07] know you appreciate him but my point is
[58:09] when you marry him then you get
[58:11] everything he's got that's how it is
[58:14] with God when you married God you get
[58:17] everything he's got and whatever God has
[58:21] is yours right now we're looking at
[58:26] these things and we show off what
[58:27] brother Brooks uh well you know how
[58:31] could I do this thing now we have coming
[58:34] I'm gonna jump i'ma jump because I'm
[58:35] running out of time my point is this we
[58:39] are in a place that we cannot allow this
[58:42] world to distract us the Bible says in
[58:45] that day they will be eating drinking
[58:47] being married and giving in marriage
[58:48] they'll be having a lot of fun now
[58:50] understand nothing's wrong with eating
[58:52] and drinking and being married that's
[58:55] what we do and that's Christian
[58:57] sometimes that's all we know to do y'all
[59:03] know say we can't ain't nothing else
[59:05] much much of anything else we can do so
[59:09] my point is and there nothing wrong with
[59:11] that the thing that's wrong with it is
[59:13] when we try to let that eating and
[59:16] drinking me and being Mary feel that
[59:18] spot in our heart when we allow Satan to
[59:24] trick us and make the worldly things
[59:27] more important to us than the heavenly
[59:30] things then we are in trouble I'm trying
[59:35] to hurry I see a lot of y'all tired this
[59:37] morning but you know it's understand
[59:40] this when we get born again when we get
[59:43] quickened you know this word come to us
[59:46] oh we get so happy or praise the Lord
[59:48] hallelujah and you don't realize that's
[59:50] just the beginning
[59:51] the problem with most of us Christians
[59:54] here this morning is our neglection for
[1:00:02] example those of us who have flowers if
[1:00:06] you neglect to water those flowers what
[1:00:08] happened they died whenever you neglect
[1:00:17] to feed a living thing it dies the Holy
[1:00:21] Ghost is life if you neglect to read the
[1:00:25] word which is food and for the Holy
[1:00:27] Spirit it dies your experience die if
[1:00:32] you fail to pray it dies because these
[1:00:38] things you must know that once the Holy
[1:00:40] Ghost that baby in you is quickly that
[1:00:43] life is quickened you gotta feed it
[1:00:46] mamas you know that's the truth one of
[1:00:49] the things they meant that that that
[1:00:50] back in the day we went when they didn't
[1:00:52] have all the machines they look at a
[1:00:54] sister you know why she eating so much
[1:00:57] oh I don't know why I'm eating so much
[1:00:59] but I'm just craving some of these crazy
[1:01:01] things I ha right yeah if something got
[1:01:06] all in years there's a life going on in
[1:01:08] you that's craving something that you
[1:01:10] would normally wouldn't eat I'm still
[1:01:14] yet to see a lady eating a pickle with
[1:01:17] ice cream but she began
[1:01:23] to eat things in and stuff that she
[1:01:26] doesn't normally eat it's a different
[1:01:28] food and that's how it is with the world
[1:01:30] it must be you must see God you gotta
[1:01:35] feed him you must feed him otherwise
[1:01:39] your experience with window Oh y'all
[1:01:42] know what I mean how many of us have had
[1:01:45] glorious times and service amen and in
[1:01:48] everything and and instead of going and
[1:01:50] then final a word Amen that's gonna
[1:01:52] build that thing up we'll go home and
[1:01:54] you know Ohama didn't ever say you know
[1:01:56] you so tired he just just came from a
[1:01:59] revival and you wore out and he'll make
[1:02:02] you wore out for a whole week and you
[1:02:04] haven't prayed or fast at all or
[1:02:06] anything for a whole week and then that
[1:02:07] experience is gone
[1:02:10] see what you must understand is that
[1:02:13] Satan will lead you in a perverted way
[1:02:16] it is his job to mislead you it is his
[1:02:21] job to take your attention off of your
[1:02:24] experience it's his job to take your way
[1:02:27] Amen for that which just happened to you
[1:02:32] he is the provider he is the one that
[1:02:36] makes you think that this life is
[1:02:38] glorious think about it how many of us
[1:02:41] oh my goodness I need a vacation I need
[1:02:44] a vacation you're going to vacation and
[1:02:46] you still ain't happy huh you still no
[1:02:53] matter what you do it ain't going to
[1:02:56] satisfy that thing that's calling out to
[1:02:58] you don't quit people because the one
[1:03:01] experience don't stop get your
[1:03:04] experience every day if you can and we
[1:03:09] make you sense your living to live I'm
[1:03:12] fighting to live I'm gonna live
[1:03:14] hallelujah I didn't come into this life
[1:03:17] and meant to die and to die I came to
[1:03:22] live and you and I must recognize who we
[1:03:25] are where we came from and where we're
[1:03:28] going you are in the worst age ever
[1:03:31] he's always lana was bad Smyrna he
[1:03:34] compared to this age
[1:03:36] the saints in Smyrna could not handle
[1:03:38] this age hallelujah they knew what they
[1:03:43] were fighting but you and I we are
[1:03:45] fighting a lot of things huh first of
[1:03:49] all brother William said like this we
[1:03:51] cannot see our enemy he said but the
[1:03:55] enemy of this church is easy living
[1:04:00] it's the truth we got it so good
[1:04:03] we don't even have to flip switches from
[1:04:06] bow we got in the room now you don't
[1:04:13] even have to turn the water fountain oh
[1:04:15] it just all I said it you don't have to
[1:04:18] flush the commode easy living hallelujah
[1:04:26] it's gotten so bad you don't even have
[1:04:28] to use the key to get in the car that
[1:04:31] ain't nothing but yes it's easy
[1:04:39] hallelujah
[1:04:40] you don't even have to diagnose the
[1:04:42] Cardinal more the car diagnose yourself
[1:04:45] it's so easy and because of that the
[1:04:50] devil know it'll stop your prayer in a
[1:04:54] stop your prayer life you remember
[1:04:55] there's a time we needed to pray we
[1:04:58] wanted something from God we had to play
[1:05:05] it so bad
[1:05:07] nowadays you got everything handy for
[1:05:11] you now I remember the time in America
[1:05:16] everybody walked almost y'all don't know
[1:05:19] that time some of y'all don't know that
[1:05:21] time but everybody you know only right
[1:05:23] brother only a few people had cars maybe
[1:05:25] wasn't a few my house had a car now
[1:05:29] everybody got more than one two or three
[1:05:31] it's so funny it's so funny cuz even
[1:05:34] when I walked to the store from my house
[1:05:36] I feel strange you know cuz people look
[1:05:41] at you that's poor it's oh he's so sad
[1:05:45] it's sad to see that man walking
[1:05:50] and that is nothing but the truth
[1:05:54] we might be trying to get some exercise
[1:05:57] and you pull over says hey you wanna
[1:05:59] ride no I'm fine
[1:06:03] you see it's just the devil's working
[1:06:06] and he makes it so easy a manta you know
[1:06:11] we get sloth and praying we feel like
[1:06:13] you know I don't have too much that I
[1:06:15] need so we don't we don't pray we don't
[1:06:22] pray until God puts on put something
[1:06:25] desperate on us and probably God said is
[1:06:30] a shame that God has to do that to us
[1:06:35] they get us to pray I'm almost done I
[1:06:39] ever have to cut it short but something
[1:06:42] I love David this is my songs this is
[1:06:44] one of my favorite songs Psalms 42 one
[1:06:47] through seven and here David says as the
[1:06:49] heart panted after the water Brooks old
[1:06:51] pan at my soul after thee O God my soul
[1:06:55] thirsts for God for the Living God when
[1:06:59] shall I come and appear before God my
[1:07:03] tears have been my meat day and night
[1:07:05] why are they continually saying to me
[1:07:07] where is thy God when I remember these
[1:07:10] things I poured out my soul in me I had
[1:07:15] gone with the multitude I went with them
[1:07:18] to the house of God with the voice of
[1:07:21] joy and praise and the multitude that
[1:07:23] kept holy days you see what he's saying
[1:07:25] I was a part of the church I went there
[1:07:28] and we sung in the blood of Christ my
[1:07:31] lord right we did all of that hallelujah
[1:07:35] I enter his gates with Thanksgiving in
[1:07:38] my heart I enter his coat with pray he
[1:07:41] said we did all of that ah
[1:07:43] we'd be strong we had a good time a
[1:07:45] multitude of people y'all know what I'm
[1:07:47] talking about
[1:07:48] you got a great crowd it feels good
[1:07:50] hallelujah but at the end of the day you
[1:07:53] still feel that more I need more God at
[1:07:59] the end of it all you don't feel changed
[1:08:04] Oh somebody help me at the end of the
[1:08:09] day you still feel that loneliness you
[1:08:11] feel that emptiness you know God I know
[1:08:16] this is truth I know that it's right but
[1:08:20] you know what the church has become
[1:08:22] we've become a church that is powerless
[1:08:24] and the reason why we're power that's
[1:08:27] because we don't have the powerful and
[1:08:30] there's only one powerful and that's
[1:08:33] Jesus Christ himself and we're not to
[1:08:36] rest and wait on everybody else every
[1:08:39] man is for himself you've got to be safe
[1:08:43] when it comes down
[1:08:44] amen to your death Edmund was come down
[1:08:47] the crossing over the river you're not
[1:08:49] gonna be joining hands with folks and
[1:08:51] said praise God we're on our way out of
[1:08:52] here now you are going to be all alone
[1:08:57] and the thing about it is that all of
[1:08:59] your life will flash before you you go
[1:09:05] to know hmm those times when the Holy
[1:09:09] Ghost tried to get you to pray and you
[1:09:11] said I'll do it later
[1:09:14] praying for the Holy Ghost is not like
[1:09:16] washing dishes you can wash those dishes
[1:09:18] later if that's what you need to do but
[1:09:21] when it when an unction comes on you to
[1:09:23] pray you need to pray oh well I got all
[1:09:28] my friends my momma used to say I'll see
[1:09:30] y'all later and she'd go behind that
[1:09:31] door go in the bathroom of wherever and
[1:09:33] she would pray now my mother was an
[1:09:36] ignorant woman she could not read or
[1:09:38] write but she knew the voice of God and
[1:09:40] didn't make it a different what kind of
[1:09:43] crowd she had in the house when it came
[1:09:45] to her the praise she left that crowd
[1:09:47] and she went behind the door somewhere
[1:09:49] inside to pray my god make me God anoint
[1:09:53] me with that but when you neglect the
[1:09:58] thirst that God has placed in you or you
[1:10:00] place it trying to feel it with someone
[1:10:02] else or something else it ain't gonna
[1:10:04] work and after a while that thirst is
[1:10:10] going to die why I'm almost done
[1:10:14] remember the man
[1:10:17] the dog was barking going back there
[1:10:19] that dog was barking bop
[1:10:22] that old miner says well I don't need
[1:10:24] you no more you've been a good friend
[1:10:28] but I don't need you no more tomorrow
[1:10:29] I'm gonna be a millionaire and he took
[1:10:33] his rifle and boom he shot the dog and
[1:10:36] killed the dog and the whole time the
[1:10:39] dog was trying to tell him there was
[1:10:41] somebody outside somebody that's going
[1:10:45] to kill you somebody that is the danger
[1:10:48] to you is that right that's how the Holy
[1:10:50] Ghost is the Holy Ghost is that laws in
[1:10:53] you telling you you need to be saved you
[1:10:55] need to be changed there's got to be a
[1:10:57] change in you you're not there yet
[1:10:58] though you'll be a Christian if you want
[1:11:00] to make a rapture you got to go further
[1:11:02] you cannot be this way and make a
[1:11:05] rapture
[1:11:09] I'm not saying when I say there many of
[1:11:12] us are saved but if we don't come into
[1:11:15] the full statue of Christ you will not
[1:11:17] make a rapture I'm telling you those are
[1:11:20] the ones that will make a rapture and
[1:11:22] the problem with us is that we're too
[1:11:25] busy and we're hushing God's call like I
[1:11:28] told the brother this morning I said
[1:11:29] thing here we we lean too much on grace
[1:11:32] Oh grace is gonna lead me on grace
[1:11:35] trying to lead you on by telling you you
[1:11:37] ain't their way you are you're not in
[1:11:39] the place you ought to be oh I can get
[1:11:43] mad no praise God I can tell you all
[1:11:45] about what I need to say to you let me
[1:11:47] tell you something
[1:11:48] you better get on your knees you're not
[1:11:50] there yet
[1:11:52] ain't gonna be no fussing and fighting
[1:11:54] in heaven hallelujah you still watching
[1:12:01] ungodly stuff you're not there yet you
[1:12:06] can't turn your head the right way when
[1:12:08] you see a naked person walking down the
[1:12:10] street you're not there yet I'm not
[1:12:15] saying you're not born comes in that you
[1:12:17] need to be a full maturity individual in
[1:12:20] Christ and these verses of Christ must
[1:12:22] be in you because no church this meant
[1:12:26] oh I follow this message that ain't
[1:12:28] gonna do you no good you can believe it
[1:12:30] believe it but you got to be born again
[1:12:33] this nature can go there
[1:12:35] it cannot the Bible said flesh and blood
[1:12:38] would not inherit the kingdom of God it
[1:12:41] can it but there is something that will
[1:12:45] he told what he told Nicodemus you must
[1:12:48] be born again that which is flesh is
[1:12:51] flesh that which experience period
[1:12:54] hallelujah and we've been born of the
[1:12:56] flesh now we need to be born of the
[1:12:58] Spirit of God hallelujah you love the
[1:13:02] Lord Oh imma cut it short you got to
[1:13:09] fight the good fight of faith lay ahold
[1:13:12] of eternal life you said what do you
[1:13:16] mean I'm saying this you got to be like
[1:13:19] Joshua you got to have a spirit like I'm
[1:13:22] gonna conquer everything God said I was
[1:13:23] gonna conquer
[1:13:24] he said Joshua this land is yours I'm
[1:13:27] gonna say Joshua this land is yours this
[1:13:31] Garlin is this divine nature that Peter
[1:13:33] talked about is yours but you gotta
[1:13:35] fight for every inch of it mmm you gotta
[1:13:40] fight for it it's not gonna drop in your
[1:13:43] lap and sometimes I remember when I was
[1:13:46] in the Apostolic Church years and years
[1:13:48] ago and you know what I let them break
[1:13:50] me let me say like this I was telling a
[1:13:54] lot I was confessing to the Lord asking
[1:13:55] for his forgiveness
[1:13:56] I said Lord I walked by myself even then
[1:14:00] I prayed and I fasted I had a prayer
[1:14:06] life of three times a day 6:00 in the
[1:14:10] morning
[1:14:11] 12:00 noon and 6:00 at night and I got
[1:14:17] so much criticism because I didn't run
[1:14:19] to the places and did the things that
[1:14:22] everybody all you think you holier than
[1:14:24] now you you think you hold you do you
[1:14:26] know they criticize me but you know what
[1:14:29] God was trying to bill me even then but
[1:14:31] I wanted friends
[1:14:35] so in all
[1:14:37] to gain friends I had to compromise
[1:14:41] hello
[1:14:42] we've all done it some way or another
[1:14:45] and you compromise Amen for friendship
[1:14:48] and then you lose it's God's friendship
[1:14:51] because the Bible says you cannot be a
[1:14:54] friend of a world and a friend of God's
[1:14:56] - so when we become friends of the world
[1:15:00] we becomes an enemy to God hello you may
[1:15:06] not like this kind but let me tell you
[1:15:07] like these people of God we're trying to
[1:15:09] bring us all to a place where we can
[1:15:11] take a rapture I'm not interested in
[1:15:14] religion I don't care about what other
[1:15:16] people are doing I know that one thing
[1:15:18] for certain as a pastor of this church I
[1:15:20] will have to give an account for every
[1:15:22] soul here hello
[1:15:26] and my thought my thought my thought
[1:15:30] amen if the love of God would have been
[1:15:32] on display like it should have been and
[1:15:34] should be maybe some of the ones we've
[1:15:37] lost won't be would not be going already
[1:15:40] if anybody is being blamed I'm to blame
[1:15:47] you understand me my point is some of
[1:15:50] y'all may not you know you're sitting
[1:15:52] all already on the edge of things you
[1:15:56] don't even see that you're sitting on
[1:15:57] the end but you are spiritually every
[1:16:00] one of us Amen need a refueling more of
[1:16:04] God right because we need we people got
[1:16:08] a plane Andy you know it's going to be a
[1:16:11] few now you've got to determine you got
[1:16:14] to say in your mind who you are and what
[1:16:18] you've come to accomplish Jesus
[1:16:24] self as a man says foxes have holes and
[1:16:27] birds have nests but the Son of man have
[1:16:30] no place to lay his head he was willing
[1:16:34] to sacrifice his entire life let me give
[1:16:38] you a good scenario if God would say I
[1:16:42] can give you a million years of life but
[1:16:46] after that million years of life of good
[1:16:50] life I'm gonna send you to hell and he
[1:16:58] says listen but I give you a hundred
[1:17:00] years of trials and temptations
[1:17:05] hardships whew and after that hundred
[1:17:11] years of hardships I give you eternal
[1:17:13] life
[1:17:15] only a fool only a fool would choose the
[1:17:21] million years of good life and the rest
[1:17:25] of your life in hell give me a hundred
[1:17:29] years however long I got to live on this
[1:17:32] earth let it be as bad as it can be as
[1:17:35] long as my station is eternal with God
[1:17:40] hallelujah because suffering is
[1:17:44] something you and I can't get out of
[1:17:49] it is what it is but I rather suffer for
[1:17:55] righteousness sake then the suffer for
[1:17:59] evil you understand me every soul every
[1:18:05] soul is crying because you know and I
[1:18:07] know nobody religion is gonna satisfy
[1:18:10] you
[1:18:11] it's always something on the inside
[1:18:13] calling out for the Living God you got
[1:18:16] to go beyond all of that to find God
[1:18:20] lest an but don't hush the call don't
[1:18:28] stop the
[1:18:29] from barking because that's your safety
[1:18:32] that's so telling you you not quite
[1:18:34] where you ought to be and if you should
[1:18:37] die what's going to happen to you next
[1:18:38] hmm
[1:18:40] you think about all these people that's
[1:18:41] dying all these great politicians and
[1:18:44] all and I don't know who they were and
[1:18:45] whether they were Christians or not but
[1:18:47] if they didn't know the Lord Jesus
[1:18:48] Christ they are where they are and all I
[1:18:52] can say is that people of God obey you
[1:18:55] and I know by God's grace there's only
[1:18:57] one way to be saved those who are in
[1:19:03] Christ think about it
[1:19:12] as Christ knew what he was getting into
[1:19:14] he suffered for you he died for you he
[1:19:17] bled for you he did all of that he knew
[1:19:19] what he was getting into the pain and
[1:19:21] agony he went through and then for us to
[1:19:24] say it wasn't good enough to walk away
[1:19:26] says Lord your pardon wasn't good enough
[1:19:28] what you did wasn't good enough I did
[1:19:32] all this for you and think about his
[1:19:35] attitude toward you when you reject the
[1:19:40] way of eternal life I'd rather be a fool
[1:19:46] and I've been called a fool for a long
[1:19:48] time my family still think I'm crazy to
[1:19:51] this day and they say oh we believe in
[1:19:54] Jesus but all of that ain't necessary
[1:19:57] it's all necessary Strait is the gate
[1:20:02] narrow is the way that leads to eternal
[1:20:06] life and only a few be that find it that
[1:20:09] means you got to look for it you got to
[1:20:11] hunt for it that's why when that thirst
[1:20:14] is in you they may not have you how many
[1:20:15] other and I'm closing how many of us of
[1:20:17] us have ever been really thirsty when
[1:20:22] you thirsty a Pepsi ain't gonna do you
[1:20:28] gonna get you some water
[1:20:29] after the Pepsi cuz there's only one
[1:20:34] thing that can really satisfy the thirst
[1:20:37] of man and that's God's nature water
[1:20:39] it's God's nature pop and that's called
[1:20:42] water y'all know it's the truth
[1:20:47] sometimes I've done it before I said
[1:20:50] okay give me your honor promenade with
[1:20:52] my drinking and you know what's good
[1:20:55] with the food but then after a while I
[1:20:57] gotta have that water right get that
[1:20:59] water when the water strike is that all
[1:21:02] that's it
[1:21:04] and I really should never have gotten
[1:21:06] that I should've just stayed with the
[1:21:08] water it made my food taste even better
[1:21:11] so what I'm trying to say people all of
[1:21:14] these experiences those sweet things out
[1:21:16] there all of the kinds of religions you
[1:21:19] got out there everybody think they right
[1:21:21] there's only one way and that's the way
[1:21:23] that Jesus Christ left
[1:21:25] and I tell you what I know I know for
[1:21:29] myself I seen so much stuff a man coming
[1:21:32] up as a Christian coming up in a
[1:21:33] Christian home with my mother trying to
[1:21:35] explain to me the ways of Christ I had
[1:21:38] all of that but you know what what she
[1:21:39] had couldn't satisfy me it just made me
[1:21:42] more thirsty and perhaps our lives one
[1:21:46] day will will make others thirsty but
[1:21:49] you got to live it you can't make a
[1:21:53] person thirsty and not living it I know
[1:21:56] some German friends because of the life
[1:21:58] that God allowed me to live before them
[1:22:00] they're now saying they used to be in a
[1:22:03] great denominational churches and
[1:22:05] everything else
[1:22:06] I remember one I had done left that job
[1:22:09] and I saw in the street and she come up
[1:22:12] with her German accent I love that
[1:22:13] accent she said look I'm saying now I'm
[1:22:15] no longer powder and gonna call that
[1:22:17] organization I'm no not a part of that
[1:22:19] and look at me I'm growing my hair and
[1:22:23] the whole time I didn't even realize I
[1:22:24] was affecting them didn't know that my
[1:22:27] life was affecting them in that way but
[1:22:30] had I not lived it before then it wasn't
[1:22:34] me like Paul said it's not I that live
[1:22:36] as Christ in me people of God you don't
[1:22:41] have to talk to me but we're gonna take
[1:22:43] this moment right now all of us we're
[1:22:47] gonna bow our heads and we want to talk
[1:22:49] to the Lord Jesus let's bow Heavenly
