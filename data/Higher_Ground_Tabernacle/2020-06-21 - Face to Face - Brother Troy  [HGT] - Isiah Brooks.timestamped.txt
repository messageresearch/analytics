[36:57] and when aaron and all the children of
[37:00] israel saw moses
[37:01] behold the skin of his face was shown
[37:06] and they're afraid to come nigh unto him
[37:09] and moses called unto them and aaron and
[37:12] all the rulers of the congregation
[37:14] returned back
[37:15] unto him and moses talked with them
[37:18] and afterward all the children of israel
[37:21] came
[37:22] nine he gave them the commandments all
[37:24] that the lord had spoken unto him
[37:26] in mount sinai and until moses was done
[37:29] speaking with him he put the veil
[37:32] on his face but when moses went
[37:36] before the lord to speak with the lord
[37:38] speak with him he took the veil off
[37:40] until he came out and then when he came
[37:43] out he spoke unto the children of israel
[37:45] all that was commanded
[37:47] and when the children of israel saw the
[37:49] face of moses
[37:51] and that the skin of moses's face shown
[37:54] that moses put the veil
[37:56] on until he went in to speak
[37:59] with him to speak with the lord amen

[39:42] into your hands in the name of jesus
[39:44] christ we pray
[39:45] amen amen god bless you you can be
[39:48] seated
[39:51] i know this is a familiar story but as
[39:54] moses went up into the presence of the
[39:56] lord the bible says
[39:57] he was up there 40 days and 40 nights
[40:01] that's a long time it's over a month
[40:04] that god that moses spent
[40:07] with jehovah and when he came down he
[40:10] had the tablets of stone and
[40:13] as he began to talk to the people
[40:16] to talk to aaron and that they were
[40:18] running away from
[40:20] they were scared because something had
[40:23] happened to moses
[40:25] amen after moses had spent time with
[40:28] jehovah
[40:29] his face had been transfigured to begin
[40:32] to shine
[40:34] amen and when he came down off the
[40:36] mountain with the tablets of stone
[40:38] that the people they ran away from the
[40:41] shining of his face
[40:43] amen they turned away because the
[40:45] shining of his face
[40:47] concerned them it scared them they
[40:49] didn't know what to do about it it
[40:50] bothered them amen so they ran away from
[40:53] that so moses
[40:54] put a veil over his face to hide the
[40:57] shining
[40:58] from the people amen and when he when
[41:01] moses began to speak
[41:02] they received the words of moses amen
[41:06] they received his words and they began
[41:07] to say
[41:08] all that you have spoken we will do all
[41:11] that you have said for us to do we will
[41:13] do
[41:13] but don't speak to us you know don't let
[41:16] god speak to us we can't
[41:17] handle when god speaks and don't let us
[41:19] see the shine of your face they didn't
[41:21] want to see the actions of the holy
[41:23] ghost
[41:24] amen they're willing to receive the word
[41:27] but they were not willing to receive the
[41:29] shining of the face
[41:31] one thing that amazes me about this is
[41:36] there's nothing inside moses
[41:39] there's nothing special about moses's
[41:42] skin
[41:43] there is nothing unique about the skin
[41:45] of moses that nobody else had
[41:47] amen there's nothing unique about moses
[41:49] body that was different than anybody
[41:51] else's body
[41:52] amen and there's only one way that
[41:54] moses's face could have began to shine
[41:57] amen says somehow that the god of heaven
[42:01] had come down into moses and began to
[42:04] reveal himself to the people
[42:06] amen so when the people when they they
[42:08] are willing to
[42:10] receive the word amen as is written upon
[42:13] the tablets of stone
[42:14] they are willing to receive the the
[42:16] natural letter on the tablets they're
[42:19] willing to receive the commandment but
[42:20] when they came down to the spirit
[42:22] manifesting themselves amongst
[42:24] people that was just a little too much
[42:26] for
[42:27] amen so when when when when when moses
[42:31] began to
[42:32] avail his space let me tell you that was
[42:34] a judgment sign to the people
[42:36] amen when the people are willing to
[42:38] receive just the law
[42:40] amen you know i think we all know know
[42:43] what it's like to go into a church so
[42:46] they're not interested in the spirit
[42:48] amen there's
[42:49] you know there's people in this day that
[42:51] they don't mind being religious
[42:53] amen they don't mind they don't mind
[42:55] opening their bible every once in a
[42:56] while
[42:57] amen they don't mind reading psalms 23
[43:00] every once in a while
[43:01] amen they don't mind this uh singing
[43:05] a psalm or something like that but when
[43:07] it comes to actually meeting god face to
[43:09] face
[43:10] that's just a little too much for when
[43:12] it comes to hearing about god
[43:14] revealing himself in this day that's too
[43:17] much for him
[43:18] when it comes to god revealing himself
[43:20] through a prophet
[43:21] they say oh no no don't don't don't you
[43:24] listen to something like that
[43:25] god doesn't do that anymore amen god
[43:28] doesn't
[43:28] talk to the people anymore just just
[43:30] come to church you know
[43:32] and don't be changed just come to church
[43:34] and listen to the sermon
[43:36] just come to church and read your bible
[43:38] almost well but don't but don't take it
[43:39] too
[43:40] seriously but don't take it too
[43:43] seriously but let me tell you there's
[43:44] another type of people upon this earth
[43:46] amen they're not content to just be
[43:48] religious they're not content to just be
[43:51] uh take the methodist doctrine of this
[43:54] age
[43:54] they're not content just to take the
[43:55] baptist baptist doctrine of this age
[43:58] and remember they are content only with
[44:00] the manifestation of jesus christ to
[44:03] this world
[44:04] amen wherever jesus christ is revealing
[44:06] in himself in this day
[44:08] that's where we want to be amen wherever
[44:10] christ is alive
[44:12] let me be right there amen i remember
[44:14] the time in the bible there in the old
[44:16] testament talks about joshua
[44:18] as joshua was a young man and everywhere
[44:21] moses went
[44:22] john you could find joshua amen
[44:24] everywhere you saw
[44:25] moses there was joshua following him
[44:28] right behind
[44:29] amen one time when when when when moses
[44:32] had gotten so
[44:33] uh upset at the rejection of the holy
[44:36] ghost
[44:37] so upset at the rejection of god's ways
[44:40] that moses also he just started packing
[44:43] up the tabernacle
[44:44] they began packing up the the ark of the
[44:47] covenant they began packing those up
[44:49] and he took the the the tent and the
[44:51] tabernacle and all that and he went up
[44:53] into the mountain he
[44:54] pitched the tent outside the camp and he
[44:57] said this is where god's gonna dwell
[44:59] outside of the camp over here amen and
[45:02] you know what
[45:03] and everybody was content and they came
[45:05] they woke up in the morning they
[45:07] rubbed the sleep out of their eyes and
[45:08] they and they went and they looked and
[45:10] their
[45:11] the tabernacle is gone
[45:15] god has removed himself from the king
[45:18] and the tabernacle is gone and they look
[45:20] and they see and there's moses way off
[45:22] over in the distance a mile or two away
[45:25] and there's their tabernacle sitting on
[45:27] the mountainside
[45:29] and look they thought well we ought to
[45:30] worship god i suppose and
[45:33] and so they rubbed their sleep out of
[45:34] their eyes and they might have went to
[45:36] the tabernacle gate that day but
[45:37] now the tabernacle is gone so it's like
[45:40] well i'll just
[45:41] worship right here and the bible says
[45:43] that they worship
[45:44] god from their tent door
[45:48] when god removed the tabernacle from the
[45:52] people
[45:53] but it wasn't so with joshua
[45:56] that when joshua saw moses packing up
[45:59] when joshua saw moses taking the
[46:02] the the ark of the covenant out of the
[46:04] camp that joshua says you know wherever
[46:06] that goes
[46:08] i am going that direction amen
[46:11] so as the tabernacle began to leave the
[46:13] camp that joshua began to follow
[46:16] amen and when moses pitched to the
[46:19] tabernacle right there
[46:20] amen and the cloud comes down upon the
[46:22] mountain amen
[46:23] and all the different things that
[46:24] happened there amen that
[46:27] was standing right there worshiping amen
[46:29] he was staying right there at the
[46:30] presence of god
[46:31] and when moses left that and went back
[46:34] to the people to go talk to the people
[46:36] you see joshua's saying i'm going to
[46:37] stay right here i'm going to worship
[46:39] jehovah
[46:40] wherever the presence of the lord is
[46:42] that's where i'm gonna stay
[46:44] amen we got to be a people that it
[46:47] doesn't matter what goes on around us
[46:49] if the church fails if our neighbor
[46:52] fails
[46:52] if the person sitting on the pew next to
[46:54] you won't worship if the person sitting
[46:56] in front of you or behind you won't
[46:58] worship
[46:58] no matter what's going on around you
[47:00] that you have a determination in your
[47:02] heart
[47:03] i in my house are going to worship the
[47:05] almighty god
[47:06] amen we're not going to just stay here
[47:08] at home we're not going to stay here and
[47:09] try to worship from
[47:11] this place over here or we're this place
[47:13] over there but we're going to go
[47:14] where god is made manifest and that's
[47:17] what we are going to worship
[47:19] amen and god has a place where he is
[47:22] revealing himself in this
[47:24] day amen god has never left himself
[47:26] without a witness
[47:28] god always has a place in every day and
[47:30] every age where he is revealing himself
[47:33] amen because he will not leave himself
[47:35] without witness
[47:36] because he prophesied through saint paul
[47:38] that i will be the same
[47:40] yesterday today and forever so if we are
[47:43] living in a day that's called today
[47:45] then we've got to be living in a day
[47:46] where god is being revealed
[47:48] amen you know i am not content unless
[47:52] god is being revealed to me
[47:54] amen you know just like the other day i
[47:56] was like you know i just wanted to see
[47:57] god doing something you know and and
[48:01] and i i went and i was uh playing a tape
[48:03] and i
[48:04] and i and i i heard that prayer line and
[48:07] and i was just like
[48:08] that's music to my ears amen
[48:12] that that is what i am looking for amen
[48:15] if i cannot see the book of acts in
[48:17] action
[48:18] let me tell you i am a poor distressed
[48:20] man amen i'm not content to just sit
[48:23] around and have church
[48:24] i'm not content just to sit around and
[48:26] be religious but i
[48:28] got to see the book of acts in action
[48:30] amen i tell you why if you get me
[48:32] if you get me to start cooling off for a
[48:35] little bit i start getting a little
[48:36] nervous
[48:37] amen if you get me to a place where i'm
[48:39] not seeing god in action around the camp
[48:42] i can't see people's face shining with
[48:44] the
[48:45] with the glory of god i start started to
[48:47] get a little nervous
[48:48] where's god at amen i want to see god in
[48:52] action
[48:53] amen i'm not content just to sit around
[48:55] a bunch of religious people
[48:56] maybe people that don't care whether god
[48:58] shows up or not they don't know whether
[49:00] they're in the
[49:01] tabernacle the most high god or the
[49:03] tabernacle of the lutherans or
[49:04] tabernacle
[49:05] methodists or some other blasphemous
[49:07] name amen
[49:09] if you don't care where you're sitting
[49:10] then i start to get a little nervous
[49:13] i want to be in a place where the people
[49:15] know their god
[49:16] they know where he is yesterday they
[49:19] know where he's going to be tomorrow
[49:20] and they know where he is right now they
[49:23] don't have to wonder
[49:25] a people that don't have to wonder where
[49:27] god is at
[49:30] a people that don't have to wonder where
[49:32] god is at they don't have to wonder
[49:34] whether they're in the will of the
[49:35] almighty god because they've been
[49:37] checking up
[49:38] amen they know who god is they've been
[49:41] in communication with god
[49:43] amen and they they and they know their
[49:45] condition
[49:46] they know the condition of their own
[49:48] heart
[49:49] let me tell you when moses came down off
[49:51] that mountain
[49:52] he knew exactly who he was
[49:56] it wasn't moses fault that the people
[49:58] were running away
[50:00] it wasn't moses's fault that the people
[50:02] ran away from him
[50:03] but they when they came back they said
[50:05] you gotta cover your face because we
[50:07] can't take
[50:09] the shining from your face oh we'll
[50:12] receive the written instruction
[50:14] we'll receive the thou shall not do this
[50:17] thou shall not do that just give us a
[50:18] little something we can do and we'll be
[50:20] content
[50:20] but don't let the supernatural come hide
[50:23] that supernatural we don't want that
[50:25] and that's what and that's how it is
[50:27] upon generation after generation
[50:29] generation after generation just give us
[50:32] a little something that we can do
[50:34] a little uh uh uh oh yeah okay we'll let
[50:37] our hair
[50:38] grow out we'll wear our skirts we won't
[50:40] wear do makeup we'll
[50:42] we'll live cleanly we won't tell dirty
[50:43] jokes we'll just live a good clean life
[50:46] and we'll do that but but then when it
[50:48] comes down to the supernatural almighty
[50:50] god
[50:51] oh that's just a little too much and you
[50:54] hide your face from it
[50:56] and you'll hide your face from it and
[50:58] but the thing of it is is we got to be a
[50:59] people saints
[51:01] that love every single thing that the
[51:03] holy spirit does
[51:04] amen we gotta love his every move we
[51:07] gotta love his every
[51:08] action wherever the holy spirit is
[51:10] whatever he's doing whatever he's acting
[51:12] we've got to be a people that love that
[51:14] like joshua wherever
[51:16] where joe wherever that tabernacle is
[51:18] going josh says i'm going to be
[51:20] right there amen other people can
[51:22] worship from their tent door
[51:24] but i am for but for me i am going to
[51:26] leave the tabernacle behind
[51:28] and i'm going to go worship where the
[51:30] presence of god is
[51:34] amen
[51:37] let's turn over to john chapter 18.
[52:03] now in john chapter 18 verse uh
[52:07] verse 12 it says and then the band and
[52:11] the captains
[52:12] and the officers of the jews they took
[52:15] jesus and they bound him
[52:18] they tied him up hey man they took ropes
[52:21] they tied him up
[52:23] and they led him away to anus first
[52:28] now annis he had
[52:31] been the high priest but he had been
[52:34] deposed and he had five sons and each
[52:36] one of his five sons became high priests
[52:38] one after another
[52:40] and his son-in-law is after him amen and
[52:43] so he was an old man at this point
[52:45] and his son-in-law caiaphasis was now
[52:48] high priest in his stead
[52:50] and so they took him to annis the old
[52:52] man of the jews first
[52:54] the to the leadership to the wisdom of
[52:56] the people amen
[52:58] to see what they would do with what
[53:00] would they do if they didn't bring them
[53:01] to it necessarily because of jesus's
[53:02] teaching
[53:03] but they brought him because jesus's the
[53:06] supernatural
[53:07] actions and the presence of the of the
[53:09] lord god inside jesus was getting them
[53:11] in trouble
[53:13] amen you know if he'd just come and
[53:15] taught us something a little something
[53:16] over here
[53:17] they would receive it if he come in in
[53:19] his own name they were received
[53:20] but because of the power of the almighty
[53:23] god
[53:24] was getting him in trouble amen
[53:29] and then they took him and they led him
[53:31] away verse 13 and they led away to
[53:32] anna's first for his father-in-law to
[53:35] call ephesus
[53:36] which is the high priest that year amen
[53:38] now let's go on down to uh
[53:40] verse 24. and now
[53:43] anas had sent him bound into caiaphasis
[53:46] the high priest
[53:48] and simon peter stood and warned himself
[53:51] simon peter was standing just outside
[53:53] and they said therefore into him art
[53:55] that now also
[53:57] one of his disciples and he denied it
[54:00] and said
[54:01] i am not and one of the servants of the
[54:04] high priest being his kinsmen whose ear
[54:06] peter cut off saith
[54:08] did not i see thee in the garden with
[54:11] him
[54:12] and peter then denied again and
[54:14] immediately the caught crew
[54:17] and then they led they jesus from
[54:19] caiaphasis
[54:21] under the hall of judgment
[54:24] now i want you to notice what's going on
[54:26] here they're taking jesus from place to
[54:29] place to place
[54:30] because everyone god was going to make
[54:33] sure that everybody was without excuse
[54:36] everybody was going to have a chance to
[54:38] judge jesus
[54:40] everybody was going to have their
[54:41] opportunity to judge
[54:43] jesus christ the lamb of god what will
[54:46] you do with this jesus called the christ
[54:49] and they took them to the old man of the
[54:51] jews first to the wisdom
[54:53] to the the the elder of the church
[54:57] amen and they and then he he abused them
[54:59] and
[55:00] and sent them away bound unto the hype
[55:02] the current high priest
[55:04] to see what they do and they rejected
[55:06] them and so
[55:07] he sends them off to to pilate and then
[55:11] jesus's own disciple rejects him and
[55:14] constantly jesus is being rejected over
[55:16] and over and over again
[55:20] amen but you know there's there's
[55:21] something unique in here
[55:24] let's go back to uh
[55:29] let's go back to uh verse 14.
[55:34] they led them to anas first and then
[55:37] verse 14 now kaephasis was he which gave
[55:40] counsel to the jews that was expedient
[55:42] that one should die for the people
[55:44] and simon peter followed jesus
[55:48] and so did another disciple so there's
[55:50] two
[55:51] disciples that were following jesus to
[55:53] the judgment
[55:54] amen by peter is getting ready to deny
[55:57] jesus christ
[55:59] amen and the and that and so
[56:02] and peter followed jesus and so did
[56:05] another disciple and that disciple
[56:07] was known unto the high priest and went
[56:10] in with jesus
[56:11] under the palace of the high priest but
[56:13] jesus or what peter's
[56:15] verse 16 but peter stood without
[56:19] so as now think about this now i want
[56:20] you to get this picture here now this
[56:22] other disciple that was john
[56:24] amen two disciples are following jesus
[56:27] to judgment
[56:28] peter and john and they go into annas
[56:32] they go in onto uh caiaphasis
[56:35] and then they go on to pilate
[56:38] constantly judging being judged being
[56:40] judged
[56:41] christ being rejected christ being
[56:43] rejected christ being rejected
[56:45] even down to peter where peter got
[56:48] nervous and
[56:49] was afraid to he was afraid to claim
[56:52] that supernatural jesus christ
[56:56] he he began to become concerned about
[56:59] his own safety
[57:00] that if he was to align himself that if
[57:03] he was to
[57:04] join himself up too close with jesus
[57:06] christ
[57:07] that he himself might also be judged
[57:10] amen so in a moment in a
[57:12] in a moment of fear when the fear came
[57:15] over him
[57:16] that he began to deny jesus christ but
[57:18] there was another disciple john
[57:20] that went on in and observed all these
[57:22] things so he could write it down
[57:24] for us to read here you know brother
[57:27] brown says that
[57:27] john types the bride of the lord jesus
[57:30] christ
[57:31] amen there was one that did not deny him
[57:38] amen
[57:40] now let's go on to uh uh let's go over
[57:43] to book
[57:43] to the book of acts chapter four
[57:50] now every single one of us is going to
[57:52] have an opportunity
[57:54] to decide what we're going to do with
[57:56] the supernatural christ
[57:58] every single person is brought to that
[58:00] deciding line
[58:02] where they it's a it's a dividing point
[58:06] where they can go off and just be
[58:08] religious
[58:10] or if they can actually go on and
[58:12] receive christ face to face
[58:15] every single person has to make their
[58:17] decision
[58:18] amen i'm gonna go on and just be
[58:20] religious
[58:21] am i going to go on and just be obedient
[58:23] to the bible i'm going to try to be a
[58:25] good person and do what the bible says
[58:27] or am i actually going to how close to
[58:29] jesus christ do you want to get
[58:31] amen now i want you to think about it
[58:35] peter and john they wanted to see what
[58:38] would happen to the lord jesus christ
[58:41] the bible says in the garden that they
[58:43] all scattered away
[58:46] but then peter and john followed off
[58:49] from a distance
[58:50] amen and as jesus went into judgment
[58:54] that peter stopped right there and then
[58:56] he later
[58:56] ended up denying him but he did seek
[58:59] forgiveness later on
[59:01] but john went further on in and was able
[59:04] to
[59:05] risk being known risk being aligned with
[59:09] the lord jesus christ
[59:11] amen and when you're and you remember
[59:13] that when uh when you get to the book of
[59:15] acts
[59:15] actually let's just turn back there acts
[59:17] chapter 2
[59:19] of acts chapter 1.
[59:45] well i'm not going to be able to find it
[59:46] i can tell but um
[59:48] i just want you to put yourself in simon
[59:50] peter's shoes
[59:52] there and i think it's in late john
[59:54] where
[59:55] he knows that he has denied christ
[1:00:01] amen and he begins to hear the reports
[1:00:04] that jesus has raised from the dead he
[1:00:07] begins to hear mary
[1:00:09] about how mary went to the tomb and
[1:00:13] she couldn't find her the tomb was empty
[1:00:17] and
[1:00:17] she sees some angels standing there and
[1:00:20] they begin to
[1:00:21] give her the message he has risen from
[1:00:24] the dead
[1:00:28] that all those supernatural acts that
[1:00:30] you
[1:00:31] saw dreams of the ministry of jesus
[1:00:33] christ
[1:00:34] that those weren't just coincidences
[1:00:37] that there really was a living almighty
[1:00:39] god that was inside that body of the
[1:00:41] lord jesus christ
[1:00:43] that that ministry of jesus christ it
[1:00:45] really was god revealing himself to the
[1:00:48] world
[1:00:49] that jehovah god had dipped down from
[1:00:51] glory
[1:00:52] amen it was revealing himself to the
[1:00:54] world through jesus christ
[1:00:56] now you're standing here think about
[1:00:57] peter when when peter begins to hear the
[1:00:59] testimony mary
[1:01:01] that jesus christ says that death
[1:01:03] couldn't even hold him
[1:01:04] amen that the angel says did not he
[1:01:08] tell you did not he minister unto you
[1:01:12] that as as uh jonah was in the belly of
[1:01:15] the whale three days and three nights
[1:01:17] this so should the son of man be in the
[1:01:19] belly of the earth for three days for
[1:01:21] three nights
[1:01:22] amen did not did not jesus himself tell
[1:01:25] you
[1:01:25] that i will rise again that death cannot
[1:01:29] hold me
[1:01:30] they will crucify me they will put me in
[1:01:32] the ground
[1:01:33] but i will rise on the third day you
[1:01:36] tear this tipple down i will rebuild it
[1:01:38] again in three days
[1:01:40] did not he tell you these things as
[1:01:42] angel says mary begins to give the
[1:01:44] testimony angels unto peter that peter
[1:01:46] begins to realize
[1:01:47] this is the one that i deny this is the
[1:01:50] one
[1:01:51] what will it be like when i see him
[1:01:53] again what will it be like when
[1:01:55] we if i when if this is true that he is
[1:01:58] still alive
[1:01:59] if this is true that jesus christ is
[1:02:01] still alive what will it be like when i
[1:02:03] see him
[1:02:04] and then when all sudden jesus appears
[1:02:07] in the midst
[1:02:09] of them and peter sees his face
[1:02:13] the one that he had denied and is now if
[1:02:16] you ever heard the song from don
[1:02:17] francisco
[1:02:18] hey man i i i love that song i can't
[1:02:21] really name of it
[1:02:22] hey amen but what's that
[1:02:25] he's alive i recommend you listen to
[1:02:28] that song
[1:02:29] amen he's alive by don francisco
[1:02:32] there's nothing like it amen because
[1:02:34] when the presence of god
[1:02:36] came into that room
[1:02:39] that all sudden all fear had to leave
[1:02:41] amen
[1:02:43] all doubts had to disappear the
[1:02:46] resurrected jesus christ was
[1:02:48] on the scene and i don't know what fears
[1:02:51] were dwelling in peter's heart
[1:02:53] the same fear that caused him to deny
[1:02:56] jesus christ
[1:02:57] now with that fear in the presence of
[1:03:00] the resurrected messiah
[1:03:01] let me tell you that fear had to go and
[1:03:04] as
[1:03:05] as peter got down on his knees and
[1:03:08] clung to those crucified feet those feet
[1:03:11] that had the holes
[1:03:12] and in them and as they began to cry
[1:03:14] that
[1:03:15] jesus just looked down and all that was
[1:03:18] shining out from his eyes was love
[1:03:20] no judgment at all and as the
[1:03:24] soul of peter was crying out for
[1:03:26] forgiveness
[1:03:28] all his fear and sins were just melted
[1:03:31] into peace
[1:03:33] all that was wrong was turned right he
[1:03:35] was in the presence
[1:03:36] of the resurrected messiah
[1:03:40] peter was forgiven amen now i tell you
[1:03:44] this experience changed
[1:03:47] john and peter for the rest of their
[1:03:49] days
[1:03:50] amen they had seen the word going to
[1:03:52] judgment amen
[1:03:53] and even though peter temporarily denied
[1:03:56] him
[1:03:57] as soon as he saw jesus christ revealed
[1:04:00] he fell down his feet
[1:04:01] and he became just like john amen
[1:04:04] they became united again that which was
[1:04:06] separating them now
[1:04:08] brought him back into uni he is back
[1:04:10] into fellowship with the lord jesus
[1:04:11] christ
[1:04:12] amen so when you get to acts chapter 4.
[1:04:24] acts chapter 4 verse 5.
[1:04:38] now remember in the previous chapter
[1:04:42] that peter and john had gone into the
[1:04:44] temple
[1:04:45] at the hour of prayer in the temple
[1:04:48] during the ninth hour every day the
[1:04:50] people will gather together and pray
[1:04:52] and so peter and john they go down to
[1:04:55] jerusalem and they're going to pray unto
[1:04:57] the revealed jehovah
[1:05:01] amen the resurrected jesus christ
[1:05:04] jehovah of the old testament has been
[1:05:07] revealed as jesus christ says
[1:05:09] the new amen and they and and peter and
[1:05:12] john
[1:05:13] go into the temple and everybody else is
[1:05:16] going into the temple to pray and
[1:05:18] they're all going to pray unto
[1:05:21] the old jehovah the one that they know
[1:05:24] from the that was revealed by moses
[1:05:27] amen but that same jehovah that was
[1:05:29] revealed by moses has now been revealed
[1:05:31] by the lord jesus christ
[1:05:33] amen and peter and john are the ones
[1:05:36] that know about it
[1:05:37] amen they're the ones that it's been
[1:05:38] revealed to they are the ones that's
[1:05:40] been written on their heart
[1:05:42] they are the written epistles reading
[1:05:44] known of all men amen so when the ninth
[1:05:46] hour comes and they
[1:05:47] go into the temple to pray that there is
[1:05:49] a man laying at the gate there
[1:05:51] and he's lame and he can't walk there's
[1:05:53] something wrong with his feet
[1:05:55] something wrong with his ankles and he
[1:05:57] can't walk and he had
[1:05:58] he'd been laying there how many times
[1:06:01] jesus
[1:06:02] had walked by him and he wasn't healed
[1:06:06] how many times jesus had walked by this
[1:06:08] man and he hadn't been healed
[1:06:09] because jesus was waiting for to heal
[1:06:12] them
[1:06:13] at a later date through john and peter
[1:06:17] how many times jesus had an opportunity
[1:06:19] to heal this man
[1:06:21] that lay at the gate called beautiful
[1:06:24] but he didn't do it
[1:06:26] it's not that jesus didn't think about
[1:06:28] it it's not that he didn't know about it
[1:06:31] but he is waiting until he could do it
[1:06:33] through his disciples
[1:06:35] john and peter amen and so when john and
[1:06:38] peter they enter into the gate and they
[1:06:40] see this man he has never walked before
[1:06:43] a day in his life
[1:06:45] his feet he was lame since the day he
[1:06:47] was born
[1:06:48] his feet never worked even as a child
[1:06:51] amen and all sudden he the man begins to
[1:06:55] beg when he sees peter and john
[1:06:56] and and when peter when he looks at him
[1:06:58] and then they they
[1:07:00] look at their eyes with them and let me
[1:07:02] tell you
[1:07:03] i don't know if anybody else saw it but
[1:07:06] their faces were shiny
[1:07:09] and i don't know if anybody else saw it
[1:07:11] in the natural
[1:07:13] but let me tell you their faces were
[1:07:14] shining nonetheless
[1:07:17] amen say why do you say that brother
[1:07:22] because the resurrected lord jesus
[1:07:24] christ was down on the inside of
[1:07:27] amen and you know and the thing of it is
[1:07:31] it's not that
[1:07:32] it's not that it's not that our faces
[1:07:35] don't shine
[1:07:36] but it's that it's veiled from people
[1:07:40] amen
[1:07:47] and so when peter and john's this peter
[1:07:49] said silver and got
[1:07:51] gold i don't even have but the very
[1:07:53] thing that i have
[1:07:55] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:07:57] stand up and walk
[1:08:00] this was aligning himself with jesus
[1:08:02] christ what happened to him
[1:08:04] they were caught there it was revealed
[1:08:07] to the people
[1:08:09] that they were the disciples of the lord
[1:08:11] jesus christ
[1:08:12] amen and you come to acts chapter 4
[1:08:14] verse 5.
[1:08:16] and it says and it came to pass on the
[1:08:18] moral that their rulers
[1:08:20] and elders and scribes and anus the high
[1:08:24] priests
[1:08:24] and kaephases the very ones that judge
[1:08:28] jesus christ they're all together
[1:08:30] together at jerusalem
[1:08:32] and verse seven is they grant they grab
[1:08:35] john and peter and they say in
[1:08:37] verse 7 it says and when they had set
[1:08:39] them in the midst they asked
[1:08:42] by what power or or by what name have
[1:08:45] you done this
[1:08:48] and then peter said those words then
[1:08:50] peter filled with the holy ghost said to
[1:08:52] him
[1:08:53] and he began to preach that sermon amen
[1:08:57] showing to him that jesus christ has
[1:08:59] done this
[1:09:09] peter and john had now been completely
[1:09:11] aligned with the lord jesus christ
[1:09:14] and being brought to the same judgment
[1:09:15] amen
[1:09:17] now i tell you it's not it's not what
[1:09:20] why
[1:09:21] why can't why do people reject christ
[1:09:24] people are so willing to be religious
[1:09:28] but when you see something supernatural
[1:09:31] happen
[1:09:32] it brings them to a decision point where
[1:09:34] they realize
[1:09:35] i got to give myself completely to this
[1:09:38] or i got to veil my face and go the
[1:09:40] other way
[1:09:41] hey man let me tell you every single
[1:09:43] person is being has to be brought to
[1:09:45] that point
[1:09:46] every single person has to receive the
[1:09:48] holy ghost
[1:09:50] or veil their face and turn away
[1:09:53] amen every single person has the it's
[1:09:55] like when you listen to those tapes on
[1:09:57] brother brandon's when you see those
[1:09:58] prayer lines
[1:09:59] you realize jesus christ has been
[1:10:01] revealed in this day
[1:10:03] it brings you to a decision point
[1:10:06] amen that brings you to a place where
[1:10:09] you have to either accept
[1:10:10] christ for this day and accept that
[1:10:13] message or you have to
[1:10:15] veil your face and go the other way
[1:10:19] amen amen
[1:10:22] you know i think about this uh the whole
[1:10:24] world right now is falling apart
[1:10:27] people are are are bringing out their
[1:10:30] hatred
[1:10:31] they've had a hatred that's they've been
[1:10:33] nurturing inside their heart
[1:10:35] and those seeds of hatred have laid
[1:10:38] dormant for so long
[1:10:40] that now they're they're being given an
[1:10:42] opportunity to be exposed
[1:10:44] and let me tell you every single one of
[1:10:46] us has been
[1:10:47] laying up seeds within our hearts some
[1:10:50] of us are laying up seeds of the gospel
[1:10:53] some of us are laying up seeds of the
[1:10:55] holy spirit
[1:10:56] some of us are laying up seeds of
[1:10:58] adultery some of us are laying up seeds
[1:11:01] of lying
[1:11:02] amen or of unclean
[1:11:05] things of dirty jokes or different
[1:11:08] things
[1:11:09] some of us are laying up seeds of
[1:11:11] reading our bible
[1:11:13] of praying of seeking the face of god
[1:11:16] amen every single one of us has been has
[1:11:19] been
[1:11:19] putting these seeds in their heart but

[1:13:54] we're going to stand upon the word of
[1:13:56] god we know who we are and why we came
[1:13:59] here amen
[1:14:00] but let me tell you be careful be
[1:14:02] cautious what seeds you're laying in
[1:14:04] your heart
[1:14:05] amen be careful what you're putting
[1:14:07] before your eyes
[1:14:08] why because one of these days all the
[1:14:11] things that you have watched
[1:14:13] all the things that you have read are
[1:14:15] all those seeds are going to come to
[1:14:17] fruition amen
[1:14:18] and it'll be made manifest what you've
[1:14:21] been looking for
[1:14:23] peter and john had given themselves over
[1:14:26] to the gospel sake
[1:14:28] they followed the lord jesus christ and
[1:14:31] peter even though he had started to deny
[1:14:34] christ in a moment of weakness
[1:14:36] he made that thing right amen and
[1:14:39] what happened the holy spirit of the
[1:14:41] living god was revealed inside of people
[1:14:45] and the sin the same things that jesus
[1:14:47] did now here peter
[1:14:49] in acts chapter 4 is doing the same
[1:14:51] works amen so will be so with the bride
[1:14:53] of the lord jesus christ
[1:14:55] amen the the those acts
[1:14:58] have to follow the church amen there has
[1:15:01] to be a witness in this last day
[1:15:03] that jesus christ is still alive
[1:15:06] amen amen every single person in here
[1:15:10] ought to have a testimony
[1:15:12] of something that god has done for you
[1:15:15] that you could not do yourself
[1:15:17] amen now if you go through this life
[1:15:19] journey always under your own
[1:15:21] power then when you get to heaven you're
[1:15:24] not or when you get there you're not
[1:15:25] going to have it
[1:15:26] ever have a testimony i mean you're
[1:15:28] never having a testimony
[1:15:30] you've got to have a place amen where
[1:15:32] you come to realize that you cannot do
[1:15:35] it yourself
[1:15:36] amen if you've never come to that place
[1:15:38] and let me tell you you need to get to
[1:15:40] an altar somewhere
[1:15:41] amen and find out who christ is amen
[1:15:44] because the only way you ever receive
[1:15:46] this holy ghost is to humble yourself
[1:15:49] before the almighty god
[1:15:52] amen
[1:16:02] let's turn over to second corinthians 3.
[1:16:27] second corinthians 3 verse 3
[1:16:30] verse 2 it says ye
[1:16:33] are our epistle you are our epistles
[1:16:37] written in our hearts known and read of
[1:16:40] all men
[1:16:41] for as much as you're manifestly
[1:16:43] declared to be the epistle of christ
[1:16:46] ministered by us written not with ink
[1:16:49] but with the spirit of the living god
[1:16:52] not in tables of stone
[1:16:53] but the fleshly tables of the heart
[1:16:56] remember when
[1:16:57] moses came down off the mountain they're
[1:16:59] willing to receive the ten commandments
[1:17:01] they are willing to receive all the
[1:17:04] they two thousand years later they are
[1:17:06] still following what was written on
[1:17:08] those tablets of stone
[1:17:10] but still rejecting the spirit
[1:17:14] that made moses and space shine and let
[1:17:16] me tell you you've got to be more
[1:17:17] willing to receive that
[1:17:19] that that spirit amen you've got to be
[1:17:22] willing to receive the same
[1:17:24] spirit that makes alive as you are to
[1:17:26] receive the ten commandments
[1:17:28] if you're ever going to say well i
[1:17:29] better not tell a lie well i better not
[1:17:31] do this
[1:17:32] let me tell you all i have that same
[1:17:34] determination to get down on your knees
[1:17:36] and find jesus christ
[1:17:37] it's so easy for people to say well i
[1:17:40] want to be religious
[1:17:41] i want to be a christian so i'm going to
[1:17:43] go off i'm going to go find all the
[1:17:45] things that i can do in my own natural
[1:17:46] body
[1:17:47] and just be content with that no why
[1:17:49] don't you go get down on your knees
[1:17:51] and find something that jesus christ
[1:17:54] alone can do for you
[1:17:56] put that thing upon the altar and watch
[1:17:58] god begin to act
[1:18:00] watch god begin to act on your behalf
[1:18:02] amen then you can begin to see the lord
[1:18:05] jesus christ coming down
[1:18:06] out of history jesus christ coming off
[1:18:08] the pages of the bible
[1:18:10] when you begin to see christ doing the
[1:18:12] things
[1:18:13] amen that you the heat that you cannot
[1:18:15] do yourself
[1:18:18] amen amen i've gotten to a place in my
[1:18:21] life where i've seen christ
[1:18:23] do so much that i just i just believe i
[1:18:25] know he can do anything amen
[1:18:30] amen verse 4 says and such
[1:18:33] trust have we through christ to god
[1:18:37] we have this we this trust we have
[1:18:40] through christ towards god
[1:18:41] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[1:18:45] to think anything of ourselves but our
[1:18:48] sufficiency
[1:18:49] is of god who has made us able ministers
[1:18:52] of the new testament
[1:18:54] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[1:18:57] the letter killeth
[1:18:58] but the spirit giveth life let me tell
[1:19:01] you your trust has to be in the lord
[1:19:03] jesus christ
[1:19:04] amen every moment of every day we're all
[1:19:06] going to be called like peter was called
[1:19:08] to a judgment time
[1:19:10] where to where jesus is going to be
[1:19:12] judged by this world
[1:19:13] amen we're all going to have to account
[1:19:15] will we align ourselves with the holy
[1:19:17] spirit of this day
[1:19:19] oh we deny it and go off amen
[1:19:24] but let me tell you you got to love
[1:19:26] everything that the holy spirit loves
[1:19:29] if you ever find something in your heart
[1:19:32] that does not like what the holy spirit
[1:19:34] is doing
[1:19:35] check yourself run to the altar you're
[1:19:38] slipping away
[1:19:39] something has divided you from christ
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:44] amen god has a message for this
[1:19:47] world amen but the world can never
[1:19:51] see it unless your face is the one
[1:19:53] that's shy
[1:19:54] oh you can pass out tracks you can tell
[1:19:57] them about a prophet
[1:19:58] you can uh give them a little tape to
[1:20:01] listen to or something like that
[1:20:02] but let me tell you unless you yourself
[1:20:05] or the able minister
[1:20:07] how can they ever hear amen amen
[1:20:18] we're epistles known and right of all
[1:20:20] men why does god write epistles into you
[1:20:23] because he has a message amen it's a
[1:20:26] communication
[1:20:27] going from someone to someone why
[1:20:29] because he has something that he wants
[1:20:31] to do in this last day
[1:20:33] amen god has to every single one of us
[1:20:37] has an opportunity
[1:20:39] to have our face shiny just like
[1:20:42] moses and station that pillar of fire
[1:20:46] hasn't gone anywhere that pillar fire is
[1:20:48] still here
[1:20:50] amen that you say oh that was just for
[1:20:51] brother brown no
[1:20:53] it's for the message that that was for
[1:20:56] the message
[1:20:58] it was for the messenger well where is
[1:21:00] the message yet
[1:21:01] it's got to be living in you do you want
[1:21:04] to take this message just a religion
[1:21:06] do you want to just take it as a another
[1:21:09] way to pray
[1:21:10] as another way to believe another
[1:21:12] doctrine to listen to
[1:21:13] or can we somehow maybe uh get that
[1:21:17] same pillar of fire to manifest himself
[1:21:20] remember he would say he's i'm watching
[1:21:22] that light it's going through the roof
[1:21:24] i'm waiting for it to rest upon someone
[1:21:26] amen and as soon as you see it resting
[1:21:28] on someone that person
[1:21:29] you know god is interested in healing
[1:21:31] this person god is interested you know
[1:21:33] that
[1:21:34] things that you know that didn't just
[1:21:35] happen because when brother brown was
[1:21:37] watching
[1:21:41] you know that did the that that that
[1:21:43] that that uh
[1:21:44] light that he saw that would travel
[1:21:46] through the audience
[1:21:47] you know that light didn't just travel
[1:21:50] through audiences
[1:21:51] between the years of 1906 and 1955
[1:21:54] 1965. you know that's not the only time
[1:21:58] in history that that light travels and
[1:22:00] settles upon people
[1:22:02] amen i remember when stephen was being
[1:22:05] stoned they said
[1:22:06] oh they looked and as they're stoning
[1:22:08] they begin to cry out and he says i
[1:22:10] see the heavens open and i see jesus
[1:22:12] christ
[1:22:13] sitting upon the right hand of the glory
[1:22:16] of god
[1:22:16] and they said and his face shined like
[1:22:19] an angel
[1:22:21] well who who who was who was that man
[1:22:24] what was he a disciple was he an apostle
[1:22:28] he was just a deacon just a deacon in
[1:22:31] the church
[1:22:32] just a lay member in the church but yet
[1:22:34] as he began to
[1:22:36] as he began to be called out will you
[1:22:38] align yourself with the lord jesus
[1:22:40] christ or not
[1:22:41] he says i will be dedicated to the lord
[1:22:44] jesus christ
[1:22:45] i am aligned with him amen me and christ
[1:22:48] are one and i am to testify and as he
[1:22:51] began to preach about jesus christ
[1:22:53] they stoned him for his testimony and
[1:22:55] his face began to shine
[1:22:57] that light is still traveling as it
[1:22:59] traveled from moses as it traveled to
[1:23:01] the
[1:23:01] 140 or 244 in the upper room
[1:23:05] amen traveled to stephen amen and
[1:23:07] traveled to brother bram it's still
[1:23:08] traveling to this day
[1:23:10] amen it's upon you it's upon me amen the
[1:23:13] holy spirit is still revealing himself
[1:23:15] boys this is the day of lifting amen so
[1:23:18] i can't

[1:23:21] can't find the holy ghost

[1:23:25] i can't find the holy ghost in action
[1:23:27] i look at the i look at cnn and i can't
[1:23:30] find the holy ghost in action

[1:23:35] i listen to this radio personality i
[1:23:37] can't see the holy ghost
[1:23:38] i see hatred i see division on every
[1:23:41] hand
[1:23:42] i see one against another everywhere i
[1:23:44] look i see hatred and division
[1:23:46] but let me tell you we are not from that
[1:23:48] kingdom
[1:23:49] amen we are not part of that kingdom we
[1:23:51] are not part of that nation
[1:23:53] we are from another kingdom and we don't
[1:23:55] have to be afraid of their fears
[1:23:57] we don't have to be afraid of their
[1:23:58] virus we don't have to be afraid of
[1:24:00] their racism we don't have to believe
[1:24:02] the things that they believe
[1:24:04] we don't have to be to be separate from
[1:24:06] this person
[1:24:07] this color against that color this
[1:24:09] doctrine against that doctrine
[1:24:11] amen those who wear a mask and those
[1:24:14] that don't wear a mask
[1:24:15] we don't have to be afraid of their
[1:24:16] fears and we don't have to have the
[1:24:18] hatred that they have
[1:24:20] for we are from another kingdom amen in
[1:24:22] the kingdom of the lord jesus christ
[1:24:25] amen when you are face to face with the
[1:24:27] lord jesus christ
[1:24:28] you are written epistles read and known
[1:24:31] of all men
[1:24:32] and your face is shining but it's veiled
[1:24:35] to the world amen
[1:24:37] amen amen
[1:24:41] let's just stand
[1:24:45] that virus they say it started in china
[1:24:48] and spread throughout all the world
[1:24:51] because it had
[1:24:52] receptors in every person
[1:24:55] something that would receive it that
[1:24:58] virus could only travel from one person
[1:25:01] to another person
[1:25:02] because the other person had something
[1:25:04] in his body that could receive it
[1:25:07] i wish the holy ghost could travel like
[1:25:09] that
[1:25:11] but yet the whole world is blocked off
[1:25:14] and
[1:25:14] and they've hardened themselves they've
[1:25:17] become inoculated from the holy ghost
[1:25:20] they've all received their vaccine
[1:25:23] against the holy ghost
[1:25:25] they've they've all heard about the holy
[1:25:27] spirit and oh i don't want that i better
[1:25:29] get the vaccine
[1:25:30] so they let the doubts it lets the fears
[1:25:33] come into their lives
[1:25:34] and they get vaccinated against the holy
[1:25:36] spirit
[1:25:37] and now the whole world they say that
[1:25:40] they're going to come out with a vaccine
[1:25:41] for this virus
[1:25:43] and they say that they talk about the
[1:25:46] hurt humidity
[1:25:48] immunity they call it and they say that
[1:25:50] once so many people have the vaccine
[1:25:52] and once so many people have the
[1:25:53] immunity that this virus might not be
[1:25:55] able to spread anymore
[1:25:58] and that's what's happened to the holy
[1:25:59] ghost the world the churches the people
[1:26:02] have been
[1:26:02] vaccinated they've become immune to the
[1:26:05] acts of the holy spirit
[1:26:07] amen but it doesn't have to be that way
[1:26:10] peter when he was there at the judgment
[1:26:12] hall he began to get immune from the
[1:26:15] holy spirit
[1:26:16] he began to harden himself from the holy
[1:26:19] spirit
[1:26:19] as the holy spirit went to the judgment
[1:26:22] seat
[1:26:23] that he found himself on the outside
[1:26:26] denying the lord jesus christ what did
[1:26:28] he do the moment
[1:26:30] he found himself at jesus's feet he
[1:26:32] began to repent
[1:26:33] the moment he found himself at the feet
[1:26:36] of the resurrected messiah
[1:26:37] he began to cry lord forgive me lord
[1:26:41] heal me lord deliver me and he was
[1:26:44] healed he was forgiven
[1:26:45] and he was brought up i remember there
[1:26:47] was a there was a prayer line where
[1:26:50] brother abraham had this lady come up
[1:26:52] from the prayer line
[1:26:53] amen and and she said i
[1:26:56] i'm backslidden i want to get right with
[1:27:00] the lord
[1:27:02] i want to come back to the lord and i
[1:27:05] don't remember if she
[1:27:06] said it or if he discerned it it may
[1:27:09] remember
[1:27:09] maybe that he discerned it now that i
[1:27:11] think about that he had said
[1:27:13] this is what your problem is you are
[1:27:16] backslidden and you want to get right
[1:27:17] with the lord
[1:27:19] you know what he said right after that
[1:27:20] he says you're back
[1:27:22] now
[1:27:26] just like that i'll never forget those
[1:27:29] words
[1:27:30] you want to get right with the lord
[1:27:32] you're backslidden
[1:27:34] okay you're back now
[1:27:39] that's what peter experienced
[1:27:43] that was not just a unique item for that
[1:27:45] one lady in that prayer
[1:27:47] that was not just a unique experience
[1:27:49] for peter there
[1:27:50] when jesus christ has been revealed but
[1:27:53] all of us have an
[1:27:54] opportunity to to become unvaccinated
[1:27:57] to remove our immunity to the holy ghost
[1:28:01] to let all of your doubts and fears go
[1:28:04] away
[1:28:04] all the seeds that you've been laying up
[1:28:06] of a
[1:28:07] hatred of malice of adulterous thoughts
[1:28:10] of
[1:28:11] lust and greed and all those things
[1:28:15] all those things that those lies and
[1:28:17] things that you've allowed
[1:28:19] to crop up in your mind where you say
[1:28:21] things that aren't true
[1:28:22] when you when you uh lie to your parents
[1:28:25] or
[1:28:26] or lie to your co-workers and all those
[1:28:27] things all those things that are
[1:28:29] stacked up they're seeds they're waiting
[1:28:32] for the day that the rain will come
[1:28:34] to grow up and let me tell you you don't
[1:28:35] you can
[1:28:37] burn those seeds out of you and let the
[1:28:41] fire of the holy ghost make you immune
[1:28:43] to those sins
[1:28:45] and bring in the seeds of love joy
[1:28:48] faithfulness peacefulness kindness
[1:28:52] brotherly kindness against such there is
[1:28:55] no law
[1:28:56] amen amen let that be your testimony
[1:29:00] going forth
[1:29:01] because one of these days the rain is
[1:29:02] going to come
[1:29:04] and that whatever you have been storing
[1:29:06] in your heart
[1:29:07] that's what's going to grow amen amen
[1:29:10] and then you'll be
[1:29:11] called to the judgment seat and what
[1:29:13] will you present me to him
[1:29:14] you either present a body that is full
[1:29:16] of malice that has grown to fruition
[1:29:19] amen it's hard it's going to be harvest
[1:29:21] time and everything has grown to
[1:29:23] maturity
[1:29:24] and everything that you're hiding in
[1:29:26] your heart will grow to maturity
[1:29:28] and then the rapture will come and woe
[1:29:32] unto you
[1:29:33] your maturity is lies and mounts amen
[1:29:37] but grace and peace unto you
[1:29:40] if it's the acts of the holy ghost amen
[1:29:43] let's just by our heavenly word and
[1:29:44] prayer
[1:29:45] heavenly father our desire lord is to be
[1:29:47] face to face with you
[1:29:49] lord our desire is to be in communion
[1:29:52] with you
[1:29:53] lord there is no greater joy in our life
[1:29:56] lord
[1:29:57] other than when we sit at your feet lord
[1:30:00] we know that that's how it is
[1:30:02] we've seen it in action but somehow we
[1:30:04] just become so
[1:30:06] immune to you we've become so deadened
[1:30:09] to the things of the world to
[1:30:10] to to god and sometimes we just become
[1:30:13] so cold lord
[1:30:15] hey ought not to be that the bride of
[1:30:17] christ would get in that condition lord
[1:30:19] but lord i pray that if there be anybody
[1:30:21] here that has allowed their heart to
[1:30:22] become
[1:30:23] hardened towards the gospel hardened
[1:30:25] towards the moving of the holy spirit
[1:30:28] let's not be like those that stood at
[1:30:30] their tent door and tried to worship god
[1:30:32] from afar
[1:30:33] but lord let us be like joshua that ran
[1:30:35] to the tabernacle
[1:30:37] they ran to the place where god was
[1:30:38] revealed they ran to the place of
[1:30:41] revelation
[1:30:42] and they said hear my god forgive me
[1:30:44] hear my lord
[1:30:46] deliver me lord and they are the ones
[1:30:48] that will be delivered
[1:30:49] they are the ones who will have the
[1:30:50] peace of god lord i pray for every
[1:30:53] single one of us lord
[1:30:54] forgive us of our sins lord forgive us
[1:30:57] of our trespasses lord
[1:30:58] and let us be unto uh unto you a
