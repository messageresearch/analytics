[42:19] we thank god to
[42:21] also you know
[42:22] about a year ago around this time my
[42:24] mother-in-law not only passed but was
[42:26] buried on yesterday i believe it was
[42:29] and then the lord just so ordained
[42:30] everything that my wife and i were away

[42:34] you know thank god for giving her the
[42:35] great time that she did have we had such
[42:37] a beautiful flight holly no turbulence
[42:40] or anything like that and
[42:42] god was gracious to us you know that's
[42:45] those things that you think he doesn't
[42:46] care about he cares
[42:48] and so i thank god for
[42:51] my wife taking that trip with me it made
[42:53] me a better man
[42:56] amen so we appreciate everybody who uh
[42:59] who's here
[43:00] uh this evening and we're going to ask
[43:02] that you turn with us to second timothy
[43:05] the fourth chapter we're going to read
[43:07] the eighth verse
[43:10] here's four there is laid up for me a
[43:13] crown
[43:15] of righteousness
[43:17] which the lord the righteous judge
[43:20] shall give me at that day
[43:23] not me only
[43:25] but unto all them also
[43:27] that love is appearing
[43:30] amen let us pray
[43:32] father god we thank you for your amazing
[43:35] grace
[43:37] we thank you for being so good to us we
[43:40] thank you lord for just allowing us to
[43:42] see
[43:44] this end time word and to understand by
[43:47] your grace
[43:48] and father we say that you
[43:51] give us the grace to
[43:52] speak only the things that you would
[43:54] have us to speak
[43:56] we don't have no other agenda other than
[43:58] to bring
[43:59] your word to the people
[44:01] we're not here to be
[44:03] great
[44:04] we're not here to be seen
[44:06] we're trusting that you will speak
[44:08] through this badge of skin
[44:10] and give us ears to hear and to receive
[44:13] amen we ask these things in your lovely
[44:15] name jesus christ have thine own way
[44:18] amen
[44:20] you may be seated
[44:22] i like to entitle this message preparing
[44:25] to meet him
[44:28] we're living in the last days and many
[44:30] of us know that amen
[44:35] one of the things that have really
[44:37] struck my heart and mind
[44:39] is that god always interpret his own
[44:42] word amen that's true and often times we
[44:45] as men
[44:46] those who consider themselves
[44:49] great in the word of god theologians
[44:51] whatever you might want to call them
[44:53] everybody has a tendency to
[44:56] interpret the word the way they see it
[45:00] but we know the bible said that god's
[45:02] word is not given unto into
[45:05] no private interpretation
[45:08] in other words you know one institution
[45:11] uh doesn't have the right to interpret
[45:13] the word and then the other institutions
[45:16] have no right no institution have a
[45:19] right to interpret the word actually god
[45:21] interprets his own word
[45:24] and for example you know nobody
[45:26] understood
[45:27] uh
[45:28] the preaching of noah and how noah said
[45:31] it was going to rain well the rain in
[45:33] itself was a a foreign word because in
[45:37] that day it had never rained before
[45:39] but at god's appointed time when god had
[45:42] set his clock for it to rain it rained
[45:46] in other words god proved the words that
[45:49] mo uh noah preached was correct and true
[45:53] and one thing about god is when the word
[45:54] of god is preached or when it's brought
[45:56] forth by way of a prophecy or just by
[45:59] the literal word god proves his word
[46:03] by manifesting it
[46:05] amen so we know by god's grace that if
[46:08] we are we are living in the last days
[46:11] like let's go on to say how god
[46:14] interpreted his word when it came to a
[46:16] virgin shall conceive
[46:18] well that was beyond the intellect that
[46:21] was beyond anything that a man a woman
[46:24] could imagine
[46:25] uh we understand by god's grace that
[46:28] they could have tried to figure it out
[46:31] but it would have been of no avail
[46:33] because they had never seen
[46:35] such an event as a virgin conceiving but
[46:38] mind you when even she did conceive the
[46:41] whole world didn't know nothing about it
[46:43] amen jesus not only was born and raised
[46:47] standing in the temple at 12 years old
[46:49] and they still did not know that he was
[46:52] the manifestation of isaiah prophecy
[46:55] that a virgin shall conceive
[46:58] nevertheless it happened
[47:00] and in in all of that we understand that
[47:03] because the people's eyes were blind and
[47:06] isaiah said it would be
[47:07] that they would have eyes to see and
[47:10] have no understanding and ears to hear
[47:13] and not be able to perceive
[47:15] and mind you
[47:16] uh at the coming of this of the lord
[47:19] this time the scriptures also spoke of a
[47:22] blindness
[47:23] uh leocell would not only be blind but
[47:26] she would be rich and increase with good
[47:28] and she would say within herself she
[47:29] have need of nothing
[47:32] so god whenever he's uh doing his word
[47:35] or whatever whenever he gets ready to do
[47:37] something he does it and then he causes
[47:40] the people to look back to see what he's
[47:43] already done
[47:45] only those people that are ordained for
[47:46] that day
[47:48] catches the revelation of what he's
[47:50] doing
[47:50] like for example when hannah and all and
[47:54] uh was in the temple uh praying anna the
[47:57] prophetess and here come mary on the
[48:00] eighth day to get jesus christ
[48:02] circumcised uh by way of prophecy and by
[48:05] way of her having eyes to see
[48:07] and to understanding she was ordained to
[48:10] see the messiah at his early coming now
[48:13] thank you think about it here he was
[48:16] in the form of a baby a toddler a baby
[48:19] excuse me eight days old coming to the
[48:21] temple to be circumcised and god reveals
[48:24] to her that this is the messiah i
[48:27] believe it was simeon as well that god
[48:29] revealed this is the messiah and so you
[48:32] and i understand that god
[48:34] uh always bear a witness there's always
[48:37] somebody he says he's never left himself
[48:39] without a witness
[48:41] now think about it even in the days of
[48:44] uh
[48:45] moses when god prophesied that he would
[48:47] bring his son
[48:49] out of egypt
[48:51] and and here was moses and egypt being
[48:53] raised by pharaoh's uh daughter and and
[48:56] all of these kind of things and here was
[48:58] the deliverer right in there on their
[49:00] territory and and god hid him uh for all
[49:04] of those years
[49:06] and they never did see
[49:08] until god was ready to manifest
[49:11] his word by way of moses see that's the
[49:13] way god always does it
[49:15] don't you know that even in the time
[49:17] that jesus christ was on earth
[49:20] many people didn't know
[49:22] i mean you could say like 99
[49:24] of the world didn't even know the
[49:26] messiah was on the earth
[49:28] and that one percent
[49:30] that would have been in israel didn't
[49:32] know that he was there either
[49:33] right only a small portion of people
[49:36] knew jesus was on the earth and then out
[49:39] of that small portion of people you had
[49:42] believers and you had make believers and
[49:43] you didn't had those who just wouldn't
[49:45] believe it all that's right
[49:47] you know you think about that you we
[49:49] look at christianity and we think oh the
[49:51] whole world but you got to understand it
[49:53] was not so
[49:55] they didn't come to know that jesus
[49:56] christ was the messiah
[49:58] as the world would know him until after
[50:00] he was dead buried and and resurrected
[50:03] you see what i'm saying and and even so
[50:06] now we still have the same scenario
[50:09] but we realize by god's grace we are at
[50:11] a time when we are here to meet god amen
[50:15] amen
[50:16] and it's literally it's disturbing me
[50:19] because
[50:21] i realize that there are so many people
[50:23] who are not taking it seriously
[50:26] and we are living in the last day amen
[50:31] amen
[50:32] excuse me and because your church buddy
[50:35] doesn't see it
[50:37] doesn't mean that it's not happening
[50:42] i remember i talked with you the last
[50:44] time i think one of the last times and i
[50:46] showed you that after the resurrection
[50:49] jesus did not appear to everybody
[50:52] that right you think about it now after
[50:55] the resurrection he did not appear the
[50:57] the sadducees the herodians the
[50:59] pharisees the denomination didn't even
[51:01] know he was risen
[51:02] matter of fact there was a decree that
[51:04] uh a word that went out to say that his
[51:07] disciples stole his body
[51:10] so among the jewish people they didn't
[51:13] believe even after he died that he was
[51:16] the messiah
[51:18] but after he rose from the dead
[51:21] he appeared to mary
[51:23] is that right he appeared to peter
[51:26] he repaired he appeared to those on the
[51:28] road to emmaus
[51:30] and then he appeared to the whole 12
[51:33] right
[51:34] i say 12 but you know judas was no
[51:36] longer there
[51:37] but but by the grace of god all of the
[51:39] women whoever else was there they were
[51:41] there they were in the upper room and
[51:43] they saw jesus
[51:45] now mind you think about the people who
[51:47] didn't believe that he he literally
[51:49] there's historians said he didn't die
[51:53] that it was a fake death
[51:56] and you know and then you have those who
[51:58] believe you know that uh they were these
[52:01] christians were accountable especially
[52:02] when jesus said eat my body and drink my
[52:04] blood
[52:06] and you know you know you had all of
[52:07] these different ideas and thoughts going
[52:10] on all of these thoughts and ideas were
[52:12] thoughts of unbelief
[52:14] so i want to say this tonight
[52:17] your unbelief
[52:19] can never stop god that's right amen
[52:22] doesn't matter
[52:23] who we are
[52:25] or what we can claim to be or what we
[52:27] think who we think we are
[52:30] the the word of god only works for those
[52:33] who truly believe amen
[52:36] amen hallelujah
[52:38] now we know that the lord is soon to
[52:40] come
[52:41] we know the world can't go but so far
[52:43] even if the political realm was not
[52:46] carrying on the way that they are
[52:49] you understand what i'm saying i'm
[52:50] trying to say it's chaos
[52:52] but if you look at the world
[52:55] and the prophecies and the things that
[52:57] god said was going to happen earthquakes
[52:59] and diverse places floods and pestilence
[53:02] and you know i i saw something on on on
[53:05] on the channel the youtube channel i
[53:07] always look at educational things and
[53:09] sometimes i think some of these things
[53:11] are more higher than my mind can
[53:12] conceive
[53:13] but nevertheless they were saying how
[53:16] that even they're finding out that they
[53:19] you know as these polar caps
[53:21] as it melt
[53:23] they're finding bacteria
[53:27] that cannot die
[53:29] it goes into some kind of stasis where
[53:32] it appears to be dead frozen
[53:34] but as soon as it unthaws it comes back
[53:37] to life
[53:39] and and they're multiplying
[53:42] bacteria we know nothing about
[53:45] viruses
[53:47] we know nothing about y'all understand
[53:49] what i'm saying
[53:50] so you got to understand that
[53:52] evidently
[53:54] the time of these disasters
[53:57] where flesh your flesh will be eaten
[53:59] even while you're alive and things of
[54:02] this nature
[54:03] it's coming
[54:04] it's moving
[54:06] into position
[54:07] and the prophet god said only those who
[54:10] have the holy ghost will be able to
[54:12] escape these plagues
[54:15] so you better understand is it important
[54:18] it is very very very i can't express it
[54:21] stress it enough for us to make sure we
[54:25] have the sealing of the holy ghost i
[54:27] mean in our soul
[54:29] not just on our flesh and in our spirit
[54:31] that's going to make us feel good but we
[54:34] need the holy ghost in our souls
[54:37] it doesn't mean the devil won't fight
[54:40] but the bible tells us that many are the
[54:43] afflictions of the righteous and god
[54:46] delivered them out of them all
[54:49] see we look at this little virus that we
[54:51] call and i don't want to take it like
[54:52] it's light because it's a lot of people
[54:54] have died from it and have died from
[54:56] other things with it but nevertheless
[54:59] it is a virus
[55:01] and and it does attack people
[55:03] and christians are not exempt
[55:07] right
[55:07] but we we must put on the whole arm of
[55:10] god
[55:11] our battle is of the lord
[55:13] and you and i must understand that when
[55:15] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[55:17] bible said god lifts up a standard
[55:20] and i believe we're that standard
[55:23] that god is lifting up
[55:25] but we must understand also if we're
[55:27] preparing to meet him that means to make
[55:30] something ready
[55:32] for the use
[55:34] right to prepare it you know preparing
[55:38] doesn't mean oh i hear the voice of god
[55:40] the rapture takes place and all of a
[55:42] sudden god goes switch the flip uh flip
[55:44] the switch
[55:45] right
[55:46] if you die unholy if you die unrighteous
[55:50] if you die filthy you get up that way
[55:53] amen y'all understand me
[55:56] however the tree falls that's the way it
[55:58] lay
[56:00] and this is the thing we find out that
[56:02] listen people they call you a cult and
[56:05] when they do call you that you know
[56:07] you're not the only one you're not the
[56:09] first
[56:10] because i'm gonna tell you something can
[56:11] you imagine jesus christ walking with 12
[56:15] men and a few women
[56:18] and many of them have left their jobs
[56:21] how what do you think they called him
[56:24] same thing
[56:26] it doesn't change and the people's
[56:28] opinion about us doesn't change
[56:31] but one thing for certain what do you
[56:32] think they call noah in his group
[56:36] eight souls amen and all these people
[56:38] are talking about amen it's going to
[56:40] rain it's going to rain it's going to
[56:41] rain and our scientists have not even
[56:44] discovered there be such a thing as rain
[56:47] you see what i'm saying so you got to
[56:48] understand you're living in a day of
[56:50] unbelief you're living in a day that
[56:53] people are going to call especially when
[56:54] you're a true christian they're going to
[56:56] think you are cultish because you don't
[56:59] do this and you don't do that you don't
[57:01] go places where you know christ will not
[57:03] go you don't act and you don't do things
[57:05] that you know jesus wouldn't do
[57:07] you understand me people can't
[57:09] understand your lifestyle because they
[57:12] feel i've had a friend of mine for years
[57:16] have you been delivered from that
[57:17] bondage
[57:19] and i mean she's got all this crazy
[57:21] makeup and whatever and i'm looking at
[57:23] her like are you serious
[57:26] who's in bondage
[57:28] at least i know who i am
[57:30] and i know what i am
[57:32] hallelujah i don't have to fix it up i
[57:34] know exactly who i am
[57:36] and so you look and you know i had a
[57:38] brother tell me that long time ago he
[57:40] was in a different sect of some kind and
[57:43] and i i i'm thinking oh you saying i was
[57:46] in bondage
[57:47] well
[57:49] when you see people not understanding
[57:51] the move of the holy ghost they think
[57:54] it's a cult
[57:57] right
[57:58] because they think that when you go to
[57:59] church it's supposed to be quiet the
[58:01] song's supposed to be you know
[58:03] whatever
[58:05] you know
[58:06] quite dead and whatever whatever
[58:09] but if it's different from their church
[58:11] it's a cult
[58:13] amen
[58:15] can you imagine the pressure that jesus
[58:18] and his disciples went through in their
[58:20] day
[58:21] but you see
[58:23] what good
[58:24] will it do you to gain this whole world
[58:27] and lose your soul
[58:29] y'all understand me you can have a
[58:31] mansion you can have a yacht
[58:34] you can have all of these great things
[58:36] of the world but when god calls your
[58:39] number
[58:40] you're leaving all that
[58:42] amen hallelujah i'm gonna tell you
[58:44] something you might be rich in this
[58:46] world but without jesus when you die you
[58:50] die poor
[58:52] hallelujah you don't even have clothes
[58:54] to put on
[58:58] your clothes don't go with you
[59:02] and that's why people spend all that
[59:04] money in those funerals and dress these
[59:05] people all up so as though they looking
[59:07] down at them and they said well you know
[59:10] i'm they they dress me well
[59:12] that's nonsense
[59:14] do you really think
[59:16] somebody in heaven
[59:17] is concerned about how you dress them in
[59:20] a coffin
[59:22] or put it this way anybody in hell
[59:26] do you really think they're concerned
[59:29] about how you dress them in a coffin
[59:32] it's vanity
[59:34] it's all vanity
[59:36] but you know we're subject to that we do
[59:37] that because of what people are going to
[59:39] think
[59:44] yes so i'm working with something here
[59:46] i'm trying to get something because i
[59:48] want you to understand the most
[59:50] important
[59:52] thing
[59:53] about you is your body
[59:57] hello
[59:59] understand this the bible says
[1:00:03] according to first corinthians the 6th
[1:00:04] chapter 19th and the 20th verse
[1:00:07] what
[1:00:08] know ye not that your body is the temple
[1:00:11] of the holy ghost which
[1:00:14] is in you
[1:00:16] which ye have of god
[1:00:18] and ye are not
[1:00:20] your own
[1:00:22] for ye are bought with a price
[1:00:24] therefore glory by god in your body and
[1:00:28] in your spirit which are gods
[1:00:31] now a lot of times us or people
[1:00:35] think
[1:00:35] amen that uh god god is just working
[1:00:39] with sanctification
[1:00:40] but no the bible is working with his
[1:00:43] body
[1:00:44] in his body you're supposed to do as his
[1:00:47] body would do
[1:00:48] if that makes sense
[1:00:50] however jesus is and that's what he says
[1:00:53] we are in this world as he is
[1:00:56] and we do the things that jesus do
[1:00:59] amen
[1:01:00] if jesus was living in this time and and
[1:01:04] i'm talking about
[1:01:05] you know this is going to be something i
[1:01:06] work with on the 10th when i get back
[1:01:08] but this is something i'm going to work
[1:01:10] with you see the bible says come
[1:01:12] together the more now some of us can't
[1:01:15] come because we're working and think god
[1:01:17] knows all of that and that's not what
[1:01:18] i'm talking about i'm talking about
[1:01:20] people who stay home
[1:01:22] doing nothing
[1:01:24] watching something amen
[1:01:27] you understand me and god said come
[1:01:29] together listen where is the holy ghost
[1:01:33] amen because the holy ghost will not
[1:01:35] break his
[1:01:36] word that's right y'all understand me
[1:01:39] the holy ghost will not break his word
[1:01:41] the holy ghost that's what brother said
[1:01:43] he said when that church door is open
[1:01:46] that real christian can hardly wait
[1:01:49] to get there
[1:01:53] you know what how counter christians are
[1:01:56] if brother brooks is not here they don't
[1:01:58] come
[1:01:59] that's so
[1:02:00] that's nonsense
[1:02:02] amen
[1:02:03] nonsense
[1:02:05] what who am i
[1:02:07] god speaks to troy and everybody else
[1:02:11] amen it's not a man this is not a man
[1:02:13] thing it's a god thing
[1:02:15] and it's carnal christians that stay
[1:02:17] home
[1:02:18] you're not even preparing
[1:02:23] when i speak this i'm talking about a
[1:02:24] group i i just
[1:02:26] you know
[1:02:27] met with a group anyway
[1:02:30] issues that we were talking about
[1:02:34] and it's the same way down in iowa city
[1:02:36] as it is here
[1:02:38] yeah
[1:02:39] friday night so they have friday night
[1:02:41] service and holiday nobody show up now
[1:02:44] what are they doing
[1:02:46] the same thing they're doing here on
[1:02:48] wednesday nights
[1:02:50] we're preparing
[1:02:51] and the bible said when you see that day
[1:02:54] approaching if you don't see it
[1:02:55] approaching something's wrong
[1:02:58] hallelujah come together the more i
[1:03:00] don't care if you're tired with one eye
[1:03:02] open
[1:03:04] god will honor it
[1:03:06] amen
[1:03:09] no you not and this is what i'm i was
[1:03:11] thinking with i says lord he wants to
[1:03:13] use my eyes he wants to use my hands he
[1:03:17] want to use your feet he want to walk in
[1:03:19] you he want to talk in you he want to
[1:03:22] worship in you
[1:03:23] you see what i'm saying
[1:03:24] everything that god would want to do he
[1:03:27] chose you to do it through
[1:03:29] that's why you call bride
[1:03:32] you're his body
[1:03:34] hallelujah it's okay
[1:03:36] keep preparing to meet him
[1:03:39] you know what i'm trying to say is that
[1:03:41] like a lot of times people don't
[1:03:42] understand they think well if i don't
[1:03:44] eat this i'll eat no no no no
[1:03:46] you understand what i'm saying
[1:03:48] god will sanctify you and he will fill
[1:03:51] you with the holy ghost if you are
[1:03:53] obedient
[1:03:54] amen
[1:03:57] you can have it
[1:03:58] but i'm talking maturity i'm talking
[1:04:01] about growing into the statue of christ
[1:04:03] i'm talking about allowing god to beat
[1:04:06] you into position
[1:04:09] right your gold tried in the fire amen
[1:04:14] tried that means bow
[1:04:19] the fire tries you it pulls out all of
[1:04:22] the draws
[1:04:23] y'all know what i'm saying anybody know
[1:04:25] what i'm talking about when you're under
[1:04:27] pressure that's the real you
[1:04:30] hallelujah but that doesn't mean the
[1:04:32] real you is lost that means the real you
[1:04:34] needs improvement
[1:04:36] amen
[1:04:38] thank god for the pressure amen
[1:04:41] hallelujah amen amen oh you you yeah the
[1:04:45] pastor go through his times of pressure
[1:04:47] too don't you dare
[1:04:52] yeah so anyway y'all understand what i'm
[1:04:56] talking about preparing
[1:04:58] you prepare
[1:05:00] it's like when you're gonna eat dinner
[1:05:03] you can't make dinner if you don't go
[1:05:05] prepared for it you gotta go shopping
[1:05:07] for the ingredients
[1:05:08] and all of the things that you're going
[1:05:10] to prepare
[1:05:11] right
[1:05:12] and you know you don't you don't start
[1:05:13] cooking the beans before you start
[1:05:15] cooking the meat
[1:05:17] because you know the meat is going to
[1:05:18] take longer especially if it's something
[1:05:19] that you're roasting
[1:05:21] now if it's fried chicken or something
[1:05:22] like that that's a different story
[1:05:24] but i'm talking about something that's
[1:05:25] going to be uh have a time to work with
[1:05:28] so what i'm trying to say is this how
[1:05:31] can how are you preparing to meet god
[1:05:34] let's just use a natural scenario where
[1:05:37] in a woman who's preparing she's already
[1:05:39] pregnant
[1:05:40] but she's also preparing for the baby to
[1:05:42] come
[1:05:44] and she's stacking up little items and
[1:05:45] foods and she's very preparing the room
[1:05:47] and all of these kinds of things she's
[1:05:49] doing and the baby has no idea that
[1:05:52] you're doing all of this
[1:05:54] but you are aware that the baby is
[1:05:55] coming
[1:05:57] so you prepare yourself for that event
[1:06:01] and guess what it never comes when you
[1:06:03] think it will
[1:06:05] so is the rapture amen it never comes
[1:06:08] when you think it will so therefore you
[1:06:10] need to be prepared
[1:06:13] i can remember the first time when my
[1:06:15] wife had her baby had crystal and we
[1:06:18] were working with a lot of germans they
[1:06:20] loved us they loved my wife as well and
[1:06:22] especially my wife and anyway uh they
[1:06:25] had prepared a baby shower for her
[1:06:28] but the baby came before the before they
[1:06:31] could have the shower
[1:06:33] and guess what
[1:06:35] i made history
[1:06:37] they gave the shower to me
[1:06:41] so i was the first man with a baby
[1:06:43] shower
[1:06:44] and at that time i didn't have a car so
[1:06:46] i had all these bags of baby stuff i had
[1:06:49] to get on the bus with all that stuff
[1:06:51] you know but i'll never forget it made
[1:06:54] god bless them i was a witness i tried
[1:06:56] to witness them
[1:06:57] the knowledge of jesus christ the best
[1:06:59] that i knew how
[1:07:00] many of them were catholic and some of
[1:07:02] them did change because i met them years
[1:07:04] later and they were how happy about how
[1:07:06] they were they were christian and how i
[1:07:07] talked to them things of that nature you
[1:07:09] understand what i'm saying but
[1:07:10] nevertheless
[1:07:13] the preparation
[1:07:15] was set before the baby so when the baby
[1:07:18] come but the baby came before she could
[1:07:20] celebrate you understand what i'm saying
[1:07:22] so what i'm trying to say is that listen
[1:07:24] people you don't get ready at the last
[1:07:26] minute
[1:07:29] when you know you've got issues in your
[1:07:31] life the only thing you can do is says
[1:07:33] lord help me
[1:07:34] clean
[1:07:36] cleanse me lord
[1:07:38] i heard the prophet god say something
[1:07:39] like this the other day which which
[1:07:41] amazed me
[1:07:42] he said
[1:07:44] i'm going to use the scripture because
[1:07:46] that's what he was working with the mind
[1:07:48] trying to control bring the mind unto
[1:07:49] suggestion and the subjection he said
[1:07:53] you know you continue to say lord let
[1:07:55] this mind be in me
[1:07:56] let the mind of jesus christ be in me
[1:07:59] let the mind he said continue to say
[1:08:02] that amen amen amen
[1:08:05] amen that's right when you know you're
[1:08:08] falling short you go before god and he
[1:08:10] says lord continue continue to let the
[1:08:13] mind of jesus christ be in me he said
[1:08:16] you keep saying it till it manifests
[1:08:18] itself
[1:08:21] so we got to keep saying those things
[1:08:23] that we're desiring and that's what he
[1:08:25] said even about the holy ghost he said
[1:08:27] if you can picture the holy ghost if you
[1:08:28] can picture jesus he said you in your
[1:08:31] mind if you can picture jesus he said
[1:08:33] you picture jesus and you walk to water
[1:08:36] until you come to it
[1:08:39] amen see that's what we those little
[1:08:42] nuggets those little things are laying
[1:08:44] in there sometimes they just jump out at
[1:08:46] us but if you're going to prepare
[1:08:48] yourself you must put on the whole arm
[1:08:50] of god now you say well what is the
[1:08:52] whole hammer god the divine nature of
[1:08:55] god is the whole arm of god
[1:08:59] not piece of it not just your helmet
[1:09:00] you've got to put on listen you're going
[1:09:03] to have to put on the whole armor
[1:09:04] for the trials they're getting ready to
[1:09:06] come
[1:09:08] now we're blind if we think that the
[1:09:10] stock market is not going to crash
[1:09:12] now we don't know exactly when but the
[1:09:14] way is
[1:09:16] teetering and
[1:09:18] shifting
[1:09:19] it looks like it's going to happen
[1:09:20] pretty soon
[1:09:22] if it doesn't when it does
[1:09:24] are you prepared
[1:09:28] oh you said what do you mean remember
[1:09:30] that remember that old widow woman
[1:09:33] in elijah's day
[1:09:35] when i said like this when the stock
[1:09:36] market crashed and famine was in the
[1:09:38] land
[1:09:40] and all she had was a little bit of meal
[1:09:42] and a little bit of oil
[1:09:44] that's all she had
[1:09:46] but one thing she had was faith in god
[1:09:49] she knew that the god she served amen
[1:09:52] was going to take care of everything she
[1:09:54] may not have known how he was going to
[1:09:56] do it but she knew he would
[1:09:59] when you have that kind of faith you
[1:10:01] activate god amen is that right we don't
[1:10:05] even know where elijah was but the bible
[1:10:08] said he was by that brook and god caused
[1:10:10] that brook to dry up
[1:10:12] and when the brook dried up
[1:10:15] he went looking
[1:10:17] god directed him to this little woman
[1:10:20] and god works on both ends
[1:10:22] god had already showed somebody's coming
[1:10:24] by y'all y'all know what i'm saying
[1:10:27] my old mama my mama gone she's gone but
[1:10:30] she's all junior i feel good to laugh in
[1:10:32] the blessing somehow i don't know how
[1:10:34] and what he's going to do but a blessing
[1:10:36] is coming listen it would always be that
[1:10:39] amen you ever wake up sometimes you're
[1:10:41] feeling good like something's good is
[1:10:43] about to happen
[1:10:44] and it happens
[1:10:46] somehow god gives you that little
[1:10:48] premonition of something of good that's
[1:10:51] going and then you got those things that
[1:10:52] feel bad too
[1:10:54] right how many of y'all feel sometimes
[1:10:56] when a person gets on your heart
[1:10:58] and you feel so burdened you know why
[1:11:00] that is you're supposed to pray for them
[1:11:02] that's intercessory they're in a place
[1:11:04] they cannot pray
[1:11:06] so god needs you to pray for them
[1:11:11] is that the body amen absolutely
[1:11:14] absolutely
[1:11:15] listen romans 12 1-2 says i beseech you
[1:11:19] therefore brethren by the mercies of god
[1:11:22] that you present your body a living
[1:11:25] sacrifice
[1:11:27] y'all know what that is
[1:11:28] that's mean even when you don't feel
[1:11:30] like doing it
[1:11:32] amen
[1:11:34] sacrifice you got to go out of your way
[1:11:36] that's right amen a living sacrifice
[1:11:39] what holy
[1:11:41] acceptable unto god which is your
[1:11:43] reasonable service
[1:11:46] and be not conformed to the world this
[1:11:49] world but be transformed by the renewing
[1:11:52] of your mind that you may prove what is
[1:11:54] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:11:57] will of god now that scripture to me is
[1:11:59] eternal
[1:12:01] it is the word of god
[1:12:03] but to prove what is good and acceptable
[1:12:05] in this day is not the same thing that
[1:12:07] noah had to do
[1:12:08] it's not the same thing that uh moses
[1:12:11] had to do because they had to noah had
[1:12:13] to build an ark
[1:12:14] more moses had to say put the blood on
[1:12:16] the doorpost in a little y'all
[1:12:18] understand me he did what was good and
[1:12:20] acceptable in the sight of god at every
[1:12:22] age every dispensation every church age
[1:12:25] things changes
[1:12:27] as i said last week what they did amen
[1:12:30] in ephesus is not the same thing we must
[1:12:32] do now
[1:12:33] ephesus had all the gifts
[1:12:36] emphasis had perfect love people amen
[1:12:39] they they had faith right let's put it
[1:12:40] this way did they have perfect faith
[1:12:43] is that right
[1:12:45] right
[1:12:45] but love work faith worketh by love
[1:12:48] so they had to have perfect love to have
[1:12:50] perfect faith
[1:12:51] amen amen you understand me and if you
[1:12:54] look yourself why couldn't they take the
[1:12:55] rapture because of you
[1:12:58] you and me
[1:12:59] because of us
[1:13:00] we had not come into place yet but one
[1:13:04] thing for certain we know that god
[1:13:07] interprets his own word
[1:13:09] hallelujah and therefore god by you
[1:13:14] coming into this message hearing the
[1:13:16] word of god for this age
[1:13:19] you are candidates
[1:13:20] for perfection
[1:13:22] and he that begun the good work in you
[1:13:25] is faithful to complete it it's not you
[1:13:29] it's him in you christ in you the hope
[1:13:33] of glory amen
[1:13:35] that's why i shout
[1:13:36] because i realize i'm not the maker
[1:13:40] i'm just the guy that he's making
[1:13:42] hallelujah
[1:13:44] i like to read this from the amplified
[1:13:46] version it really was a blessing to me
[1:13:49] romans 12 1-2
[1:13:52] i appeal to you therefore brethren
[1:13:55] and beg of you in view
[1:13:57] of all the mercies of god
[1:13:59] to make a decisive dedication of your
[1:14:02] bodies
[1:14:04] presenting all your members and
[1:14:06] faculties
[1:14:07] as a living sacrifice
[1:14:09] holy devoted consecrated and well
[1:14:13] pleasing to god
[1:14:14] which is your reasonable
[1:14:16] rational intelligence
[1:14:18] intelligent
[1:14:20] service and spiritual worship and you
[1:14:22] say well you are all service so i'm
[1:14:24] saying when the church need help where
[1:14:27] are the helpers
[1:14:28] and don't tell me helpers are not here
[1:14:30] because god said he put helpers in the
[1:14:32] church
[1:14:33] hallelujah
[1:14:35] but you've got so many people a man who
[1:14:38] think that their bodies is theirs
[1:14:43] if you're a christian
[1:14:44] you've been bought with a prize
[1:14:47] your body is not yours
[1:14:50] it's god's
[1:14:52] and god can do whatever he will let me
[1:14:55] say it like this if god has placed gifts
[1:14:57] in you and you fail to use those gifts
[1:15:00] you are in trouble
[1:15:02] remember the man who failed to use the
[1:15:04] gifts of god
[1:15:07] the judgment of god was not nice
[1:15:11] you understand me
[1:15:12] we are workers together
[1:15:14] we are lively stones
[1:15:17] fitted together for his purpose
[1:15:20] and we're supposed to use everything we
[1:15:23] have i mean i wish the whole church
[1:15:25] would be here i wish those if there'd be
[1:15:27] some on
[1:15:29] the youtube listening i would i want you
[1:15:30] to hear this because it's not in your
[1:15:33] body it's god you don't have you're not
[1:15:36] supposed to have a will your will if it
[1:15:38] be the will must be the will of god
[1:15:41] oh i don't you know what i'm trying to
[1:15:43] say is
[1:15:45] sometimes people say well brother brooks
[1:15:46] ain't here uh on on sundays enough where
[1:15:49] are you here on wednesdays i'm here
[1:15:52] almost every wednesday
[1:15:55] far more wednesdays than sundays
[1:15:58] and for those of us who don't come well
[1:16:00] don't come to church on wednesday
[1:16:02] i'm telling the world on you
[1:16:05] don't come to church on wednesday and
[1:16:07] then on sundays if i'm not here you're
[1:16:09] not here who is your god
[1:16:11] and i'm going to tell you something if
[1:16:13] i'm your god you're in trouble
[1:16:17] you're in trouble
[1:16:19] because i fall to every day
[1:16:24] amen
[1:16:26] my perfection comes from jesus christ
[1:16:28] alone
[1:16:30] y'all understand me but people think
[1:16:33] that they can just do what they want to
[1:16:34] do don't you understand even when it
[1:16:37] comes to me god is recording everything
[1:16:40] can you imagine how humiliated people
[1:16:43] will be when they know they're supposed
[1:16:45] to be in church and they're looking
[1:16:47] looking at something on tv or doing
[1:16:49] whatever i don't even know what people
[1:16:50] do nowadays
[1:16:51] i really don't know
[1:16:57] am i making sense
[1:17:00] yeah i'm telling on you
[1:17:02] do not
[1:17:03] do not be confirmed to this world this
[1:17:06] age right we don't work with the
[1:17:08] fashions
[1:17:11] we're not about the fashions we you know
[1:17:13] we dress as nice as we can we want to
[1:17:15] present ourselves in a nice way we come
[1:17:17] before the king y'all understand this
[1:17:19] when you come before the king just think
[1:17:21] if the king is here think about it
[1:17:24] you know there shouldn't be like a
[1:17:26] church
[1:17:27] doctrine that you gotta dress so and so
[1:17:29] and so and so but i think sometimes
[1:17:31] people forget who they're coming before
[1:17:36] that's the truth
[1:17:38] we must understand it ain't supposed to
[1:17:40] be all of that but god don't care about
[1:17:43] what i look like oh yes he does he even
[1:17:45] cares about all the colors you wear
[1:17:49] you say god don't care don't you know he
[1:17:51] said not even one hair on your head
[1:17:53] should perish
[1:17:56] whether you see all mine or not i still
[1:17:58] got them
[1:17:59] right so you got to understand god cares
[1:18:02] about everything about you you his
[1:18:04] design
[1:18:06] you're his image he cares about you and
[1:18:09] he wants to see us prosper he wants to
[1:18:11] see us do good he says he will that we
[1:18:14] prosper even as our soul prosper so god
[1:18:17] is not trying to keep any natural
[1:18:19] substance from you if he said seek ye
[1:18:21] first the kingdom of god and his
[1:18:23] righteousness and all these other things
[1:18:25] will be added if you do that in faith
[1:18:28] everything will be added
[1:18:32] yes your desire is that right he said if
[1:18:34] you if you if you abide in me and my
[1:18:36] word abide in you you can ask whatsoever
[1:18:39] you will i like that word whatsoever
[1:18:41] whatsoever you will and it shall be
[1:18:43] given unto you all you got to do is stay
[1:18:46] in the word and let the word stay in you
[1:18:49] and god will give you whatever you
[1:18:50] desire
[1:18:52] is that the truth
[1:18:53] it's in the scripture
[1:18:55] esther
[1:18:56] i love esther so y'all gonna hear me
[1:18:58] talk about her i can't hardly wait till
[1:18:59] i get her see her you know oh i want to
[1:19:01] see her you know me
[1:19:04] because we think it was a light thing no
[1:19:05] sir
[1:19:06] esther had all the pressures of the
[1:19:08] world on her
[1:19:09] can you imagine this woman you know like
[1:19:11] i said the world on her shoulders not
[1:19:13] only was she caring about her her life
[1:19:15] her life but she had the whole of israel
[1:19:18] the burden of israel saving them on her
[1:19:21] shoulder
[1:19:26] yes so anyway let's move on if i say uh
[1:19:30] it goes on to say and and and and be not
[1:19:33] conformed to this world this age fashion
[1:19:35] after and a doc adapted to it's a
[1:19:38] external uh
[1:19:40] uh
[1:19:42] uh excuse me superficial customs
[1:19:45] but he
[1:19:47] transformed or changed by the entire or
[1:19:50] renewal of your mind and this is what
[1:19:52] people say you want to be changed this
[1:19:54] is your renewal
[1:19:56] this is your soul
[1:19:58] the word of god will wash your mind amen
[1:20:02] you can't expect amen to be cleansed in
[1:20:05] your spirit if you don't read the bible
[1:20:08] or listen to the message
[1:20:10] hallelujah i'm going to tell you
[1:20:12] something you need a you you got you got
[1:20:14] a real request
[1:20:16] and i tell you what if you listen to
[1:20:17] enough tapes all you got to do is ask
[1:20:19] god to show you boom
[1:20:21] and god will direct you right to that
[1:20:24] anybody know what i'm talking about i'm
[1:20:26] a witness
[1:20:28] answer's right there on the tape
[1:20:31] there are times there's one tape i was
[1:20:34] even called my name isaiah i'm like wow
[1:20:38] because that was what i was going
[1:20:40] through
[1:20:41] but somebody else's name was isaac
[1:20:44] you understand me it was the idea of the
[1:20:46] bible but when he said it it
[1:20:48] it just
[1:20:49] it was me i can't explain it y'all think
[1:20:52] i'm crazy but anyway
[1:20:54] so you got what we're doing and i'll try
[1:20:56] my best you know i don't have that watch
[1:20:57] back but the thing is we must learn that
[1:21:01] this is the hour to prepare ourselves is
[1:21:03] that the scripture the bible says
[1:21:05] matthew 25 there were
[1:21:07] ten versions and the voice at midnight
[1:21:10] cry go what do i go meet the lord
[1:21:13] prepare to meet the lord you've got to
[1:21:16] prepare do you think you're going to
[1:21:17] meet him any kind of way even esther
[1:21:20] knew not to just go in in any kind of
[1:21:22] clothes you've got to go in in the robe
[1:21:24] that he furnished what is the road that
[1:21:27] god furnished for you other than the
[1:21:29] holy ghost
[1:21:31] that's the that's the that's what opens
[1:21:33] the door of heaven for you
[1:21:35] the holy ghost that's the key
[1:21:42] is that right because when he went into
[1:21:44] heaven y'all remember i love that story
[1:21:46] i wish i was a good actor but i can't do
[1:21:48] it but when when when the angels said oh
[1:21:51] lift up your head all your gates and and
[1:21:53] you everlasting doors and let the
[1:21:55] kingdom glory come in
[1:21:57] and then the angels cried out who was
[1:21:59] that king of glory
[1:22:01] and that whole said the lord almighty
[1:22:04] strong in that amen he is the king of
[1:22:07] glory when he said that those gays swung
[1:22:09] open
[1:22:10] y'all understand me he is the key
[1:22:13] without jesus christ
[1:22:15] the door won't open that's right why
[1:22:17] because he is the door amen hallelujah
[1:22:20] he is the door amen oh glory to god
[1:22:25] right
[1:22:26] it is that time
[1:22:27] and people don't well
[1:22:29] i'll tell you what
[1:22:31] there's a lot of visions people say they
[1:22:33] went to hell and came back well i don't
[1:22:34] believe that
[1:22:36] right
[1:22:37] because when the rich man went down
[1:22:39] there god wouldn't let him back
[1:22:42] and uh i just said it's possible they
[1:22:44] had a dream
[1:22:45] and maybe god warned him in the dream
[1:22:47] but i don't think they truly went there
[1:22:50] uh-uh that's how so many people say oh
[1:22:53] well i went to heaven and i saw little
[1:22:56] children right then you know it's a lie
[1:22:59] there are no children in heaven
[1:23:02] when you die you don't go to go to uh
[1:23:05] even if you're a baby when you go to
[1:23:08] you go in the perfect image
[1:23:10] that god made you
[1:23:12] and
[1:23:12] babies came by way of the sin that's
[1:23:15] right amen
[1:23:16] everybody was supposed to be created as
[1:23:18] brothers and sisters full adults
[1:23:26] ain't gonna be no babies can you imagine
[1:23:28] you've been in heaven and have to feed a
[1:23:30] baby
[1:23:31] change your baby
[1:23:35] it won't be heaven for you
[1:23:37] y'all understand me it's not going to be
[1:23:39] that
[1:23:41] and but people believe that kind of
[1:23:43] stuff
[1:23:46] hallelujah you love the lord
[1:23:48] you think about it how the pill of fire
[1:23:51] is so powerful who is jesus christ
[1:23:53] himself amen right
[1:23:55] god always proves his word and he pushes
[1:23:58] us to the limit to see if we true
[1:24:00] believers
[1:24:01] absolutely amen he didn't he didn't say
[1:24:04] okay you know we're going to throw them
[1:24:06] into the lion's den daniel to the lion's
[1:24:08] den and you know i'm going to let daniel
[1:24:10] know that i'll be in there he did not
[1:24:15] but when daniel walked in there he found
[1:24:18] out that the god
[1:24:19] that he's always worshipped
[1:24:21] was standing there too
[1:24:23] he was the one not daniel he was the one
[1:24:26] that made those lions keep their mouth
[1:24:29] shut
[1:24:32] god was in the fire like i said when
[1:24:35] when he told noah come on in the ark
[1:24:37] that means that he was in the yard if he
[1:24:39] wasn't in the yacht and said go into the
[1:24:41] yacht he didn't say it he said come on
[1:24:44] into your heart y'all understand me
[1:24:46] that's why when the fire comes he'll say
[1:24:48] come on in the fire
[1:24:50] hallelujah because he is the fire he in
[1:24:53] the fire
[1:24:54] hallelujah you love the lord
[1:24:56] so what we're doing with all of our
[1:24:58] hearts and our minds and i don't know
[1:24:59] about you i have to confess and ask for
[1:25:03] forgiveness every day
[1:25:05] somewhere
[1:25:07] i find myself coming short amen but
[1:25:10] listen i know who to turn to
[1:25:14] you understand me i have a savior who's
[1:25:17] able to save me to the uttermost
[1:25:20] not the almost the uttermost
[1:25:24] and the only way we'll climb this ladder
[1:25:26] we must learn how to deny ourselves not
[1:25:30] my will lord but time be done
[1:25:33] can you imagine
[1:25:34] what what what what what paul went
[1:25:36] through
[1:25:37] paul was
[1:25:38] considered dead i believe three times
[1:25:42] how many of us would have said well lord
[1:25:43] that's enough now
[1:25:45] i mean
[1:25:47] these people don't kill me three times
[1:25:49] you resurrect me three times y'all
[1:25:51] understand that
[1:25:52] can you imagine he didn't go to heaven
[1:25:55] he was resurrected
[1:25:57] three times
[1:26:00] to know that he had to die again
[1:26:02] so you can't imagine what what paul
[1:26:06] felt and what he felt like when he
[1:26:08] realized this is the final
[1:26:10] i'm going to nero's dropping block
[1:26:13] and the same god that raised me up will
[1:26:15] be the same god waiting for me there
[1:26:19] hallelujah but paul was not afraid of
[1:26:21] death he said oh death where's your
[1:26:23] stain oh grave where is your victory
[1:26:26] thanks be to god who's given me the
[1:26:28] victory to our lord jesus christ amen
[1:26:31] paul wasn't afraid he said i've fought a
[1:26:34] good fight i have kept the faith and
[1:26:37] there remains for me a crown of
[1:26:39] righteousness not just for me but all
[1:26:42] who believe in the same way i believe
[1:26:46] and i believe it amen i believe it amen
[1:26:51] dress
[1:26:52] dress
[1:26:54] see
[1:26:55] brother said like this he said by true
[1:26:57] believers he said he proves his word not
[1:27:00] by those who say they believe but those
[1:27:03] who really believe it's by
[1:27:05] his
[1:27:07] his believing children that he proves
[1:27:10] his word
[1:27:12] you got to be a believer this word is
[1:27:14] not for a non-believer
[1:27:16] right and the see there is no excuses we
[1:27:19] understand the raptures at hand the
[1:27:21] seven church age is basically over i say
[1:27:24] it is because in 1957 56 amen they the
[1:27:28] the they were try indictment was given
[1:27:31] to them by god they were tried in the
[1:27:33] fire
[1:27:34] hallelujah and in 1963 you got to
[1:27:37] understand the messenger was put out of
[1:27:40] the church
[1:27:41] he told us that he said i've gone come
[1:27:43] down to phoenix in tucson and none of
[1:27:45] these people would allow me to even come
[1:27:47] preach in their church
[1:27:49] it wasn't him
[1:27:51] i'm not talking about the man i'm
[1:27:53] talking about the world in which he was
[1:27:54] carrying
[1:27:56] hallelujah and right now they don't
[1:27:59] understand what took place with the
[1:28:00] cloud they now people just disputing it
[1:28:03] and said it wasn't real would go head-on
[1:28:06] they didn't believe christ in his first
[1:28:08] resurrection
[1:28:09] they're not going to believe the second
[1:28:10] one either
[1:28:11] you know why because it's not going to
[1:28:13] come the way they think it's going to
[1:28:14] come
[1:28:16] we're going to see him
[1:28:18] there will be a corporal body yes we
[1:28:20] will see him
[1:28:22] hallelujah i don't know how he's going
[1:28:25] to do it all but i know he's going to do
[1:28:27] it
[1:28:27] however he interprets it is fine with me
[1:28:30] but i know something took place that
[1:28:32] would that that put that gave the bride
[1:28:35] rapturing faith see what i'm trying to
[1:28:37] say is when you know this is the season
[1:28:40] it will give you rapturing faith
[1:28:43] hey
[1:28:44] yes sir it'll give you rapturing faith
[1:28:47] when you know that the bus is coming
[1:28:49] at seven o'clock
[1:28:51] hallelujah you gonna be there
[1:28:54] you might even be there waiting on the
[1:28:56] bus
[1:28:57] but you're going to be there because you
[1:28:58] know it's coming at seven o'clock why
[1:29:00] because you have the schedule
[1:29:03] hallelujah and we have the schedule what
[1:29:06] schedule the word of god the word of
[1:29:09] prophecy we have seen how god has been
[1:29:11] working all the way up through the
[1:29:13] church age there not be another one this
[1:29:16] is the end
[1:29:18] hallelujah there'll not be another angel
[1:29:21] or messenger this is the end and the
[1:29:24] only thing we have listen if it wasn't
[1:29:26] true
[1:29:27] if this wasn't true
[1:29:28] then he was not like john the baptist he
[1:29:31] was not elijah
[1:29:32] you understand me
[1:29:34] because once elijah
[1:29:36] introduced jesus elijah was taken off
[1:29:39] the scene
[1:29:41] amen y'all hear me and once this elijah
[1:29:44] introduced jesus christ
[1:29:47] he said that's my lord
[1:29:50] hallelujah and a word oh my god was
[1:29:53] given to him to feed us
[1:29:56] because his whole purpose was lord i
[1:29:59] desire to dress the bride of jesus
[1:30:01] christ and god gave him the word those
[1:30:04] seven thunders and everything that comes
[1:30:07] with it was the bride's dress
[1:30:11] it really is
[1:30:14] oh yes
[1:30:15] we've got something the world don't have
[1:30:17] and then we take it for granted are you
[1:30:19] serious
[1:30:21] do you realize what time it is
[1:30:24] hallelujah it's putting on comet time
[1:30:27] it's preparing yourself amen because
[1:30:30] remember he said in a moment in the
[1:30:32] tweaking of an eye you won't even be
[1:30:34] able to get ready
[1:30:37] one two in the bed one taken two in the
[1:30:39] field one taken
[1:30:40] that's the way it goes
[1:30:43] your time of preparation is now
[1:30:46] hallelujah listen
[1:30:48] but you know what the truth of the
[1:30:50] bounty is we've got to love one another
[1:30:52] that's right that's right
[1:30:54] romans 13 10 says through 14 says love
[1:30:57] worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore
[1:31:00] love is the fulfillment of the law
[1:31:03] and there's something and we find it so
[1:31:05] difficult to do
[1:31:06] but if you got god in you
[1:31:08] because god is love
[1:31:10] and the point is if you find in the
[1:31:12] difficult is when you with you refusing
[1:31:14] to say lord not my will
[1:31:18] like i have a new saying i am a
[1:31:21] worshiper of the word amen
[1:31:24] that's me
[1:31:25] i worship the word
[1:31:28] hallelujah therefore love is the
[1:31:30] fulfillment of the law and
[1:31:33] that knowing the time that now it is
[1:31:36] high time to awake out of sleep
[1:31:39] for now is your salvation nearer than
[1:31:42] when we believe the night is far spent
[1:31:46] the day is at hand let us therefore cast
[1:31:49] off the works of darkness and let us put
[1:31:52] on the armor of light not put on not put
[1:31:55] on the works of darkness cast them out
[1:31:58] let us walk earnestly as in the day not
[1:32:01] in rioting and drunkenness and not in
[1:32:03] chambering and wanting this not in
[1:32:05] strife and envying but put it on the
[1:32:08] lord jesus christ what
[1:32:11] if i put him on that's all you're going
[1:32:12] to see
[1:32:14] put him on put on the lord jesus christ
[1:32:17] and make no provision for the flesh to
[1:32:21] fulfill the lust thereof
[1:32:24] amen
[1:32:24] and that's where we fight
[1:32:26] don't we
[1:32:28] amen we fight
[1:32:31] don't you think you're gonna get rid of
[1:32:32] your flesh
[1:32:34] until he gets rid of it
[1:32:36] and as long as you got this old man
[1:32:38] you're to have to die daily and you're
[1:32:40] going to have to willfully desire to not
[1:32:43] do evil
[1:32:46] hallelujah just give him a little inch
[1:32:48] and he'll take a mile
[1:32:50] that's what my mom used to say you can't
[1:32:52] give the devil a edge boy you give the
[1:32:54] devil an inch he's going to take a mile
[1:32:55] and that's the truth he doesn't know
[1:32:57] where to stop
[1:32:59] he drives you as far as he can take you
[1:33:02] right
[1:33:03] put you on the lord jesus christ and
[1:33:05] make no provision for the flesh to
[1:33:07] fulfill the lust thereof galatians 3
[1:33:10] galatians 3 27 for as many of you as
[1:33:13] been
[1:33:14] baptized into christ have put on christ
[1:33:19] that's the whole armor of god now i'm
[1:33:22] not going to be able to finish this
[1:33:23] because i've got a lot more but i want
[1:33:24] to read this
[1:33:26] because i want you to know by god's
[1:33:28] grace
[1:33:28] we're living in the day
[1:33:30] you got to make sure you're not tied
[1:33:33] to traditions and systems things of that
[1:33:36] nature
[1:33:37] you got to understand that i do what i
[1:33:39] do because i love god and his word tells
[1:33:41] me so not because i've got somebody
[1:33:44] ruling over me
[1:33:45] you understand me that's not right
[1:33:48] god made you free you're not a prisoner
[1:33:51] not to me and no one else
[1:33:53] right i'm your pastor but i'm also your
[1:33:55] brother
[1:33:56] right it takes the same blood to save me
[1:33:59] that it's going to take to save you
[1:34:01] same blood i'm no different right
[1:34:04] i'm just like paul said the least of all
[1:34:06] and i'm we all still say by grace people
[1:34:08] say well i don't know brother we say so
[1:34:10] i'm predestinated but predestination is
[1:34:13] predestined by your choice
[1:34:16] it's what you choose to do and what you
[1:34:18] have chosen to do and god knows what you
[1:34:21] have chosen to do before
[1:34:24] i heard the prophets just said it
[1:34:25] today
[1:34:26] on proving his word
[1:34:28] you've got to choose and because you
[1:34:30] chose this message it's the reason why
[1:34:32] you chose this message because he saw
[1:34:34] you choosing him amen
[1:34:37] yes you know like i was telling somebody
[1:34:40] the other day i said some people think
[1:34:41] oh oh it was predestinated when i
[1:34:43] married her it was god predestinated it
[1:34:46] and and you married the devil god don't
[1:34:48] predestinate you to marry a devil when
[1:34:50] god told you to be not to be unequally
[1:34:52] yoked
[1:34:53] that was your choosing
[1:34:56] here working towards your good
[1:34:58] y'all understand me yeah it's the truth
[1:35:01] don't tell me god is causing you to sin
[1:35:03] god don't cause you to sin
[1:35:06] why do you think the prophet god said
[1:35:07] you got to be careful you got to be
[1:35:09] prayerful you got to look and make sure
[1:35:11] the one you marry is yours it came from
[1:35:13] god why would he tell you that if god
[1:35:15] didn't already ordain what you you know
[1:35:21] no it don't work like that
[1:35:23] now god will
[1:35:25] show you your bride
[1:35:27] or your vice versa
[1:35:30] he showed me mine
[1:35:32] so god will do it
[1:35:34] listen let me go ahead and y'all got
[1:35:35] quiet on me that because a lot of times
[1:35:37] y'all think if i stumped my toe god
[1:35:39] predestinated it no you just wasn't
[1:35:42] looking down
[1:35:45] he might he might heal your toe but he
[1:35:48] didn't make you stomp your toe
[1:35:51] why would when you stomp your door what
[1:35:52] do you say that old devil
[1:35:56] we put it on the devil and the reason
[1:35:58] why we stumped it is because we weren't
[1:36:00] looking down
[1:36:06] oh god help us lord i'm just giving this
[1:36:08] this is just common sense folks this is
[1:36:10] just what we do
[1:36:11] right what would be the punishment
[1:36:21] what would be the punishment of the
[1:36:23] harlot in her children
[1:36:26] well it's going to be twofold
[1:36:29] first he said i will cast her into a bed
[1:36:32] according to the last part of verse 22
[1:36:35] it will be a bed of tribulation
[1:36:38] or the great tribulation
[1:36:40] that is exactly what jesus said in
[1:36:41] matthew 25 1-13
[1:36:44] there were ten virgins five were wise
[1:36:47] and five were foolish the five wives had
[1:36:51] all that means the holy spirit but the
[1:36:53] other five did not
[1:36:55] when the cry went out went up behold the
[1:36:58] bridegroom coming
[1:36:59] the foolish had to run seeking oil while
[1:37:03] the wise virgins went in to the marriage
[1:37:07] do you understand that that means people
[1:37:09] who are seeking the holy that's why you
[1:37:11] got to be careful that's why if you can
[1:37:12] get it you better get it now because
[1:37:14] there's a time when the door is going to
[1:37:16] be shut and you won't be able you can
[1:37:18] cry until you've got no more tears once
[1:37:21] that door is shut that means you can't
[1:37:24] get in
[1:37:26] that's the truth
[1:37:28] because they were dilatory
[1:37:31] you know they were slowfall about what
[1:37:33] they needed to do
[1:37:35] and they ran out of oil these were
[1:37:37] christians now
[1:37:38] they weren't just sinners these were
[1:37:40] christians
[1:37:45] when the cry went up behold the bible
[1:37:48] coming the foolish went out had to run
[1:37:50] seeking oil while the wise virgins went
[1:37:53] in to the marriage
[1:37:55] for the five that remain outside were
[1:37:58] left
[1:37:58] to the great tribulation that is what
[1:38:01] will happen to all who do not go up in
[1:38:05] the rapture that's right that is what
[1:38:07] will come upon the harlot and her
[1:38:09] daughters
[1:38:11] secondly it says that he will kill them
[1:38:14] with death
[1:38:15] or as literally translated says
[1:38:18] let them be put to death with death
[1:38:21] there is a strength this this this is a
[1:38:23] strange saying
[1:38:24] we might say let a man be put to death
[1:38:27] by hanging or by electrocution or some
[1:38:30] other way
[1:38:31] but this says let them be put to death
[1:38:35] by death
[1:38:36] you see because death itself is the
[1:38:39] cause of their death
[1:38:41] spiritual death is the cause of their
[1:38:44] death
[1:38:46] you love the lord
[1:38:48] yes
[1:38:50] yes
[1:38:51] and in the face of all this
[1:38:54] doubt
[1:38:56] proving his word
[1:38:57] is that god
[1:39:01] does go right on
[1:39:04] provide proving his word to be right
[1:39:07] as he has in every age
[1:39:10] unbelief doesn't stop god
[1:39:12] it doesn't hinder him
[1:39:14] i don't care how much the world
[1:39:17] unbelieves
[1:39:19] it'll still
[1:39:20] it's still going to happen
[1:39:23] unbelief doesn't do anything but condemn
[1:39:26] the unbeliever amen the unbelief will
[1:39:29] send the unbeliever to hell
[1:39:32] it'll rob him of every blessing god
[1:39:34] provided amen
[1:39:36] to him
[1:39:37] but it doesn't hinder god from going
[1:39:39] right on with the believer see
[1:39:42] unbelief doesn't stop god it only
[1:39:45] stopped the unbeliever
[1:39:49] you got to understand
[1:39:50] you can't stop god
[1:39:52] people can't stop god they thought they
[1:39:54] could stop him even in the romans day
[1:39:56] when they put him in that tomb and roll
[1:39:58] the stone away
[1:40:00] rolled the stone up to the tomb they
[1:40:02] thought if the roman seal was there
[1:40:04] nothing could be broke can break it but
[1:40:06] they didn't understand the god who
[1:40:07] ripped the curtain
[1:40:09] the veil and twain was the same god amen
[1:40:11] that rolled away the stone
[1:40:14] nobody can stop god i don't care how
[1:40:16] intellectual people get i don't care if
[1:40:18] they say oh and you know what kills me
[1:40:21] oh what gets me sometime and i hate to
[1:40:23] use that word killed it doesn't kill me
[1:40:24] but what really gets next to me is when
[1:40:27] i hear people
[1:40:29] searching and looking and saying
[1:40:33] we need to find out where we came from
[1:40:37] we need our origin
[1:40:39] i mean even in scientists they have
[1:40:42] found out that in every man in your dna
[1:40:45] there's a i wish i could scientifically
[1:40:47] explain it
[1:40:49] but it it it
[1:40:50] it's in the hebrew language all the way
[1:40:52] back it's in three the major three
[1:40:54] languages
[1:40:55] uh in your body it says god
[1:40:59] in a body
[1:41:00] that's in you
[1:41:02] that's what's what's supposed to be in
[1:41:04] you
[1:41:05] god in the body
[1:41:06] because that's what was in adam god in
[1:41:09] the body that was what was in jesus god
[1:41:12] in the body that was what was in the
[1:41:14] children of the the day of pentecost it
[1:41:17] was god in the body
[1:41:19] and at the end is going to be god in a
[1:41:21] body amen
[1:41:23] that's what it's all about
[1:41:24] children of god because god is in the
[1:41:27] body
[1:41:28] and we must prepare
[1:41:30] if they had to circu if they had to
[1:41:32] sanctify everything in the temple in the
[1:41:35] old shadows and types don't you think
[1:41:38] don't you even dare think that those
[1:41:40] shadows and types meant nothing
[1:41:43] everything has to be sanctified your
[1:41:45] heart had to be sanctified you know what
[1:41:47] probably god said in closing he said
[1:41:50] you see
[1:41:52] through your heart
[1:41:56] you see
[1:41:58] through your heart if your heart is pure
[1:42:01] everything you see will be pure if your
[1:42:04] heart is corrupt
[1:42:06] you you're gonna see corrupt things
[1:42:08] you understand me you judge things by
[1:42:11] this
[1:42:12] and this is what you see when you judge
[1:42:14] and it doesn't even mean that what
[1:42:15] you're seeing with your heart is correct
[1:42:19] you understand me let's stand
[1:42:22] is that right you say well what do you
[1:42:24] mean brother brooks let me say it like
[1:42:26] this remember the woman with the purple
[1:42:27] nails purple hair purple everything
[1:42:30] he was seeing through his heart
[1:42:32] the prophet my prophet was seeing
[1:42:34] through his heart and says lord why
[1:42:36] don't you just wipe her off the face of
[1:42:37] the earth
[1:42:40] huh god had to correct it y'all
[1:42:42] understand me we all need correction
[1:42:44] and i won't correct you i don't want to
[1:42:46] think i'm right and i'm wrong
[1:42:48] but i want it and the thing is he was
[1:42:50] seeing with his heart
[1:42:52] and god says that got to be correct
[1:42:54] because i want you to understand the
[1:42:55] same blood that saves you is the same
[1:42:56] blood that saves her
[1:42:58] and you don't even know her background
[1:42:59] but i do that's right
[1:43:03] hey then he goes and talk to her and she
[1:43:05] said you know i once was a christian i
[1:43:06] once was a methodist
[1:43:08] she had to touch god somehow some way
[1:43:11] because god never forgot about him
[1:43:14] and that's one thing i love about god
[1:43:16] the bible says that god all all god will
[1:43:20] not leave one behind
[1:43:23] it doesn't care what condition you're in
[1:43:25] at this point in time because if you're
[1:43:27] meant to make a rapture god is going to
[1:43:29] force the issue
[1:43:30] amen
[1:43:32] he's going to force it and you know what
[1:43:34] i said to the people of god why would
[1:43:36] you believe anything else
[1:43:38] ah none of us
[1:43:40] is worthy
[1:43:41] the scripture says when the lamb needed
[1:43:43] to take the book john says uh who's
[1:43:45] worthy to take the book he said there
[1:43:47] was none in heaven there was none in the
[1:43:49] earth there was none above the earth
[1:43:51] there was none nowhere worthy
[1:43:53] and john began to weep
[1:43:56] because there was no one worthy john
[1:43:58] knew he wasn't worthy how in the world
[1:44:00] john got to heaven and knew he wasn't
[1:44:02] worthy but he was dead
[1:44:04] [Music]
[1:44:08] the boys
[1:44:09] say don't weep john i love that scene
[1:44:13] the line of the tribe of judah has
[1:44:15] prevailed
[1:44:17] john said he looked round to see a lion
[1:44:20] that's what brother brown said you got
[1:44:21] to keep sweet
[1:44:23] meek
[1:44:24] and sweet and that's what people don't
[1:44:25] want to do they're ain't gonna let a lot
[1:44:27] of run over me no just sweet and
[1:44:29] meekness you gotta be a lamb because
[1:44:32] when he turned he saw not a lie in the
[1:44:34] land and that's the nature god is
[1:44:36] looking for right now
[1:44:37] you and i must become lambs of god
[1:44:41] if you're going to be in the lamb's book
[1:44:42] of life
[1:44:44] you must become a lamb
[1:44:45] and the only way that you and i can
[1:44:47] become a lamb is that we be born in
[1:44:49] birth by the lamb
[1:44:51] who is jesus christ himself
[1:44:54] you love the lord
[1:44:55] it's not hard
[1:44:57] like i was telling somebody the other
[1:44:59] day
[1:45:03] you say let go
[1:45:04] how do i do that
[1:45:06] is it difficult
[1:45:08] you see this
[1:45:09] no
[1:45:10] in your mind you make it you make it
[1:45:12] difficult because there's something that
[1:45:14] still won't hold to it
[1:45:17] but when you make up your mind
[1:45:19] to let go
[1:45:20] look how simple this is
[1:45:24] but just as simple as it is to let it go
[1:45:27] it's still simple enough
[1:45:29] i can pick it back up
[1:45:31] see
[1:45:33] but once you let it go you got to leave
[1:45:34] it there
[1:45:36] let the janitors clean it
[1:45:39] you see what i'm saying does it hurt oh
[1:45:42] especially if there's something deep
[1:45:45] the bible said you know when you see
[1:45:47] you've ceased from sin you're going to
[1:45:49] suffer
[1:45:50] when you cease from disbelieving there's
[1:45:52] suffering that comes with it amen it
[1:45:55] comes it's part of it can you you and i
[1:45:57] cannot measure up to the suffering that
[1:45:59] christ went through
[1:46:01] and that's all i'm saying we gonna
[1:46:03] suffer it's all part of it
[1:46:05] but you know what god in our suffering
[1:46:07] the bible said we have not a high priest
[1:46:09] that cannot be touched by the feelings
[1:46:12] of our infirmities
[1:46:14] he can be touched if you allow him to
[1:46:17] and don't feel bad because you suffer
[1:46:20] remember there's always somebody that's
[1:46:21] suffering more than you
[1:46:24] i tell you i thank god for the trials
[1:46:26] that god i go through
[1:46:28] because i know people i think about my
[1:46:30] precious brother and i hope he wouldn't
[1:46:32] mind me say this brother ronaldine
[1:46:34] spencer that suffers all the time he's a
[1:46:36] powerful preacher
[1:46:38] and god anoints his preaching and many
[1:46:41] people many souls have gotten saved
[1:46:42] under his ministry
[1:46:44] but i he have gone through one trial
[1:46:46] after another i mean sickness is near
[1:46:49] death and cancer
[1:46:52] even when it wasn't him his wife went
[1:46:54] through cancer situations and and his
[1:46:56] his in-laws and i mean just
[1:46:59] always seemed like and you know i just
[1:47:02] settled it in my mind i said god
[1:47:05] because i know this brother loves you
[1:47:07] i said there are some people who are
[1:47:09] ordained to suffer
[1:47:11] paul was ordained to suffer
[1:47:13] and all of those disciples that followed
[1:47:16] jesus had no idea when they first joined
[1:47:19] up with him
[1:47:20] that they was going to have to give
[1:47:21] their lives forth
[1:47:23] but many of them suffered
[1:47:26] this is a way of the cross
[1:47:29] this is the way of the cross it's not
[1:47:30] easy
[1:47:31] but i just want to encourage you i want
[1:47:33] to encourage you tonight that no matter
[1:47:35] what you go through
[1:47:36] don't let go
[1:47:38] or don't put yourself in a place where
[1:47:40] he has to let you go
[1:47:43] you understand what i'm saying
[1:47:45] because god is real and he's rich in
[1:47:46] mercy he's rich in grace
[1:47:48] and you know i look at myself and the
[1:47:51] things that i've gone through it's been
[1:47:52] difficult it's been hard but you know
[1:47:54] what
[1:47:55] [Music]
[1:47:56] i'll take my cross
[1:47:58] i'll let you take yours
[1:48:02] i carry mine
[1:48:04] and i know you ordained to carry yours
[1:48:06] and think about it people i get so
[1:48:08] excited sometime and i have to fight
[1:48:10] back tears because i realize it ain't
[1:48:12] long
