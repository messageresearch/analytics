[23:18] everybody let me start my timer
[23:25] before okay I only have 20 minutes
[23:30] you pray for
[23:31] me all right let's go straight to the
[23:35] word open the Bible in the book of
[23:38] Second
[23:39] Kings we'll read the ver uh chapter uh
[23:43] chapter 13 we read the verse
[23:48] 14 uh Second Kings 13 14-
[23:56] 17
[23:58] amen
[24:00] amen uh this is
[24:02] U it's a subject that you know I was
[24:06] working on a couple
[24:10] hours I'll try my by my Best by the
[24:13] grace of
[24:15] God Amen let's uh let's let's read
[24:20] verse now Elisha was Fallen sick of his
[24:23] sickness whereof he
[24:26] died
[24:30] and joash the king of Israel came down
[24:32] unto him and wept over his face and said
[24:36] oh my father my father The Chariot of
[24:39] Israel and the horsemen
[24:49] thereof and Elisha said unto him take B
[24:53] uh take bow and
[24:55] arrows and he took unto him born
[25:02] arrows and he said unto the he said he
[25:04] said to the king he said to the king of
[25:07] Israel put thine hand upon the bow and
[25:09] he puts his hand upon upon it and Elisha
[25:12] put his hands upon the
[25:21] king man and he said open the window
[25:24] Eastward and he opened it then elishah
[25:27] said shoot and you shot and he said the
[25:30] eror of the Lord's deliverance and the
[25:32] error of deliverance from Syria for Thou
[25:36] shalt Smite the the Syrian in AEK till
[25:40] thou has consumed
[25:56] them amen let's bow our
[25:58] heads father God we humbly come before
[26:01] your throne of
[26:03] grace just to say thank you Father Lord
[26:07] thank you for this new year that you're
[26:08] about to give us
[26:10] Lord and thank you for all the blessings
[26:12] that you given
[26:13] us now I pray that you help me to be so
[26:16] sensitive to the Holy
[26:18] Spirit Lord so I can only say what you
[26:20] want me to
[26:22] say bless their hearts that will hear
[26:24] the
[26:25] word in Jesus Christ name we
[26:29] pray amen you may be see that amen so I
[26:32] have a very small
[26:35] subject that uh we entitled the scant fa
[26:39] the scant faith of Jo
[26:43] joash SC that's uh means you know barely
[26:46] sufficient something that not
[26:50] enough amen the SK faith of of
[26:55] joash as we read here you'll see that
[26:57] Elisha was at you know Elisha wanted I
[27:01] mean was about to
[27:04] die and Syria was attacking the children
[27:07] of
[27:08] Israel so joash knew one thing that as
[27:11] long as they had the prophet in the
[27:16] land amen the victory was
[27:19] guaranteed so now we heard that elishah
[27:21] was
[27:23] sick so he went to
[27:25] Elijah amen started crying crying and
[27:29] then Elisha gave him this
[27:31] word he said that take the bow and the
[27:35] arrows and open the window
[27:39] Eastward and I want you to shoot that
[27:42] that
[27:43] arrow and he did exactly that so here we
[27:47] see that the arrow represent
[27:50] Victory represent amen an arrow
[27:53] represent Victory FL represent so uh uh
[27:57] Syria was attacking the children of
[28:00] Israel and no way by themselves they
[28:02] could have won that
[28:04] battle so they needed the hand of the
[28:08] Lord so he went to the
[28:10] prophet amen as we all know that the
[28:12] prophet is a mouth of
[28:14] God Amen the prophet gave him the
[28:17] word he gave him the
[28:20] word sh that
[28:22] arrow and he shooting the
[28:25] arrow you will have it's the arrow of
[28:27] the of Deliverance
[28:29] of Amen it sh the area of deliverance
[28:32] from from
[28:34] Syria amen that will be your
[28:37] Victory amen and he did exactly
[28:40] that so when if we go down to the verse
[28:43] 16
[28:45] 18 amen Verse 18 the Bible says that and
[28:48] he said take the arrows and he took
[28:54] them amen and he said
[28:58] he said unto the king of
[28:59] Israel Smite upon the
[29:02] ground and he smed Thrice and
[29:06] stayed amen and at verse 19 the Bible
[29:09] said that and the man of God was rough
[29:11] with
[29:14] him and said thou should us have smitten
[29:17] five or six
[29:20] times then H has thou smitten Syria till
[29:23] thou has uh consumed
[29:26] it
[29:29] whereas now thou shall Smite Syria by
[29:33] th amen so I want us to focus on Verse
[29:36] 18 here for a
[29:38] bit amen Elijah told uh uh joash to take
[29:43] the
[29:45] arrows amen notice that the arrows is
[29:47] the victory represent the
[29:50] victory so Elisha told him he said that
[29:52] go take the go take the
[29:55] arrows amen which means that he had
[29:57] plenty of arrows
[29:59] next am man Elisha did not specify how
[30:02] many arrows he had to
[30:05] take amen by by joash by the lack of
[30:09] faith amen he only took
[30:12] three so elishah was
[30:15] frustrated Amen in other words I'm
[30:17] giving you the opportunity to have as
[30:19] many victories as you
[30:22] want amen but you only choose three
[30:26] victories amen I'm giving you the
[30:28] opportunity to have as many victories as
[30:30] you
[30:31] want but you only choose
[30:34] three amen the the arrows as I said
[30:36] represent the the the victories FL
[30:40] represent thect amen and the Elisha when
[30:43] Elisha pointed out to joah she had many
[30:47] of Amen if we can't bring it to our time
[30:50] now amen arrows we can take it as me
[30:54] make it represent
[30:56] promises
[30:58] amen and all the promises we sing it
[31:00] that every promise in the book is
[31:03] mine amen so the victories of your
[31:06] life amen depends on how many promises
[31:09] you choose to
[31:11] take amen the Bible has plenty of
[31:15] promises amen from Genesis to
[31:18] Revelation amen you'll see promises
[31:20] after
[31:21] promises amen but your Victory amen it
[31:24] depends on which promise you want to
[31:26] take
[31:28] amen if you're sick amen there's a
[31:31] promise about healing amen he says that
[31:33] I am your
[31:35] healer that's a good thing with God Amen
[31:38] he's not only our
[31:40] doctor amen but he's also our healer
[31:43] amen because the doctor cannot always
[31:46] heal amen the doctor can tell you what's
[31:50] wrong amen but when you go to a
[31:53] Healer amen that's
[31:55] guaranteed amen that's healing
[31:58] 100% amen amen if you need
[32:01] something amen he's our Jehovah Gyra
[32:05] amen so the victories of your
[32:07] life amen depends on how many Arrow you
[32:10] choose to
[32:11] take amen but I don't know about you
[32:14] tonight amen I'm about to take all the
[32:17] arrows that's
[32:18] available amen I'm not only taking three
[32:22] amen I'm not only taking
[32:24] four amen but I'm taking as many as I
[32:28] can Amen to last for my entire
[32:33] life because we know that the life of a
[32:37] Christian amen is filled of B is full of
[32:40] battles amen every day we have to fight
[32:43] de demons amen every day we have to go
[32:46] through
[32:47] trials amen so you need to have your
[32:50] backpack
[32:51] ready amen with all the promises of God
[32:55] Amen the prophet here says
[32:58] he says that brother when you got that
[33:01] baptism of the Holy
[33:03] Ghost it takes that old temper out of
[33:07] you it puts you it puts you on the dress
[33:10] and makes you like it makes you act like
[33:12] a
[33:14] lady amen it'll make you quit
[33:19] smoking it'll make you quit
[33:22] drinking it'll make you quit
[33:25] lying it make quit
[33:28] stealing amen and everything
[33:31] else brother when you've got the baptism
[33:34] of the Holy
[33:35] Ghost it separates you amen it delivers
[33:40] you from the things of the
[33:42] world Amen he makes you love
[33:45] God Amen he makes you go to
[33:48] church amen he makes you worship
[33:51] himen it makes you tell your neighbor
[33:53] about
[33:55] it he makes you
[33:57] above
[33:59] sin that's that's a gift of the holy
[34:02] spirit amen because the Holy Spirit has
[34:06] benefit amen look at Moses amen when he
[34:09] went to uh uh uh the burning
[34:15] bush the burning bush had some benefits
[34:19] with Moses was
[34:21] scared amen he was afraid of his he was
[34:24] afraid he was going to
[34:25] die but when went to the
[34:28] burning he had a promise amen that God
[34:31] will always be with
[34:33] him that God will always be with
[34:36] him and he left that
[34:38] place being a changed
[34:41] man man with
[34:43] confidence amen you see the
[34:46] disciples 120 up in the upper
[34:50] room they went to that room when they
[34:52] went to that
[34:53] room they were all scared amen Peter was
[34:57] afraid to go
[34:59] out John was
[35:01] afraid all of them they were afraid of
[35:03] the
[35:03] Romans but when the Holy Spirit
[35:07] came he brought the benefits of the Holy
[35:10] Spirit he gave them the
[35:13] confidence amen they started telling
[35:15] that to their
[35:17] neighbors that changed their Liv amen
[35:21] that's the benefit of the holy
[35:23] spirit amen and they did not structure
[35:25] they did not stru
[35:27] short of that of that
[35:30] promise they took it
[35:32] all they took all the
[35:35] benefits and the promise it was given to
[35:38] us that promise of the holy spirit amen
[35:42] is for you for your children and for
[35:45] your
[35:46] children even now you still can go and
[35:51] CLA even now you still can go and get
[35:55] that victory
[35:57] amen God is asking you to do one
[36:00] thing only one
[36:02] thing take the
[36:04] arrows and
[36:06] smite amen he says take the arrows he
[36:10] didn't say how many
[36:12] arrows he didn't tell you what to
[36:16] Smite notice that when Elisha told joash
[36:19] to Smite to take the arand and
[36:23] smart Elisha didn't give
[36:27] a specific uh uh
[36:32] Target amen he just says smart It On The
[36:37] Ground whatever it it's on the
[36:40] ground you'll have the
[36:42] victory amen and with the word of God we
[36:46] supposed to rise above

[41:59] Genesis uh
[42:05] 18:14 the Lord was speaking to Abraham
[42:07] and
[42:10] Sarah and said is anything too hard for
[42:13] the
[42:16] Lord you can take your
[42:19] seats is anything too hard for the
[42:25] Lord God is the only
[42:28] one who asks you a
[42:32] question not because he does not know
[42:34] the
[42:36] answer but he asks you a question trying
[42:39] to tell you
[42:42] something when he asked Abraham and
[42:44] Sarah is anything too hard for the
[42:49] lord it's not because God did not
[42:53] know but he was trying to tell Abraham
[42:55] something
[42:58] that I am able to do
[43:00] it hallelujah hallelujah that question
[43:03] had a suggested
[43:06] answer so I have a question for you this
[43:10] morning is is anything too hard for the
[43:15] Lord oh I didn't get enough
[43:18] ANW anything too hard for the
[43:22] Lord hallelujah hallelujah I can even
[43:25] finish preaching on
[43:28] that because we know our Lord is more
[43:30] than
[43:33] able do what he said he will do in his
[43:36] word hallelujah hallelujah and the Bible
[43:39] says at the time
[43:42] appointed I will return unto
[43:45] thee according to the time of
[43:48] life and Sarah shall have a
[43:52] son I'm speaking on the time
[43:55] appointed
[43:56] hallelujah hallelujah Sarah was Barren
[43:59] sah medically it was impossible for her
[44:02] to Bear
[44:05] children and it was
[44:08] impossible but God
[44:10] said is there anything too hard for
[44:14] me hallelujah hallelujah and you as the
[44:17] Seed of
[44:18] Abraham God is asking you the same
[44:21] thing is anything too hard for the
[44:25] Lord
[44:26] at the time
[44:28] appointed not appointed by
[44:31] man but appointed by God
[44:35] himself he says I will come
[44:37] back and I will give you my
[44:40] promise so like our brother was
[44:43] preaching all those promises in the
[44:47] Bible they are not too hard for the
[44:50] Lord at the appointed
[44:53] time he will come and he will give you
[44:56] those
[44:56] bless Hallelujah we all know Sarah was
[45:00] Barren for 25
[45:03] years doctor say you cannot bear
[45:05] children after that
[45:08] age but God as he
[45:11] promised he came at the time
[45:14] appointed turned it
[45:17] around it was the
[45:20] Paradox something that's unheard
[45:24] of Hallelujah he Miracle working
[45:27] God if he did it for
[45:30] Sarah he can do it for
[45:32] you at the time
[45:35] appointed God will come for your
[45:38] resue
[45:40] Hallelujah in John chapter 5 and verse
[45:44] 6 you can put it on the
[45:47] projector Jesus was
[45:50] walking and he was passing by the pool
[45:53] of
[45:54] Bethesda
[45:56] and there was a lame
[45:58] man who had been lame for 38
[46:03] years he was lame for 38
[46:07] years and Jesus and Jesus came to
[46:11] him he was not the worst case
[46:16] situation but Grace located
[46:19] him hallelujah how many can say I'm not
[46:23] the
[46:24] worst God predestinated
[46:29] me the Bible said when Jesus saw him
[46:34] lie and knew that he had been now in a
[46:36] long time in that
[46:39] case he said unto him will thou be made
[46:44] whole Jesus is asking him a
[46:47] question he is not asking because he
[46:50] does not
[46:52] know it's not because Jesus was not sure
[46:55] if the could
[46:58] walk but he was trying to tell him
[47:01] something he was giving him an
[47:05] answer that there is a
[47:08] possibility that you can be made
[47:11] whole all you have to do is rise up and
[47:15] walk it was his appointed
[47:19] time other people were waiting for the
[47:21] angel to
[47:23] come cuz that that's the time everyone
[47:25] was
[47:27] expecting but his time
[47:30] appointed came by the master
[47:33] himself Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus
[47:36] Christ was the promises walking in
[47:40] flesh amen he know this was Jehovah
[47:44] Rafa God who Health all my
[47:48] diseases as soon as he walked on the
[47:51] scene he just had to rise up and
[47:54] walk I can tell you can do the same
[47:57] thing this
[47:58] morning you can rise up and
[48:00] walk it is your appointed
[48:03] time why because Jesus is
[48:06] here the word of God tells wherever two
[48:08] or three are
[48:10] gaed he will be
[48:12] there so I can guarantee you and tell
[48:16] you for sure that in this
[48:20] meeting Jesus is

[48:26] time rise up and
[48:29] walk hallelujah hallelujah that's all
[48:31] you got to
[48:32] do there anything too hard for the
[48:36] Lord amen amen when God asks you a
[48:41] question it's not because he does not
[48:44] know he's trying to tell you
[48:47] something he's trying to tell you you
[48:49] can come out of that
[48:52] predicament you can come out of that
[48:54] addiction
[48:56] you can come out of that
[48:58] disease you just have to rise up and
[49:02] walk hallelujah hallelujah we know in
[49:05] the Book of
[49:06] Ezekiel God came to
[49:09] Ezekiel and he says son of man can these
[49:14] Dry Bones
[49:17] live it's not
[49:19] because it's not because God was not
[49:21] sure if those Dry Bones could
[49:24] live
[49:26] he had the
[49:27] answer but he was trying to tell Ezekiel
[49:32] something just speak the
[49:34] word hallelujah hallelujah and when
[49:37] Ezekiel got
[49:39] up he spoke the
[49:41] word and those
[49:44] bones one arm was over
[49:47] there the leg was over
[49:50] there but because he answered the
[49:53] question God had asked him
[49:56] those bones got
[49:58] together and there was revived a mighty
[50:02] [Music]
[50:04] Army because he was answering God's
[50:08] question at the appointed time and there
[50:11] was a mighty Army that rose up for the
[50:13] Living
[50:14] God tonight I'm looking at the army of
[50:17] the Living
[50:20] God hallelujah God does not do things H
[50:24] hazard
[50:27] he he has his own
[50:30] timing everything is on
[50:33] time it might not be on your
[50:36] time but it is it is on his time because
[50:41] his timing is
[50:42] perfect hallelujah hallelujah Mary and
[50:46] Martha they wanted Jesus to come
[50:50] early but he says no he was waiting at
[50:54] for the appointed time
[50:57] because if he had come on their
[50:59] time they were just going to get a
[51:01] healing
[51:04] testimony but Jesus wanted a
[51:06] resurrection
[51:08] testimony when he comes he has better
[51:13] results say Lord I know your
[51:16] timing might not be good to
[51:19] me but I know it's good for
[51:22] me hallelujah hallelujah he came four
[51:25] days is
[51:26] late and he says Lazarus come
[51:29] forth it does not matter where Lazarus
[51:32] was he had to come back why because he
[51:35] heard the voice of the
[51:37] master hallelujah hallelujah 4 days late
[51:40] on our
[51:42] time but at the time appointed by
[51:46] God he was right on
[51:49] time hallelujah hallelujah huj I'll go
[51:52] to Hab habac
[51:54] 2:3
[51:58] says for the vision is yet for an
[52:00] appointed
[52:04] time but at the end it shall
[52:09] speak and not
[52:12] lie though it
[52:14] t wait for it because it surely
[52:19] come it will not
[52:22] t this baffled me for a moment
[52:26] the Bible is saying it will
[52:29] T but it will not
[52:32] t it will t on your
[52:35] timing but on God's
[52:38] timing it will not t hallelujah
[52:41] hallelujah that's why we got to trust
[52:43] God's
[52:44] timing CU at the appointed
[52:47] time he will not
[52:50] delay he will come exactly when you need
[52:54] him so of all his
[52:57] promises all the promises in the book
[53:01] they're coming to me right on
[53:03] time hallelujah hallelujah and the
[53:06] prophet of God tells us that the Seed of
[53:10] Abraham walks the exact same Christian
[53:13] Journey as
[53:16] Abraham so if God asked Abraham a
[53:20] question trying to tell him
[53:24] something you the same question as
[53:27] well trying to tell you
[53:30] something that at the appointed
[53:33] time there is nothing too hard for
[53:37] me and he gave Father Abraham a
[53:40] promise that your children will be in
[53:43] bondage for 400
[53:46] years hallelujah hallelujah and when the
[53:48] 400 years were
[53:52] up that was the time appointed
[53:56] amen it was time for
[53:58] deliverance nothing could stop them from
[54:01] coming
[54:02] out at the time Pharaoh was the
[54:05] superpower of the whole
[54:08] world but Pharaoh could not stop the
[54:10] plan of
[54:12] God when God promises he has to come
[54:16] through so you got to take your
[54:19] Bible look at all the
[54:21] promises and say Lord I'm calling you on
[54:24] your promises
[54:27] because you are a covenant keeping
[54:33] God hallelujah Pharaoh tried to stop
[54:37] them he changed his mind multiple
[54:41] times but that could not stop
[54:44] them the Red Sea was right in front of
[54:47] them but that could not stop
[54:50] theman and Kora were they
[54:54] doubting
[54:56] but that could not stop them amen do we
[54:59] have any children of Abraham this
[55:01] morning Hallelujah I have a word of you
[55:04] for you this
[55:05] morning nothing can stop
[55:07] you there is not enough demons in hell
[55:10] to

[55:15] for your life is
[55:17] come has to
[55:20] happen there is power in the time
[55:24] appointed God himself is doing
[55:27] it hallelujah hallelujah no force can
[55:30] stop
[55:32] it even yourself you cannot stop
[55:35] it because when God is determined to do
[55:38] it he will do it for you hallelujah
[55:42] hallelujah when your promotion is
[55:44] supposed to
[55:45] come not even your boss can stop
[55:49] it because God's timing no one can stop
[55:53] it that you've been
[55:56] fighting no enemy can defeat
[56:00] you why because God's timing is
[56:03] perfect that breakthrough you've been
[56:06] wanting know that there is no Devils
[56:09] enough to stop
[56:10] it Hallelujah though it might
[56:14] T it will not t why because it's on

[58:26] word for the servants who

[58:33] messages and I thank the Lord for having
[58:35] them with
[58:42] me so God richly bless
[58:46] you as we are stand we were
[58:53] standing
[58:57] we're going to open our Bible in the
[58:58] book of Philippians the first
[59:01] chapter verse
[59:04] six if I'm not
[59:23] mistaken
[59:25] phili somebody already on on the
[59:29] verse okay
[59:33] pH chapter Philippians chapter 1 verse 6
[59:37] says being confident of this very thing
[59:40] that he which has begun a good work in
[59:42] you will perform it until the day of
[59:44] Jesus Christ
[59:47] amen
[59:50] uh I have a little issue it issue with
[59:53] my computer
[1:00:09] we we stopped the
[1:00:11] time the time should be working right
[1:00:18] now I have it on my phone that someone
[1:00:20] can give you my
[1:00:23] phone
[1:00:28] okay so during this
[1:00:31] time let's say a word of
[1:00:34] prayer our heavenly
[1:00:38] father we want to thank you for the time
[1:00:40] you give you grant to
[1:00:43] us we want to bring your
[1:00:46] word we want to submit all Spirits in
[1:00:49] this under your
[1:00:53] spirit
[1:00:55] so Lord we we think that you already you
[1:00:57] are here before
[1:00:59] us sermons of the preachers that preach
[1:01:02] before
[1:01:04] me I believe that you're going to do
[1:01:06] things in the name of Jesus Christ Our
[1:01:08] God amen
[1:01:12] amen so with the scripture that we just
[1:01:15] read phili Philippians chapter first
[1:01:23] chapter
[1:01:25] it was the six verse
[1:01:33] six
[1:01:37] okay the Lord didn't want me to preach
[1:01:39] with my
[1:01:45] laptop now if you noticed
[1:01:48] here with the scripture that we just
[1:01:52] read I just want you to notice
[1:01:56] something that the Bible says it's Paul
[1:01:59] that
[1:02:01] say he says that I'm
[1:02:06] confident that he which has begun a good
[1:02:08] work in
[1:02:11] you will perform it until the day of
[1:02:13] Jesus
[1:02:16] Christ and so I was very
[1:02:20] happy when I could already read Paul
[1:02:23] saying
[1:02:25] that I'm
[1:02:28] persuaded that the one who started the
[1:02:31] good
[1:02:31] work I want to get your attention
[1:02:35] here that the work that it's
[1:02:39] about is not an
[1:02:44] evil he said that I'm
[1:02:48] confident that he which has begun the
[1:02:50] good work in you will perform it
[1:02:55] I want to remind you this
[1:02:57] morning every one of you this
[1:03:00] morning that you're not the work
[1:03:03] of the work of God
[1:03:07] himself when God starts
[1:03:11] something what God starts is always
[1:03:15] good God cannot start something
[1:03:18] bad that's why Paul
[1:03:21] said
[1:03:23] confident
[1:03:26] started the good work in
[1:03:29] you he will perform
[1:03:31] it this
[1:03:33] morning this night I want to remind you
[1:03:38] that because you are the work of
[1:03:42] God cannot start
[1:03:45] something stop it
[1:03:49] Midway he will try to make you perfect
[1:03:52] my yes my brothers
[1:03:55] I can remember in the
[1:03:57] beginning in the Book of
[1:03:59] Genesis when God was created the Bible
[1:04:03] says that in the
[1:04:06] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:04:08] earth and the Bible
[1:04:11] says that the Earth was without
[1:04:15] form the Earth did not have a
[1:04:19] form God gave a form to the
[1:04:22] Earth because what God
[1:04:26] he will make it
[1:04:28] perfect if you are the work of
[1:04:32] God God will certainly make you
[1:04:36] perfect there's nothing that can stop
[1:04:38] God the Bible
[1:04:41] says even
[1:04:44] unbelief never stop
[1:04:46] God that's why this
[1:04:49] morning I want to tell
[1:04:52] somebody because God started
[1:04:55] God will perform
[1:04:57] it yes
[1:05:00] my the Earth was without a
[1:05:02] form it didn't have a
[1:05:05] form God gave a form to the
[1:05:10] Earth if you go back in the Book of
[1:05:13] Genesis you can see verse four of
[1:05:16] chapter
[1:05:17] one God start to
[1:05:20] create give a form to the Earth
[1:05:25] so God starts little by
[1:05:27] little I want you to
[1:05:30] notice the first thing that God
[1:05:32] cre was the God
[1:05:35] say let the light
[1:05:39] be and when the light
[1:05:44] appeared God separated the lights from
[1:05:46] the
[1:05:47] darkness I want you to pay
[1:05:50] attention God created
[1:05:53] first
[1:05:56] separated God starts
[1:05:58] something he starts a
[1:06:02] work he the one that's going to make
[1:06:04] that that work
[1:06:06] perfect verse five he
[1:06:09] says it says and God
[1:06:12] called and the Darkness he called
[1:06:15] night evening and the morning were the
[1:06:18] first day it was the first day and God
[1:06:23] said let there be a firmament in the
[1:06:25] midst of the
[1:06:27] waters and that let it
[1:06:30] divide let that firmament
[1:06:34] separat there's the creation of
[1:06:36] something and then there's a
[1:06:41] separation and God called
[1:06:44] that there was a day there was
[1:06:49] night said let the waters that's in
[1:06:51] heaven gather
[1:06:52] together and that the dry
[1:06:54] land and that was
[1:06:57] that and God called the dry land
[1:07:02] Earth and he called the the the
[1:07:04] gathering
[1:07:06] together and God saw that it was
[1:07:09] good and God
[1:07:11] started that the Earth produced fruits
[1:07:14] and you
[1:07:16] understood that there was a
[1:07:20] process before the Earth was without a
[1:07:22] form
[1:07:25] and God had the
[1:07:27] ability to say that the
[1:07:30] Earth everything that that that is on
[1:07:32] Earth
[1:07:34] today but God did not do
[1:07:37] so he
[1:07:40] starts he starts by giving a form to
[1:07:42] Earth little by
[1:07:46] little I don't know if you
[1:07:49] understand yes
[1:07:51] mys that's why the Prophet
[1:07:57] tell that that that the Bible says the
[1:08:00] God created the Earth in six
[1:08:03] days and I told you that
[1:08:07] God in his in his God in
[1:08:10] his in his quality of being
[1:08:13] God he could have just said let the
[1:08:17] Earth let the heaven let this
[1:08:20] be all should have just happened just
[1:08:22] right there
[1:08:24] but God did not do
[1:08:26] it he started doing it little by
[1:08:30] little why I want to tell someone this
[1:08:32] morning
[1:08:33] tonight that because you are a work of
[1:08:37] God God will perform you little by
[1:08:42] little because it said
[1:08:47] first that the one who started this good
[1:08:51] work the work is not a bad
[1:08:54] it's a good
[1:08:55] work because the one who started is the
[1:08:59] good
[1:09:00] god yes my
[1:09:02] brothers the work is
[1:09:04] good I want to say something
[1:09:07] here that's why
[1:09:11] today God cannot give you everything at
[1:09:15] at
[1:09:16] once he gives it to you little by
[1:09:19] little God
[1:09:22] says money of the world
[1:09:25] today it's going to be happy on
[1:09:28] you I'm going to give it to you little
[1:09:30] by little yes my
[1:09:32] brothers that's
[1:09:34] why God says the Bible
[1:09:40] says for your
[1:09:42] fa your
[1:09:45] Fai
[1:09:47] Temperance temp
[1:09:51] patience God is able to give you all
[1:09:53] those at once but he
[1:09:56] says I cannot do it at
[1:09:59] once that's why he
[1:10:03] says he says I'm going to work on your
[1:10:06] I'm going to remove your life tomorrow I
[1:10:10] come I'm going to work on
[1:10:13] your then he
[1:10:15] REM then
[1:10:17] tomor and he says I'm going to remove
[1:10:20] your God has the
[1:10:22] ability
[1:10:24] those things at
[1:10:26] once but he perfects you little by
[1:10:30] little little by
[1:10:32] little that today it's this tomorrow he
[1:10:36] removes another thing so the problem is
[1:10:40] don't condemn
[1:10:42] me
[1:10:44] remember that I'm the work of
[1:10:47] God and because I'm the work of God the
[1:10:50] Bible has already said that the work is
[1:10:53] good
[1:10:55] it's to God to make me
[1:10:57] perfect I just commit myself into
[1:11:00] his it's to him to make me
[1:11:03] perfect I remember there was a
[1:11:08] day a French
[1:11:11] Emperor his name was
[1:11:15] Char he had to Feast with his generals
[1:11:19] one he had to peace with all the mil all

[1:11:31] national
[1:11:33] anthem the crown of the king
[1:11:37] fell and everyone was all the soldiers
[1:11:40] were they
[1:11:42] standing and it fell because of of the
[1:11:45] wind but because the soldiers were
[1:11:47] standing like this no one could
[1:11:51] move but there was just one of the
[1:11:54] soldiers who stood
[1:11:56] up and who went to grab the crown of
[1:12:01] the back on the on the head of the

[1:12:33] standing now the generals who are
[1:12:35] standing by him they said but your

[1:12:46] him it's not you that makes me a
[1:12:49] general the Emperor who

[1:13:41] you perfect no matter what you are yes
[1:13:45] my
[1:13:46] brothers I want to tell someone this
[1:13:49] morning that God
[1:13:52] needs someone he can
[1:13:55] trust someone who can command himself
[1:13:58] totally to
[1:14:00] God to become a
[1:14:04] prisoner that's why I want to
[1:14:06] say God wants us to be
[1:14:09] prisoners prisoners of the word
[1:14:12] prisoners of
[1:14:14] Christ prisoners of this
[1:14:17] message I don't want my
[1:14:20] brothers that we be prisoners of people
[1:14:24] I'm not going to be a prisoner of
[1:14:26] somebody I want you
[1:14:29] tonight not be prisoner of somebody else
[1:14:33] if you can be a
[1:14:34] prisoner be a prisoner of the word so I
[1:14:39] want in
[1:14:42] 2024 that you just become a prisoner of
[1:14:44] the
[1:14:45] word I'm going to read the prophets and
[1:14:48] we're going to
[1:14:50] finish don't look at your mistakes
[1:14:54] don't look at your
[1:14:56] mistakes God will perfect you little by
[1:14:59] little
[1:15:02] remember when they called the adulterous
[1:15:06] woman and all the accusers were
[1:15:09] there brought that woman to Jesus and
[1:15:12] they told her master we caught her she
[1:15:17] was committing
[1:15:19] adultery and they had stones with them
[1:15:22] to Stone that
[1:15:25] woman but the Lord
[1:15:28] just and he started writing
[1:15:34] on the Lord started writing with his
[1:15:37] finger he was just writing with his
[1:15:40] finger brother
[1:15:45] says the people who they were accusing
[1:15:48] this
[1:15:50] woman everyone came to see what what was
[1:15:52] being written floor but what
[1:15:57] happened while everyone was looking at
[1:15:59] what was being written on the
[1:16:02] floor he was riding the life of everyone
[1:16:04] that Wasing
[1:16:06] there that's why when they work they got
[1:16:09] there they started looking at what was
[1:16:12] everyone was looking at his life they
[1:16:14] said no I can't Stone this woman and
[1:16:17] then the other one
[1:16:19] came he saw that the master was writing
[1:16:22] his own sin
[1:16:24] say oh no this woman is innocent because
[1:16:26] you
[1:16:28] know they were they were themselves
[1:16:32] un because when they catch a woman
[1:16:37] in with a man that she's committing
[1:16:40] adultery
[1:16:41] with but they did not catch the man they
[1:16:44] were
[1:16:47] unjust and the Lord saw gave them the
[1:16:51] seed that they saw themselves I'm going
[1:16:53] to
[1:16:54] finish I'm just taking the little
[1:16:56] minutes that they left for
[1:16:58] me so as they saw this everyone left and
[1:17:04] now the Lord stood up and he said
[1:17:07] woman where your
[1:17:10] accusers and then she said they all left
[1:17:13] and then he
[1:17:14] said because they they did not condemn
[1:17:17] you me as well I will no longer condemn
[1:17:21] you go and sin no
[1:17:27] more in
[1:17:29] 202 we will walk saying go and S no

[1:17:39] mistakes that was a
[1:17:41] sister Bruce she was Sister
[1:17:44] Bruce she was there with the
[1:17:47] prophet she was asking
[1:17:50] herself she said
[1:17:52] brother I'm asking myself
[1:17:55] question if I have the Holy
[1:17:58] Ghost because I make a lot of

[1:32:17] tremendous to
[1:32:20] me
[1:32:22] to know that the word of God cannot
[1:32:25] fail and to know that he that begun the
[1:32:28] good work in US is faithful to complete
[1:32:34] it and just like I heard on the other
[1:32:38] day it's not something that I must
[1:32:41] complete but the responsibility is on
[1:32:45] God he that begun the good work in
[1:32:49] US you is faithful to
[1:32:52] complet Hallelujah he is the master
[1:32:56] builder but one thing the word of God is
[1:32:59] given
[1:33:00] us it has given us an
[1:33:03] assurance and that Assurance is that God
[1:33:06] cannot
[1:33:07] lie Hallelujah and we understand that
[1:33:11] every word that God has spoken
[1:33:14] Hallelujah will never come back to him
[1:33:18] void
[1:33:20] Hallelujah not in Genesis
[1:33:24] 3:15 God talked God
[1:33:27] spoke about the
[1:33:30] serpent and about the woman's
[1:33:32] seed and how the serpent will bruise the
[1:33:36] heel of the woman's
[1:33:39] seed and and how the woman's seed will
[1:33:43] bruise the Serpent's heel excuse me
[1:33:47] Hallelujah my question is did he not do
[1:33:51] it
[1:33:53] Hallelujah God in the book of
[1:33:56] Isaiah 9
[1:33:58] and6 he propes that Christ would
[1:34:01] come did he not
[1:34:04] come Hallelujah in Malachi 4
[1:34:09] and he prophesied about
[1:34:13] Elijah did he not
[1:34:15] come Hallelujah and nothing could stop
[1:34:19] those prophecies
[1:34:22] Hallelujah so we understand by the grace
[1:34:24] of
[1:34:25] God no matter what people thought about
[1:34:28] the prophet of God no matter what they
[1:34:32] thought about William
[1:34:35] brand they could not stop the work of
[1:34:39] God hallelujah and just as Paul
[1:34:43] said I have finished the course
[1:34:47] Hallelujah I have kept the faith and
[1:34:49] their life lay for me
[1:34:52] a Crown of Life hallel and I'll say it
[1:34:56] like
[1:34:57] this
[1:34:59] Malachi never left anything
[1:35:03] undone everything that he was supposed
[1:35:06] to do he did it not by his own strength
[1:35:12] but nothing could stop the
[1:35:14] prophecy that was prophesied of him to
[1:35:18] do to do it Hallelujah
[1:35:22] not by
[1:35:25] power my spirit say the
[1:35:27] Lord hallelujah so I want to encourage
[1:35:31] you
[1:35:32] tonight everything God
[1:35:35] prophesied the pride of Jesus
[1:35:37] [Music]
[1:35:39] Christ she will she'll do it not by her
[1:35:44] own
[1:35:46] strength of
[1:35:48] theh
[1:35:50] Hallelujah judment watera
[1:35:53] tonight what are you looking at
[1:35:57] Hallelujah I'm not just
[1:35:59] looking at the horrors that is to come
[1:36:02] on the
[1:36:02] Earth but I'm looking at a people that
[1:36:06] have been chosen by God to rock the
[1:36:10] world before she leaves is that right
[1:36:14] the Bible says amen that the Holy Ghost
[1:36:18] is the power of the Bride and he said in
[1:36:22] the word of God hallelujah that he shall
[1:36:25] give you what power after which the Holy
[1:36:29] Ghost has come upon
[1:36:30] you Hallelujah and brother Bram
[1:36:33] described the power Hallelujah as the
[1:36:36] authority of God hallelujah is that
[1:36:41] right the only thing the bride has to
[1:36:45] separate herself
[1:36:47] from is
[1:36:50] Iniquity
[1:36:53] iniquity when you know to do good and
[1:36:57] you won't do it y'all hear me it's not
[1:37:01] the signs and the
[1:37:02] wonders because those who came to
[1:37:05] Jesus said Lord have not we cast out
[1:37:09] Devils
[1:37:10] your have we not
[1:37:13] prophesied in your name the only thing
[1:37:16] God had against
[1:37:18] them was that they refused to to
[1:37:23] separate themselves from
[1:37:26] iniquity because
[1:37:28] iniquity
[1:37:30] literally destroy your
[1:37:34] relationship Hallelujah so much so he
[1:37:38] said depart from
[1:37:40] me I do not know
[1:37:43] you why because you work
[1:37:48] iniquity oh come on y'all getting quiet
[1:37:52] but you see you can't be a a bride as I
[1:37:56] said this morning without
[1:37:59] scar Hallelujah you got to have Battle
[1:38:03] Scars Hallelujah the power of God is
[1:38:06] here today to give us overcoming power
[1:38:11] Hallelujah is that right we sing that
[1:38:15] song I'm not a slave to sin anymore
[1:38:19] hallelujah it's more than
[1:38:21] song Hallelujah it must be
[1:38:25] action Hallelujah sin as Paul says have
[1:38:30] no more dominion over
[1:38:32] us hallelujah is that correct and
[1:38:35] brother Bram said sin in itself it's not
[1:38:40] drinking it's not smoking it's not lying
[1:38:44] it's not
[1:38:46] gambling sin is
[1:38:49] unbelief and un Bel leads to
[1:38:53] what he said you do not do the wrong
[1:38:58] things Hallelujah he said you only do
[1:39:01] wrong
[1:39:03] things because you don't
[1:39:07] believe hallelujah amen what's going to
[1:39:10] happen to this
[1:39:11] group Hallelujah y'all better hear what
[1:39:14] I'm
[1:39:15] saying because
[1:39:17] 24
[1:39:19] 2024 is going to unravel
[1:39:22] something we we don't know what's coming
[1:39:25] but if you got any kind of anointing
[1:39:27] with you you know something is
[1:39:31] brewing something is
[1:39:34] coming and you better be ready for it
[1:39:38] Hallelujah but how can you be
[1:39:41] ready except you
[1:39:43] believe the Prophecies of the
[1:39:47] book
[1:39:48] Hallelujah except you believe
[1:39:51] brother Pam said he said we are amateur
[1:39:56] gods are
[1:39:58] Messiah we are
[1:40:01] omnipotent Hallelujah we are one with
[1:40:04] God and when you adapt that into your
[1:40:08] soul you understand the
[1:40:11] word is said no weapon form against
[1:40:14] [Music]
[1:40:17] me formed against
[1:40:19] you
[1:40:22] so whatever comes in
[1:40:25] 2024 I already got my mind made
[1:40:29] up Hallelujah I know and understand that
[1:40:34] nothing can defeat
[1:40:36] me y'all better hear me nothing can
[1:40:39] defeat you not because of your power
[1:40:45] because not because you say
[1:40:48] so because he say so
[1:40:52] Hallelujah
[1:40:54] Glory the truth of the matter is or my
[1:40:57] question is with this
[1:41:01] generation or with these group this
[1:41:03] group of people the people that is
[1:41:06] labeled as
[1:41:07] bride will they turn from their
[1:41:12] iniquity Hallelujah because you've got
[1:41:15] to
[1:41:16] realize that these people who came up
[1:41:18] before
[1:41:19] God
[1:41:21] had some kind of
[1:41:24] fellowship with God they knew they
[1:41:28] didn't heal on their
[1:41:29] own Hallelujah there was no Supernatural
[1:41:33] about
[1:41:34] them but whatever it
[1:41:37] was they thought they
[1:41:40] had God on the
[1:41:43] inside see you don't know him until he's
[1:41:46] on the
[1:41:47] inside Hallelujah you know of him
[1:41:52] because he can be with you he can be
[1:41:55] above you but the goal of God is to be
[1:41:58] in
[1:41:59] you is when he is in you you then know
[1:42:03] him is that right he said in that day
[1:42:08] you know that I'm in the father father
[1:42:10] is in me and I am in
[1:42:13] you
[1:42:15] Hallelujah do I have to be congales for
[1:42:17] you to praise
[1:42:19] God
[1:42:24] okay y'all listening I I guess some of
[1:42:26] y'all not understanding you're doing
[1:42:28] what I
[1:42:30] did I got it now will they turn from
[1:42:34] their
[1:42:36] iniquity he was bruised for our
[1:42:40] iniquities that means we we were he
[1:42:44] conquered our
[1:42:46] iniquity yall hear what I'm saying we
[1:42:49] have no excuse
[1:42:51] because he
[1:42:53] conquered our
[1:42:54] [Music]
[1:42:55] iniquities Hallelujah but we find out
[1:42:58] that the people are having a hard time
[1:43:01] to turn from
[1:43:03] it
[1:43:05] Hallelujah glory to God I'm going to
[1:43:08] tell you one of your greatest enemy our
[1:43:10] greatest
[1:43:14] enemy is our
[1:43:17] tongue
[1:43:19] am amen if you can tame the
[1:43:22] tongue the Bible say you can tame the
[1:43:24] whole
[1:43:26] [Music]
[1:43:27] body is that right it somehow it is so
[1:43:32] and we don't know that's
[1:43:34] iniquity gossiping and backbiting and oh
[1:43:37] I'm getting into your lives right
[1:43:39] now don't you know that's
[1:43:41] iniquity cuz the Holy Ghost will tell
[1:43:43] you not to do
[1:43:45] it
[1:43:48] do help us Lord you must conquer
[1:43:53] that that has to be
[1:43:56] conquered Hallelujah and I want to say
[1:43:59] to this
[1:44:00] church if we could conquer that we will
[1:44:04] be an invincible
[1:44:08] Army Hallelujah we already got
[1:44:11] everything else in place we just don't
[1:44:14] have this in
[1:44:16] place Hallelujah but the Holy Ghost come
[1:44:21] to conquer that that
[1:44:23] iniquity
[1:44:25] Hallelujah my question
[1:44:27] is these people waited too late to
[1:44:33] change and I hope we can
[1:44:36] change we need a true
[1:44:40] repentance we need to turn from those
[1:44:43] things and look toward the mercies and
[1:44:46] grace of
[1:44:48] God hallelujah I've got to be serious I
[1:44:53] have to hit you in these
[1:44:55] areas if we're going to have a a
[1:44:59] successful
[1:45:02] 2024 we must go
[1:45:05] beyond what we were in
[1:45:10] 2023
[1:45:11] Hallelujah is that the
[1:45:13] truth even as a child you find that
[1:45:17] every child
[1:45:19] normally
[1:45:21] grows every
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:24] year very seldom do they remain the same
[1:45:28] height and they keep growing until they
[1:45:32] come to that place of
[1:45:35] maturity when their DNA
[1:45:38] says that's
[1:45:41] it right I wanted to be six
[1:45:47] something but my my DNA says uhuh
[1:45:52] 511 is all you going get
[1:45:55] 5 and then when you get
[1:45:57] older you shrink like I
[1:46:01] do I'm now
[1:46:04] 510 and I'm like Lord hold it right
[1:46:08] there you see something happens that
[1:46:12] changes every
[1:46:15] year Hallelujah and it's something that
[1:46:18] you know being the person I am I'm the
[1:46:22] shortest of all my
[1:46:24] brothers all of them are 63 and six you
[1:46:28] know and I'm you
[1:46:31] still but but my point is this no matter
[1:46:35] how I wish I was
[1:46:37] 63 God had already
[1:46:41] ordained me to be 511 5 y'all hear what
[1:46:46] I'm saying so let me say it like this
[1:46:50] every everybody's
[1:46:52] maturity is always a different
[1:46:56] level you understand me we all grow at a
[1:47:00] different pace as our brother said we
[1:47:03] all we all come to our
[1:47:06] maturity as our brother said but how do
[1:47:09] you know when you're born
[1:47:12] again when your Nature has been
[1:47:17] Chang hallelujah amen see the Deep
[1:47:20] things are more important to the
[1:47:24] people that's how people think
[1:47:27] nowadays if it's
[1:47:29] deep it's bride
[1:47:31] food and I don't say it's
[1:47:34] not but if you don't apply
[1:47:38] it you understand me if you don't take
[1:47:41] it
[1:47:42] in if you don't eat
[1:47:45] it if you don't digest
[1:47:48] it then it's of no value value to
[1:47:51] you Hallelujah is that right because
[1:47:56] when Israel ate
[1:47:59] meat didn't appreciate
[1:48:02] it and what happened to them the meat
[1:48:05] that was meant to feed
[1:48:07] them made them
[1:48:12] sick you understand me but natural food
[1:48:16] and
[1:48:17] meat is not here to make you sick
[1:48:20] this message is not to make you
[1:48:23] sick this message came to make you
[1:48:26] strong it came to make you
[1:48:29] powerful it came to change you it came
[1:48:33] to bring you into the image of
[1:48:36] God hallelujah it was not a message out
[1:48:39] of
[1:48:40] season a message in
[1:48:43] season
[1:48:45] hallah come on somebody you
[1:48:49] say
[1:48:51] oh I get so tired of going to
[1:48:54] church if you do you're
[1:48:57] sick oh the preacher is so
[1:49:02] boring if that's so you're
[1:49:04] sick Hallelujah because if the preacher
[1:49:09] is a true man of God and he's preaching
[1:49:12] the
[1:49:13] word you saying I am bored by Jesus
[1:49:18] Christ h
[1:49:21] all right somebody to come to church to
[1:49:24] some people is like a social
[1:49:27] club mingle with each
[1:49:29] other but there is no love for each
[1:49:33] other what happened to the family altar
[1:49:37] is
[1:49:38] gone and the inspiration of
[1:49:41] science taking
[1:49:43] place Hallelujah there's no
[1:49:47] concern that there's no gifts
[1:49:51] no power in the church they're not
[1:49:54] concerned about their
[1:49:57] souls well if I'm
[1:50:00] bride well if I'm not
[1:50:02] bride well Hallelujah but that's not the
[1:50:07] bride Hallelujah see they are not
[1:50:11] concerned that the church seems to like
[1:50:14] the fire of the Holy
[1:50:16] Ghost Hallelujah let me tell you
[1:50:19] something one thing about a change
[1:50:22] nature brother said it like this no
[1:50:25] matter what country you come
[1:50:28] from no matter what your nationality
[1:50:31] is when you get the Holy
[1:50:34] Ghost you act the same
[1:50:37] way they acted on the day of
[1:50:42] Pentecost Hallelujah it doesn't matter
[1:50:46] if a dog is brown if he's black if he's
[1:50:50] porka dot all dogs act
[1:50:55] alike why because they have a dog's
[1:50:58] nature Hallelujah and all the true
[1:51:01] children of
[1:51:03] God the same
[1:51:05] way Hallelujah because they're born of
[1:51:09] God
[1:51:12] hallelujah thank the Lord just hold on
[1:51:15] for a minute I'm
[1:51:16] coming but I had to go here first
[1:51:24] Hallelujah the
[1:51:26] church is moving into uh
[1:51:31] lukewarmness and sometimes it's
[1:51:34] cold where is the
[1:51:37] fire sincerity where is it the love of
[1:51:41] God where is
[1:51:43] it the love of God and his people where
[1:51:46] are they hallelujah what is it
[1:51:51] it is what the Watchman was looking
[1:51:55] at and the Watchman for the
[1:51:58] hour was a
[1:52:01] prophet and brother Bram warned us about
[1:52:04] it he told us that gross Darkness would
[1:52:07] be upon the
[1:52:09] people will cover the
[1:52:11] Earth and so what are we doing we're
[1:52:15] literally
[1:52:16] fighting and Waring against
[1:52:20] the darkness of this
[1:52:23] world Hallelujah coming from the message
[1:52:27] watch word of the night paragraph
[1:52:31] 37
[1:52:32] Hallelujah and God liken his Prophet to
[1:52:38] Eagle they are the Watchmen that climb
[1:52:43] higher so that they can see further
[1:52:46] off and their eyes were made spiritual
[1:52:49] so that they can
[1:52:52] see the approaching
[1:52:55] dangers and God had set Isaiah
[1:52:58] up to warn the people that there was
[1:53:01] approaching
[1:53:05] danger and they wouldn't listen to
[1:53:08] him I've got this
[1:53:11] feeling that we hear the voice of the
[1:53:15] Prophet listening to
[1:53:17] him hallelujah amen and
[1:53:20] today God still has
[1:53:23] Eagles or
[1:53:25] Messengers or men on the
[1:53:28] towel CL up in the
[1:53:32] spirit beyond all the
[1:53:35] mechanism and all the atomic
[1:53:38] bombs and the scientific
[1:53:42] research he has men who is special
[1:53:45] designed for that
[1:53:48] purpose
[1:53:50] the ramper of of
[1:53:52] Calvary in the name of the Lord
[1:53:55] Jesus and stands on the top of the
[1:53:58] Cross and can send send the message
[1:54:06] back their spiritual sight is far
[1:54:10] greater than the pr in the
[1:54:14] temple beyond the ordinary
[1:54:18] man a Walk of
[1:54:21] Life for they are special
[1:54:24] designed for the duties that God had
[1:54:26] called them
[1:54:30] to it pays us to take
[1:54:33] heed when we hear the things that
[1:54:37] approaching want to say this Higher

[2:03:44] ages Tower
[2:03:47] Watchers he that's the Lord Jesus
[2:03:52] himself and this day that we are living

[2:04:01] there until when he was right in the
[2:04:07] shadow he spoke more of his second
[2:04:12] coming of his coming going

[2:04:23] away prophesied of the things that would
[2:04:25] be would take place in this
[2:04:27] [Music]
[2:04:29] day he knew that he must be

[2:04:38] the innocent for the
[2:04:40] [Music]
[2:04:41] guilty he Rise Again from the
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:04:46] grave Hallelujah he knew knew there was
[2:04:50] no power that could hold him in the

[2:04:57] will not suffer my Holy One to seek
[2:05:01] corruption leave soul in
[2:05:04] hell and there was no power that could
[2:05:07] break that

[2:05:31] that father had
[2:05:33] said the father was able to keep his
[2:05:36] word hallelujah I don't know about you
[2:05:40] but right now I feel like flying away
[2:05:44] Hallelujah
[2:05:45] therefore his his great heart
[2:05:50] that was within him which was the Throne
[2:05:53] of
[2:05:54] God in his heart he knew that these
[2:05:58] great trying
[2:06:00] times come to prove All
[2:06:03] Nations
[2:06:05] people hallelu these trying times are
[2:06:09] here to prove you Hallelujah to see what
[2:06:13] you really are
[2:06:15] hallelujah oh my you love the
[2:06:20] Lord so so
[2:06:23] therefore he
[2:06:25] knew that the question
[2:06:27] laid not whether he would rise
[2:06:31] again or whether he would be crucified
[2:06:35] according to the
[2:06:36] scripture or not whether he was Ascend
[2:06:39] on
[2:06:40] high and the Holy Spirit would
[2:06:42] come but the question was this is it
[2:06:47] would there be faith
[2:06:50] left at his
[2:06:53] coming where is
[2:06:56] Faith where is Faith
[2:06:59] come by hearing the word of
[2:07:03] God that was his
[2:07:05] question will there be faith on
[2:07:09] Earth I
[2:07:11] come
[2:07:13] hallelujah hallelujah will he find
[2:07:17] people
[2:07:19] believes his
[2:07:21] word
[2:07:23] hallelujah we are the
[2:07:26] Believers Hallelujah is that right he
[2:07:30] said then I will change now for just a
[2:07:35] moment just want to make sure I'm not
[2:07:37] reading the same thing over yeah we did
[2:07:41] you love the Lord I did Hallelujah
[2:07:44] Isaiah
[2:07:45] 55 I'm going close in just a bit
[2:07:49] [Music]
[2:07:51] we love
[2:07:53] God we're blessed
[2:07:55] people the message is the
[2:07:59] message and if we could just take this
[2:08:02] message and stop just you know the Lord
[2:08:05] showed me the other day because I try to
[2:08:08] listen to a message every
[2:08:11] day and the Lord asked me a
[2:08:15] question are you listening to learn
[2:08:20] or are you listening to love
[2:08:25] me what do we
[2:08:27] do most of us are listening to learn
[2:08:30] what brother Adam
[2:08:32] said what he
[2:08:35] said gave was a
[2:08:37] word that would cause us to love
[2:08:42] God right it's like when Rebecca when
[2:08:45] Isaac when uh
[2:08:47] Ela
[2:08:48] found
[2:08:50] Rebecca he he not only gave her
[2:08:53] gifts but no doubt he must have preached
[2:08:55] to her from from the time she left her
[2:08:58] father's
[2:08:59] house the time she she saw him in the
[2:09:03] field and by the time he he she arrived
[2:09:08] there brother said it was love at first
[2:09:12] sight so the message come to increase
[2:09:16] our love for God
[2:09:19] because if we love
[2:09:21] him we'll keep his
[2:09:27] Commandments Isaiah

[2:18:46] remedy amen amen the blood of Jesus
[2:18:51] Christ
[2:18:53] amen amen
[2:18:56] am you know when the seals were
[2:19:00] open when the seals were open and the
[2:19:03] word of God was
[2:19:05] unveiled and we heard Perfection
[2:19:08] Perfection
[2:19:10] Perfection but we fail to
[2:19:12] see who the perfector
[2:19:16] was and for so many
[2:19:19] years we tried to be
[2:19:22] perfect and the more we
[2:19:24] tried the more we
[2:19:28] failed because there's no
[2:19:30] way you can perfect
[2:19:33] yourself cuz first of all you don't even
[2:19:35] know what Perfection
[2:19:38] is
[2:19:40] him he the begun the good work in
[2:19:43] you what you don't understand is that
[2:19:47] God is judging
[2:19:49] you and he's judging you on your
[2:19:52] compassion he's judging you on the love
[2:19:55] that you should have for your brothers
[2:19:57] and
[2:19:58] sisters judging you according to the
[2:20:01] mercies that you supposed to give one
[2:20:04] another
[2:20:06] Hallelujah that's the
[2:20:09] truth because he said as he
[2:20:12] is so are we in this
[2:20:15] world you understand me and right now
[2:20:20] he's given out Grace he's given out
[2:20:23] Mercy he's out love and if you can't do
[2:20:27] that you'll never reach
[2:20:32] Perfection God put you to the
[2:20:36] test he puts me to the test and I'm
[2:20:40] saying this this coming
[2:20:43] year if you not watch
[2:20:46] for you're going to find a lot of things
[2:20:49] going
[2:20:51] wrong and if you don't find yourself in
[2:20:55] the love of
[2:20:57] God the little love you
[2:21:00] have will wax
[2:21:05] cold you love the Lord you got to fight
[2:21:09] there's a lot of things I want to say
[2:21:11] but let's
[2:21:16] stand
[2:21:24] I always thought to
[2:21:27] myself that
[2:21:30] Peter wrote those
[2:21:33] books and he wrote about the statute of
[2:21:36] a perfect
[2:21:37] [Music]
[2:21:39] man CU if anybody had
[2:21:42] [Music]
[2:21:43] issues Peter
[2:21:46] did
[2:21:48] when it came
[2:21:50] to his
[2:21:54] temper he had
[2:21:58] one when it came to
[2:22:02] Prejudice he were
[2:22:05] Prejudice but God took that out of
[2:22:08] him you understand me when we come to
[2:22:12] God we got all kinds of
[2:22:15] stuff and issues
[2:22:18] but the Holy
[2:22:19] Ghost is here to sanctify
[2:22:22] us when
[2:22:25] Isaiah saw the Holiness of
[2:22:28] God he said Wars
[2:22:30] me I am a man of unclean
[2:22:34] lips dwell among a
[2:22:37] people with unclean
[2:22:40] lips he was right there to
[2:22:43] repent he was right there to see his
[2:22:46] failures
[2:22:48] and when God see he said he said when
[2:22:51] King oziah
[2:22:53] died I saw the Lord see when you see God
[2:22:58] and you see his
[2:23:00] Holiness you will
[2:23:03] strive to have that Holiness in
[2:23:06] you Hallelujah you'll recognize just how
[2:23:10] sinful you
[2:23:11] are without the blood of Jesus
[2:23:14] Christ we have no chance at all
[2:23:18] Hallelujah it takes the blood to justify
[2:23:21] us it takes the blood of Jesus to
[2:23:24] sanctify
[2:23:25] us it takes the blood of Jesus to
[2:23:28] baptize us with the Holy
[2:23:30] Ghost it takes the life of the blood to
[2:23:33] bring us to
[2:23:36] Perfection people of God we've got the
[2:23:38] greatest word on
[2:23:40] Earth the greatest opportunity
[2:23:44] ever for
[2:23:46] mankind
[2:23:48] what are you going to do with
[2:23:50] it are you going to turn from
[2:23:53] it are you going to reject
[2:23:55] it are you just going to just walk and
[2:23:58] continue to walk in your your your walk
[2:24:00] of uh of
[2:24:04] iniquity but God has an appointed
[2:24:09] time at some point in
[2:24:12] time those men who were doing great
[2:24:15] works with God
[2:24:18] was cut
[2:24:19] off and they were left in their
[2:24:22] iniquity and they still thought they
[2:24:25] were in the favor of
[2:24:27] God so when they approached
[2:24:30] God it was a rude awakening for
[2:24:33] them because they had they had Pride
[2:24:37] themselves to be worthy of eternal
[2:24:41] life and God said unto
[2:24:44] them I don't even know you
[2:24:48] surely it's not what we
[2:24:51] want we
[2:24:53] believe that God knew
[2:24:55] us before the foundation of the
[2:24:59] world we
[2:25:01] believe that we were with him we were in
[2:25:05] him before the foundation of the
[2:25:08] world and as a as a a servant of the
[2:25:12] Lord I'm saying if you truly believe
[2:25:15] this then you need to ask
[2:25:18] God to remove all the
[2:25:22] iniquity remove the sin remove the
[2:25:26] iniquity lord I can't do it you're the
[2:25:30] master
[2:25:32] builder as our brother said if you
[2:25:36] ask he'll give it to you if you
[2:25:40] seek you should find and if you
[2:25:44] knock he said he'll open the door
[2:25:48] the word cannot be
[2:25:50] broken cannot come back
[2:25:53] void God did not come to send us to
[2:25:58] Hell God came to make
[2:26:01] provision of us to make Heaven our home
[2:26:05] y'all believe that let me say this in
[2:26:08] before we
[2:26:09] pray there's not one person in
[2:26:12] here that's greater than the
[2:26:15] other
[2:26:17] the same
[2:26:18] blood it takes to redeem
[2:26:21] you it's the same blood it takes to
[2:26:23] redeem
[2:26:25] me I was a sinner born in
[2:26:28] sin here speaking
[2:26:32] lies that's
[2:26:34] reality but one thing I didn't
[2:26:38] know until this message
[2:26:41] came I belong to
[2:26:44] God and you belong to God
[2:26:48] and we need to stop letting the devil
[2:26:50] just do us any kind of
[2:26:54] way we need to be helpers one of another
[2:26:58] love one another that's how they know
[2:27:01] that the love of God is in you because
[2:27:03] of the love that you have one
[2:27:07] toward hallelujah hallelujah you love

[2:36:59] Corinthians the 11th
[2:37:01] chapter beginning at the 23rd
[2:37:06] verse now I feel real drunk
[2:37:11] tonight drunk off of the Holy Ghost
[2:37:14] though
[2:37:19] for I have received of the
[2:37:21] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[2:37:24] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[2:37:27] in which he was betrayed took
[2:37:32] bread and when he had given
[2:37:35] thanks he break it and
[2:37:37] said take eat this is my body which is
[2:37:42] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[2:37:44] me
[2:37:49] after the same manner also he took the

[2:37:57] New Testament in my blood this do ye as
[2:38:01] often as you drink of it and remance of

[2:38:10] and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's
[2:38:13] death till he
[2:38:14] come
[2:38:21] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:38:23] and drink this cup of the Lord
[2:38:25] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:38:28] and blood of the
[2:38:33] [Music]
[2:38:36] Lord but let a man examine himself and

[3:35:47] you it's been about two
[3:35:53] weeks that P Pastor is is preaching us
[3:35:57] on
[3:36:04] influence and that's why after those
[3:36:07] sermons I prayed in a certain
[3:36:09] way
[3:36:16] and and today when I woke up this
[3:36:17] morning I have a I have a a
[3:36:20] neighbor she has two
[3:36:23] boys she lives alone just with her two
[3:36:29] boys and in the morning she woke up and
[3:36:32] she asked me can you can you take my
[3:36:34] kids to to church with
[3:36:38] you and I told I told her well we don't
[3:36:41] have church this
[3:36:43] morning we have a watch night at the at
[3:36:45] the
[3:36:53] mo and then she asked and then she asked
[3:36:55] me I'm going to ask you
[3:37:03] something then she asked me what if um
[3:37:06] what if just one of those days I go
[3:37:08] outside and I have an accident and I
[3:37:09] pass away
[3:37:14] then she asked me if that were to happen
[3:37:16] would you be able to take my kids and
[3:37:18] just stay with
[3:37:21] them because I want because she said I
[3:37:24] want my kids to be
[3:37:28] saved and she asked me to that I want
[3:37:31] you to start talking to my kids about
[3:37:33] Jesus
[3:37:39] Christ
[3:37:41] now it really touched me because I was
[3:37:43] my impression was that in America people
[3:37:45] are individualistic they live on their
[3:37:52] own and I was asking myself I don't even
[3:37:54] know this woman like
[3:38:02] that it's just that she saw us come out
[3:38:04] of the house and she saw that we have
[3:38:06] something
[3:38:08] special and then she told me
[3:38:14] Then I then I told her well there's no
[3:38:15] problem with doing that but then I asked
[3:38:17] her is there any is everything all
[3:38:24] right then she she told me I just I'm
[3:38:27] just trying to prepare the future
[3:38:28] because I don't know what can happen to
[3:38:35] me then I told her I have boys with me I
[3:38:38] don't have a problem adding those kids
[3:38:40] to among to to my to my own
[3:38:42] kids and then she told
[3:38:49] me then she told me uh she has a s that
[3:38:52] she has a sister that lives that doesn't
[3:38:55] live with her here but she knows her
[3:38:56] bank
[3:38:58] [Music]
[3:39:03] account then she told me okay I'm going
[3:39:06] to give you all my bank accounts so you
[3:39:08] can start taking care of my kids when
[3:39:09] I'm not there when I'm no longer
[3:39:19] here then she then she said I'm going to
[3:39:22] give you the keys of my house so so that
[3:39:24] you know so that I instructed my kids to
[3:39:26] to know where they need to go when

[3:39:36] emergency my testimony is that you just
[3:39:39] have to know that everything you do

[3:39:46] you you may think that no one is
[3:39:49] watching you but someone is always
