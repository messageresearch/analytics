the naturals you always hear of those people that say those things like oh i wish i could i wish i could win the lottery that all things in the natural are taken care of amen he's gone to prepare a place for you baby i'm good to see everyone here this morning great to be back here in the house of the lord to hear the songs of praise amen or let's just uh get right into the word of the lord we're going to turn our bibles to the book of revelations from there we'll go right over to psalms 139 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i'll confess his name before my father and before the angels look even now from there let's go right over to psalm 139 what i like about that scripture there in revelations apocalypse is sure psalms 139 we'll read from the 14th verse and it says i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made how marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well. my substance was not hid from the when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which are con which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them information how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh god how great is the sum of them if i should count them they are more in number than the sand and when i awake i am still with me [Music] how precious are thy thoughts under me yoga amenities heavenly father we know that you are the almighty god you're the one that has drawn drawn us to this place this morning you called us here from before the foundation of the world and gave us a position lord to sit in your presence underneath that position that we stand right now full faith lord this position [Music] amen i imagine if any of us right now you know sometimes we don't maybe think too much of ourselves in those positions you know it can be where you start getting your eyes on the natural things it's a sad thing when a christian begins to forget who they are but you know even christians can get into those places but it's a time when you get into those places where you begin to uh get focused on the natural instead of the supernatural moment of nature [Music] he went down from his mind started to get away from the battlefield when the enemy was coming against him when he was surrounded by the enemy the enemy not only wanted to take his life the position to be the shepherd over the whole country of israel [Music] and if david could go and travel down the road of the the enemy's to catch the revelation of what the enemy wanted to do i would have left him in a discouraged state it would have left him in a stay of discouragement but you know as he began to uh leave the enemy's thoughts behind me and begin to get on the the king's highway and began to think the thoughts that god was thinking began to get his mind on heavenly places what the desire of god was from before the foundation of the world secretly deserved they began to say here in psalms 139 lord you knew me before i was even born my arms and my legs begin to come together i mean that you had a thought about me before the foundation of the world it began to set his feet even though he was in the midst of a battle don't come back even though he was in the midst of whatever the enemy had for him they began to set his feet on a uh on a position on a rock of faith [Music] they begin to lift up his head and think heavenly thoughts and he's like lord you saw it all from before the foundation of the world you knew me before i was even created they said lord how great is the sum of your thoughts 70 years old or 80 years old i don't recall but the sum of god's thoughts went way beyond just those 80 years for god had position for david that went far beyond just that natural element of time that he was given position how great were the some of god's thoughts they went from before the foundation of the world even when david was in battle when he was crying out when he was in trouble his entire body was prophesying of our lord and savior jesus christ the troubles and the trials that he were he was going through we're prophesying over the coming of the messiah even coming on down to the prophet jonah illustrated the prophet jonas when he is wondering lord why am i such a disobedient prophet why can't i be more like enoch lord come in why can't i be more like elijah because if i'd come eli jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and nights jesus said so shall i be in the belly of the earth these three days a night thoughts towards us are greater than we can even imagine some of us we go through our trials in our younger years trials of deep desires trials of sickness trials of wanderings doubts about this and doubts about that but as we begin to stop and get our minds off the things [Music] those thoughts doesn't just have to do with our age here at 14 years old or 25 years old oh as we come to the message of this hour it was revealed to us about our theophanies about how god had a head of being that was laid up for us but after that day of trying and testing is over the test that one of these days in a moment in a twinkling of an eye will be changed we'll leave this body behind [Music] it's not just an old man's dream it's not just you know as men on this earth as they get older and they begin to realize that they're there there's more years behind them than there are ahead of them when they begin to ponder you know when will their last day on the earth be there is no there is no death you know it's just your it's a revelation it's a transformation transformation your eyes are open as this fleshly veil peels away there's been many ages where they they they didn't know what day is coming was coming they didn't know the age that they were living the end of the entire the gentile age is coming to an end that ages is passing away now remember the lord jesus christ he was the word the word came to the earth to be tested satan said to him if thou be the son of god you are the situation call these stones to be bred transformers if you are the messiah come off that cross if you saved others why can't you save yourself it situates the senior percussionist all these tests were given to him but he had something in his mind that was greater than all the traps the enemy could put before him the will the word persevere will the word persevere will the word overcome that's good a resurrection took place we call them miracles because they happened in the beyond the natural nature but in reality as the we the bride is supposed to live in the supernatural reality those things are merit called miracles to those who live in the naturals but to those that live in the supernatural amen jesus sit the disciples out two by two jesus christ he told them go every city you go into ali heal the sick jerusalem don't take extra food or any of that just demons of don't just rejoice because the devils are subject unto you but rejoice rejoice because your names were written this is the lamb's book before the foundation of the world see there's going to be many that partake of the power of the world to come but we can't trust in that the only thing you can trust in the song is when god reveals unto you who you are and that your name was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world when god brings that revelation to you put your faith upon that blessing run in that response he is the author of all the works that we have done in the holy ghost and when he has when he writes a book he writes that book according to a vision that he has [Music] when an author has a vision he has an inspiration there's something that has come into his mind and when that's wherever that is that's on his mind he he begins to catch the vision of it he he wants to communicate that to other people and as he wants to communicate that to other people he says i'm going to write a book about this is he first has to decide what the beginning of the story is going to be and what the ending of the story is going to be and it all has to be according to the vision that he had and as he expands his he expands his vision and he breaks that vision up into chapters and he decides what the end of the story is going to be and what the beginning of the story's going to be and then he takes the chapters he begins to expand them out and expand each chapter is developing a specific thought that is according to the vision and when he is done writing the book the sum of those chapters expresses the vision that he had in his mind all of these chapters are the sum of his thoughts what should the title of this book and he be to come up with something that's going to describe the entire book in just a couple words something that can fit on the cover just just a few words and in those few words will be a description of the whole book definition and our god before the foundation of the world you know he had a vision in his mind he had a thought he had an expression something that he he wanted to get down and write it out in a book but as he began to think about his book he had something in his mind that he wanted to express yeah and he began to break out in the chapters we would call them ages all the ages of this creation every age when you put them all together is expressing one thing making something like screaming and god we've got his expression down in this book and he began to split it up into chapters they had to decide what the title of this book ought to be [Music] he decided that the the to describe this book in just one expression just a few words that would describe this book that he was writing just now if there's anybody that's going to have the right thought of what life is correct it's going to be god the creator the creator because the life that he was writing wasn't just the life that you and i think about machinery is operating the machine the gears are spinning the pistons are going up and down the electrical signals are going all along the wires back and forth and we say that car is alive because it's expressing what the engineers at ford we're even so maybe a a man who's won the lottery yeah a normal chia gang his bank account says he can go and do whatever he wants to do now i have the wife oh now i can go and do anything that i have in my mind to do but you know that man's mind is limited that man's mind has an end his thoughts are finite fini that man's thoughts have an ending point finale a man can get the news that you have just won the lottery enough it can receive the message that your bank account is full and running over and the next day you can get the news that you've been diagnosed with cancer the life how many great church meetings you've been in they participate how many times you've seen the holy spirit moving on the congregation how much your bank account has combined when you get that if you get that message your life is drawing to an end [Music] it'll change your priorities right quickly and all of a sudden you begin to wonder i've seen god he wrote a book you like evil but when i open up that book it's not just this big flowerly story this is storm flurry it's not just this big deep uh [Music] because when god decided that he was going to write the book about his own life how shall i describe the life of jehovah how great this has been how can we see who he is these are the names that are going to express my life here on the earth was to express the everlasting life of the lord jesus christ and you if your name is upon that nate upon that book you have come to this earth to reveal jesus christ to the world oh not just to be to bring a sunday school lesson to the people [Music] but when you yourself are filled with the holy ghost you are a living testimony a living testimony of the messiah upon the earth oh you're not just just uh like this say uh jesus christ is in my heart when we heard about that in the sunday school growing up we didn't know what that meant but jesus christ the one that came and died for us the one that came and walked the shores of galilee in the sick only raising the dead as he stood there as the scroll of isaiah 61 was handed to him that one day in the tabernacle he said the spirit of the lord god is upon me because he has anointed me this day to preach the gospel to the poor to proclaim liberty to the captives to them that are bound let the blind might see let's go let's lay my walk that's good and the spirit of the lord god is upon me right now the precious the disciples were standing there his feet began to lose their gravitational bounds gravitation to go up into the heavens and all of a sudden a couple angels appeared why are you standing there looking at the sky why why are you looking up in the sky what are you doing standing here go and do all that he told you to do every word that he said will take place in the upper room what do you tell him to do don't wait in that upper room until you be endured with power from on high ali jesus christ the son of the living god returned to the earth and a pillar of fire anointed the disciples and they went forth preaching the gospel and the spirit of the lord god was upon him because he had anointed and from there the spirit has blazed the trail throughout history there's been two trails yeah yeah you do trail the serpent yeah you we've seen what it does we've seen what that trail did through the opening of the seals we've seen that trail of the serpent all throughout all the ages we can identify his acts see that spirit even as it moved to the churches but the holy spirit has also left a trail and as that spirit has moved through the church ages he is left a trail to every single name that was upon that book and when that spirit blaze a trail came across saint paul's life when that trail hit the woman and that trail went on down through all the church ages finding every name that was upon that book of life so that they could express the life of the lord jesus christ there will be a bride that will stand up it's been prophesied it has to happen in luther's day there was a bride that stood up because the trail the holy spirit struck them their names were upon the last book of life the message of luther was revealed to them and they rose up and then the holy spirit hit those that had the names upon the land's book of life that great missionary age as their missionaries went all over the world in the road themselves expressing the message of john wesley john wesley and the days of pentecost fire went all the way around the world a short quick work street in 1906 and in california um the holy spirit struck their age all around the world a pentecostal restoration of the gifts began to rise up women began to express exactly what was written for them in that age exactly but as the end of the age draws to a close become lafayette the layout of cna is coming to an end the end of the revelation of laodicea i got some more things i want to show you john [Music] a prophet by the name of brother branham william branham came on the scene separate yourself the holy spirit's blaze in a trail there will be a perfect faith they'll be restored to the bride of christ a rapturing faith they'll draw you away and draw you up here and as the spirit begins to hit those who have their name upon the land's book of life if you've ever caught that revelation if christ if the lord jesus christ has ever knocked at your heart's door he is knocking to bring you to this position as a position whatever was written in the land's book of life since the seals have been unveiled since the seals have been revealed as brother brown says your book of divorcement was stripped away everything that that was preventing you has been stripped away the abstract title deed the letters and through the message it was revealed that the that the title deed had been researched all the way back and to find out that these liens that were put on your life or put there under a false pretext because the blood has been shed to restore you back to the way you were before the fall that the bride of christ has been given a position that we were whether we have committed those sins are put back on the head upon satan where they came from the title deed of your sins have been researched back temptation that was brought to you we found out that's what the author had in his mind before the foundation of the world but now as we get to the revelation at the end of the book we're living in the book of revelations we begin to realize what the end of the story is all about and we have become to express that life amen amen my brother bran preached that message the rapture he said if eternal life was in you then you have an attribute and that attribute came from god himself is it a tribute the [Music] to overcome all of it to reveal the life of jesus christ to the world and all the power of heaven is behind you so [Music] jeremiah and the babylon oh a man can have like we said in the beginning a man can be revealed to him that he's won the lottery they can be revealed to him that he's dying of cancer you know into a natural man that would be a sad state of affairs but a spiritual man spiritually doesn't matter what the enemy brings to you [Music] because we take god's first thought we are the people that take god's first thought as the only thought that matters to us so it doesn't matter what the thought of the enemy is towards you every see what god's thoughts are about the matter voyage god's thought about things and [Music] and the word bride has come to prevail if you take the word and nothing but the words [Music] right now for my life [Music] the author was thinking before the foundation of the all the spirits you'll overcome all the spirits that were in that in that uh euphrates river [Music] overcome all the spirits that went to hollywood they'll overcome all the spirits of laodicean and that's what was written of my attribute before the foundation of the world because there will be a bride in the last days before the rapture like like saint paul jumping off of his donkey [Music] that same trail is now knocked if you can't believe that's a big job to be given brother brandon was given the job to bring that revelation to the last day bride of jesus christ and sometimes i'll think about how people and they're rejecting the message he began to see that pillar of fire moving through the audience and he he knew that he could see it but sometimes the people couldn't see it and so sometimes he would say those things do you see that why not probably 100 of the people couldn't see it you know what brother brown would say he didn't say uh look a little harder he didn't say uh just widen your eyes a little bit he didn't say look over there and just squint and see if you can see it it's say somebody believed just now they say the power of the lord is present the lord is here the seniority how does he get the the lord and the bride together he could see the pillar of fire there he could see the bride right here and his position was to get the two together it's a position how could he do it somebody believed just now somebody start praying start believing and there would be someone in the audience maybe burdened with some type of a sickness or a burden somehow you know and they would maybe they couldn't see that pillar of fire but it didn't matter they would to the same savior that they always pray and all of a sudden when someone began believing someone would start trusting in the lord i would start praying lord let it be me let me be the one all sudden that pillar of fire began to move [Music] [Music] has not left us but just like those disciples they were standing there with their lord and savior jesus christ it's just been resurrected and they saw him as he began to leave up off the earth as the cloud began covering them they weren't sure what to do but they just stood up there and the angels why are you standing here the same thing for the bride of christ we say oh brother abraham's god where's the pillar of fire where's the revealing of jesus christ striking people on the path on the journey continuing and that you could realize who you are and to walk forward in the power of the holy ghost expecting the power of god to be upon you david stand there in the midst of the battle said lord thou prepare us a table for me in the presence of my enemies and right here in the midst of laodicea that message is here to get you from where you've been to prepare you for a rapture because it was written for you in the lamb's book of life amen amen amen in hebrews chapter three you don't worship he said you see they couldn't they could the children of israel could not enter into that promised land because of unbelief acoustic credibility and it's the same thing this day it's not that they don't listen to enough tapes don't come to church enough so if you can stand up [Music] the musicians would come okay the musicians i want to read this quote from who do you say this is in 1964 just notice how few recognize them to be the anointed word of that day [Music] see god in the beginning being infinite i knowed all things from the beginning and the only thing that these things are is the display of his attributes [Music] [Music] or ever will be in heaven [Music] [Music] [Music] if you can't believe [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] god didn't come just to deliver us [Music] it's perfect [Music] well it's exactly what you're supposed to be in the age that you're living in [Music] and [Music] that's what we've come to do is [Music] [Music] will she hold on to the word or not oh [Music] [Music] same girl he didn't call me to be sick but to be healed he didn't call me to be broken down but be delivered he called me to be a christian to be a mystic to the world to live in heavenly places in christ jesus christ said oh get that gloomy unbelieving spirit away from you [Music] it's hiding that real thing from you say that in the prayer line sometimes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that was just something that satan had placed on his life but it wasn't so from the beginning and so are the trials and tribulations in your life [Music] the blood of christ will strip those things away from you [Music] remove them as far as the east is from the west valley [Music] [Music] to resurrect these attributes to be exactly what god has called for us to be right not to be broken down not to be weary not to be unto us according to thy word lord overcomers in this last day that enoch bride that was prophesied to be here he will come to pass she will be [Music] [Music] [Music] upon us in the name of jesus christ [Music] in the name of jesus [Music] and then that very belief that stands in front of us [Music] [Music] on that word that was spoken amen [Music] the word amen the word that came by the prophet of malachi 4 came to tell us that we are god's attributes to take us back where we came from amen let us sing this song can't you see why i'm happy oh can't you see why i'm so happy [Music] that was [Music] can't you see [Applause] why i'm so happy of the lord [Music] can't you see oh can't you see [Applause] why i'm so happy word of the lord [Music] can't you see can't you see why i am so happy [Music] i've accepted the word of the lord [Music] can't you see can't you see why i'm so happy [Music] oh i've accepted the word of the lord by the prophet amen that ought to make us happy
