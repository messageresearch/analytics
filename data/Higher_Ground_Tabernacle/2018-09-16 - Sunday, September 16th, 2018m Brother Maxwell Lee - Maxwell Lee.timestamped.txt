[22:53] Lord we want to thank you Lord and as we
[22:55] journey this way even in your word Lord
[22:58] Paul says how unsearchable riches Lord
[23:00] but Lord you want to thank thee for such
[23:03] a privilege that you have given unto us
[23:05] Lord that we could come Lord and you can
[23:08] make known Lord a mystery of your will
[23:10] there are people today Lord we pray that
[23:13] you may help us Lord as we come before
[23:15] your throne of grace Lord to sit at your
[23:17] feet to receive from you Lord we give
[23:20] you all the praise and the glory in
[23:22] Jesus name Amen
[23:25] praise God you may be seated we're so
[23:28] happy and thankful this morning to be in
[23:30] the house of God yet are not a privilege
[23:34] that we can come to recognize that Jesus
[23:38] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[23:41] forever and he never changes his mind
[23:43] about his word and you know it's such a
[23:46] privilege to pass this way once again
[23:49] with believers of like precious fate and
[23:52] you know we believe that we are on the
[23:55] final stretch this is going home time
[23:57] and the world has become you know in our
[24:01] reach because of technology what you may
[24:04] say a small you know global village and
[24:07] we tongue God the Word of God is being
[24:09] fulfilled it is all that we are living
[24:11] in and we are subjects to his kingdom
[24:14] and we truly believe
[24:16] the end is near and the world not is
[24:18] falling apart has already fallen apart
[24:21] but a Bride of Christ Jesus hallelujah
[24:23] is coming to that position to know her
[24:27] place and you know when we can know our
[24:29] place in Christ Jesus there is nothing
[24:31] that is happening around us we'll have a
[24:33] hole upon us because we are not mindful
[24:36] of what is happening around us because
[24:37] scripture has to be fulfilled but what
[24:40] is happening inside of us that is what
[24:42] really counts because the Word of God
[24:44] says that let not your heart be troubled
[24:46] believe in God believe also in me
[24:49] in my father's house are many mansions
[24:50] if it were not so I would have told you
[24:54] that he's gone to prepare a place for us
[24:56] that's where
[25:54] [Music]
[26:05] praise God so you know these these
[26:08] devices everything that man made how you
[26:11] know are always little problems and
[26:13] things but we tell God for grace this
[26:15] morning
[26:16] praise God so I was telling you you know
[26:19] we really had a wonderful time of
[26:22] fellowship many years ago in Trinidad
[26:24] where we have met in a convention and
[26:27] you know I really you know get a like
[26:31] him because of the boldness that he has
[26:33] and you know because when God speak we
[26:35] have to speak you know because that is
[26:37] what is lacking because we got a real
[26:39] recognize that you must know your
[26:41] position you must know your calling it
[26:43] doesn't matter where you go God is God
[26:45] Alleluia and the life that you're living
[26:48] I I never believed in what you may say
[26:50] in creating a first impression the world
[26:53] we see whenever you go wherever you go
[26:56] you must create a good first impression
[26:58] but that's the way of the world you know
[27:00] because when you do that what do you
[27:02] have leave behind if you try to impress
[27:05] or impersonate Gordon call us to be
[27:08] impersonators when God call us to be
[27:10] humble to believe his word hallelujah
[27:12] God call us to be honest and that is
[27:15] what we tongue God for and the best life
[27:17] or the best way that we could live is to
[27:20] live a honest Christian life by the
[27:23] grace of God and you know we truly
[27:25] believe in our that you are living in
[27:27] that God is moving amongst his people
[27:30] for his God so I bring you greetings
[27:32] from the church back in Georgetown
[27:34] Guyana it's in the capital and my from a
[27:37] wife and my family the the Christian
[27:39] Fellowship Tabernacle and we have other
[27:42] outreach churches but God has blessed us

[27:50] is not without anyone there
[27:52] so we town guard and also for your
[27:55] prayers and your support you know in
[27:57] prayer because we come to realize that
[27:59] it's the best thing that we can do you
[28:01] may not be there in your physical
[28:03] presence
[28:04] but in your prayers and we thank God for
[28:05] grace and I truly enjoy this time of

[30:51] it's two for you somewhere down the
[30:58] narrow road you relieve my heavy load
[31:04] life supreme award receive when you
[31:10] believe race the Lord praise God we're
[31:22] all believers we were chosen of God
[31:25] before the foundation of the world to
[31:27] believe and there is not enough devil in
[31:31] hell that can stop you from believing
[31:33] because the word says all things are
[31:36] possible to them that believe it
[31:39] and we found God the city let us all
[31:41] stand together as we turn into her
[31:44] Bibles in the Book of Isaiah chapter 14
[31:48] reading from verses 26 just two verses
[31:53] of Scripture and for the thought this
[31:56] morning is conserved to his own purpose
[32:00] and served to his own purpose and we
[32:05] what is to conserve it's to keep
[32:08] something especially an important
[32:11] environmental or cultural resource from
[32:15] harm loss change or decay the importance
[32:20] of conserving or national heritage the
[32:25] saints of God we'd have beyond our
[32:27] national heritage
[32:28] it's a heavenly heritage that God has
[32:31] provided for us so God is conserved to
[32:36] serve his own purpose
[32:37] hallelujah Isaiah 14 26 this is the
[32:41] purpose that is purpose upon the whole
[32:45] earth and this is the hand that is
[32:48] stretched upon all the nations for the
[32:52] Lord of Hosts had purpose and who child
[32:57] is knowledge and his hand is stretched
[33:00] out and who shall turn it back
[33:05] let's such shall be pretty gracious God
[33:07] and Heavenly Father Lord we do thank
[33:10] thee this morning for your word that we
[33:13] can come Lord and we could read the text
[33:17] Lord but it takes the Holy Ghost this
[33:19] morning to give us the context of your
[33:22] word we pray that you may help us Lord
[33:24] as we fellowship around your word that
[33:27] every human vessel will be hidden behind
[33:31] a veil that you could be seen this
[33:33] morning Lord we pray that you bless us
[33:36] Lord in Jesus name Amen praise God you
[33:40] may be seated we do realize that God has
[33:45] a purpose and God is purposeful in
[33:49] everything that he does God is not like
[33:52] us sometimes we do things and you don't
[33:55] have a real purpose in doing it we just
[33:57] doing it because we feel like doing it
[33:59] so and there is no purpose behind it and
[34:02] when we do that you know there's not
[34:05] much that we can get out of it but when
[34:08] you have a purpose in what you're doing
[34:10] at the end of the day hallelujah then
[34:13] you could see what God would have and we
[34:16] believe that before the foundation of
[34:18] the world before there was anything that
[34:20] was being created God had a purpose in
[34:23] his mind hallelujah and God's purpose
[34:26] hallelujah
[34:27] it's an eternal purpose and whatever God
[34:30] has chosen that he wants everything that
[34:33] he does to serve his purpose and we come
[34:36] to realize even us today here we were
[34:40] being created in the image and in the
[34:41] likeness of God the service purpose
[34:44] hallelujah and what we come to realize
[34:47] is not my will or your will but it's the
[34:49] will of him hallelujah but before
[34:52] anything could serve his purpose it had
[34:54] to come in a fullness of time because in
[34:57] the beginning we were in a mind of God
[34:59] hallelujah and we were just eternal
[35:01] thoughts and we were fellowshiping with
[35:03] him hallelujah but we come to realize
[35:05] that God was not satisfied just the
[35:09] fellowship with his thoughts he wanted
[35:11] to be tangible hallelujah because he had
[35:14] a blueprint he had in his mind from the
[35:16] beginning to the end
[35:18] what it would be hallelujah and he knows
[35:21] everything that will be taking place so
[35:23] that is why the part of God says that
[35:25] nothing that happens happened
[35:27] accidentally God is in it from the
[35:30] beginning to the end but the problem is
[35:32] we are the ones don't recognize what is
[35:34] happening and when things happen to our
[35:36] life in material it's an accident and
[35:39] some people might say well it's
[35:40] different kind of condition that is
[35:42] happening but God knows and when we are
[35:45] going through conditions of our lives
[35:47] sometimes we don't understand what we
[35:50] are going through and you know we may
[35:52] want to know what is happening but when
[35:54] we come true and we pass through things
[35:56] in our life then we can look back and
[35:58] see well this is what God was really
[36:00] doing in my life and now I can
[36:02] understand but you know what we come to
[36:04] believe and realize that God I really
[36:07] wanna stood try to understand his word
[36:09] God want us to believe hallelujah
[36:12] because when we try to understand it
[36:14] means that we use the human intellect
[36:16] and we try to figure out things and
[36:19] because we cannot see true in in
[36:22] figuration by our own thoughts then we
[36:25] begin to doubt and the devil will use
[36:28] our thoughts and in our mind because the
[36:31] proud of God says the greatest battle
[36:34] ever fought is in our mind and that is
[36:36] very Satan is battling us all the time
[36:38] but when we take God at His Word and
[36:40] believe his word then things will happen
[36:43] differently because we come to realize
[36:45] that faith is the substance of things
[36:48] hoped for the evidence of things not
[36:50] seen
[36:51] so when we look into the purpose of
[36:54] God's Word or his will hallelujah God
[36:56] don't read just on just have a purpose
[36:59] but he have a time and he have a season
[37:02] and also he has our people for his
[37:05] purpose to be fulfill and when we look
[37:08] down in the ages of time and we look at
[37:10] his seven ages hallelujah we come to
[37:13] realize that God was purposeful in
[37:15] everything that he's doing and even in
[37:17] the beginning when he created a heaven
[37:19] on the earth hallelujah
[37:20] in Genesis tells us in the beginning God
[37:23] created heaven and earth
[37:25] hallelujah it was formed it was real for
[37:28] man it was void and darkness was upon
[37:31] the face
[37:32] of the deep and God could not have done
[37:35] anything hallelujah in darkness and
[37:37] confusion but then God says let there be
[37:40] light and when God says let there be
[37:43] light then he began hallelujah the
[37:46] creation of his work hallelujah and when
[37:48] he finished those creation he says well
[37:51] it is good and when he created man he
[37:53] says it is very good so God know what
[37:55] purpose he was having hallelujah and the
[37:58] purpose in God's mind hallelujah was not
[38:00] just half but just have the spirit man
[38:03] but God took the dust of the earth and
[38:06] he form it into the image of man and
[38:08] then he breathed into man a bed of life
[38:10] and then man became a living soul so
[38:13] what all these things were happening
[38:14] what God had in his mind how lujah
[38:17] unless it was spoken it cannot be
[38:19] manifested aloha so it took the spoken
[38:22] word event God speaks hallelujah it has
[38:25] to come to pass because God and his word
[38:28] you can't separate him from his word and
[38:30] we got to come to realize if we are
[38:32] spoken word churn of God we cannot
[38:35] separate us from the Word of God so that
[38:37] is why we need to know what we are
[38:40] saying and what we are speaking because
[38:42] God has conserved to serve his own
[38:44] purpose hallelujah so don't you time and
[38:47] a season that we living in we see what
[38:50] God had in his mind hallelujah it is
[38:52] being fulfilled in each generation and
[38:54] in this generation we are a privileged
[38:57] people to be in this time and in this
[39:00] season because all the prophets and the
[39:03] seers they would have lied to live or to
[39:05] seed this day that we are living in
[39:07] because this is the blending in of time
[39:09] of eternity and with the ending of time
[39:12] which we call the millennium and since
[39:14] of God we thank God for His grace that
[39:17] we can come to recognize what God is
[39:19] doing in this hour hallelujah is giving
[39:22] us the victories in our lives that we
[39:25] need to be overcomers when we get trials
[39:28] and testings and things in our life is
[39:30] not for us to complain but we must come
[39:33] to realize that because God loved us he
[39:36] wants us to be overcomers and if we
[39:39] don't get things happening in our life
[39:41] then what are we going to overcome
[39:43] hallelujah and he says only the over
[39:46] can make it hallelujah because God wants
[39:48] us to be conquer he's the great and
[39:50] mighty Conqueror hallelujah because he
[39:52] overcame how lujah we also shall
[39:55] overcome and that is what God has given
[39:57] unto us so our purpose is to live a life
[40:00] above sin our purpose is to live a life
[40:03] above anything that the world has
[40:05] because we are sons and daughters of God
[40:08] they were being created lujah in his
[40:11] image and his likeness so in every time
[40:15] in every season God allotted seeds for
[40:18] every age Alleluia and we come to
[40:21] realize even in the dark ages there was
[40:23] a bride coming forth out of that age
[40:26] hallelujah so men saying today well it's
[40:28] only in this stage but in every age God
[40:32] had a word for a season he had the
[40:34] people for a season because every seed
[40:37] are lujah that comes forth as a
[40:39] dramatized seed it had to be laying
[40:42] there in the earth
[40:43] Alleluia and when it bring laid in the
[40:45] earth it has to die and it has to rot
[40:47] and God have us in this day hallelujah
[40:50] that we have to die at ourselves we have
[40:53] to die out to everything that is
[40:54] contrary to the Word of God that we can
[40:57] live Eluga so God has a purpose for
[40:59] every one of us and it doesn't matter
[41:02] how it seems that the prophet of God
[41:05] tells us that when God made you
[41:07] hallelujah and he made I that you cannot
[41:10] take my place and I cannot take your
[41:12] place and when we come to recognize that
[41:15] and we can see our purpose there is no
[41:17] competition in the things of God
[41:19] hallelujah because we are its one spirit
[41:22] we ought to come and in the spirit of
[41:24] the unity of the faith and if we realize
[41:27] our position every position in a body
[41:30] complements the other hallelujah that's
[41:32] the very same thing in the fivefold
[41:34] ministry no ministry is greater than the
[41:36] order the great one that we have is the
[41:38] Holy Ghost and when we can believe that
[41:40] he's the great one then we can be in
[41:42] harmony with the Word of God in a
[41:45] message I know my Redeemer liveth 5804
[41:49] 65 paragraph in 14 the prophet of God
[41:54] says then we find that in the day that
[41:58] all of the world was going
[42:00] destroyed by a flood that God made a
[42:04] preparation a preparation for what cause
[42:07] to preserve his purpose before they can
[42:13] be the flood before they can be anything
[42:16] God know exactly in his mind what will
[42:19] take place hallelujah and God had
[42:21] already every preparation God don't wait
[42:24] until something happened to find a
[42:26] solution
[42:26] God knows before something happened he
[42:29] already had a provided way
[42:31] hallelujah before you and I could even
[42:33] come into the world
[42:35] God knew who we would have been I lujah
[42:38] who would have been a father who would
[42:39] have been a mother or which country will
[42:41] be born into we could have never known
[42:44] that God as human excuse me we don't
[42:47] even have a choice to choose hallelujah
[42:50] if you want to be a man okay
[42:54] this excuse me it's a very strange thing
[43:03] for me to drink water but you know
[43:05] something like I think it's immature
[43:08] anyway you know we never had a choice
[43:11] what we want to be but that was God's
[43:13] will
[43:14] hallelujah and he conserve hallelujah
[43:17] that's his purpose that when we born
[43:20] what we what we will be so he was saying
[43:22] here what is happening God made a
[43:24] preparation a preparation for what cause
[43:27] to preserve his purpose he did it in the
[43:31] days of Noah hallelujah and he's doing
[43:34] it today he has made a preparation to
[43:39] conserve to his own purpose hallelujah
[43:43] that everything he will conserve a
[43:46] church he will conserve a people he will
[43:52] conserve subjects for his great domain
[43:56] that death cannot destroy and we
[44:00] realized that it's my faith that we
[44:03] believe this but the resurrection
[44:05] produces a solid foundation of which of
[44:09] faith rests and he says nothing can
[44:12] destroy it
[44:14] so he says nothing can destroy it so by
[44:17] just reading this with the revelation
[44:19] there is nothing for us to be afraid of
[44:21] because he says nothing can destroy it
[44:24] and he says Kabir Khan's God has made a
[44:28] preparation to conserve his own purpose
[44:31] and we are the purpose of God because of
[44:35] you and I we are the purpose of God's
[44:38] creation because God whatever God has
[44:41] made he placed man to have dominion over
[44:44] everything that he has created alleluia
[44:48] God created our heavens and earth
[44:50] because of you because he wants you to
[44:52] be sons and daughters of God to come
[44:55] into your position and how long we
[44:57] cannot come into that position the Word
[44:59] of God says that the whole earth and the
[45:02] whole creation is groaning to witness
[45:05] the manifestation of the sons of God and
[45:08] how long we cannot fulfill God's purpose
[45:10] the creation will continue to grow until
[45:13] the bride come into fulness hallelujah
[45:17] and this is what the Word of God is to
[45:19] us when we look in the Old Testament
[45:21] when Adam and a and Eve fail hallelujah
[45:24] God came on the scene and he slayed a
[45:27] lamb hallelujah what God was doing God
[45:29] was preserving his own purpose he knew
[45:32] what would have taken place hallelujah
[45:34] and people saying well if God is so
[45:37] powerful and God knows everything
[45:38] why did Adam and Eve enter into that
[45:41] that was the purpose of God hallelujah
[45:43] he wanted to be a redeemer he wanted to
[45:46] be a savior he wanted to be a father
[45:48] hallelujah he wants to you see what we
[45:50] come to realize everything that God did
[45:53] hallelujah it's the service on purpose
[45:56] and as we go along the scripture will
[45:58] come to recognize that what God is doing
[46:01] haluya it was his own mind it was in his
[46:04] own thoughts because if God have a
[46:07] people at least conserving our people
[46:09] onto himself and we know that the way
[46:12] what God is doing the canoe is
[46:14] conserving us in this hour by the reveal
[46:17] restore word because we see that a whole
[46:20] world as being fallen apart and in every
[46:22] age is not at the beginning of the age
[46:25] is the ending of the age
[46:27] God always sends his word warning before
[46:30] judgment because if it's the beginning
[46:33] of the age by the time the eight is over
[46:35] everything will be corrupted hallelujah
[46:37] and there is nothing for the people to
[46:39] come back to but God is so gracious and
[46:42] merciful hallelujah
[46:44] you know the part of God made a
[46:45] statement he says God will allow things
[46:48] to be said things to be done that for
[46:51] the unbelievers
[46:52] hallelujah to blaspheme the word of God
[46:56] that they can did that judgment it must
[46:59] be right because God is not unjust God
[47:02] will not judge you without warning so
[47:04] God has conserved his own purpose and
[47:07] what we come to realize the bride in
[47:10] this hour must come under that headship
[47:12] Alleluia and the only way she could come
[47:15] by is by the Word of God so we can look
[47:18] down and we in through the Scriptures
[47:19] and we can see so many thing happening
[47:21] when we look back at Elijah when he had
[47:24] this showdown with the false prophets of
[47:27] Bel there was four hundred prophets and
[47:29] he was there and they said Oh God and
[47:32] answer by fire that would mean of God
[47:35] hallelujah so they were saying he told
[47:38] them that whatever you do make sure you
[47:40] don't light your own fire you don't do
[47:41] your own thing we are trusting we are
[47:44] calling on God and they they had their
[47:47] beliefs and they in their condition they
[47:50] were so sincere in what they are doing
[47:52] that they felt they were right and they
[47:54] call and there was not showdown
[47:56] but things of God is not your sincerity
[47:59] in what you feel that is right it must
[48:01] be a revelation by the Word of God
[48:03] because our emotion cannot save us our
[48:06] emotion cannot help us it takes the Holy
[48:09] Spirit to lead us and guide us so and we
[48:13] do believe also emotion comes and goes
[48:15] but when you have the baptism of the
[48:17] Holy Ghost in your life scenes of God
[48:19] it's there to stay God never give his
[48:22] sons and daughters the baptism of the
[48:24] Holy Ghost in their life long in their
[48:26] soul and take it away God is not like
[48:28] the Indian giver to give and to take
[48:30] back and that is what you need the
[48:31] tongue God for today hallelujah your
[48:34] times in our life we can lose the joy of
[48:37] our salvation but since of God is always
[48:39] a way that
[48:40] could come back to the Word of God
[48:42] hallelujah that is why we need a filling
[48:44] and a refilling every time you feel the
[48:47] need in our lives we come before God and
[48:49] he can replenish us back again
[48:51] hallelujah so does show done started and
[48:54] got the God allow his prophet to tell
[48:57] the bill who are you well you take the
[48:59] first jump you do what you have to do
[49:01] God is never in a hurry hallelujah and
[49:04] God is not in competition to show off
[49:07] what he can do
[49:08] but God does what he has to do and
[49:10] that's every believer we also must do
[49:13] the very same thing so as they started
[49:15] to pray and they cry out and they jump
[49:17] and they shout and everything was going
[49:19] for them and time was going and you
[49:22] could see their emotion and they were
[49:24] getting tired after a while and he lied
[49:26] to say Oh probably a god is sleeping you
[49:28] got to cry a little harder shout a
[49:30] little harder and they cried and they
[49:32] shouted and so he said probably he's
[49:34] gone on a fire journey you know you got
[49:37] to speak a little call him back and it
[49:39] did already an and the emotions started
[49:42] rising and they started working their
[49:44] emotion I what happened he started jump
[49:46] on the altar and he started all BHEL
[49:48] BHEL and it was crying out before him
[49:50] and they started cutting themselves and
[49:52] blood come out of his skin and all these
[49:55] things are nothing can happen hallelujah
[49:58] but it's not in works that we can boast
[50:00] but it's in the grace of God so they
[50:02] were doing all of that and when the
[50:04] evening sacrifice came he light us as
[50:06] well this is my turn now you had all day
[50:09] to do what you had to do and there is no
[50:12] excuses now so you and the problem God
[50:14] says Elisha he was not just a believer
[50:17] but he was an inspired believer and that
[50:20] is what God wants us to be this hour
[50:22] everybody say well I'm a message
[50:24] believer and I believe the prophets
[50:26] message is beyond being a message
[50:29] believer hallelujah it's beyond coming
[50:32] to a message Church this message is not
[50:34] a concept but it's message is the
[50:36] reality of God hallelujah so what we
[50:39] find a concept you could understand it
[50:41] by intellectual conception but this
[50:43] message is a revelation from God that
[50:46] God conserves his own purpose hallelujah
[50:48] so that is why when you have the
[50:51] revelation of this message you cannot
[50:53] leave this message
[50:54] because you're part of God today you
[50:58] find mayor if you go
[50:59] many people say you know well I once
[51:01] believed the message and I leave the
[51:02] message because I believe the message is
[51:04] not true
[51:05] since of God if you really believe the
[51:07] message you can never leave it because
[51:09] the Word of God says nothing can
[51:11] separate us from the love of God so if
[51:14] the love of God is in your heart which
[51:16] is God Himself saints of God it doesn't
[51:19] matter what we have to go through our
[51:20] trials or testings and everything you
[51:23] will stay a ground with the Word of God
[51:24] so as an inspired believer Elida told
[51:27] him well you know I just don't want to
[51:30] pray to my god like that but first of
[51:32] all you did along the the altar a trench
[51:35] and I want you to fill it with water
[51:37] when God does something hallelujah it's
[51:40] different than what the world can do
[51:42] because when God does something
[51:43] hallelujah it will catch the attention
[51:46] you cannot say well it is a fake when
[51:48] God does something you know it's the
[51:50] supernatural you know it is God
[51:52] hallelujah God always vindicates his
[51:54] word so he writes ah he got him to do
[51:57] that and he set the evening sacrifice
[51:59] and he came before God and about before
[52:01] Elisha could have finished praying a
[52:04] lure of fire came down hallelujah and
[52:07] dried up the water and lit up the
[52:09] sacrifice hallelujah and the name of God
[52:12] was being praised on what happened all
[52:14] day they started saying that God is the
[52:16] God and Elijah took a sword and he
[52:19] slayed all 400 of those men those false
[52:23] prophets with the edge of the sword and
[52:25] then when the Jezebel heard what had
[52:28] taken place he said well he had killed
[52:30] my prophets I'm gonna get in and when he
[52:32] lied you heard that hallelujah the man
[52:35] stepped in and he said well I done all
[52:37] of this I'm the sacrifices I've trod on
[52:40] all the altars and destroy everything
[52:42] and now my life isn't returning so he
[52:46] says Lord he was hiding and he was
[52:48] running from that woman Jezebel he's
[52:50] suing you're under anointing you can
[52:51] feel so powerful but when you come back
[52:53] to the human element that is why we
[52:55] always need to have value you that
[52:58] anointing go into the depths of our soul
[53:00] when you have the Holy Ghost in your
[53:02] life there is nothing that can hinder
[53:04] you things of God God give you the
[53:06] victory so what happened he was
[53:08] running for his life from that woman
[53:10] jessabelle but after a while he came say
[53:13] Lord I'm not fit to live I've done this
[53:16] and I have done that and now I'm the
[53:18] only one remaining and what's the use
[53:21] that I'm here and my life is being
[53:23] threatened the Lord we say Elijah you're
[53:26] not the only one there are seven
[53:28] thousand who have never even borrowed
[53:31] their knees on to be here seeing some
[53:34] God so we can't what God has
[53:35] Conservatives on purpose and in this
[53:38] hour that we are living in sometimes we
[53:40] might feel you know that we are the only
[53:42] message believers around but they are
[53:44] the unheard off there are places you go
[53:47] right in your own country right in your
[53:49] own City there might be too and trees
[53:51] gathering together how we are under the
[53:53] banner of the message of the hour and we
[53:56] may not even know them but God knows
[53:59] hallelujah you might go into the jungles
[54:01] of the Amazon or into the savannahs of
[54:03] Africa and all these places but they are
[54:05] God's people everywhere
[54:07] God has conserved hallelujah to serve is
[54:10] to care for his own purpose God
[54:13] preserves his own purpose
[54:14] since of God you and I cannot preserve
[54:17] this message is this message that is
[54:19] preserving us you and I cannot defend
[54:22] this message is this message that is
[54:24] defending us because everything that we
[54:26] do is to serve God's purpose hallelujah
[54:30] and everything we believe in this hour
[54:32] it is just the grace of God towards us
[54:35] and what we come to realize nothing can
[54:38] destroy the true purpose of God because
[54:41] the true purpose of God stands in
[54:43] election hallelujah and that is what we
[54:46] believe in this hour so this message
[54:48] that God has given to us we come to
[54:51] realize that it's a message of faith
[54:53] because Abraham he we have an Abrahamic
[54:56] promise Allu that is not just given to
[54:59] you but those that even that is afar off
[55:02] hallelujah Abraham did not see
[55:05] everything in his day hallelujah but we
[55:07] in this hour we are the most privileged
[55:09] people what Abraham wanted to see way
[55:11] back then we are now seeing it now
[55:13] because God has placed us in this time
[55:16] and season but because we are children
[55:18] of a faith because of Abraham faith
[55:22] the substance of things hoped for the
[55:24] evidence of things not seen
[55:25] and Abraham we know her of his story of
[55:28] his life that he was seeking a city
[55:31] whose builder and maker is God Abraham
[55:33] was a rich man he was having 318
[55:36] servants and he had everything that he
[55:39] could think of but yet he was not
[55:41] satisfied because the things of the
[55:44] world cannot satisfy the spiritual that
[55:47] was within the inside because we came
[55:50] from God we have to go back to him
[55:52] because the life Zoe is in sorry you it
[55:55] takes a spiritual life sins of God even
[55:58] in this world that we living in all the
[56:00] social amenities no matter what we have
[56:03] still that cannot bring that kind of
[56:05] comfort to us because how many beds you
[56:08] can sleep in at the same time how many
[56:10] vehicles you could drive at the same
[56:12] time how many different dishes are our
[56:15] meals you can eat at the same time and
[56:17] even if there is your favorite after a
[56:19] while you'd go so much it's about I
[56:22] don't feel like eating this anymore I am
[56:24] you know I'm just dissatisfied and you
[56:26] will want something new because there's
[56:28] a thirst within the inside and the only
[56:31] thing that can fulfill that thirst is
[56:33] when you come into the understanding of
[56:35] whom to know means life eternal
[56:38] hallelujah so we can thank God for the
[56:41] message of the hour we are being brought
[56:43] up in denominations and in different
[56:45] places or we were in the barnyard but
[56:47] when we heard a voice came to us
[56:49] hallelujah then something inside because
[56:52] God had a purpose
[56:53] God's purpose was not for us to be in
[56:55] denomination and in cults and in
[56:57] different things but God's purpose for
[56:59] us hallelujah is to be in him hallelujah
[57:02] so when we are being placed upon the
[57:04] face of the earth as we say before
[57:06] there's a time and there's a season and
[57:09] this season
[57:10] God has pleased hallelujah that we can
[57:13] come forth as his sons and his daughters
[57:15] to be the bride in this generation so
[57:18] it's just the grace of God in this power
[57:20] that we are living in and the part of
[57:22] God as we continue in the same message I
[57:24] know my Redeemer liveth Barbara 15 all
[57:27] powers of Hell might wager against it
[57:31] but but it will prevail
[57:35] louia we have God's eternal promise
[57:38] there may be teachers there might be ISM
[57:42] Rises there might be great program Rises
[57:45] there might be things that look like
[57:48] that it would be destroyed but it can
[57:51] never be destroyed it is the purpose of
[57:54] God to see that it will prevail Alleluia
[57:59] didn't Peter and all the the disciples
[58:02] and the order the scribes and the
[58:03] Pharisees and everybody was there and
[58:05] they're saying whom do some say that I
[58:07] am some City Elias John the Baptist some
[58:10] say you know every different things but
[58:12] he turned to Peter whom do you say that
[58:14] I am Peter says thou art a Christ the
[58:17] Son of the Living God and he said Simon
[58:20] Peter flesh and blood did not reveal
[58:23] this to you but my father which is in
[58:26] heaven upon upon this rock I will build
[58:30] my church and the gates of Hell shall
[58:32] not prevail against it it was not built
[58:35] upon Peter but it was built upon a
[58:37] revelation of a Lord Jesus Christ the
[58:40] saints of God we have God's eternal
[58:42] purpose there might be teachers they
[58:44] might be isms rise there might be great
[58:47] program rise and we see what is
[58:49] happening in this day Alleluia all kind
[58:51] of things is coming up and is rising and
[58:54] a part of God says don't bother with
[58:56] those things that come and fly around
[58:58] these things
[58:58] you must believe the word for the hour
[59:00] because things will come and things will
[59:03] go but a Word of God stands for all
[59:05] eternity
[59:07] hallelujah so what we come to believe
[59:09] with all the isms and every program
[59:12] there might be things that look like
[59:14] that it would be destroy but it can
[59:16] never be destroyed it is the purpose of
[59:19] God to see that it will prevail so he
[59:22] says then it's not up to me it's not up
[59:26] to you where it will be destroy or not
[59:27] it's up to God
[59:29] and and we can rest assure on it that
[59:33] God will never let our heritage be
[59:36] destroyed for it is his purpose to give
[59:40] it to us all we are God's heritage can
[59:43] never be destroyed it doesn't matter how
[59:45] low it seems to be and for
[59:48] elect seed of God Alleluia once your
[59:51] being elect of God the prod of God's is
[59:54] a true elect seed of God can never
[59:57] commit the unpardonable sin it doesn't
[59:59] matter how slow you stoop in sin and
[1:00:03] what you have done in your life
[1:00:04] hallelujah God will never allow you to
[1:00:08] cross that line because you are a
[1:00:10] heritage of God and you're conserved to
[1:00:13] serve God's purpose
[1:00:15] he conserves the things of God he
[1:00:17] conserves a people he conserves his
[1:00:19] church that we can come and you can
[1:00:21] worship Him so what is happening today
[1:00:23] many temple go around say oh my I don't
[1:00:27] know what is happening around the
[1:00:28] message you know the churches seemed to
[1:00:30] be so frail and so many things are
[1:00:32] happening I don't know what is happening
[1:00:33] we got to stop murmuring and complaining
[1:00:35] the prophet of God says that a bride is
[1:00:39] right in our position that nothing is
[1:00:43] out a cater with the bride so if nothing
[1:00:45] is out a cater with a bride it means
[1:00:47] that we are not looking in the right
[1:00:49] direction we are looking into things and
[1:00:51] places that we should not even be
[1:00:53] looking we should not be looking for
[1:00:55] perfection and a brother and a sister
[1:00:56] you should look for perfection in your
[1:00:58] very own life by the Word of God but it
[1:01:01] called us to look at look at each other
[1:01:03] for example christ jesus is our example
[1:01:06] hallelujah and paul says follow after me
[1:01:09] as i follow after him i'll follow me as
[1:01:12] I follow Christ so we know that what we
[1:01:14] are doing today that we have the
[1:01:16] leadership of the Holy Spirit that we
[1:01:18] can come and saints of God we are we can
[1:01:21] rest assured it that God will never let
[1:01:25] her heritage be destroyed for it is his
[1:01:27] purpose to give it to us you know why
[1:01:30] because he is the chief Cornerstone
[1:01:33] hallelujah and the whole foundation is
[1:01:37] builded upon him and that Brides
[1:01:39] position today is in him and if you are
[1:01:43] in him there is nothing for us to be
[1:01:45] afraid of because God is in charge of
[1:01:48] every situation hallelujah and that is
[1:01:50] what you got to come to realize is not
[1:01:52] what the world is doing or what is
[1:01:54] happening outside but is what is
[1:01:56] happening inside of you that is what you
[1:01:58] got a comforter remember we are Gentiles
[1:02:00] what God is
[1:02:02] dealing with us as individuals and when
[1:02:06] you're dealing one-on-one hallelujah
[1:02:07] it's a better relationship that we can
[1:02:10] have such a fellowship in this hour with
[1:02:12] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so we
[1:02:15] got to come to realize since of God that
[1:02:17] God has a kingdom hallelujah he's the
[1:02:21] king of kings because though he says
[1:02:23] that he will conserve subjects for his
[1:02:25] great domain so how can God have a
[1:02:28] domain and he's a king and he don't have
[1:02:30] subjects hallelujah and how can we say
[1:02:33] that we are Chernov the king and we
[1:02:35] don't know who our king is he's our king
[1:02:37] of kings and he's the Lord of lords
[1:02:39] hallelujah so that is why we come to
[1:02:41] realize that we have come under headship
[1:02:44] and headship is not what you may say
[1:02:47] bondage headship is a privilege when we
[1:02:50] come under his headship there's nothing
[1:02:51] for us to worry about hallelujah because
[1:02:54] we come to realize people are worrying
[1:02:56] in their life or what is going to happen
[1:02:58] to this world what is going to happen to
[1:03:00] our country what is going to happen to
[1:03:02] our children since of God that should
[1:03:04] not be our worry hallelujah so you know
[1:03:07] why worry when we have the faith in God
[1:03:09] Alleluia what we need to do is to
[1:03:12] believe God the devil always want to
[1:03:14] obscure your mind with all different
[1:03:16] kind of things hallelujah but we know
[1:03:19] that according to the Word of God our
[1:03:21] life stands in election before the
[1:03:24] foundation of the world we were chosen
[1:03:26] in him hallelujah you can turn with me
[1:03:28] to our Bibles and a book of Ephesians
[1:03:30] chapter one reading from verses 9 he
[1:03:43] says he fission's chapter 1 verses
[1:03:45] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:03:49] whose will of his will according to WHO
[1:03:53] his good pleasure
[1:03:56] with who he had purposed in himself so
[1:04:00] it doesn't have nothing to do with your
[1:04:03] eye we don't have a choice
[1:04:06] but if God has elected you to be his son
[1:04:08] and daughter
[1:04:09] there's nothing can stop you from that
[1:04:11] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:04:13] of time that who
[1:04:16] but he might gather together in one all
[1:04:18] things in Christ both which are in
[1:04:22] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:04:27] him in whom also we have obtained an
[1:04:31] inheritance so he see we are part of it
[1:04:34] in whom also we have obtained in
[1:04:36] heritance being predestinated according
[1:04:40] to the purpose of him who work at all
[1:04:44] things after the counsel of his own will
[1:04:49] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:04:53] glory who first trusted in Christ in
[1:04:58] whom also he ought trusted after that he
[1:05:03] heard the word of truth we thank God
[1:05:06] that faith called by hearing and hearing
[1:05:09] by the word and the word for did a
[1:05:11] reveal word for this day hallelujah
[1:05:14] which we have heard and the know the
[1:05:17] word says that all things are possible
[1:05:18] to them that believe it so in whom that
[1:05:22] we all trusted after that he heard a
[1:05:24] word of truth the gospel of your
[1:05:26] salvation in whom also after that he
[1:05:31] believed he were sealed with the Holy
[1:05:34] Spirit of promise
[1:05:36] Alleluia which is the earnest of our
[1:05:39] inheritance until the redemption of the
[1:05:42] purchased possession unto the praise of
[1:05:46] his glory
[1:05:48] so since of God we can count God for
[1:05:51] that hallelujah because while we were
[1:05:54] yet sinners he shed his blood he gave
[1:05:57] his life for us
[1:05:58] hallelujah we were not conscious of what
[1:06:01] was happening Alleluia but when we heard
[1:06:04] a message like that little Eagle in the
[1:06:06] barnyard
[1:06:07] then our consciousness hallelujah came
[1:06:09] in that we are not chickens but we are
[1:06:12] Eagles then we realize that we're sons
[1:06:15] and daughters of God then we realized
[1:06:17] that we are the Bride of Christ Jesus
[1:06:19] hallelujah coming into the place that
[1:06:22] God would have of us so God promised to
[1:06:25] give us his life that we can be sealed
[1:06:29] with the holy spirit of promise Alleluia
[1:06:32] are not just for a moment but until the
[1:06:35] very end hallelujah
[1:06:37] through all eternity because once seal
[1:06:40] always see Alleluia nothing nothing can
[1:06:43] break that seal even God Himself
[1:06:46] hallelujah cannot do because God is
[1:06:48] perfect and whatever God does hallelujah
[1:06:51] he know exactly what he's doing
[1:06:53] we as human we do things and when we
[1:06:56] find that you know well I don't think I
[1:06:57] had it right at the beginning by the
[1:06:59] moment you thought it was right and then
[1:07:02] you have to do an addition to make it
[1:07:04] become perfect in your sight but God
[1:07:06] will have to do that God is perfect in
[1:07:10] all his ways from the beginning to the
[1:07:12] end and time does not change God
[1:07:15] Alleluia because he's the same yesterday
[1:07:18] today and forever and there was nothing
[1:07:20] in time that could change God in time we
[1:07:23] do things in our life and we have to
[1:07:25] change our plans
[1:07:26] but since God never changes man of his
[1:07:29] word because He is God and he knows
[1:07:31] everything and we need to come into the
[1:07:33] Fellowship of the Holy Ghost by the
[1:07:36] grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:07:37] Christ
[1:07:38] in Ephesians 3:9 tells us Ephesians
[1:07:41] chapter 3 verses 9 he says and to make
[1:07:49] all men see that what is the Fellowship
[1:07:53] of the mystery with from the beginning
[1:07:55] of the world had being hidden God who
[1:08:00] created all things in the big it was
[1:08:03] hidden in God at the beginning he who
[1:08:05] created all things but in a fullness of
[1:08:08] time we come to realize that God wants
[1:08:11] us hallelujah to know everything that he
[1:08:13] has because the proud of God all what
[1:08:17] God had he pour into Christ on
[1:08:19] everything Christ Jesus that he put into
[1:08:21] us the bride in this day so everything
[1:08:24] that was hidden before the the
[1:08:26] foundation of the world from the
[1:08:27] beginning in time God hallelujah through
[1:08:31] the revelation of his word to us through
[1:08:33] his will that we could come into
[1:08:35] recognition to know the mind of God
[1:08:37] hallelujah so according to the eternal
[1:08:39] purpose which he purposed in Christ
[1:08:42] Jesus
[1:08:43] Lord in whom we have boldness and access
[1:08:48] but confidence my fate of him saints of
[1:08:53] God so we have a boldness we have a
[1:08:56] confidence by the faith of him
[1:08:59] Alleluia who have called us out from
[1:09:01] darkness into his marvelous light
[1:09:04] hallelujah that we in this hour that we
[1:09:07] shall show forth his praises and we
[1:09:10] thank God today that we all be living
[1:09:12] epistles read and seen of all men
[1:09:14] because everything that God is doing God
[1:09:17] has conserved everything to serve his
[1:09:19] purpose and this is what he is doing
[1:09:22] Alleluia in the in the sardian church
[1:09:24] age paragraph 2 79 - 3 it's a church
[1:09:29] issue chapter 7 it tells us here the
[1:09:33] part of God was saying he says the
[1:09:36] purpose of God it stands in election so
[1:09:40] he see what is the purpose of God stands
[1:09:43] in election Alleluia it was purposed in
[1:09:47] himself it was God's purpose to bring
[1:09:52] forth a people like unto himself
[1:09:56] Alleluia the woo that would be a word
[1:09:59] bride that's imagine that listen now she
[1:10:04] was chosen before the foundation of the
[1:10:08] world in him so the bride is not now the
[1:10:12] bride was chosen before the foundation
[1:10:15] of the world in him the prophet of God
[1:10:18] says she was foreknown and not only for
[1:10:22] known but beloved before she was ever
[1:10:28] brought forth she was beloved before she
[1:10:31] was ever brought forth hallelujah during
[1:10:35] the ages upon the earth
[1:10:36] she was redeemed by his blood and can
[1:10:40] never come into condemnation she can
[1:10:43] never be in judgment because sin cannot
[1:10:47] be imputed onto her saints of God what a
[1:10:50] privilege people that we are conserved
[1:10:53] this on purpose
[1:10:55] that should make us happy that's a
[1:10:57] make us live in victory and not to be
[1:10:59] defeated by the enemy when the enemy
[1:11:03] comes in like a flood is a standard and
[1:11:05] sins of God the standard is the very
[1:11:07] word of God for us because the purpose
[1:11:10] of God stands in election and we had
[1:11:13] nothing to do with the election of God
[1:11:15] it was all in the mind of God or what we
[1:11:19] have to come a lujah because God placed
[1:11:21] his life in us we cannot do anything
[1:11:24] more than to accept the plan of God for
[1:11:26] our life we should never fight against
[1:11:29] the Word of God because God have chosen
[1:11:32] us in himself that we should serve Him
[1:11:34] didn't John John says who serve is born
[1:11:38] of God does not commit sin for his seed
[1:11:41] remains in him and he cannot sin because
[1:11:43] he is born of God so what should we be
[1:11:47] afraid of a true Christian hallelujah
[1:11:51] cannot sin a true Christian you only
[1:11:53] make mistakes and a cinnamon the man who
[1:11:57] is a sinner out there he can do because
[1:12:01] he's born in sin and everything you
[1:12:03] think about is sin where you have the
[1:12:08] mind of Christ since of God when you
[1:12:11] make a mistake you don't willfully want
[1:12:13] to make a mistake that is why he says we
[1:12:16] don't sin we make mistakes and we thank
[1:12:20] God for grace because of the seed of God
[1:12:22] in you you have no desire to sin if we
[1:12:26] have a desire to sin something is wrong
[1:12:28] in the inside it mean that as a corrupt
[1:12:30] seed because when you have the mind of
[1:12:32] Christ or what you want to do is to
[1:12:34] please him hallelujah and in pleasing
[1:12:37] God sometimes we try to go about in the
[1:12:39] wrong way and we end up like Jacob Jacob
[1:12:42] Moses a planter he was a deceiver but he
[1:12:44] is motive and his objective was to
[1:12:47] receive the birthright and sometime you
[1:12:50] want a blessing in our life but we go
[1:12:52] about it in the wrong way that is why
[1:12:54] God looks at your motive on your
[1:12:56] objective that is what God looks at
[1:12:59] hallelujah God look at us on the outside
[1:13:01] God looks at us in the inside because
[1:13:04] that is what really speaks is the really
[1:13:06] the inside man that God is looking at
[1:13:09] Alleluia so
[1:13:11] you come to realize in first Peter 2:9
[1:13:14] tells us what he are a chosen generation
[1:13:18] Alleluia you're a royal priesthood
[1:13:20] you're a holy nation
[1:13:22] you're a peculiar people that he should
[1:13:26] show forth the praises of him who had
[1:13:29] called you out from darkness into his
[1:13:33] marvelous light
[1:13:34] gaurav we are to show peace of God
[1:13:37] the bride is guards show peace Alleluia
[1:13:42] to the world that a world want to know
[1:13:44] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:13:47] and he has been revealed to his bride
[1:13:50] his people but today the bride has
[1:13:52] become a mystery to the world they don't
[1:13:55] know what is really taking place but you
[1:13:57] know who you are in Christ Jesus
[1:13:59] hallelujah praise God so but he are a
[1:14:04] chosen generation you are a royal
[1:14:06] priesthood you're a holy nation
[1:14:09] you are peculiar people that he should
[1:14:11] so for the praises of him who called you
[1:14:14] out of darkness into his marvelous light
[1:14:16] which in time past were not a people
[1:14:19] remember you were Gentiles we never were
[1:14:22] looking for nothing we were just there
[1:14:24] just doing what we want to do we had no
[1:14:27] hope but are now the people of God which
[1:14:32] he says which had not obtained mercy but
[1:14:36] now have obtained mercy the Jews were
[1:14:39] seeking and what the orders they were
[1:14:41] signed seekers and they were looking in
[1:14:43] the Stars and all different things but
[1:14:46] what you and I were doing
[1:14:47] we had no thought we had no mind towards
[1:14:50] anything hallelujah so but now I read
[1:14:54] now but are now the people of God which
[1:14:57] had not obtained mercy but now have
[1:15:00] obtained mercy says dearly beloved I
[1:15:03] beseech you as strangers and pilgrims
[1:15:05] abstain from fleshly lusts which war it
[1:15:10] against the soul having a conversation
[1:15:13] honest among Gentiles that whereas they
[1:15:17] speak against you as evildoers they may
[1:15:20] by your good works which they shall
[1:15:24] behold
[1:15:25] glorify God in the day of visitation so
[1:15:29] by the way that you live man can glorify
[1:15:32] God
[1:15:33] they might say or Mara evil against you
[1:15:35] but you know where you're standing when
[1:15:37] you're standing upon the Word of God
[1:15:39] sayings of God you don't care what
[1:15:41] people have to say because remember you
[1:15:43] are peculiar people I what is peculiar
[1:15:45] that which is one's own belonging to
[1:15:49] one's possessions are people selected by
[1:15:52] God from the other nations for his own
[1:15:55] possession you may not be anything to
[1:15:59] anybody else but you are a chosen
[1:16:03] generation but you are a royal
[1:16:05] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[1:16:07] people talk so for the praises of him I
[1:16:10] loo you who have called your from
[1:16:13] darkness into his marvelous light so we
[1:16:16] come to recognize that the hour that we
[1:16:18] are living in is just the grace of a
[1:16:21] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that we can
[1:16:23] recognize that every seed must bring
[1:16:26] forth of his kind so that is what God is
[1:16:28] doing from the time the world begun in
[1:16:31] in the book of Genesis in time God is
[1:16:34] conserved to serve support the service
[1:16:37] for his own purpose Alleluia and we come
[1:16:41] to realize that what God is doing
[1:16:43] hallelujah
[1:16:44] nothing can stop God's program it
[1:16:46] doesn't matter if we don't believe or
[1:16:48] not God will do what he has to do i Lu
[1:16:52] you you know the proud of God says it at
[1:16:54] Pergamon Church 8 paragraph 171 he says
[1:16:58] here is what I'm trying to say to you
[1:17:01] the law of reproduction is is that each
[1:17:05] species bring forth after its own kind
[1:17:08] even according to Genesis 111 where God
[1:17:13] says let the earth bring forth grass and
[1:17:16] a herb yielding seed and a fruit tree
[1:17:19] yielding or fruit after his kind whose
[1:17:22] season himself upon the earth and it was
[1:17:26] so so whatever life was in the seed came
[1:17:30] forth into a plant and dense into the
[1:17:33] fruit the very same law applies to the
[1:17:37] Church to D so the prod of God says
[1:17:40] whatever seat started in the church will
[1:17:43] comfort and be like the original seed
[1:17:47] because it is the same seed God didn't
[1:17:51] change the seed God and change his word
[1:17:53] what started out in Genesis will
[1:17:56] continue right down to the very end
[1:17:58] because it is perfect and a Word of God
[1:18:01] can never be contaminated it can never
[1:18:04] be crossbred by any other seed because
[1:18:08] it is being kept by himself hallelujah
[1:18:11] so it's the same seed and in these last
[1:18:13] days the true bride church Christ seed
[1:18:17] will come to the headstone the true
[1:18:20] bride church why did he say true bride
[1:18:23] church because you have lots of church
[1:18:25] everybody say well be our bride be a
[1:18:27] message believers but saints of God not
[1:18:29] all Israel are Israel but God has his
[1:18:32] chosen he knows and you know who you are

[1:19:36] it's the wrong seed on a wrong seed
[1:19:39] hallelujah can never produce something
[1:19:41] that is good hallelujah so denominations
[1:19:45] cannot produce this the wrong seed they
[1:19:47] will produce their Creed's and their
[1:19:49] dogmas mix
[1:19:51] the word this mongrel icing bring 40 a
[1:19:54] hybrid product what is manga realizing
[1:19:57] mix up this is where you find a lot of
[1:19:59] mixing up today car don't want to us to
[1:20:02] be mixed up with the world and the
[1:20:04] things of the world Alleluia
[1:20:05] even that is why a proud of God he was
[1:20:08] saying that even us as believers under
[1:20:10] no circumstance a believer should ever
[1:20:12] married to an unbeliever and this is the
[1:20:14] very word of God is the many cause was
[1:20:17] believer there is no mixing up there is
[1:20:19] the Word of God
[1:20:20] Alleluia because in Romans 11 16 tells
[1:20:24] us for if the first-fruit be holy the
[1:20:26] lump is also holy and if the root be
[1:20:30] holy so are the branches so he is the
[1:20:33] vine and we are the branches so what
[1:20:35] expect me ought to be and he says if the
[1:20:39] branches don't bring forth fruit what
[1:20:42] he's gonna do he's gonna chop them off
[1:20:44] and saints of God when John came in his
[1:20:48] day preaching what he says he generation
[1:20:50] of vipers who had warned you of the
[1:20:52] coming of the Lord
[1:20:53] he said the axe is already laid to the
[1:20:55] root saints of God since the message
[1:20:58] came we come to realize the actors
[1:21:00] already laid at a root so we already
[1:21:03] bringing forth fruit in this day that we
[1:21:05] are living in hallelujah because we come
[1:21:07] to realize that same power that God has
[1:21:10] given to those in the book of Acts when
[1:21:12] he went up into the Upper Room is that
[1:21:14] same power we shall be having today we
[1:21:16] should have that very same faith when we
[1:21:18] look at us and may look at what was
[1:21:20] happening in the book of Acts sometime
[1:21:22] if we seem so far away from what they
[1:21:24] were doing because the matter says don't
[1:21:27] they when they came out from the upper
[1:21:29] room you know what drove them into the
[1:21:30] upper room they had a commission to go
[1:21:33] but God allowed conditions to happen all
[1:21:36] who that fear came upon them and many of
[1:21:38] them they were being driven by fear and
[1:21:40] when they went into the upper room they
[1:21:42] locked the windows and a lock and they
[1:21:44] closed the doors
[1:21:45] hallelujah and they were there there
[1:21:47] crying out to God because they were
[1:21:49] afraid you know that a conquer will come
[1:21:51] and get them and there we put the debt
[1:21:53] but God allow it to happen because he
[1:21:56] give a commission going to the upper
[1:21:58] room to be endued with power from on
[1:22:01] high
[1:22:01] and then you're going to be commit
[1:22:03] mice's
[1:22:04] louia many of them probably wanted to
[1:22:06] just be you know just go true and become
[1:22:09] witnesses but God has a provided way
[1:22:11] before any man or woman holu departed
[1:22:13] even before you can even take communion
[1:22:15] you must have the Holy Ghost Alleluia
[1:22:18] so more much less more to be a servant
[1:22:20] of God the standing behind a pulpit you
[1:22:22] must have a relationship with God I loo
[1:22:25] as we cannot be true witnesses for him
[1:22:28] Alleluia so we come to realize what took
[1:22:31] place when the Holy Ghost came upon them
[1:22:34] they lost they forget about all the
[1:22:36] affairs they are being delivered and
[1:22:38] those same men that were running from
[1:22:40] the life they flung the doors on a
[1:22:42] windows open and they ran upon the
[1:22:44] streets and I be here to preach the
[1:22:46] gospel
[1:22:46] Alleluia and look how many more being
[1:22:49] baptized after the day of Pentecost when
[1:22:51] Peter preached hallelujah is this a man
[1:22:54] and well what shall we do he says repent
[1:22:55] and be baptized in the name the Lord
[1:22:58] Jesus Christ and when the Apostles
[1:23:00] Alleluia God began to move the Bible
[1:23:02] says that fear came into their hearts of
[1:23:05] the people are we seeing that is
[1:23:09] happening today we got to come into the
[1:23:12] power a demonstration of the Holy Spirit
[1:23:14] our life has to be worthy of this gospel
[1:23:16] Alleluia we cannot live double lives and
[1:23:19] then expect that people they will look
[1:23:21] and see God in manifestation we don't
[1:23:24] have a church life and a home life and a
[1:23:26] going-out life it has to be one life
[1:23:28] hallelujah and the best the prouder of
[1:23:30] God spoke a lot on home life
[1:23:32] I'll charity begins at home is not when
[1:23:35] you come into the church to travel and
[1:23:37] you live like a devil and you're during
[1:23:39] the weekend when you come to church on a
[1:23:41] Sunday you want to be a saint there's no
[1:23:43] double standard with the Word of God
[1:23:45] hallelujah the right atmosphere have to
[1:23:48] be created on a home if you have strong
[1:23:50] homes Alleluia strong families then
[1:23:53] they'll have a strong church because
[1:23:56] they say that we gotta come to realize
[1:23:58] as parents we are to train up our
[1:24:00] children and the fear of the Lord in a
[1:24:02] way they oughta grow that when they of a
[1:24:03] do not depart from the word of truth
[1:24:05] Alleluia so we come to realize the day
[1:24:07] that we're living in we are not fighting
[1:24:09] against flesh and blood but it's our
[1:24:11] prince of parties and a power that is
[1:24:13] why God have conserved the service on
[1:24:16] purpose
[1:24:17] hallelujah he's serving his own
[1:24:19] conserved so we have to serve his
[1:24:21] purpose hallelujah in the day that we
[1:24:24] are living in that we could go by the
[1:24:25] grace of a Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:24:27] and we can thank God for everything
[1:24:30] because there is a provided way for
[1:24:33] every son and daughter of God that we
[1:24:35] could love him that we could serve him
[1:24:37] with all our heart and all our soul it
[1:24:39] all I was straight I Louie what a
[1:24:41] wonderful hour that we are living in
[1:24:43] hallelujah the product the Bible tells
[1:24:45] us in in 2nd Timothy chapter 1 verses 9
[1:24:50] who had save us and who and and called
[1:24:56] us with a holy calling not according to
[1:24:59] our works Alleluia
[1:25:01] but according to his own purpose and
[1:25:03] grace which was given us in Christ Jesus
[1:25:07] before the world began
[1:25:12] Alleluia we were were we were in his
[1:25:14] mind
[1:25:15] Alleluia we were there but it's now made
[1:25:18] manifest by the appearing of our Savior
[1:25:21] Jesus Christ
[1:25:22] what abolished debt and had brought life
[1:25:26] and immortality to the light through the
[1:25:30] gospel so true this gospel we receive
[1:25:33] life
[1:25:34] Alleluia what happened he became us that
[1:25:37] we can become him Alleluia today in a
[1:25:40] world we find that you have many great
[1:25:43] men in a world today and they want to
[1:25:46] become God they want to take God's
[1:25:50] position but I want to tell you
[1:25:52] something it's only one God became man
[1:25:56] hallelujah
[1:25:57] Hakan descend that he can save us from
[1:26:00] our sins and that was the fulfil it was
[1:26:02] to conserve his purpose hallelujah
[1:26:06] because we come to realize the blood of
[1:26:09] bulls and of boot cannot fulfill that
[1:26:13] position it was just for a time it was
[1:26:17] just for a season and there was still a
[1:26:19] heavy conscience but when Christ Jesus
[1:26:21] came hallelujah it was once and for all
[1:26:24] by the grace of a Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:26:27] Christ so saints of God we don't have
[1:26:30] nothing to
[1:26:31] about we just have to believe the Word
[1:26:36] of God we just have to trust in him with
[1:26:40] all of her heart and all her soul with
[1:26:41] all her strength because there is grace
[1:26:43] in a word of God for his people
[1:26:46] hallelujah we need to stay with a word
[1:26:48] of God because his his life that is
[1:26:50] being placed in us and if God's life is
[1:26:53] in us then saints of God no matter how
[1:26:54] the devil tried to take your life he
[1:26:56] can't because when job was in a
[1:27:00] condition the devil was walking to and
[1:27:02] fro up and down the earth and God said
[1:27:04] you consider my servant job look at the
[1:27:06] EAC yeah because you put a hedge around
[1:27:08] him because you give him a good wife and
[1:27:10] churn and you give him wealth and
[1:27:11] everything that is why he's serving you
[1:27:14] so there was a challenge it was not job
[1:27:17] was doing anything wrong in his life but
[1:27:19] sometimes God is a showdown between God
[1:27:22] and the devil and God uses you as the
[1:27:25] part I loo in knowing that what he does
[1:27:28] how lujah that you're his sons and his
[1:27:30] daughters do you know the prod of God
[1:27:32] says one time he says we thank God and
[1:27:34] they're men and women that can live so
[1:27:36] close to God that the devil don't know
[1:27:37] what to do that I want to be that kind
[1:27:40] of person that we can live so close to
[1:27:42] God you know why because God preserve
[1:27:44] his own purpose
[1:27:46] he conserved to his own purpose things
[1:27:48] of God and nothing can destroy God's
[1:27:50] purpose hallelujah so we come to
[1:27:53] recognize that what happened the devil
[1:27:57] tried everything with Joel
[1:27:59] hallelujah took away all his wealth and
[1:28:02] everything that he had and even his
[1:28:04] children and everything and job said the
[1:28:06] Lord giveth and the Lord taketh blessed
[1:28:10] be the name of the Lord ever say what
[1:28:12] all this I'd done in this man still
[1:28:14] serving God Saints Oh God
[1:28:16] the way of a believer ought to confuse
[1:28:19] the enemy that he don't know what to do
[1:28:22] saints of God when we can feed upon the
[1:28:24] Word of God hallelujah then we know our
[1:28:27] position in him what our that we're
[1:28:30] living in we need to thank God for grace
[1:28:32] in a message watchman what of the night
[1:28:35] 58 11:30 paragraph 20 he says now where
[1:28:40] are we in the day that we live can turn
[1:28:43] into the pages of this blessed
[1:28:45] word and find a very thing that he said
[1:28:47] would take place approaching on the
[1:28:50] earth today the signs and the wonders
[1:28:52] are taking place men's hearts are
[1:28:55] failing for fear we see that is
[1:28:57] happening we see there's so many many
[1:29:00] earthquakes all across the nation around
[1:29:02] the world we in Guyana we are not far
[1:29:06] away from the earthquakes and we never
[1:29:07] really had no kind of tremors are not
[1:29:09] quake but just about a month ago we had
[1:29:11] one just the tail end coming from
[1:29:13] Venezuela about a 7.3 and I was sitting
[1:29:16] in a chair I want to know how the place
[1:29:18] is shaking and I see how everything was
[1:29:20] going like that
[1:29:21] I said well God you know is everything
[1:29:23] but a proud of God tells us that when we
[1:29:25] see these things are happening it is
[1:29:27] only a buzzer to let us know that a
[1:29:30] coming of the Lord is near we should not
[1:29:32] be afraid when we hear about these what
[1:29:35] we call it the Hurricanes and it
[1:29:37] tournedos on all these different thing
[1:29:39] is so not for us to be afraid but for us
[1:29:42] to look up because a Redemption draweth
[1:29:44] nigh so what we seeing here
[1:29:46] he said the signs and our wonders are
[1:29:49] taking place and men's hearts are
[1:29:51] failing for fear if you don't have the
[1:29:53] Holy Ghost in you then all kind of fear
[1:29:55] going to take you over
[1:29:57] Alleluia so there is a perplexity of
[1:30:01] time and distress between nations
[1:30:04] fearful sights in the sky like flying
[1:30:06] saucers the Pentagon all stirred up and
[1:30:09] the sea are roaring and earthquake in
[1:30:12] divert places sometimes we'd in a day
[1:30:14] they say they're over 50 tremors are out
[1:30:16] quickly Kennedy could you imagine that I
[1:30:20] long ago you can know you hear art quit
[1:30:23] now and many years after then you hear
[1:30:25] one but a rapidity of things it's coming
[1:30:28] on because you know why the whole earth
[1:30:30] the creation is groaning the witness the
[1:30:32] manifestation of the sons of God since
[1:30:35] ago we got to come into our position the
[1:30:37] word is bringing us into that place we
[1:30:39] by ourselves can't do that that is why
[1:30:42] we need to feed upon this word of God
[1:30:44] that he has given unto us hallelujah so
[1:30:48] the Pentagon stores see roaring
[1:30:51] earthquake divert place remains hearts
[1:30:52] of fearing of falling in fear
[1:30:55] great atomic weapons setting waiting
[1:30:59] and more than this which is worst of all
[1:31:01] a gloom hanging on the earth that the
[1:31:06] world has never witnessed before it is
[1:31:10] so difficult for people to serve God for
[1:31:13] Pele to prey on all these things they're
[1:31:15] just in a casual position and a buckless
[1:31:18] so raging saints of God that is why as
[1:31:21] we see that they approaching we ought to
[1:31:22] be in fellowship we ought to be more and
[1:31:25] more in the house of God because Satan
[1:31:27] is raging what a Word of God says when
[1:31:29] the enemy comes in like a flood there's
[1:31:32] a standard that is being raised up
[1:31:33] against it and that is the very this is
[1:31:35] the ravine word a message every hour
[1:31:37] that God has given unto us it has
[1:31:39] everything to take us true we don't have
[1:31:42] to look for nothing more to come this is
[1:31:44] already a vindicated message hallelujah
[1:31:47] I don't have to do things to see the the
[1:31:49] pillar of cloud or the light before me
[1:31:51] to know that this message is real it has
[1:31:53] already been vindicated or what we after
[1:31:55] this to believe the Word of God and He
[1:31:57] will take care of the rest of everything
[1:31:59] hallelujah so a groom is hanging on the
[1:32:01] earth that a world has never witnessed
[1:32:04] before this should not make us be afraid
[1:32:07] but we should believe the Word of God
[1:32:09] because the promise is being given on to
[1:32:11] us on and to our children and even to
[1:32:13] those that are far off saints of God
[1:32:15] that God will preserve his heritage God
[1:32:19] will take care of all everything that he
[1:32:21] has upon the face of the earth there is
[1:32:23] nothing for us to worry about a lawyer
[1:32:26] all what we need to do is to stay with a
[1:32:29] word for the hour that God has provided
[1:32:32] for us hallelujah how many you willing
[1:32:34] to stay with a message of the other it
[1:32:36] cannot fail God cannot fail his word
[1:32:39] can't fail so if God can't feel his word
[1:32:42] can't feel a new part of God you're
[1:32:44] gonna feel there is no failure and sons
[1:32:46] and daughters of God I look God never
[1:32:49] say much to lose us
[1:32:50] I look God is not enough profit and lost
[1:32:52] business we do business and we have a
[1:32:55] profit and loss
[1:32:56] Alleluia but God all things are possible
[1:33:00] to them that believe it hallelujah you
[1:33:04] know in a message hear his voice the
[1:33:06] proud of God was telling us of the
[1:33:07] mother Eagle that's how you know
[1:33:10] powerful she is and there
[1:33:12] is no worry for those little Eagles
[1:33:14] because when the coyote comes and tried
[1:33:17] to take one of those little one what a
[1:33:19] mother Eagle does she will fly down and
[1:33:21] swoop them and take him up and probably
[1:33:24] take him a thousand feet up in the air
[1:33:26] and loose him on the cliffs and when he
[1:33:30] hit there are lujah is gonna be smash to
[1:33:34] Smith or be disintegrated I'll do it so
[1:33:37] there's not interfere so he was saying
[1:33:39] here that nothing going to bother them
[1:33:42] little ones are we not little ones
[1:33:45] hallelujah
[1:33:46] so he says she's going to see to it the
[1:33:50] product God says nothing is going to
[1:33:52] bother them little ones nothing gonna
[1:33:54] bother you don't be scared to take God
[1:33:58] at His Word he said we should not be a
[1:34:01] scared to take out of this word are you
[1:34:04] scared to take God at His Word many
[1:34:06] times we may have things in our lives
[1:34:08] but a part of God says we have to
[1:34:11] separate from our feelings between our
[1:34:13] feelings and our faith so if you take
[1:34:16] God at this word you don't think about
[1:34:17] how you feel you think about what the
[1:34:19] Word of God says because I say feelings
[1:34:22] and emotion comes and goes but when you
[1:34:25] take God at His Word and you believe
[1:34:26] God's Word everything that is contrary
[1:34:29] that a Word of God has to depart from
[1:34:31] our lives
[1:34:32] hallelujah so the part of God says just
[1:34:35] relax can you relax in the presence of
[1:34:39] God in your situation that you're going
[1:34:41] through he says just relax have faith
[1:34:44] and believe that he is watching over you
[1:34:50] it's not man watching over us hallelujah
[1:34:54] is not the federal or the police or the
[1:34:56] government or the FBI or the CIA or the
[1:34:58] KGB is the Holy Ghost as God himself so
[1:35:03] nothing can destroy you
[1:35:05] he said he's watching over you and the
[1:35:08] proud of God many say well he just had a
[1:35:11] seventh grade education but some words
[1:35:13] that he used you got to go in a
[1:35:14] dictionary to find it hallelujah is not
[1:35:17] true
[1:35:17] he says it's he is watching over you he
[1:35:21] will disintegrate anything that tries to
[1:35:26] you Alleluia what is the D centigrade to
[1:35:30] break into components or fragments
[1:35:34] Alleluia or breaking something into
[1:35:37] small pieces or constituent part to
[1:35:41] destroy the cohesion or unity are the
[1:35:46] wholeness of something or undergoes such
[1:35:49] destruction and we commonly use a term
[1:35:52] blow to smithereens
[1:35:54] Alleluia so he says he is watching over
[1:35:57] you
[1:35:58] he was disintegrate anything that tries
[1:36:01] to bother you
[1:36:02] he says well it might attack you but it
[1:36:07] can't harm you the devil is like a
[1:36:10] roaring lion seeking whom may devour
[1:36:13] he might attack you but he can't harm
[1:36:15] you and since of God are you thankful
[1:36:17] today it doesn't matter what the devil
[1:36:19] tried to do to you that you're the apple
[1:36:22] of God's eye and you're conservative on
[1:36:25] purpose so we should not be afraid to
[1:36:28] worship God we should not be afraid to
[1:36:30] serve Him in the fullness of life that
[1:36:33] he is given hallelujah oh it might
[1:36:37] attack you but it can't harm you for all
[1:36:40] things he permits it it could be nothing
[1:36:45] else for it's working together for good
[1:36:48] to them that love the Lord no harm can
[1:36:52] come to you so since of God no harm can
[1:36:56] come to you it's conserved his own
[1:36:58] purpose Isaiah 59 19 tells us so shall
[1:37:04] they fear the name of the Lord from the
[1:37:07] West and His glory from his rising of
[1:37:10] the Sun when the enemy shall come in
[1:37:13] like a flood the Spirit of God will
[1:37:15] raise the Spirit of God or the Spirit of
[1:37:18] the Lord shall lift up a standard
[1:37:20] against him what a hope or a confidence
[1:37:24] that God has given unto us that we have
[1:37:28] hope in this hour that we are living in
[1:37:30] Psalms 23:4 it's a very familiar little
[1:37:34] portion of Scripture yea though I walk
[1:37:36] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:37:38] death
[1:37:39] I will fear no evil for thou art with me
[1:37:43] thy rod and thy staff and they comfort
[1:37:46] me
[1:37:46] so what a mighty God we are serving
[1:37:49] today saints of God Alleluia we should
[1:37:52] give him all the praise and the times of
[1:37:53] what he had done for us in this hour
[1:37:56] Alleluia he will disintegrate anything
[1:37:59] that tries to bother us this morning
[1:38:02] Alleluia we have a we have a glorious
[1:38:04] hope as his people this gospel is only
[1:38:08] for a trillant saints of God when the
[1:38:10] seals were open
[1:38:12] there was still a supernatural
[1:38:14] elementary name Alleluia and only the
[1:38:17] true Bride of Christ can catch that
[1:38:19] because it is not open to the
[1:38:22] intellectuals it is open to those that
[1:38:24] are faith in the Word of God and in 2nd
[1:38:28] Corinthians chapter four verses three
[1:38:30] the seven tells us but if our gospel be
[1:38:34] hid it is hid to them that are lost are
[1:38:38] too thankful to know that your recipient
[1:38:41] of God's love and in this day you can
[1:38:43] receive the message of the hour Alleluia
[1:38:47] praise God in whom the god of this world
[1:38:50] has blinded the minds of them which
[1:38:53] believe not who's the god of this world
[1:38:57] kahlan god of this evil age lest the
[1:39:00] light of the glorious gospel of Christ
[1:39:02] who's an image of God should shine unto
[1:39:04] them for we preach not ourselves but
[1:39:08] Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves as
[1:39:11] servants for Jesus sake for God who
[1:39:14] commanded the light to shine out of
[1:39:16] darkness that shine in our hearts to
[1:39:20] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:39:22] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[1:39:26] but we have this treasure in earthen
[1:39:29] vessels that the excellence of power may
[1:39:33] be of God and not of us we thank God
[1:39:38] that the purpose of God truly saints of
[1:39:43] God
[1:39:44] it stands in election
[1:39:49] that is where the purpose of God stands
[1:39:51] and we were elected chosen of God before
[1:39:54] the foundation of the world and because
[1:39:56] of that you know because of
[1:39:58] predestination many times people have
[1:39:59] the wrong understanding of
[1:40:01] predestination is the OM predestinated
[1:40:03] of God and you know God loved me so much
[1:40:05] I could do anything
[1:40:06] oh wait if God loved you would not God
[1:40:10] you can't do anything you could only do
[1:40:12] what God will have you to do if you're
[1:40:14] truly predestinated of God you will not
[1:40:16] want to do anything that is contrary
[1:40:18] from the will of God because that seed
[1:40:21] of God in you cannot sin it will not
[1:40:23] allow you to go contrary when you see
[1:40:26] things are contrary something is
[1:40:28] contrary with their lives and you need
[1:40:30] to come back the Calvary you need to
[1:40:32] come back to the altar to recognize that
[1:40:34] something is not really right that is
[1:40:37] why we need to stay with a fullness of
[1:40:39] the word that God has given unto us
[1:40:41] saints of God without the shedding of
[1:40:44] blood there is no remission of sins and
[1:40:46] we come to recognize the grace of God
[1:40:49] because the first coat that I read
[1:40:51] before in the saddest in church age it
[1:40:54] was telling us first of all we know
[1:40:56] Moses shortly that a purpose of God
[1:40:59] stand in election hallelujah and it was
[1:41:04] the purpose in himself it was God's
[1:41:07] purpose to bring further people unto
[1:41:10] himself that would be a word bride not a
[1:41:15] world bride not a worldly bride but a
[1:41:18] word bride since of God there might be
[1:41:21] many brides but there's only one bride
[1:41:23] that is coming for and that's the word
[1:41:25] bride
[1:41:26] Alleluia she was chosen before the
[1:41:28] foundation of the world in him she was
[1:41:35] foreknown and she was beloved before she
[1:41:39] was ever brought forth saints of God we
[1:41:41] should be a happy thankful people to
[1:41:43] know that before years brought forth we
[1:41:45] were loved
[1:41:46] so what could really change that if you
[1:41:52] know before your daily is delight you
[1:41:55] know we could turn I think it's proverbs
[1:41:58] chapter it
[1:42:49] in proverbs chapter 8 we can read from
[1:42:54] verses 22 it says probably 22 the Lord
[1:43:03] possess me in the beginning of his ways
[1:43:08] before the works of old I was set up
[1:43:13] from everlasting from the beginning or
[1:43:17] ever the art was when there were no
[1:43:21] depths I was brought forth when there
[1:43:25] were no fun things abounding with water
[1:43:28] before the mountains were settled before
[1:43:33] the hills was I brought food while as
[1:43:38] yet he had not made the earth nor the
[1:43:42] fields nor the highest part of the dust
[1:43:46] of the world when he prepared the
[1:43:48] heavens I was there when he said he come
[1:43:52] pass upon the face of the earth when he
[1:43:55] established the clouds above when he
[1:43:58] strengthened of Fountains of the deep
[1:44:00] very gifted us see his decree that a
[1:44:04] water should not pass his commandment
[1:44:06] many appointed of foundations of the
[1:44:09] earth then I was by him as one brought
[1:44:14] up at him
[1:44:15] and what I was daily his delight
[1:44:20] rejoicing in him all ways before him
[1:44:25] rejoicing in a habit in the habitable
[1:44:27] part of who of his earth and my delights
[1:44:32] were it met with the sons of man he says
[1:44:36] no hearken unto me o eat children 4
[1:44:39] blessed are they that keep or keep my
[1:44:42] ways here instruction and be wise and
[1:44:46] not refuse it and not refuse I'll it not
[1:44:51] blessed is the man that here at me
[1:44:55] watching daily at my gates waiting at a
[1:44:58] post of my doors for whoso
[1:45:01] find at me find at life and shall obtain
[1:45:04] favor of the Lord but he that sin it
[1:45:08] against me wrong at his own soul
[1:45:12] Alleluia all day that hate me love death
[1:45:15] so if we were daily his delight scenes
[1:45:20] of God and we were worshiping him and we
[1:45:23] were praising him and everything was
[1:45:25] happening what happened now
[1:45:30] we should be the same way worshiping and
[1:45:33] praising God time should not change our
[1:45:35] position in him i loo about coming
[1:45:38] through in the Adamic way in the Adamic
[1:45:40] nature god had a appropriate way for us
[1:45:43] Alleluia
[1:45:44] through the foolishness of the preaching
[1:45:46] of the gospel to bring us back into our
[1:45:48] consciousness hallelujah because God
[1:45:50] always conserves his purpose and nothing
[1:45:53] cannot stop the purpose of God because
[1:45:56] isaiah 426 said this is the purpose that
[1:45:59] is purpose upon the whole earth and this
[1:46:03] is the hands that is stretched out upon
[1:46:06] all nations for the Lord of Hosts had
[1:46:09] purpose and who shall die so knowledge
[1:46:12] and his hands stretched out on who shall
[1:46:17] turn it mark so there's a purpose for
[1:46:19] God and God's purpose and as time it
[1:46:22] season and these are people and we are
[1:46:25] the special peculiar people in this hour
[1:46:27] that God has chosen to be part of his
[1:46:30] bride hallelujah in this part of United
[1:46:33] States and Baton God for grace that is
[1:46:36] conserved to serve his purpose how many
[1:46:40] of us this day are truly serving God's
[1:46:43] purpose scenes of God God has is
[1:46:46] provided we we should never allow
[1:46:48] nothing to stop us because we can never
[1:46:53] come into judgment we have already
[1:46:55] passed from judgment unto life because
[1:47:00] of the grace of God the word his people
[1:47:02] today in the hour that we are living in
[1:47:04] and we got to come to realize that he
[1:47:07] had made us more than conquerors and our
[1:47:11] fate rests in the
[1:47:14] teretha the Word of God in the hour that
[1:47:16] we are living in the saints of God let
[1:47:19] us stay with a word of God and if you
[1:47:21] could come to recognize our position in
[1:47:24] Christ Jesus recognizing our purpose
[1:47:27] then we're gonna serve God in a way that
[1:47:30] he would want us to serve Him
