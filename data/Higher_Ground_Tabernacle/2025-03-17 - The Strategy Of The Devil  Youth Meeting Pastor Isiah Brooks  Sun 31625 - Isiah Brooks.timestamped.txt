[44:49] fire y understand what I'm saying it's
[44:52] not a put on it's a come on when you

[44:59] yourself and I tell you what when if you
[45:01] praise God more you find out the devil
[45:04] wouldn't want to be around you Satan
[45:07] hates
[45:08] fire and the more fire you got the least
[45:13] amount of problems you have amen so
[45:15] we're going to do a a message we're not
[45:17] going to sing we're just going to do
[45:19] we've done enough singing But I want to
[45:21] say this by the grace of God you are
[45:23] beautiful
[45:24] people God has chosen you God has
[45:27] elected you to be here and I'm grateful
[45:29] to the Lord that he has allowed me to
[45:32] talk to his bride or to preach to his
[45:33] bride what an
[45:35] honor and uh you never bother sometimes
[45:38] I get
[45:39] busy I wish I was more than one man but
[45:42] I am not I'm just one but I do the best
[45:46] that I can as we stand let us read the
[45:48] word of God according to Genesis 3r
[45:54] chapter we know that it's not in the
[45:57] emotions but I'm glad I've got
[46:00] some you know that's why God God liking
[46:03] us as Gentile dogs you know that one
[46:06] thing about a dog they full of
[46:09] emotions right right one little thing I
[46:12] love to see a dog do is eat there's
[46:16] nothing like a dog eating how many of
[46:19] y'all can say amen amen when they get to
[46:21] eating and they start licking their lips
[46:23] and you know all of that I like that you
[46:25] hear all the sound too it that sounds
[46:28] crazy but I see
[46:31] myself as a dog enjoying the word of
[46:35] God Amen you're supposed to lick it all
[46:38] up by the grace of God Genesis the 3
[46:41] chapter beginning at the sixth verse
[46:44] we'll read the sixth and seventh
[46:46] verse I'm going to try not to be long if
[46:49] there be any kind of questions you were
[46:51] supposed to write them in but if they're
[46:53] not difficult I wouldn't mind answering
[46:56] them if they're are
[46:57] some um we appreciate everybody's coming
[47:02] especially those from Iowa City that's a
[47:04] long ride especially when you're tired
[47:07] but we thank God for your being here by
[47:09] the grace of God Genesis the 3
[47:13] chapter good to see our brother Charles
[47:16] we we've been really missing each
[47:18] other I teased him a little bit like
[47:20] what's your name but I always will
[47:23] remember his name Genesis the 3r chapter
[47:26] 6 through 7th verse and when the woman
[47:29] saw that the tree was good for food and
[47:34] that it was pleasant to the eyes and a
[47:37] tree to be desired to make one wise she
[47:41] took up the fruit thereof and did eat
[47:44] and gave also unto her husband with her
[47:48] and he did eat in their eyes of them
[47:51] both were open and they knew that they
[47:53] were naked and they saw fig leaves
[47:57] together and made themselves aprons 1
[48:01] Corinthians
[48:03] 1013
[48:11] please 1 Corinthians
[48:13] 10:13 there hath no temptation taken you
[48:18] but such as is common to
[48:21] man but God is faithful who will not
[48:25] suffer you to be temp temped above that
[48:28] ye are
[48:29] able but with the Temptation also make a
[48:33] way of escape to escape so every time we
[48:36] fall into temptation God has already
[48:38] made the Escape we just choose not to
[48:41] take the Escape
[48:43] roote that ye may be able to Bear it
[48:46] because he said he wouldn't put no more
[48:48] on us than we could bear let us pray
[48:50] father God we thank you for your grace
[48:52] we thank you for your mercy we thank you
[48:54] for all that you do for us Lord you've
[48:57] been better to us than we have been to
[48:58] ourselves we pray Lord God that the
[49:00] young people will be blessed this
[49:02] evening give us wisdom give us Grace
[49:05] give us understanding not with our head
[49:07] but with our hearts may we see Lord God
[49:10] the tactics of the devil may we see the
[49:12] enemy who is our foe not our brother not
[49:14] our sister but uh evil spirit that have
[49:17] come against the bride of Christ and we
[49:20] pray father God that you would bless us
[49:22] that we may see and understand and not
[49:25] only that be a doer of the word we ask
[49:27] these things in your name Jesus Christ
[49:29] we pray amen you may be
[49:39] seated I'd like to entitle this little
[49:42] subject the
[49:44] strategy of the
[49:51] devil the strategy of the devil
[49:56] and it just started in the Garden of
[49:59] Eden we know that first of all Lucifer
[50:02] deceived the third of the heavens there
[50:05] and as brother brandham said he brought
[50:06] it down into the Garden of Eden and Adam
[50:11] had to fight the enemy of course the
[50:14] woman being the weaker
[50:16] vessel by way of her creation God
[50:20] purposely did it that way as we
[50:23] understand because God want to be a
[50:25] savior Redeemer is not to look at the
[50:28] woman as if she's nothing but you must
[50:31] understand that she was placed in that
[50:32] position by
[50:34] God and reality is without her falling
[50:41] we would have never known what
[50:42] Redemption would be
[50:43] like so God had a purpose for everything
[50:47] it doesn't make Eve so evil right right
[50:50] but God knew before the foundation of
[50:52] the world what she was going to do he
[50:54] made it
[50:55] so God doesn't force people but he puts
[50:59] you in a position to make choices and he
[51:03] already know what your choice is going
[51:05] to be this is what grace and mercy is
[51:08] all
[51:09] about I don't know whether you ever
[51:11] heard of Snow White in the Seven Dwarf
[51:13] you'all ever heard of that story it's a
[51:16] simple story it's a worldly
[51:18] story but you remember uh uh uh how Snow
[51:22] White I believe it was Snow White maybe
[51:25] it was somebody else but I get a up but
[51:27] anyway was deceived I think it was
[51:30] sleeping beauty is what I'm thinking
[51:32] about the one who was deceived by the
[51:34] Apple but the point is that Satan always
[51:37] Snow White right in the seven dwar yeah
[51:40] the people you know Satan always puts
[51:42] something before
[51:44] you to tempt
[51:47] you Eve had no idea she she she followed
[51:51] through with his
[51:53] temptation with his lust this is what
[51:56] I'm working with
[51:57] anybody know what lust is I'm so glad it
[52:00] should have had
[52:02] 100% because there's not one of you in
[52:04] here that doesn't know what lust
[52:06] is especially when you come into that
[52:09] age of accountability that age where you
[52:11] CH from 12 to CH from 12 to
[52:14] 13 and some of us have found out what
[52:16] that is or was before we even reached
[52:18] that
[52:19] age and you got got to understand that a
[52:22] lot of things are passed on through your
[52:24] DNA things that you didn't even know was
[52:27] there or would discover later on in your
[52:29] life but it's h it happened to come
[52:33] up now I'm going to tell you the truth
[52:36] because of lust that's why I'm saved
[52:39] that's
[52:40] right it was the lust that had control
[52:43] of me so much so that I knew if I didn't
[52:47] kill somebody somebody else was going to
[52:48] kill me it was just that bad it was
[52:51] totally out of control maybe some of you
[52:55] have never been there but I'm going tell
[52:57] you something that's not a good place to
[52:59] be but here was
[53:02] Eve and she
[53:04] fell but one of the things that really
[53:06] got me is because all of a sudden they
[53:08] understood that they were
[53:10] naked and I love the fact they tried to
[53:15] fix
[53:16] it you know and that's how it is with us
[53:19] we tried to fix it but religion won't
[53:22] fix
[53:24] it you got to have the blood of Jesus us
[53:27] only God can fix
[53:30] this you can't you can't control your
[53:32] flesh I don't care how strong your will
[53:34] is right that's right it's going to take
[53:37] more than a human will that's right to
[53:39] defeat Satan y'all understand what I'm
[53:42] saying and my point is that we're not
[53:44] here to judge one another cuz
[53:46] everybody's fire has a different
[53:50] temperature y'all know what I'm saying
[53:53] so we understand but the Bible said with
[53:55] all the tempt ation it's a common
[53:59] thing it's a common thing but you know
[54:02] when we do fall to to to the flesh it
[54:06] shames us It embarrasses us it weakens
[54:11] us it do you know what I'm talking about
[54:14] and how many times you have and I have
[54:18] said to the Lord I'm not going to do it
[54:22] anymore and of course we respond to God
[54:25] basically as the way Adam and Eve did we
[54:29] throw our religion on thinking that
[54:32] because I know brother brandom is a
[54:34] messenger because I'm in the message I'm
[54:37] not going to do it
[54:39] anymore and the fact is you don't want
[54:42] nobody else to know that's right and so
[54:45] when you hide
[54:47] it only God knows you're
[54:50] hiding y y'all hear what I'm saying as I
[54:53] said this morning the most spiritual you
[54:57] are the more demon powers that's going
[55:00] to fight
[55:01] you right and the reason being it
[55:05] because you have a
[55:06] purpose and it is Satan job young people
[55:10] to stop
[55:11] you from fulfilling that
[55:15] purpose that's nothing but the truth and
[55:19] many of you may even think that there's
[55:20] nothing to me I'm just a believe I'm
[55:22] just raised up in the message but let me
[55:24] tell you something there there are
[55:26] millions of people that would love to
[55:29] take your
[55:30] place if they knew what you POS
[55:34] possessed sir never throw away what you
[55:38] have and this like like the promised
[55:40] land you can't stay at Jericho you can't
[55:44] stay with just crossing over the river
[55:47] Jordan you got to move into the land
[55:50] amen and in the land there's Giants
[55:53] there sir there's Canaanite parasites
[55:57] jebusites and every kind of I there is
[56:01] and all of those demon powers represents
[56:04] your
[56:06] flesh and God said go in there and
[56:08] conquer the land is that not what he
[56:11] told uh Adam sedo the
[56:14] land now your land is your body you've
[56:17] got to sedo it now we understand that
[56:21] the weapon of our Warfare are not
[56:24] carnal right yes so what is he saying
[56:28] when somebody Falls or when somebody
[56:30] offends you or when somebody you know uh
[56:32] do something that you don't like you got
[56:35] to recognize that somebody is the
[56:38] devil that's right amen is that the
[56:40] truth it's not the individual you don't
[56:42] help listen you're on the same
[56:45] side and Satan if he could get the same
[56:48] soldiers fighting each
[56:51] other you already
[56:53] defeated because the Bible said a house
[56:57] divided cannot
[56:59] stand you got some people from Iowa City
[57:02] some people from De Mo but you still
[57:08] family hey y'all understand what I'm
[57:10] saying let me tell you something and and
[57:13] I want I I don't want to equate this to
[57:16] my experience but it was an experience
[57:18] when I was in the denomination we had
[57:20] people who was in the city of Lugoff we
[57:23] had a uh people who was in the city of
[57:25] Denmark but when the young people came
[57:28] together we were
[57:31] together we never thought about you
[57:33] being in DeMark or you being in the
[57:35] other place we all were one we enjoyed
[57:39] each other
[57:41] Fellowship y'all looking at me some of
[57:43] y'all but I'm trying to tell you you
[57:46] must put your differences down and
[57:49] recognize that you all are one people
[57:53] washed in the blood of the Lamb
[57:56] can I say this not being
[57:59] disrespectful but your tribe means
[58:02] nothing to
[58:04] God where you came from means nothing to
[58:07] God he's only concerned about where you
[58:12] going youall understand me I I I know
[58:16] how the elders
[58:17] think but if the elders are thinking
[58:20] different uh than the
[58:22] word the word has preeminence
[58:29] now I'm going say it that's what Miriam
[58:32] got in
[58:33] trouble because Moses married an
[58:35] Ethiopian woman yes sir yes sir
[58:40] what and God did not like
[58:44] that now I'm going tell you I know some
[58:46] of y'all so indoctrinated y'all think
[58:48] I'm crazy but maybe I am I'm crazy for
[58:51] Jesus and I'm crazy enough to say it
[58:54] because he's telling me to say it
[58:56] and so I want you to understand I'm not
[58:58] telling you to disrespect your parents
[59:00] but when it comes to the word of God the
[59:02] word of God Is
[59:05] Right all by itself now the Bible said
[59:09] we for the weapon of our Warfare are not
[59:13] carnal Hallelujah But Mighty through God
[59:16] to the pulling down of the strongholds
[59:19] that means strongholds just don't
[59:21] fall you got to pull them down yes sir
[59:25] pull them down where
[59:27] in your
[59:28] mind the thing is when Satan comes with
[59:31] you to a evil thought you don't rebuke
[59:34] it cuz nobody sees you and sometimes you
[59:38] entertain it and once you entertain it
[59:41] guess what you're going to in eventually
[59:44] give birth that's right to a habit or a
[59:47] demon
[59:49] habit you got to bind that
[59:52] thing sometimes the only like I said
[59:55] this morning sometimes the only time
[59:56] thing you can do is give God a
[59:59] praise when Satan comes with a thought
[1:00:02] thank you Jesus you know ain't nothing
[1:00:04] wrong with looking
[1:00:05] crazy I'd rather look crazy than to have
[1:00:08] Satan plant something in my head and
[1:00:10] then it becomes uh you know I become
[1:00:13] impregnated with that thought and then
[1:00:15] bring forth a
[1:00:17] devil after lust is
[1:00:22] conceived it bring forth sin
[1:00:26] and sin bring forth what
[1:00:28] death his whole purpose is to destroy
[1:00:33] you this is not about um
[1:00:37] religion it is not it's about salvation
[1:00:41] it's about you being the children the
[1:00:43] daughters and sons of God and Satan has
[1:00:46] attacked it to stop you for fulfilling
[1:00:49] the word now I'm going say it like this
[1:00:53] he might even mess with you bring you a
[1:00:56] place like he did
[1:00:58] Samson was Samson did Samson have a
[1:01:03] problem come on and brothers don't even
[1:01:06] tell me if you're a real red blooded man
[1:01:08] don't tell me that worldly women don't
[1:01:10] look
[1:01:14] Goodtime if you say that you lie or
[1:01:16] something wrong with
[1:01:19] you cuz that Delilah I don't know what
[1:01:23] she look like but Delilah made Samson
[1:01:26] forget about who he
[1:01:30] was and can I say it like this sometime
[1:01:33] y'all sisters can dress in a way that
[1:01:37] will make the sons of God forget their
[1:01:39] sons of God
[1:01:41] right right brothers
[1:01:44] too that's right come on Brothers some
[1:01:48] sometimes it's so tight the children
[1:01:49] have to the sisters have to turn their
[1:01:52] head it ain't just the women it's the
[1:01:55] brothers
[1:01:57] too that's
[1:01:59] right it's the truth and the Bible says
[1:02:03] are not we our Brother's
[1:02:07] Keeper
[1:02:09] huh see that's why I be honest with Y
[1:02:12] y'all know I'm honest the way some
[1:02:14] people they do the dance and everything
[1:02:17] I can't handle
[1:02:19] it I'm just telling you the
[1:02:22] truth lust was my
[1:02:24] problem before I got
[1:02:27] saved and your mind doesn't forget
[1:02:30] that's
[1:02:32] right and what look all right to y'all
[1:02:35] to a red blooded
[1:02:39] man Satan be working now I'm telling
[1:02:42] y'all sisters so y'all can understand
[1:02:45] Pastor might act like he ain't seeing
[1:02:47] but I I
[1:02:48] see that's right y'all understand me I
[1:02:51] let me move on by the grace of God my
[1:02:53] wife going to say you give out too much
[1:02:55] information
[1:02:56] but she's not here thank the Lord so I
[1:02:58] can be
[1:02:59] free and say what I want to say because
[1:03:02] all of us are matur
[1:03:05] individuals y'all understand me so I'm
[1:03:08] going to say to the Brethren by
[1:03:10] Nature you are a
[1:03:15] polygamist
[1:03:17] right that's right sisters understand
[1:03:22] that so that
[1:03:24] you understand can I say it like this if
[1:03:27] you're not feeding him at home he'll get
[1:03:29] fed somewhere
[1:03:36] else Holy Ghost don't leave
[1:03:41] me y'all understand what I'm saying you
[1:03:44] have a duty to if you get married to
[1:03:47] make
[1:03:48] sure that
[1:03:53] man is satisfied amen that's
[1:03:58] right after you get married you come out
[1:04:00] come out the uh he do worked all day and
[1:04:03] you come out like you just got out of
[1:04:05] bed with rollers in your head and all
[1:04:06] that kind of
[1:04:07] stuff
[1:04:09] uh-uh

[1:04:25] years so I know know what I'm talking
[1:04:28] about some of y'all don't want to say
[1:04:30] Amen but it is
[1:04:33] amen you got to keep that man unless
[1:04:37] he's truly filled with the Holy
[1:04:40] Ghost y'all H that's why I say you
[1:04:43] shouldn't marry a man that ain't got the
[1:04:44] Holy
[1:04:45] Ghost cuz if he's he ain't got the Holy
[1:04:48] Ghost his his flesh is his
[1:04:50] leader that's right I'm just telling
[1:04:53] you it's a strategy
[1:04:57] and this strategy was used on the first
[1:04:59] woman and man and guess what Satan
[1:05:05] won any man in here stronger than
[1:05:08] Adam you not unless you got the second
[1:05:11] Adam in
[1:05:14] you right but the first Adam produced
[1:05:17] carnal
[1:05:19] children I just want you to know that
[1:05:22] casting down
[1:05:24] imagination and every every High thing
[1:05:26] that exalt itself against the knowledge
[1:05:28] of God and bringing into captivity every
[1:05:32] thought to The Obedience of Christ that
[1:05:34] means everything that you have learned
[1:05:37] that doesn't coincide with the word must
[1:05:40] be brought under
[1:05:43] subjection I don't care if mama taught
[1:05:46] you or daddy taught
[1:05:47] you do y'all know what Idol worshipping
[1:05:51] is I'm going tell you in the simplest
[1:05:54] form sir Idol worship is fornication yes
[1:05:57] sir yes
[1:06:00] sir right same thing amen Israel fought
[1:06:04] read judges Israel fought idolatry and
[1:06:08] fornication the whole time because it's
[1:06:11] the same spirit amen yes sir spiritually
[1:06:15] when you leave God and find an idol you
[1:06:17] have committed fornication yes
[1:06:20] sir naturally you know what that
[1:06:23] is a spirit
[1:06:26] that's why God hated it so much God had
[1:06:29] a good judge then he had a bad judge he
[1:06:31] had a good judge he had a bad judge and
[1:06:33] during judges the Bible said the people
[1:06:36] was right in their own eyes that means
[1:06:39] they were full of
[1:06:40] reasoning amen instead of staying with
[1:06:43] the
[1:06:44] word they were full reasoning isn't that
[1:06:47] true yes sir yes sir the devil say
[1:06:50] surely you shall not die sir and she
[1:06:55] took that reasoning yes and when she
[1:06:58] received the reasoning her eyes were
[1:07:00] open yes sir now she finds the serpent
[1:07:03] attractive yes sir yes sir you
[1:07:07] understand me listen the devil ain't
[1:07:09] going to send you somebody that looks
[1:07:11] like something out of somewhere
[1:07:14] sir God the devil ain't he not going to
[1:07:17] send you somebody that look like an
[1:07:20] alien for the sisters he going to have
[1:07:23] everything you imagine right that's
[1:07:25] right A man should be in your head and
[1:07:29] for the Brethren y'all know what that
[1:07:33] is it's true and don't let her walk by
[1:07:37] you with that
[1:07:39] cologne I'm just
[1:07:41] saying you are working with your senses
[1:07:44] I'm trying to be real listen I'm not
[1:07:47] trying to be funny which I know I can be
[1:07:49] but I'm trying to be real so you can
[1:07:52] understand your
[1:07:53] Warfare this is
[1:07:57] strategy am it's not about just you
[1:08:00] lusting it's not just about you falling
[1:08:02] to the flesh but it's all about Satan
[1:08:05] defeating
[1:08:07] you because what
[1:08:09] happens the more you fall the more you
[1:08:13] hide
[1:08:15] it and the more you hide it the more
[1:08:17] distance God becomes that's right you
[1:08:21] understand me that's why the Bible say
[1:08:23] confess your faults one for another pray
[1:08:25] one for
[1:08:27] another sir yall understand me because
[1:08:30] if you're not careful God the devil will
[1:08:33] have you in a pit you know what I mean a
[1:08:35] deep
[1:08:37] pit is that right that's why David said
[1:08:41] Lord deliver me out of this
[1:08:43] pit right because in a pit nobody can
[1:08:46] see you there but
[1:08:49] you and when you get in that pit it's
[1:08:51] not so easy to get out of because the
[1:08:54] only way you can can get out of this pit
[1:08:56] is through
[1:08:57] confession amen and the devil say what's
[1:09:00] the use of
[1:09:01] confessing you going to do it
[1:09:04] again throw the scripture on
[1:09:07] him a righteous man falls seven times in
[1:09:10] a
[1:09:11] day and he gets up see there is no
[1:09:15] stopping to the bride once your eyes are
[1:09:19] open which I'm trying to do today I'm
[1:09:21] trying to open your eyes to to to to the
[1:09:24] to the Strat of lust right the Bible
[1:09:28] said love not the
[1:09:31] world neither the things of the world
[1:09:34] now the Bible also talks about let me
[1:09:36] back up and after you have done this now
[1:09:38] after you fall and you and you find
[1:09:41] yourself being brought into captivity
[1:09:43] then you you you you find yourself
[1:09:45] acknowledging God back to God back to
[1:09:48] God I don't care how many times I fall
[1:09:50] back to God back to God right but when
[1:09:52] you come back to God the Bible says now
[1:09:54] you must Revenge all
[1:09:58] Disobedience that means you got to take
[1:10:00] measures never to do it
[1:10:02] again
[1:10:04] Hallelujah
[1:10:06] right it's like going to the liquor
[1:10:08] store and saying I ain't going to buy no
[1:10:10] liquor y'all know what look is whiskey
[1:10:14] yeah especially if you had a problem
[1:10:17] drinking there ain't no way you're going
[1:10:18] to go to a liquor store and not be
[1:10:22] influenced but nowadays we don't have to
[1:10:24] do that we can go to the
[1:10:28] mall and fulfill all the lust of the
[1:10:33] eye y'all looking at me like I'm crazy
[1:10:37] but people of God I'm telling you
[1:10:38] because I know what I'm talking
[1:10:41] about I've been
[1:10:43] guilty and every man on Earth has been
[1:10:46] guilty
[1:10:48] amen married man and
[1:10:50] all come on
[1:10:53] somebody until God have full control of
[1:10:57] you your
[1:10:59] flesh is going to make you know I'm
[1:11:02] alive and
[1:11:03] well oh y'all I hope you're thinking and
[1:11:07] not just understand what I'm trying to
[1:11:10] do for
[1:11:11] you because I'm going tell you something
[1:11:13] you can be a pope or priest and you can
[1:11:15] go to a
[1:11:17] monastery and the devil going to show up
[1:11:19] you know why he going to show up cuz you
[1:11:22] brought him
[1:11:23] there the devil is in your flesh
[1:11:28] right and you don't think the devil
[1:11:31] watches
[1:11:32] you he watch you Just Like Jesus Does
[1:11:35] say prove that for the
[1:11:37] scripture God says to Jo to the devil
[1:11:40] have you considered my servant
[1:11:44] Jo yeah and God the devil said yeah Lord
[1:11:49] but I can't get to him cuz you protect
[1:11:51] him you got a hedge about him don't you
[1:11:54] like that
[1:11:55] I like the idea that God had a hedge
[1:11:58] about me and Satan couldn't get to me
[1:12:01] but then there's a this is a thing God
[1:12:03] had a purpose for
[1:12:05] job job in all of his riches and all of
[1:12:08] his pleasure all of his peace with God
[1:12:10] he had no idea God was making plans for
[1:12:15] him to suffer and that's where we get in
[1:12:18] this in all things give thanks to the
[1:12:22] Lord because God everything is moving by
[1:12:26] the power of God you see all the
[1:12:29] hardships and everything that I've gone
[1:12:31] through listen what makes you think why
[1:12:35] you love
[1:12:36] God why have you tried to quit at times
[1:12:39] but you
[1:12:42] can't cuz there's something in your
[1:12:44] heart deeper than you
[1:12:49] amen I've had backsliders tell me
[1:12:52] they're
[1:12:53] miserable cuz even when they try to sin
[1:12:56] God is always
[1:12:58] there he is he said I'll never leave you
[1:13:02] nor will I forsake you sir you say well
[1:13:05] prove that to me was not God in Babylon
[1:13:10] yes sir and he told Israel you better
[1:13:13] obey the kingdom the king and when you
[1:13:16] put in in there they you'll be
[1:13:19] slaves but I still make you prosper sir
[1:13:23] oh come on if you obedient
[1:13:25] I will prosper you am in other words
[1:13:28] this is my
[1:13:31] doing you understand me and wherever you
[1:13:35] find yourself I want you to understand
[1:13:38] there's a purpose and somebody's
[1:13:40] watching
[1:13:42] you I even had a Christian say to me one
[1:13:45] time I wish I could be the kind of
[1:13:47] Christian you are and I'm thinking what
[1:13:49] am I doing all I've done was just be a
[1:13:52] Christian you know I don't pref I don't
[1:13:55] use profanity I don't go with crazy
[1:13:57] places you know what I'm saying and I
[1:13:59] always say to myself but you don't know
[1:14:01] the battle that's in me if you could see
[1:14:04] what I'm going through you might even
[1:14:05] not you might not think I'm a Christian
[1:14:07] at
[1:14:08] all my victory is in Jesus it's not in
[1:14:13] me I could never fight these battles on
[1:14:16] my own see the enemy is a has a strategy
[1:14:20] he knows if he can get you to fall he
[1:14:22] knows he he he has weakened you
[1:14:25] he knows he's hindering the purpose and
[1:14:28] just like I said with Samson I don't
[1:14:29] know how long he hindered the purpose
[1:14:31] but someday one day Samson woke
[1:14:36] up and remember he had a
[1:14:39] purpose now I'm going tell you something
[1:14:41] what reason why we don't we don't see
[1:14:43] newcomers cuz we done forgot our
[1:14:46] purpose we're the light of the world we
[1:14:49] supposed to be Witnesses not like Israel
[1:14:53] Israel was supposed to be a light to the
[1:14:54] world
[1:14:55] but Israel got full of
[1:14:58] Pride and because oh we are God's people
[1:15:02] they didn't care about nobody
[1:15:04] else Samaritans were supposed to be
[1:15:07] saved the Gentiles were supposed to be
[1:15:10] saved they were supposed to see the
[1:15:12] light of
[1:15:13] Israel and come to worship the the god
[1:15:16] of Israel yall understand me we're the
[1:15:19] Bride of Jesus Christ we don't have time
[1:15:22] to be prideful we got a job to do our
[1:15:25] purpose is to win people to
[1:15:29] Christ but because we have looked at our
[1:15:32] failures because Satan has engaged you
[1:15:35] by your lust you feel
[1:15:38] unworthy and weak and you just feel like
[1:15:41] you're not able to witness to somebody
[1:15:43] how you can tell that Jesus is a
[1:15:45] deliverer when you don't feel delivered
[1:15:50] yourself
[1:15:52] hello but Paul did it Paul said the good
[1:15:56] that I would I don't
[1:15:58] do and the very thing that I don't want
[1:16:00] to do that's what I find myself doing
[1:16:03] but it didn't stop him from
[1:16:04] preaching because he understood my
[1:16:07] failures is my victory in Christ
[1:16:11] amen am I making
[1:16:14] sense don't be ashamed of this gospel
[1:16:16] there is none like it
[1:16:20] Hallelujah if they turn it down let them
[1:16:23] turn it down but give your chance
[1:16:25] yourself a chance to witness for Jesus
[1:16:29] am
[1:16:32] right that's all I'm saying if he can
[1:16:35] make you feeling better and that's what
[1:16:36] it is we have been fed fed up with
[1:16:39] laws don't do this don't do that you
[1:16:42] can't do this you can't do that and
[1:16:44] we're so legalistic and so
[1:16:47] self-righteous come on you don't even
[1:16:49] know
[1:16:50] it how do you know that you're
[1:16:52] self-righteous when you see somebody
[1:16:53] else in falter ways and you judge
[1:16:59] them God didn't give you that ability to
[1:17:02] judge that that that's right God said
[1:17:05] have mercy and
[1:17:06] Grace right and he said be careful how
[1:17:10] you approach your brother or sister if
[1:17:12] they fall you got to be careful with
[1:17:14] that you can't go pointing your fingers
[1:17:18] the Bible said you got to be careful L
[1:17:20] the same thing that happened to them
[1:17:23] come upon you amen
[1:17:26] amen there's not one of us that's better
[1:17:30] than the other I don't care what family
[1:17:32] you came from that's right or the family
[1:17:36] you come
[1:17:38] from so we know by the grace of God that
[1:17:41] you because you're young you have no
[1:17:43] idea with the Revelation that I have now
[1:17:45] if I could be young again ah my God
[1:17:49] y'all see me on the
[1:17:50] corner cuz when I had the baptism in the
[1:17:53] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's all
[1:17:54] I I had I was on the corner with my
[1:17:57] tamarine me and a few others and I
[1:17:59] wanton a lot of people to the Lord just

[1:18:10] this message how Lord how you let me
[1:18:13] stay in this
[1:18:15] church in my best
[1:18:18] years and he said just like I brought
[1:18:20] Israel to Egypt to preserve
[1:18:23] her I brought brought you in to this
[1:18:25] place to preserve you I thank God for
[1:18:29] the
[1:18:30] preserving cuz my life I would not have
[1:18:33] been here Ecclesiastes

[1:20:02] you even at times when you think he's
[1:20:05] not looking you're getting making the
[1:20:07] wrong decision he's still right there to
[1:20:10] encourage
[1:20:11] you he's there when nobody else knows he
[1:20:16] picks you up and ENC anybody know what
[1:20:19] I'm talking about how many times God
[1:20:22] himself brings a song to me
[1:20:25] amen a song of encouragement I know the
[1:20:27] devil didn't do cuz he the one that
[1:20:29] caused me to
[1:20:32] fall hallelujah amen Rejoice oh young
[1:20:36] man in in thy Youth and let thy heart
[1:20:39] cheer thee in the days of thy youth walk
[1:20:41] in the ways of thine heart and in the
[1:20:44] sight of thine eyes but know thou listen
[1:20:48] that for all these things God will bring
[1:20:52] thee into
[1:20:53] judgment what do you he saying go ahead
[1:20:56] enjoy yourself do what you want to do
[1:20:59] but understand there's a penalty for
[1:21:03] it always been God told Adam and Eve the
[1:21:06] day that you eat of this tree you should
[1:21:07] surely die did they die and everything
[1:21:10] after them has been dying sir sir right
[1:21:14] oh some of y'all so young you don't even
[1:21:16] know what dying is but when you get my
[1:21:19] age you know all about
[1:21:20] it you can't do what you want to do you
[1:21:23] can't get up out the chair like you get
[1:21:24] up like you want to get up you roll out
[1:21:26] the bed and your bones are aching and
[1:21:27] sore oh it look like I don't go through
[1:21:29] that but I do but you know what I thank
[1:21:32] God anyhow I'm still
[1:21:35] living and I got a new
[1:21:39] body you understand me this is not your
[1:21:43] home let me say it like this brothers
[1:21:45] and
[1:21:47] sisters if you don't help one another
[1:21:50] you can't let your best friend do wrong
[1:21:51] and not say nothing
[1:21:54] amen amen don't cover that kind of sin
[1:21:57] if you cover it cover it where you don't
[1:21:59] tell nobody but you got to tell that
[1:22:01] person you're
[1:22:03] wrong you need to
[1:22:07] repent because if you cover that person
[1:22:10] when they're wrong guess what it's going
[1:22:11] to get worse for them that's right and
[1:22:15] you know what happens they lose respect
[1:22:18] for
[1:22:19] you they will and they're going to do it
[1:22:22] again in your faith
[1:22:27] y'all understand what I'm
[1:22:29] saying I'd rather be friends with
[1:22:33] God and lose a friend on this Earth
[1:22:37] y'all understand what I'm trying to
[1:22:40] say because two can't walk together
[1:22:42] except they be
[1:22:44] agreed you don't go condemning your
[1:22:47] friend you help a wounded soldier even
[1:22:49] if you got to carry him on your back or
[1:22:52] carry her on your back you don't you
[1:22:54] don't kick them down you don't stomp
[1:22:55] them because reality that's
[1:22:58] you let me say it let me say it again in
[1:23:02] reality that's you you say well what do
[1:23:05] you mean one body
[1:23:08] we many
[1:23:10] members one body yes sir so if that
[1:23:14] person is part of that body that's your
[1:23:17] body yes sir that's his
[1:23:19] body you understand
[1:23:22] me yes remember now the Creator in the
[1:23:25] days of your youth while the evil days
[1:23:27] come not nor the years draw nigh when
[1:23:30] thou shalt say I have no pleasure in
[1:23:33] them right you got to remember listen in
[1:23:36] the day of your new because listen it's
[1:23:38] when you're young you can almost handle
[1:23:40] anything you know what I mean you get up
[1:23:42] you fall you get up easily but when you
[1:23:45] get older it's not so easy to get
[1:23:48] up and like I said as long as you keep
[1:23:52] your sins hidden Satan has a stronghold
[1:23:55] on
[1:23:57] you and it's not going to get better the
[1:24:01] pit goes
[1:24:03] deeper you understand what I'm saying it
[1:24:06] goes deeper you say no man don't see me
[1:24:09] yes perap David thought that
[1:24:13] right right he probably thought nobody
[1:24:16] saw me in B Shea but God said yes I did
[1:24:20] and guess what happens when you don't
[1:24:22] repent God shows some somebody
[1:24:27] else it's the truth sometime they have a
[1:24:29] dream they have something going on and
[1:24:31] say
[1:24:32] listen I I was talking to my grandbaby
[1:24:35] the other day not not Michaela my other
[1:24:37] grandbaby and I dream had a dream about
[1:24:40] her and I said you know I had a dream
[1:24:42] and the Lord showed me this this this
[1:24:45] this and this she
[1:24:47] said how I said well the Lord showed it
[1:24:50] to me I said but don't you do that
[1:24:55] and she didn't do it she saw
[1:25:01] God it was real whenever I have a dream
[1:25:05] that that needs no interpreting I know
[1:25:08] it's
[1:25:09] God Amen and sometimes I
[1:25:13] do so y'all better be careful how you're
[1:25:16] walking you never know I'm not the only
[1:25:18] dreamer there's other people who see
[1:25:20] things too but I'm telling you if God
[1:25:23] show you something about an individual
[1:25:26] you supposed to go tell them in privacy
[1:25:29] because you might be helping them
[1:25:31] keeping them from falling and making the
[1:25:33] wrong mistake well they ain't going to
[1:25:35] like me they might reject me that's all
[1:25:37] right I'd rather for them to reject me
[1:25:39] than
[1:25:41] God you understand me that Prophet had
[1:25:44] to go and tell David David there's a
[1:25:48] man who had a UL lamb his only UL lamb
[1:25:51] he he treated like his own his loved one
[1:25:54] and guess what somebody took away that
[1:25:55] you lamb and Slaughter it David said oh
[1:25:58] my goodness ain't that the way we do it
[1:26:01] we judge everybody else we should kill
[1:26:03] you should this man need to
[1:26:05] die he retracted that didn't he when the
[1:26:08] prophet say but it's you
[1:26:13] David am I making sense yes sir I hope
[1:26:16] I'm not going too long I'm trying to
[1:26:18] hurry up but I'm trying to give you
[1:26:20] something to look at I want you to see
[1:26:23] yourself off on the same plane everybody
[1:26:27] else is on because when we take the
[1:26:31] Rapture it ain't going to be you you you
[1:26:33] go up we all go
[1:26:36] up as a
[1:26:38] body right so also you so a free useful
[1:26:42] lust anybody know what useful lust
[1:26:45] is it's a
[1:26:47] monster
[1:26:51] yes it's a monster
[1:26:56] I'm going share something personally
[1:26:57] with you when I was in the
[1:27:00] world I was like a dog on the Chain
[1:27:03] whenever Satan pulled me I followed you
[1:27:07] understand me so when he when he when I
[1:27:10] got
[1:27:11] saved honestly I didn't
[1:27:13] know what that
[1:27:16] was because in the in in the world I
[1:27:18] fulfilled my flesh the lust of My Flesh
[1:27:20] I just did but when I got saved and God
[1:27:24] saved me and I'm telling you he saved me
[1:27:26] so much till he took that spirit away
[1:27:28] from me almost 3 years I thought I was
[1:27:31] going to be a
[1:27:34] unic I'm just being honest but my wife
[1:27:38] saw me and she prayed for
[1:27:43] me and she said it was love at first
[1:27:45] sight I always bring that back to
[1:27:49] her and guess what
[1:27:51] happened God took the hedge of white out
[1:27:54] from from me and for a whole week I
[1:27:58] couldn't
[1:27:59] sleep because I told the Lord if you
[1:28:02] don't give me a
[1:28:03] wife I'm going to
[1:28:06] sin now I told him I mean maybe y'all
[1:28:09] don't know what I'm talking about but
[1:28:11] everywhere I turned the fire was
[1:28:16] there I'm being honest cuz I know some
[1:28:18] of y'all know what I'm talking about but
[1:28:20] I
[1:28:22] refuse I ref refuse to satisfy myself
[1:28:27] now I'm being pling with you y'all
[1:28:29] understand exactly what I'm
[1:28:31] saying right but I said Lord if you
[1:28:34] don't give me a wife and here I was in
[1:28:37] church I fasted and prayed cuz I'm going
[1:28:39] to tell you something that's a weapon
[1:28:40] against the
[1:28:41] devil when lust comes and beat you up
[1:28:44] you need to do some fasting you need to
[1:28:47] do some praying you need to put this
[1:28:49] flesh in a weak State yeah I know what
[1:28:53] I'm talking about now so
[1:28:57] anyway God by way of vision and that you
[1:29:00] don't have to believe that I'm just
[1:29:01] telling you my wife appeared before me
[1:29:04] sister Ruby and another girl in the
[1:29:06] church who am I like her name was
[1:29:09] Sandra and I knew I wanted to marry
[1:29:12] sandre it was in my heart oh she make a
[1:29:14] good wife sister Ruby I didn't know
[1:29:16] nothing about
[1:29:18] her you know what I'm saying I'm just
[1:29:21] saying and then but it wasn't my Choice
[1:29:24] it was God's choice and all of a sudden
[1:29:27] sandre in the in the vision My Eyes Wide
[1:29:30] Open sandre disappeared and Ruby stood
[1:29:33] there and I said Lord if that be my wife
[1:29:35] I'll go ask her
[1:29:38] now and I did I I because what it was it
[1:29:42] was like a missionary night and we were
[1:29:44] had a prayer and I you know and all of
[1:29:46] that and and and and everything and I
[1:29:48] went got up off my knees and I at the
[1:29:50] service and I called her to myself and I
[1:29:52] I said sister Ruby I got to ask asked
[1:29:54] you something I said I said would you
[1:29:56] marry
[1:29:57] me she said Minister Brooks don't you be
[1:30:01] playing with
[1:30:03] me I said I'm not playing with you I
[1:30:06] said let's go to the
[1:30:08] bishop oh right after that we knocked on
[1:30:11] the bishop door got in his office told
[1:30:13] him about it as soon as we came out
[1:30:15] people saw me and her coming out of the
[1:30:16] bishop office and the News hit the
[1:30:20] internet was no internet back then but
[1:30:23] my point is it's
[1:30:25] spray like like Facebook or whatever it
[1:30:28] is and think about this people I had
[1:30:31] about I wanton I don't know how many
[1:30:34] girls who said that God showed them that
[1:30:37] I was their
[1:30:39] husband I said well he show didn't show
[1:30:44] me and they they went against my wife
[1:30:47] she had a war on her hands because of
[1:30:51] me and some girls say we be in your
[1:30:54] wedding and waited till the last week to
[1:30:57] cancel it to mess her wedding up but God
[1:31:00] always had a ram in the
[1:31:02] bush so what I'm trying to say is to you
[1:31:05] when God show you the right one it's
[1:31:09] yours whether it be male or female y'all
[1:31:12] know what I mean by
[1:31:15] that let me clear that up women if it's
[1:31:19] a male men if it's female you know right
[1:31:24] I don't want you to get confused but my
[1:31:27] point is if God has shown
[1:31:30] you is worth waiting for
[1:31:33] amen amen I'll never get over
[1:31:37] Jacob and he waited for Rachel
[1:31:41] right 14
[1:31:44] years and it said like it he said it
[1:31:47] seemed like it just yesterday as oh my
[1:31:49] God I need that that's the kind of love
[1:31:52] we all need y
[1:31:55] it's true it's all right to wait if God
[1:31:58] says wait because you got to understand
[1:32:01] maybe there's something in that person
[1:32:03] character that that person need to get
[1:32:05] victory over before you marry them
[1:32:09] amen right so I'm I'mma drop back into
[1:32:12] this before let me know when
[1:32:14] my I don't want to be too much
[1:32:17] longer but every one of us has been
[1:32:20] wounded abused in one way or another yes
[1:32:24] come on
[1:32:26] somebody and maybe your wounds are
[1:32:29] deep and as long as you have those deep
[1:32:31] wounds that have never healed Satan will
[1:32:34] try you and more than likely he's going
[1:32:36] to get victory over you because there's
[1:32:39] nothing like feeling
[1:32:41] lonely
[1:32:43] rejected
[1:32:44] unloved y'all hear me and that's what
[1:32:47] those wounds will always come and
[1:32:49] remember when a wound is not taken care
[1:32:52] of it literally gets worse it gets
[1:32:56] infested so your secret life that you
[1:32:59] now have is going is getting worse and
[1:33:02] you don't know how to O overcome it the
[1:33:04] only way you can overcome it is that God
[1:33:07] heal you of those
[1:33:10] wounds you say oh brother I don't
[1:33:12] understand that I had an abusive father
[1:33:16] he didn't love
[1:33:18] me you understand me he was always
[1:33:21] rejecting me giving my brothers my
[1:33:23] sister s is more money and everything
[1:33:25] else and then when he comes to me I'm
[1:33:26] sorry I just ran out that's what he
[1:33:29] would do to me and all my life I wanted
[1:33:32] him to love me CU nobody likes to be
[1:33:35] rejected even when my daddy growing up
[1:33:38] even when my daddy wasn't around his his
[1:33:43] wounds his things that he Afflicted with
[1:33:46] me on me was still directing my life can
[1:33:50] I say it like this it caused me to look
[1:33:53] for love in the wrong
[1:33:55] places maybe y'all don't know what I'm
[1:33:57] talking
[1:33:58] about it can made me confused lust with
[1:34:02] love or love y'all understand me you
[1:34:05] just want somebody to conf you want a
[1:34:07] friend you want this you want that and
[1:34:08] listen you know not you're not going to
[1:34:10] get it and you're going to always have
[1:34:12] that going on in you until you say Lord
[1:34:14] deliver me amen amen right amen my daddy
[1:34:19] was a something else he died at 89 I saw
[1:34:22] a dream of him and told him I knew he
[1:34:24] was dying a't going to die I told my
[1:34:26] church this church here that I had the
[1:34:28] dream and I was leaving to go see him
[1:34:30] and then I would stopped by God not to
[1:34:32] go see him and then when I called him on
[1:34:35] the phone he talked to me like he killed
[1:34:38] me for no apparent reason but I'm going
[1:34:41] to tell you what it was his wife was a
[1:34:44] real
[1:34:45] witch and I've known her since I was a
[1:34:48] boy didn't know she was a witch I
[1:34:50] thought she was my aunt and she wasn't
[1:34:53] feel fill in the
[1:34:56] blanks but she said to me they called me
[1:34:58] Junior they said Junior I knew you was
[1:35:02] different I told Ike which they call my
[1:35:04] daddy that you was different what was it
[1:35:07] when she said that I didn't know what
[1:35:08] she was talking about but then when God
[1:35:10] opened my understanding I remember
[1:35:12] meeting this woman at the fairground as
[1:35:14] a snake
[1:35:17] Handler
[1:35:18] y let me tell you something she was a
[1:35:21] real witch
[1:35:23] she had powers but she was
[1:35:27] frustrated because she couldn't use up
[1:35:29] those Powers over
[1:35:31] me even when I was a sinner God would
[1:35:34] not allow her
[1:35:37] powers and she couldn't understand
[1:35:40] me she even gave us food and I don't I
[1:35:43] didn't know she was a witch at that time
[1:35:45] if I had known she was a witch I would
[1:35:46] have never ate her
[1:35:48] food but I did but she figured something
[1:35:51] was going to happen nothing happened
[1:35:56] I gave my daddy some money and I gave
[1:35:58] him some money just out of the out of
[1:35:59] goodness of my heart he cursed him me I
[1:36:03] said Daddy at least I gave you some
[1:36:04] money the point I was thinking is you
[1:36:05] should be giving me some but the the
[1:36:08] point is he cursed me and I didn't
[1:36:11] understand all of this you understand
[1:36:12] what I'm saying until I figured until I
[1:36:15] found out she was a witch she took a
[1:36:17] picture with us and her face the whole
[1:36:19] face was blurred now I'm telling y'all
[1:36:21] something personally no
[1:36:24] weapon formed against you shall
[1:36:28] prosper I don't care what it is it'll
[1:36:32] never
[1:36:36] Prosper God is
[1:36:38] real so I'm saying this and I'm going
[1:36:40] close in just a
[1:36:42] minute for I know that in me Paul says
[1:36:46] that's in my flesh dwelleth no good
[1:36:48] things for to will is is is present with
[1:36:52] me but how to perform that which is good
[1:36:56] I find not for the good that I would do
[1:36:59] not but the evil which I would not that
[1:37:02] I do a
[1:37:04] prophet now if I do that which I would
[1:37:07] not is more I that do it it is no more I
[1:37:12] that do it but sin that dwelleth in my
[1:37:15] flesh you understand me I love Paul CU
[1:37:17] he was able to separate himself from his
[1:37:20] flesh he said that's flesh doing that
[1:37:23] that ain't the real man see the real man
[1:37:26] has been revived the real man has been
[1:37:28] redeemed the real man is in the image of
[1:37:30] God but the flesh still lives that's why
[1:37:35] Paul said you got to Die daily now I
[1:37:38] know you say oh brother we don't heard
[1:37:39] all these things but I'm going to tell
[1:37:40] you something you can take lightly what
[1:37:42] I'm saying if you want to but one of
[1:37:45] these days you're going to have to come
[1:37:46] back to the realization that you're a
[1:37:49] flesh and you got to overcome this
[1:37:52] flesh nobody can help you do that but
[1:37:56] God you understand me you said well why
[1:37:58] are you telling me all your stories
[1:38:00] because I want you to understand I'm a
[1:38:02] man of like passion so was
[1:38:05] Elijah so are
[1:38:07] you and these habits that you are have
[1:38:11] that are secret they're only secret with
[1:38:13] you cuz God knows and guess who else
[1:38:15] knows the
[1:38:18] devil and he's going to keep coming at
[1:38:20] you until you allow God to heal you from
[1:38:25] within do you understand that you'll
[1:38:28] never understand what real love is until
[1:38:31] that wound is
[1:38:33] healed because you're going to
[1:38:35] substitute real love with lust that's
[1:38:37] not real love
[1:38:44] amen anybody know what I'm talking
[1:38:46] about I'm I'm really serious because I
[1:38:49] want to see a Revival in this church I
[1:38:51] want to see a Revival in the young
[1:38:52] people but the only way you're going to
[1:38:54] have a Revival you got to acknowledge
[1:38:57] that you are somebody you have a purpose
[1:39:00] and you have personally allow Satan to
[1:39:03] hinder you you ought to be tired of
[1:39:05] being a
[1:39:06] slave hiding every time you sin you're
[1:39:09] going to hide like Adam Adam and Eve
[1:39:12] that's just the way it goes but you
[1:39:14] ought to be free the Bible said whom the
[1:39:16] sun set free is free indeed and where
[1:39:17] the spirit of the Lord is Liberty some
[1:39:20] of y'all got things in y'all and you
[1:39:22] just you know if somebody know it they
[1:39:24] would probably scone you you know Shan
[1:39:27] you right but I'm going tell you
[1:39:29] something every one of us have something
[1:39:31] that'll make somebody
[1:39:34] Shan You In the Flesh that's why I can't
[1:39:38] understand why some of these preachers
[1:39:40] pastors Lord over the people when they
[1:39:43] had this you know all of us are saved by
[1:39:46] the grace of God there ain't no great
[1:39:49] preacher I I'm not a great preacher I'm
[1:39:52] a brother
[1:39:54] that God just sat in this
[1:39:57] position and people think OHA brother
[1:40:00] Brooks he's holy here only because the
[1:40:02] Holy Ghost is in
[1:40:05] me there ain't no good thing in this
[1:40:07] flesh like the Bible says but we have a
[1:40:10] tendency we want to put too much
[1:40:11] emphasis on this when we ought to look
[1:40:13] Beyond this and see the real side inside
[1:40:17] this is what caused me to love the
[1:40:18] people of God because I asked God I said
[1:40:21] Lord show me their heart I don't need to
[1:40:24] see their faults those things are easily
[1:40:27] seen you understand me but if I see a
[1:40:30] man's heart I don't care how fault to
[1:40:32] they are I'm going to love you because I
[1:40:36] know your intent is to be what God wants
[1:40:39] you to be
[1:40:41] amen you understand me I'm almost done
[1:40:44] you have a purpose and some of us I was
[1:40:47] thinking today when y'all were singing I
[1:40:49] said you know what we need to have a
[1:40:50] choir singing at least twice a month
[1:40:54] in this church I wouldn't even care if
[1:40:56] it was every
[1:40:58] Sunday young people y'all need to be
[1:41:00] used keep you
[1:41:04] busy and if you C kept busy you don't
[1:41:07] have time for
[1:41:09] flesh y understand what I'm
[1:41:12] saying it of mind they say it's the
[1:41:15] devil's
[1:41:17] workshop right so I'm I'm going say it
[1:41:19] I'm I'm going say a lot of little things
[1:41:20] that and I'm almost done I'm at the end
[1:41:22] of this thing every everybody has a
[1:41:23] purpose whether it's singing preaching
[1:41:25] sharing love whatever it is but Satan
[1:41:28] device is
[1:41:30] real and I know how he worked on
[1:41:35] me you say oh brother books what are you
[1:41:38] talking about let me tell y'all
[1:41:39] something some of y'all not even old
[1:41:40] enough to go through menopause or man's
[1:41:44] change but I'm going tell you something
[1:41:46] if you live to see that you haven't seen
[1:41:49] a real devil yet
[1:41:55] when I first started into my menopause
[1:41:57] or my man change however you want to
[1:41:59] call
[1:42:01] it felt like all my walls of protection
[1:42:04] was
[1:42:06] gone if I didn't have Jesus I would not
[1:42:10] be here
[1:42:11] today I literally was insane and nobody
[1:42:13] knew it but me and the
[1:42:16] Lord but he kept me during that time my
[1:42:19] son is going through that now so I'm
[1:42:21] able to help him
[1:42:23] but my point is
[1:42:25] this and what what what it what is it
[1:42:28] that makes you like that is that same
[1:42:30] old sex
[1:42:32] Gene that's in you and when your body is
[1:42:36] in the place getting ready to die it
[1:42:40] fights right and so you got to
[1:42:43] understand you know you you you you you
[1:42:46] you right now you got it good compared
[1:42:49] to what it's going to be down the road
[1:42:51] some women lose their mind they go
[1:42:54] insane during that time men do too
[1:42:57] brother bam said a man is when he start
[1:43:00] going through his change he makes some
[1:43:02] of the worst mistakes I know a man who
[1:43:04] did that ended up divorcing his wife and
[1:43:07] then when he came to himself the damage
[1:43:09] was too too much it was it was already
[1:43:11] done there was no way he could complete
[1:43:14] it and sometime we don't understand our
[1:43:16] fathers when they going through changes
[1:43:19] but I'll tell you if they're 40 and on
[1:43:21] up yeah that's that's why they're acting
[1:43:24] strange and you ought to be praying for
[1:43:27] them yes amen instead of judging them
[1:43:31] amen they become
[1:43:34] schizophrenic I'm be honest with you
[1:43:36] it's like two
[1:43:37] personalities working with them and they
[1:43:39] don't even know themselves cuz nobody is
[1:43:41] telling them but it still come down to
[1:43:44] lust I'm almost done Satan use it as a
[1:43:49] weapon against you because he knows what
[1:43:53] you're capable of doing amen if you are
[1:43:57] a singer and you can sing
[1:43:59] well Satan don't like it especially when
[1:44:03] the Holy Ghost come
[1:44:05] down you will become a
[1:44:08] Target
[1:44:09] music piano player whatever you are
[1:44:12] you're gifted the more gifted you are
[1:44:15] the greater your battle and people don't

[1:45:17] they do have
[1:45:18] them celibate priest what

[1:45:27] planned
[1:45:28] it like I said you can be up on the
[1:45:31] Mountaintop in a secluded
[1:45:33] place and guess what the devil going to
[1:45:36] knock on your
[1:45:38] door I'm almost
[1:45:41] done James says by every man but every
[1:45:44] man is tempted when he's drawn away of
[1:45:48] his own lust and entice am I helping
[1:45:50] anybody
[1:45:53] I'm just trying to tell you I can't help
[1:45:55] your problem but God can and he knows
[1:45:58] every bad thing every dark thing every
[1:46:02] little thing that you've gone through
[1:46:03] but the Bible said he he knows how to
[1:46:06] comfort us amen he's the great comforter
[1:46:10] and I want you to understand god holds
[1:46:12] nothing to your charge amen you
[1:46:15] understand me he design you to be this
[1:46:17] way you say oh brother Brooks I don't
[1:46:20] know about that but let me say it like
[1:46:22] this
[1:46:24] what about the
[1:46:25] woman who had the uh uh brother Adam
[1:46:30] said that uh God put her out their
[1:46:33] parents put her out the house and she
[1:46:34] became a
[1:46:36] prostitute she had to make a
[1:46:42] living people people are
[1:46:44] strange they don't
[1:46:46] understand but a woman if she married
[1:46:51] and a a husband leave huh and she's got
[1:46:54] to work all by
[1:46:55] herself and she's coming short of making
[1:46:59] ends meet and she's got children a real
[1:47:04] mother will sacrifice her own
[1:47:07] life for her
[1:47:10] children she will do the thing that she
[1:47:13] knows
[1:47:16] wrong but the thing that's in her heart
[1:47:18] I'm going to save my children I'm going
[1:47:20] to protect my children I'm going to feed
[1:47:21] my children listen I look at a mother
[1:47:23] like that and I said that's a real
[1:47:25] mother I don't care if she's
[1:47:27] wrong but God look at the cause
[1:47:33] amen see what I'm saying God looks
[1:47:36] beyond all those things that P people
[1:47:38] look at and and he see what she's doing
[1:47:41] what she what causing her to do that now
[1:47:43] I'm going tell you something God put it
[1:47:46] in a mother like
[1:47:48] that and you don't maybe don't know what
[1:47:50] I'm talking about but let me tell you
[1:47:52] something I grew
[1:47:53] up with women and sisters and all that
[1:47:56] who without husbands because they walked
[1:47:58] out on them but they did what was
[1:48:02] necessary to keep their family living
[1:48:06] and going I don't judge
[1:48:09] them I don't criticize them because if I
[1:48:13] was in their place I would have done it
[1:48:15] the same for my children am I making
[1:48:19] sense so here was this woman that had to
[1:48:22] do whatever she had to do to make a
[1:48:24] living and she had a seed of God in
[1:48:28] her huh all she needed to do was Meet
[1:48:31] Jesus see I don't care what background
[1:48:33] you come from God don't
[1:48:37] care if you save if you see it of God
[1:48:40] he's going to make sure it comes to
[1:48:43] pass Hallelujah Heaven wouldn't be
[1:48:46] Heaven if we didn't go through the
[1:48:47] suffering oh amen amen that's true so I
[1:48:52] say this when you're drawn away You're
[1:48:54] drawn away with your own lust and
[1:48:56] enticed and when lust has conceived it
[1:48:59] bring forth sin and sin when it uh
[1:49:02] finish bring forth death that means it's
[1:49:05] giving birth it's giving birth it's
[1:49:06] giving birth you don't wait till it's
[1:49:09] conceived you stop it right here Satan
[1:49:14] you a liar you know devil come to my
[1:49:17] thoughts sometimes and I said oh no
[1:49:18] those are not my thoughts I talk to him
[1:49:21] like a man amen I said those your
[1:49:23] thoughts and I resist that amen right if
[1:49:26] you catch it then you got it you got it
[1:49:30] but as long if you entertain it you let
[1:49:33] him s s that seed that seed is going to
[1:49:36] grow and it's going to grow little by
[1:49:39] little right seeds don't grow
[1:49:42] overnight little by little then the next
[1:49:45] thing you know you got a big tree in
[1:49:46] front of you and that tree is bringing
[1:49:49] forth
[1:49:50] fruit right at the end of the day
[1:49:53] that one little seed of lust that was
[1:49:55] placed in your head that you failed to
[1:49:57] reject is going to bring forth
[1:50:00] fruit am I am I am I getting to
[1:50:04] you I'm almost
[1:50:06] done I keep saying that like a
[1:50:09] preacher but I want to say this by the
[1:50:11] grace of God I am seriously talking to
[1:50:14] your
[1:50:15] soul don't let the devil condemn you
[1:50:18] like that come out of that dark place
[1:50:21] confess your sins
[1:50:23] you don't have to tell me but tell God
[1:50:26] right and if you're involved with
[1:50:28] someone that you know you shouldn't be
[1:50:30] involved with cut that thing
[1:50:33] loose cut it off stop
[1:50:37] it and make those people know I've Been
[1:50:41] Changed God has heard my prayer I'm now
[1:50:45] liberated because now he's healing me
[1:50:48] amen right you should never marry a man
[1:50:52] if you you still have
[1:50:54] wounds let God heal
[1:50:57] them because it's not fair that he's
[1:50:59] going to have to go through chaos
[1:51:02] because of your
[1:51:04] wounds vice versa man woman whatever is
[1:51:07] not
[1:51:09] fair that you have to send somebody else
[1:51:12] through and they don't even know what's
[1:51:13] wrong with you and you you flipping like
[1:51:16] pancakes they don't even know why you
[1:51:18] flipping cuz your mood is out of control
[1:51:21] because now the devil has anointed you
[1:51:23] with the thoughts of your past you
[1:51:26] understand
[1:51:29] me it's not right let God heal you let
[1:51:33] God deliver you so that you can have a
[1:51:35] wonderful husband or a wonderful
[1:51:38] wife you know that you can grow up
[1:51:40] together like children and enjoy your
[1:51:42] children and all that kind of stuff if
[1:51:45] any new thing come up Let it Be new but
[1:51:47] don't let don't let your marriage and
[1:51:49] things like that be based upon your your
[1:51:51] your your your your past history of
[1:51:54] wounds and hurts and all of that am I
[1:51:57] making sense see cuz the devil want to
[1:52:00] keep you from your purpose and your
[1:52:03] purpose might even just be making
[1:52:05] somebody happy as a husband or a
[1:52:10] wife whichever it is you give God your
[1:52:13] best and don't take keep taking that
[1:52:16] stuff off the devil stop it you're young
[1:52:20] you said what brother book if I stop it
[1:52:22] is going to come again hello it doesn't
[1:52:25] it rains every
[1:52:28] year whether you like it or not season
[1:52:31] going to bring season
[1:52:34] changes but you don't have to go wet get
[1:52:37] wet they got
[1:52:39] umbrellas and then they have houses that
[1:52:41] you can stay in you don't have to get
[1:52:44] you don't have to when it's all sorrow
[1:52:46] and everything I know I'm taking too
[1:52:48] much time but my point is you you the
[1:52:51] Victor amen
[1:52:54] walk away from those pains and those
[1:52:56] hurts and says Lord this is what I had
[1:52:58] to do and I'm closing I'm really closing
[1:53:00] this time I cried when I went to go see
[1:53:03] my daddy I called my my daddy and his
[1:53:06] wife answered my daddy
[1:53:09] died from
[1:53:12] Alzheimer's and my daughter my my his
[1:53:14] wife thought I put some voodoo on him
[1:53:17] because I gave him some money that was
[1:53:19] the last thing and she's a witch so she
[1:53:21] believe in all that crazy stuff
[1:53:23] why would I put voodo on my
[1:53:24] daddy I don't even know what about no
[1:53:29] Voodoo I do not but my point is my
[1:53:33] sisters and stuff were very
[1:53:35] superstitious oh somebody cross your leg
[1:53:37] somebody step on your foot you know all
[1:53:40] kind of crazy stuff but the
[1:53:44] point I don't fear stuff like that
[1:53:47] that's why it
[1:53:48] doesn't I've seen God protect me even
[1:53:50] when I didn't even know he was was
[1:53:52] protecting me so you know I know it's
[1:53:56] real now I ain't going to tell you it's
[1:53:58] not real y'all know it's real and if you
[1:54:02] believe in it it will affect you and
[1:54:05] sometime if you don't believe in it it
[1:54:07] will affect you if you're not under the
[1:54:10] blood now leave that alone so what
[1:54:14] happened my daddy she put my daddy on
[1:54:17] the phone he's in in the hospital with
[1:54:20] Alzheimer's you know and he's carrying
[1:54:23] on he's doing everything he's literally
[1:54:25] cursing me not not cursing but like
[1:54:28] basically saying I could kill you I
[1:54:29] don't care what you comeing he was so
[1:54:31] angry with me and I know it's because of
[1:54:33] what she said cuz he's thinking I put
[1:54:36] him in the hospital but the Lord said
[1:54:38] don't
[1:54:41] go my M my daddy was a angry
[1:54:46] man and he had the ability of killing
[1:54:51] people I'm not not going to go into
[1:54:53] detail but I knew if I would go he would
[1:54:55] kill me he would really kill me and then
[1:54:59] blame it on his
[1:55:00] Alzheimer you understand me and Brother
[1:55:04] Rich who sits right here his wife sister
[1:55:07] Kathy who's gone from Glory God told her
[1:55:10] call Brother Brooks tell him not to go
[1:55:13] she didn't know what was going on tell
[1:55:14] him not to go I came back from I was
[1:55:18] already over halfway to to to to to
[1:55:21] where my my daddy lived and I'm crying
[1:55:24] I'm crying I'm really crying God deliver
[1:55:26] me from this man please deliver me
[1:55:29] that's when I realized that my dad had
[1:55:31] such a stronghold in my life and every
[1:55:33] bad decision I ever made was because of
[1:55:36] the way he treated me my mother was an
[1:55:39] angel you understand me but my daddy was
[1:55:42] something else and all I can truly say
[1:55:45] is this God delivered me you know why
[1:55:48] you know what he said I said why Lord
[1:55:50] why you gave me a daddy like this he
[1:55:51] said because because I want to be the
[1:55:53] daddy that you never
[1:55:55] had and from that point on he became the
[1:55:58] daddy the father I never
[1:56:01] had and maybe that's something that's
[1:56:03] happening in your life God allowed it so
[1:56:06] he can be the kind of person or daddy
[1:56:10] brother sister that you never had I have
[1:56:12] a brother who looks just like my daddy
[1:56:14] he hates me too but that's okay I have a
[1:56:19] family and I'm not looking for nobody's
[1:56:21] pity I'm I'm just trying to tell you all
[1:56:24] these things are set before you you must
[1:56:27] overcome but you can't do it without
[1:56:29] Jesus amen you love the Lord I hope this
[1:56:34] has been a blessing to you amen I didn't
[1:56:36] mean to go so long I had a lot of more
[1:56:39] notes y'all want me to finish
[1:56:43] them I knew I was going to get a half
[1:56:45] hour silence but that's
[1:56:48] okay I shouldn't have said that forgive
[1:56:50] me but I knew I was going to get silence
