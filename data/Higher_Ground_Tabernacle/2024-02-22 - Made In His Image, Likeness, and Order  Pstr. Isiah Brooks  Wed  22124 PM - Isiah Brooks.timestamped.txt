[0:00] they needed
[0:01] amen but they wanted it in their own
[0:05] way they want it the way they they
[0:07] thought was bad but God knows how to
[0:10] send it in the way that he knows it's
[0:12] best because he's an infinite God and he
[0:16] knows just how to send it he knows your
[0:17] needs he knows how to bring it to you
[0:19] but the trouble of it is because it
[0:21] don't come the way you think it ought to
[0:23] come then you're all discouraged and you
[0:25] hand it back to him let's ask him and
[0:28] believe that he'll just the way he wants
[0:31] to S it and accept it upon the
[0:35] bis if you asked him don't make him a
[0:38] liar he can't lie he promised ask the
[0:41] father anything in my name I'll do
[0:44] it God can't lie ask him and it shall be
[0:48] done seek you shall find knock it'll be
[0:51] open we believe that certainly we do
[0:55] they got a major so what did they do as
[0:58] this little baby in a major is that the
[1:00] mighty king they refused him yes sir why
[1:05] he didn't come the way they expected him
[1:07] to come and friends you might think that
[1:10] was a horrible thing it was but you know
[1:12] we're guilty of the same
[1:14] thing we are guilty of the same thing we
[1:17] ask God for things and then we walk
[1:20] around and if he don't just pour
[1:21] something on us and give us something
[1:23] that uh we think we ought to have then
[1:25] we just hand it back don't do that ask
[1:29] them stay right with it hold on to it if
[1:32] you know it's real and what's more real
[1:34] than the word of God and the word of God
[1:37] is made flesh and dwelt Among Us Christ
[1:40] and now Christ sent the Holy Spirit and
[1:42] he is God in spirit so then hold on to
[1:46] it if the Holy Spirit here and give us
[1:48] that promise stay with it what's the
[1:50] matter with us Pentecostal
[1:52] people who profess to have the Holy
[1:55] Ghost and afraid to trust God
[1:57] anywhere matter we're expecting it in
[2:01] some other way I think that what we
[2:03] doing I'll tell you the truth I think
[2:05] we're expecting it God to come in and
[2:07] Bloom us out in a great big organization
[2:09] of this type and that type and when you
[2:11] do you build complex against the other F
[2:14] the thing we ought to do brother is
[2:15] forget about that your organizations are
[2:18] fine but what we want is Born Again
[2:20] Christians with salvation their heart
[2:21] and the power of the Holy Ghost in there
[2:23] to love one another in a stretch out and
[2:27] to have feelings for one another
[2:30] glorious feelings hopes of feelings and
[2:33] brotherly
[2:34] affection that binds us together that's
[2:37] what God wants us to have he's infite
[2:40] God and he

[43:40] In amen amen hallelujah God is good to
[43:44] us
[43:46] amen we're just going to go right into
[43:48] the scripture thank God for the
[43:55] musicians
[44:09] we're not going to try to give you all
[44:12] at once tonight but we want to uh do
[44:16] this particular message in
[44:22] Parts I think it would be maybe
[44:24] three-part message
[44:30] and so anyway I trust the Lord will
[44:32] bless
[44:34] us when thinking about the message in
[44:37] which God has given
[44:40] me I was I've been thinking about the
[44:47] Passover uh when the death angel is was
[44:50] passing through the
[44:53] land everybody had to make make
[44:57] sure the blood had been
[45:01] applied and while the blood was being
[45:06] applied uh they were eating
[45:11] herbs and roasted
[45:14] lamb bitter
[45:17] herbs bitter
[45:20] herbs showing that the message bring
[45:24] bitterness as well
[45:28] even when God told John to eat the
[45:33] book said it would be sweet to your
[45:36] taste uh but bitter to your
[45:40] stomach so we know that the message or
[45:42] the word of
[45:44] God has
[45:47] a a sweetness to
[45:50] it but it also has a bitterness to
[45:54] it amen so as we stand let us turn to
[45:58] Ephesians
[46:02] 5 and when I read this I want you to
[46:04] know I'm not going to preach on marriage
[46:06] and
[46:09] divorce but I needed
[46:12] scripture to help me uh
[46:17] explain the order in which God has
[46:20] placed things
[46:22] in and and from this uh book of
[46:25] Ephesians
[46:26] we're going to ask that you also turn to
[46:30] Colossians the first chapter 15-
[46:37] 18 you have Ephesians
[46:45] 5 says wives submit yourselves unto your
[46:50] own husbands as unto the
[46:54] Lord
[46:57] for the husband is head of the wife even
[47:01] as Christ is the head of the church and
[47:04] he is the savior of the
[47:08] [Music]
[47:13] body therefore as the church is subject
[47:16] unto Christ so let the wise be to their
[47:20] hus their own husbands in
[47:24] everything
[47:29] husband love your wives even as Christ
[47:32] also loved the church and gave himself
[47:34] for
[47:39] it that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[47:43] with the washing of the Water by the
[47:45] word
[47:48] am this is a part I like that he might
[47:51] present it unto himself a glorious
[47:54] Church not having a spot or wrinkle or
[47:58] any such thing but that it should be
[48:00] holy and without
[48:06] [Music]
[48:10] blemish so all men to love their wives
[48:13] as their own bodies he that loveth his
[48:17] wife loveth
[48:24] himself Colossians
[48:29] 1:15 is it warm in here or is it just
[48:37] me feel like I'm steaming up
[48:42] here thank
[48:44] you Colossians 1:15 through
[48:49] 18 who is in the image of the invisible
[48:52] God the first born of every creature
[48:58] [Music]
[49:00] for by him were all things created that
[49:03] are in heaven that are in Earth visible
[49:06] invisible whether there be Thrones or
[49:09] dominions or principalities or Powers
[49:12] all things were created by Him and for
[49:16] [Music]
[49:24] him
[49:27] for he is before all things and by him
[49:30] all things
[49:34] consist and he is the head of the body
[49:36] the church who is the beginning the
[49:39] first born from the dead that in all
[49:42] things he might have the
[49:52] preeminence uh let us pray Heavenly
[49:56] Father God we come before you as humbly
[49:59] as we thank you as we know how we thank
[50:03] you Father God for your goodness we
[50:05] thank you for your grace thank you for
[50:08] your mercy we thank you for being here
[50:11] we pray Lord God
[50:13] tonight that you will make yourself
[50:16] manifest through Thy Word in your name
[50:19] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may
[50:23] be seated we want to welome welcome all
[50:26] visitors and we trust that you will make
[50:29] yourself
[50:31] home and uh just just uh uh if you keep
[50:36] in
[50:37] prayer I believe and trust that the Lord
[50:40] will bless
[50:42] you we we love the word
[50:45] here uh it is our
[50:49] headship and uh we we really appreciate
[50:52] your being
[50:54] here amen glad to see our brother
[50:57] Mike he always know when I'm going get
[50:59] I'm about to call him he shows
[51:03] up we are in the last
[51:06] days and we know that we have
[51:10] traveled uh from one Church age to
[51:16] another starting from
[51:18] Ephesus all the way up to the leoan
[51:22] church
[51:23] age we have seen
[51:27] changes that God has allowed throughout
[51:29] the church
[51:32] ages with with the uh True Vine and the
[51:35] false
[51:38] Vine and we have seen how
[51:42] Satan has cloaked his work with
[51:47] religion and he has made the true
[51:51] Christians this way he has made
[51:54] Christians
[51:56] forget the
[51:59] purpose uh for the uh for which they
[52:02] were
[52:03] saved amen that's true we have come in
[52:06] this
[52:08] day to
[52:10] excel the church age before
[52:15] us and we call this
[52:18] age the bride
[52:20] age because we believe it is in this age
[52:26] the Bride of Jesus Christ will take a
[52:30] translation she will be
[52:33] raptured and she will be not part of the
[52:37] word but she will be all of the
[52:40] word hallelujah she is a mature
[52:45] Christian Hallelujah and she is one who
[52:50] died in order to
[52:53] live see you have to die
[52:56] die before you could
[52:58] live if you understand
[53:02] me the
[53:04] Pharisees and the
[53:06] Sadducees they didn't get mad with
[53:09] Jesus until Lazarus was raised from the
[53:14] dead they may have questioned uh Jar's
[53:18] daughter they may have questioned the
[53:21] man who was raised from the dead of the
[53:24] boy but when Jesus raised
[53:28] Lazarus it made the crowd so
[53:32] angry literally wanted to kill Lazarus
[53:35] all over
[53:37] again it's always a true
[53:41] Resurrection those who have the
[53:44] resurrection are the people that make
[53:46] those who do not have the
[53:52] resurrection angry uh because we
[53:56] realize that the resurrection is not a
[54:01] show we understand the resurrection is a
[54:06] person Hallelujah the resurrection is
[54:09] Jesus Christ that right he said I am the
[54:14] resurrection I am the life hallelujah
[54:18] it's not church
[54:20] chanity it's not your denomination or
[54:24] organization
[54:26] it is a living word hallelujah it is
[54:29] truly the voice of
[54:32] God speaking to the elected of that of
[54:35] their
[54:37] day is that
[54:39] right now I wanted to bring all of this
[54:42] to say all of
[54:45] this because there is a
[54:47] time when everything was in
[54:51] order there was no
[54:54] correcting Adam and his wife lived
[55:00] harmoniously uh the only thing they had
[55:02] to be careful
[55:04] of is
[55:06] serpent because he was the most subtle
[55:11] beast in the
[55:14] field and
[55:16] remember when
[55:18] God uh created
[55:21] Adam he created Adam as a ruler
[55:25] [Music]
[55:27] and not as a ruler only but a
[55:31] protector he was to rule the
[55:34] Earth protect the Garden of
[55:37] Eden is that
[55:39] right everything was
[55:42] obedient to the voice of
[55:44] Adam because within
[55:47] Adam was the voice of God is that right
[55:52] because the Bible says that God himself
[55:55] self
[55:58] breath into the nostrils of of
[56:01] Adam and that was when Adam became a
[56:04] living
[56:06] Soul Adam amen was made and
[56:11] created Hallelujah with his
[56:14] theophany Hallelujah so he was a strong
[56:19] man he was a man that could not be
[56:23] deceived Hallelujah but because of
[56:27] Eve the feminine part of
[56:29] Adam she was the weaker
[56:32] part Hallelujah she was designed the way
[56:35] she was
[56:37] designed when God when she
[56:39] fell it wasn't like she willfully
[56:42] sinned the Bible say she was
[56:46] beguiled she was
[56:48] deceived Hallelujah but Adam did not he
[56:52] was not
[56:53] deceived Adam willfully
[56:57] sinned but he had to do it to save
[57:02] Eve at that time her name was not
[57:05] Eve according to Genesis
[57:08] 5 her name was Adam as
[57:11] well and the reason being the reason
[57:15] they had the same name because they had
[57:18] the same
[57:20] character Hallelujah they were both made
[57:23] in the image and likeness of
[57:26] God and according to Genesis 5 said God
[57:30] said he made them male and
[57:34] female Hallelujah and called their name
[57:38] Adam now you see the
[57:41] order God's order was always like that
[57:45] when he created the plants it was male
[57:48] and
[57:49] female when he created the trees it was
[57:52] male and female when he C created the
[57:55] animals it was male and female that was
[57:59] God's order now let me tell you like
[58:02] this when you break the order of
[58:05] God hallelujah it plunge you into what
[58:09] we call
[58:11] chaos I don't know what the world before
[58:14] this
[58:16] one was
[58:18] like but when God came to brew over
[58:22] it the Bible said the world was in
[58:26] chaos everything was out of order
[58:29] Hallelujah now some people say I won't
[58:33] say this a scriptural but I say some
[58:36] people say that when the Battle of
[58:41] Lucifer went on Hallelujah it was a
[58:45] reason why the world was in
[58:48] chaos I don't know how true that
[58:51] is but something caused the
[58:55] chaos you better hear what I'm saying
[58:58] because God is not not a god of
[59:01] confusion God doesn't bring chaos and
[59:04] the only being that we know that brings
[59:08] chaos is Lucifer
[59:11] himself because we realize that this
[59:14] battle that we're going
[59:16] through did not stop on
[59:19] earth started in heaven is that right
[59:23] where Lucifer told the lie hallelu and
[59:28] Angels believed
[59:31] him is that right and he and his angels
[59:36] was cast out of Heaven they were put
[59:39] into another
[59:41] dimension
[59:43] Hallelujah is that right in that same
[59:47] battle came to fight the image of
[59:51] God hallelujah and when he came
[59:55] he didn't go to Adam see the devil
[59:59] smart he went to the Miss
[1:00:02] Adam he went to the
[1:00:04] female Hallelujah because he
[1:00:08] knew she was the one that could bring
[1:00:11] the
[1:00:13] reproduction Hallelujah he brought his
[1:00:17] science Eve and Eve believed His
[1:00:23] science thought was
[1:00:25] good Hallelujah so the devil tried his
[1:00:29] science on
[1:00:30] Eve Hallelujah and then he brought the
[1:00:37] science brought it to
[1:00:39] Adam but you know what all Adam had to
[1:00:46] say was that man does not live by bread
[1:00:50] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:00:53] out of the mouth of
[1:00:55] God he could have
[1:00:58] resisted but he was
[1:01:01] ordained as a
[1:01:04] protector he was
[1:01:06] ordained as a
[1:01:09] provider he was
[1:01:11] ordained as a
[1:01:13] savior and so therefore he had to save
[1:01:17] eve even though it cost him his
[1:01:21] life is that right the Adam called Jesus
[1:01:26] Christ had to do the same
[1:01:29] thing he did no sin but the Bible said
[1:01:33] he became
[1:01:35] sin that we might become the
[1:01:37] righteousness of
[1:01:38] God it was because of the shedding of
[1:01:41] his
[1:01:43] blood Carrie was more than just saving
[1:01:50] people Calvary came to
[1:01:53] restore
[1:01:55] it came to restore
[1:01:57] everything man had
[1:02:00] lost in the
[1:02:03] fall it came to restore
[1:02:08] sunship it came to restore the
[1:02:11] authority is that right because
[1:02:15] remember the word of God says after
[1:02:18] which the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:02:22] you shall receive power
[1:02:25] that word power means
[1:02:27] Authority because that's what Adam
[1:02:30] lost he had no rulership over Satan
[1:02:34] anymore because he forfeited his
[1:02:37] kingdom to
[1:02:39] Satan is that the Bible it's absolutely
[1:02:43] the
[1:02:44] truth that's why
[1:02:46] Satan
[1:02:48] had how could had the
[1:02:51] ability to take Jesus upon on the
[1:02:53] mountain
[1:02:56] Satan had the ability to Temp Jesus in
[1:02:59] the
[1:03:00] wilderness yall hear what I'm saying
[1:03:03] because it was Satan's
[1:03:05] kingdom this is Satan's
[1:03:08] world this is what we call Satan's
[1:03:11] Eden he had a
[1:03:14] right and listen what he
[1:03:16] says if you bow down to
[1:03:20] me I will give you all of
[1:03:23] this
[1:03:24] he owned
[1:03:27] everything it used to belong to the
[1:03:29] first
[1:03:32] Adam now the second Adam Jesus Christ is
[1:03:36] come to
[1:03:38] redeem to take
[1:03:41] back what was taken from
[1:03:44] us hallelujah you see that's why I'm
[1:03:47] jumping a little bit I told you it's
[1:03:50] going to be in in different parts but
[1:03:52] you see that's why there will be no no
[1:03:54] babies in
[1:03:56] heaven everybody think you're going to
[1:03:58] see a baby it will not be a
[1:04:01] baby babies came by the way of the
[1:04:05] Fall Hallelujah I don't care who that
[1:04:08] baby is whether it be male or
[1:04:12] female if they are elected and chosen by
[1:04:15] God when they die by the time they get
[1:04:19] to
[1:04:20] heaven they're about an 18y old
[1:04:27] Hallelujah yes sir won't be no changing
[1:04:30] of diapers
[1:04:32] there Hallelujah won't be no bottle
[1:04:37] feeding you see let me let me I'm moving
[1:04:40] faster than what I should
[1:04:42] go but we were made in the image and
[1:04:45] likeness of
[1:04:47] God and and and even the scripture
[1:04:51] says did not I say ye are God
[1:04:56] now we are not the god there's only one
[1:05:00] God but we're part of the family of
[1:05:04] God we are the children of God y'all
[1:05:08] hear what I'm saying it was I was in a
[1:05:10] horse family I wouldn't be a pig I
[1:05:14] wouldn't be a
[1:05:16] donkey I wouldn't be a sheep if I was in
[1:05:20] the family of a horse I would be a
[1:05:24] Hallelujah and that is the way that
[1:05:27] works that's why the Bible calls us Sons
[1:05:31] and Daughters of God because if God
[1:05:34] would have a
[1:05:36] Offspring he could not produce anything
[1:05:39] other than
[1:05:41] himself the law that's the word the
[1:05:44] order in Genesis
[1:05:47] is shall bring forth of its
[1:05:51] kind hallel so God him
[1:05:54] himself humbled
[1:05:56] himself and became a
[1:06:01] seed he was able to lock all of his
[1:06:07] attributes in a seed yall hear me is
[1:06:11] that right cuz the Bible says that there
[1:06:14] was a good SE and he went to S seed he
[1:06:18] saw good seeds and those seeds were God
[1:06:23] there was another
[1:06:24] s he sld
[1:06:27] tears Hallelujah and he was of the
[1:06:30] wicked one here what I'm saying here so
[1:06:35] when Eve broke the order of
[1:06:39] God because men was supposed to be born
[1:06:42] and
[1:06:43] birth by the spoken
[1:06:47] word hallelujah did you not know that
[1:06:51] when the church first started
[1:06:54] on the day of
[1:06:55] Pentecost it was the preaching of the
[1:06:59] word they heard the
[1:07:02] word and they received the seed of the
[1:07:06] word hallelujah and it was there they
[1:07:09] were
[1:07:10] burn with the Holy Ghost and Fire y'all
[1:07:13] hear what I'm saying it was a spoken
[1:07:16] word y'all hear what I'm saying I'm say
[1:07:19] it again that order has not
[1:07:22] changed say I want the Holy Ghost it's
[1:07:26] supposed to be the preaching of the word
[1:07:29] that gives you the power of the Holy
[1:07:32] Ghost it's never
[1:07:35] changed amen hallelujah hallelujah see
[1:07:39] God has
[1:07:41] order the Sun by
[1:07:44] Day rules the the
[1:07:48] heavens the Moon by
[1:07:51] Night rules the heaven
[1:07:54] and the Stars y'all know how it
[1:07:56] works Hallelujah and ever since
[1:08:01] creation they have all remained in the
[1:08:04] same
[1:08:05] place people say I saw
[1:08:09] star no you
[1:08:12] didn't that might have been an
[1:08:15] asteroid or a piece of rock of some
[1:08:18] sort but the
[1:08:20] star they are
[1:08:22] stationed
[1:08:24] and the position in which God placed
[1:08:26] them
[1:08:28] in from the beginning they're still
[1:08:33] there Hallelujah is that right Orion is
[1:08:38] still
[1:08:39] there Orion is still there ples is still
[1:08:44] there Hallelujah Aquarius is still
[1:08:48] there all of those zodiac signs are
[1:08:52] still there
[1:08:54] not one star added and not one taken
[1:08:58] away yall better hear me so the stars
[1:09:02] are
[1:09:03] numbered
[1:09:05] hallelu this is why God said to
[1:09:08] Abraham look at of the
[1:09:11] sea I will multiply your children as
[1:09:16] such he didn't just leave us in the dust
[1:09:21] of the Earth but he says now look at
[1:09:23] into the
[1:09:25] heavens see those
[1:09:27] Stars they represent
[1:09:30] you Hallelujah can you count
[1:09:34] them hallelujah oh that devil thought by
[1:09:39] breaking the
[1:09:40] order of God
[1:09:43] here that he would cause
[1:09:46] chaos in the plan of
[1:09:49] God but he did
[1:09:52] not see he didn't understand that in the
[1:09:57] heart and mind of
[1:10:00] God saw himself as a
[1:10:04] savior Hallelujah I know y'all know
[1:10:07] these
[1:10:08] things but in order to be a
[1:10:11] savior there had to be someone that
[1:10:13] needed
[1:10:15] saving he saw himself as a
[1:10:19] Healer and in order to
[1:10:21] heal there had to be someone
[1:10:25] sick and the only perverted
[1:10:29] one that was there that could do
[1:10:32] that was Lucifer
[1:10:35] himself That Old
[1:10:39] Devil so in
[1:10:42] reality God used
[1:10:45] him to bring out of him his
[1:10:49] attributes
[1:10:51] hallelujah amen don't you realize that
[1:10:55] no matter what you do whatever happens
[1:10:58] to you God is in
[1:11:03] control Hallelujah he never
[1:11:07] fails yes
[1:11:09] sir glory to God they were so shocked
[1:11:13] and I'm going go on now go back to my
[1:11:16] notes they were so
[1:11:18] shocked when they were on the
[1:11:21] sea and the wind and the w
[1:11:24] caves began to toss the ship
[1:11:27] about Hallelujah is that right the sail
[1:11:32] broke and the ores
[1:11:34] broke and water start flooding the
[1:11:37] ship and here was
[1:11:40] Jesus in the bottom of the
[1:11:44] ship Hallelujah they didn't not
[1:11:48] see who he really
[1:11:50] was Hallelujah he was a man
[1:11:55] yet he was God y'all hear what I'm
[1:11:57] saying see the man part was
[1:12:01] asleep but the god part never sleep nor
[1:12:06] Slumber Hallelujah he didn't wake up in
[1:12:11] confusion but he woke up in
[1:12:14] control hear me he wasn't disturbed by
[1:12:17] the
[1:12:19] demons in the sea he wasn't disturbed by
[1:12:22] the demons Amen in the wind he wasn't
[1:12:26] disturbed by
[1:12:28] anything he literally had undisturbed
[1:12:31] Faith he stood on that boat like I said
[1:12:35] the other
[1:12:36] day please be
[1:12:39] still he didn't have the address to wind
[1:12:42] he didn't have the address to Sea he
[1:12:45] didn't have to address nothing but all
[1:12:48] all of those demons recognized who he
[1:12:52] was and had to Humble themselves and the
[1:12:56] storm had to cease y'all hear what I'm
[1:12:59] saying because I'm talking about
[1:13:03] Jesus but where is Jesus
[1:13:10] now time about coming to
[1:13:15] maturity coming to a
[1:13:17] place that we must allow
[1:13:20] God to place us back in in
[1:13:24] order because once the order is restored
[1:13:28] the image and the likeness is restored
[1:13:31] too y'all hear what I'm saying people
[1:13:33] don't understand how order is so
[1:13:36] important Hallelujah but order is uh is
[1:13:41] important because God is a god of
[1:13:44] order read the Bible every time Israel
[1:13:48] got out of
[1:13:50] order
[1:13:52] chaos
[1:13:54] Hallelujah all they had to do was follow
[1:13:58] the word and the word would keep was
[1:14:01] going to keep them in the proper
[1:14:04] order Hallelujah is that right the Bible
[1:14:07] said the first commandment he says love
[1:14:11] the Lord thy
[1:14:13] God with all your heart with all your
[1:14:17] mind with all your soul that was the
[1:14:21] first
[1:14:22] order
[1:14:24] Hallelujah and when you break that
[1:14:26] order expect
[1:14:29] chaos expect
[1:14:31] confusion if you don't love the Lord
[1:14:33] with all your
[1:14:35] heart your heart your life is going to
[1:14:37] be full of
[1:14:40] confusion and
[1:14:43] despair Hallelujah is that right that's
[1:14:46] why the Bible says trust the
[1:14:50] Lord and lean not to your own
[1:14:53] understanding but ackowledge him in all
[1:14:57] of your ways and he shall direct your
[1:15:01] path he's the leader the sheer the guide
[1:15:07] Hallelujah he is the only one that can
[1:15:11] lead and guide us into all
[1:15:15] truth hallelujah is that right all all
[1:15:20] the first Adam had to do
[1:15:24] would say uh I love you
[1:15:26] Adam Hallelujah but I can't do that cuz
[1:15:30] I must stay with the
[1:15:32] truth but had he done
[1:15:35] that uh the very plan of
[1:15:39] God would
[1:15:42] haveed Hallelujah because when God saw
[1:15:46] you and
[1:15:48] me he saw us as
[1:15:51] Sinners he knew we were Saints
[1:15:54] because we were with him before the
[1:15:55] foundation of the
[1:15:56] world but we have to travel to this
[1:16:01] Dimension we had to put on a robe of
[1:16:04] Flesh a Rob of sinful
[1:16:07] flesh Hallelujah because God wanted to
[1:16:11] prove to
[1:16:12] Lucifer you can take a man and bring him
[1:16:16] to the lowest
[1:16:18] State Hallelujah but as long as he got
[1:16:21] my seed in him
[1:16:25] he shall
[1:16:26] Prevail he's going to conquer every
[1:16:29] darkness that every
[1:16:33] stronghold everything you put on him I'm
[1:16:37] going to show you that the man that I
[1:16:40] create is your
[1:16:44] god yes sir amen amen y'all better hear
[1:16:48] what I'm saying Satan is not our
[1:16:52] God
[1:16:54] hallelujah amen right now the Bible said
[1:16:57] is all it all depends on who you you
[1:16:59] yield your members to
[1:17:02] obey Hallelujah if you're going to serve
[1:17:05] the Devil he's your
[1:17:06] God but if you going to serve the Lord
[1:17:09] Jesus Christ he's your
[1:17:10] God hallelujah like the B said choose
[1:17:13] you this day and who you're going to
[1:17:16] serve let's get back to the scripture
[1:17:18] here Genesis
[1:17:20] 1 26- 27
[1:17:24] you love the Lord see we we must
[1:17:27] understand by the grace of God image
[1:17:31] likeness and Order Hallelujah they were
[1:17:35] all in the order of God everything was
[1:17:39] even the name of the of the
[1:17:42] animals was in the order of
[1:17:44] God and Adam was the head of the
[1:17:48] garden Hallelujah that God was the head
[1:17:51] of
[1:17:52] Adam because when Adam forfeited his
[1:17:54] right to the
[1:17:57] Garden the real owner
[1:18:00] came to claim and possess the land y'all
[1:18:04] hear what I'm saying is that right the
[1:18:07] Bible say when Adam and Eve
[1:18:09] fell God walked in the cool of the
[1:18:13] evening and he said Where Art Thou
[1:18:16] Adam showing that Adam was the man in
[1:18:21] authority
[1:18:23] where thou is that the
[1:18:28] truth he didn't say where are where
[1:18:30] where where are you where are you all
[1:18:32] where are you where
[1:18:35] yall he he didn't that's the way you say
[1:18:38] it right no but he
[1:18:41] identifyed you said well he could have
[1:18:43] been talking to both of them
[1:18:44] no because the male
[1:18:47] Adam answered first so he knew who God
[1:18:51] was talking to
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:18:54] Hallelujah you understand me so he Adam
[1:19:00] was
[1:19:02] responsible for keeping eve even his
[1:19:06] wife that's right in
[1:19:09] order that's the Bible the Bible said if
[1:19:12] a man can't rule with his own
[1:19:14] house he's not even
[1:19:17] Rich to Ru the church y'all don't get
[1:19:20] quiet that's the order
[1:19:28] Hallelujah you love
[1:19:33] God okay
[1:19:36] Genesis where was that Genesis
[1:19:39] one I lost my place God is good to us
[1:19:43] anyhow oh yeah here it is and God said
[1:19:47] let us make man in our image after our
[1:19:49] likeness and let them have dominion over
[1:19:52] the fish of the sea and over the foul of
[1:19:55] the air and over the cattle and over all
[1:19:57] the Earth and over every creeping thing
[1:19:59] that creepeth upon the earth now there's
[1:20:02] nothing
[1:20:03] uncovered God covered the sea he covered
[1:20:07] the land he covered the air All
[1:20:11] Creatures was under the
[1:20:14] Dominion of
[1:20:16] Adam everything so you must understand
[1:20:21] what a Christian is is a Christian is a
[1:20:25] woman or a
[1:20:26] man that God is
[1:20:29] building into the perfect stature of
[1:20:33] Christ so that this particular
[1:20:36] scripture Hallelujah will be
[1:20:40] manifested in the sons of
[1:20:43] God y'all believe that it's the truth
[1:20:47] now
[1:20:49] periodically God would do little
[1:20:51] things Hallelujah like
[1:20:55] Elijah he was able to call down fire
[1:20:57] from
[1:20:58] heaven Hallelujah like Enoch who was
[1:21:03] translated little little bits and
[1:21:06] pieces like Moses Hallelujah that spoke
[1:21:10] to the to the Red
[1:21:12] Sea and the
[1:21:14] Sea y'all hear what I'm saying it's like
[1:21:18] when when when he struck to walk spoke
[1:21:20] to the
[1:21:21] Rock and hey The Rock gave water y
[1:21:26] understand me that wasn't a man that was
[1:21:29] God in the man you see what I'm saying
[1:21:32] God was giving us a little piece at a
[1:21:34] time of what we were maturing
[1:21:38] into Hallelujah and think about it they
[1:21:41] were just the
[1:21:43] shadow of what we ought to be come on
[1:21:47] somebody and if the shadow had such an
[1:21:50] authority what about the
[1:21:55] we got to elevate our mind we got to let
[1:21:59] go let God take
[1:22:01] control that's why the Bible said let
[1:22:04] this mind be in
[1:22:06] you hallelujah what mind the Mind who
[1:22:10] that thought it not robber it to Beal
[1:22:13] with
[1:22:15] God but he made himself of no
[1:22:19] reputation see that's why when you see
[1:22:21] these people say I'm a prophet
[1:22:24] see that ain't
[1:22:25] God real prophets don't want to even be
[1:22:30] known a real true
[1:22:32] Christian when somebody heal is get
[1:22:37] heal you you don't want oh I'mma tell
[1:22:39] you how it
[1:22:40] happened I slap my hand on that
[1:22:46] forehead and they were
[1:22:48] healed oh they weren't healed because
[1:22:50] you slapped their forehead
[1:22:54] the only way a man or woman is
[1:22:57] healed fa in the word
[1:23:00] God hallelujah it ain't what you do it's
[1:23:04] what he
[1:23:05] does there's no such thing as a Divine
[1:23:08] healer the only one I know of is God
[1:23:14] himself
[1:23:16] Hallelujah yes Lord have mercy you
[1:23:20] know tell you one thing
[1:23:23] Adam knew who he
[1:23:25] was cuz when he messed
[1:23:28] up he tried to
[1:23:31] hide as great as he was in the
[1:23:34] garden he knew that the great one is now
[1:23:38] come which was God himself y'all hear
[1:23:40] what I'm
[1:23:41] saying oh Lord help us
[1:23:43] Jesus so let's move on so God created
[1:23:47] man in his IM own image in the image of
[1:23:51] God created he him
[1:23:53] male and female created he
[1:23:56] them Hallelujah so we know we are in the
[1:24:00] image of
[1:24:01] God hands like a
[1:24:04] monkey feet like bear yall know y'all
[1:24:07] know the whole thing amen we were made
[1:24:09] after the creation of God or the animals
[1:24:12] that in which we would be ruling
[1:24:14] Hallelujah because God not only wanted
[1:24:17] to be in contact with man but he also
[1:24:20] wanted to be in contact with his
[1:24:24] that's the truth people well they dumb
[1:24:26] animals what dumb animals God they never
[1:24:29] created a dumb
[1:24:30] animal every animal is
[1:24:33] intelligent maybe they have a certain
[1:24:35] level of it the only thing that makes us
[1:24:38] different from the animal we have
[1:24:45] souls
[1:24:50] Hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:24:53] see God always hold man
[1:24:58] responsible and charge of his
[1:25:02] house can't get away from
[1:25:05] that when man fell like I said he asked
[1:25:09] Adam where thou
[1:25:12] Hallelujah and he went to Adam
[1:25:16] first asked him what have you
[1:25:19] done you know what I'm saying and Adam
[1:25:22] says blaming
[1:25:24] God the woman you gave
[1:25:29] me and then the woman said that old
[1:25:33] Serpent and there something about people
[1:25:36] when the truth is preached to them they
[1:25:39] do not want
[1:25:41] to all own up to
[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:25:45] it Hallelujah I I mean they sin had
[1:25:48] given them
[1:25:50] away when God left them or when God
[1:25:54] didn't they were first
[1:25:57] naked and didn't know it the glory of
[1:26:01] God was around them the light of God
[1:26:05] covered them like a
[1:26:07] blanket Hallelujah they didn't know what
[1:26:10] sex was they didn't know what sin was
[1:26:14] they were pure in
[1:26:16] heart but then when he questioned
[1:26:20] Adam Adam said I hear because I was
[1:26:24] naked and God did not
[1:26:26] say what made you
[1:26:30] naked he said
[1:26:32] who who had to be a
[1:26:36] person what could have been
[1:26:38] anything who told you you were
[1:26:43] naked Hallelujah that same old serpent
[1:26:47] that used to walk up on two
[1:26:50] feet that in tell ENT
[1:26:53] being Hallelujah that lied to e s don't
[1:26:59] that can't be true people say it was a
[1:27:02] snake that's that Theological Seminary
[1:27:07] lie he was a
[1:27:09] beast he's a beast in Genesis and in
[1:27:13] Revelation he's a beast and the Beast in
[1:27:16] Revelation is a man and the serpents in
[1:27:20] in in the Book of Matthew
[1:27:22] [Music]
[1:27:23] a that's
[1:27:26] right Hallelujah is that right right
[1:27:29] that's what John said John called him a
[1:27:32] generation of serpents a Generation of
[1:27:35] Vipers what do you mean in your
[1:27:38] poit devil orain to lead people to
[1:27:45] hell that's why the Bible says search
[1:27:49] the scriptures for them you find
[1:27:53] eternal life
[1:27:55] Hallelujah glory to God but one thing I
[1:27:59] want to say about
[1:28:01] this God knows them that are
[1:28:06] his In His Image Enlighten is created
[1:28:10] him and they broke the
[1:28:14] order let me tell you something what we
[1:28:16] see
[1:28:17] here this is not the kingdom of God we
[1:28:20] even come to church
[1:28:22] but the kingdom of God is within
[1:28:24] you it ain't in this chair or even in
[1:28:27] this building Hallelujah in
[1:28:31] persons Hallelujah is that right and we
[1:28:34] all come together to worship God as
[1:28:38] Savior and
[1:28:43] deliverer Hallelujah like I said what we
[1:28:46] see here is not the kingdom of God the
[1:28:49] kingdom of God is within you it is joy
[1:28:52] peace and
[1:28:54] righteousness in the Holy
[1:28:56] Ghost and it is a spiritual
[1:29:00] Kingdom Hallelujah you can't see it but
[1:29:04] it can be
[1:29:05] manifested hallah you can't see the wind
[1:29:10] but the wind can be
[1:29:11] manifested when you see the trees leaves
[1:29:14] blowing and moving you don't see the
[1:29:17] wind but you see the effects of the Wind
[1:29:22] the Bible says the Holy Ghost is like a
[1:29:25] wind you don't know from when it came
[1:29:28] you don't know which it's going but in
[1:29:31] its
[1:29:32] travel there's a
[1:29:35] manifestation of that wind Hallelujah
[1:29:40] that's why people can't understand
[1:29:44] Christians a friend of
[1:29:46] mine was talking to me
[1:29:49] today and he said that you know he like
[1:29:52] to wear those Jesus
[1:29:53] shirts I wear them every now and again
[1:29:56] or have worn them every now and again
[1:29:58] with something on it with Jesus on it
[1:30:02] you know you got Christians that are
[1:30:03] frown at
[1:30:04] that Hallelujah ain't nothing wrong with
[1:30:08] it and if you want to you know you wear
[1:30:10] a baseball cap with everything else on
[1:30:13] it you got a team over here and a team
[1:30:16] over
[1:30:17] there and some of us wear these shoes
[1:30:19] with a Nike symbol on it so much stuff
[1:30:23] there's nothing wrong with it but I find
[1:30:25] that most Christians are ashamed to wear
[1:30:27] Church like
[1:30:28] that
[1:30:30] Hallelujah listen don't make that a
[1:30:32] Doctrine now I'm just saying that's your
[1:30:36] preference on what you want to do but
[1:30:38] the man was telling him that why you
[1:30:40] believe in that
[1:30:42] Jesus he he knows some scripture too
[1:30:45] he's a he's a he's a a devil that's what
[1:30:48] he is this man this man this man is a
[1:30:51] devil
[1:30:52] he goes to the scriptures and pervert it
[1:30:55] and he tells this man you a sinner read
[1:30:57] this look at your clothes you got this
[1:31:00] material you got that material and you
[1:31:03] going to go to
[1:31:05] hell and the man said he he's not a
[1:31:09] Believer I told my friend he's a liar
[1:31:12] for
[1:31:13] sure he is a
[1:31:16] Believer if he wasn't a
[1:31:18] Believer you wouldn't be making him
[1:31:20] angry
[1:31:23] amen why is he angry if he don't believe
[1:31:26] what what he sees here he don't want to
[1:31:29] see a real Christian and that's all the
[1:31:32] other Christians don't do this we're not
[1:31:34] other
[1:31:35] Christians we're real
[1:31:37] Christians Hallelujah we behave in a
[1:31:40] certain way we're not ashamed of the
[1:31:43] gospel of Christ it is a power of God
[1:31:45] unto
[1:31:47] salvation hallelujah we're OD balls
[1:31:50] that's the way it is
[1:31:53] then y'all go too far oh no I haven't
[1:31:57] gone far
[1:31:59] enough Hallelujah when I'm standing in
[1:32:04] heaven behind the
[1:32:07] Gates Hallelujah then tell me I've gone
[1:32:11] too
[1:32:14] far

[1:32:29] on the

[1:37:20] death hallelujah how can you miss it
[1:37:23] seeing the serpent seed Hallelujah that
[1:37:27] which happened in the garden it's a
[1:37:30] reason why we're suffering
[1:37:32] now Hallelujah if we had only come
[1:37:35] through Adam the first
[1:37:38] Adam I don't know what it would have
[1:37:39] been
[1:37:40] like but one thing I'm going truly
[1:37:43] say we needed
[1:37:47] this Adam and Eve we don't know how long
[1:37:49] they were in the garden before the fall
[1:37:54] but no doubt Adam would look into that
[1:37:56] beautiful face and said oh I just love
[1:37:58] you
[1:37:59] Eve now her name weren't Eve it was Adam
[1:38:01] that must have sound funny but
[1:38:05] anyway and and he would she would turn
[1:38:07] around and said I love you too husband
[1:38:11] Adam but you know what you don't know
[1:38:14] what real love
[1:38:17] is until somebody cross your
[1:38:22] your
[1:38:24] beliefs let me put this way until
[1:38:27] somebody do
[1:38:28] something that's
[1:38:30] contrary to your
[1:38:36] Constitution when when Eve
[1:38:41] Sinn Adam
[1:38:44] felt how much he loved
[1:38:47] her and he was willing to die
[1:38:52] because he knew he could not live
[1:38:54] without
[1:38:55] her y hear what I'm saying so is it with
[1:39:00] the second Adam Jesus
[1:39:02] Christ he couldn't live without you is
[1:39:06] that the truth he said father in the
[1:39:08] 17th chapter of St
[1:39:11] John I would that they be with
[1:39:15] me I want them to be with me Hallelujah
[1:39:20] you love the Lord see we we we we must
[1:39:24] understand the order must be
[1:39:27] restored and I'm going to say it like
[1:39:29] this now everybody is not living in a a
[1:39:33] position or a way where they can restore
[1:39:36] order as the scripture says but those of
[1:39:40] us who both
[1:39:43] Partners in this message and love this
[1:39:47] word the order of the house must come
[1:39:52] into
[1:39:55] play yall hear what I'm
[1:39:58] saying before they could even make an
[1:40:01] exit
[1:40:02] D out of
[1:40:06] Egypt God told them get your house in
[1:40:12] order the order of the house is
[1:40:15] important because if the order of the
[1:40:17] house is
[1:40:19] right the order of the church will be
[1:40:23] right y'all hear what I'm saying now
[1:40:26] everybody can't do that but for those of
[1:40:29] us who can do
[1:40:30] that the order must be
[1:40:33] restored what are you saying the wife
[1:40:37] can't rule the
[1:40:40] [Music]
[1:40:42] husband God told
[1:40:44] Adam You Will Rule
[1:40:48] her now don't get me wrong
[1:40:51] we're not talking about making our wife
[1:40:54] some kind of door matad or something
[1:40:55] like
[1:40:56] that he must rule her by love is that
[1:41:00] the way
[1:41:01] God hallelujah he loves us and the Bible
[1:41:06] said when we recognize that love when we
[1:41:10] make mistakes it brings us to
[1:41:13] repentance the goodness of God is
[1:41:16] supposed to lead men to
[1:41:19] repentance hallelu
[1:41:21] yes sir it's not like I am the boss
[1:41:26] no and sisters if you're the boss you
[1:41:30] going you need to ask God to help
[1:41:32] you because you're out of
[1:41:35] order hello we talking about making a
[1:41:39] Rapture you got to submit
[1:41:42] yourself you say oh brother I ain't got
[1:41:44] to do that wait wait wait wait let me
[1:41:46] let me let me let me just go back to one
[1:41:48] scripture here Hebrews 13
[1:41:52] I know what denominations used to do
[1:41:53] that they used to read the scripture and
[1:41:55] beat you over the head with a big big
[1:41:58] old piece of wood or
[1:42:03] something is this okay we going to
[1:42:05] preach it anyhow Hebrews
[1:42:08] 13 beginning at the 17th verse obey them
[1:42:13] that have rule over
[1:42:15] you and submit
[1:42:19] yourselves
[1:42:21] well I don't like when people tell me
[1:42:22] what to
[1:42:24] do don't let your boss at work hear you
[1:42:27] that say
[1:42:29] that for they watch for your
[1:42:32] souls as they must give an account we're
[1:42:35] talking about pastors
[1:42:37] now that they may do it with
[1:42:42] joy and not with grief but that is
[1:42:46] unprofitable for you why because don't
[1:42:50] you know your pastor will have to stand
[1:42:53] before God before
[1:42:55] you and he's going to have to give an
[1:42:58] account he's got to tell the
[1:43:00] truth about your
[1:43:04] behavior that's all I'm
[1:43:07] saying pray for us Paul
[1:43:10] says for We Trust we have a good
[1:43:14] conscience and all things
[1:43:16] willing to live
[1:43:19] honestly
[1:43:21] that's that's it a true man of God want
[1:43:25] to have a good
[1:43:26] conscience and and he want to be
[1:43:29] honest Hallelujah and so if he's
[1:43:32] watching for your
[1:43:34] soul he's going to tell you the
[1:43:37] truth regardless to how it hurts and
[1:43:41] he's going to tell you the truth even
[1:43:43] when he knows you're not going to accept
[1:43:47] it that's good word hallelujah now let
[1:43:50] move on see it's just not it's just it
[1:43:53] works in the the regular house of a
[1:43:56] husband and wife and the authority also
[1:43:59] works in the
[1:44:03] church
[1:44:05] Hallelujah don't you even think that's
[1:44:07] how you'll know whether your nature is
[1:44:10] changed because when your nature is
[1:44:14] changed you're not ready to kill your
[1:44:19] brother amen is that right because when
[1:44:22] Cain and
[1:44:23] Abel when they were in you know at the
[1:44:28] altar and and God
[1:44:31] received Abel's
[1:44:33] sacrifice Cain got
[1:44:36] angry it shows the two
[1:44:39] Natures one nature was of Adam the other
[1:44:42] nature was of of the
[1:44:44] devil is that right Jude even said Jude
[1:44:47] I think that's Jude that even said that
[1:44:50] that that that that Cain was of that
[1:44:52] Wicked one Hallelujah So Adam wasn't the
[1:44:56] wicked one it was a serpent who was a
[1:44:59] wicked one and it was a serpent who was
[1:45:02] the father of
[1:45:04] Cain I know there's a lot to swall but
[1:45:06] it's
[1:45:07] true Hallelujah so what happened the
[1:45:11] fall brought us
[1:45:13] chaos instead of now having
[1:45:17] God ruling over everything
[1:45:21] Satan has repositioned
[1:45:24] himself and now he is the prince of the
[1:45:27] air he's the
[1:45:30] principalities he's the ruler of this
[1:45:33] world it's the devil the darkness that's
[1:45:37] why people now in this
[1:45:39] day is openly worshiping
[1:45:43] Satan because of the time we're living
[1:45:46] in
[1:45:48] now he feels like he's about ready ready
[1:45:50] to be en
[1:45:52] thron and he really will be
[1:45:55] enth y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:45:58] but at the same
[1:46:00] time Satan is being enr the blood of
[1:46:04] Jesus
[1:46:05] Christ is to be
[1:46:07] enthroned Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm
[1:46:10] saying this is the
[1:46:13] battle started from the
[1:46:16] beginning but in order for this to work
[1:46:20] order must be
[1:46:23] restored oh just so much I can say in
[1:46:26] that but I can't Hallelujah let me read
[1:46:30] uh uh uh here in Isaiah
[1:46:33] 9 glory to God Isaiah
[1:46:36] 9 you love the
[1:46:39] Lord 9
[1:46:41] and6 showing that Adam had to come me
[1:46:44] Jesus Christ had to come to
[1:46:49] restore
[1:46:51] is that right so
[1:46:56] what Isaiah 9
[1:46:59] 6-7 says For unto us a child is
[1:47:03] born unto us a son is
[1:47:06] given and the government shall be upon
[1:47:09] his shoulder and his name Shall be
[1:47:11] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[1:47:14] God the Everlasting father the prince of
[1:47:17] peace now that is so powerful
[1:47:21] Hallelujah a born a child is
[1:47:23] born in the Book of
[1:47:25] Revelation it says Jesus
[1:47:28] Christ the the beginning of God's
[1:47:31] creation it was here in Mary's
[1:47:34] womb where God began to
[1:47:37] create a body for
[1:47:40] himself y'all hear what I'm saying it
[1:47:42] wasn't Jewish blood it wasn't Gentile
[1:47:45] blood it wasn't Joseph blood it wasn't
[1:47:48] Mary blood God created it was God's
[1:47:52] blood he created the the the the egg and
[1:47:56] he created the the ger life Hallelujah
[1:48:00] it wasn't a sexual Affair between God
[1:48:04] and and Mary it was a supernatural
[1:48:09] visitation Hallelujah he was born
[1:48:13] God amen amen he had a
[1:48:19] theophany
[1:48:21] Hallelujah and he had a
[1:48:23] name and he had a
[1:48:26] name Hallelujah he came in here as a
[1:48:32] ruler you said wait a minute brother
[1:48:34] books let me tell you something David

[1:48:38] king and he was a boy
[1:48:41] King and even when he was a
[1:48:43] boy he still was King yall understand me
[1:48:48] he still was a ruler was the king of
[1:48:51] Israel he was anointed
[1:48:53] king Hallelujah is that right because
[1:48:57] when Jesus was
[1:48:58] born that's what the angel song they
[1:49:01] sing songs about him being a
[1:49:04] king the three wise men King they we
[1:49:07] came to see the king he was baby but yet
[1:49:11] he was a
[1:49:12] king Hall you might be a baby in Christ

[1:49:46] Earth see because we got to come back
[1:49:49] because this Earth is
[1:49:51] ours Hallelujah and and that's why we'll
[1:49:54] be
[1:49:56] transplanted transplanted from that
[1:49:59] Dimension to this Dimension we won't
[1:50:02] come back as babies no more we'll come
[1:50:05] all the
[1:50:06] redeemed we come back riding on
[1:50:10] horses Hallelujah with Jesus in the
[1:50:14] front Hallelujah however he interprets
[1:50:17] that we come back to earth
[1:50:20] to possess the Earth and guess what to
[1:50:24] rule it we come to rule
[1:50:27] Earth thousand
[1:50:30] years and that's just the
[1:50:33] beginning Hallelujah after that eternity
[1:50:37] finally sets

[1:51:41] government shall be upon his
[1:51:43] shoulder that is the strength of a man
[1:51:46] his shoulder y understand me that's why
[1:51:50] the Levites had to carry the Ark of the
[1:51:53] Covenant upon their shoulders it's the
[1:51:56] strength of the man and the shoulder

[1:53:09] that like I said when Jesus showed he
[1:53:13] was the
[1:53:15] Resurrection The the devil was surely
[1:53:17] upset
[1:53:18] then what devil didn't
[1:53:21] understand that Jesus said I am the
[1:53:24] resurrection he just didn't get it he
[1:53:27] didn't get it because he raised Lazarus
[1:53:30] from the dead I think the devil thought
[1:53:32] when Jesus died on Calvary he was going
[1:53:35] to hold him down in there in hell but
[1:53:39] hold him down in hell but Jesus was on a
[1:53:43] mission Hallelujah is that right he was

[1:53:47] mission Hallelujah he went to hell for
[1:53:52] me Hallelujah y'all he the devil didn't

[1:54:03] iniquities with the stripes we healed
[1:54:06] him and and the whole time those demons
[1:54:09] beating him they were beating him for me
[1:54:13] they were beating him for you Hallelujah
[1:54:16] when they pierc him in his
[1:54:17] hands they they did that from me because
[1:54:21] he was he was covering the whole body
[1:54:24] y'all hear me piercing both
[1:54:27] hands nailed in both feet Hallelujah
[1:54:30] said well I I don't have no feet trouble
[1:54:33] I don't have no leg trouble I don't have
[1:54:36] no hey but he didn't stop
[1:54:38] there they shove that sword in his
[1:54:42] side God didn't just take care of the
[1:54:45] outside he put the sword on the
[1:54:48] inside you got cancer of the LI cancer
[1:54:54] of the heart I don't care what kind of

[1:55:23] body even the
[1:55:26] heart those of you who have had broken
[1:55:29] hearts historian said he died from a
[1:55:32] broken heart now if he died from a
[1:55:34] broken heart that means your heart can
[1:55:37] be
[1:55:39] fixed
[1:55:41] Hallelujah yes sir listen let's move on
[1:55:45] of the increase of his government and
[1:55:48] peace there shall be no end and upon the
[1:55:52] throne of David and upon his kingdom to

[1:56:00] it with judgment and with Justice from
[1:56:04] hence forth even
[1:56:06] forever the Zeal of the Lord of
[1:56:09] hosts will
[1:56:12] this Hallelujah so you must understand
[1:56:17] God want the world to know
[1:56:20] he's alive and
[1:56:22] well hallelujah amen when he heals you
[1:56:26] he wants you to tell it when he delivers
[1:56:29] you he wants you to tell it come on if
[1:56:32] it's a real event you be able to keep
[1:56:36] your mouth shut
[1:56:39] anyhow is that right cuz he hear those
[1:56:42] people in the in the in the gospel say
[1:56:44] don't go tell
[1:56:48] nobody it was like telling them go tell
[1:56:51] it they went and they told
[1:56:54] it you love the Lord I'm almost done
[1:56:57] with this
[1:56:58] portion because of their
[1:57:01] transgression the order of procreation
[1:57:04] was broken and
[1:57:06] changed we were to be to be created by
[1:57:10] the spoken
[1:57:12] word you say that ain't
[1:57:15] true well where
[1:57:17] did those three three
[1:57:20] men where did they come
[1:57:23] from who went down to
[1:57:27] Abraham they all of a sudden
[1:57:30] appeared where did they come
[1:57:33] from God spoke
[1:57:36] it yall understand me and at his word
[1:57:41] everything must come to
[1:57:43] pass Hallelujah am you understand me so
[1:57:47] we look at these things and we we fail
[1:57:48] to see
[1:57:50] when God speaks a
[1:57:52] word little becomes
[1:57:56] much a few fish of
[1:57:59] loaves few fish and five loaves of
[1:58:02] bread fed 5,000 one
[1:58:05] time or 3,000 One
[1:58:08] Time come on a little boy's
[1:58:14] lunch when God speaks he's the Creator
[1:58:19] Hallelujah and then he gives that
[1:58:21] ability and a power to his own
[1:58:25] children is that right Elijah said it
[1:58:28] will not
[1:58:29] rain till I call for
[1:58:32] it God gave him that
[1:58:35] Authority and God giving his children
[1:58:38] he's restoring
[1:58:40] back Hallelujah that that man and that
[1:58:43] woman that we supposed to be God wants
[1:58:46] to restore that I don't care how messed
[1:58:48] up you are your mind you could have you
[1:58:51] you could have G you could have been on
[1:58:53] all kind of drugs you could have been on
[1:58:56] crack and whatever else they got out
[1:58:58] there but God
[1:59:00] restores y'all hear what I'm saying God
[1:59:03] is rest he's a god of
[1:59:05] restoration y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:59:07] oh I can't remember the way I used to be
[1:59:10] God can restore
[1:59:12] you you get the Holy Ghost and God will
[1:59:16] restore
[1:59:18] everything has taken from
[1:59:21] you Hallelujah most of all and I'm going
[1:59:24] to close right here most of all he
[1:59:26] changed your
[1:59:29] nature that's that's the greatest
[1:59:31] thing
[1:59:33] Hallelujah you know I I I've told you
[1:59:36] before when I was in the
[1:59:38] world I used to
[1:59:40] drink but I don't I don't have a desire
[1:59:44] to drink
[1:59:45] anymore and when I'm around alcohol I
[1:59:48] don't get n
[1:59:50] nervous I got to get away from here
[1:59:52] because I might just uhuh I don't have
[1:59:55] that because there is nothing in me see
[1:59:59] the demon that had me drinking when God
[2:00:01] saved me he took
[2:00:03] it he had to go the strong man came
[2:00:07] in somebody help me here and right now I
[2:00:11] can drink real communion
[2:00:15] wine and never have to say oh I got to
[2:00:18] get me some more
[2:00:20] understand me cuz there is no demon in
[2:00:23] me that thirst for
[2:00:24] that so what I'm trying to say is when
[2:00:27] God changes your nature there is no
[2:00:30] demons in
[2:00:32] you I'm talking about your soul now
[2:00:35] there is nothing in your soul is the
[2:00:39] ruler everything else in that spirit
[2:00:41] world must
[2:00:43] die but I I found out by listening to a
[2:00:46] message the other
[2:00:48] day the only way you can get the true
[2:00:50] Holy
[2:00:51] Spirit you got to earnestly judge
[2:00:55] [Music]
[2:00:57] yourself you got to judge yourself you
[2:01:00] got to come before God and tell God
[2:01:02] exactly the way it is and you got to let
[2:01:04] him know You' been a rank cner and you
[2:01:07] worthy of
[2:01:09] hell and then once you judge yourself
[2:01:12] and God sees that your your judgment is
[2:01:15] accurate he will then judge you and send
[2:01:18] the holy Ghost and
[2:01:21] Fire that's how the Holy Ghost comes
[2:01:24] after you have judged
[2:01:28] yourself no Hiding Place don't even
[2:01:31] don't even dare try to hide you got
[2:01:34] something in you that you don't want to
[2:01:35] tell God he'll leave you right there
[2:01:40] until you ready to give it up I mean
[2:01:42] give it
[2:01:43] up you can say Lord I don't know how to
[2:01:45] give it up but help me Lord he knows the
[2:01:49] earnest of your heart and he sees the
[2:01:52] earnest of your
[2:01:54] heart in that Holy Ghost in fire it
[2:01:58] sanctify you it'll take all desire from
[2:02:03] you
[2:02:05] Hallelujah yes it's the truth I used to
[2:02:08] be a dancer out there I mean a r i mean

[2:03:28] this when you get
[2:03:30] married and you have children you better
[2:03:33] preach to them the Holy
[2:03:36] Ghost you better teach them that they
[2:03:38] need a change of
[2:03:41] nature CU when they get of age and that
[2:03:45] nature hasn't
[2:03:46] changed guess what they going to
[2:03:49] resurrect you and your
[2:03:53] wife and a few cousins in all that come
[2:03:56] through
[2:03:58] there I know what I'm talking
[2:04:02] about I see some of my daughters say
[2:04:04] that's my
[2:04:05] sister the things they do I see
[2:04:08] it but it's because they need to be born
[2:04:12] again that that that that first seed is
[2:04:16] corruptible we need an Incorruptible SE
[2:04:19] to
[2:04:20] take y'all hear what I'm
[2:04:22] saying oh my goodness it's it just it
[2:04:25] amazes me that's why we've got to teach
[2:04:28] these kids the order the order one thing
[2:04:31] I love about
[2:04:33] Israel teach their
[2:04:37] children they might know nothing but the
[2:04:42] law but those little kids
[2:04:45] know now it's they they ain't born again
[2:04:48] either
[2:04:50] and and when I went to Israel I thought
[2:04:51] I was going to see all them holy
[2:04:54] folks he he a rabbi coming down all in
[2:04:57] his
[2:05:01] Gars I was in

[2:05:14] Orthodox Jew an je Orthodox and he was
[2:05:18] drun

[2:05:28] that law is only there to break
[2:05:31] it you love the Lord let's stand let's
[2:05:34] stand this is just part one by the grace
[2:05:36] of
[2:05:38] God I've got a lot of things I'd like to

[2:05:49] us aware that we are at a time the death
[2:05:52] Angels is in the land don't be
