today that were in amen praise God amen open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you oh I want to see you Oh open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you would I want to see you to see you hi little shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you oh I want to see you to see you hi little shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you would I want to see you open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you oh I want to see you open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you who I want to see you brother Keith come open with word of Prayer amen if there's any testimony here prayer request last Thursday I had decided is gonna drop by and get my vehicle serviced and their normal servicing requirements and they inspected it it's a made by Toyota dodges and a Toyota but it's made by them and I go they're been using them for years they wrote up an inspection that it was just the other than the oil and the grease and the filter it was in great shape and get over to work and leave for lunch that day and stopped to get gas before I went and man walked up very courteous and said your radiators leaking and you know you're first outsiders why it wasn't that seen before but then I got really that real fast knowing that they did the best they could so I called over there and asked him if I'd look at it make sure they didn't overfill it or so I walked over and talked to the service man and he said he'd look at it called me within middle of my lunch said it was a bad radiator and the good news is it was under warranty it's a warranty it's a used vehicle I bought right after I was rear-ended a couple years ago and so I was very thankful and bought that in the midst and none of us want to go through those things new way it's just a little bit of a hardship that I was thanking God for these these trials because they're precious and I was just waiting for God to reveal himself and so all of a sudden I get a phone call from a guy in Cincinnati Ohio I've been trying to pursue for work for almost a year and he said Keith this is this is wrong Lycans he says you know I'm ready to ready get this thing done I need to get this bought I said that's great I said there's a big job so I it was just like it I can't get my brain wrapped around why he was calling me knowing that was trying to do work with the man for a lot of long time and so I just thank God the way he brought that and didn't allow me to get all revved up and you know how easy it is to get revved up when something's not working just right but I think thank God it is a testimony of the man took Toyota and on top of it it went over to were the vehicle I bought the vehicle the manufacturer over there the dealer manufacturer and he gave me a brand new vehicle to use unlimited at no cost I thought it was this like God just kept pouring these things out and I just thought well praise the Lord you just don't never understand what it's all about and I I tell you some carnal things that those are all kind of carnal but I know that each one of those men needed a testimony from God that you're you are a walking a put some God known and read by all men the scripture says the whole world and if you can fathom this the whole world was waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God each one of those people each one of us are are waiting for that manifestation so praise God even when these things happen that don't seem to be so nice you know in our schedule but they were required God have permitted that to happen so does anybody else have a a testimony you'd like to you praise God good to see everybody here this morning it is a time we call Easter the world was designated the holidays it's not so much as a resurrection of Christ even and for some people's eyes and it's more Easter eggs and bunnies and whatever he goes with that is very grievious to a Christian to see that happen because you know that that's the resurrection were commanded to walk in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and it's for those people who have that promise that are going to be in the resurrection and that's no small thing it's why I live my life fully expecting that any moment any a moment of the hour so anybody else it says bow our heads and our hearts father God we come to you this morning humbly father in the name of Jesus Christ under your shed blood of the blood of God that paid the sin debt for the whole world Lord we thank you Lord for your presence this morning thank you for raising us up and giving us a desire to go before you to prepare for the day if all that God we thank you Lord for such love that you'd lay your life down for us Lord and we thank you for the token of the Holy Spirit of your life that you provided to dwell within our hearts Lord in our souls we thank you Lord for each and every person that has come out this morning lord I pray that you do beyond what we can do for ourselves that you just brood over our hearts the soil of our hearts and give us a soil that receive your righteous words Lord that that word will grow deep wrong roots and grow to have long sheets Road to have preached Lord I pray father God you you forgive us for any carnal thoughts we've had today or any anticipations that are not of you but you said to seek first the kingdom of God and all these other things will be added things that we are in need of in this life and you said the kingdom of God is not eating meat and drinking but it's peace and joy and righteousness and the Holy Ghost Lord we don't want to get this wrong we don't want to seek contrary to what you've told us to seek Lord we thank you for your provision today that those who have family gatherings Lord that we can join together the very presence of the holy God thanking you or for your provision for us this day for all that you may have for us to stay we pray father God that that you just now prepared this place Lord that nothing stand between our brother and brother I say and delivering the word that the word go forth and that nothing stand before this pulpit Lord and the jaws of clay but that word goes through to each one of us Lord without interference I pray if there being a spiritual wickedness present today that it rebound and pulled down and placed in confinement that it be swept away father God that you're in angels Lord encompass about this sanctuary that you anoint and Lord to minister to us according to our needs Lord we receive you every jot and tiddle Lord you said man cannot live by bread alone but every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God and Lord we receive every jot and tiddle of your word Lord we we just reach out to you now Lord to prepare us to receive that word we thank you for the

surely they had to be in the house of the Lord I am truly happy in Jesus we had a wonderful time in Iowa City last night or the days is down there really preached a wonderful message he'll try to make it before the service is out if not God knows but you know God is good to us we are a blessed people I like to live like I'm blessed we here celebrating the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ it ought to be a little more noise in him all I know is that I'm carrying my own fire he gave it to me and I'm gonna not let anyone put it out this is a glorious day I was thinking about it this morning I said the Christians altar labor this and this day as new years because it began not on just the new years but a new era is that right you got to understand that a ad and BC BC was turned to ad they say they don't believe in God and yet they changed their calendar we love the Lord revelations 5 1 through 12 little thoughts that the Lord had given me and I trust by God's grace that through his mercy we'd be able to preach this message we're trying not to be long seeing that we're kind of joining morning and evening together those who have to leave we understand no problem just we just want to celebrate and out I was thinking how Jesus rose in the morning and you know it won't be exactly morning but but we honor this resurrection by preaching the word and not only that but by a communion service as well revelations 5 1 through 12 and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose to see as they're wrong and no man in heaven or in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because of no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and other beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints and they saw her new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof but thou was slain and have redeemed us to God by the blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and have made us unto made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousands and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings amen one more scripture please you don't have to turn there I'll just read it and I'll let you be seated coming from Psalms 14:1 two three The Fool have said in his heart there is no God they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that do it good the Lord looked down from heaven and upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek God they are they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one amen amen let us pray father we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and everything you have done for us we pray here this morning that your perfect will be done Lord breaking the store the yokes of the enemy Lord as we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I like to entitle this message and I know it's going to sound pretty strong being that this is the morning that we are celebrating the resurrection but you and I must understand that there are a lot of people in this world who still don't believe in God that is what makes America difficult when it comes to missionary work and trying to work with people about the Lord Jesus because before we could even introduce a god we must first make them believe that there is a God because there are so many people today who do not believe in God now we said in the church and we say that we believe in God but to believe in God is to act upon the word in which he has spoken is one thing to say believe with the word and that word believe is not just a word of a sentence but it's an action word because if you really believe you're gonna act upon the things in which you have heard now you say what is the rest of the story because that's the theme of it here is the rest of the story you know we have heard that Jesus Christ died and you know that's history it is a known fact that crucified him there in Rome and many people may not understand this but it wasn't just the Romans that crucified Christ but it was the Church of that day they were the ones who crucified Christ who delivered him over into pilots hand Pilate in itself tried to get away from the position that he held he could have part on Jesus but we realized they meant instead of part of Jesus he washed his hands thinking that he could wash the blood of Jesus Christ off of his hands but once coming in contact with God there is no way that you can wash your hands clean of him once you come in contact once you know about Jesus now he's on your hand now you become one who stands in the audience of his crucifixion you and you at some point in your life will crucify him or you will be like merry cry out what has he done we are in a day that we're living in there's a little story that heard this morning somebody Sydney by way of a text message and they said that there was uh these atheists who were in the courtroom and trying to convince the judge that they ought to have a holiday and they tried to be as emotional as they possibly could be to try to convince and persuade the judge that atheist needs a holiday you know Jews got Hanukkah and all of these other holidays and of course Christmas and Easter they said that the Christians had and then all of a sudden be judge took the mallet and he slammed it on the desk and say ah case dismissed he said you already got a holiday he said today is April Fool's this is your holiday he said because the Bible says a man is a fool who do not believe so I thought that was pretty good seeing that today is April's food and you know as no is it's not a coincidence that this this Easter is is landing on what we call April Fool's because there are many people who will not go to church there are many people who will not consider themselves as Christians or but even law to be one only because they take the foolish way you know we look at this thing and I thought when I was thinking about the message but I thought about foolish men foolish men like Cain where God told Cain you should do like your brother and if you go and do like your brother I will receive you now we understand that Abel was the one who actually sacrifice a lamb unto the Lord and the blood sacrifice was accepted by God and of course Cain was the one who tilled the ground you know he had the he represents them what we call the Karno or the normal church because he was worshipping God but he wasn't worshiping God in spirit and truth you and I must understand the Cain worship God according to his own wiill and its own desires amen it wasn't a revelation that made him go out and do what he did it was what he wanted to do he figured that God would accept him if he was to present to God something that was beautiful or what he thought was more beautiful than came you and I must understand that came amen a thought like most men today that God will receive their way of worship but the Bible said in order for a man to worship Him he must worship Him in spirit and in truth and God always offered that to everybody but God is a gentleman he will never make a person worship him is that Alright you think about a man called Nimrod it was Nimrod was a man after the flood and Nimrod considered himself I guess a smart ingenious person he was a conqueror up and he literally conquered the people of that day and that day was easy to conquer because he did not have to learn the various languages something like German or French or English or whatever but anyway they had one language and so therefore it was easy for them to communicate and of course amen what did he do amen he gathered these people together and he forced them amen to build a Tower of Babel and the whole point was was to outsmart God there is no way that you and I can outsmart God amen that is a foolish conception amen and in order to understand what a fool is I looked at word up a fool is a man who was considered weak-minded and idiotic he is a silly or stupid person and you already know those words were pretty bad either right you know how they talk with the babies you so silly well you don't understand you actually cursing your children silly is weak minded and lacking good sense I looked it up that's what the dictionary said unless the word have changed but you and I must understanding then that we have to be careful on the things that we say because out of our mouths and then proceed life or death you think Judis and i'm getting into the word i'm just kind of laying something out here I trust that none of us will end up as foolish men those who will not hear the Word of God those who will not be obedient to God those who will reason the Word of God saying that God is not the same and God is not requiring us to do those things that he did require for the earlier church to do you and I must understand that Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he is a God that change is not so you and I must understand that God doesn't change his word doesn't change even though people change so we find out that Judas walked with Jesus for three and a half years Amen he was one a man that was considered at one of the disciples he even had a a bishopric but we understand because he he he allowed reasoning to get into his logic his way of thinking it was logic over whatever it was a man he allowed those things to get in and he felt like he could maneuver the word he could maneuver Christ into what he wanted Jesus Christ to do and you and I understand that when he went out to to betray Christ I don't even understand it I really don't understand it and I trust God will not allow me ever to betray him but you think about even in the Garden of Eden how the Tree of Life walked how they talked with him they fellowship with him and just one conversation with the serpent amen they betrayed Christ well you think will you say what there is no way well judas walked with Jesus sup with Jesus talk with Jesus he was even in the revival casting out Devils with Jesus and he still comes up and he betrays Jesus think about Lucifer who was with God for eons we don't know how long he was with God as far as counting years but we know that he was there and in that place was called eternity you must understand that even Lucifer a man betrayed God looked him right in the face the Bible says no man have seen God at any time but Lucifer Amen was a chair of he was a chair of he was a covering angel so if anybody would have had an idea of what God look like Lucifer would have seen it and I don't know how come God did what he did but he allowed Lucifer to preach for so long amen and we find out at 1/3 of an Angels even believe that lie that you can have your own way like you heard me say man this is not like some McDonald's or Burger King you can't have it your own way and you and I must understand Amen that God there's only one way and that's God's Way there is no other way that's why the Bible said amen broad is a way that lead to instruction narrow and straight is the way that leadeth to eternal life and only a few be that find it and if you have eternal life this morning you ought to thank God for it because what it was it was Lucifer Amen who came up he was the original armed rebel rebelling against God because he thought in his own heart right that he can do it a different way he he in its own art and listen God said you have said in your heart I will a sin I will do this I will do that and because of that that is iniquity right in other words and then he comes right down and it talks to Eve and he says eat God is hiding something from you right you can do it your way because God had already told them his way and in their reasoning they did it Lucifer's way that's why we have such battles with ourselves because the same hay in your flesh you are a child of the Lucifer it's evil there is no good thing in your flesh because of what happened in the original sin hallelujah that's why you battle every day and let me say it like this this is your greatest enemy it ain't the devil is you because this thing makes you do foolish things hallelujah it makes you reason and God gives the Word of God and we saw in this liberal world we think a man our reasoning is right when the Bible says in these days men will do those things that he think is right he's right in his own eyes look at America everybody is right well everybody can't be right hallelujah but I'll tell you one thing there's one person that is right and that's God hallelujah so we look at this err what does the rest of the story let's we know by God's grace what they did to it we are witnesses somebody said give me proof that Jesus Christ is resurrected I am the proof you are the proof amen those of us Amen who have who have experienced the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are approved that Jesus is no longer dead but he's alive you see listen the Bible tells us that even we are not allowed and we should never call our brothers and our sisters fools is that right hello sometimes people like foolish but that doesn't make him a fool but when you call him a fool you're literally looking at the image of God and saying you silly you're stupid that which was made in the image of God can never be silly could never be stupid fine it may because there in the image of God they have God's intelligence even in their fallen state they're the only meeting beings that have the capacity to reason and to think with logic that right in the image of God that's what I tell people I said there's no such thing if the child is normally born there's no such thing if that child not being able to learn Wow because God put intelligence their intelligence it's not built upon the muscle of your that's up here it's the spirit that's in the muscle y'all understand me so we said what do you mean brother Brooks listen you and I know that the Bible said that Jesus Christ on the day of resurrection he he led captivity captive right and he gave gifts to men well Alou you one thing he did give us and that is eternal life is that right and you and I must understand that Jesus Christ has a right now he controls everything Jesus is not a religion it's not a figment of our imagination the purpose for him dying amen and rising again today is to prove to his own creation that he's alive thousands of years even the church held him in the grave just like Lazarus born was held in the grave for four days for God in his mind had a day for Lazarus to get up hallelujah and God don't care he didn't care at that time how many days lives is laid in the grave four days dead rotten stinking hallelujah but in the midst of all of that there was a germ of life y'all better hear me this morning see because what good is it is for you to say well I'm a Christian and there is no life in you there is no resurrection power hallelujah there is no witnessing power there is no life for me and to see seeing one thing about Jesus wherever he would go he'd change the atmosphere he has such a life about him Amen that wherever he would go it would change the atmosphere and listen Jesus never preached as funeral hallelujah can you imagine if the Church of God went get to get on such a card it meant that when a brother/sister would die with prayer form and he'd come back up I don't know whether he would have proven that seeing we go close to the rapture but my point is we would know that the ability of that would be in us which it is hallelujah is this okay you see people don't understand I would say thank you to myself you know people to this day don't you understand why it had to be a virgin do y'all know what it was Amen it had to be a virgin because it was a virgin that made us fall he was a virgin and she fell amen to that sexual sin and here it took God to bring to bring life had them bypass the sexual act that's why the Bible said every man that's born of a woman is a few days in full of troubles hallelujah why because we were born unto death that a birth was never to be painful that's because of the curse and why there because that's where they took place but you and I must understand that why God Amen in order to marry you you must be a virgin what do you mean a virgin to the word hallelujah you cannot have any isms you cannot have any schism and you must be born of and by the word but how can I be born by the word brother Bruce it meant you like God toll on Nicodemus you must be born again right if everybody would read that scripture to themselves you will then get the message you must be born again right in order to get to heaven you must be born again and Jesus said that which is a flesh is a flesh and that which is up Spirit is spirit in other words you've been born into this world right you take on the world you love the realm of the things out there where a while you were born of this world but this world and that world is two different worlds and in order to get into that well you must come by the way that you came in this world you were born into this world and in order to go there you must be born there is that right because you must understand our spiritual birth is not something of the earth it's a it's of heaven hallelujah you can't be sitting in heavenly places unless you've been born in heaven we'll help me Lord so we find out that the story is told that here Joseph found marriage impregnated and he was going to put her to death right it sound like a Christmas message but I'm gonna tell you something he couldn't put her to death why because the word was there Alleluia and the angel said don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife chosen because this thing that's in her is of the Holy Ghost in other words the Holy Ghost produced that baby inside of you that means that the Holy Ghost was the father of the baby and Jesus couldn't have two fathers [Music] so he's the father's the Holy goes of the Holy Ghost is the father hallelujah so you must understand by God's grace he meant that here God stopped the man that was gonna actually kill his wife stone because she was liking until the ill-fame woman having seen a man without a husband and that purity was to stone or to be stone is that right you love the Lord so we realized by God's grace you say well what do you mean the people even in that day failed to see the supernatural move of God just like in this thing ah because it's always so simple always simple God has been preaching the route death bury and resurrection of himself for years ages he put it in the Sun right the same Sun Amen it rises in the morning same Sun gets old in the morning noon time is around strength it's a powerful man after a while I began to get old oh oh oh it even changed colors all of a sudden it dies it goes to the grave but in the morning time he come the same Sun your understanding oh my he did it with Noah he said Noah I want you to build three levels of this ship because I want you to understand this is gonna be what is gonna be a man in the future is that right that you got to come to justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Noah only one door because there's only one door into this kingdom and Jesus said I am that door hallelujah and so you must understand what he said 19 all over no because you gotta be baptized hallelujah and I ain't gonna sprinkle you I'm a flood this thing hallelujah and you must understand the bet that that that big ol Ark had to be baptized it had to die it had to baby bear it and it rose again hallelujah is that right oh that's God and if that was yesterday and he doesn't change that means it same goes for today death burial and resurrection every true Christian must have one hallelujah you've got to die to yourself not just God you got to rot what are you saying rot in what way your own wheel and your own desire and your own reasoning is that right that's what the devil Tony eats surely you're not going to die and she reasoned with it when God said the day that you eat of the street you should surely die now we're living in the last day is that right it did not the work the Word of God tells us that in the last days amen they're gonna be truth quakes and famines and all of these things happening amen in this day did anybody make me make a mistake have you ever seen so many earthquakes ever before in the history of man look at our weather people I mean it's even in higher we can see there's a changing in the weather changing in the people ah because God said we are approaching a fire baptism right so you said well what do you mean they meant in the days of north there's a water baptism when Jesus died there was a blood baptism that means sanctified he sanctified the earth amen with his own blood hallelujah but now the third stage Amen is wealth of iron baptism we can't come to a new world until the world is made new and in that fire baptism God is going to burn all the demons off of the earth out of the atmosphere there won't be no no Devils hallelujah y'all understand me you saw a white brother this is the Easter this is an Easter message oh but you got to understand that's what I'm preaching I'm preaching the death burial and resurrection everybody wants to live ah y'all glad for death I'm glad y'all say that it's so true people think that death is a horrible thing death is the grace of God can you imagine what you live look like at the rate that you're aging if he

insane North Korea got an insane one we got an insane when Russia has an insane one all along got bombs but God said it would be this is savings Eden and I don't care who you are if you don't believe the Word of God that Labor's us insane ha because God is everywhere you can see him everywhere if you look for hello somebody and you're insane if you think God is gonna have mercy on you let me tell you something this is the way God have mercy and I call him the mercy angels when God Amen wanted to have mercy in the days of Noah he sent Noah and everybody that herd know that was God's mercy they were guilty they were eating drinking and being married they would actually sinning all the time and everything guy said I'm fed up with it and he said Noah with the message of mercy and grace that right Moses was a angel mercy and grace is that come on somebody you see God has a pattern and the people that catches the pattern didn't I say the people that catch the pattern are the ones who God give the mercy to straight is the way that leads to eternal life and only a few be that find it y'all think I'm crazy they had Pharisees people Amen in Jesus day who had that doctrine of divinity and all of these degrees the Pharisees the Sadducees and everything and guess what Jesus said except you believe that he you should likewise Danielson you mean to tell me I went to school four years eight years and got my degree if I don't believe in you I started this word back and forth I know have a set of Pilsen in the scroll and tell you exactly what it means you mean to tell me see what I'm trying to get to you people is this God has a way it's a narrow way it's a straight way and everybody don't find it because everybody ain't looking for I understand me so you say I'm not gonna be long with this message but my point is here's the other story here's the other part of the story Jesus didn't just die raised from the dead there was more to him than that he took the blood amen and said in an emergency he went to his father the scripture says he ascended and you know what was so beautiful about this message when Jesus died he wasn't dying for himself he was dying for you and me is that right and when he died people of God Amen you know what he did he went to hell for you that's what that it was excites me cuz I received that so now I don't have to go to hell because he went for me I received that and the thing that I loved about it he didn't stay there hallelujah the Bible said he conquered death hell and the grave oh you and I what was he doing his children were children of light he had to raise from the dead to make sure his children would have the element of Resurrection in them that's why the Bible said in this same spirit being in you that was also in Christ Jesus at it quicken his mortal body it will also quicken your hallelujah can you imagine amen being of this age in all of a sudden in a moment of the tweet mother I I'm changed back to 21 whatever the age is I'm looking good honey I'm feeling good amen all my hair and everything else is in this proper place whatever sand did to me it's no longer there that's what I'm looking for I'm looking for a world that doesn't have sin I'm looking for a world Amen that doesn't have pain and sorrow and all these things hallelujah and I know it exists he's our brother put you out of your mind am I out of my mind anybody can see these radio waves coming through here but what about all these colors that's that's now a man flowing through this room right here can you see them I guarantee you what 200 years ago if a man would have prophesied they are coming a time they have this little box and that box would be to pick up things from all over the world you literally see the people their faces in their actions and everything else to do it they lock him up but all that little box we call it the TV we call it whatever the laptop that little box is a witness that there is another dimension that you cannot see with your own eye but it exists let me tell you something people there is another dimension we call it heaven Oh somebody help me get exist right now you can't hear the radio sounds but everybody that has a radio and hands it on can hear it ah because scientists develop a little little crystal or something that could catch it and bring it to you what is it it's an instrument that can go beyond another dimension and pick it up and give it to you I heard the voice of Jesus say come on to me all ye that labor and heavy laden that's voice is still in the atmosphere remember on New Year's Eve mint has a lot of loud that heavenly choir to come down and sing with us over 12 people in here hearted and healthy experience I'm hearing a quad from heaven hallelujah what was that choir witnessing to us they said that there is another dimension and God gave us grace just a huge yeah that wasn't my first time hearing that that was my second time here in their hallelujah or third time on the youtubes hallelujah nothing wrong they need to go alright so don't think being and enjoying the word so you look at this thing you say all brother Brooks what are you saying I'm trying to tell us and then they you and I must understand Amen that there is coming a rap child aren't you happy I mean so yeah I don't know I thought man when everybody came in here said I thought well maybe they must be sad it didn't happen today it'll be one early Easter time like this is the earliest I've seen it oh you say what do you mean I'm just saying that something could have happened this morning we don't know but down the road we'll see Oh help us Jesus is this okay you and I must understand we got a Good Shepherd because of Christ and he calls us sheep and because of this amen we know we can hear his voice y'all heard me everybody can hear his eyes like I said the other day that voice will find you right Adam where are you that voice and Men was not walking in the cool of the evening I'm telling you something here because we are looking to hear what a voice and that voice would say come up hither don't you hear me everybody won't but those who are the true sheep of God we're here the VARs when he said come up here and we will come hallelujah Nazareth didn't have a choice when Jesus and laugh come forth he came forth hey man why because the voice God's voice amen requires obedience obedience from work everything God can speak to the rain in the rain have to stop hallelujah God a speak to a rock and the rock must cry out hallelujah God can speak to a Dada man and he's got to come back alive hallelu don't you know that when God had a revelation he meant in the Old Testament when they raised up from the dead they had been people who've been dead for thousand years but when God called they had to come back together hallelujah I trusted him that's all I have hallelujah own crisis solid rock I stand and all on the ground is sinking say what are you saying then God in his last day said if it was possible this age would fool the very elected hallelujah but you see God couldn't just leave it like that he had to send us a word a word so that that word will would we would embrace it and because we embrace this message it's the only reason why we can't be to see God's grace and mercy sit melikhaya for oh come on Sally Polly knew God's grace and mercy and he came with a message now if you are deceived Amen it's only because you didn't take in account he meant that the message is the voice of God and if Adam brought that voice the word and sin and death came in the same thing to us is that right coming from the message Good Shepherd he said we must why must the Shepherd's be on duty at all time oh you mean to tell me my guard is on duty all time looking after who me everybody was supposed to save me anything he must be sure that none of his sheep is lost aren't you glad of that if the Shepherd loses one sheep is it brings a reproach on the shepherd that's what Jesus said I will never will lose one there'll never be a reproach and just like brother Branham said he said God didn't save you to lose you Oh Lord I don't know what's wrong with y'all y'all must have stayed up too late last night or something all I know is I'm I got to be kind of late too but I'm happy I'm feel you know why because I'm cleaning I'm clean sanctified come on God did that not me God did it I can remember a time I I couldn't set up in church it made me feel really good cuz of the bad things I used to do it's just a rape listen he that hears my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall never come to the judgement they all know what that is you don't come to the judgment because of this day we're celebrating hallelujah and don't you know you can't get to heaven unless you got the Holy Ghost ah because if God gives you the Holy Ghost not only is that your garment but that's his acceptance and we are accepted in that what beloved because of this day thank God the Roman says hey put some stones in front of that grave lock him up shut him down don't you let that man come out of the end don't you let nobody go by there and steal his body hallelujah but all when that opponent time King the earth shook the stone rolled away and guess what came about Jesus himself hallelujah it was so terrible the Roman soldiers Flay wonder why didn't examine it hallelujah but you see what I'm saying whenever the Holy Ghost is present there is power y'all understand me so you say well Brotherhood's Oh what are you saying that stone was rolled away hallelujah supernaturally rolled away and the body of Jesus stood up and walk out so much so he was so beautiful amen the sisters that were there thought he was a gardener no more scars no more he was beaten to a pulp amen because of you and me do you ever think about it think about this then that every time you do wrong and then Jesus is standing there watching you every time why because you can't see him don't mean he ain't there it's just like the television waving in radio ways you can't see him but there that that's how Jesus is every time you're out there sitting doing what you shouldn't be doing you think you people and hallelujah but you can't have from God shame on us amen when we willfully go out do things that we ought not to do seeing that the price that Jesus pray pain amen amen week we became paint look mercy on us you say I know it yeah cuz you know my mom was Holy Ghost field sometimes she saw me doing things I shouldn't do and she wasn't even been and she said jr. you know God don't like that me and my me and my me and my sinful self I lied to my mama not knowing I was lying to God I said mama you know I wouldn't do nothing like that CD now you with me cuz got it that showed I had done wrong y'all understanding you came God knows you're very intim intervening he knows your thoughts right now hallelujah it's the truth it's the truth people sit up in church playing tag spiritual tag God knows it he sees it hallelujah hallelujah listen you so all Brotherhood's what are you trying to say I'm saying you and I because of Christ and what he did on a day like this he rose up to guarantee you that you and I would ride is that that okay oh you said what do you mean but listen everybody's not going to believe this day they didn't then and they don't now no matter what you can't get some people to believe you see why brother books because everybody are not capable of believing there's some people who just don't have faith and this this gospel was written for those who have faith those people they man saw Jesus and that's what they do today they see you live in a Christian life and walking as close to God as you possibly can oh that ain't necessary and you think you better than I am of course God thinks it do he said what do you mean I have been born-again that there was a time you and I was in the same pod but now that I have been born again I'm a different man I came from heaven hallelujah I didn't know about it but you see when God took that led that book nobody was worthy don't you understand when the lab took the book he was opening this whole thing this whole book is open now now you are baptized with the Holy Ghost you can understand this book hallelujah like they said a man the New Testament is the revelation of the all testament and the message of the hours of revelation of the new testament and you and i must understand that ain't no three books is only one but the revelation of it is that we were with God before the foundation of the world tell me how would you have ever known that you don't hear no other preacher preaching that most of the people Amen because they are serpents will preach against predestination because they don't want to be discovered they hide the truth in unrighteousness hallelujah hey man you're not here nobody said where you're gene seed of God wow did you hear that in you're not gonna hear that in denomination ah the book but the book is all bad and the book is our inheritance ever want this to happen but it opened up to us and then who we really are where we came from and where we're going that's why I said you totally justified you were tricked into it you didn't mean to do it hallelujah and God made sure it could never come back to you by shedding his blood hallelujah don't you understand the importance of Revelation when that revelation is released to you and you really believe it it'll make you live right who you love the Lord well a scripture I told you I'm gonna be you know but as Luke 24 45 it says did open he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and does it you who Christ has suffered arise from the day that their day and that repentance of remission and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem we look at this and we say Oh Lord you see there are many people reading the message or not understanding the message there are so many with their knowledge when it comes to knowledge they can outshine me probably a million to one but it ain't that so you could be ignorant and have the Holy Ghost it doesn't take intelligence to receive God it takes faith I'm not ashamed to be in my light wherever God has placed me that's where I want to be my point is thing that I want to do most of all it's live it that's what I ask God every day I said God gave me grace to live it because without life you just fooling yourself see because the anointing of this day is to bring you into perfection hmm the anointing of this day like I would tell us about I say you know what that's the beauty of marriage but they changing it so much I remember the time when they made those vows and he said will you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband we used to say I will but they don't say I will anymore they say I do you do what we see we like when you say I will it is something different about that it's a continuation and and you and I must understand amen that's what God said when you marry him you must say I will and my will is your will right that's what was so powerful I can't help but say cuz Lucifer started with his will and Jesus Christ stopped his will not my will but that will be time we don't want to get married don't you know she's saying and and sisters I really believe in the veil I know a lot of people don't some people are just doing away with it but that bill means a lot to me because when you cover your head amen you're saying I'm losing my will it's no longer my will anymore you my head right it's oh you died into your will you're dying to what you figure and like I said you know you might be just as you might be smarter than your husband if I have many of them I can say that your husband might not admit it but it's the truth some women are smarter than me some woman has already figured it out before the man get to it oh come on man y'all notice the truth and if they spiritual hello you said in Scripture yes it is God say Sarah say Lord talk to Abraham let you know what he's doing is wrong it ain't working all right what up what about Abigail Abigail said his name is food yeah so don't downplay the woman you know what I mean my point is you the bride you in the image of a woman right and Jesus doesn't he don't downplay you laughter he gives you his mind and that's how it is a wife and the husband supposed to come together so well do they have the same mind you know how many times is it we haven't had that happen a long time but many time with me and my wife were thinking the same thing and when in their times we we've spoken it the same way at the same time what is it one mind and when God praises you with him this whole mission this whole thing is to do what to show the devil that the thing he wanted at the beginning in Ezekiel and Isaiah he had he can get it I'm always no no no you kill never worship my children will never worship you is that right Oh Joel Joel was an example my children will never willfully worship you Daniel no I will never worship the image see we got one God and he's the only one we worship and God amen reproducing himself in this age is that right you're the children of God reproduction reproduction of the Lord Jesus and now we must act and do just like he that's what the resurrection is all about to be dealt the beat the devil up in his own Eden you know the Lord I just I saved by the grace of God people that does not be foolish man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God then sings my soul my Savior God to thee How Great Thou How Great Thou art then sings my soul my Savior
