all greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus and I also appreciate the hospitality of Pastor Brooks whom I met for the first time a couple months ago while I was here for a couple of days we met at brother Eugene kabamba and just the first time I met him I felt like it was already working and I told the kids that they did not make a mistake by choosing him as a pastor and I felt that the spirit was good and he already sent me an invitation and next time I come here that I speak for for for his church and I'm honored to do it this morning and I want to greet all the people of God and I also appreciate Pastor John may God reach BL bless you all abundantly so we don't maybe we don't have an exceptional thing but in the message there is no new thing it is said that when it's new that means it's false because everything that was that is has already been before everything has already been said in this end time and I want to greet the ones who are listening to us from internet my name is I'm the pastor of goshan Tabernacle in kinasa and inim as the pastor [Applause] said I was the pastor of brother and I was also the pastor of some of us who are here now they're under Pastor Brooks and we we appreciate him so much amen amen without further ado today we're going to talk about the four request of Joseph to the butler are we all together so for this we're going to turn our Bible in the Book of Genesis chapter 40 the four requests of Joseph to the butler we're going to read it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ 40 Genesis 4 Genesis 40 vers verse 5 to 15 and they dream to dream both of them each man his dream in one night each man according to the interpretation of his the Butler and the baker of the king of Egypt which were Bound in the prison and Joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon them and behold they were sad and he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the in the W of his Lord's House saying wherefore look he so sadly today and they said unto him we have dreamed a dream and there is no interpreter of it and Joseph said unto them do not interpretations belong to God tell me them I pray you so it's to God to explain the dream but it's it was being told to so there was a relationship between God and Joseph and the chief Butler told his dream to Joseph and said to him in my dream Behold a Vine was before me and the vine were there three branches and it was as though it bded and her Blossom shot forth and the pharaoh's cup was in my hand and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cop and I give the cop into Pharaoh's hands and Joseph said unto him this is the interpretation of it the three branches are three days yet within three days sh shall Pharaoh lift up that head and restore thee unto that place and thou sh deliver Pharaoh's cop into his hand after the former manner when that was his Butler so this is our four request starts right here in verse the first request is but because you live prison he says but think on me when it shall be well with thee that was the first request of Joseph to the think on me when it shall be well with thee and the second and and and kindness the third request and make mention of me unto pharaoh and the fourth request and bring me out of this out of this house for indeed I was stolen away from the land of the and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dung dungeon I thank I thank the Lord break the bread of life put me aside and take the take the god and speak to your people Lord amen in amen you may regain your seat in all the Old Testament we know that Joseph is the most complete type of Jesus Christ so talking about Joseph I'm talking about Jesus Christ now we're going to see in the four request of Joseph that he was addressing to the [Music] butler we can see the same for request that Jesus addressed to the Disciples of today so as I'm talking about Joseph I'm referring to Jesus Christ when I'm talking about the butler I'm talking about you and I'm talking about me amen amen J let's examine the first request of Joseph he tells the the butler remember about me when you will be happy after the dream was was interpreted the Butler had to get out of prison he had to to get his rest and Joseph told him when you will be happy when you will be in your Prosperity remember about me we together remember about me because very so often when we are in prisoned when we are in difficulties when we are jobless or when you're sick we look for we seek for Christ we come to church all the time we have time for prayer amen amen but when we are in prosperity once we have we receive what we're requested from God very often times we forget about God and so if God tells you this morning when you will be in your prosperity when you will be happy remember me amen amen when God will bless you remember about him remember him amen it's the very truth in our story this morning when the butler left the prison never remembered about Joseph just like many Christians do today they are in their prosperities once they have received what they were looking for from God they forget God amen Amen brother Bram says in the scripture on the wall handwriting on the wall he says [Music] thus notice some habits of of people of a man when he feels insecurity I'm
