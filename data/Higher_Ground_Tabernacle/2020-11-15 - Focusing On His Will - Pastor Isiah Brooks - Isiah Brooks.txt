hallelujah this is where i am this morning she loves the streets of my town you can have this whole world of what forgive me jesus that that was just you my highest ambition really the only ambition the son of bishop to see jesus christ glorified that son of bishops because of the testimony that god has given me throughout the years i tried my best to be his humble servant poetry and if i had a million years this is available i had that much life left to live evil i want to live every minute for him you understand me amen and if i knew yes i'll be turned down at the end it's such a privilege to live for him say thank god he is so real and so good and i have never found nothing when we're alone come to some side anybody can agree with me that that's good there's nothing like jesus yeah yeah yeah come jesus when you got him all to yourself don't you lie no don't go hallelujah he or not that's right there's no sweeter communion it's greater than the love for anything your wife amen amen i wish these words were just my own spirit he we're going to come from the scripture reading the law of vienna bible saintly luke 22 luke [Music] vendor we have began reading at the 39th verse and we'll read down to the 40th sixth verses and he came out and went as he went as he was walked to the mount of olive and the disciples also followed him and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation and he was withdrawn from them about a stone cast and kneeled down and prayed for me saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done the more i said cooper's and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him and being in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweet and sweet excuse me was as it was were great drops of blood falling down to the ground and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow fatigue one more scripture john the fifth chapter john we'll read the thirtieth verse today and it reads i can of my own self do nothing as i hear i judge jesus and my judgment is just emojis because i seek not my own will on the fence in the shell spa affairs river but the will of the father which have sent me. i will entitle this message on this morning focusing on his will uh focusing on his will let us pray father god we thank you for your grace and your mercy and your grace we pray this morning that you would have your preeminence those who are listening by way of the air yeah we pray that lord that you would touch their hearts you would open their understanding could you follow antonio to the word today they may see the times we're living in they could widely talk that they may draw closer to you we ask these things in jesus christ and i read the scripture this morning normally we read this passage of scripture coming from luke during the time of the season but this particular scene that jesus christ in the garden of gethsemane always meant so much to me because jesus christ himself jesus christ went to calvary as a man even though he was the son of god memphis feasted you even though he was god because the bible says in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily basketball only playing the truth he was a man he wanted the perfect will of god we are given as living sacrifices and being that we are the temple of god it don't only dump it we are the place in which god resides and especially of a deliberate action especially of a deliberate action amen amen the mind is that right it's what we call uh when we come to christ this or even before we come to christ we have a free will hallelujah hallelujah and god will never take that will away from you the will is something that you must surrender to god hallelujah amen as the brother said willingly amen when we think about god's will is that when we was created in god's will he was literally in control of everything he was in control of the animals he was in control of the the the atmosphere he was control in control of eden itself amen because it was lucifer or satan in the form of the serpent that taught eve reasoning reasoning is contrary a revelation from god you've been on the jew every man and woman they don't have faith but faith in itself is a gift from god now i'm going to tie what i did preach the other day i was working with the golden candlesticks the uh chandelier we talked about the golden candle stick knows we usually put s on it but it's not a plural famous in the primo yeah because if you read zechariah he referred to this golden candle stick he is that it was the uh uh way of entrance into the holy sentence this is important this is important because we find out that in the in the book of revelation it was jesus christ who stood in the midst of the states hallelujah hallelujah and whenever you see the number seven represents god hallelujah hallelujah seven angels sit down seven thunders sit down seven seals six so seven days since you hallelujah hallelujah whenever you see the number seven it represents god yeah the number six i represent you it is amazing see uh uh that this particular stick okay oh it's in the midst of the six three on this side and three on that side y'all understand me let's cool so we're not of course this is not a perfect thing this is not a perfect replica but i'm doing the best that i could be about but we said on the other day this particular candlestick okay was it made out of one piece of gold so they fit the the the different law and all of the uh uh uh uh uh utensils are the pieces that were in the holy place it was made out of that one piece of gold the because the bible says in the beginning was the word and the world was with god and the word was god did you so the bible tells us that everything that was made was made by jesus christ [Music] so if god made adam he is what made him deity is that right this is why you see throughout hollywood everybody want to be a superman or a super woman everybody wants supernatural powers because there's something that's laying in the conscious of mankind that he is a fallen man and he's not to be just a natural man but god created man supernaturally hallelujah there is a supernatural part of man that needs to be awakened and the only person person that can awaken that is god but some of the letters the law but are able ministers of the spirit let me to sell this that the spirit takes the letter it is manifest it in the manifesto hallelujah as i said in one of the services before congratulations jesus christ says i am the bread of life jesus christ he also says i am that manner i am that bread [Applause] and the word and they still don't know what it is and wrote this bible uh by the inspiration of god let's be honest so this is not just man lettering on pages but this bible is the word of god be blessed like i said it comes it is also the bread say oh see but when the bread of god was brought in by the levite and it took the shekinah glory to make it right it took god to bring the fullness of the bread to life hallelujah oh glory [Music] to give us a revelation of what the bread is saying is that right that's because you can't understand this bible without the holy spirit this week we can't thousands of years have passed and we've got a we've got a bookstores all over the world trying to explain this bible explicit and they still don't know what it is y'all understand what i'm trying to say because the word is god hallelujah hallelujah now but it takes the holy spirit said it's a part of sentence we to unfold the word of god to us remember israel experience this it's all experimental when there was no prophet in the land everybody perfected right there they had the scrolls they gave it to the intellectuals and told i couldn't i cannot give me this hallelujah why because the book is shut like the book is closed without the anointing of god and when there is no prophet in the land except the father i'm sorry the word of the lord will will not be revealed except he reveals it to his servant the prophet said revelation comes by way of a prophet because the bible says that no man has his own interpretation all you must do is believe what it's saying what i'm saying hallelujah hallelujah it's it's like when moses was given the scrolls no man could add or take away from it now we understand that the spirit it takes the spirit the component is free to bring it to pass that's going to spread that man for an example uh an example from an example i just said uh conceived maybe he made a mistake in this place he said but there was no way that he could make a mistake because it was not isaiah who prophesied hallelujah is that bible the bible said the spirit of prophecy is jesus christ so it was jesus christ in isaiah prophesying the word a virgin shall conceive y'all hear what i'm saying this is important since it's important because you and i know i'm going to go back to this the candlestick was right in the holy place they did not understand but it was more to the candlesticks it was just a type of christ is that right that's the bible because jesus christ is the only one who can give you light zachariah what is it that you see guess what zechariah knew about the candlesticks uh god was now getting ready to enlighten him it was something that christ was going to do through the ages christian hallelujah it meant more than just giving light for the priests at that time hallelujah but it was giving light to every church age it is being in human flesh oh my god this candlestick represented the humanity of god we need the light [Music] in order to make the next step you need oh my god in order to go beyond the veil because no unclean thing will enter behind the veil y'all is it a song represent the prayers of the saints of the son hallelujah hallelujah oh come on somebody remember let's go back i'm dealing with the perfection of mantis right now into the image of jesus christ who is the son of god y'all understand this if we are brethren in which jesus christ calls us brethren that means we came from the same mama and the same daddy hallelujah and that's the only person we know like that hallelujah it's this has been the mystery of god throughout all the ages oh well i'm a christian and you're just living your life any kind of way no sir no no ma'am no let me finish up this quote i'm sorry see the word of god the way moses brought it that was just law you had to go look at it thou shall not commit adultery thou shalt not steal it thou shalt not lie to your name thou shall not do this uh that comes upon the promised word for hallelujah why because god knows them that are hidden hallelujah and you know this is one of my favorite scriptures he that begun the good work in you is faithful to completed hallelujah see right this this once the spirit gets comes on you god it's with you brings is that right that's what john said she says if you're truly baptized of the holy ghost you'll be baptized with the holy ghost and fight so when you put all these licks of fire together it should be more fire in here than the [Music] i want you to be free i want you to come out of this routine religion hallelujah god is not into routineness in freedom and where the [Music] that he inhabits the praise of his people hallelujah i don't care what you're going through you have to come here with a praise on your lips hallelujah listen the pride of jesus christ she does not sing the blues hallelujah she doesn't come in here amen sounded like some sad notes but she's those happy notes on the piano hallelujah she brings joy with her why because she with thanksgiving [Music] that ain't god hallelujah that is the devil working on your mind why because the bible says in his presence where's the fullness of joshua that this uh uh word okay anointed bring forth a manifestation of manifestation not just not just two tables of stones hallelujah but the presence of the living god did you know that that's complete israel got confused israelite confused they thought that the anointing of god only uh was for the ark of the covenant they thought that's where god is to show up in other words they made a a religion is an unfair religion and so when the ark of the covenant was taken from them that was like god being taken from them and they failed to see that's not really where god wanted to dwell since the part would you believe it might be dead the covenant was just a replica somewhere else where god wanted to dwell [Music] and you're not uh circumcised hallelujah it will bring death to you hallelujah but remember when when when when uh david saw the ark of the covenant returning [Applause] [Music] he became a holy roller holy roller according to saul's daughter he was out of the church order i wish some of y'all would get out of church order i'd love to see this church get out of the church hallelujah i'd love to see you praise god and worship god like you feel it hallelujah y'all remember every child should know this it don't matter where where you where you came from yeah it's uh maybe it's just me maybe it's just me but i love rain medium i love the rain especially summer rain and spring rain and and when it would rain i would get happy i stand on the porch my mom would always read my mind it was something about the way the rain falls i was it was wonderful but that's the way it is when the rain falls in the church you're supposed to get in it soaking wet enjoy it hallelujah [Applause] and that is the way the rain is supposed to fall in the sun hallelujah hallelujah but when the rain is not falling they're kind of pretty dumb things get dried off the show's so so dried up and still starchy yeah he said if you have uh uh do you that's what has happened to a lot of churches they have been in such [Music] hallelujah let's go on the lord knowing his will for our day we must understand we must know his will hallelujah hallelujah let's just say the way brother adam said it come on come so that adam and eve could not get to the tree of life an angel with swords so that he could keep them out of the way they said why because if adam and eve had gotten to the tree of life he would have been sinners forever we would have lived in that condition forever we needed someone that could come here hallelujah he's the only one that i know that can change the situation he can change a sinner to a saint bishop hallelujah he can take a murderer and sanctify him that right he's the only one mind over matter doesn't do it mind over matter can't do it no psychology psychology [Music] that he is lord to the glory of god hallelujah that's why we pray in the name of jesus amen we love in the name of jesus we baptize in the name of jesus christ hallelujah and you'll be saved only in the name of jesus christ remember it was god's will to create man in his in his image that's why in saint john the first chapter and john when jesus came conscious the bible tells us that he was the real man what a real son and daughter of god was supposed to be sacred until jesus christ is that right that's what john says they said he was the light of me in other words he was the revelation of what a man supposed to be is that right because when god made jesus he didn't use joseph's blood and he didn't use mary's blood hallelujah the bible said it was god's own blood he was not contaminated so when we saw jesus we really saw the way a man supposed to be is that right he was a supernatural man he turned water into wise come on somebody you see and we seen jesus again and when i say this because we saw the son of man in our day feeling he when the bible said he will appear to those that come to those who love his appearance so he has to appear first in other words hebrews 13 must be a scripture made manifest before the people eyes in order for them to see jesus christ again hallelujah and that's what he did even though he was clothed in a prophet hallelujah it wasn't the prophet it was christ jesus manifesting himself again remember in the appearance of the son of man y'all hear what i'm saying and we saw that appearing and if we could see that appearing you will see his coming [Music] i was looking at a little christian thing last night and it was it was really interesting because it dealt with the rapture and the way the world think is going to happen baby is disappearing in your face this year there's a lot of pretenders but they don't realize that the rapture is a process hallelujah enoch walked with god and was found not and enoch and the bible tells us [Music] in you can't just walk in the pentecostal life because that light is gone hallelujah you know where we are we're beyond the seventh day where [Music] that's the way it's supposed to be who really is when she covered her head with the veil that means she was surrendering her will and then isaac took her rebecca into his mother's tent which represented the old time time religion hallelujah amen not some of these new fandangos that's going on in america hallelujah a good rich quick scheme hallelujah but the old time religion you must be born again you must be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sin the old-time way hallelujah you must receive the holy ghost and then with [Music] [Music] until [Music] at least that's the way it's supposed to be nowadays they got it midnight there's so where people don't have to wear veils and all that kind of stuff that's just too old but you see that's like taking the candelabra out of the out of the holy amen that's what the devil preached to eve that day girl you know you could be liberal you know you don't have to be under his head hallelujah i'll tell you what god's trying to hide something from him we need this mercy seat uh uh hallelujah and remember i told you that mercy seat was jesus christ hey sit down you mean the candle library was the mercy seat is everything is jesus dude hallelujah i showed you the other day that moses and elijah okay was actually the fulfillment of the ministry of jesus christ you've been established they were in like shadow and time he said they come uh we're talking about we're talking about revelation uh resurrection now we're talking about a quickly we're talking about bringing the body of christ into hallelujah but you must come to do his will god don't want no rebellious woman from uh god ain't looking for a rebel hallelujah god ain't going to allow you to take hardship from him where he leads me i will follow that's it hallelujah he's the shepherd and we're the sheep hallelujah you're going to let him tell you what to do oh yes ma'am i'm going to let him tell me what to do hallelujah hallelujah yes sister amen listen listen husbands love your wives amen for fun as christ love the church come christian please and never has god my lord made me a slave mo mo if i am a slave you're not fussing and fighting and carrying on him all that kind of stuff but you do things good willfully somebody pulled me off my subject but nevertheless man god is so good you know what is the balance the balancer of this bible they said we call it l-o-v-e the balance they said people appear to bring every scripture to life hallelujah hallelujah now we come to a place we're talking about the mercy seat and we're not going to go on too far with that because in order to to understand what god wants us to see secret you have working with remember it is christ was a christian who who does the choosing all of us could we would not even you know the gentiles was way only out of court it did work there was no place for us but because jesus christ oh yeah we had to come that way because that was the original way he set up what it did for the jews it never was supposed to be law it was supposed to be love it was supposed to be grace because love is the first message is that right oh yeah it was overlaid with gold and that that represented jesus christ's deity but it has all the wood underneath the gold which represented the humanity of jesus he had to get away from the crowd as a human man he hung god he developed hallelujah but that same human man was full of god hallelujah he was the same one that turned water into wine y'all hear what [Music] it was god making himself flesh see that jesus hallelujah now the flesh is coming the word god in you the hope of glory there is a super race [Music] you keep moving on higher is that right that's what he told us he said i go to the prayer but i go to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also hallelujah so you understand by god's grace let me just let me come to this uh one of the things that this agent always keep us in bondage with let me read something here let's go and we and if we have confessed our sins it seems confusing they are blotted out is so if i say hallelujah hallelujah is that all right he said if we can we have confessed our sins jesus they are blotted out of the book of memory islam if i said now you can't do anything to me you can do anything to me and i'll forgive but god can forgive and forget it when it's not even remembered anymore because any memphis nothing can do it but god put a film in you nothing but god can do that oh yeah yeah he says because we only got these little finite senses but he's infinite he's infinite god he can absolutely forget it that it ever was done hallelujah now i that's the kind of god i want to serve john the jew hallelujah hallelujah so let me say another thing to help you and i'm not bringing you to a place there's a main point where you feel like you can sin and do whatever you want to do because the bible says god forbid shall we continue in sin that grace may abound [Music] book of life [Music] hallelujah those whose names are written in the lamb's book of life you're the only one who can go behind the veil where god has made you priests and kings now would you sacrifice i told you about that woman caught in adultery parliament caught an adulterer by by the word the law the law brought them and they don't flag on these i said sometimes the devils can bring you to jesus christ sometimes devils bring you to jesus you have a rough time out in the world you say oh i got to make jesus my choice hallelujah but they brought jesus caught in adultery they brought excuse me about the woman called an adulterer to jesus jesus went down starting from the elder uh jesus isn't that amazing dude he started from the the the elders and it comes came down to the youngest i don't know how he should he knew how to do it is there going to be anybody with sin it's going to be the man who has the the greater of age what was the lord uh this is this is the kind of thing we're dealing with right now hallelujah yeah right now the the the with

is that isaiah isaiah says no no nothing can hold you in judgment somebody help me maybe i'm i maybe it's just me i'm feeling real good today nothing oh yeah and then paul goes on to say who shall lay in the charge to god's elect but see the judgment journey just didn't start stopping jesus jesus transferred the judgment to the woman called an adult jesus hallelujah he made her a part of the judgment the judging and he says woman when i defund where are you accuse us and she looked around yeah she says i have none this little group and all groups like this one will be in in a place of judgment you the lunatics the lunatics crazies oh exactly you're the ones that makes no sense was that the jockey name i guarantee you measure no matter what they come to report to bring a judgment on you you must remember that your sins have been forgiven and you stand justified as though you've never sinned in the first place you don't care what the judge say you don't care what the president say
