[38:32] we're going to ask that you stand with
[38:34] us
[38:38] to the book of joshua
[38:41] we're going to read and leave our jews
[38:44] from joshua the 10th chapter
[38:50] i really appreciate our brother charles
[38:53] coming up and helping us out
[38:58] actually i i must must not have gotten a
[39:00] note
[39:03] that he was going to be here
[39:06] and i came to church this morning
[39:10] thinking that i wasn't going to have an
[39:11] interpreter
[39:14] so i appreciate the lord and these
[39:15] brothers for working with me
[39:19] the way they do well
[39:23] i know there have been times the
[39:24] brothers have gone down there to help
[39:26] them
[39:29] and i like it that way i like it when
[39:31] the church works together
[39:34] joshua the
[39:36] 10th chapter
[39:37] jesus
[39:45] and we're going to read uh starting from
[39:46] the 13th verse
[39:52] 13th and 14th verse of that chapter
[40:03] and then from there we'll go to romans
[40:04] the eighth chapter
[40:07] of it
[40:13] you're there
[40:16] and the sun stood still
[40:19] and the moon stayed
[40:26] until the people had avenged themselves
[40:29] upon their enemies
[40:36] it's not this written in the book of
[40:38] joshua
[40:42] so the son stood still in the midst of
[40:44] heaven
[40:46] and haste
[40:47] uh not to go down about a whole day
[40:50] elisa
[40:56] and there was no day
[40:58] like that before it or after it that the
[41:02] lord hearken
[41:04] unto the voice of a man for the lord
[41:07] fought for israel
[41:18] romans the eighth chapter beginning at
[41:20] the first verse
[41:42] there is therefore now no condemnation
[41:44] to them which are in christ jesus
[41:48] who walk not after the flesh
[41:51] but after the spirit
[41:59] for the law of the spirit of life in
[42:02] christ jesus have made me free
[42:05] from the law of sin and death
[42:14] for what the law could not do
[42:16] in that it was weak through the flesh
[42:19] god sending his own son in the likeness
[42:22] of sinful flesh
[42:24] and for sin condemned sin in the flesh
[42:43] that the righteousness of the law might
[42:45] be fulfilled
[42:47] in us
[42:48] who walk not after the flesh
[42:51] but after the spirit
[42:56] exists
[43:10] we thank you for your mercy we shall
[43:11] thank you for being so good to us
[43:14] lord you have been better to us
[43:17] and we've been to ourselves
[43:20] we are so blessed today
[43:22] to be able to hear your words
[43:36] everybody who's in bondage
[43:38] in one way
[43:49] [Music]
[44:05] amen amen you may be seated
[44:10] i like to entitle this message
[44:14] the atmosphere of joshua the atmosphere
[44:17] of jerusalem you know the name joshua
[44:20] jose is
[44:23] and so joshua amen we know who he is
[44:27] he was the appointed leader by god
[44:33] after the death of moses
[44:49] we have obtained
[44:52] a message a message
[44:54] that's beyond
[44:56] uh comprehension
[44:58] do not accomplish
[45:00] you can't reason with it
[45:13] [Music]
[45:17] he shall bring it to pass
[45:19] you see it's not us working it out
[45:22] it's actually jesus christ
[45:26] but we must understand
[45:29] the importance of the
[45:30] spirit the importance of the importance
[45:32] of the anointing
[45:36] and as we said on wednesday
[45:39] we have had years of teachings
[45:58] word
[46:01] many people misunderstood
[46:05] that the word is not
[46:07] something that's on pages
[46:23] and so when in all of our teachings
[46:54] joshua was christ josue every great
[46:57] leader in the bible
[47:01] it was christ in more faith
[47:04] anointing men
[47:06] to do his will christie
[47:23] that we must understand that
[47:25] when one received the holy ghost
[47:30] one becomes free
[47:34] from the law of sin and death
[47:50] is satan can so easily
[47:55] bring us into a condemnation state
[48:00] but the bible says
[48:02] he whom the son is set free
[48:22] hello
[48:23] this message the message has come to us
[48:27] for us
[48:28] to fall in love with
[48:31] jesus christ
[49:00] galatians 5. let's sink
[49:04] we're going to read 14 through 18. only
[49:06] uh
[49:09] for all the law is fulfilled in one word
[49:27] but how many of us have a revelation of
[49:30] that
[49:31] and how many of us can actually say we
[49:33] are doing that
[49:36] more so say it like this we are living
[49:38] that
[49:41] but if you
[49:42] bite
[49:44] the 15th verse
[49:47] but if you bite and devour one another
[49:52] take heed when it goes
[49:55] consume
[49:56] one of
[50:10] one another you see at the moment
[50:12] the same spirit
[50:14] that causes you to do that
[50:17] it will also cause you to be consumed
[50:22] hallelujah
[50:24] then i say then
[50:26] walk in the spirit
[50:28] he's only giving you the solution
[50:32] to your problem about the problem
[50:35] yes sir
[50:36] because there is no way
[50:47] and you shall not what fulfill the lust
[50:51] of the flesh
[51:04] and you just feel like you gotta say
[51:06] something back if
[51:30] that is not of god in a pardon
[51:35] the bible says
[51:37] when jesus christ was suffering
[51:41] he was like a sheep or a lamb
[51:44] and i knew he would not open his mouth
[51:59] you know our children
[52:01] know some fun when they get sassy
[52:04] when they talk back
[52:07] what as a parent what is your response
[52:12] you want to immediately fully
[52:14] immediately correct that child
[52:30] hallelujah
[53:09] if you can't respect your father who is
[53:11] god
[53:22] you're not going to obey nobody
[53:26] else that's not even in my notes but
[53:29] it's true
[53:32] walk in the spirit that only spray
[53:34] he said what do you mean brother what is
[53:36] it
[53:37] it's just like it's just like uh you
[53:39] know when when uh
[53:42] i
[53:43] lost my thought
[53:45] but when you're persecuted
[53:48] the bible said revile not
[53:51] in other words don't don't don't
[53:53] come back at the person in a fight
[53:59] now we say oh we got the holy ghost
[54:02] i've only sent this question but the
[54:03] bible tells me
[54:05] that when stephen
[54:07] was being stopped
[54:22] uh
[54:26] [Music]
[55:02] god said bless your enemies
[55:18] i'm trying to tell you how much holy
[55:20] ghost you got
[55:21] said
[55:22] you sent this proof of it
[55:24] you love the lord
[55:25] that's all i'm saying
[55:28] the bible said for the flesh
[55:30] 17th verse
[55:44] so that you cannot do the things that ye
[55:46] would
[56:00] but how
[56:10] [Music]
[56:15] person
[56:18] watch that
[56:19] observation because the next thing is
[56:20] that that gate is going to open
[56:24] when that comes you got to rebuke it
[56:28] satan that you're a liar
[56:30] satan you're a liar
[56:33] the bible said bless and curse not
[56:37] have mercy upon that person
[56:57] thing that james talk about
[57:01] that little thing that sticks his head
[57:02] out like a snake
[57:07] you understand me
[57:09] now i'm gonna go ahead on in just a
[57:10] minute but i i want to lay this down
[57:13] because you and i must know there's a
[57:15] difference between walking in the flesh
[57:17] and walking in the spirit
[57:23] you can't
[58:02] sometimes my grandson he just get a
[58:03] little frustrated
[58:06] and
[58:22] as far as i'm concerned
[58:24] because it is a spirit that's gonna say
[58:26] any spring a rebellion rebellion
[58:29] a spirit of disobedience saying spirit
[58:31] like this will be something you know the
[58:32] bible says don't even look at somebody
[58:34] like you hate him
[58:42] i'm gonna get been guilty of that
[58:43] combination come on this i'll be
[58:46] real you you know you do so
[59:14] there is no way you can make heaven
[59:28] how easy it is
[59:34] that right
[59:35] brother brother said we we we were we
[59:37] were we were born failures
[59:42] then what's going to make us
[59:44] victorious hallelujah
[59:47] what's going to make us rapture ready
[59:49] just give unfair
[59:52] long live the holy ghost
[59:54] but let me put it this way
[59:56] there are many people with the holy
[59:58] ghost
[1:00:09] to make a rapture
[1:00:14] how many people committed brother
[1:00:16] branham said
[1:00:18] had the holy ghost
[1:00:21] and they stayed in the system so he said
[1:00:23] only system instead of following the
[1:00:25] word for their day only
[1:00:39] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:00:43] i want everybody
[1:00:45] to have access to that message
[1:00:48] i want you to go listen to it
[1:00:51] and i want you to thoroughly listen to
[1:00:53] it
[1:01:49] this is important
[1:02:04] as he explained
[1:02:18] listen i'm gonna read these things and
[1:02:19] then i'll get into because i'm not done
[1:02:20] with prayer
[1:02:22] listen people
[1:02:24] cry out for prayer
[1:02:26] can you cry out that god will teach you
[1:02:28] how to pray
[1:02:31] god know how to pray
[1:02:45] most of us have never
[1:02:59] god just heard us
[1:03:16] aspiration
[1:03:17] after this is the ceos
[1:03:20] this is why
[1:03:21] i probably missed this song
[1:03:23] amen look what he says
[1:03:26] in the message
[1:03:55] the seven seals have been opened
[1:03:59] the whirlwind is to the west coast
[1:04:02] since
[1:04:04] western he said now don't miss it
[1:04:07] they did back yonder coming
[1:04:14] a little closer to our day and people
[1:04:16] personally what does the scripture say
[1:04:19] about today
[1:04:21] about the time we live in
[1:04:24] jesus
[1:04:52] figure
[1:05:05] god is about to do something
[1:05:10] we'll listen to that
[1:05:13] question within our minds
[1:05:15] what is god getting ready to do
[1:05:19] because this
[1:05:21] under the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:05:24] it is personal
[1:05:26] you mean a priest
[1:05:30] what was he doing
[1:05:32] fulfilling the scripture
[1:05:47] is that right
[1:05:49] and he ties this very thing that's
[1:05:51] happening
[1:05:52] [Music]
[1:05:54] into the event don't don't leave venema
[1:05:57] that jesus was in the temple
[1:06:01] and they asked jesus to read it
[1:06:05] and he read out of isaiah
[1:06:09] closed it with this day the scripture is
[1:06:12] fulfilled
[1:06:16] what was he
[1:06:29] this is why
[1:06:45] because that's what he's doing now
[1:06:48] jesus christ jesus is coming into flesh
[1:06:52] not just william brown
[1:06:55] williams
[1:07:05] [Music]
[1:07:11] you cannot be changed
[1:07:19] [Music]

[1:09:25] directing you to the scripture
[1:09:27] he's supplying these scriptures to
[1:09:29] himself
[1:09:32] he's trying to unveil to the people they
[1:09:34] said this is a divorce
[1:09:35] they're sitting right before them jesus
[1:09:39] they saw jesus
[1:09:40] but they were blind to the facts
[1:09:45] they were living in the day of their
[1:09:47] visitation
[1:09:50] and so has this church aimed at
[1:09:52] a glitch this is the church
[1:09:56] did not recognize
[1:09:58] a day of visitation
[1:10:14] he could
[1:10:40] [Applause]
[1:10:41] he was the son of man
[1:10:44] now here we come

[1:13:30] world war
[1:14:40] that's what
[1:15:10] i would do it
[1:15:12] but i gotta wait for him

[1:16:10] leave the message
[1:16:12] learn the message
[1:16:16] without the holy spirit
[1:16:19] the bible said is christ in you

[1:17:28] gives you a new birth you've done
[1:17:30] innovations
[1:17:32] from a pig to a dog
[1:17:38] in columbus or from a buzzer to a dove
[1:17:42] uh
[1:17:49] then if moses said he saw that
[1:17:53] and testified to the to be the truth

[1:18:36] it's just a sneeze
[1:18:50] but why do we feel
[1:18:53] like when god comes to our house
[1:19:05] god took shadrach meshach
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:30] i think the only one they could
[1:19:31] fellowship with that with was with
[1:19:33] daniela
[1:19:57] and those hebrew boys we call them boys
[1:20:00] it's a
[1:20:01] finality they were real men
[1:20:13] matter of fact
[1:20:15] honestly they were willing
[1:20:18] to die in faith
[1:20:22] without deliverance
[1:20:27] is that right
[1:20:28] brother said it like this
[1:20:30] he said they even had a prayer meeting
[1:20:35] and god kept quiet
[1:20:41] oh jesus
[1:20:43] and they said even though
[1:20:46] he's on the memphis i haven't heard from
[1:20:48] him
[1:20:49] hallelujah i'm still not going to bow
[1:20:54] satan's unbelief
[1:21:34] [Music]
[1:21:40] that's what it is
[1:21:53] [Music]
[1:21:54] it was god who in in
[1:21:56] uh tabernacled himself
[1:22:03] it was god it's a jew
[1:22:06] who
[1:22:07] tabernacled himself she said
[1:22:22] they start
[1:22:36] that's
[1:23:11] y'all should be saying amen really
[1:23:13] louder than that my dear friend is a man
[1:23:18] i think i heard my wife i never heard
[1:23:19] her
[1:23:21] praise the lord for my wife
[1:23:23] i'm sure there were other people
[1:23:25] but my point is
[1:23:27] what i'm trying to build here
[1:23:30] by the inspiration of the holy ghost
[1:23:32] is your faith
[1:23:47] faith safwa all people all men whether
[1:23:49] be converted or not
[1:23:55] live by faith
[1:23:57] some kind
[1:23:59] right
[1:24:00] but you don't
[1:24:14] you need his face
[1:24:39] and i don't care how much the pastor
[1:24:41] prayed for you my temper
[1:24:55] because they lack the faith
[1:25:01] and he's the same yesterday
[1:25:06] i will be so happy
[1:25:08] when we get to the place
[1:25:11] instead of worrying only this complaint
[1:25:13] we begin to praise him
[1:25:18] worry worry works against you the
[1:25:20] complaints
[1:25:23] bring you usher our
[1:25:47] he said if jesus christ stood there and
[1:25:49] read that day see jesus
[1:26:20] said
[1:26:22] they were looking at the naturals
[1:26:25] lord this man
[1:26:26] my brother my friend he's been dead four
[1:26:28] days
[1:26:31] how could he live what might be his life
[1:26:48] people
[1:26:50] you must get with god to the fact to the
[1:26:53] point
[1:26:54] that satan has no space
[1:26:59] the judgment is
[1:27:20] every day
[1:27:21] satan is accusing you of the keys
[1:27:25] and he's got good evidence
[1:27:28] he's got some good evidence
[1:27:30] how
[1:27:44] he became my sins
[1:27:49] he said but you've got to believe this
[1:27:50] part too
[1:27:52] i have become the righteousness
[1:27:55] so when you understand that by
[1:27:57] revelations
[1:28:07] and that's what we do
[1:28:08] lord what have i done wrong just because
[1:28:10] you're faithful
[1:28:11] nothing wrong
[1:28:38] and when your faith fails
[1:28:40] you
[1:28:50] can i go just a little bit longer
[1:28:52] i know i've gone along this morning just
[1:28:54] give me a little bit more time
[1:28:56] he said we stand here tonight
[1:28:59] and say that jesus christ is the same
[1:29:01] yesterday
[1:29:04] he said god is obligated
[1:29:07] to prove that to be so
[1:29:10] because it's his word
[1:29:15] you all need to talk to god
[1:29:18] you need to start taking this message
[1:29:20] and says lord you said that
[1:29:29] all things are possible to choose from
[1:29:34] that belief
[1:29:36] that's the
[1:29:50] oh god help us see god is more than able
[1:29:55] listen what i'm gonna read and i'm gonna
[1:29:57] close on this video uh
[1:29:59] he says
[1:30:00] sometimes
[1:30:01] therefore you may be sitting out there
[1:30:04] with cancer
[1:30:08] or you might be setting with a disease
[1:30:12] you think
[1:30:14] why me

[1:31:42] it's the lord
[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:39] of god
[1:32:43] it was a real praise of god
[1:32:50] there isn't enough whistles
[1:33:07] it takes the spirit of god it's upon us
[1:33:09] at the moment
[1:33:10] come down on it
[1:33:13] that's what does it mean
[1:33:15] and they're long forgotten yet
[1:33:18] because
[1:33:20] they've classed the gift of the holy
[1:33:22] ghost
[1:33:24] initial evidence of speaking in tongues
[1:33:29] and i heard devils and witches
[1:34:16] oh you got people oh i ain't gonna go
[1:34:17] there because that's another you know
[1:34:19] it's amazing it amaze we all battle we
[1:34:22] all got weaknesses we've got
[1:34:25] because of this of course it's a share
[1:34:27] but greater the greater man is inside
[1:34:30] the greater
[1:34:35] see
[1:34:36] you know people say well lord i can't

[1:34:43] there nali memphis
[1:34:52] and if you get serious about overcoming
[1:34:55] it
[1:34:55] was that serious he'll give you the
[1:34:57] overcoming power
[1:35:02] there will not be any excuses in heaven
[1:35:04] you are a german this is kiss lucille
[1:35:07] none
[1:35:08] okay not one member
[1:35:11] because he's giving us what it
[1:35:38] i haven't gotten to that part of prayer
[1:35:40] but i just got to work

[1:35:45] those who who were here wednesday y'all
[1:35:47] heard
[1:35:48] this

[1:35:52] really getting into the spirit of the
[1:35:53] anointing

[1:36:20] malachi 4.
[1:36:36] at the world says the messiah we know
[1:36:39] when the messiah comes
[1:36:41] hallelujah
[1:36:42] listen outside of that
[1:36:45] on the older side it can't be the holy
[1:36:47] ghost
[1:36:49] if it says it's the holy spirit and
[1:36:52] denies one word of that bible
[1:36:56] cannot be the holy ghost
[1:37:00] that's the evidence
[1:37:02] whether you believe or not
[1:37:17] fervent
[1:37:21] yeah talking about prayer
[1:37:23] the effects were fervent that
[1:37:24] desperation
[1:37:26] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:37:29] man availeth much
[1:37:46] your heart
[1:37:48] it won't work
[1:37:51] it works it's a function but the bible
[1:37:53] said if you got a ought against the
[1:37:55] brotherhood

[1:40:18] [Laughter]
[1:40:21] call whatever you want to say
[1:40:24] i can tell you what the prophet says
[1:40:27] remember that little boy with the
[1:40:28] corduroy pads
[1:40:32] his affliction tied him up into knots
[1:40:48] what was in his house
[1:40:50] the clothes the baby would be wearing

[1:41:30] but we failed to tap into it
[1:41:34] afraid of the supernatural
[1:41:36] hallelujah
[1:41:38] and what god is trying to tell us
[1:41:41] that when you pray
[1:41:43] i'll show you things

[1:41:48] oh yeah
[1:41:50] and we need to know that
[1:41:53] he said it it's the token it gives you

[1:42:55] that's what desperation
[1:42:57] sound like that's desperation suddenly
[1:42:59] there's a spot that's what we should
