opening to read your word I pray that you Quicken up father God these words so they can spring forth from the pages of the Bible and be made living in our life we ask it in the precious son's name Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah hallelujah while you're standing let us open our Bibles to the book of uh Leviticus in chapter 25 CH 25 and verse 8 ver the Bible reads and thou sh number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven time seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 49 years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month Amen in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall Hollow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family verse 13 in the year of this Jubilee you shall return every man unto his possession amen may the Lord add blessing to the reading of his word may take our seats amen um this evening I want to speak on go Jubilee go Jubilee amen amen so in other words go celebrate God celebrate your freedom Amen in the Bible verse that we read God was telling the children of Israel that I'm making a way I'm making a provision that if you have been bound before if you have lost something before I'm making a way so that you can get back to your position I'm making a way that if you were a slave you can be set free amen they were still under the law but we can see grace already in operation hallelujah hallelujah and so when the children of Israel crossed into the promised land from Egypt Joshua gave each and every one of them a portion of land that was promised to them their possession due to the course of time people lost their land people lost their inheritance because they had gotten themselves into debt and they had gotten themselves into trouble and their god-given inheritance was taken from them and they had to go and work as slaves but God said it does not have to end like that he made a way that after each and every 50 years every man go back to your inheritance go back to your possession and he say the 50th year shall be the Year of Jubilee a year of Celebration and we see that this uh the trumpet of Jubilee was supposed to be sounded on the 10 th day of the seventh month which was the day of atonement amen this was a shadow signifying the coming of Christ who was coming to atone your sins and my sins amen and when Christ came the law was done away with so the coming of Christ he atoning of your sins in my sins was the ultimate Jubilee amen telling that you and me whatever we have done you can break free from It Whatever possession you have lost you can go and get it back because it is yours it is your god-given inheritance amen am so we know we as spiritual Israel hallu each and every one of us have blessings to us and no one can take your blessing away from you hallelujah hallelujah Satan might try to to take them away from the season but you got to go back to him and tell Satan that's my god-given blessing that's my god-given possession you can try to steal your joy away from you but you got to go and take it back give me back my joy you can steal away your peace but you can say God promise me peace that pass all I like if someone said Peace that makes no sense because if the peace passes understanding it makes no sense Hallelujah you go and you say Satan I'm I'm taking the back that piece that makes no sense Hallelujah he might be troubling your health go get your health my God given inheritance my God given possession hallelujah hallelujah so when we were born we were born with amnesia we do not remember where we came from this Earthly mind that we have at best it probably goes back to when you were 5 years old but you don't remember where you actually came from but we thank God for the word it came to tell us of our or origin of our inheritance that we come from the back part of God's mind that's where we're before and that's where we're going back hallelujah hallelujah so you have a purpose God has a purpose in your life and nothing can stop you from achieving your purp God told Jeremiah before you were formed in your mother's I knew so before Jeremiah Was Born his purpose was already there so this old flesh cannot stop God's purpose in my life amen amen so go to Satan tell him give me back my possession hallelujah hallelujah I'm speak speak on go Jubilee so in the verse that we read earlier on due to deaths due to uh criminal offenses they had committed they were forced to go into slavery and they started working for task Masters they started working in fields as a way to repay their debt and each and every one of them they had Masters enslaved from their god-given [Music] inheritance amen amen for 49 years they would uh they would struggle in this bondage but God told Moses that on the 50th year the priest is supposed to go sound the trumpet and that trumpet is called the trumpet of Jubilee and when that trumpet sounds it does not matter where you are what you are doing you have to stop immediately and start rejoicing that my freedom is come the prophet of God said they would wake up waiting for the rise of the Sun as soon as the Rays of the sun would cross they will start rejoicing they tell their task Masters You Don't Own Me No More you have no right over me no more not for themselves only but you say you have no right over my family Hallelujah but we thank God for the rising of the Sun not the S but the s o n at the rising of the sun our freedom came so every man can go free your sin have no hold on you your sins have no hold of them the committed in in the past and the sins that you are going to commit they have no hold over you they were all erased hallelujah hallelujah in Jubilee the prophet of God say it says many hundred years has passed but the same God that sent Jubilee in them days is the same God who sends Jubilee today all the people that had been captured and was in captivity they come in acceptable [Music] year an acceptable year the Year of Jubilee and when the trumpet sounded all the ones that were in captivity didn't have to pay any price they could absolutely go free they could drop their hole if they were hoing or whatever instrument they were working with they had to drop it and go free no price was paid why because Christ pay the Tim he purchased for all of it everything that you owed he took care of it turnning Jubilee says now if somehow or the individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by God they come a Year of Jubilee amen and this Year of Jubilee meant that every person who had lost their inheritance by some if he was a Freeborn and a true blooded Israelite no matter who held the Poss had to go back to him free he didn't have to pay a thing just to what he was doing go back to his inheritance this was for Israelites none Israelites were not part of this Jubilee was for a predestinated people sons of Abraham and the prophet tells us that if you believe the word of God the Bible tells us that you are a son of Abraham you are a Seed of Abraham so that promise of Jubilee is for you and me some people might say I'm staying in my sin but you you will walk out of it that's why some of your friends don't understand this message because the Jubilee is not meant for them it's meant for a special kind of people predestinated Sons and Daughters of [Music] God Amen am so it was meant for Israelites Abraham's seed and wherever we see Abraham's seed I put myself in there because I know I'm a spiritual son of Abraham hallelujah hallelujah and when God forgives he forgets amen amen there's only two things he cannot do he cannot fail and he cannot remember your hallelujah hallelujah I remember this uh this one story I had one brother uh went to went to the prophet and he said I he did something wrong in the past and he confessed about it and he says I keep on feeling guilty about it and every now and again I KN I go to kneel down in prayer and ask God for forgiveness and the prophet of God tell him this but you know what every time you kneel down to pray God is hearing that for the first time because he doesn't remember it amen amen so if God cannot remember it then who are people to remember amen people have long enough roads fishing roads go into the sea of forgetfulness and try and fish it out they tell you that 16 years ago June the 12th 12 pm. at such and such a place you did this and you did that you say this and you say that but I don't care about that if I confess to God God does not remember it if God does not remember it it does not matter might as well start forgetting about it God has the final say you are allowed to have your say say doesn't matter the only say that matters is God say because he is Sovereign and he is the ultimate say hallelujah hallelujah so all your sins everything you confess When you pray God forgive me he wipes it clean hallelujah hallelujah so when you start feeling guilty about something you already confessed the enemy's trick try and keep you down and Satan starts telling you going to hear your prayer because you did this you did that but the Bible says if your heart condemns you not you can go and ask whatever you want and God is obligated to give it to because he always keeps his word hallelujah hallelujah because he already atoned for it your sins and your iniquities he wiped them all clean and he reconciled us back to God hallelujah hallelujah they got down away with the with the with the priesthood of Aon and he came as the priest after the order of MEC the final and timate high priest priest that's touched by the feeling of our infir he's touched by the feeling of our infirm that means he knows what you're going through he says I know amen that's why he came to be a man so he just does not say I can heal you of something you never experienced so when you are sick he knows exactly how that feels the prophet of God says he was not 50% God and 50% man because that would make it unfair if it was half human half God but he was a 100% man that he was able to go through everything that you went through but he was also 100% God that he can take you out of what you were going through Hallelujah so when you pray to him he knows exactly what you're going through when you are feeling forsaken he knows what you are going through he was forsaken by Peter Peter says I don't know who that man is he know exactly how that feels when you pray he's that friend that Seth closer than a brother he knows what you going through when you are sick he knows what you're going through when you are depressed he knows what you're going through so just say Lord I'm inviting you into my situation because I know you know exactly if you have lost a loved one he knows how that feels he lost his best friend Lazarus and you went through the motion of crying so when you need a comforter he knows exactly what he's doing amen am because he went through the exact same situation that you went through high priest amen by the feeling of our infirmities Amen Let Us Go to Luke 4 verse [Music] 17 and then Jesus when he was on Earth he walked into the synagogue and they gave him a scroll to read historians say that during a synagogue in a service they had seven men who would come to read the scroll there have seven people come to to read the scroll in this particular instance Jesus was the seventh when he read this verse verse 17 says and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isas and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives what was he doing he was telling the people he was sent for he was reading out his mission statement amen he sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives oh he's talking about the Jubilee and the recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised verse 19 to preach the acceptable year of the Lord the acceptable year of the Lord is the Year of Jubilee so he is telling the people in the synagogue have come to preach the year of juile I've come to preach Deliverance to all the captives I've come to give sight to the blind set Liberty those that are bruised as soon as he was done he closed the book he gave it back to the minister and he sat down and All Eyes of them that were in the synagogue were fasting on him amen amen and he began to say to them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears Hallelujah the prophecy that was written by Isaiah he was telling them the manifestation of that prophecy I am that prophecy made flesh Hallelujah and he says This Day scripture is fulfilled so everyone who was bound it was time for them to get free l b time for his side to get back hallelujah hallelujah that Maniac who was bound by chains it was time for those demons to leave why because he said this day this scripture is fulfilled hallelujah hallelujah and I can say that this evening this day this scripture is fulfilled because he has come to deliver the cap he has come to set you free hallelujah hallelujah he has come to break those Chain break you out of depression break you out of anxiety break you out of those evil habits they cannot hold you back anymore why because no one can stand before Jesus Hallelujah when he came all heaven was backing him all authority in his hand Hallelujah you call him on the S you know it's a d de seven demons that were in Mary Magdalene they could not stand a chance they had to run away why because at the mention of the name Jesus demon has to flee At The Mention Of that name has to Bow and the mention of that name Satan has to flee hallelujah hallelujah Legion was being tormented by 6,000 Devils but when Jesus came by they started crying they started pleading why have you come to torment his presence alone and I can tell you his presence is in the building his presence alone is enough to set you free his presence alone is enough to change your situation hallelujah hallelujah and those demons they cried they say please let us go into those uh into those pigs and he gave them their heart desires I have a question for you this evening if he can give demons their heart desires what about you what about me you are a son and a daughter of God by his Precious Blood amen he will give you your heart desire just raise your hand say Lord I need you provide my heart desire and he can do it for you hallelujah hallelujah nothing can stand before he came to fulfill all the tpes in the Old Testament he the only one who could complete the work of redemption he came to redeem you from the P where you were he came to redeem you from the mess you were in to make you a Son of God not that you were not before but you open your eyes and that you were a Son of God before the foundation of world Satan tried to drag you into some mess thank God for the message of the hour the trumpet of Jubilee sounded to come and redeem you take you out of your mess clean you up and now you can walk chest out say I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God the same Authority that Jesus has he placed it in your hands so you can go to the devil and say you have troubled me enough enough is enough give me back my possession enough is enough give me back my children enough is enough give me back my family that's your possession you applied that token that is yours hallelujah hallelujah the Jubilee has sounded we can all go free amen amen when he was in that Garden of GE he was thinking of you you were on his mind he prayed and he cried and he said Lord if it was my will I would let this cup pass he toiled and he was thinking out through all that night do you know what made him go to Calvary he had you on your mind his mind he had me on his mind he had your health on his mind that's why he said nevertheless I will go cuz he wanted to redeem you hallelujah hallelujah and on that cross when he cried he cried it is finished what was he saying that was him blowing the trumpet of ju whatever you are going through I can tell you it is finished because Christ blew that jubil trumpet in the inment don't don't don't don't the prophet of God says he's talking about when Jesus went into the pie of Hell during the three days when he was in the in the Tomb and he went on to knock on the Gate of Hell hallelujah hallelujah he was taking back his possession he was going back to take the keys that the inment uh um paragraph 87 the prophet of God say I can hear him say Satan come here not may you come here you come here he say he is boss now it says reaches over grabs that key of death and Hell hallelujah hallelujah he walked in he did not wait for invitation open those Gates of Hell grab those keys from Satan and he put them on his side and he says I want to serve notice on you you've been a Blu long enough I'm the Virgin born son of the Living God my blood is still worth on the cross and the full debt is paid debt is paid my debt is paid you have no rights no more the devil has no right over you you are Blood Bought you chist most purchased you have no rights no more you are stripped me those keys that's right he says he turns around and gives him a good healthy kick and he slams the door together and he say stay in there I'm boss from now on hallelujah hallelujah so Satan has been slammed inside of Hell death does not have power over you hell has no power over you CU his powers were stripped off by Jesus blew that Jubilee trumpet he took back all power into his hand and he kicked Satan and say you stay in there and the same power that was in Jesus is in you and me so if the power that was in Jesus gave him the power to kick Satan the power that is in you and me tonight gives you the ability to kick K Satan off your promises kick Satan off your family kick Satan off your finances hallelujah hallelujah give Satan a healthy kick because Jesus did it he did it for you and me hallelujah hallelujah Glory as soon as you hear that word that says you can be set free it says you rejoice in and I'm the resurrection and the life paragraph 24 the prophet of God says soon as you hear the word of God that says you can be set free he says believe it Rejoice with it I like this part it say God will show the evidence after you have accepted it but first you accept it hallelujah hallelu amen I'm going read that one again one more time it says soon as you hear the word of God that says you can be set free Believe It Believe each and every word it says Rejoice with it God will show the evidence after you have accepted it but first you accept it take it into your own life Mary started rejoicing before she gave birth why because she accepted that word when she accepted that word that baby started growing inside of her she had not seen the baby yet because she believed it accepted it she started rejoicing she went to her cousin and started jumping and rejoicing to say I'm carrying Jesus whom she had not yet even seen why because she believed it she accepted it if you accept the word of God if you believe it in your life you can start jumping you can start dancing because I know the evidence is coming all I got to do all I have to do is accept it when you accept it God starts working in your life Abraham and Sarah they were told they were going to have a baby it took them 25 years but they already started rejoicing they did not lose Faith hallelujah hallelujah I believe Abraham started calling Sarah mama because they accepted that word that word when you accept it it is responsible to transform you it is responsible for conditioning you to receive that promise that you are believing it for the word that Abraham received the same word that rejuvenated from being old to being young so when you believe the word of God that same word is going to bring that promise to you even if you are not ready the word of God is responsible belied accepted the evidence is following the manifestation of your belief is following I believe you all know the testimony of John Ryan I was reading that earlier on he was he was prayed for he was prayed for by the prophet and he was blind and after a few minutes he came back to the prophet and he says where is my sight how come I cannot see and the prophet said Do you believe he says I believe but where is my sight the prophet say Hey listen God said he will do it and he's going to do it he went away came back following day I I still can't see you told me I'm Healed but I'm still blind the prophet of God said listen if you stop believing you're going to lose that healing so from now on you start believing and you start professing that I can see and the following they had meeting and the following three days he was being a nuisance in the service he was being a nuisance in the service during the prayer line he was standing up he's shouting praise the Lord I can see every time was jumping up when people are quiet he was jumping up shouting praise the Lord I can see and people are looking at this crazy man he blind but he's saying he can see but he was going with what the prophet told he was believing that and he got off those meetings he was walking on the streets amen he was selling newspapers say extra extra I can see he believed it he accepted that word he was just waiting for the evidence of it he was just waiting for

manifestation of what you are Believing on comeing your way hallelujah hallelujah he is almighty God do all things he can never ever fail Glory accept that word the evidence is following when God speaks a word it has to come to pass Isaiah said when God speaks a word it does not come back to him void after accomplished that which he had purposed it for so when you are reading your Bible and you see a word that talks about you you believe on it that's God speaking to you you believe on it and that word is not going to go back to God until it has accomplished that which he said hallelujah

the life he talking about the children of Israel just a little bit down on um paragraph 24 it says and if he's almighty God he can do all things and if he cannot do all things then he is not almighty God day it is amen amen say notice what kind of a boy ought this to be what kind of a person God keeping his word God's promise to do anything God will do it says when the children of Israel was led out of Egypt God promised to take care of them as they Journey Through the wilderness God said he will take care of them and he did do it no matter where the path LED an enemy got in God's path it gave way I like this I can see them come up to the Red Sea God had his map Dr out he knew where he was taking them they did not see God's plan they were wondering why is God sending us sea have mountains either way we have a sea in front of us and we have the enemy behind us but God was seeing what they were not seeing that's why trust God because he is the master strategist he had his map Dr out he was he was going to take them they will move right up to the Red Sea there was no way at all to cross it here was Pharaoh's Army the mountains on one side Pharaoh's Army there front of him Moses lifted up his hands Psalm 72 said God looked down listen to this he's seen that path laying through the bottom of the sea children of Israel did not see where they were going God from Heaven he was seeing that path Under the Red Sea that's why you got to trust where God Le doesn't matter look like I will take your will your way laying right through the the bottom of the sea there was there his children right there needing the promise taking God at his word hallelujah God sees a way where there is no way you are standing between a rock and a place there's a path right there that you cannot see just trust on him waiting for you to open no Red Sea can stop you listen to this it says God looked down through that pill fire and with angered eyes oh I love that he says and when he did the sea god scared and moved back and made a dry path Israel walked through on dry ground see God scared because God was angry hallelu your troubles will will get scared when God is angry your sickness will get scared angry your depression will get scared when God gets angry and you will see that path that you were not see do you remember the three Hebrew boys what happened when God stepped into those Flames heat got scared [Applause] right the fire that the heat that was in the fire got scared I don't know how that heat separated from the flame and the Flames were just there no heat the
