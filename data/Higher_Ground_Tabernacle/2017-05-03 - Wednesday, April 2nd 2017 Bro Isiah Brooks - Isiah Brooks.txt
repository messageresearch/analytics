John 5:19 say John 5:30 and it's 8 times 15 st. John bye [Music] getting up the night pool first everybody did and then Manhattan then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say to you the son can do nothing of himself but what you see if the father do you man but what thing soever he doeth these also doing he do it the son like laughter evening for the father loveth the son and showed him all things that himself dude and he will show him greater works than these that he made mark really ray how'd I know you love me you may have a thing like that let's finish it up but as the father raises up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son who quickeneth movement he will that's our aim for the father judges no man but have committed all judgment unto the son he make there all mention out of the Sun and even as they honor the father a men he that utters not the son honoureth not the Father which got sentiment oh man say John 5:30 I can of my own self do nothing he may as I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will but the will of the thought of which helps it merely one more scripture st. John 15:5 through 8 and John 15:5 2:8 you love the Lord in your hand I am the vine ye are the branches that's true he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing real an amen if a man abideth not in he listen to that in me that's important he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned reaming if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and ye shall be it shall be done unto you amen here is my father glorified like sticks that you bear much fruit so shall ye be - I'm at amen and as a father has loved me so have I loved you continue ye in my love let us pray father we come before your Lord as humbly as we know house and we thank you for your amazing grace amen we thank you for the mercy that you have shown us throughout the days in other years Lord we thank you because you have not dealt with us according to our sins I pray that your clears up Satan refill books these are loaded crushes and we may live that we may God that you may help us now Lord if we approach your throne as calmly as we know how to cleanse us from all unrighteousness let nothing hinder your message tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I like to entitle this message resting in elohim's promise resting and Elohim promise because we realized by God's grace that God is a spirit learning and the Bible said nowhere have seen them at any time and any man now the Bible said the son have seen him and declared basically when you see Jesus you see the father right right according to st. John 10:30 where the Balaam goes on and he talks about Joel and he said in the book of Joel God is called Elohim and Elohim is that self-existing one Joel though he was ridiculed made fun of she is amazing because when you really love God you choose to walk in his way oftentimes people don't understand you and they will make fun of you behind but the Prophet God said go after this Joel was resting in Ellen Hills promise she jogged in know Jesus right the only new element we are fortunate that we know jinx but Joel gnudi self-existing one God spirit and by this spirit God gave joke revelation and understanding of what was required for his date out of all the people in jobs time we only know of one that did whatever him wanted him to do and God called him perfect now Joe was not perfect with himself then but because Joel had a revelation of the sacrifice see without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin hey hey so Joe brought all the sacrifice and offerings unto God and God called Joe now you must understand because oak was born see shapen in iniquity treasure as everybody else around come on speaking lies God baby Joe Joe was a heart of God before the foundation of the world and it was God's business to make himself known to Joe like his God's business to make us know him know we would look at these things and you know I go back to what brother Gavin said he said he said that jesus never healed anyone and then almost stumbled in because I'm like Jesus is God but Jesus declared himself and I can't do nothing except the father showed me and then when I see him doing something he said I judge it and I know it to be true well select a creature that I didn't have to worry about safe cuz God the vision hey and he knew he's gonna come back so we find out that the same God who promised Jesus and gained his inheritance to his only begotten son his son comes around and gives us he said he remembers is that right bearing all that the father was in the father he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he brought it into the church here and all of the promises of God oh yeah right only yeah you am i him hey not on him not around me not just with him he must begin you this is all oh yeah Christ in you ready hallelujah I am come on amen that's what Jesus said I am the vine and ye are the branch measure divine can never go back ready you don't prune the vine you prune that French the vine is always like yes and if you apply in the vine you were grateful what fruit nothing that's what he said and if you abide in me and my words abide in you you should ask what you will and it shall be done unto you didn't say you're gonna do it is that it shall be done that means my father will do it then unto you that's right here is my father good behavior I love it not teach us how to pray he didn't say my father is my father the same Elohim that drag those attributes in the shake out of here who spoke Jesus in our existence and spoke us too we are known that God she's us as a mature god that's true amen yeah but when I'm sitting in God hiding in simplicity he said Jesus said if you're all all says your thoughts nothing talking about amateur gods like a subtle name revealing these son of man she D son of man is God a son of man is a reflection or not yeah even I'm saying so when you say I've heard people say well let me stop it that the evening program that the fullness of the Godhead bodily blocking him where's that God was in him amen that God was in Christ all that was in God he brought it into his church and so brother Branham I'm the only one with the Holy Ghost all the body of Christ came that day had the Holy know that he had a diff lock so when you say when you say then the fullness of Godhead of a Godhead I said it but people do say it you're literally making him god you're taking him out of the element of the seventh angel because the seventh angel couldn't be gone because the seven stars was in the hand of God y'all give them say I say these things on your understand there is a fine line I will always follow way around them as he follow Christ like Paul say follow me the pole never said worship me see so you must understand and then we ought to follow the prophet of the day his message is correct but now what do we bow down and worship again y'all giving him say so because you yourself must understand there is one creator and there's only nothing given under heaven whereby men must be saved and that is the name of Jesus cry people say robear was mikela dick he was not but McKenna that was in it but he wasn't Macavity because if he lost you're saying that brother Branham had no beginning update no Indians night you said brother Brown can help us he had a lover she the necklace on line that's right it doesn't matter chief a fine line is like one word God you twist it and you in chaos that's right you can make this thing mean something that it doesn't mean the Lord spoke like I'm not too many but all I spoke to me until the people come back to worshiping me and come away from idolatry they will not get the same song hey man I'll be crucified for statement like that amen but it's true any a memory now just like and brother keep it I was going to preach I'm coming to it and Louis time there was enough uh-uh-uh-uh-uh karma showed up that's right yeah and then what baile means were lard and Israel was blinded and that spiritually they were worshipping is endemic in the listen mister truth because one thing I not know about bail Russia when you began to worship an idol whatever that Idol stand for that's the kind of life you will live and bail Russia was fill no fornication and all kinds of stuff with you among the pale worshipers but when you worship the God of my job you will live a holy life don't miss somebody that's what we see like a people part and not taking this thing see we're resting in the promises of every day then we believe on his son hallelujah that God would give us a sidelight and that he gave us his son good the more she brother branham and I don't know the me move on you listen he said listen it is written he our God we are every true born-again believer that Scott the hoist at the school you are God but you would not know hallelujah you are calling him you are his attributes hallelujah but Elohim existed when nothing else existed hallelujah God what makes you eternal is it called Elohim gives you a policy rider that right and we fail to see that there are two inbred nations in this message like in lost in the days of Elizabeth and Mary yellow one was impregnated with a and the other ones impregnated by the word hallelujah let's move on I'd like to say about that but I want you to understand what God is done the problem with us is that we're not believe in the message like it's written it's spoken to us we are beyond sinners Hey just say my great man God when he gives you oh my god God watch over everything yeah yeah yeah thank you nothing else is added to you you're so justified and they'll be Levison in the party but the problem is is that getting us to really believe there is no one-man show any more photos amen imagine a corner reading in just a moment a game for the widow said when the mouth Transfiguration experience Paquin he said the days of the prophets were over the glorification with wait on Jesus it doesn't mean that we do away with brother Randall but we must know where the glory must go I find that I'm just really close and people are contributing saying honey his brothers and he didn't do in a dog head he gave all the glory to Jesus pot I got supposed to problems it because I don't want the glory I don't know music I don't know much of it I want nothing good come to me the only thing I care about is that Jesus Christ [Applause] let me tell you something we forgot and we wanna rely on we've got to go back to the true and living God Hey Wow we back to the dog this is your daughter coming I'm not ashamed of this message Thank You mr. right I mean it's giving life to me I don't know what I do without it but like I said I mean I was talking about Halloween brendham listen properly he didn't bring God brought a toy he said I'm just a truck I'm just talking somebody else's plate this to me look what God did to make Abraham a part of you he gave Abraham part of his name he came ahead ah hello amen but he did not give us a fall oh sure he gave us his full name cuz it is right is that right the vices but just cause I found a visa to the Father not gives all about it me to the table we must bow to the holiday oh Jesus because God is looking for I don't know how safe is the right word a replica in shell amen can I put it this way Jesus Christ was the spitting image of God amen l owe him an invisible hallelujah not by his facial feature by the fullness of the Godhead the focus of the Godhead bodily wells give the bride was wanting to go over how we consist calm out and you all bow to the mate what must we do I'm resting and run in hello he'll hate on us amen right Jesus couldn't give a promise except lol getting the problem I know it sounds like I'm separating them into what I'm not because they were one that's a mystery of the Godhead pod hey hey took its season and they're just about was money that's what God expects from us man that's why he gives us His Holy Spirit because there's only one spill any hallelujah idea will going features above 15 says wherefore also after I heard your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ love unto all the same cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you with my prayers is all right that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him this listen came up to give you the revelation of the knowledge in him and give he is in you and you are in him the revelation is about you and oh we didn't know one like I said you heard me say this many times we didn't know what a son of God would we thought of son of god was just a sinner saved by grace we never could elevate our shelter bring ourselves up to be a real son because we never thought about what a real son of God and you know nothing was all he's a chip off the old block like were you know Kate refer to God as the old block for the point here we are chip off of him with a rotational off oh please a weasel got off him and he placed it up and that little piece is still God I'm resting resti hallelujah the god of our Lord Jesus Christ

calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in where the straight and let not on the Saints but because of people to whom he goes now you gotta understand he's covered in him that

busines be preaching on Sunday off on that taking this message but my part is by God's grace I mean when you and I see that God is working in us listen the Lord show me that's so clearly every time we we just been steadily looking back like uncool spirits God wants us to move forward and your promises of these messages for us hallelujah brother man is not coming back to reveal and school nurse or whatever riding the trail again is about is about us it wasn't talked about is natural being even talked about that was a costing him he'll provide the trail again hello we must let us say that God made promises and I'm resting on Ella him from hallelujah harder what kellian promises off because gosh shit's a promise and this day and the word of the Lord comes to the body what the prophets were the words came to the product and then the prophet and the word became one and that's what to my god the message of the problem is one that's right you understand it hallelujah blending in to get payment hallelujah but if you take your word from the message up from the prophet he's just anything hey I owe you a man hallelujah there's only one man that was able to reach from today man by the power of God like that and that was Jesus Christ himself hallelujah I was reading Corinthians just just the other day Paul shake it up said some of you off see for summoning off of this one and that one in the element is death not like yesterday we got these great men of God I want to call them into this I can they're somehow my phone here I don't know buddy hola hey i'm a jesus car that's only what i want to be identified we got all these people please look at the mess these people see you put your trust in all the flesh God will make that person fall so he can keep put your eyes back on here hallelujah I ain't asking nobody to trust me but trust the word hallelujah is that okay Rolla says in a row they said there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are we're in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but out if there is a place where there is no condemnation whether you go to a Baptist Church or Baptist Church or present future wherever it is if you are in Christ now this in 1965 so how do we in this message will put people out rather than say no matter where you go we got to come over here and give you t touch my name is Hannah a man hallelujah ready brother random gonna get it ain't don't trust a man it's what a man oh mama boys at the call God will reveal himself to that intro it doesn't matter what he told us the law of reproduction he told us a long hurt he's got a chicken prints on the Eagle but we don't believe it's pure help it all and then because I'm at a stop when you are key cold it'll make no difference try God when you hatch and God and then begin to ensure you you see was he he they don't know the word let me ask you a question it when you were born you came out of your mother's womb what book did you read to grow up no you know

truly got a in spirit God will pull them out of those systems yes sir his words they come out of her mouth marketing to see how her seeing but don't tell me that everybody still there Amen that is not we just haven't seen the manifest yet hey man you don't have to shout I'm saying it cause it's true look at me where was I when God found me I knew nothing about this message I saw supernatural before I came here I saw God create people before I came here man it wasn't that I mean it he did it right because I always was coming here take a look and denominational presents it but that's supernatural God is anything you don't know you don't know people you know you look at somebody dressed and you think what they take you God well maybe God had showed them that yeah man still people in the message who still have trouble with dressing because there is not revealed to them holiness it'll have only go but if approach we got the Holy Ghost on Shogun man that's true numbers are you can't take away this is what he said there is there is the place where there is no computation whether you go to a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Church wherever it is if you are in Christ you are a new creature no cloud for the panel's say that if it wasn't true you believe all heard okay but one of these pictures interpretated it don't mean to us like I was telling a brother don't you realize it is the seed

they went along as we came that fool awake area but you know supposed to give up her hair back ornery Oh God listen no indeed the world okay until they came to a place with a blessed people holding amen and that rejected this message was blasphemy amen that's true amen you love the Lord and he said listen know where the Hashi you are Lucretia and there's no condemnation can you know where at all that's God's mini plane that's where God needs to worship that worshiper there is where you are counted a new creature and when they advance of the speed of the world they alive in him the living presence God is within them day by day he lives the appreciate every easy comes out my best but I thought the Holy Ghost was gold we are 2000 years ago militia you cannot leak on a higher hate hate

like everybody else Amen Jesus if I make it three week the rest go tell him no man I mean like you I rest a little rest upon his promise here that was given to me by the word he lives in a throttling everything to come to low down to the Bible when man be God's requirement comes into the place where he provides his written word for that big cosmic crime is that my tea God makes the person to be a new creature and he has no condemnation yeah Josh and I had to see Joel knew that his sacrifice calling him a maybe and maybe living as his friends Mina thought this I thought that I don't know but John stood there as a perfect man before God Jesus is up is the only provided way amen Debra had me now I look at these things and John said oh you know I'm not even worthy to unloose the lattice of

the great Church of the Living God will be raised like the wings of an eagle and packed out yonder in Rome T but we mustn't understand how what God is doing he said listen the church will come to justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the bastion of the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostals and go right on into perfection of the Son of man that when husband and
