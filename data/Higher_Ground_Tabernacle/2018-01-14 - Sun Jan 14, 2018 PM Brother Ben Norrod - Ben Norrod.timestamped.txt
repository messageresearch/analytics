[30:57] be praying for us we we just been
[31:03] searching for the direction of the Lord
[31:04] for this new year and we certainly want
[31:06] to be in God's will for this new year
[31:08] and along with the travelin and the
[31:11] preaching and the things like that comes
[31:14] a lot of new songs things that we try to
[31:17] put in as we travel and sing to the
[31:19] people and we found this one actually a
[31:21] sister in our church some time ago a
[31:23] cement that I would sing this one that
[31:25] took us a while to kindly get the
[31:27] inspiration for it and it's a very very
[31:29] simple song but I love the meaning of it
[31:31] it just simply says and I'm gonna read
[31:34] you just a line or two of the course
[31:35] that says I can pray until the walls
[31:37] come down I can pray until there's
[31:40] healing all around there's something
[31:43] that's something that I can do I can
[31:45] pray no matter what we are where we come
[31:48] from as Christians we all have that
[31:50] something about it in
[31:51] [Music]
[32:02] you say I'm not able or too young
[32:09] I'm too old I can't sing or preach a no
[32:15] titles you what can i tune for I want to
[32:23] do my palm and I want to help the
[32:27] hurting it's all of my I can pray until
[32:35] the walls come down till the ceiling all
[32:39] around that's something I can do my
[32:50] secret place calling on your name that's
[32:56] something I can do
[33:07] [Music]
[33:11] and my child is gone so far to reach
[33:17] them up and down till this evening all
[33:43] around that's something my friend you
[34:13] may not be a singer you may not be
[34:16] appreciate you may not be recognized in
[34:18] your local community but there's one
[34:20] thing that all of us born by the Spirit
[34:23] of God can do we can call on the lovely
[34:26] on the mighty on the holy name of Jesus
[34:29] yes we can
[34:32] [Music]
[34:47] [Music]
[34:56] that's something I do I can't
[35:02] [Music]
[35:06] hi
[35:09] [Music]
[35:10] [Applause]
[35:18] [Music]
[35:18] [Applause]
[35:28] raise the Lord amen to stand together
[35:32] tonight
[35:35] Amen wonderful songs with wonderful
[35:37] words to the songs and meanings to the
[35:40] songs and I believe there's something
[35:42] about song that's got power in it
[35:45] Amen I believe a song can bring healing
[35:48] sir can but the Remsen old downcast type
[35:52] spirit thank you brother
[35:53] that would be all upset and tore up what
[35:56] more he said but some good old gospel
[35:58] music he said a mammal caused everything
[36:00] to come right back up I mean it's got a
[36:02] healing unit ain't that right amen
[36:04] certainly as we said appreciated the
[36:07] service this morning and appreciated how
[36:09] the Lord spoke to us and I always
[36:12] counted a privilege I don't know how you
[36:14] feel about it but for me coming in the
[36:16] house of the Lord you know is something
[36:18] very very important and I think that
[36:20] maybe you know as some sons of God I
[36:24] think even more as we see the Day
[36:26] approaching that's when we should come
[36:28] to the house of God even more beyond
[36:30] that because as we said this morning
[36:32] talking about being cut on that's why
[36:35] we're here amen that Jesus can have the
[36:38] right away in our life and I I love him
[36:41] with all of my heart I want to say thank
[36:43] you to everybody for allowing us to come
[36:45] by always to brother Isaiah sister Ruby
[36:47] and we loved and been friends many many
[36:49] years and I was thinking about all these
[36:52] little kids come up now Krystal kind
[36:54] of--you all these little ones I'm Erin
[36:56] when y'all look like that man I'm not
[36:59] terribly old but I'm old enough to
[37:01] remember when I was a little girl and
[37:03] Krystal and I grew up together almost
[37:05] practically anytime and here we are I'm
[37:09] old she all the time that's where that
[37:11] goes but I just thank the Lord and I
[37:15] just believe God is he's a God of
[37:18] knowing everything I don't think there's
[37:20] nothing that he don't know and he saw
[37:23] this very moment in time for us it may
[37:25] be 40 years past 50 years past 30 years
[37:27] past but to God has just been a few
[37:29] moments just like that you know and he
[37:31] knew the very end from the beginning and
[37:33] then the Bible said he knew all things
[37:36] you know what struggles we'd have to go
[37:37] through in life what hardships we have
[37:39] to endure what troubles we'd see along
[37:41] the way but I'm so glad my only
[37:44] confidence of even standing here tonight
[37:46] and even daring to come preach the
[37:49] gospel whether it be to five people or
[37:50] 5,000 is the fact that God's got
[37:53] everything under control and if I didn't
[37:56] trust him I certainly wouldn't be here
[37:58] tonight amen I I just believe that hey
[38:01] man let's turn now to Genesis chapter 3
[38:03] verse 13 I want to if it will help us
[38:08] tonight excuse me I've got several
[38:12] things that I want to try to get into by
[38:15] the help of the Lord but more than
[38:16] anything I want to talk about divine
[38:19] healing and in order to get to the
[38:22] divine healing part I'm going to go
[38:24] through serpent seed and in a few these
[38:26] subjects and I'd like to kindly spend
[38:29] some time with this part about divine
[38:31] healing now I don't want you to get in
[38:34] your mind that divine healing is just
[38:36] simply for example some might think it's
[38:39] just the healing of the body but it's
[38:41] not it's more than that so actually the
[38:43] whole healing or as they say in the
[38:45] world today holistic healing which means
[38:47] all of us and there's a lot more that
[38:50] God wants to heal than just our bodies
[38:52] he wants to heal our minds and heal our
[38:54] spirits and heal our memories sometimes
[38:58] our memories get sick and sometimes all
[39:01] we can think of is just some old bad
[39:03] memories something it's happened to us a
[39:04] hundred years ago it wasn't and can't
[39:07] seem to get it off for mine and all that
[39:09] but I believe the Lord is a healer and I
[39:13] don't believe the New Testament made him
[39:14] a healer I believe he was a healer when
[39:16] he was God you say when he was God well
[39:19] he was always God so he's always been a
[39:21] healer hey that's right
[39:23] amen let's start Genesis chapter 3 verse
[39:26] 13 now I'm gonna drop his sister and you
[39:29] can bring it back up and salute if you'd
[39:30] like I know it's probably ringing maksim
[39:32] Genesis 3 verse 13 this cold weather
[39:36] does a number on my voice I'm going to
[39:37] tell you after about one service I'm
[39:39] just as hoarse as I can be now when the
[39:42] weather warms up I'm preach to you 20 in
[39:44] a row and not even squeak but as cold
[39:46] weather gets you a little bit so amen we
[39:49] sir
[39:49] they appreciate the Lord helping us
[39:51] anyhow now we want to go to the root we
[39:55] want to go to the stinker that caused
[39:57] all these problems in the beginning go
[39:59] right to the old devil we want to go to
[40:01] where the source of all this sickness
[40:03] and stuff come in at and we want to look
[40:06] now verse 13 and going through verse 16
[40:09] in verse 20 and I forgot to mention this
[40:11] morning greetings to all that watching
[40:13] and the youtubes and the different
[40:15] channels and things arranged here at the
[40:17] church we've been watching a little bit
[40:18] here and there some of the recent serves
[40:20] brother Vaughn and I'll got caught some
[40:22] of that a little bit and and tried not
[40:24] to listen anything here at the church
[40:26] because I wanted the Lord to lead me in
[40:27] the right direction so I didn't want to
[40:28] know nothing but I did listen it brother
[40:30] Vaughn a little bit I really enjoyed
[40:31] when I got to here and I like your new
[40:34] setup that's really a handy thing and
[40:35] it's real clear and here's real good on
[40:37] the on the broadcast out there and
[40:39] that's that's what you want people get
[40:41] the message get the message out that's
[40:43] that's the main thing so we greet
[40:45] everybody that's watching the message
[40:47] too and my prayer is not just here in
[40:49] this room but everybody will get it will
[40:51] receive divine healing amen and the Lord
[40:53] God said unto the woman what is this
[40:55] that thou hast done the woman said well
[40:58] the serpent handed me a basket full of
[41:00] apples and I ate them now today what the
[41:05] Bible said is it beguiled me the word
[41:08] beguiled here simply means to deceive
[41:11] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[41:13] because thou hast done this thou art
[41:16] cursed above all cattle above every
[41:20] beast of the field and upon thy belly
[41:22] shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat
[41:26] all the days of my life and I will put
[41:29] enmity between thee and the woman and
[41:31] between thy seed and her seed so the
[41:35] serpent did have a seed it shall bruise
[41:39] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[41:44] under the woman he said I will greatly
[41:47] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception I
[41:51] want you to notice carefully God
[41:53] punished this woman in the area she was
[41:57] guilty if she ate a fruit or a
[41:59] pomegranate or Apple or something like
[42:01] that he should have give her love Joe
[42:04] but God punished her in the area she was
[42:07] guilty
[42:07] where was she guilty at conception and
[42:10] sorrow and in sorrow thou shalt bring
[42:14] forth children thy desire shall be to
[42:17] thy husband and he shall rule over thee
[42:21] that unsound brain women's lib in the
[42:23] 21st century 2018 but this is still
[42:25] God's Liam if that makes sense
[42:28] amen amen verse 20 now and I really want
[42:31] to focus on this last verse so once you
[42:33] pay attention to the way the Bible
[42:35] phrases this the springs and everything
[42:36] we want to talk about an Adam called his
[42:38] wife's name Eve because she was the
[42:42] mother of all living
[42:44] so not just the mother of children but
[42:48] she would give birth to every disease
[42:50] germ she would give birth to every
[42:52] backslidden cancer cell she would give
[42:54] birth to everything if it has a life she
[42:57] would give birth to it it would come
[42:59] through the channel this woman here amen
[43:01] let's let's pray together over the word
[43:03] father thank you Lord for the
[43:05] opportunity to come into your place I
[43:07] pray you'd bless this word and help us
[43:09] receive from it in Jesus name Amen god
[43:13] bless you may be seated
[43:15] now let me read to you from Lester's
[43:17] called fellowship through reconciliation
[43:21] brother Branham says in the beginning
[43:23] when God made man in his own image he
[43:25] put him in the Garden of Eden he had
[43:27] perfect fellowship the late afternoon
[43:30] the evening time when the twilights was
[43:33] falling I can see the great Jehovah come
[43:36] across the top of the palm trees the
[43:39] roaring of the Thunder and Adam and Eve
[43:41] gathered out there in the great open-air
[43:43] Cathedral and worship God they had
[43:46] fellowship and talked with him the lion
[43:49] and the tiger
[43:50] all coming around he said it was perfect
[43:52] harmony wouldn't that be a wonderful
[43:55] place to live he says Amen abiding place
[43:58] where there is no sickness where there
[44:00] is no sorrow no way of ever being upset
[44:03] he said everything just in perfect
[44:05] harmony God in harmony with his creature
[44:08] and the creature in harmony with his
[44:11] maker
[44:12] what a perfect time a complete
[44:15] fellowship and
[44:17] that's the way God intended it now just
[44:20] reading from this statement focusing on
[44:22] this statement a moment you can see wine
[44:25] that when this great thing would strike
[44:28] in the Garden of Eden excuse me you
[44:30] would see the the elements of perfection
[44:33] the elements of the harmony between God
[44:36] and is creation when they're broken you
[44:40] can see how that Satan would then move
[44:44] into this place of perfection and slowly
[44:47] pervert little piece by little piece all
[44:49] that God created in here and you can see
[44:52] the harmony and everything how that that
[44:54] must have made the devil so mad to think
[44:57] that there's harmony that everything is
[44:59] going just right here he is with the
[45:01] desire to be like God wanting to Kingdom
[45:03] want and subjects wanting people want
[45:05] all of this and here's God got the
[45:07] perfect Church and so here comes the
[45:10] devil to ruin the perfect Church that's
[45:11] usually the way it goes
[45:13] Satan has always been against harmony
[45:16] between man and God when he sees you in
[45:18] harmony with God he'll do the same thing
[45:19] to you try to disrupt that harmony by
[45:22] coming in and little by little strip
[45:23] away what you have amen to break it's
[45:25] such a dreadful thing to come to church
[45:28] a dreadful thing to read the Bible a
[45:30] terrible thing to try to serve the Lord
[45:32] that's the way Satan likes to interrupt
[45:34] you aim and get you in a feeling of
[45:36] coming to church and somehow after he
[45:38] works on your life your chair your pew
[45:41] don't fit like it used to amen and
[45:43] everything seems to sing a little bit
[45:44] louder a little bit softer something
[45:47] just not right all the time
[45:48] well that's the way the devil likes to
[45:50] do disrupt harmony by introducing this
[45:53] ideology of you know that that there's
[45:55] more out there or there's something
[45:58] greater than what God could offer us and
[46:00] that's still his plan that's his tactic
[46:02] even to this state where he tries to
[46:04] make a manifestation of of a greater
[46:07] kingdom of a greater life of a greater
[46:10] something you know between man and the
[46:13] world better than what God can offer you
[46:16] take a young girl maybe and he'll offer
[46:18] to her the beauties of the world and the
[46:21] delicacies of the world and offer her
[46:24] popularity and offer her friendship with
[46:26] the world and what more I meant trying
[46:28] to let her see that it's so much greater
[46:30] out there
[46:31] than it is serving God under that humble
[46:33] atmosphere of just living a Christian
[46:35] life and he always tries to project
[46:37] things outside of the word as being
[46:39] greater than what they really are a man
[46:42] you see here in this little church and
[46:44] and no doubt the Devils start working on
[46:46] your mind well if we had this if we had
[46:48] that if we had such-and-such if this
[46:50] would happen if that would happen oh how
[46:52] much more spiritual I would be well what
[46:54] that is that's the devil trying to
[46:57] disrupt harmony between you and Almighty
[46:59] God the fact the matter is you can have
[47:01] the greatest musicians in the planet
[47:03] sitting on the platform you can have the
[47:05] biggest high payers in the world sitting
[47:06] in this church but if you're miserable
[47:08] then ain't going to help you be less
[47:10] miserable amen if you're not serving God
[47:12] and ain't going to help you get closer
[47:13] to God what you are is what you are and
[47:15] whatever state you're in that's what you
[47:17] usually are
[47:18] amen not even death can change what kind
[47:20] of person you are so bigger church more
[47:23] people and all that kind of thing that
[47:24] doesn't change us but that's the devil's
[47:26] tactic try to get people looking in a
[47:29] direction and looking in a way of oh the
[47:31] grass is always greener ah and things
[47:34] are always better if and that's the way
[47:36] it is sometimes in a man's marriage I'd
[47:38] be married to a beautiful woman she
[47:40] loves him she takes care of him
[47:42] whatever more but then the devil will
[47:43] turn his eyes and divert his eyes off to
[47:46] another woman that does different things
[47:49] and you'll think well my wife don't do
[47:50] that well my wife don't act that way
[47:52] well my wife and they think well if I
[47:54] could live with her I could have
[47:56] everything I wanted when they find out
[47:58] that they move on in the grass isn't as
[48:01] green as they thought it was a man if I
[48:03] could say it that way it's just the
[48:05] human life all over again but that's the
[48:07] devil's job paint a picture and make it
[48:10] look so beautiful that it would deceive
[48:12] the very elect that if it was possible
[48:14] to deceive me elective he's always done
[48:16] that way painted a picture now he does
[48:18] the same thing of course as we've
[48:20] studied here as believers of this
[48:22] message many times in the Garden of Eden
[48:24] he paints this picture to Eve that God
[48:27] somehow is hiding something from her you
[48:30] know somehow she's not achieving
[48:33] everything that she needs to achieve and
[48:35] she isn't coming up to everything she
[48:37] needs to come up to and and of course
[48:39] the devil kindly will works on her with
[48:42] her feminine look and her feminine type
[48:44] characteristics and here brother Brown
[48:47] say that you know he took her by the
[48:49] hand and said now Eve look at this
[48:51] dainty little hand of yours
[48:52] look at your features and how much more
[48:55] beautiful you are than Adam he said look
[48:57] at all of the creation of God look at
[49:00] the the buck doe the buck deer rather
[49:03] and then the humble doe and look how
[49:04] beautiful and strong he is and how
[49:07] humble she is but look at you Eve you're
[49:09] the exact opposite of everything God's
[49:11] made you're the pretty one and Adams the
[49:13] humble one don't you think maybe God's
[49:15] hiding a little something from you now
[49:18] Satan knew if he could get to this woman
[49:20] that she would be the bedding ground of
[49:22] all life that means that everything God
[49:25] had created he could bring through the
[49:27] channel of this woman and through the
[49:29] channel of this woman he could pervert
[49:31] out anything God had done now remember
[49:34] when they were created they were created
[49:36] in the image of God spirit man and woman
[49:39] first and then he creates him in the
[49:41] image of the animals that they were
[49:43] going to rule over he said in the flesh
[49:45] Adam had hands like a monkey he had feet
[49:47] like a bear but in spirit in soul he was
[49:50] created after the image of God and we
[49:53] know that Adam Genesis 1:26 he said let
[49:56] us make man in our own image that was
[49:59] not the image of a man or a flesh but
[50:01] that was the image of spirit so Adam was
[50:03] made in spirit first and then his soul
[50:06] or his spirit and all of that was placed
[50:09] into a body and it was representative of
[50:11] those he would rule over so he was going
[50:14] to be a God of the earth so God made him
[50:16] a a a being that kindly related with all
[50:20] types of creation and what more he was
[50:22] going to represent look friends there is
[50:24] a reason why that they think the
[50:26] chimpanzee and the man are so close
[50:28] together
[50:29] God made him in a way that he would
[50:31] represent those he was going to rule
[50:33] over amen but two thirds actually I
[50:35] should say four thousand years later two
[50:37] thousand years ago the Lord Jesus done
[50:40] the same thing he came down into Satan's
[50:42] Eden he took on a form of the subjects
[50:45] he was going to rule over a man a man he
[50:47] became one of us a man that he could
[50:49] take on an image to show us that he was
[50:52] going to be our Lord our second man Adam
[50:54] so the devil creates this picture and
[50:56] Eve falls for it
[50:59] the hard thing friends as a preacher
[51:02] I've been going on this summer be 27
[51:04] years for me the hard thing is a
[51:07] preacher around the world is to see
[51:09] people fall for the lies of the devil it
[51:12] hurts just too bad you can't stand it
[51:14] you know the devil's gonna lie you know
[51:15] you're gonna say things and do things
[51:17] but to see people fall for it it tears
[51:20] you all to pieces sometimes to see them
[51:22] fall into situations that you know if
[51:24] they'll just resist the devil he'll flee
[51:27] away from them but then to listen to the
[51:29] thing it hurts you so bad you can't
[51:31] stand because she realized that once
[51:33] Satan just gets a little seed planted in
[51:36] there he's got a whole garden in mind
[51:38] when he's planting seeds
[51:40] don't forget the devil don't plant a
[51:42] garden he don't plant a seed without
[51:44] expecting a garden to come forth
[51:45] eventually here he is in the Garden of
[51:49] Eden well what better place to plant
[51:50] seeds in the garden so he plants the
[51:53] seed of discrepancy in this woman now I
[51:56] want you to notice this in Genesis the
[51:59] second chapter now going back a whole
[52:01] chapter there verse 16 let's just
[52:05] observe this for just a moment remember
[52:06] God in His Harmony God is perfection
[52:09] everything was perfect harmony and the
[52:11] devil is seeking to disrupt this now
[52:13] we're gonna try to start at the
[52:15] foundation I want to bring you along for
[52:17] a little while into this divine healing
[52:18] Genesis 2:16 and the Lord God commanded
[52:23] the man saying of every tree of the
[52:26] garden thou mayest freely eat but of the
[52:30] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[52:32] thou shalt not eat of it from the day
[52:34] that thou eatest therefore thou shalt
[52:37] surely die and in the day the Lord God
[52:40] said that he said it's not good that man
[52:42] should be alone I will make him a help
[52:44] meet for him and out of the ground the
[52:47] Lord God formed every beast of the field
[52:50] every fowl of the air and brought him to
[52:52] Adam to see what he would call there
[52:54] whatsoever Adam called every living
[52:55] creature that was the name thereof now
[52:58] we watch here as Adam begins to move in
[53:00] to this type of ministry where he was
[53:03] saying and calling what God would call
[53:05] the animals his mind was a direct
[53:08] connection with the mind of God and as
[53:10] he would call an animal that's exactly
[53:12] the way God
[53:12] would have identified that animal calls
[53:14] him lion calls him cheetah calls him
[53:16] bear calls in Turkey whatever he calls
[53:18] him calls him sheep calls him gorilla
[53:21] every what it was that was what God was
[53:23] communicating through his mind to Adam
[53:25] now Adam is the god of the earth and he
[53:28] cannot be deceived there's no way that
[53:30] he can fall because he is a direct
[53:32] descendant hallelujah from Almighty God
[53:35] but the woman is made out of the
[53:37] continuity of the and the devil is
[53:41] watching God's continuity and he
[53:43] realizes uh-oh God made a boo-boo see
[53:47] the things Satan never does figure out
[53:49] is it usually when it looks like God's
[53:52] making a mistake that's just because
[53:54] he's dumbing it down for the devil to
[53:56] pounce on it yeah so that way when the
[54:00] devil gets a hold of it then all kinds
[54:02] of things can be expressed out of God
[54:04] after Satan gets ahold of this woman
[54:07] remember he's Redeemer
[54:08] he's lover he's savior he's father he's
[54:10] all these things but he cannot express
[54:13] not of that until the devil gets ahold
[54:15] of this woman he's also a healer but it
[54:20] can't heal if ain't nothing sick he
[54:23] can't heal if nothing broken the way he
[54:25] can do it is allow Satan to move in and
[54:27] disrupt this harmony and so he makes the
[54:31] woman in a way that she can be deceived
[54:33] hey man yeah I know sis you're a little
[54:38] bit outnumbered tonight but we're not
[54:39] picking on you that's for sure man amen
[54:41] that's right but this is what the Bible
[54:43] said you know there's a certain
[54:45] gentleman some time ago he just recently
[54:47] left the message he got quite upset
[54:48] because brother BAM said that the woman
[54:50] was like scrap material she was scrapped
[54:53] well that's what brother BAM was trying
[54:54] to show that she wasn't brought out of
[54:56] the ground like everything else was she
[54:57] was taken from the man it was a scrap
[55:01] piece it didn't mean that she was
[55:02] garbage
[55:03] hey the prophet of God said she's the
[55:04] most beautiful woman ever created that
[55:06] don't sound like garbage to me but she
[55:09] was made in the continuity in a way that
[55:11] Satan can move to her now he knows that
[55:15] somehow another this woman is the key to
[55:19] disrupting God's continuity now whether
[55:22] Adam would realize that or not or
[55:23] whether God would reveal it to him while
[55:25] he was still under the
[55:26] this holy veil and in this perfection
[55:29] whether he recognized what the devil was
[55:31] doing we may not know but we do know
[55:34] that when she presents her body to Adam
[55:36] and says this is what the serpent taught
[55:39] me this is what I learned and I want to
[55:41] give that to you you're made just like
[55:44] he is
[55:44] and I enjoyed sexual desire with him and
[55:47] I want to enjoy it with you you're my
[55:48] husband
[55:49] the Bible said he partook and eat of the
[55:52] tree now something I want you to
[55:53] recognize out of the ground the Lord God
[55:57] made to grow all the beasts of the field
[55:59] or it was Adam taken out of the ground
[56:02] where it was the serpent taken out of
[56:04] the ground so apart remember a part of
[56:08] the continuity of God was not just the
[56:10] woman but the ground as well there was a
[56:14] reason that God took these creatures out
[56:17] of the earth remember the earth is a
[56:19] spoken-word scene of God the earth can
[56:22] never be destroyed don't ever get in
[56:24] your mind that God is gonna take this
[56:25] earth away and put it in there anew
[56:26] there ain't no new earth he's gonna
[56:28] renovate this planet even maybe that's
[56:30] why we like renovation brother Troy we
[56:32] acting like our daddy gay man a man
[56:34] who's gonna renovate the earth all of
[56:36] the iron ore all the chemicals are gonna
[56:38] be burnt right back down to the core and
[56:40] God's gonna rebuild this or back to its
[56:42] former beauty it's won't even be even
[56:44] more beautiful than that because there's
[56:45] gonna be a new heavens and a new earth
[56:46] set on it amen a new city set on the new
[56:50] earth so Satan knows now watch this
[56:54] carefully that if he can get to this
[56:57] woman that if somehow he can get to her
[57:02] if Adam came from the ground then he
[57:05] realized they need the ground to live of
[57:07] the fruit of the trees thou mayest
[57:10] freely eat somehow there's a connection
[57:14] between their food and their life so
[57:20] Satanist doesn't start working on this
[57:22] woman after he causes her to fall but
[57:25] the earth is directly affected as well
[57:28] remember how I wish we could take time
[57:30] and read this remember the Bible said
[57:31] very quickly I talked about how that it
[57:33] bring forth thorns and thistles when she
[57:36] falls the earth as affected as in the
[57:38] same way and
[57:39] the reason that that's important when we
[57:41] come to divine healing in a moment
[57:42] you'll see how that works now that just
[57:45] said just to cover the part of serpent
[57:46] seed about what this is now we know that
[57:48] the fruit of the womb the fruit of the
[57:50] womb is actually children bringing forth
[57:53] children she didn't bring forth little
[57:54] pomegranate since she didn't give birth
[57:56] a little bananas she gave birth to kids
[57:58] now if somebody would ask the question
[58:01] then why did Jesus have to be virgin
[58:04] born well that answers why what took
[58:08] place in the Garden of Eden that's the
[58:09] answer to it the fact that Jesus had to
[58:12] be virgin born proved it was more than
[58:15] eating a pomegranate in the Garden of
[58:16] Eden if Jesus would have been born
[58:20] through sex he'd had come the same
[58:21] program we came and we still be in sin
[58:24] right here today he wouldn't have been
[58:26] the virgin born son of God but because
[58:28] he was virgin born Jesus was born above
[58:31] the fall he was born above sex desire
[58:34] God said the day you eat that's the day
[58:36] you die he was born above that
[58:41] watch carefully Luke chapter 1 verse 42
[58:45] when I write this down
[58:46] he said the fruit of the womb Hosea 9 16
[58:50] fruit of the womb Isaiah 13 18 fruit of
[58:54] the womb he's just a few samplings of a
[58:56] hundred other scriptures I could give
[58:57] you Psalm 127:3 fruit of the womb do
[59:01] drop his seven thirteen fruit of the
[59:03] womb Genesis 30 and two fruit of the
[59:06] womb so children were a product of this
[59:11] fall in the Garden of Eden now watch
[59:14] when he becomes the mother of all living
[59:19] whatever she gives birth to it's gonna
[59:24] have this type of life inside of it when
[59:29] Eve falls in the Garden of Eden and
[59:31] gives birth to Cain what was Cain he was
[59:35] hybrid in one place the prophet of God
[59:38] called him a mongrel and a half-breed
[59:41] because remember the serpent was a man
[59:43] but he was also close enough to the
[59:45] animal kingdom that he could stand as a
[59:47] missing link between the two so there
[59:50] were parts of his cells that were not
[59:52] ordained of God
[59:53] mix with the woman although they could
[59:55] and by cross pollenization if you will
[1:00:00] and crossbreeding or high breeding the
[1:00:02] serpent and Eve it done something to the
[1:00:05] cells of humanity and member in this day
[1:00:08] that we live in there is no more natural
[1:00:10] serpents II that's all been blended
[1:00:12] together at one time the lines were
[1:00:14] separable when the sons of God Genesis
[1:00:16] six saw the daughters of men that they
[1:00:18] were fair they took in and then women
[1:00:19] our wives and then they blended those
[1:00:21] two lines together so we're all mixed up
[1:00:23] sitting here tonight with everything
[1:00:25] they just have to have your part this
[1:00:28] and part that and part together you're
[1:00:30] like a souffle with so many parts of the
[1:00:31] recipe you're not even sure what what
[1:00:33] the what the dish is called
[1:00:34] a man all we know is maybe black skin or
[1:00:38] white skin or yellow skin or red skin or
[1:00:40] ever what it might be hey but we're
[1:00:43] we're living in a body that has been
[1:00:46] developed by years six thousand years of
[1:00:50] crossbreeding and hybridization causes
[1:01:00] her cells with the serpent do you
[1:01:04] realize at that moment that's when cells
[1:01:07] begin to degenerate every cell began to
[1:01:11] fall now because God had perfection laid
[1:01:13] out here and because everything was in
[1:01:15] his perfect way sometimes man would live
[1:01:18] to be 969 years old but he never lived
[1:01:22] out a thousand because God promised the
[1:01:24] day you eat of is the day you die
[1:01:25] there's never been a man live a thousand
[1:01:27] years we will in the Millennium we will
[1:01:31] in the millennium time we will live out
[1:01:32] a thousand years to do what prove the
[1:01:34] curses off the proof ha that's been
[1:01:38] washed away but no man's live but they
[1:01:41] had strength they had strengthened their
[1:01:43] bodies strengthened their food because
[1:01:44] it was more pure but after six thousand
[1:01:48] years of high breeding what's happened a
[1:01:50] man's life spans down to fifty years
[1:01:53] could you imagine if we were sitting
[1:01:55] here tonight Noah ham Shem and Japheth
[1:01:59] Jacob and some of them it lived one
[1:02:01] hundred ninety seven years old four
[1:02:04] hundred and eighty seven years three
[1:02:06] hundred and forty
[1:02:07] I don't think it was dog years I think
[1:02:08] it meant years years I mean could you
[1:02:13] imagine some of the men sitting there
[1:02:14] looking around this room that I here you
[1:02:17] are by halfway bald-headed oh how old
[1:02:19] are you better be in one movie forty-one
[1:02:21] years old
[1:02:22] my goodness sakes life why I didn't
[1:02:25] start losing my hair till I was three
[1:02:27] hundred and eighty seven years old what
[1:02:29] is it our bodies are beginning to
[1:02:31] degenerate even more and more rapidly as
[1:02:33] we see the Day approaching our bodies
[1:02:36] are coming down to where brother brems
[1:02:37] said we ain't nothing but a bunch of us
[1:02:39] forgive me maybe that's what's left of
[1:02:42] us ain't nothing more than that now
[1:02:44] watch here in second Corinthians chapter
[1:02:45] 11 verse 1 2 and 3 now let's just take a
[1:02:48] couple verses here and just I want to
[1:02:50] talk about what happened here in the
[1:02:51] Garden of Eden for just a moment because
[1:02:53] it's very important to what we want to
[1:02:55] get to all right sacrum is eleven one
[1:02:57] two and three would to God you bear with
[1:02:59] me a little of my folly and indeed bear
[1:03:00] with me he said for I'm jealous over you
[1:03:03] with a godly jealousy for I've espoused
[1:03:05] you to one husband that I may present
[1:03:07] you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I
[1:03:11] fear lest by any means as the serpent
[1:03:14] beguiled Eve through his subtilty so
[1:03:19] your minds should be corrupted from the
[1:03:22] simplicity that is in Christ as Paul
[1:03:25] here identifying how that Satan can not
[1:03:28] only pervert the mind but how he also
[1:03:31] perverted Eve's thinking as he said I
[1:03:34] don't want the devil twisting your mind
[1:03:36] like he twisted her mind
[1:03:37] remember the grass is always greener on
[1:03:39] the other side here's a woman in a
[1:03:42] perfect Church and yet the devil trying
[1:03:44] to trying to prove to her that God was
[1:03:45] hiding something from her well you could
[1:03:48] be a gaudy she already was he realized
[1:03:52] she had just as much power as Adam had
[1:03:53] she's Coleco with the rumor she didn't
[1:03:56] come subordinate to him until after the
[1:03:58] fall mm-hmm we talked about how Adams
[1:04:02] stood out there and could have spoke to
[1:04:04] a tree and moved it over there Eve could
[1:04:05] too she had the same Authority the same
[1:04:08] power that Adam had we talked about how
[1:04:10] Adam would have stopped the breeze he
[1:04:12] could have done it the difference was
[1:04:15] she was letting her husband be the boss
[1:04:18] well hallelujah
[1:04:20] at least blink got me sister it ain't
[1:04:22] gonna hurt nothin god absolutely set the
[1:04:28] whole thing in perfect harmony
[1:04:30] she had power he had power and the devil
[1:04:33] told this woman there's greener grass
[1:04:36] over yonder you could be a God knowing
[1:04:38] good and evil
[1:04:38] she what was right she knew what was
[1:04:40] wrong she'd heard everything there was
[1:04:43] because she quoted it back to the devil
[1:04:44] we may eat of the free to the the fruit
[1:04:47] of the trees rather of the garden but of
[1:04:48] the fruit that's in the midst of the
[1:04:50] garden we're not allowed to touch it or
[1:04:51] eat it lest we die well she knew what
[1:04:55] was right and yet the devil convinced
[1:04:59] her somehow God was hiding something I
[1:05:00] wonder if that wakes our brain up to
[1:05:03] thank for this a little bit sometimes
[1:05:04] the devil tells us lies and we chase
[1:05:06] after him oh it's going to be this way
[1:05:08] it's going to be that way oh I'll tell
[1:05:10] you this that the other we chase after
[1:05:11] the thing instead of praying about it to
[1:05:13] see if it's the will of God in the first
[1:05:14] place
[1:05:15] wonder how different the picture would
[1:05:17] have been if she said hold on serpent
[1:05:19] let me go talk to my husband a moment
[1:05:20] see what this all about
[1:05:21] a minute would solve the problem look
[1:05:24] here first Timothy chapter 2 verse 13
[1:05:26] first Timothy chapter 2 13 14 for Adam
[1:05:29] was first formed then Eve Adam was not
[1:05:32] deceived oh you say you're a woman hater
[1:05:36] I'm just reading you what the Bible said
[1:05:38] is what the Bible said but the woman
[1:05:42] being deceived was in the transgression
[1:05:44] why she was going to be the mother of
[1:05:46] all living
[1:05:49] cancers a living organism tuberculosis
[1:05:53] is a living organism look at it in our
[1:05:55] microscopes even in a living figure
[1:05:57] she's going to become the mother of all
[1:05:59] living
[1:06:00] everything that could be passed she was
[1:06:02] going to give birth to it and Satan had
[1:06:05] enough brains to know that Adam was
[1:06:07] gonna be the one Bassett he might have
[1:06:09] had to see but he didn't have the
[1:06:11] bedding ground like she had she had the
[1:06:13] ability to either produce good or to
[1:06:16] produce bad and hang on she not only did
[1:06:18] that she produced good and evil she
[1:06:21] produced both of them first John chapter
[1:06:24] 3 verse 10 11 and 12 let's turn there
[1:06:27] for a moment first John 3 verse 10 11 12
[1:06:30] oh you saw all brother being now come on
[1:06:33] I wasn't a dev on the garden of eat it
[1:06:34] well hold on a minute let's see if it
[1:06:35] was or not first John chapter 3 verse 10
[1:06:43] in this the children of God are manifest
[1:06:46] and the children of the devil hmm
[1:06:56] interesting
[1:06:57] rather Keith if there are children of
[1:07:01] God and if there are children of the
[1:07:03] devil all right take me in the Bible to
[1:07:06] where the father showed up it's only one
[1:07:11] place you can go to find the father's
[1:07:13] book of Genesis as they don't have the
[1:07:17] mystery Jeremih I don't have it
[1:07:19] nahum habakkuk hosea joel amos ain't
[1:07:24] none of got the answer Esther that's her
[1:07:26] own story Ruth that's her own story
[1:07:28] they nowhere else in the Bible not
[1:07:29] Matthew Mark Luke John on any of the
[1:07:31] appalling letters not one place you go
[1:07:33] on the entire New Testament scripture to
[1:07:35] show me where the children of God and
[1:07:36] the children of the devil ever showed up
[1:07:38] at but the book of Genesis right back
[1:07:40] here with them two daddies in the
[1:07:41] beginning the fact that people can't see
[1:07:44] that it shows they don't want to see cuz
[1:07:46] right there it is in front of their eyes
[1:07:47] she becomes the mother of all living was
[1:07:51] Satan a living being yes he was Satan
[1:07:54] was going to father through that woman
[1:07:55] the the hybridization that would tear
[1:07:59] down every blood cell why the cells
[1:08:01] backslide and cancer get into them right
[1:08:03] there right now there's an order for a
[1:08:10] the backslide has got to die and Satan
[1:08:14] loves to dwell and dead things that's
[1:08:17] why the maniac of gonorrhea was hiding
[1:08:18] in the tombs because brother brems he
[1:08:20] loves to run deaf I told her young man
[1:08:22] in Nicaragua one time he come up one to
[1:08:24] receive the Holy Ghost he had a skull
[1:08:25] ring on his finger I said take that ring
[1:08:27] off you may get to hold it
[1:08:29] I think God's not a God of the Dead is a
[1:08:31] God of the living amen that's exactly
[1:08:35] right now watch it for this is the
[1:08:37] message you've heard from the beginning
[1:08:38] that we should love one another not as
[1:08:41] Cain
[1:08:42] oh well John was said same idea I did he
[1:08:45] went right back to the book of Genesis
[1:08:46] did I not as Cain who was of that wicked
[1:08:52] one well how in the world did the devil
[1:08:57] figure that happen he's that smart
[1:08:59] number one and he understands watching
[1:09:02] the continuity of God he watched how God
[1:09:04] done the thing in the beginning he saw
[1:09:06] how Satan he saw how excuse me he's
[1:09:09] Satan rather saw how God had a perfect
[1:09:11] continuity had perfect harmony back
[1:09:13] yonder in the Garden of Eden and the
[1:09:15] devil sat back on the ends of the earth
[1:09:16] saying how can I mess that up I want to
[1:09:20] be God I want to have my own people I
[1:09:23] want to set up my own Kingdom I want
[1:09:24] people to worship me and I we have an
[1:09:27] expression back home I'll be a monkey's
[1:09:29] uncle
[1:09:29] y'all say I'm gonna let the dangle let
[1:09:33] God get that kind of glory so how can I
[1:09:35] mess it up and then he sees the woman he
[1:09:40] sees the buck deer he sees all the mail
[1:09:42] in the in the animal kingdom he says
[1:09:46] every one of them are beautiful the
[1:09:47] little humble female and they takes a
[1:09:49] look at what God did with Adam and Eve
[1:09:51] remember her name wasn't even need yet
[1:09:53] her name was Adam
[1:09:55] she wasn't even called Eve until after
[1:09:57] the fall come on somebody takes one look
[1:10:00] at and he realizes ha something's out of
[1:10:03] the continuity of God pick it up in the
[1:10:07] book of Romans and we know exactly what
[1:10:09] it is the the clay cannot say back to
[1:10:10] the Potter why did you make me this way
[1:10:12] it's very simple he made her that way so
[1:10:16] she could be deceived I'm gonna take it
[1:10:18] a step further I hope this don't knock
[1:10:20] you out of your chair but brother BAM
[1:10:21] said she was predestinated to be
[1:10:22] deceived
[1:10:24] God purposed her whole life was to be
[1:10:27] predestinated that she would fall in the
[1:10:29] Garden of Eden so all of this could be
[1:10:31] expressed out of God amen and it's
[1:10:34] something my not as Cain who said that
[1:10:37] wicked one I watch her in Saint John
[1:10:38] chapter 8 verse 39 i watch this I like
[1:10:43] this one of my favorite scriptures here
[1:10:45] in the Saint John 8 people think I'm a
[1:10:47] hard preacher they need to read your
[1:10:49] Bible
[1:10:50] the answer to sending them Abraham as
[1:10:52] our Father Jesus said if you were
[1:10:54] Abraham's children you'd do the works of
[1:10:58] Abraham all those kids were they if they
[1:11:03] didn't belong to Abraham who were they
[1:11:04] and I remember these people could prove
[1:11:06] their pedigree these people could go
[1:11:09] back in the in generations and say hey
[1:11:11] my great-great-great great-great-great
[1:11:14] great-great-great great-great
[1:11:15] great-great granddaddy was Ali bhai my
[1:11:18] great-great great-great I belong to the
[1:11:20] tribe of Benjamin right here's my name
[1:11:23] search it if you want to go back
[1:11:25] hundreds of years
[1:11:26] it was here for you us he said before
[1:11:29] Abraham was I am crazy he spent so much
[1:11:37] time out there on the Raby and sons
[1:11:38] brain is burnt out where Abraham's
[1:11:42] children
[1:11:43] he said if use Abraham's children you do
[1:11:45] his works well as Abraham's works he
[1:11:48] believed God and it was imputed unto him
[1:11:49] for righteousness
[1:11:50] looking at the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:11:53] he called that which is not and said
[1:11:55] God's gonna give us a child in hell Amen
[1:11:58] that's right but now you seek - in other
[1:12:01] words you looked at the uncie you looked
[1:12:02] at that sit on the flesh we looked and
[1:12:04] see but now you seek to kill me a man
[1:12:06] that's told you the truth which I have
[1:12:07] heard of God this did not Abraham you do
[1:12:10] the deeds of your father they said unto
[1:12:12] him we're not born in fornication we
[1:12:14] have one father even God Jesus said in
[1:12:17] them if God we're your father you would
[1:12:18] love me for I proceeded forth and came
[1:12:21] from God neither came by myself but he
[1:12:24] that sent me why do you not understand
[1:12:26] my speech even because you cannot hear
[1:12:28] my word
[1:12:30] ye are of your father
[1:12:40] the definition of this word father in
[1:12:42] the Greek is pates er which means to be
[1:12:46] the originator and the transmitter of a
[1:12:49] family spirit as a father I past nor odd
[1:12:55] genes to my daughters
[1:12:56] I passed the nor odd spirit over to my
[1:13:00] daughters don't think so no it is just
[1:13:01] in their their look of their nose and
[1:13:03] their ears and all that that they they
[1:13:05] follow the characteristics even how I
[1:13:06] behaved I passed down to them more than
[1:13:10] just my flesh I passed down to my
[1:13:11] behavior I passed in I mean how is it
[1:13:14] that I can lay in the bed okay and I
[1:13:17] wake up in the morning the first thing I
[1:13:19] do when I wake up in the mornings I
[1:13:20] stretch my right leg and stick my right
[1:13:22] arm up in the air like yeah how is it I
[1:13:23] can walk by my daughter's bedroom door
[1:13:26] and she's stretching that right leg and
[1:13:27] sticking that right arm up I didn't
[1:13:30] teach her to do that
[1:13:31] she's in or odd she don't have just nor
[1:13:34] our genes in her she's got a nor odd
[1:13:36] spirit in her over to God
[1:13:39] same thing Jesus is saying you of your
[1:13:41] father the devil in other words not only
[1:13:43] do you look like him but you've got his
[1:13:45] spirit on the inside
[1:13:48] hallelujah somebody
[1:13:51] everything locked up in him that's why
[1:13:53] they behave and think like the devil cuz
[1:13:56] they got the devil spirit in them
[1:13:58] how does Satan become a father he found
[1:14:01] a bedding ground he found a vehicle he
[1:14:05] could use to pass his jeans on naturally
[1:14:09] Cain was genetically born from the
[1:14:12] serpent but spiritually came was the son
[1:14:17] of the devil because spiritually it was
[1:14:20] the devil fathering a child through the
[1:14:22] natural man the serpent oh it was a man
[1:14:25] sure he was a man well somebody said he
[1:14:28] was a beast I don't what brother brems
[1:14:29] said he said he was a man
[1:14:30] hybrid religion are we called a
[1:14:32] condemnation my representation November
[1:14:34] of 1960 look it up he said the serpent
[1:14:36] wasn't a monkey he wasn't a reptile he
[1:14:38] said it wasn't a black person he said
[1:14:40] they're just as ignorant as they can be
[1:14:41] the serpent was a man that's the only
[1:14:43] thing that could mix with that woman but
[1:14:46] it was close enough that he had a
[1:14:49] hybridized party was close enough to the
[1:14:51] animals close enough to the man that
[1:14:52] when them cells crossed over not only
[1:14:55] did he
[1:14:55] Satan moves spiritually into that end of
[1:14:58] that boy but also naturally them
[1:15:00] perverted cells cross right on over to
[1:15:02] us she's the mother of all living
[1:15:07] what if it be that the author of that
[1:15:10] family can transmit his spirit or infuse
[1:15:12] his spirit into others govern their
[1:15:16] behavior when we talk about divine
[1:15:19] healing when we talk about needing
[1:15:20] what's the first thing the doctor does
[1:15:22] when you go in the office
[1:15:25] family history anybody else in your
[1:15:27] family had diabetes
[1:15:29] you might else you have family had heart
[1:15:30] trouble they want to know cuz they got
[1:15:33] enough brains to know it passes down
[1:15:34] from generation to generation
[1:15:37] well if heart trouble passes from your
[1:15:39] great-granddaddy down to you what about
[1:15:40] that stubborn spirit what about that
[1:15:43] temper
[1:15:45] remember the prophet of God said the
[1:15:47] reason that you're a rock-and-roll
[1:15:48] striptease talking about the girl that
[1:15:50] would live in moral it said because your
[1:15:52] mammy was a flapper and your grandma was
[1:15:54] a chorus girl but the band said one
[1:15:59] place that the mother's spirit on that
[1:16:01] baby makes an imprint on the life of
[1:16:03] that child you don't think it's so look
[1:16:05] at how Jacob when he striped the sticks
[1:16:06] and then cows looked in the water were
[1:16:08] pregnant its striped them cows people
[1:16:11] say you can't mark a child the bible
[1:16:12] doesn't say that the bible said you
[1:16:13] could so if a woman's a holy woman she's
[1:16:19] a righteous woman she can leave a
[1:16:20] righteous imprint upon her children what
[1:16:24] the Bible said right look here in Exodus
[1:16:27] chapter 34 verse 7 now we know what a
[1:16:29] demon is or a demon or a devil that's a
[1:16:32] tormentor of course but now looking at
[1:16:35] this how that it it moves into the realm
[1:16:38] of demonology look here exodus 34:7
[1:16:40] it says keeping mercy for thousands
[1:16:42] forgiving iniquity and transgression and
[1:16:44] sin and that will by no means clear the
[1:16:47] guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[1:16:49] father's upon the children upon the
[1:16:52] children's children under the third and
[1:16:54] the fourth generation you say but glory
[1:16:58] to God I've got the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:00] Ghost but your flesh don't that body of
[1:17:05] yours don't have one converted cell in
[1:17:08] it it's just as
[1:17:09] much the same as it's always been only
[1:17:11] things getting weaker and wiser as we go
[1:17:13] along I'm a Christian but your body
[1:17:18] ain't you may swing it subject to the
[1:17:21] word but your body ain't a Christian
[1:17:24] you can't mark a child like that really
[1:17:27] that's not what the Bible was then the
[1:17:29] Bible said iniquity has passed on from
[1:17:31] generation to generation to generation
[1:17:32] do you realize that if you're born
[1:17:34] illegitimate sitting right here
[1:17:36] according to the Bible you're not
[1:17:37] allowed into the kingdom of God that's
[1:17:38] the Bible you say that I'm stuck but
[1:17:42] that's what that's the good news of this
[1:17:43] the blood of Jesus Christ once you get
[1:17:45] saved takes that mark away from you and
[1:17:48] you can go on into the kingdom of heaven
[1:17:50] but according to the Bible without the
[1:17:51] blood of Christ you in trouble hey God
[1:17:54] ain't changed his word for nobody he
[1:17:56] still looks at a legitimacy the same way
[1:17:58] he's always looked at it it's just now
[1:18:00] there's a blood Oh hallelujah to the
[1:18:04] lamb of God now there's a way that you
[1:18:07] can be cleared and go in amen you don't
[1:18:10] look at it the same way always looked at
[1:18:11] it watch this and the message called the
[1:18:14] power of the devil
[1:18:15] well I'd like to see his audience when
[1:18:17] he announced that text I want to preach
[1:18:19] it out on the power of the devil good
[1:18:20] lord
[1:18:21] sickness is not sometimes your sin
[1:18:24] directly but maybe you've inherited it
[1:18:29] from your parents oh you say well sure I
[1:18:34] wear eyeglasses my daddy wore eyeglasses
[1:18:36] I got high blood pressure my daddy had
[1:18:39] high blood pressure wait a minute wait a
[1:18:41] minute but what about that stubborn
[1:18:43] attitude from how you faced the devil it
[1:18:48] sure is but but to say the devil you got
[1:18:51] to go all the way back where I went
[1:18:52] tonight as to the Garden of Eden it
[1:18:54] ain't just the devil working on you
[1:18:56] that's you that's been handed down to
[1:18:59] you from your grandpa watch him in
[1:19:02] questions and answers when I ask brother
[1:19:03] Branham about a stubborn spirit he said
[1:19:05] well my Christian brother sister he said
[1:19:08] I find that it's usually a complex that
[1:19:10] causes this and as I go back into
[1:19:12] zermatt thousands of cases on the
[1:19:16] platform he said I find out that it goes
[1:19:19] back to a great-great
[1:19:21] great-great-grandfather
[1:19:23] we're and it's passed on down through
[1:19:25] the generations so you're not just
[1:19:27] passing down stud cancer tuberculosis or
[1:19:30] heart trouble or breast cancer some of
[1:19:32] their diabetes you're not just passing
[1:19:34] it to your children
[1:19:35] you're also passing that aptitude on if
[1:19:38] you're resistant against the word which
[1:19:40] I'm not saying in y'all arm we're just
[1:19:42] talking about about what this is doing
[1:19:43] healing is all about if you got a
[1:19:45] resistance against you know how pissed
[1:19:46] some people are you say why they say
[1:19:49] black just because you said why did it
[1:19:50] cuz they don't believe it they could
[1:19:52] agree with white but they say black
[1:19:54] because that's their nature they want to
[1:19:55] disagree with things well you think the
[1:19:57] kids are gonna be like you say white
[1:20:00] they'll say black black they gotta get
[1:20:01] the second one in they can't just get
[1:20:03] the first one they got to be a little
[1:20:05] bit more in the next generation well
[1:20:07] that's the spirit don't you realize we
[1:20:09] need divine healing from that we need
[1:20:11] divine healing from these spirits that's
[1:20:13] been passed on to us amen a stubborn
[1:20:16] attitude a stubborn spirit what Satan
[1:20:19] knew that once he got into the human
[1:20:22] race not only did he get into him
[1:20:25] spiritually but he got into him
[1:20:27] naturally and one thing the devil did
[1:20:30] was attacked their food system because
[1:20:33] he knew that the food they would eat
[1:20:34] would be the regeneration of life
[1:20:37] regenerating cells sustaining cells sir
[1:20:41] said huh well a man can eat a meat a eat
[1:20:45] a pot of potatoes and he can work for 12
[1:20:47] hours and after about 12 hours more he
[1:20:50] needs more potatoes
[1:20:51] if you eat potatoes or if you're a meat
[1:20:54] type person he eats a state and then he
[1:20:56] needs another state huh good idea why
[1:20:59] don't I just go work on the food system
[1:21:00] I'll make him weaker as they go along
[1:21:02] Satan's has got his own laboratory set
[1:21:05] up he's a scientist he's figured out how
[1:21:07] to break into the human body because he
[1:21:09] realizes that this flesh is the only
[1:21:12] vehicle for your soul and if you're
[1:21:14] gonna serve God this is the only vehicle
[1:21:16] your soul is gonna serve God in so he
[1:21:20] effects that he tries to work on this
[1:21:21] system right here watches
[1:21:25] when a man has unconfessed sin don't
[1:21:27] forget Satan has a legal right to stay
[1:21:30] right where he's at but if you don't
[1:21:33] have unconfessed sin and y'all in a
[1:21:35] man's heart don't condemn him let him
[1:21:37] ask what he will he can receive divine
[1:21:38] anything hey man hey man what about
[1:21:42] depression they're proven now depression
[1:21:45] isn't something comes on somebody it's
[1:21:47] passed from generation to generation you
[1:21:49] take a man a woman you ever watch it
[1:21:51] it's like I used the little joke it's
[1:21:53] just a joke if his name's less he can
[1:21:55] never be more because he's less but I'm
[1:21:59] making a point the point is is that
[1:22:01] whatever that man is he's always gonna
[1:22:03] be that in his flesh the only thing that
[1:22:05] can give you overcoming power with that
[1:22:07] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[1:22:09] that don't mean you won't battle it that
[1:22:12] don't mean you won't be the struggle of
[1:22:13] your lifetime remember the prophet of
[1:22:15] God said the greatest enemy you got is
[1:22:17] yourself
[1:22:20] so here he is he's last he can hurt him
[1:22:23] so here he comes on he's got certain
[1:22:28] type of ways about it mannerisms and
[1:22:30] things prophet of God talked about
[1:22:33] strains in a family he talked about said
[1:22:36] you know certain strains pass in a
[1:22:38] family you take a certain person in that
[1:22:40] might have a nervous complex he talked
[1:22:42] about in the prayer lines seeing a woman
[1:22:44] and said now sister you're a nervous
[1:22:45] person you've been that way since birth
[1:22:48] he said I see you all of your alive he
[1:22:50] said that's a strain that comes down
[1:22:52] through your family I see as a young
[1:22:54] girl a dog chases you up on the porch
[1:22:56] and you're scared always frightened
[1:22:58] something's gonna happen
[1:22:59] he said that was passed down to you we
[1:23:03] need to find healing tonight what causes
[1:23:05] a man a woman's mind to stay confused
[1:23:07] all the time what's been passed down to
[1:23:10] him look how this works in the human
[1:23:13] body so I'm at hybridization of food
[1:23:15] flashing red light paragraph said he won
[1:23:17] he said a few years ago look what man's
[1:23:19] got to in his body so look what he's
[1:23:21] things he's done science constant trying
[1:23:23] to make better food hybrid corn hybrid
[1:23:25] Tomatoes hybrid beatin the beef and the
[1:23:27] stuff is no good at all it's killing
[1:23:29] people and they don't realize it a few
[1:23:33] more years he'll be nothing like a bunch
[1:23:34] of jellyfish
[1:23:36] hello jellyfish
[1:23:39] that's where we are that's what we are
[1:23:43] yeah watch young people nowadays you put
[1:23:46] a rake in their hand rake some leaves
[1:23:47] after five minutes oh hey when a man was
[1:23:57] my age forty fifty sixty years ago like
[1:24:01] my dad when he was 42 years old when I
[1:24:04] was born

[1:24:23] brought him there but he's got a whole
[1:24:25] lot more in him and I do it 42 years old
[1:24:27] he's a generation ahead of me he hasn't
[1:24:30] been affected like I've been affected
[1:24:32] they were stronger a generation ahead of
[1:24:34] us coming on down it gets weaker and
[1:24:36] weaker and weaker
[1:24:40] he said 50 years ago he said you go to
[1:24:43] the ballgame now this is 1963 so we're
[1:24:45] talking about 1913 the rounds are burned
[1:24:48] - okay many years ago 50 years ago a
[1:24:51] ball game went on like they do you never
[1:24:53] heard of anybody getting hurt I was born
[1:24:56] in Cincinnati Ohio is going to Dayton
[1:24:58] Ohio
[1:24:58] 45 minutes in Cincinnati Ohio hey let me
[1:25:01] tell you something you wasn't even
[1:25:03] allowed to live in Ohio unless you voted
[1:25:06] for the Cincinnati Reds though your
[1:25:08] heart you had to be a ball team coming
[1:25:16] up you had Johnny Bench Pete Rose I used
[1:25:21] to go to ball games when I was a kid
[1:25:22] they take us down to Riverfront they
[1:25:24] tore it down now
[1:25:24] it's the Great American Ballpark now you
[1:25:26] know and they got riverfront you should
[1:25:28] be right up here with the Bengals
[1:25:29] stadiums that now you see when you come
[1:25:31] over the bridge 175 I'm into that
[1:25:33] ballpark many times as a boy and I watch
[1:25:35] them play three or five three and four
[1:25:37] and five hour games all the time never
[1:25:39] once saw anybody carted off needing a
[1:25:43] medic medic to come by or a trainer to
[1:25:44] come by and see what's wrong with them
[1:25:46] but now you can go to a ballgame and huh
[1:25:49] I took the girls not too long ago I
[1:25:52] to know what a ballgame was I know I
[1:25:54] know don't throw me in hell I just I did
[1:25:56] it the one time okay and I want to just
[1:26:00] experience what a baseball game was all
[1:26:01] about because I enjoyed it when I was a
[1:26:03] kid I thought maybe it'd be nice
[1:26:04] experience for them we went down we sat
[1:26:06] down this thing and brother within an
[1:26:09] hour of playing the game they had to
[1:26:11] medic on the field eight different times
[1:26:13] and some of these guys can pick up the
[1:26:16] back end of a truck they're strong and
[1:26:17] they're all the way they look but it's
[1:26:19] nothing bad about a jellyfish hybrid
[1:26:21] food what brother brems said this day
[1:26:23] the Scriptures fulfilled
[1:26:24] it's exactly where we're living at you
[1:26:28] take about these boxing and boxing
[1:26:30] matches that years ago he said they'd
[1:26:32] soak their fists and vinegar and they'd
[1:26:33] fight a hundred rounds now they put
[1:26:35] pillows on the end of their hand and
[1:26:36] they can't go a minute and thirty
[1:26:37] without having to take a breath and get
[1:26:38] some water
[1:26:41] they don't mean they don't hit hard it
[1:26:43] means that our bodies aren't built to
[1:26:45] sustain the hits like they used to be
[1:26:46] and don't you know the devil's watching
[1:26:49] that because he sees your sails
[1:26:52] degenerate he sees your strength not
[1:26:55] what it used to be why don't we have
[1:26:59] all-night prayer meetings i said frankly
[1:27:00] to kill people they can have it they
[1:27:04] come into church and start praying after
[1:27:05] three hours their soul or out takes him
[1:27:07] a week to recover I look at me like that
[1:27:10] it's the truth
[1:27:11] when's the last time y'all had an
[1:27:13] all-night prayer meeting and my point
[1:27:15] exactly in the same mess we all then our
[1:27:20] bodies can't sustain the brunt and the
[1:27:22] strength of it Satan's plan that to be
[1:27:25] just that way first Timothy chapter four
[1:27:27] verse four four and five he said every
[1:27:30] creature of God is good nothing to be
[1:27:32] refused if it's received with
[1:27:33] Thanksgiving it is sanctified by the
[1:27:35] Word of God in prayer men remember many
[1:27:37] years ago back in Lima where the Brooks
[1:27:39] was preaching on this scripture it's all
[1:27:40] about if there would be a hybrid sale or
[1:27:42] a demon of cancer something be in that
[1:27:44] cell and then you take that cell in your
[1:27:45] body it could start multiplying in you
[1:27:47] you said but if you sanctify the food
[1:27:49] with the word of God in prayer cast them
[1:27:51] Devils out of that I believe that I
[1:27:53] believe that's what the word says is
[1:27:55] what the Bible said right here I believe
[1:27:56] that Amen what do they think people are
[1:28:00] dying with I'm a window tell me a time
[1:28:02] that you ever heard of people having to
[1:28:04] take so many antidepressants
[1:28:06] everybody's on a pill including me and
[1:28:11] I'm the preacher I take insulin I take
[1:28:15] LIBOR ID I take meant for Minh I take
[1:28:17] something for acid reflux come on Fred
[1:28:24] I'm barely 41 years old the only pill I
[1:28:27] should be taking right now is the gospel
[1:28:29] and I'm a diabetic bodies can't sustain
[1:28:34] what they used to sustain even in the
[1:28:37] study of diabetes are coming to find out
[1:28:39] it ain't being fat it causes people to
[1:28:41] absolutely become diabetic it's the diet
[1:28:44] the death of beta cells what's the beta
[1:28:46] cells is what puts forth your insulin
[1:28:48] out of your pancreas that's what makes
[1:28:50] your body level out and when then beta
[1:28:51] cells die you don't get them back what's
[1:28:55] causing them to die so it says cuz
[1:28:57] you're fat no eye candy no no no no
[1:29:01] because I've seen many as skinny
[1:29:04] people's skinnier and brothers Roy and
[1:29:06] bisa diabetic they're type 1 diabetic
[1:29:09] they can't even sort of stand of
[1:29:10] diabetes what's done it hi bird food
[1:29:13] satan got into the food system he struck
[1:29:16] the body she became the mother of all
[1:29:18] living organisms even these disease
[1:29:20] germs satan it i don't mean we lay down
[1:29:24] and die friends but we have to at least
[1:29:25] recognize what's happening around us i
[1:29:28] believe in running and dieting and
[1:29:30] eating healthy and all that i just don't
[1:29:32] want to do it all the time that's the
[1:29:33] problem mate I'm tired I don't feel like
[1:29:36] doing it I've been on the road 1,200
[1:29:40] miles a week I come home I want to sit
[1:29:41] in my chair and drink Diet Pepsi I don't
[1:29:43] want to go run three miles like you died
[1:29:50] with heart trouble you probably you're
[1:29:53] probably right but it ain't because I
[1:29:55] want to he cares too you care injecting
[1:29:59] hybrid into this cattle you said God's
[1:30:02] come back into mankind according to
[1:30:04] science themselves making perversions
[1:30:06] because the cows hybrid the food is
[1:30:08] hybrid and the food makes blood cell the
[1:30:10] blood cells you're alive he said what
[1:30:11] are they done they inject the injections
[1:30:13] into the meat and now it's proved these
[1:30:15] injections take effect on the human race
[1:30:17] scientific you says
[1:30:19] they spray the fields with DDT of course
[1:30:21] they don't do that no more they got a
[1:30:22] whole lot worse stuff they just don't
[1:30:24] call it DDT anymore
[1:30:27] it's a glory to God
[1:30:30] I'll beat them at their own game I'll
[1:30:31] eat organic and what was in that ground
[1:30:33] you were organically growing it's just
[1:30:36] as polluted as the other so you say
[1:30:39] halle-loo you're not mine really well
[1:30:41] you might be an eighteenth of an
[1:30:43] eighteenth of an eighteenth better than
[1:30:45] the guy next door to you in the grocery
[1:30:46] store but the ground you brought it up
[1:30:48] just as polluted as the guy over there
[1:30:50] it's getting the same result even though
[1:30:52] one may be a little cleaner than the
[1:30:53] other come on somebody well I'll take
[1:30:58] vitamins I'll take pills
[1:31:00] I'll take oils my wife sells them by the
[1:31:02] way I didn't believe in him I said
[1:31:07] hogwash well I had a headache and she
[1:31:09] rubbed one of them headache oils on my
[1:31:11] back man and my headache went away I
[1:31:13] said hallelujah
[1:31:16] month later had a comeback though it
[1:31:19] worked but not permanently huh well I
[1:31:24] got triglycerides take fish oil sure
[1:31:28] after so long
[1:31:29] this oil brings the triglycerides down
[1:31:32] guess what happens
[1:31:33] you think glory to God I'm free of you
[1:31:35] start eating McDonald's hamburgers again
[1:31:36] a month later you're right back up
[1:31:38] taking fish oil all over again why can't
[1:31:40] the body sustain what you're putting
[1:31:42] into it it's jellyfish
[1:31:46] the cells are soda generated that it
[1:31:48] can't it can't bring it back up like it
[1:31:50] used to
[1:31:51] don't you see the only hope that we've
[1:31:54] got for this thing's over with is the
[1:31:55] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:31:57] divine healing in our bodies now a man
[1:32:01] is the Lord that gives us our health
[1:32:03] listen this see I love this remark to me
[1:32:06] it seems ridiculous in a way to think a
[1:32:09] prophet would take his time to even even
[1:32:10] prophesy about this but think of this
[1:32:12] remark he said now he said eight hundred
[1:32:15] years ago or assuming eight hundred sick
[1:32:17] people excuse me in this community he
[1:32:20] said here from eating eggs he said you
[1:32:22] remember years ago we had a little bit
[1:32:23] of structure there and I was prophesying
[1:32:25] that have come to pass don't live in a
[1:32:28] valley and don't eat eggs of all the
[1:32:32] things for God to use a prophet
[1:32:33] Alijah to prophesy about don't live in a
[1:32:36] valley and don't eat eggs you say it
[1:32:38] ain't important but it is important
[1:32:40] everything he's talking about right here
[1:32:43] has something to do with our bodies in
[1:32:45] the way it's made up right now what do
[1:32:48] they start saying eggs bread a lot of
[1:32:50] cholesterol and a mini the man eat an
[1:32:52] egg and he starts increasing his chances
[1:32:54] for heart trouble oh I know they
[1:32:56] probably disapprove it just give him 10
[1:32:58] years he'll prove it back on the other
[1:32:59] side again and they can't find what is
[1:33:03] the source of all of this I'll tell you
[1:33:06] the source I'll spell it for you
[1:33:07] e ve she was the mother of all living
[1:33:12] all of this amen and you got to know the
[1:33:16] devil new to some degree what was
[1:33:18] getting ready to happen when that little
[1:33:19] woman left the Word of God he knew what
[1:33:21] was going to take place somehow he knew
[1:33:23] all of this would fall apart I don't who
[1:33:26] you thank God for truth amen
[1:33:27] oh thank you Jesus power transformer sir
[1:33:31] I believe every seat should bring forth
[1:33:32] of his ha of its kind the human race the
[1:33:35] plant being interbred brought in
[1:33:36] someplace eating food from the earth
[1:33:38] which our bodies he said made from the
[1:33:41] earth hybrid he said now if our bodies
[1:33:43] are falling 20 and 25 years old women
[1:33:46] going into menopause he said men's hips
[1:33:49] getting wider woman's hips getting
[1:33:50] smaller she can't even bring forth the
[1:33:52] birth that's what it used to be you know
[1:33:55] they'd have a lot more strength to bring
[1:33:57] forth the birth now just go ask your
[1:33:58] local doctor ask some of these brothers
[1:34:00] in the medical community
[1:34:01] how many caesareans take place over
[1:34:03] natural birth in a year's time why they
[1:34:08] know she can't bring forth like she used
[1:34:09] to they see the heart rate doing a
[1:34:12] certain thing the blood pressure doing
[1:34:13] certain they they're watching the mama
[1:34:15] they're watching that monitor Washington
[1:34:17] they say we better get that baby out of
[1:34:18] here we in trouble why our bodies are
[1:34:24] failing now watch what he says here if
[1:34:27] it's fairly because of degenerated cells
[1:34:30] by hybrid food don't our brain cells
[1:34:33] also degenerate I'm gonna say something
[1:34:39] you're gonna laugh but I don't mean it
[1:34:41] as a joke have you ever seen so many
[1:34:43] brain-dead people in all your life in
[1:34:45] this generation women that talk to the
[1:34:47] last
[1:34:47] a lot of people ain't got a good mind
[1:34:50] anymore they don't they don't their
[1:34:56] cells have degenerated kids nowadays I
[1:34:59] don't mean these boys sitting here like
[1:35:01] he's young people sitting Oh Your Honor
[1:35:02] I'm not the generation of teenagers you
[1:35:05] sit and try to have an intelligent
[1:35:07] conversation with just regular teenagers
[1:35:09] oh my god they can't even carry a normal
[1:35:10] conversation today because they can't
[1:35:14] learn it's because something is wrong in
[1:35:16] the way that their brain fires REM told
[1:35:20] us what it was their cells are
[1:35:21] degenerating I'm not bashing young
[1:35:23] people I'm just talking about a
[1:35:24] generation coming on beyond us he said
[1:35:27] isn't that cells as well he said that's
[1:35:29] why Ricky runs down the street in the
[1:35:31] hot rod and the RIC Etta and our Vitas
[1:35:33] and the many of them we call names out
[1:35:35] there half-naked before the people they
[1:35:37] are mentally gone with no more
[1:35:41] conceptions of decency or morals why I
[1:35:47] mean honest to god the people of our
[1:35:49] nation I heard an interview just the
[1:35:51] other day David Letterman was
[1:35:54] interviewed and Barack Obama I had
[1:35:57] access to Netflix and I pulled it up but
[1:35:59] I was interested in seeing the interview
[1:36:00] because I I know the interaction between
[1:36:02] those two and how David Letterman's
[1:36:05] pulled for Barack and his homosexual
[1:36:07] agenda and I was interested to hear what
[1:36:08] he had to say I had a way I made a wave
[1:36:12] got pulled it up on the telephone I was
[1:36:14] looking at the interview and there's
[1:36:15] these two men press in the United States
[1:36:17] and one of the we called him a leader
[1:36:20] and he is a leader to many of the people
[1:36:21] there was a television show and a bunch
[1:36:24] of joke and then cutting up and carrying
[1:36:25] on but yet to the people he's a
[1:36:27] political mind and they're they're
[1:36:29] sitting there talking about I just can't
[1:36:31] understand how that people could turn
[1:36:34] them away for their sexual orientation
[1:36:36] because it actually makes sense that a
[1:36:38] man would kiss another man in the mouth
[1:36:40] a woman gets another woman in the mouth
[1:36:42] and call it love that's the generation
[1:36:44] of brain cells that's common decency and
[1:36:49] normalcy to them it proves what this
[1:36:51] prophet of God said right here they're
[1:36:53] crazy
[1:36:54] they've lost their nine he said it come
[1:36:57] to pass and the last day that people
[1:36:59] would go totally insane
[1:37:01] and here we are look at the United
[1:37:05] States of America the towers come down
[1:37:07] everybody gets religious well sure they
[1:37:09] do because they got fear
[1:37:11] everybody got scared hold on oh no I'm a
[1:37:15] month later
[1:37:17] now Bush is gonna fight their war for
[1:37:19] him and they're protected they forget
[1:37:22] all about it common thinking common
[1:37:25] sense thinking people would have said
[1:37:27] this is a judgments on let's get to our
[1:37:28] knees and get right with God I'll forget
[1:37:31] about it a month later we need to by
[1:37:34] kneeling we need to by kneeling
[1:37:37] notice again demonology brother man said
[1:37:39] let's see what a cancer is let's take
[1:37:40] him a party cells he said but down as
[1:37:44] you keep going down into that he said
[1:37:45] there's a spirit in that one cell he
[1:37:48] said now if the doctor can cut into the
[1:37:50] thing and get that one cell where the
[1:37:52] demons out he said that he's gone he
[1:37:54] said but in divine healing you to speak
[1:37:56] to the spirit cut out of him
[1:37:57] and then your body purifies the cells
[1:38:01] that's divine healing absolutely it's
[1:38:03] divine here in numbers chapter 12 verse
[1:38:06] 11 12 13 turn though him if you will for
[1:38:08] this moment now let me show you God
[1:38:09] wasn't just a healer in the New
[1:38:11] Testament he's a healer in the old as
[1:38:12] well you know no numbers 12 verses 11
[1:38:22] through 13 oh I'm having a good time I
[1:38:26] don't know about you but I'm enjoying
[1:38:28] the word I know this isn't my usual
[1:38:32] runaround scream kick and holler but
[1:38:34] just this way I felt led to handle it
[1:38:35] tonight just bring a little bit of depth
[1:38:37] to this so we can learn together
[1:38:39] numbers 12 11 12 13 aaron senator moses
[1:38:42] i'll ask my lord I beseech thee lay not
[1:38:45] the sin upon us when we have done
[1:38:47] foolishly when we have sinned come on
[1:38:50] Miriam now let her not be as one dead of
[1:38:52] the whom the flesh is half consumed when
[1:38:54] he cometh out of his mother's womb and
[1:38:56] Moses cried unto the Lord saying heal
[1:38:59] Rapha heal her now O God I beseech thee
[1:39:08] no blood
[1:39:09] Jesus know by His stripes and yet Moses
[1:39:14] is identifying God as a healer
[1:39:18] hallelujah the New Covenant didn't make
[1:39:21] him a healer he was always a healer but
[1:39:25] now we know a man through the blood of
[1:39:27] Jesus Christ we could be he'll remember
[1:39:30] healing comes through many avenues but
[1:39:32] one source I mentioned one time to you
[1:39:35] at the beginning of the service God
[1:39:36] heals by music that's look 1963 from
[1:39:39] look it up God heals my love God hears
[1:39:43] my understanding God heals my medicine
[1:39:49] thank you medicine he said if you got
[1:39:53] rats chewing holes in your house he said
[1:39:54] you lay out rat poison you see got a
[1:39:56] disease in your body you're poisoning
[1:39:58] that's what your medicines for kills the
[1:40:01] rats but the holes still there God's
[1:40:03] ones got to heal the hole a man God is
[1:40:10] the healer yes sir
[1:40:11] healing was not something established
[1:40:13] just by the new covenant but as a part
[1:40:15] of the Old Covenant in other words God
[1:40:17] never changed his attitude toward
[1:40:20] healing his people I am the Lord that
[1:40:23] healeth all thy diseases he just carried
[1:40:30] this over into the New Testament why
[1:40:32] because Jesus Jehovah the oldest Jesus
[1:40:34] 70 so if he's a healer then he's got to
[1:40:36] be a healer now Oh hallelujah son even
[1:40:39] if he's a hill of that he's gonna be the
[1:40:41] same yesterday today and forever God
[1:40:44] that he'll God that delivers God that
[1:40:47] brings divine here doctors don't heal a
[1:40:51] doctor can set the bone but God
[1:40:53] someone's got to here the bone doctor
[1:40:55] can perform LASIK on your eyes and cut
[1:40:58] in all them lasers and all that kind of
[1:40:59] stuff but God's the one that brings the
[1:41:00] healing to the eye that's right one
[1:41:06] reason they have been able to heal
[1:41:07] cancer is because they haven't be able
[1:41:08] to find the right medicine to kill the
[1:41:10] right rat give them time if they can
[1:41:13] ever get figured out the chemistry of
[1:41:15] the body and how that comes together and
[1:41:17] let one react to create another reaction
[1:41:19] to create another reaction to go
[1:41:20] straight to that cell and squeeze that
[1:41:22] devil out of
[1:41:23] canceler be a thing of yesterday I pray
[1:41:27] God everyday helps them find it
[1:41:28] but until then God is our Rafa our
[1:41:31] healer that's what Moses called him here
[1:41:34] say God Rafa Rafa heal her now
[1:41:36] what was he Jehovah Jireh jehova sholom
[1:41:39] jehova inside jehovah el Gabor but he
[1:41:41] was Jehovah Rapha how do you feel
[1:41:43] religious even God is hot yeah I don't
[1:41:46] care what anybody says he's still here
[1:41:48] not just of our bodies but our minds our
[1:41:51] spirits our complexes our attitudes
[1:41:53] everything that there is to our
[1:41:54] degenerated cells somehow - send me
[1:41:59] another day you probably find this
[1:42:00] humorous
[1:42:01] I'm a DD attention deficit disorder I
[1:42:06] said I don't doubt it so I need help
[1:42:10] from it I said yeah well I'm gonna take
[1:42:15] this pill I'm gonna take I said no doubt
[1:42:17] thank you medicine do what you're
[1:42:19] supposed to do I said but don't forget
[1:42:22] God is a healer well brother Ben you'd
[1:42:28] understand my won't my brain ain't wired
[1:42:30] like who's the one that wired your brain
[1:42:33] in the first place tell me how did it
[1:42:38] get so confused I can't just ask God to
[1:42:40] give you a rewire job it's your brain
[1:42:44] straightened out you can think like
[1:42:46] you're supposed to thank you say well
[1:42:48] ain't that easy well it ain't easy to
[1:42:50] heal cancer either but he's God that
[1:42:51] does it anyways I didn't say I could do
[1:42:54] it I said he would do it I'll never
[1:42:57] change this attitude toward children
[1:42:59] toward healing towards children remember
[1:43:01] sickness can sometimes be used as a whip
[1:43:03] for disobedient children but God is a
[1:43:07] healer of all sicknesses let me give you
[1:43:09] some Old Testament examples you want to
[1:43:11] write this down or as you get the
[1:43:12] message later second king is twenty and
[1:43:14] eight refers to Hezekiah and his healing
[1:43:17] before the Lord 2nd Kings chapter 5 9
[1:43:21] through 11 also verse 14 speaks of name
[1:43:23] and being healed of his leprosy in 2nd
[1:43:25] chronicles 7:14 the Bible said if my
[1:43:28] people which are called by my name shall
[1:43:29] humble themselves and pray and seek my
[1:43:32] face turn from their wicked ways I'll
[1:43:34] hear from heaven I'll forgive their sin
[1:43:35] and heal their land
[1:43:37] you realize when sin strikes a nation
[1:43:39] and nation becomes divided and leaves
[1:43:41] the Word of God that nation is sick and
[1:43:44] needs divine healing but what happens
[1:43:48] when you reject your healer what happens
[1:43:52] do you say God a doctor brings a pen
[1:43:54] full of needles and you say I don't need
[1:43:56] it spit the medicine between your
[1:43:57] fingers then you're stuck in your
[1:43:59] conditions and the doctor will never
[1:44:00] come back to it listen me carefully if
[1:44:03] we want real divine healing in our
[1:44:05] spirit or mind or soul we've got to
[1:44:07] accept our atonement we've got to accept
[1:44:10] our healing because like with this
[1:44:12] nation God sent healing to this nation
[1:44:14] in the form of Malachi four and five and
[1:44:16] four in the form of other fivefold
[1:44:17] evangelists and teachers and prophets
[1:44:19] and what more to this nation and this
[1:44:21] nation rejected God's healing power to
[1:44:24] bring it back to Calvary back to an old
[1:44:26] fashioned for friends this nation's
[1:44:27] dying of it's sores it's dying of it's
[1:44:30] sicknesses and God refuses to even
[1:44:32] administer a piece of medicine to it
[1:44:34] they rejected it that's why they're
[1:44:38] dying like they are that's why the death
[1:44:40] of this nation is becoming even more and
[1:44:43] more and more look how they're
[1:44:44] corrupting they get more corrupted all
[1:44:46] the time why cell by cell like a man
[1:44:48] laying in a bed being eat up of cancer
[1:44:50] and this dying that dying become an
[1:44:52] emaciated his bones failing his is his
[1:44:54] muscles being whittled away that's
[1:44:56] what's happening to this nation hey man
[1:45:00] she's on her death she's on her death
[1:45:01] rattle now Psalm 6 and 2 David asked the
[1:45:05] Lord to healing he said be healed my
[1:45:08] bones from vexed heal me Lord he cares
[1:45:12] that you care
[1:45:12] I believe God heals my medicine God
[1:45:14] heals my surgery God heals my
[1:45:15] understanding God heals my love just a
[1:45:17] little love goes a long way let somebody
[1:45:19] be all upset and show them you care God
[1:45:22] heals my love how could be an
[1:45:28] set me a sickness you've been cut you
[1:45:31] ever been cut ever had somebody offends
[1:45:33] you and you bleed for days over it you
[1:45:36] need healing your spirit bleeding
[1:45:39] wounded you need healing God still our
[1:45:43] healer God heals by love he said God
[1:45:48] heals by prayer God heals by miracles
[1:45:50] God heals by His Word
[1:45:53] God heals whatever the source is God
[1:45:55] heals in mark 3:15 he gave him power to
[1:46:00] heal sicknesses cast out devils Luke
[1:46:02] 4:18 you said the Spirit of the Lord is
[1:46:04] on me because he anointed me to preach
[1:46:06] the gospel of the poor he sent me to
[1:46:08] heal the brokenhearted this is st.
[1:46:11] cancer tuberculosis we're talking about
[1:46:12] God's the healer of broken hearts if
[1:46:17] you've been cut God knows how to heal
[1:46:19] that cut just like I heard he would
[1:46:21] speak to me just a few nights ago when
[1:46:24] you're cut it bleeds when you bleed the
[1:46:26] blood staunch is once the blood staunch
[1:46:28] is a cab
[1:46:29] a scab forms over the scab eventually
[1:46:31] falls off leaves a scar you always
[1:46:33] remember it but God brings healing God
[1:46:38] heals jesus was sent to heal the
[1:46:41] brokenhearted
[1:46:43] recovering the sight to the blind that
[1:46:45] have livers to captives to set at
[1:46:47] liberty them that are bruised well
[1:46:53] listen to me now sometimes it isn't a
[1:46:56] natural healing but you know they say
[1:46:58] when a man a woman has been assaulted
[1:47:00] mentally and they go through like a
[1:47:03] breakdown of some sort it leaves like a
[1:47:05] a bruise on the brain they've identified
[1:47:10] that the brain actually it's almost like
[1:47:12] it's been punched somebody goes through
[1:47:14] a traumatic event
[1:47:16] that's what Jesus was sent to heal glory
[1:47:18] he was sent to heal those and nervous
[1:47:21] breakdowns he was sent to heal those
[1:47:23] with with with bipolar problems and amen
[1:47:26] and tri-polar problems and whatever PO I
[1:47:28] don't care what pole you're on he's here
[1:47:30] to heal it hallelujah
[1:47:34] he is our
[1:47:41] [Music]
[1:47:43] the greatest healing of all second
[1:47:47] Corinthians 5:1 through to this earthly
[1:47:50] body the surface of Tabernacle be
[1:47:52] dissolved we already have one waiting
[1:47:55] eternal in the heavens
[1:47:58] what does divine healing speak of in
[1:48:00] this body here it speaks that guy's God
[1:48:03] changed the cells to reflect healing in
[1:48:05] my body
[1:48:06] he'll also change my body to reflect an
[1:48:09] eternal soul because what good would it
[1:48:11] do to be an eternal soul and having to
[1:48:13] have a dying body so God gives me a body
[1:48:16] one day that's gonna reflect my soul
[1:48:18] over to God amen and then it'll be
[1:48:21] eternal life dwelling in a human body
[1:48:23] you ever stop to wonder why you struggle
[1:48:27] closing now you ever stop to wonder why
[1:48:29] you fight why this seems like sometimes
[1:48:32] it's your mind mentally you just can't
[1:48:34] see you know the problem is you need
[1:48:37] divine healing you need God to touch
[1:48:40] your mind touch your spirit touch your
[1:48:41] heart it isn't just physical you know
[1:48:43] maybe not be healed from diabetes so
[1:48:46] much but what about that bruised heart
[1:48:48] we have some I lie on you or say
[1:48:51] something that wasn't right and you know
[1:48:52] it wasn't right and yet that heart is
[1:48:54] bleeding and bleeding and cut and
[1:48:56] bleeding and bleeding as all you can
[1:48:59] think about it's all you can meditate on
[1:49:01] and every time you try to get away from
[1:49:02] it it comes right back to you in the
[1:49:04] middle of the night and you cannot
[1:49:06] escape it you need divine you stand
