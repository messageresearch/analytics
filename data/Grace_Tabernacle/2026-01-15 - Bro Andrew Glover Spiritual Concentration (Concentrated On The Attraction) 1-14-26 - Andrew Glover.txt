You're thankful for the grace of God that could Amen. look beyond all of our mistakes and all of our failures. And Amen. He he looked beyond all of that to find that part of himself that he deposited on the inside of us. And amen, I tell you, I don't know, I was listening to the prophet of God today as he was speaking and he was talking about the grace of God that comes into the life of a believer and he said, you know, there's something about it. He said, when the spirit of the Lord begins to reveal that word, he said, then there's something inside of that believer that begins to scream grace, grace. Amen. Grace, grace under the things. And I tell you tonight, the things that we hear, the things that we see, the things that we believe on a on a daily basis, we ought to be crying out grace, grace. Amen. and that you would allow me to see these things. How many's thankful for it tonight? Amen. There's a lot of people in the world, but God chose us and we want to take this opportunity tonight to thank him. Maybe we could just bow our hearts here tonight for a word of prayer. I wonder how many would have a special need upon your heart. Something that you would just desire from the King of Grace tonight to do for you. I know he sees every hand. He knows every need. Tonight, let's just approach him. Heavenly Father, Lord, as your believers have gathered here on this Wednesday afternoon, Father, we've not gathered here out of ritual or out of tradition, Father. But Lord, we've gathered here tonight because we're your sons and your daughters. And Lord, Father, we are longing on the inside of our hearts tonight to fellowship with you, Lord, to hear your word, to feel your spirit, oh God. Lord, to feel your presence as it was moving among your congregation through the song service. Lord, we were so thankful, Lord, to know that the angels of God are already in attendance in this meeting tonight. Now, Father, as we endeavor to look into your word, I pray you would send the spirit of wisdom and revelation into the building tonight, Lord, I pray you would bind every spirit of unbelief, oh God. Lord, you would bind every spirit of discouragement, Lord. Ever every spirit of of of hindrance, Father, I pray you would drive it out of the building tonight, dear God. Lord, these are your eagles and they've come to fellowship around the carcass of your word. And Lord, maybe some would be sick here tonight. Lord, I know there's healing in this carcass. Maybe some would be bound. I know there's deliverance, Lord. And Father, maybe some would be discouraged. I I am a firm believer that there's encouragement in this word tonight. Now, Lord, may you may you move among us in a special way, Lord. We surrender our hearts into you, our minds. Forgive us of our failures, Lord. forgive us of our shortcomings, oh God. And Lord, may we not just leave here tonight with a good feeling, Lord, or with just a just a better idea about the things that we'll look at, but may we leave here tonight transformed, oh God. And Lord, be made into that image that you would have of us. Lord, be with those that are away that are traveling, dear God. May you keep your hand of protection upon them, Lord. Our pastor, Lord, and his his wife, they're away on a getaway. Father, may you be with them, Lord. May you may you just may you just move in a special way among us tonight. and maybe some listening at home tonight unable to be here. Lord, I pray you would minister to them as well. For it's in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. And all the believers says, "Amen." Amen. Surely, we can do better than that. And all the believers said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." Amen. God bless you tonight. We greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. While you're standing with us tonight, we want to go to the book of St. John. The book of St. John, the 12th chapter. I want to say it is a real honor to be home tonight and to be speaking to you. We thank our pastor for this opportunity tonight and sure good to see everyone out in the house of God on this on this cold Wednesday evening. A but I I believe the fire of God is burning on the inside and amen. I just want to just want to take this opportunity tonight to say how much we love and appreciate each and every one of you and amen your your faithfulness and your attendance and support of the work of the Lord and Amen. And I know some are driving um um up to an hour, hour and a half to be here on a Wednesday evening. We say God bless you all tonight. Amen. We just pray the Lord will will speak to your hearts tonight in the book of St. John the 12th chapter. And I just want to read one verse. St. John chapter 12 and verse number 32. Uh Jesus here speaking. It's a very very familiar scripture. He says, "And I if I be lifted up from the earth," now I want you to notice how he says this. He doesn't say this plural. He says this singular. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men, now notice here again, unto me. Not plural, but unto me, singular. If I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. We ask the Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word. as you can have your seats here this evening. I I want to tonight by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight uh if I would if I would take a title this evening. I want to speak to you on this uh spiritual concentration. Spiritual concentration and maybe uh to pull a little something out of that. I want to talk to you on this concentrated on the attraction. Amen. Concentrated on the attraction. You know uh there in St. John 12 and verse 32, Jesus very emphatically says unto us, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me." Now, when you look there at that word lifted, it means to lift up on high. It means to exalt. It means to raise uh to the very summit of of of magnifying and prosperity. It means to exalt. It means to raise to dignity, to honor, and to happiness. there. That word draw, it means to drag off. It means to draw, amen, by an inward power. It means to lead. It means to impale. So here, amen, our Lord Jesus is saying, "If I, Amen, will be lifted up. If I will be exalted, if I will be raised up on high, then I will lead, Amen, or I will draw all men unto myself." Brother Ram said, "Every man, Amen, that really feels that tug of the Holy Spirit, Amen, will lay aside everything else and run to him." Amen. If you really get to needing it bad enough, if it comes between death and life, he says you'll move no matter what anybody says. Amen. You must get to Jesus. It's between life and death, and you must find him right quick. Now, I'll just say this tonight. Whatever uh is being lifted before the people, amen, is is is the drawing power. Amen. Whatever is being exalted or whatever is being put before the people high enough, amen, where they can see it, then that amen, is the drawing power. And the prophet of God would say in the Easter Seal, he says, I am wondering today it's what's happening. Amen. Are we really getting the people to God? He said, are we just getting them to church? He said, now watch, we must get them to Christ. Amen. where the quickening power is again in going beyond the camp. He says, "More and more I am made to believe, amen, that people are not getting to Christ." Now, I'm here to try to help in every way that I can and make my statement as clear as I know how to make them, and you suffer with me if you will. He said, "As I look and preach across the nation," he says, "I'm watching the people and I am fully persuaded," amen, that the people are not getting to Christ. He says, "I believe the enemy has thrown the hindrance." See, because the reason I believe this, he is not the object that they have been pointed to. See, they have either been pointed to a dogma or to a doctrine or to a party or to an experience or a sensation or something like that. Amen. Instead of being pointed to Christ, AMEN. AND CHRIST is the word. Now, amen. I can say to you tonight what the prophet of God said. He said, "The message, amen, is Christ and Christ is the word." Now, amen. The inspiration of this thought, it just struck me here the other day as I was listening to the sermon, "What is the attraction on the mountain?" And brother Bram's getting ready to turn to his text. And right there in paragraph 27, he just says a little something. He says, "Now, so I've got my mind, amen, set on this message." That's that third pull. Amen. It's the one that I must be loyal and reverent to. Now, I want you to watch this. Amen. My mind is set on that third pull. It's not the three or the second, but it's the one. Amen. That I must be loyal and reverent to. Now, in the in the morning service, he identifies, and I'm going to maybe let at another time go deeper in this on the third pool. But just tonight, just to touch it, in the morning service, he identifies, amen, what those three pools or three turns of his ministry is. He said, "Now see the very day when this messenger," not when he starts on, but when he begins to declare his message. Now see, the first pool was healing. The second pool was prophesying. Amen. But the third pool was the opening of the word. Amen. The mysteries revealed. And there is no more higher order, amen, to the re to reveal the word than prophets, right? Amen. But the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the word. And listen, remember the third pull, amen, was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that has been sealed in the word. Now, amen, I find it amazing, brother Brian, out of three pools. Amen. The only one you will hear him saying this is on that third pull. So, amen. I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PULL. AMEN. Out of all three pools was that third pull. It was the one he said I must be loyal and reverent to. Amen. I'll say this. I believe it's the one that we as the bride, AMEN, MUST CONCENTRATE ON. AMEN. I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING that we should just let become a term among us or amen, just become a doctrine. BUT IF A PROPHET OF GOD, AMEN, SAID I'VE GOT TO BE LOYAL AND I'VE GOT TO BE REVERENT TO THAT THIRD PULL. AMEN. Then I do not BELIEVE THERE WAS ANY HALF-HEARTEDNESS, AMEN, IN WHAT HE PREACHED ABOUT THAT THIRD PULL. I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS ANY RESERVATION IN his spirit. Amen. To stand there and to declare the things he was saying. Amen. About seven seals and seven thunders. AMEN. THAT I THINK AS THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, WE OUGHT TO TURN OUR EYES SOLELY, AMEN. UPON THAT third pull. Amen. And concentrate upon it. Now, when you when you think of that word concentration, it is the action or the power. Amen. A focus in one's attention. Amen. Or mental effort to pay close attention. I love this. IT IS SINGLEMINDEDNESS. AMEN. IT IS ABSORPTION. AMEN. It is engrossment. It is focusing, centering. Amen. Centralization. Amen. It is a direction. Amen. It is dealing with ONE PARTICULAR THING ABOVE ALL OTHERS. AMEN. WHEN YOU BEGIN TO CONCENTRATE ON SOMETHING, AMEN. THERE'S NOT MULTIPLE THINGS THAT'S GOT YOUR ATTENTION. BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT'S GOT YOUR ATTENTION. AMEN. AND BY YOU GIVING YOUR ATTENTION UNTO IT. AMEN. YOU HAVE EXALTED IT. AMEN. YOU HAVE ELEVATED IT. YOU HAVE RAISED IT TO A PLACE, AMEN, THAT IT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT UPON your life. My Amen. You will agree that we're living in an hour that's a very scattered hour. Amen. The prophet of God said it beautiful. He said, "It's a day to where people's minds," Amen. are so scattered. How many can agree there? Amen. The minds of people are so scattered. He said, "I FEEL SORRY FOR THEM." LISTEN, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE. NOW, come on, church. Amen. It was not under that first pull. Amen. THAT WE FOUND OUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE. IF IT WAS NOT UNDER THAT SECOND PULL THAT WE FOUND OUT WHAT TO BELIEVE, BUT IT WAS UNDER THAT THIRD PULL, the opening of the word, AMEN, THAT AN AUTHORITY OF FAITH COME TO THE CHURCH, AMEN, to believe that this book, AMEN, IS NOT THE IDEAS OF A MAN. IT IT IS NOT THE CREEDS OF THE DENOMINATION. IT IS NOT THE HANDBOOK OF ORGANIZATION, BUT IT IS THE INFALLIBLE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD. HEAVENS AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY. HEY, BUT MY WORD SHALL NEVER PASS AWAY. AND THERE'S A PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT, AMEN, that can stand up on that word. He said, "One says this and one says that." HE SAID, "BUT LET EVERY MAN'S word be a lie." Amen. How many agree? Let every man's word be a lie and let MINE BE TRUE. AMEN. REB SAID, "THE American people, they're they're so scrupled up in their mind." He said, "The American people's the worst confused people I know of in the world." He said, "Religiously speaking," Amen. In Amos 8:1, AMOS PROPHESIED. He said, "Behold, THE DAY COMES." AMEN. SAYAITH THE LORD THAT I WILL SEND A FAMINE IN THE LAND. Now watch. Amen. Who is sending THE FAMINE IN THE LAND? AMEN. The Lord, HE SAID, NOT A FAMINE of bread, NOR A THIRST FOR WATER. AMEN. BUT OF HEARING the word of the Lord. NOW LOOK HERE IN VERSE 12. AND THEY SHALL WONDER. AMEN. AMEN. THAT'S A PART OF THE PROPHECY. THEY SHALL WONDER. THEY SHALL go from sea to sea. They will go from the north even to the east and shall run. Amen. To and fro and seek. Amen. The word of the Lord. Now, HERE'S THE SAD PART. AMEN. AND THEY SHALL NOT FIND IT. NOW, AMEN. AMOS SPOKE THIS THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO. AMEN. BUT A PROPHET COME IN 1955 and read that scripture AND SAID, "IF THAT DON'T FIT THIS NATION at this time, I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT DOES FIT." He said, "We don't need bread. We got plenty of it." AMEN. WE DON'T NEED WATER. WE GOT PLENTY of it. We got plenty clothes to wear. WE GOT HOUSES TO LIVE IN. HE SAID, "SEE, but it's a famine." Amen. for the hearing OF THE WORD OF GOD. HE SAYS, "A MAN WON'T know what to believe." AMEN. YOU'RE ALL CONFUSED. One says this and one says that and one says this and one says something else. HE SAID, "BUT BASE YOUR THOUGHTS, AMEN. on thus saith the Lord and God will confirm it." He said, "What's the matter with us?" Amen. WE ARE SO DENSE, AMEN, WITH ALL KINDS OF DOCTRINES and everything. He said, "It just can't GET TO US." I love this. We have been churched. Amen. And churched and rechurched and churched and dechurched. Amen. That's pretty powerful. We have been churched and we have been churched and we have been rechurched. How many been there? And you you've been re and deoured. He said in this that and all this and that and you don't know what to believe. Now watch. He said A LITTLE MOVE OF GOD WILL BREAK OUT AND THEY'LL RUN OUT INTO FANATICISM. AND HE SAID WHAT DOES fanaticism do? It paralyzes amen the people. HE SAID, "LORD, WE ARE LIVING in a day when PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT, AMEN, SO hard against this, amen, against you, against your word, amen, against your spirit. The hour WE'RE LIVING IN, FOLKS, AMEN, MEN ARE TEACHING AGAINST GOD. THEY ARE TEACHING AGAINST HIS WORD. They are teaching against his spirit. Amen. And it's causing the people not to know WHAT TO BELIEVE." NOW, YOU ALL know what I'm talking about. Amen. JUST LET A MAN START TEACHING AGAINST THE MOVEMENT OF GOD. AMEN. AND THE HOLY Ghost will COME IN A BUILDING AND WON'T NOBODY KNOW HOW TO RESPOND. AMEN. BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS TAUGHT THEM AGAINST WORSHIPING. AMEN. THE LIVING GOD. AMEN. BUT I DON'T THINK WE OUGHT TO TEACH ANYTHING AGAINST THE WORD. I THINK WE OUGHT TO STAND. AMEN. UPON THUS SAYAITH THE LORD. I BELIEVE HE'S A GOD THAT OUGHT TO BE WORSHIPED. I BELIEVE HE'S A GOD THAT OUGHT TO BE REVERENCED. I BELIEVE HE'S A GOD THAT OUGHT TO BE PRAISED. I DON'T THINK WE OUGHT TO LET SOME MAN, AMEN, TEACH THE POWER OF GOD OUT OF THE CHURCH. I THINK WE OUGHT TO OPEN UP THE DOOR AND WELCOME THE MOVEMENT of the Holy Ghost in the church. Amen. Without any restrictions &gt;&gt; or any hindrances. He says, I believe we are now living in the time, Amen, of a weak and an evil generation. How many knows the Bible said that? Amen. It would be a weak and an evil generation of mixed up, amen, confused theologians. AMEN. AND CHURCHES ALL BUNDLED TOGETHER until the people don't know what to believe. Now, I just have TO SAY THIS TONIGHT. THANK GOD THAT HE HAS PROVIDED, AMEN, A WAY IN THIS LAST DAY, AMEN, TO STRAIGHTEN OUT ALL THE CONFUSION. HE SAID, "BEHOLD, I STAND AT THE DOOR AND KNOCK." AMEN. If any man will hear my voice and will open the door, HE SAYS, "I WILL COME INTO HIM AND I WILL S WITH HIM AND HE WITH ME." YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WORD SUCK MEANS? It means reveal. So, if any MAN WILL OPEN THE DOOR, THEN I WILL COME IN THERE. And said, "WHAT'S HE GOING TO REVEAL?" HE'S GOING TO REVEAL I'M JESUS CHRIST THE SAME. AMEN. YESTERDAY, TODAY, and forever. AMEN. THINK TONIGHT. HOW? AMEN. THEY WERE WALKING THERE on that Emmas road, AND THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID THEIR MINDS WERE BLINDED. AMEN. They didn't know what to believe. He said, "And there's many a PERSON LIKE THAT IN BOWMONT TONIGHT." AMEN. THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE. He said, "But you know what they did?" Amen. They did the most wisest thing that any man could do. THEY INVITED HIM IN. THAT'S IT. It's then and then only he can reveal himself. AMEN. WHEN HE IS INVITED TO COME IN. HOW MANY WANTS HIM TO COME IN HERE TONIGHT? AMEN. AMEN. HOW MANY WANTS HIM TO COME IN EVERY SERVICE? AMEN. DO YOU KNOW HOW YOU BRING HIM IN? AMEN. He's already here. Amen. BUT HE'LL ONLY COME WHERE HE'S INVITED AND HE'LL ONLY STAY WHERE HE'S MADE WELCOME. DO YOU KNOW HOW YOU WELCOME THE REVEALER INTO YOUR HEART? IS YOU SAY, "LORD JESUS, I KNOW THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT AND I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND IT." AMEN. But come INTO MY HEART. I WANT TO ACCEPT YOU. I WANT TO BELIEVE YOU AND THEN MANIFEST YOURSELF TO ME. LISTEN, IF HE DID IT TO THE TWO ON EMMAS, HE CAN DO IT RIGHT HERE TONIGHT. AMEN. BECAUSE IF I WILL BE LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO MYSELF. I WILL LEAD THEM INTO the furtherance of the revelation of the WORD OF GOD. MY TO think tonight he IS HERE AND HE'S NOT HERE JUST TO BE A SPECTATOR. HE'S NOT HERE JUST TO BE AN ONLOOKER. HE is here to TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN EVERY ASPECT OF THIS SERVICE TONIGHT. YES, SIR. AMEN. I just recently heard someone Amen. THEY MADE A STATEMENT. I really never even heard this term. Amen. But they made a statement. THEY SAID, YOU KNOW, THEY SAID THERE'S A LOT OF DISTRACTIONS going on. And they said all kinds of people are spiritually distracted. Amen. And there's only a few that's spiritually concentrated. AND AND I'LL BE HONEST, I I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS SUCH A TERM as spiritual concentration. But I went on the on the internet there and begin to look it up. And it's actually the practice, amen, of intentionally focusing, amen, THE MIND ON A SACRED OBJECT. It's the meaning or the experience, amen, in order to deepen. Oh God. Amen. WHEN YOU BEGIN TO WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SPIRITUALLY CONCENTRATE ON SOMETHING, AMEN, THE PURPOSE BEHIND WHY YOU'RE DOING IT, AMEN, IS TO DEEPEN, AMEN, YOUR AWARENESS, AMEN, CLARITY, AND IT BRINGS AN inner transformation. Oh, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "GOD IS AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP." AMEN. AND AND I FOUND THIS AS ITS CORE. AMEN. IT means gathering scattered attention. Amen. and directing it steadily. Amen. Towards what is spiritually essential. Oh church OF THE LIVING GOD, I BELIEVE A RAPTURE IN THIS HOUR IS SPIRITUALLY ESSENTIAL. I BELIEVE HOLY GHOST MEETINGS ARE SPIRITUALLY ESSENTIAL. I BELIEVE SICK BEING HEALED AND LIVES BEING CHANGED AND HEARTS BEING RESTORED. I BELIEVE SITUATIONS BEING FIXED, AMEN, IS SPIRITUALLY ESSENTIAL. WELL, LISTEN. WHAT A MISERABLE bunch of people WE WOULD BE TONIGHT. AMEN. TO HAVE THAT DESIRE AND NOT HAVE THE MEANS by which it would TAKE TO BRING THAT DESIRE TO PASS. BUT I CAN SAY UNTO YOU TONIGHT, AMEN, THAT THIRD PULL was the opening OF THE WORD WHICH WAS THE RELEASING OF THE REVELATION. AMEN. TO BRING EVERYTHING IN GOD'S WORD TO PASS. AMEN. In his redeemed believers, amen to think tonight the spiritual amen concentration. Now, I found it amazing. I'm going to go into these more later. AMEN. BUT RIGHT HERE, I JUST WANT TO HIT IT REAL QUICK. IT INVOLVES SEVERAL DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. AMEN. The first one is a focused attention. It means you choose, amen, a single focus point and you repeatedly return to it. Amen. When the mind wonders, Amen. When when you begin to concentrate on something, AMEN, YOU FOUND AN OLD LANDMARK. AMEN. You found something that's worth. Amen. Giving your attention to. AND WHEN YOUR MIND BEGINS TO WONDER, AMEN. you turn ON A TAPE. AMEN. WHEN YOUR MIND BEGINS TO WANDER, YOU JUST THROW UP YOUR HANDS AND YOU BEGIN TO WORSHIP GOD. WHEN YOUR MIND BEGINS TO WONDER, YOU JUST BEGIN TO REMEMBER ABOUT HIS MERCY AND HIS GRACE AND HIS REDEMPTION. COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. HOW MANY CAN TESTIFY SOMETIMES, AMEN, THAT YOUR MIND WILL START WONDERING AND YOU'LL START WONDERING, "AM I EVEN SAVED? DOES GOD REALLY LOVE ME? DO I REALLY HAVE THE HOLY GHOST?" AMEN. BUT THEN YOUR MIND, AMEN, BEGINS TO GO BACK TO THE THING IT SHOULD FOCUS ON. AND IT WAS THE DAY THE HOLY GHOST CAME. AMEN. And he changed you. AMEN. FROM THE INSIDE OUT. AMEN. HE DONE SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT NO MAN CAN REVERSE. AMEN. THAT SPIRITUAL CONCENTRATION. BROTHER NO, I FIND IT AMAZING. IT BRINGS AN inner stillness. Amen. It is a It is an ATTENTION STABILIZER. AMEN. It It quietens mental noises. AMEN. NOW LISTEN HERE. THOUGHTS MAY STILL ARISE. AMEN. But they lose their grip. Amen. It's a IT'S A MEANINGFUL INTENTION. It's unlike ordinary concentration. AMEN. WHERE SOMEBODY'S studying or they're problem solving. AMEN. BUT SPIRITUAL concentration is oriented towards wisdom, insight, devotion, and an awakening. AMEN. THIS IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE ONE. AMEN. Spiritual trans SPIRITUAL CON CONCENTRATION CONCENTRATION RATHER. IT HAS A TRANSFORMATIVE EFFECT. AMEN. As one BEGINS TO SPIRITUALLY CONCENTRATE, it begins to cultivate and it BEGINS TO CAUSE TRANSFORMATION. AMEN. Now listen, there is a big difference. Amen. IN ORDINARY CONCENTRATION, AMEN. AND SPIRITUAL CONCENTRATION. Ordinary concentration is it's task oriented. AMEN. BUT SPIRITUAL CONCENTRATION IS IT'S truth oriented. AMEN. ORDINARY CONCENTRATION IT ends when the task ends. AMEN. BUT SPIRITUAL CONCENTRATION, IT AIMS AT LASTING INNER CHANGE. AMEN. ORDINARY CONCENTRATION, now listen, IT'LL STRENGTHEN THE INTELLECT. AMEN. BUT SPIRITUAL CONCENTRATION WILL BRING awareness and WILL BRING A TRANSFORMING CHARACTER. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, AMEN, THE FOCUS OF THIS MESSAGE, AMEN, is to instill, AMEN, THE DIVINE CHARACTER OF JESUS CHRIST into every believer. HE SAID, "BUY ME GOLD TRIED IN THE FIRE AND you and then you will be try you'll BE TRULY RICH." RIGHT? AMEN. LISTEN to me. Naked physically we came into the world. Amen. But naked spiritually we will not leave it. Oh no. We are going to take something with us. Amen. What are what that something is is all we can take with us. Listen, there's nothing less AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE. SO WE HAD BETTER BE REAL CAREFUL NOW. AMEN. TO SEE that we are taking something that will make us right before God. Amen. So then what will he TAKE WITH US? BROTHER RAM says we will take our character, brother. That is what we will take with us. LISTEN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE OUR QUOTE BOOKS. AMEN. WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE OUR MP3 libraries that exist. Amen. We're not GOING TO TAKE OUR CELL PHONES. AMEN. WE'RE NOT GOING TO PACK UP OUR OUR BIBLES AND ALL OF OUR STUDY BOOKS. AMEN. THE ONLY THING WE'RE GOING TO TAKE, AMEN, IS THE CHARACTER THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED ON THE INSIDE OF US BY FOCUSING ON WHAT'S IN THOSE BOOKS AND BY FOCUSING ON WHAT'S IN THOSE TAPES. MY NOW WHAT KIND OF CHARACTER WILL YOU TAKE WITH YOU? Will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of affliction? Or will it be the softness of this characterless way of seeing people? It is up to each one of us. For in that day every man, AMEN, WILL BEAR HIS OWN BURDEN. NOW, AMEN. I'm talking HERE TO YOU TONIGHT, AMEN, ABOUT THIS SPIRITUAL CONCENTRATION, ABOUT THIS STILLNESS. NOW, AMEN. HOW CAN I SPEAK OF THIS and not look in Psalms 46 and10 when David SCREAMED OUT, "BE STILL." AMEN. And know THAT I AM GOD. LISTEN WHAT HE SAYS. I WILL BE EXALTED AMONG THE HEATHEN, AND I will be EXALTED IN THE EARTH. COME ON. THAT'S THE SAME ONE THAT SPOKE IN JOHN 12. BROTHER ROYAN SAID, "IF I WILL BE LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO MYSELF." AMEN. I FIND TONIGHT, AMEN, THAT THE STILLNESS OF THE HOLY GHOST, AMEN, is the pathway, Amen, that leads to divine knowledge. Amen. I think of how brother Ram was speaking there in 1957 of blind Barnameus in his healing. And he said Jesus stood still. I love that. And said, "Bring him here." Oh, brother Jesus stood still and they BROUGHT THE BEGGAR TO HIM. HE SAID, "NOW, HIS FAITH HAD STOPPED THE SON of God and brought him to a standpoint, amen, TO A STILL STOP." AND I SAY TONIGHT, I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE, WHAT YOUR NAME IS, HOW POOR YOU ARE, HOW FAR YOU'VE GONE, YOUR FAITH WILL bring God, AMEN, TO A STANDSTILL TO HEAR YOUR HUMBLE CRY. BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD. DON'T YOU LISTEN TO THE RUMBLING BUBBLE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND THESE THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU STAND STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD. COME ON. I THINK IT'S TIME WE QUIT LETTING THE DEVIL RUN US AROUND. AMEN. With every LITTLE WIND OF DOCTRINE AND EVERY LITTLE IDEA THAT RAISES ITS HEAD, I THINK IT'S TIME WE COME TO A PLACE where we can stand still and know THAT HE IS GOD AND KNOW THAT HE IS HIS WORD. AMEN. When you when you begin to look at this in the Old Testament, YOU ALL KNOW, AMEN, THERE WAS AN OUTER COURT. There was an inner court. AMEN. THERE WAS A HOLIEST of holies. BROTHER SAID, "NO MATTER." AMEN. HOW BIG OF A HOUSE YOU HAVE. He said, "Listen, you really only live in three rooms." He said, "Every Christian lives in a three- room house." He said, "Now listen, IT'S IN THAT THIRD ROOM." AMEN. IT'S IN THAT THIRD POOL. AMEN. IT'S IN THAT THIRD ROOM. AMEN. WHERE A HIDDEN LIFE IS TRANSFORMED OR COMES TO LIGHT. HE SAID, "NOW LISTEN, THE KITCHEN'S WHERE you eat and the living room is where you commune." HE SAID, "BUT IT'S THAT BEDROOM is where you rest." HE SAID, "OH, HE MOVES ON INTO THE BEDROOM. THE STILL QUIETNESS WITH GOD WHERE ALL THE THINGS of the world is shut out. AND HE IS ALONE IN THE STILLNESS WITH GOD." BROTHER, SISTER, THAT'S THE PLACE THIS PENTECOSTAL MOVE OUGHT TO BE TODAY. NOT AS SO MUCH BABBLING. WE'RE TRINITY. We're Methodist. We're assembly. WE'RE CHURCH OF GOD. WE OUGHT TO BE ALONE IN THAT QUIET STILLNESS WITH GOD. AMEN. YOU SAY, "WHY DO WE NEED TO BE THERE?" AMEN. BECAUSE THERE'S A PROPHECY IN THE BOOK OF ACTS. AMEN. LISTEN. Repent ye therefore and be converted that YOUR SINS MAY BE BLOTTED OUT. WHEN WHEN THE TIMES OF REFRESHING, AMEN, SHALL COME FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD. YOU KNOW WHAT A REFRESHING IS? AMEN. A REFRESHING IS WHEN GOD, AMEN, fulfills his word. Brother said the first THING WAS A REFRESHMENT. HE SAID THE DEW DON'T FALL IN DAYTIME. The dew FALLS IN THE NIGHTTIME WHEN EVERYTHING IS AT PEACE. AMEN. The de can never fall on you, my brother, as long as you're FUSSING AND ARGUING AND STEWING ABOUT THE THINGS here on this earth. He said, "BUT GET ALONG WITH GOD AND LET THE DEW DROPS OF MERCY, AMEN, FALL UPON YOU IN THE STILLNESS, OH PRECIOUS MEMORIES, HOW THEY LINGER, HOW THEY EVER FILL MY SOUL." NOW LISTEN WHAT HE SAYS HAPPENS IN THE STILLNESS. HE SAYS IN THE STILLNESS OF THE MIDNIGHT. AMEN. SECRETS UNFOLD. AMEN. IN THE STILLNESS OF THE MIDNIGHT IS WHEN SECRETS UNFOLD. HOW F HOW WE THANK GOD. AMEN. THAT HE HAS COME IN THIS HOUR. HE SAYS TO BRING a real reality. NOW, AMEN. I DON'T THINK CHRISTIANITY ought to be A PUT ON. AMEN. I DON'T THINK IT OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING THAT THAT we put on when we're just around certain people. Re said no. HE SAID, "CHRISTIANITY IS NOT NOTHING YOU PRETEND. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE IT." AMEN. YOU GOT TO HAVE IT BECAUSE THE DEVIL KNOWS WHETHER YOU HAVE IT OR NOT. He said, "Oh, but when God in the stillness of his spirit has placed IT IN YOU, THEN THE DEVIL CAN'T STAND ON THAT GROUND. HE CANNOT GOW THAT SAND WITH HIS DIRTY HOOFS. HE CANNOT COME TO THAT PLACE BECAUSE IT'S A PLACE WHERE GOD AND MAN MEETS ALONE. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. DON'T YOU SEE WHAT THAT THIRD POOL WAS? AMEN. THE PUBLIC COULD KNOW IT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT A PUBLIC SHOW BUT IT WAS A PREPARED PLACE. AMEN. WHERE CHRIST WOULD MEET WITH HIS BRIDE AND THERE WOULD BE A RELATIONSHIP TAKE PLACE. OH MY. SPIRITUAL CONCENTRATION, AMEN, IS WHEN THE INSIDE, AMEN, focuses and it removes all the distractions. Amen. I love what JESUS SAID IN MATTHEW chapter 6 and verse 5. He said, 'WH THOU PRAYEST, THOU SHALT not be as the hypocrites ARE, FOR THEY HAVE TO PRAY STANDING IN THE SYNAGOGUES and in the corners of the streets, and that they may be seen of men. HE SAID, BUT VERILY I SAY UNTO YOU, THEY SHALL HAVE their reward. HE SAID, BUT THOU, AMEN, I PUT MY NAME THERE. WHEN THOU PRESS, ENTER INTO THY CLOSET, AND WHEN THOU HAS SHUT THE DOOR, AMEN. IT SOUNDS LIKE A CONCENTRATION'S HAPPENING, DON'T IT? AMEN. HAS SHUT THE DOOR, then pray TO THY FATHER WHICH IS IN SECRET, AND THY FATHER WHICH SEETH in secret, AMEN, SHALL REWARD THEE OPENLY. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, AMEN. WILL KNOW WHEN YOU'RE PRAYING IN SECRET. AMEN. WILL KNOW WHEN THE Y'ALL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, DON'T YOU? AMEN. AMEN. I TELL YOU, AMEN. THERE'S A THERE'S A OH, I'M GOING GET IN TROUBLE HERE. AMEN. THERE'S A WAY TO TELL WHEN A MAN'S really concentrated to God or not. Amen. You You all have heard HIM GET UP AND SAY, "WELL, AMEN. I AIN'T GOT MUCH TO SAY TONIGHT, SO I'M JUST GOING TO PREACH BY INSPIRATION. And it's really not preaching. Amen. It's a beating session. And they beat from one end TO THE OTHER AND CALL IT INSPIRATION. AMEN. BUT WHEN A MAN HAS GOTTEN ALONG WITH GOD UNDERNEATH THE AROMA OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL'S MESSAGE, HE WILL BEGIN TO reveal the secrets of his word. AND WHEN HE STEPS BEHIND THAT PULL PIT, IT DON'T MATTER IF THEY'RE SHOUTING OR IF THEY'RE POUTING. IT DON'T MATTER IF THEY'RE RUNNING OR THEY'RE SLEEPING. WHEN A MAN HAS MET GOD ON THE SACRED SANDS OF THE BACKSIDE OF THE DESERT, HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S SAYING. IT'S GOT TO BE SAID. SO THERE AIN'T NO DEVIL GOING TO DETER HIM WHEN HE'S SAYING IT BECAUSE HE'S FOCUSED ON THE POWER OF GOD COMING IN THE CHURCH BY THE THIRD PULL MESSAGE OF the hour. Oh my. Brother Bam goes in the what is a VISION AND I FOUND IT AMAZING BROTHER. HE DIRECTLY connects Matthew 6. Amen. To that third pull. He said now watch here. He come to me that day and spoke and said, "I'LL MEET YOU IN THERE." AMEN. This is the third pull, &gt;&gt; BUT NOBODY WILL KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. I SAID, "WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IN THERE. Why there?" He said, "IT WILL NOT BE A public show this time." I SAID, "I DON'T UNDERSTAND GOING INTO THAT CLOSET LIKE THAT." HE SAID, "IS IT NOT WRITTEN BY OUR LORD THAT WHEN THOU PRAYEST, BE NOT LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, WHO LIKE TO BE HEARD BEFORE MEN, BUT ENTER INTO THAT SECRET PLACE, that secret closet, and pray to the Father who seeth in secret, and he who SEETH IN SECRET SHALL REWARD THEE OPENLY." HE SAID, "SEE, IT'S PERFECTLY to the scripture EVERY TIME IT IS." AND I SAID, "I UNDERSTAND." AMEN. AND THEN he took ME TO THIS PLACE AND HE SAT ME DOWN IN THIS ROOM WHERE I WAS AT. AND THEN HE TOLD ME WHAT TO DO FOR THE THIRD TIME. NOW CHRISTIAN FRIEND, WHEN I LEAVE THE WORLD, THAT'LL STILL BE IN MY BOSOM. BUT YOU MARK MY WORDS. What's going to take place? Oh, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN. WE CAN MARK HIS WORDS TONIGHT, BROTHER DAVID. AMEN. YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID THAT SEVENTH SEAL, I'LL TAKE IT WITH ME TO MY GRAVE. BUT AFTER HE DIED, JEFFERSONVILLE, THANK GOD. AMEN. RELEASE THE ORIGINAL RECORDING OF THE SEVENTH SEAL. AND TONIGHT, WE'RE NOT A BUNCH OF IGNORANT PEOPLE that's got to believe THIS ABOUT THE RAPTURE AND BELIEVE THIS MAN'S IDEA ABOUT THE SEVENTH SEAL AND FOLLOW THIS MAN'S IDEA ABOUT THE THIRD PULL. BUT WE HAVE GOTTEN ALONG WITH GOD IN A PLACE OF CONCENTRATION. AND THE HOLY GHOST HAS BEGUN TO REVEAL TO US THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS THE THIRD POOL. IT'S THE CHANGE OF OUR BODIES. AMEN. AMEN. YOU ALL KNOW THAT THIRD POOL, WHAT IT DONE, IT SCATTERED THE LITTLE FISH. AMEN. LITTLE FISH GATHERED UNDER THE FIRST POOL. THEY GATHERED UNDER THE SECOND POOL. AMEN. BUT THAT THIRD PULL, AMEN. IT SCATTERED THE LITTLE FISH, BUT IT ATTRACTED THOSE RAINBOW TROUT. IT ATTRACTED THAT BRIDE, THAT LITTLE FLOCK. AMEN. I THINK OF HOW THERE IN MATTHEW 21 WHEN JESUS, AMEN, COME RIDING INTO TOWN. AMEN. THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID HE MADE UP THIS LITTLE GROUP OUT OF A BUNCH OF POOR PEOPLE. HEY. AMEN. A BUNCH OF FISHERMEN AND A BUNCH OF TAX GATHERS AND A BUNCH OF UNEDUCATED. He said, "See, but in the midst OF ALL OF IT, THROUGH EVERY AGE AND EVERY PROPHET THAT HAD BEEN OR WOULD BE, THERE IS GOING TO BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT IS PREDESTINATED, AMEN, TO HEAR THAT MESSAGE." OH, AND THEY'LL FOLLOW IT. LISTEN, THERE IS A BRIDE ON THE EARTH TONIGHT WHO IS NOT JUST HEARING THIS MESSAGE, AMEN, BUT SHE IS FOLLOWING IT. AMEN. SHE IS CONCENTRATED ON IT AND IT IS TRANSFORMING HER. It is stabilizing HER. IT IS EMPOWERING HER. IT IS ANOINTING HER. IT IS ENCOURAGING HER. Oh to thank tonight THE THOSE IGNORE CROWDS. AMEN. AMEN. THOSE THOSE PREDESTINATED ONES, BROTHER DAVID PAUL, THEY IGNORE THE CROWDS. AMEN. THEY IGNORE THE CRITICISM. AMEN. THEY HAVE NO ARGUMENTS. AMEN. THERE'S ONE THING THEY DO AND THAT'S BELIEVE. AMEN. TO GET EVERY BIT OF IT THEY CAN. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BROTHER TIM. AMEN. BUT I WANT TO SOAK IT IN. AMEN. I WANT TO BE LIKE MARY. I I WANT TO SIT AT THE FEET OF JESUS. I DON'T JUST WANT THIS TO BE A SUNDAY MORNING AFFAIR. I DON'T JUST WANT THIS TO BE A WEDNESDAY NIGHT AFFAIR. AMEN. BUT I WANT THIS TO BE AN EVERY HOUR OF MY LIFE. AMEN. SOAKING IN, AMEN. THE REVELATIONS. AMEN. SOAKING IN THE GRACE OF GOD. COME ON, GRACE TABERNACLE. IT'S TIME TO SHAKE YOURSELF AND SAY, "THIS IS THE HOUR." AMEN. WE'VE HEARD THESE THINGS. WE'VE PREACHED THESE THINGS. WE'VE SUNG ABOUT THESE THINGS. WE'VE SHOUTED ABOUT THESE THINGS. BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO SO HONE IN AND BEGIN TO CONCENTRATE ON THESE THINGS UNTIL THE VERY CHARACTER OF JESUS CHRIST IS DEVELOPED IN EVERY INDIVIDUAL. AMEN. IF IF THERE'S A DESIRE IN YOUR HEART TO HAVE IT, THERE'S A GOD IN HEAVEN TO PERFECT IT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AMEN. I'LL SAY THIS. THE OPPOSITE OF AN ATTRACTION IS a distraction. &gt;&gt; And you all know in LUKEAP 10:38, IT SAYS, "NOW IT CAME TO PASS AS THEY WENT." AMEN. AND HE ENTERED INTO A CERTAIN VILLAGE AND A CERTAIN WOMAN. I like that certain certain amount of people. A CERTAIN WOMAN NAMED MARTHA RECEIVED HIM INTO HER HOUSE AND SHE HAD A SISTER CALLED MARY WHICH ALSO SAT AT JESUS' FEET AND HEARD HIS WORD. BUT MARTHA, AMEN, WAS CUMBERED ABOUT MUCH SERVING AND CAME TO HIM AND SAID, "LORD, DOST THOU NOT CARE THAT MY SISTER HATH LEFT ME TO SERVE ALONE?" AMEN. BID her therefore that she help me. NOW LOOK AT THIS WORD CUMBERED. IT MEANS TO DRAW AWAY. IT MEANS TO BE DRIVEN ABOUT MENTALLY. IT MEANS to be overoccupied. NOW COME ON. I'M PREACHING TO YOU. AMEN. She was cumbered. AMEN. AMEN. SHE WAS DRIVEN ABOUT MENTALLY. SHE SHE WAS BEING DRAWN AWAY. AMEN. SHE WAS OVEROCCUPIED. AMEN. I MIGHT AS WELL READ THE REST OF IT. SHE WAS TOO BUSY. AMEN. NOW LOOK WHAT JESUS ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO HER. HE SAID, "MARTHA, MARTHA, THOU ART CAREFUL AND TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS." HOW MANY'S EVER BEEN THERE? AMEN. HOW MANY'S EVER COME TO CHURCH? AND MAYBE SOME OF Y'ALL ARE SITTING HERE TONIGHT JUST LIKE MARTHA WAS. AMEN. YOU'RE CUMBERED. AMEN. YOU'RE TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS. AMEN. BUT CAN YOU HEAR the voice of the word? YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID, "LISTEN, BUT ONE THING IS NEEDFUL." AMEN. NOT MANY THINGS. AMEN. BUT ONE THING IS NEEDFUL. AND MARY HAD CHOSEN THAT GOOD PART WHICH SHALL NOT BE TAKEN AWAY FROM HER. HAVE YOU EVER FOCUSED ON SOMETHING, FOLKS, AND THEN IT'S JUST TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU? HAVE YOU EVER GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU GOT TO A SITUATION AND THEN IT'S JUST TAKEN AWAY? I'M PREACHING TO YOU TONIGHT. AMEN. THAT'S WHY I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET BACK TO PREACHING THE MESSAGE AND QUIT TRYING TO BUILD MINISTRIES AND BUILD PERSONALITIES. I I LET ME LET ME REPHRASE THAT. I BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO BUILD MINISTRIES, AMEN, under the power of GOD THAT'LL BE MINISTRIES OF THIS MESSAGE. BUT BUILDING UP MEN AND THIS GUY DONE THIS AND THIS GUY DONE THAT AND THIS CHURCH. AMEN. FORGET IT ALL. AMEN. AMEN. CUZ ONE DAY, OH GOD, Y'ALL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AMEN. Y'ALL REMEMBER IN SCHOOL WHEN YOU GOT A FRIEND, YOU RAN AROUND CALLING EVERYBODY THEIR BEST FRIEND AND WHILE YOU WERE TELLING SOMEBODY THEY WERE YOUR BEST FRIEND, THEY WERE TURNING ON YOU. AMEN. AND THEY WERE BECOMING YOUR ENEMY. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, PREACHER? I'M SAYING QUIT GIVING YOURSELF, AMEN, TO LITTLE DISSENSIONS AND TO LITTLE POLITICS AND TO LITTLE ILL FEELINGS, AMEN, BECAUSE IN THE MOMENT, IN THE TWINK OF AN EYE, IT'LL ALL BE GONE. BUT THERE IS ONE THING THAT SHALL NEVER PASS AWAY. IT'S THE WORD OF GOD. AND IF A MAN, WOMAN, BOY, OR CHILD WILL EVER GIVE THEMSELVES UNTO THE THINGS OF GOD. AMEN. THERE WILL BE AN ETERNAL REWARD THAT NO MAN can take away from you. YES, SIR. AMEN. DON'T FOCUS ON THESE MANY THINGS. FOCUS ON THAT ONE THING. WATCH HOW JESUS CONTRASTED. HE CONTRASTED MANY THINGS WITH ONE THING. YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID, "LOOK HERE. YOUR PRACTICAL NEEDS ARE IMPORTANT." AMEN. But listening to Jesus should be the priority. I LOVE WHAT BROTHER MATT SAID THERE ON SUNDAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HOUSE OF GOD. AMEN. I KNOW I I'M I'M LAUGHED AT AND MADE FUN OF AND OLD SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AMEN. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT ME THAT JUST GETS PHYSICALLY SICK WHEN I CAN'T BE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. AMEN. I MAY BE PHYSICALLY SICK. AMEN. BUT I'LL GET EVEN SICKER, BEN. AMEN. BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING IN ME THAT DESIRES TO BE WHERE THE CARCASS IS. SOMEBODY SAY, "WELL, AMEN. I DON'T THINK CHURCH IS IMPORTANT." WELL, MAYBE NOT TO YOU. AMEN. BUT JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO YOU, DON'T MEAN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SET THE STANDARD OF HOW EVERYBODY ELSE SHOULD CONDUCT THEIR CHURCH ATTENDANCE. I THINK IF THERE'S A CHURCH CLOSE BY, YOU OUGHT TO DARKEN THE DOOR OF IT. AMEN. YOU OUGHT TO SAY, "LORD, I'M HERE TO WORSHIP YOU. AMEN. I know YOU'RE THINKING I'M TOO FAR ON THAT. BUT I'M REALLY NOT BECAUSE THAT M BECAUSE WHAT JESUS SAID THERE IN LUKE, IT TIES ALL THE WAY BACK TO PSALMS 27 AND VERSE FOUR WHEN DAVID SAID, "ONE THING HAVE I DESIRED OF THE LORD, AND THAT WILL I SEEK AFTER THAT I MAY DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE, THAT I WILL BEHOLD, AMEN, THE BEAUTY OF THE LORD, AND TO INQUIRE IN HIS TEMPLE." OH, GRACE TABERNACLE. HOW MANY CAN SAY, "LORD, LET IT BE." THERE'S ONE THING I DESIRE THAT I MAY DWELL IN THE PRESENCE OF JESUS CHRIST THAT I MAY BE THERE. THAT I MAY BEHOLD HIS BEAUTY. THAT I MAY INQUIRE IN HIS TEMPLE. REVEREND SAID, "IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL." He said, "There's so many emotions and SO MANY THINGS TO DISTRACT US FROM THE SPIRIT TODAY." NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT PAUL SAID IN 1 Corinthians 7:35? He said, "The thing I SPEAK FOR YOUR OWN PROFIT, NOT THAT I MAY CAST A SNARE UPON YOU." AMEN. SO I WAS NOT SAYING THOSE THINGS. BROTHER MATT IS NOT SAYING THOSE THINGS. AMEN. TO CAST A SNARE UPON YOU. AMEN. BUT THAT WHICH IS COMELY. NOW LOOK HERE. AND THAT YOU MAY ATTEND UPON THE LORD WITHOUT DISTRACTION. &gt;&gt; THAT YOU MAY ATTEND UPON THE LORD WITHOUT DISTRACTION. LOOK AT THIS WORD ATTEND. IT MEANS TO SIT CONSTANTLY. IT MEANS TO BE DEVOTED TO. NOW, BROTHER ANDREW, ARE YOU SAYING, "AMEN, THAT I'VE GOT TO I'VE GOT TO LIVE IN A ROOM WITH the door shut, the shades pulled down, with my ear TO A TAPE PLAYER ALL THE TIME?" NO, FOLKS. I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO MOVES INTO AN EXPERIENCE. THEY MOVE INTO A HIDDEN LIFE. AND WHEN THEY'RE ON THE JOB, THEY'RE DESIRING THE LORD. WHEN THEY'RE AT SCHOOL, they're fellowshipping with the Lord. WHEN THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY TO WORK. AMEN. THEY'RE FELLOWSHIPPING with them. I'VE HEARD SOME OF YOU BROTHERS TELL ME ABOUT THOSE MORNING DRIVES TO WORK and you just turn ON A TAPE AND THE POWER OF GOD. I GET A WITNESS HERE TONIGHT. AMEN. THE POWER OF GOD DROPS IN YOUR TRUCK. AMEN. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? THAT'S ONE THING I HAVE DESIRED THAT I WOULD CONCENTRATE UPON THE THINGS THAT GOD HAS DONE IN MY GENERATION. OH, THAT WORD DISTRACTION. IT MEANS WITHOUT IT MEANS WITHOUT ANXIETY. IT MEANS WITHOUT CARE. REB SAID, "OH, HE IS THE CENTER of our worship. He is the center of our attraction. HE IS THE CENTER OF OUR LIFE. ALL THAT WE HAVE AND WANT ARE AND WILL BE IS BASED UPON HIM. HE IS THE ONE WHO CAME AND GAVE HIS LIFE FOR US. HE COME DOWN FROM GOD OUT OF GLORY AND WAS MADE FLESH AND DWELT AMONG US AND TAKEN UPON HIM THE SIN OF US ALL AND THE SICKNESS OF US ALL AND BORED AWAY TO CALVARY AND THERE PAID THE PRICE. LISTEN, NOT MANY, NOT US. AMEN. NOT ALL OF US, BUT HE IS WORTHY OF ALL THE PRAISE THAT WE CAN GIVE TO HIM. LISTEN, I TELL YOU WHAT I PRAY I PRAY THIS CHURCH IS KNOWN FOR. I PRAY WE'RE KNOWN FOR A BUNCH OF SHOUTING, HOLY GHOST FILLED. AMEN. FIREBAPTIZED PEOPLE THAT KNOWS WHO SAVED US. WE KNOW WHO HEALED US. WE KNOW WHO DELIVERED US. WE KNOW WHO REDEEMED US. WE KNOW WHO GAVE US THE HOLY GHOST. AND HIS NAME IS JESUS CHRIST. AND IF WE CAN DO ANYTHING, WE WANT TO DO IT UNTO HIM BECAUSE HE IS WORTHY OF IT ALL THAT WE COULD EVER GIVE UNTO HIM. IF I BE LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO MYSELF. I LOVE WHAT he says. He says, "The greatest attraction THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER HAD IS WHEN CHRIST be lifted up to A FALLEN WORLD." TO MY OPINION, THE GOSPEL NEVER LOSES ATTRACTION. AMEN. TO A BELIEVER, IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME GOSPEL. NOW, FOLKS, I'M TALKING ABOUT A HIDDEN LIFE. I'M TALKING ABOUT A CONCENTRATED LIFE. I'M TALKING ABOUT I'M TALKING ABOUT FOCUSING ON SOMETHING THAT WILL STABILIZE YOU. AMEN. SOMETHING THAT WILL TRANSFORM YOU, SOMETHING THAT WILL GIVE YOU A CHARACTER ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR HEART. REMEMBER SAID THE GOSPEL AND YET IN ITS SIMPLICITY IS THE GREATEST DRAWING CARD THE WORLD has ever known. Jesus said WHEN HE WAS HERE ON EARTH, "IF I BE LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO ME." I LOVE THIS. BLACK, WHITE, YELLOW, BROWN, whatever their color or race is, the gospel still holds the center OF ATTRACTION TO EVERY MAN. HE SAID CHRIST IS OUR LEADER. HOW MANY AGREES THE MESSAGE IS CHRIST AND CHRIST IS OUR LEADER? THEN WHEN WE ALLOW OUR FOCUS, AMEN, to drift from the attraction, we begin to focus ON DISTRACTIONS. YOU ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS? REVIVAL FIRES BEGIN TO DIM DOWN. NOW, NOW, NOW, LET ME PREACH A MINUTE HERE BECAUSE PAUL TOLD TIMOTHY, IN THE LAST DAYS, PERILOUS times shall come. And down IN VERSE FOUR, HE SAID, "THERE'LL BE TRAITORS. THEY'LL BE HEADY. THEY'LL BE HIGHMINDED." AMEN. THEY'LL BE LOVERS OF PLEASURE MORE THAN LOVERS OF GOD. BROTHER RAM'S REFERRING TO SECOND Timothy 3 AND HE SAID, "THE TELEVISION has come into the home and holds the people away FROM THE PRAYER MEETINGS. IT'S GOT AN ATTRACTION TO it &gt;&gt; that's attractive AND BEAUTIFUL. AND I DON'T NOW NOW I THANK GOD FOR for a prophet. David, he wasn't a legalist. He was a he was a prophet. HE SAID, "NOW I DON'T SAY THAT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS ISN'T ALL RIGHT. THERE'S A LOT OF it there's a lot of IT THAT ISN'T. WE KNOW THAT." HE SAID, "YES, 99% OF IT ISN'T ALL RIGHT. BUT SAY THERE WOULD BE 1% of it." WELL, WHAT YOU GET IN THAT 1%, would you mean to give up that 1% for the church of the living God? &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. That's the time to say amen. AMEN. WILL YOU GIVE UP THAT 1% FOR THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD WHERE IT'S 100% RIGHT? AMEN. YOU'LL STAY AWAY ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT FROM PRAYER MEETINGS. NOW, COME ON, FOLKS. I'M NOT I'M NOT TRYING TO BE A TRYING TO BE A LEGALIST. I'M TRYING TO BE A GOSPEL PREACHER. AMEN. WELL, THERE MAY BE ONE LITTLE PERCENT, RIGHT? AMEN. BUT WHAT IS WORTH THAT 1% WHEN THE HOUSE OF GOD IS FULL OF 100% OF JESUS AND 100% OF HIS WORD AND 100% OF HIS POWER? I KNOW PEOPLE, AMEN, THEY'LL MISS CHURCH FOR 1%. THEY'LL STAY HOME FOR 1%. AMEN. BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, I'M NOT A 1% CHRISTIAN. I AM A HOLY GHOST FILLED, FIRE BAPTIZED. I'M RUNNING FOR JESUS AND I GOT TO MAKE A HUNDRED. AMEN. I wish I had MY BUDDY, BROTHER FRED MULLEN HERE TONIGHT. HE'D SING, "I'M RUNNING FOR JESUS, TRYING TO MAKE A 100. 99 AND A HALF JUST WON'T DO." AMEN. AMEN. I love Brother Fred. He gets to singing that. And Sister Joyce, he'll start all the way DOWN THERE AT 85 AND SAY, "WHAT ABOUT 85? JUST won't do." And he'll go all the WAY UP TO 99 JUST WON'T DO. AMEN. LISTEN, FOLKS. 99 AND A HALF WON'T DO. IT'S GOING TO TAKE A 100%. AMEN. To be A BELIEVER IN THIS HOUR. SIN IS ATTRACTIVE AND WAY YOU TAKE IT. SIN is attracted to the human being. LISTEN, BECAUSE HE'S A SUBJECT OF THE FALLEN RACE THAT WE ARE, AND IT'S ATTRACTIVE. HE SAID, SATAN KNOWS HOW TO MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE. HE'S A GENIUS AT HIS JOB. OH MY. AMEN. IF HE CAN'T GET IT OUT THERE IN THE WORLD FAIR, he brings it right INTO THE CHURCH. HE COMES RIGHT OVER on our ground. That's the reason, brethren and sisters, WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE HIM. IF I BE LIFTED UP, IT'S TIME THAT THE CHURCH WAS SPIRITUAL TO RECOGNIZE TO KNOW GOD. NOT BY CREED, NOT BY DENOMINATION, BUT BY EXPERIENCE of being FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. WHOLE CHURCH. THAT'S MY DESIRE IS THAT EVERY MEMBER OF THIS ASSEMBLY WOULD BE SO FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT WHEN THE DEVIL TRIES TO BRING SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE, THERE IS SOMETHING RAISES UP ON THE INSIDE OF YOU AND SAYS THAT'S A DISTRACTION THAT'S TRYING TO TAKE MY FOCUS AND MY ATTENTION AWAY FROM THAT THIRD PULL. &gt;&gt; He said it used to be the old Pentecostals wouldn't let their children ever go to picture shows. Well, the devil pulled one over on their eyes AND HE BROUGHT THE PICTURE SO RIGHT IN THE HOUSE. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU SEE HOW HE GOT IT SLICK, WHY SLIMY AS HE CAN BE. Don't you never underestimate him. You stay UNDER THE CROSS. IT'S THE ONLY PLACE TO STAY FOR SAFETY. NOW, NOW THIS BROTHER, HE SAID, "SO THE OLD-TIMERS, YOU SEE, AMEN. THEY STAY WITH GOD." WELL, I SAY, "GOD, GIVE US SOME ELDERS." COME ON, FOLKS. AND I SAY, "GOD, GIVE US SOME ELDERS THAT'LL STAY WITH GOD THAT WILL NOT LEAVE THEIR FIRST LOVE." &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "PREACHER, WHY ARE YOU SAYING THIS?" BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID, "NEVERTHELESS, I HAVE SOMEWHAT AGAINST THEE BECAUSE THOU HAS LEFT THY FIRST LOVE." NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT A PROPHET PICKS that up and says? HE SAYS, "IN THE GENERATIONS OF ISRAEL, WE SEE REVIVAL IN ONE GENERATION only to SEE THE FIRES FADING IN THE NEXT. AND IN THE THIRD GENERATION, EMBERS THAT MAY BE GLOWING SLIGHTLY, BUT IN THE FOURTH, THERE MAY BE NO VESTAGE WHATSOEVER OF THAT ORIGINAL FLAME. I SAY, GOD, DON'T LET THAT BE SAID ABOUT US. I SAY, GOD, GIVE US SOME ELDERS THAT WILL NOT WEAKEN AND WILL NOT DILUTE THE STANDARDS OF HOLINESS AND PURITY. LISTEN, OUR YOUNG PEOPLE NEED ELDERS TO LOOK UP TO AND SEE THAT SOMEBODY BELIEVES WHAT THE PROPHET SAID AND WILL SEPARATE THEMSELVES AND WILL CONCENTRATE THEMSELVES ON THE THINGS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. He said, "You start out with true born again." Now, put your seat belts on. I guess it's just going to get bumpy for a minute. YOU START OUT WITH TRULY BORN AGAIN BELIEVERS AND WHEN THAT NEXT GENERATION COMES ALONG, THEY ARE NO LONGER just plain Christians, BUT THEY HAVE TAKEN A DENOMINATIONAL NAME AND ARE NOW BAPTIST AND METHODIST. HE SAID, "LISTEN, THE FERVENT DESIRE TO PLEASE GOD, THE PASSION TO KNOW HIS WORD, the cry, OH MY, THE CRY FOR REACHING OUT IN THE SPIRIT, IT ALL BEGINS TO FADE." AND INSTEAD OF THAT CHURCH BEING ON FIRE, IS THIS OKAY? &gt;&gt; WITH THE FIRE OF GOD, IT HAS COOLED off &gt;&gt; and become a bit formal. THAT IS WHAT WAS HAPPENING BACK THERE TO THE EPHESIANS. THEY WERE GETTING a bit formal. Now, EITHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE FIERY OR YOU'RE GOING TO BE FORMAL. &gt;&gt; AND I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DON'T WANT NO PART OF FORMALITY. FORMALITY ROBS THE POWER OF GOD FROM BLESSING THE CHILDREN OF GOD. AMEN. I DON'T WANT NO FORMAL CHURCH. I DON'T WANT NO FORMAL RELIGION. I WANT SOMETHING THAT'S GOT SOME FIRE IN IT THAT WHEN IT BEGINS TO MOVE, IT BEGINS TO BURN AWAY EVERYTHING THAT'S UNLIKE OUR GOD. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. HE SAID THE ABANDONMENT WAS TO GOD WAS DYING OUT. AND THE PEOPLE WEREN'T TOO CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT GOD THOUGHT ABOUT THEM AS THEY BEGIN TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT THE WORLD THOUGHT ABOUT THEM. WELL, I WOULD DO THIS, BUT YOU KNOW, MY FRIEND SAYS THIS AND I WOULD DO THIS, BUT YOU KNOW THAT ONE SAID THIS AND AND YOU KNOW, AMEN. IT'S A LITTLE OLDFASHIONED JUST TO HOLD them old time standards. William Brandom. Amen. So, we're just going to we're going TO BELIEVE THEM. NO, WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS LET THE FIRE OF GOD, AMEN, GO OUT OF YOUR LIFE AND THEN THE SECOND GENERATION WILL BE JUST LIKE ISRAEL. THEY WILL DEMAND A KING TO BE LIKE OTHER NATIONS. AND WHEN THEY DID THAT, THEY REJECTED GOD. BUT THEY DID IT ANYWAY. That's the HISTORY OF THE CHURCH. NOW LISTEN. He says WHEN IT THINKS MORE OF CONFORMING TO THE world of the world INSTEAD OF CONFORMING TO GOD, IT ISN'T LONG UNTIL YOU SEE THEM STOP DOING THINGS they used to do. &gt;&gt; Am I reading the message right? &gt;&gt; AND START DOING THINGS THEY wouldn't do initially. They change their manner of dress. Now, now watch what happens. Their attitudes and their behavior. &gt;&gt; Y'all know I'm TELLING THE TRUTH. YOU YOU JUST START DRESSING A LITTLE BIT like the world and coming to CHURCH AND THEN YOUR ATTITUDE changes and it changes from preach IT PREACHER TO I DARE YOU TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; Y'ALL KNOW I'M PREACHING, DON'T YOU? AMEN. AND THEN THE BEHAVIOR CHANGES. AMEN. BEGIN TO REBEL AGAINST THE WORD. LISTEN, I'M RIGHT HERE IN THE MESSAGE. IT'S BECAUSE YOU GET LAXED. AND THE PRO OF GOD SAID THAT'S WHAT EPHESUS MEANS. IT MEANS RELAXED and drifting. WHEN YOU GET RELAXED, YOU BEGIN TO DRIFT. HE SAID THE CYCLE OF REVIVAL AND DEATH HAS NEVER FAILED. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS RECALL. AMEN. THE LAST MOVE OF GOD IN THE SPIRIT. WHEN MEN AND WOMEN DRESSED LIKE CHRISTIANS, THEY WENT TO CHURCH. THEY PRAYED ALL NIGHT. THEY TOOK TO STREET CORNERS. THEY WEREN'T ASHAMED OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SPIRIT. THEY LEFT THEIR OLD DEAD CHURCHES AND THEY WORSHIPED IN HOMES OR OLD STORE BUILDINGS. THEY HAD REALITY, BUT IT WASN'T TOO LONG A TIME UNTIL THEY BEGIN TO GET ENOUGH MONEY TO BUILD FINE NEW CHURCHES. I'm going to preach. AND THEY PUT IN A CHOIR INSTEAD OF SINGING UNTO GOD FOR THEMSELVES. AND THEY PUT GOWNS ON THE CHOIR. SOMEBODY SAY, "WHY THEY DO THAT?" WELL, IF THE DRESSES WERE LONG ENOUGH, THEY WOULDN'T HAD TO PUT GOWNS ON THEM TO BEGIN WITH. COME ON, PREACHER. PREACH, HOLY GHOST. AMEN. THEY ORGANIZED A MOVEMENT AND RAN IT BY MAN. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS. AND THEY SOON BE TO READ BOOKS THAT WERE NOT FIT TO READ. NOW, NOW FOLKS, I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT LIKE THE PROPHET SAID. THEY LET DOWN THE BARS AND THE GOATS CAME IN AND TOOK OVER. I I KNOW PEOPLE THAT'S JUST LIKE THIS. THE CRY OF JOY WAS GONE. THE FREEDOM OF THE SPIRIT WAS GONE. OH, THEY KEPT ON WITH THE THRM. AMEN. BUT THE FIRE HAD DIED DOWN. AND THE BLACKNESS OF ASHES IS ABOUT ALL THAT IS LEFT. FOLKS, YOU KNOW I'M TELLING THE TRUTH. WHAT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON IS DETERMINE WHAT LEVEL YOU'RE LIVING ON. YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T READ OLD DIRTY BOOKS ALL THE TIME AND EXPECT THE POWER OF GOD, AMEN, TO FILL YOU WITH THE DESIRES OF YOUR HEART. COME ON. AMEN. YOU CAN'T FEED ON HONKY TONK MUSIC ALL WEEK LONG AND THEN EXPECT THE LAND TO BLESS YOU ON SUNDAY MORNING. YOU'RE TOO DISTRACTED. YOU'RE TOO SCATTERED. BUT GOD SAID, "IF I WILL BE LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO MYSELF." COME ON. I THINK IT'S TIME. I MIGHT AS WELL PREACH. IT'S THE TRUTH. I THINK IT'S TIME TO TEAR DOWN EVERY IDOL THAT WE HAVE EXALTED IN OUR LIVES THAT HAS TAKEN OUR CONCENTRATION OFF OF THIS MESSAGE. IT'S TIME TO TEAR IT DOWN AND LIFT UP JESUS CHRIST. HE IS YOUR FUTURE. I'M PREACHING TO YOU. HE IS YOUR FUTURE. HE IS YOUR FUTURE. JESUS CHRIST IS YOUR FUTURE. &gt;&gt; WELL, I'm nervous. had a had a young man tell me one time. He said, "I'm nervous. I don't know what's wrong with me." And then then a few days later, he's telling me about some some some hard rock, punk rock, or whatever they call it music that I had an old buddy of mine up in Hills, West Virginia. Brother Roy, he called it your mama hate music. It's what it does. You get under that nonsense and you &gt;&gt; I'm preaching. You don't have to tell me. I know I am. &gt;&gt; GET UNDER THAT NONSENSE AND IT STARTS AFFECTING THE WAY YOU TALK TO YOUR MAMA. AFFECTING OH, COME ON. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL I DON'T HAVE TO BE A PROPHET TO TELL A BOY'S LISTEN TO COUNTRY MUSIC. ALL OF A SUDDEN, TOBACA SHOWS UP IN THE LIP. COME ON. AND EVERY WOMAN, COME I'm preaching to you. AMEN. IT'S BECAUSE SOMEWHERE WE'VE GOT DISTRACTED. BUT THERE'S A MESSAGE, FOLKS. AND IF A PROPHET WAS LOYAL AND REVERENT TO IT, I THINK IT'S TIME WE WHO CLAIM TO BE THE BENEFICIARIES OF THIS MESSAGE OUGHT TO LIFT IT UP AGAIN AND POINT EVERY FAMILY, POINT EVERY YOUNG PERSON, POINT EVERY PREACHER. OH, IF I COULD COMPEL EVERYBODY TONIGHT, LIFT HIM UP UNTIL HE BEGINS TO LEAD YOU INTO THE RICHES OF HIS GRACE AND THE DEPTHS OF HIS MERCY. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I WANT TO KNOW HIM BEYOND THE SURFACE RELATIONSHIP. I WANT TO KNOW HIM BEYOND THE KITCHEN EXPERIENCE. I WANT TO KNOW HIM BEYOND THE LIVING ROOM. I WANT TO KNOW HIM IN THE STILLNESS OF HIS SPIRIT WHEN HE begins to unfold secrets to me. You say, "Preacher, why are you preaching on those things?" Because you can't keep firing your soul and feed on that nonsense. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just preached to you. Cuz I've seen I've seen romance novels destroy marriages. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE WOMEN GET IN THEIR MIND some image of a man and there ain't no man can ever fit that image. Well, Brother Bram called them True Story magazines. Come on, FOLKS. I'M PREACHING. BROTHER BRHAM CALLED THEM TRUE STORY MAGAZINES. LISTEN, THEY'RE FILTH. &gt;&gt; WELL, brother Andrew, what are you talking about? I'm talking about religion that's called it okay. &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT I'M TALKING ABOUT CONFUSED THEOLOGIANS THAT HAVE TAKEN OUR FOCUS OFF OF THE STANDARDS OF THE WORD OF GOD AND THE POWER OF GOD. SAID THE REVIVAL FIRES ARE DIMIN. NOW LISTEN, I DON'T HAVE TO JUST HIT ON BOOKS. I can hit on movies. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Are we are we are we are we keeping the standards? Are we keeping our center of traction on the word or &gt;&gt; Oh God, folks, it's the truth. &gt;&gt; SEEING THE GREAT REVIVAL FIRES BEGIN TO DUMB DIM DOWN, LET US FIND ANOTHER MOVIE AND LET US FIND THE NEW BOOK and find the new country SONG OR NEW ROCK AND LET US THROW ON SOME WOOD OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; COME ON. IF THE FIRE IS GOING DOWN, THAT AIN'T THE TIME TO MISS CHURCH. IF THE FIRE IS GOING DOWN, THAT AIN'T IT TIME TO BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE PERVERSION OF LEODYSA. THAT'S THE TIME TO GET IN THIS MESSAGE AND DIG YOU OUT SOME LOGS AND BEGIN TO THROW THE LOGS. COME ON, CHURCH. LET ME ASK ONE TIME, THEY SAID, "WHY IN THE WORLD, AMEN, DO YOU POST QUOTES ON FACEBOOK ALL THE TIME?" I SAID, "CUZ MAYBE SOMEBODY MIGHT SEE SOMETHING WORTH LOOKING at one time." &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. WE ADVERTISE EVERYTHING ELSE. WHY DON'T WE ADVERTISE THE POWER OF GOD? WHY DON'T WE ADVERTISE THE MESSAGE OF IT? WHY DON'T WE ADVERTISE THAT OVER HERE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IN BLACK ROCKCK, ARKANSAS, THERE IS A GOD WHO'S A SAVIOR? THERE'S A GOD WHO IS A HEALER. THERE'S A GOD WHO'S A DELIVERER. THERE'S A GOD WHO'S MOVING AND HEALING AND DELIVERING &gt;&gt; IF I BE LIFTED UP. Somebody say, "What are you talking about?" Amen. I don't just want it to be A POSTER BOARD. AMEN. I DON'T THINK our best sign of this church ought to be out there on the highway. &gt;&gt; IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SIGN AND THANK GOD FOR IT, BROTHER BOBBY. AMEN. I DON'T THINK THE BEST SIGN OUGHT TO BE AT THE END OF THE CHURCH ROAD. I THINK IT OUGHT TO BE THE CHARACTER OF THIS MESSAGE REFLECTED IN EVERY MEMBER OF THIS ASSEMBLY. &gt;&gt; I SAY, "GOD, START WITH ME, LORD." &gt;&gt; SEE, Satan is very strategic in his attacks. He knows his timing. Oh, yeah. Devil knows his timing. What is timing? Now, look here. when he when he sends his distractions is when he's got it timed down just right. Now, brother B said this, there's a purpose in him sending them distractions. Y'all still love me? &gt;&gt; There's a purpose in him sending them distractions. You know what it is? It's to rob you of the moment. &gt;&gt; It's to rob you of the moment. Now, watch this. The thief cometh not but for to bless you and to encourage you. THE THIEF COMETH NOT BUT FOR TO steal and TO KILL AND TO DESTROY. BUT I IF I BE LIFTED UP, I AM COME THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE LIFE AND THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE IT MORE ABUNDANTLY. Now look here. Amen. AMEN. SOMEBODY SAY, "WHY ARE YOU PREACHING THIS?" I'VE been this for about two weeks. It's been in my not. Here we are. Can we preach a second? AMEN. COME LADY, HOW DO YOU DO LADY? COME HERE JUST A MINUTE. NO, MOTHER. I NOW WATCH THE DEVIL'S TIMING. OKAY, brother the discernment. He says, I WANT YOU TO RAISE UP. RAISE HER UP. DON'T LAY DOWN. LOOK HERE AT ME. DO you believe me TO BE GOD'S PROPHET? DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT you're hearing is the truth? Are you ready for this? YOU'RE GETTING AWFULLY SICK, aren't you? IS THE REASON YOU'RE DOING THAT. SATAN IS TRYING TO ROB YOU. &gt;&gt; COME ON. SHE'S BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT FOR YEARS TO BE SITTING SIS IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD WITH THE PROPHET OF GOD TO PRAY FOR HER AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE STARTS GETTING AWFULLY SICK. WHY DIDN'T SHE GET AWFULLY SICK AT THE HOUSE? WHY DIDN'T SHE GET AWFULLY SICK? AMEN. DURING THE SONG SERVICE, BROTHER DAY PAUL, WHY DIDN'T SHE GET AWFULLY SICK WHILE HE WAS PREACHING? BUT RIGHT THERE, THAT OLD STRATEGIC DEVIL HAD SO TIMED IT DOWN. AND IF HE COULD JUST GET HER ATTENTION ON A DISTRACTION AND GET HER REAL SICK, HE SAID, "SATAN'S TRYING TO ROB YOU. BUT IF YOU'LL BELIEVE ME TO BE HIS SERVANT TONIGHT, YOUR DELIVERANCE IS HERE. YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY TO COME HERE, HAVEN'T YOU?" Here's another one. Here's a man sitting in front of me. He has suffered with arthritis. I don't know whether he's going to get it or not. He's kind of a man about my age. HE SUFFERS WITH ARTHRITIS. HE IS NOT FROM HERE. HE IS FROM KANSAS CITY. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT GOD WILL HEAL YOU? DO YOU BELIEVE GOD CAN TELL ME WHAT YOUR NAME IS? MR. FRANCIS, do you BELIEVE WITH ALL YOUR heart he was trying to rob you from it, sir? You was thinking I was meaning another man, but it was you. AND WHEN I SAID THAT, A REAL FUNNY FEELING COME OVER YOU real sweet AND WARM. IF THAT'S RIGHT, WAVE YOUR HAND LIKE THIS. Now go your way. You're healed. Glory to God. ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME TONIGHT? THAT DEVIL'S TIME RIGHT NOW. HE'S TRYING TO DISTRACT. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? WHEN THE PREACHER'S PREACHING, THAT DEVIL STARTS TRYING TO DISTRACT YOU. WELL, HE'S HITTING THE THIS AND HE'S HITTING THAT AND HE OH, NO. AMEN. WHY DON'T YOU STAND UP AND LOOK THAT DEVIL IN THE FACE AND SAY, "I KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. HE'S PREACHING THE WORD." AND THROWING some logs of the WOOD OF THE WORD ON THE FIRE TO BURN. I SEE A MAN I believe it was DOWN THERE HERE THE OTHER MEETING said now now look here not everybody got it &gt;&gt; he said I see a man sitting here and the Holy Spirit I've been watching him when I was preaching he was a crippled man he had crutches under his arm and just when I started to make the call Satan come to the man a black shadow and I watched it with my own eyes he got up and walked out. Now, folks, you may not do that physically, &gt;&gt; but don't you let the devil make you do that mentally? &gt;&gt; Word of God gets to being preached, the pastor, the man of God, whoever stand there preaching the word and the devil says, "Oh, well, listen. Let me tell you what this is about." And you listen to that devil and you just get up and check out mentally. Well, he ain't got no business saying that. He ain't got no right preaching. This is what a pro OF GOD SAID. HE GOT UP AND WALKED OUT, HE'LL ALWAYS BE A CRIPPLED. SO WERE HE BE HEALED RIGHT HERE. IF HE WOULD HAVE JUST SEE, BUT YOU I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY. ARE Y'ALL READY FOR THIS? I'M BRINGING THIS DOWN RIGHT HERE. ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? I GUESS HE JUST LISTENED to the enemy. So you mean in a service you got a chance to listen to the word &gt;&gt; or listen to the enemy? &gt;&gt; SEE, GOD LIKENS PEOPLE UNTO SHEEP. And sheep are wonders. THEY'RE CONFUSED. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE. The shepherd's calls are coming from everywhere. But Jesus said, "The sheep follow him, for they know his voice, and a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him, for they know not the voice of strangers." Look at this word stranger. It's another man's, other men's, belonging to another, a foreigner, a stranger, not of one's own family. an alien, an enemy. Rebraham said, "See, you can't die. You're done quickening." Or if the church could only see that, it's not what you're going to be. You already are. It's the devil trying to rob you from that. &gt;&gt; Well, SAY, "NOW, I TELL YOU, I BELONG TO THIS." I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU belong to. You got to be born, REGENERATED, BAPTIZED WITH THE HOLY Ghost into Jesus Christ, quickened to every word. Your spirit in you will punctuate amen to every word OF THE BIBLE. OUTSIDE OF THAT, IF IT SHAKES ITS HEAD ON ONE, YOU GET RID OF THAT SPIRIT. IT'S NOT THE SPIRIT OF GOD THAT would dispute the word of God. &gt;&gt; It'll keep the word of God. Not only does it believe it, but it makes it live. It manifests the word of God. But by one spirit, we're all baptized into one body. And that body is a family. the family of God. And that's the house of God. And the house of God is the name of Jesus Christ. Look here. I have chosen to put my name at the door of the house of my worship. For my family will be gathered in there under the blood like it was in Egypt. Anything outside. And in there, are y'all ready for this? In there, there's no leaven bread. There's no denominational mixture in it anywhere. IT'S MY HOUSE. MY CHILDREN BORN to my genes. My genes are in them. I put my word in them. I'll write them up on the TABLES OF THEIR HEART. THAT'S MY FAMILY. THE FAMILY of the body of Jesus Christ. Oh my. Satan sends distractions in all kinds of forms. He tried to distract Elisha from that double portion by the critics and unbelievers. Brother said he tried to distract Peter from getting to Jesus with the winds on the water. He got his eyes off of Jesus and began to look at how big the waves was. When he seen the waves were contrary, he began to sink. Are y'all ready for this tonight? And every man that will look at his affliction after being prayed for &gt;&gt; is sure to sink. &gt;&gt; What about every man that'll that'll hear the word of God and go back to doing things that the word of God condemns? &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm in the message. You don't look at your affliction. You keep your EYES ON THE PROMISEGIVER, THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. YOU KEEP YOUR EYES ON HIS WORD. HE'S THE ONE WHO PROMISED. HE WATCHES OVER IT to perform it. He keeps it in the hollow OF HIS HAND. AND IN the depths of his heart, it's beded. His word has to be true. Get your mind off your sickness, off your troubles, and keep your eyes on Jesus. If I be lifted up, I will draw a men to myself. Let our musicians come tonight. What is the attraction? My I got a whole message here. What is the attraction? Brother said, "Here it is." He said, "It's God fulfilling his word." Now, folks, I know I know maybe sometimes somebody say, "Well, I don't I don't I don't understand why the word has got to be so hard." Well, really, the word's not that hard. It's not. Reb said the word's a love letter. &gt;&gt; But I'll just say this to you. The Holy Spirit draws by an instinct, by an inward power. I think of how, and I'll just I'll just close on this. I think of how when you're really when you're really in love with something, when you're really identified in something, when you're really when you're really connected to something, that no matter what you're going through, when you begin to look at it, it'll begin to pull you out. Y'all y'all ever y'all ever experienced that? I sitting in my office today studying and I got a chair in the corner of my office and then there's a window on the other side of the of my office here, Brother David. And and there's a scripture that the Lord gave me when I first started preaching, when I got ordained, when God called me in the ministry and the my pastor at the time and brother Bill ordained me in the ministry. There was a scripture the Lord gave me. It was Acts chapter 20 verse 24. I don't know if maybe you could pull that up for me if there's anybody up there. I I'll just say it to you like this. I was sitting in my office today and I was preaching. And I think I was up somewhere and brother brother Isaac Hatfield heard me say that that the Lord gave me that scripture and that the Lord gave it to me in my heart and just I told the little bit the testimony of it and brother Isaac heard it and I don't know it's about two or three weeks later I got a package on the front door. Brother David it was a it was a picture frame of the cloud and it had the cloud turned and on the on the writing on that was that scripture Acts chapter 20 verse 24 and I and it was it was just just printed right there on it. And so I actually when I when I when I got it, I hung it up above a window just just right there. And you ever you ever just get discouraged and two of you, three of you, you ever just get real down? See, but if there's something you're connected to ever gets lifted up where you can see it and brother Mark, I sit in my office today and just going through some thoughts in my mind and battles and pressures and situations and and you know, even preachers go through that. And I just I was just sitting there. I don't know. I'll find it here real quick. I want to read it to you. I was just sitting there in my office. And while I was sitting there, I just started praying. I was listening to a tape and something in my heart just said, "Look up." And brother, I just looked up and when I looked up, my eyes fell on that picture. And that verse says this, "None of these things move me. Neither count I my life DEAR UNTO MYSELF SO THAT I MIGHT finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received of the LORD JESUS TO TESTIFY THE gospel of the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Brother Bryant, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, BUT IT WAS LIKE A HAND JUST COME RIGHT DOWN IN THAT LITTLE office out THERE AND JUST PULLED ME RIGHT UP OUT OF THAT. ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME? THAT SAME GOD IS RIGHT HERE IN THIS BUILDING TONIGHT. LISTEN, NO MATTER HOW LOW YOU ARE, BROTHER TRAVIS, NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, IF I BE LIFTED UP, NOT THE PREACHER, BROTHER CARTER, NOT A MAN, BUT IF CHRIST BE LIFTED UP, WHO IS YOUR LIFE, WHO IS YOUR SALVATION, AND YOU CAN LOOK AT HIM, SISTER JOYCE, HE'LL PULL YOU RIGHT OUT OF WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. Y'all believe that tonight? Won't you stand to your feet with us tonight? See, what he is is he's the inside. He's the inside. He's the inside. And if I be lifted up, if I be lifted up, I'll draw all men unto myself. See, but before an end sign can have an effect, it's got to be lifted. Before it can have a before it can affect you, Brother Brian, it's got to be up so high you can see it. I remember I remember a brother told me one time he said he said I was preaching in a church and while I was preaching I read a quote and I said brother Brandham said he said some man in the crowd hollered out and said who's brother Brandham. I kind of chuckled. He said what's so funny? I said well cuz they ain't never lifted the message up high enough so they can see what's going on in the church. See unless an in sign is lifted it'll never have an effect. Do you know Sister Beth and the inside will never affect you until you can see it? Remember that serpent on the pole? If you were bitten, had to be raised up and then you had to look and live. It couldn't just be on the pole. It had to be lifted where somebody could put their eyes on it. And brother Bobby, they could concentrate on it. And as they concentrated on it, healing virtue would begin to come to their life. But it had to be lifted. Listen, I don't know about you tonight, but I'm not afraid to raise my hand and say, "I am not ashamed of this message. I am not ashamed of the standards of a prophet taught. I AM NOT ASHAMED TO SAY, "LORD, whatever it takes in my life to circumcise me, keep the revival fires burning." I'm not ashamed of it. It's an insign. It's a rallying point. It's the attraction of my life. I remember back in the summer, I was over in in Czech Republic. I flew in there to preach and the brother text me. He said, "There's going to be a young man to pick you up at the airport." It's kind of I'm kind of probably getting ahead of myself, but I feel like telling it tonight. Gonna be a young boy pick up at the airport. Said, "Now, now you've never seen him before, but he'll be holding a picture." And it'll be a picture, Brother Brandham with the pillar of fire over his head and said, "He'll be holding that picture and said, "Look for him, and when you see him, go with him." Brother Ryan, when I walked out of the airport, there was a lot of people standing there holding pictures and cards and signs, but there was one little boy over in the corner and he had his picture up real high and I turned my head up. &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of people SAYING, "YOU NEED A WELL, they weren't saying it like that. You need a taxi. You need a ride. You need Hey, hey, YOU NEED A RIDE. HEY, HEY, YOU NEED AND BROTHER, I JUST WALKED RIGHT THROUGH THEM WITH MY HEAD UP CUZ MY EYES HAD CAUGHT MY IDENTIFYING. MY EYES HAD CAUGHT WHAT I'M IDENTIFYING WITH. AND I WAS WALKING ABOVE ALL THE DISTRACTIONS. I WAS WALKING ABOVE ALL THE VOICES. I WAS NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO ANY OF IT BECAUSE I WAS CONCENTRATED ON WHAT COME TO PICK ME UP. CHURCH, THIS MESSAGE HAS COME TO CARRY YOU OUT OF THIS WORLD. &gt;&gt; Lift your eyes up tonight and focus on it. Ignore the distractions. Almighty God, we bow our hearts in your presence tonight. Lord, your word is true. Father, I believe you're right here in this building tonight speaking to hearts and lives. Lord, I know the enemy's come in like a flood. And Lord, to say some of these things are not popular, Lord, are not. Lord, it's become an age where it seems as if no one wants to just just slow down and say things a prophet said. Lord, sometimes you got to dig into it. And Lord, you got to you got to find that that meat of this message, Lord. But Lord, there's one thing about it. Sometimes a prophet will dig real deep into it. Sometimes he'll he'll just hit it as he's preaching along and keep on moving. But Lord, if we'll just stay concentrated on it, no matter if it's a high spot, a low spot, Lord, if it's a corrective spot, if it's a if it's a blessing spot, if it's a shouting spot, Lord, Lord, THERE'S NO PART OF THIS MESSAGE that we have to bypass. There's no part of this message, Lord, that's a distraction. Lord, your prophet said it's that third pull. It's that one I must be loyal and reverent to. Lord, I believe right here tonight there's a group of believers that have gathered themselves inside of this sanctuary on a Wednesday evening. Lord, maybe the devil's trying to distract him. Lord, maybe the devil's trying to beset him in some way or trying to reroute him. Lord, father, as I was just hearing your prophet say yesterday in victory day, he said when a Christian gets so close to victory, he said that's when the devil begins to reroute them and try to reroute their path. I thought, "Oh, God, don't let that be said about one believer here tonight. Lord, DON'T LET THAT BE SAID ABOUT A ONE OF US TONIGHT that Lord, we were so close to victory, but we let the devil in his strategic, slimy, shrewd way come in and reroute us. Lord, don't let it be said that we got our eyes off of the focus. We got our eyes off of the attraction and we got our eyes over on the distractions, LORD. BUT LORD, LET US BE LIKE MARTHA, FATHER.
