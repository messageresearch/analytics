[36:47] Oh, I've been changed.
[36:51] Oh, and I won't go back. Can't go back
[36:56] to the way used to be before your spirit
[37:00] came and changed me. Oh, and I won't go
[37:05] back. Can't go back to the way it used
[37:09] to be before your spirit. Oh, I sing it
[37:13] again now. All my shame, oh my shame,
[37:18] all my kids.
[37:20] Oh, all my all where they've
[37:24] been forgiven.
[37:26] Now there's no more chains.
[37:30] Oh, no fears.
[37:33] away. My past,
[37:36] my past is over.
[37:39] And right now is the moment. Oh, today
[37:43] is the day I've been changed.
[37:47] Oh, I've been changed.
[37:51] Oh, hey, I won't go back. Can't go back
[37:55] to the way you used to be. Lord, your
[37:59] spirit came and changed me. Oh, and I
[38:04] won't go back. Can't go back to the way
[38:08] it used to be.
[38:10] I'll sing the chorus once again.
[38:13] Oh, and I won't go back. I can't go back
[38:19] to the way it used to be before your
[38:22] spirit came and changed me. Oh, and I
[38:27] won't go back. I can't go back to the
[38:31] way it used to be. Lord, your spirit
[38:35] came and changed me. Oh, if you're
[38:38] thankful he came and changed you, why
[38:39] don't you give him a hand clap of praise
[38:41] this morning?
[38:44] Oh, and what can wash away my sins? Oh,
[38:49] and nothing but the blood of my Jesus.
[38:53] Oh, and what can make me whole again?
[38:58] Yes. Nothing but the blood of my jeans.
[39:03] I'm singing. Oh, how precious is that?
[39:08] Oh, that makes me wide as
[39:13] [Music]
[39:29] of Jesus.
[39:32] [Music]
[39:35] All the gel
[39:37] of the blood of Jesus.
[39:42] Oh, precious. He's the f that makes me w
[39:49] as snow. No other ground. I know.

[40:00] will now find this. I'll overcome.
[40:05] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[40:09] will now by this I'll reach my home.
[40:14] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[40:19] will hold. Precious is the flow that
[40:25] makes me white as snow. Amen. I want you
[40:29] just get out your seat this morning and
[40:30] welcome somebody in the house of the
[40:32] Lord. Well, nothing but the blood of
[40:35] Jesus.
[40:38] Well, nothing can for sin atone.
[40:42] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[40:47] The heart of good that I have done.

[41:35] precious
[41:37] the flow that makes me white as snow. No
[41:45] other mothers
[41:46] I know. Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[41:56] Amen. Aren't you glad we have a place to
[41:58] turn to this morning? Amen. Nothing but
[42:02] the blood of Jesus has made a way for
[42:04] each one of us. Amen. I sure appreciate
[42:07] our sister song here this morning. Now,
[42:10] what a tremendous uh word of
[42:12] encouragement that upon the shoulders of
[42:16] one was carried our sin. Amen. And he he
[42:19] he died a sinner that I might be saved
[42:22] by grace. Ain't that isn't that
[42:23] wonderful this morning that that he died
[42:26] and I rose free. Amen. We didn't even
[42:28] have to die the death. But we just
[42:30] certainly thank God for all that he's
[42:31] done for us. Do you love the Lord this
[42:33] morning? Amen. How many say it's good to
[42:35] be in the house of the Lord and Amen. We
[42:37] just certainly appreciate all that God
[42:40] does for us. We just want to remember uh
[42:42] those that are sick this morning in in
[42:45] uh in prayer and it's that right there.
[42:50] Can you mute it?
[42:52] Thank you. Um the the um just remember
[42:55] those in prayer and and uh that are
[42:58] sick. I know Sister Mariah just had her
[43:00] baby yesterday and and so we just thank
[43:03] God for uh bringing them out well and
[43:06] had a beautiful little baby girl. And so
[43:08] we certainly appreciate the Lord for
[43:11] that. And I know there's many that are
[43:13] still in need and many that are sick and
[43:16] uh remember brother Tom really wants to
[43:18] be here and be a few more weeks and and
[43:22] so just waiting on a doctor report for
[43:24] him. So just remember him in prayer and
[43:27] also sister Lillian. We can't wait to
[43:29] have her back with us and sure
[43:31] appreciate sister Tanisha and laboring
[43:34] and playing the piano for us and just
[43:36] been tremendous. God bless you.
[43:43] And she don't she don't make a a deal
[43:46] out of it, but her hands really bother
[43:48] her and so it's hard for her to play
[43:50] service after service, beginning and
[43:52] end. and and but she's labored to be
[43:55] able to be here and and a lot of times
[43:58] needs to be home and she helps take care
[44:01] of her dad. That's and so we just just
[44:04] thank God that she's able to come and
[44:06] and uh be here and so just remember her
[44:09] in prayer and thank her for her labor
[44:10] and remember brother Randall many uh
[44:13] needs this morning. So, let's just bow
[44:15] our heads together and if you have
[44:16] something on your heart that I believe
[44:18] that God is more than able, he knows
[44:20] what we have need of and and may he just
[44:22] give us something encouraging out of the
[44:24] word this morning. Let's just let's just
[44:26] pray to him. Gracious heavenly father,
[44:29] Lord, how we love you, Lord. And God,
[44:31] we're so thankful of all that you you do
[44:34] for us. And Lord, we just see your hand,
[44:37] Lord, that is working among the church.
[44:39] And Lord, so many lives and testimonies
[44:41] and things that have been done, Lord.
[44:44] And we just are so thankful, Lord, just
[44:46] to be in your midst, Lord, and seeing
[44:49] the hand of God moving. And Lord, we
[44:52] just ask you this morning, Lord, that
[44:53] you would meet each one here. And God,
[44:56] you know our our needs, Lord, what we
[44:59] have need of, Lord. We know every
[45:01] failure, every mistake. And Lord, we
[45:03] just ask you to have mercy upon us,
[45:05] Lord, this morning. And God, may you
[45:07] come and speak to your children. And
[45:09] God, may you be a blessing to the church
[45:11] this morning, Lord. That we would leave
[45:13] this place encouraged by the word of
[45:15] God. Lord, we just love you. And we
[45:17] thank you for all you do for us, Lord.
[45:19] And we'll be careful to give you the
[45:20] glory. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[45:23] pray. Amen.
[45:26] Amen. God bless you this morning. We
[45:27] just want to invite you to the
[45:29] scripture. Uh we're going to read out of
[45:31] the book of Hebrews in the sixth chapter
[45:35] and we'll read uh start in the 13th
[45:38] verse and going to try to something I've
[45:41] been studying on and uh try to lay a
[45:44] foundation on it this morning. And but
[45:47] Hebrews the 6th chapter, we'll read from
[45:49] the 13th uh down to the 19th verse.
[45:53] Amen. And how many feels good this
[45:55] morning? Amen. Amen. Just sure good to
[45:57] be back with you and and uh just
[46:00] appreciate all the the brothers and the
[46:02] labor and that everyone does and I just
[46:04] an awesome church and I can't think of a
[46:07] better place I'd rather be this morning
[46:08] and sitting in the house of God and uh
[46:11] with with believers of like precious
[46:13] faith and fellowshipping around the word
[46:14] of God and it's just wonderful. God
[46:16] bless you. Greet our visitors. Welcome
[46:18] this morning. Amen. So we want to read
[46:20] Hebrews the 6th chapter out of the 13th
[46:22] verse. The Bible says, "For when God
[46:25] made promise to Abraham, because he
[46:28] could swear by no greater, he swear by
[46:30] himself, saying, Surely blessing, I will
[46:33] bless thee,
[46:35] and multiplying I will multiply thee."
[46:37] And so, after he had patiently after he
[46:41] had patiently endured, he obtained the
[46:43] promise. For men verilely swear by the
[46:46] greater, and an oath for confirmation is
[46:48] to them an end of all strife, wherein
[46:51] God willing more abundantly to show unto
[46:53] the heirs of promise the immutability of
[46:56] his counsel, confirmed it by an oath,
[46:59] that by two immutable things, in which
[47:02] it was impossible for God to lie, that
[47:04] we might have a strong consolation, who
[47:07] have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
[47:10] the hope set before us. which hope we
[47:13] have as an anchor of the soul. And we'll
[47:16] just ask the Lord to add his blessing to
[47:18] the reading of the word this morning as
[47:20] you take your seats. And uh I would like
[47:22] to speak on when impossibility
[47:26] meets immutability. When impossibility
[47:29] meets immutability, I know this is a
[47:32] very uh common scripture we've read uh
[47:35] many times and uh studied on Apostle
[47:37] Paul and any that's ever listened to the
[47:39] Hebrews uh series. there's uh there's
[47:42] quite uh uh great revelation uh laying
[47:45] there and and it always it always brings
[47:49] uh courage or encourages the church
[47:51] church to have revelation and so uh it's
[47:54] something that we think uh that we
[47:56] certainly thank God for and and one one
[47:58] thing brother Bram says I just want to
[48:01] uh kind of lay this as a foundation he
[48:02] said there's one thing about the word of
[48:04] God is that it never grows old because
[48:07] it's God it never grows old through
[48:09] every generation for 28 800 years or
[48:12] better, this word of God has been read
[48:14] by men and priests and it never does
[48:16] grow old. I've been reading it for some
[48:18] 35 years. Each time I read it, I find
[48:20] something new that I looked over the
[48:22] first time. And because it is inspired
[48:24] by God, it is in letter form. It's the
[48:27] attributes of God speaking forth and
[48:29] placed on paper. I wonder how many today
[48:31] that could say that that that they've
[48:33] been reading this same uh Bible for 30
[48:36] years. How many can say that you've been
[48:37] reading it for 30 plus years? Go ahead
[48:39] and raise your hand. Let everybody see
[48:40] that that you've been How many's has
[48:42] been reading it for more than 40 years?
[48:43] And maybe maybe there's still some that
[48:45] uh that's been reading it for 50 years.
[48:47] Y'all go ahead and just show your age.
[48:48] It's okay. Everybody can look around.
[48:50] But many that's been more than 50 years
[48:52] that's been reading this same Bible. And
[48:54] I wonder that as you've been reading it,
[48:56] you would have that same testimony this
[48:58] morning that every time I read it, I
[49:00] find something that I looked over the
[49:02] first time I read it. Here, a prophet of
[49:04] God that had a great revelation. And he
[49:06] said, "But I I find something new every
[49:08] time I read it because it is inspired.
[49:10] It is God in letter form, and it's the
[49:13] attributes of God speaking forth and
[49:15] placed on paper." Isn't it something
[49:16] that the word of God is so alive that
[49:19] that that it can speak something to
[49:21] every little need that you have, any uh
[49:23] something that you're going through that
[49:25] there's something there that uh that God
[49:26] can just bring alive right whenever you
[49:28] need. He said, "See, many times people
[49:30] say that the Bible was written by men."
[49:32] He said, "But it couldn't have been
[49:33] written by men. It was written by God."
[49:34] And even the even the Bible says it it
[49:36] was written by God. It was God's word.
[49:38] It is the word of God and it can never
[49:40] fail. Jesus said, "Heavens and earth
[49:42] shall pass away, but my word shall never
[49:44] pass away. Men's words will fail, but
[49:47] God's words will never fail." He said,
[49:49] "It can't fail because it's God and
[49:51] being a part of him, it can't fail."
[49:53] Said, "Then what about you this morning?
[49:54] Being a son and a daughter of God. If
[49:56] you are a part of it, it makes you a
[49:58] part of him." And that's why we can come
[50:00] and fellowship together around the word
[50:02] of God. So if God can't fail and God's
[50:05] word can't fail, then if you ever have
[50:07] that word on the inside of you, that's
[50:09] why we'll never fail. That's why we'll
[50:10] make it. That's the uh that's the very
[50:12] promise that's laying in the Bible
[50:14] today. So that's why we come to the
[50:16] house of God. We come today uh Sister
[50:18] Nisha for that very purpose is to
[50:20] fellowship around the word of God. And
[50:22] we we come to draw strength from the
[50:24] word. We come to draw courage from it. I
[50:27] thought, you know, in an age of lies and
[50:29] in an age of deceit, it you can't turn
[50:31] on the news without seeing somebody
[50:33] lying to somebody. Everybody's trying to
[50:35] deceive somebody to get them to follow
[50:37] after their cause. But I think in the
[50:39] age of all the lies, in the age of all
[50:41] the deceit, I thank God that we have a
[50:43] place to go that we can just hear truth.
[50:45] How many say amen? That there that there
[50:47] ain't no motive. There's no there's no
[50:49] outside agenda that we just can come and
[50:51] open up and hear the truth of God's
[50:53] word. friends, I've never heard of an
[50:55] age that needed truth more than the age
[50:57] that we're living in. I I've never seen
[50:59] a people that needed truth more than the
[51:01] people that uh that we uh are around
[51:03] today. And that's why Jesus said, he
[51:05] said, "If you abide in my word, you will
[51:07] know the truth, and the truth will set
[51:09] you free." That that's what we need
[51:10] today. We need the truth of God's word.
[51:13] That's that's what the Bible said in in
[51:15] First John, he said, "Let us love with
[51:17] words. Let us not love with words or
[51:19] speech, but with actions and in truth."
[51:22] So I believe the word of God, this truth
[51:24] of God's word, when we come to this uh
[51:27] this house of worship, brother Mark, we
[51:29] come expecting to hear truth. How many
[51:31] say amen? And not only do we come
[51:33] expecting to hear truth, but we come
[51:35] expecting to see truth in action. Say,
[51:38] see, so God's truth is is something
[51:40] that's active. His truth is is something
[51:42] that has been made alive. And you know,
[51:44] it doesn't matter what it looks like on
[51:46] the outside or how we feel. I I I
[51:49] believe that this morning that when it
[51:50] doesn't seem like God is moving and it
[51:52] doesn't seem like that that your prayer
[51:55] is being answered in the way it should
[51:57] be and sometimes it feels that way. I I
[51:59] may as well just lay it out there. But
[52:00] sometimes we feel abandoned by God.
[52:02] Sometimes we feel like we pray and God
[52:04] isn't hearing us and God isn't answering
[52:06] and God isn't moving quick enough and
[52:08] and things aren't happening like they
[52:10] should. But friends, regardless of how
[52:12] we feel, there's one thing that we
[52:14] realize is that God is a present God.
[52:17] How many say amen? Regardless of what we
[52:19] feel like this morning, that God is
[52:20] present. He's present among his church.
[52:23] He's present among his people. He's
[52:25] present among his children. And he comes
[52:27] to us in the form of the spirit of
[52:29] truth. So when you hear truth, you're
[52:31] hearing God. When you hear truth, it's a
[52:33] it's a a proof or a vindication that God
[52:36] is present among you because God only
[52:39] speaks truth. The Bible said he is the
[52:40] spirit of truth. He was and when he
[52:42] comes, we receive him. Brother Brian, we
[52:44] when whenever truth walks in the door,
[52:46] there's a people that will receive the
[52:48] spirit of truth. That's what Jesus said.
[52:50] He said, "When the spirit of truth, the
[52:52] world can't receive him, but you as
[52:54] believers, we receive him." He said,
[52:55] "The world seeth him not. They don't
[52:57] know him." He said, "But you know him
[52:59] because he dwelleth with you and he
[53:02] shall be in you. And I will not leave
[53:04] you comfortless, but I will come to
[53:06] you." So Jesus said, "I am the spirit of
[53:09] truth and I will not leave you." So here
[53:11] when we hear truth this morning, you
[53:12] say, "Well, why why are we why are we
[53:14] talking about this this morning?"
[53:16] Because I want you to realize that the
[53:17] spirit of truth is the presence of Jesus
[53:20] Christ and he's among the church this
[53:22] morning presenting himself to you as
[53:25] this great spirit of truth. And I I
[53:27] believe that he's here. He said, "I will
[53:28] not leave you comfortless." I believe,
[53:30] how many believe that we have a truth
[53:31] this morning? So if you believe that we
[53:33] have a truth and you believe that we're
[53:35] not left comfortless and we're we're not
[53:36] left without God, but God is present
[53:38] among his church. I I believe that. And
[53:40] I believe he's still Jehovah Shama. I
[53:42] believe he's a he's a present God. That
[53:44] brother Mark was preaching it the other
[53:45] day. He's a present God. He's he's
[53:48] Jehovah Gyra. He He's all of those great
[53:50] redemptive names that was written in the
[53:52] Old Testament. Jesus Christ has
[53:54] fulfilled every one of them. How many
[53:56] believe that? He's Jehovah Gyra. He was
[53:58] our sacrifice. He was Jehovah Rafa, our
[54:00] healer. Jehovah Nissi, our banner.
[54:03] Jehovah Shalom. He was our peace.
[54:05] Jehovah Rahi, our our shepherd. Jehovah
[54:08] Sidkanu. The Lord is our righteousness.
[54:11] And you know when you can read every one
[54:13] of those great redemptive names, they
[54:15] can be found in the Old Testament. Each
[54:17] one of them represent the nature of who
[54:20] Jesus Christ was. They are each one a
[54:23] part of the character of God. And you
[54:25] know, I I think it's wonderful to read
[54:27] about the character of God here that God
[54:29] is a healer and God is a savior and God
[54:32] isn't a deliverer. Doesn't it give you
[54:34] courage to read about the character of
[54:35] God? that God is a He He's one that that
[54:38] that can overcome. He's an overcomer.
[54:40] He's one that can take people out of
[54:42] trouble. He can He can take those
[54:44] through a fiery furnace. He can take you
[54:46] through a den of lions. He can take you
[54:48] through a battlefield with a great
[54:49] Goliath. I love to hear about the
[54:51] character of my God. And and when you
[54:54] hear about this great character of God
[54:56] and you see, Brother Bobby, that he
[54:57] fulfills all of these great redemptive
[54:59] names. You know, I thought about it. I
[55:01] thought, but what good is all of those
[55:03] great characteristics of God if God
[55:05] isn't in our midst? What good is a
[55:07] savior if a savior isn't here? What good
[55:10] is a healer if the healer isn't here?
[55:12] What good is a deliverer if a deliverer
[55:14] isn't here? What what good is a shepherd
[55:16] if the shepherd isn't present among us?
[55:18] So, friends, I say this today that I
[55:20] thank God that he is Jehovah Shama. I
[55:23] thank God that he that he's here and
[55:25] he's present among us. It wouldn't it
[55:27] wouldn't matter. It wouldn't matter to
[55:29] anybody that God was a healer. If God
[55:31] wasn't present to heal you, it wouldn't
[55:33] matter if God was a savior if he wasn't
[55:35] present to save you. So that's what
[55:37] matters this morning. That he is Jehovah
[55:39] Shama and he is present among his church
[55:42] and and he's working among his children
[55:44] and he's here this morning. How many say
[55:45] amen?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; I believe that God is here. He's Jehovah
[55:49] Shama. That's what really matters. But
[55:51] Abraham says, "When a man once catches
[55:53] that vision of the invisible God and he
[55:56] knows that he's always present, there is
[55:58] something that stabilizes that man's
[56:00] thinking, it stabilizes his actions. And
[56:02] in the time of distress and trouble,
[56:05] it'll still make him look upward and
[56:07] above the things that are happening
[56:08] around him because he's looking at the
[56:10] unseen yet by promise." Now, isn't this
[56:13] something that stabilizes a man's
[56:15] thinking when he catches the vision of
[56:17] an invisible God and he realizes that
[56:20] God is always present? Friends, don't
[56:22] that don't you realize that's what we
[56:24] need to do this morning is to catch a
[56:26] vision of an invisible God. Brother
[56:29] Bobby, how many can catch the vision
[56:31] this morning of an invisible God? That's
[56:33] why we tell testimonies and preach of
[56:35] the of the nature of God and tell the
[56:37] stories that are in the Bible so that
[56:39] you can see that God is working in the
[56:41] Old Testament that that same God can
[56:43] work in your life. It's to get you to
[56:45] catch the vision of an invisible God and
[56:48] to know that God is present among you to
[56:50] do the same work that he's always done.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Said see when we can catch that vision
[56:54] it stabilizes a man's thinking. You know
[56:56] there's very there's many examples of it
[56:58] in the Bible that very thing. That's
[57:00] what Isaiah said. He said, "Fear not,
[57:02] for I am with thee."
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Fear not, for I Somebody say, "I am with
[57:06] thee."
[57:06] &gt;&gt; I am with thee.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Be not dismayed, for I am thy God.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; I will strengthen you. I will help you,
[57:11] and I will uphold you with the right
[57:13] hand of my righteousness. See, there's
[57:16] many times I've got a I've got 20
[57:17] scriptures. I'm not going to read them
[57:18] all, but I got a bunch of scriptures uh
[57:21] many times that the Bible would tell us
[57:22] that God is with us.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; God is among us. God is in his church.
[57:28] He's with his people. You remember my
[57:30] favorite ones in Ezekiel the 35th
[57:31] chapter whenever God is talking to the
[57:34] land of Edom. And remember Edom was a
[57:36] great uh great uh military might the
[57:39] descendants of Esau and Edom had
[57:41] purposed in their heart to destroy the
[57:43] children of God. They they had came and
[57:45] they remember remember they said they're
[57:47] going to take over Israel and take over
[57:49] Judah and and and so here the Bible
[57:51] would tell us of the destruction that
[57:53] God is bringing upon Edom and and all of
[57:55] the curse that would be upon them and
[57:57] the bloodshed that would happen in the
[57:59] land of Edom and the death that would
[58:01] befall the land of Edom. And when you
[58:02] read Ezekiel 35, you can read it when
[58:05] you go home, but when you read Ezekiel
[58:06] 35, you can see the wrath of God being
[58:09] poured out upon this land of Edom. You
[58:11] say, "Well, what would bring the anger
[58:13] of God upon this this land of Edom?"
[58:15] Here's what God said. He said, "Because
[58:17] you said that unto these nations that
[58:20] these two nations shall be mine, and we
[58:22] will possess it." Speaking of Israel and
[58:24] Judah, "Because you eat them, because
[58:26] you said that Israel and Judah shall be
[58:28] mine." He said, "But you didn't know
[58:30] that I was there." Did you purposed in
[58:34] your heart to destroy them, whereas, but
[58:36] the Lord was there. See, so you see the
[58:38] mistake that Edom made was to not was to
[58:41] assume that God was not in the midst of
[58:43] Israel. You see the enemy? So, so
[58:46] because you assumed that I wasn't there,
[58:48] but here's what here's what you didn't
[58:50] realize, Edom, is that I heard
[58:51] everything you said. I heard the curse
[58:53] that you tried to put on my children. I
[58:55] I heard what you wanted to do to them. I
[58:57] I heard the plans that you had for them.
[58:59] And I heard when you said in your
[59:01] chambers that we're going to bring
[59:02] destruction upon them and and we're
[59:04] going to destroy them and we're going to
[59:05] possess them. Cuz after all, there ain't
[59:07] nothing to them. But I heard everything
[59:09] that you said about them. Friends, don't
[59:11] you think it's something that the
[59:12] mistake that they made was to think that
[59:14] God wasn't in their midst. I thought
[59:16] that's the way it is this morning.
[59:18] That's the mistake that the devil made
[59:20] is to think that God isn't in the midst
[59:22] of the church. Friends, I say trouble
[59:24] may come to your land, but God is in the
[59:26] midst of her. Sickness may come to your
[59:28] home, but God is in the midst of her.
[59:31] Trouble may come to your family, but God
[59:33] is in the midst of her. See, that's the
[59:36] mistake that the devil made is they
[59:38] didn't realize that God was there.
[59:40] Hallelujah. What makes me want to preach
[59:42] this morning to think that God was
[59:44] there. And the devil may not realize it,
[59:46] but let me tell you this this morning,
[59:47] friends, that there ain't no demonic
[59:49] force that can come into your land that
[59:51] God isn't there. There ain't no spirit
[59:53] of the devil that can come into your
[59:55] house that God isn't there. It don't
[59:57] matter what enemy would come about you,
[59:59] they will meet God.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? Your enemies are
[1:00:04] going to meet God.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Listen what he said. He said,
[1:00:06] "Therefore, as I live, says the Lord, I
[1:00:09] will deal with you according to the
[1:00:10] anger that you showed upon my children.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; The very purpose that you had for them,
[1:00:16] I'm going to turn it back on you. I'm
[1:00:18] going to deal with you with the anger
[1:00:19] that you had upon them, and I will make
[1:00:21] myself known among you in judgment."
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; I thought, isn't it something? His
[1:00:27] presence will always be made known. He
[1:00:30] was made known among Israel in grace and
[1:00:32] made known among his children in mercy.
[1:00:35] But when it come to their enemy, he was
[1:00:36] still made known, but he was made known
[1:00:38] in judgment. Well, I thank God we have a
[1:00:40] of a a God that is among us this
[1:00:42] morning.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about your enemy. They'll
[1:00:45] they'll have their place.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; So, see, when he when he met you, he met
[1:00:49] God.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Ain't that powerful? When your enemy met
[1:00:52] you, he met your God. When he when he
[1:00:54] came to your land, he met your God. When
[1:00:56] he comes to your house, he meets your
[1:00:57] God. It ain't you that has to withstand
[1:01:00] him, but when the enemy comes, he's
[1:01:02] going to meet God because God is
[1:01:03] present.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Now, what a statement from God. I want
[1:01:07] you to know that I heard what you said
[1:01:08] about my children.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; You said you was going to pursue him,
[1:01:11] but I was there.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; God was there.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; You said, brother Matt, well, that was
[1:01:16] the Bible. What about now?
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Ram said, see, he said, God's attitude
[1:01:20] towards the people from the first Eden
[1:01:23] all the way to the last Eden.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. is wrapped in those seven
[1:01:26] redemptive names.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; In other words, that God's attitude
[1:01:30] never changes about it. It was if he
[1:01:32] ever was a healer, he's still a healer.
[1:01:34] If he was ever a savior, he's still a
[1:01:36] savior. He was if he was ever a
[1:01:38] shepherd, he's still a shepherd. But
[1:01:39] said that was actually the keystone of
[1:01:41] the Bible. It was the revelation that
[1:01:43] God never changes. And that his ways are
[1:01:46] as unchangeable as he is. Isn't that
[1:01:47] what Paul said? Hebrews 13:8, he said
[1:01:50] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:01:51] today, and forever. Ecclesiastes the
[1:01:54] third chapter, he said, "I know that
[1:01:56] whatsoever God doeth, it shall be
[1:01:57] forever. Nothing can be put to it, nor
[1:02:00] anything taken from it. And God doeth it
[1:02:02] that men should fear before him. That
[1:02:04] which hath been is now, and that which
[1:02:07] is to be hath already been."
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; And God requireth that which is past. He
[1:02:11] says, "See here it is." He's an
[1:02:12] unchanging God with unchanging ways.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; See, what he did in the first, he will
[1:02:17] have to keep on doing until it's done
[1:02:19] for the last time. There will never be a
[1:02:21] change. That's why we tell the
[1:02:23] testimonies of what God has done in the
[1:02:25] Bible. That's why we read Bible stories.
[1:02:27] That's why we tell of how that God
[1:02:31] handles situations. That's why we tell
[1:02:33] the Hebrew children and Daniel and David
[1:02:36] a and Malachi, these great men in the in
[1:02:39] the stories of Simeon and the in the
[1:02:41] Bible as a young man. That's why we tell
[1:02:43] the stories because the way God that
[1:02:44] dealt with them is still the way that
[1:02:46] God deals with us today. He says, "See,
[1:02:48] we know exactly from the word which was
[1:02:51] recorded by the Holy Spirit how the
[1:02:53] first or the original church was founded
[1:02:55] and how God manifested himself in her.
[1:02:58] The word can't change or be changed
[1:03:00] because the word is God."
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? So, we read how God
[1:03:05] manifested himself in the first church
[1:03:07] so that we'll know how that God will
[1:03:09] manifest himself in this church. And
[1:03:12] that that I believe that's the way a
[1:03:13] church ought to be founded is to is to
[1:03:15] go back and see how God manifests
[1:03:17] himself among his children. Then then
[1:03:20] you can recognize God when God is really
[1:03:22] there. You you don't have to wonder is
[1:03:23] it God or is it not God or or is God in
[1:03:26] this or is God in that. All you have to
[1:03:28] do is go back and see how God manifests
[1:03:31] himself the first time and then you'll
[1:03:33] know how God is going to move today. So
[1:03:35] see the word of God is truth and I
[1:03:37] believe it brother Brian it's truth in
[1:03:39] action. Amen.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; It's not just a truth, but it's truth in
[1:03:42] action. You know, I I believe that how
[1:03:44] if God done works before, he's still
[1:03:46] doing work now. You believe that? I I
[1:03:48] believe if he's God of the book of Acts,
[1:03:49] he's still God today.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; You know, a couple weeks ago, we had
[1:03:53] gone up and and had a request from a
[1:03:56] family that had had been witnessed to
[1:03:58] and uh some of the other members in the
[1:04:01] church had been witnessing to them. And
[1:04:02] and so they asked us to come up and I
[1:04:04] went I flew up there up north and and uh
[1:04:07] sit went to sit down at their home and
[1:04:09] we were going to visit and and uh and
[1:04:11] and and share some scripture and have a
[1:04:12] little service in their home and and uh
[1:04:15] you know I was walking out of my office.
[1:04:16] I thought this was it was such an odd
[1:04:18] thing. I was walking out of my office
[1:04:20] and I picked up my I picked up my Bible
[1:04:22] and you know I had my tablet with me and
[1:04:24] picked up my Bible and uh started out
[1:04:26] the office door and I got about two
[1:04:28] steps towards the door and something
[1:04:30] just something just a little burden come
[1:04:32] upon me and you know I stopped for a
[1:04:34] minute. I thought, "Well, Lord, is
[1:04:35] there, you know, I don't is there
[1:04:36] something wrong?" And and uh and
[1:04:37] something just spoke to me to put my
[1:04:39] Bible back down. And I thought, "Well,
[1:04:40] that's just an odd thing to think. Why
[1:04:42] wouldn't I take my Bible? I'm going to
[1:04:43] go sit and visit with some people and
[1:04:45] and minister to them. And you you know,
[1:04:47] I'm not going to go without my Bible.
[1:04:48] I'm going take my Bible with me." And I
[1:04:50] started out the door again and and and
[1:04:52] then something just spoke to me and
[1:04:53] said, you know, it would mean more to
[1:04:55] them out of their Bible than it would
[1:04:57] out of yours. So I thought, well, you
[1:04:58] know, Lord, if that's you, I'll just lay
[1:05:00] my Bible back down and and then if it
[1:05:02] ain't, I'll just look it up on my
[1:05:03] tablet, you know, and so but but I but I
[1:05:05] I you know, you just want to obey the
[1:05:07] Lord. So I took my Bible and I laid it
[1:05:09] back down. I thought that's the oddest
[1:05:10] thing that I've ever that I've ever
[1:05:12] felt. And you know, we I went out and
[1:05:14] and uh got on a plane and flew out there
[1:05:16] and and got in a layover and a brother
[1:05:19] called me and on the phone he was
[1:05:20] talking about some other things and and
[1:05:22] uh while he was visiting and and I told
[1:05:24] him, I said, "Brother, you know, the
[1:05:25] oddest thing happened to me today. I was
[1:05:27] flying out here to uh minister to this
[1:05:29] family and and uh and you know I took
[1:05:31] picked my Bible up and I said I just
[1:05:33] felt like it was the Lord that told me
[1:05:34] to put my Bible back down and not take
[1:05:36] it with me and he said well that's
[1:05:37] strange why would you know that why
[1:05:39] would I said I don't know it was just it
[1:05:40] was just an odd thing and I didn't tell
[1:05:42] nobody else just the brother happened to
[1:05:44] call so I shared it with him I said if
[1:05:45] you don't care just be praying about
[1:05:47] this tonight and uh that the service and
[1:05:50] everything would would go well and and
[1:05:52] uh and you know I just trust the Lord
[1:05:54] knows all things and and he said sure
[1:05:56] I'll be praying praying about it. And so
[1:05:57] I went on and and uh and got uh to the
[1:05:59] house and uh they w w w w w w w w w w w
[1:06:01] w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w
[1:06:01] w w w w w w w w w walked in there and
[1:06:02] had the uh family there and I walked in.
[1:06:04] I noticed when I walked in there was a
[1:06:06] Bible laying there on their uh coffee
[1:06:08] table in the living room and we we had
[1:06:09] went on in the kitchen and and uh so I
[1:06:11] didn't think nothing else about the
[1:06:12] Bible. I just sat there and just kind of
[1:06:14] visiting and hearing some stories about
[1:06:17] their life and their testimony and and
[1:06:19] uh the one lady had shared of how that
[1:06:21] she was baptized and uh kind of coaxed
[1:06:24] into baptizing and receiving baptism in
[1:06:26] the in in in titles and didn't really
[1:06:29] understood what it meant and and uh and
[1:06:31] you know she was talking about how that
[1:06:33] when she went and she she was sick and
[1:06:35] having back spasms and all these things
[1:06:37] and and you know and told her her
[1:06:38] parents that she didn't want to go
[1:06:40] through with it because of that and and
[1:06:42] you know they kind coached her into it,"
[1:06:43] she said. But I knew it wasn't right.
[1:06:44] There was something that was wrong about
[1:06:45] it. I didn't know what was wrong about
[1:06:47] it. But but my whole life, ever since
[1:06:49] then, I've always thought that it was
[1:06:50] wrong, that there was something uh uh
[1:06:52] more to it. And you know, I said, you
[1:06:54] know, uh you know, if if you if you
[1:06:56] don't mind, do you have a Bible laying
[1:06:58] around somewhere? I'll show you
[1:06:59] something in the scripture. And she
[1:07:01] said, "Oh, sure." And she got real happy
[1:07:02] and ran ran in there and and brought the
[1:07:04] Bible and laid it down. and and uh so I
[1:07:07] just asked the question knowing how that
[1:07:08] they had been raised and in the uh
[1:07:11] raised in you know baptizing in titles
[1:07:13] and believing in in the trinity and
[1:07:14] these things and you know and I said you
[1:07:16] know I said isn't it you know it's
[1:07:18] something you know that there's a father
[1:07:19] and a son and a holy ghost and said yeah
[1:07:22] we've always we've always known that and
[1:07:23] I said yeah you know that's that's just
[1:07:25] a a real thing I said well which one of
[1:07:28] them is Jesus's father and well it have
[1:07:30] to be the father after all it's called
[1:07:31] the father I said well that's simple
[1:07:32] enough you know the father certainly the
[1:07:34] father because his name's father and
[1:07:36] he's the son. So that was a that's an
[1:07:38] easy thing to pick up out of the
[1:07:39] scripture. And I said, "Yeah, sure
[1:07:40] enough that that's right in the Bible."
[1:07:42] And I said, "Yeah, so Jesus, his father
[1:07:44] was the father." I said, "Yeah." So I
[1:07:46] turned over to Matthew and opened up and
[1:07:48] says, "The birth of Jesus was on this
[1:07:50] wise that uh Mary was found with child
[1:07:52] of the Holy Ghost." And so I read that
[1:07:55] and you know, let me see that. So we
[1:07:57] kind of turned it around and they got to
[1:07:58] looking over and said, "Well, he was she
[1:08:00] was found with child of the Holy Ghost."
[1:08:01] Well, that that's kind of odd because we
[1:08:03] thought the father would have been the
[1:08:05] father but but now the Bible says that
[1:08:07] he was found with child of the Holy
[1:08:08] Ghost. So which so then the the husband
[1:08:11] he asked this very question. I know it
[1:08:12] was the Lord but way it was way way he
[1:08:15] asked it. He said well then who was the
[1:08:17] father? I said you know brother I said
[1:08:18] that you ain't the first person that
[1:08:20] ever asked that question. Said because
[1:08:21] it was asked by the disciples remember
[1:08:23] they came to Jesus and said show us the
[1:08:25] father. I said but let me show you how
[1:08:27] Jesus answered that. I'm not going to
[1:08:28] answer. But I just turned the Bible over
[1:08:30] to Luke the 4th chapter and and I turned
[1:08:32] it around. I hand it over to him and he
[1:08:34] was kind of just a little bit broken up
[1:08:36] English and but I he put his finger on
[1:08:38] that page and and and he said, "Well,
[1:08:40] show us the father." And he put his
[1:08:41] finger on that page and went to reading
[1:08:43] it and he said, "Have I been so long
[1:08:45] with you and you have not known me?" And
[1:08:47] I'm telling you, whenever he read that,
[1:08:49] the spirit of the Lord just dropped down
[1:08:50] in that in that kitchen and and uh they
[1:08:53] got to weeping and just ju just just
[1:08:56] feasting on the revelation. And then and
[1:08:58] then all of a sudden his wife she said
[1:09:00] you know that this Bible has been laying
[1:09:02] in our house all this time. She said and
[1:09:04] to think that God would give us a
[1:09:05] revelation right there out of our own
[1:09:07] Bible and her very words and God is my
[1:09:10] witness. Her very words she said it mean
[1:09:12] it means more to me that you could read
[1:09:14] that to me out of my Bible than it would
[1:09:16] if you would have brought your own Bible
[1:09:18] and read it out of it.
[1:09:21] And you know, I couldn't I couldn't help
[1:09:24] I couldn't help but call the brother and
[1:09:26] I said, "Brother, could you share with
[1:09:28] his family what what I told you today
[1:09:29] about my Bible?" It was odd. He said,
[1:09:31] "You mean all of it?" I said, "Brother,
[1:09:32] just as straight as I told it." He goes,
[1:09:34] "Well, it was kind of odd, but he told
[1:09:36] me that that he went to get his Bible to
[1:09:38] bring it to this meeting and or to the
[1:09:40] meeting and the Lord told him to put it
[1:09:42] back down and it would mean more to them
[1:09:43] reading it out of their Bible than it
[1:09:45] would be if he read it out of his." And
[1:09:47] they just got to praising the Lord. And
[1:09:48] after a minute, she said, "Well, this
[1:09:49] ain't no different than the Bible coming
[1:09:51] to life." That's the same things we read
[1:09:53] about in the Bible that God is doing
[1:09:55] right in our kitchen. I thought, "Isn't
[1:09:56] that our same God? It's God that is with
[1:09:59] us. He's God that among his children."
[1:10:01] That's why Brother Ram said, he said,
[1:10:02] "How God acted, how he manifested
[1:10:05] himself in the first church. He still
[1:10:07] manifest himself to be the word of God.
[1:10:09] He still manifest himself today." I I
[1:10:11] thank God that it's God in action.
[1:10:13] Brother Martha, he knows exactly what we
[1:10:15] have need of. You realize how of a
[1:10:16] little thing that is. What a a small
[1:10:18] thing it is to us to think about reading
[1:10:20] a scripture out of one Bible or another.
[1:10:23] It's such a minuscule thing. It wouldn't
[1:10:25] mean anything to anybody, but it meant
[1:10:27] something to her. I think that God is so
[1:10:29] mindful of our of our feelings and our
[1:10:32] thoughts and knowing what we have need
[1:10:33] of. I thought, God, I thank you, Lord,
[1:10:35] that you would allow us to be sensitive
[1:10:38] enough to the spirit of God that you
[1:10:40] could see some small thing that would be
[1:10:42] a help to somebody. That's our God. He's
[1:10:44] present among the church. See, sometimes
[1:10:46] we wonder how how you know that God will
[1:10:48] do a certain thing, but we realize that
[1:10:50] God's attitude, it never changes. God's
[1:10:53] attitude towards certain things, it
[1:10:55] never changes. Here's what Paul said. He
[1:10:57] says, "Wherein God willing more
[1:10:58] abundantly to show unto you the heirs of
[1:11:01] the promise of immutability of his
[1:11:03] counsel, he confirmed it by an oath that
[1:11:06] by two immutable things. One in that it
[1:11:09] was impossible for God to lie." Now,
[1:11:10] Brother Bram lays this out. He says
[1:11:12] immutability means unchangeable. Isn't
[1:11:15] that right? Immutability means
[1:11:16] unchangeable. He says, "So God cannot
[1:11:18] change. It has to remain the same." So
[1:11:20] if God ever healed one sick person, he
[1:11:23] can never change his attitude. If he
[1:11:25] ever forgive one sinner or one
[1:11:26] prostitute, he can never change his
[1:11:28] attitude. And the immutability or the
[1:11:30] unchanging of God's word, he said in one
[1:11:32] place, I am the Lord that heals all of
[1:11:35] thy diseases. He said, so God has to
[1:11:37] stay with that because God said it. He's
[1:11:39] an infinite God. He know the end from
[1:11:41] the beginning. So if he said, "I am the
[1:11:43] Lord that heals all thy diseases," then
[1:11:45] he's still that same God. He's
[1:11:47] immutable. He's unchangeable. Says,
[1:11:48] "See, so as we read this, he said it was
[1:11:51] immutable. Two immutable things. It was
[1:11:53] impossible for God to lie." He says,
[1:11:55] "See, so an impossibility and an
[1:11:57] immutability is practically the same
[1:12:00] word." In other words, it can't change.
[1:12:02] It can't move. It has to remain the same
[1:12:05] forever. It can't be changed. The
[1:12:07] immutability and the impossibility.
[1:12:09] Listen, I I think this is so powerful
[1:12:11] because here the Bible would tell us
[1:12:12] like this. It says by two immutable
[1:12:15] things in which it was impossible for
[1:12:17] God to lie. So see, we have two things.
[1:12:19] First, his word said he would do it and
[1:12:21] it was impossible for him to lie. And
[1:12:24] then on top of that, just for God saying
[1:12:26] it, it was impossible for him to lie. He
[1:12:28] said, but on top of that, second, he
[1:12:30] swore an oath to it that he would do it.
[1:12:33] So he it made it an immutable thing. In
[1:12:36] other in other words, it was impossible
[1:12:37] for him to lie. But even though it was
[1:12:39] impossible, still yet he swore an oath
[1:12:41] and he made a promise to his very word
[1:12:44] that was impossible to be wrong anyway.
[1:12:46] But on top of that, God made an oath
[1:12:48] before the children of God that his
[1:12:50] promise would apply to them. You say,
[1:12:52] "Well, what was that promise?" Re said,
[1:12:53] "Look, look at this promise." He said,
[1:12:55] "Here, God has promised us by a sworn
[1:12:57] oath. One that he cannot lie. The other
[1:13:00] he swore an oath on top of that he will
[1:13:03] raise us up in the last day and give us
[1:13:06] eternal life." Knowing that after that
[1:13:09] we have been called, he said that he
[1:13:10] knew us before the foundation of the
[1:13:12] world. He predestinated us unto adoption
[1:13:15] of children through Jesus Christ. He
[1:13:17] forneew us. He called us. And when he
[1:13:19] called us, he justified us. We can't
[1:13:22] justify oursel. Said, but it was him
[1:13:24] that justified us. He justified us by
[1:13:26] the death of his own son. Those who he
[1:13:29] has justified, he has already glorified.
[1:13:31] He said, see, the word has already
[1:13:33] spoke. And it's impossible for God to
[1:13:36] lie. And he swore an oath to you. Can
[1:13:39] somebody say to me? And he swore an oath
[1:13:41] to you. A God that is his word is
[1:13:43] unchangeable. A God whose word cannot
[1:13:45] lie. Then that same God swore an oath to
[1:13:47] you. He said, "I've called you. I've
[1:13:50] justified you." He said, "And when he's
[1:13:52] justified, you've already glorified." He
[1:13:54] said, "His word has already spoken. And
[1:13:56] now we are just on our road going along
[1:14:00] and rejoicing on our way to glory."
[1:14:03] So, see, it's God that justified us.
[1:14:05] It's God that called us. He justified
[1:14:07] us. He glorified us. He said, "So, what
[1:14:09] are we doing? We're just walking along
[1:14:11] our road and we're and we're shouting
[1:14:13] the victory on our way to glory. We're
[1:14:15] rejoicing on our way to glory." Brother
[1:14:18] Bobby, the battle isn't for us. We're
[1:14:19] just rejoicing on our way to glory
[1:14:21] because it was God that made the
[1:14:23] promise. I don't know about you this
[1:14:24] morning. That makes me feel pretty good
[1:14:26] to think it ain't about something I can
[1:14:28] work up or how good I can be or or what
[1:14:30] I can do today so that I can make it to
[1:14:32] heaven one day. But I'm just walking on
[1:14:35] my way. Rejoicing on my way to glory.
[1:14:37] Rejoicing in the promise that God has
[1:14:40] already made. Rejoiceing knowing that it
[1:14:42] was God that called me. It was God that
[1:14:44] justified me. It was God that glorified
[1:14:46] me. It was God that changed me. He
[1:14:49] predestinated me. He purposed in his
[1:14:51] heart that I'd be with him before the
[1:14:53] foundation of the world.
[1:14:55] And I'm rejoicing on my way to glory.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; You see, it's God. David said, "God is
[1:15:01] our refuge and our strength.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; He's a very present help in a time of
[1:15:05] trouble."
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; My not only does God know us, but we
[1:15:07] know God. Let me tell you a secret,
[1:15:09] friends. You don't know God like the
[1:15:11] angels know God.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; See, they know God one way, but you know
[1:15:14] God another way.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Every one of you, if you think about it
[1:15:17] this morning, I wonder how many can
[1:15:18] raise your hand and say, "I know God as
[1:15:20] a healer." Amen.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; How many can raise your hand all over
[1:15:23] the building? A hundred or two. I know
[1:15:26] God as a savior. I know God as a
[1:15:29] deliverer. I know God as a as a prayer
[1:15:31] answer.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; I know God as a shepherd that can lead
[1:15:35] me out of trouble. I know God that knows
[1:15:37] that how to bring me out of a a desert
[1:15:39] into green pastures.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; I know God as a comforter.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; I know God as a sanctuary. I know God as
[1:15:49] a refuge. I know God as a hiding place.
[1:15:51] I know him as a keeper.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; David said, "He is our refuge and our
[1:15:56] strength and a very present help.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we will not fear. Though the
[1:16:01] earth be moved, and though the mountains
[1:16:03] be carried in the midst of the sea,
[1:16:05] though the waters roar and be troubled,
[1:16:07] though mountains shake, there is a
[1:16:09] river, the streams whereof shall make
[1:16:11] glad the city of God, the holy place of
[1:16:13] the tabernacles of the most high, and
[1:16:15] God is in the midst of her."
[1:16:19] Oh, isn't it wonderful to know God said
[1:16:22] he's in the midst of her and she shall
[1:16:24] not be moved,
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; but God shall help her. The heathen
[1:16:28] raised and the kingdoms were moved. He
[1:16:30] uttered his voice. The earth melted. The
[1:16:31] Lord of hosts is with us.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; The God of Jacob is our refuge.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; God is with us. He's our strength. Don't
[1:16:41] you realize the same God of the Old
[1:16:42] Testament is the same God of the New
[1:16:44] Testament.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; He was there in the Old, brother Bobby.
[1:16:47] He was there in the new.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; He was the God of Abraham. He was the
[1:16:51] God of Jacob. He was the God of Moses.
[1:16:54] He was the God of the apostles. He's a
[1:16:56] God of the disciples. Brother Joe, he's
[1:16:58] the God on the housetop. He's the God
[1:17:01] down in the cellar. He's God when you're
[1:17:03] sick and he's still God when you're
[1:17:05] well. He's God when I'm happy. He's God
[1:17:07] when I'm sad. He's God when I'm wealthy.
[1:17:10] He's God when I'm poor. He's God in the
[1:17:13] mountain. He's God in the valley. He's
[1:17:15] God in the desert. He's God in the sea.
[1:17:17] I know he's my God that my soul knoweth
[1:17:20] right well. He's my God in the time of
[1:17:23] trouble. He's my God when everything is
[1:17:25] going good. He's my God when I'm in a
[1:17:28] revival. He's my God when I'm laying in
[1:17:30] depression. He's still my God.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; He's God.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; He said he stands that same God that led
[1:17:38] the Hebrew children out of the fiery
[1:17:40] furnace. He's the same God that led
[1:17:42] Moses through the wilderness. And he's
[1:17:44] the same God that come bring ringing
[1:17:46] forth a power unto the church this
[1:17:48] morning through those mighty wings of
[1:17:50] that mother eagle or he he's come before
[1:17:53] the church the mighty Russian wind that
[1:17:55] is leading us out of our troubles.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; He's still God.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; He rode back a Red Sea
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; for one. He closed the mouth of a lion.
[1:18:04] For another brother Marky he he he held
[1:18:07] the that the heat out of the fire for
[1:18:09] another. And that same wind is blowing
[1:18:11] through your life through this building
[1:18:13] this morning. He's the same God that
[1:18:15] takes the sting out of the trouble that
[1:18:17] you're going through.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; He's God.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; It ain't our power.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; It's his power.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; It ain't our strength. It's God's
[1:18:25] strength. It ain't our wisdom. It's
[1:18:27] God's wisdom.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; He's still God.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes, here's where we get to
[1:18:35] is sometimes our attitude and God's
[1:18:37] attitude aren't the same.
[1:18:39] Isn't that true?
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we look at the same problem
[1:18:43] that God looks at
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; and our attitude is different
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; than God's attitude. But said, "See, he
[1:18:49] only requested one thing." Isn't it
[1:18:50] true? Can I just Can I just speak to you
[1:18:52] this morning? Isn't it true? Sometimes
[1:18:54] when you look at things there, there's
[1:18:56] so there's a mountain so big you can't
[1:18:57] get over it. There the the the valley is
[1:19:00] uncrossable. The river is too wide. The
[1:19:02] problem is too big. It's too deep. It's
[1:19:04] been going on too long. It's got too
[1:19:06] many roots. But but and we can't get
[1:19:08] past it. That's the way we look at it.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; See, but God's attitude is not the same.
[1:19:13] He says, "See, God only requested one
[1:19:15] thing." You ready for it? What he
[1:19:17] request of you as a believer? He said,
[1:19:19] "If thou can't believe."
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Said, "Oh, can you believe all things
[1:19:24] are possible?" He said, "If you can
[1:19:25] believe," he said, there's the question.
[1:19:28] It ain't if God can.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; The question is if you can. It's not if
[1:19:32] God can still move mountains or if God
[1:19:35] can still stay the mouth of lions or if
[1:19:37] God but the question is if you can. The
[1:19:40] question is not on God's word. He said
[1:19:42] the question is on whether or not you
[1:19:43] can believe God's word.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; In other words, when you hear a promise
[1:19:47] of God that you can from your soul and
[1:19:50] from your heart that you can say amen.
[1:19:52] Not just out of words or hearing or out
[1:19:55] of a out of a trained response, but is
[1:19:57] there something in your heart that can
[1:19:58] say amen to God's word to a to a promise
[1:20:01] of God? See, see, when it comes to the
[1:20:03] promises of God, isn't that what Paul
[1:20:05] said? He said when it comes to the
[1:20:06] promise of God, he said in Jesus Christ,
[1:20:08] the answer was yes. He said, in other
[1:20:11] words, that when Christ came, what was
[1:20:13] Christ's purpose? That he affirmed every
[1:20:16] promise that God had already made to his
[1:20:18] children.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Christ was the affirmation of that
[1:20:21] promise. He said, "Then all that's left
[1:20:22] for you to do," he said, "in him it's
[1:20:25] amen under the glory of God by us." So
[1:20:27] in other words, the son of God, Jesus
[1:20:29] Christ, it was not yes and no, but it
[1:20:31] proved to be yes in him. In other words,
[1:20:33] he affirmed the promise. He said, "And
[1:20:34] as many as the promises of God are in
[1:20:37] Christ, they are all yes." So through
[1:20:40] him, then we say amen unto the glory of
[1:20:43] God.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; So the question is not on the promise of
[1:20:46] God because Jesus affirmed every promise
[1:20:49] of God. So it doesn't matter what it is.
[1:20:50] I I have a h I have a bunch. But but it
[1:20:53] doesn't matter what it is this morning.
[1:20:54] But but if but if God gave the promise
[1:20:56] in Christ, it was yes. And then all that
[1:20:58] promise is waiting on is waiting on you
[1:21:01] to say amen.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; It's waiting in order for it to come to
[1:21:04] pass in your life. And in order for the
[1:21:06] promise of God to take effect in your
[1:21:07] life, it's for the soul of that man or
[1:21:09] the or the the real heart of a man. It's
[1:21:11] just something in you say, "Amen. So be
[1:21:14] it. Be it unto me according to thy
[1:21:15] word." It doesn't matter what the
[1:21:17] promise is. See, see Isaiah, he said,
[1:21:19] "God will take a hold of your right hand
[1:21:21] and say to you," do not fear. I will
[1:21:23] help you. Jesus, Paul said, Jesus
[1:21:25] affirmed it to be true. And now he's
[1:21:28] just waiting on you to say what?
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; To say, "Amen." He said, "I will help
[1:21:32] you." He affirmed it to be true. So, you
[1:21:34] know, God's going to help you. He's just
[1:21:36] waiting on you to say, "Amen."
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; James said, "When the devil comes to
[1:21:40] torment you," he said, "Resist the devil
[1:21:42] and he will flee from you." Jesus
[1:21:44] affirmed it to be true. He's just
[1:21:46] waiting on you to say what?
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; To say amen.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; When you pass through waters, I will be
[1:21:51] with thee. Through rivers, they shall
[1:21:53] not overflow thee. When you walk through
[1:21:55] fire, you shall not be burned. Neither
[1:21:57] shall the flame even kindle upon thee.
[1:22:00] But in Jesus Christ, it was affirmed.
[1:22:02] He's just waiting on you to say, "Amen."
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; For the mountain shall depart, and the
[1:22:06] hill shall be removed, but the but my
[1:22:08] kindness shall not depart from me. Jesus
[1:22:12] affirmed it to be a true promise. He's
[1:22:14] just waiting on you to say amen. But
[1:22:16] when I come up to a mountain that you're
[1:22:18] going to make a way that I can pass by.
[1:22:21] When I come to a valley, you're going to
[1:22:22] make a way that I can cross over it.
[1:22:24] When I come to a great trial, you're
[1:22:26] going to make a way that I can get
[1:22:28] through it. Jesus affirmed it. He's just
[1:22:30] waiting on you to say amen.
[1:22:33] Lord, I believe thy word. He declared it
[1:22:36] under the church. She said, "I know the
[1:22:38] thoughts I have for you. My plans I have
[1:22:40] for you is to prosper you and to not
[1:22:43] harm you. The harm that comes upon your
[1:22:45] life, it don't come from God. It came
[1:22:47] from the devil." And Jesus affirmed it.
[1:22:49] And I say, "Amen."
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; He gave me a way to get by.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; But my God shall supply all of your
[1:22:56] needs according to the riches
[1:23:01] of in glory by Jesus Christ.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; He affirmed it. I say amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Take delight in the Lord. He will give
[1:23:09] you the desires of your heart.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; He affirmed it. What do you say?
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; We know all things work together for the
[1:23:15] good of them that love God and are
[1:23:17] called according to his purpose. He
[1:23:18] affirmed it. What do you say?
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; If you shall confess with your mouth
[1:23:22] that Jesus the Lord is Lord and believe
[1:23:24] with thy heart that God raised him from
[1:23:25] the dead, thou shalt be saved. Jesus
[1:23:28] affirmed it. What do you say? First John
[1:23:30] said, "If we confess our sins, he is
[1:23:32] faithful and just to forgive and purify
[1:23:34] us from all unrighteousness." Jesus
[1:23:36] affirmed it. What do you say?
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget
[1:23:41] not all of his benefits. David said,
[1:23:43] "Who forgiveth all of my iniquities, and
[1:23:46] I say, amen." He heal all my diseases. I
[1:23:50] say, "Amen." He redeemth my life from
[1:23:52] destruction. I say, "Amen." He crowneth
[1:23:55] me with loving kindness and tender
[1:23:57] mercies. I say, "Amen." He satisfy thy
[1:24:00] mouth with good things
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; so that thy youth would be renewed
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; like the eagle.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; I say amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Paul is speaking on God's promises.
[1:24:13] Think about what he's laying into
[1:24:15] Hebrews the sixth chapter here. He's
[1:24:18] speaking on God's promises. But I want
[1:24:20] you to catch this this morning just to
[1:24:22] be a enough to be a stopping point this
[1:24:24] morning. But what what was Paul's
[1:24:27] purpose of bringing this to the church?
[1:24:30] See, Paul had a real purpose. And his
[1:24:32] purpose was not to change our emotions
[1:24:35] or cause people just to act some way or
[1:24:38] to make the church feel good. But notice
[1:24:40] what Paul's purpose was in the 12th
[1:24:41] verse. Paul said that you be not
[1:24:44] slothful,
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; but followers of them who through faith
[1:24:47] and patience inherit the promises. For
[1:24:50] when God made a promise to Abraham, see,
[1:24:52] watch this purpose. For when God, he
[1:24:54] uses this as an example. When God made a
[1:24:56] promise to Abraham, he could swear by no
[1:24:58] greater. He swore by himself, saying,
[1:25:00] "Surely blessing, I will bless thee and
[1:25:02] multiply, and I will multiply thee." And
[1:25:05] so, after that he had patiently endured,
[1:25:08] he obtained the promise. For men
[1:25:11] verilely swear by the greater, and an
[1:25:13] oath for confirmation is to them an end
[1:25:16] of all strife. How many knows what
[1:25:17] strife? Strife is conflict. So, he said,
[1:25:19] "Here is the end of conflict." I think
[1:25:22] that every one of us can find oursel
[1:25:24] right here.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; We find oursel each one of us have been
[1:25:28] conflicted in our flesh. How many say
[1:25:29] amen?
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; We've had each one of us have had
[1:25:32] moments in our life that we were
[1:25:33] conflicted in our salvation. We were
[1:25:35] conflicted in in in sickness or
[1:25:38] conflicted in healing and whether it God
[1:25:41] can or whether God will or whether God
[1:25:43] is able. We we've a each one have been
[1:25:45] conflicted in the promises of God. How
[1:25:48] many can be truthful and say, "I've been
[1:25:50] I've been there. I've been I've been
[1:25:52] conflicted. There's been times in my
[1:25:53] life I've been conflicted in that." But
[1:25:55] watch what Paul is saying that each one
[1:25:57] of us, we've had conflict. We've had a
[1:25:59] battle battles between our flesh and our
[1:26:01] spirit. But Paul settles this showing
[1:26:04] that by receiving this confirmation, it
[1:26:07] would end the conflict. This is what
[1:26:08] Paul's teaching in in in Hebrews 6. He
[1:26:10] says, "See, they swear by by by the
[1:26:13] greater and an oath for confirmation is
[1:26:16] to them an end of all strife." Says, "So
[1:26:19] God made this oath to confirm the
[1:26:21] promise of God that would end the
[1:26:23] conflict that is within you." Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; So here, when you're conflicted about
[1:26:27] God's promise and whether God is going
[1:26:29] to do what he said he would do or
[1:26:31] whether he's still going to heal or he's
[1:26:32] still going to save or he's still going
[1:26:34] to bring you through this trial, what
[1:26:36] whatever it is, but Paul said that, but
[1:26:37] the oath that he made, this confirmation
[1:26:40] is to end the conflict. You say, well,
[1:26:42] why why is that so important? Well,
[1:26:43] watch what he's what he's speaking of.
[1:26:45] He said here, this purpose is that you
[1:26:47] be not slothful, but followers of them
[1:26:50] who through faith and patient inherit
[1:26:51] the promise of God. So this is where
[1:26:54] Paul is getting to in this scripture is
[1:26:56] to show the church to not be a spiritual
[1:26:59] slugard.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; In other words, that you're not slothful
[1:27:02] spiritually. Here he would find the
[1:27:04] church in a condition that they would be
[1:27:07] slothful. and the slothfulness. Here
[1:27:09] Paul being a prophet of God, he
[1:27:11] identified where the slothfulness came
[1:27:13] from or the laziness or the or you know
[1:27:15] just the being the backwards but but but
[1:27:18] he saw where it came from and and and
[1:27:20] and he knew what it would take to bring
[1:27:22] them out of it. He says see so don't be
[1:27:24] this way but with faith and patience you
[1:27:26] would wait on the fulfillment of God's
[1:27:28] promise.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; See, so it's not see it's not God's will
[1:27:31] for us to be upset all the time. How
[1:27:32] many believe that? It ain't God's will
[1:27:34] for us to be happy when we get something
[1:27:36] and mad when we don't. It ain't God's
[1:27:38] will for when it seems like God's moving
[1:27:40] fast, brother Mah, everybody's running
[1:27:42] around and shouting and praising God.
[1:27:43] When it seems like he's moving slow,
[1:27:45] they're down in the dumps and barely
[1:27:46] barely even can get by, barely come to
[1:27:48] church, barely raise their hand, barely
[1:27:50] cl people just seems like we're like
[1:27:52] this all the time because we're human
[1:27:54] beings and we get this way. That Paul
[1:27:56] saw that as a prophet of God.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; He saw the slothfulness in the church.
[1:28:00] He said, "See, but this is not what God
[1:28:02] wants." And so when Paul saw this and he
[1:28:05] saw that God don't want this up and down
[1:28:07] and and kind of dragging through and and
[1:28:09] serving God this way, he said, "But what
[1:28:11] God really wants is God wants us to
[1:28:13] serve him with joy and with gladness."
[1:28:16] God wants to take the slothfulness out
[1:28:18] of our life and the the laziness of
[1:28:20] being Christians out of our life and
[1:28:22] cause us to serve him with joy and with
[1:28:24] gladness. And Paul knew what it would
[1:28:26] take to cause the church to to live in
[1:28:28] that kind of revival
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; that no matter what happened or no
[1:28:31] matter what took place on the side or
[1:28:33] how up they were, how down they were,
[1:28:35] what kind of trouble they were in, Paul
[1:28:36] knew the very message that it would take
[1:28:38] to uh the confirmation of the promise of
[1:28:41] God that if they could ever get that
[1:28:43] oath in their heart
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; that they could believe God's word as a
[1:28:46] finished work
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; and it would change the way that they
[1:28:49] serve God. How many believes that? That
[1:28:50] God wants us to serve him with joy and
[1:28:53] with gladness. Listen, that's what Moses
[1:28:55] said in Deuteronomy 28th chapter. Said
[1:28:57] when God was dealing with Israel, you
[1:28:59] realize he was speaking of their
[1:29:00] blessings and all the cursing and and
[1:29:02] their enemies and their relationship to
[1:29:04] God and and the and and and how they
[1:29:06] they were supposed to follow the word of
[1:29:07] God. But here here this this great
[1:29:10] nation that had come against them.
[1:29:11] Listen what as God begins to deal with
[1:29:13] Israel, he says that this nation that
[1:29:15] you were made to rule over is going to
[1:29:17] rule you. Said your enemy shall be the
[1:29:20] head and you shall be the tail.
[1:29:22] Moreover, all the curses shall come upon
[1:29:24] thee, and shall pursue thee, and take
[1:29:26] over thee till you be destroyed. They
[1:29:28] shall come upon thee for a sign and a
[1:29:30] wonder, and upon thy seed forever. This
[1:29:32] is why God would You say, "Why would God
[1:29:34] bring a curse that was upon their enemy
[1:29:35] back upon his own children?" He said,
[1:29:37] "But it will come upon you because you
[1:29:40] served not the Lord thy God with
[1:29:42] joyfulness and gladness in thy heart."
[1:29:45] It wasn't that they wasn't serving God,
[1:29:46] but listen, he said, "You serve not God
[1:29:49] with joy and gladness." s to see for the
[1:29:51] abundance of all things that you you
[1:29:53] hearing what I'm saying this morning. So
[1:29:55] it it should be a joy to go to church.
[1:29:57] You ought you ought to be able to come
[1:29:58] to church and enjoy the presence of God.
[1:30:01] It should be a joy to praise God. It
[1:30:03] ought to be a joy to come and worship
[1:30:04] God. Friends, there's a world of people
[1:30:06] today that go to church grudgingly. They
[1:30:08] go cuz they have to go. They're dragged
[1:30:10] in by your parents or dragged in by
[1:30:12] somebody else or some obligation or
[1:30:15] something. They go and they don't get
[1:30:16] nothing out of it. They they serve God
[1:30:18] out of obligation. But friends, I've got
[1:30:20] news for you this morning that you don't
[1:30:22] have to serve God that way. You don't
[1:30:24] have to be bound up and you don't have
[1:30:25] to serve God that way. But Paul said
[1:30:27] there is a way that you can serve God
[1:30:30] with joy and with gladness. There's a
[1:30:32] way to overcome the slothfulness and the
[1:30:34] laziness of serving God and being a
[1:30:36] revival in your heart again. And that's
[1:30:38] if you can open your eye and your heart
[1:30:40] to a revelation of God's promise and his
[1:30:43] oath that he has made to us. Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; And if that oath could ever get in your
[1:30:47] heart, said, "Listen, you will serve
[1:30:49] your enemy because you don't serve God
[1:30:51] with joy." Can I put that in today's
[1:30:52] terms? In other words, you say, "Well,
[1:30:54] how can I serve God and not serve God
[1:30:56] with joy?" Let me tell you what happens.
[1:30:57] You become a a witness that is not an
[1:30:59] effective witness.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; You become a you're not creating an
[1:31:03] atmosphere where the spirit of God can
[1:31:05] move. You're not presenting a life that
[1:31:07] is desirable unto others.
[1:31:10] You're not causing anybody to want to be
[1:31:12] a Christian.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; When you get slothful and get lazy. I'm
[1:31:15] not picking on nobody. I I'm smiling.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; But but but but when you're slothful and
[1:31:21] and and you get this spirit of
[1:31:22] slothfulness and serving God in this
[1:31:24] manner, I promise I'm about to quit.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; And you serve God in that manner and
[1:31:29] don't serve God with joy and gladness.
[1:31:31] The people around you, well, they don't
[1:31:32] want what you got
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; because you're all around you. I got to
[1:31:35] go to church this morning.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Well, good. Have fun.
[1:31:39] you know. Yeah, I got to I got to go.
[1:31:41] They they need some help over the
[1:31:42] church. I got to go help them.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Well, good. Have fun,
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; man. It must be a It must be a chore
[1:31:48] being a Christian
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; cuz you're you're you Oh, God. I'm going
[1:31:52] to get myself in trouble.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Must be a chore to serve your God
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; because you're depressed all the time.
[1:31:57] You're beat up all the time. You're
[1:31:59] negative all the time. There always
[1:32:01] problems. There ain't nothing nothing
[1:32:03] happy about it. Why would I want a a God
[1:32:05] like that? Come on.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Who would want a God that would make
[1:32:08] somebody so depressed that they don't
[1:32:10] feel like getting up out of bed and in
[1:32:11] bed?
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Come to church sometimes, they're so
[1:32:14] upset all the time. They're angry and
[1:32:16] cranky and when you say something nice
[1:32:17] to them, they they they bite at you
[1:32:19] back. Well, who would want to serve a
[1:32:20] God that would cause a person to be that
[1:32:23] way?
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; This is what Paul is correcting.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; This is Paul's correcting.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; This is what Paul is correcting.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Said, "Don't serve God with
[1:32:31] slothfulness."
[1:32:33] See, we have a way to serve God. But
[1:32:35] Mark, we want to serve with joy and with
[1:32:37] gladness
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; so that when people see you, your
[1:32:41] testimony is effective.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Your your witness is effective. It
[1:32:45] causes people that are around you to
[1:32:48] want to know the God that you know.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Why? Why are you like you are? It's like
[1:32:52] that that spring brother used to talk
[1:32:54] about. Remember, he said here it would
[1:32:56] go by and it was always bubbling. I
[1:32:57] asked him, you know, spring, why are you
[1:32:59] bubbling? He said, 'Is it because the
[1:33:00] deer drink from you? No, that ain't it.
[1:33:02] Is it because the the the other animals,
[1:33:04] they come and drink from you? No, that
[1:33:06] ain't it. Is it Is it because I bend
[1:33:08] down and drink from you? Is that why
[1:33:09] you're bubbling all the time? No, that
[1:33:11] ain't it. Said, "But what caused you to
[1:33:12] bubble?" Said, "Well, there's something
[1:33:14] way down deep in me. I can't I don't
[1:33:17] even know where the source of it is, but
[1:33:18] there's something way down deep in me
[1:33:20] that's bubbling up all the time. I can't
[1:33:22] even control it." Friends, that's what
[1:33:24] Paul wants us to get to. Get to a place
[1:33:26] that we can serve God with joy and serve
[1:33:29] him with gladness. that there's
[1:33:30] something bubbling in our heart. I know
[1:33:32] it's a simple thought, but there's
[1:33:34] something bubbling in our heart and in
[1:33:36] our soul that the people around you want
[1:33:38] to know the God that is present in your
[1:33:40] life.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Be a witness, a testimony.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Serve God with joy and gladness.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; David shows us we don't serve him out of
[1:33:50] obligation as the music players want to
[1:33:52] come. We don't serve him with obligation
[1:33:54] but with joy and with gratitude. said,
[1:33:57] "See, God desires," listen here, David
[1:34:00] say, "God desires a heartfelt worship."
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; You think of this. Nobody I can't tell
[1:34:06] the ex. Look at my filter. Praise the
[1:34:09] Lord. He's been helping me with that.
[1:34:12] It's working overtime.
[1:34:16] But you think God don't know or God
[1:34:19] knows that whenever we serve God and
[1:34:22] it's not heartfelt,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; we don't that we worship, it's not
[1:34:26] heartfelt. God don't want that. He don't
[1:34:27] He don't want us just to go through the
[1:34:30] motions and clap when everybody's
[1:34:31] clapping and amen when everybody's
[1:34:32] amening and shout when other people are.
[1:34:34] He wants us from our heart. God wants
[1:34:36] heartfelt worship
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; with joy and gladness that we serve God.
[1:34:39] He wants us to desire to go to church
[1:34:42] again.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; God wants that desire from him. He don't
[1:34:44] want you just dragging in here. You're
[1:34:46] an elder or you're a youth or or but but
[1:34:48] God God called you.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's purposed in his heart that
[1:34:53] you would a desire that you would that
[1:34:55] you would love him like he loved you.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Do you realize, can I say this, that
[1:34:59] Jesus did not go to the cross
[1:35:01] grudgingly?
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; I can't believe I'm even doing this.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; It was not that way. Although he battled
[1:35:08] with the flesh, but it wasn't
[1:35:09] grudgingly.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; It wasn't. But but but it was it was in
[1:35:13] his heart to do.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; And that's the way that he wants us to
[1:35:16] serve him with a heartfelt worship.
[1:35:19] David said, "Make a joyful noise unto
[1:35:21] the Lord, all you lands.
[1:35:25] Serve the Lord with gladness, and come
[1:35:27] before his presence with singing. Know
[1:35:30] ye that the Lord, he is God, and it is
[1:35:32] he that hath made us, and not ourselves.
[1:35:35] We are his people, and the sheep of his
[1:35:37] pasture."
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; So enter into his gates with
[1:35:40] thanksgiving, and enter into his courts
[1:35:42] with praise, and be thankful unto him,
[1:35:44] and bless his name. For the Lord is good
[1:35:48] and his mercy is everlasting and his
[1:35:50] truth endureth to all generations. Won't
[1:35:53] you stand to your feet this morning? See
[1:35:56] the absence of joy and gladness in
[1:35:59] serving God. Brother Joe, it shows
[1:36:03] a lack of true understanding of God's
[1:36:05] blessing. If you can serve God without
[1:36:08] joy and gladness, it shows that you
[1:36:10] really don't have a revelation of God's
[1:36:12] blessing.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; So, we're not we don't we're not glad.
[1:36:15] Whenever God does something good for us,
[1:36:17] we serve God with gladness. Even in
[1:36:19] trial, even in good, even in bad,
[1:36:22] because we have a real true
[1:36:24] understanding of the blessings of God.
[1:36:27] Friends, I'll tell you, I can just say
[1:36:29] this because I know some people get it
[1:36:30] mixed up, but I went over first time I
[1:36:33] ever went to India, that was the first
[1:36:35] revelation that the Lord showed me. I
[1:36:38] met the happiest people on earth that
[1:36:40] didn't have one thing. They didn't own a
[1:36:42] possession. They didn't own homes. They
[1:36:45] didn't have a car. They barely had any
[1:36:47] food. And they were the happiest people
[1:36:49] I ever met. I thought, "The Lord really,
[1:36:51] he really showed me something." But they
[1:36:54] had met their Lord and Savior. And they
[1:36:57] had a revelation of what God's blessing
[1:36:58] really was. It wasn't, "Well, if God
[1:37:00] will give me something better tomorrow,
[1:37:02] then I'll really I'll come to church on
[1:37:03] fire." Boy, God done blessed me. Got a
[1:37:06] new truck. I'm going to be shouting this
[1:37:07] week. But that ain't what caused them to
[1:37:10] have joy and gladness. wasn't on
[1:37:12] possessions,
[1:37:14] but it was a real revelation of the
[1:37:16] blessings of God.
[1:37:18] So that's where that's what Paul is
[1:37:21] trying to show us if we can get to this
[1:37:23] place. Don't be a slothful follower. He
[1:37:26] shows us that the way to overcome this
[1:37:29] slothfulness is by getting the
[1:37:31] revelation of God's promise. that his
[1:37:34] oath to us as believers. When you see
[1:37:36] the promise of God as a reality, it
[1:37:38] brings you out of slothfulness and into
[1:37:41] joy.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? He brings you out
[1:37:44] of this place of slothfulness. I believe
[1:37:47] that this morning that it ain't just it
[1:37:49] ain't just that when God fulfills his
[1:37:51] promise, it brings joy. But to a real
[1:37:53] believer, it's just when God gives a
[1:37:55] promise, it brings joy.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; That's enough for us. Is it wonder how
[1:37:59] many lift their hands say, "Brother man,
[1:38:01] that's the way I want to be. Amen.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; I can just hear the promise of God and
[1:38:05] it brings such joy. You remember what it
[1:38:06] what it was like whenever you could just
[1:38:08] hear a little word of God and it brought
[1:38:09] such a joy and a and a revelation to
[1:38:12] your heart and my you just went to
[1:38:13] rejoicing and praising God just for a
[1:38:15] word.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Wasn't nothing manifested. It was just a
[1:38:19] word. This is what Paul's saying. Get us
[1:38:22] out of our slothfulness. Take the word
[1:38:24] of God. Take the oath of God's worth. It
[1:38:27] can't be changed. It was God's promise.
[1:38:29] It's immutable. It's unchangeable. It's
[1:38:31] impossible for God to lie. If you can
[1:38:33] ever get a hold of that, said it'll
[1:38:35] bring you out of that slothful way of
[1:38:38] serving God and serve him with joy and
[1:38:41] gladness.
[1:38:42] Amen. Let's just bow our heads this
[1:38:44] morning.
[1:38:46] Gracious heavenly father,
[1:38:48] Lord, you see the desire of our heart,
[1:38:52] Lord, this message of Apostle Paul,
[1:38:53] Lord, as he would bring to the church
[1:38:55] and God that it would bring us out of
[1:38:58] this condition, Lord, how easy it is to
[1:39:00] get into, Lord, to allow this
[1:39:03] slothfulness and Lord, these burdens of
[1:39:07] this flesh to come upon our life and
[1:39:09] Lord, it's so easy to be burdened and to
[1:39:11] affect our worship. And God, knowing how
[1:39:14] the enemy no doubt does that for a
[1:39:15] purpose. Knowing that if he can ever get
[1:39:18] the people of God to fail to worship God
[1:39:20] from their heart. And Lord, if he could
[1:39:23] ever get us to that place, then he can
[1:39:25] bring us into a defeated state and just
[1:39:27] pour on us just burdens and pressure.
[1:39:29] And but Lord, knowing that if they can
[1:39:31] ever break out of that in a true spirit
[1:39:33] of worship, God, that the very promises
[1:39:35] of God would take place in their life. I
[1:39:38] know the devil knows that. And Lord, I
[1:39:41] just thank you for this word of
[1:39:42] encouragement this morning. God, I just
[1:39:45] ask you that this word of promise would
[1:39:47] ring true in every heart. God, may it
[1:39:49] find its resting place in the heart of
[1:39:51] every believer, God. That you would
[1:39:53] bring such a revival to our hearts,
[1:39:54] Lord. That we would that we would come
[1:39:57] out of that that old condition, Lord,
[1:39:59] that old slothful condition, Lord, that
[1:40:01] there would be a joy that is restored to
[1:40:03] our heart, Lord. May we be like David
[1:40:05] said, "Restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:40:08] salvation." Lord, may there be such a
[1:40:10] restoration of the joy and the gladness
[1:40:13] of serving you, God. May there be a pure
[1:40:16] heart this morning, God. Those that have
[1:40:18] a desire of it this morning, God. May
[1:40:20] you restore them, God. Take us back from
[1:40:22] that fallen condition, Lord. Set us up
[1:40:24] on a mountain, God, with the praise of
[1:40:27] God on our lips that the blessings of
[1:40:30] God may befall our lives. Lord, we thank
[1:40:33] you for it this morning, God. We give
[1:40:35] you glory for all in the name of Jesus
[1:40:38] Christ.
[1:40:40] Oh Jesus.
[1:40:44] Oh, I say let

[1:43:42] to me, Lord. God, you never fail us.
[1:43:44] Lord, I just say you're worthy of all my
[1:43:47] praise, Lord.
[1:43:49] Oh, you were my sin. I cross my shame.
[1:43:55] Rising again. I bless your name.
[1:44:00] You are Lord.

[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:24] lamb of God. I say worthy. Worthy
[1:47:31] is your
[1:47:34] name.
[1:47:38] How many declare him worthy this
[1:47:39] morning? Can't be. Amen. Isn't he
[1:47:43] wonderful this morning? An unchanging
[1:47:46] God with unchanging ways. Gave a promise
[1:47:49] to us and then declared it by an oath.
[1:47:53] And we've we may see trouble and it may
[1:47:55] feel that way sometimes, Brother Bobby.
[1:47:57] But we've got an oath
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; from a God that can't lie
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; and that don't change his ways. Isn't it
[1:48:03] wonderful this morning to know? I know.
[1:48:05] I know how it makes you feel. I know how
[1:48:07] it makes me feel. I I feel just like the
[1:48:09] prophet felt. He said, "We're just going
[1:48:10] along and just praising God on our way
[1:48:13] to glory." Ain't that right? Do you love
[1:48:15] the Lord this morning? Won't somebody
[1:48:17] give the Lord a hand clap of praise?
[1:48:19] When I look around and see all the good
[1:48:23] things that he's done for me, well, I
[1:48:26] know
[1:48:28] I'm un worthy of him all
[1:48:33] and all his blessings.
[1:48:36] He freely gives. I
[1:48:39] owe my life and I've got so much to
[1:48:45] think.
[1:48:47] Oh, I said I got so much to thank him
[1:48:52] for,
[1:48:54] so much to praise him for.
[1:48:58] He's been so very good to me.
[1:49:02] Thank you, Lord. And I say when I think
[1:49:07] of all that he's done me
[1:49:10] he's brought me from I've got
[1:49:14] so much to thank you for. Can you sing
[1:49:18] that chorus again? I've got so much to
[1:49:22] thank him for. So much
[1:49:26] to praise him for. He's done.
[1:49:30] glory.
[1:49:34] And when I think
[1:49:37] of all what kind of life he brought me
[1:49:42] from, I've got
[1:49:44] so much to thank him for.
[1:49:49] Well, I say sometimes
[1:49:52] while on this way, I just stop my smile
[1:49:56] and kneel down and pray. Lord, I thank
[1:49:59] you for all that you've done for me.
[1:50:04] And I know one day soon
[1:50:07] I'll reach heaven shore. Lord, please
[1:50:10] let me heal once more. Cuz I've got
[1:50:14] so much to thank. Won't you just praise
[1:50:17] the Lord this morning? But I know I've
[1:50:20] got so much to thank. I've got so much
[1:50:26] to praise. you sees me. Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:30] I mean, catchy about that, Lord. You
[1:50:33] never fail me. And when I think
[1:50:37] of all that my God has done,
[1:50:41] well, I've got so much I've got so much
[1:50:45] to thank him for.
[1:50:48] And I say sometimes
[1:50:52] while on this way I just stop
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; and I kneel and pray. Lord I thank you
[1:50:59] for all you've done for me.
[1:51:03] And I know that one day we'll reach
[1:51:07] heaven sure. And I pray let me kneel
[1:51:11] once more cuz I've got all eternity. I
[1:51:16] can spend thanking God for what he's
[1:51:17] done for us. I say I've got so much to
[1:51:22] thank you for. Yes, I've got so much to
[1:51:25] bring. You see, he's been
[1:51:29] so very good to me.
[1:51:33] And when I think
[1:51:36] of all that my God has done,
[1:51:40] where he brought me from, I've got
[1:51:44] so much.
[1:51:45] Can I sing that first verse again? I
[1:51:47] just can't help. But when I look
[1:51:51] around and see all the good things that
[1:51:55] God has done for me, I know I'm not
[1:51:59] worthy of them all.
[1:52:03] But I found his blessings. Thank you,
[1:52:06] Lord. He freely gives and I owe my life
[1:52:10] to him. Yes, I've got. Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:14] For to thank him for.

[1:52:28] He's been so good to me.
[1:52:33] Well, when I feel

[1:52:40] brought me from the Lord, I've got so
[1:52:43] much to thank him for. Well, I've got so
[1:52:48] much to thank him for.
[1:52:51] So much to praise him for. You see, he's
[1:52:54] been so very good to me.

[1:53:22] Father, for giving us the opportunity,
[1:53:24] Lord, to come before you once again,

[1:53:53] Brother Andrew.
[1:53:55] We'll be having him speak for us this
[1:53:56] Wednesday. And Lord willing, y'all be
[1:53:59] praying for them. And the baby and
[1:54:01] little Malachi
[1:54:03] Lord will heal him quickly. And I know
[1:54:06] it's hard to sit there like that. He's
[1:54:09] kind of an active little fella. He's not

[1:54:13] remember them in prayer as you go. God
