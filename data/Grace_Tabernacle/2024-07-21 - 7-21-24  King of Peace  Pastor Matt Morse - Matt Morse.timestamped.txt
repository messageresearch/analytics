[52:53] chapter and we're going to read out the
[52:55] 17th verse
[52:57] Genesis 14 and
[53:01] 17 and just want
[53:04] to let the church know that brother
[53:07] Timothy prit will be here on August the
[53:09] 4th speaking for us and just kind of put
[53:12] that down on the calendar also brother

[53:21] wonderful evangelists that'll come and
[53:23] so we're just looking forward to that
[53:25] but we want to read from Genesis the
[53:27] 14th chapter and the 17th verse and I'll
[53:31] read down to the 20th verse the Bible
[53:34] said in the king of Sodom went out to
[53:35] meet him after his return from the
[53:38] slaughter of cedor laoma and of the
[53:42] kings that were with him at the valley
[53:44] of Shava which is the King's Dell and
[53:47] MDC the king of Salem brought forth
[53:50] Bread and Wine and he was the priest of
[53:51] the most high God and he blessed him and
[53:54] he said Blessed Be Abram of the most
[53:57] high God the possessor of Heaven and
[53:59] Earth what a blessing for God to put
[54:01] Upon A man the possessor of Heaven and
[54:03] Earth and he blessed be and blessed be
[54:06] the most high God which hath delivered
[54:08] thine enemies into thy hand and he gave
[54:10] him tithes of all and we'll just ask the
[54:13] Lord to add his Blessing to the reading
[54:14] of the word I want to speak this morning
[54:16] on the king of peace and just ask the
[54:18] Lord to come and we just certainly just
[54:21] say we love the word of God I I just
[54:24] want to say it's a privilege to be able
[54:26] to come uh to a church with people that
[54:28] love God and love his word and and we
[54:30] come out on a Sunday morning just how
[54:32] many come in expectation receive
[54:34] something from the Lord and I believe
[54:36] that you can take a scripture and read
[54:38] it under an anointing and it'll feed
[54:39] God's children amen and so we don't want
[54:41] to add our own uh thought to it but we
[54:43] just want to allow God uh to take it and
[54:46] and and and use it to uh edify the
[54:48] church this morning so how many say Amen
[54:50] to that I want to just take a a moment
[54:53] this morning we realize that this story
[54:55] many of us had have heard it and been
[54:57] preached on and and uh many times and we
[55:00] realize that this uh this scene in the
[55:03] Bible where MDC is having a meal here
[55:06] with Abraham and and this comes after
[55:09] Abraham had followed the call of God in
[55:11] his life and uh brother Wesley the Bible
[55:13] had told him he said go out and and get
[55:16] thee out of thy country and from thy
[55:17] Kindred and thy father's house and go
[55:19] into this land that I'll show you and
[55:21] and the Bible would tell us that Abraham
[55:23] being a man of Faith he he obeyed the
[55:25] Lord and and he went to allow God to
[55:27] make something great out of his life
[55:29] remember what God promised him I will
[55:30] make of thee a great nation and and so
[55:33] here he heard a promise of God and he
[55:34] was a man that was determined to allow
[55:37] God to take take his life and make
[55:39] something great out of it so he
[55:40] surrendered to the call of God and
[55:42] brother Mark and out he he went and the
[55:44] Bible would say he sojourned and he went
[55:46] out into this place he separated from
[55:48] his family and from lot and he went out
[55:51] and remember lot went up and he took the
[55:53] he took Sodom in the city and Abraham
[55:56] dwell down in the plains and and the
[55:57] Bible would tell us that this now this
[55:59] doesn't happen over a few uh uh days but
[56:01] this went on for many years and for many
[56:03] years that Abraham uh lived in this
[56:05] place that he prospered as he was
[56:07] waiting on the Lord and and then while
[56:10] while Abraham was living in this place
[56:12] there came uh there came uh uh this this
[56:14] great uh uh battle or division in the
[56:17] land that Abraham was living in and and
[56:19] the King uh cedor Lo ler and he gathered
[56:22] he gathered up his men and his allies
[56:24] and they came into this place and he
[56:26] took three other kings with him so these
[56:28] Four Kings they came in and and they
[56:30] conquered all of the Nations that
[56:32] surrounded where Abraham was living and
[56:34] and and and they made them and and this
[56:36] goes on for quite some time matter of
[56:38] fact it was 12 years the Bible would say
[56:40] that they lived in this condition and
[56:41] they lived under the headship of this
[56:43] King this forced headship of cheder
[56:45] lomer and and and and for these for and
[56:48] for this time that he uh that that they
[56:50] dwelt in this place but after a little
[56:52] while some of the Kings got together and
[56:54] they rebelled against cheder and they
[56:57] and and among those kings was the kings
[56:59] of Sodom and Gomorrah the place where
[57:01] lot uh was living and so when they they
[57:03] they would come against him and they
[57:04] would go to battle and they you know
[57:06] there was there was a there was there
[57:07] was something with them that just didn't
[57:09] want to live in this kind of condition
[57:10] and and so they took these these Kings
[57:13] they they would call them many uh Bible
[57:15] uh studiers they would call it the five
[57:17] uh Kings or the five Rebel Kings and
[57:18] they would they would come against this
[57:20] great Authority that had come over this
[57:22] land and and when they would come
[57:24] against it well then they went down and
[57:26] the Bible tells the story of how they
[57:27] went to the Valley of the salt pits and
[57:29] all the kings they were they were
[57:31] destroyed down in this Valley but
[57:33] including in that was the kings of Sodom
[57:35] and Gomorrah they fell the Bible said
[57:37] they fell in the salt pits and so when
[57:39] they fell within the Four Kings of this
[57:41] this new headship and this new uh this
[57:43] new Union that had been created that
[57:45] would take over this this place that was
[57:47] a promised place that was prom you
[57:49] realize that the land that Abraham was
[57:51] on was a place that was promised to him
[57:53] by God but but all around him this great
[57:55] Union begin to take place and all around
[57:57] him this this headship and this kingship
[58:00] uh was established but but but but after
[58:02] a little while they they go in and they
[58:04] as they Rebel they these Four Kings they
[58:06] go and they destroy them and they take
[58:08] all the people captive and they they
[58:10] they they took all their land and they
[58:11] plundered them every everything that
[58:13] they had they stole their possessions
[58:14] they stole their land they stole their
[58:16] children they stole their wives they
[58:18] took their families and they they locked
[58:20] them in Chains and made slaves out of
[58:22] them and they drove them into other
[58:23] lands and they took them out of their
[58:24] own country and they took them as their
[58:26] own possession I thought isn't it
[58:27] something that the enemy would come into
[58:29] a place and take people as his
[58:31] possession it was it wasn't just the
[58:33] land that they wanted it wasn't just the
[58:35] Bible would tell you that because they
[58:36] took the people and they locked them
[58:38] away and They carried them off with them
[58:39] I thought it's just like the devil that
[58:41] he would come in to a place and what his
[58:43] desire is brother Mark is to take the
[58:45] possession of people and and take and to
[58:47] take your your families and your loved
[58:49] ones and your children and the fathers
[58:50] and mothers and and to take them captive
[58:53] and to pull them into this place but you
[58:55] realize that in included in this
[58:56] captivity there just happened to be a
[58:58] man by the name of lot and the Bible
[59:00] would tell us that lot just by chance
[59:02] you can call it if you want to but but
[59:04] but lot just happened to be the the the
[59:06] nephew of a Son of God the very one by
[59:09] the name of Abraham that had received a
[59:11] promise from God and the Bible says when
[59:13] Abram had heard that his brother was
[59:15] taken captive that he armed his trained
[59:18] servants that was born into his house
[59:20] 318 and he pursued them unto death and
[59:23] he divided himself against them he and
[59:25] his servants by night and he smoked them
[59:28] and he persuade and he pursued them unto
[59:30] hobah which is on the left hand of
[59:32] Damascus and he brought back all of the
[59:35] goods and he brought back also his
[59:37] brother lot and all of his goods and he
[59:39] brought back the women also and the
[59:41] people you know why brother Mark because
[59:43] God had ordained him to bring them back
[59:46] I thought you said well how did he go
[59:47] get them because God had given them to
[59:50] him it was a part of the promise that
[59:52] God had given Abraham when he left out
[59:53] of that place and God said you're going
[59:55] to go into to a land but I give that I
[59:57] shall give you let me tell you a secret
[59:59] friends that when God gives you
[1:00:00] something then it's yours how many how
[1:00:02] many say that with me when God gives you
[1:00:04] something it's yours brother Sean
[1:00:06] preached this yesterday morning about
[1:00:08] Caleb and going into the the mountain
[1:00:10] that God had given him he said something
[1:00:11] different about Caleb that when Caleb
[1:00:13] came into the mount heon he said give me
[1:00:16] my Mountain he didn't say give me a
[1:00:18] mountain give me some Mountain I'll
[1:00:20] settle for a little bit less I'll take
[1:00:22] whatever you'll give me but when Caleb
[1:00:24] stood up on before the mountain that God
[1:00:26] had given him he said I want my mou and
[1:00:28] he and he began to lay claim on it and
[1:00:30] brother Mark whenever he made his claim
[1:00:31] he didn't back down from it you me tell
[1:00:33] you what Caleb done he stood up on the
[1:00:35] promise of God he stood against what
[1:00:38] other men would come by and tell him
[1:00:40] that they couldn't have it other people
[1:00:41] would come by and tell him it was too
[1:00:43] great of a battle and other other spies
[1:00:45] you remember how the story went the
[1:00:46] Bible said that when they went in to the
[1:00:48] promised land that that Joshua asked the
[1:00:51] the 12 Spies to go in and to spy out the
[1:00:53] land that God had promised the children
[1:00:55] of God and see if it was time that they
[1:00:57] could go possess it and you know how
[1:00:59] whenever they came back with the mark
[1:01:01] they came back and there was 10 spies
[1:01:03] that said yeah there's Giants in the
[1:01:04] land and it ain't and there ain't no way
[1:01:06] we can take it but there was two men
[1:01:08] that came back with them they didn't go
[1:01:09] against and say there ain't no Giants
[1:01:11] they didn't say there ain't going to be
[1:01:12] a trial they didn't say there ain't
[1:01:14] going to be a problem they didn't say
[1:01:15] there's going that it's going to be an
[1:01:17] easy battle they said yeah the Giants
[1:01:19] are there but we've got a promise of God
[1:01:21] that we can take this land we got a
[1:01:23] promise of God that everything God has
[1:01:26] given us that we have the right to
[1:01:28] possess and Caleb stood upon the word of
[1:01:31] God and the Bible said because Caleb
[1:01:33] stood when the other man wouldn't that
[1:01:35] God looked at those men he said I'll say
[1:01:38] that the land that I swear to your
[1:01:39] fathers neither shall any of you be able
[1:01:42] to inherit because you provoke me he
[1:01:45] said but unto my servant Caleb he said
[1:01:48] because he had another spirit with him
[1:01:50] let me tell you friends he was anointed
[1:01:52] by a different Spirit he said he had
[1:01:54] another spirit with him and he followed
[1:01:56] me fully then him will I bring into the
[1:01:58] land where he went and his seed shall
[1:02:01] possess it and you know what Caleb done
[1:02:03] brother Mark he resisted the 10 spies
[1:02:06] and the lies that they were telling and
[1:02:08] that theology that that great giant
[1:02:10] theology that they came back preaching
[1:02:12] to the church that nobody could could be
[1:02:14] a part of it and and the days of
[1:02:15] Miracles has passed and God can't move
[1:02:18] in a church anymore and God can't take
[1:02:20] somebody's broken and Men them it's the
[1:02:22] giant theology that when you go so far
[1:02:24] that there ain't no way back that that
[1:02:26] God's done with you and and you can go
[1:02:28] so far that that the mercy of God's out
[1:02:30] of your life it's giant theology but let
[1:02:33] me tell you what a prophet of God said
[1:02:34] he said you may spurn the mercy of God
[1:02:37] but you'll never exhaust his grace I
[1:02:39] thank God this morning for a theology
[1:02:42] that's greater I thank God for a word
[1:02:44] that's greater than any giant theology
[1:02:46] that's been preached over the lives of
[1:02:48] God's children he said well he he went
[1:02:51] in there brother Mark you know what he
[1:02:52] done he said your reports a lie and we
[1:02:55] can take this land plan because God said
[1:02:57] we could the word says different how
[1:02:59] many say this I'm going to take my
[1:03:01] promise I'll take my promise you said I
[1:03:03] can't be free but I'll take what the
[1:03:05] promise of God said you said we can't
[1:03:07] have no liberty in the house of God but
[1:03:08] I'll take the promise of God you said
[1:03:10] God can't save my children but I'll take
[1:03:12] the promise of God you say he can't fix
[1:03:14] our problem but I'll take a promise of
[1:03:16] God over any giant theology that would
[1:03:19] come into the house of God it may seem
[1:03:22] like it's too big it may seem unsolvable
[1:03:24] it may seem un pixable that's giant
[1:03:27] theology but God said yes I
[1:03:30] can he said we can come to the house of
[1:03:32] God let me tell you when God gives you
[1:03:33] something you can have it this is what
[1:03:36] happened with Abraham the Bible said he
[1:03:38] could possess the land because God give
[1:03:39] it to him but Abraham said when God gave
[1:03:41] him that land he gave him everything
[1:03:43] that was on it God gave it to him and
[1:03:45] lot was a part of that land and Abraham
[1:03:47] had a right to it he could lay hold on
[1:03:49] it and claim it he said now God you made
[1:03:51] the promise that this lamb was and all
[1:03:53] that was in it was mine you made the
[1:03:55] promise
[1:03:56] and now my Kinsman has been taken and
[1:03:58] he's all but gone see he had a right to
[1:04:01] go get him and he went to war why the
[1:04:04] authority of God was upon him he stood
[1:04:06] toet to Toe with the devil and you
[1:04:08] realize brother Mah that when the Seed
[1:04:10] of Abraham came to lay claim on a Son of
[1:04:13] God that they had been taken captive
[1:04:15] captive and forced into the the
[1:04:17] authority of of this evil King that when
[1:04:20] he came when the Seed of Abraham came
[1:04:22] the Bible said that the enemy began to
[1:04:25] flee
[1:04:26] and and Bible said Abraham he pursued
[1:04:28] him from Dan in the daylight he pursued
[1:04:31] after him in the night time he pursued
[1:04:33] after him he pursued him down to Dan He
[1:04:36] pursued him down to hoba brother Mark in
[1:04:38] there he slayed him you know you know
[1:04:40] you know what that word hoba means it
[1:04:42] means a hiding place I thought my isn't
[1:04:44] this so good that there that whenever
[1:04:46] they when Abraham came after them that
[1:04:48] they went to hobah they they fled that
[1:04:50] these Kings and their armies and and all
[1:04:52] of them that would take the possession
[1:04:54] of God's child brother Mark but when
[1:04:56] Abraham took a stand upon the word of
[1:04:58] God that the enemy fled to what was
[1:05:00] called a hiding place but it didn't save
[1:05:02] him it didn't matter where he went to
[1:05:04] hide it didn't matter what part of hoba
[1:05:06] that he went into but the Bible said but
[1:05:08] but Abraham and his trained servants
[1:05:11] they went down into the land of hobah
[1:05:13] and he slew him there you know what that
[1:05:15] tells me that there ain't nowhere that
[1:05:16] Satan can go that he can hide from a
[1:05:18] trained servant of God but when God
[1:05:20] gives you the ability and the authority
[1:05:22] to be able to take the possession of
[1:05:24] what belongs to you then Satan can't
[1:05:26] hide from you let me tell you friends
[1:05:28] there ain't nowhere in this building
[1:05:30] that Satan is Sav there ain't nowhere in
[1:05:32] this world that Satan is safe from a son
[1:05:34] and daughter of God cuz my Jesus said he
[1:05:36] said the meat shall inherit the earth
[1:05:39] this Earth is your possession th this
[1:05:41] world is your possession this universe
[1:05:43] belongs to the children of God there
[1:05:45] ain't nowhere in the world that the
[1:05:47] devil can hide from a son or daughter of
[1:05:49] God a trained servant of God it's your
[1:05:52] possession every promise of God belongs
[1:05:54] to you brother say see he said the meat
[1:05:57] shall inherit the earth we are
[1:05:58] possessors of the earth you say what is
[1:06:01] a possessor of the Earth the believer
[1:06:04] said the believer has a title an
[1:06:05] abstract Deed by Jesus Christ that he
[1:06:08] shall be possessor of this entire Earth
[1:06:10] that's right he shall inherit the earth
[1:06:12] so you know what we do we do the same
[1:06:14] thing that Abraham done why do we stand
[1:06:16] in a pull pit with such resolve why why
[1:06:18] do we why we surrender Our Lives to the
[1:06:20] Holy Ghost to allow God to move because
[1:06:22] we had the same promise that Abraham had
[1:06:24] but Mark he said look what now we can
[1:06:26] take the promise of Abraham because
[1:06:28] Abraham done that and because Abraham
[1:06:30] obeyed the Lord and because Abraham was
[1:06:32] our example and he by faith went out and
[1:06:34] he fought and he took what was his now
[1:06:37] we as Believers today can take that same
[1:06:39] promise of Abraham and apply it to every
[1:06:42] problem that we Face apply it to every
[1:06:45] situation every money problem every
[1:06:47] family problem every Church problem
[1:06:50] every every every uh uh marriage problem
[1:06:53] you can take this promise and apply to
[1:06:55] every problem that you have you can go
[1:06:57] to your brother that's sick say the
[1:06:59] Cancer's got his body you say but Lord
[1:07:01] here's my brother he's laying there
[1:07:03] tricking stricken with cancer but you
[1:07:04] said so and I'll lay a hold of the
[1:07:06] promise of God it's my possession you
[1:07:09] told me so he said then you can go after
[1:07:12] that enemy that devil and you can
[1:07:13] Slaughter it just the same way that
[1:07:15] Abraham slaughtered the Kings and
[1:07:17] brought them back into his possession
[1:07:19] the promise is to the believer see we've
[1:07:22] got a right got a right we're trained
[1:07:24] Servants of God Holy Ghost filled men
[1:07:26] and women they're trained Servants of
[1:07:28] God you got to go you got a right to go
[1:07:30] anywhere to get the people of God to get
[1:07:33] to get the joy back in your life to get
[1:07:35] the the promises that God has given you
[1:07:38] every promise in the Bible it belongs to
[1:07:40] you it belongs to your family you
[1:07:42] deserve
[1:07:44] it but notice what happened at the end
[1:07:47] of this battle he was coming back from
[1:07:49] this great
[1:07:50] Victory and Revival the Bible would say
[1:07:53] but when he came back he met this man
[1:07:56] MDC now Paul would write about it in
[1:07:59] Hebrews the 7th chapter he said for this
[1:08:00] mzc the king of Salem priest of the most
[1:08:03] high God who met Abraham returning from
[1:08:05] the slaughter of the Kings and he
[1:08:07] blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a
[1:08:09] tenth part of all first being by
[1:08:11] interpretation king of righteousness
[1:08:14] after that also the king of Salem which
[1:08:16] is the king of Peace he was without
[1:08:18] father he was without mother without
[1:08:20] descent having neither beginning of days
[1:08:22] nor ending of life but he was made like
[1:08:25] unto the Son of God and he abideth a
[1:08:28] priest continually see there's been many
[1:08:30] thoughts surrounding this life of mecdc
[1:08:33] brother BR preached the whole message on
[1:08:34] it on who is this mecdc many would say
[1:08:36] well this mecdc this man that came to
[1:08:38] meet Abraham after this battle he was
[1:08:40] just a myth some would say he was just a
[1:08:42] priesthood it was a it was a symbolic
[1:08:44] priesthood many uh take that that school
[1:08:46] of thought that it was a symbology or it
[1:08:48] just meant something today but but he
[1:08:50] said but notice it can't just be that
[1:08:52] because the Bible would say in the
[1:08:53] fourth verse of Hebrews he said now
[1:08:56] consider how great this man was so here
[1:08:59] Paul would let us know that he said who
[1:09:01] who who under patriarch Abraham he gave
[1:09:03] s the SP say see this person was a man
[1:09:06] brother Mark so in order Paul said him
[1:09:07] to be a man in order for him to be a man
[1:09:10] well he had to be a person see he he had
[1:09:12] to have a personality so he wasn't an
[1:09:13] order he wasn't just a a priesthood
[1:09:16] order neither was he a myth but melaz
[1:09:18] DIC was actually a person somebody say a
[1:09:20] person but let me tell you something
[1:09:22] about this person since we found he's a
[1:09:24] person but he was no ordinary person for
[1:09:27] the Bible would say that this person he
[1:09:29] was an eternal person remember what the
[1:09:30] Bible said he said he had neither father
[1:09:32] nor mother he had no beginning of days
[1:09:35] and he had no ending of life in other
[1:09:37] words he was there he he he didn't come
[1:09:39] into existence you realize what what
[1:09:41] what else could it be that have no
[1:09:43] father and no mother and no beginning
[1:09:44] and no ending he was a person but he was
[1:09:46] an eternal person said see so so so if
[1:09:49] he's Eternal guess what brother Mark
[1:09:51] it's the best part if he's an eternal
[1:09:53] person then that same one that met with
[1:09:55] Abraham that day is still here this
[1:09:59] morning see he's an eternal person so
[1:10:01] that very person that walked down and
[1:10:04] had communion with Abraham that same
[1:10:06] person is still here this morning he had
[1:10:08] no beginning of days he had no ending of
[1:10:10] Li so in 2024 don't think because of the
[1:10:13] chaos of the world and the wrecked up of
[1:10:15] politics that all of a sudden that there
[1:10:17] ain't nowhere to turn and there's
[1:10:18] nowhere to go and there ain't nothing to
[1:10:20] to put your faith or your confidence in
[1:10:22] they said this same person he's still
[1:10:24] here today day he had no beginning of
[1:10:27] days he had no ending of Life said see
[1:10:29] so there only one person it could be if
[1:10:31] it's an eternal person it would have to
[1:10:34] be God because God's the only one that
[1:10:37] is eternal now let me tell you why the
[1:10:39] church world can't can I just teach it
[1:10:41] for a minute the the church world can't
[1:10:43] see this the reason they don't see it is
[1:10:45] because their teaching of the godhead is
[1:10:46] off see the church teaches it like this
[1:10:49] is that that that there was one God in
[1:10:51] three persons if you would talk to
[1:10:52] somebody that that would teach you about
[1:10:54] Trinity they would say well he's one God
[1:10:56] in three persons you really you realize
[1:10:58] how how odd that is see because the very
[1:11:00] word person means an individual so how
[1:11:02] could it be one God with in three
[1:11:04] persons it it means individual it means
[1:11:07] single or separate or independent
[1:11:08] solitary isolated or one with a
[1:11:11] personality so God he for him to be one
[1:11:15] God in three persons see it it wouldn't
[1:11:17] even it wouldn't even make sense but God
[1:11:19] he's not one God with three
[1:11:21] personalities I know we meet a lot of
[1:11:23] people like that but God ain't like that
[1:11:24] he God not bipolar he isn't isn't a God
[1:11:27] that has all kinds of different
[1:11:29] personalities he it's not a it's not
[1:11:31] three different persons but he is
[1:11:32] actually one God in different offices
[1:11:35] see that's the way that's the only way
[1:11:37] that God could say it like this in the
[1:11:38] Bible he said I am the Lord thy God and
[1:11:42] I change not see so he had to be God he
[1:11:44] said I am one I am one God there's only
[1:11:47] one God the Bible would tell us that he
[1:11:48] said and I change not so if it's God and
[1:11:51] God don't change he can't be one person
[1:11:53] today and another person tomorrow and a
[1:11:55] different person the next day so so it's
[1:11:57] not the multi-personality God but the
[1:12:00] reality of it is is that that that God
[1:12:03] came in the form or in different forms
[1:12:06] like you would you would take a play and
[1:12:08] you'd watch an actor that he would come
[1:12:09] out on a stage and you realize if you go
[1:12:11] to a big drama somewhere in in New York
[1:12:14] City or something and and you know that
[1:12:16] there may be one person and they play
[1:12:18] many roles in the play so they'll come
[1:12:20] out and they're dressed a certain way
[1:12:22] and and they're the they're they're the
[1:12:23] good guy and my the the princess has
[1:12:25] fallen in love with the prince and but
[1:12:27] they didn't have enough actor to to to
[1:12:29] have the villain and so he goes back
[1:12:31] behind the curtain and he changes the
[1:12:32] clothes into the villain and he comes
[1:12:34] back out as a villain now he's a totally
[1:12:36] different person but it's really the
[1:12:37] same actor the whole time so see so what
[1:12:40] happened is is that that he actually
[1:12:42] changed his mask or his face and so when
[1:12:44] we read this about God the Bible would
[1:12:46] tell us that there's a Greek word that
[1:12:48] explains God it was the Greek word in
[1:12:50] morphe that word inor would mean to
[1:12:53] change your mask and so we see that that
[1:12:56] that this is written in Mark the 16th
[1:12:58] chapter you'll find the story of the two
[1:13:00] men that went on the road to emus you
[1:13:02] remember when they were walking along
[1:13:03] these disciples and the Bible said that
[1:13:05] Jesus when he had came up out of the out
[1:13:07] of the the grave and he went out and he
[1:13:09] heard them talking along the way
[1:13:10] remember they had all that negative talk
[1:13:12] and how everything was falling apart and
[1:13:14] their savior was gone and and now they
[1:13:17] the very thing they put confidence in
[1:13:18] everything fell apart and I it ain't
[1:13:20] going to work no more we may as well we
[1:13:22] may as well go back to the old life but
[1:13:23] while they were in the middle of all
[1:13:24] this Tau the Bible said but Jesus put on
[1:13:28] another form he he appeared to them in
[1:13:31] another form that same word in the
[1:13:33] scripture was in morphe he appeared to
[1:13:35] them in another form in so much that as
[1:13:38] he walked along with them they never
[1:13:39] knew who he was they never recognized
[1:13:41] him they did they didn't recognize where
[1:13:43] where where he came from or why don't
[1:13:45] you know are you a stranger around here
[1:13:47] they asked do you not know what's going
[1:13:48] on why do you talk this way what manner
[1:13:50] of communications is these do you not
[1:13:52] know what's happened they've took our
[1:13:54] savior and they crucified him they begin
[1:13:56] to tell Jesus all their problems in the
[1:13:58] whole time it was the same God in
[1:14:00] another form the Bible said Mark 16:12
[1:14:03] he said he appeared to them in another
[1:14:05] form unto the two of them but you notice
[1:14:07] when Paul would pick this up in
[1:14:09] Philippians 2 he would say it again he
[1:14:11] said God listen he said said Jesus in
[1:14:14] Philippians 2:6 being in the form of God
[1:14:18] thought it in Mor being in morphe of God
[1:14:21] in the form of God he thought it not
[1:14:23] robbery be to be equal with God but then
[1:14:26] he made himself of no reputation and he
[1:14:28] took upon him the what the form of a
[1:14:31] servant Im morphe so he said here Jesus
[1:14:34] that was in the form of God put upon the
[1:14:37] form of a servant and he was made in the
[1:14:40] likeness of men so he shows us that
[1:14:42] after all this it was God the whole time
[1:14:44] but R says see that's what God did it's
[1:14:46] the same God all the time it was God in
[1:14:48] the form of the father God in the form
[1:14:49] of the spirit the pillar of fire that
[1:14:51] same God was made flesh and he dwelt
[1:14:53] Among Us in morphe and he brought out so
[1:14:56] he could be seen and now that same God
[1:14:58] is the Holy Ghost it's not three Gods
[1:15:01] it's three offices or three acts of one
[1:15:03] God well friends think about this
[1:15:05] morning what it would do to you if you
[1:15:07] could ever catch a revelation that the
[1:15:09] very God of creation the god of Moses
[1:15:12] that was there and that came in the form
[1:15:14] of the pillar of fire and the god of the
[1:15:16] Hebrew children that that that was the
[1:15:17] fourth man walking in the fire that if
[1:15:19] you could ever get a revelation that
[1:15:21] that same God came in the form of the
[1:15:23] Holy Ghost and the Very creator of
[1:15:25] Heaven and Earth and the one that walked
[1:15:27] with Abraham and the one that walked
[1:15:29] with Moses is standing in this building
[1:15:31] this morning that has appeared under the
[1:15:32] church in another form if we could get
[1:15:34] past the MK of humanity and see the
[1:15:37] revelation of God and realize that God
[1:15:39] the Creator he wants to speak to you
[1:15:41] it's God the Creator he wants to have
[1:15:44] communion with his children he wants to
[1:15:46] help you he wants to he wants to
[1:15:48] encourage you he wants to give you
[1:15:49] strength he wants to give you life it's
[1:15:51] the same God in the form of the Holy SP
[1:15:55] spirit so when he comes in the form of
[1:15:58] the Holy Ghost but Mark we come to the
[1:16:00] house of God that's what we come here
[1:16:02] for we come to worship God we come in
[1:16:05] there if people come by what are they
[1:16:07] doing in there why are they why are they
[1:16:09] making this noise but you realize but we
[1:16:11] come here to worship God why because God
[1:16:13] is here I know what I know what the the
[1:16:15] the people say well I can just worship
[1:16:16] God anywhere I don't have to go to
[1:16:18] church well that's that's wonderful for
[1:16:20] you but there ain't that ain't really
[1:16:21] true you can't just worship God anywhere
[1:16:23] I've heard people I've heard preachers
[1:16:24] say you can worship God anywhere I
[1:16:26] thought well I I I I used to live a
[1:16:28] wicked life I know what it's like to be
[1:16:30] in a bar and I ain't never seen anybody
[1:16:32] in a bar worshiping God I ain't never
[1:16:34] seen anybody they may be worshiping but
[1:16:35] it ain't God they're worshiping I've
[1:16:37] been to a lot of ball games I ain't
[1:16:38] never seen anybody at a ball game
[1:16:40] worshiping God they may have their hands
[1:16:41] in the air they may be shouting and
[1:16:43] dancing and moving around but it ain't
[1:16:45] God that they're
[1:16:47] worshiping but we come to the house of
[1:16:49] God we don't come to worship a man we
[1:16:51] come to worship God in the author Office
[1:16:55] of the Holy Ghost we come to entertain
[1:16:57] him in the office of the Holy Ghost here
[1:17:00] he would come amongst us brother Mar so
[1:17:02] we come and we come you say well why
[1:17:03] don't we come to church because it's
[1:17:05] pleasing to God the Bible said forsake
[1:17:08] not to assemble yourselves together so
[1:17:11] our assembly this morning let me show
[1:17:12] you the importance of what we're doing
[1:17:14] here cuz I know how the devil just tries
[1:17:16] to make it not important let me tell you
[1:17:18] why it's important to have your children
[1:17:19] in church and and and fathers and
[1:17:21] mothers be in the house of God because
[1:17:23] it it is a our assembly here is a
[1:17:26] scriptural assembly do you realize that
[1:17:29] us Gathering here this morning is a
[1:17:31] scriptural assembly it was ordained of
[1:17:33] God for us to be in this place following
[1:17:35] the scripture we come and it's not just
[1:17:37] a ritual the church where would look at
[1:17:39] us it's a ritual it's just a religious
[1:17:40] gathering or something like that but the
[1:17:42] reality is is that the presence of the
[1:17:44] Holy Ghost separates us from a
[1:17:45] ritualistic Christianity the presence of
[1:17:48] the Holy Ghost makes all the difference
[1:17:50] we're not here just to go through
[1:17:51] motions we're not here to make a bunch
[1:17:53] of Racket we don't come just just to
[1:17:55] make uh just to just to be seen or or or
[1:17:57] just to work up some move or something
[1:17:59] try to get people excited so they'll
[1:18:01] come back and put money in the offering
[1:18:02] plate that ain't got nothing to do with
[1:18:03] while we're here we come to entertain
[1:18:06] the person of the Holy Ghost we come to
[1:18:08] worship we don't come to worship a
[1:18:10] pullit or some music we come to
[1:18:12] entertain the person of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:14] we give our lives to him we give our
[1:18:16] voices to him we give our our our hands
[1:18:19] and our feet and everything that we have
[1:18:21] and and to entertain the person of the
[1:18:23] Holy Ghost We Come and sing songs and we
[1:18:26] create an atmosphere that God could be
[1:18:28] welcomed in we begin to pray and we pray
[1:18:30] till we get our hearts right and our
[1:18:32] spirit clean before God so that God can
[1:18:34] come in the church and he can minister
[1:18:35] to his children we we start pulling on
[1:18:37] the gift of God with sincerity that we
[1:18:40] could receive some spiritual food many
[1:18:43] people they come in the house of God and
[1:18:45] they go home and they're unsatisfied you
[1:18:47] say well brother Matt what happened well
[1:18:48] they failed to get a revelation of the
[1:18:50] order of receiving see they missed the
[1:18:53] order of receiving then miss the
[1:18:55] revelation of what it takes to come in
[1:18:57] the house of God and get something from
[1:18:59] God they've been caught in a trap
[1:19:01] because Satan has taken people and he's
[1:19:03] so focused them on everything that's
[1:19:04] going on around them that they can't see
[1:19:06] what God is
[1:19:08] doing so focused on everything that
[1:19:11] everybody else is doing that we can't
[1:19:12] see what God is doing friends if you
[1:19:14] could peer through the glass this
[1:19:16] morning and see the hand of God working
[1:19:18] and see what God is doing with his
[1:19:20] children and what he's building and what
[1:19:22] he's working that that it ain't just
[1:19:24] some man manm made thing but God is
[1:19:26] doing something Supernatural in our
[1:19:28] midst you realize every great thing that
[1:19:30] ever took place that we read about in
[1:19:32] history and great moves of God but
[1:19:34] whenever they were taking place I'm
[1:19:36] certain that those men and women felt
[1:19:38] like you and I do well we're just trying
[1:19:39] to We're just trying to do our best to
[1:19:41] serve the Lord we ain't
[1:19:43] much but they did what God told them to
[1:19:45] do and we read about them we testify
[1:19:49] about the great things that God done in
[1:19:51] their life Satan gets us focused on
[1:19:53] everything's going around around and if
[1:19:55] we're not careful all of a sudden people
[1:19:57] get to talking they talk about
[1:19:58] everything every problem you don't go
[1:20:00] home and fellowship around the word of
[1:20:02] God what where we ought to be as a
[1:20:04] family we ought to go home from church
[1:20:06] and and as a father you say boys wasn't
[1:20:08] that some good preaching this morning my
[1:20:09] didn't you catch that why' you'all get
[1:20:10] out of that service this morning that's
[1:20:12] what we ought to be talking about but
[1:20:13] instead people go home and the only
[1:20:15] thing on their mind is what everybody
[1:20:16] else was doing but you see the way she
[1:20:18] was dressed did you say see the way he
[1:20:19] was acting I can't believe he was
[1:20:21] talking about I can't believe they were
[1:20:22] doing this and we're talking about the
[1:20:24] wrong thing
[1:20:25] and before long I'm y y'all can kick me
[1:20:27] out if you want to but it's the gospel
[1:20:28] truth we get to talking about the wrong
[1:20:30] thing and before long our children over
[1:20:32] here the com see you thought I was
[1:20:33] talking about the kids I'm not talking
[1:20:35] about the kids I'm talking about their
[1:20:36] influencers and before long they get
[1:20:38] getting around their parents and they
[1:20:40] hear all this negative spe and before
[1:20:42] long they begin to pick up on it and
[1:20:43] they and then when they come to church
[1:20:45] they come to church all out of order and
[1:20:47] now they're looking at the things that
[1:20:48] you've drawn attention
[1:20:50] to who in the world would want their
[1:20:52] children coming to the house of God with
[1:20:53] a spirit of C criticism on them who
[1:20:55] would want their children to come to the
[1:20:56] house of God with a spirit of division
[1:20:58] on them why would we preach that to our
[1:21:01] kids one day they get old enough to do
[1:21:04] their own thing let me tell you what'll
[1:21:06] happen all the seeds that you planted
[1:21:08] will start manifesting in their life the
[1:21:11] seeds that Satan brought by and he
[1:21:13] anointed you to speak and he and you
[1:21:15] planted them in their life and you
[1:21:17] watered them with your with your
[1:21:18] testifying of all the negative things
[1:21:20] that's going on around the world they
[1:21:23] manifest in that child's life yeah then
[1:21:25] they become critical they get critical
[1:21:27] going to church they they develop
[1:21:29] complexes they quit coming around you
[1:21:32] say Well they're that's cuz they're
[1:21:33] unbelievers and you know they left us
[1:21:34] cuz they ain't no part don't don't sell
[1:21:36] me that why ain't they around it's cuz
[1:21:39] they're bad no that ain't it it's
[1:21:41] because there's so much
[1:21:43] pressure there's so much pressure you
[1:21:45] realize what's happening is that here
[1:21:47] God is dealing with his children and
[1:21:50] he's pulling upon them and he's and
[1:21:52] there there's a there's a something in
[1:21:54] them and it's yearning to serve God and
[1:21:56] here God is pulling on them they come to
[1:21:58] the house of God and they feel that that
[1:22:00] pull they feel the tug of the pressure
[1:22:02] of God and then the whole time then they
[1:22:04] got this other thing that's coming on
[1:22:05] the other side and while God's pulling
[1:22:07] it's pushing on them and it's putting
[1:22:09] pressure and it it's criticism and and
[1:22:12] it it's pushing them away and hear God
[1:22:14] trying to bring the word and they can't
[1:22:15] get out of that that critical spirit and
[1:22:17] look around and making fun at everybody
[1:22:19] and all this and and all the things that
[1:22:21] everybody's done so you know what they
[1:22:23] do they say it's easier if if I just
[1:22:24] stay
[1:22:28] home we just we just stay home you know
[1:22:31] what they'll do at home they'll
[1:22:35] die from spiritual
[1:22:37] starvation they're not
[1:22:39] fed they lay there can you imagine your
[1:22:42] children laying
[1:22:44] starving what kind of father wouldn't
[1:22:46] feed them what kind of mother wouldn't
[1:22:48] feed them the Bible says that about our
[1:22:50] Lord he wouldn't give Stones when they
[1:22:52] were when they needed bread he wouldn't
[1:22:54] give you something to replace of bread
[1:22:56] he'll feed your bread s we come we go to
[1:23:00] church brother Mark why don't we go to
[1:23:01] church cuz it's pleasing to God we want
[1:23:04] to keep an atmosphere in the church
[1:23:06] because it's pleasing to God yall y
[1:23:07] don't mind if I get off my message a
[1:23:08] little bit but it's pleasing to God I
[1:23:11] believe that ought to be the desire of
[1:23:12] our heart we ought to we we ought to
[1:23:14] have a desire to please God how many can
[1:23:15] lift your hands this morning say brother
[1:23:17] mat that's my desire I want to be
[1:23:19] pleasing to God let my life be pleasing
[1:23:21] to God let let everything I do be
[1:23:24] pleasing to God let me tell you friends
[1:23:25] there's a reason why this church means
[1:23:27] more to me than just fulfilling a duty
[1:23:29] this is a sanctuary of God it's a place
[1:23:32] that is that is kept holy it's a place
[1:23:35] that we are that we ought to that we
[1:23:37] ought to to keep as a holy place we
[1:23:39] don't we don't run around and and and
[1:23:40] act silly and do things like that in the
[1:23:43] house of God it's a sanctuary that's
[1:23:44] dedicated to God I know that's foreign
[1:23:46] today I know that churches they they're
[1:23:49] in gymnasiums and all this stuff and
[1:23:50] they do they just kind of swap it around
[1:23:52] and they and and it's never there's a
[1:23:54] dedicated place but this is a place that
[1:23:56] is dedicated to God it's dedicated to a
[1:23:59] to a pull pit that God could come and he
[1:24:01] can speak to his children that's why
[1:24:03] when you come in the house of God that
[1:24:05] we have deacons that sit in the back of
[1:24:06] the building to to help keep an
[1:24:08] atmosphere for God that things don't get
[1:24:10] out of order that's why when you kids
[1:24:12] come up here and y' and y'all have the
[1:24:13] choir and y'all sing y'all don't mess
[1:24:15] around and act Goofy and run around and
[1:24:17] holler and disrespect the choir director
[1:24:19] but you come solemnly humbly before God
[1:24:22] and you practice and you do your work
[1:24:23] and you back out of the temple of God
[1:24:25] the place that God has built a sanctuary
[1:24:28] where he would meet his children I
[1:24:29] believe there ought to be established
[1:24:31] some some some government over the house
[1:24:33] of God I believe it ought to be
[1:24:34] established in our hearts that this is a
[1:24:36] place of worship that isn't some place
[1:24:38] it ain't a lodge it's a place where God
[1:24:41] can come and meet his children it's a
[1:24:43] place that when you walk your children
[1:24:45] through their doors that they walk in
[1:24:46] with humility CU they know they're going
[1:24:48] to meet
[1:24:49] God it's God's
[1:24:51] house we come in the house of God we
[1:24:54] don't abuse it we don't walk in we don't
[1:24:56] we don't scream and make a fuss and and
[1:24:58] and act foolish and silly in the house
[1:25:00] of God we walk in reverently because
[1:25:02] it's a dedicated place for God to meet
[1:25:04] his children this is God's
[1:25:07] Sanctuary I know our I know our our our
[1:25:09] lives is the place where God dwells but
[1:25:11] don't ever underestimate the place the
[1:25:13] building that must be dedicated to God
[1:25:16] the order that must be kept in a place
[1:25:18] you realize that brother maram said that
[1:25:20] that a person a child with the wrong
[1:25:22] attitude just running across can can
[1:25:23] grieve the the Holy
[1:25:25] Spirit I don't know we don't want to
[1:25:27] grieve the spirit of God our number one
[1:25:30] goal brother Mark is that that the
[1:25:31] person of God of Jesus Christ the person
[1:25:34] of the Holy Ghost would be welcome in
[1:25:36] this place it's our sanctuary and we
[1:25:39] ought to keep it
[1:25:41] holy it's the truth we dedicate Our
[1:25:45] Lives to the church a holy Place said
[1:25:48] that's what we ought to do he said when
[1:25:50] Jesus came into the the the house of
[1:25:52] worship they were buying and selling and
[1:25:53] and plating ropes you know what Jesus
[1:25:55] done he drove them out he said we don't
[1:25:56] want him to do that here so let's just
[1:25:58] dedicate our lives and our church and
[1:26:00] our task our service and everything we
[1:26:02] have to the kingdom of God how many can
[1:26:05] join with me on that let's dedicate our
[1:26:07] lives and our church and our task and
[1:26:09] our services and everything we have to
[1:26:12] the kingdom of God I made a vow to God
[1:26:16] when I started pastoring this church I
[1:26:18] promis God that I would study the word I
[1:26:21] would spend time in prayer and I would I
[1:26:23] would surrender my life life and my gift
[1:26:25] to him that he would use that gift to
[1:26:27] help his children and then I made a vow
[1:26:30] to the people here that I would do my
[1:26:32] best to be a pastor and be truthful and
[1:26:35] honest and and rightfully divide the
[1:26:37] word of God and keep this pull pit a
[1:26:40] holy place and not put men behind it
[1:26:43] that wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:26:44] and that wouldn't preach the
[1:26:46] truth so made a promise to God I made a
[1:26:49] promise to people you know but you know
[1:26:51] but Mark I ain't the only one that had
[1:26:52] to make a vow
[1:26:54] every one of us had to make that same
[1:26:56] vow I wonder how many that today could
[1:26:58] say brother Matt I want to I want to
[1:27:00] make that kind of a vow to God we want
[1:27:02] to make a vow to be real brothers and
[1:27:04] sisters in Christ we want to make a vow
[1:27:07] to one another to be to be elders and
[1:27:09] and to be able to to raise our children
[1:27:11] and help the families that are in need
[1:27:13] we make a vow as our deacons I I want
[1:27:15] our deacons to have a vow before God
[1:27:17] that they'll be deacons and they'll
[1:27:19] they'll be an example in the community
[1:27:21] of what it's like to be a deacon in in
[1:27:23] the in the in the church to the Living
[1:27:24] God that is just some that that that
[1:27:27] just some people put in some office do
[1:27:28] you realize that these ain't men called
[1:27:30] officers they're God called officers a
[1:27:32] pastor ain't a man called office there's
[1:27:34] too many pull pits filled up with
[1:27:36] pastors that were put there by men but a
[1:27:38] pastor according to the scripture is a
[1:27:40] god called office it's God that raises
[1:27:42] men and God establishes them in
[1:27:44] communities and God raises up churches
[1:27:46] and God anoints them with the word of
[1:27:48] God to preach to his children and to
[1:27:50] feed his sheep there's too many menade
[1:27:52] pastors and not enough God Made Men
[1:27:56] it's God that makes them to stand on the
[1:27:57] word of God it's God that calls deacons
[1:28:00] and we made a vow to God to keep the
[1:28:03] keep the spirit of God in this place our
[1:28:05] Sunday school teachers they they they
[1:28:07] got to make a vow to God to teach our
[1:28:09] children and to teach them truth and
[1:28:11] they not teach them some Doctrine that's
[1:28:12] different than what the than what the
[1:28:14] word says or or what's being preached in
[1:28:16] the church they're not trying to take
[1:28:18] the kids into some other order but they
[1:28:20] made a vow to your children that they'
[1:28:23] teach them right and they teach them the
[1:28:24] truth and they you realize how important
[1:28:27] it is I I know I'm getting way off you
[1:28:29] realize how important it is brother Mark
[1:28:31] for for a Sunday school teacher to teach
[1:28:33] our children that one of these days here
[1:28:35] they're teaching them they they go
[1:28:37] through class after class and then here
[1:28:39] in just a few days they come to the age
[1:28:41] of accountability where they have to
[1:28:42] make a decision brother Mark to give
[1:28:44] their heart to God and up until the time
[1:28:47] of that age they're taught in them
[1:28:49] Sunday School classes the very things
[1:28:52] that that that will help them that's
[1:28:54] nurtured in into their life that will
[1:28:56] help them whenever they come to that
[1:28:57] place to meet God that they can
[1:28:59] recognize it's God that they're meeting
[1:29:02] when they come to that place and they
[1:29:03] come down to an altar after a move of
[1:29:05] the spirit of God but brother Wesley
[1:29:07] because what they've been taught in a
[1:29:09] little Sunday school room that people
[1:29:10] think so insignificant but because of
[1:29:12] what they've been taught they recognize
[1:29:14] the spirit of God and they can give
[1:29:16] their heart to God they know the
[1:29:17] promises of God and they begin to claim
[1:29:19] them 10 11 12 years
[1:29:21] old it's important The Vow that we make
[1:29:24] to God in every office our trustees make
[1:29:28] a vow to God to be honest handle the
[1:29:30] church and the funds and the things that
[1:29:33] come into the church and make sure
[1:29:34] everything's done in
[1:29:37] order every office our treasure makes a
[1:29:41] vow to God isn't it something to think
[1:29:44] isn't it wonderful to know that you can
[1:29:45] put offerings in a church and you can
[1:29:47] that the deacons would take up the
[1:29:49] offering and they can hand it to a
[1:29:50] treasure and to the this day there ain't
[1:29:52] ever been one single penny ever missed
[1:29:55] and there never will
[1:29:56] be you know it may seem like a little
[1:29:58] thing but in the world it's a great big
[1:30:01] thing to think that a man would have a
[1:30:03] vow to God to be truthful our ministers
[1:30:06] made vows to God to preach the truth to
[1:30:10] live a life that is above reproach to
[1:30:12] have a to have a standard of living with
[1:30:13] their families or to be able to be an
[1:30:16] example to the people and the young
[1:30:17] people handle
[1:30:20] situations just like we would handle
[1:30:22] them if I was gone and and you had to
[1:30:24] talk to brother Joe or and brother Mark
[1:30:25] and they help you they'd handle it the
[1:30:27] same way I would because we're all in
[1:30:28] unity for the same thing we're not we're
[1:30:31] not working in different directions we
[1:30:33] don't we don't have three churches in
[1:30:34] Grace Tabernacle there's
[1:30:36] one and we're here for the same purpose
[1:30:40] that we can
[1:30:41] grow in the word of
[1:30:43] God every one of us make a vow janitors
[1:30:46] the cooks the grounds Keepers the don't
[1:30:48] matter how big the the the musicians the
[1:30:50] singers make a vow to God we don't come
[1:30:53] to to play music to to entertain anybody
[1:30:55] but we come to worship God I know we got
[1:30:58] a lot of kids that play music but that's
[1:31:00] cuz we didn't have nothing else and I
[1:31:01] think we ought to just train them up and
[1:31:02] let them do something in the house of
[1:31:04] God instead of serving the devil their
[1:31:05] whole life I thank God that we have some
[1:31:08] young people that have a desire on their
[1:31:09] heart to do something for
[1:31:12] God it's easy it's easy to look at all
[1:31:15] of them and say well if they just do
[1:31:17] this different why why they why are they
[1:31:19] just act acting silly outside well it's
[1:31:21] because they're kids
[1:31:24] this should be true they're just kids
[1:31:26] and we do our best to raise them and to
[1:31:28] teach them to come in the house of God
[1:31:29] my son he could tell you when he comes
[1:31:31] up to the to them drums you know what
[1:31:33] instructions I gave him he I think he's
[1:31:35] a great drummer he's he he he they're
[1:31:37] both they're they're learning they're
[1:31:39] they're not the best they know that but
[1:31:40] they're learning they're doing a good
[1:31:42] job but you know what I tell them here's
[1:31:44] my teaching here's what I tell him this
[1:31:46] is the most important thing is that you
[1:31:48] pray when you go up there and you make
[1:31:50] sure that there ain't nothing between
[1:31:51] you and God and when you sit down those
[1:31:53] drums you don't worry about the people
[1:31:55] and you don't worry about what's going
[1:31:56] on don't be looking at your friends and
[1:31:57] talking to your friends but you play
[1:31:59] that drum and you worship God on it just
[1:32:01] like David said in the Bible he said
[1:32:02] I'll praise him on the High symbol and
[1:32:04] I'll praise him on the low symbol I'll
[1:32:06] praise him on the string instrument I'll
[1:32:07] praise him I'll praise him with my voice
[1:32:09] I'll praise him with my singing let
[1:32:11] everything that has a breath praise you
[1:32:12] the Lord but dedicated to God everything
[1:32:16] we do in this place we're a body
[1:32:18] Believers and we come to dedicate
[1:32:21] ourselves we made a vow to God how many
[1:32:22] can lift your hands say brother I made
[1:32:24] that same vow if you haven't how many
[1:32:26] lift your hand say let me make it now
[1:32:28] let me make a vow to God that I could
[1:32:30] stand behind the word of God friends I
[1:32:32] believe God is calling this church to a
[1:32:34] higher place a higher level I know I
[1:32:37] know that there's been some great things
[1:32:38] that has happened in our church already
[1:32:40] I I hear from Brothers all the time that
[1:32:42] compliment our church and the work
[1:32:44] that's been done in this area Great Men
[1:32:46] of God that would say this this is the
[1:32:47] easiest place in the in the world to
[1:32:49] preach to there's just such a a freedom
[1:32:51] and liberty and the people get so behind
[1:32:53] the word of God and they and they just
[1:32:54] want to come preaching you wouldn't
[1:32:56] believe it but there there there's
[1:32:58] preachers all time that want to come
[1:32:59] preach it because they heard the
[1:33:01] testimony of what it's like and just
[1:33:03] have a have a place and the church is so
[1:33:05] behind the word of God there's a another
[1:33:08] Elder he called called me the other day
[1:33:10] and he got to talk about our young
[1:33:11] people he said you know what your church
[1:33:13] is doing it's setting the standard of
[1:33:15] how to handle young people in this
[1:33:16] message a standard of how to raise young
[1:33:19] children and and he said you're
[1:33:21] literally are setting a standard in your
[1:33:24] generation I thought that was a great
[1:33:26] compliment from an elder you know
[1:33:29] sometimes you look at oursel and feels
[1:33:30] like you ain't doing nothing right but I
[1:33:32] thank God that he would that he knows
[1:33:34] our desire but even in all that brother
[1:33:37] Mark that we're still moving to a higher
[1:33:39] level this church is moving to a higher
[1:33:42] level this Vision that God has given us
[1:33:44] it ain't it ain't just for it wasn't
[1:33:46] just for a little bit to get established
[1:33:48] and say well God's done with us we're
[1:33:49] going to a Rapture friends we're going
[1:33:51] to a Rapture and we're going to
[1:33:52] fellowship and we're going to win every
[1:33:54] show that we can we're going we're not
[1:33:56] going to leave anybody behind we're
[1:33:57] going to try to take everybody with us
[1:33:59] we're going to sigh and cry for the
[1:34:01] Abominations that are done in the
[1:34:03] city we want to please God that's our
[1:34:07] desire to be pleasing unto God I'll just
[1:34:10] say it like this I'm getting long but
[1:34:12] this is our assembly brother Wes Leia
[1:34:15] I'm proud of it I'm proud to have a
[1:34:16] place of of Fellowship it makes me proud
[1:34:19] as a pastor to see people come through
[1:34:21] those doors back there and they come in
[1:34:23] and they give their heart to God many
[1:34:25] times I think we're over 50s something
[1:34:27] people that's came in and and baptized
[1:34:30] just a few just a few years in this
[1:34:32] little assembly in a little Community
[1:34:34] but what happens when when they come in
[1:34:36] those doors they get baptized and they
[1:34:38] they give their heart to the Lord they
[1:34:39] come in they start having fellowship
[1:34:41] with us and that's a wonderful thing
[1:34:43] water baptism I think it's wonderful
[1:34:44] it's according to the Scripture it was a
[1:34:46] commission of God but you realize
[1:34:48] brother Mark all it does is you come in
[1:34:50] and it puts you into fellowship with the
[1:34:51] people and you come in the church you
[1:34:53] recognize that God has accepted you you
[1:34:55] you you you you express uh outwardly
[1:34:58] what God is doing on the inside but when
[1:35:00] you come through those doors and you go
[1:35:01] through baptism you receive water
[1:35:03] baptism it puts you in fellowship with
[1:35:05] everybody but friends that is not our
[1:35:07] goal that ain't Pastor mat's goal that
[1:35:09] ain't what I'm after that that ain't
[1:35:11] what we're trying to do is to get people
[1:35:12] to come through those doors but there's
[1:35:14] still yet another door that you have to
[1:35:16] enter but says see when you come in
[1:35:18] these doors he said it may put you in
[1:35:20] fellowship with everybody else he said
[1:35:21] but there's another door and this door
[1:35:23] that God put his name on and his name is
[1:35:25] Jesus Christ you say how do you get in
[1:35:28] his name how do you get in there well
[1:35:29] you got to be baptized into there by
[1:35:31] water no by spirit for the Bible said
[1:35:34] there's only one Lord and one faith and
[1:35:36] one baptism and it's a holy ghost
[1:35:38] baptism that's the door that we're
[1:35:41] trying to get people in it ain't the
[1:35:42] doors of Grace Tabernacle it ain't to
[1:35:44] fill up a bunch of pews with a bunch of
[1:35:46] people that just want to have a place to
[1:35:48] entertain one another but we're trying
[1:35:50] to get them in the door that they can
[1:35:52] have fellowship with God
[1:35:54] that they can call upon the name of
[1:35:56] Jesus but said we can do it we could
[1:35:58] call we could call on his name we could
[1:36:00] baptize we could speak the name of Jesus
[1:36:01] over here but it doesn't make it so but
[1:36:04] once the Holy Spirit really that genuine
[1:36:07] word of God comes into you then brother
[1:36:09] the message is no secret to you then
[1:36:12] when the genuine word of God is Born
[1:36:15] Into You see there's another door to
[1:36:18] enter into then brother Mark when you go
[1:36:20] through that door it changes everything
[1:36:21] about going to church when you go
[1:36:23] through that door you come to church you
[1:36:25] start singing I'm one of them them old
[1:36:26] fogy songs that that you used to be so
[1:36:29] critical about you come into the house
[1:36:30] of God you say man let's sing that song
[1:36:32] I'm one of them again I want I want I
[1:36:34] want everybody to know that God changed
[1:36:36] me brother brother Mark gets so excited
[1:36:38] he tells his testimony every Sunday
[1:36:40] morning that God changed me and he
[1:36:41] delivered me why cuz God done something
[1:36:43] for
[1:36:44] him I'm one of them you come in singing
[1:36:47] and praising the Lord you come in
[1:36:49] because you've been you've been born
[1:36:50] again then you say I'm in this church
[1:36:53] this glor church I didn't join I was
[1:36:56] born I had a new birth and some glorious
[1:37:00] day I'm going to Sail Away by his grace
[1:37:02] not by my works I'm in this church we're
[1:37:06] part of the Church of God we were born
[1:37:07] into it butam said there ain't but one
[1:37:09] church it's the body of Jesus Christ
[1:37:11] many has made it different things if you
[1:37:13] make it anything else there's many
[1:37:15] lodges that's been built up in this
[1:37:17] world for the mark and bearing that old
[1:37:19] Blasphemous name you say why could you
[1:37:21] say that so harshly because they speak
[1:37:23] speak against the word of God and
[1:37:25] blasphemy means to speak against
[1:37:27] something so when they take anything
[1:37:29] that God said and make it something else
[1:37:31] it's a Blasphemous name when the word of
[1:37:33] God says one thing and a church sets a
[1:37:36] different standard it's a Blasphemous
[1:37:38] name because they're disagreeing with
[1:37:40] the word of God let me tell you what
[1:37:41] they've done the Holy Spirit baptism was
[1:37:43] sent to the Church of the Living God and
[1:37:45] the world has replaced it the Catholic
[1:37:47] Church replaced it with a wafer the
[1:37:49] Protestant Church replaced it with a
[1:37:51] handshake the Pentecostal Church repl it
[1:37:53] with emotionalism but I thank God that
[1:37:56] there's still a people of God that
[1:37:57] recognize the person of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:00] and realize that there's a door that I
[1:38:02] can enter into that I can be one with
[1:38:05] him and then God can use you when you
[1:38:08] enter into this door brother Mark then
[1:38:11] God could use you that the music players
[1:38:13] want to come this
[1:38:14] morning God can get you so far into a
[1:38:17] place brother Mark that the devil don't
[1:38:19] even know what to do with you isn't that
[1:38:22] what happened with Moses he was a he was
[1:38:24] a little old old Prophet coming into
[1:38:26] Egypt with a stick in his hand but
[1:38:29] brother Wesley it didn't take long he
[1:38:30] just kept pling them he was that Pharaoh
[1:38:33] he was so plagued by the voice of Moses
[1:38:37] he got in there he brought flies he
[1:38:39] brought Li he brought fire he brought
[1:38:42] smoke he brought death he brought frogs
[1:38:45] darkened the skies made made the sun go
[1:38:47] down in the middle of the day black in
[1:38:48] the skies and finally Pharaoh had enough
[1:38:51] of it and he just said get out
[1:38:54] out get out of
[1:38:57] here he was so surrendered to God that
[1:39:01] God could do so much with him that the
[1:39:03] devil didn't even want didn't even know
[1:39:04] what to do with him just get out of
[1:39:07] here get out of my presence take what
[1:39:11] yours and
[1:39:13] leave surrender to God brother said I'm
[1:39:17] so glad that a man can be so completely
[1:39:18] served god Till the devil don't know
[1:39:21] what to do with him that's right obey
[1:39:23] God so completely till the devil would
[1:39:26] just say get away from me I don't want
[1:39:28] to hear it no more I wonder if you stand
[1:39:30] to your feet how say brother man let me
[1:39:32] get to that place let me be so
[1:39:34] completely surrendered to God let me be
[1:39:37] so let me so completely serve God that
[1:39:39] the devil just says get away from me I
[1:39:41] don't even want to hear it no more let
[1:39:43] the words that come out of my mouth be
[1:39:45] the testimony of Jesus Christ let me
[1:39:47] testify of the works of God till the
[1:39:49] devil don't even want to be in your
[1:39:50] presence when you come around they avoid
[1:39:53] you and off where you going I can't be
[1:39:55] around him I know what he's going to say
[1:39:57] he's going to say well you ought to be

[1:39:59] things boy he's changed a lot of lives I
[1:40:01] saw a little girl the other day whatever
[1:40:03] she was sick in her body and God healed
[1:40:04] her but the devil don't want to hear it
[1:40:06] get away from
[1:40:07] me cuz they're going to testify of the
[1:40:10] works of God I believe that I believe we
[1:40:13] can be so completely surrendered to him
[1:40:15] so close to God it ain't no wonder the
[1:40:17] devil hates his church but am mark
[1:40:19] because when everything goes wrong he
[1:40:21] finds a people of God that are still
[1:40:23] praising God oh you hear me friends when
[1:40:26] he brings pressure on your life you
[1:40:28] still come in the house of God and you
[1:40:30] still got your hands raised and you know

[1:40:36] hands brother you know God forsake you
[1:40:38] why are you raising your hands you know

[1:40:43] praising
[1:40:44] God it's you you serving him the whole
[1:40:47] time when you got in this mess why would

[1:42:06] heart places that the enemy would hide
[1:42:09] away that he didn't think God could get
[1:42:12] to but under the anointing of the Holy
[1:42:15] Ghost God begins to go into the heart of
[1:42:17] a man into that little land of

[2:03:27] great battle brother K and the battle
[2:03:29] was won and the battle was over he won
[2:03:32] his victory brother Mark that's when MDC
[2:03:35] met him the Bible said he was the king
[2:03:38] of Salem the king of
[2:03:40] Peace he said brother M said is what he
[2:03:42] showing us he said melic met him he gave
[2:03:44] him wine and bread showing that after
[2:03:46] this Earthly battle is over we will meet
[2:03:48] him in the heavens and take communion
[2:03:50] again in that great wedding supper Jesus
[2:03:52] said I'll drink no more with you of the
[2:03:55] vine or eat fruit or eat drink with you
[2:03:57] until uh we are Anew in my father's
[2:03:59] Kingdom that there'll be communion with
[2:04:02] him after the battle is over but brother
[2:04:04] Mark you know what whenever he came in
[2:04:06] this hour and you fought every battle
[2:04:08] and you've overcome every battle said
[2:04:11] then you can say I want to serve him he
[2:04:14] sold out the things of this world he
[2:04:16] said I won't take any the possessions of
[2:04:18] Sodom you know what Abraham done he
[2:04:19] turned down everything they offered him
[2:04:21] he said I'll just take what mecdc has to
[2:04:23] offer said he took and turned it all
[2:04:26] down and that's what we are doing we
[2:04:27] turned down the things of this world
[2:04:29] have you met mecdc since the battle was
[2:04:31] over said I was 21 years old one day and
[2:04:34] I had a battle with all kinds of things
[2:04:36] I wanted to be a fighter I wanted to be
[2:04:38] a Trapper I wanted to be a hunter I
[2:04:39] wanted to be all these things but then I
[2:04:41] met
[2:04:42] mecdc and he gave me communion and ever
[2:04:45] since that day it was settled forever
[2:04:48] I've went on his side and I've been
[2:04:49] rejoicing on the road and that's why one
[2:04:52] day I know when that role is Called Up
[2:04:54] Yonder and it calls us into the air that
[2:04:56] I'll be with him I'll be a part of the
[2:04:58] marriage supper of the Lamb why because
[2:05:00] we met MDC brother Mark that's what
[2:05:02] we're doing this morning we come to have
[2:05:04] a spiritual communion with him oh how
[2:05:07] many he's living in Victory today how
[2:05:09] many say brother Matt the battle's over
[2:05:11] I don't you don't have to keep going
[2:05:12] through the same battle that's what the
[2:05:14] devil does he'll put you through the
[2:05:15] same battle tomorrow that you went
[2:05:17] through yesterday but there comes a time
[2:05:19] when the children of God say the battle
[2:05:21] is over
[2:05:23] and then MDC came in and he entertained
[2:05:25] him and he brought his own wine and he
[2:05:27] brought his own bread and said Abraham I
[2:05:29] want to have fellowship with you the
[2:05:31] Battle Is Over let's have
[2:05:34] communion we want to have a spiritual
[2:05:36] communion with him I know about his
[2:05:39] peace a't that what he does he's the the
[2:05:43] king of peace brother Mark he's the king
[2:05:46] of
[2:05:47] War the King of the great battle he
[2:05:50] conquered every King and after the
[2:05:52] turmoil of all day and all night of
[2:05:56] pursuing and weary oh Abraham went back
[2:05:59] from that battle and came dragging back
[2:06:02] into the
[2:06:03] tent here come El kazmc said let me feed

[2:06:10] the battle's over when you're weary when
[2:06:12] you're tired of fighting he'll give you
[2:06:14] Victory and I let me just settle in have
