[42:17] amen so we just uh just want to take a
[42:20] moment the day so just a as a special
[42:23] time to remember them and I want to
[42:24] share a testimony with you before before
[42:27] we uh take the prayer request and um we
[42:30] had over about um uh I guess March of
[42:35] last year my mom was in the hospital and
[42:39] uh she was she was on her deathbed
[42:41] actually and they didn't have no way to
[42:43] uh I didn't mean to stop y'all I'm sorry
[42:46] sis um but they didn't have no way to uh
[42:49] uh to get her back to health they she
[42:51] needed a heart operation and wasn't able
[42:54] to operate on her she's had I believe
[42:56] she's on her eighth pacemaker since she
[42:58] was 17 years old she got her first
[43:00] Pacemaker and I don't know in the world
[43:02] how many people that's ever had eight
[43:04] pacemakers um it you know some of them
[43:07] say it's a record I don't know if they
[43:08] keep a record of it but that's a lot of
[43:09] times to have that surgery and so she's
[43:12] been through many heart surgeries open
[43:14] heart surgeries and and uh it's always
[43:16] been a part of our life I I took a
[43:18] pacemaker to uh to kindergarten for show
[43:20] and tail it's just always it's always
[43:22] been a part of us you know and and I
[43:25] remember when whenever she got one
[43:26] changed and recharged and we got our
[43:29] mama back and one one day she wasn't
[43:31] able to talk to us the next day she was
[43:32] running in the yard playing with us and
[43:34] so that's always we always remember you
[43:36] know remember that growing up but it got
[43:38] to this place last March and and uh and
[43:41] they had no way to to do anything with
[43:44] her and I remember going in the hospital
[43:45] and different ones that came by and she
[43:48] wasn't even able to get out of the bed
[43:49] or talk or or eat she hadn't ate nothing
[43:51] in days and I can't explain the what she
[43:54] looked like but it was just uh she
[43:56] couldn't even couldn't stand up and and
[43:58] we we thought at the moment that that
[44:00] something didn't change that it just be
[44:02] a few more days that she would be with
[44:03] us and uh we had prayer with her and
[44:06] different ones is praying for and and uh
[44:09] we just um saw the that next day we had
[44:13] got up and and and helped her get up and
[44:15] take a step in the in which was a big
[44:17] thing just to take one step and I asked
[44:19] her if she wanted to walk to the door
[44:21] that day and she said well you know she
[44:23] could barely whisper enough to you know
[44:24] kind of let you know she would and so it
[44:26] kind of scuffled to the door and she
[44:28] wanted to go a little bit down the hall
[44:29] and she kind of scuffled a little down
[44:31] the hall and then they had to bring her
[44:33] back but we already seen in one day that
[44:35] the Lord had you know given her a little
[44:37] bit of strength and and uh the doctors
[44:40] wouldn't wouldn't give her the surgery
[44:42] cuz it would kill her and they just said
[44:44] she'll never be able to survive it and
[44:46] so they had Specialists from other
[44:47] states trying to make it where they
[44:50] would do it and and so we worked on our
[44:52] strength to be able to have a operation
[44:54] to get the valve and stuff replac placed
[44:57] again and and uh so they finally went
[45:00] through with that and still the recovery
[45:01] has been a long time and so we kind of
[45:03] made a goal with her as a family to to
[45:06] make uh uh 10,000 steps in a day uh and
[45:09] so we kind of put a a a Target out there
[45:13] and and a reward for her and tried to
[45:14] get her to work on it since that time
[45:16] and and uh this week we went our family
[45:19] went with went with my mom and and uh
[45:21] went to took the kids and lot of her
[45:23] granddaughters and was with her and we
[45:26] um we were out I guess it was last
[45:28] Tuesday and for the first time since
[45:30] March of
[45:31] 2023 she walked almost six miles in one
[45:34] day see there
[45:40] amen so we just thank the Lord that I
[45:43] mean I I was there the day she couldn't
[45:45] hardly take one step and so just to see

[53:02] 100 last time we was with you we ended
[53:05] actually on this um these couple Psalms
[53:09] we'll be reading this morning
[53:19] and Psalms 101 says Make a Joyful Noise
[53:25] unto the Lord Lord Can someone say
[53:27] praise the Lord in other words David was
[53:30] recounting his benefits and giving
[53:34] thanks to his
[53:36] God serve the Lord with gladness come
[53:40] before his presence with singing know
[53:43] you that the Lord he is God and
[53:48] he that have made us and not we
[53:52] ourselves we are his people and the
[53:56] Sheep of his
[53:57] Pastor the Lord is my shepherd I shall
[54:01] not wand and enter into his gates with
[54:05] Thanksgiving and to his courts with
[54:07] praise be thankful unto him and bless
[54:12] his name amen can you say praise the
[54:15] Lord this morning have you take your
[54:17] seats this morning
[54:28] now we've we preached many times on
[54:31] David
[54:33] and and the situations that David seemed
[54:37] to get himself into and how the enemy
[54:40] brother Mark was constantly chasing him
[54:42] and things was always
[54:45] transpiring and I thought about this
[54:47] this morning as I was meditating and
[54:50] looking upon these things and I believe
[54:52] there was a
[54:54] reason that David was attacked
[54:57] I believe there was a reason why the
[54:59] devil was upset with
[55:02] David cuz no matter what David went
[55:05] through he would continue encourage
[55:09] himself by the word and he would recount
[55:13] his God's benefits and he would give
[55:16] thanks to God and Brother David no
[55:20] matter what David went
[55:22] through there was a Melody down inside
[55:25] of David's heart that no matter how much
[55:29] pressure Saul put upon him no matter
[55:32] what how many javelins was throw upon
[55:34] and take his life there was a Melody
[55:37] that was placed down there not by David
[55:40] not by the church not by his friends but
[55:44] it was placed there by almighty God and
[55:47] that Melody no matter what happened to
[55:49] David a been kept singing a song in his
[55:53] life he kept praising his God and bless
[55:56] blessing his name and amen and he would
[55:59] make statements like Psalms 23 amen the
[56:02] Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[56:05] amen the one thing that David knew he
[56:08] said it's not my myself it's not my
[56:11] ability I didn't make myself it was God
[56:14] that anointed to me it was God that
[56:17] gives me strength it is God that though
[56:19] I walk through the shadow of the of
[56:22] death I fear no evil for thou art with
[56:25] me th rod and th sta thou comfort me
[56:29] amen that was a Melody down inside of
[56:32] David's heart and then sister Vana no
[56:34] matter what he went through that Melody
[56:37] can never be silenced and I thank God in
[56:40] 2024 The Darkest Hours that we're living
[56:43] in there is a Melody that's been placed
[56:46] in The Bride of Jesus Christ's heart and
[56:49] no matter what TR uh what transpires in
[56:52] our life no matter what kind of Darkness
[56:54] that we're facing could never ever
[56:56] silence the melody that God put down in
[57:00] our
[57:01] hearts we sing because we're
[57:05] happy we praise him because it's a
[57:07] Melody down inside of our hearts they
[57:10] said it like this it's just like fire
[57:14] shut up in my
[57:16] bones can you say amen
[57:21] amen Psalms 92 David make this statement
[57:25] he says though those that be planted in
[57:27] the house of the Lord shall
[57:30] flourish they should grow they should a
[57:34] achieve they should
[57:35] Thrive they should sore like
[57:38] eagles listen he said when the 120 went
[57:41] in the upper room there came a sound
[57:44] like a from Heaven Like A Mighty Wind it
[57:47] blew open the doors it flew open the
[57:50] windows and out in the streets these men
[57:53] went testifying under the power of the
[57:56] impact of the Holy Spirit they were
[58:00] strongly affected by The Presence of
[58:03] Jehovah it changed them listen to what
[58:06] brother B said here he said but all of a
[58:08] sudden the Dynamics came and he said
[58:12] what did it do if not only filled their
[58:15] spirit inside but it quickened their
[58:18] mechanics their bodies would quickened
[58:20] they were no more cowards they went
[58:22] right out in the face of the people you
[58:25] men of Judea and all that dwell in

[58:50] that comes it changed
[58:54] them it done something to

[59:09] again brother Brown said it changed them
[59:13] it quickened them it made them
[59:18] different oh aren't you glad to be
[59:20] different Brother David this morning
[59:23] Hallelujah they were changed people
[59:26] that's right it quickened them from the
[59:28] old life of being a coward to the like
[59:31] the line of the tribe of Judah they
[59:34] absolutely face mortal nailed to the
[59:37] cross crucified upside down they was
[59:40] burnt throw in the Lion's Den but there
[59:42] were no more cowards death had no
[59:45] victory over them at all the Dynamics
[59:48] was in the mechanics he said yes sir it

[1:00:31] changed beforehand there was cowards
[1:00:34] they was afraid they couldn't speak

[1:00:38] underneath that presence they had
[1:00:42] boldness amen and they had strength they
[1:00:46] had

[1:02:00] stronger win than this to keep the
[1:02:03] Believers for possessing the gates of
[1:02:06] their
[1:02:08] enemy it's not because we come to Grace
[1:02:11] Tabernacle it's because the greater is

[1:05:16] milk and honey flowing just like God
[1:05:19] said it would
[1:05:22] be Morgan I I thought of this this

[1:07:16] taskmasters whip for all these years

[1:42:00] cold and we found out that this Cod was
[1:42:03] good for any of those makers whatever
[1:42:05] game they made it was good for
[1:42:07] it you remember up up down down left
[1:42:11] right left right ba
[1:42:16] start huh and all of a sudden the the
[1:42:20] screen would flash
[1:42:23] and all of a sudden everything would
[1:42:25] change you had unlimited power you have
[1:42:29] unlimited strength and I thought about a
[1:42:32] a Cod that's been broken in this day and
[1:42:35] a book that's been opened up in our hour
[1:42:38] amen that begin to let us know the

[1:43:11] turtle that used to come down that
[1:43:13] little that
[1:43:15] blocked brother day we figured
[1:43:19] out we can wait on that devil until he
[1:43:22] got to about that third
[1:43:24] block and then all of a sudden we push
[1:43:26] the B button to

[1:43:48] lives oh thank God hey B we would have
[1:43:52] never know that but somebody told us
[1:43:53] that and we believed him and we tried
[1:43:58] it amen we've got a message and I don't
[1:44:00] you want to tap it with this but I
[1:44:03] believe this message has gave us a Cod
[1:44:06] and it broke everything everything that
[1:44:09] we have the need of to sweep us from the
[1:44:11] garden to Eden to a Rapture was broke
[1:44:15] under the
[1:44:17] seals and it let us know exactly where
[1:44:20] we came from and it let us know exact ly
[1:44:23] where we're going to and it let us know
[1:44:25] we're trapped in
[1:44:27] time and it told us when that devil gets
[1:44:30] to that certain spot I want you to
[1:44:36] jump and ride that enemy all the way
[1:44:39] back to Camp I'm riding on it I'm riding
[1:44:43] on it I'm riding on
[1:44:46] it I believe that cold has unlocked
[1:44:50] unlimited resources
[1:44:56] that code if I could say it like this
[1:44:58] could be the Holy
[1:44:59] Spirit and the Holy Ghost is designed to
[1:45:02] dissolve any enemy standing between you
[1:45:07] and your
[1:45:08] promises and brother would say like this
[1:45:11] that great contest has been going on for
[1:45:14] many years it started in the heavens and
[1:45:18] Satan was kicked out on the earth then
[1:45:20] it becoming enemies of God's people and
[1:45:23] since then he used all of his strength
[1:45:26] and strategy to try to pull God's people
[1:45:28] across the fires and we know who has the
[1:45:32] most power does God does and God when he
[1:45:36] gave his people the best thing he could
[1:45:38] do to combat Satan with was his word
[1:45:43] because the word of God who's stronger
[1:45:45] than God the word is God and the word
[1:45:48] becomes our
[1:45:51] strength God in his church can't say
[1:45:54] with me this morning God in
[1:45:58] Me God in
[1:46:00] us becomes the strength to pull Satan to
[1:46:06] his own fires that he's made and the tug
[1:46:10] goes on Hallelujah I say the code's been
[1:46:15] Broken Hallelujah the code has been
[1:46:18] broken I've got to really

[1:48:44] that he chose a bride knowing he would
[1:48:46] fall from disbelieving the word knowing

[1:48:51] that would not fall
[1:48:53] they would hold to the word regardless
[1:48:55] what the rest of the world said about it
[1:48:57] they would hold to the word how many

[1:49:01] morning see he says and taking the word
[1:49:04] and making up his church Eve see back to
[1:49:06] himself again Redeemed by the blood that
[1:49:09] was given from his
[1:49:11] body and there there would be a Time

[1:49:17] in the fullness of the godhead
[1:49:19] digity now he says a preeminence in a

[1:49:26] anointed people to bring back anointed
[1:49:28] Bride for his bridegroom you see it now
[1:49:32] he said what Eve turned down he's coming

[1:49:38] do this don't you do that you can do
[1:49:41] this and you can't do that Satan said oh
[1:49:44] you know but she turned around and
[1:49:46] listen to him but the eve and the last

[1:50:18] deception she was made to fall
[1:50:24] but the second
[1:50:26] Eve because the Cod has been broken in
[1:50:29] our
[1:50:30] day told us that first Eve fell but this
[1:50:35] second Eve she's
[1:50:39] predestinated she's not going to fall
[1:50:42] she's predestinated to this glorious
[1:50:45] stand so one was made for deception and
[1:50:49] the fall the other Eve was made God came
[1:50:53] down in his mind before the foundation
[1:50:56] of the world by for knowledge he could
[1:50:59] predestinate and he could place seeds
[1:51:02] down inside of you not at an altar
[1:51:05] sister Destiny but before the foundation
[1:51:07] of the
[1:51:08] world God broke the

[1:51:42] God can lay there dormant for so long
[1:51:46] amen but there's a predestinated moment
[1:51:47] of time where that seed will have to
[1:51:50] come to life
[1:51:55] before God listen don't you love it
[1:51:59] don't you love the message and how it

[1:53:15] different in our in our
[1:53:18] learning but God sister Vanna God
[1:53:25] and Jesus will make a statement be you
[1:53:28] therefore
[1:53:32] perfect how's the
[1:53:36] way then Jesus we find him saying there
[1:53:39] hanging on a cross between Heaven and
[1:53:41] Earth he screamed out it is
[1:53:47] finished and that word finished comes
[1:53:50] from the same root word
[1:53:53] that be you
[1:53:56] perfect and I believe that's exactly
[1:53:59] what he was saying God spoke it through
[1:54:02] Jesus Christ be you therefore perfect
[1:54:05] and Christ and when when he was dying on
[1:54:07] the cross let you know sister Tammy you

[1:54:37] flaws he don't even know they
[1:54:41] exist and
[1:54:46] Jesus Oh what Amazing
[1:54:50] Grace and when you're buried in
[1:54:57] Christ it begins to dissect your past
[1:55:03] and goes
[1:55:06] back and it lands upon the enemy and it
[1:55:09] lays
[1:55:11] there and when God looks through the
[1:55:13] blood of Jesus Christ he sees
[1:55:17] me why is though this
[1:55:20] morning he sees me redeemed SE by the
[1:55:23] blood of Jesus Christ and brother
[1:55:26] Brandon broke the Cod and he said there

[2:28:16] ministers that had Fellowship halls and
[2:28:19] uh I've always been that kind of a
[2:28:20] person I don't uh I try to find some
[2:28:22] people that have some wisdom on
[2:28:23] situations that that I haven't been to
[2:28:26] yet so I've never had a fellowship off
[2:28:27] so uh just to find a way to uh be able

[2:28:41] just to keep order and uh of how things
[2:28:44] will be though it it's going to be fair
[2:28:46] for everybody if you've talked to Sarah
[2:28:48] over the last few days she's not going
[2:28:49] to be in charge of that um but just
[2:28:52] because we didn't have it listed we're
[2:28:53] going to put a calendar in there for
[2:28:54] people to be able to use it um but if
[2:28:57] there's any questions or concerns or
[2:28:59] dates or or questions or anything about
[2:29:01] it I'm going to be the person to call so
[2:29:03] if you have any questions about it and

[2:29:11] about it she's only going to ask me the
[2:29:12] question and the response you're going
[2:29:14] to get is going to come from me uh so
[2:29:16] she's not going to go anywhere different
[2:29:18] than what I would say so uh we want to
[2:29:20] do that and be able to have it as a
[2:29:23] place that the church could be able to
[2:29:24] use and and I know it's it's a lot of a
[2:29:28] building a lot of expenses and uh things
[2:29:30] so uh we want to just try to uh keep as
[2:29:33] in as much order as we can and and allow

[2:29:41] that up there and we'll kind of go over
[2:29:43] go over that and um just to be that
[2:29:46] everybody could have opportunity to use
[2:29:48] it we want everybody in the church to be
[2:29:49] able to benefit from it uh it was your
[2:29:52] efforts and money that built it and so
[2:29:54] we want you to be able to to have the
[2:29:55] benefit from it so uh but we'll we'll
[2:29:58] kind of go over that uh next week you

[2:30:16] next Wednesday I don't know that young
[2:30:18] man looks sharp there just he loves the
[2:30:21] Lord and my just a wonderful I think
[2:30:22] it's a good Zeal in the heart of a young
[2:30:24] man uh to want to dedicate their life to
[2:30:27] the Lord and and it's been on his heart
[2:30:29] and asked his parents so we just want to
[2:30:31] remember that this afternoon I guess uh
[2:30:34] I know it's Mother's Day and many will
[2:30:35] be with their Ms and things so we uh we
[2:30:39] appreciate that and um but we'll
[2:30:41] probably just come back there about uh I
[2:30:44] would say about 5:00 or so because it
[2:30:46] may be a a different you know times
[2:30:49] getting in and out of restroom and stuff
[2:30:50] will be a a little bit later so if
[2:30:52] that'll be okay with his mom and dad
[2:30:55] then that's then that'll that'll work so

[2:31:25] our our spirit to be moved Lord we never
[2:31:27] want to get into that callous condition
[2:31:29] in our life and Lord where bitterness
[2:31:32] and things would come up and and keep us
[2:31:35] from being able to have love one for
[2:31:37] another and God being able to receive
[2:31:39] you Lord we know that there's that your
[2:31:42] spirit is a timid spirit and Lord I know
[2:31:44] how the enemy would be so careful to
[2:31:47] make an atmosphere where that you
[2:31:49] wouldn't feel welcome but Lord we as a
[2:31:51] body of Believers we have a right to
