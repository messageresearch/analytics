and um y y'all don't know what it's like when you miss out on all the song services but for six years I've missed out on most all of them so um if I get a little sideways every now and then or want to sing a little extra well now you know why so um I love to sing and I hate to miss song services but um but we just uh just have to do our part so you love the Lord tonight amen so let's read uh acts the 17th chapter the 22nd verse the Bible said then Paul stood in the midst of Mars's Hill and he said you men of Athens I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious for as I passed by and beheld your devotions I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown God whom therefore you ignorantly worship Him declare I unto you God that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is the Lord of Heaven and the Earth dwelleth not in temples made with hand neither is he worshiped with men's hands as though he needed anything seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the Earth and hath determined the times before appointed in the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the Lord and H if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring and I want to speak to you tonight as you take your seats on a Temple of Praise a Temple of Praise now uh here Apostle Paul I know this is a very common uh portion of scripture we have read this many times over the years and uh but we realize that Paul here when he come to this place he was uh on his second missionary journey jne he had arrived in Athens and he was awaiting uh Silas and Timothy to come and join him to continue uh on their missionary trip and uh as he was waiting uh for this here in in Athens here this uh this town that was known for its diversity of philos philosophers and and religions and so here was a uh it was a a great uh town of this nature and and but while he was waiting and maybe he was sitting up in a hotel or wherever Paul was dwelling at but here he was waiting and looking across Athens and he noticed that everywhere he looked there was idolatry when he went to the market there was idolatry in the Market at the at the eating place it was idolatry in the synagogue it was idolatry and I thought here was a man that was an apostle and he was waiting to go on a missionary trip here here he was in here he was in Paul's mode and but in Paul's mode he noticed all the idolatry and so something the Bible says something be to steer at Paul's heart and so he went out into the market and he got to talking to him about Jesus and about the resurrection and and and then he went to the synagogue and the Bible said anybody he could get to talk to him about and Paul would tell him about the Lord and how that he had went and he was crucified and resurrected and you know after a little while in this place as Paul would speak of the Resurrection uh to the men of Athens it it was a strange Doctrine to hear about somebody resurrecting from the dead and and and so as they would hear this they they begin to think about Paul and say well he he maybe he's a man that brings that besets strange doctrines and maybe he's just here to stir up strange things or introduce uh the the these strange things and so they took him up to the mountain of aragos or or or uh in the Greek it was Ari arios pagos which was the hill of Aries I don't know how many ever studied in Greek mythology but in Greek mythology this place of of the hill of Aris was actually uh uh said to be you know Aries which was the god of war in Greek mythologies it was said to be the place that Aris was put on trial because he murdered Poseidon's son remember because was um he had he had done a very foul act and and so in their in their mythology but there was a foul act that had taken place and so he had gone down and murdered him because of the act that he had done and and and so they put him on trial at the hill of Aries and so uh this isit you know through this time this was a great uh place in the land of Athens it was uh uh this this this hill or as the Romans would call it Mars's Hill instead of Aris it was Mars but uh but but this hill was a place that would be put on trial of anybody that had any religious crime and so it was for religious purposes there was a great altar there there was a temple there it was a it was a place so if someone would to come in and and they would commit something that crime based on religion this is where the wise men or the philosophers would take them up to the top of this place to try them and put them on trial after all this is a place where the gods had came and and so it it was a it was a great Temple grounds it was a it was a a a sacred place to the men of Athens and this uh this is the place they took Paul to which would be known as one of the greatest sermons that Paul ever preached it was the AR rapo sermon and so here when Paul would come up here and they would he would walk in I could just see Paul being led to this place and knowing the history of Athens and the history of of of of this mythology and here here Paul being a man that had been looking at all this idolatry and they leading him up on this mountain and and so he goes and he walks past this Altar and it says to the unknown God and all this is steering up in Apostle Paul's heart and here he's like man I'm I'm about to bring a revelation to these folks they're they're missing the reality of what a God really is and here we're talking about a myth and a mythology and a God that that that's never uh that no one's ever had any contact with and and so when Paul gets to this place he begins to speak to them this message and he starts to tell them that the real Temple is a temple that's not B made by the hands of men and so he and he answers the question that God had asked through the prophet Isaiah when he said the heaven is my throne and the Earth is my foot stol but where is the house that you build unto me and where is my place of rest Paul began to answer this question that there is a God and God is looking for a dwelling place and God wants to dwell among his children and God wants to be among his people but God ask where is this place that you're going to build me where's the house that you'll build me where's the place of my rest and you realize that that throughout the Bible since the time that God had asked this very question there's been many temples throughout the scripture we you can read about it in the in in the book of uh of Exodus and Moses when they went out into the Wilderness they built a Tabernacle in the wilderness which was for the purpose of being a temple to God in other words it was the place where God could come and dwell amongst his people but then they built the temple of Solomon remember Solomon built the Great temple then it was torn down and they built another Temple there but but these temples that God made was meant to be a place of worship a temple was a place of sacrifice it was a place to bring praise unto God so the temple of God is a Dwelling Place of the Holy Ghost can I say it like that and so when Paul would begin to speak he would talk about this temple of God and how that there's always been a temple and God had required a place of fellowship with man and Paul said in 1 Corinthians he said but know you not that you are the temple of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in you for If any man defile the temple of God then him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple you are somebody say Amen see you're the temple of God I know sometimes it's hard to come to that place to to to realize that we're a temple of worship or we're a Temple of Praise or a temple of God sometimes it's hard to look at oursel that way because when we look in the mirror we see this flesh and the and the in the failing of it but here Paul says but know you not that you are a temple of God you're the very thing that God had had in his mind the place of worship the the place of fellowship and you know because of the nature of our existence sometimes we are bound with within the framework of our own creation and we're we're limited to be able to see the things of God in this way although although although that there's something that is calling us even brother Mark do you realize that we're living in this world and because we're Bound in this existence but and and there's something calling us into another world but sometimes we just can't can't seem to get out of the one that we're in hello somebody sometimes we can't seem to get past this uh this world that we're in even though there's something that's pulling us and something that is drawing us that's what Peter said he said you are a chosen people that was called out of darkness in other words you've been pulled out of it it's a draw out of it something to bring you into another realm this is what Paul was speaking of he said through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God now notice he says worlds plural the worlds were framed by the word of God now I don't believe that Paul was speaking of Worlds like there was multiple Earths he wasn't talking about that there's Earth here and Earth there and they were all created by the or framed by the word of God but he wasn't speaking of multiple Earths but he was speaking of a world that you can see and an Unseen World he said see there's worlds a matter of fact Paul would say the things that are seen are not made of things which do appear what a paradox this is it's incredible brother the mark but it's true it's something that no man can explain but it's out of the Realms of the of the knowledge of humanity but yet it's a true thing the things that we see were made made by things that which we cannot see the scen was made by the Unseen in other words the world he said the world was made by the word of God and I got news for you it's the only thing that's keeping the world together is the word of God so the scene was made by the Unseen so what that tells us is that what you can't see is far greater than what you can see so if in this world see we are limited by the boundaries or the framework of this world and so we're limited by our thinking and we're limited by our teaching and the knowledge that we have we're limited by the boundaries of human ability we're limited by the boundaries of our creation but do you realize that though we're limited by these boundaries but beyond those boundaries brother Tom is a greater life this is what Paul is preaching about that here there's a boundary this is all you can see this is why you don't know what's going on but beyond this there's something that is calling you to a greater life beyond this there's another life it's something outside that's calling you it's a greater life a greater world it's a greater creation brother Mark than what we're than what we face in this life and it's calling you to this other world you know I I think about an unborn child and how he was in how he's in the womb of his mother and how I know the world today make up all this nonsense about it's not not alive and all this stuff until a baby's born but that's I'm not going to get into it but that's a lie of the devil the reality is is that you can take a child in the womb of its mother and you know in five weeks from the time of its conception the neural tube in a child is formed that's where his brain and his spinal cord comes from and here in the first five weeks this begins to form in the womb of a mother and then in in the sixth week he develops a heartbeat in the in in in the eighth week then uh the sensory receptors on his face and their mouth and and all of that begins to be developed where a child in just in just eight weeks from the time of conception can start feeling things and then those sensory uh those sensory receptors that they go from the mouth and then into the hands and the feet and they start feeling little things and and then after a few weeks 16 weeks he can hear sounds 18 weeks they start to respond to the sounds of an outside world in 20 weeks they hear and they begin to react to familiar sounds within 24 weeks a child in the womb is reacting to specific voices so it knows it's it's able to differentiate the voice of a mother and the voice of a father or The Voice or something that they come in C in just 24 weeks even in their womb they react to these specific voices and then they begin to feel the effects of the outside world they can feel pain they react to pain they move uh they they they move and they're affected by an outside world you masas that's ever carryed babies could testify that when you get in a certain position and baby gets uncomfortable they begin to move why they're jostling for position they're they're trying to trying to make some room because they feel the effects of an outside world they they hear sounds of an outside world they they react to an outside world they move because of an outside world but even though they feel the effects of an outside world and even even though they hear sounds of an outside world still yet they are bound by their habitation so here they want to move and maybe they're trying to get comfortable but because of the boundaries of their habitation they can't move their hands can't move very far their feet can't move I know some of y'all masas are are are carrying some of them around right now I know Vanna bless her heart she's got two at 24 weeks they started a fight club in there I'm sure but the they're trying to trying trying to see who's going to be the best but she's got she's got twins coming but but but but they to this place that they're Bound by habitation and and so it don't matter how uncomfortable it is or maybe there's something that they hear there's something that's calling them there's something that that that that caused them to be to begin to react but they really don't know what to do with it they don't have the knowledge of it yet they're still bound up in darkness in the womb of their mother Bound by the limits of habitation but then all of a sudden they come to a place of a birth oh Hallelujah and when they come to a birth Brother David what happens is that Unseen World becomes reality that Unseen World it comes alive and now those same sounds have images and th those muffled voices become clear and although they may not understand it all but I know this that a newborn baby certainly sees things differently than it did when it was in the womb of its mother and let me tell you what else its arms and its legs have a little more freedom it's fre it moves out a little more it starts pinching at your face and those little fingernails they Claw at you and grab your grab your nose and and you why because they can move a little bit more freely cuz they're outside of the boundaries of their former habitation you me tell you what happens brother tomorrow they begin to feed and they grow and the more they eat the more they grow they gain knowledge they start to crawl then to walk then to run unless it was Malachi he scoot crawl or scoot walked and ran but but but they they they all they're growing and eating and feeding and and for the first six months you're trying to to teach them the language you're you're trying to teach them how to speak and do you realize in the my may as well preach anyway but do you realize in the first few years of a child's life that you can teach them any language and they they tell you if you want to have a child that learns several languages the best time to do it is when they're a baby that they can learn the language I thought why why why in the world will we hide it from them what we believe and why will we hide it from them and say Well they're not big enough for it so we need to scale the message down where it's something that that they can comprehend but I say if we're going to learn the language let's go ahead and learn the language you're Sons and Daughters of God you've been bought by the blood of Jesus Christ you were bought into this world called of God sent here for a purpose they begin to learn the language and they get and as they you know you spend six months trying to teach a kid to say his first word spend the next 18 years trying to get it to quit talking but but you're trying to they're they're growing you realize that not that that you know it's not that they weren't living before but Mar they were very much alive everything we know about Humanity says that child was alive in the womb but it was confined by a boundary but a birth takes you beyond the boundary that can find you it brings you into a whole new world a world that is beyond the limitations of our former existence it's what a birth does it brings you oh my you remember you remember the story about the farmer that went up in the mountains but the market came in there and he found that old Eagle egg he took it down he said I think I'll just take this and put it at my farm and he put it down there in the in the in the the Barnard in the chicken ceop after a little while that little that little egg hatches and here that little Eagle hops out of there with all his little Breen sister chickens and my they they they went hopping around the Barnard and you know what he did brother Mark he ate the same stuff they ate and he went around the Barnard and whatever stuff they threw out on the ground he would eat it right off the ground he didn't care because after all he was a chicken he was hashed under a chicken he walked around with chickens and you know but you know after a little while he lost the appetite for that barnyard food see he was raised up in a barnyard atmosphere you may as well preach it he was raised up in a barnyard atmosphere but after a little while the Barnyard food wasn't good enough for him and so he begin to have it his pallet begin to change he had a desire for something greater he he had a desire for meat and maybe his Mama come out there Mama chick and say you know why why won't you eat on that no more well I just don't have an appetite for it anymore well it ought to be good enough it used to be good enough for you you're getting too big lately all a sudden it ain't good enough for you you know who you think you are maybe you're trying to be too spiritual and you're you're trying to be too this because it ain't good enough for you but something on the inside of him said I got to have meat and I may not can eat on this chicken food any longer matter of fact brothers and sisters got to looking pretty good to him you know they cuz his appetite begin to change and then one day that mother Eagle comes flying over the Barnyard and she begins to cry out and when she cries out something on the inside of that eagle all of a sudden he begin to realized that that's why I've never fit in where I was born that's why I never felt like I was a part you know because something was drawing him whenever the mother Eagle begin to call and oh all the chickens you know what happens when Mama Eagle calls the chicken scatter back into the chicken they went to hide and duck back in there where nobody could see them but out on the out in the front yard here the eagle was looking to see where the scream was coming from and by the chickens was running he went after oh I could just see his mama coming out there hauling at him drumstick get back in here you're you're going to get ate out there why you about you got to come back but something on the inside of him I can't I gave him a name but something on the inside of him said I'm not a chicken something on the inside of him heard a call it was a and it be to respond to the the the the call that was being made and he stepped out and after he he heard it for a little while he jumped up on the rail got up on the top of the fence and hear that Mama Eagle was saying just let hold them wings out and let the wind soore underneath them won't you feel don't you notice look at them chicken wings they don't look like your wings but hold them out there and see what happens and oh that eagle begin to spread his wings and he flapped a few flats and before long he was soaring in the heavens but Mark you know what happened he had a changeing atmosphere he came out of the Barnyard and went flying to where he was moving from one atmosphere into another you see he was limited by the boundaries of his habitation until he heard a call that said you wasn't made for a barnyard you ain't made for a chicken pin but you're made to soar in the heavens and he heard the call no longer limited by the boundaries but God has given me something that could take me out of this atmosphere and put me into another oh my can you realize that even the day he was born he was equipped with what it would take to take him into a higher high the day he was born he was equipped with what would sore into another atmosphere but he came he had to come to a place of realizing that he would not he wasn't supposed to be down there then he that's what that was for that's why I never fit in that's why my appetite's the way it is that's what them big old ugly Wings is for that's why I have a beak like that I'm a meat eater that's why I had eye trouble all the time every time he look you know the the eyes of an egro are so much much different than a chicken that's why his eyes he was sitting there on the ground they're they're looking at all them little them little bugs and stuff they can focus right on them mom I'm having trouble I my eyes they're troubled I can't see the bugs but I can see a far off finally he just had to go back and tell her I've got eye trouble you do yeah I can't see myself being a chicken anymore I'm an eagle said see he moved into another atmosphere said that's the way it is with us attributes of God In seed form born and raised in the world but one day you get in the right atmosphere and then you come to life you realize that I I you you know that men that we live in three dimensions this is a seven there's seven dimensions but only three of them that we live in you think about man the we live in the dimensions of light and matter and time but says see see in showed how that these were the dimensions we live and this Corporal body that we live in is in contact with those three Dimension see taste feel smelling here that contact light mattering time we see it's it's things that we can see and we can affect but even though we don't see it even science today shows us that there's a dimension greater than the dimensions that we can see the ones that we can see and taste and feel you know when I was a young when I was just a young man I remember when they had the cups and they' put a string on a cup and you'd put it out there in the fort with your buddy and he'd have the other cup and you could talk to him and he could talk back and you know you could kind of understand understand it cuz it kind well the vibration of your voice it followed down the string and although that's still incomprehensible but nevertheless it follow it follows down the string and and your buddy could hear what you're saying in the cup and if he couldn't hear you he'd say turn it up and you'd just turn it up and then he could hear what you were saying out there we done done this all the time but after a little while then we you know you go in the house mama's got a a phone and you you know you if you you talk on it and if you want to talk to one of your friends privately we had about a 50ft cord extension on our phone so we could go we thought we we were living it up we can go in any room in the house with our phone you know cuz we had that long extension you know and and I didn't take it out my bedroom window I could talk out on there because it had the core but even in that you would think that maybe the sound somehow is traveling through these wires and you know even in in elementary you may not understand it but you know you could kind of get it because sounds after all it's traveling through the cord so somehow they can hear it on the other end because it's going through the court but then after a little while we got in high school and all of a sudden then they came out with wireless cell phones and now they're talking to people that lived in other states and other countries and here when You' take that phone and you would talk to somebody it's still it still fascinates me of how that you can say a word to on on this end of a phone and that word that you cannot see it leave but it goes to a satellite that's up in there outside of this atmosphere and that satellite sends it back down to a receiver that another person has and they hear it the exact same way that you said it see even science shows it that there's an unseen there's something unseen but it's traveling it's always been here but science has just came over the last few years in contact that we could contact with this other dimension so but says see that's the fourth dimension now now we we know that we don't understand the mechanics of it but science proved to us that there was a dimension outside of what we could see we use it every day it's even far greater today to think that you could take images I you would never dream that you could take an image and send a picture and it would bounce off a satellite and the picture would land in somebody else's purse I mean you it's hard to understand brother Mark but science has tapped into another dimension and so here this is traveling they figured out how to send and how to receive through that it's going through this room right now do you realize it you can't see it but it's I know you've heard this illustration many times but it's going through this room right now so we live in a dimensional world even even on further in The Fifth Dimension it was the place where I may I may as well may as well tell them all while we're here but but The Fifth Dimension it was the place where a sinner that's not that never uh that or an unbeliever goes after he dies and and and and he would go to this place that he was he was an unconverted man he would go to this place in The Fifth Dimension and brother man would say it was a place that were where where they couldn't come back to the Earth because their their time was spent upon the Earth but they couldn't go into the presence of God because they would have to go through judgment first so here because they were unconverted they go into this place of The Fifth Dimension he said honestly it's like a nightmare it's like when you when you can't be asleep and you're not awake and you're constantly and you're in a great Nightmare and it's a terrible way but that's where they spend the time until the time of Resurrection they spend their life in a nightmare and unconverted man but then a Christian when a Christian dies he goes into the sixth Dimension which is which is a place that is right under the altar of God under the presence of God and and and and that's where he lays at rest until the time until the until the time of of his coming and so matter of fact brother R would say when he had the when he went beyond the curtain of time he said I believe that's where I was in the sixth Dimension and I I was looking back at my own body and then of course the seventh Dimension is the place where God is so you see here we are a dimensional people and there we're living in Dimensions but we can't always see the dimensions that's going on around us we can't see the radio waves we can't even see the fourth dimension our little frail human bodies can't see past the first three but what's being affected by our own senses or our natural senses but here the prophet of God would come and preach a super sense and preach about faith being another sense and here that God has given us a sense to contact another world or contact another realm just like we have radio waves that can contact in the fourth dimension here God has given us a way called Faith to be able to contact that other dimension where God is that's that's how he deals with us and let me let me tell you what it is it's an unseen that's calling us into another atmosphere and I've got news for you tonight it ain't up in the cloud somewhere it ain't in outer space it's just the influence of another dimension right here where we stand that's why oh let me tell you what it is I I I I remember my my my young son one day when I was I was actually uh in a shopping mall whenever whenever the lord gave me this Revelation out of the mouth of a 5-year-old child here I was sitting in the in in the mall we was we was gone preaching and we were walking in the mall spending time between the the the services or whatever and and here uh Salem goes up and there's there's a place in the mall that sew doors and so they had the doors just sitting there on display and so he was going opening the door walking through shutting the door opening the door walking through shutting the door I'm just sitting on the bench talking on the phone and watched them go in and out you know through this door back and forth playing with it he said dad you got to come you got to come and try this so I went over there said okay buddy let's do it let's go through I said what are we doing he said you got to go through and so he opens the door I said but what is it he said it's a dimension Ator I said well what's that he said well when you walk through you're going to be in another dimension and I thought my out of the mouth of a child something that seems so far-fetched that here he would say just step through and you're in another dimension I thought Lord isn't that the way it is that even while you're sitting in your seat and all the things that are going on around you it ain't some place that you have to go out somewhere to be able to find God maybe you're sitting at home and going through something or in the car riding but all it is is a step into out of one dimension into another said see he's calling us into another atmosphere this is the call of God but remember said that's what he he what he wants is to get us into that right atmosphere he said see he knew who we were in the beginning some million years years ago that God knew who you were whenever he he he he said in the beginning that you're going to be my servant and here you was born in sin and you was shaped in iniquity and here because you were Immortal and maybe something happened you got a little religious feeling and you went down toh to a church somewhere but but then all of a sudden you get under the atmosphere of God one time and you're bound to recognize who your father is he said just like that eagle recognized who his mother was you got to realize it because he's your father see he's God's attribute that's become a word speaking of you you're God's attribute that's become a word spoken and then the Holy Spirit seeks that word out so God spoke a word you are you the attribute of God he spoke it which was you you came into existence and here then God comes by the power of the Holy Ghost when you're born into this world the holy spirit's brooding over the Earth he's finding that attribute of God that is born into this world shaped in sin and all and speaking lies and all these things that said about a a newborn birth but here when the Holy Spirit comes he begin to draw him and he's calling him or her to give them everlasting life he said and he brings them into the presence of God and God's word so what are they doing they're growing in the atmosphere of God and brother Mark what happens is our expectations begin to change because we're in another atmosphere he said that's what we need today is we need a holy ghost atmosphere an atmosphere where the power of God is moving in one Accord in one place gathered together under an atmosphere expecting God to move down and do signs and wonders let's move oursel out up into that bracket step up and faith and move out of these three dimensions up into the next ones it's a call of God to his children to live in a higher Place Another atmosphere we've been called into an atmosphere where the seed of God can be manifested you say a seed well certainly you realize every living thing it started in seed form here in the in the Book of Genesis says see 6,000 years he had planted all these wonderful seeds and everything was perfect it was good he commanded each one of those seeds that they would transform themselves into the plant of which kind of a life that the word of God had spoken in them should be so if it was an oak tree it would bring forth an oak if it was a palm tree it would bring forth a palm do you realize it's no different from for God to gr an oak tree it is to create a man it ain't no harder for God to create a a plan or to create a man it's biology here he said see so if it's an oak tree he brought forth an oak a palm brought forth a palm because the great Creator had just sent forth his word word and the word seed was there before the real seed was ever formed and then the word formed the seed and he made the world out of things which does not appear he made the world by his word he spoke everything into existence see that's why there's power in Prophecy that's why there's power in the word of God that's why there's power in the preaching of the word because the word forms seeds hello the word forms seeds it takes the word to form it it takes the word word to Quicken it it takes the word to water it it takes the word to bring it to life it takes the word for it to manifest itself it takes the word to resurrect it in the end it's the word of God that's in control all the time that's why this this this new believer or True Believer he's never satisfied with his old life he's never he's never satisfied with it because there's always something that is drawing him to a higher Place how many testify about that why you never satisfied in the world brother Jared tell us why you were never satisfied in in in the old life that you come out of why why was your family Never Satisfied in that place because there was something calling you you know I used to wonder that I used to look around and say well these other people they live out in the world and they seem to be happy as they can be they got millions of dollars they got helicopters I wish I had a helicopter they they have all these nice things how you they they seem to be happy but I was never satisfied no matter what I had you know why because something in you won't allow you to be satisfied with the world you can't you can't quench it with money you could give yourself a billion dollars you'd want a billion more you'd never end and you'd never be satisfied with it if you're not satisfied with this world you'll never be satisfied this this world no matter how much of the world you can get it'll never satisfy you it C it takes something else so see it's a it's a higher calling something drawing us to a higher place and see most of the time when people think of that well if I'm being draw to a higher Place well then you know why is it so hard but just because there there's a call in your life for a with draw doesn't mean that there's not a hindrance matter of fact it's the exact opposite see to pull means to exert a force on something to bring it unto oneself that's what pull means so a draw it's to bring it to oneself in other words you couldn't have a pull if there wasn't a resistance you couldn't have a draw if there wasn't a resistance there would be there would be no there would be no it wouldn't be a pull it would just it would just move that way but because there is a resistance that's the need of a pull see so but whenever God's pulling on you and there's resistance and here he's tugging at your heart and there's a hindrance I may as well preach there but but there's a hindrance there's things that are getting in your way all it just seems like all the way down the road you know God's pulling on you you're and every time he's pulling on you you keep bumping into one thing or another why because there's a pull on your life and and just because there's a pull don't mean there's hindrances there there's many hindrances there's always a hindrance that's why God has to pull us you remember with the sanan woman when she went to meet Jesus here she had a daughter that was dying of epilepsy and all these fists brother Mark when she went to find Jesus every time she turned there was another hindrance here was somebody you know you're a Greek woman you're going to meet a Jewish man why you can't have no part to do with the Jews but you know what she didn't let the hindrance stop her she kept on walking another another step maybe she went around the corner they said when you get to meet him he's not going to be able to heal your child anyway but you know what she did she went right around the hindrance and took another step you know after all the days of Miracles has passed and how can you receive healing all that's over you know what she did she stepped right around it and she took another step it didn't matter what hindrance came came her way there was a pull that was bringing her to Jesus Christ but said it was a pull in her that was causing her to come to him it didn't she didn't place it there it was something in her faith that caused her to believe Beyond her own ability it was something in the Unseen that looked beyond the scene thing that said if I could ever get to Jesus then my daughter would receive her healing he said she went past every crit oh friends don't you realize we got critics today your family they might forsake you they may tell you you're going to be an outcast if you live that kind of life but let me tell you what if you get all the way to him and it don't even work anyway what if you put forth all your effort and down the road you can't even serve God what if you fall right back on your face again it's somebody trying to hinder you from getting to the place that God wants you to be but he said it didn't matter cuz something was pulling her to Jesus I say it don't matter what hindrance stands in our way there's something that's drawn us oh don't don't matter I say let the hindrance come there's no hindrance that'll ever prevail against the Son of God that's being drawn to his maker there's a pull in our life that is pulling us to God he said she she had many hindrances he said but her faith didn't have any Glory she had many hindrances but her faith didn't have any cuz Faith knows no hindrance you may have hindrances but if you got faith then it knows no defeat there's no hindrance that can stand in the way of Faith he said oh people if you could get a hold of that in your heart and that God is here to give you the desire of your heart and he'll meet and you will meet his conditions that nothing can stand in your way you said what condition he wants a sacrifice that is acceptable to God isn't that the condition that he made in the beginning you remember Cain and Abel they made sacrifices to be acceptable to God they wanted a meeting place with God Cain made one Abel made one God accepted Abel's and he rejected Cain's you realize that here what God shows us is that for a sacrifice has to meet a requirement in order for God to accept it right so here from the very beginning you realize that not they weren't all accepted by God when God came down in the garden here after the fall that took place in the garden that God went down and in this in the the condition that that man was in that here that God went down and he took a lamb and he slew the Lamb on their behalf and God actually set something in place that that to show that here was a meeting place with God and it was carried on through through Adam and Eve and it was taught to their children and and because of the Revelation that Abel had it caused him to go and sacrifice a lamb rather than sacrifice that that Cain made remember he went out made a beautiful Altar and and he prepared it in just such a way and I know that that's good enough for God to accept after all it's it's the work of my hands you know I I I I sure I raised all those crops myself and I made the best plants I could and he put it all out there on the altar so that God would accept it but you know what brother Mark it wasn't good enough for God but Abel he took a lamb and he tied an old rope around his neck like a grap Vine and he drug it down to an altar and that poor little lamb crying and bleeding out if one of us was looking at it from the outside you would wonder well you know that that why wouldn't God accept this one after all that was what an ugly sacrifice that it was but he drug it out there and took it and laid it upon an altar and took an old Flint Rock and he beat at its neck until the blood was peeling out everywhere and when God looked down upon Abel's sacrifice it was pleasing unto God and God accepted his sacrifice because that was the standard that God had said but said see that's what God done he provided a meeting place with man he said there's only one place that God will ever fellowship with man and that's under the blood of the sacrifice he will never meet with a man nowhere else but but under the blood and when you turn the blood down your meeting place with God has been taken away I love this cuz God has to have an acceptable sacrifice he said but notice where you'll find it he made his decision in the Garden of Eden man would only worship him under the shed blood of the sacrifice and that's the only place that God ever met with man then and it's the only place he meets with man today is under the shed blood of the sacrifice it don't matter what you are it don't matter where you come from if you come from a Methodist or Baptist or or Pentecost or Presbyterian he said you can forget all your differences or whatever it might be but if you will come under the shed blood God will meet both of us there that's where we can all meet in Fellowship on the same grounds it's under the shed blood of Jesus Christ under the shed the bleeding word of God this is the place or the dwelling place or meeting place of God he said he won't meet you because you're a Methodist he won't meet you because you're a Pentecostal he won't can I just say it like this he won't meet you because you go to Grace Tabernacle he won't meet you because you pay more en TI than the next guy he won't meet you cuz you cuz you because you're the you're the best ker you're there the most that's not the grounds that God is meeting us on although we're rewarded for all that we do but that ain't the meeting place with God he said the meeting place he'll meet with you is under one condition and that's under the shed blood when your sins have been confessed and expelled in his presence by the blood and the blood is always before him and therefore he can only see you through that shed blood that's the only way your sacrifice has ever accepted Yours Mine and everybody else's isn't that wonderful to think the same blood that he looks at me through is the same blood he looks at you through it don't matter what your sin or what's your past or failures people get so focused on the wrong thing he's looking at us through the exact same blood that was shed on the cross of makes me want to shout all over this building the good and the bad and the Ugly he sees it all the same he sees red through the blood so that's the only way it'll be accepted see in order for a sacrifice to be accepted has to be the right sacrifice I preached a message on this right people right place right sacrifice remember in the Old Testament that that that it had to be at an altar it had to be at the right Temple where a sacrifice was made it couldn't just be out there on any grounds but they had to have a temple where the priest could go into the temple and make a sacrifice unto God a priest or or one that that was commanded to do it a prophet would be commanded you remember even even Saul he actually lost his kingdom because he went out of the will of God and made a sacrifice on his own remember whenever God came to Samuel he said I'm going to come and I'll tell you what to do so wait seven days and then you're going to make a peace offering unto me and so when he came to uh uh Saul had hurt he got anxious and got tired of waiting so Saul went out and made the sacrifice anyway waiting on the word of the Lord so when Samuel came he gave him the word of the Lord he said you would have ra your your family would have raised and been over this nation for out all the time but because you've disobeyed the word of the Lord now I'm going to raise up somebody else that's according to my own heart he lost his kingdom because he went made a sacrifice that wasn't acceptable to God it was offered but it wasn't accepted see so it takes the right person to make a sacrifice the right people it had to be a priest it had to had to be the one that was set in that place it had to be in the right place he had to go down to the Templar to the altar to make the sacrifice and so here we see that that that that they had it had to be something that was accepted by God but notice what John says in the book of Revelation he said Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood he has made us Kings and Priests unto God and glory and Dominion forever and ever in other words he made you a king to have dominion and a priest to make a sacrifice you know what a king has dominion over over the Natural Things a priest has dominion over the spiritual things so Peter said or John said so God has made us Kings and Priests that means you have dominion over the natural and you have dominion over the spiritual you have dominion over the flesh so it it ain't we don't have to bow down to nobody he made you a king and a priest that you could be the ruler over this own Temple that God has created in you you're the king and the priest you you put out what don't belong there you allow in what you want to allow in you're the ruler of your own kingdom you're the king over your own Temple say so you allow in there what you want says these made us Dominion you know what that means that nothing can hinder you brother Mark from entering this Temple of Praise nothing can hinder you there's no hindrance that's great enough that can keep you from his presence he said know you not that you are a temple of God wherever you are can I add that in wherever you are you are a temple of God no matter where you go you are a temple of God Paul asked this question do you not know who you are do you know that you're a temple and in this temple of God that you have a right to make a sacrifice you remember where the altar is that's why the Bible would say the altar was on the on the heart in the heart of a man that was the Throne of God here here in this temple of God here lays a heart brother marah that is an altar of God what a that that you can make a sacrifice upon God's altar in God's Temple that's why you can kneel down wherever you are and you begin to speak to God it ain't some some magic place that you have to go to but in that temple of God in the altar of a man's heart it's the place where God dwells oh my is it wonderful God is building a building he's building a place of praise and thanksgiving he's building a praise that you can come and meet God under the blood of the sacrifice it was the sacrifice on the cross of Calvary when Jesus said forgive them for they know not what they do he was sanctifying the altar that is in your heart by the blood of Jesus Christ that you might make a sacrifice unto God on a Sanctified altar amen the only place that God would ever accept a sacrif it was in a Sanctified place oh my God's Building a building you say where's he building in every one of you this is God's Building this is what he's looking at it's his building it's his temples that is around the world Peter said you are Lively stones and you're built up a spiritual house you're a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ amen you're a temple of God giving praise unto God upon the altar of God in the presence of of God a Sanctified altar in the heart of every believer a Temple of Praise he said we're expecting God to do something for us he said he can't do nothing for us if we're all drooping around like something half dead he said but God wants a lively Church hello somebody go ahead God wants a lively church he wants the members in there to be Lively Stones built up in the house of Faith believe him and accept him and taking him at his word not just noise not just noise he ain't just wanting a a loud church a bunch of Pentecostalism but you remember what he told Aaron go sanctify the altar he wants a lively church that has a sacrifice that's made on a Sanctified altar so when a man that is Sanctified in the presence of God I I may as well just give it to you I'm closing sister you want to come I may as well may as well tell you a man that's Sanctified in his heart has a right to worship God when your heart is Sanctified before God you you repented of your sins and you and you you came and down to an altar you knelt down you gave that to God and here God has Sanctified your heart you poured everything out to God you got a right to scream as loud as you want to scream you can shout as loud as you want to shout you can run as fast as you can run you can dance all over this building you can run up and down those pews if you want to because the altar has been Sanctified before God and it's an acceptable sacrifice to him you're a Temple of Praise Paul said I beseech you Brethren present your body as a living s sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God it's your reasonable surface be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is good and acceptable in the perfect will of God be not conformed you know what that means to conform means to Fashion after a former thing he said be not conformed to this former be not conformed to the world it's the former these old Dimensions that we used to droop around him he said don't conform to that you know where that word came from in the scripture in that in that Greek Roman World conformity in society was was a major influence in order to be anything in society you had to conform in society that's what that's what made you fit in the prestige and all this it was very highly valued so the concept of conforming to the image or pattering after something it was something that was well understood in this culture because everybody in the society patterned after something they were pattering after this one or pattern after this group or whatever part of soed that they came from so in the New Testament here when Paul would come out to speak this this word conform was something that they were very accustomed to but he uses this to contrast this temporary and external nature of worldly Conformity so he's contrasted saying don't conform to this world he's showing you that there's something else that you can follow after but instead of conforming to the external nature of this world but but but transform to this internal work that God is doing in your life see here he's looking on the outside what you can see he said don't conform to what you can see but be transformed to what you can't see the transformative power of an internal work of God in a believer's life this is what Paul was preaching be transformed no longer are we confined by the limitations of an outside world I know what the world does if you want to stand your feet the world looks at Christians and say you got to get outside of the boundaries of Christianity because you're bound but a real believer looks at the world and says you need to get outside of the boundaries of the world because you're bound isn't it something to come out of the boundaries of Christianity you'd be right back in the three dimensions you came out of never be able to partake of another world the Unseen but here real Christianity brother Mark it's calling us outside of what the world can even see something far beyond our understanding it's an unseen calling to the scene I know Satan he's a perverter he says going to church is going to hold you back you can't be nothing you can't you can't you
