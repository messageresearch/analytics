[29:56] to our hearts in Jesus holy name of
[29:59] praises
[30:02] As we get ready to invite our brother
[30:04] Joe out here to minister to us, the
[30:07] blood will never lose its power. The
[30:08] blood will never lose its power.
[30:12] And the blood
[30:15] that Jesus
[30:18] shed
[30:20] for me
[30:23] way back
[30:25] on Cal
[30:28] for real.
[30:32] Oh, it's the blood that gives me
[30:35] strength
[30:37] from day
[30:40] to day.
[30:42] It will never
[30:45] lose
[30:47] its power.
[30:50] Oh, for it reaches
[30:54] to the highest
[30:57] mountain.
[31:00] Oh, and it flows
[31:03] to the lowest
[31:06] valley.
[31:10] Oh, it's the blood that gives me
[31:13] strength
[31:15] from day
[31:18] to day.
[31:20] It will never
[31:23] lose
[31:25] its power.
[31:29] Oh, for it soothes
[31:32] my doubts
[31:34] and it calms
[31:37] my fears
[31:39] and it dries
[31:42] all
[31:44] my tears.
[31:48] For it's the blood that gives me
[31:52] strength
[31:54] from day
[31:56] to day.
[31:59] It will never
[32:02] lose
[32:04] its power.
[32:06] I'll sing it tonight. Oh, for it reaches
[32:10] to the highest
[32:14] mountain.
[32:15] [Music]
[32:17] Oh, and it flows
[32:20] to the lowest
[32:23] valley.
[32:27] For it's the blood that gives me
[32:30] strength
[32:32] from day
[32:35] to day.
[32:37] It will never
[32:40] lose
[32:42] it power. I'll sing it again tonight.
[32:45] Oh, and it reaches
[32:48] [Music]
[33:00] Oh, low is valley
[33:02] [Music]
[33:07] that gives me strength
[33:10] from day
[33:12] to day.
[33:15] Oh, it will never
[33:17] lose
[33:19] it power.
[33:22] [Music]
[33:24] It soothes
[33:26] my doubts
[33:29] and calms all my fears.
[33:34] And it dries
[33:37] all of my tears.
[33:43] Oh, the blood.
[33:46] Oh, that gives me strength
[33:49] from day.
[33:51] Oh, today
[33:53] it will never
[33:56] lose
[33:58] its power.
[34:00] [Music]
[34:03] For it reaches
[34:05] to the high. Oh, highest mountain.
[34:10] Oh, do you believe it, saints? And it
[34:13] flows
[34:15] to the Lord will always.
[34:22] Oh, it's the blood that gives me
[34:25] strength
[34:27] from day
[34:29] to day.
[34:32] It will never
[34:35] lose
[34:37] its power.
[34:42] Hallelujah. Do you believe that this
[34:44] evening?
[34:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's good to be in the
[34:47] house of the Lord once again. And it's
[34:50] been a rainy day outside and but
[34:53] certainly good to be in the house of the
[34:54] Lord with licks of fire. And amen. God's
[35:00] manifesting himself among us once again.
[35:03] Hope we never take it for granted. God's
[35:05] a good God. Amen. I just been looking
[35:08] forward to the service today and I hope
[35:11] you have done the same. And man, I tell
[35:13] you, God's never failed us one time.
[35:17] He's never yet not to meet our
[35:19] expectation.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you expect me to do something
[35:24] special for you, I'm going to fail you.
[35:26] But God has never failed his children
[35:30] one time. He'll meet your expectation.
[35:33] That's what kind of God we serve
[35:34] tonight. Amen. If you could bow your
[35:36] heads one more time tonight and just
[35:39] before we go to his precious word, if
[35:41] you got a need upon your heart, just
[35:43] make it known to the Lord, just remember
[35:45] my sister in prayer once again. And also
[35:48] the family, Xavier and Sister Jordan,
[35:51] and the family there, brother Matt,
[35:52] pastor, and the family all there. And
[35:55] it's just looking for a new life coming
[35:58] too. It's just nothing like it. So, just
[36:00] pray for them and let the Lord be a hand
[36:02] upon that. and and bless him in a sweet
[36:06] way this evening. Just pray in your own
[36:08] way. Lord Jesus, we thank you, Lord, for
[36:11] an opportunity to come and worship you
[36:13] once again, Father. Lord, that we're
[36:16] such a needful people, Lord. We stand in
[36:18] a need of prayer tonight, Lord. Lord, we
[36:21] realize tonight without you, we're
[36:23] nothing, Lord God. We we we fall short.
[36:27] We make mistakes, Lord. But not one time
[36:29] have you ever failed us, Lord. Lord, in
[36:32] our humanity, Lord, it may feel like
[36:34] you're you're late sometimes, but you're
[36:37] always on time. Lord, we serve a
[36:39] powerful God tonight. Lord God, you're
[36:42] you're our healer. You're our savior.
[36:44] You're there's still some bomb in Gilead
[36:47] for whoever has need of it tonight.
[36:49] Lord, we pray, Lord God, that you'll go
[36:51] by the hospital this evening to my
[36:54] sister, Lord, laying in the intensive
[36:56] care unit, Lord. I pray, Lord God, that
[36:58] you'll minister healing to her body,
[37:01] Lord. Lord, I pray Lord God for brother
[37:04] Xavier and Sister Jordan, Lord, that
[37:06] you'll go by their bedside too tonight,
[37:08] Lord. Lord, and give them exactly have
[37:10] what they have need of the strength in
[37:12] their body, a a healthy baby to deliver,
[37:15] Lord. We place it those needs into your
[37:18] hands tonight, Lord, for now, for the
[37:20] remainder of this service, Lord, that
[37:22] you'll come in a special way. Anoint us
[37:24] aresh, Lord, as we dig into your word
[37:26] one more time, Lord. Come and use our
[37:29] our lips, Lord God. and anoint us aresh
[37:32] Lord knowing the ears to hear. Let our
[37:34] hearts burn within one more time for
[37:36] your glory and honor in Jesus Christ's
[37:39] wonderful name. Amen. Can you say amen?
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. If you got your
[37:45] Bibles tonight, we would invite you to
[37:48] Ephesians chapter 2.
[37:59] Chapter 11, verse 14.
[38:04] Do you love the Lord? Amen. God's good
[38:08] to us, isn't he? We like to take a
[38:11] thought tonight the power of this
[38:12] everlasting covenant. Ephesians chapter
[38:15] 2 verse 11 says, "Wherefore remember
[38:19] that you being in time past Gentiles in
[38:22] the flesh who are called uncircumciition
[38:26] by that which is called the circumcision
[38:28] in the flesh made by hands. that all
[38:32] that time you were without Christ, being
[38:34] aliens from the commonwealth of Israel,
[38:38] and strangers from the covenants of
[38:40] promise, having no hope, and without God
[38:44] in the world. But now in Christ Jesus,
[38:49] you who sometimes were a far off are
[38:52] made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he
[38:56] is our peace and who hath made us both
[39:00] one
[39:01] and hath broken down the middle wall of
[39:04] petition between us. Can you say praise
[39:08] the Lord? Hebrews chapter 13 verse 20.
[39:14] Now the God of peace that brought again
[39:17] from the dead of our Lord Jesus, the
[39:20] great shepherd of this sheep through the
[39:23] blood of the everlasting covenant, make
[39:26] you perfect in every good work to do his
[39:29] will, working in you that which is well
[39:33] pleasing in his sight through Jesus
[39:35] Christ, to whom be the glory forever and
[39:39] ever. Amen. Well, God bless you tonight
[39:43] and you can have your seats and
[39:51] we like to take for a moment tonight and
[39:55] some of these things that's been laying
[39:56] on our hearts for a couple weeks and
[39:58] actually two or three weeks now. And and
[40:01] uh God knows all things. He knows
[40:04] exactly who who's preaching. He knows
[40:06] exactly who would be here. He knows
[40:08] exactly what's going on. We serve a very
[40:11] mindful God. He's a pre-planned God. He
[40:14] has it all pre-planned out before the
[40:16] foundation of the world. That's the
[40:18] beauty of our God. Nothing catches our
[40:20] God by uh by catches him off guard. We
[40:24] You might catch us off guard. We might
[40:26] be caugh uh caught off guard sometimes,
[40:29] but God never gets caught off guard at
[40:32] any time of our journey. Nothing happens
[40:35] to us by a coincidence. Remember Romans
[40:39] 8 tells us all things work for the good
[40:42] of them that love their God and called
[40:44] according to his purpose. Amen. So we
[40:47] would like to take for a moment tonight
[40:49] and preach on the power of this
[40:51] everlasting covenant as we glean through
[40:54] Ephesians chapter 2 for a moment. And we
[40:56] REALIZE THAT EVEN GOD MAKES A covenant
[40:59] with man, God never breaks it.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We realize that when man makes a
[41:05] covenant with God, Brother Brown says he
[41:07] always seems to break his covenant.
[41:10] Amen. It's just the way it is. But when
[41:11] he told Abraham there in Genesis, "Thy
[41:15] seed shall possess the gates of his
[41:18] enemy." It was an unconditional
[41:20] covenant. It was a sign of victory for
[41:23] many to come. Amen. That brother would
[41:26] say, "Thess
[41:28] gates of his enemy." And he would say it
[41:30] like this, brother Noah, in you all
[41:32] things. Amen. You have the power to
[41:35] overcome temptation. You have the power.
[41:38] Amen. Everything lays within a believer.
[41:40] If you are sealed with the baptism of
[41:42] the Holy Ghost, even the rapture is
[41:45] already within you. It's just needing to
[41:47] be exercised or released. So we realize,
[41:51] amen, we're not waiting on a great power
[41:53] to come.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not waiting on another
[41:56] messenger to come.
[41:58] just waiting, amen, for us to take that
[42:01] last step of faith and and change from
[42:04] this dimension to that dimension. But
[42:06] every time man made a covenant with God,
[42:09] he breaks it. But we serve a determined
[42:12] God. Amen. That God that was going to
[42:14] make a covenant that would never be
[42:16] broken. Not if you will or you have. No,
[42:21] he's an unconditional covenant that he
[42:24] makes between God and his his prodigy.
[42:28] So, brother would say it like this. When
[42:31] he swore by no greater, he swore by
[42:34] himself. And it WAS GOD BY GOD'S
[42:37] FORNOWLEDGE. God made a covenant with
[42:40] himself.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; And he tried to hook a covenant with
[42:44] Adam and he said Adam broke it. He said
[42:46] he broke it. He hooked it on the
[42:48] covenant and he broke it. Amen. BUT HE
[42:51] SAID, "BUT GOD MADE THIS COVENANT
[42:54] UNCONDITIONALLY and he hooked it in
[42:56] Christ Jesus." HE SAID, "THERE it
[42:59] anchored. There's no slipping. There's
[43:02] no sliding.
[43:04] There's no way of getting away. What is
[43:06] it? It's hooked by God above and by the
[43:09] Son of God beneath." And he said, "What
[43:11] it is, it's the pathway. It's a
[43:14] traveler's way from earth to glory." In
[43:18] other words, he's making a way that a
[43:20] believer can overcome no matter what
[43:24] phase of the journey that he may be in.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[43:31] &gt;&gt; So he says he hooked it around his son.
[43:36] He hooked it around the heart of God
[43:37] above and the son of God on earth and it
[43:41] will travel his way from earth to glory.
[43:43] I like it like this. He says, "You can't
[43:46] fail." Amen. Look, there's great
[43:49] companies of angels up and down,
[43:51] extending and descending, picking up the
[43:54] weary and picking up the sick and
[43:57] HEALING THEIR BODIES AND SHOWING VISIONS
[44:00] AND MIGHTY SIGNS AND WONDERS. AMEN. IT
[44:03] CAN'T FAIL. IT CAN'T SLIP. It can't
[44:06] slide. He said, "YOU ARE SAFE." GOD SAID
[44:10] SO, and that settles it forever. IT'S
[44:13] HOOKED AROUND THE HEART OF GOD OF HEAVEN
[44:17] and he's hooked it on the son of God
[44:19] down here. AND HE SAID WE ARE BROUGHT
[44:22] INTO IT THROUGH THE SON OF GOD. HE SAID
[44:26] AND we can you say with me tonight we
[44:29] ascend to him. Amen.
[44:33] We ascend to him. That should make you
[44:36] excited tonight. Amen. If you're hooked
[44:39] in between here and here, you can't
[44:42] fail. You can't die no more than GOD CAN
[44:45] DIE. YOU CAN'T BE DESTROYED. YOU CAN'T
[44:48] BE DEFEATED. I TELL YOU TONIGHT, HIS
[44:50] GRACE is amazing. Amen. Yet we realize,
[44:54] Amen. because of what happened in the
[44:56] Garden of Eden. Amen. They look back
[44:59] there in THE OLD COVENANT FROM from the
[45:01] since the fall there in the garden of
[45:03] Eden. Amen. When man sin, HE SEPARATED
[45:07] HIMSELF FROM GOD AND HE CROSSED the
[45:10] great chasm.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; And he put himself into death on this
[45:16] side. And from that moment, brother Joe,
[45:19] there was a distance.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. THERE WAS A SEPARATION.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A CHASM that was put between
[45:27] man and God.
[45:29] MY BUT GOD'S TAKEN for this very moment
[45:36] WHEN THAT FALL OF ADAM and Eve THAT GOD
[45:40] WENT into action
[45:42] and he for the first time, BROTHER TIM,
[45:45] HE WENT AND slew an innocent lamb and he
[45:48] took the bloody lamb skkins AND HE
[45:52] TOSSED THEM TO HIS HIS SON AND HIS
[45:54] DAUGHTER AND THEY WRAPPED THEMSELVES
[45:57] BECAUSE FROM THAT POINT. A BUT GOD HAD
[46:00] TO HONOR HIS WORD. AND THE DAY THAT YOU
[46:03] EAT OF THAT, THE DAY THAT YOU SHALL DIE
[46:06] AND FROM THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A
[46:08] SEPARATION. THERE CAME A DISTANCE
[46:11] BETWEEN MAN AND GOD. A BUT THERE WAS GOD
[46:16] LOOKING OUT. THERE WAS A GOD WATCHING
[46:19] ADAM AND EVE WALK OUT OF HIS PRESENCE
[46:21] WITH THE INNOCENT LAMB BLOOD SLAPPING
[46:24] AGAINST THEIR LEGS. WALKING OUT OF HIS
[46:27] PRESENCE. AMEN. AND SOMETHING BEGIN TO
[46:30] STIR IN GOD.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; OH, if you've EVER LISTENED TO BROTHER
[46:34] BRANDON DRAMATIZE IT OUT. AMEN.
[46:36] SOMETHING BEGIN TO HAPPEN THAT GOD
[46:39] COULDN'T HARDLY STAND IT ANY LONGER. HE
[46:42] SAID, "I." AND HE SCREAMED OUT, "I AS A
[46:45] PERSONAL PRONOUN. THERE'S NOT GOING TO
[46:47] BE ANYBODY GOING TO TAKE MY PLACE." IT
[46:49] WAS A PERSONAL PRONOUN. I WILL PUT
[46:52] ENMITY BETWEEN THY SEED AND THE SERPENT
[46:55] SEED SCREAMING THERE'S A SAVIOR COMING.
[46:58] THERE'S A REDEEMER COMING.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. GOD WHO'S RICH in
[47:04] mercy. Amen. And we know that GOD TOOK A
[47:08] SACRIFICE FROM THAT MOMENT AND THE OLD
[47:10] COVENANT UNDER THE OLD LAW. AMEN. THEY
[47:13] WOULD TAKE BULLS and goats and
[47:17] sacrifice them. Amen. and they would PUT
[47:20] THEIR HANDS UPON their altar
[47:22] &gt;&gt; and the blood of bulls and goats would
[47:25] never divorce sin.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; It would only cover it
[47:30] &gt;&gt; for a space of time.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; So, it's only a temporary victory.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; It's only a temporary covering. IT'S
[47:41] ONLY IT'S A SPACE OF TIME. THE OLD
[47:43] COVENANT JUST COVERED UP OR PATCHED it
[47:46] up. HE'S STILL THE SAME DESIRE THAT HE
[47:50] WALKED IN WITH.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; HE WALKED BACK OUT WITH THE SAME DESIRE
[47:55] THERE. THE THERE WAS A GREAT CHASM
[47:57] THERE. From that point, THE MEN BEGIN TO
[48:01] FALL FROM GOD. AMEN. WE KNOW THAT WE'RE
[48:04] BORN OF a woman. Just bear with me for a
[48:07] FEW MOMENTS. WE'RE BORN OF A WOMAN A FEW
[48:09] DAYS AND FULL of trouble. Can you say
[48:11] amen? AMEN. FROM THAT MOMENT, THIS BODY
[48:15] BEGINS TO GO BACK TO THE DUST. IT
[48:17] BEGINS. THERE'S A THERE'S A PULL BACK TO
[48:20] THE DIRT WHICH WE CAME FROM. AMEN. As
[48:24] time, brother, would go through time as
[48:26] a sun comes up. Amen. Makes his way over
[48:29] about midday and back over. HE SAID,
[48:31] "THERE YOU ARE." AMEN. JUST A BABY.
[48:34] AMEN. And there you go. AS A SUN COMES
[48:36] AROUND, YOU'RE reaching your 18 to 20
[48:39] years old, your prime. Amen. As the sun
[48:42] goes over, THERE YOU ARE. AMEN. REACHING
[48:45] YOUR YOUR MIDLIFE CRISIS. AND 40 AND 50
[48:48] YEARS OLD. AMEN. Just in a few day, a
[48:50] few months, I'LL BE TURNING 50 YEARS
[48:52] OLD. AMEN. AND I AND I LOOK BACK, WHERE
[48:55] DID TIME GO? AMEN. YOU JUST take a
[48:57] blink. And you got grandkids. AND BEFORE
[49:00] YOU KNOW IT, AMEN. YOUR your shoulders
[49:02] begin to stoop. Amen. YOU START TO GO
[49:05] BACK TO THE DUST WHERE YOU COME FROM. AS
[49:07] YOU BEGIN TO AGE, it begins to pull you
[49:09] back to the to the dirt which you COME
[49:12] FROM. AMEN. BUT THAT'S THE BECAUSE OF
[49:15] THE fall in the beginning. AMEN. YOU'RE
[49:18] BORN OF A woman and you're a FEW DAYS
[49:21] AND FULL OF TROUBLE.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; But under THAT OLD COVENANT, BROTHER
[49:27] SAID THE OLD COVENANT IS WITH ONE THING.
[49:30] He said, "BUT THIS NEW EVERLASTING
[49:33] covenant
[49:35] is God bloodbound promises
[49:38] &gt;&gt; makes us free from sin and shame and
[49:42] different from the rest of the world."
[49:45] There was a law of God that under the
[49:47] blood of the lamb, they didn't take away
[49:49] the sin. And when a man sinned, HE
[49:53] CROSSED THE GREAT CHASM. WHEN HE SINNED
[49:56] AWAY, HE SEPARATED HIMSELF AWAY from
[49:59] God, LEAVING HIMSELF WITH NO WAY BACK.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; SO THE COVENANT OF SIN IS A TEMPORARY
[50:06] COVENANT WITH NO RELEASING POWER.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD IN HIS TENDER MERCY ACCEPTED THE
[50:14] substitute for him. And the substitute
[50:17] lasted for thousands of years, but it
[50:19] wouldn't take away sin.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; It only covered up sin. Remember,
[50:24] brother would say like this. If I had a
[50:27] red dot in my hand and I touched
[50:29] something and I covered it up,
[50:36] &gt;&gt; it's still there.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; That's what the the the blood of bulls
[50:43] and goats, shadows and types of one
[50:46] coming. the very thing that God were
[50:49] visualizing there in the Garden of Eden
[50:51] when he seen him walking out. Amen. He
[50:54] would say, "I would put empathy." He was
[50:57] saying, "I'm going to come. I'm going to
[50:59] be a kinsman and redeemer. I'm going to
[51:01] shed my blood." Amen. IT WAS A BUT BUT
[51:04] UNTIL THEN, AMEN. IT WAS A TEMPORARY
[51:07] COVERING. IT WAS A TEMPORARY FIX. IT WAS
[51:10] A PATCHED UP
[51:13] &gt;&gt; COVERED UP.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO REDEMPTION POWER.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; IT WAS ONLY A TEMPORARY VICTORY.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:27] But it wouldn't take away sin. It only
[51:29] covered it up.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; But brother, I would say, BUT NOT BUT
[51:35] THIS BLOOD.
[51:38] RIGHT.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; But when God kind of send it down,
[51:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take my time for a moment.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN GOD CONSIDED SEND IT DOWN
[51:48] FROM the heavens. Remember this is
[51:50] wasn't going to be a work. He had it was
[51:52] A SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD. HE WASN'T GOING TO
[51:55] PUT THIS IN NOBODY ELSE'S HANDS. AMEN.
[51:58] When he said, "I would PUT ENMITY." HE
[52:00] MEANT JUST WHAT HE SAID. I WILL BECOME
[52:03] MAN. AMEN. I KNOW THAT THIS POINT THERE
[52:06] IS A CHASM. A MAN CANNOT REACH HEAVEN.
[52:10] BUT WITH BUT THE GOD WHO'S RICH IN
[52:12] MERCY, I WILL PUT EMPATHY BETWEEN THY
[52:14] SEED AND THE SERPENT SEED. HE WAS
[52:16] SCREAMING OUT THESE VERY WORDS. I'M
[52:19] GOING TO MAKE A WAY. I KNOW MAN CAN'T
[52:22] REACH HEAVEN, BUT HEAVEN WILL COME DOWN.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; HEAVEN CAME AND EMBRACED EARTH.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; NOT MANUFACTURED.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; NOT THE HELP OF MARY. NOT THE HELP OF
[52:35] JOSEPH. THIS WAS A SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD.
[52:38] IT WAS NOT MANUFACTURED.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; My brother SAID IT WASN'T MANUFACTURED.
[52:42] IT WAS THE CREATIVE.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. IT WAS THE CREATED BLOOD
[52:50] OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Brother B said, "But God not
[52:55] manufactured. It was his creative power
[52:59] created a blood cell without sexual
[53:02] desire. in the womb of a virgin that
[53:06] don't only cover sin.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It don't ONLY COVER SIN, IT
[53:12] EMITS SIN.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; IT TAKES IT SO FAR OUT OF THE WAY TO
[53:16] NEVER IN THE MIND OF GOD AGAIN. It don't
[53:20] make a bridge.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; But now
[53:26] CHRIST JESUS, HE SAID IT doesn't make a
[53:29] bridge. He moves the chasm.
[53:33] BUT NOW CHRIST JESUS,
[53:36] YE WHO SOMETIMES WERE FAR OFF,
[53:40] &gt;&gt; IS MADE NIGH BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[53:43] CHRIST. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU WAS AT A
[53:46] DISTANCE.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; YOU CAME TO THIS WORLD a certain way.
[53:50] AMEN. UNDER THE OLD COVENANT. AMEN.
[53:53] LISTEN, CHURCH. AMEN. We was all born
[53:57] &gt;&gt; in a fallen condition.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. Look to your neighbor. Are we
[54:01] all the same tonight?
[54:04] Hey, but Tom, if it wasn't for his
[54:07] grace, if it wasn't for his mercy, Amen.
[54:10] we would be just LIKE THE THE GAMBLER
[54:12] DOWN THE ROAD OR THE HARLOT DOWN THE
[54:14] STREET.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. But he made nigh HE BROUGHT
[54:21] US BACK. BUT THE two is able to become
[54:25] one again. AEN THAT HE DID NOT MOVE OR
[54:30] BRIDGE the chasm. He didn't LEAVE THE
[54:32] DISTANCE THERE ANY LONGER. AMEN. THROUGH
[54:35] THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, NOT
[54:38] MANUFACTURED, BUT THE BLOOD OF THE
[54:40] CREATIVE POWER OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AMEN. HE
[54:44] DID NOT BRIDGE A WAY BACK. HE REMOVED
[54:47] THE CHASM THAT THE THAT WE COULD BE SONS
[54:51] AND DAUGHTERS AGAIN.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[54:55] Praise God for it. Amen. The maiden high
[54:59] by the blood of Christ. For it is our
[55:02] peace who hath made boat one hath broken
[55:06] down the middle wall petition
[55:10] &gt;&gt; between us.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 10. For the law having a
[55:22] shadow of good things to come.
[55:25] Not the very image of these things can
[55:28] never with those sacrifice were they
[55:30] offered year by year continually
[55:33] make comers there unto perfect. For thou
[55:36] would they have ceased to be offered
[55:39] because that the worshippers once purged
[55:42] should have no more conscience of sins.
[55:45] But in those sacrifices
[55:47] there is remembrance again made of sins
[55:50] every year.
[55:52] In other words, it only covered the red
[55:54] dot.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; It never took the desire away to sin.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Man, this thing could blow up tonight.
[56:05] Amen. So, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE
[56:08] BLOOD of bulls and goats should take
[56:10] away the sins.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; It didn't have the ability, THE ONLY
[56:15] ABILITY IT HAD WAS TO COVER IT UP. IT
[56:19] WAS A TEMPORARY VICTORY.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; So it was it WASN'T NEVER DESIGNED TO BE
[56:25] ABLE TO break it down.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Whereinfor have we cometh unto the
[56:32] world, he said, sacrifices and offers
[56:35] thou wouldest not, but a body has thou
[56:38] prepared for me, and burnt offers AND
[56:41] SACRIFICE FOR SIN THAT HAS no pleasure?
[56:44] Then said I, Lo, I come
[56:49] in the volume of the book. It is written
[56:52] of me to do thy will, oh God. In other
[56:56] words, I come to FULFILL THAT PERSONAL
[56:59] PRONOUN THAT WAS SPOKEN there in THE
[57:01] GARDEN OF EDEN. I WOULD PUT EMPATHY
[57:04] BETWEEN THY SEED AND THE serpent seed. I
[57:07] COME IN THE VOLUME of the book. I've
[57:10] come to FULFILL EVERYTHING THAT IS
[57:12] WRITTEN OF ME.
[57:15] And above when he said, "Sacrifices
[57:18] offering, burnt offerings, and offerings
[57:20] for sin, thou wouldest not, neither has
[57:23] pleasure therein, which are offered by
[57:26] the law." Then said, "Lo,
[57:29] I come to do thy will, oh God, he taketh
[57:31] away the first, that he can establish a
[57:34] second, by which we were sanctified
[57:38] through the offering of the body of
[57:39] Jesus Christ once and for all." Every
[57:43] priest standeth daily ministering and
[57:46] offering often times the same sacrifice.
[57:50] Brother David Paul there was no rest.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Listen to listen to the scripture. I
[57:55] know I minister on these years ago. Just
[57:56] bear with me. Every priest standed daily
[57:59] ministering offering OFTEN TIMES THE
[58:02] SAME SACRIFICE. WE CAN NEVER TAKE AWAY
[58:05] SIN. BUT THIS MAN AFTER HE OFFERED UP
[58:08] ONE SACRIFICE FOR SINS FOREVER SAT DOWN
[58:12] AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD. IN OTHER
[58:15] WORDS, AMEN. THERE WAS NO REST. IT WAS A
[58:18] NEVER A FINISHED WORK. THE THE PRIEST
[58:20] STANDED DAILY OFFERING UP THE SAME
[58:23] SACRIFICES. BUT THIS MAN OFFERED UP THE
[58:27] SACRIFICE OF A CREATIVE BLOOD THAT CAN
[58:30] NEVER LOSE HIS POWER. HEY, BUT SAT DOWN
[58:34] AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD TO TELL HIS
[58:37] BRIDE, "THIS IS A FINISHED WORK. THIS IS
[58:40] AN EVERLASTING COVENANT."
[58:44] &gt;&gt; The reason why it's an everlasting
[58:46] covenant is because the blood is good to
[58:50] the day of your redemption.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:56] Oh, he says
[59:00] he's going to Calvary.
[59:04] Amen. He's going to Calvary.
[59:06] Can I finish the scripture first? But
[59:08] this man after he offered up this
[59:10] sacrifice sins forever sat down at the
[59:12] right hand of God. For henceforth expect
[59:15] until the enemies be made his foottool.
[59:18] For by one offering he had perfected
[59:20] forever them that are sanctified.
[59:23] Whereof, the Holy Ghost also is witness
[59:25] to us. For after that he has said
[59:27] before, this is a covenant that I will
[59:30] make with them after those days, said
[59:32] the Lord, I'll put my laws into their
[59:35] hearts and their minds will I write
[59:37] them, and their sins and iniquities will
[59:41] I remember no more.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a power. AMEN. SO THERE
[59:47] GOES GOD. AMEN. THERE GOES CHRIST AT
[59:50] CALVARY. HIS BACK'S BEATING till his
[59:53] ribs showing through NEARLY HE SAID
[59:55] THERE HE STARTS UP THE ROAD WALKING
[59:56] along as he's going looking at them and
[59:59] I look oh all over his back there's
[1:00:01] little red spots over there like old
[1:00:03] GARMENT WAS WO THROUGHOUT WITHOUT a seam
[1:00:06] look AT THOSE RED SPOTS HE SAID WHAT ARE
[1:00:09] THEY directly they get bigger and bigger
[1:00:12] and bigger and the first thing they all
[1:00:15] run to one big spot
[1:00:17] he says now I hear something again what
[1:00:20] is it. HE SAID, "THERE GOES THE SECOND
[1:00:22] ADAM.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; THE FIRST ADAM BROUGHT IN DEATH,
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; a chasm, a distance, a fall."
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THE FIRST ADAM BROUGHT DEATH."
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "BUT HERE COMES THE SECOND
[1:00:38] ADAM."
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; HE'S GONE. HERE HE GOES. THIS ONE'S
[1:00:43] BRINGING LIFE. THERE'S ONE WHO TOOK LIFE
[1:00:46] OUT OF THE WORLD AND PLACED A CHASM
[1:00:49] THERE. HERE'S ONE WHO'S BRINGING LIFE
[1:00:51] BACK IN THE WORLD. THE SECOND ADAM WITH
[1:00:54] HIS OWN BLOOD HITTING AGAINST HIS OWN
[1:00:57] LEGS. THE SON OF GOD GOING TO CALVARY
[1:01:02] bearing away our sins.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; The blood to perfect the man and woman.
[1:01:09] Oh, catch this
[1:01:12] brother man. Even perfect a man or woman
[1:01:16] unconditionally.
[1:01:18] Hallelujah. Amen. You don't have to work
[1:01:21] for this. It ain't what I will do or
[1:01:24] have done. Amen. It's no. No. This is
[1:01:26] the unconditional COVENANT THAT GOD
[1:01:30] MADE. AMEN. With his creation.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE POWER TO BREAK EVERY FALL. IT'S
[1:01:37] A POWER TO BREAK EVERY CHASM. IT'S A
[1:01:40] POWER, A TO LOOSE EVERY SIN.
[1:01:45] And the 17th verse of Hebrews chapter 10
[1:01:47] says, "And their sins and iniquities,
[1:01:51] brother Travis, I remember them no more.
[1:01:57] Oh
[1:01:59] church, it's as easy as that." When he
[1:02:01] was looking at the cross, Sister Martha,
[1:02:04] he was looking to the thief on the
[1:02:05] cross. He looked over and said, "This
[1:02:08] day thou will be with me in paradise."
[1:02:10] Brother Bram said, "That was God's grace
[1:02:12] that did that.
[1:02:14] Amen. Thy sins and iniquities I will
[1:02:17] remember no more.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; It's the power of this everlasting
[1:02:22] COVENANT. GOD DOES NOT IMPUTE to you
[1:02:26] anything that's done because you're
[1:02:29] under this blood. He doesn't see it.
[1:02:32] It's the blood sacrifice. The only thing
[1:02:35] he God can see you in. Are you ready for
[1:02:39] this?
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for it?
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. When God looks through the blood
[1:02:44] and looks through the innocent blood, he
[1:02:47] looks through the sacrifice OF HIS OWN
[1:02:49] CREATED BLOOD,
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; he don't see Joe Bourneger's FAULT. HE
[1:02:54] DOESN'T SEE YOUR FAILURES.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; SAY, "Brother Joe, you're making a grace
[1:02:59] of disgrace." No. Amen. And he said,
[1:03:01] "The only thing that God CAN SEE IS THE
[1:03:04] WAY HE SAW YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF
[1:03:08] THE WORLD." WHEN HE PUT YOUR NAME IN THE
[1:03:11] LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE, HE SAYS, "THAT'S
[1:03:14] ALL HE CAN LOOK AT BECAUSE YOU ARE
[1:03:19] REDEEMED FROM EVERYTHING, EVERY SIN,
[1:03:22] EVERY BITTERNESS, EVERY SHAME, EVERY
[1:03:25] GUILT.
[1:03:28] You're washed in the blood of the lamb.
[1:03:33] He says, "Therefore, there's no g in
[1:03:35] you."
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? There's no sin
[1:03:38] in you. There's no bitterness.
[1:03:42] There's no unclean habit in you because
[1:03:45] the blood of the lamb has did this. And
[1:03:50] God cannot impute sin to you after you
[1:03:54] got a sin offering laying there waiting
[1:03:57] for you.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Tom, what can make me whole again?
[1:04:06] HUH? WHAT CAN MAKE YOU WHOLE AGAIN? THE
[1:04:10] BLOOD changed me.
[1:04:13] THE BLOOD OF THIS INNOCENT CREATIVE
[1:04:15] BLOOD, IT DIDN'T AMEN COVER MY PAST.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; It didn't cover the red spot. IT WASN'T
[1:04:23] A TEMPORARY VICTORY. IT WASN'T ONLY A
[1:04:27] TEMPORARY WORSHIP. IT WASN'T A TEMPORARY
[1:04:30] PRAISE. AMEN. BUT UNDER THIS NEW AND
[1:04:32] LIVING WAY, UNDER THE BLOOD, UNDER THIS
[1:04:36] POWER OF THIS NEW COVENANT, UNDER THIS
[1:04:39] EVERLASTING COVENANT, AMEN. WE'RE FULL
[1:04:42] OF VICTORY. WE'RE FULL OF WORSHIP. WE'RE
[1:04:44] FULL OF PRAISE. WE'RE FULL OF OVERCOMING
[1:04:47] POWER. WHAT CAN MAKE ME WHOLE AGAIN?
[1:04:51] NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. AMEN. It's not just a
[1:05:01] temporary fix.
[1:05:03] Revelation 1 and5 says unto him that
[1:05:07] loved us and a and washed us from our
[1:05:12] sins in his own blood.
[1:05:16] The word wash actually said means
[1:05:20] loosed.
[1:05:22] He's loosed us. Can we reread it? Unto
[1:05:25] him that loved us and loosed us from our
[1:05:29] sins in his own blood. Consider this.
[1:05:33] How many wants to consider this?
[1:05:35] Consider this. Since it is the blood of
[1:05:38] God, it's not manufactured.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; It's not a It's not man-made. Religion
[1:05:44] didn't make this. A church didn't make
[1:05:47] this. A man didn't make this.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Since it is the blood of
[1:05:54] God,
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Morgan, he said it is a perfect
[1:05:59] blood.
[1:06:01] He said it is a perfect blood is
[1:06:05] loosening us from the power of bondage
[1:06:08] and defilement of sin. Then it's
[1:06:10] loosening is perfect and his loosening
[1:06:13] is complete.
[1:06:16] No water. He said now there is now no
[1:06:19] more condemnation to them. Amen. I'm
[1:06:23] telling you this loosening IS PERFECT. I
[1:06:25] MAY FALL. I may MAKE MISTAKES. I MIGHT
[1:06:28] FALL SHORT. BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:06:31] CHRIST CAN NEVER FALL. IT CAN NEVER FALL
[1:06:34] SHORT. IT CAN NEVER LOSE ITS POWER. IT
[1:06:36] CAN NEVER LOSE ITS STRENGTH. IT CAN
[1:06:38] NEVER LOSE ITS ABILITY.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:44] It's solution is perfect and complete.
[1:06:47] Who brother Romans tells us who should
[1:06:51] lay anything to the charge of God's
[1:06:55] elect?
[1:06:57] Think about how powerful that statement
[1:06:59] is. Amen. We know.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Nobody else knows, but
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; we know.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; I know. You know, you know your past.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; You know what you done. You know what
[1:07:14] you're guilty of.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:07:20] He said, "But who shall lay anything to
[1:07:23] the charge of God's elect? It is God
[1:07:28] that justifies you." He said, "And
[1:07:31] declares US RIGHTEOUS. I DON'T CARE WHAT
[1:07:35] THE WORLD SAYS about me. THEY CAN TALK
[1:07:37] ABOUT ME. THEY CAN STANDALIZE MY NAME.
[1:07:40] THEY CAN ATTACH MY NAME TO anything want
[1:07:43] they want to." Amen. But what can make
[1:07:45] me WHOLE AGAIN? NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF
[1:07:48] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE POWER OF THIS EVERLASTING
[1:07:53] COVENANT. IT HAS TRANSFERRING POWER. IT
[1:07:56] HAS A TRANSFORMING ABILITY.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; What happens to the son? He said he
[1:08:05] becomes perfect fellowship with the
[1:08:08] father again
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; standing on the other side of the chasm
[1:08:12] with no remembrance. See see where he
[1:08:15] puts us. Amen. standing on the other
[1:08:17] side, not the opposite side. Amen. Where
[1:08:20] we was under the old covenant.
[1:08:23] A no, he drew us nigh by the blood of
[1:08:27] THE INNOCENT LAMB. AMEN. NOW WE'RE
[1:08:29] STANDING ON THIS SIDE OF THE CHASM.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE SAID, "WHAT HAPPENED?"
[1:08:36] PERFECT FELLOWSHIP STANDING ON THIS SIDE
[1:08:38] OF THE CHASM WITH NO REMEMBRANCE OF sin
[1:08:41] against him. NO MORE. THERE IS NO MORE
[1:08:44] STAIN OF THE BLEACH COULD EVER SEE it
[1:08:46] anymore.
[1:08:48] He is free. Oh, I'm preaching to every
[1:08:52] one of you. He is free. JUST AS A CLOROX
[1:08:57] ink can never you drop. And remember he
[1:08:59] said you take ink and you go drop it
[1:09:01] into the bleach. And the bleach, brother
[1:09:04] John has the ability. It's a solution.
[1:09:08] It has ability. Water can't do. It has
[1:09:11] ability. SODA CAN DO, HAS ABILITY NO
[1:09:15] OTHER LIQUID CAN DO, BUT COROX'S BLEACH
[1:09:18] has the chemical UH ABILITY TO BREAK
[1:09:21] DOWN THE MOLECULES THAT'S IN the drop of
[1:09:25] ink.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; And you drop THE INK IN AND THE BLEACH
[1:09:29] AUTOMATIC STARTS TO WORK. YOU DON'T HAVE
[1:09:31] TO PUMP IT UP, PRIME IT UP, TALK IT INTO
[1:09:33] IT. It the bleach just begins to do THE
[1:09:36] WORK. AMEN. THAT'S THE WAY THE BLOOD OF
[1:09:40] JESUS CHRIST IS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUMP
[1:09:42] IT UP, PRIME IT UP. YOU DROP YOUR PAST
[1:09:45] IN THE SEA OF GOD'S FORGIVENESS, IT HAS
[1:09:49] THE ability to break it down.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; UNDER THE OLD COVENANT WAS COVERED UP.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; BUT UNDER THIS NEW COVENANT, THE BLEACH
[1:10:01] OF GOD'S BLOOD,
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; not just cover it up.
[1:10:13] can never be ink no more.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; You think it's a coincidence? Brother
[1:10:21] Brown tripped over and found found
[1:10:23] something to say on tape about Clorox
[1:10:25] bleach. No sir, it's powerful.
[1:10:29] ONCE INK IS DROPPED INTO the bleach, IT
[1:10:34] REACHES THE POINT OF NO RETURN.
[1:10:39] HALLELUJAH. AND OUR SINS AND INIQUITY
[1:10:43] WILL BE REMEMBERED NO MORE.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:49] Cuz it's created blood.
[1:10:52] Not any blood would work. Not manufactur
[1:10:55] blood would work. NOT BULLS AND GOATS.
[1:10:57] MANUFACTURED BLOOD WOULD NEVER WORK.
[1:11:05] That ink can never be ink no more
[1:11:10] because it's broke up and sent back
[1:11:13] again.
[1:11:15] WHEN CONFESSED SIN IS CONFESSED and
[1:11:18] dipped into the blood, man or woman,
[1:11:23] it kills all symptoms.
[1:11:26] Catch this, Sister Eve. Every molecule
[1:11:31] of sin,
[1:11:34] every molecule of sin goes back,
[1:11:39] it breaks it down,
[1:11:42] all your past, all your failures.
[1:11:47] When your sins are confessed and dropped
[1:11:50] in the bleach of the son of God, it
[1:11:52] remits sin so much till he puts it in
[1:11:56] the sea of God's forgiveness and can
[1:11:58] never ever be remembered in the SIGHT OF
[1:12:02] GOD ANYMORE. What does that make a man?
[1:12:08] He said, what does that make a man? A
[1:12:10] son of God. And he SAID, "HEY, BECAUSE
[1:12:13] YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO be on this side of
[1:12:16] the chasm now." Amen. He has made you a
[1:12:19] SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD COULD NEVER GOD
[1:12:22] CAN NEVER remember your sins again.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "There it is. His death gave us
[1:12:30] the blood and the blood has loosed us.
[1:12:34] There is now no condemnation.
[1:12:37] How can there be?
[1:12:39] There's nothing to be condemned for
[1:12:44] because the blood has loosed us from our
[1:12:49] sin. We are free. We are guiltless.
[1:12:54] Don't listen to man.
[1:12:57] Come on, somebody preach with me. Don't
[1:13:00] listen to man. Listen to the word.
[1:13:05] YOU ARE LOOSED BY THE BLOOD. HE DIED NOT
[1:13:11] TO REDEEM PART OF YOU, BROTHER JOE. HE
[1:13:15] DIED TO REDEEM ALL OF YOU.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; To give you THE ABILITY TO COME BACK
[1:13:22] WHERE YOUR FIRST PLACE IS.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:28] OH, what the power of this everlasting
[1:13:30] covenant has such a transforming power.
[1:13:35] But if you're covered by the blood of
[1:13:37] Jesus Christ, brother, you're linked.
[1:13:43] You're linked with him.
[1:13:47] In other words, you're connected with
[1:13:48] him.
[1:13:50] You're joined with him.
[1:13:53] So the blood of this everlasting
[1:13:56] covenant not only has a transferring
[1:13:59] power, it has a joining power. It has a
[1:14:03] connection power. No wonder, brother,
[1:14:05] sister Denisha say, "All my power," God
[1:14:08] says, "All my power is yours, Sister
[1:14:10] Denisha. It's yours. You're an heir to
[1:14:13] it. ALL MY PROMISES, ALL MY POWER, ALL
[1:14:16] MY ABILITY, I give to you."
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THE BLOOD BROUGHT YOU in
[1:14:22] connection with that power.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Is that going over your
[1:14:27] heads tonight? Amen. That you're
[1:14:29] connected. AMEN. YOU'RE NOT WAITING ON
[1:14:31] THE POWER TO GET TO THE OUTLET. THE
[1:14:33] POWER'S ALREADY THERE. AMEN. And when
[1:14:36] the BLOOD OF THIS INNOCENT LAMB, AMEN,
[1:14:38] YOU CROSS THE CHASM, YOU'RE CONNECTED
[1:14:41] WITH THE POWER. YOU'RE NOT WAITING ON IT
[1:14:44] TO COME. AMEN. YOU'RE THIS SIDE OF THE
[1:14:46] CHASM. YOU SPEAK TO THE MOUNTAIN AND IT
[1:14:49] WILL HAVE TO FLEE. YOU SPEAK TO YOUR
[1:14:52] STORM AND IT WILL HAVE TO CEASE.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. There's connecting power.
[1:14:59] There's a joining power. There is a
[1:15:02] linking power.
[1:15:04] Linked with him in power. Linked with
[1:15:06] him in freedom. No wonder it says in
[1:15:10] Revelation, we overcome by the blood of
[1:15:11] the lamb. In the word of our testimony,
[1:15:15] by the blood I'm redeemed. By the blood,
[1:15:17] I'm healed. By the blood, I'm delivered.
[1:15:20] By the blood, I'm secure. By the blood,
[1:15:22] I'm I'm justified.
[1:15:25] There's no shame on me.
[1:15:28] All records are destroyed.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; We can't be judged no more. He says
[1:15:37] we're not patched up or covered up. The
[1:15:39] molecules have been changed by the
[1:15:42] bleach of the blood that transfor
[1:15:45] transferred our sin and our guilt and
[1:15:49] our shame. You are declared righteous
[1:15:53] through the power of this everlasting
[1:15:55] covenant.
[1:15:57] Hallelujah.
[1:16:00] Living, he loved me. Dying, he saved me.
[1:16:05] Buried, he carried my sins far away. He
[1:16:09] took your sins of the people upon
[1:16:11] himself. He was a sin offering.
[1:16:14] Buried, he carried my sins far away. No
[1:16:18] more can they be remembered. They're
[1:16:20] gone. Listen to this powerful statement.
[1:16:23] They are out of the eyes of God.
[1:16:32] That's powerful tonight.
[1:16:34] They are paralyzed.
[1:16:38] They are divorced.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE PUT AWAY. GOD don't even
[1:16:44] remember them anymore. They are been
[1:16:46] loosed.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE BEEN BROKE DOWN. EVERY
[1:16:50] MOLECULE HAS BEEN BROKEN DOWN.
[1:16:53] HALLELUJAH. You say, "Not me, Brother
[1:16:55] Joe. I've been a drug addict. I'VE BEEN
[1:16:57] A ALCOHOLIC. I'VE BEEN AN ADULTERER.
[1:16:59] I'VE BEEN I've been a gambler. I've been
[1:17:02] this and I've been that." Amen. I'm
[1:17:04] telling you. Amen. You ain't been to a
[1:17:06] place where God's grace can't find you.
[1:17:09] Amen. If you're a part of God before the
[1:17:11] foundation of the world, Amen. HE SAID,
[1:17:13] "YOU MAKE YOUR BED IN HELL. I'LL SHOW UP
[1:17:16] THERE. IF YOU ASCEND TO THE HEAVENS, I'M
[1:17:18] GOING TO SHOW UP THERE. IF YOU RUN, I'LL
[1:17:21] CATCH YOU. IF YOU HIDE, I'LL FIND YOU.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY GRACE TO YOU TONIGHT. YOU SAY,
[1:17:28] "NOT ME, Brother Joe. You don't know
[1:17:29] what I've been through. I might not
[1:17:31] know, but I know the power of this
[1:17:34] blood."
[1:17:36] That one lady at Michigan was thinking
[1:17:38] the same thing. She was a harlot. Hey,
[1:17:40] she gave her life to prostitution. She
[1:17:43] was a drug addict. A bet. Nobody wanted
[1:17:45] nothing to do with her. She was an
[1:17:47] outcast.
[1:17:51] There she was. Amen. A RED SPOT ALL OVER
[1:17:54] HER LIFE.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; And brother B said, and begin to
[1:17:58] encourage us. Just pray, sister. Just
[1:18:00] pray. Just begin to pray. Begin to pray
[1:18:03] to your God. BEGIN TO ENTER ENTER INTO
[1:18:06] PRAYER. AMEN. I'm telling you, God can
[1:18:08] do something with you. GOD CAN REMOVE
[1:18:10] GOD CAN DO SOMETHING SPECIAL for you.
[1:18:12] And she be to pray just like you did one
[1:18:15] day. Amen. She came to an altar. She
[1:18:17] began to pray right there where she was
[1:18:18] at. Brother Brown would walk by and
[1:18:20] there she was still praying. All of a
[1:18:22] sudden, Brother Brown said she she
[1:18:24] reached the point of no return.
[1:18:27] Something happened. BROTHER BROWN SAID
[1:18:30] IT TOOK HER BACK TO THE time of she was
[1:18:33] a virgin. Oh, you talking about the
[1:18:36] blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. We put
[1:18:38] limits on the blood. WE PUT LIMITS.
[1:18:41] AMEN. THERE'S PEOPLE I GIVEN UP ON. SAID
[1:18:43] THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR. BUT GOD WHO'S
[1:18:46] RICH IN MERCY NEVER GAVE UP ON YOU. HE
[1:18:49] CAME CHASING YOU DOWN. AND THAT'S WHY
[1:18:52] YOU'RE SITTING HERE THIS MORNING. AMEN.
[1:18:55] NO GUILT, NO MOLECULE OF SIN, NO SHAME.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:19:05] And there's no big eyes and little 's
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; from this wall to the back doors.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; We all humans.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; We're all came the same way. We all
[1:19:21] fight our battles. We all go through
[1:19:23] situations. But end of the day, I am
[1:19:26] what I am by the grace of God. I'm
[1:19:28] serving the Lord NOT ON MY OWN MERITS.
[1:19:30] I'M NOT SERVING THE LORD ON MY OWN
[1:19:32] WORKS. AND I TELL YOU TONIGHT, I'M
[1:19:34] PREACHING THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST
[1:19:36] TONIGHT BECAUSE I AM WHAT I AM BY THE
[1:19:39] GRACE OF ALMIGHTY GOD AND THE BLOOD of
[1:19:42] the innocent lamb.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:49] What an everlasting covenant. You love
[1:19:52] him.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my time's getting away.
[1:19:56] He said New Testament is a new covenant.
[1:20:00] It's a new life. show Jesus has met
[1:20:03] every requirement for us that God
[1:20:05] required to make us make us back truly
[1:20:08] sons and daughters of God under the
[1:20:10] blood with there's no more condemnation
[1:20:13] the bride. Oh, what can he do with me?
[1:20:17] Have you ever said that Dave Paul? I
[1:20:18] know I have. What could God do with me?
[1:20:21] Look at you.
[1:20:24] Look at you. I tell you what, God can
[1:20:27] make you a son and daughter of God.
[1:20:31] said, "What could he do?" They thought
[1:20:33] the same thing the day of Noah.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; What in the world was Noah doing with a
[1:20:37] bunch of gopher wood?
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Hey, that was the worst wood. Amen. That
[1:20:43] wasn't that well, you couldn't get no
[1:20:44] worse wood.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; And and Noah's out there collecting the
[1:20:48] all the gopher wood that he can get.
[1:20:52] and he takes and go gets an evergreen
[1:20:54] tree and he begins to take the light the
[1:20:57] sap out of the evergreen tree and he
[1:21:00] begins to boil the sap and all of a
[1:21:02] sudden he begins to pour the hot resin
[1:21:04] upon the gopher wood and the gopher wood
[1:21:07] is designed it WAS THE ONLY WOOD THAT
[1:21:09] WOULD soak it up and brother BROWN SAID
[1:21:11] THAT THAT GOPHER WOOD I tell you that's
[1:21:13] the way I feel tonight amen I wasn't
[1:21:15] nobody special I was a gopher wood a but
[1:21:18] God WHERE I COULDN'T MAKE IT TO HEAVEN
[1:21:20] HEAVEN CAME DOWN and embraced this
[1:21:22] earth. He been told me, he said, "Hey,
[1:21:24] JOE, YOU CAN'T, BUT I'VE ALREADY done
[1:21:26] it." HE SAID, "WHEN I WILL PUT EMPATHY,"
[1:21:28] BROTHER BROWN SAID, "WHEN HE SAYS, "I
[1:21:30] WILL," THAT MEANS IT'S ALREADY DONE. I'M
[1:21:33] NOT WAITING ON it to come, church.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:38] But once, brother M said once that old
[1:21:41] gopher wood is filled up with that that
[1:21:46] hot sap, it begins to get harder than
[1:21:49] steel.
[1:21:51] too heavy. Didn't look like it'd ever
[1:21:54] float. They said, "Man, that that guy
[1:21:56] there'll never make a good Christian.
[1:21:58] That guy there'll never make a body
[1:21:59] change. That guy right there will never
[1:22:01] that lady there'll never make a rapture.
[1:22:05] She's nothing but gopherwood." And God's
[1:22:07] pouring out his life upon her.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; She keeps soaking it up. And all of a
[1:22:11] sudden, she gets so hard. Hey, but not
[1:22:14] her spirit hard, but she gets so cased
[1:22:16] over by the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:22:20] Listen friends. Amen. Brother said you
[1:22:22] can bump AGAINST THE LOGS AND IT DOESN'T
[1:22:24] CHANGE YOU. You can go through trials
[1:22:26] and it doesn't stop you. You can go
[1:22:28] through persecution and it can't hinder
[1:22:31] you.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THAT'S THE WAY THE ARK WAS.
[1:22:35] AMEN. IT WAS RISEN AND RAISED ABOVE IT
[1:22:38] ALL.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; And church, that's the way you are. You
[1:22:43] bloodbound promised people. AMEN. YOU

[1:22:48] YOU. THEY COULD STANDIZE YOUR NAME, BUT

[1:22:52] going to float.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:23:09] remodel, the new homes we build, the new
[1:23:12] job we take, it's here today and gone
[1:23:15] tomorrow. There's no continuing city.

[1:23:34] in the face of jealousy. We can look in
[1:23:36] the face of sickness. Said, "You had a
[1:23:38] beginning and you have an end."
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I CAME FROM GOD AND I'M GOING
[1:23:43] BACK TO GOD.

[1:29:29] everlasting covenant. He sees you as it
[1:29:33] was in his mind before the foundation of
[1:29:37] the world that God took a picture of
[1:29:39] you.
[1:29:42] Charles, he took a picture of you and he
[1:29:44] put it on file.

[1:29:49] picture on file.
[1:29:53] And when he seen Adam and Eve walking
[1:29:55] out, he said, "I will put empathy
[1:29:58] between thy seed and that woman's seat."

[1:30:57] of Almighty God.

[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; I find it a privilege
[1:32:56] to be able to minister to God's elect.
[1:33:03] When I'm preparing a message, I'm
[1:33:05] thinking, Lord God, what can I say to
[1:33:08] your precious bride? We're not preaching
[1:33:11] just to church members. We're preaching
[1:33:13] to the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:17] Hallelujah.
[1:33:20] I tell you, God would wrap his blanket
[1:33:22] of love from the front of this building
[1:33:25] all around this tabernacle. I pray
[1:33:29] tonight that God would put a love in
[1:33:31] your heart that that that little
[1:33:33] something that you may have had in your
[1:33:35] heart for so long that God would squeeze
[1:33:38] that right out of your life. Oh,
[1:33:41] hallelujah. You talk about freedom. Let
[1:33:44] God get let the love of God get a hold
[1:33:46] of your heart. Amen. And you'll have
[1:33:48] such a freedom to worship fe freedom to

[1:33:53] hand. Freedom to lift your hands.

[1:33:58] to run. A freedom to dance. A freedom to
[1:34:01] speak in tongues. A FREEDOM TO SHOUT. A
[1:34:03] freedom to dance. A freedom to praise
[1:34:06] God. Let everything that has breath.

[1:34:12] TO take my place. I say I'm REDEEMED BY
[1:34:16] THE BLOOD of the lamb
[1:34:22] and I'm on this side of the chasm.
[1:34:28] I'm free. I'm not speaking in in a
[1:34:31] future tense. I'm not speaking in the
[1:34:33] past tense, present tense. I'm free. I'm
[1:34:37] free. I'm free. I've been delivered.
[1:34:41] I've been exonerated as my sins have
[1:34:43] been divorced. My sins has been erased
[1:34:46] and put on the the head of my adversary,
[1:34:51] the devil. And he's carrying my past to
[1:34:54] hell. HE'S CARRYING MY SINS TO HELL.
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Boo devil.
[1:35:02] Boo devil. He came to the wrong place at
[1:35:06] the wrong time tonight. Boo devil. You
[1:35:08] ain't got no hold on this bride. She's
[1:35:10] free. She's liberated. Hey, but by the
[1:35:14] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR has sound the gospel
[1:35:17] trumpet. I don't care how much Satan
[1:35:19] tries to curse you tonight.
[1:35:22] God cannot curse what he's already
[1:35:25] blessed.
[1:35:26] Listen, church, if you don't get this,
[1:35:28] write this down. Put it on your
[1:35:30] refrigerator. You are blessed. You are a
[1:35:32] chosen generation. You're a royal
[1:35:35] priesthood. You're a peculiar class of
[1:35:37] people.
[1:35:40] You're a redeemed class of people. And
[1:35:43] no matter what the devil says,
[1:35:48] he's not getting my praise.
[1:35:52] He's not getting my glory. I am what I
[1:35:55] am by the grace of God.
[1:36:00] Hallelujah.
[1:36:02] Hallelujah. Do you love him?

[1:36:13] Are you free?
[1:36:16] How many's free? Who the son has made
[1:36:19] free is free indeed?
[1:36:23] The power
[1:36:25] of this blood
[1:36:28] has the power to exonerate you and set
[1:36:33] you free.
[1:36:35] and take you back to the place you was
[1:36:38] before the foundation of the world.
[1:36:42] Hallelujah.
[1:36:44] Hallelujah.
[1:36:46] God's good to us
[1:36:50] and his thoughts
[1:36:52] can never change.
[1:36:56] But David Paul, he had a thought of you
[1:36:58] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:37:00] no matter what happened on earth,
[1:37:03] didn't matter what happened, what went,
[1:37:05] you done that, you done this, want that,
[1:37:08] we didn't have a worried God by his
[1:37:11] fornowledge. Brother Brown said, he made
[1:37:13] a a covenant unconditionally.
[1:37:16] And he took a picture at your best
[1:37:19] because he knew the power of the blood
[1:37:21] would come searching for you. You didn't
[1:37:23] go looking for him. God came looking for
[1:37:26] you. And when in your predestined moment
[1:37:28] of time came, amen, it drawled you past.
[1:37:32] Amen. There was one time you'd in and
[1:37:34] out. I was in and out. You was in and
[1:37:36] out. But then then, Brother Caleb, then
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:40] you accepted the pardon.
[1:37:44] You accepted the pardon. And the
[1:37:46] pardoning has a releasing power. And it
[1:37:49] released you. And it draw you nigh unto
[1:37:53] your maker. Amen. pulled you across the
[1:37:57] chasm and removed the chasm out of the
[1:38:00] way. And there you stand tonight,
[1:38:03] redeemed by the blood of the lamb, white
[1:38:06] as snow, as though you've never done it
[1:38:11] in the first place.
[1:38:13] [Music]
[1:38:15] Oh, I'm free.
[1:38:19] Praise the Lord. I'm free. No longer
[1:38:23] bound.
[1:38:27] Chains holding me. My soul's resting.
[1:38:32] Oh, such a blessing.
[1:38:36] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I'm free.
[1:38:43] Oh, I'm free.
[1:38:46] Praise the Lord. I'm free. No longer b
[1:38:53] No more chains holding me. My soul is
[1:38:57] resting.

[1:39:03] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:05] Hallelujah. I'm free. I'll be free
[1:39:09] tonight. I'm free.
[1:39:14] So Lord, I'm free. No longer bound.
[1:39:20] No more change in me. My soul's resting.
[1:39:26] Oh, such a blessing.
[1:39:29] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:39:32] Hallelujah. I'm free. You know what?
[1:39:37] We had a lot of things attached to us.
[1:39:40] We had leans on our life. We had leans
[1:39:43] on this property.
[1:39:47] We had a title.
[1:39:49] But we need an abstract title deed that
[1:39:52] brother said was strickened off.
[1:39:56] That's what the blood of this
[1:39:57] everlasting covenant did. It came down
[1:40:00] and struck that. Amen. It took it all
[1:40:04] the way back. Brother B said abstract
[1:40:06] searched all the way back to the very
[1:40:10] mind of God and says nope, he's
[1:40:13] innocent. No, there's no leans on him.
[1:40:17] No, there's no shame on him. No, he is
[1:40:20] my son. No, she is my daughter.
[1:40:25] AIN'T BEEN AN ABSTRACT TITLE deed that
[1:40:28] goes all the way back. That's what this
[1:40:31] blood of this new covenant did for you
[1:40:34] and I. There's no leans anywhere. Satan
[1:40:37] ain't got no leans on this property any
[1:40:41] longer. Hallelujah. Say, "What do you
[1:40:43] mean about?" I say the blood of Jesus
[1:40:46] Christ that day at Calvary, that body
[1:40:50] was a wrapped up
[1:40:53] and then that something anointed that
[1:40:56] Roman soldier to go over there and
[1:41:00] pierce the side
[1:41:03] of our Christmas package.
[1:41:06] And brother Abraham said that package
[1:41:08] was opened up at Calvary and blood. Oh,
[1:41:12] hallelujah. That blood of almighty God
[1:41:17] begin to pour out upon the flesh body of
[1:41:21] Jesus and it begin to go down his legs
[1:41:24] and drop off the cross and drop upon
[1:41:27] this earth and begin to claim a 16
[1:41:31] element body.
[1:41:35] Oh, dumb devil. Oh, dumb devil. He
[1:41:38] thought he was doing something special,
[1:41:40] but he opened up the present for you and
[1:41:42] I. And because of that day at Calvary,
[1:41:45] reaped the benefits. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:41:49] What an exchange. He exchanged it for
[1:41:52] you and I, I am free this morning, this
[1:41:56] evening. By the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:42:00] Hallelujah. It claimed you right there.
[1:42:04] Hallelujah.
[1:42:06] Oh, isn't that powerful?
[1:42:09] No more chains holding me. Soul is
[1:42:14] resting
[1:42:16] with such a blessing.
[1:42:20] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I'm free.
[1:42:26] Are you free? Oh, just lift your hands
[1:42:29] to for a moment. If you're truly free
[1:42:32] tonight, this is a wave over to your
[1:42:34] Lord. Thank you Lord for that day at
[1:42:36] Calvary. Thank you for the precious
[1:42:39] blood of the of creed of power of
[1:42:42] almighty God.
[1:42:45] Thank you for erasing my past. Thank you
[1:42:47] for clearing my record, clearing the
[1:42:50] deed.
[1:42:52] Oh yes, I am free.
[1:42:56] Oh, praise the Lord. I'm free.
[1:43:07] My soul is resting
[1:43:10] in such a mercy.
[1:43:14] Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Once
[1:43:18] again,
[1:43:19] oh yes, I'm free.
[1:43:24] Oh, praise the Lord. I don't
[1:43:31] know Lord Jesus.
[1:43:35] [Music]
[1:43:37] It's such a blessing.
[1:43:40] Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:43:45] I'm free,
[1:43:47] Lord Jesus. We thank you, Lord, for
[1:43:49] another opportunity to come and rally it
[1:43:52] around your precious word tonight. I
[1:43:54] pray, Lord God, that they catch a
[1:43:56] glimpse of such a precious word that's
[1:43:59] came in our hour by the messenger of
[1:44:02] Malachi 4. Lord, to let us know, Lord,
[1:44:05] we never done it in the first place.
[1:44:08] It's been broken down in our past and
[1:44:11] went back to the accuser, the devil, to
[1:44:13] take it all the way to hell. Oh, what
[1:44:16] the power of this New Testament covenant
[1:44:20] that was given to a believer. Oh, God.
[1:44:23] That we're standing not not just
[1:44:25] forgiven but justified.
[1:44:28] In your eyes, who can lay anything to
[1:44:31] the charge of of your elect? It is you,
[1:44:34] Lord, that justify. It is you, Lord,
[1:44:37] that liberated us. It was the power of
[1:44:40] that creative blood cell that was broken
[1:44:43] that day at Calvary. And the life of
[1:44:45] that blood could come now
[1:44:48] and separate us
[1:44:52] and erase it, divorce it,
[1:44:56] make us free. We're so thankful for it
[1:44:59] tonight, Lord.
[1:45:01] Thank you, Lord God, for our service
[1:45:03] tonight. Thank you for your presence,
[1:45:06] Lord. I pray, Lord God, that you just
[1:45:07] bless everyone here tonight. Lord,
[1:45:09] everyone may be listening online,
[1:45:12] Lord God. I once again pray, Lord God,
[1:45:15] for the family down there, fixing,
[1:45:17] expect life to come in to this world.
[1:45:20] Lord, I pray that you'll give them a
[1:45:21] special blessing. Lord,
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:25] be right there with them every step of
[1:45:27] the way. We pray and ask in Jesus
[1:45:30] Christ's wonderful name. And the bride
[1:45:33] says, "God bless you this evening. Well,
[1:45:36] I'm free.
[1:45:39] Oh, praise the Lord. I'm free. No
[1:45:43] longer.
[1:45:46] No more chasing me. My soul was free.
[1:45:53] It's such a blessing.
[1:45:56] Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:46:02] Oh yes, I'm free.
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:09] No more.
[1:46:13] No more chasing me.
[1:46:20] Such a blessing.
[1:46:23] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:46:27] Amen.
[1:46:30] Felt once like a bird in
[1:46:36] [Music]
