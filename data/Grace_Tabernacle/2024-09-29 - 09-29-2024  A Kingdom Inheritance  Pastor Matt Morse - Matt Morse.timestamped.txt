[53:34] read out of the first verse Jesus said
[53:36] let not your heart be troubled you
[53:38] believed in God believe also in me in my
[53:41] father's house are many mansions if it
[53:43] were not so I would have told you I go
[53:46] to prepare a place for you and if I go
[53:48] and prepare a place for you I will come
[53:50] again and receive you unto myself that
[53:53] where I am there you may be also and
[53:56] whether I go you know and the way you
[53:59] know and Thomas saith unto him Lord we
[54:02] know we know not whether thou goest and
[54:04] how can we know the way and Jesus said
[54:06] unto him I am the way the truth and the
[54:08] life and no man cometh unto the father
[54:11] but by me we just ask ask the Lord to
[54:13] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[54:15] word this morning as you take your seats
[54:17] and I want to speak this morning on a
[54:19] kingdom inheritance we've been uh
[54:22] preaching on a series on on a kingdom
[54:25] series over the past several weeks and
[54:28] uh this morning I want to take this
[54:29] direction on a kingdom inheritance last
[54:32] Sunday if I know many of you were here
[54:35] uh but last Sunday we spoke on a kingdom
[54:37] Revelation how many how many uh that was
[54:39] a blessing to them I hope it hope it was
[54:42] but uh we were speaking on the kingdom
[54:44] Revelation and how that uh Peter's
[54:46] Revelation that that that that earned
[54:49] him or or or from it God had given him
[54:52] uh the keys to the kingdom and we we
[54:54] showed how that he used that key to open
[54:56] the door to every class of people
[54:58] remember in the book of Acts in the
[55:00] second chapter he he opened the door to
[55:02] the he went from the upper room and
[55:05] preached the gospel and and uh and and
[55:07] and and they were filled with the Holy
[55:09] Ghost and that was to the Jews and then
[55:10] in Acts the 8th chapter to the Samaritan
[55:13] uh he preached and went to Samaria and
[55:15] they were filled with the Holy Ghost and
[55:16] then acts the 10th chapter he went down
[55:18] to the Gentile cornelius's house and
[55:20] they were filled with the Holy Ghost and
[55:22] you notice each time it was the same
[55:23] message and the same gospel and the same
[55:25] Holy Ghost that came and so brother Bram
[55:28] said there was our three people it was
[55:29] ham Shem and japas people so no more
[55:31] from that day was an apostle used to for
[55:34] the keys to the kingdom to open the
[55:36] kingdom because it was open to everybody
[55:38] then I thank God this morning that we
[55:40] sit here uh with an Open Door by the
[55:42] Holy Ghost brother Jared that we've been
[55:44] given an Open Door the church has
[55:46] received the power of God we're not
[55:48] sitting here as a powerless people but
[55:49] we're sitting uh as Believers this
[55:52] morning that has received the power of
[55:53] God God has given us a door and access
[55:56] uh into the kingdom of God and I believe
[55:58] that uh it's it was never closed he said
[56:00] it would be a door that would be opened
[56:02] that could never be closed and it was
[56:03] not a door that was opened by man it was
[56:05] opened by God he gave the key and the
[56:07] key uh he opened it up that we could all
[56:09] en enjoy the blessings and the fruit of
[56:11] that land that God has certainly given
[56:13] to us this day and but even even then
[56:16] the Bible would say that there was still
[56:18] yet many great Mysteries that surrounded
[56:20] the kingdom of God uh that would remain
[56:22] but but but but throughout the
[56:24] generations through thousands of years
[56:26] that has gone by and the Mystery would
[56:27] remain uh around the church but the
[56:29] Bible promised in that time that there
[56:31] would come a day a time that there would
[56:33] no longer be a mystery to the church and
[56:35] you remember when John wrote about it in
[56:37] Revelations the 10th chapter he said in
[56:38] the days of the voice of the seventh
[56:41] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[56:43] mystery of God would be finished as he
[56:45] has declared unto his servants the
[56:47] prophets now I know what the world has
[56:48] done with that they said well it'll be
[56:50] the end of time that's this great
[56:51] trumpet will sound and all the the
[56:53] Mysteries will be revealed in in in
[56:55] eternity but where the mark it all the
[56:57] Mysteries will will be revealed and
[56:58] we'll all know all these things of God
[57:00] but but when you actually uh uh look at
[57:02] this scripture in the days of the voice
[57:04] this word days comes from a Hebrew word
[57:06] Hamera which meant a day or a time or a
[57:10] period of years and so we realize that
[57:12] it couldn't be a time in eternity it's
[57:14] not coming after the Rapture in a time
[57:16] of Eternity but it was actually during a
[57:18] space of time preceding the Rapture so
[57:21] so John would say in the days of the
[57:22] voice you could say it like this in the
[57:24] age of The Voice or in the time time of
[57:26] The Voice or in the years of the voice
[57:28] of the seventh angel when he would begin
[57:30] to sound then the mystery of God would
[57:32] be finished so we realize that this
[57:33] morning that we're not living in an age
[57:36] of mystery but we're living in an age of
[57:37] Revelation how many say Amen to that
[57:39] we're not living in an age of mystery
[57:41] God has took the mystery off the church
[57:42] I know there may be some people that are
[57:44] that are living in mystery but but it's
[57:46] just because they haven't came to the
[57:48] light but the mystery has been revealed
[57:50] the all that that was hidden has been
[57:52] open to the Church of the Living God
[57:53] there ain't no promise that God has
[57:55] given the church that is not available
[57:57] there's no uh there there's nothing in
[57:58] the scripture that God had ever promised
[58:00] to any believer that is not open to us
[58:02] today you believe that this morning so
[58:04] we're a body of Believers we've got to
[58:06] write to the promises of God we see that
[58:08] that that there was so many Mysteries
[58:10] but according to the Bible they would be
[58:11] revealed in the end time John said in
[58:14] the mystery would be finished in other
[58:16] words there wouldn't be another mystery
[58:17] that would come and but said what would
[58:19] happen he said the B the Bible says is
[58:21] the Angel is supposed to reveal the
[58:23] mysteries of God and and they would be
[58:25] revealed in this day and I know that
[58:27] many have put that on on on a man and
[58:29] many have put it on on somebody like
[58:32] that but said but I say this with
[58:33] reverence he said I'm not referring to
[58:35] myself I'm referring to the angel of God
[58:38] so we realize it was the angel of God
[58:40] that revealed the mystery of serpent
[58:42] seed that said that it wasn't it
[58:44] wasn't an apple or something in the
[58:47] garden that caused the fall in the
[58:48] garden you see it was the angel of God
[58:50] that revealed the mystery of an eternal
[58:52] hell where the world would say that
[58:54] you'll burn for eternity but here the
[58:55] angel of the Lord would come and say
[58:57] Well it couldn't be an eternal hell
[58:59] because if it was eternal it meant it
[59:01] had no beginning and no ending and hell
[59:03] was created for Satan and his angels so
[59:05] so it couldn't be Eternal but it was an
[59:07] angel from of God brother Mark that
[59:09] revealed the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:11] without Sensation that there had to be a
[59:13] move of God that the person of Christ
[59:15] would come and perform the works that he
[59:16] did before it was the angel of God that
[59:18] revealed water baptism remember the
[59:20] extreme trinitarian had had taken the
[59:23] formula of water baptism made Father and
[59:25] Son and Holy ghost and and built this
[59:27] great uh uh Church in that way but the
[59:29] angel of God would come and would reveal
[59:31] it the right way back in the end time it
[59:33] was the angel of God that would reveal
[59:34] the mystery of the godhead by the
[59:37] baptism of Jesus Christ of him the being
[59:40] the father and the Son and the Holy
[59:41] Ghost and that in that in that same name
[59:43] it was the angel of God that would
[59:45] introduce the pillar of fire in this age
[59:47] that we're living in again the returning
[59:49] of the pillar of fire it was the angel
[59:50] of God that would that would reveal the
[59:53] true Grace and not uh not as the world
[59:56] has made it but not as a disgrace but
[59:58] when the angel of the Lord would reveal
[1:00:00] Grace he would reveal it as God had
[1:00:02] intended it for to be in other words
[1:00:04] it's Grace it would cover everything but
[1:00:06] it was Grace enough to take you out of
[1:00:08] sin it was it was Grace enough to to
[1:00:10] give you the ability to overcome the
[1:00:12] flesh it so so it the angel of the Lord
[1:00:15] that brought the revelations of God it
[1:00:17] was the angel of God that brought the
[1:00:18] revelation of the kingdom of God it
[1:00:20] wasn't a man it was the angel of God
[1:00:22] somebody say Amen just preach with me a
[1:00:23] minute it was the angel of God that done
[1:00:25] it and it ain't a man two times too many
[1:00:27] times we get focused on who's doing what
[1:00:29] and what man's doing this and who who's
[1:00:32] got this position or who's got this
[1:00:33] place but but but look past the man this
[1:00:36] morning and look to the angel of the
[1:00:38] Lord and see what God is doing you
[1:00:39] realize it's a work of God and what God
[1:00:41] has doing in our midst it's not to give
[1:00:43] credit to a man or to a group of people
[1:00:45] but it's to give credit to the Holy
[1:00:47] Ghost and what God is doing for us in
[1:00:49] this hour so when we come and we worship
[1:00:51] and we praise God we're thanking God for
[1:00:53] what God is doing it ain't somebody
[1:00:56] that's building us up it's but what God
[1:00:57] has done for us but the mark it causes
[1:00:59] us to be able to come and give back to
[1:01:01] him it was the angel of God that brought
[1:01:03] the Revelation he said it was the
[1:01:04] revelation of the Kingdom being the
[1:01:06] spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost it
[1:01:08] came by the angel of God you know this
[1:01:11] this morning that God desires for you to
[1:01:13] catch the revelation of the age that you
[1:01:15] live in that's the desire of God and I
[1:01:17] realize that it's a struggle today it's
[1:01:19] a struggle for people to even come to
[1:01:21] church or to sit in the house of God but
[1:01:23] let alone to catch the revelation of the
[1:01:25] age that the they live in but this has
[1:01:26] always been God's desire all the way
[1:01:28] back in the beginning when he started
[1:01:30] with Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel it
[1:01:32] was God's desire for them to catch the
[1:01:34] revelation of the age that they lived in
[1:01:36] remember when Cain he went out and he
[1:01:38] made a sacrifice before God but God
[1:01:40] denied Cain and he accepted Abel why did
[1:01:43] he accept Abel brother said because he
[1:01:44] had the right sacrifice and God received
[1:01:47] Abel by faith and by Revelation there
[1:01:49] wasn't no other way there wasn't a Bible
[1:01:51] that was written so it only came by
[1:01:54] Revelation and then his faith in the
[1:01:56] Revelation that he had he performed a
[1:01:58] sacrifice before God and God accepted
[1:02:00] him upon those grounds he said see so
[1:02:02] you can see that the beginning of
[1:02:04] righteousness is God's revealed truth
[1:02:07] speaking of Revelation and the entire
[1:02:09] Church of the Living God is built upon
[1:02:11] that can you say that with me this
[1:02:13] morning the beginning of righteousness
[1:02:15] is God's revealed truth somebody say
[1:02:18] that with me the beginning of
[1:02:19] righteousness is God's revealed truth
[1:02:22] and the entire Church of the Living God
[1:02:25] is built bu upon that now I don't think
[1:02:27] for a minute that anybody come in this
[1:02:29] church this morning that don't want to
[1:02:30] be right before God I don't think that
[1:02:33] you wasted your time and you come down
[1:02:35] to the house of God and you don't want
[1:02:36] to be righteous before God but I believe
[1:02:38] that we have a desire to be right by God
[1:02:40] I believe we have a desire for God to be
[1:02:42] pleased with us I believe that the
[1:02:44] desire of our heart is that God would
[1:02:46] accept our sacrifice when we make a
[1:02:48] sacrifice before God I believe that's
[1:02:50] the desire of our heart but the prophet
[1:02:52] said but the beginning of righteousness
[1:02:53] in order to be righteous before God the
[1:02:56] beginning of righteousness is a revealed
[1:02:58] truth of God see this is what separated
[1:03:00] Peter from all the rest of them in the
[1:03:02] world when it came concerning Christ was
[1:03:04] the revealed truth that Peter had that
[1:03:06] the rest of the world didn't have he had
[1:03:08] a revelation of who he was brother the
[1:03:10] mark and it separated him from the world
[1:03:12] and that's what separates you from the
[1:03:14] world this morning it's revealed truths
[1:03:16] they may have Finer Things They may have
[1:03:18] some with with finer houses they may
[1:03:20] have finer cars they they may have finer
[1:03:22] jobs but friends you have something that
[1:03:24] the world don't have you have a revealed
[1:03:26] truth of God's word and that's the
[1:03:29] beginning of righteousness with God here
[1:03:31] the world is seeking to be accepted by
[1:03:33] God and they make all the effort and all
[1:03:35] the the time spent and all the work that
[1:03:37] they put in in order to be accepted by
[1:03:39] God but the beginning of righteousness
[1:03:41] is a revealed truth I thank God that we
[1:03:44] have a revelation of the word of God
[1:03:46] this morning that we have a truth that
[1:03:47] God has sent in this hour that is sunk
[1:03:50] down in the heart of the believer that
[1:03:51] we can approach God and righteousness uh
[1:03:54] be upon our life see the revealed truth
[1:03:56] of God's word is the beginning of
[1:03:58] righteousness that's what happened when
[1:03:59] the Seven Seals were open it was seven
[1:04:02] revealed truths that came to restore the
[1:04:05] church back to its former glory or to a
[1:04:08] place of righteousness you say well
[1:04:10] brother Matt why does it have to be
[1:04:11] righteousness well this is my message
[1:04:13] this morning because Paul says it like
[1:04:15] this in 1 Corinthians 6:9 he said know
[1:04:17] ye not that the unrighteous shall not
[1:04:20] inherit the kingdom of God so in order
[1:04:24] to inherit the Kingdom of God we must
[1:04:26] first be righteous but to have
[1:04:29] righteousness we must have it to inherit
[1:04:31] the kingdom and righteousness begins
[1:04:33] with revealed truth you see why
[1:04:35] Revelation is so important to the church
[1:04:37] I love this term inherit the Kingdom
[1:04:39] what a beautiful expression that it is
[1:04:41] to inherit the kingdom of God see
[1:04:43] because an inheritance is something that
[1:04:45] is given to you it's something that is
[1:04:47] passed down brother Joel this is what
[1:04:49] happened in Israel before when whenever
[1:04:51] Jesus came in his first coming this was
[1:04:53] one of the main things that Israel was
[1:04:55] searching for they were looking uh for
[1:04:58] the coming of a messiah the world had
[1:05:00] become completely alienated from God and
[1:05:02] they were they were they were expecting
[1:05:04] a messiah or the son of man to come and
[1:05:06] he would set the record straight he
[1:05:07] would make he would write all the wrongs
[1:05:09] in in in in in in Jewish history they
[1:05:12] would say it like this he would come and
[1:05:13] determine who was worthy to inherit the
[1:05:16] Kingdom so here this Messiah would come
[1:05:18] and here here of course Christ came and
[1:05:20] they never recognized that he was the
[1:05:22] one in that position they actually
[1:05:23] mocked him for speaking of the kingdom
[1:05:25] of God and how well if you're the king
[1:05:27] of the Jews well well well where's your
[1:05:29] you know well come down off the cross
[1:05:31] all these things that they that they
[1:05:32] mocked him with but you realize that
[1:05:34] this was what they were looking for is
[1:05:36] someone that would come to determine who
[1:05:38] would inherit the Kingdom now you notice
[1:05:40] that Jesus when he comes he actually
[1:05:42] uses this same language in Matthew 25
[1:05:44] even when he speaks of the second coming
[1:05:46] he said when the son of man shall come
[1:05:48] in his glory he'll put in his right
[1:05:50] he'll Gather in his right hand the Lambs
[1:05:51] in his left hand the goats he said then
[1:05:53] he'll turn to those that are in his
[1:05:55] right hand and he'll say unto them
[1:05:57] blessed are you are blessed to my father
[1:05:59] so Come Ye that are blessed to the
[1:06:01] father and inherit the Kingdom for
[1:06:03] prepared for you before the foundation
[1:06:05] of the world in Matthew 5 he said
[1:06:07] blessed are they that are persecuted for
[1:06:09] righteousness sake for theirs is the
[1:06:11] Kingdom of Heaven see to inherit the
[1:06:13] kingdom of God see an inheritance is
[1:06:15] something that is given it's not earned
[1:06:17] but Joe isn't that I just think that's a
[1:06:19] good thing because or it's such a
[1:06:20] powerful thought because here Jesus
[1:06:22] would emphasize this to inherit the
[1:06:24] kingdom of God brother brother Morgan
[1:06:26] what it what it tells us is that it
[1:06:28] emphasizes that the kingdom of God is a
[1:06:30] Divine gift it's not based on human
[1:06:33] achievement it's not based on what we
[1:06:35] can do but Jesus said but you can
[1:06:36] inherit it oh I think it's wonderful he
[1:06:38] didn't say well blessed are those that
[1:06:40] have earned their way into the kingdom
[1:06:42] of God or blessed are those that are
[1:06:44] worthy to be able to receive the kingdom
[1:06:46] of God he said but blessed are those
[1:06:48] that inherit the Kingdom see it's
[1:06:49] something to receive an inheritance it's
[1:06:51] something that is given to you it's a
[1:06:53] Divine gift of God but in order to
[1:06:55] receive receive an inheritance you have
[1:06:56] to first be an heir an heir is one that
[1:06:59] is entitled to receive or entitled
[1:07:02] entitled to inherit so so when you see
[1:07:04] Israel and you you study through their
[1:07:06] their history Israel in the natural they
[1:07:08] were the natural children of Abraham and
[1:07:09] so they were looking to in inherit this
[1:07:12] Kingdom they believed that the that that
[1:07:14] inheritance was theirs to take it they
[1:07:16] believed it belonged to them because of
[1:07:17] their natural birth after all it was
[1:07:19] Father Abraham and Isaac and Jacob which
[1:07:22] became Israel they they came through the
[1:07:24] the the the the the genealogy of Abraham
[1:07:27] and so of course it would have to be
[1:07:29] Israel that would inherit this great
[1:07:31] Kingdom but when Paul would come and he
[1:07:33] would preach he would say it like this
[1:07:34] he said Abraham believed God and it was
[1:07:36] counted unto him for righteousness he
[1:07:38] said but know therefore that they which
[1:07:40] are of the faith of Abraham the same are
[1:07:43] the children of Abraham see they and it
[1:07:46] shows us that they took the words that
[1:07:48] God spoke to Abraham and through all of
[1:07:50] the history of Israel they had
[1:07:52] misunderstood what God had said to
[1:07:54] Abraham remember what he said in Genesis
[1:07:56] 12 he said I will bless them that bless
[1:07:57] Thee I will curse them that curse thee
[1:08:00] and in the shall all the nations of the
[1:08:02] earth be blessed and until Paul preached
[1:08:04] it they believed that this natural uh
[1:08:06] lineage of Abraham and the law that they
[1:08:08] live by is what would bring the kingdom
[1:08:10] of God and it would it would it's what
[1:08:12] would bring an entrance it's what would
[1:08:13] bring the power of God upon the Earth
[1:08:15] and Israel would bless all nations and
[1:08:17] out of Israel would be this would be
[1:08:19] this great blessing upon the world it
[1:08:21] couldn't possibly be gentile people cuz
[1:08:23] after all they were heathens and dogs
[1:08:25] and but but it would have to be the
[1:08:27] Heirs of Abraham's seed but then when
[1:08:29] Paul would come and preach this is why
[1:08:31] this is why the Jews didn't like Paul is
[1:08:33] when Paul would come and preach he said
[1:08:35] but the scripture remember it was the
[1:08:37] angel of the Lord speaking through a
[1:08:38] Prophet by the name of Paul and bringing
[1:08:40] a revelation of what really was a CH a
[1:08:43] child of Abraham he said in the
[1:08:45] scripture for seeeing that God would
[1:08:47] justify the Heathen through faith
[1:08:49] preached before the gospel unto Abraham
[1:08:51] saying in thee shall all the nations of
[1:08:54] the earth be blessed so then they which
[1:08:56] are of the faith are blessed of faithful
[1:08:59] Abraham so in other words before God
[1:09:02] ever spoke these words to Abraham he saw
[1:09:05] that Faith Seed of Abraham in you and I
[1:09:08] now isn't that a wonderful thought to
[1:09:10] think about this morning that before God
[1:09:12] ever spoke to Abraham and said in thee
[1:09:14] shall all the nations of the earth be
[1:09:15] blessed Paul said but he looked down
[1:09:18] through time and because God is an
[1:09:20] eternal God he saw the faith Seed of
[1:09:22] Abraham in the gentile people in other
[1:09:24] words he looked down into this building
[1:09:26] this morning and he saw the faith seat
[1:09:28] of Abraham in Brother David Gat he saw
[1:09:30] the faith seat of Abraham in brother
[1:09:32] Joel he saw that Faith seed in brother
[1:09:35] Mark he saw the faith seed in sister
[1:09:37] Tammy and brother Charles he saw that
[1:09:38] Faith Seed of Abraham in each and every
[1:09:41] one of us and the he and the Bible said
[1:09:43] because he saw that then because God is
[1:09:46] an eternal God oh my if you could just
[1:09:47] see it this morning before he ever wrote
[1:09:49] it before he ever spoke to Abraham he
[1:09:51] saw that in you and then he spoke to
[1:09:54] Abraham and he said Abraham get thee out
[1:09:56] of thy country and away from thy Kindred
[1:09:58] and from thy father's house and go to a
[1:10:00] land that I will show you and I will
[1:10:02] make of thee a great nation and in thee
[1:10:05] and I will bless thee and make thy name
[1:10:07] great and that will be a blessing and I
[1:10:08] will bless him that blesses thee and I
[1:10:10] will curse him that curses thee and in
[1:10:13] thee shall all the families of the earth
[1:10:15] be blessed oh my isn't it something to
[1:10:17] think that when God would make a promise
[1:10:19] to Abraham he was talking about the Seed
[1:10:21] of Abraham which is you and I this
[1:10:23] morning that's our Eternal God oh I
[1:10:25] don't know about you it makes me feel
[1:10:27] good this morning to think that my God
[1:10:29] would see me and he would ride all the
[1:10:31] way back before anybody ever thought
[1:10:32] about me thousands of years before we
[1:10:34] would ever exist but because God saw you
[1:10:37] and the faith seed that was in your
[1:10:39] heart he would speak to Abraham and said
[1:10:41] in thee shall all the nations of the
[1:10:44] earth be blessed oh don't you realize
[1:10:46] that we stand today brother Mark as a
[1:10:48] faith seed of Our Father Abraham We
[1:10:50] Stand today as hes of the blessings of
[1:10:53] God we stand as HS of the promis of God
[1:10:55] we're HS of the kingdom of God and that
[1:10:58] blessing of God that is coming to the
[1:11:00] nations of the world how's it coming to
[1:11:02] the Nations it's coming through the
[1:11:04] faith Seed of Abraham what that's the
[1:11:06] only blessing that this world has on it
[1:11:08] is through the Bride of Jesus Christ you
[1:11:10] take the bride off of this world friends
[1:11:12] it ain't it'll be nothing but
[1:11:13] destruction you take the bride out of
[1:11:15] the world it'll come judgment it'll be
[1:11:17] destruction it'll be fire and brimstone
[1:11:19] that falls upon the world that's the
[1:11:21] only thing that's holding the wrath of
[1:11:23] God off of this Earth today is the
[1:11:25] presence of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:11:27] that possesses that Faith seed of Father
[1:11:30] Abraham there's coming a day when there
[1:11:33] won't be a building standing upon a
[1:11:34] building there's coming a day when God
[1:11:37] will unleash that six seal upon the
[1:11:39] Earth and destruction will strike the
[1:11:41] Earth and he'll let loose the wrath of
[1:11:42] God upon the Earth but the brother B
[1:11:44] said but you don't have to worry about
[1:11:45] it because the bride of Christ will be
[1:11:47] gone and the church may go through
[1:11:49] tribulation but the bride will be gone
[1:11:51] because his little wife will never go
[1:11:53] through that she's holding the the mercy
[1:11:55] of God over the
[1:11:57] Earth my the faith of God that's in you
[1:12:00] think about that little seed in you it's
[1:12:01] what's holding it it's the bride that is
[1:12:03] holding back the wrath of God and
[1:12:05] brother Mark as long as she's here
[1:12:07] there's still hope for a lost soul as
[1:12:09] long as she's here she's still crying
[1:12:12] for salvation as long as she's here
[1:12:14] she's still crying for Mercy but friends
[1:12:17] one day she'll be called away from this
[1:12:19] Earth to receive her inheritance and
[1:12:21] then judgment will strick the
[1:12:23] earth John Jesus said let not your heart
[1:12:27] be troubled for you believe in God
[1:12:29] believe also in me for in my father's
[1:12:32] house are many mansions if it were not
[1:12:34] so I would have told you but I go to
[1:12:36] prepare a place for you and if I go to
[1:12:38] prepare a place I will come again and
[1:12:40] receive you unto myself that where I am
[1:12:42] you may be also I know this scripture
[1:12:45] has been Lost in Translation I I I read
[1:12:47] all kinds of translations of it this
[1:12:49] week that in my father's house are many
[1:12:51] mansions one version of the Bible says
[1:12:53] in my father's apartment are many or in
[1:12:56] my father's complex there are many
[1:12:58] apartments all these different versions
[1:13:00] that people write but I love a true
[1:13:02] interpretation of the word see in my
[1:13:04] father's house are many mansions in
[1:13:06] other words in my father's kingdom are
[1:13:09] many
[1:13:10] palaces in my father's Kingdom he said
[1:13:13] here in our father's Kingdom there's
[1:13:14] many great palaces and but in the in the
[1:13:17] message future home he said Christ is
[1:13:20] there under the construction of this New
[1:13:22] Jerusalem he said now listen close don't
[1:13:24] move and don't miss this but Christ is
[1:13:27] in heaven today preparing that New
[1:13:30] Jerusalem my don't that make you want to
[1:13:32] shout just as God created the Earth in
[1:13:34] six days he made remember what the Bible
[1:13:37] says he said a day is a thousand years
[1:13:38] unto God and a thousand years as a day
[1:13:41] and just as he spent six days or 6,000
[1:13:43] years building the Earth he said there
[1:13:46] he is now building that New Jerusalem
[1:13:49] for the Bride of Jesus Christ I love how
[1:13:51] the prophet called him he said the one
[1:13:53] that is building it he is a Divine
[1:13:56] architect he's a Divine architect in
[1:13:58] other words he he is the one that is
[1:14:00] building it he is preparing it he's
[1:14:02] designed it and he designed it with his
[1:14:04] tender hands for his beloved bride you
[1:14:07] say well brother Matt what will it look
[1:14:08] like and how will it be can you imagine
[1:14:11] that this morning that Christ is there
[1:14:13] preparing that New Jerusalem here just
[1:14:16] as he created this world and as he spoke
[1:14:18] the world into existence and he created
[1:14:20] the earth and the atmosphere and the
[1:14:22] stars and the moon and all the the great
[1:14:24] things that God created that here Christ
[1:14:26] is standing today and creating that New
[1:14:28] Jerusalem that great City for you and I
[1:14:30] to inhabit I thought what a wonderful
[1:14:32] thought that it is that here a Divine
[1:14:34] architect is building this this place
[1:14:36] that we would inhabit said but what
[1:14:38] would it look like and how will it be
[1:14:39] well let me tell you brother Mark it'll
[1:14:41] be just the way you like it you say well
[1:14:44] how how is that because you know you
[1:14:45] think about an able man that gets
[1:14:47] married a man that was able if he when
[1:14:49] when he would get married if he has any
[1:14:50] sense about him he'll build a house for
[1:14:52] his bride the way she wants it to be see
[1:14:54] when you put the wrong color knobs on
[1:14:56] the cabinets she's going to come by and
[1:14:57] say I don't really like that color I
[1:14:59] like a different color and you know what
[1:15:01] the able man will do he'll go down to
[1:15:02] the hardware store and he'll pick out a
[1:15:05] the gold or or whatever's the end thing
[1:15:07] and he'll he'll put it in there and if
[1:15:08] she don't like if she don't like the
[1:15:10] black cabinets he'll go down the
[1:15:11] hardware store and he'll he'll get the
[1:15:13] white cabinets and if she don't you know
[1:15:14] she don't like that kind of carpet he'll
[1:15:16] he'll pick out a different kind of
[1:15:17] carpet because he's building a place to
[1:15:20] for her to inhabit because because he's
[1:15:22] able now I know some of us ain't able to
[1:15:24] do everything or our little brides want
[1:15:25] us to do but God is able you see and
[1:15:28] because he's an able husband brother
[1:15:29] marah he's preparing a place for you I
[1:15:32] love you know I love how brother BR said
[1:15:33] it he said he's designed this new city
[1:15:36] where he will live with his bride and
[1:15:38] he's designing it just to her touch the
[1:15:41] very thing that she would desire in her
[1:15:43] heart oh my to think that God he would
[1:15:46] build it and he he ain't just building
[1:15:47] it some way and say you just deal with
[1:15:49] it and you just like it and you'll just
[1:15:50] get over it he ain't that kind of a God
[1:15:52] he ain't that kind of a husband he said
[1:15:54] but he's building it just to her touch
[1:15:56] he's building this new city to the
[1:15:58] satisfaction oh God he's building it to
[1:16:00] the satisfaction of the Bride of Jesus
[1:16:02] Christ I don't know about you but it
[1:16:04] does something to my heart this morning
[1:16:05] to think that I have a god somewhere the
[1:16:08] husband man Jesus Christ that is
[1:16:10] building in this New Jerusalem a place
[1:16:12] that would satisfy my my my place of
[1:16:15] habitation if the every desire of our
[1:16:17] heart let me tell you friends that he
[1:16:18] ain't holding one thing back he'll get
[1:16:20] the finest of gold and the finest Jasper
[1:16:23] and the finest jewels and the finest
[1:16:25] things that he can put in it to build it
[1:16:27] that you would be able to inhabit it no
[1:16:29] longer you ain't going to get there and
[1:16:30] find a bunch of broke down shelves and a
[1:16:32] and a broke down house and and drafts
[1:16:34] coming through the window and gone are
[1:16:36] the days of of shingles falling off of
[1:16:37] her roof I'm talking about a Divine
[1:16:39] architect that will build to Perfection
[1:16:42] to satisfaction of the Bride of Jesus
[1:16:44] Christ just to her touch he said he's a
[1:16:46] Divine architect he's designed it for
[1:16:48] his beloved oh what a place it must be
[1:16:51] when a divine nature of a Divine
[1:16:54] architect has designed it for a Divine
[1:16:57] attribute that he's been divinely
[1:16:58] predestinated by a Divine God who is an
[1:17:01] author of a Divine lie what a city that
[1:17:04] will be my what it will look like this
[1:17:06] morning to think that here he's putting
[1:17:09] he's putting this together just for you
[1:17:11] and I I know many put make it hard to
[1:17:13] believe but Joel they put it off in a in
[1:17:15] in another world somewhere they put it A
[1:17:17] Million Miles Away fting out on some
[1:17:19] clouds but you realize that the Bible
[1:17:21] don't even teach that is't that the way
[1:17:23] the y'all just get with me just a minute
[1:17:24] but you know how the B the the whole
[1:17:26] church World we're going to go off in a
[1:17:27] cloud and be in heaven but you realize
[1:17:29] that the Bible don't even teach that
[1:17:30] you're going to go to heaven for
[1:17:31] eternity and spend all this time in
[1:17:33] heaven that's not what the Bible said
[1:17:34] I'll tell you what the Bible said in
[1:17:36] Revelations 21 John saw John said I saw
[1:17:38] a new Heaven and a new Earth and the
[1:17:41] first Heaven and the first Earth were
[1:17:42] passed away and then John said and I saw
[1:17:46] a holy city a New Jerusalem coming down
[1:17:49] from God out of Heaven prepared as a
[1:17:52] bride adorned for her husband he said
[1:17:55] see he saw it coming out of heaven so it
[1:17:57] ain't going to be in heaven it'll be on
[1:17:59] the earth he said I saw it coming out of
[1:18:02] the heaven and came down to the Earth
[1:18:04] and I heard with a great voice saying
[1:18:06] Out of Heaven behold the Tabernacle of
[1:18:08] God is with men and he will dwell with
[1:18:10] them and they shall be his people and
[1:18:12] God himself shall be with them and he
[1:18:14] will be their God and he will wipe away
[1:18:16] all the tears from their eyes and there
[1:18:18] shall be no more death neither sorrow
[1:18:21] nor crying neither there shall be any
[1:18:23] more pain for the former things are
[1:18:25] passed away so brother Jared we're not
[1:18:27] looking to spend eternity in heaven I'm
[1:18:29] looking to spend eternity on Earth it
[1:18:32] Ain and it ain't going to be this old
[1:18:33] this old Earth that's full of Filth and
[1:18:35] full of garbage it's in the but it'll be
[1:18:37] a new Earth cuz the old Earth will be
[1:18:39] passed away it'll be a redeemed Earth
[1:18:42] you you realize it's the Earth the one
[1:18:44] that God created you see you mean he'll
[1:18:46] throw it away and he'll make a new one
[1:18:47] no but what God will do with the Earth
[1:18:49] is the same thing he done with every one
[1:18:51] of us he'll redeem the Earth that he
[1:18:53] created in the beginning
[1:18:55] you realize that's what God does when
[1:18:56] God redeems you how did he do it by
[1:18:58] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:19:00] of the Holy Ghost it was it was God's
[1:19:02] that that's the way God redeems us it
[1:19:04] was by water remember we were baptized
[1:19:06] in water Sanctified by the blood of
[1:19:08] Jesus and then filled with the Holy
[1:19:10] Ghost to fire that's the same thing that
[1:19:12] took place on the earth in the days of
[1:19:14] Noah it went through a flood it was
[1:19:15] baptized in water when Jesus hung on the
[1:19:18] cross of Calvary the same blood that was
[1:19:20] shed for your sin it spilled upon the
[1:19:22] Earth and Sanctified it by the blood but
[1:19:24] then one day the Bible says there's
[1:19:25] coming a fire of God that will burn all
[1:19:28] the filth off of the earth it'll and
[1:19:29] then will come a new Heaven and a new
[1:19:31] Earth and upon that earth that is
[1:19:33] cleansed will come a city that was built
[1:19:36] by a Divine architect a New Jerusalem
[1:19:38] that will set down upon this Earth that
[1:19:40] the Bride of Jesus Christ will inhabit
[1:19:42] forever and ever Oh Glory I feel
[1:19:44] religious this morning to think that God
[1:19:47] a Divine architect is making a place for
[1:19:49] you and I oh friend isn't it wonderful
[1:19:51] to think that to be in Heavenly places
[1:19:53] with Christ but I'm marked to think that
[1:19:55] God would come down and dwell and dwell
[1:19:58] with man and build a city upon this
[1:20:00] earth oh I can't wait for the day I long
[1:20:02] to be there as John said I saw heaven I
[1:20:05] I open up and the City come down and set
[1:20:08] down upon this Earth I long to be there
[1:20:10] with our loved ones being in that city
[1:20:12] of God he said he ain't going to make a
[1:20:14] new world it's the one right here he'll
[1:20:16] just burn it off and cleanse it just
[1:20:18] like he did you the same Earth it'll be
[1:20:21] cleansed over just like he let me tell
[1:20:24] you friends God isn't looking for a new
[1:20:26] Earth he'll take the same one he created
[1:20:28] it and he'll cleanse it again and he'll
[1:20:30] use it for his glory and that's the way
[1:20:32] God does with every one of us God ain't
[1:20:34] looking for a new people he ain't
[1:20:36] looking for a better class he ain't
[1:20:38] looking for somebody that's more worthy
[1:20:39] he ain't looking for somebody that has
[1:20:41] less problems God don't throw people
[1:20:43] away he'll take he he he's a Potter and
[1:20:46] he'll take the clay and he'll mold it
[1:20:48] and he'll make it again God that's what
[1:20:50] people do people throw people away but
[1:20:52] God don't throw people away he ain't
[1:20:54] looking for better people that he can
[1:20:55] use he still wants to use you he ain't
[1:20:59] looking for somebody that's more
[1:21:00] qualified that he can use brother Mar
[1:21:02] but God uses us he said see he don't
[1:21:04] throw us away he ain't trying to get rid
[1:21:06] of us it's our God and he wants to use
[1:21:08] us remember when Jeremiah G I may as
[1:21:10] well just preach it I said it but
[1:21:11] remember when Jeremiah went down and he
[1:21:13] saw the destruction that was coming upon
[1:21:14] Israel and he went he saw that the
[1:21:16] Judgment of God was so great that he
[1:21:19] would didn't even want to be present
[1:21:20] when the Judgment came he said oh God
[1:21:22] let me go somewhere else I I don't even
[1:21:24] want to present what what great judgment
[1:21:26] God was going to bring the wrath of God
[1:21:28] upon this place oh God can you have
[1:21:30] mercy upon these people and God said
[1:21:32] Jeremiah go down to The Potter's House I
[1:21:35] have a message for you and he went down
[1:21:37] to the house of the Potter he said when
[1:21:39] I saw the Potter he said he had a lump
[1:21:41] of clay and when he made a vessel out of
[1:21:43] it it wasn't pleasing to the Potter he
[1:21:45] said so the the the vessel was marred in
[1:21:47] his hands he said then the Potter he
[1:21:50] took the ve the the clay and he mushed
[1:21:52] it back down again and he began to mold
[1:21:54] again and made another vessel that
[1:21:56] seemed good to the Potter to make it and
[1:21:59] the Lord spoke to him he said like the
[1:22:01] clay is in the hand of the Potter so are
[1:22:04] you in my hand see God don't throw you
[1:22:06] away he don't he he ain't throwing away
[1:22:08] his creation he's not throwing you away
[1:22:10] to get somebody better God wants you
[1:22:13] hello somebody God wants you you say
[1:22:16] full all my problems God Wants You full
[1:22:18] of all my mistakes God Wants You full of
[1:22:21] all my past God wants you I'm mared so
[1:22:23] was the so is the clay in the hand of
[1:22:26] the Potter he said but as the clay was
[1:22:28] in the hands of the Potter so are you in
[1:22:30] my hands he'll mold you and make you
[1:22:33] what he wants you to be but said he
[1:22:35] ain't going to raise up a new generation
[1:22:37] he'll redeem the one that's already here
[1:22:39] he ain't looking for a better Earth of
[1:22:40] better people he's looking to remake the
[1:22:43] one that's here he said if I go and
[1:22:45] prepare a place for you then I will come
[1:22:47] again and receive you unto myself that
[1:22:50] where I am there you may be also
[1:22:54] what a story this morning the Redeemer
[1:22:57] and the redeemed back together again
[1:22:59] what a love story this is that he would
[1:23:02] go it's what the Song of Solomon was
[1:23:05] writing about remember Solomon he saw
[1:23:07] one that was fair all all those that
[1:23:10] that he could have as a as this great
[1:23:11] king but he saw one that was fair and
[1:23:14] remember when he wrote about her he said
[1:23:15] I am my beloved and my beloved is mine
[1:23:18] oh you are so beautiful oh my love turn
[1:23:21] away thine eyes from me for your eyes
[1:23:23] have overcame me me he was so he was so
[1:23:26] in love and and how that he would look
[1:23:28] at her and long and and all the all the
[1:23:30] song that he wrote about her how how
[1:23:31] fair your hair and all in your skin and
[1:23:34] your eyes and every everything about you
[1:23:36] he wrote how much he loved her and how
[1:23:38] how how wonderful that she was and and
[1:23:40] how love what a love story it is but
[1:23:43] said what was it it was the way that
[1:23:44] Christ looks at the bride here he adores
[1:23:47] you he gives life for but you realize
[1:23:49] that whenever Solomon was longing for
[1:23:51] her here she was she was already she was
[1:23:54] she was engaged or or or or or or to be
[1:23:57] with with with the shepherd boy remember
[1:23:59] Solon looked at him he said but but but
[1:24:01] he desired her and here she was already
[1:24:03] spoken for he said see that's the way it
[1:24:05] was that's the way it was when whenever
[1:24:07] whenever Satan came and he and he had
[1:24:09] you and he had and he had you in his
[1:24:10] grasp but whenever Christ looked at you
[1:24:13] he longed for you and he had a desire
[1:24:14] for you and he wanted to make a way that
[1:24:17] that that that old husband that that old
[1:24:19] one couldn't have no part of you but he
[1:24:20] wanted to make a way he said what was
[1:24:22] happening he said that Solomon he he
[1:24:24] said here he was called to inherit the
[1:24:26] kingdom of David or Kingdom of Israel
[1:24:28] but he couldn't inherit it while that
[1:24:30] David was on the throne and so that
[1:24:32] Kingdom had to pass away in order for
[1:24:34] Solomon to come into His Place said see
[1:24:36] and that's what Christ was waiting for
[1:24:38] you see he was waiting for the time that
[1:24:40] he could come and take his bride and
[1:24:42] could catch her away that she wouldn't
[1:24:44] be wouldn't be tormented by that that by
[1:24:46] the old devil and he wouldn't be pulled
[1:24:48] by the devil again but but he but he
[1:24:50] would look at her and he would long for
[1:24:52] her and he loved you don't you realize
[1:24:53] that's a relationship ship that God has
[1:24:55] with you that he loves you and he and he
[1:24:57] adores you and he Lo he loves to to have
[1:25:00] communion with you he he loves to have
[1:25:02] fellowship with you this morning that's
[1:25:03] the desire that God he loves you so much
[1:25:05] that he gave his life for you he adores
[1:25:08] you and you know what she adors him she
[1:25:11] Ador him when she looks at him that's
[1:25:13] what worship is she looks at him and she
[1:25:17] loves him back brother Mark it's an act
[1:25:18] of worship that's what we do when we
[1:25:20] come to church and we worship God you
[1:25:22] realize worship is is a reverence or an
[1:25:25] adoration it's a it's a way to it's an
[1:25:27] act of love that you have with God it's
[1:25:30] the way that you love God so when we
[1:25:31] come to church to worship God we worship
[1:25:34] him because we love him don't you see it
[1:25:37] it's not it's not because somebody tells
[1:25:38] you to to worship and somebody tells you
[1:25:40] to to come to church we worship because
[1:25:42] we love him do you realize that God
[1:25:44] being a god of love he don't command
[1:25:46] anybody to worship him he ain't coming
[1:25:48] here to demand you and make you worship
[1:25:51] and make you come to church that's what
[1:25:52] men do that God don't do that he ain't
[1:25:54] commanding you to worship what good
[1:25:56] would worship be if it had to be
[1:25:57] commanded out of you I may as well
[1:25:59] preach it he don't he don't command you
[1:26:02] to live for him he but he instructs Us
[1:26:04] in his word and if you have a desire in
[1:26:06] your nature to worship God then you will
[1:26:08] worship God because he instruct us to do
[1:26:10] it in his word God loves worship but he
[1:26:13] don't love making you do it he loves it
[1:26:15] whenever we we lift our hands he loves
[1:26:17] it when we praise God he loves it when
[1:26:19] you sing songs he loves it when you sing
[1:26:21] that song I love him because he first
[1:26:23] loved me but he ain't going to make you
[1:26:24] do it he wants you to do it from your
[1:26:26] heart God wants you to have a desire to
[1:26:28] worship God he wants to he wants to love
[1:26:31] you so much that you loving back he
[1:26:33] wants to give you so much that you want
[1:26:34] to give back he wants to feel you so
[1:26:36] much that you want to just give all that
[1:26:38] you have unto him he wants you to adore
[1:26:41] him and to love him and to rever him God
[1:26:43] wants you to worship Him in truth and in
[1:26:47] spirit said he don't demand it God ain't
[1:26:50] that way he don't demand it and say
[1:26:51] worship me or else serve me or else live
[1:26:54] for me or else sanctify or else that
[1:26:57] ain't the kind of God that we serve God
[1:26:59] don't demand it and that ain't our place
[1:27:01] as ministers think about as a pastor
[1:27:03] it's not my place to demand that you
[1:27:05] worship God it ain't my place to demand
[1:27:08] that you live right and demand that you
[1:27:09] live in holess and demand that you don't
[1:27:11] go out cutting your hair and wearing and
[1:27:13] jeans and all these things and men
[1:27:15] dressing like women and women dressing
[1:27:17] like men and and people making up like
[1:27:19] Jezebel like women do today or men do
[1:27:21] today but it ain't but but it ain't my
[1:27:23] place to demand that you live a life of
[1:27:25] Holiness but I come to preach the Gospel
[1:27:27] of Jesus Christ this is what Paul
[1:27:30] preached he said I beseech you Brethren
[1:27:32] I say let's preach it like Paul did he
[1:27:34] said I beseech you Brethren by the mercy
[1:27:36] of God present your body a Living
[1:27:38] Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God
[1:27:41] it is your reasonable
[1:27:42] service beseech it means to call or to
[1:27:45] summon or to encourage or to instruct or
[1:27:48] to teach so Paul said I beseech you in
[1:27:51] other words I'll instruct you in the
[1:27:53] ways of God I come to teach you the ways
[1:27:55] of God I come to encourage you to go to
[1:27:58] church I come to encourage you to
[1:28:00] worship God I come to encourage you to
[1:28:02] be a part of assembly and come and give
[1:28:04] your time and sacrifice to God and
[1:28:06] worship him but nobody demands it of you
[1:28:09] and when you come to church nobody
[1:28:11] demands that you worship God but let me
[1:28:13] tell you what you will see is whenever
[1:28:15] any time that I have the ability and the
[1:28:17] church doors are open you'll find me in
[1:28:19] the house of God because I love him I
[1:28:22] adore him I want to worship Him why
[1:28:24] because he first loved me I want to give
[1:28:26] all that I have unto him because he gave
[1:28:28] all that he had to me I love him I adore
[1:28:31] him I want to worship him so when I come
[1:28:33] to church I nobody had to make me
[1:28:35] worship God but I worship God you'll
[1:28:37] find me worshiping my maker my Creator
[1:28:40] the god that loves me my Christ the
[1:28:42] Divine architect that is creating a
[1:28:44] place that we can live together
[1:28:46] eternally I worship him because I love
[1:28:49] him he don't make you do it he just
[1:28:52] encourages you instruct you in the word
[1:28:54] of God but Mark that there'd be a desire
[1:28:56] in our heart isn't that the way God sees
[1:28:58] it to instruct you that there would be a
[1:29:01] desire in your heart to want to serve
[1:29:03] him can you imagine having a wife that
[1:29:06] you had to force to be a wife what a
[1:29:09] miserable marriage it would be you had
[1:29:12] to force to be a wife Force to to do and
[1:29:15] force you know what what a misery it
[1:29:16] would be but when you can serve one
[1:29:19] another because you love one another
[1:29:21] might a need a better relationship
[1:29:23] that's what God's looking for he said
[1:29:25] I'll love her first he didn't even wait
[1:29:28] on you to make the first move he said
[1:29:30] I'll love her first then she'll love me
[1:29:33] back I'll give her everything I have
[1:29:36] that's how you win her heart I'll just
[1:29:38] give her everything I have I'll go out
[1:29:39] on a limb I'll be embarrassed I I'll be
[1:29:42] the Laughing stalk if I have to be but I
[1:29:45] want her to know that I love her that's
[1:29:47] what Christ done he went and he took the
[1:29:49] bore the reproach of our sin remember
[1:29:52] when they they threw the the Harlot at
[1:29:54] at his feet that day that little ill
[1:29:55] Fame woman that was caught in the act
[1:29:57] and they brought and threw her down at
[1:29:59] his feet he bore the reproach and said
[1:30:01] there ain't no when when when they all
[1:30:03] left he said your accusers are gone and
[1:30:04] neither do I accuse thee go and sin no
[1:30:07] more he B bore the reproach when he was
[1:30:09] sitting in in in the in the the rich
[1:30:11] man's house and they they failed to wash
[1:30:13] his feet and here that little woman came
[1:30:15] down and and she knelt down at his feet
[1:30:17] and she begin to wash his feet and wipe
[1:30:19] them with her hair and here they say you
[1:30:21] know that woman's an ill- Fame woman how
[1:30:23] could you sit there in the presence of a
[1:30:25] woman like that but but but but but he
[1:30:27] bore the reproach of her he said because
[1:30:29] I came into this house and nobody would
[1:30:31] wash my feet but she was willing to wash
[1:30:33] them he bore our reproach he bore our
[1:30:36] our ill- famed and he bore our our sins
[1:30:39] and our our wrongdoings and our mistakes
[1:30:41] that we could take on the name of Jesus
[1:30:43] Christ that we could call oursel a
[1:30:45] Christian and the critic and the
[1:30:46] persecutor would come by and say why you
[1:30:48] ain't no such a thing but he bore our
[1:30:50] reproach that we could take on his name
[1:30:53] the reproach of our sin that we wouldn't
[1:30:55] even have to pay for it isn't that a God
[1:30:57] no wonder we worship God no wonder we
[1:31:00] adore him we love him because he first
[1:31:03] love us he don't make us do it brother
[1:31:05] Mark he don't force force us to worship
[1:31:08] him but when we come to we come to the
[1:31:10] house of God we come to worship God I'm
[1:31:12] going to be here and I'm going to
[1:31:14] worship him because I love him you know
[1:31:16] why because there's something in me that
[1:31:19] desires to offer a spiritual sacrifice
[1:31:21] unto God you realize that the old
[1:31:24] Testament it was the priesthood that
[1:31:25] offered sacrifices and had they' go out
[1:31:28] and they would be a Sanctified priest
[1:31:29] and they would lay down upon the Altar
[1:31:31] and they would sanctify the altar they
[1:31:32] would offer sacrifices unto him but then
[1:31:35] the prophet would say but there's coming
[1:31:37] a day remember when he prophesied
[1:31:38] there's coming a day there there will be
[1:31:40] another priesthood a priest that will
[1:31:42] come after the order of MDC and then
[1:31:44] then when this priest would come he
[1:31:46] would usher in a new priesthood brother
[1:31:49] the Jared in other words here he would
[1:31:50] come it would be an eternal priesthood
[1:31:52] he would be after the order of MEC he
[1:31:54] have no beginning of days and no no
[1:31:56] ending of nights remember when he came
[1:31:57] to Abraham after after the after the
[1:31:59] battle and it was mecdc that came unto
[1:32:01] him and he feasted with him and had had
[1:32:03] fellowship and had communion with him
[1:32:05] and the Bible said he he had no
[1:32:06] beginning days had no father and no
[1:32:08] mother it was none other than God
[1:32:09] himself in human flesh said but there
[1:32:11] cometh a priest in the end time or there
[1:32:14] cometh a priest that will come after the
[1:32:15] order of mezc and here when Christ came
[1:32:18] brother Mark he came as a high priest
[1:32:20] the Bible said he could even be touched
[1:32:22] by the feeling of our infirmities but
[1:32:23] after him not only did he come as a
[1:32:25] priest but he ushered in a new
[1:32:27] priesthood that every one of us that
[1:32:29] would come under or come into Christ
[1:32:31] would be a part of that priesthood this
[1:32:33] morning so here we are a royal
[1:32:35] priesthood Paul the Bible said you're
[1:32:37] Kings and you're priests unto God we're
[1:32:39] priests unto him and able to make
[1:32:41] sacrifices unto God a priest after the
[1:32:44] order of mecdc we're an eternal
[1:32:46] priesthood oh my is it something to be
[1:32:47] in that order this morning we come after
[1:32:49] the order of an eternal priesthood and
[1:32:52] we're sitting in the house of God and
[1:32:54] and giving worship unto him as a priest
[1:32:56] ought to see it's a a real priesthood it
[1:32:58] always acts the same way remember when
[1:33:00] he was here on Earth notice how he done
[1:33:02] and that you say well all the things
[1:33:04] that he done he'll do the same thing
[1:33:05] today if it's the same priesthood but
[1:33:07] remember said if he's the same high
[1:33:09] priest he'll act the same way today he
[1:33:11] said but he don't have he can't come
[1:33:12] here in his Corporal body on Earth but
[1:33:15] he's only here in his bride and he works
[1:33:17] through that it is man it was God in
[1:33:20] Elijah it was God in David it was God in
[1:33:23] Christ and now it's God in his body upon
[1:33:26] the Earth you say what is it it's that
[1:33:28] same royal priesthood on the Earth today
[1:33:31] he said well you said well brother M
[1:33:33] that was just a prophet that he would
[1:33:34] come but brother manam said this he said
[1:33:36] no matter how much he would anoint me
[1:33:38] he's got to anoint you too see so God
[1:33:41] would call an anointed people he
[1:33:43] anointed a five-fold Ministry to preach
[1:33:45] the gospel but he anointed a people to
[1:33:47] believe it and it takes those that are
[1:33:49] anointed in order to be Believers you
[1:33:52] had to be anointed to believe God God
[1:33:54] anointing to be able to serve God and to
[1:33:56] worship God it takes an anointing of God
[1:33:59] he say see so he would have to anoint me
[1:34:01] but he's got to anoint you too I don't
[1:34:02] know about you but I thank God that I
[1:34:04] can be a part of an anointed people of
[1:34:06] God you've anointed blessed are your
[1:34:08] ears for they hear blessed are your eyes
[1:34:10] for they see we be been Anointed with
[1:34:12] isav in this hour that we could see the
[1:34:15] things of God and the ways of God and
[1:34:17] the desires of God and the true
[1:34:18] sacrifice and worship unto God to
[1:34:21] inherit the kingdom of God
[1:34:24] said he come to give it to you in the
[1:34:27] days of his Earthly Ministry when Jesus
[1:34:29] came I'm I'm I'm going close just a
[1:34:32] minute but when Jesus came you realize
[1:34:34] that there was many unbelievers in his
[1:34:36] presence brother Morgan remember
[1:34:38] whenever he came the Bible said he was
[1:34:40] so astonished at their unbelief that he
[1:34:44] walked away and he left them at their
[1:34:47] unbelief remember when he went to
[1:34:49] capernium he said capernium you've got
[1:34:51] so much unbelief the things that Jes
[1:34:53] Jesus could have done in their midst but
[1:34:56] couldn't do because of their unbelief
[1:34:58] a't that the way it is today you say
[1:35:00] brother man I want to see a move of God
[1:35:02] believe it I want to see a Revival
[1:35:05] believe it I want to see healing for my
[1:35:07] brother my sister believe it said many
[1:35:09] things he could not do because of their
[1:35:11] unbelief see that's why the world has
[1:35:13] taken this this priesthood and said Well
[1:35:15] it has to be a thing of the past because
[1:35:17] the same work isn't done in our assembly
[1:35:19] he said but if if it's a priesthood
[1:35:21] before and he done that kind of a work
[1:35:23] work if it's the same priesthood he'll
[1:35:25] still do the same kind of work today but
[1:35:28] the difference is is our
[1:35:31] unbelief so we come as a body of
[1:35:33] Believers this morning he said he left
[1:35:35] them left capernium because they
[1:35:37] unbelief can you imagine they could have
[1:35:38] been healed but because their unbelief
[1:35:41] they could have been they could have
[1:35:42] received the Holy Ghost but because of
[1:35:43] their unbelief they could be saved but
[1:35:45] because their unbelief they could have
[1:35:46] seen a move of God but because their
[1:35:48] unbelief they could have gone years
[1:35:50] without living in depression but because
[1:35:51] of their unbelief my friends I've got
[1:35:53] got news for you this morning this ain't
[1:35:55] capernium
[1:35:57] Hallelujah this ain't capernium but a
[1:35:59] Mark it's a body of Believers we're not
[1:36:01] capernium he don't have to walk out of
[1:36:03] our midst astonished and saying I could
[1:36:05] have done a work in their midst but
[1:36:07] because of their unbelief I couldn't I
[1:36:09] couldn't do anything but I thank God
[1:36:11] that it ain't capernium this morning but
[1:36:13] we're a body of Believers and we believe
[1:36:15] in the Supernatural and we believe in
[1:36:17] the power of God we believe in Divine
[1:36:19] Healing I believe in the work of God I
[1:36:22] believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:24] we believe in spiritual worship we
[1:36:26] believe it that it ain't in vain but I
[1:36:28] believe what the Bible said when when
[1:36:30] David wrote he said Oh Holy One you are
[1:36:33] they you are he that inhabits the
[1:36:35] Praises of Israel I thank God that we
[1:36:37] are a body of Believers that believe
[1:36:39] that God inhabits the Praises of his
[1:36:41] people he will dwell amongst them he
[1:36:44] will dwell in them the temple that God
[1:36:47] has made in this hour and they will
[1:36:50] inherit the kingdom of God oh he said I
[1:36:53] will declare my name thy name unto my
[1:36:56] brethren in the midst of the
[1:36:58] congregation will I praise thee you that
[1:37:01] fear the Lord praise him all ye the seed
[1:37:04] of Jacob glorify him fear Him all ye
[1:37:06] seed of Israel for he hath not despised
[1:37:09] or abhor the Affliction of The Afflicted
[1:37:12] neither has he hid his face from him but
[1:37:14] when We Cried unto him he
[1:37:17] heard no wonder we adore him we worship
[1:37:21] Him brother Mark we come to the house of
[1:37:23] God we come to receive our inheritance
[1:37:26] we don't come we never we never come
[1:37:28] brother Morgan just to to take up a time
[1:37:30] or another service but we come to
[1:37:32] receive our inheritance from God say see
[1:37:34] he's bringing this great Kingdom he'll
[1:37:36] set it down upon the Earth said but even
[1:37:38] now we're in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:37:41] Jesus how many can say Amen as you stand
[1:37:44] to your feet this morning I'm going to
[1:37:45] let you go early but we come to worship
[1:37:48] God we come to adore him we come to love
[1:37:52] him we Revere we we rever him because he
[1:37:55] first loved us there's such a reverence
[1:37:57] in our
[1:37:58] heart we approach him that way you
[1:38:01] realize when we come in the house of God
[1:38:04] we don't it ain't no games to us we
[1:38:07] don't play around in the sanctuary and
[1:38:09] talk to one another and goof off and eat
[1:38:12] candy and chew gum and all those things
[1:38:15] we talk on the cell phones we don't we
[1:38:16] don't do that in the house of God we
[1:38:18] have reverence for the house of God why
[1:38:21] because we reverence him isn't it
[1:38:23] something you can go to a
[1:38:25] courtroom it's sad to say but a
[1:38:27] courtroom has more reverence than most
[1:38:30] churches in this world
[1:38:32] today the laws of men has more reverence
[1:38:35] they got rules on the door when you come
[1:38:37] in here take your hat off turn your cell
[1:38:39] phone off don't bring no food don't be
[1:38:41] chewing bubblegum we're coming in here
[1:38:43] to hear the Judgment of the of the
[1:38:46] judge but then we come in the house of
[1:38:48] God and have no reverence for the spirit
[1:38:51] of God or the house of God but God
[1:38:54] called us this is the teaching of the
[1:38:55] word come with reverence we come to
[1:38:58] adore him we don't come to walking with
[1:39:02] hobnail shoes Where Angels Fear to trod
[1:39:05] but we come with
[1:39:07] reverence I always thought it was a
[1:39:09] paradox of how a Believer was called to
[1:39:12] approach
[1:39:13] God the Bible says in one place this as
[1:39:16] we approach the throne of Mercy with
[1:39:18] reverence we come but then in another
[1:39:20] place it says we approach him with
[1:39:22] boldness
[1:39:23] isn't that something that you could have
[1:39:25] reverence and boldness at the same time
[1:39:28] it's because the boldness isn't Pride
[1:39:31] the boldness is that I have confidence
[1:39:34] in the sacrifice that has gone before me
[1:39:37] I have confidence in the in the way that
[1:39:39] is paid in the entrance that has been
[1:39:41] made into the Kingdom so whenever I come
[1:39:43] in I I can come in boldly but with
[1:39:46] reverence in other words I come in with
[1:39:48] reverence but I know I belong here I
[1:39:50] know I've got my place at the Throne of
[1:39:53] God I know I have my place in the
[1:39:54] kingdom of God and God has called us but
[1:39:58] Mark is calling us in this
[1:40:00] hour to take a hold of our
[1:40:03] inheritance you realize that this world
[1:40:06] has a lot to
[1:40:07] offer if you have a rich daddy and he
[1:40:11] pass away and leave you an inheritance
[1:40:13] say well I'm waiting to receive my
[1:40:15] inheritance it's got a lot to it's got a
[1:40:17] lot to offer Satan would offer you all
[1:40:20] kinds of things that's what he did with
[1:40:22] Jesus when he took him up on a mountain
[1:40:24] he said I'll give you all the kingdoms
[1:40:26] of this world if you'll just Bow Down
[1:40:28] and Worship me but Jesus didn't fall for
[1:40:30] it and Friends neither will you why
[1:40:34] because you're anointed to believe say s
[1:40:36] you can offer what you want but I but I
[1:40:39] don't accept it I got another
[1:40:42] inheritance that I come to receive how
[1:40:45] many would receive it this morning w't
[1:40:47] you lift your hands as we bow our heads
[1:40:48] gracious Heavenly
[1:40:50] Father Lord what an offer that you've
[1:40:52] given unto to

[1:41:07] mistakes Lord that we

[1:41:21] earn Lord that we could never be worth
