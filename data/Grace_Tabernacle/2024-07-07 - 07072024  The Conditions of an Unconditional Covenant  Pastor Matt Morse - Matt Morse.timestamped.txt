[43:12] something from the Lord and amen to draw
[43:15] strength from the word of God Amen how
[43:17] many come to do that maybe you've been
[43:19] weak in your spirit let me tell you a
[43:20] secret the way to get strength is
[43:22] through God's word I believe that I
[43:24] believe that through the preaching of
[43:25] the word God has a source for you to
[43:27] draw strength from you may have been you
[43:29] may have been down you may have been
[43:31] having some pressures and things in your
[43:33] life that's been going on but I believe
[43:34] that we can draw strength by the
[43:36] preaching of the word of God it
[43:38] strengthens us the Bible says it edifies
[43:40] us it encourages us it it establishes us
[43:43] it allows us brother marah to be able to
[43:45] find out our purpose is and I know
[43:47] everybody's worried about the people
[43:48] that's sick in their body but brother
[43:50] said the sickest body in this world is
[43:52] that so-called body of Jesus Christ and
[43:54] the only way to help it is the bomb that
[43:57] God sent which is the word of God and I
[43:59] believe when it's preached it's enough
[44:01] bomb that it'll take all the pressures
[44:03] and trials and things that we face and
[44:05] brother Mark that's what we want to see
[44:07] full and standing to its full height
[44:08] this morning is the body of Jesus Christ
[44:11] let her stand let her stand and be in
[44:14] full strength let her let her be in
[44:15] couraged this morning let her rise to a
[44:18] place that God has called us to that's
[44:20] why we come to preach the word of God
[44:22] Amen to give strength to the Church of
[44:24] the Living God Amen how many say Amen to
[44:26] that how many come to draw strength how
[44:29] many come how many preach with me this
[44:30] morning amen we didn't just come to hear
[44:32] a man we come to hear the word of God
[44:35] and I believe God's word he said there's
[44:36] a gift laying there and the people have
[44:38] the right to be able to pull from that
[44:40] gift of whatever they have need of if
[44:42] you need healing in your body you got a
[44:44] right as a Believer to draw healing out
[44:46] of this service if you need the Lord to
[44:48] come and and speak to you or answer a
[44:49] question that you have in your mind you
[44:51] realize that you have the authority as a
[44:53] Believer to draw that out of this
[44:55] service that the angel of the Lord could
[44:58] come down in this service and meet your
[45:00] very need the things that have been
[45:02] going on for years that you've been
[45:03] looking for God to answer that's the
[45:05] kind of God I serve at least that's how
[45:07] I believe it anybody believe it with me
[45:08] this morning amen won't you give the
[45:10] Lord another hand clap of Praise say
[45:12] he's a mighty God wonderful song brother
[45:15] West when mercy walked in amen you love

[45:37] make trips and different things and uh
[45:40] just another opportunity to be
[45:42] encouragement to them and I believe it's
[45:44] very important I can't think of any
[45:45] other cause that's more worthy any
[45:47] missionary work that's more worthy than
[45:49] our own children amen so I appreciate
[45:51] the efforts and and the work that

[46:15] able to come in expectation because you
[46:17] know the Lord's going to do something
[46:18] that's the way I feel every time I walk
[46:20] in the doors I just believe that God is
[46:22] going to do something Supernatural I
[46:24] believe that the dead will be raised the
[46:25] sick will be healed the the the dumb
[46:27] will be able to speak the blind will be
[46:28] able to see and the lame will be able to
[46:30] walk that's how I believe this gospel I

[48:41] allow us to go through another week on

[48:59] you perfect in every good work to do his
[49:02] will working in you that which is well
[49:04] pleasing in his sight through Jesus
[49:06] Christ to whom be glory forever and ever
[49:11] amen now we also want to read out of
[49:13] Genesis the 12th chapter and we'll read
[49:15] from the first
[49:17] verse Genesis 12 and the first verse
[49:20] down through the fifth
[49:23] verse Bible says now the Lord had said
[49:25] unto Abram get thee out of thy country
[49:27] and from thy Kindred and from thy
[49:29] Father's House unto a land that I will
[49:31] show thee and I will make of thee a
[49:34] great nation and I will bless thee and I
[49:37] will make thy name great and thou shalt
[49:38] be a blessing and I will bless them that
[49:41] bless Thee I will curse them that
[49:42] curseth thee and in thee shall all the
[49:44] families of the earth be blessed so
[49:46] Abram departed as the Lord had spoken
[49:48] unto him and lot went with him and Abram
[49:51] and and was and was 75 years old when he
[49:54] departed out of Heron and Abram took
[49:57] Sarah his wife and lot his brother's son
[49:59] and all their substance that they had
[50:01] gathered and the souls that they had
[50:02] gotten in haon and they went forth to go
[50:05] into the land of Canaan and into the
[50:07] land of Canaan they came and we'll just
[50:10] ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the
[50:12] reading of the word this morning as you
[50:14] as you take your seats just to rest a
[50:16] few moments as we want to speak to you
[50:19] this morning on the conditions of an
[50:22] unconditional Covenant the conditions of
[50:24] an unconditional Covenant amen I just
[50:27] want to take a few moments I really
[50:29] believe this morning that that the only
[50:31] thing that we have Brother David to be
[50:33] able to give us strength is this word
[50:35] amen you believe that that God is able
[50:37] to take something isn't it just
[50:38] something that you can just take a
[50:39] little story sometimes and and the Lord
[50:42] can just uh re reveal some things to
[50:44] your heart and it just changes
[50:45] everything that you've been going
[50:47] through but I want to take a few minutes
[50:49] this morning as of course we read the
[50:51] scripture of Abraham and and and as the
[50:54] the you know the story begins many of
[50:56] you very familiar with the life of
[50:58] Abraham and how that God had started him
[51:00] but I want to take as as God uh began to
[51:03] give a covenant and how that Covenant
[51:05] came into effect uh in into Abraham and
[51:08] of course we recognize that as Believers
[51:10] today as the great Covenant it was the
[51:13] it was the greatest Covenant that God
[51:15] has ever given it was something that uh
[51:17] that would that would be something that
[51:18] we would be able to partake of today and
[51:21] of course we see as we open our our
[51:23] scripture we find that the Bible says
[51:25] that here Abram was a man that was
[51:27] called of God and here of course he was
[51:30] uh the Bible would tell us he was a a
[51:32] man 75 years old and and of course he
[51:35] was he was a righteous man he was a man
[51:37] that may not have been born to great
[51:39] wealth brother Mark he may not had a a
[51:41] whole lot of money he may have not have
[51:43] been of great Fame he he he was in a he
[51:45] was in an area that the Bible would tell
[51:47] us and that that had turned their back
[51:49] on God he was in a a place that had had
[51:53] gone astray from what the the
[51:55] fundamental beliefs of
[51:57] of of what God had had taught his
[51:58] children but uh in the middle of all of
[52:01] that here was a man by the name of Abram
[52:03] and and you know I think something about
[52:05] Abram he may not been a well-known man
[52:07] brother Wesley he may not have been the
[52:08] most popular he may not have been a
[52:10] great man he may not have been a great
[52:12] uh a speaker or had some great pull pit
[52:14] or some great thing he wasn't on all the
[52:16] television shows or nothing like that
[52:18] and but he but but What mattered was it
[52:20] didn't matter that everybody else didn't
[52:21] know who he was What mattered is God
[52:23] knew who he was and he was a man that
[52:25] had a relationship ship with God and
[52:27] I'll just lay that in there this morning
[52:28] before we get started what matters is
[52:30] that you know God and more importantly
[52:32] that God knows you if God knows you
[52:35] you're going to get through some stuff
[52:36] and brother Mark he he was he was a man
[52:38] that that would look around and maybe he
[52:40] would watch as God would would would
[52:42] would you know it just seemed like
[52:43] everybody else received great blessings
[52:45] and everybody else that they were they
[52:46] were prospering in their life and still
[52:48] yet he didn't have a whole lot just a
[52:50] little family and a little little flock
[52:52] and a little uh group of of people there
[52:54] that he had that he had sold he had
[52:56] taken and and but you know just seemed
[52:58] maybe he wasn't the greatest one of all
[53:00] but but you know what Abraham I believe
[53:02] that Abraham was a man that never
[53:04] complained about what God had given him
[53:05] he was a man that he was so content with
[53:08] God he he just loved the Lord he was a
[53:10] righteous man and he was just God didn't
[53:13] it wasn't just every now and then he was
[53:15] a man that that that just dedicated his
[53:17] life to serving God and he believed God
[53:19] and and and and and you know he lived a
[53:20] life brother Mark that that for 75 years
[53:23] there's nothing written about it there
[53:24] ain't no there you know couldn't been no
[53:26] great things or nothing recorded of
[53:28] great eventful things that happened but
[53:30] but one day everything changed in
[53:33] Abraham's life one day the Bible says
[53:35] that here that God had called him and
[53:37] when God called him brother Jared God
[53:39] called him to take action he come he
[53:41] come down to Abram and and he began to
[53:43] speak to him and he told him to get out
[53:45] of your country and get away from your
[53:47] Kindred and away from this place and I
[53:49] want you to go into a lamb that I'll
[53:50] show you and I'm going to make of you a
[53:52] great nation and and you notice what God
[53:55] as God came and he and he gave gave him
[53:56] a promise but in order to possess the
[53:59] promise that God gave him brother Wesley
[54:01] that he that God had to call him to
[54:03] separate from all the things that he had
[54:05] already been a part of and you know what
[54:07] you know when he when he left brother
[54:08] Mark he left his brother and he he left
[54:11] nahor and milka and and all all all this
[54:13] family and he went out into the
[54:15] Wilderness and it wasn't long that he
[54:17] got out there in the wilderness here he
[54:18] took lot his brother's son and and when
[54:20] they got out in the wilderness lot
[54:22] looked out and he saw Sodom and he
[54:24] desired what was in Sodom and Abraham he
[54:26] allowed him to go up there and he just
[54:28] took the little planes and and brother
[54:30] brma say it like this he said he just
[54:31] separated from everything he he was just
[54:34] a man that he totally separated from all
[54:36] things I thought isn't that the way it
[54:38] is that when God gives you a promise
[54:40] what God in order for you to receive a
[54:42] promise God requires you to separate
[54:45] from some things you see so so Abraham
[54:47] he separated he went he went out and he
[54:49] took the way with the Lord's despise few
[54:51] and and and you know what he said that
[54:53] ought to be our attitude this morning is
[54:55] to take the way with God people
[54:57] regardless of whether it's hard or easy
[54:59] how many say Amen to that we ought to
[55:01] take the way with God's people we ought
[55:02] to be ready to go at any time wherever
[55:04] that God may call you friends it's God
[55:07] that is calling you let me tell you a
[55:08] secret this morning that if you want to
[55:10] grow spiritually it requires separation
[55:13] a spiritual growth it it ain't sometimes
[55:16] it's all the time in order for you to
[55:17] have a spiritual growth it always
[55:19] requires you to separate it may be
[55:21] separating from unbelief it might be
[55:23] separating from from Idols it might be
[55:25] separating from Traditions it might be
[55:27] separating from family traditions or
[55:29] some theology or some some old church
[55:31] teaching or something but in order for
[55:33] you to have spiritual growth you must
[55:36] you must uh take part in separating from
[55:39] things brother Mark you had to cut
[55:40] things out of your life you had to you
[55:42] have to take things that are holding you
[55:44] back and you have to cut them out you
[55:45] have to take things that that take that
[55:47] Rob you of your time and you have to cut
[55:48] them out if you want to have spiritual
[55:50] growth this morning then you must have
[55:52] separation are you hearing me this
[55:54] morning if you want to grow in God then
[55:56] you must have separation you must be
[55:57] willing to take some things out of your
[55:59] life let me tell you what he did to
[56:01] Abraham he called Abraham and he asked
[56:03] him he said separate yourself from all
[56:05] that you have and come over into a
[56:07] Strange Land brother B said that's what
[56:09] Christianity is he said it's going into
[56:11] a Strange Land that you know nothing
[56:14] about it it's to walk into a land
[56:16] separating from the things of this world
[56:18] because God has called you it's going
[56:20] into a land and and dwelling among a
[56:22] people that you may not know nothing
[56:24] about why because you're a pilgrim and a
[56:26] stranger and you're called of God let me
[56:28] tell you friends this world is not our
[56:30] home we're Pilgrim how many pilgrims do
[56:32] we have here this morning this world is
[56:34] not my home I may be in this world but
[56:36] I'm not of this world and God has called
[56:38] me to separate from the things of this
[56:40] world he's called me to be a pilgrim and
[56:43] a stranger in this world my Bible says
[56:45] it here there is no continuing City but
[56:48] we're seeking one to come every city in
[56:50] this world it'll be destroyed brother
[56:52] Mark everything that you build it'll be
[56:54] destroyed every house you by it'll you
[56:57] may as well just look at it all all the
[56:59] houses and all the lands and all the
[57:01] cars and all the wealth that we build up
[57:03] in this world you can look at it you can
[57:05] say it ain't nothing but hay and stubble
[57:07] you look at the house it's hay and
[57:08] stubble you look at the car it's hay and
[57:10] stubble for one day it'll all burn and
[57:13] it'll all be destroyed it'll never stand
[57:15] the wrath of God but let me tell you
[57:17] friends if you could open your spiritual
[57:19] eye this morning you would see that the
[57:21] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand isn't that
[57:23] what John said he said the Kingdom of
[57:25] Heaven he's walking Among Us there's a
[57:27] kingdom that is coming upon this Earth
[57:29] brother Wesley it ain't like the world
[57:31] that we live in it ain't filled with
[57:33] crooked politicians it ain't filled with
[57:35] lying preachers it ain't filled with
[57:36] false churches it ain't filled with
[57:38] systems of the world that are made to
[57:40] gain wealth it is be filled with one
[57:42] thing it's the spirit of almighty God
[57:44] and the revelation of Jesus Christ has
[57:46] opened the eyes of the believer to see
[57:49] the Kingdom of Heaven is coming down
[57:51] upon the Earth that we live in he called
[57:54] him to separate from things of this
[57:55] world but notice after separation then
[57:58] there come a revelation see you you want
[58:01] to grow with the you want to grow with
[58:02] God and grow in his word and the only
[58:05] way to grow is to separate because the
[58:07] Bible says after Abraham separated from
[58:09] lot and lot was separated from him then
[58:12] God said to Abraham lift up your eyes
[58:14] and look from the place that you you are
[58:16] and you look to the north look to the
[58:18] South and look to the East and look to
[58:19] the West isn't it something brother Cody
[58:21] after he separated from all those things
[58:23] that God had called him to separate from
[58:25] then God be to reveal to him what was
[58:28] his when he went into the land Brother
[58:29] David he was walking he was walking by
[58:31] faith he didn't know where it was he
[58:33] said you go to a land that I will show
[58:35] you but once he had that period of
[58:37] Separation God said now you look North
[58:39] that's yours you look South and that's
[58:41] yours look to the East and that's your
[58:43] look to the west and that's yours from
[58:45] River from River to Sea that's all that
[58:47] belongs to you this land that you see I
[58:49] will give it unto thee into thy seed
[58:51] forever see it was after separation that
[58:53] the Revelation came many times you say
[58:55] well I want to know what God has for me
[58:57] what what promise God has laid in there
[58:59] for me but go ahead and follow the plan
[59:01] of God and separate from the things of
[59:03] the world you would say well I just
[59:04] don't see like I'm grow for I'm going to
[59:06] preach anyhow I don't feel like I'm
[59:07] growing I don't feel like I'm getting
[59:09] anywhere with god well go ahead and
[59:10] separate from the things of the world
[59:12] and let the revelation of God strike
[59:14] your heart I can't get any farther I
[59:16] read my Bible it just seems like I'm
[59:17] getting nowhere I I go to pray it just
[59:20] seems like the prayer is going nowhere
[59:21] brother Matt what do I do separate from
[59:23] the things of the world and the things
[59:25] of your past and all the things that
[59:27] you've gone through you make a total
[59:28] separation and become one with God and
[59:31] let the revelation of God strike your

[59:36] Brother David it it didn't happen right
[59:37] away God gave him the promise you know
[59:40] what happened the next few years they
[59:42] were troubled years in the wilderness in
[59:44] the plains there was great Wars that
[59:46] broke out nation was fighting against
[59:48] Nation kings that came they went down
[59:50] into Sodom and they they they took
[59:53] captive the the people there they took
[59:54] lot into captivity Abraham he went into
[59:57] battle he armed his servants and he went
[59:59] out into battle remember in the in the
[1:00:00] slaughter of the Kings and he went back
[1:00:02] and took everything that belonged to him
[1:00:03] and his loved ones and and he brought
[1:00:05] them back into the fold and the Bible
[1:00:07] says but then whenever they would come
[1:00:08] to give him a reward that Abraham would
[1:00:10] turn he'd say I don't want to anything
[1:00:12] from you I don't want anybody to think
[1:00:15] that that you're the one that that that
[1:00:17] that made me and I don't I don't I don't
[1:00:18] want to think that I'm the one that
[1:00:20] built this up and he he said I just want
[1:00:22] to be one that would follow the will of
[1:00:23] the Lord and then let God pour out the

[1:09:54] walk through every problem you say
[1:09:56] brother man I don't know how I'll ever
[1:09:58] walk through the fire how can I walk
[1:10:00] through the river I don't think I can go
[1:10:01] through another trial I don't think I
[1:10:03] can make it through another day well
[1:10:05] thank god brother Wesley it ain't got
[1:10:06] nothing to do to your thoughts won't you
[1:10:08] step over into Jeremiah 29:11 he said
[1:10:11] the thoughts I think toward you are
[1:10:13] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:10:15] bring you to an expected end I thank God
[1:10:18] it ain't my thoughts he's concerned with
[1:10:20] anyhow it's God's thoughts he turn with
[1:10:22] that's what we need is a walk through
[1:10:24] the pages of the Bible
[1:10:26] again how's he going to do it how can he
[1:10:29] take me through how can he walk me
[1:10:30] through how can he take me to another
[1:10:32] step how could he over help me overcome
[1:10:34] this trial how can he get me through the
[1:10:36] fire let me tell you why just walk with
[1:10:38] me over into Deuteronomy and then find
[1:10:40] out what God said he said it is the Lord
[1:10:43] himself shall go before
[1:10:45] thee he said I'll walk before you I'll
[1:10:48] never leave you nor forsake you do not
[1:10:51] fear and don't be discouraged we need to
[1:10:54] walk through the the pages of the Bible
[1:10:57] to remind us who we are and where we
[1:10:59] came from and the promise that God has
[1:11:01] given us and when you get done with that
[1:11:03] walk you know what you do you do what
[1:11:05] Abraham done the Bible said after he
[1:11:07] came back from Counting Stars the Bible
[1:11:10] says he believed
[1:11:14] God After You Walk Through This
[1:11:17] Promise he said he believed God and it
[1:11:20] was counted unto him for righteousness
[1:11:24] brother West we we take a walk Walk
[1:11:25] Through the Bible we believe the Lord he
[1:11:28] said where but Lo notice he said just
[1:11:30] like us cuz we're
[1:11:31] flesh he said Lord whereby shall I know
[1:11:35] that I shall inherit it you know
[1:11:37] sometimes you can ask good
[1:11:39] questions it ain't bad to ask questions
[1:11:41] it's the motive of the question that
[1:11:44] makes it good or bad this was an
[1:11:46] unbelieving Spirit it was kind of like
[1:11:48] what Mary had when the angel came to her
[1:11:50] she he she said how can this thing be
[1:11:53] said the the Holy Ghost overshadow you
[1:11:55] and bring forth a child well that ain't
[1:11:56] no good answer can you imagine a carnal
[1:11:59] mind thinking of that well that that
[1:12:00] still didn't make sense to the carnal
[1:12:02] mind but you know what she said she said
[1:12:04] be unto me according to Thy word see the
[1:12:07] answer was good enough so if you ask a
[1:12:09] question take the Bible answer if you
[1:12:12] want the take the answer may not make
[1:12:14] sense but take the answer be it unto me
[1:12:16] according to Thy word it'll always work
[1:12:18] out he said this is how you'll know God
[1:12:20] begins to confirm the Covenant that he
[1:12:22] made with Abraham you know what we do
[1:12:24] today but I'm Mark we go and we we shake
[1:12:26] a hand say brother this is what I'll do
[1:12:28] this is what you'll do and your hand
[1:12:29] shake God Bless you that's what we'll do
[1:12:30] and we just both do our part that's the
[1:12:32] Covenant that we make one with another
[1:12:33] that's good enough but in the days for
[1:12:36] for honest men that's good enough for
[1:12:38] believers that's good enough for
[1:12:39] Christians that are it's good enough
[1:12:41] they still do that but in the days of
[1:12:44] Abraham it wasn't that way they made a
[1:12:45] covenant in the Eastern countries they
[1:12:47] had to kill a beast they stood between
[1:12:49] the the dead pieces of the Beast and
[1:12:50] they rode on a parchment of lamb skem
[1:12:52] whatever it was and that was the
[1:12:54] Covenant that they made and over the
[1:12:56] dead body of the Beast they took an oath
[1:12:58] that if they broke the Covenant to let
[1:13:00] them to be cut into pieces like the dead
[1:13:02] Beast was so this was the this was The
[1:13:04] Vow that they made so here Abraham asked
[1:13:07] God he said well how shall I know this
[1:13:09] shall be and this is what God told him
[1:13:11] he said I'm going to make a covenant
[1:13:12] with you he said go take a hepher and a
[1:13:15] and a goat in a real and he took them
[1:13:16] took them out all the animals and he
[1:13:18] divided them up in the midst and each
[1:13:19] piece against another but when the sun
[1:13:21] was going down the Bible says and a deep
[1:13:23] sleep fell upon Abram and a of
[1:13:24] great Darkness fell upon him and it came
[1:13:26] to pass when the sun went down and a
[1:13:28] smoking furnace and a burning lamp
[1:13:30] passed between those two pieces and in
[1:13:31] the same day the Lord made a covenant
[1:13:34] with Abram my is it something that here
[1:13:37] when he was wondering how God would
[1:13:39] would take him through and how God would
[1:13:40] fulfill his promise God came and said
[1:13:42] but I'm going to make a covenant that
[1:13:44] it'll be fulfilled now how many knows
[1:13:45] what a covenant is it's a promise or a
[1:13:47] vow or a contract between one man and
[1:13:49] another many places in the Bible we find
[1:13:51] we find God makes covenants with men and
[1:13:53] the the very first one coming the Book
[1:13:55] of Genesis when he made it with Adam
[1:13:56] remember don't touch this this tree and
[1:13:58] if you live if you eat of this one the
[1:14:00] tree of knowledge you shall surely die
[1:14:02] it was the it was the adamic Covenant
[1:14:04] that God made with him in the book of
[1:14:05] Exodus we find another Covenant called
[1:14:07] the Mosaic Covenant that God had made
[1:14:09] with Moses he said he said when he told
[1:14:11] them he made the Mosaic Covenant in the
[1:14:12] wilderness but notti as soon as God made
[1:14:14] it with them this is a law that they
[1:14:16] must keep they broke the Covenant and
[1:14:17] here we find this to be the case that
[1:14:20] every time that God makes a covenant
[1:14:22] with men men always fail to do their
[1:14:24] part
[1:14:25] are you hearing me men always break the
[1:14:27] Covenant so when God makes a covenant
[1:14:29] men it ain't going to be long they're
[1:14:31] going to break the Covenant that God
[1:14:32] makes I thought isn't it something here
[1:14:34] that whenever God had made him a a
[1:14:36] covenant brother Mark it didn't take
[1:14:37] them long in the wilderness they broke
[1:14:39] what God Said and would have been a
[1:14:40] failed nation had had had God just held
[1:14:43] that over them it would have all failed
[1:14:45] but God being an eternal God knowing
[1:14:48] that they would break that in the
[1:14:49] wilderness God being an eternal God
[1:14:51] knowing that they would fail in the
[1:14:53] wilderness and they wouldn't keep the
[1:14:54] law of God and they wouldn't keep the
[1:14:56] order of God he knew they wouldn't do it
[1:14:58] so before they ever went in the
[1:15:00] wilderness Glory it makes me feel good
[1:15:02] before they ever went into Egypt before
[1:15:04] Moses ever came in and brought them out
[1:15:06] brother Mark before any of it happened
[1:15:08] God had already made another Covenant
[1:15:10] with Abraham in Genesis the 12th chapter
[1:15:12] and when he made this one brother Mah it
[1:15:14] wasn't like that old covenants that God
[1:15:16] made it wasn't a covenant of law but
[1:15:18] brother said this Covenant he said the
[1:15:20] whole Covenant of Abraham was a complete
[1:15:22] Covenant of the grace of God the Abraham
[1:15:25] Covenant it wasn't if you'll do a
[1:15:26] certain thing I'll do something but
[1:15:28] Abraham was called by election nothing
[1:15:31] that Abraham done he said see in Genesis
[1:15:34] 18 He said see that Abraham shall surely
[1:15:36] become a great and mighty nation and all
[1:15:39] the nations of the Earth shall be
[1:15:40] blessed in him for I know him that he
[1:15:43] will command his children in household
[1:15:45] after him they shall keep the way of the
[1:15:47] Lord to do justice and judgment that the
[1:15:49] Lord may bring upon Abraham that which
[1:15:51] he has spoken of him this is what God
[1:15:54] says about Abraham Genesis 18 and18 but
[1:15:57] I want you to notice this this word for
[1:15:59] I know 18:19 for I know him that he will
[1:16:03] command his children when you look this
[1:16:04] word know up in the Hebrew it's the
[1:16:06] Hebrew word yada which also it means to
[1:16:09] know but it has another meaning it means
[1:16:11] chosen so when you read this scripture
[1:16:13] again it says seeing that Abraham shall
[1:16:16] surely become a great and mighty nation
[1:16:18] brother Jared and the nations of the
[1:16:19] Earth shall be blessed in him for I have
[1:16:23] chosen him isn't that good
[1:16:25] for I know him that word know it it's it
[1:16:28] says chosen for I have chosen him that
[1:16:31] he will command his children I have ch
[1:16:33] my isn't that isn't that so much better
[1:16:34] not only do I know him but I have chosen
[1:16:36] him that he would command his children I
[1:16:38] have chosen him that he would he would
[1:16:40] keep the way of the Lord I have chosen
[1:16:42] him that he would do justice and
[1:16:44] judgment I have chosen him that the Lord
[1:16:46] may bring Abraham all that which he has
[1:16:49] spoken of him isn't that good it wasn't
[1:16:52] just that God knew you would do it but
[1:16:53] it was that God chose you to do it he
[1:16:55] chose you because he knew you would he
[1:16:58] was he wasn't based on your efforts he
[1:17:00] chose you I know I know this is
[1:17:02] controversial I know when you look at
[1:17:04] when you read this in the in the church
[1:17:05] world today it's a controversial subject
[1:17:07] on the subject of election but let me
[1:17:09] just let me just make it make it easy
[1:17:11] for you this morning this is not brother
[1:17:12] Matt's teaching this come from the Bible
[1:17:14] out of Romans the nth chapter if you
[1:17:16] want to read it Paul does a whole
[1:17:17] message on it he said I say the truth in
[1:17:20] Christ and I don't lie but my conscience
[1:17:22] is bearing witness to the Holy Ghost
[1:17:23] here was a prophet of God God by the
[1:17:25] name of Paul how many knows Paul he was
[1:17:27] an apostle a prophet of God he was
[1:17:29] anointed by God to speak the gospel he
[1:17:31] said I'm not lying I'm telling you the
[1:17:33] truth and the W the Holy Ghost is a
[1:17:34] witness of what I'm saying that I have a
[1:17:36] great heaviness and continual sorrow
[1:17:38] that I could wish that I myself for a
[1:17:41] curse for my brethren for My Kinsman
[1:17:43] according to the flesh who are
[1:17:44] Israelites that that that supposed
[1:17:46] they're supposed to get the the adoption
[1:17:48] and the glory and the covenants and the
[1:17:50] law and the service of God and all the
[1:17:52] promises their fathers that that that
[1:17:54] whom concerning Christ came God blessed
[1:17:57] them forever but whenever they came and
[1:17:59] got it it was of none effect unto them
[1:18:01] he said but I want you to know this that
[1:18:03] not all of Israel is Israel he said
[1:18:06] neither because they are the Seed of
[1:18:07] Abraham are they his children but the
[1:18:10] Bible said in Isaac show shall thy seed
[1:18:12] be called so that means that the it
[1:18:14] wasn't the children of the flesh for
[1:18:16] that was the children of God but it was
[1:18:17] the children of the promise that were
[1:18:19] counted for seed he said for this Word
[1:18:21] of Promise he said whenever Sarah should
[1:18:24] have son not only that but he said
[1:18:26] Rebecca would bring forth a son by Isaac
[1:18:29] and while Rebecca was still had her sons
[1:18:31] in her womb remember Jacob and Esau the
[1:18:34] Lord spoke unto him he said when they
[1:18:36] were still unborn they've never done
[1:18:38] good or evil he said the elders Shall
[1:18:40] Serve the younger for as it is written
[1:18:42] Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated
[1:18:45] Paul said and that was so that the
[1:18:48] purpose of God according to election
[1:18:51] might stand see not of works
[1:18:55] not of us but of him that calleth he
[1:18:57] said so Moses said I will have mercy on
[1:19:00] whom I'll have mercy I'll have
[1:19:01] compassion on whom I will have
[1:19:03] compassion he says so the see it's not
[1:19:05] of him that willth nor of him that
[1:19:07] runneth but it's God that showeth Mercy
[1:19:11] can I read this again listen he say so
[1:19:13] so God's gift is not a question of our
[1:19:16] human will or our human effort God's
[1:19:18] Gift ain't a question is if you'll be
[1:19:20] able to do it brother Mark or or if
[1:19:21] you'll be able to keep the word or
[1:19:23] you'll be able to keep the the law or
[1:19:25] you'll be able to stand for truth it
[1:19:27] ain't it ain't your ability of what
[1:19:28] you'll be able to do but his gift his
[1:19:30] gift is not based on your will or your
[1:19:32] effort at all but it's only a question
[1:19:34] of God's mercy so it don't depend on our
[1:19:37] own willingness it depends on the mercy
[1:19:39] of God it don't depend on our own
[1:19:41] ability it depends on God having the
[1:19:43] ability to have mercy upon us oh let me
[1:19:46] tell you friends that's what happened
[1:19:48] with Abraham whenever God called him it
[1:19:50] was the mercy of God that found a man it
[1:19:53] was the mercy of God God that called him
[1:19:56] it was the mercy of God that led him on
[1:19:58] his way to fulfill the plan of God can I
[1:20:00] say it like this election is a product
[1:20:03] of the mercy of God it's a product of
[1:20:06] Mercy see the law produced many things
[1:20:09] It produced death it produce judgment it
[1:20:11] produ it produced the flood in the days
[1:20:13] of Noah it'll produce a fire of judgment
[1:20:16] in the end time it was a law of God
[1:20:17] brother Mah that brought these things to
[1:20:19] pass but let me tell you Mercy had a
[1:20:21] play in it too Mercy It produced
[1:20:23] something totally different when the
[1:20:25] mercy of God came brother Wesley It
[1:20:27] produced life Mercy produced It produced
[1:20:30] celection It produced eternal life It
[1:20:32] produced something Everlasting the mercy
[1:20:35] of God that's what found you whenever
[1:20:37] you were lost in sin it was Mercy that
[1:20:39] saved you and brought you to the grace
[1:20:41] of God that when you should have saw the
[1:20:43] Judgment of God but it was God's mercy
[1:20:45] that brought you out it was God's hand
[1:20:47] of Mercy that stayed judgment from your
[1:20:49] life it's no wonder David said surely
[1:20:51] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[1:20:54] the days of my life friends let me tell
[1:20:56] you from the time that you were born
[1:20:57] into this world when you were born into
[1:20:59] sin and you were speaking lies and you
[1:21:01] were living in iniquity the mercy of God
[1:21:04] and the goodness of God was following
[1:21:06] after you the law of sin and death had
[1:21:08] you bound the nature of Flesh it ruled
[1:21:11] over you but then God saw something
[1:21:13] different he took an image brother Joe
[1:21:15] was preaching about Wednesday night he
[1:21:17] took the image of you and he posted on
[1:21:19] the walls of Heaven he said Heaven's
[1:21:21] Most Wanted he sent out agents called
[1:21:23] goodness and mercy and they pursued
[1:21:25] after you and they searched for you and
[1:21:27] they followed after you and then he sent
[1:21:29] an enforcer called the Holy Ghost and he
[1:21:31] came to where you were and he brought
[1:21:33] you out of that old condition that you
[1:21:34] were in and he established you in the
[1:21:36] path of
[1:21:38] God brought you out of your condition
[1:21:41] established you in the word and then he
[1:21:43] sent you on your way and now brother
[1:21:45] Travis we sing a different song I'm
[1:21:48] Bound for the promised land I was bound
[1:21:50] for hell until the mercy of God found me
[1:21:54] I was bound for Destruction until mercy
[1:21:56] found me now I'm Bound for Glory now I'm
[1:21:59] Bound for I'm Heaven bound the mercy of
[1:22:02] God brother Market never failed you see
[1:22:05] the Flesh of your life it's a product of
[1:22:07] your mother your father this flesh body
[1:22:10] it's a product of mom and dad carries
[1:22:12] the natur of mom and dad you see it all
[1:22:15] over some people you sometimes you see
[1:22:18] people you I don't I don't know your
[1:22:19] name but I know your daddy's name I know
[1:22:22] your mama's name why because they're a
[1:22:24] product of their mom and dad in this
[1:22:26] flesh but this new life this new
[1:22:28] creation is a product of your heavenly
[1:22:31] father it's a product of the the mercy
[1:22:34] of Jesus Christ see it was by his Mercy
[1:22:37] that he chose you it was by his Mercy
[1:22:40] that he elected Abraham think of it it
[1:22:42] was the mercy of God that he elected
[1:22:44] Abraham Abraham wasn't a great man he
[1:22:46] wasn't doing great efforts you think he
[1:22:49] was a perfect man I don't believe that I
[1:22:51] don't believe that for a minute you'll
[1:22:52] never convince me everything he done was
[1:22:54] right and everything was perfect for God
[1:22:56] to call him
[1:22:57] righteous but he was just an ordinary
[1:22:59] man but the mercy of God called him he
[1:23:03] elected him by Mercy look what happened
[1:23:06] to him brother Mark the children of
[1:23:08] Abraham because of this mercy of God
[1:23:10] that was upon them they got into a Egypt
[1:23:13] down there all bound up and they had to
[1:23:16] have something that would come to bring
[1:23:18] them out of that place but listen what
[1:23:20] every time they got in trouble notice
[1:23:22] what God would do he would go back to
[1:23:24] the Covenant that he made why a't that
[1:23:26] good every time you see I don't have
[1:23:28] time to go through it this morning but
[1:23:29] every time you see him in trouble every
[1:23:31] trial every every every place every
[1:23:33] battle they'd look back to the god of
[1:23:34] Abraham or the god of Isaac what were
[1:23:36] they referring to was the Covenant that
[1:23:38] God had made with Abraham he's the god
[1:23:40] of the Covenant he he's the one that
[1:23:42] made it and brother Mark when they got
[1:23:43] in trouble they begin to to call upon
[1:23:45] the Lord and you notice there was only
[1:23:46] one thing that could save them when the
[1:23:48] death angel came into Egypt there was
[1:23:49] only one thing that could save them it
[1:23:51] was the Covenant that God had made you
[1:23:53] brother I'm say what kind of Covenant
[1:23:54] wasn't it was a bloodbound covenant that
[1:23:56] he made with him and that's what always
[1:23:58] saved them notice when they went in when
[1:24:00] the when the death angel came in they
[1:24:02] slew a lamb and put the blood on the
[1:24:04] door when they went marching around
[1:24:06] Jericho what was it that that Rahab hung
[1:24:08] out of her window it was a Scarlet
[1:24:10] thread what was it a type of it was a
[1:24:12] type of the blood of Jesus Christ it was
[1:24:14] a type of Christ on Calvary since see
[1:24:16] you recognize all under the blood was
[1:24:18] saved in Egypt and all under the blood
[1:24:21] was saved in Jericho and all under the
[1:24:23] blood is what will be saved today
[1:24:25] brother Jared that's what the world
[1:24:27] needs they need to come under the
[1:24:28] Covenant of almighty God I thank God
[1:24:31] this morning that he's given us a
[1:24:33] covenant brother Mark it ain't a
[1:24:34] covenant of law but it's a bloodbound
[1:24:36] covenant let me tell you friends that
[1:24:38] Covenant in Egypt it was only typing
[1:24:40] something to come that Covenant in
[1:24:42] rahab's house it was typing something to
[1:24:44] come but it could never carry forward
[1:24:46] that that that Scarlet thread it could
[1:24:48] never carry forward but the Covenant of
[1:24:50] the blood of Jesus Christ it had a
[1:24:52] different power than the blood that was
[1:24:54] the door it had a different power than
[1:24:56] the blood that or the the thread that
[1:24:58] was hanging down the wall of Jericho but
[1:25:00] this Covenant blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:25:02] Christ it's good enough for your past
[1:25:04] it's good enough for your present it's
[1:25:06] good enough for your future it's the
[1:25:08] only Covenant that God ever made that
[1:25:10] would go from eternity to Eternity and
[1:25:12] it would cleanse every one of us and
[1:25:14] make us to be able to walk upright
[1:25:16] before almighty God it's a covenant
[1:25:19] brother Mark it cover oh I I know some
[1:25:21] of you looking back like I'm strange but
[1:25:23] let me tell you it'll cover your past
[1:25:25] sin can I read it to you Paul said
[1:25:27] Romans 3:25 whom God has set forth to be
[1:25:30] a propitiation through the faith in his
[1:25:32] blood to declare his righteousness for
[1:25:35] the remission of the sins that are
[1:25:37] passed are you hearing me so I want you
[1:25:40] to think about this this morning think
[1:25:42] about all the you don't have to think
[1:25:43] about all the sins of your past but just
[1:25:45] put them into one thing call them sins
[1:25:46] of the past I don't want you walking
[1:25:48] down that trail with the
[1:25:50] nightmare but put them all one place the
[1:25:52] sins of the past and then the take the
[1:25:54] scripture and apply it to it to declare
[1:25:56] his
[1:25:57] righteousness glory to God for the
[1:26:00] remission of the sins that are
[1:26:03] passed through the forbearance of God
[1:26:06] you know what forbearance means it means
[1:26:08] forgiveness so here the sins that are
[1:26:10] passed in the Statue of a perfect man
[1:26:12] Peter would talk about all the things
[1:26:14] that a Christian ought to have he said
[1:26:15] but he that lath these things is blind
[1:26:17] and cannot see a far off and he has
[1:26:20] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:26:23] old sins
[1:26:24] a man that don't possess these things
[1:26:26] that God has called a Believer to walk
[1:26:28] in that isn't walking in his stature in
[1:26:31] his full stature as a Believer he said
[1:26:33] that man has forgotten that's what the
[1:26:35] purpose of Paul WR or Peter writing that
[1:26:37] was it was to remind you of who you are
[1:26:40] this is what a Believer must be must
[1:26:41] have faith and virtue and the knowledge
[1:26:43] of God and Temperance all these things
[1:26:45] this is the character of God this is
[1:26:46] what you ought to have he said any man
[1:26:48] that ain't walking in that he has
[1:26:49] forgotten that he was forgiven he was
[1:26:52] purged of his old sins
[1:26:54] the sins of the past are covered see
[1:26:56] brother Mark by the Covenant of God's
[1:26:58] blood but then watch what Paul says in
[1:27:00] Colossians 2 what about the ones that
[1:27:02] are present can I just teach through it
[1:27:04] a minute he said you being dead in your
[1:27:06] sins and uncircumcision of your flesh
[1:27:09] being dead in your sins that's a
[1:27:11] present uncircumcision of your flesh
[1:27:13] hath he quickened together with him
[1:27:16] having forgiven you all
[1:27:18] trespasses somebody say all with me that
[1:27:21] means everything all your trespasses es
[1:27:25] all the things of your past he said
[1:27:26] he'll blot out the handwriting of
[1:27:27] ordinances that was against us which was
[1:27:29] contrary to us and he took it out of the
[1:27:32] way and he nailed it to his
[1:27:34] cross all of our sins brother Wesley
[1:27:37] those that are past those that are
[1:27:39] present this word all in the Greek come
[1:27:41] from the come from the word POS Pas it
[1:27:43] means that all every whole all manner of
[1:27:47] Thoroughly it refers to completeness
[1:27:50] that there are no sins that Christ
[1:27:52] sacrifice did not cover but all all of
[1:27:54] our sins past present and future they
[1:27:57] have been nailed to his
[1:27:59] cross that's why go ahead and you can
[1:28:01] praise the Lord go ahead we're in church
[1:28:03] anyway we ain't at a ball game you can
[1:28:05] be loud here all your sins past present
[1:28:09] and future have been nailed to the cross
[1:28:13] that's why Paul could say in Hebrews 13
[1:28:15] that the God of Peace has brought again
[1:28:17] from the dead of our Lord Jesus the
[1:28:19] great Shepherd of the sheep through the
[1:28:21] blood of the Everlasting Covenant not
[1:28:23] only did he send a covenant that would
[1:28:26] that would that would wipe out all your
[1:28:27] sins but he made sure that Covenant
[1:28:30] would never end isn't that
[1:28:32] good a't that good brother Robert not
[1:28:35] only did it take them all out all the
[1:28:37] the past all the all the all the ill
[1:28:39] things the things you don't want to
[1:28:40] think of all the nastiness in your past
[1:28:42] that that you went through in this flesh
[1:28:44] but God came by and he wiped all of it
[1:28:46] out and then he made a covenant brother
[1:28:48] Wesley that would be
[1:28:50] Everlasting isn't it something he said
[1:28:52] it's an everlasting covenant not only
[1:28:54] did he did he make it all but he made it
[1:28:55] it would last for all time through the
[1:28:57] blood of the Everlasting Covenant it
[1:28:59] would make you somebody say me it would
[1:29:01] make you perfect in every good work to
[1:29:03] do his will working in you God chose you
[1:29:07] to do his will God chose you that you
[1:29:10] would be well pleasing in his side how
[1:29:12] can I be well pleasing God chose you to
[1:29:14] be well pleasing how can how can I do
[1:29:16] good to do his work God chose you to do
[1:29:18] his work how can I be perfect God chose
[1:29:20] you to be perfect the blood of his
[1:29:23] Everlasting Covenant would make you
[1:29:25] perfect it would work in you that which
[1:29:27] is well pleasing in his sight through
[1:29:29] Jesus Christ to him be the glory the
[1:29:31] blood of Jesus Christ an Everlasting
[1:29:34] Covenant brother R said isn't it
[1:29:35] something that was Everlasting I love
[1:29:37] this but Robert it's not an eternal
[1:29:39] Covenant it was Everlasting Covenant
[1:29:41] because there's one day that you'll
[1:29:42] never need it anymore that Covenant was
[1:29:45] made because one day when you're
[1:29:47] redeemed it's all over it's Everlasting
[1:29:49] means it lastes all through time so as
[1:29:53] long as there is time time and we're
[1:29:54] creatures of time this Covenant will be
[1:29:56] there but one day you won't need the
[1:29:58] Covenant no more but until time runs out
[1:30:00] we're going to need it and you'll have
[1:30:02] it it's an everlasting Covenant that God
[1:30:05] has made with his children let me tell
[1:30:07] you friends with God's covenant the the
[1:30:10] characteristics of this Covenant are so
[1:30:11] wonderful it a blood Covenant brother
[1:30:14] Morgan it was an Everlasting Covenant it
[1:30:17] was sent to the faith seat of Abraham
[1:30:19] and not only that but it was
[1:30:20] unconditional you know what that means
[1:30:22] brother Wesley Abraham didn't do
[1:30:23] anything to deserve it he didn't do
[1:30:25] anything to Warrant it the Bible says
[1:30:27] God chose him I know I know the devil
[1:30:28] don't like this kind of preaching but
[1:30:30] it's the gospel TR they call it Feelgood
[1:30:32] preacher they got they say you're trying
[1:30:33] to pump people up and all this let me
[1:30:35] tell you I'm trying to pump the word of
[1:30:37] God into you that's what I want you to
[1:30:38] see who you really are that you ain't
[1:30:40] just some barely Christian that that
[1:30:42] just found your way one day and it just
[1:30:44] so happened that that you're going to
[1:30:45] believe this for a little while but God
[1:30:47] chose you to be who you are he chose you
[1:30:49] to walk this wall he chose you to be a
[1:30:51] believer he chose you to be the Bride of
[1:30:53] Jesus Christ he chose you to hear his
[1:30:55] word he chose you to be able to to
[1:30:57] accept it and to walk in it and to raise
[1:30:59] your family in it you were chosen by God
[1:31:01] to be righteous and to walk upright
[1:31:03] before God it ain't a feel-good message
[1:31:06] it's the gospel truth you were chose you
[1:31:09] you need to hear it till you believe it
[1:31:10] you were chosen by God I'm talking about
[1:31:13] God an eternal God that looked down from
[1:31:16] the banisters of Heaven throughout all
[1:31:18] of eternity and he picked you out of
[1:31:20] millions of people on this world he said
[1:31:22] there's my bride she'll believe what I
[1:31:24] send her I'm going to make her where
[1:31:26] she'll be established I'm going to make
[1:31:28] her so strong that when she goes through
[1:31:30] a trial she can go another mile I'm
[1:31:32] going to make her so strong that when
[1:31:33] the fires of the pressure come up on her
[1:31:36] life she'll be able to rise through it
[1:31:38] I'll make her so strong that when she
[1:31:40] feels she'll be have enough faith that
[1:31:42] she'll be able to raise those up around
[1:31:43] her I chose her to walk in this age I'm
[1:31:46] going to make her so strong that in the
[1:31:48] midst of Le osia she'll still be able to
[1:31:51] stand I'm going to make her so strong
[1:31:53] that when her FLH body is so weak that
[1:31:55] she can't even get up and go to church
[1:31:57] but her faith will still cry out to God
[1:31:59] and say God heal my grandchildren God
[1:32:01] heal my children God moveing the church
[1:32:04] a she'll be so strong that her faith
[1:32:05] will still cause her to be a prayer
[1:32:08] Warrior I'll make her strong I chose you
[1:32:12] to be just that unconditional Covenant
[1:32:16] see this Covenant of Abraham it was a
[1:32:18] type of Calvary notice what came with it
[1:32:20] and I'm about to close what came with it
[1:32:22] it was a Promised Land let me show you
[1:32:24] how much it was like Calvary it was it
[1:32:26] was a perfect type there was a Promised
[1:32:29] Land There was blessings didn't know
[1:32:31] what was promised at Calvary there was
[1:32:33] blessings the Covenant through faith
[1:32:35] would extend to everybody is know what
[1:32:37] he said at Calvary without it there
[1:32:40] wouldn't be a promise without it there
[1:32:43] was no election without it there was no
[1:32:46] inheritance without it there was no
[1:32:48] adoption without it there was no there
[1:32:50] was no sunship
[1:32:54] but listen it was
[1:32:56] unconditional he didn't have to do
[1:32:57] nothing for the Covenant God done made
[1:33:00] that with him he just had to stay put I
[1:33:03] love brother Brown picks this up he said
[1:33:05] there ain't one thing that Abraham had
[1:33:06] to do he said he had to abide in his
[1:33:09] Covenant he said see we know this the
[1:33:11] only thing we have to do to inherit any
[1:33:13] of God's promises is to stay put on
[1:33:15] God's word that's the
[1:33:18] condition we have to stay put on God's
[1:33:20] word and don't let nothing shake you
[1:33:22] from it this Covenant of Abraham this
[1:33:25] when we whenever Christ came watch the
[1:33:27] the Covenant of Abraham was a type of
[1:33:28] what Christ was going to do at Calvary
[1:33:31] when he came at Calvary this New
[1:33:32] Covenant or new testament it showed us
[1:33:34] that Jesus met every requirement for us
[1:33:37] that God required to make us back to be
[1:33:40] true Sons and Daughters of God under the
[1:33:43] blood of Jesus Christ where there is no
[1:33:45] more condemnation my just like Abraham's
[1:33:48] Covenant it made it brother brother
[1:33:49] Bobby that everything happened just like
[1:33:52] God said and his land was given to him
[1:33:54] just like God said and all that God
[1:33:56] promised was fulfilled he said the
[1:33:58] purpose of that is so that when you seen
[1:33:59] what happened on the cross of Calvary
[1:34:01] you'd be able to take that same thing
[1:34:03] and apply it to your life and say
[1:34:05] everything God said it's going to happen
[1:34:07] it covered all my sins I say Amen it
[1:34:09] took it delivered me from all my past I
[1:34:12] say Amen it healed me of my of my broken
[1:34:14] spirit I say Amen it healed me of my
[1:34:17] broken body I say Amen there was no more
[1:34:19] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:34:22] Jesus and notice what he done when Jesus
[1:34:25] came sister Lori he gave that Covenant
[1:34:27] to his disciples he said now you go into
[1:34:29] the world and preach the gospel and out
[1:34:32] they went taking the Covenant of Jesus
[1:34:34] Christ what was it they were preaching
[1:34:36] it was his Covenant the New Testament
[1:34:38] they were preaching to the world and let
[1:34:39] me tell you a secret friends we're still
[1:34:41] doing it today God still has anointed
[1:34:44] men that has taken his Covenant and
[1:34:45] preached it to this world it's the it's
[1:34:48] the elers in the day of Abraham it's the
[1:34:50] here in the end time it's the message of
[1:34:52] elaser when Abra sent his faithful
[1:34:54] servant uh the the the the servant the
[1:34:57] model servant of the Bible said being
[1:34:58] sent to hunt a bride for Isaac and
[1:35:00] that's what we're doing today it's the
[1:35:02] message of elaser calling a bride for
[1:35:04] Isaac out of this world not building up
[1:35:08] some church or building up some name for
[1:35:09] oursel but the purpose of our ministry
[1:35:12] is to call a bride to Isaac you realize
[1:35:14] what we are we are carriers of the
[1:35:16] message of the hour we are carriers of
[1:35:18] the message of elaser that the purpose
[1:35:20] of it was was come out of her my people
[1:35:22] don't you realize that why God is
[1:35:24] allowing us to still stand here today
[1:35:26] and have a pull pit and and preach this
[1:35:28] very message this morning is because God
[1:35:30] is not done with Mercy he's still a god
[1:35:33] of Mercy he's still a merciful god he's
[1:35:36] still longsuffering and he's still
[1:35:38] anointing men to take the message of
[1:35:40] elaser saying would there be one more
[1:35:42] that would come unto me would there be
[1:35:44] another follower would there be one more
[1:35:46] that would lay down your waterp and come
[1:35:49] and receive the blessings that God has
[1:35:51] given for them he said God still sends
[1:35:53] his men with an angel before the church
[1:35:55] and he goes and he takes the message to
[1:35:57] the church that's what God still does
[1:36:00] just like eler done when he represented
[1:36:02] the father of Christ notice what he done
[1:36:05] let me tell you about God's men can I
[1:36:07] just tell you this as I'm closing I tell
[1:36:09] you what God's men do he said he loaded
[1:36:11] the camels full of good gifts and he
[1:36:13] gave them to Rebecca remember what
[1:36:15] elaser done on the way back she had
[1:36:17] camell loads of gifts that was given to
[1:36:19] her said that's what that's what elaser
[1:36:23] that's what he done then he said there
[1:36:24] but he never told her that they were for
[1:36:26] another generation or for another day
[1:36:28] they were for her cuz she was the bride
[1:36:32] and that's what God does today every
[1:36:34] true servant of God that's sent out has
[1:36:36] got a whole book of divine promises that
[1:36:40] he can offer to the Bride of Jesus
[1:36:41] Christ oh friends I don't know you may I
[1:36:44] may not be a preacher but it sure makes
[1:36:45] me feel like one when I have a whole
[1:36:47] book of divine promises that I can give
[1:36:49] to you I'm not talking about selling
[1:36:51] somebody something that that ain't
[1:36:53] really what it is he said but you had a
[1:36:55] whole book of the Divine Promises of God
[1:36:57] that you can give to the Bride of Jesus
[1:36:59] Christ oh what we have to offer is
[1:37:01] greater than what the world has to offer
[1:37:03] what we have to give is greater than
[1:37:05] what the devil has to give I thank God
[1:37:08] that he's got gifts in here to be able
[1:37:10] to give to the church he said there's
[1:37:11] gifts in there for her he will not hold
[1:37:14] any of them back he'll give every one of
[1:37:16] them freely a true servant of God a
[1:37:18] modal servant a servant that God can put
[1:37:21] his trust in he won't try to hide it
[1:37:23] from cuz he knows that she's the
[1:37:25] oncoming queen of glory and he'll find
[1:37:28] every promise that lays in the Bible and
[1:37:30] he'll give it to the Bride of Jesus
[1:37:32] Christ I thank God that he's anointed Us
[1:37:35] in this hour to hear the message of the
[1:37:37] hour let me tell you why we don't hide
[1:37:38] from it because it's God's promise to
[1:37:40] the Bride of Jesus Christ and you got a
[1:37:43] right to give it to the people of God I
[1:37:45] don't care what they say about me if
[1:37:47] it's God's promise you got a right to it
[1:37:49] I don't care what they call us they can
[1:37:51] call us Fanatics if they want to but you
[1:37:52] got a right to the promises of God and I
[1:37:55] got a right to give it he said every
[1:37:57] true model servant of God that God can
[1:38:00] put his trust in he won't hide it he'll
[1:38:03] give it to her that's what the Bible
[1:38:04] said for there ain't no good thing that
[1:38:07] was withheld from them that'll walk
[1:38:08] upright before him God won't withhold
[1:38:11] one thing from you a't that something
[1:38:14] men men as music players want to come
[1:38:16] men try to put them curses on you God
[1:38:18] ain't going to bless you now God ain't
[1:38:20] going to all this is going to happen to
[1:38:22] you all the men do that ain't what God

[1:38:26] God does he says I got a whole book of
[1:38:28] promises and a true let me can I read
[1:38:31] this a true servant a model servant a
[1:38:34] servant that God can put his trust in he
[1:38:37] will give every one of them freely he's
[1:38:40] got gifts for her he will not hold any
[1:38:42] of them back he won't try to hide it
[1:38:44] back from her because he knows she's the
[1:38:47] oncoming
[1:38:49] Queen we ain't got nothing to hold back

[1:38:56] Church you may as well go all the way
[1:38:58] take every promise that God gave you
[1:39:01] whatever things you desire in your heart
[1:39:03] he said you believe it and you'll
[1:39:04] receive it let us get to a place that we
[1:39:08] can receive the promises of God he said
[1:39:10] if you abide in me and my word abides in
[1:39:12] you you ask what you will and it'll be
[1:39:14] given unto you get to a place that you
[1:39:17] can receive every promise of God the
[1:39:20] Bible's full of them brother Markin I
[1:39:23] love
[1:39:24] it hear a prophet of God he said and
[1:39:26] every promise in that book is
[1:39:30] yours because you are the
[1:39:34] bride my can you imagine what Rebecca
[1:39:38] thought that day when she sat up there
[1:39:40] with elaser she heard the call she
[1:39:44] responded she went to water in the
[1:39:47] camels and then he told her to come with
[1:39:49] her she left all that stuff she went up
[1:39:53] there on that Wagon Train well why don't

[1:40:47] many things in it that had to have
[1:40:49] guards and servants to keep an eye on it
[1:40:51] so nobody would get into it and he
[1:40:53] guarded it until the time they would
[1:40:56] walk across the desert they' go into
[1:40:59] that place and they went with it make
[1:41:01] sure nobody else got in there and
[1:41:02] tampered with it when it came to the

[1:41:48] when you see the devil try to rob it
[1:41:50] from people Rob them of their blessing
[1:41:52] and the the joy that he's given them do
[1:41:54] you realize there's such joy that comes

[1:42:44] Covenant of God won't you stand to your
[1:42:46] feet he said while we're here
[1:42:49] listen God promised to supply all of our
[1:42:52] needs everything we had need of in this
[1:42:53] journey how many believes that he said
[1:42:56] but remember he only supplies it on his
[1:42:58] conditions we've got to meet his
[1:43:00] condition first we don't meet his
[1:43:02] condition he won't meet our condition
[1:43:04] you say brother Matt well what is God's
[1:43:07] condition for us to receive this promise
[1:43:09] of God this unconditional Covenant he
[1:43:12] said this is the only condition God has
[1:43:14] he it's the place that you meet
[1:43:17] him he'll not meet with you just because
[1:43:19] you're a church goer he won't meet with
[1:43:22] you because you're a a Baptist or a
[1:43:23] presbyterian or you're a Catholic or or
[1:43:27] or Pentecostal there's only one place
[1:43:30] that God can meet us and have fellowship
[1:43:32] with us otherwise he won't meet you just
[1:43:34] because you're because you go to a
