[13:57] feeding tube well she was in the
[13:59] hospital for I can't think off the top
[14:01] of my head I think 22 days and they were
[14:03] able to get the feeding tube out she was
[14:05] able to feed on her own they sent her
[14:06] home they said while they were there
[14:08] there was a baby that was let go that
[14:10] had been there for 100 I think it was
[14:12] 146 days and the doctor has talked to
[14:15] them she says I don't know what or he
[14:16] said I don't know what it is there's so
[14:18] many babies with cleft pallet she says
[14:20] but your baby looks perfectly normal she
[14:22] he said I don't even know that she has
[14:24] the cleff pallet until I look into her
[14:26] mouth and so we're just thanking God
[14:28] that he was able to touch her and let
[14:30] her go home after only 22 days the

[37:14] a young man that uh I believe that the
[37:17] Lord had put a had sent him here to be a
[37:20] help to the church and uh and may just
[37:23] used Haven to get to make it happen but
[37:26] uh but but in his but not in his heart I
[37:29] can say this about brother Ben he's not
[37:30] that kind of a of a guy that would go
[37:33] somewhere without a leading of the Lord
[37:35] so uh the reality is is that God made it
[37:38] happen and so we sure appreciate him and
[37:40] and uh just want to he's been kind of
[37:42] taking the secondary role on on leading
[37:45] songs brother Mark's been the primary
[37:47] and uh and since brother Mark started
[37:49] leading songs it's always been on his
[37:51] heart just to be able to fill in in that
[37:53] area until we found somebody that or the
[37:56] Lord would bring some somebody that
[37:58] could uh take that role and and uh and
[38:00] so you know brother Ben's kind of moved
[38:02] into that and so we're going to uh
[38:04] instead of him being the secondary and
[38:06] brother Mark being the primary brother
[38:07] Ben will be the primary and brother Mark
[38:09] said he don't care to uh take and help
[38:11] out you know where is needed secondary
[38:13] and and uh it allows him to go minister
[38:16] in some places on Sunday mornings so
[38:18] he's out this morning preaching at Salem
[38:20] so uh we just want to give them the
[38:22] Liberty to do that and and to continue
[38:25] uh to grow in in the church and go in
[38:27] the direction that God leads us to go
[38:29] and so uh we both felt like that was
[38:32] that would be the best thing for the
[38:34] church and moving forward and so he uh
[38:37] certainly would be able to to fill in
[38:39] and and uh so we just want to support uh
[38:42] him in that and support brother Ben now
[38:45] I'll tell you there's no there's no
[38:46] Miracle Song leader uh you can you can
[38:49] get the best one there is but without a
[38:51] people that come to entertain the Lord
[38:53] uh it sure makes his job hard so uh we
[38:56] just want to help brother Ben and
[38:58] support him in that and of course I know
[39:00] everybody saw that coming over the past
[39:02] few months many people have asked me
[39:04] about it and kind of felt like that was
[39:06] the direction uh that we were all
[39:08] planning on going and and me and mother
[39:10] brother Mark's been talking about it for
[39:12] a long time and so uh but we want we
[39:14] want everything to be done in God's time
[39:17] and so we don't ever want to rush into
[39:18] anything but we want we want God to be
[39:20] able to lead us and so we appreciate how
[39:23] many appreciate brother brother Ben
[39:26] anden and
[39:29] amen and brother Mark ain't here to brag
[39:30] on but we sure appreciate him and uh so
[39:33] he's he's certainly labored a lot for us
[39:38] and man he's he's made a he's made a lot
[39:40] of uh uh sacrifices and and has you know
[39:44] with his voice and teaching and uh he he
[39:47] teaches uh teaches school now and so
[39:49] every day he's doing that and and it
[39:52] really just makes it hard on him and so
[39:53] we uh we just we just appreciate uh that
[39:57] all that he has done in that in that uh
[40:00] area uh and so we just look forward to
[40:03] uh the Lord using him in his ministry
[40:05] and things like that so will you love
[40:07] the Lord this morning amen I want you to

[45:06] we just uh want to invite you to the
[45:09] Bible we're going to read out of
[45:11] Galatians the 4th chapter and we'll
[45:13] start in the first verse and um to give
[45:17] you a moment just to get there last uh
[45:19] Sunday while we were speaking or the
[45:21] Sunday before the meetings we had been
[45:23] speaking on uh Abraham's heirs and um
[45:28] and and my I just thought I I don't know
[45:30] how I'm sure you all did but whenever
[45:32] the meeting started uh brother Josh
[45:35] Bennett come right out and and started
[45:37] preaching on how God deals with us as
[45:39] sons and uh them those Brothers got
[45:41] right in the middle of our series and
[45:43] and I I trust them well enough to know
[45:45] they weren't out there listening to it
[45:46] it's just the way it's just what God is
[45:48] doing so how many enjoyed that and just
[45:51] the the meetings was just a a special uh
[45:55] time and just to see as brother Josh
[45:57] dealt with that and then brother Wayne
[45:59] came in and and and brought the
[46:01] Revelation that even in the fault of our
[46:03] flesh that we were still yet uh sons of
[46:06] God and there was Grace for this this
[46:08] dirt of Flesh that we uh live in and
[46:11] then brother Donnie uh came in and just
[46:13] so so masterfully spoke and uh I just uh
[46:17] I just about had a Runway when he
[46:20] started taking the stature of a perfect
[46:22] man and building it out of the garden of
[46:23] Solomon I thought man isn't that isn't
[46:25] that something that here that uh to be
[46:28] able to recognize who you are and how
[46:30] that it changes your language and and uh
[46:32] you know I told brother Donnie he did he
[46:34] didn't know this before he came but uh
[46:36] since it's just home folk now I don't
[46:37] care to say it but uh you know me and my
[46:40] wife was reading that we read that whole
[46:41] entire uh book of the Bible just a few
[46:43] days before the meeting and and uh and I
[46:47] told him later I said brother you you
[46:49] got all over me cuz what started that is
[46:51] uh my wife was sitting there and in the
[46:54] in the living room and I looked over at
[46:56] her we were there by herself and that
[46:57] you know the Sun comes through our our
[46:59] window pretty harsh and and uh she was
[47:01] sitting there in that sunlight and
[47:03] brother Wes I looked over and I said
[47:04] babe I said your teeth are like a flock
[47:07] of sheep that have never been shorn and
[47:10] none of them were Barren and they all
[47:11] had twins and she said well that what in
[47:15] the world I said I'm trying to give you
[47:16] a compliment she said well that's the
[47:18] that's the worst compliment I've ever
[47:20] got I've ever got I said well it's in
[47:22] the Bible and she said I had never heard
[47:25] that so we went over the song of solom
[47:26] and I started reading that's what got us
[47:28] to that scripture and and I I I wasn't
[47:30] sure where it was so I read the first
[47:32] chapter and then read the next chapter
[47:34] out loud and I was trying to show her
[47:35] where I had got this charm from and and
[47:38] uh and and as I read through it then we
[47:41] got a little got the talking about how
[47:44] that the bride kept talking back to the
[47:46] groom and how that she talked about
[47:48] herself and in it was in a negative
[47:50] light but after a little while she
[47:51] started uh her language changing and she
[47:54] started talking to him and saying about
[47:56] herself s the very language that he used
[47:58] about her and so here me and Sarah just
[48:00] went on had a had a wonderful time in in
[48:03] that study and I even made some notes on
[48:05] it I said well that that'd make a good
[48:07] sermon here he come in and and took a a
[48:09] miniseries on and I said well I guess it
[48:11] did and he got a lot more out of it than
[48:13] the than I than I had anticipated
[48:15] getting so I I I sure appreciate what
[48:17] the Lord had done and y'all forgive me
[48:19] for being a little bit funny this
[48:21] morning but uh but but I I appreciate
[48:23] what what what God done and just uh uh
[48:26] just uh uh take and and and to lead the
[48:28] church in this way I certainly don't
[48:30] want to repr preach those Brothers
[48:31] messages but uh I do want to continue
[48:33] down this path that we have been on in
[48:36] this study uh and and trust that we're
[48:38] getting somewhere it's not we don't just
[48:40] uh preach something uh just to uh just
[48:43] to make a um a subject or something like
[48:47] that but it's really what God put on our
[48:48] heart in the direction that we feel to
[48:50] go so I want to read this morning out of
[48:52] Galatians the 4th chapter I'll start in
[48:54] the first verse the Bible says now I say
[48:57] that the heir as long as he is a child
[48:59] differeth nothing from a servant though
[49:02] he be the Lord of all but he is under
[49:04] tutors and governors until the time
[49:06] appointed of the father even so we when
[49:09] we were children we were in bondage
[49:11] under the elements of the world but when
[49:13] the fullness of time was come God sent
[49:15] forth his son made of a woman made under
[49:17] the law to redeem them that were under
[49:20] the law that we might receive the
[49:22] adoption of sons and because you are
[49:26] Sons I love love that part and because
[49:28] you are Sons then God has sent forth the
[49:31] spirit of his son into your hearts
[49:33] crying Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no
[49:37] more a servant but a son and if you're a
[49:40] son then you're an heir of God through
[49:43] Christ Jesus and I want to take this
[49:45] this morning and speak if we have a
[49:47] title on becoming sons and we'll just
[49:49] allow you to take your seats on becoming
[49:52] Sons now we realize that here that when
[49:54] a chapter turns uh when Paul wrote this
[49:56] letter to the Galatians it wasn't in
[49:58] chapter and verse form it was just a
[50:00] letter uh and so when Paul goes from uh
[50:03] This Promise or the air according uh to
[50:06] Abraham's seed he went right over into
[50:08] the next uh uh paragraph and he began to
[50:10] speak about us being sons of God and and
[50:13] of course during this series in
[50:15] Galatians 3 we had take that first
[50:17] service on on the seed of faith and how
[50:20] that we were the children of God and we
[50:21] were of the seed line of Abraham and and
[50:25] uh and that that seed line of Abraham
[50:27] was not just the natural seed or or the
[50:29] seed where it came from Abraham down to
[50:32] Isaac and Jacob whose name became Israel
[50:34] it's the it's what most of the Old
[50:36] Testament in the uh the natural aspect
[50:38] of it is written about it's of the
[50:40] nation of Israel and their rise and how
[50:42] that God called them and placed them and
[50:44] uh took them through so many things and
[50:46] brought them uh brought them in and out
[50:48] of out of the state of bondage and Rose
[50:51] them up as a nation and and and so we
[50:53] realize but it wasn't just about the
[50:55] natural but it was also about the spirit
[50:56] spiritual it was talking about the
[50:57] church today and so we realize that
[51:00] today we're not uh it wasn't just of the
[51:02] natural seed but it was of a spiritual
[51:04] seed or this Faith Seed of Abraham and
[51:06] uh Paul would say like this he said for
[51:08] whom he did Forno he also did
[51:10] predestinate to be conformed to the
[51:12] image of his son that he might be the
[51:14] firstborn among many Brethren so here
[51:17] Paul would show us that this Abraham
[51:19] seed was not just something in history
[51:21] uh but it was speaking of Jesus Christ
[51:24] here he was the first born he was
[51:25] Abraham SE how many believe that say
[51:27] amen he he was Abraham's seed But Not
[51:29] only was he just Abraham's seed but Paul
[51:32] said he was the firstborn in other words
[51:33] there's many that would come after him
[51:35] so uh and I'll just say this this
[51:37] morning that Jesus he didn't just become
[51:40] the Son of God when he was born of Mary
[51:42] he didn't become the Son of God because
[51:44] of his natural birth and uh you know but
[51:47] but it was actually this seed of faith
[51:49] and the and the Bible says and many will
[51:51] follow after him I I know that many uh
[51:53] uh today that will preach that that way
[51:55] and say well Jesus he he was born as the
[51:57] Son of God and he became the Son of God
[51:59] when he was born in a manger but I
[52:01] actually don't believe that and I don't
[52:03] believe the Bible teaches it because the
[52:05] Bible says this when it talks about
[52:06] Jeremiah the prophet remember what God
[52:08] said he said I knew you before I formed
[52:11] you in your mother's womb even John the
[52:13] Baptist when he would talk about John
[52:15] the Baptist 700 years before John the
[52:17] Baptist ever walked upon the Earth the
[52:19] Bible said he remember Isaiah he said he
[52:22] is the voice of one that is crying in
[52:24] the wilderness so before this man ever
[52:26] walked in the wilderness before he ever
[52:28] baptized the first one Isaiah had
[52:30] already spoke of him because he God
[52:32] already knew him he was already a part
[52:34] of God he was already a Son of God he
[52:36] was already in the mind of God even when
[52:38] it came to Jesus but said Jesus Christ
[52:40] was the son of God before the foundation
[52:43] of the world he was the woman's seed
[52:45] that was to bruise the Serpent's head
[52:47] that you read about in The Book of
[52:48] Genesis so so he wasn't he didn't become
[52:51] the Son of God In A Manger he didn't
[52:53] become the Son of God when he was born
[52:55] on the Earth he was the son of God
[52:57] before the foundation of the world he
[52:58] always was the son of God and so here
[53:01] you see he was in the father he was a
[53:03] part of the father and then he was
[53:05] expressed on the earth as an attribute
[53:07] of the father just like you and I as a
[53:09] brother would speak the other day that
[53:11] we come from our father we were in the
[53:12] gene of our father and we come from God
[53:15] we were always a part of God we may came
[53:17] to this earth and we were born in this
[53:19] flesh body but our birth upon this Earth
[53:22] was only to express an attribute of God
[53:24] so we were in the mind of God brother
[53:26] Wester you were a part of God isn't it
[53:28] something that you can go around this
[53:30] world today and six billion people live
[53:32] upon this Earth and not one or not two
[53:34] of them are exactly alike what are they
[53:36] doing but here we are expressions of
[53:39] almighty God where it's something that
[53:41] God had in his mind my friends we could
[53:43] never draw it we could never we could
[53:44] never make something that way but the
[53:46] mind of God Is So vast and here God
[53:48] wants to express himself in so many ways
[53:51] and so here we come today as an
[53:53] expression of the mind of God now we
[53:55] realize that here that seed of faith it
[53:57] carried on into this day and because of
[54:00] who we are think about it because of who
[54:03] we are then we had a mediator which was
[54:05] Jesus Christ and he came and he stood
[54:07] between us in judgment and he redeemed
[54:10] us from that Old curse which was the law
[54:12] that would cause us to go into death
[54:14] because we couldn't uphold the law but
[54:16] he redeemed us from the curse of death
[54:18] and he gave us everlasting life now Paul
[54:21] showed this he showed how that the
[54:22] Covenant with Abraham that it wasn't
[54:24] based on works but it was
[54:26] then he then he went and he proved it by
[54:29] showing that Abraham was called
[54:30] righteous before he ever made an act of
[54:32] obedience remember it's a couple weeks
[54:34] I'm just giving a little refresher a
[54:36] background so brother man would say it
[54:37] like this he says so God has made this
[54:40] Covenant by himself he put it to Abraham
[54:43] he gave it to Abraham not if Abraham
[54:45] would do anything but but God said I
[54:48] have already done it he said see
[54:50] therefore it is a finished thing friends
[54:52] this is one of the greatest Revelations
[54:54] that you can ever catch that it isn't
[54:55] something that you do but it's something
[54:57] that God has already done so many people
[55:00] fail to be Christians they fail to serve
[55:02] God they fail to come to church why
[55:05] because they get to a place where they
[55:06] don't feel like that they can do it or
[55:08] they don't have the ability but here the
[55:10] prophet of God said it wasn't something
[55:11] that You' done it was something that God
[55:13] done it wasn't based on your ability it
[55:16] was based on his ability it wasn't based
[55:18] on your worthiness it was on his
[55:20] worthiness he said it's a finished thing
[55:22] it's completely and holy with Grace it
[55:25] ain't on no conditions at all it's God's
[55:28] covenant with Abraham and what Paul say
[55:31] he said Not only was it to Abraham but
[55:33] it was to his seed after him so Not only
[55:37] was this promise given to Abraham But
[55:39] Here Comes Jesus Christ who was the
[55:41] first born among many Brethren and here
[55:43] that will come after him those that have
[55:45] the same faith that Abraham had to
[55:47] believe a promise of God that you're
[55:50] saved by the grace of God that you're
[55:52] saved beyond your own understanding that
[55:54] you're saved beyond your ability but
[55:57] there's a faith that lies within us that
[55:59] causes us to be able to believe that
[56:01] very promise of God and it brings it to
[56:04] pass in our life Paul said that which
[56:06] was outwardly is not the seed of God but
[56:08] that which was inwardly is Abraham's
[56:10] seed it wasn't the flesh born it wasn't
[56:12] the the carryover from Isaac and Jacob
[56:14] on down but it was the inward man that
[56:16] was Abraham's seed he said and we being
[56:18] dead in Christ we take on Abraham's seed
[56:21] and we are hes according to the promise
[56:24] of God somebody say I'm an heir am we
[56:27] are hes according to the promise of God
[56:30] he said see now the reason we're called
[56:31] Abraham's seed is because Abraham's seed
[56:33] physically was speaking to Isaac onto
[56:36] Christ that Christ came and then he gave
[56:38] his life as a ransom to us and he sent
[56:41] forth the Holy Spirit back which gives
[56:44] us the faith that Abraham had before he
[56:47] was circumcised so here the Holy Spirit
[56:49] would come that would give you the faith
[56:52] to be able to believe the promise of God
[56:54] see my isn't that good not only did he
[56:56] he say that you have to believe it then
[56:58] God is going to send something to the
[56:59] church that would cause you to be able
[57:01] to believe it so see it ain't even on my
[57:03] own will it ain't all my own belief or
[57:05] how good I can believe or how strong of
[57:07] a believer that I can be but he said but
[57:09] God is going to send the Holy Spirit
[57:12] which would allow you to be able to
[57:13] believe it it it's what gives us the
[57:15] faith that Abraham had that we could
[57:17] Believers for the Bible said he believed
[57:19] God and it was imputed unto him for
[57:21] righteousness he said and notice then
[57:23] God gave him the sign of circumcision as
[57:25] a confirm
[57:26] or the recognition of his faith and
[57:29] today when we believe God with all of
[57:32] our heart and we accept his son the Lord
[57:34] Jesus God recognizes that that faith is
[57:36] true in him and then he sends back down
[57:39] the Holy Spirit of promise and he seals
[57:42] us until the day of our Redemption now
[57:45] that'll make a country boy want to shout
[57:47] that he seals us you know what it means
[57:49] to be sealed it means that there there
[57:51] ain't nothing can get in it when you
[57:53] that means that it can't be it can't be
[57:55] Mish handled it can't be mixed it can't
[57:57] be lost oh friends let me tell you
[57:59] something we're talking about the Bride
[58:01] of Jesus Christ and the this bride
[58:04] that's going to go into the Rapture the
[58:06] the one that will never go through a
[58:08] tribulation this body of this body of
[58:10] Believers that is called the bride it's
[58:12] a collective body around the world it's
[58:14] a many membered bride it's made up of
[58:17] the sons and the daughters of God now I
[58:18] don't want you to confuse this term can
[58:20] I just lay this in here just a minute
[58:22] but when you hear the term the bride of
[58:24] Christ it's referring to the col
[58:26] Collective body of Believers as
[58:28] individuals we're sons and we're
[58:30] Daughters of God but as a body we're the
[58:32] bride for a time for a time we were
[58:35] called the church but when when the when
[58:37] the prophet came he said now he said I
[58:39] call you bride in other words this was a
[58:41] true church it was a spiritual body of
[58:43] Believers so it doesn't mean you're not
[58:45] sons of God and you're not Daughters of
[58:47] God you're still a son and you're still
[58:48] a daughter but as a body collectively we
[58:51] are called The Bride of Jesus Christ
[58:53] This is a spiritual church the one that
[58:55] Christ would have a union with you know
[58:57] why he would have to do that because
[58:58] there's a whole world full of churches
[59:00] but he wanted to make sure that the that
[59:02] that that the devil understood but this
[59:04] one belongs to me it ain't this church
[59:06] building it ain't Grace Tabernacle it's
[59:08] a ACC cumulative body of Believers
[59:12] around the world that has been called to
[59:14] this very thing they were a part of God
[59:16] in the mind of God before the foundation
[59:19] of the world let me tell you something
[59:20] about this church it's not a church that
[59:22] you can join there's a lot of churches
[59:24] that you can join you can become members
[59:26] you can put your name on the book but
[59:28] this is a church the only way you'll get
[59:29] into it is if you're born again you had
[59:32] to be born it come you can come into it
[59:34] by a new birth and then he said then he
[59:36] sends down his holy spirit of promise
[59:40] and he seals us until the day of
[59:42] redemption you know what that tells me
[59:44] this bride church is sealed in with God
[59:47] and the world is sealed on the outside
[59:49] my but think about it that we've been
[59:50] sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise
[59:53] oh you think about what it means to be
[59:54] sealed in with God that means the world
[59:57] ain't got no way in it means the devil
[59:59] ain't got no way in let me tell you
[1:00:00] friend sometimes he may get on your
[1:00:02] flesh sometime you may get anointed In
[1:00:04] the Flesh and it causes you to act out
[1:00:06] and it causes you to fall on your face
[1:00:08] and it causes you to do things that you
[1:00:10] should not do but it has nothing to do
[1:00:12] with the Seal of God that is upon your
[1:00:14] life you may fall you may fail you may
[1:00:17] go months down the road that you ain't
[1:00:19] what you're supposed to be but it has
[1:00:21] nothing to do with a seal of God that is
[1:00:23] upon your life let me tell you why God
[1:00:25] does he had to make it that you can make
[1:00:28] it he had to make it that in the midst
[1:00:30] of our failures in the midst of our
[1:00:32] flesh that God could steal that his
[1:00:34] purpose would still come to pass we've
[1:00:36] been sealed in with God isn't that what
[1:00:37] happened the first time there was a
[1:00:39] judgment I may as well preach the first
[1:00:41] time there was a judgment upon the Earth
[1:00:43] was in the days of Noah you know what
[1:00:45] God told Noah to do he said build an ark
[1:00:47] out of go for wood and then I want you
[1:00:49] to seal it on the outside and seal it on
[1:00:51] the in and he took that old tar pitch
[1:00:53] and he put it on the inside and out that
[1:00:56] it could flow through the waters of
[1:00:57] judgment and the Judgment can never can
[1:01:00] never penetrate those that were on the
[1:01:02] inside cuz they were sealed in God he
[1:01:05] said he sent us a Hool my good he sent
[1:01:08] us a holy spirit of promise that would
[1:01:10] seal you in that means the devil ain't
[1:01:13] got nothing to do with it he can drag
[1:01:15] you around and beat you around all he
[1:01:17] wants to but let God speak to you this
[1:01:18] morning but there comes a seal of God
[1:01:21] upon your life and the devil can't touch
[1:01:23] you no more it's a revelation
[1:01:26] this was Paul's message to Galatians
[1:01:28] listen he said that receiving the holy
[1:01:30] spirit is a sign of true faith in Jesus
[1:01:33] Christ it's not a result of following
[1:01:36] after the
[1:01:37] law to receive this it comes from faith
[1:01:41] it comes from having faith in Jesus
[1:01:43] Christ so it doesn't matter whatever we
[1:01:44] go through it doesn't matter whatever
[1:01:45] works we do but by the only way you'll
[1:01:48] ever be a child of God Is by faith so
[1:01:51] see this is this is Paul's message but
[1:01:53] remember said it's a keynote to the
[1:01:54] scriptures that Faith he cometh he that
[1:01:57] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:02:00] and he's a rewarder of those that
[1:02:01] diligently seek Him for without faith it
[1:02:04] is impossible to please God so Paul said
[1:02:07] by faith we're sons of God see said it's
[1:02:10] always Faith this world was made by
[1:02:12] faith the things that were shaped were
[1:02:14] were made into existence by faith but
[1:02:16] God seen out there a DW drop hanging in
[1:02:19] the air and he spoke and he said let
[1:02:21] there be light and there was light and
[1:02:23] then he brought the land forth and he
[1:02:25] dried it off and and so forth and all of
[1:02:27] that was done by an Act of Faith with
[1:02:29] God the whole world is made by faith
[1:02:32] you're here today by faith see we're the
[1:02:35] faith children somebody say faith
[1:02:37] children
[1:02:38] children you're a child of God by faith
[1:02:42] I feel like preaching you're a child of
[1:02:44] God by faith it's not something you can
[1:02:46] work into I know I know I've been on
[1:02:49] this for a while but there's a reason
[1:02:50] you're a child of God by faith you have
[1:02:52] to get that old teaching out of your
[1:02:53] mind where somebody had made such a law
[1:02:56] that you have that that that this law
[1:02:57] was going to save you and today you're
[1:02:59] saved and tomorrow you're lost and the
[1:03:00] the next day you're saved and the next
[1:03:02] day you're lost again but that ain't got
[1:03:03] nothing to do with it you're saved by
[1:03:05] faith in Jesus
[1:03:07] Christ said it was an Act of Faith the
[1:03:10] whole world was made by faith we're
[1:03:12] Faith children we have faith that God
[1:03:15] accepts our sacrifice we have faith that
[1:03:17] God accepts our worship we have faith
[1:03:20] how do you know God accepts your worship
[1:03:22] how do you know God accepts your
[1:03:23] sacrifice or it's a sweet smell and SA
[1:03:25] of God if it isn't by faith that's all
[1:03:28] we have but by faith we believe that God
[1:03:31] accepts it by faith we worship God that
[1:03:33] God accepts our worship by faith we he
[1:03:36] hears our prayer by faith he hears our
[1:03:38] repentance but remember said there's
[1:03:40] only two things that every person in
[1:03:41] this world would live by it's either
[1:03:43] Faith or unbelief there ain't no halfway
[1:03:45] between there's no drunk sober man
[1:03:47] there's no black white birds there's no
[1:03:48] sinner Saint you're either born again or
[1:03:50] you're not born again either you believe
[1:03:52] or you don't believe how many say I
[1:03:54] believe I believe by
[1:03:57] Faith by faith we're Believers Romans 4
[1:04:00] he said for if they which are of the law
[1:04:03] be The
[1:04:05] Heirs hear me now if they which are of
[1:04:08] the law be The Heirs then faith is made
[1:04:10] void right and the promise is made of
[1:04:13] none effect so if the law made you an
[1:04:16] heir of God then all that God done to
[1:04:18] Abraham had no
[1:04:20] purpose listen what Paul's saying he
[1:04:23] said because the law workers Works Wrath
[1:04:26] and where there is no law there is no
[1:04:29] transgression my goodness see if there's
[1:04:32] no law how would you do any wrong you're
[1:04:34] only wrong because the law said it was
[1:04:35] wrong Paul said where there is no law
[1:04:37] there's no transgression therefore it is
[1:04:39] of faith that it might be by Grace now
[1:04:44] watch he shows us why he says to the end
[1:04:46] that the promise might be sure to all
[1:04:49] the seed not to that which is of the law
[1:04:51] but that also which is of the faith of
[1:04:53] Abraham who is the father of all he says
[1:04:56] see to the end that the promise might be
[1:04:58] sure now you think about this word that
[1:05:00] Paul uses the promise would be sure you
[1:05:02] know if you ever if you go out and you
[1:05:03] take out a loan or maybe some of you
[1:05:05] maybe done a big construction job or a
[1:05:07] contract or something like that when you
[1:05:09] do a big job a lot of times when you go
[1:05:11] out to do it they will they will ask you
[1:05:14] uh uh you know to to make sure that you
[1:05:16] have the money to do the job so or or to
[1:05:18] make sure you have the ability to
[1:05:20] perform the contract so they'll ask you
[1:05:22] to have a shity or a bond that would
[1:05:25] back up the contract that you're making
[1:05:27] so that just in case something would
[1:05:28] happen to you you're or you failed
[1:05:30] halfway through the job or you didn't
[1:05:32] finish or something or you couldn't
[1:05:33] afford to get it all done well so so
[1:05:35] they require assurity or bond that
[1:05:37] they're going to pay out money up front
[1:05:38] to make sure that everything got done uh
[1:05:41] according to the contract see so
[1:05:43] assurity is a promise or or an agreement
[1:05:46] that is made by one that that that that
[1:05:49] debts and financial obligations will be
[1:05:51] paid in other words assurity acts as a
[1:05:54] guarantee on the cont contract see so if
[1:05:57] you can't meet the requirements then the
[1:05:58] shity will guarantee to step in and
[1:06:01] cover where the default is oh friends
[1:06:04] listen while Paul used this word he said
[1:06:06] that the promise might be made sure in
[1:06:08] other words there had to be an insurance
[1:06:10] on the promise of God or there there had
[1:06:12] to be can I say it like this an
[1:06:14] assurance on the promise of God so here
[1:06:16] God gave a promise to Abraham and he
[1:06:19] said we received the Promise by faith
[1:06:21] but Grace was assurity upon the promise
[1:06:24] of God so here God made a promise that
[1:06:26] he's going to have a seed there'll be a
[1:06:28] faith seed and here that this is the
[1:06:30] inheritance that the that those heirs
[1:06:32] are going to receive he said but then I
[1:06:34] want to make sure that there's something
[1:06:35] that'll back up that contract he said so
[1:06:38] Grace became the shity of the contract
[1:06:40] of God oh friend don't you realize what
[1:06:43] God done he put up a sacrifice that was
[1:06:45] greater than any sacrifice that the law
[1:06:47] would ever require the very requirements
[1:06:50] of the law were met by this sacrifice
[1:06:52] that God made the the very thing that it
[1:06:54] demanded God met it friends even in our
[1:06:57] best effort when we would try to find
[1:06:59] our uh try to do our best sometimes we
[1:07:02] find ourselves in default somebody say
[1:07:04] hello somebody say Amen sometimes we
[1:07:06] find oursel in default but let me tell
[1:07:09] you this morning that we have assurity
[1:07:11] upon the promise of God sometimes you
[1:07:13] feel like it don't belong to you no more
[1:07:16] sometimes you feel like that you're not
[1:07:17] a part of it but I thank God that Paul
[1:07:19] said but God put assurity upon his
[1:07:22] promise that when you're in default and
[1:07:24] when you fail and you that that that he
[1:07:26] would give you Grace that you could
[1:07:28] receive it by faith oh my friends now
[1:07:30] think about it when we mess up we can't
[1:07:33] pray enough to fix it we can't sacrifice
[1:07:35] enough to make it right we can't fast
[1:07:37] enough to feel God anymore it feels like
[1:07:39] we pray and nothing takes place and all
[1:07:41] of a sudden we feel like everything in
[1:07:43] our life that we've defaulted on the
[1:07:45] promise of God or defaulted on the
[1:07:47] Covenant that God made with us but
[1:07:48] friends even in our default I thank God
[1:07:51] this morning that I have assurity that
[1:07:54] was given by God I have a Blessed
[1:07:56] Assurance F let God say it this morning
[1:07:58] when I feel like I'm in default when I
[1:08:00] feel like I'm overspent when I've over
[1:08:03] promised when I can't get the job done
[1:08:05] when I failed in my abilities when I
[1:08:06] failed in my works I'm about to lose all
[1:08:09] that I have but friends you me tell you
[1:08:10] what you do when you're in default you
[1:08:12] pick up God's contract and you read the
[1:08:15] shity bond that is lying on the inside
[1:08:18] of it you find that portion and you
[1:08:20] begin to read it like Paul said he said
[1:08:23] oh my I feel like preaching this morning
[1:08:25] when you're in default somebody read the
[1:08:27] shity Paul said what shall we say then
[1:08:29] to these things for if God be for us who
[1:08:32] can be against us I found my shity right
[1:08:35] in the middle of a contract oh brother
[1:08:38] Matt I'm in default but if God before us
[1:08:41] then who can be against us I don't think
[1:08:43] I can make it another day well he spared
[1:08:45] not his own son but he delivered him up
[1:08:47] for us all how shall we not with him
[1:08:50] also freely give us all things oh I'm
[1:08:53] not worthy to be able to receive
[1:08:55] anything from God but who shall lay
[1:08:58] anything to the charge of God's elect it
[1:09:00] is God that justifi this is our shity
[1:09:04] whenever we can't do it by our faith our
[1:09:06] faith is weak or our abilities fail and
[1:09:09] we find oursel in theault he said who is
[1:09:11] he that condemneth it is Christ that
[1:09:13] died yay rather it is he that rose again
[1:09:16] who is even at the right hand of God and
[1:09:18] he's making intercession for us somebody
[1:09:21] say for me it's Christ that died it's
[1:09:24] Christ that hung on Calvary it's Christ
[1:09:26] that shed his blood it's Christ that
[1:09:28] said it is finished and it's Christ
[1:09:30] that's sitting on the right hand of the
[1:09:31] father making intercession for you it's
[1:09:35] your
[1:09:35] shity who shall separate us can I read
[1:09:38] another a little bit who shall separate
[1:09:40] us from the love of Christ who then can
[1:09:43] separate me from the love of Christ I
[1:09:45] have assurity I feel good shall
[1:09:49] tribulation or distress or persecution
[1:09:51] or famine nakedness or Peril or sword
[1:09:54] Paul said nay but in all these things we
[1:09:57] are more than conquerors through him
[1:09:59] that loved
[1:10:01] us for I am persuaded that neither death
[1:10:04] nor life nor angels nor principality nor
[1:10:07] powers nor things present nor things to
[1:10:09] come nor he nor depth nor any other
[1:10:12] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:10:14] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:10:16] Jesus our lord it's ass
[1:10:19] shity upon the promise of God now I
[1:10:23] thank God we have a shity bond this
[1:10:25] morning listen what Paul was speaking
[1:10:27] this was so powerful because here as
[1:10:29] he's dealing with these two covenants
[1:10:32] the Covenant of Law and Grace here here
[1:10:35] he would he would point out showing us
[1:10:37] that right in the middle of the law of
[1:10:39] Moses y'all remember me quoting this
[1:10:40] last time in the middle of the law of
[1:10:42] Moses god actually showed Israel that
[1:10:44] the abrahamic Covenant superseded the
[1:10:46] law or the Covenant with Moses or the
[1:10:47] Mosaic Covenant here because remember
[1:10:49] when Moses come down from the mountain
[1:10:51] they were waiting on the law of God he
[1:10:52] came down in the Book of Leviticus is
[1:10:54] the written law of God that came from
[1:10:57] Moses so this is Mosaic Covenant but
[1:10:59] here in the middle of that Mosaic
[1:11:01] Covenant when you get to reading it it
[1:11:02] says if you if you fail here you'll be
[1:11:04] cursed if you mess up here this is the
[1:11:06] curse that'll come upon your life this
[1:11:08] will be carried from generation to
[1:11:09] generation this we this one will cause
[1:11:11] you to be an outcast and here all the
[1:11:13] way down I'm I'm I'm skipping through a
[1:11:14] bunch but all the way down here it shows
[1:11:16] the curse that comes because we broke
[1:11:18] the law but listen but right in the
[1:11:20] middle of that very law there lays a
[1:11:23] treasure here what is it it's the shity
[1:11:25] bond that God put upon his word right in
[1:11:28] the middle of the law in Leviticus 26 he
[1:11:30] said but if they shall confess their
[1:11:32] iniquity and the iniquity and the
[1:11:34] iniquity of their fathers with their
[1:11:35] trespass which they trespass against me
[1:11:38] and they walk contrary to me I walk
[1:11:40] contrary to them I brought them in the
[1:11:42] land of their enemies he said but yet
[1:11:44] for all of that when they be in the land
[1:11:46] of their enemies I will not cast them
[1:11:48] away neither will I abore them or
[1:11:51] destroy them utterly and to break my
[1:11:53] Covenant with them for I am the Lord
[1:11:56] their God God said I will remember my
[1:11:58] Covenant even in the law of Moses he
[1:12:00] said but don't forget I'll remember my
[1:12:02] Covenant I made with Abraham and Isaac
[1:12:04] and Jacob what it's assurity upon the
[1:12:07] upon the word of God in the midst of the
[1:12:09] law that the Covenant of Grace still
[1:12:11] stands see because of this abrahamic
[1:12:13] Covenant God think of it because of it
[1:12:16] God is faithful to see it through in the
[1:12:18] midst of the law Grace abounds Grace is
[1:12:21] the shity that the purpose of God comes
[1:12:24] to pass
[1:12:26] it's the shity that God's purpose listen
[1:12:29] friends Grace is the shity that God's
[1:12:32] purpose is fulfilled in your life we all
[1:12:35] needed it it's the only thing that can
[1:12:37] make sure that God's purpose is
[1:12:39] fulfilled that's why Paul would say Abra
[1:12:41] Abraham's seed we're Abraham's seed and
[1:12:44] we're HS according to the promise of God
[1:12:47] and God made it sure now notice what
[1:12:49] Paul says in Galatians 4 And1 he said
[1:12:52] now I say
[1:12:55] that the heir as long as he is a child
[1:12:58] differeth nothing from a servant though
[1:13:01] he be the Lord of all but he's under
[1:13:03] tutors and governors until the time
[1:13:04] appointed of the father I'll take just a
[1:13:06] minute think here what Paul is speaking
[1:13:09] of you remember in the old time in the
[1:13:11] Old Testament here a father would have a
[1:13:14] great Kingdom or lands and maybe
[1:13:16] hundreds of Acres that he would he would
[1:13:18] possess and here he would live up on
[1:13:20] this land and and many houses and things
[1:13:23] that would be around and those that
[1:13:24] would take care of the land and and you
[1:13:26] know people would actually seek out
[1:13:27] Refuge from someone that had had that a
[1:13:30] place to be able to stay and live and
[1:13:32] work and and and to be able to provide
[1:13:34] for their family and so here this father
[1:13:36] that would have these great things but
[1:13:38] uh but when a child was born into his
[1:13:41] own home you think of of how and he and
[1:13:43] he was the parent uh when it was born
[1:13:47] that this child when he was born he was
[1:13:49] always a child of this father even at
[1:13:52] his birth and this is where the
[1:13:53] Pentecostal churches have missed so many
[1:13:56] things that that he was a child when he
[1:13:58] was born he was already a child this was
[1:13:59] his this was he was B he was birthed as
[1:14:01] a child he was in his father before he
[1:14:03] was born he was in the gene of his
[1:14:05] father he came into the world but
[1:14:07] whenever he came to this place of birth
[1:14:09] that noticed because of the father
[1:14:12] having so many things to do and maybe
[1:14:14] handling all of this great business and
[1:14:16] all all that he had that the father he
[1:14:18] wouldn't have time to spend dayto day
[1:14:20] teaching the son and raising him and
[1:14:21] showing him all the ways and so he would
[1:14:23] go out and he would find a teacher or
[1:14:25] someone that had the ability as a tutor
[1:14:28] that that Paul would call it he would he
[1:14:30] would bring him in to teach the the the
[1:14:32] child and to raise him up and and to
[1:14:34] teach him the ways of the father and
[1:14:36] show him uh what would be pleasing to
[1:14:38] the father and show him how that the
[1:14:39] father would handle his business so
[1:14:41] whenever when he would uh go and buy
[1:14:43] things and make purchases and sell and
[1:14:45] and so all of this was taught by the by
[1:14:47] the teacher and so here he would he
[1:14:51] would raise him up so here when he was
[1:14:52] born he was a child but he would but but
[1:14:55] as he was raised up when he would get to
[1:14:57] a certain place then he would take on
[1:14:59] the responsibilities that the father had
[1:15:01] see he had to he had to come to this uh
[1:15:03] this place uh of adoption that Paul
[1:15:06] would speak of or or this place of
[1:15:08] maturity so we realized that he would
[1:15:10] come to this adoption ceremony and then
[1:15:12] he would have the authority then he'd
[1:15:14] have the father's ring he'd be able to
[1:15:15] make a a sign or make the seal because
[1:15:19] he had been an adopted son he was always
[1:15:21] a son but then he became an adopted son
[1:15:24] because he came to this place of
[1:15:25] maturity and so we realize but say see
[1:15:28] what a beautiful picture that is of God
[1:15:30] and his church he said our father sent
[1:15:32] to us the church he sent us a tutor or a
[1:15:35] teacher and God found the best tutor
[1:15:37] that there was in heaven and he put it
[1:15:39] over his church it was the Holy Spirit
[1:15:41] and the church was not to be raised on
[1:15:43] intellectual or to or to be tutored by
[1:15:46] uh denomination but it was to be tutored
[1:15:48] by the Holy Ghost this is God's teacher
[1:15:51] this is what God sent to the church to
[1:15:53] bring it to a place of maturity now now
[1:15:56] notice what Paul said he said but it is
[1:15:58] under the tutors and governors until the
[1:16:01] time appointed of the father so here he
[1:16:03] said you were born you were already born
[1:16:05] a child but you're but you're no
[1:16:07] different than a servant because a child
[1:16:09] don't have the ability to make decisions
[1:16:11] so he just goes around I mean you think
[1:16:12] about what a kid does he have chores and
[1:16:14] you know they they just go around do the
[1:16:16] chores and sometimes that's what our
[1:16:17] kids feel like I I'm preaching to
[1:16:19] somebody you boys may as well say Amen
[1:16:20] but sometimes yeah thank you buddy
[1:16:22] sometimes it just feels like you're just
[1:16:24] a servant you're you're just doing all
[1:16:25] the chores you got to take out the trash
[1:16:27] you got to sweep the room you you know
[1:16:29] you it just seems like it's all chores
[1:16:31] but Paul said but that's that's the way
[1:16:33] it is he said a child is is no different
[1:16:36] than a servant until he under tutors and
[1:16:38] governors until he comes to this place
[1:16:40] of adoption and then all of a sudden he
[1:16:42] has responsibility and then he becomes a
[1:16:45] a head of a home and so so but but but
[1:16:47] in the spiritual side Paul say see so
[1:16:49] here we're under tutors and governors
[1:16:51] until the time that is appointed of the
[1:16:54] father now you watch what Paul does is
[1:16:56] in in Romans the 8th chapter he would
[1:16:58] speak on this subject again he said the
[1:17:00] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:17:02] which was the earth wait is waits for
[1:17:05] the manifestation of the sons of God now
[1:17:07] is that not is that not just what Paul's
[1:17:09] talking about in The Book of Galatians
[1:17:11] he's talking about the sons of God being
[1:17:13] manifested the earth is waiting on them
[1:17:15] to come to this to come to this place so
[1:17:18] we realize that what Paul is showing us
[1:17:20] in Romans 8 that a f the fullness of
[1:17:22] adoption is the Redemption of our body
[1:17:25] so you won't be you'll never have that
[1:17:27] uh the the fullness of that until our
[1:17:29] body is redeemed he said that's what the
[1:17:31] earth is waiting on the manifestation of
[1:17:33] the sons of God but said like this he
[1:17:35] said see God is waiting on me and you
[1:17:37] the church is waiting on me and you
[1:17:38] adoption time when God can pour into us
[1:17:41] his fullness his power his resurrection
[1:17:45] that that that will that when the church
[1:17:47] in Christ become so close together till
[1:17:50] Christ becomes visible Among Us and
[1:17:52] raises the dead and we go into the
[1:17:54] rapture
[1:17:55] so here what is the fullness of the
[1:17:58] adoption it's the time of harvest in
[1:18:00] other words it's the time when the bride
[1:18:03] would come to the place of maturity now
[1:18:05] I know some whenever you say this and
[1:18:07] you talk about the church coming to a
[1:18:09] place of maturity a lot of times people
[1:18:11] take that as a negative thing that that
[1:18:13] that you're saying well we're not mature
[1:18:14] or the bride is not mature enough to go
[1:18:16] into the Rapture but or or that nobody
[1:18:19] has IM maturity but but but it's not
[1:18:21] that at all it's not a it's not a
[1:18:23] negative thing because you know you you
[1:18:25] can't say well the the everybody
[1:18:26] nobody's mature because we're still here
[1:18:28] but it but it doesn't mean that there's
[1:18:30] none in the body that are mature but can
[1:18:32] I say it like this remember what Jesus
[1:18:33] said when the last one comes in then
[1:18:35] we'll go think about it no man knoweth
[1:18:38] the hour or the date or the hour except
[1:18:40] except for the father so he he's the one
[1:18:42] that knows the time when the bride would
[1:18:44] come to this place of maturity so we see
[1:18:47] how what what this is showing us is can
[1:18:49] can I just say it like this if you had a
[1:18:51] field of wheat out there growing and and
[1:18:54] when the the if you know anything about
[1:18:55] farms and you go around maybe looking at
[1:18:57] some of these soybean Fields you'll
[1:18:58] notice when you go by when it comes to
[1:19:00] the time of maturity and some of this
[1:19:03] crop becomes mature that all around the
[1:19:05] edges of the of the crop and and and in
[1:19:08] other places there's a lot that are
[1:19:10] still not there yet there's a lot of
[1:19:12] small growth and maybe maybe something
[1:19:15] had stuned the growth or maybe it it was
[1:19:17] it was under something else but but do
[1:19:19] you realize that the farmer is actually
[1:19:21] watching the field the farmer don't set
[1:19:23] a specific date and say on this day that
[1:19:26] I'm going to come on this day I'm going
[1:19:28] to make a Harvest on this y'all get
[1:19:29] everybody prepared cuz this is the day
[1:19:31] that the Harvest is going to come but
[1:19:33] the farmer don't do it that way but in
[1:19:35] actually the farmer is watching the
[1:19:37] field and the maturity of the crop and
[1:19:39] when the crop comes to a place of
[1:19:41] maturity it's actually the maturity of
[1:19:43] the field that determines when the
[1:19:45] farmer comes so here this is what God
[1:19:48] knows because God is an eternal God but
[1:19:51] this is also what God is waiting on he's
[1:19:53] waiting on the mature maturity of the
[1:19:55] crop to come to this place so that's the
[1:19:57] same way it is with the bride of Jesus
[1:19:59] Christ there's many that are mature
[1:20:01] there's many that they they could go uh
[1:20:04] right now they're they're at a place
[1:20:05] that that that that that that's where
[1:20:07] God needs us to get to but then there's
[1:20:09] many that are still green can I say it
[1:20:11] that way there's many that there's many
[1:20:13] that that uh uh that that that that is
[1:20:15] waiting on this and you realize that
[1:20:16] it's the maturity of this body of
[1:20:18] Believers is what CED the resurrection
[1:20:21] can I say that again the maturity of the
[1:20:23] Bride is what calls the resurrection
[1:20:26] it's waiting on the bride to come to
[1:20:28] this place of maturity see whenever you
[1:20:30] think of this this way that the maturity
[1:20:32] of the Bride is what is going to bring
[1:20:34] the resurrection all of a sudden going
[1:20:36] to church has a purpose all of a sudden
[1:20:38] preaching has a purpose that we're not
[1:20:40] just coming here to get by to go to
[1:20:42] another service but spending time in
[1:20:44] prayer it has a purpose because we're
[1:20:46] trying to bring the people to a place of
[1:20:48] maturity that the Rapture can take place
[1:20:50] we're waiting on the resurrection is
[1:20:52] waiting on the maturity of the Bride
[1:20:54] ofes Jesus Christ so how all of a sudden
[1:20:57] it has a purpose going and witnessing to
[1:20:58] somebody and help them grow it has a
[1:21:00] purpose sharing the word of God like
[1:21:02] Philip did when he went to the unit and
[1:21:04] he and he spoke to him God's word until
[1:21:06] a revelation could strike his heart it
[1:21:08] has a purpose friends don't you realize
[1:21:10] we're not just here to have church we're
[1:21:12] not just here to build a a tabernacle
[1:21:14] we're not here to take turns preaching
[1:21:16] we're not here to pass the time until we
[1:21:18] die we're here or to satisfy somebody's
[1:21:20] feelings but we're here to come to a
[1:21:23] place of maturity that it would call
[1:21:25] upon the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:21:28] this is what the church is here that's
[1:21:29] why we come to church to bring this
[1:21:31] portion of the field to the place of
[1:21:33] harvest that's our purpose at Grace
[1:21:35] Tabernacle to bring our portion of the
[1:21:37] field to the place of harvest that's my
[1:21:40] purpose as a pastor we got a portion of
[1:21:42] the field you know what you know what
[1:21:43] you see many times you look how some
[1:21:45] have been growing in the sun and it
[1:21:47] looks like my what in the world would be
[1:21:49] holding that up and and there ain't
[1:21:50] nothing that's holding it up you you're
[1:21:52] you're where you need to be but he ain't
[1:21:54] going to pick one here and then pick one
[1:21:56] another day and pick one in the Rapture
[1:21:58] but when the Rapture goes the whole
[1:22:00] bride goes so see so he's waiting on
[1:22:03] this church to come to a place of
[1:22:04] maturity but you know what sometimes
[1:22:06] maybe portions can I just say it like
[1:22:08] this maybe portions maybe portions of it
[1:22:11] has grown under the shadow of some some
[1:22:14] tree or something you know that's what
[1:22:16] happens sometimes you grew up under the
[1:22:18] shadow of something else or some great
[1:22:20] theology or some something that would
[1:22:22] overshadow the crop and would keep it
[1:22:23] from coming to the place of maturity
[1:22:25] maybe there's some over there that's
[1:22:27] already in the Sun but you've been kept
[1:22:28] out of the sun too long but you me tell
[1:22:30] you what we're doing we're coming into
[1:22:32] the church we come in the presence of
[1:22:34] God we take the message of the hour we
[1:22:36] preach it to the people so that you can
[1:22:38] get in the presence of the S Soom that
[1:22:40] the maturity of the Bride of Jesus
[1:22:42] Christ would come to its
[1:22:44] place so we come to church to get in the
[1:22:47] presence of God until the revelation of
[1:22:49] God's work and strick your heart and you
[1:22:51] come to a place of maturity that's why
[1:22:52] we're here to come to this place see but
[1:22:55] Paul says but it had to come in God's
[1:22:58] appointed time this adoption it's in a
[1:23:00] it's a time appointed of the father
[1:23:02] 1954 prophet of Goa say this and they
[1:23:05] that are sons of God are led by the
[1:23:06] spirit of
[1:23:09] God the sons of God are led by the
[1:23:11] spirit of God I love it how people twist
[1:23:14] that scripture I don't love it but but
[1:23:16] TW they they twist it and say well I'm a
[1:23:18] Son of God so no matter what I do I can
[1:23:20] say it's the spirit of God cuz after all
[1:23:22] I'm a Son of God therefore I'm being led
[1:23:23] by the spirit but that ain't what that
[1:23:24] scripture means it means the spirit of
[1:23:27] God is leading the sons of God so if
[1:23:29] you're off doing things and calling it
[1:23:30] God that ain't Godly it's not the spirit
[1:23:32] of God that's leading you hello
[1:23:35] somebody sons of God are led by the
[1:23:37] spirit of
[1:23:40] God then when the human element goes out
[1:23:42] the spirit of God fills the vacancy
[1:23:44] where you empty yourself then with a
[1:23:47] church when the church in its power of
[1:23:49] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will
[1:23:51] walk in his steps in his power in his
[1:23:53] thoughts in his being in his moving see
[1:23:56] then your thoughts will become words and
[1:23:58] your words will become material that's
[1:24:00] when the church is in its power he said
[1:24:03] and I believe it's on its road that when
[1:24:05] the church will be so wrapped in Christ
[1:24:07] the Holy Spirit mankind so away from
[1:24:09] their s that they don't see themselves
[1:24:11] they have they don't have nothing but to
[1:24:13] serve God and their thoughts they move
[1:24:16] on they refuse the things of the world
[1:24:17] they just move in the spirit live in the
[1:24:19] spirit move in the spirit walk in the
[1:24:21] spirit to fulfill the law of Christ then
[1:24:23] the love of Christ and the human heart
[1:24:24] moving in the Holy Ghost that great
[1:24:27] wonderful church will go forth with
[1:24:28] power and deity because deity will be
[1:24:30] revealed in human beings by the Holy
[1:24:32] Spirit bringing it to pass the thought
[1:24:35] of their mind now is't that something
[1:24:37] here he's speaking of deity being
[1:24:39] revealed in human beings in 1954 he said
[1:24:42] it's on its Road I see it coming to pass
[1:24:44] I see it down the road in other other
[1:24:46] words there it's a prophecy that here I
[1:24:49] I see it we're in that time but do you
[1:24:51] realize that today brother Javier that
[1:24:53] we're living in the age of fulfillment
[1:24:55] and I I can prove this by the word of
[1:24:57] God we're living in the age of
[1:24:59] fulfillment you think whenever when
[1:25:00] you're looking to come to this place of
[1:25:02] adoption you remember what brother B
[1:25:04] taught it this way that adoption can't
[1:25:06] I'll just I'll just say I'll just say it
[1:25:08] so you can understand it but adoption is
[1:25:10] not a birth it's not a birth a child
[1:25:13] comes he's born but and he's still a
[1:25:15] child but adoption is not a birth that
[1:25:17] that ain't what he taught matter of fact
[1:25:18] it's not even the Holy Ghost that's not
[1:25:20] that can't be the fullest of adoption so
[1:25:22] see because the Holy Ghost is is only an
[1:25:25] Earnest it's only a down payment see he
[1:25:27] said see the holy spirit is our seal
[1:25:29] somebody say our seal the earnest means
[1:25:32] more Is Yet To Come Glory Glory we only
[1:25:37] have the earnest of it now the earnest
[1:25:39] is just the down payment that holds it
[1:25:41] and secures it and anchors it so that no
[1:25:43] one else can touch it so it's the
[1:25:45] earnest of our adoption so you ain't got
[1:25:47] to worry about this adoption here when
[1:25:49] you receive the down payment it's the
[1:25:50] earnest that you'll come to the fullness
[1:25:52] of adoption so see it's the Earnest of
[1:25:54] our adoption so the holy spirit is now
[1:25:57] the earnest of God in our hearts sealed
[1:26:00] the adoption of the sons awaiting us at
[1:26:02] the end of the road to be Sons and
[1:26:05] Daughters of God see first said we're on
[1:26:08] the road I see it on the road now then
[1:26:10] in 1961 says see here we've already
[1:26:13] received the earnest of it and at the
[1:26:15] end of the road we're going to receive
[1:26:16] the fullness of it friends let me tell
[1:26:18] you when he would talk about this here
[1:26:20] that Paul said it would be a an
[1:26:22] appointed time when the time of adoption
[1:26:25] would come in other words that the
[1:26:26] Rapture couldn't take place 2,000 years
[1:26:28] ago I know you did you know that the
[1:26:30] that the saints of God 2,000 years ago
[1:26:32] were waiting for the Rapture the very
[1:26:34] day they went into the grave here 2,000
[1:26:36] years ago they were they were preaching
[1:26:38] what we're preaching as far as that
[1:26:40] we're looking for a Rapture and and and
[1:26:43] a 100 years later they still preached it
[1:26:44] we're waiting for a Rapture 200 years
[1:26:46] later they still preach it we're waiting
[1:26:48] for a Rapture a thousand years later
[1:26:49] they still preached it we're waiting for
[1:26:51] Rapture that's why Jesus said that no
[1:26:53] man knowth the date or the hour because
[1:26:56] you think of it if they would have known
[1:26:58] that God because the Bible would tell us
[1:27:00] that whenever they went into the grave
[1:27:01] the very thing that they expected when
[1:27:03] they went into the grave that they would
[1:27:05] wake up with that same expectation so
[1:27:07] here are the sons of God that when they
[1:27:09] would die and they'd be shwn asunder and
[1:27:11] they were expecting to meet God when
[1:27:13] they would wake up from the in the
[1:27:14] resurrection they would wake up under
[1:27:16] that same expectation it would be just a
[1:27:19] moment that they went to sleep and they
[1:27:20] wake back up and say Where's My Lord
[1:27:22] I've been waiting on him all this time
[1:27:24] said see but if God would have told them
[1:27:26] it would be 2,000 years later then they
[1:27:29] would have never went to sleep under
[1:27:30] that expectation so if they were to wake
[1:27:32] under an expectation then they'd have to
[1:27:34] sleep under that same expectation he say
[1:27:37] so so all the way through 2,000 years we
[1:27:39] don't know the date or the hour we don't
[1:27:41] know the time when the Lord will come
[1:27:43] but Paul said but there will come a time
[1:27:45] that is appointed to the father that the
[1:27:47] church will come to this place of
[1:27:48] adoption and the fullness of of adoption
[1:27:51] will come to pass and we'll be we'll see
[1:27:53] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:27:56] it's a time that is appointed of the
[1:27:57] father you say well so when is this time
[1:28:00] brother B say see first he said I see it
[1:28:02] on the road he said then we're going to
[1:28:03] see it right here at the end of the road
[1:28:05] but this wasn't at a random time can I
[1:28:07] can I do I got just a minute I I I can't
[1:28:10] skip this till next week but some of it
[1:28:11] I can but not this but but but but it's
[1:28:13] not a random time Paul said it was an
[1:28:15] appointed time remember he said see
[1:28:18] we're under tutors and governors until
[1:28:21] somebody say until until the time
[1:28:24] appointed of the father so here he's
[1:28:26] preaching in the first century
[1:28:27] prophesying of a time that this infant
[1:28:30] Church would come to a place of maturity
[1:28:32] he went through a whole a whole lesson
[1:28:34] on on maturity and in in an immature
[1:28:36] Church why he was talking to an infant
[1:28:38] Church saying they're going to come to
[1:28:40] this place of maturity said see so if
[1:28:42] God has an an appointed time and God has
[1:28:45] an appointed people then something that
[1:28:48] would have to take place if we're
[1:28:49] talking about adoption now hope you
[1:28:51] catch my where where I'm at but
[1:28:53] something would have to take take place
[1:28:54] that would bring the children to their
[1:28:57] father we're talking about adoption so
[1:29:00] here Paul said there Comes A Time an
[1:29:02] appointed time when the we'll be under
[1:29:04] tutors and governors until the time
[1:29:06] appointed of the father so then
[1:29:07] something's going to take place that'll
[1:29:09] bring the children to their father you
[1:29:11] think about what what Jesus says here
[1:29:13] you remember the parable in Luke 15 he
[1:29:15] he he he uh gave the parable of the
[1:29:17] Prodigal Son remember he was the one
[1:29:19] that went out and he squandered his
[1:29:20] inheritance can can you pre Ju Just can
[1:29:22] I have a minute he HED his inheritance
[1:29:25] and then because of the shap that he was
[1:29:27] in he made a purpose in his heart that
[1:29:28] I'll just go back to my daddy's house
[1:29:30] and be a servant cuz even a servant in
[1:29:32] My Father's House lives better than I'm
[1:29:33] living so he went back to the father's
[1:29:36] house but you notice that that whenever
[1:29:37] Jesus made this Parable that here not M
[1:29:40] this is good when Jesus made the parable
[1:29:42] you realize where he was but West see
[1:29:44] Jesus was in Palestine he was coming
[1:29:46] from a trip from Galilee on his way to
[1:29:49] Jerusalem now now you this is just fre
[1:29:52] this is free but he come from Galilee
[1:29:54] Jerusalem you know what Galilee means it
[1:29:55] means a chapel in Old English it means
[1:29:58] Chapel Jerusalem which means a the the
[1:30:00] city of peace or the city of God so here
[1:30:03] he was right in the middle on the way
[1:30:04] from church to Glory I wonder how many
[1:30:06] find oursel there sometimes but right in
[1:30:08] the middle of Galilee and Jerusalem here
[1:30:12] Jesus comes down in Palestine and he
[1:30:14] begins to uh tell this Pro the parable
[1:30:17] of the prodigal son now you notice
[1:30:19] whenever he told this Parable that
[1:30:20] wasn't the only Parable that he told
[1:30:22] first he told about a lost sheep and a
[1:30:24] Shepherd that went out and he found the
[1:30:25] sheep that was lost then he talks about
[1:30:27] a woman that had 10 coins and one of the
[1:30:29] coins was missing so she swept the house
[1:30:31] and went through the house to find the
[1:30:32] missing coin and add it back to the band
[1:30:35] and then he goes on and he preaches
[1:30:37] about the pro or he tells about the
[1:30:38] prodal son and how that he went out so
[1:30:40] you notice what Jesus is telling us he
[1:30:42] talks about a lost sheep a lost coin and
[1:30:45] a lost son right in the middle of
[1:30:47] Palestine here here he would come and
[1:30:49] say there a lost sheep a lost coin a
[1:30:51] lost son and then but notice what Jesus
[1:30:53] done is he showed us something about our
[1:30:56] God that makes him different than every
[1:30:58] other religion in the world you think
[1:30:59] about the religions of the world it's
[1:31:01] it's great deities in God that are
[1:31:03] waiting on people to come to them they
[1:31:05] build up a big statue and you have to go
[1:31:07] down before that statue and kneel down
[1:31:09] before him and where they put the statue
[1:31:11] that's where you got to go kneel down
[1:31:12] see so it's a deity that's always
[1:31:14] waiting on Humanity to come and find it
[1:31:17] but here what Jesus is doing to these
[1:31:19] par in this Parable remember he was
[1:31:21] talking to those publicans and or to to
[1:31:24] the the Pharisees and all that was
[1:31:25] attacking him for preaching to the
[1:31:27] publicans and and and and being around
[1:31:29] Sinners and and going around and talking
[1:31:31] to them kind of people and Jesus but
[1:31:32] what he shows us is our God is a
[1:31:35] different kind of deity that our God
[1:31:37] isn't waiting on us to come to him but
[1:31:39] our God goes and finds those that belong
[1:31:42] to him so he shows us a character of God
[1:31:45] when it came to the Sheep he went out
[1:31:46] and find it when it came to the corn she
[1:31:48] swept the house till she found it and
[1:31:50] replaced it when it came to the lost son
[1:31:53] the father ran to meet
[1:31:55] him so he shows us our God is different
[1:31:58] that's the way our God is that's the way
[1:32:00] Jesus done what happened with the woman
[1:32:02] at the well he said I got a need to go
[1:32:03] by Samaria what happened to the galeran
[1:32:06] the man that was filled with the legions
[1:32:07] of devils Jesus went down to where he
[1:32:09] was right to the tombs of where he was
[1:32:11] to call the devil out of the man and to
[1:32:13] set the man free this is our Jesus he's
[1:32:16] the same one that walked under the tree
[1:32:17] to find zachus there was hiding up there
[1:32:20] a Publican he said zachus come down I'm
[1:32:22] going to your house to today to have
[1:32:24] fellowship with you this is our God he
[1:32:27] don't leave us in our condition but
[1:32:29] he'll go right down to where we are and
[1:32:31] find us and call us out this is the kind
[1:32:33] of God that we serve he was the one that
[1:32:36] went down to the pool of be Bethesda and
[1:32:39] took the man that couldn't make his way
[1:32:40] to his healing and brought healing right
[1:32:42] to his
[1:32:43] doorstep This Is Our God he's a
[1:32:46] different kind of God that other people
[1:32:48] serve but notice here he was speaking in
[1:32:50] these Parables because the Pharisees
[1:32:52] here they were criticizing and him
[1:32:54] because he was he was he was in in
[1:32:58] Fellowship they would say with with
[1:33:00] Sinners and publicans but notice what
[1:33:03] Jesus is showing us that there comes an
[1:33:05] appointed time am I is that something an
[1:33:08] appointed time what was it where zakus
[1:33:10] it was an appointed time what was it
[1:33:12] with a woman at the well it was an
[1:33:13] appointed time how do you know she was
[1:33:14] going to be sitting there what what was
[1:33:16] it with that man that Legion it was an
[1:33:18] appointed time he said the there comes
[1:33:19] an appointed time and Jesus shows us
[1:33:21] that at this time is a time of of
[1:33:24] rejoicing remember what he said the back
[1:33:26] in when the Sheep came back to the fold
[1:33:29] he said Rejoice with me for I have found
[1:33:31] my sheep which was lost when the woman
[1:33:33] found the coin and put it back she said
[1:33:35] Rejoice with me for I have found my coin
[1:33:38] which was lost when he ran to the Sun
[1:33:40] and he put a robe on a robe on his
[1:33:42] shoulders and shoes on his feet and a
[1:33:44] ring on his hand you realize what all
[1:33:46] those are pertaining to they're
[1:33:47] pertaining to adoption to give him a to
[1:33:50] give him the shield of the father and
[1:33:52] put a robe on his shoulders that he
[1:33:53] would wear the father's clothes that
[1:33:55] when he would he wasn't he wouldn't
[1:33:56] allow him to come back as a servant he
[1:33:58] said you're a son even in the midst of
[1:34:01] of his failures he came to this think
[1:34:03] about it he come to this place he and
[1:34:05] then what he say he said bring the
[1:34:06] fatted Cal and and and kill it and let
[1:34:09] us be merried for my son was dead but
[1:34:11] he's alive again he was lost but he's
[1:34:13] found and the Bible said and they began
[1:34:15] to Rejoice so in this appointed time
[1:34:19] it's a time of rejoicing it's a time of
[1:34:22] adoption it's a time of God calling the
[1:34:24] church back to himself he said and in
[1:34:26] this time the church will be
[1:34:28] rejoicing think about what the Bible
[1:34:30] said John in Revelations 10 he said when
[1:34:33] the seven Thunders had uttered their
[1:34:34] voices I was about to write but I Heard
[1:34:36] a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal
[1:34:38] up those things which the seven Thunders
[1:34:40] uttered and write them not think about
[1:34:42] here John saw what was taking place in
[1:34:44] the end time but the angel said seal it
[1:34:47] up and don't ride it but notice this
[1:34:49] seal was not an everlasting seal it was
[1:34:51] only until Glory it was only until in
[1:34:55] the seventh verse he said but in the
[1:34:57] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:34:59] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:35:01] of God should be finished as he has
[1:35:03] declared to his servants the prophets
[1:35:05] can I read that from an amplified Bible
[1:35:07] in other word he said God's mystery or
[1:35:09] his hidden
[1:35:10] purpose he had announced through his
[1:35:13] servants the prophets would be
[1:35:15] accomplished or completed so in the days
[1:35:18] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:35:19] he shall begin to sound God's hidden
[1:35:22] purpose in other words the time that was
[1:35:24] appointed to the father that his hidden
[1:35:27] purpose or his secret design would be
[1:35:29] accomplished here's what the Bible said
[1:35:31] it's an appointed time when his hidden
[1:35:33] purpose would be revealed can I I'm I'm
[1:35:35] going to skip can I just can I just say
[1:35:36] it here here's the Revelation the angel
[1:35:38] of Revelations 107 and the me and the
[1:35:41] the messenger of Malachi 4 and 5 is the
[1:35:43] same one this is the this is the same
[1:35:46] the same person that would come that God
[1:35:47] would use in this office you say so what
[1:35:49] was the purpose of the Malachi 4
[1:35:51] messenger how many how many members what
[1:35:53] it was us it was to turn the heart of
[1:35:56] the children to their
[1:35:59] fathers we're talking about adoption
[1:36:01] we're talking about coming back to the
[1:36:03] father we're talking about coming to a
[1:36:05] place of maturity this was the very
[1:36:06] purpose of Malachi 4 it was to bring the
[1:36:09] church to the place of adoption it was
[1:36:11] to take children and turn them back to
[1:36:13] their father oh my makes me want to
[1:36:14] shout you think about what that's why
[1:36:16] the prophet of God would preach his
[1:36:18] message was not the same thing there was
[1:36:20] it differed than that of zza Street
[1:36:22] Pentecost because there was lot of
[1:36:23] baptisms that take place in Pentecost
[1:36:25] but they wouldn't carry on into the word
[1:36:27] of God in other words that's why he
[1:36:29] would use this term so many times of
[1:36:31] Pentecostal babies how many you ever
[1:36:33] heard that Pentecostal babies in other
[1:36:35] words they wouldn't come into the
[1:36:36] maturity of the word of God they'd
[1:36:39] receive a baptism they receive it in the
[1:36:41] in in in Jesus name but they never come
[1:36:43] to the maturity of the word so it was
[1:36:46] called that so so he shows us how that
[1:36:48] it would take the revelation of the word
[1:36:51] to manifest adopted sons of God it would
[1:36:54] take so it would take a revealed word
[1:36:56] that's why my I ran out of time that's
[1:36:59] why that's why that's why it bothers you
[1:37:02] as a as a as a as a pastor as as a
[1:37:05] minister whenever whenever somebody acts
[1:37:07] like we don't need the doctrine and we
[1:37:09] we don't need church and they'll go
[1:37:11] fellowship with some some Pentecost
[1:37:14] non-denominational church or something
[1:37:15] and then get up there and tell them we
[1:37:17] we don't need doctr we we just we just
[1:37:19] want to we just want to be all brothers
[1:37:20] and all this stuff but it'll take the
[1:37:22] doctrine it takes the message of the
[1:37:24] hour to bring the adoption to the church
[1:37:26] there'll never be a Rapture without it
[1:37:28] so how can we say we don't need it it's
[1:37:30] a must have we must have it this is what
[1:37:34] the purpose it'll take a revelation of
[1:37:36] the word to manifest adopted Sons it
[1:37:38] takes a Malachi 4 a Baptist preacher can
[1:37:40] preach A good sermon make you feel good
[1:37:42] and many many will be have everlasting
[1:37:44] life because of it but we're talking
[1:37:46] about the rapturing of the Bride of
[1:37:47] Jesus Christ this is a different thing
[1:37:50] we're talking about that that'll never
[1:37:51] take place under a Baptist message it'll
[1:37:53] never take place under a Pentecostal
[1:37:55] message it can only take place according
[1:37:57] to the Bible under the message of
[1:37:59] Malachi 4 that's the only thing that'll
[1:38:01] ever turn the children's Hearts back to
[1:38:03] the fathers it's the only it I'll just
[1:38:06] make it plain the message is the only
[1:38:08] thing that will it's the only thing
[1:38:10] that'll bring you to a place of adoption
[1:38:11] it's the shout of first Thessalonians 4
[1:38:14] you say well brother matth the church
[1:38:15] has been shouting since 1906 that's a
[1:38:17] different kind of shout they sure have
[1:38:20] you know what you can have you can have
[1:38:21] a whole bunch of churches without the
[1:38:22] message you have a whole bunch of
[1:38:24] shouting churches without the message
[1:38:25] but what you'll never have is you'll
[1:38:27] never have a rapturing church without
[1:38:28] the message you'll never have that yes
[1:38:31] sir see in the layot to see in church
[1:38:32] age so now this messenger of Malachi 4
[1:38:35] and Revelations 10:7 is going to do two
[1:38:38] things one according to Malachi 4 he
[1:38:40] will turn the hearts of the children to
[1:38:41] the fathers two he will reveal the
[1:38:43] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:38:44] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[1:38:47] contained in the Seven Seals and it will
[1:38:48] be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:38:51] truths that literally turn the hearts of
[1:38:53] the children to their Pentecostal
[1:38:55] fathers see you need those truths you
[1:38:58] need the revelation of the word of God
[1:39:00] see it it's it'll take the message to
[1:39:03] bring the children to this place of
[1:39:04] adoption you said well brother mat not
[1:39:07] everybody believes that but you don't
[1:39:08] you realize that that's the of course
[1:39:10] that's true we're talking about the
[1:39:11] message of melachi 4 who was a type
[1:39:13] after John the Baptist a type after
[1:39:15] Elijah you know what happened in the
[1:39:17] days of John and Elijah the Bible would
[1:39:19] would would tell us the stories but here
[1:39:21] here here the people in these in these
[1:39:24] day in in the days of of Ahab being the
[1:39:27] king in John's said see it was only it
[1:39:30] was not it was only the children whose
[1:39:32] Hearts would be turned remember in the
[1:39:34] days of Ahab there was only 7,000 true
[1:39:36] seed Israelites although there was all
[1:39:38] kinds that was born to Israel but
[1:39:39] remember what God said I had 7,000 that
[1:39:41] never bowed a need to Bell there was
[1:39:42] only 7,000 in the days of John there was
[1:39:44] a very few the masses in both ages here
[1:39:47] in the L to see in church age the masses
[1:39:48] in both Ages were in fornication and
[1:39:51] idolatry so you're not going to have the
[1:39:53] whole world is going to believe what you
[1:39:55] believe not the whole world is going to
[1:39:57] see what you see not the whole world his
[1:39:59] Hearts is going to be turned to the
[1:40:00] father they're not going to be turned
[1:40:02] just like it was in the days of John
[1:40:04] just like it was in the Days of Elijah
[1:40:06] and Ahab said but but there will be some
[1:40:08] children that's what the Bible said but
[1:40:10] the children's Hearts they'll be turned
[1:40:12] to their father they'll be turned back
[1:40:14] to God the fullness of the word of God
[1:40:17] that'll be manifested in them again not
[1:40:19] be filled up with with what men have
[1:40:21] came up with of what church ought to be
[1:40:23] and how they they they they they they
[1:40:25] they shift it and shape it you realize
[1:40:27] how much it's changed over the years I I
[1:40:29] can tell you this right now it's changed
[1:40:30] all you have to do is go back and look
[1:40:32] at a picture of America in 1920 or 1930
[1:40:36] or 1940 even in 1950 that that that a
[1:40:39] woman in Jonesboro Arkansas in the 1950s
[1:40:42] was arrested and put on trial had to pay
[1:40:44] a fine for wearing shorts out in public
[1:40:46] and you know what and not there wasn't a
[1:40:47] single Christian Church in the world
[1:40:49] that you could go and dress the way you
[1:40:51] do and act the way you do today it
[1:40:53] matter if he was a Methodist or a
[1:40:54] Baptist or a Church of Christ or a
[1:40:56] Pentecost it didn't matter what kind of
[1:40:57] church you were back then they all they
[1:40:59] all were decent and believed in Holiness
[1:41:02] but watch men's Minds changed because of
[1:41:05] society I had a lady tell me that she
[1:41:06] said well that scripture don't apply
[1:41:08] anymore about women dress in that way
[1:41:10] and I don't mean to be here but but that
[1:41:12] that don't apply anymore I said well why
[1:41:14] don't it apply she said because Society
[1:41:16] has changed it I said how can society
[1:41:19] change the word of God that was written
[1:41:21] 2,000 years ago before Society ever came
[1:41:24] to this place before a man ever changed
[1:41:26] the rules before he ever changed the law
[1:41:29] in a book do you realize that the church
[1:41:30] books that they read have laws in them
[1:41:32] that in 1940 the law is not the same as
[1:41:35] it is today now they allow homosexuals
[1:41:37] in the pulia and pastor and churches are
[1:41:39] divided over why because they change the
[1:41:42] law day after day so there has to come a
[1:41:44] time how can God come and get something
[1:41:46] that changes at the idea of every man or
[1:41:49] the feeling of every man but he's
[1:41:51] waiting on a church to come to a place
[1:41:52] of adoption to a place of maturity that
[1:41:55] can receive the fullness of the word of
[1:41:57] God and be manifested Sons and Daughters
[1:42:00] of God he's calling us to a place of
[1:42:03] maturity we're not always children we
[1:42:05] mature in the word of God some are
[1:42:08] afraid of it I'm for matter I'm afraid
[1:42:10] afraid of that I'm afraid of this
[1:42:12] message afraid to be identified with it
[1:42:14] but you realize it's the only thing
[1:42:15] that'll bring you to adoption but isn't
[1:42:17] that why Paul said this can I read you
[1:42:18] something as we close isn't that why
[1:42:20] Paul said but as many as are led by the
[1:42:22] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:42:24] for you have not received the spirit of
[1:42:26] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:42:29] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:42:31] we cry Abba Father what does the spirit
[1:42:33] of adoption do it causes you to believe
[1:42:36] this message that is bringing you to a
[1:42:39] place of maturity listen prodigals you
[1:42:42] don't have to be afraid you can Rejoice
[1:42:46] for the father killed the fatted calf
[1:42:48] you don't have to live in fear he robed
[1:42:50] you with righteousness and the Bible
