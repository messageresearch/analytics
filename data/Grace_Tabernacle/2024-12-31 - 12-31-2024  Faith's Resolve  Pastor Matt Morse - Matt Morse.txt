breaks them but aren't you happy tonight that Jesus Christ was more than just a New Year's resolution amen he did something in my heart I never be the same again I thank him for it amen I've employed

hold you very long tonight I know we come to Fellowship but we want the we want the Lord just to have Liberty to move and since nobody else has anywhere to go after church then I ain't got nothing to worry about amen and so I I just feel good today and just uh uh thinking about I spent the day just reflecting and on all the things that God has done for us this year and uh it's just been a just a mighty time of testimony I I wonder how many if we could pass the mic around would have something to share that God's done for them this year amen how many how many would amen well just after church y'all tell somebody about it then don't keep it to yourself if you got that kind of testimony I think we need to let everybody know amen so we're going to have all night to Fellowship so we'll just give everybody Liberty to move around the fellowship hall and just tell somebody what the Lord's done for you amen how many do that that's what we're here for anyway it's a a gathering of Hearts so we just love the Lord and we thank him for all he's done so we maybe we just sing this song as we have prepared to bring the word tonight oh I love you Lord oh your mercy never fails me all my days I've

thank you for it now in Jesus name we pray and the church said amen amen you love the Lord tonight amen won't we just invite you to the scripture and and we're going to read out of the book of second Corinthians uh tonight out of the fourth chapter 2 Corinthians 4th chapter and then we'll read read uh from the eth verse and give you just a moment to get there and my it's just a privilege to come on a special service like this amen and and the Lord's just been so good to us and here we are at the end of a year and uh my the the the church has grown so much this year and and uh and and not not just uh grown in numbers we don't mean that but just grown uh in in Revelation and our faith and uh he's done so much for us so we just thank God for all he's done for us this year and so we want to read out of the book of second Corinthians the 4th chapter and we'll start in the eth verse we're going to read through the 13th verse and and uh we just have a good time in the Lord tonight amen how many how many's okay with that just something I don't believe any of God's I know we say sometimes it's simple but I don't believe any of it is uh it may be simple to us but it has great meaning amen so uh it is the word of God is a value to uh so we don't want to be little anything in the word but just the Lord put this uh uh thought on my heart tonight so I just want to be able to do my best to bring it to you but we want to read out of the eth verse the Bible said we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed how many can say Amen how many's been through that there we can all find our place in that scripture but Paul said always bearing about in the body of the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body said for we which Li live are always delivered unto death for Jesus's sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh in other words we're going to die to the flesh that the spirit or the life of God may be able to dwell in us so then death worketh in us but life in you for we have having the same Spirit of Faith as it was written in the scripture I believed therefore have I spoken and then Paul says we also believe and therefore we speak amen so I just want to ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word and I'd like to speak tonight on Faith's resolve Faith's resolve here uh of course we're winding up a new year you know I thought about this ending of a year and how that we find oursel in the Final Chapter and uh you know uh uh the final chapter of 2024 and you know if you if you sit down and maybe any of you's ever read a a a good book you know you get to the end of the book and you get to the final chapter and uh at the end of it when you close the book and you walk away brother Wesley there's the the last scenes of that final chapter they Linger on your mind and you know you can go outside and it just kind of something that always that lingers there for a little while and you know I thought that's the way it is here we're closing the book on a new year and you know it seems like sometimes that we'll just go over into the new year and everything's going to stay in 2024 and all the bad it's going to stay back there and all the the problems are going to stay back there and all the trials there everything that you went through but but you know all the things that may seem like it'd be behind you but you know just as it is when you close uh the chapter there's things that still Linger on there's the effects of the things that we went through in last year they uh they'll Linger on into next year you know the the decisions that you made last year they're going to they're going to have a lingering effect into next year some of the the trials and the uh things that you went through last year the effects of those trials they're going to linger you know they Linger on they linger in your mind they carry on into another year and I thought you know but wouldn't it be something tonight to be able to close the book on a year and when you close the book on it that that all those bad decisions was left back there and all those trials was left back there and all the how many would like to do that tonight to be able to just close the book on it and when you close it that all the things you done wrong and all the failures and all the the past that Brother David whenever you close the book tonight that it don't have to be reread it don't have to be something that's lingered and all those lingering thoughts and feelings and all the former troubles they could be forgotten and left back there and and you could go on into another year and and be able to to live in the grace of God I thought that'd be a wonderful thing tonight to be able to do you know and so I read this scripture Apostle Paul he says see he said we're troubled on every side and we're perplexed you know I thought we're troubled and we're perplexed in other words we're sometimes we're confused as of why the trouble has come our way we we find oursel in many troubles and he said but yet this comes but we're not in despair even when we're person persecuted we're not cast down when we're forsaken yet we're not destroyed so it doesn't matter what we've all been through this year but brother wesy we're all still here and we're not God hadn't kicked us out are you glad of that tonight he hadn't kicked you to the curb he hadn't done away with you he hadn't put you away I know sometimes people like to do that with one another but aren't you glad that God didn't put us away and he he hadn't kicked us out we've not been destroyed Brother David but here we are as a body of Believers on the last day of the year whenever many said we wouldn't make it and we wouldn't make it this this far we wouldn't make it this long but here we are anyway and we're standing in the grace of God in the middle of Grace Tabernacle talking about the wonderful works of a mighty God and and here staring at at a body of Believers that the grace of God has fellen upon their life isn't that a wonderful place to be tonight he say see we he said we we've been we having the same Spirit of Faith there's a reason why Paul said oh we're in we're this way he said because we have the spirit of Faith as it is written I believe therefore I have spoken he said therefore we also believe and we also therefore speak how many say Amen to that we are believers therefore we speak you know I thought of this tonight here here to have a resolve a resolve means to to decide firmly on a course of action or to declare and to declare it by a formal resolution how many know that's what taking place today all around the world today there's many resolutions that are being made I I looked at an online poll this evening and or or or or this afternoon it was talking about all the top resolutions that were taking place in the in the United States you know what people ask for they all the top ones it was it was they'd have more time with their family they would be able this year I'm going to volunteer more and Ne or or next year I'm going to cut back on my drinking and I'm G I'm G I'm G to get myself a new hobby and I'm going to I'm going to re remodel my house and I'm going to quit smoking and get a new career save money I'm going to lose weight I read through all the things that people wanted to do for next year you know and I'm I'm going to hit the gym I'm going to B bulk up and I'm going to get my body in shape and my I'm going to get stronger and more fit and I'm going to I'm going to be doing more of that and I'm going to feel better than I felt next year or last year and I'm going to have a better version of me in 2025 isn't that isn't that what everybody wants and you know as I got to reading that I thought you know I wasn't surprised at everything that made the list but brother Wesley I was concerned with the things that didn't make the list this was the top 10 things that everybody in America wanted for next year and I thought you know they're all good things maybe we all need to I couldn't find any of them that wouldn't be a bad idea to do but you know I I was concerned about what didn't make it you know because as I read across that list for the Wesley I found out that there was nothing on that list that was Everlasting there wasn't one thing on there that had an everlasting effect they were they were everyone focused on the natural man they talked about natural things and they talked about carnality and I thought you know here here it is that these Natural Things obviously natural things are important I realize that they they have some value in our lives we ought to we ought to consider sometimes the things that we go with we ought to we want to we want to have a good job we want to manage our finances we want to show up for work we want to take care of our family you realize those are all natural things but they're good things and I believe that we ought to all do that I it wouldn't it be a sad thought to have a a dad that wouldn't take care of his family or wouldn't that he would neglect them he would mismanage the uh the family's money or wasteful spending he'd buy cigarettes and alcohol and gambling and wasting all their money on material things and then the the family being neglect because of what the father would do and the the whole time he's praying with God would you bless my family friends let me tell you God can't bless your family until you get out of the way and let God bless your family see see God is looking for a way to bless your family he's looking for a way in and many times we allow these material things to stop God from doing what God wants to do with us I think about most people I don't mean to give you a financial lesson but you know what it's it's New Year's Eve we may as well go there but but but but most people that's what all the businesses are doing today they're taking checks and balances to see where they are but most people get into trouble because they because they look at what other people have and they have a desire you ever see social media today it's great with display and what I have it ain't it ain't about telling somebody happy birthday it's letting the world know that you told them happy birthday I if you really wanted to tell somebody happy birthday you'd call them and say brother I love you and I just want to wish you it'd be it'd be but everything's an announcement it that's the way it is today and I I thought how but that people they write so many things and people have a desire to have what other people have but the problem is is the devil has made it easy for you to obtain the things that other people have even though you can't afford to have it and so then you wind up getting yourself in trouble and you get you're get in a great bind and then you get so bound up naturally that you can't move spiritually and you get so behind in the natural you may as well let me preach tonight it's the gospel truth you get so bound up in the natural because nobody had enough to tell you brother don't covet what thy neighbor has that's the tenth commandment don't cover what thy neighbor has don't cover his house don't cover his Ox don't cover his sheep don't covet the land that he has don't covet what your neighbor has you know what the Bible you know why the Bible said not to covet what thy neighbor has the Bible says don't covet it because a covet is a longing desire to have what somebody else has and if you long to or have a longing desire to have it then you just lo and behold in a little while you're going to make sure that you get it and then you're going to wind up in trouble and you're going to wind up up all bound up and you and you can't be free in the spirit that's why that's why Jesus would preach this he took that very tenth commandment and he preached it to the disciples he said take heed and beware of covetousness for a man's life consists not in the abundance of things which he possesses Now watch how Jesus Takes this from the natural and he turns it to the spiritual he says your life is not a sum of everything that you possess in the natural he said but but but your life what we ought to do is we ought to take no thought for our life and what we shall eat and nether for the body and what you shall put on isn't that something Jesus said don't take no thought about your life don't take thought about what you eat don't take thought about your body don't take thought about what you're putting on or the clothes that you go wear but isn't it something that the very things he said don't take thought of is the thing that people think about the whole time they're sitting in church most the people come in the house of God they're thinking about their life and they're thinking about their problem and they're thinking about their bills and they're thinking about going clothes shopping or what this person's wearing or what that person's wearing or what we're going to eat when we get out of church I thought isn't it something here The Very thing he said don't think about is what's on the m mind of everybody but Jesus turned it he said don't think about those natural things he said for your life is more than meat and your body is more than Ren for consider the raven that has no barns to be able to build up and and and to be able to harvest fruit and build up his barns he said but the Lord feeds the Raven and how much more valuable are you to God than a bird is valuable he said consider the Lily that even in Solomon's fine Glory has never been anybody a raid like the Lily was a raid he said but God he would one that he would take the Lily it would live and then the next day tomorrow it'd be cast into the oven and if God would clothe the Lily then how much more would he clothe you he said seek not what you shall eat or what you shall drink neither be of a doubtful mind but notice what God is doing here's a transformation taking it's taking place tonight here's a transformation how many like to be transformed it's a transformation that is taking place what is he doing he's trying to get our mind in order Jesus said don't don't put these things take no thought on these things don't put them things in front of God he said you know in other words Jesus said for your father knows that you have need of those things but notice what he does but if you will seek the kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you you know what Jesus says think about this in other words God don't want you to seek the kingdom of God so you can be without this is way people paint the picture seek the kingdom of God you don't have to you don't have to worry about the job you don't you just go to church you don't have to worry about work you don't they make all all these things but but it it wasn't to seek the kingdom of God so that you couldn't be provided for he said but seek the kingdom of God and then all of these things will be added unto you in other words that God says seek the kingdom of God not that you wouldn't be or that you would do without but that your life would be in a proper order and Jesus said fear not for it is the Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom isn't that wonderful aren't you glad you have a rich daddy somebody turn to somebody by them and say I got a rich Daddy it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and we have a daddy that owns the cattle the Bible said a father that owns the cattle on a thousand hills I believe he's a God that has the that has the ability to give gifts how many believe that tonight somebody say he's a Gift Giver he's a God that has the ability to give you what you have need of so when you come to the house of God tonight you come prepared to be able to receive what God has for you I think he's a god that is rich in Mercy he's a god that is rich in Grace he's a god that is Rich the Bible said he's rich in his glory I thought you know if God was to give us a gift tonight what would be a great gift that God could give to a body of Believers with all the riches that he could give what would be a great gift let me let me tell you what Paul said he said whenever he when he wrote to the Ephesians he said I am a prisoner of Jesus Christ he was a man that was bound to the cause of Christ Brother David he was a man that had a history of KN knowing what it was to Once being a prisoner to the flesh but now he was a prisoner to Christ he said I was a prisoner to the world I was the worst Christian that there ever was but Jesus he CAU me and he won me he converted me and now I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ I'm I'm no longer a prisoner of the devil but I'm a prisoner of him and he said by Grace I was saved I was called of God for this cause and now I bow down on my knees before God and here Paul is praying for the people of God here a man that was called of God a prophet of God that was called to be the uh to be the uh the prophet for the gentile people here here here he would call he said I'm down on my knees and I'm praying for you you know what Paul asked for he said that God would Grant you according to the riches of his glory we're talking about a rich God a god that is able to give Paul said but I'm praying that God would give you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his Spirit In Your Inner Man of all the great gifts that God could give Paul said I'm praying that he would strengthen your inner man he knew what it would take for a Believer to make it through the trials in the oncoming days he knew knew through the oncoming ages what it would take for a Believer to make it through the tribulations that they would face and and through the tests that they would have to go through and Paul said I pray that God would strengthen you in your inner man it was his desire that you would have something that would get you through when Paul wasn't there it would that God would give you something that would get you through when the pastor wasn't around that God would give you something that would get you through when your mama wasn't there no more and we when you was all alone living out in the world and Satan was coming against you he said I want you to have something that could cause you to be able to win the battle it's a gift that God would give you in all of the riches of his glory I pray that he'll give you strength in your inner man a strength to be able to withstand think about it what Paul was a man that knew what it was like to battle the flesh can I preach it he knew what it was like to battle the Flesh and so Paul said here he said when I would do good evil is present with me here was a man that that knew he he went through trials just like you and I face but you know what he prayed for he said that God would strengthen the inner man in other words that has to be something that could help you face these great trials you know I thought about how you know the number one resol resolution this year was exercise it was the strengthen the Natural Body I thought but whenever you read Paul's resolve it wasn't about strengthen the natural man he said but what we really need is to strengthen the spiritual man you know cuz sometimes this man is in the flesh and sometimes he's in the spirit what we need is a strength of the spiritual man I know sometimes we get in the flesh and Friends most of the time I just say it like this all the time when you get the flesh that's whenever you get in trouble you remember Samson when he got in the trouble is because of the because he was out there in the flesh and he went out and he set people's fields on fire and he wound up laying in the lap of of Delilah he got in all kinds of wrecks in his life because he was in the flesh but then the Bible would say but then the spirit of the Lord fell mightily upon him and when the spirit of the Lord fell on him all of a sudden he done the works of God he done Mighty works of God he was a judge over Israel he he drove out those that didn't belong in the land because the spirit of the Lord fell upon him see sometimes We're In the Flesh sometimes we're in the spirit and I think what happens is some sometimes I'm just preaching a New Year's Eve sermon so y'all just going have to give me the grace to do it but sometimes we get so much in the flesh that we can't get free no more sometimes we're so bound up in the spirit in our spirit that that we're not even who we really are you can't you you you used to praise God used to come to church ready to have church you used to bring your Bible to church God forbid people do that today but you used to come prayed up and ready to get in an atmosphere in the presence of God that the Holy Ghost could come by that you could worship in the presence of God it wasn't just a place to go to fellowship with one another but it was a place to have communion with God but we get so caught up in our spirit and things of this life they that we allow them to get in they build up and before long we got these great mountains that's built up in our life that there ain't no way you could come in in a service and a song leader knock it out of there there ain't no way you can just depend on a preacher to come and tear it all down but there has to something has to happen in order for that to be moved out of our life things get great they get built up great things but you realize you say well how they get there it's because we have gateways in our life just like our flesh we have gateways the gates of the flesh see tastes feel smell and here so so it's the same way with our spirit in our spirit we have gates to our spirit it was imagination and conscience and and memory and reasoning and affections and all these things are gateways I I think how how it is that that that people build up these great mountains you realize how easy it is to build up a mountain from your imagination all you have to do is think about what somebody did when they walk by you or what somebody said or and before long our imagination takes over and we build up mountains against another person or Mountain that keeps you from having Fellowship mountains that keep you from being able to feel free in the house of God because the our imagination is an easy way to pile up a stone on a mountain reasoning is a stone on the mountain brother Jared to to take the word well I know that's word it may be good for that brother but after all he's a preacher and I'm not so I don't think that could apply to me it's easy to reason things out of your reach and add stones to the mountain we build these things up the prophet of God said he said see it's your mind that opens the door to those things and closes the door he said it listen your mind listens to your conscience it listens to your memory it listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to those things and you'll let God but when you let God and the spirit of his word come in it'll blow the rest of the stuff out every doubt will be gone amen somebody every fear will be gone every sensation of Doubt every feeling is gone there ain't nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that how many say Amen isn't it wonderful to have something that Satan can't battle against he he said how can we get there well we need the strength in our inner man we need to be strengthened to where that where we can be able to stand against the devil when he would come and try to build these things up in our life you say well well brother man how how how can we overcome the devil in that way it's by our faith how many knows that's what the Bible teaches it's by it's by our faith the Bible and the Bible says that we have a way to obtain Faith so it's not something that is far-fetched that you can't have freedom is not something that's far-fetched that you can't have Liberty in the house of God is not something far-fetched that you can't have but it's something that is attainable to every believer say how do I get it notice he said well we have to have faith the Bible says faith cometh by the hearing of the word of God how many believe that amen you know what happens when a man has Faith he can do the things that are seem impossible because he has Faith so Faith notice what all the things Faith does the Bible says faith Shields you and remember it was our part of the Statue of a perfect man it's a shield it guards you from from unbelief your faith guards you from things that would come in from the outside and how the enemy is always looking for a way in but our faith guards us from those things he said in in Ephesians 2 Paul said even he said you're saved by grace through faith so we think about our faith we're shielded by faith we're Saved By Faith we're healed by faith we believe by faith we walk by faith we live by faith we die by faith if we Rapture out this world we're going to Rapture by faith that's the only way that's that's that's God's program that that's how God operates in the in the body of Believers is by faith in him that's what took Goliath or or David down to the down to the field of Goliath to be able to stand against that great big giant is because he had Faith remember what remember how but B tells that story I love it he said he went down there and he picked up five five Stones it was F AI t h you said well what kind of faith that that David had that would cause him to be able to stand against a giant well let me just tell you we we may as well preach anyway but but what what would he have let me let me tell you what happened see before David had ever went to face Goliath David had a meeting with a Prophet by the name of Samuel how many remember that here when he was just a little 15year old boy and Samuel had went into the town of Bethlehem and he called upon Jesse and I can just see Samuel walking in there as he called on he said I have I saw a vision from the Lord and hear that old Prophet come into that town and around you can just see the prophet had you know had that belt around him I I just picture it this way but he had that old belt around him and had that horn of oil on his side and here he walking that long robe and walked into town and he had a vision from the Lord he went and called upon Jesse said tell Jesse to bring his sons cuz God has called me to do something in this city so Jesse came and brought the sons and they come down to the place there and Samuel began to talk to him he said the Lord has told me that one of your son is going to be the king over all of Israel well imagine what what Jesse must have thought he said well here's my fine son he must be the one and samon said no that wasn't the one in the vision well what about this one no that wasn't one in the vision with this one he's built up quite a kingdom what about him he's got quite a business what about him no it wasn't him he's not the one in the vision and after a little while he said I ain't got no I only got one more son little old David out there Shepherd and the Sheep he Ian he ain't never going to make nothing out of nothing he he he ain't got the mind like these other guys have and you know they might could build him up a pretty good denomination but this David I don't know what we what we' do with him but but samon said well bring him out and when he came he said that's the one I saw in the vision see a prophet came with a vision of the Lord to anoint him to be the king over Israel and you notice what David done the Bible tells us how when he would come down before Samuel and David had to kneel down before the prophet and the anointing oil that was in the Horn of the prophet he opened it up brother and he dumped it over the head of David he said by the word of the Lord he he gave me a vision and the and by the word of the Lord you shall be the king over all of Israel let me tell you something friends when David stood up from that very place he was anointed to be the king of Israel he was a 15y old Shepherd but he was still anointed to be king of Israel he took back let me tell you what David done he took the scraggly clothes that he was wearing in his little old scraggly bag and he walked right back down to the sheep that was on the hill but he was still the anointed king over all of Israel I thought it didn't matter where David went he was anointed to be king it didn't matter if he went to the field he was anointed to be king it didn't matter if he faced the lion he was anointed to be king it didn't matter if he faced to Bear he was anointed to be king and it didn't matter what happened when he went down to the field of Goliath cuz David was an anointed man of God and anointed to be the king over all of Israel those people get so discouraged and we get mixed up and we get concerned with the battle because we have great Giants in our lives but let me tell you friends the real Victory it wasn't won in the valley standing down there with Goliath the real Victory it wasn't one in the valley of Eli the real Victory it wasn't one in the presence of all the armies of Israel it wasn't a great public Victory but the real victory that David won is when he surrendered to the anointing of the prophet of God it was when he knelt down on his knees and allowed the prophet of God to pour out the anointing of the Lord Jesus upon his life that would raise up and be the king or be what God had called him to be because he surrendered to the anointing because he believed what God said about him because he believed thus sayith the Lord that's where the real victory was won and then it didn't matter feel like preaching then it didn't matter where he went it didn't matter what devil would come against him it didn't matter what giant that he fac because he had he had been anointed by the prophet of God to be the king he could walk in the valley he could walk before Giants he could face any enemy me because he had been anointed that's what we need tonight we need faith in the anointed word that's been poured over our life you realize what David had he had faith in the anointed word that old giant was stand up there oh you send me a little boy like this well what a joke you are to send me a boy but David didn't care what he said he said how dare you defy the armies of the Living God you come to me with spear and a sword but I come to you in the name of the Lord he never feared why didn't he fear because he was anointed by the prophet of God he surrendered to the prophet's anointing and from the horn think about it from the Horn of a prophet he poured it over him that's what we need tonight from the Horn of a prophet the word of God has been spoke over our life from the Horn of a prophet you've been anointed in this hour to overcome from the Horn of a prophet it wasn't just something some man-made thought but from the Horn of a prophet you've been anointed to be able to overcome and lay all to see it that's what we need tonight is the faith in the anointed word of God pouring over us that we can believe all things are possible do matter what the giant says Jesus said if you have the faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say to what to this mountain be removed and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible to you somebody say Amen how many believe that nothing shall be impossible to you you know what that tells me what makes me feel like preaching faith that faith slays Giants and Faith moves mountains is't that something in other words so you you when you come you have mountains in our life there's mountains that's been built up these great mountains of imagination and mountains of reasoning and mountains of con all these things that's been built up in our spirit but let me ask you a question tonight how many Believers are in this building raise your hand I want I want to I want to know I want to know where you're pretty much all of them a hundred or so Believers s see but not just any kind of believer I'm talking about real Believers how many real Believers are here you you want to know what a real believer is let me read it to you real quick before you commit to it but said a true or a spiritual believer is one that has been baptized into the body of Christ and is a member of him so we're not a member of a church but we've been baptized not by water but by the spirit of God and we've been baptized into the body of Christ by his spirit and now we are a member of him how many believers do we have here tonight says so then when the word of God comes into you it's made manifest for you are a Believer says see and a Believer is how many wants to know this he said a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you what a statement the believer is the faith of God that moves in you let me ask you this so if the faith of God is moving in you because you're a Believer if the faith of God is moving you then or in you then what is it moving Glory what's it moving it's moving Every Mountain it's moving every giant it's moving every trial it's moving every spirit that Satan would would try to put up your life because the faith of God is moving in you it the faith isn't resting in it it isn't sitting in you the faith of God is moving in you you realize so when Satan would come there's something in you that would move it would it would act against the spirit that would come upon the believer let me tell you what we have tonight we have a God that has something moving in the heart of every believer that when Satan would try to come in there's something that's moving out against you I say let God let go and let God move tonight let him move in every heart let him move in every life let him push out every enemy let him move Every Mountain out of your life that you could be free in the presence of God it's a faith that is moving in you to move out everything that don't belong said what does it do it establishes you as a Believer that's what faith does the Bible says so believe in the Lord your God so that you shall be established believe his Prophet so you shall prosper God has given us a way to be able to stand just like David stood because I stood under the anointing of the prophet of God the very words that a prophet spoke I've been anointed by an anointed word that was spoke by an anointed man of God I allow the Horn of the Prophet to be dumped over my life therefore I can stand in the face of the enemy and I know I can make it he said that's what establishes you that you know who you are think about Jesus see Jesus had to be established too he had to know who he was I got a minute or did I run out of time see see he knew he was without a shadow of a doubt he knew he was the son of God because the word of God identified who he was that's what Jesus said so if I don't if I do not the works of my father don't believe me but if I do the works of my father then believe me he said see because they are manifested word promised so if you could just wake up brother B said if you could just wake up to that a minute that the works of God they are the manifested word promised to you if you could wake up to that a minute that the word itself identified who he was it wasn't what Jesus was doing it was what the word had said he would do that identified who he was so he was identified by the prophecy that went forth and because he manifested that prophecy the word was identified in him so see so the word itself identified him who he was and then he said well who can condemn me of sin in other words who can show me that my life and my Works don't fulfill exactly what the Messiah should do nobody could say nothing because that's who he was so then he had Faith to believe that whatever he said would happen because the word identified who he was my isn't that good word identified that's what I want to be tonight word identified I I don't want to be just a church identified or Pastor identified or or or friend identified or Mom or Daddy I want to be word identified I want to be I want the word of God to be so real in me that you can that you can look at my life and identify who I am well there goes a Believer right there there goes a daughter of God right there there sets a Son of God back there why cuz their word identified said see then he could turn around and say the works that I do shall you do also why could he say that because it was really the father that done the works he said the father that done the works for me he shall be in you he'll do the same works that he done in me so that's why he could say to the disciples the works I do shall you do also he said see that's that was the brother said that was the identification of a scriptural Christian that these words that Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe that's the identification of a scripture Christian Christian these signs shall follow them that believe you you can call yourself a Believer but deny those words how can you call yourself a Believer and deny any of his word you can't do it you're not a Believer therefore signs can't follow you because you just accept what you want to believe and the rest of it you don't want to believe it but if you're real believer then you'll take the whole thing and you'll believe it that means the stuff that feels good you'll still say Amen the stuff that feels bad it says Oh Me Oh My out told brother would you stop and give me a break you still say Amen because a real believer the real believer will except the whole word of God say see he'll believe it the whole thing he'll believe it said when you truly believe then not when you make believe but when you really believe then these signs will follow them that believe so let me ask you that again tonight are you a Believer are you a Believer can I tell you can I tell you a few things about a Believer you know there's a lot of things about Believers that are different there how many how many's having a good time in the Lord tonight there's a lot of things about Believers that are different some believers they like they they they they uh like to hear certain kind of song Some believers they they they have different kind of cultures they're from different countries they they they they use different instruments there you know there's there's a lot of things that are different about Believers we're not all the same hello somebody I know that I know that troubles some people cuz if you ain't just like them well then then you must be not you must not be of God because we're of God so you must not but not all the Believers are the same the Bible say there's a diversity of gifts you know what that means there's some people sing there's some people that shouldn't sing there's some people that preach and there's some people that shouldn't preach you know why cuz they wasn't called to do it there's a diversity of gifts some men have been given the gift of healing some the gift of tongues or interpretation there's a diversity of gifts not all believers are the same I know the world don't like that because they're trying to make everybody the same this sick devil today is trying but that's not the truth we're not all the same we like different things we like but but but we're not we we're diverse but you know as I thought about this we're not all the same but you realize that there are some things that every believer has you know I got to think about that today so just went in the message and got to went through there and I thought I'm going to find out everything that the prophet said that all the Believers have so I kind of as I went through there I found he starts talking about Peter and how that they came down the day of Pentecost and the and the and the Holy Ghost poured out on the day of Pentecost and he came out with that great message and he said repent every one in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he said that it was the same promise the same manner that fell that gave them eternal life just like the manner that carried the children of Israel through the Wilderness the Holy Ghost is what G what God has poured out that would carry the church through to Glory so just like they had the Mana we've got the Holy Ghost he'll carry you through and he said every man that come to Christ that'll believe that he said he will give that that will give up their sins and throw their arms to God and and he said he and not just some imitation but he'll be full of a genuine heartfelt real baptism of the Holy Ghost just like it fell on the day of Pentecost and it'll make the same signs and wonders and everything else will take place it'll make you act the same way you'll act like a drunk man you'll carry on just like they did on the day of Pentecost I know people don't believe it no more but it's the truth said you'll carry on just like they did on the day of Pentecost and every believer has a right to receive it so we may all be different in a lot of things but every believer has a right to receive the fullness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but friend that ain't all that every believer had a right to receive he said God gave many blessings there's many Redemptive blessings he said but every believer has a possession of every Redemptive blessing that God has ever given isn't that wonderful to be a believer that ain't all that ain't all that we have a right to you know how the churches today they go out these great denominations if you're not a part of the church you can't take communion I love what a prophet said he said it's called a close communion because you got to join the church in order to be able to take it he said but we're not a denomination therefore we have an open communion for we believe that every believer has a right to the table of the Lord how many Say Amen so every believer has a right to it I just think about more of them how you go over in the Eastern countries and they you know they bring a monarch that would come to be a king or a queen you know when it comes time for a change in the monarchy and they would bring them out they have a day that they would receive their royal power it's called a coronation day and you know that what that is it's a it's a a formal investure of their power in other words they would they would come down and they'll kneel down before the leaders and they'll they'll come and they'll they'll announce them and they'll put the crown or the crown on their head and they'll say who they are and now the power that was in the kingdom is given unto that one because it's their coronation day I love what prophet said in the message hear ye him he said but every believer has a time of Coronation in other words you have a time when God pulls you out of the crowd he said and he touches your heart you know what's he doing he's coronating us to give the power of the Holy Ghost to our lives every believer has a time of coronation every believer has a time when the power of the kingdom is bestowed upon his life see what happens you stand before Christ and you accept what he gave you you received the right to overcome the flesh you received the right to overcome the devil Oh my he he said many things in other place in the message time test to memorials every believer they don't have to worry about dying and going by the grave or whether they Rapture he said cuz every believer has already passed from Death unto life I say I'm glad to be a believer are you glad to be believer he said this is every believer Cas can I tell you a couple more I'm going hurry and close he said every believer has a sacred stand on the back side of a desert they have a place they can point back to and say that's where I met God may have been on an altar somewhere may have been on the on the on a on a a tree stump out in the woods praying somewhere wherever it was but every believer has a place that they can point back and know they met God but you know there's also some things that every believer has to do so if you're going to be a believer Now by your own confession you remember whenever Naomi she went back into Bethlehem and Ruth made the decision to go with her but mam said see she had to decide to go and make a decision where she was going to decide to go whether she would go or not he said she had to make that decision and that's what every believer has to do so first you had to make a decision every believer that I'm going to follow the word I'm going to I'm going to follow what God wants to life and you surrender to God he said then you come back in another message the mark of the beast say you come back just like Abel did and Abel went and made his sacrifice of his lamb and Abel had to lay on Abel lost his life because of the sacrifice that he made remember he lay he sacrificed the lamb and Cain was so jealous he took his life he said but every believer has to do the same thing Abel done he has to die on the rock with his lamb in the days of Ahab and Micaiah remember whenever Ahab all those 400 prophets would come by and say it's okay to go into battle but here Micaiah had a vision from the Lord and he couldn't do but what God told him to do so he said I know the vision is according to the word of God and if you go out there you're just going to die he said he spoke the word anyhow he was willing they said we're going to throw you in prison Mah if you don't agree with everybody else if you don't go along with what we think you ought to do we're going to throw you in prison but he was willing to go to prison he said and today every believer has to fight just like he did we had to be willing to fight for what we believe why because we're Believers is there something see but God he's equipped us as Believers with the greatest weapon he gave us he gave us the word that we could overcome the devil I know what the devil tells you he says well that's just for preachers and that's just for elders and you know I can't find that stuff in the Bible like that I I can't bring all that out but let me tell you what the prophet said he said it's for every one of us every believer has a right to take this word and fight the enemy anywhere you meet him isn't that wonderful you ain't got to wait on a preacher to come by to combat the Devil with the word of God but every believer has a right to take the word of God and stand against the devil anywhere he wants to meet you you say brother M I don't feel like I had the power to beet him well friends it ain't the power that you have it's the power that he has for the prophet said but every believer has the authority to use the power of God against the devil we ain't looking for power every believer has Authority let me ask you this tonight are you a Believer amen how many believe we have here go ahe and raise your hand again that's all we need tonight as a body of Believers Brother David we need a restored faith in the anointed word of God that was poured over our life here can you just see this as a prophet would begin to say what a Believer was you realize that's the same thing that David done that day when he was kneeling down before Samuel he was waiting to hear what Samuel would prophesy over his life David didn't know that about his life but once it was prophesied over his life he accepted what the prophet said and he went on and fulfilled what he was supposed to do and here God has given us that same opportunity tonight to hear the anointed word of a prophet of God that by Vision he was able to pour that out on your life and saying this is who you really are I know the devil tells you all kinds of stuff and who you you ain't never going to make it you're a make believer you're you're an unbeliever I know people get that all mixed up but well you know after all in every Church there's unbelievers and make Believers and Believers and you know what I believe that and I believe that every one of us used to be every one of them we all used to be unbelievers and we all used to be make Believers then one day we were a Believer so don't look down on the unbeliever and look down on the mate believer cuz they're only where you used to be but what we ought to do is make a way that they can get to where we are cuz we want some real Believers and I believe that everybody has a right for that I believe that ought won't you stand to your feet tonight I believe that ought to be our commission as a body of Believers is to bring people into that and to bring the message of the hour to them that they could be a believer in the anointed word of God that's been poured out of the Horn of a prophet upon our life amen we're Believers but the David we're anointed to believe the word yes sir we've been anointed to receive the Holy Ghost amen we've been anointed to have victory in Leo DEA we've been anointed to be able to overcome we've been anointed to hear and we've been anointed to speak how many say that T I have heard and now I speak you know why because you're a Believer how many believe that tonight I'm not just any kind of believer I'm a word identified believer amen so we stand tonight I wonder how many as we think on these things he the ending of a year and what God is going to do for us next year and you could stand and say Lord you know I as the word went forth and the anointing is being poured out I heard of things that I have and possessions that I ought to possess and I just want to make claim to them tonight wonder how many lift your hand and say I I want to claim all the things that the believer is supposed to have how many lift your hand with me
