our trial and say but let me tell you how big my God Isen how many can do that this morning I I just want to talk about how big my God is sometimes it makes you feel good to talk about how big God really is amen he ain't just some little history lesson like people Mak him but we have a real God Amen he's alive this morning he's still working among his church do you believe that this morning how many truly believe it with all your heart that God is still able and God is still working my he's still a wonderful God Amen I believe him this morning that that's why I serve him and it's why I've dedicated my life to him and you know brother Wesley some days I are the best days I have serving the lord and some days are the worst but I still serve the Lord amen some days you feel like running laps and and shouting and the Housetop and some days you feel like hiding in the basement but still yet we serve the Lord amen you love him that's that he desires us to be and no matter what we're going through we can still lift our hands and praise him and we can come this morning and we can put all the things of the Flesh and the world behind us and just dedicate a few moments to the Lord amen can you do that this morning how many can pull from the word of God and I'm tell you it sure makes easier preaching when the Lord shows up amen say well what's going to make him show up it takes an invitation of the people he said he's a gentleman and he always goes where he's invited so I want to invite him here this morning and say Lord would you make yourself welcome in our midst that you could speak to our heart we just want to uh remember all the requests that we have have uh just remember our service is coming up uh this week we have uh on Wednesday night we're going to cancel the service Wednesday night uh this coming Wednesday and we're actually going to have our service on Tuesday night uh starting at 7 o'clock and we'll just have a uh a New Year's service we're not going to

had quite a quite a turnout and and really had a a wonderful time those young people Wednesday night I I've never heard him sing like that in all my life anybody can anybody testify to that that was here it was just a a powerful anointing and man just to see a people come together to Worship the Lord and and uh so we just want to remember that service on Tuesday Tuesday night also uh remember uh Harmony saer she went to the hospital this morning uh that was in labor looking to have her baby brother Joe and sister Mandy headed out that way so just remember her in prayer this morning and uh also brother Andrew is ministering this morning down in Florida uh he'll be preaching for us next Sunday so just remember his services in prayer and uh remember Sunny uh she is sick this morning morning and also uh also Lori and Britney's uh granny is back in the hospital and just ask the Lord uh to be with her amen how many believe that God is mindful of what we have need of Amen so won't we just approach him that way as a god that is able and and just invite him to come and and to speak to us this morning and and to make himself known amen can you do that how many in your own way would just invite the Lord to come let's bow our heads together gracious Heavenly Father father Lord how we love you tonight and Lord we're so thankful for all that you've done for us and all that you've given us Lord here in this time of holiday and God the families that have come together many that are gone and visiting and family and Lord we just thank you Lord for a time that we could come together and Lord we just ask you this morning Lord that you would come and you would speak to your children Lord knowing the needs of the people Lord there are many needs that we have and things that we don't have the answer to but Lord we just come to rely on you this morning and God we ask you to have your way in this service Lord that those that are sick be healed and those that need to be lifted up Lord I pray that you would Lift Us Lord you would take this word Lord and you would you would use it for our benefit God we just ask you to anoint it now as we approach the word of God Lord that your will will be done in this service and we'll give you the glory for everything that's done and said in Jesus name we pray amen amen how many Say Amen to that that's the desire of our heart amen so we just want to invite you to the scripture we're going to read out of the Book of Luke in the second chapter and we'll start in the eth verse and uh we'll go through the 15th verse and I just had heard this uh on U on uh last Wednesday night brother brother Joe uh was actually reading this scripture and when he read it something just stood out to me and the Lord had put it on my heart so I thought I'll uh be able to come uh this morning and bring that to the church so uh just just look forward to what uh God can show us in it amen do you still believe that God can take his word and uh he can show us things in his word that we have need of and he's certainly that kind of a god this morning and so we just want to rely on him to bring something out of the word that would be edifying uh to the church so we're going to read out of Luke in the 2 chapter and here in the eth verse and the Bible says that and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for for behold I bring to you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is called the L Christ the Lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was the Angel With An Angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and and peace on Earth and on Earth peace and Good Will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven that the shepherd said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us and I'll just ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word this morning and from that scripture I would like to speak on a subject of the believer's Bethlehem the believer's Bethlehem and as you're seated I would like to read out of the book of Psalms the 42nd chapter in the second verse and David said my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God for when shall I come and appear before God what a question David asked when shall I come and appear before God you know through the Bible uh many times we see this question that is asked in several places where can I find him and how can I see him and where can I meet him and uh this is what David asked when shall be the time that I can come and I can appear before God and you know I thought about in the Old Testament in the days of Abraham and uh when Abraham met with God do you realize that when Abraham talked with God it was almost on a daily basis and back uh in in those days they would go and Abraham he would uh on on many occasions he would meet with God and he would talk with God and uh even when he would go into the land of gerar remember uh the king AMC which was a Philistine King the Bible says that the Lord was in the camp of ailec and here he was a Philistine but yet still God was present there he was in the he was in the camp of the Philistine he was in the camp of Abraham and where wherever they went it seemed like God was always there it was was the it was just a way that or a place they could always meet God in other words it was a very common thing to be in the presence of the Lord and in in those days it was certainly a common thing it was common among men 3,000 years ago brother Mark it was a very common thing for men to meet God you could almost meet God anywhere you notice the Bible said Abraham where when he went into the Into the Wilderness God was there when he was at his home God was there when he was with his family God was there when he went into a Strange Land God was there when he went up in the mountain he met with God when he went down in the valley he met with God it seemed like that God was always there it was always a place to be able to meet God and and you know the prophet say but then it was a common thing but they you know but today it's different but why don't people meet him today he said there's more people than there ever was there's tens of thousands and millions of more people than there ever has been like there was years ago but there's something about it but today God has become some ancient something that is just talked about he's some ancient history so you see that people today they don't go meet God in person like they did many years ago here some 3,000 years ago where they used to but today it's not common for a man to go meet God if a man talks about it why you'd make fun of him if a man said he went and met god well people would call him a crazy person or somebody that had lost his mind it's uncommon to the world today for a man to meet God you know I thought about this here was the desire of David when can I come and I can sit down in his presence when can I be found in the presence of God and you realize that this very desire that David had was a desire that was passed on from generation to generation and and we see when Christ came to the Earth that there were many in that day that was seeking the coming of a messiah they were waiting on his coming and and these were a people y'all y' you'll just had to get with me this morning it's what the lord gave me but but it was a people that knew the law of the prophets here was a people that were they were expecting something how many expecting something this morning so here because they were expecting something they knew the prophecies that was concerning this coming they knew they knew in every age they knew generation after generation they had awaited for his arrival and though and and all of a sudden they finally come to the age when no longer was it a prophecy but it was the age of fulfillment and no longer was it an age of question but then come the age of the answer so all the the age of wondering of When shall I meet him when shall I see him when shall he come all of a sudden here was a people that the answer to the question had arrived in their City I thought my that's what we need this morning we need the answer answer to the question to arrive in our city and and the Bible says but here here he would come and they were expecting him to come but I want to notice this this morning just as I lay a foundation that each time you find Jesus introduced in the Bible there's always an invitation for you to come and see him for yourself I got to think about this little thought this morning of of how that many times as he was introduced you remember when Jesus went down into Galilee and the Bible said he was calling his disciples and Andrew and and and uh in in in in John and as he began to call his disciples and he came to Phillip and he told philli come and follow me and the Bible says that Philip went out and he began to talk to Nathaniel And he said Nathaniel come and see the one that that the Moses and the prophets had spoke of and he he's the one that was written about in the in the laws of Moses his name is Jesus of Nazareth he's the son of Joseph he's the Messiah the one that we long for and and Nathaniel said well how can anything good ever come out of Nazareth and notice how that Philip replied to Nathaniel he said just come and see now what a what three words that they have a lot of meaning he said just come and see how can this be God he said well come and see how can anything good come out of Nazareth he said well just come and see remember when Jesus he came to the woman at the well remember when he went down that little Samaritan woman and as he began to speak to her and you notice the gift or the or or or or the sign of the Messiah begin to speak out of him and he he told her to go get her husbands and she said I don't have any husbands he said woman you spoke the truth he said for you've had five husbands and the one that you have now it's not your own and all of the sudden her eyes came open to that Messiah sign the one that would be able to discern her heart and friends you may as well make a note of it when you see that sign it is the sign of the Messiah of the of the Angel of the Lord being able to see something in somebody's life that you didn't know was there or you hadn't told anybody about it there was no way for him to know it it was a messiah sign that that she saw sitting on the side of the well and the Bible says that whenever she saw that she said I know that when the Messiah comes he would do these things he would know the desire of our heart he would tell us all things he he would know the things that are in our mind that we haven't even spoke of and Jesus said I that speaks unto thee am he and you know what the Bible said the Bible says she threw down her water pot and she went running into the city and what was her message her message was come and see come and see a man that have told me all the things in my heart come and see a man that has fulfilled the scripture you notice it was the same message and and you you realize that notice the Bible says that they went out of the city and they came unto him you say well why would they go to him because you realize that this is the draw of our human nature this is this is as part of our nature is that we want to see it for oursel we I don't want to take somebody else's word for but I want to see how many testify that I I want to see God for myself I I want to see him move for myself I want to see a supernatural for myself I want to see a move of God for myself I want to see a Revival for myself I don't want to see something of somebody else's day but let me see it for myself so here here the Bible says come and see and then they went to see the very thing that she was speaking of and when they seen they came out believing you see this same thing in Mary Magdalene and Mary when they came to the seler after the burial of Jesus the Bible said they found an angel that was sitting on a stone that once was the door or the seal over the tomb where Jesus's dead body lay but there here whenever Mary Magdalene and they came to the tomb that day no longer was there a dead body but the tomb the door had been rolled away the stone had been rolled away and sitting on the stone was an angel of the Lord and he said fear not for that which you seek he's not here but he is risen and come and see the place where he lay notice it's the same message all along it's com and see now notice in order in order for it to uh to to for you to be able to see it this morning notice the message was not just see but the message was to come and see in other words there there's an action in order for you to see there's an action of getting out of where you are whenever Philip told Nathaniel he said come and see in other words you can't sit here and see what I'm talking about when the woman at the well she said come and see in other words you can't stay in Samaria but you got to go down to the same well and meet the same one that I'm there that you can see that he's the Messiah and now he the Angel of the Lord he said come and see the place where he lay oh friends let me tell you I thought this is so powerful this word come and see notice it's used in two different ways one it was used at an in as an invitation to show you where Jesus was not at and then in the other place it was used as an invitation to show you where he was so here this message of come and see it'll show you come and see where this is not God come and see that God ain't here come and see that he's not in this but then turn around and come and see but this is the savior come and see this is the work of the Messiah come and see this is a messiah sign so it's the same message that showed you where Jesus wasn't is the same message that shows you where he was says so come and see the place where he laid so but notice but in order what the Bible is showing us is in order to see him you have to come to a certain place right is that established in order to see him how many say Amen in order to see him you have to come to a certain place in other words you have to get out of where you are if you want to see God you got to move a little bit if you want to see God you got to get out of the condition that you're in if you want to see God you got to pick yourself up and you got to take a few steps and go to the place that where God is friends let me tell you if there ever was a way to see God then there still is if there was a way to appear before God then there still is somebody say Amen if there ever anybody have a testimony there's a way to see God here this morning but let me tell you something that goes much deeper than the surface don't let this pass You by but you can only see God as he is if you want to see God you must see him as he is for the Bible would say in the days of the shepherd they saw him as a baby in a Manger in the days of the woman at the well she saw him as a man that was in his 30s in the days of Moses he saw him as a pillar of fire and how did the people see him they saw him in Moses and when they saw Moses they saw God see if you want to see God you must see God as he is Daniel when he went down the the Lion's Den it was a the angel of the Lord that came down that protected him when Ezekiel saw him he was a wheel in the middle of a wheel when Abraham met him he was mecdc that met him on the road and he sat down and had Feast with him if you want to see God you have to see him as he is so today if you want to see him you have to go to where God is and you have to meet God as God is I thought today of how that that that people have done so much to prepare a place where that you and I can go meet God I thought of the millions of dollars and the money that people have spent just to make a place where that you can fulfill the desire of David and that you can appear before God you realize that there's there's many places on Earth that that claim to have that power in order for you to be able to appear before God I was looking at some I thought I'd share with you this morning but you realize in in in over in Mount Si there's there's a church called the St Catherine's Monastery and in the St Katherine's Monastery you'll actually find you'll actually find that there uh that inside the monastery is a descendant of the actual burning bush the brambo bush that that was on Mount Si and according to in according to their teaching in Egypt it was actually the same Bush and it was protected through the the ages and they're a long living Bush several centuries that they even live but this is an offspring of the very same Bush that came off Mount Si that Moses came before and here today you can go down into into the St Katherine's Monastery you can take a tour you can pay a few dollars and you can go in and you know many go and say it's a nice place I think it would be a nice place to go visit brother Wesley just to see uh what they what they've done in a place where Moses actually walked up up on the mountain but but see but then there's other people that go there and you see that bush what you can't see is though people those people that go there before many of them when they come before that bush they'll actually take their shoes off because they're walking on Holy Ground and here after all it's the same Bush that descended so they'll take their shoes off and they walk before the bush why because they're trying to find a place that they can appear before God and after all it was the same Bush it was transplanted from the mountain and built in this Monastery to protect it I thought there's many places you can go you know you can leave there and you can Journey just for a few miles and you can go over to the Red Sea and there's many places along the Red Sea that claim to be the very place that God came down look on that on those very waters on that that very bank that God came down where 2 million people were lined up by that mountain and God parted those Waters where 2 million people could walk across it and many more could walk across it on dry Trot and you know there there's there's many places and signs along that Red Sea that you can go down and you can say this is where God parted the waters I thought my what I thought it would be to walk down the red sea sea and say that's where God opened up the water What a Mighty thing that God done because it was a work that God done but you can walk in that very place you know you can go over into palast in Into the City of Bethlehem and in this city there's what's called The Church of the nativity and I I don't know if you ever looked at this place but it's quite it's quite fascinating what's there but actually according uh to to to the church history it's actually considered the holiest place in all of Christianity in the Church of the Nativity because in this place there's actually a cave below the church and in the cave which what they would show was a place where animals were kept and a Manger where animals were kept and there's a silver star on the ground where they say that today it was the very place that Mary gave birth to Jesus and you can go today and and go into the church and take a tour and walk down and stand and take photos on the very place where Jesus was born I thought my what a place here they built the church over and you know what a place to be able to go to see the same spot that Jesus was born but but you know that there's there's many other places there there's the Church of Jacob's Well that's over in nabul that's in the that's the modern day shech and and you know if you go inside that church that actually they never moved the well the well is still there remember when Jacob came back and he went into the land of shech and he made an altar before the Lord and as he and as he built the the well that that that uh that many would drink out of and his family and all them would be uh sustained from that that they come and they built the church around the well to protect it and the reason they built it is because the sacredness of it it was actually a place where Jesus actually walked a matter of fact you can go in there today and you can sit down on the same well that Jesus and that little Samaritan woman sat on and you can hear they'll sit and they'll read you the story of that woman of Samaria and how Jesus came to this well and how she looked at the well down in it and said but here I can draw from it and he said if you wanted anything if you really wanted something to drink you'd ask me to draw and she said well the well is deep and you have you can look down in the depth of that great well and realize what she was speaking of the well is deep and you brought nothing to draw with you and today you can go sit down and you can experience that same place and you know that you can leave there and you can go over to the the pool of Bethesda where the archaeologist today Brother David that they've actually taken this pool of Bethesda and they dug it out and they and they they made it to where you can go and you can sit down at the pool of Bethesda and here in in Jerusalem this was the place that where people would go to remember the Bible call it it would be the place of Mercy or the or the House of Mercy because at the pool of Bethesda it had five porches remember the significance of the pool is that when Jesus went down there that day you've read the story in the Bible and the Bible said they were sitting around the pool those that were blind and withered and they were and they were they were lame and they couldn't walk but every day every time that when it came a time of healing that the angel of the Lord would come down and he would trouble the water and the people that sat on those very porches many times they would walk down and the first person that would go down after the water was troubled and they would step into that pool they would receive their healing this is the place that Jesus walked brother Bobby and he walked down those very porches today you can walk the same path that Jesus walked you can stand on the same porch where Jesus stood and he looked at that little man that was on that that that was that was halt from his birth or lame and Jesus said he had that infirmity for 38 years and the Bible said Jesus knew that he had set in that condition for a long time and you can go and you can stand in that very place where Jesus spoke to him and said why won't you go get your healing and the man remember that conversation that he had he said I can't get my healing because every time the angel troubles the water somebody gets in my way and nobody can take me to the water and I can't make it to my healing and Jesus looked at him he said arise and take up thy bed and walk and the Bible says immediately the man St he stood and feeling came back to his leg he went away testifying and leaping and praising God you know you can visit that very same place that Jesus had done this great miracle you can leave that place and go over into the city of japfa which was the old day of japa and in this city you can find the house of Simon the Tanner and you realize that what happened at the house of Simon the Tanner can I can I just say it I feel good this morning but at the the house of Simon the Tanner this very house that still stands today is the house that Peter got his vision that God wasn't just a God to the Jews but he was also a God to the Gentiles and on the top of that very house when they were preparing supper on the inside Peter went up on the rooftop of that house and he was sitting there praying and and seeking God and the Bible said as he got hungry and they preparing the meal all of a sudden he broke into a vision and he saw this great sheet come down upon the Earth and on that sheet there was four-footed beast and fouls of the air and the angel of the Lord spoke to him he said Peter go kill and eat and Peter said I can't eat those things I don't eat things that are common I don't eat things that are unclean I've always kept my body I've always kept my vow and the angel of the Lord spoke to him he said you don't call something unclean that I've called clean you don't call something common that I've called uncom M he said it's a clean thing I've made it clean and the Bible says that Vision came to him three times he saw that sheet come down and as he came out of his vision on that very roof brother Wesley as he came out of his vision on that rooftop and he begin to walk down the stairs they said Peter there's somebody here to see you and the spirit of the Lord began to speak to him as he walked down the stairs of that house and when every step he took hear the spirit of the Lord speaking to him saying Peter now these men I sent unto you do what they're asking you to do it ain't some trap I send them here I sent him here for a purpose and I and I've called you to this place for a purpose Peter went down and lo and behold there stood three Gentiles at that very door and Peter walked out them same doors and he stood in that same doorway and he began to speak to those men and said what do you want with me they said our Master Cornelius he's had a vision and the Lord told him he's a praying man a devout man he loves the Lord he gives off he's had a vision and the Lord told him to come and find Simon Peter in the house of Simon the tenner and so we came came here to find you to come back to our house so Peter said the Lord told me to go brother Wesley he went down and because of the new revelation that Peter had he began to speak to them they said we don't know what to tell you we're just a bunch of old Gentiles and all I know is the Lord told us to tell you to come here and speak to us and Peter said let me tell you the Revelation that I have he said I know one thing that I have perceived that God is no respector of persons y'all may not be Jews there was a few days ago I wouldn't be caught dead in your house but on the rooftop of the House of Simon the Tanner I got a revelation that God is not only the god of the Jews but he's the god of the Gentiles and he said and I I perceive that God's no respector of persons but in every nation that fearth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him that's the message that Peter preached unto him you can go down and look at the same place the Gateway that Peter stood in but you realize butar that ain't all you can go down to Jerusalem today and there's a small structure inside the Church of the Holy SRE I they' remodeled it a few years ago I I remember watching when they were I think it was 2016 or 17 they were doing the remodel and the reason we were watched it is because it was the first time in centuries that you could actually see in the edicule which is the little house inside the church you could actually see in the edicule to the first house that was built you realize that house is actually that or that little Temple is a temple within a temple and inside that Temple is another Temple an ancient Temple that that the the old concrete walls that they had built it in and inside that old concrete walls that they had built it in actually has the remnants of the cave that Jesus was buried in the Tomb of Jesus and here inside of it it shows the remnants of it you can go in now you can't see it they keep it buried in there because they don't ever want it to lose its value and today they go have daily mass in this Temple walking around the tomb or or the Tomb of the Tomb of the tomb where Jesus is and they walk around it and they and they worship him it's a place of worship to think of this place where Jesus was and I thought you know my you know the greatest part about the Tomb of Jesus brother Wesley is that you won't find Jesus there you know the greatest part of it is there's no bones in there there's no remnants of him you can have worship there all you want to but Jesus ain't there you know the greatest part of the House of of Simon the tenner you can go there but that ain't the place that you go to meet God you know the great part of going to the pool of Bethesda but Mar it ain't the place to meet God it's a great place to go it's a great place to see the things that God done but that ain't a place to meet God and that tomb ain't a place to meet God because he ain't in no tomb let me tell you friend there's many religions around the world you can go to the Mecca and Saudi Arabia you can find the tomb of Muhammad and his body's laying on the inside you can go all over Asia and you can find tombs that are filled with the ashes of Buddha and all of Buddha ISM where they had burned his body and spread his ashes through churches around the world where people can still go worship Him but when you go to Jerusalem to the Tomb of Jesus Christ you'll never find a bone you'll never find a body you'll never find a Remnant because we have a Jesus a God a savior that's alive and well you won't find him buried in a tomb you won't find him on the bank of a river somewhere he's prophet of God said don't you think it's a wonderful thing this morning to know that our Christian religion is the only religion that can prove that our savior is still alive Hallelujah I said our savior is still alive hundreds of religions around the world but we have a god that is still alive and well we serve a Jesus a savior a prophet that came to the Earth and he's still walking I ain't going to no dead man's tomb looking for God people today they're so lost going to a tomb of a man trying to find God waiting on him to resurrect where they could find God I've already found God in the place to meet God and it ain't in a dead man's tomb do you want to meet God said you got to go find a place where you can meet him Buddha died 19 or 2500 years ago Muhammad died 1900 years ago and they still go they still go to their tombs to worship them but listen what our Jesus said he said a little while this world will see me no more but you shall see me even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither do they know him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and he shall be in you you know why we ain't going everywhere looking for God because that ain't where he said he'd be he said I will not leave you comfortless but I glory to God Oh Glory he said I will not leave you comfortless but I will come to you everybody's going everywhere looking for God but Jesus said I will not leave you comfortless for I will come to you wherever you are he said I'll come to you because I live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I am in my father and you are in me and I am in you you remember the disciples when Jesus spoke these words they said we're troubled at this saying what do you mean what what do you mean that a little while we won't see you in a little while we'll see you again how how how does this mean the Bible say Jesus knew what they were asking in their heart he said you want to know why I said a little while the world wouldn't see me but you'll see me in a little while he said let me explain it to you he said verily I say unto you that you shall weep and the world will be rejoicing he said but then there will come a time think about it you're going to be weeping you're going to come through a time of great sorrow while the world rejoices he said but then there will come a time that the world will rejoice no longer but you shall rejoice in other words your sorrow will be turned into Joy he said you'll be sorrowful but it'll be turned into great joy then he uses the type of a woman that was given birth he says see for a woman that would that would go into childbirth she would travail in their child birth and pain and anguish he said but whenever the man is born then the joy is greater than the pain and about and Jesus said and no longer will she even remember the pain because the joy is greater than the pain oh see there's many that are in the middle of a birth and it's a painful thing to think of a new birth but Jesus said but that sorrow only lasts for a little while I find many people in that place this morning that are in the process of a new birth and it's a painful place and it's a place of great sorrow he said but whenever the child is born the joy is greater than the pain ever was rejoice in the sorrow but Bob joy joy joy cometh in the morning he said therefore you have sorrow but I will see you again and when I see you again your heart shall rejoice for no man can take it from you I'm going to give you a joy that no man can take away when you get through this place of Sorrow my isn't that a good thought this morning that the joy is greater than the pain I don't know what you're going through this morning but I know what Jesus said there's only a certain time of sorrow but then Joy follows sorrow and the joy is greater than the pain where you won't even remember the pain that you went through Jesus said observe all things whatever I commanded you Lo I'm with you always even until the end of the world butam said see tonight in our midst Jesus Christ God's son he's living with us here omniscient omnipresent omnipotent he's infinite he's Immortal he's God and he's living with us now he's not just a god of the past but he's a god of the present friends you ain't got to travel around the globe to see God you don't have to visit a tomb or a sanctuary or a c synagogue or a mosque or a cathedral but brother mam said there ain't but one place to meet God and that's in Christ Jesus you say brother Matt I want to see God let me give you the answer then get into Christ I want to see the supernatural then get into Christ I want to see Miracles then get into Christ I want to see healing then get into Christ I want to see Revival then get into Christ I want to see my prayers answer then get into Christ there ain't but one place to meet God there's people joins all kinds of things all sorts of religions all sorts of cult churches that people join around this world today religious cults all these things but you realize but here's the question brother man would make this very plain he said are you in a denomination seeking after Christ listen he's saying the only place to meet God is in Christ it ain't in a church it ain't in a denomination it ain't in somebody's religion or something that a man made it's only in Christ Jesus somebody say Christ Jesus somebody say only it's only in Christ Jesus he said see so if you're in a denomination I will strictly tell you you are in Leia but if you're in Christ then you're a new creature Hallelujah and you're in the Church of the Living God with the manifestation of the very same things that he did in his day will be coming back here in this day doing the same thing he said he would do then that's the real church and you get into it by spiritual baptism not by joining but by being baptized by the Holy Ghost into his body it's God's only provided way that he has left for us to to do is to be baptized into his body or his Spirit how many say Amen see if you're in Christ you're a new creature and you're in the Church of the Living God I don't know about y'all that makes me want to shout you know what that tells me your Dwelling Place determines the atmosphere that you live in if you're in Christ you're in the Church of the Living God outside of that well you're in leosia you're either in Christ or you're in Le oosa said but your dwelling place that terms that listen that's why David would say surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever you think about it what does it mean to dwell in the Lord's House he said I will dwell there forever in other words and I'll dwell within the word of God I'll dwell in this in this place of Refuge this is my dwelling place here that God has given us this house of the Lord I wonder how many can make that statement today I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever you know why David said that because he was going through great trial he was a man that had been through tribulations he he he was a man that that Satan had tried to destroy his life but something in him overcame the very thing that Satan would try to do and he would say but I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever you can pull at me but I'm going to find myself in the house of the Lord you can drag me down but I'll find myself in the house of the Lord you can bury me but I'm going to find myself in the house of the Lord why because it's my dwelling place it's my refuge let me tell you that's what Satan's trying to do today he's trying to take people out of the atmosphere of God and away from the Church of the Living God and bring a formalism upon God's church but let me tell you I say to the devil I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever no wonder David begin to speak these words he said for the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want oh don't you realize what he's saying David was a man that knew what a Shepherd was he was a man that was raised as a Shepherd but let me tell you what it means when David said the Lord is my shepherd not only was he saying that he had a great Shepherd but he said he was my shepherd in other words he called the Lord a shepherd and he called himself a sheep he said the Lord is my shepherd in other words not just I'm saying we have a Shepherd but I'm saying I'm a sheep in God's pasture see it's one thing to recognize him as a Shepherd it's another thing to recognize yourself as a sheep cuz David said because the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want and he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside Still Waters they begin to talk about the things that the Lord was going to do to him because he had a great Shepherd think about here here this Lord was he said surely goodness and mercy would follow me he said here here this great Shepherd as he would come he would restore my soul and he lead me upon the paths of righteousness for his name's sake don't you realize what David was saying I go down a lot of paths in my life I make a lot of turns sometimes I find bad places sometimes I wind up in bad situations sometimes there's trouble in the home sometimes there's trouble on the job but listen what David saying he said but the Lord is leading me down the paths of righteousness for his name's sake so let me tell you what he's telling you that on that path of righteousness sometimes there's dark days and sometimes there's light days on the path of righteousness sometimes you're on a mountain and sometimes you're in a valley on the path of righteousness sometimes everything's good and sometime everything's bad David said but though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for thou art with me and thy rod and thy staff they comfort me on the path of righteousness that's what David had caught a revelation of is as I walk through this life I'm on the path of righteousness I'm being led by God that means when I come into a trial that trial was something that God put there why because I'm walking on the paths of righteousness so when I come in the face of death I can say but the rod of the Lord is with me the rod and thy staff is with me what was it it was a top of the word of God David said I have a refuge I have a Dwelling Place a place I can turn to in the time of trouble in the valley of death in the middle of the Shadows I have a place that I can turn to because my God will deliver me that's what we need this morning we need the rod of the word of God through every trial every place that we walk through every lonely and dark day what we need is the rod of the word of God to comfort us that when we come in the presence of our I I love what David said I may as well preach it I'm here I love what he said he said because in the presence of my enemies he said God Made A Feast for me right in the presence of my enemies when I ought to be scared and said he spread a table before me and he spread out a feast and said Feast on it today I thank God this morning that we still have a God that feeds Heavenly Mana in the time of trouble you can come to a place where the table is spread that you could feed on it where the rod of the word of the Lord can beat away every Spirit every unclean thing every demon out of your life that you can set and eat in peace David said I find peace knowing I have a great Shepherd peace knowing that I can sit down and in the middle of my great trial in the middle of a battle but I can spread a table my the world come around you don't you realize all the there's so much trouble in the land don't you realize there's all this problem realize the world may in there's a war there a there's a nuclear war about to happen don't you y'all need to wake up y'all need to get scared but in the middle of all of this he said there's a table spread before me is't that good and all of this there's a feast said what are you doing then I'm going to sit down at the table and feast upon the word of God you know because it's our dwelling place it's our refuge in a time of a storm and the more you Feast on it the stronger you get in the middle of all that all of a sudden all them feedings begin to go away because you're feasting upon the word or the table that God said friends that's what we need this morning we need the rod of the word of God turn loose on the devil ain't that right lilam we need the rod of the word turn loose on the devil that he could bring it in that's what the shepherd's Rod was for it wasn't to beat sheep with it was a beat off wolves and that's what it's for is to come in this morning and to drive every wolf out of the building to dve Drive every wolf out of your home don't you realize there's wolves that Circle Our Lives there's wolves that circles a herd let me tell you every time there's a herd of sheep there's a wolf somewhere off in the distance just looking for a way in but that's what David said he said but I have a great Shepherd I can lay my head down in high in the middle of Green Pastures knowing that I'm in a refuge there's a rock wall that's built around me and at the doorway my shepherd lays a resting that when a wolf would come he'd have to go through him before he could ever get to me the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want that's what we need this morning it's the rod of the word turned loose that would release the power of God in your life how many say Amen to that let it be turned loose this morning you know I think about about this word first second Timothy three listen what the Bible says can I talk about this can I talk about the rod of the word a minute I got a minute B the Bible says all scriptures given by inspiration of God it's profitable for Doctrine for Repro and for correction and instruction in righteousness all somebody say all scripture all scripture it's given my inspiration of God profitable for Doctrine correction instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect and thoroughly furnished unto all good works in other words he gave us all scriptures that we would be equipped to overcome the world that we would be equipped to succeed in our walk with God we'd be equipped to fulfill our purpose we would be equipped brother Joe to meet our or to reach our destination he would he would thoroughly furnish us with the word of God now watch this the Bible says Jesus said Matthew 24 Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away so here we have a word that will thoroughly equip us and brother Tom and then here Jesus said it will not pass away see what that shows us is it wasn't just for disciples for 2,000 years ago but it was for today because it'll never pass away that means whatever day you're born in can I just make oh man it just feel it just feels good to me it don't matter what year you're born my word will never pass away I was born in the middle of a hurricane but my word will never never pass away I was born in a tornado but my word will never pass away I was born in a blizzard but my word will never it do matter when or where what the conditions were that you had your birthday and my word will never pass away say See it'll it'll never pass away so you notice that what that tells us is that if if Paul said it was inspired by God Jesus said it'll never pass away then that means what was inspired by God 2,000 years ago is still inspired by God today somebody say Amen if it was inspired or following with me I'm I'm I'm building to something you see that's what we need today in the church that's why we need the word of God because it's an inspired word of God last week I was speaking on the the word being an anointed word and here that anointed word that is inspired by God but notice it has to be inspired in the right at the right season the right time for the right purpose that's what we need we come to church to hear what we come to hear an inspired word we come to hear an Inspire an inspired thing you know you know what it means to be inspired brother Wesley it means to give rise to so in other words if something inspires you then it's lifting you it gives rise to you it causes you to want to move it causes you to want to walk it caus you to want to say Amen it caused you to want to clap your hands it caused you to want to shout because inspiration means to give rise to so here he said we have an inspired word and all scriptures are inspired and so we come we come to the church this morning to to find an inspired word we want a word that will cause us to rise we need a word that will cause us to move we need a word that'll cause us to act this is the very thing that tells you why many people go to churches today and there's no that there ain't nobody moving there ain't no action there there ain't nobody there ain't nobody having any Revival there ain't nobody free everything's formal and dead and cold because that they're not bringing an inspired word they may read out of the same Bible you say man what a paradox this is think about it an inspired word it causes you to say Amen an inspired word it causes you to want more an Inspire word it causes you to preach it causes you to want to sing it moves you it causes you want to do something for the Lord let me tell you that's what we need today we need inspired singers we need inspired worshippers we need inspired preachers that are inspired by God let me tell you if you have no inspiration you ain't got no business in God's pull pit if you got no inspiration you ain't got no business singing any songs because what we need today is an inspired word of God a man without inspiration causes more harm than he'll ever cause good it's not you think about why because it's not by an inspired word if if you take a non- inspired word it'll leave people down a path of spiritual death and people you know what the mental oh I'm going to get myself in trouble I I'll just preach what the Lord tells me to to preach but you know what happens when a man that is uninspired he'll come back and say but I read a true scripture and I spoke true things so it must have been inspired but you realize it was still uninspired because the direction was not God's Direction now here lays a paradox in the Bible I'm teaching you something now here lays a paradox how can you read an inspired word and it be uninspired think about it how can you read an inspired word and it not Inspire anybody how can it be uninspired let me tell you how prophet of God said he said that every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laying in seed form and if it's received into a human being very common quote and spoke by the same thought that materialize the Bible then it'll bring it to pass see what I mean how powerful the church could be let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus so in other words if a word is spoken with the same thought in the same direction that it was written in then it will have effect but that same word that inspired word can be spoken with a different direction or a different thought that's why you don't want men without inspiration taking a hold of the word of God and bringing it before the people because they can take the same word uninspired and cause cause harm or lead people astray well I I quoted a scripture I read a good scripture I said a bunch of things I hollered like all the other preachers don't that make me inspired no it don't make you inspired let me give you a little lesson on the Bible whenever Jesus went to be temped Ed by the devil Satan quoted him scriptures he took the Bible and he quoted him scriptures and they were inspired scriptures but his Direction was wrong because it wasn't the thought that God had intended it for and because his Direction was to stop the Son of God from fulfilling his purpose it would have destroyed you and I then Jesus could stand up there say yeah it's an inspired word but you ain't using it the right way he made it uninspired because he was used it in a different direction that's why as a pastor I'm obligated to protect this pull pit you can well that that he he only reads true things he only says true things but I'm o obligated to make sure that the inspired word of God is what's preached out of this pull pit and then the man that's standing behind this desk is going the same direction that we're going as a body you won't come behind this desk and take this church in another direction or take it down some different avenue or drag it down some pit or some other dead church somewhere this church is moving on with God it's an inspired Church an inspired people inspired by the message of the hour and there ain't nothing else is welcome in this place take it somewhere else they'll open a door for you to take it but it ain't no longer welcome here I want an inspired preacher I want inspired men of God I want inspired people of God that can take the word of God and make it effective no longer is it a place of non-affected that's what we ought to stand up and tell the devil I ain't a place of nonaffected but let the word of God become inspired in my heart that I might be a real believer and let me manifest the truth of God's word if it ain't changing in your life then there's something wrong with you leave the pull pit alone leave it to the leave it to those that are inspired by God and led by God to be there to lead God's children don't bring me No Junk it's an inspired word of God don't ask me to come up here and preach it's an inspired word of God I'm looking for inspiration of the word of God why because I want the direction that God wants to lead to in you say how can that be do you realize in the days of Moses this same thing you realize what happened remember when daythan and cor came up and they said well we're just as holy as Moses is what makes him the leader we'll just make our own we y'all come and worship with us well what was they trying to do they was trying to take the church in a different direction you know why they sit around a bunch of men that had sorry ideas and said that Moses wasn't the only one that could lead the church and they came into the Church of the Living God and they tried to bring the same thing in there and say well we can just go this direction because after all these are good men too and Moses said but God God told me to lead it and you're inspired but it ain't by it ain't by God and the Lord came to him you know what Moses did he didn't go and try to punish them the Bible says he fell down on his face and he was praying for them asking God for their mercy and you know what God told him because they had rebuked God in such a way it offended God so badly it offended God so badly he said Moses you get up you tell them to come and make a l a sacrifice unto me you tell them to come and burn incense before the temple he he said and then you get you and all your people away from Kora and all of his family because I'm going to destroy them so you know what Moses did he took a step back here he wanted to help them here he wanted to be a deliverer here he wanted to be their savior but God said you get away and take your hands on it off of it because it's an unclean thing that's why a man that's inspired by God don't go back and touch something that's unclean because God said stay away from it so he stepped back he said if I am telling you the word of the Lord he said then this day it won't be no light thing you won't go by the way of the his prophecies wasn't like these these false prophets make today but his prophecy was true he said if I speak through a prophecy it ain't going to be something you think that could have happened another way they ain't going to die of old age they ain't going to die of a sickness they're not going to get an ailment but I say unto you this day that the Earth will open up and it will swallow them in it and all that belongs to them and the Bible said when he got done speaking that the Earth opened up and here Kora and day and all their families or all all all that that was following after them that would fell down in the Earth and the Earth closed up over them and all of those that burn incense that was followers of them you know I they they went into the temple and the Bible says the the fire of God fell upon it and it burned all those men God didn't consume the incense he consumed the men why because they were uninspired here they were following this is what brother B call he actually calls Kora he said it's always the leaders in the church that gets people out of the will of God he said Kora was an uninspired leader he said Moses thinks he's the only holy man he said but we got as much holy men and here as he does he said see but God told Moses you separate from him I'll sink him in that whole group Moses was God's leader he was Vindicated by God to be a leader and all that didn't listen to him perish he said and we have a leader today he's called the Holy Ghost and those that don't obey the Holy Ghost the the one that wrote the Bible they are going to perish you know I could have Grace for Dayan but Cora how could you have Grace for cor you know why cuz cor had a position in the house of God but he wasn't satisfied with his position Kora he was the one that went in and he made preparation see dayam was of the tribe of Reuben but Kora was of the tribe of Levi so here a levite that was born in the house of Levi that came in the temple of God that had a place that had a place in the temple that God could use him but he wasn't satisfied with his place in the temple and he wanted more that's what Moses told him he said you can't do that and you want to be a priest also here God's gave you a way to serve him that you want to be a priest also but he was uninspired and God swallowed them up said see we have to follow our leader that's the Holy Ghost if they don't obey the Holy Ghost then they're going to perish you know what step back from them step back from them stay away from them don't entertain them step back from them see it must be inspired by the Holy Ghost you say brother Matt I want to see a Revival well then what you need is a man that's inspired by God and a people that can be inspired that's what'll bring a Revival in your heart it's a a word that inspires them something that moves that brings inspiration that that we can be like David and say I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever we need Aspire an inspired word that will cause us to dwell in the in the will of God how many can say that this morning I'll dwell in the inspired word of God y'all don't quit on me y let let me preach he said I want to I want to dwell in the inspired word of God you say how how can I be sure to be able to dwell in this place how can I live there forever give me a few minutes how how can I live there I've been preaching 40 minutes how can I live there forever he said I I want to find a place an inspired word of God that I can be sure that I can make it you say oh friends let me tell you you can't help but make it you can't help but make it you can you say how can I dwell in the house of the Lord forever in all these trials how can I dwell here in all these tribulations how can I stay in the word of God and all these failures how can I how can I keep my spirit how can I dwell in the house of the Lord let me tell you just as David was brother Morgan you can't help but dwell here you can't help but make it you know why cuz I can take these scriptures that are under inspiration and when you take a scripture under inspiration then the very power that they were written under it comes alive so when you take a a Bible that a verse that is inspired by God and you preach it under inspiration then the power that it was written under it becomes alive in the Assembly of God and it causes a Revival in Heart It causes you to be able to live another day it it's a refreshing it brings joy and sorrow it brings peace in a time of trouble because it's an inspired word listen to an inspired word of God how how can I make it how am I sure that I'll be able to make it how am I sure I'll be able to survive you know who I'm talking to how I'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever there ain't no telling how many people in this building are watching this server that Satan ain't came by and said that you you're just not going to be able to make it any longer you ain't going to be able to serve God any longer this was a temporary dwelling for you but you know what you don't even belong in the house of God but you belong in the world I've got something greater for you but David said but in the face of all that I'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever how can I be sure brother that I'll be able to dwell there can I just give you an inspired scripture I said can I give you an inspired scripture the Bible said Joshua in the book of Joshua every word that God spoke to Israel failed not somebody say Amen every word that God spoke it failed not a that something God's word don't fail in the Book of Luke whenever Mary begin to doubt the angel of the Lord listen what the angel said he said for with God nothing shall be impossible she said how can this thing be he said with God nothing shall be impossible let me tell you a testimony somebody else there's another cousin of yours her name's Elizabeth 6 months she's been with child and she was also buried just like you see with God nothing shall be impossible and that word in the Amplified Bible it means no word from God shall be without power or be impossible to fulfill so means if God says it it has to happen God's word Can't Fail somebody say that with me God's word Can't Fail somebody say it out loud God's word can't fail so you think about this when you look at these scriptures inspired used in the right context it will Express the mind of God see so in inspired scripture you take it the right way and the Bible says first off his word Can't Fail now watch the next scripture Galatians 3 an inspired word used in the direction God had intended it for listen what Paul said he said you are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus look what you do whenever you can be inspired by the word of God you can take scripture here here here and they all come together to show you the mind of God or or to express the very thoughts of God for this for the day that we're living even every every day is something relevant that God will take all these scriptures and bring them together to show you his mind this is what God's trying that's why we come to an assembly and hear the preaching of the word that's why that's why we have real life preachers that's why we have men that are anointed of God because we want God to use gifts that he's placed in the body to bring the word of God and to bring something out of the mind of God and present it to the people how many wants to hear the mind of God so Paul said for you are children of God by faith in Christ Jesus but said see so if you're a children of God in other words you're the sons or Daughters of God then that makes you a part of God how many believe that see my son's a part of me because he he he was from me so he's a part of me so if you're a Son of God or a child of God then you are a part of God so if you're a part of God and God is what what the Bible say God was his word so if you're a part of God then you're a part of the word of God you see these inspired scriptures coming together and that means if God's word can't fail and and you're a part of God's word then what's that mean about you that means that you can't fail it don't matter what the devil brings on your life you can't fail he can't take you out of the Church of the Living God he can't drag your soul into hell he can't turn you away from God because you're a part of God and God's word don't fail and you're part of God's word and you can't fail either that means you can never fail because you're in Christ Jesus brother Carter you you can receive salvation because you're in Christ Jesus you have power to over come because you're in Christ Jesus you can defeat every every enemy because you're in Christ Jesus every tormented spirit because you're in Christ Jesus you can stand the test of time because you're in Christ Jesus Oh friends if you go by the way of the Grave don't you worry you've already been buried in Christ and you were raised with him and one day you'll meet with him in the air that's old robe of Flesh don't let it bother you don't let it trouble you but my Bible said it was already paid for it calvary your salvation it don't matter what this robee's put on one day you'll put it off you'll put on another robe called immortality and you'll dwell with him in the air don't worry about it for the Bible said you can no more die then God can die what is it it's an inspired word for those of us that are looking at the face of death to know that I can't even die why it's inspired for our situation in the time of death in the time of sorrow in the Valley of the shadow of death you can look in the word of God and say what what did my shepherd say about it oh there it is he said you can no more die then God could die cuz you've already died and been buried with him and resurrected before there could be a judgment think about it those that are alive and remain will be called to meet him in the air don't worry about all this trouble that's going on in the world all these wars before there could ever be a judgment strike the Earth hear that little bride of Jesus Christ she'll go meet him in the air why because you're in Christ Jesus ain't that something David said A thousand shall fall at my side 10,000 at my right hand but it'll not come nigh thee because listen why he said all this may fall around me but it won't come nigh my house why he said he said because I have made the Lord my habitation why will trouble not come because I made the Lord my habitation see he said the the you you you will sit and because you made the Lord your habitation you will watch The Wicked receive their reward but it won't come nigh thee you'll watch them receive their judgment but it won't come nigh thee won't come your house he said there shall no evil befall thee can I read this Inspire word there shall no evil Beall thee how many does that inspire you and say brother Mt that's for me I know it was it inspired my heart when you read it there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague Come N thy dwelling why because you're dwelling in the house of the Lord you're in Christ Jesus he gave us a place to meet him he gave us a place to worship him let me tell you friends if you want to truly worship God you have to come to the right place listen what the Bible said here here the the the the Shepherds they said one to another let us go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us can I close with this let us go and see the thing let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing which the Lord has made known to us that word made known it means it was something that was revealed to them so here when God makes something known to you then you then watch first it was made known and then they went to Bethlehem see so until God makes it known to you then you can't even Worship in it but when God makes it known to you then you can worship in it and you can rejoice in it because he has made it known see notice what what it was here they were on their way to Bethlehem God made known to them something was going to take place so watch where they went when the Revelation was made known then here they go off to Bethlehem isn't it something that they went to Bethlehem brother Jared it was the place remember the Angels Came the Bible or or it would call it the First Noel the under the is born in the city of David Christ the lord it was the place that the Angels first made their appearance to sing it was at it wasn't at Jerusalem or some big church it wasn't at gilgal or some great place of worship it wasn't in shaloh the great place of history of historical worship but where it was it wasn't these great religious denominations in the world but where did the Angels make their appearance to sing they sung that great Noel they sang it in the city of David in the town of Bethlehem in this little old insignificant place is where the angels of the Lord went he said why was it there he said it was in Bethlehem where the spirit of God has been moving in a mysterious way so here something was made known to them and they said well what's been made known let us go to Bethlehem that we can see it with our own eyes we it's been made known to me it's been revealed to me now may I go to Bethlehem and the Bible said and the Shepherds went to Bethlehem and when they left Bethlehem I makes me want a shout when they left Bethlehem they returned and they were glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told to them when they left Bethlehem they left praising God when they left Bethlehem they left glorifying God they left worshiping him you see what happened something happened to them because they went to the right place to meet Jesus two years later there was wise men that seen a star in the east and they said we have seen his star they came to herod's place they said we've seen his star and we come to worship him where did they go they went to the town of Bethlehem to find this young man this young boy that was sitting there a 2y old boy with his mother and they brought gifts and the Bible says and they fell down and they worshiped at the feet of Jesus they fell down they worshiped him they gave him gold and frankincense and myr why because God had made something known to them and they went to the place of Bethlehem after it was made known and when they left Bethlehem they left rejoicing and glorifying and praising God because they went to Bethlehem they found him there you think about what Bethlehem was but said notice he said it was the cner the historians would tell you it was the great weak country it was a place of irrigation they had great weak crops but Bethlehem was also the place where the best water was so here this place of Bethlehem which was the house of God's bread it was the place where all the wheat was grown in the region but it was a place that was well known for its great Wells of water and great water he said it was the bread Center and the Water Center of Palestine he said so today it don't matter how many organizations we have it don't matter how many so-called brethren that we have they may be he said but still yet Christ is the believer's Bethlehem that's what God gave us that's the place that God has given us to go for he is our place of bread and water oh it's no wonder that the shepherd said let us now go to Bethlehem for this thing has been made known to us let's go to Bethlehem that we may rejoice in it let's go to Bethlehem that we may have Revival in it that we can leave praising and joy and a Revival could stack our heart again oh my than about it to see the things which the Lord has made known to us why do you go to Bethlehem because I want to see the things that God has made known I want to see him declared in my life I want to see what God has made known I want to see it manifested in my life let me tell you friends you me tell you how to do it I thank God today that we have a place to go brother Wesley the angel of the Lord has came today and you know what he done he came to make known the ways of God he came to make known the supernatural he came to make known the resurrection of Jesus Christ and now now as a body of Believers we take the thing that was made known in the and we go to the believer's Bethlehem and you know what'll happen you'll come away rejoicing you know why people can't rejoice in this message cuz they take the things that was made known and they go run it by Shiloh and see if it fits in they'll take the message that was preached that was made known by the angel and they'll go down to gilgal and see if they agree with it you know why they don't come away rejoicing and why they're troubled in their spirit and they can't get free and just worship God and believe the message of the hour that was sent by the angel of the lord it's cuz they trying to take it to the wrong place people say I'm at the wrong place at the wrong time I say we're at the wrong place with the wrong Revelation but what we need to do is go to the right place with the right Revelation and take what God has made known and when you go to the right place for the right Revelation it's a time for rejoicing I say it's a time for rejoicing this morning Jesus said I give you the power to tread on serpents and scorpions over the power of the enemy and nothing shall hurt you how many claim that this morning I give you the power how many will accept that I give you the power to tread on serpents I give you the power to tread on scorpions I give you the power to walk on spirits that would come and and and and destroy your home and destroy your relationship with your family I give you the power to tread them underfoot Jesus said but don't Rejoice because you have power over Spirits he said be Rejoice rather because your names are written in heaven h think about it you know why you can tell people that and they don't Rejoice cuz they don't know what it meant you know why you can quote that Rejoice that your name is written in heaven why can you say that and inspired scripture to somebody and it don't do nothing to them because it's not inspired to them they don't have a revelation see so notice what had to take place see before they don't Rejoice they don't they don't know what it means to have their name written in other words it hasn't been made known you know that you think about it what it meant to have your name written remember the Bible said there was a book of life our names were written in the book of life if you if you were to take one part out of the out of the out of the book it your name would be taken off the book of life it would be blotted out we find generations of people in Israel that names were taken off that book you realize that many would read that and say well our name can come off of it our name can't come off of it then we read in another place that said our name's written in the Lamb's Book of Life and our name can never be removed because it was written there before the foundation of the world see it hasn't been made known to you but here what God did is he sent an angel in this age and the angel of the Lord he began to speak in the breaking of the seals and whenever the angel of the Lord came what was he doing he was making known the mystery of God and when he made it known he said I want you to know about that book of life he said it's actually he said there's one great book it's the book of life he said but in it is another book it's called the Lamb's Book of Life That's why many people miss it he said it's just like looking at a wheat plant outside you say well there is wheat but really it's not wheat that one part of it's a stock part of it's a leaf part of it's a shook part of it's a a root but none of it only one little part of it is actually wheat but we call it all wheat he said so when God talks about the book of life he calls it all the same thing he said but whenever he's talking about the the one that Christ took the seal off of he said it was the Lamb's Book of Life it was the title de the book of redemption he said and when your name is written down in there there ain't nothing can take it out that means that you can't say something you can't take a word or add to or take away because your name has been written in the Lamb's Book of Life and brother B said it's all a part of that great revelation and it was made known during the time of the Seven Seals brother Wes you me tell you what we ought to do with it this morning I think we ought to take what has been made known by the angel and take it to Bethlehem that we can rejoice in it you know why because I want to be free to worship God I want to be free to have to Rejoice I want to be free to have a Revival so I think what we need to do is to stand for the word of God and to be able to take what God has given us what's been made known and take it to Bethlehem and come away rejoicing hear the voice of the Angel where he's made known the ways of God and then go to Bethlehem so it can be manifested to you as a reality don't you realize God sent an angel to make it known don't go to shalow and ask them what they think about it don't go to gilgal and don't don't go to Jerusalem and see if they agree with what the angel said but take what the angel has made known and go to the believer's Bethlehem his name is Christ Jesus and friends I declare unto you you'll come away rejoicing don't take it to a theologian don't take it to a historian take it to Christ Jesus why it's been made known and when you take it to the right place you'll leave rejoicing my think about it the Revelation take the Revelation to Christ that it can be manifested in our life I'm closing some music players want to come think about what he's made known he's made known the angel came to make known what true water baptism was you can go to all kinds of places and get all kinds of thoughts on it or you can take it to Bethlehem and come away rejoicing what the angel made known he made known The Mystery of the godhead you say where where should I take it I I got to go find out if the other people agree or if they think that right but don't take it to all them places take it to Bethlehem and you'll come away rejoicing the angel made known the the mystery of our future home that we ain't going to be some angels floating around in the clouds and passing through one another where we can't see each other said but I stood there and they come up and they greeted me what was it it was an angel of the Lord making known the mind of God said I stood there and I shook their hand our loved ones were there he said who are all you people they said where're your converts so I looked out there was millions of them what was happening why why would God send a message like that it was the angel of the Lord making known the mind of God you say brother Matt I heard it I heard the message of the Angel it's been made known unto me but now what do I do with it take take it to Bethlehem take it to Christ take it to the foot of the cross take it to Christ Jesus say Lord I Thank you for the Revelation you given me Lord I Thank you for showing me my future home when the world may wonder what it'll be like and where shall we be but I thank you for enlightening me of my future home and come away rejoicing he made known The Mystery of the book don't you realize what the angel does I love this you realize the angel in the end time the Bible would speak of that he was not an angel to bring questions many times an angel would come to ask a question could cause people to see where they were and the condition they were in and what and what was happening around them it would cause them to open their eyes but notice but when the angel comes he didn't come to ask a question he came to bring an answer to declare unto you the works of God and then God would give us a place to take it said bring it to Bethlehem Paul said having made known unto us the mystery of his will who the angel of the Lord according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ in the fullness of time he'll gather us all together in one place in Christ Jesus the Believers Bethlehem both they were in heaven and they that are on the Earth will be gathered in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who trusted in Christ do you trust him this morning you know how you know if you trust him because you take those things that have been declared unto you and you take them to him you don't go look to disprove him or try to find some thought you take it to Christ he said they trusted in Christ they trust his word they trust his leadership they trust the Holy Spirit they trust the voice of God and they show that trust by acting upon the trust that they have in him he said who trusted in him in whom we also trusted after you heard the word of the truth the gospel of your salvation you trusted in him in whom also after that you believed and you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise you know Paul could be standing here reading this today he could be you could be reading this to this body of people you know why this fits us today as if any Scripture ever does it's inspired for you today in whom you also trusted can you hear Paul say it in whom you also trusted after you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of your inheritance until the Redemption of that purchased possession unto the praise of his glory brother Westley we took it in what's been made known how many want to stand to your feet today say let me do that today let me take what's been made known unto me let me bring it to my Bethlehem to my place of water and bread and Lord would you feed it Lord would you would you water it Lord would you give me a place of rest Lord would you open your word up to me Lord let me just let me just Rejoice let me just rejoiced in Christ Jesus how many you lift your hand as you bow your heads say that's my prayer God bless you as the most the body raise their hand God bless you Saints true saints of God because that's the desire of our heart I don't know your heart I know my heart but the desire of my heart is to be found at the believer's Bethlehem is that your desire this morning won't you make it known to me by lifting your hands say Lord that's my desire you know my heart I want to be found in Christ I want to be found in this place of rest Lord help our church Lord this morning God troubled Lord you see Lord how the enemy Lord would come to destroy God to bring Confusion And Lead astray and take the Revival out of their hearts but Lord just because the spirit would get on one don't mean that everyone would fall to it it don't mean we would even kick them out

take this word and God Let It Be Inspired to their heart again God may they be inspired by the truth of the word Lord God they were not moved by feelings or families or family ties or following after

our what good is a word if it can't be manifested to us what good is a word if we can't live it if we can't declare it if it don't Inspire us but I thank God we have a place to go to gain inspiration isn't it wonderful this morning you love the Lord amen just want to reminder Wednesday night service has been moved to TU Tuesday night also want to make an announcement to the church just want to go over uh we've been we've been looking for a new new pews for the church and had a church that uh sister debet actually found that uh they had brand they were putting chairs in their church and so they had really nice pews they were kind of outdated on the color and everything but U but they actually donated them to the church so uh we went up with some brothers and picked them all up there there's 29 of them in total and um so we we had brought them here just thinking it was something that we could use to buy them new uh it's up the 30 to the $40,000 range uh to have them built uh the way we would like to have them but uh these had they great cushions great great support I put one out there in the forer that's not to be left there that ain't we we ain't changing the rock wall and we ain't giving the brothers a resting place at the end of the service while their wives are talking so it's just a Pew I wanted everybody to be able to see it we had a brother that took it and painted it the paint's expensive for that cabinet grade paint I believe it was I believe what he told me was around $150 a gallon to get the paint but they have to be disassembled uh the ends of them and the legs of them you'll see what they'll look like outside uh but he gave us a good price to to refurbish all the pews and so uh we'll be able to bring them in the sanctuary and it's actually enough pews that whenever we expand the walls of the sanctuary it's enough to do the whole church when we add the the extra 30 foot in width to the sanctuary will have the pews to be able to do it all and so that's what we've been uh been looking for so uh the brother would give us a price at $100 per Pew to do that so I uh it takes several hours to take them and sand them down and and to paint them he has to take them apart uh or or we're going to have to take them apart so uh we but we had uh he had gave us a price I told him I'd bring it before the church um it's something that we want to be able to do I spoke with the uh trustees about it about us getting the pews and everything and so um what we want to do is give the church an opportunity to to give toward it I Brothers came up with all sorts of ideas brother brother John was going to tell you all that this morning I think his wife left sick um but um but just uh uh you know we don't want to have no set price some people pay for so many or nothing like that we just want to leave it as an open offering if you have something you want to give towards it it'll be it'll be $22,900 to do all 29 pews um but uh I want you to go out there and see what you're investing in before before you before you do it so just go out and you can sit in and look at it the rest of them are all in the back uh and he said if we could do that quickly uh and we take them in the fellowship hall we'll take the ends off of them he showed me how to take them apart so uh we can get together in one afternoon and take the ends and everything off he'll come and pick up the ends take them all to their shop get them all painted bring them back and help assemble them and make them look like they are in the foer uh and he said he could have that done before our meetings so if that's if that's something that we can have the funds to be able to put towards if we can raise the money to do it then we'll put it we'll get to work on it right away and try to get them in the church and so I don't know about y'all but uh we've been y are some gracious people this church is filled with people that's been sitting on teeter totter pews uh I don't know if y'all ever sit on one end and got swung to the other but sometimes people get a little excited and they they jump up and sit back down the other person jumps I think everybody just praising the Lord and really they're on a teeter totter the more they just go at it like man they're just back and forth Just praising the Lord but you know these these pews came out of a a wooden church that was unleveled and so some of them were saw off different levels or concrete's actually level it's not the concrete that's unleveled it's the pews that we got so uh these new ones they come off of a concrete slab they were all level they're all they're all nice they're in very great condition so uh we look forward to having them in the church I want you to look at it and uh we're not going to ju just uh uh
