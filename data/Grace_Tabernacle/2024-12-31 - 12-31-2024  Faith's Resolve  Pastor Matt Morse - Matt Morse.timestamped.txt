[45:11] would amen well just after church y'all

[52:36] and we'll start in the eth verse we're

[52:40] and uh we just have a good time in the
[52:42] Lord tonight amen how many how many's
[52:44] okay with that just something I don't
[52:45] believe any of God's I know we say
[52:47] sometimes it's simple but I don't
[52:49] believe any of it is uh it may be simple
[52:51] to us but it has great meaning amen so
[52:54] uh it is the word of God is a value to
[52:56] uh so we don't want to be little
[52:58] anything in the word but just the Lord
[52:59] put this uh uh thought on my heart
[53:01] tonight so I just want to be able to do
[53:03] my best to bring it to you but we want
[53:05] to read out of the eth verse the Bible
[53:07] said we are troubled on every side yet
[53:10] not distressed we are perplexed but not
[53:12] in despair persecuted but not forsaken
[53:16] cast down but not destroyed how many can
[53:18] say Amen how many's been through that
[53:20] there we can all find our place in that
[53:22] scripture but Paul said always bearing
[53:25] about in the body of the dying of the
[53:26] Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus
[53:29] might be made manifest in our body said
[53:32] for we which Li live are always
[53:34] delivered unto death for Jesus's sake
[53:37] that the life also of Jesus might be
[53:39] made manifest in our mortal flesh in
[53:41] other words we're going to die to the
[53:43] flesh that the spirit or the life of God
[53:45] may be able to dwell in us so then death
[53:48] worketh in us but life in you for we
[53:51] have having the same Spirit of Faith as
[53:54] it was written in the scripture I
[53:55] believed therefore have I spoken and
[53:58] then Paul says we also believe and
[54:00] therefore we speak amen so I just want
[54:03] to ask the Lord to add his Blessing to
[54:04] the reading of the word and I'd like to
[54:06] speak tonight on Faith's resolve Faith's
[54:09] resolve here uh of course we're winding
[54:12] up a new year you know I thought about
[54:14] this ending of a year and how that we
[54:16] find oursel in the Final Chapter and uh
[54:19] you know uh uh the final chapter of 2024
[54:22] and you know if you if you sit down and
[54:24] maybe any of you's ever read a a a good
[54:26] book you know you get to the end of the
[54:27] book and you get to the final chapter
[54:29] and uh at the end of it when you close
[54:31] the book and you walk away brother
[54:33] Wesley there's the the last scenes of
[54:35] that final chapter they Linger on your
[54:37] mind and you know you can go outside and
[54:39] it just kind of something that always
[54:40] that lingers there for a little while
[54:42] and you know I thought that's the way it
[54:43] is here we're closing the book on a new
[54:45] year and you know it seems like
[54:47] sometimes that we'll just go over into
[54:49] the new year and everything's going to
[54:50] stay in 2024 and all the bad it's going
[54:53] to stay back there and all the the
[54:54] problems are going to stay back there
[54:56] and all the trials there everything that
[54:58] you went through but but you know all
[55:00] the things that may seem like it'd be
[55:01] behind you but you know just as it is
[55:03] when you close uh the chapter there's
[55:05] things that still Linger on there's the
[55:08] effects of the things that we went
[55:09] through in last year they uh they'll
[55:11] Linger on into next year you know the
[55:13] the decisions that you made last year
[55:15] they're going to they're going to have a
[55:16] lingering effect into next year some of
[55:19] the the trials and the uh things that
[55:21] you went through last year the effects
[55:23] of those trials they're going to linger
[55:25] you know they Linger on they linger in
[55:26] your mind they carry on into another
[55:28] year and I thought you know but wouldn't
[55:30] it be something tonight to be able to
[55:32] close the book on a year and when you
[55:34] close the book on it that that all those
[55:36] bad decisions was left back there and
[55:38] all those trials was left back there and
[55:40] all the how many would like to do that
[55:42] tonight to be able to just close the
[55:43] book on it and when you close it that
[55:45] all the things you done wrong and all
[55:47] the failures and all the the past that
[55:49] Brother David whenever you close the
[55:50] book tonight that it don't have to be
[55:52] reread it don't have to be something
[55:53] that's lingered and all those lingering
[55:55] thoughts and feelings and all the former
[55:57] troubles they could be forgotten and
[55:59] left back there and and you could go on
[56:00] into another year and and be able to to
[56:03] live in the grace of God I thought
[56:04] that'd be a wonderful thing tonight to
[56:06] be able to do you know and so I read
[56:08] this scripture Apostle Paul he says see
[56:10] he said we're troubled on every side and
[56:12] we're perplexed you know I thought we're
[56:14] troubled and we're perplexed in other
[56:15] words we're sometimes we're confused as
[56:18] of why the trouble has come our way we
[56:20] we find oursel in many troubles and he
[56:22] said but yet this comes but we're not in
[56:24] despair even when we're person
[56:26] persecuted we're not cast down when
[56:28] we're forsaken yet we're not destroyed
[56:30] so it doesn't matter what we've all been
[56:32] through this year but brother wesy we're
[56:33] all still here and we're not God hadn't
[56:36] kicked us out are you glad of that
[56:37] tonight he hadn't kicked you to the curb
[56:40] he hadn't done away with you he hadn't
[56:41] put you away I know sometimes people
[56:43] like to do that with one another but
[56:44] aren't you glad that God didn't put us
[56:46] away and he he hadn't kicked us out
[56:48] we've not been destroyed Brother David
[56:50] but here we are as a body of Believers
[56:52] on the last day of the year whenever
[56:54] many said we wouldn't make it and we
[56:55] wouldn't make it this this far we
[56:56] wouldn't make it this long but here we
[56:58] are anyway and we're standing in the
[57:00] grace of God in the middle of Grace
[57:01] Tabernacle talking about the wonderful
[57:03] works of a mighty God and and here
[57:05] staring at at a body of Believers that
[57:08] the grace of God has fellen upon their
[57:10] life isn't that a wonderful place to be
[57:12] tonight he say see we he said we we've
[57:14] been we having the same Spirit of Faith
[57:17] there's a reason why Paul said oh we're
[57:19] in we're this way he said because we
[57:21] have the spirit of Faith as it is
[57:23] written I believe therefore I have
[57:25] spoken he said therefore we also believe
[57:27] and we also therefore speak how many say
[57:30] Amen to that we are believers therefore
[57:32] we speak you know I thought of this
[57:34] tonight here here to have a resolve a
[57:37] resolve means to to decide firmly on a
[57:39] course of action or to declare and to
[57:42] declare it by a formal resolution how
[57:44] many know that's what taking place today
[57:46] all around the world today there's many
[57:47] resolutions that are being made I I
[57:49] looked at an online poll this evening
[57:51] and or or or or this afternoon it was
[57:54] talking about all the top resolutions
[57:55] that were taking place in the in the
[57:57] United States you know what people ask
[57:59] for they all the top ones it was it was
[58:01] they'd have more time with their family
[58:03] they would be able this year I'm going
[58:05] to volunteer more and Ne or or next year
[58:07] I'm going to cut back on my drinking and
[58:08] I'm G I'm G I'm G to get myself a new
[58:10] hobby and I'm going to I'm going to re
[58:12] remodel my house and I'm going to quit
[58:14] smoking and get a new career save money
[58:17] I'm going to lose weight I read through
[58:18] all the things that people wanted to do
[58:20] for next year you know and I'm I'm going
[58:22] to hit the gym I'm going to B bulk up
[58:24] and I'm going to get my body in shape
[58:25] and my I'm going to get stronger and
[58:27] more fit and I'm going to I'm going to
[58:29] be doing more of that and I'm going to
[58:30] feel better than I felt next year or
[58:32] last year and I'm going to have a better
[58:34] version of me in 2025 isn't that isn't
[58:36] that what everybody wants and you know
[58:38] as I got to reading that I thought you
[58:40] know I wasn't surprised at everything
[58:42] that made the list but brother Wesley I
[58:44] was concerned with the things that
[58:46] didn't make the list this was the top 10
[58:48] things that everybody in America wanted
[58:50] for next year and I thought you know
[58:52] they're all good things maybe we all
[58:53] need to I couldn't find any of them that
[58:56] wouldn't be a bad idea to do but you
[58:57] know I I was concerned about what didn't
[58:59] make it you know because as I read
[59:01] across that list for the Wesley I found
[59:03] out that there was nothing on that list
[59:05] that was Everlasting there wasn't one
[59:07] thing on there that had an everlasting
[59:08] effect they were they were everyone
[59:10] focused on the natural man they talked
[59:12] about natural things and they talked
[59:14] about carnality and I thought you know
[59:16] here here it is that these Natural
[59:17] Things obviously natural things are
[59:19] important I realize that they they have
[59:21] some value in our lives we ought to we
[59:23] ought to consider sometimes the things
[59:25] that we go with we ought to we want to
[59:26] we want to have a good job we want to
[59:28] manage our finances we want to show up
[59:30] for work we want to take care of our
[59:31] family you realize those are all natural
[59:33] things but they're good things and I
[59:35] believe that we ought to all do that I
[59:37] it wouldn't it be a sad thought to have
[59:39] a a dad that wouldn't take care of his
[59:41] family or wouldn't that he would neglect
[59:43] them he would mismanage the uh the
[59:44] family's money or wasteful spending he'd
[59:47] buy cigarettes and alcohol and gambling
[59:49] and wasting all their money on material
[59:51] things and then the the family being
[59:53] neglect because of what the father would
[59:55] do and the the whole time he's praying
[59:57] with God would you bless my family
[59:58] friends let me tell you God can't bless
[1:00:00] your family until you get out of the way
[1:00:02] and let God bless your family see see
[1:00:04] God is looking for a way to bless your
[1:00:06] family he's looking for a way in and
[1:00:08] many times we allow these material
[1:00:10] things to stop God from doing what God
[1:00:12] wants to do with us I think about most
[1:00:15] people I don't mean to give you a
[1:00:16] financial lesson but you know what it's
[1:00:18] it's New Year's Eve we may as well go
[1:00:19] there but but but but most people that's
[1:00:21] what all the businesses are doing today
[1:00:22] they're taking checks and balances to
[1:00:24] see where they are but most people get
[1:00:26] into trouble because they because they
[1:00:28] look at what other people have and they
[1:00:30] have a desire you ever see social media
[1:00:31] today it's great with display and what I
[1:00:34] have it ain't it ain't about telling
[1:00:35] somebody happy birthday it's letting the
[1:00:37] world know that you told them happy
[1:00:38] birthday I if you really wanted to tell
[1:00:40] somebody happy birthday you'd call them
[1:00:42] and say brother I love you and I just
[1:00:43] want to wish you it'd be it'd be but
[1:00:45] everything's an announcement it that's
[1:00:47] the way it is today and I I thought how
[1:00:49] but that people they write so many
[1:00:50] things and people have a desire to have
[1:00:52] what other people have but the problem
[1:00:54] is is the devil has made it easy for you
[1:00:57] to obtain the things that other people
[1:00:58] have even though you can't afford to
[1:01:00] have it and so then you wind up getting
[1:01:02] yourself in trouble and you get you're
[1:01:04] get in a great bind and then you get so
[1:01:06] bound up naturally that you can't move
[1:01:08] spiritually and you get so behind in the
[1:01:10] natural you may as well let me preach
[1:01:11] tonight it's the gospel truth you get so
[1:01:13] bound up in the natural because nobody
[1:01:15] had enough to tell you brother don't
[1:01:17] covet what thy neighbor has that's the
[1:01:19] tenth commandment don't cover what thy
[1:01:21] neighbor has don't cover his house don't
[1:01:22] cover his Ox don't cover his sheep don't
[1:01:26] covet the land that he has don't covet
[1:01:27] what your neighbor has you know what the
[1:01:29] Bible you know why the Bible said not to
[1:01:31] covet what thy neighbor has the Bible
[1:01:33] says don't covet it because a covet is a
[1:01:35] longing desire to have what somebody
[1:01:37] else has and if you long to or have a
[1:01:39] longing desire to have it then you just
[1:01:41] lo and behold in a little while you're
[1:01:43] going to make sure that you get it and
[1:01:45] then you're going to wind up in trouble
[1:01:46] and you're going to wind up up all bound
[1:01:48] up and you and you can't be free in the
[1:01:50] spirit that's why that's why Jesus would
[1:01:52] preach this he took that very tenth
[1:01:54] commandment and he preached it to the
[1:01:55] disciples he said take heed and beware
[1:01:58] of covetousness for a man's life
[1:02:00] consists not in the abundance of things
[1:02:03] which he possesses Now watch how Jesus
[1:02:05] Takes this from the natural and he turns
[1:02:07] it to the spiritual he says your life is
[1:02:10] not a sum of everything that you possess
[1:02:12] in the natural he said but but but your
[1:02:14] life what we ought to do is we ought to
[1:02:16] take no thought for our life and what we
[1:02:19] shall eat and nether for the body and
[1:02:21] what you shall put on isn't that
[1:02:22] something Jesus said don't take no
[1:02:24] thought about your life don't take
[1:02:26] thought about what you eat don't take
[1:02:27] thought about your body don't take
[1:02:29] thought about what you're putting on or
[1:02:30] the clothes that you go wear but isn't
[1:02:32] it something that the very things he
[1:02:34] said don't take thought of is the thing
[1:02:36] that people think about the whole time
[1:02:37] they're sitting in church most the
[1:02:39] people come in the house of God they're
[1:02:41] thinking about their life and they're
[1:02:42] thinking about their problem and they're
[1:02:44] thinking about their bills and they're
[1:02:45] thinking about going clothes shopping or
[1:02:47] what this person's wearing or what that
[1:02:49] person's wearing or what we're going to
[1:02:50] eat when we get out of church I thought
[1:02:51] isn't it something here The Very thing
[1:02:53] he said don't think about is what's on
[1:02:55] the m mind of everybody but Jesus turned
[1:02:57] it he said don't think about those
[1:02:59] natural things he said for your life is
[1:03:01] more than meat and your body is more
[1:03:03] than Ren for consider the raven that has
[1:03:06] no barns to be able to build up and and
[1:03:08] and to be able to harvest fruit and
[1:03:10] build up his barns he said but the Lord
[1:03:12] feeds the Raven and how much more
[1:03:13] valuable are you to God than a bird is
[1:03:16] valuable he said consider the Lily that
[1:03:18] even in Solomon's fine Glory has never
[1:03:21] been anybody a raid like the Lily was a
[1:03:23] raid he said but God he would one that
[1:03:26] he would take the Lily it would live and
[1:03:28] then the next day tomorrow it'd be cast
[1:03:29] into the oven and if God would clothe
[1:03:31] the Lily then how much more would he
[1:03:33] clothe you he said seek not what you
[1:03:36] shall eat or what you shall drink
[1:03:38] neither be of a doubtful mind but notice
[1:03:40] what God is doing here's a
[1:03:41] transformation taking it's taking place
[1:03:43] tonight here's a transformation how many
[1:03:45] like to be transformed it's a
[1:03:47] transformation that is taking place what
[1:03:49] is he doing he's trying to get our mind
[1:03:51] in order Jesus said don't don't put
[1:03:53] these things take no thought on these
[1:03:55] things don't put them things in front of
[1:03:57] God he said you know in other words
[1:03:58] Jesus said for your father knows that
[1:04:01] you have need of those things but notice
[1:04:03] what he does but if you will seek the
[1:04:06] kingdom of God and all these things will
[1:04:09] be added unto you you know what Jesus
[1:04:11] says think about this in other words God
[1:04:14] don't want you to seek the kingdom of
[1:04:16] God so you can be without this is way
[1:04:18] people paint the picture seek the
[1:04:19] kingdom of God you don't have to you
[1:04:21] don't have to worry about the job you
[1:04:22] don't you just go to church you don't
[1:04:23] have to worry about work you don't they
[1:04:25] make all all these things but but it it
[1:04:27] wasn't to seek the kingdom of God so
[1:04:29] that you couldn't be provided for he
[1:04:31] said but seek the kingdom of God and
[1:04:33] then all of these things will be added
[1:04:35] unto you in other words that God says
[1:04:38] seek the kingdom of God not that you
[1:04:39] wouldn't be or that you would do without
[1:04:42] but that your life would be in a proper
[1:04:43] order and Jesus said fear not for it is
[1:04:46] the Father's good pleasure to give you
[1:04:48] the kingdom isn't that wonderful aren't
[1:04:50] you glad you have a rich daddy somebody
[1:04:52] turn to somebody by them and say I got a
[1:04:53] rich Daddy it's the father's good
[1:04:55] pleasure to give you the kingdom and we
[1:04:57] have a daddy that owns the cattle the
[1:04:59] Bible said a father that owns the cattle
[1:05:01] on a thousand hills I believe he's a God
[1:05:04] that has the that has the ability to
[1:05:06] give gifts how many believe that tonight
[1:05:07] somebody say he's a Gift Giver he's a
[1:05:09] God that has the ability to give you
[1:05:10] what you have need of so when you come
[1:05:12] to the house of God tonight you come
[1:05:14] prepared to be able to receive what God
[1:05:16] has for you I think he's a god that is
[1:05:19] rich in Mercy he's a god that is rich in
[1:05:21] Grace he's a god that is Rich the Bible
[1:05:23] said he's rich in his glory I thought
[1:05:26] you know if God was to give us a gift
[1:05:27] tonight what would be a great gift that
[1:05:29] God could give to a body of Believers
[1:05:31] with all the riches that he could give
[1:05:33] what would be a great gift let me let me
[1:05:34] tell you what Paul said he said whenever
[1:05:36] he when he wrote to the Ephesians he
[1:05:38] said I am a prisoner of Jesus Christ he
[1:05:41] was a man that was bound to the cause of
[1:05:43] Christ Brother David he was a man that
[1:05:45] had a history of KN knowing what it was
[1:05:47] to Once being a prisoner to the flesh
[1:05:49] but now he was a prisoner to Christ he
[1:05:51] said I was a prisoner to the world I was
[1:05:53] the worst Christian that there ever was
[1:05:55] but Jesus he CAU me and he won me he
[1:05:57] converted me and now I'm a prisoner of
[1:05:59] Jesus Christ I'm I'm no longer a
[1:06:01] prisoner of the devil but I'm a prisoner
[1:06:03] of him and he said by Grace I was saved
[1:06:06] I was called of God for this cause and
[1:06:08] now I bow down on my knees before God
[1:06:10] and here Paul is praying for the people
[1:06:12] of God here a man that was called of God
[1:06:15] a prophet of God that was called to be
[1:06:17] the uh to be the uh the prophet for the
[1:06:19] gentile people here here here he would
[1:06:21] call he said I'm down on my knees and
[1:06:23] I'm praying for you you know what Paul
[1:06:25] asked for he said that God would Grant
[1:06:27] you according to the riches of his glory
[1:06:30] we're talking about a rich God a god
[1:06:32] that is able to give Paul said but I'm
[1:06:35] praying that God would give you
[1:06:37] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:06:39] be strengthened with might by his Spirit
[1:06:42] In Your Inner Man of all the great gifts
[1:06:45] that God could give Paul said I'm
[1:06:47] praying that he would strengthen your
[1:06:49] inner man he knew what it would take for
[1:06:52] a Believer to make it through the trials
[1:06:54] in the oncoming days he knew knew
[1:06:55] through the oncoming ages what it would
[1:06:57] take for a Believer to make it through
[1:06:59] the tribulations that they would face
[1:07:01] and and through the tests that they
[1:07:02] would have to go through and Paul said I
[1:07:04] pray that God would strengthen you in
[1:07:05] your inner man it was his desire that
[1:07:08] you would have something that would get
[1:07:09] you through when Paul wasn't there it
[1:07:11] would that God would give you something
[1:07:13] that would get you through when the
[1:07:14] pastor wasn't around that God would give
[1:07:16] you something that would get you through
[1:07:17] when your mama wasn't there no more and
[1:07:19] we when you was all alone living out in
[1:07:21] the world and Satan was coming against
[1:07:23] you he said I want you to have something
[1:07:25] that could cause you to be able to win
[1:07:26] the
[1:07:27] battle it's a gift that God would give
[1:07:29] you in all of the riches of his glory I
[1:07:31] pray that he'll give you strength in
[1:07:33] your inner man a strength to be able to
[1:07:35] withstand think about it what Paul was a
[1:07:38] man that knew what it was like to battle
[1:07:40] the flesh can I preach it he knew what
[1:07:42] it was like to battle the Flesh and so
[1:07:43] Paul said here he said when I would do
[1:07:45] good evil is present with me here was a
[1:07:47] man that that knew he he went through
[1:07:49] trials just like you and I face but you
[1:07:51] know what he prayed for he said that God
[1:07:53] would strengthen the inner man in other
[1:07:55] words that has to be something that
[1:07:56] could help you face these great trials
[1:07:58] you know I thought about how you know
[1:08:00] the number one resol resolution this
[1:08:02] year was exercise it was the strengthen
[1:08:05] the Natural Body I thought but whenever
[1:08:07] you read Paul's resolve it wasn't about
[1:08:09] strengthen the natural man he said but
[1:08:10] what we really need is to strengthen the
[1:08:12] spiritual man you know cuz sometimes
[1:08:15] this man is in the flesh and sometimes
[1:08:17] he's in the spirit what we need is a
[1:08:18] strength of the spiritual man I know
[1:08:20] sometimes we get in the flesh and
[1:08:21] Friends most of the time I just say it
[1:08:24] like this all the time when you get the
[1:08:25] flesh that's whenever you get in trouble
[1:08:27] you remember Samson when he got in the
[1:08:28] trouble is because of the because he was
[1:08:31] out there in the flesh and he went out
[1:08:33] and he set people's fields on fire and
[1:08:34] he wound up laying in the lap of of
[1:08:36] Delilah he got in all kinds of wrecks in
[1:08:38] his life because he was in the flesh but
[1:08:40] then the Bible would say but then the
[1:08:42] spirit of the Lord fell mightily upon
[1:08:44] him and when the spirit of the Lord fell
[1:08:46] on him all of a sudden he done the works
[1:08:48] of God he done Mighty works of God he
[1:08:50] was a judge over Israel he he drove out
[1:08:53] those that didn't belong in the land
[1:08:54] because the spirit of the Lord fell upon
[1:08:56] him see sometimes We're In the Flesh
[1:08:59] sometimes we're in the spirit and I
[1:09:01] think what happens is some sometimes I'm
[1:09:03] just preaching a New Year's Eve sermon
[1:09:04] so y'all just going have to give me the
[1:09:05] grace to do it but sometimes we get so
[1:09:07] much in the flesh that we can't get free
[1:09:09] no more sometimes we're so bound up in
[1:09:12] the spirit in our spirit that that we're
[1:09:15] not even who we really are you can't you
[1:09:17] you you used to praise God used to come
[1:09:19] to church ready to have church you used
[1:09:20] to bring your Bible to church God forbid
[1:09:22] people do that today but you used to
[1:09:24] come prayed up and ready to get in an
[1:09:26] atmosphere in the presence of God that
[1:09:28] the Holy Ghost could come by that you
[1:09:30] could worship in the presence of God it
[1:09:32] wasn't just a place to go to fellowship
[1:09:34] with one another but it was a place to
[1:09:36] have communion with God but we get so
[1:09:39] caught up in our spirit and things of
[1:09:41] this life they that we allow them to get
[1:09:43] in they build up and before long we got
[1:09:45] these great mountains that's built up in
[1:09:47] our life that there ain't no way you
[1:09:48] could come in in a service and a song
[1:09:50] leader knock it out of there there ain't
[1:09:52] no way you can just depend on a preacher
[1:09:54] to come and tear it all down but there
[1:09:56] has to something has to happen in order
[1:09:58] for that to be moved out of our life
[1:10:00] things get great they get built up great
[1:10:02] things but you realize you say well how
[1:10:04] they get there it's because we have
[1:10:05] gateways in our life just like our flesh
[1:10:07] we have gateways the gates of the flesh
[1:10:09] see tastes feel smell and here so so
[1:10:12] it's the same way with our spirit in our
[1:10:14] spirit we have gates to our spirit it
[1:10:16] was imagination and conscience and and
[1:10:18] memory and reasoning and affections and
[1:10:21] all these things are gateways I I think
[1:10:23] how how it is that that that people
[1:10:25] build up these great mountains you
[1:10:27] realize how easy it is to build up a
[1:10:28] mountain from your
[1:10:30] imagination all you have to do is think
[1:10:32] about what somebody did when they walk
[1:10:33] by you or what somebody said or and
[1:10:35] before long our imagination takes over
[1:10:37] and we build up mountains against
[1:10:39] another person or Mountain that keeps
[1:10:41] you from having Fellowship mountains
[1:10:42] that keep you from being able to feel
[1:10:44] free in the house of God because the our
[1:10:46] imagination is an easy way to pile up a
[1:10:49] stone on a mountain reasoning is a stone
[1:10:52] on the mountain brother Jared to to take
[1:10:54] the word well I know that's word it may
[1:10:55] be good for that brother but after all
[1:10:57] he's a preacher and I'm not so I don't
[1:10:59] think that could apply to me it's easy
[1:11:01] to reason things out of your reach and
[1:11:04] add stones to the mountain we build
[1:11:05] these things up the prophet of God said
[1:11:07] he said see it's your mind that opens
[1:11:10] the door to those things and closes the
[1:11:12] door he said it listen your mind listens
[1:11:14] to your conscience it listens to your
[1:11:15] memory it listens to your affections but
[1:11:17] when your mind closes itself to those
[1:11:19] things and you'll let God but when you
[1:11:22] let God and the spirit of his word come
[1:11:24] in it'll blow the rest of the stuff out
[1:11:27] every doubt will be gone amen somebody
[1:11:29] every fear will be gone every sensation
[1:11:31] of Doubt every feeling is gone there
[1:11:34] ain't nothing standing there but the
[1:11:35] word of God and Satan cannot battle
[1:11:38] against that how many say Amen isn't it
[1:11:40] wonderful to have something that Satan
[1:11:42] can't battle against he he said how can
[1:11:44] we get there well we need the strength
[1:11:45] in our inner man we need to be
[1:11:47] strengthened to where that where we can
[1:11:49] be able to stand against the devil when
[1:11:51] he would come and try to build these
[1:11:52] things up in our life you say well well
[1:11:54] brother man how how how can we overcome
[1:11:56] the devil in that way it's by our faith
[1:11:58] how many knows that's what the Bible
[1:11:59] teaches it's by it's by our faith the
[1:12:01] Bible and the Bible says that we have a
[1:12:02] way to obtain Faith so it's not
[1:12:04] something that is far-fetched that you
[1:12:06] can't have freedom is not something
[1:12:08] that's far-fetched that you can't have
[1:12:10] Liberty in the house of God is not
[1:12:12] something far-fetched that you can't
[1:12:13] have but it's something that is
[1:12:15] attainable to every believer say how do
[1:12:17] I get it notice he said well we have to
[1:12:19] have faith the Bible says faith cometh
[1:12:22] by the hearing of the word of God how
[1:12:23] many believe that amen you know what
[1:12:25] happens when a man has Faith he can do
[1:12:27] the things that are seem impossible
[1:12:29] because he has Faith so Faith notice
[1:12:32] what all the things Faith does the Bible
[1:12:33] says faith Shields you and remember it
[1:12:35] was our part of the Statue of a perfect
[1:12:37] man it's a shield it guards you from
[1:12:39] from unbelief your faith guards you from
[1:12:41] things that would come in from the
[1:12:42] outside and how the enemy is always
[1:12:44] looking for a way in but our faith
[1:12:46] guards us from those things he said in
[1:12:49] in Ephesians 2 Paul said even he said
[1:12:51] you're saved by grace through faith so
[1:12:53] we think about our faith we're shielded
[1:12:55] by faith we're Saved By Faith we're
[1:12:58] healed by faith we believe by faith we
[1:13:00] walk by faith we live by faith we die by
[1:13:04] faith if we Rapture out this world we're
[1:13:06] going to Rapture by faith that's the
[1:13:07] only way that's that's that's God's
[1:13:09] program that that's how God operates in
[1:13:11] the in the body of Believers is by faith
[1:13:13] in him that's what took Goliath or or
[1:13:17] David down to the down to the field of
[1:13:19] Goliath to be able to stand against that
[1:13:21] great big giant is because he had Faith
[1:13:23] remember what remember how but B tells
[1:13:25] that story I love it he said he went
[1:13:27] down there and he picked up five five
[1:13:29] Stones it was F AI t h you said well
[1:13:32] what kind of faith that that David had
[1:13:34] that would cause him to be able to stand
[1:13:36] against a giant well let me just tell
[1:13:37] you we we may as well preach anyway but
[1:13:40] but what what would he have let me let
[1:13:41] me tell you what happened see before
[1:13:43] David had ever went to face Goliath
[1:13:46] David had a meeting with a Prophet by
[1:13:47] the name of Samuel how many remember
[1:13:49] that here when he was just a little
[1:13:50] 15year old boy and Samuel had went into
[1:13:53] the town of Bethlehem and he called upon
[1:13:55] Jesse and I can just see Samuel walking
[1:13:57] in there as he called on he said I have
[1:13:59] I saw a vision from the Lord and hear
[1:14:01] that old Prophet come into that town and
[1:14:03] around you can just see the prophet had
[1:14:05] you know had that belt around him I I
[1:14:07] just picture it this way but he had that
[1:14:09] old belt around him and had that horn of
[1:14:11] oil on his side and here he walking that
[1:14:13] long robe and walked into town and he
[1:14:15] had a vision from the Lord he went and
[1:14:16] called upon Jesse said tell Jesse to
[1:14:18] bring his sons cuz God has called me to
[1:14:21] do something in this city so Jesse came
[1:14:23] and brought the sons and they come down
[1:14:24] to the place there and Samuel began to
[1:14:26] talk to him he said the Lord has told me
[1:14:28] that one of your son is going to be the
[1:14:30] king over all of Israel well imagine
[1:14:32] what what Jesse must have thought he
[1:14:34] said well here's my fine son he must be
[1:14:36] the one and samon said no that wasn't
[1:14:38] the one in the vision well what about
[1:14:39] this one no that wasn't one in the
[1:14:41] vision with this one he's built up quite
[1:14:42] a kingdom what about him he's got quite
[1:14:44] a business what about him no it wasn't
[1:14:46] him he's not the one in the vision and
[1:14:49] after a little while he said I ain't got
[1:14:50] no I only got one more son little old
[1:14:52] David out there Shepherd and the Sheep
[1:14:54] he Ian he ain't never going to make
[1:14:55] nothing out of nothing he he he ain't
[1:14:57] got the mind like these other guys have
[1:14:59] and you know they might could build him
[1:15:00] up a pretty good denomination but this
[1:15:02] David I don't know what we what we' do
[1:15:04] with him but but samon said well bring
[1:15:06] him out and when he came he said that's
[1:15:07] the one I saw in the vision see a
[1:15:09] prophet came with a vision of the Lord
[1:15:11] to anoint him to be the king over Israel
[1:15:13] and you notice what David done the Bible
[1:15:15] tells us how when he would come down
[1:15:17] before Samuel and David had to kneel
[1:15:19] down before the prophet and the
[1:15:21] anointing oil that was in the Horn of
[1:15:23] the prophet he opened it up brother and
[1:15:25] he dumped it over the head of David he
[1:15:27] said by the word of the Lord he he gave
[1:15:29] me a vision and the and by the word of
[1:15:31] the Lord you shall be the king over all
[1:15:33] of Israel let me tell you something
[1:15:35] friends when David stood up from that
[1:15:37] very place he was anointed to be the
[1:15:39] king of Israel he was a 15y old Shepherd
[1:15:42] but he was still anointed to be king of
[1:15:44] Israel he took back let me tell you what
[1:15:46] David done he took the scraggly clothes
[1:15:48] that he was wearing in his little old
[1:15:49] scraggly bag and he walked right back
[1:15:51] down to the sheep that was on the hill
[1:15:53] but he was still the anointed king over
[1:15:55] all of Israel I thought it didn't matter
[1:15:57] where David went he was anointed to be
[1:15:59] king it didn't matter if he went to the
[1:16:01] field he was anointed to be king it
[1:16:03] didn't matter if he faced the lion he
[1:16:04] was anointed to be king it didn't matter
[1:16:06] if he faced to Bear he was anointed to
[1:16:08] be king and it didn't matter what
[1:16:10] happened when he went down to the field
[1:16:12] of Goliath cuz David was an anointed man
[1:16:14] of God and anointed to be the king over
[1:16:17] all of
[1:16:18] Israel those people get so discouraged
[1:16:21] and we get mixed up and we get concerned
[1:16:23] with the battle because we have great
[1:16:25] Giants in our lives but let me tell you
[1:16:27] friends the real Victory it wasn't won
[1:16:29] in the valley standing down there with
[1:16:31] Goliath the real Victory it wasn't one
[1:16:34] in the valley of Eli the real Victory it
[1:16:36] wasn't one in the presence of all the
[1:16:38] armies of Israel it wasn't a great
[1:16:40] public Victory but the real victory that
[1:16:42] David won is when he surrendered to the
[1:16:45] anointing of the prophet of God it was
[1:16:47] when he knelt down on his knees and
[1:16:49] allowed the prophet of God to pour out
[1:16:51] the anointing of the Lord Jesus upon his
[1:16:54] life that would raise up and be the king
[1:16:56] or be what God had called him to be
[1:16:58] because he surrendered to the anointing
[1:17:00] because he believed what God said about
[1:17:02] him because he believed thus sayith the
[1:17:04] Lord that's where the real victory was
[1:17:06] won and then it didn't matter feel like
[1:17:08] preaching then it didn't matter where he
[1:17:09] went it didn't matter what devil would
[1:17:11] come against him it didn't matter what
[1:17:13] giant that he fac because he had he had
[1:17:15] been anointed by the prophet of God to
[1:17:18] be the
[1:17:19] king he could walk in the valley he
[1:17:22] could walk before Giants he could face
[1:17:24] any enemy me because he had been
[1:17:26] anointed that's what we need tonight we
[1:17:27] need faith in the anointed word that's
[1:17:29] been poured over our life you realize
[1:17:31] what David had he had faith in the
[1:17:33] anointed word that old giant was stand
[1:17:35] up there oh you send me a little boy
[1:17:37] like this well what a joke you are to
[1:17:39] send me a boy but David didn't care what
[1:17:41] he said he said how dare you defy the
[1:17:43] armies of the Living God you come to me
[1:17:45] with spear and a sword but I come to you
[1:17:47] in the name of the Lord he never feared
[1:17:50] why didn't he fear because he was
[1:17:52] anointed by the prophet of God he
[1:17:55] surrendered to the prophet's anointing
[1:17:57] and from the horn think about it from
[1:17:59] the Horn of a prophet he poured it over
[1:18:01] him that's what we need tonight from the
[1:18:03] Horn of a prophet the word of God has
[1:18:05] been spoke over our life from the Horn
[1:18:07] of a prophet you've been anointed in
[1:18:09] this hour to overcome from the Horn of a
[1:18:12] prophet it wasn't just something some
[1:18:14] man-made thought but from the Horn of a
[1:18:16] prophet you've been anointed to be able
[1:18:17] to overcome and lay all to see
[1:18:19] it that's what we need tonight is the
[1:18:22] faith in the anointed word of God
[1:18:25] pouring over us that we can believe all
[1:18:28] things are
[1:18:29] possible do matter what the giant
[1:18:32] says Jesus said if you have the faith as
[1:18:34] a grain of mustard seed you shall say to
[1:18:38] what to this
[1:18:40] mountain be removed and it shall remove
[1:18:44] and nothing shall be impossible to you
[1:18:46] somebody say Amen how many believe that
[1:18:48] nothing shall be impossible to you you
[1:18:50] know what that tells me what makes me
[1:18:52] feel like preaching faith that faith
[1:18:54] slays
[1:18:56] Giants and Faith moves
[1:18:59] mountains is't that something in other
[1:19:01] words so you you when you come you have
[1:19:03] mountains in our life there's mountains
[1:19:06] that's been built up these great
[1:19:08] mountains of imagination and mountains
[1:19:10] of reasoning and mountains of con all
[1:19:12] these things that's been built up in our
[1:19:14] spirit but let me ask you a question
[1:19:16] tonight how many Believers are in this
[1:19:18] building raise your hand I want I want
[1:19:19] to I want to know I want to know where
[1:19:20] you're pretty much all of them a hundred
[1:19:22] or so Believers s see but not just any
[1:19:26] kind of believer I'm talking about real
[1:19:28] Believers how many real Believers are
[1:19:30] here you you want to know what a real
[1:19:32] believer is let me read it to you real
[1:19:33] quick before you commit to it but said a
[1:19:35] true or a spiritual believer is one that
[1:19:37] has been baptized into the body of
[1:19:39] Christ and is a member of him so we're
[1:19:42] not a member of a church but we've been
[1:19:43] baptized not by water but by the spirit
[1:19:45] of God and we've been baptized into the
[1:19:48] body of Christ by his spirit and now we
[1:19:50] are a member of him how many believers
[1:19:51] do we have here tonight says so then
[1:19:54] when the word of God comes into you it's
[1:19:57] made manifest for you are a
[1:20:00] Believer says see and a Believer is how
[1:20:02] many wants to know this he said a
[1:20:04] Believer is the faith of God that moves
[1:20:07] in
[1:20:08] you what a statement the believer is the
[1:20:11] faith of God that moves in you let me
[1:20:14] ask you this so if the faith of God is
[1:20:16] moving in you because you're a Believer
[1:20:18] if the faith of God is moving you then
[1:20:21] or in you then what is it moving Glory
[1:20:25] what's it moving it's moving Every
[1:20:26] Mountain it's moving every giant it's
[1:20:29] moving every trial it's moving every
[1:20:31] spirit that Satan would would try to put
[1:20:33] up your life because the faith of God is
[1:20:35] moving in you it the faith isn't resting
[1:20:38] in it it isn't sitting in you the faith
[1:20:40] of God is moving in you you realize so
[1:20:42] when Satan would come there's something
[1:20:44] in you that would move it would it would
[1:20:46] act against the spirit that would come
[1:20:48] upon the believer let me tell you what
[1:20:50] we have tonight we have a God that has
[1:20:52] something moving in the heart of every
[1:20:54] believer
[1:20:55] that when Satan would try to come in
[1:20:57] there's something that's moving out
[1:20:58] against you I say let God let go and let
[1:21:01] God move tonight let him move in every
[1:21:03] heart let him move in every life let him
[1:21:05] push out every enemy let him move Every
[1:21:07] Mountain out of your life that you could
[1:21:09] be free in the presence of God it's a
[1:21:11] faith that is moving in you to move out
[1:21:14] everything that don't belong said what
[1:21:16] does it do it establishes you as a
[1:21:18] Believer that's what faith does the
[1:21:20] Bible says so believe in the Lord your
[1:21:22] God so that you shall be established
[1:21:24] believe his Prophet so you shall prosper
[1:21:27] God has given us a way to be able to
[1:21:29] stand just like David stood because I
[1:21:32] stood under the anointing of the prophet
[1:21:34] of God the very words that a prophet
[1:21:37] spoke I've been anointed by an anointed
[1:21:40] word that was spoke by an anointed man
[1:21:41] of God I allow the Horn of the Prophet
[1:21:44] to be dumped over my life therefore I
[1:21:45] can stand in the face of the enemy and I
[1:21:47] know I can make it he said that's what
[1:21:50] establishes you that you know who you
[1:21:52] are think about Jesus see Jesus had to
[1:21:55] be established too he had to know who he
[1:21:56] was I got a minute or did I run out of
[1:21:58] time see see he knew he was without a
[1:22:00] shadow of a doubt he knew he was the son
[1:22:02] of God because the word of God
[1:22:04] identified who he was that's what Jesus
[1:22:07] said so if I don't if I do not the works
[1:22:08] of my father don't believe me but if I
[1:22:10] do the works of my father then believe
[1:22:12] me he said see because they are
[1:22:14] manifested word promised so if you could
[1:22:17] just wake up brother B said if you could
[1:22:19] just wake up to that a minute that the
[1:22:20] works of God they are the manifested
[1:22:23] word promised to you if you could wake
[1:22:25] up to that a minute that the word itself
[1:22:27] identified who he was it wasn't what
[1:22:30] Jesus was doing it was what the word had
[1:22:32] said he would do that identified who he
[1:22:34] was so he was identified by the prophecy
[1:22:36] that went forth and because he
[1:22:38] manifested that prophecy the word was
[1:22:40] identified in him so see so the word
[1:22:42] itself identified him who he was and
[1:22:45] then he said well who can condemn me of
[1:22:46] sin in other words who can show me that
[1:22:48] my life and my Works don't fulfill
[1:22:50] exactly what the Messiah should do
[1:22:52] nobody could say nothing because that's
[1:22:53] who he was so then he had Faith to
[1:22:56] believe that whatever he said would
[1:22:58] happen because the word identified who
[1:23:00] he was my isn't that good word
[1:23:02] identified that's what I want to be
[1:23:03] tonight word identified I I don't want
[1:23:05] to be just a church identified or Pastor
[1:23:08] identified or or or friend identified or
[1:23:10] Mom or Daddy I want to be word
[1:23:12] identified I want to be I want the word
[1:23:14] of God to be so real in me that you can
[1:23:17] that you can look at my life and
[1:23:18] identify who I am well there goes a
[1:23:20] Believer right there there goes a
[1:23:21] daughter of God right there there sets a
[1:23:23] Son of God back there why cuz their word
[1:23:26] identified said see then he could turn
[1:23:28] around and say the works that I do shall
[1:23:30] you do also why could he say that
[1:23:33] because it was really the father that
[1:23:34] done the works he said the father that
[1:23:35] done the works for me he shall be in you
[1:23:37] he'll do the same works that he done in
[1:23:38] me so that's why he could say to the
[1:23:40] disciples the works I do shall you do
[1:23:42] also he said see that's that was the
[1:23:44] brother said that was the identification
[1:23:46] of a scriptural Christian that these
[1:23:48] words that Jesus said these signs shall
[1:23:50] follow them that believe that's the
[1:23:52] identification of a scripture Christian
[1:23:54] Christian these signs shall follow them
[1:23:56] that believe you you can call yourself a
[1:23:57] Believer but deny those words how can
[1:23:59] you call yourself a Believer and deny
[1:24:00] any of his word you can't do it you're
[1:24:02] not a Believer therefore signs can't
[1:24:04] follow you because you just accept what
[1:24:06] you want to believe and the rest of it
[1:24:08] you don't want to believe it but if
[1:24:09] you're real believer then you'll take
[1:24:11] the whole thing and you'll believe it
[1:24:13] that means the stuff that feels good
[1:24:14] you'll still say Amen the stuff that
[1:24:16] feels bad it says Oh Me Oh My out told
[1:24:18] brother would you stop and give me a
[1:24:20] break you still say Amen because a real
[1:24:22] believer the real believer will except
[1:24:24] the whole word of God say see he'll
[1:24:26] believe it the whole thing he'll believe
[1:24:28] it said when you truly believe then not
[1:24:30] when you make believe but when you
[1:24:32] really believe then these signs will
[1:24:33] follow them that believe so let me ask
[1:24:35] you that again tonight are you a
[1:24:37] Believer are you a Believer can I tell
[1:24:40] you can I tell you a few things about a
[1:24:42] Believer you know there's a lot of
[1:24:43] things about Believers that are
[1:24:45] different there how many how many's
[1:24:47] having a good time in the Lord tonight
[1:24:48] there's a lot of things about Believers
[1:24:50] that are different some believers they
[1:24:51] like they they they they uh like to hear
[1:24:54] certain kind of song Some believers they
[1:24:56] they they have different kind of
[1:24:57] cultures they're from different
[1:24:58] countries they they they they use
[1:24:59] different instruments there you know
[1:25:01] there's there's a lot of things that are
[1:25:02] different about Believers we're not all
[1:25:04] the same hello somebody I know that I
[1:25:06] know that troubles some people cuz if
[1:25:07] you ain't just like them well then then
[1:25:09] you must be not you must not be of God
[1:25:11] because we're of God so you must not but
[1:25:12] not all the Believers are the same the
[1:25:14] Bible say there's a diversity of gifts
[1:25:16] you know what that means there's some
[1:25:17] people sing there's some people that
[1:25:18] shouldn't sing there's some people that
[1:25:20] preach and there's some people that
[1:25:21] shouldn't preach you know why cuz they
[1:25:23] wasn't called to do it there's a
[1:25:24] diversity of gifts some men have been
[1:25:26] given the gift of healing some the gift
[1:25:28] of tongues or interpretation there's a
[1:25:30] diversity of gifts not all believers are
[1:25:32] the
[1:25:32] same I know the world don't like that
[1:25:35] because they're trying to make everybody
[1:25:36] the same this sick devil today is trying
[1:25:38] but that's not the truth we're not all
[1:25:40] the same we like different things we
[1:25:42] like but but but we're not we we're
[1:25:44] diverse but you know as I thought about
[1:25:46] this we're not all the same but you
[1:25:48] realize that there are some things that
[1:25:50] every believer has you know I got to
[1:25:53] think about that today so just went in
[1:25:54] the message and got to went through
[1:25:56] there and I thought I'm going to find
[1:25:57] out everything that the prophet said
[1:25:59] that all the Believers have so I kind of
[1:26:01] as I went through there I found he
[1:26:02] starts talking about Peter and how that
[1:26:04] they came down the day of Pentecost and
[1:26:06] the and the and the Holy Ghost poured
[1:26:08] out on the day of Pentecost and he came
[1:26:09] out with that great message and he said
[1:26:11] repent every one in the name of Jesus
[1:26:13] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[1:26:14] the Holy Ghost he said that it was the
[1:26:17] same promise the same manner that fell
[1:26:19] that gave them eternal life just like
[1:26:20] the manner that carried the children of
[1:26:22] Israel through the Wilderness the Holy
[1:26:24] Ghost is what G what God has poured out
[1:26:26] that would carry the church through to
[1:26:28] Glory so just like they had the Mana
[1:26:30] we've got the Holy Ghost he'll carry you
[1:26:32] through and he said every man that come
[1:26:33] to Christ that'll believe that he said
[1:26:35] he will give that that will give up
[1:26:37] their sins and throw their arms to God
[1:26:39] and and he said he and not just some
[1:26:41] imitation but he'll be full of a genuine
[1:26:44] heartfelt real baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:46] just like it fell on the day of
[1:26:48] Pentecost and it'll make the same signs
[1:26:50] and wonders and everything else will
[1:26:52] take place it'll make you act the same
[1:26:53] way you'll act like a drunk man you'll
[1:26:56] carry on just like they did on the day
[1:26:57] of Pentecost I know people don't believe
[1:26:59] it no more but it's the truth said
[1:27:01] you'll carry on just like they did on
[1:27:02] the day of Pentecost and every believer
[1:27:05] has a right to receive it so we may all
[1:27:08] be different in a lot of things but
[1:27:10] every believer has a right to receive
[1:27:12] the fullness of the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:14] Ghost but friend that ain't all that
[1:27:16] every believer had a right to receive he
[1:27:18] said God gave many blessings there's
[1:27:20] many Redemptive blessings he said but
[1:27:22] every believer has a possession
[1:27:24] of every Redemptive blessing that God
[1:27:26] has ever given isn't that wonderful to
[1:27:28] be a believer that ain't all that ain't
[1:27:31] all that we have a right to you know how
[1:27:32] the churches today they go out these
[1:27:34] great denominations if you're not a part
[1:27:36] of the church you can't take communion I
[1:27:37] love what a prophet said he said it's
[1:27:39] called a close communion because you got
[1:27:41] to join the church in order to be able
[1:27:42] to take it he said but we're not a
[1:27:44] denomination therefore we have an open
[1:27:47] communion for we believe that every
[1:27:50] believer has a right to the table of the
[1:27:52] Lord how many Say Amen
[1:27:54] so every believer has a right to it I
[1:27:57] just think about more of them how you go
[1:27:59] over in the Eastern countries and they
[1:28:01] you know they bring a monarch that would
[1:28:02] come to be a king or a queen you know
[1:28:04] when it comes time for a change in the
[1:28:06] monarchy and they would bring them out
[1:28:08] they have a day that they would receive
[1:28:10] their royal power it's called a
[1:28:11] coronation day and you know that what
[1:28:13] that is it's a it's a a formal investure
[1:28:17] of their power in other words they would
[1:28:19] they would come down and they'll kneel
[1:28:20] down before the leaders and they'll
[1:28:22] they'll come and they'll they'll
[1:28:23] announce them and they'll put the crown
[1:28:24] or the crown on their head and they'll
[1:28:26] say who they are and now the power that
[1:28:28] was in the kingdom is given unto that
[1:28:30] one because it's their coronation day I
[1:28:33] love what prophet said in the message
[1:28:34] hear ye him he said but every believer
[1:28:38] has a time of Coronation in other words
[1:28:41] you have a time when God pulls you out
[1:28:43] of the crowd he said and he touches your
[1:28:45] heart you know what's he doing he's
[1:28:47] coronating us to give the power of the
[1:28:49] Holy Ghost to our lives every believer
[1:28:52] has a time of coronation every believer
[1:28:54] has a time when the power of the kingdom
[1:28:57] is bestowed upon his life see what
[1:28:59] happens you stand before Christ and you
[1:29:01] accept what he gave you you received the
[1:29:03] right to overcome the flesh you received
[1:29:05] the right to overcome the devil Oh my he
[1:29:08] he said many things in other place in
[1:29:10] the message time test to memorials every
[1:29:12] believer they don't have to worry about
[1:29:14] dying and going by the grave or whether
[1:29:16] they Rapture he said cuz every believer
[1:29:18] has already passed from Death unto life
[1:29:20] I say I'm glad to be a believer are you
[1:29:23] glad to be
[1:29:24] believer he said this is every believer
[1:29:28] Cas can I tell you a couple more I'm
[1:29:30] going hurry and close he said every
[1:29:32] believer has a sacred stand on the back
[1:29:35] side of a desert they have a place they
[1:29:38] can point back to and say that's where I
[1:29:40] met God may have been on an altar
[1:29:42] somewhere may have been on the on the on
[1:29:44] a on a a tree stump out in the woods
[1:29:46] praying
[1:29:47] somewhere wherever it was but every
[1:29:49] believer has a place that they can point
[1:29:51] back and know they met God but you know
[1:29:54] there's also some things that every
[1:29:56] believer has to do so if you're going to
[1:29:58] be a believer Now by your own confession
[1:30:01] you remember whenever Naomi she went
[1:30:03] back into Bethlehem and Ruth made the
[1:30:06] decision to go with her but mam said see
[1:30:08] she had to decide to go and make a
[1:30:10] decision where she was going to decide
[1:30:12] to go whether she would go or not he
[1:30:13] said she had to make that decision and
[1:30:15] that's what every believer has to do so
[1:30:18] first you had to make a decision every
[1:30:19] believer that I'm going to follow the
[1:30:21] word I'm going to I'm going to follow
[1:30:23] what God wants to life and you surrender
[1:30:24] to God he said then you come back in
[1:30:26] another message the mark of the beast
[1:30:28] say you come back just like Abel did and
[1:30:30] Abel went and made his sacrifice of his
[1:30:31] lamb and Abel had to lay on Abel lost
[1:30:34] his life because of the sacrifice that
[1:30:36] he made remember he lay he sacrificed
[1:30:38] the lamb and Cain was so jealous he took
[1:30:40] his life he said but every believer has
[1:30:42] to do the same thing Abel done he has to
[1:30:45] die on the rock with his lamb in the
[1:30:48] days of Ahab and Micaiah remember
[1:30:50] whenever Ahab all those 400 prophets
[1:30:53] would come by and say it's okay to go
[1:30:55] into battle but here Micaiah had a
[1:30:57] vision from the Lord and he couldn't do
[1:30:59] but what God told him to do so he said I
[1:31:01] know the vision is according to the word
[1:31:03] of God and if you go out there you're
[1:31:04] just going to die he said he spoke the
[1:31:06] word anyhow he was willing they said
[1:31:08] we're going to throw you in prison Mah
[1:31:10] if you don't agree with everybody else
[1:31:11] if you don't go along with what we think
[1:31:13] you ought to do we're going to throw you
[1:31:14] in prison but he was willing to go to
[1:31:16] prison he said and today every believer
[1:31:19] has to fight just like he did we had to
[1:31:23] be willing to fight for what we believe
[1:31:25] why because we're Believers is there
[1:31:27] something see but God he's equipped us
[1:31:29] as Believers with the greatest weapon he
[1:31:31] gave us he gave us the word that we
[1:31:33] could overcome the devil I know what the
[1:31:35] devil tells you he says well that's just
[1:31:36] for preachers and that's just for elders
[1:31:38] and you know I can't find that stuff in
[1:31:40] the Bible like that I I can't bring all
[1:31:42] that out but let me tell you what the
[1:31:43] prophet said he said it's for every one
[1:31:45] of us every believer has a right to take
[1:31:49] this word and fight the enemy anywhere
[1:31:51] you meet him isn't that wonderful you
[1:31:53] ain't got to wait on a preacher to come
[1:31:55] by to combat the Devil with the word of
[1:31:57] God but every believer has a right to
[1:31:59] take the word of God and stand against
[1:32:01] the devil anywhere he wants to meet you
[1:32:03] you say brother M I don't feel like I
[1:32:05] had the power to beet him well friends
[1:32:06] it ain't the power that you have it's
[1:32:08] the power that he has for the prophet
[1:32:10] said but every believer has the
[1:32:12] authority to use the power of God
[1:32:14] against the
[1:32:15] devil we ain't looking for power every
[1:32:18] believer has Authority let me ask you
[1:32:20] this tonight are you a
[1:32:22] Believer amen how many believe we have
[1:32:24] here go ahe and raise your hand again
[1:32:26] that's all we need tonight as a body of
[1:32:28] Believers Brother David we need a
[1:32:30] restored faith in the anointed word of
[1:32:32] God that was poured over our life here
[1:32:35] can you just see this as a prophet would
[1:32:37] begin to say what a Believer was you
[1:32:40] realize that's the same thing that David
[1:32:41] done that day when he was kneeling down
[1:32:43] before Samuel he was waiting to hear
[1:32:45] what Samuel would prophesy over his life
[1:32:47] David didn't know that about his life
[1:32:49] but once it was prophesied over his life
[1:32:51] he accepted what the prophet said and he
[1:32:54] went on and fulfilled what he was
[1:32:55] supposed to do and here God has given us
[1:32:58] that same opportunity tonight to hear
[1:33:02] the anointed word of a prophet of God
[1:33:04] that by Vision he was able to pour that
[1:33:06] out on your life and saying this is who
[1:33:08] you really are I know the devil tells
[1:33:10] you all kinds of stuff and who you you
[1:33:13] ain't never going to make it you're a
[1:33:14] make believer you're you're an
[1:33:15] unbeliever I know people get that all
[1:33:17] mixed up but well you know after all in
[1:33:18] every Church there's unbelievers and
[1:33:20] make Believers and Believers and you
[1:33:22] know what I believe that and I believe
[1:33:24] that every one of us used to be every
[1:33:26] one of them we all used to be
[1:33:28] unbelievers and we all used to be make
[1:33:30] Believers then one day we were a
[1:33:31] Believer so don't look down on the
[1:33:33] unbeliever and look down on the mate
[1:33:34] believer cuz they're only where you used
[1:33:36] to be but what we ought to do is make a
[1:33:38] way that they can get to where we are
[1:33:39] cuz we want some real Believers and I
[1:33:41] believe that everybody has a right for
[1:33:43] that I believe that ought won't you
[1:33:45] stand to your feet tonight I believe
[1:33:46] that ought to be our commission as a
[1:33:48] body of Believers is to bring people
[1:33:50] into that and to bring the message of
[1:33:52] the hour to them that they could be a
[1:33:54] believer in the anointed word of God
[1:33:57] that's been poured out of the Horn of a
[1:33:59] prophet upon our life amen we're
[1:34:02] Believers but the David we're anointed
[1:34:04] to believe the word yes sir we've been
[1:34:06] anointed to receive the Holy Ghost amen

[1:34:19] many say that T I have heard and now I
[1:34:22] speak you know why because you're a
[1:34:25] Believer how many believe that
[1:34:28] tonight I'm not just any kind of
[1:34:30] believer I'm a word identified

[1:34:57] the anointing is being poured out I
[1:35:00] heard of things that I have
[1:35:03] and possessions that I ought to possess
