[27:30] through all the wreckage I had learned.
[27:34] And there's one thing that I could never

[28:19] And I've seen the rain turn the stream.

[30:01] Take the world away from me and I'll be
[30:06] okay.

[36:18] For you are all things.
[36:22] To you are all things.
[36:26] You deserve all the glory.
[36:30] And I know you're worthy of it all. I
[36:36] make it declaring worthy.
[36:38] I say you're worthy of it all.
[36:43] My Jesus.
[36:45] Oh, I know how. You are all things.
[36:50] You are all things.
[36:53] You deserve the glory.
[36:59] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[37:00] clap of praise tonight? How many say
[37:03] he's worthy?
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Say he's worthy.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he wonderful?
[37:09] &gt;&gt; God has never failed us.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; No matter what we've ever gone through,
[37:13] he's always been there. Even when you
[37:16] don't know God's moving in your life,
[37:18] he's operating.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; He's moving things out of the way and
[37:21] moving things in in the way.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; I believe God does that just to keep us
[37:26] in his will. I mean, appreciates the
[37:28] Lord this morning or tonight. And
[37:31] &gt;&gt; my just a privilege to be able to be in
[37:33] the house of God. And maybe we just bow
[37:36] our heads together. If you have a need
[37:37] on your heart uh tonight, I know God is
[37:40] certainly mindful of what we have need
[37:42] of. And maybe just something special
[37:44] you'd like to see the Lord do for you
[37:46] tonight. I believe that we have a right
[37:48] to approach him. And
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes he's a
[37:51] supernatural God? Amen. We we're not
[37:53] just coming to uh to church just to have
[37:56] a place to go on a Wednesday night, but
[37:58] we really know that we're in the
[38:00] presence of God. So, won't we just ask
[38:03] him to move this evening? Gracious
[38:06] heavenly father, Lord, we are so
[38:08] thankful, Lord, for
[38:11] this opportunity just to be able to come
[38:13] and stand in the house of God, Lord, a
[38:17] place that's been dedicated for your
[38:18] word to go forth.
[38:20] Lord, we come as recipients,
[38:23] Lord. We just ask you tonight, Lord,
[38:25] that you would meet every need. Lord, I
[38:27] pray that you would help each one, Lord,
[38:29] and knowing the needs that's on the
[38:31] hearts of the people tonight. Lord, that
[38:34] you're such a mindful God. Lord, I pray
[38:36] that you would help us, Lord, here
[38:37] tonight. Lord, I pray for Becca, Lord,
[38:39] having her baby tonight. Just ask the
[38:41] church to remember her. Lord, I ask you
[38:43] would meet every need. Lord, I pray you
[38:45] would take this word, Lord, and it would
[38:47] open it to us, Lord, that something
[38:49] would be said, would be edifying to the
[38:50] church. We thank you for it now. In the
[38:53] name of the Lord Jesus, we pray. Amen.
[38:57] Amen. We sure love the Lord today. Amen.
[39:01] We just love his word and love his
[39:03] people. Amen. How many love the people
[39:05] of God? They're just a wonderful ain't a
[39:08] better class of people on the earth than
[39:09] God's children. Uh and I believe that.
[39:12] And they're all over the world. and uh
[39:14] they they come from every different
[39:15] background and every uh demographic and
[39:18] God has raised his children up all
[39:20] around the world and uh has made a great
[39:22] class of people. I'm sure certain
[39:25] certainly uh privileged to be able to
[39:27] say I'm one of them tonight. Amen.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; So we just appreciate uh the people of
[39:32] God and sure appreciate uh the meeting
[39:35] we had there. Brother Davis had a great
[39:37] report and many of the young people that
[39:39] received the Holy Ghost. David sent me a
[39:41] text about it today and many was
[39:44] delivered of things. So, uh you I just
[39:47] know that the Lord is always in control.
[39:49] We can't ask for anything more than that
[39:51] uh than to somebody to further their
[39:53] walk with God. And uh I watched the
[39:55] service on Sunday and just the Lord was
[39:58] really uh uh helping the church here.
[40:00] Brother Joe, I sure appreciate that. I
[40:02] know many of you uh went up for the
[40:05] meetings in Hardy. Brother Andrew was
[40:07] speaking there and had a great blessing.
[40:09] heard great reports from that as well.
[40:11] So, we just appreciate everything God is
[40:13] doing
[40:14] &gt;&gt; and we certainly want to give God the
[40:16] glory for it. Amen.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we we know that he is more
[40:20] than able. How many just love the word
[40:23] of God? Amen.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Won't you just turn around, shake
[40:26] somebody's hand this morning or that? I
[40:28] don't know why it's morning. I guess I
[40:30] miss Sunday morning and I can't get out
[40:32] of it. But tonight, we're just going to
[40:35] have church tonight. Okay. Amen. We just
[40:37] want to invite you to the scripture.
[40:39] We're going to read out of the book of
[40:40] St. Luke in the first chapter and we'll
[40:42] read from the 13th verse. Give you just
[40:46] a moment to turn there. Luke uh 1 and
[40:49] 13. And I just say it's good to be home.
[40:52] Amen. There ain't there there ain't no
[40:54] place like home. That's the truth. Amen.
[40:56] I just just love being at our at our
[40:59] home church. And uh it's I'm hardressed
[41:02] to leave. I don't I don't like to go uh
[41:04] many places, you know. It's kind of an
[41:06] odd thing. I used to love to to go
[41:08] everywhere. I thought I was a world
[41:09] traveler and uh and I couldn't wait till
[41:11] the next time I could go somewhere and
[41:14] but whenever God changes or or leads you
[41:17] into a calling uh that being a pastor,
[41:20] you can't just be a pastor and and want
[41:22] to be gone all the time and then you
[41:24] probably ain't got a real calling to be
[41:25] a pastor. But I just love being home. I
[41:28] love the the people that God has brought
[41:30] together here and I sure love you and I
[41:33] just want to be able to speak something
[41:34] tonight that would be a help to you. So
[41:36] we're going to read out of Luke the 1st
[41:37] chapter 13th verse. The Bible says, "But
[41:39] the angel said unto him, fear not,
[41:41] Zachcharias, for thy prayer is heard.
[41:45] And thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a
[41:47] son, and thou shalt call his name John.
[41:50] And thou shalt have joy and gladness,
[41:52] and many shall rejoice at his birth, for
[41:54] he shall be great in the sight of the
[41:56] Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor
[41:58] strong drink, and he shall be filled
[42:00] with the Holy Ghost, even from his
[42:02] mother's womb. And many of the children
[42:04] of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
[42:06] their God. And he shall go before him in
[42:09] the spirit and power of Elias to turn
[42:12] the hearts of the fathers to the
[42:14] children and the disobedient to the
[42:16] wisdom of the just to make ready a
[42:19] people prepared for the Lord. Now we we
[42:22] realize that this is a fulfillment of
[42:24] what uh God had promised in Malachi the
[42:27] 3r chapter and and part of the fourth
[42:29] chapter uh that there was coming the
[42:31] spirit of Elijah upon the earth and he
[42:33] would do those very things. And so uh I
[42:36] want to take this scripture tonight and
[42:37] I'd like to speak on responding to God's
[42:40] response as you take your seats.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Responding to God's response. I realize
[42:46] in the Bible that there are nearly uh I
[42:48] was looking through different uh
[42:50] scholars that there's anywhere from uh 7
[42:53] to 8,000 uh different promises in the
[42:56] Bible that pertains to the believers.
[42:58] The Bible's filled with promises that
[42:59] God uh has made to us. And I know that
[43:02] that each one of us in this life that we
[43:04] go through uh many trials, many needs
[43:07] that we have and a lot of times that we
[43:10] have to rely upon God. And uh the Bible
[43:12] tells us that as say as many are the
[43:14] afflictions of the righteous. So we know
[43:16] it's not uh that we won't go through
[43:18] things but brother Ram talks about our
[43:20] trials and the things that we face. He
[43:22] says but we have a consolation uh in all
[43:24] those trials. And our consolation is
[43:26] God's promise. He said and in his
[43:28] promise he said to make our requests
[43:30] known. If you ask anything in my name
[43:32] I'll do it. These are his great
[43:34] promises. Ask and you shall receive. Say
[43:36] to this mountain be moved and don't
[43:38] doubt in your heart and it'll be moved.
[43:40] that all of these promises we can draw
[43:42] from all that we are asking for. And I I
[43:44] think that's our right as believers that
[43:46] we have. How many believes that tonight?
[43:48] That we have a right to draw from the
[43:50] promises of God. So I believe that the
[43:52] word teaches us as believers that we uh
[43:55] that we have a right to petition God for
[43:57] our needs. So as believers, we become
[43:59] petitioners uh for the needs that we
[44:01] have. And you know, you know, I think
[44:03] about that as we are petitioning God
[44:05] many times. Sometimes uh that but
[44:07] sometimes when we when we call upon God
[44:09] for things, you realize that some things
[44:11] that you ask God for are actually not a
[44:13] promise of God. You know, sometimes we
[44:15] I'm just being honest with you.
[44:17] Sometimes we ask God for things that
[44:18] aren't a promise at all. And uh
[44:20] sometimes we ask God for things that we
[44:22] don't actually need.
[44:24] You know, when I when I think about
[44:25] this, it makes my makes me think of one
[44:27] of the most important keys to having a
[44:30] relationship with God. How many wants to
[44:32] know what it is? That that is that you
[44:34] have to trust God.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; How many knows that you you just in
[44:37] order to have a real relationship with
[44:39] God, you just have to be able to trust
[44:40] the Lord? Because uh sometimes we we ask
[44:43] God for things. Sometimes we really need
[44:45] things. Sometimes we really need God to
[44:47] do something and it don't really need to
[44:48] be done and we don't we don't really
[44:50] need it and it ain't going to really
[44:51] bring us favor and it's not really going
[44:53] to help us at all. And you know
[44:54] sometimes we have a great zeal to do
[44:56] something for God. Uh but but it's not
[44:59] in the will of God for us to do it. I
[45:01] you know there's in the Bible tells a
[45:02] story of David whenever he was in that
[45:05] same place. You remember David was a
[45:06] great man of God. I I can't think of
[45:08] anybody else in the Bible that was any
[45:10] greater than King David. The Bible said
[45:12] he was a man after God's own heart. He
[45:14] was a He was a great man of God. He was
[45:17] a great warrior. He had many great
[45:19] testimonies that happened out of David's
[45:21] life. He he took down Goliath. He helped
[45:23] uh uh many times to deliver the children
[45:26] of Israel from that great Philistine
[45:27] army that was rising in the same time of
[45:30] David's reign. He was a great man of
[45:31] God. And uh but even David whenever he
[45:34] went to petition the Lord because he had
[45:36] something on his heart to do. He wanted
[45:38] to build a temple for God. And he said,
[45:40] "You know, I I've been living in this
[45:42] nice cedar house and here God has
[45:44] delivered us and God has done so much
[45:45] for us and why would I let God dwell out
[45:48] there in a tent made out, you know, he's
[45:50] been drugged around the tabernacle of
[45:51] God's been an old tent, been drugged
[45:53] through the wilderness all this time and
[45:54] and all this time, you know, uh we've
[45:57] been building our own selves and taking
[45:58] care of our own places, but you know, I
[46:00] need to do something for God." So, he
[46:02] went to the to the prophet Nathan. And
[46:04] even Nathan told David that you're a man
[46:06] of God and you have the favor of God. So
[46:08] do anything that's on your heart to do.
[46:10] I'm sure that God would bless it. And so
[46:12] here this was this was on David's heart.
[46:15] But then God came in the middle of the
[46:16] night. Remember what he told Nathan. He
[46:18] said, "You go back and tell David that
[46:20] that is not for him to build." So he got
[46:22] up the next day and he said he's not
[46:23] permitted to build the temple. He
[46:25] couldn't do it. He said, "Because I'll
[46:27] raise up from your seed that he will
[46:29] build the temple of God, and that temple
[46:31] will be an everlasting temple. And and
[46:32] from thy seed upon your son, the son of
[46:35] David will be an everlasting kingdom. He
[46:37] would be established forever." And you
[46:39] realize what God is doing is that he was
[46:41] actually using the son of David in the
[46:43] natural to t the son of David that was
[46:45] coming in the spiritual. He said, see,
[46:47] so after this, he wouldn't let David do
[46:49] it. But Solomon, that was David's son in
[46:51] the natural. When Solomon was born, he
[46:53] went out and he in his natural strength,
[46:56] he built a house unto the Lord and it
[46:58] was a glorious thing and it was welcomed
[47:00] by God and the spirit of the Lord was in
[47:02] the temple of God. He said, "But then
[47:04] when the real seed of David came that
[47:05] was the son of David, he told them that
[47:07] there's going to come a time that there
[47:09] won't be a stone left upon a stone of
[47:11] this temple that Solomon built." And he
[47:13] turned and pointed the people to another
[47:15] temple uh that would have that would
[47:17] fulfill what God had told David. It
[47:19] would be an everlasting kingdom. That
[47:21] temple that Solomon built was not
[47:22] everlasting. It was not it wasn't going
[47:24] to last forever. But he was pointing to
[47:26] a temple that would never be destroyed.
[47:28] It was Christ in the power uh uh it was
[47:31] God in the power of Jesus Christ. He
[47:33] that he would rule over all things. He
[47:35] became the high priest of our
[47:37] confession. And you realize that even
[47:39] that's why Jesus would say, "You can
[47:40] destroy this temple, but in three days
[47:42] I'm going to raise it up again." He was
[47:44] fulfilling the word of God to the
[47:46] prophet Nathan. So you realize that God
[47:48] had a plan for it. And God h had a a
[47:52] purpose for the temple to be built by
[47:53] the son of David. And so here he told
[47:56] David, you can't go do that. But you
[47:57] know what David done? He just trusted in
[47:59] the Lord. He didn't go out building the
[48:01] temple. He trusted that God knew better.
[48:03] Even though it was a zeal on his heart.
[48:05] I I know it'll preach, but sometimes it
[48:07] isn't for you to do. Sometimes it's for
[48:09] somebody else to do. Sometimes we get
[48:11] something on our heart. You know, I
[48:13] think I might just do this. And God
[48:14] says, "Well, it ain't for you to do."
[48:16] Sometimes we want to preach, but it
[48:17] ain't for us to preach. Sometimes you
[48:19] want to sing, but it ain't for you to
[48:20] sing. Sometimes you may want to go do a
[48:22] great work. You may want to go uh stand
[48:24] on the out there in the street and start
[48:26] some great revival or something, but but
[48:28] sometimes it just isn't for us to do.
[48:30] And God knows all things. You know, I I
[48:33] think one of the greatest places we
[48:34] could ever come in our walk with God is
[48:36] that sometimes we just need uh uh the
[48:39] wisdom to be able to thrive in the
[48:41] position that God has called us to.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; I think that's a great statement.
[48:45] Sometimes we just need the wisdom to
[48:46] thrive in the position that God has
[48:48] called us. And if you can do that, in my
[48:50] opinion, that makes a real son of God.
[48:52] Hallelujah.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; That we can find our place in the word
[48:54] of God. See, we have to be able to trust
[48:56] God. How many believe that?
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; We have to trust God. But we also we
[49:00] trust him with our needs. Brother said
[49:02] we go to God. He said don't be afraid to
[49:04] put his word to a test. If God give us a
[49:07] promise, then we ain't afraid to go to
[49:09] him. He said it's there. He's here. The
[49:11] only thing you need to do is go awake
[49:12] him. You remember the message awakening
[49:14] Jesus but takes the story of the
[49:17] disciples when they were going out in
[49:18] the boat and the sea had came over that
[49:20] great sea and it looked like the boat
[49:22] was going to sink and here Jesus was
[49:24] laying over in the boat and he was
[49:26] taking a rest and and all this great
[49:28] storm come upon him and they had to go
[49:30] down to where he was and they woke him
[49:31] up and said master do you care that we
[49:34] perish in this great storm and Jesus got
[49:36] up remember he spoke to the storm and he
[49:37] said peace be still and all the storm
[49:39] went away and he looked at him said what
[49:41] what what kind of faith have Anyway, but
[49:43] brother Bam took a whole message on this
[49:45] talking about sometimes how that we just
[49:47] have to go wait Jesus. Sometimes you
[49:49] have to uh to go to the Lord and and
[49:51] what happens is is that sometimes we get
[49:54] under the wrong spirit and say whenever
[49:56] trouble comes, trouble makes you weary.
[49:58] It makes you it makes you tired. It
[50:01] causes you to uh to to to just want to
[50:03] throw up your hands sometimes and just
[50:05] walk away and and and and to quit the
[50:07] effort. And it don't make you want to
[50:09] pray. It don't want make you want to uh
[50:10] to go to a prayer closet. that makes you
[50:12] just want to quit and just give up and
[50:13] just go do something that can bring joy
[50:15] to your life. And and so he gets to
[50:17] talking about this of how that what
[50:19] happens is a wrong spirit comes in our
[50:21] life sometimes and it points out that
[50:23] everything that's ever happened that was
[50:24] bad. You know, this person prayed and
[50:26] nothing ever happened and that person
[50:28] prayed and they never got deliverance
[50:29] and this person they served God and they
[50:32] died this way or they or this happened
[50:33] to their life. He said he just always
[50:35] points them to this negative thing. He
[50:37] said, "But why would you want to point
[50:39] to something back there or some some
[50:41] kind of messed up something?" He said,
[50:42] "But I know." He said, "We ought to say
[50:44] I that they would say, I know somebody
[50:47] trusted God and they died and they
[50:49] trusted God." He said, "But I know
[50:50] millions of people that went to the
[50:52] doctor and after they went to the doctor
[50:53] that they died anyhow, but that don't
[50:55] make us stop going to the doctor, but we
[50:57] still go to the doctor because we need
[50:59] help and we need healing and we need the
[51:01] a touch in our body." Although millions
[51:03] there's been malpractice lawsuits all
[51:05] over this country by the billions of
[51:07] dollars of medical malpractice there
[51:09] there's been many people that's died
[51:11] from the hand of a doctor but that don't
[51:13] make us stop going to doctors. We still
[51:15] believe that God has doctors and and he
[51:17] gives them the gift and the the ability
[51:19] to be able to help us. He said so if
[51:21] millions should go to a doctor that
[51:22] don't make us stop trusting doctors. He
[51:24] said it ought to be the same way with
[51:26] God. It ain't no matter what has ever
[51:28] happened to anybody. We ought to still
[51:29] be able to trust God. He said that. And
[51:32] when the doctor has done all that he can
[51:34] do, we ain't got but one hope left and
[51:36] that is only trust in God. So you can't
[51:39] do away with trusting God because that's
[51:41] all we got left when the doctor runs out
[51:43] and the the medicine runs out and there
[51:45] is no hope and and all we got left is to
[51:48] trust God. He said, "See, so we got we
[51:50] can't just say we're going to trust him,
[51:51] but we really have to trust him." How
[51:53] many believe that?
[51:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "And to trust God," he goes,
[51:55] "Sometimes you just have to disturb him.
[51:58] You you you got to disturb him until you
[52:01] can see him come in. That's what these
[52:03] disciples did. He said, "Can't our
[52:05] prayers disturb God? Can't our prayers
[52:07] waken him from his rest and bring him on
[52:09] the scene?" I don't know about you
[52:10] tonight, but sometimes we just got to
[52:12] not be afraid to disturb God. I know
[52:14] God, he's busy. And I know God's got
[52:16] something else going on tonight. And I I
[52:18] know he there's a lot of meetings.
[52:19] There's a lot of church services.
[52:20] There's there's many people around the
[52:22] world that have great needs that are
[52:24] crying out to God. And you know what? I
[52:26] just don't want to bother God. I I don't
[52:27] want to go through all that. But he
[52:29] said, "But if you really want to get
[52:30] something from God, sometimes you just
[52:32] have to not be afraid to disturb him, to
[52:35] wake him up and and pray to God and be
[52:38] persistent about it and say, "God, I
[52:40] need you. And Lord, I know you may be
[52:42] busy and I I know you're a great God and
[52:44] I know you have a lot of things that you
[52:46] have to do, but God, I have a need and I
[52:48] I need my needs met and I God, I may not
[52:50] be worthy, but it's okay to disturb
[52:53] God."
[52:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "You call upon the Lord." He
[52:55] said, they cried out, "We're perish.
[52:57] We're perishing." And he moved in on the
[52:59] scene. He said, "And now we can do the
[53:02] same thing."
[53:04] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[53:05] &gt;&gt; They were perishing. And they said, "Do
[53:07] you not care that we perish?" He moved
[53:09] on the scene. He said, "And you've got a
[53:11] right to do the same thing. It don't
[53:12] matter if your boat's sinking. It don't
[53:14] matter if everything's falling apart
[53:16] around you, but you've got a right to
[53:18] say, Lord, I perish. I need thee in this
[53:20] hour." And he'll come on the scene for
[53:22] you.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, when it comes to a
[53:25] promise of God, we can't be afraid to
[53:26] approach God. Can I tell you what the
[53:28] Bible says? Paul, think about the
[53:30] promises of God. Paul said they're not
[53:32] to Jesus when he came. It wasn't yes and
[53:34] no and maybe might you might get it or
[53:36] you might be good enough. He said, but
[53:38] when it comes to the son of God, Jesus
[53:39] Christ, he was not yay and nay, but in
[53:41] him was yes.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; For all the promises of God in him are
[53:45] yes, and in him, a man unto the glory of
[53:48] God by us. In other words, you know what
[53:50] that means? It means God gave the
[53:52] promise. Jesus confirmed it. You said
[53:54] amen or so be it to the promise of God.
[53:57] And now God gets the glory for all of
[53:59] us.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; You say God gets the glory for his
[54:02] promise. What kind of glory does God get
[54:04] from a promise of God? Can I just tell
[54:06] you tonight? I'll tell you the glory God
[54:07] gets. God gets the glory that he gave a
[54:10] promise to a believer in the midst of
[54:12] Leodysia and you believed it anyway. God
[54:15] gets to glory that in the in the age of
[54:17] spiritual doubt, in the age of of
[54:19] spiritual criticism, in the age when the
[54:22] Bible has been reduced to just a good
[54:24] story book and when the when a church
[54:26] has been reduced to a a social gathering
[54:28] and when the supernatural has been
[54:30] reduced to impersonation, but yet
[54:32] there's still believers that stand upon
[54:34] the word of God and say, "Lord, I
[54:36] believe and I trusted you." Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Said, "You stand on the promises of God.
[54:41] God gets the glory cuz there's believers
[54:43] that are still standing upon the word of
[54:45] God."
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; See, but I think sometimes the greatest
[54:49] struggle is not knowing how to receive
[54:51] the promises of God.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; It becomes a great struggle. You know
[54:56] why? Can I Can I just preach? I'm home
[54:58] anyway. I feel good, brother.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because we put
[55:01] stipulations on the way that we petition
[55:03] God.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Many times when we pray, you think about
[55:06] how you pray. You know, somebody goes to
[55:08] mistreating you, you know, you really
[55:09] want you ever had somebody you just
[55:11] really like to choke them.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; You know, they I mean, I'm just being
[55:14] honest with you, but you just you really
[55:16] want to choke them, but you can't do
[55:17] that because you're a Christian. You
[55:18] know, so you're always I I feel like
[55:21] Paul right now. He said, "There's this
[55:22] war. There's this spirit within me. It's
[55:24] waring my members." You know, sometime
[55:25] part of me wants to choke you, but the
[55:27] other part of me wants to say, "God
[55:28] bless you, brother." And just put a
[55:30] smile on your face. But you know,
[55:31] sometimes people they do things to you
[55:33] or say things about your cause and you
[55:35] know, brother Mark, you really you
[55:36] really want to get after them, but but
[55:38] you can't do it because the Bible says
[55:39] you got to pray for them and you got to
[55:41] love them. And so, you know, there
[55:42] there's this war within my members.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; I don't want to choke you. And so that I
[55:48] I you know, the Bible says pray for
[55:49] them. So then we go we go praying to
[55:51] God. Think about how we pray. So you
[55:53] know you're going to pray for them and
[55:54] God's going to God's going to fix this.
[55:56] So you go to pray. You kneel down trying
[55:58] to muster up the word. Listen, man. I
[56:00] don't know if I can pray for this lady
[56:01] or not, you know. I mean, come on now.
[56:03] You know, so you have to you have to get
[56:04] yourself in the spirit to be able to
[56:06] even pray for him because you're all
[56:07] worked up. I know how it is.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; So, you finally you get to where you can
[56:10] pray for him, Brother Mark. And all all
[56:11] of a sudden, you you you got to pray and
[56:13] you say, "Lord, make this lady be nice
[56:16] so I can stand her."
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on now.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; That ain't that ain't praying for her.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, take this person out of my life.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; That I can go through another day. I
[56:26] mean, you know, that ain't that ain't
[56:27] praying for her.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, can you fix them and help her
[56:30] where she wouldn't have a bad mouth?
[56:31] That way, I can stand be around her. I
[56:32] don't want to slap her every time I see
[56:33] her.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; That ain't praying for her.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; See, see, but that ain't how we that
[56:38] ain't how we that ain't how we pray to
[56:39] God. See, most of the time whenever we
[56:41] pray, a lot of times when we pray, we
[56:43] ask God, Lord, I I need you to do make
[56:45] this happen like this. I need this to be
[56:46] able to to to happen this way and that
[56:48] to be paid like that. I need that done
[56:50] like that. And we give God all these
[56:52] stipulations for our prayer and then
[56:53] wonder why God ain't doing it.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; See, but God don't run errands for us.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; See, so that ain't the way he answers
[57:00] prayer. So, so, so, so many times we ask
[57:03] God for things, say, "Well, God didn't
[57:04] answer my prayer." But can I just tell
[57:05] you something? God can't do things like
[57:07] you asked him to do it many times
[57:09] because God knows that the very thing
[57:11] he's teaching you through that trial,
[57:13] you can't be taught if he pulls the plug
[57:14] on.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; So, God knows he's teaching you
[57:17] something. You know why? We He knows
[57:18] there's things that you must go through
[57:20] in order for God to get you where you
[57:22] need to be. And it's God that's leading
[57:23] us. And and so we have to trust God
[57:25] knowing that God knows all the end from
[57:28] the beginning. He knows all things. He
[57:30] knows what we have need of. He knows
[57:31] your struggles. He knows the trials. He
[57:33] knows the very image that he's molding
[57:35] you into. God knows what it takes in
[57:37] your life to get you to where you need
[57:39] to be.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; And when the time is right, God moves.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; So, you know, sometimes even though we
[57:46] don't think God's answering and God's
[57:48] doing something for us, but the whole
[57:50] time, God really is. He's working
[57:51] behind. That's why I say trust God.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; You have to trust the Lord. But see,
[57:56] sometimes even even when God says yes
[57:58] and he gives us a great promise,
[58:00] sometimes it's so hard to believe. This
[58:02] is what brought me to this thought
[58:03] tonight here. When Zacharias, you
[58:05] remember the story of John the Baptist,
[58:07] Zacharias and and Elizabeth, they had uh
[58:10] his wife was barren. She they were they
[58:12] were they had prayed there all ever
[58:14] since they had been married for a child.
[58:16] She wasn't able to have children. There
[58:18] ain't no telling how many nights that
[58:20] they had spent praying knowing that you,
[58:22] you know, it was such a meaningful thing
[58:24] to have children to carry on their
[58:26] family lineage and it had no ability to
[58:28] have child or have children. And and so
[58:30] they had prayed all these nights. I
[58:32] think of all the nights they laid up and
[58:33] prayed and asked God to do that for them
[58:35] and ask God that he would touch her body
[58:37] and the Lord would give her a child. And
[58:39] I wonder how many times and I really
[58:40] mean this. I wonder how many times that
[58:42] Zacharias, he was a priest in the house
[58:44] of in the temple of God. I wonder how
[58:46] many times Zachcharias quoted to God
[58:48] about Abraham and Sarah here. You know,
[58:50] Lord, you done that for them and Abraham
[58:52] and Sarah and they and they didn't have
[58:54] they they prayed all that time and
[58:56] didn't have a child and you and you you
[58:57] you touched her and you gave them a
[58:59] child, but what about us? I I thought
[59:01] all the times that he had claimed and
[59:02] prayed and asked God to do something
[59:04] supernatural in their life and God never
[59:06] done it.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. Come on.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; And it got to a place and you can tell
[59:10] by reading the story that it got to a
[59:12] place that Zacharias wasn't praying that
[59:14] prayer anymore. Come on.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; It had been a long time since he prayed
[59:17] it. It was something that that he just
[59:19] gave up on. They asked the Lord for it.
[59:21] They they asked God to move. God never
[59:23] done it. It just became an old prayer.
[59:26] And one day, the Bible tells us here,
[59:27] Zacharias was in the temple. He was
[59:29] doing the work of the Lord. And when he
[59:31] was doing the work, an angel appeared
[59:33] unto him. And the angel said, "Fear not,
[59:35] Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard, and
[59:39] thy wife shall bear thee a son." I
[59:40] thought, "Isn't that an odd thing for
[59:42] him to just show up and say, "Thy prayer
[59:44] is heard." And here, you know, Zacharias
[59:46] may have thought, "Well, I've been
[59:47] praying for years. Uh uh but but but now
[59:49] you're past time." And but the Bible
[59:51] says, it tells us he didn't even believe
[59:53] that it could happen. He said, "I'm an
[59:55] old man. My wife is well stricken in
[59:57] years. That was something we prayed
[59:58] about a long time ago. We're we're too
[1:00:00] past that. We're we're far beyond that.
[1:00:02] My but but but the Bible, you know, the
[1:00:04] when God does something, he's doing
[1:00:05] something in his own time." And so so
[1:00:08] here you've been praying all this time.
[1:00:09] I'm an old man. I'm well stricken. And
[1:00:11] he said, but Zachcharias, he was a good
[1:00:13] man, a holy man, a righteous man. He had
[1:00:15] prayed for these things, but he failed
[1:00:17] to believe what he had been praying for
[1:00:19] when his prayer was answered.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; So, see, in brother said, isn't that
[1:00:22] like most of us today? He said, you pray
[1:00:25] and when God comes to answer your
[1:00:27] prayer, it would about scare you to
[1:00:28] death that God came and answered it.
[1:00:30] That's about how the way that people
[1:00:32] pray to God. It would about it would
[1:00:33] about startle them that God done
[1:00:35] something supernatural in their life.
[1:00:36] But, but but this is what happened to
[1:00:38] Zachcharias. She had prayed so long. God
[1:00:40] never done it. And when God finally
[1:00:42] came, he said, "Your prayer has been
[1:00:44] heard." I thought, "My hero, it may have
[1:00:45] been 20 years ago that he prayed that
[1:00:47] prayer." But God's always on time. He
[1:00:49] said, "Thy prayer has been heard.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Come on."
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; But he said he couldn't believe it.
[1:00:53] You've been, you know, just like us.
[1:00:55] Many times you pray for healing and it
[1:00:57] comes and we doubt that God heal us and
[1:00:59] we pray for revival. And you know, Lord,
[1:01:01] I want to see a revival. I want to see a
[1:01:02] move of God amongst my children. And we
[1:01:04] I I know every one of these parents has
[1:01:06] prayed it. You want to see a great
[1:01:07] revival in the house of God, but then
[1:01:09] you come to church and the spirit of God
[1:01:11] starts moving a little bit. You say,
[1:01:12] "Not today, Lord. I got to work tomorrow
[1:01:14] and I can't be here all night. It ain't
[1:01:16] a good day for a prayer meeting and we
[1:01:17] just had a meeting and all all these
[1:01:19] things. We pray for things, but then
[1:01:21] when God comes to answer the prayer, I
[1:01:23] wonder how we respond to God's
[1:01:24] response."
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Says, "See, see, we're we're waiting on
[1:01:28] the Lord." He said, "Notice what the
[1:01:29] angel said. The angel, he said unto him,
[1:01:31] I am Gabriel that stood in the presence
[1:01:34] of God."
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and I have been sent to you
[1:01:37] to show you these glad tidings. It I I
[1:01:41] mean I don't know if Gabriel could be
[1:01:42] offended, but if he could, I would think
[1:01:44] he got offended.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; I You mean you've been praying for this
[1:01:48] for so long and then I come and get tell
[1:01:51] you your prayer is answered. Your
[1:01:52] petition has been heard by God and God
[1:01:54] has given you the answer to your prayer
[1:01:56] and now you won't believe it. He said,
[1:01:58] "Do you realize who I am? I come from
[1:02:00] the presence of God and I came here to
[1:02:02] give you glad tidings. I I didn't come
[1:02:04] to to destroy you. I didn't come to to
[1:02:07] bring destruction. I I came to give you
[1:02:09] good news. You I didn't come to bind
[1:02:11] you. I I didn't come to to bring
[1:02:13] problems. I didn't come to to control
[1:02:15] you, but I came to preach glad tidings
[1:02:17] to you. I came to give you something
[1:02:19] that would help you. I'm trying to help
[1:02:20] you. You've been praying to God. You're
[1:02:22] reaching out to God. You're asking for
[1:02:24] an answer, and God sent me to tell you,
[1:02:26] "Thy prayer has been heard."
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; How would you respond?
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Listen what he done. The Bible says he
[1:02:33] spoke to Zachcharias, "Thou shalt be
[1:02:35] dumb." In other words, you'll not be
[1:02:37] able to speak.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; "Until the day that these things be
[1:02:40] performed, because you believe not my
[1:02:42] words which should be fulfilled in their
[1:02:44] season."
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; See, even though God heard the prayer,
[1:02:48] he made a promise to answer the prayer.
[1:02:50] I think of this here now when whenever
[1:02:52] Zachariah's answer came, look at what
[1:02:55] happened in his life. The very the very
[1:02:57] joy of it had been removed. the here his
[1:03:00] wife now that she would conceive and she
[1:03:02] would they they would go through the the
[1:03:04] months of her pregnancy. I you know I
[1:03:05] wonder if during her pregnancy and these
[1:03:08] uh the the these months that went on
[1:03:10] that that here Zachcharias he couldn't
[1:03:11] talk to her. He he didn't know sign
[1:03:13] language. This came to him all of a
[1:03:14] sudden he had no way to communicate with
[1:03:16] his wife maybe try to write something
[1:03:18] down. But here whenever, you know, when
[1:03:20] they finally get to this place when
[1:03:21] they're going to have a baby, that's a
[1:03:23] time where they want to h have joy and
[1:03:25] talk about the baby names and talk about
[1:03:27] what how they're going to build a crib
[1:03:29] and how it's going to be in the house
[1:03:30] and oh, what joy it's going to be and
[1:03:32] man, well, can't you take him down to
[1:03:34] the temple and and and raise him up in
[1:03:36] the right way and all the things that he
[1:03:37] would like to talk about of his son that
[1:03:40] was going to be born, he couldn't even
[1:03:41] enjoy it with his wife. He couldn't
[1:03:43] communicate about it. He had to sit
[1:03:45] there in silence for all this time. And
[1:03:47] then hardship struck her pregnancy. The
[1:03:49] Bible remember remember her baby wasn't
[1:03:51] moving in her womb for five months. She
[1:03:53] stayed in her own home. And here here he
[1:03:55] was the priest. He he could have offered
[1:03:57] help. He could have been a help to her.
[1:03:58] He could have prayed. Now he couldn't
[1:04:00] even pray to God. He couldn't the very
[1:04:02] words that remember when he prayed out
[1:04:03] to God. Now he couldn't even speak those
[1:04:05] words.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Preach, brother. Come on.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Even though the prayer was answered, but
[1:04:09] the joy of it was gone because of the
[1:04:11] way he responded to God answering the
[1:04:13] prayer.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Here was God was answering it all along.
[1:04:16] I thought, my what a what a thing it was
[1:04:18] to wonder if if Zacharias even didn't
[1:04:21] think that maybe it's my fault finally
[1:04:23] finally that you know she's finally
[1:04:25] conceived and and you know I didn't
[1:04:27] believe God and now my wife's suffering
[1:04:28] and the baby's not moving. I wonder if
[1:04:30] he didn't sit there and wonder if God
[1:04:32] would just punish him because of his
[1:04:33] unbelief. This is a real man just like
[1:04:35] you and I.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Wonder if he didn't wonder
[1:04:38] these things about how, you know, the
[1:04:40] many months of suffering and the
[1:04:41] questions that must have went on his
[1:04:43] mind because of how he responded
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; to God's answer.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Many months he suffered in this because
[1:04:49] of his response to thy prayer is heard.
[1:04:52] I thought, my you know what, friends,
[1:04:53] our response matters.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; You know, there was another there was
[1:04:56] another man in the Bible that heard that
[1:04:58] same word. Remember Cornelius? Remember
[1:05:00] when the angel of the Lord, he was
[1:05:01] praying and asking God to help him here?
[1:05:03] I'm I'm just going to preach it anyway.
[1:05:04] Lord, put it on my heart. But but when
[1:05:06] he was praying and and and the angel
[1:05:08] came right there in his room, he said,
[1:05:09] "Thy prayer is heard." Isn't that what
[1:05:11] he told Cornelius, "Thy prayer is
[1:05:12] heard." Cornelius was a gentile. He
[1:05:14] said, "And then the L he said,"Lord, I I
[1:05:16] I receive it. What would you have me to
[1:05:18] do? I need a move of God in my life."
[1:05:20] The Bible says he was a just man, a
[1:05:22] righteous man. He was a good man, but he
[1:05:24] was a gentile.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; And here he said, "God, what can I do?"
[1:05:27] And the Lord told him, he said, "You
[1:05:28] send somebody over to the land of Japa,
[1:05:31] to the house of Simon the Tanner.
[1:05:32] There's a man there by the name of Simon
[1:05:34] Peter." and you bring him into your
[1:05:36] house. I thought, isn't it something? He
[1:05:37] was praying for something and and and
[1:05:40] God was going to answer his prayer. And
[1:05:42] so when he when he would he would send
[1:05:44] him over to the house and they went in
[1:05:46] there and sure enough there was Peter up
[1:05:47] on the roof of Simon the Tanner's house
[1:05:49] and Peter was praying to God and he was
[1:05:52] getting ready and they were about to
[1:05:53] come down and he remember he had he went
[1:05:55] he took a rest and as he was rested the
[1:05:57] Lord showed him a vision of a of a of a
[1:05:59] a napkin that had came down and there
[1:06:01] was these different beasts on it that
[1:06:03] were unclean and and and the Lord said
[1:06:05] arise and or the voice arise and kill
[1:06:07] and eat. Peter said I can't eat those
[1:06:09] things are unclean. I've never put
[1:06:10] anything in my body that was unclean.
[1:06:12] And God corrected him. He said, "Don't
[1:06:14] you call anything unclean that I've
[1:06:16] called clean. If I've cleansed it, it's
[1:06:18] not unclean. So, it's not for you to
[1:06:20] touch. It's not for you to judge. It's
[1:06:21] not for you to cast your opinion on it.
[1:06:23] If I've cleansed it, it's not an unclean
[1:06:25] thing." And then Peter stood up and as
[1:06:28] he there was a knock on the door. And as
[1:06:30] he went down, the angel of the Lord
[1:06:31] began to speak to him. He said, "When
[1:06:33] you get down there, there are men that
[1:06:35] are inviting you to a house of
[1:06:36] Cornelius. I have sent them to you and
[1:06:39] you go there and they're not unclean.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; And when Peter opened the door, lo and
[1:06:44] behold, there stood some Gentiles. Am I
[1:06:46] what a revel? I just feel like
[1:06:47] preaching. But what revelation that he
[1:06:49] had? They weren't Jewish people. They
[1:06:50] weren't raised in the right bloodline.
[1:06:52] They they weren't raised through the
[1:06:54] seed of Abraham. They were old gentile
[1:06:56] dogs. It wasn't worth nothing in all of
[1:06:58] Israel. But when Peter looked at them,
[1:07:00] he said, "I don't know. I don't know a
[1:07:01] lot, but I know one thing. I will not
[1:07:03] call unclean what God has cleansed."
[1:07:06] And the Bible said he went to the house
[1:07:08] of Cornelius with them. You know what
[1:07:10] Cornelius done? He invited all of his
[1:07:12] friends. He invited all of his family.
[1:07:14] He said, "I don't know what's about to
[1:07:15] happen, but I know that God said my
[1:07:17] prayer was answered. I was praying for a
[1:07:19] move of God. I was praying for God to
[1:07:21] lead me. I wanted to be closer to God.
[1:07:23] He told me to call Peter and invite him
[1:07:25] to my house to be able to speak
[1:07:26] something. I don't even know who Peter
[1:07:28] is."
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; He invited his friends and family and
[1:07:31] they all came in and they went into the
[1:07:32] house and they gathered together. I
[1:07:34] thought, isn't it something that here
[1:07:36] whenever he had prayed for an answer all
[1:07:38] this time, look how God answered it. God
[1:07:40] sent him to get a gospel preacher to
[1:07:43] come in and set up a meeting in his
[1:07:45] house with all of his friends and
[1:07:46] family. He invited a gospel preacher
[1:07:48] down there to stand before the
[1:07:50] congregation of people and to tell them
[1:07:52] what God's answer was to Cornelius's
[1:07:54] prayer. I thought, could not God have
[1:07:57] just told him when the angel stood in
[1:07:58] his room, couldn't he have just said
[1:08:00] there when he raised up in his room and
[1:08:02] said, "There's a Holy Ghost." It was in
[1:08:04] the man Jesus Christ. He's been
[1:08:06] crucified and ascended and he sent it
[1:08:08] back to the church and it's yours if
[1:08:09] you'll receive it. Could God not have
[1:08:11] done it just that way?
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; But instead, he said, "You go down and
[1:08:15] get Peter, get a gospel preacher and
[1:08:17] bring him to your house and he'll tell
[1:08:18] you what I need to tell you." So he
[1:08:20] brought a preacher in the house and he
[1:08:22] stood in the presence of those people.
[1:08:24] He said, "I don't know very many things,
[1:08:26] but I know this one thing that my God is
[1:08:28] no respector of persons." And when you
[1:08:30] call upon God and have a need from God
[1:08:33] and you sincerely approach him, he's a
[1:08:35] God that is just to answer you. And
[1:08:37] there's a man named Jesus and he he's
[1:08:40] he's an intercessor. He's a high priest
[1:08:42] of your confession. And if you have any
[1:08:44] need to die, you call upon him, he'll
[1:08:46] answer your prayer.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible said why Peter began to preach
[1:08:50] to them that they received the Holy
[1:08:52] Ghost before they were ever even
[1:08:54] baptized.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost fell on them. Say what
[1:08:57] was happening? It was a gospel preacher
[1:08:59] surrendered to God. It was a people that
[1:09:02] believed the word of God that that that
[1:09:04] prayed and obeyed the word of the Lord.
[1:09:06] They prayed so long. He said, "You go
[1:09:08] get a preacher and listen to what he has
[1:09:10] to say and that will be the answer to
[1:09:12] your prayer."
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Isn't it something how God does things?
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; We're looking for some great sign in the
[1:09:18] sky or some somebody or God to come and
[1:09:20] give us some great speech or an angel to
[1:09:22] rise up in the floor. But really what
[1:09:24] what what what his whole family got
[1:09:26] Cornelius's family and all their
[1:09:27] friends, they got an oldfashioned gospel
[1:09:29] preacher by the name of Peter
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; that came in and preached to them about
[1:09:33] Jesus Christ.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; How he could answer their prayer and
[1:09:36] help them heal them. He was a healer of
[1:09:38] all their diseases.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; I'd have loved to been in that service.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; I'd been the loudest one in there. Y'all
[1:09:44] know that.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Am I to think how God does it? He said,
[1:09:48] "I only have one message." said, "God is
[1:09:50] no respector, but in every nation he
[1:09:52] that fearth him and workketh
[1:09:54] righteousness is accepted with him."
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Said, "See, while he was preached, they
[1:09:59] were filled." Brother said, "Isn't it
[1:10:00] something?" They only had one vision and
[1:10:03] a gospel preacher.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; They had one vision and a bunch of
[1:10:08] people who were Gentiles that saw one
[1:10:10] vision manifested and heard the word of
[1:10:11] the truth.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; How they received life and the Holy
[1:10:14] Ghost fell on all of them before they
[1:10:16] was ever baptized. Right?
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; One vision in a little gospel preaching.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "How what ought we do this
[1:10:22] morning?"
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; In the tabernacle, sick and afflicted,
[1:10:25] the blind, the deaf, the dumb, the
[1:10:26] sinner, everything. Just think out of
[1:10:28] tens of thousands of things that God has
[1:10:30] done, not one time has it ever failed.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; It ought to set our hearts a flame.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; If that group of Gentiles could be
[1:10:36] filled with the Holy Ghost under one
[1:10:38] vision and a gospel preacher, then what
[1:10:40] do you think we can do tonight? Said,
[1:10:41] "Why spake these words? The Holy Ghost
[1:10:43] fell on I thought if one done that,
[1:10:45] we've had the privilege of sitting under
[1:10:46] a prophetic ministry with thousands of
[1:10:48] visions that took place just as God said
[1:10:50] they would.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; What faith we ought to have tonight.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Just takes a v if it took one vision and
[1:10:56] a gospel preacher. You know, we've had
[1:10:58] thousands of visions.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; But God, think about God. He's not a
[1:11:02] wishy-washy God. You know what he done,
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Even though Zacharias was struggling,
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; but God still kept his word. He told him
[1:11:08] he's going to have a son.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; He still he still kept it. He paid for
[1:11:11] it.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But God still kept his
[1:11:13] promise.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; So I think it matters our response
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; to God's response.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Wayne was preaching
[1:11:21] over in the Tennessee. We I'd done the
[1:11:25] Friday night. He done the the Saturday
[1:11:26] night, the evening services and and
[1:11:28] Sunday. And then he he was preaching on
[1:11:30] on on the attitude and how that we want
[1:11:32] the will of God in our life, but we
[1:11:34] don't want God to lead us.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Is it something that but then when when
[1:11:38] God comes in, we want we say we want God
[1:11:40] to lead us. We want the will of A might
[1:11:41] run out of time. We want the will of
[1:11:42] God. But then when God comes in to lead
[1:11:44] you, we get all worked up. I'm not so
[1:11:47] sure how how we can handle that.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; It's what took the children of Israel.
[1:11:51] How that they seen the supernatural
[1:11:53] happen every day. They lived under a
[1:11:55] great supernatural pillar of fire that
[1:11:57] was leading them through the wilderness.
[1:11:59] They revival after revival, signs and
[1:12:02] wonders and miracles that took place.
[1:12:03] But notice the attitude of Israel. They
[1:12:05] were always murmuring.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Every time they'd have a revival, they'd
[1:12:08] leave out of it murmuring and
[1:12:09] complaining about something God wasn't
[1:12:11] doing. Every time God would give them
[1:12:12] bread, they'd murmur that it wasn't the
[1:12:14] right kind or murmur that it happened
[1:12:16] with the wrong person or murmur the
[1:12:17] right guy wasn't just constant murmuring
[1:12:20] about everything. So they had the
[1:12:21] supernatural all the time, but that
[1:12:23] still yet they murmured about
[1:12:24] everything. And because of that, they
[1:12:25] wandered around in the wilderness year
[1:12:27] after year after year after year because
[1:12:30] they couldn't get past their own
[1:12:31] murmurings.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; So, but then look at Paul and Silas when
[1:12:34] they went into a prison cell here. Paul,
[1:12:36] they were down in a prison that was dark
[1:12:38] and cold. There wasn't no supernatural
[1:12:40] in the prison. There wasn't no There was
[1:12:42] no miracles. There wasn't no bread being
[1:12:44] rained out of heaven. There was no water
[1:12:45] for them. It was a dry old nasty
[1:12:48] basement prison cell in the middle of in
[1:12:50] the middle of a of a city. And and but
[1:12:53] Paul when they stood in there, you know
[1:12:55] what they done? They began to praise and
[1:12:57] and give glory unto God. I thought,
[1:12:59] isn't it something that the Israel their
[1:13:01] attitude was to murmur and complain? And
[1:13:03] they were living in the supernatural and
[1:13:05] they always complained. But Paul stood
[1:13:07] right there in a prison cell and he
[1:13:09] lifted his hand and said, "Praise be to
[1:13:11] God. Isn't our God a great God?" He
[1:13:13] said, "See, that was Paul's attitude."
[1:13:15] Had a different attitude. He said, "I
[1:13:17] glory in my infirmities. I count an
[1:13:19] honor to win a victory over the devil."
[1:13:22] But see, when you praise God and your
[1:13:24] car still broke, when you can praise God
[1:13:26] and the circumstances are still the
[1:13:27] same, when you can praise God and your
[1:13:29] bills still ain't paid, when you can
[1:13:31] praise God and you still have the same
[1:13:33] symptoms in your body. That's the kind
[1:13:35] of That's the kind of man that Paul was.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; He said he praised God. You know why he
[1:13:40] said he wanted to win a victory? I glory
[1:13:42] in my infirmities. I I want to win a
[1:13:44] victory over the devil. You say, "Well,
[1:13:45] where was Paul's victory over the
[1:13:46] devil?" Let me tell you where it was. It
[1:13:48] was that he could praise God no matter
[1:13:50] what was going on around him.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; That's a real believer today that you
[1:13:54] can praise God no matter what's going
[1:13:56] on. That that that you can have a
[1:13:57] victory. You know why? Cuz Satan wants
[1:13:59] to rob you of that very thing. Amen.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; He wants to rob you of your victory
[1:14:02] where you can't get up in the morning
[1:14:03] and say, "Lord, I thank you for this
[1:14:05] day. You give us this day our daily
[1:14:07] bread." You're such a wonderful God. I
[1:14:09] praise you this morning. Lord, you've
[1:14:11] never failed me. You may have everything
[1:14:13] in your life may have fell apart
[1:14:14] yesterday, but something in the heart of
[1:14:16] a believer can say, "God, you've never
[1:14:18] failed me one time. You've led me to
[1:14:21] this place. You brought me through
[1:14:22] trials. You put this on my life. You
[1:14:25] brought afflictions upon me, and you've
[1:14:27] never failed me one time."
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's a victory over the
[1:14:30] devil. The bride of Christ is a
[1:14:32] victorious people.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; And our victory isn't in our
[1:14:36] circumstances. Our victory is in our
[1:14:38] promise.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; We're victorious.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Matt, I tell you what,
[1:14:44] I'm trying I'm just trying to live a
[1:14:45] peaceful life." No, sir.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not trying to have all this
[1:14:48] trouble and problems.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; I don't I'm not trying to have all these
[1:14:51] trials. I'm just trying to live a
[1:14:53] peaceful life. And because of that in
[1:14:56] our mind that whenever we whenever it's
[1:14:58] not peaceful then people get upset at
[1:14:59] God.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Then they don't come to church. I they
[1:15:03] start laying out of church.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; They stop praying. They stop reading
[1:15:06] their Bible because they get upset with
[1:15:08] God.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Because because I don't have this peace
[1:15:11] I've been promised and you know all
[1:15:13] these things. But the reality is it's
[1:15:14] just because people misunderstand what
[1:15:16] the promise of God is.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; You know I know how it is. You know,
[1:15:19] brother Matt, the Bible said that the
[1:15:21] thoughts of God are of us are of peace
[1:15:23] and not of evil. That's right. It does
[1:15:24] say that. But that ain't the end of the
[1:15:26] scripture.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; What Jeremiah said, he said, "I know the
[1:15:28] thoughts I think toward you, they are
[1:15:30] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:15:32] bring you to an expected end."
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; So, whenever he talks about these
[1:15:36] thoughts of peace, you realize he was
[1:15:38] actually speaking of your eternal
[1:15:39] destination.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; God was talking about bringing you to a
[1:15:42] place of peace and a place of rest. See,
[1:15:44] how can a man ever have peace in this
[1:15:46] life? Can I just be honest with you? How
[1:15:48] can you have perfect peace in this life?
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; I know y'all you may think I think I'm
[1:15:52] crazy, but I can tell you what Brother
[1:15:53] Beam said. He said, "You can't say that
[1:15:54] tonight. I feel perfectly well." He
[1:15:56] said, "You can't even say that because
[1:15:58] you can't feel perfectly well."
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; How do you know that your mother's not
[1:16:01] dying right now? How do you know that
[1:16:02] that your dad didn't kill just a few
[1:16:04] minutes ago? He goes through things,
[1:16:05] things that's happened. How do you know
[1:16:07] that there aren't bad things happening
[1:16:08] at your home? How do you know your house
[1:16:09] ain't on fire? How do you know your car
[1:16:10] is going to start when you get in it?
[1:16:12] How you know your tire is not going to
[1:16:13] get flat when you go out in the parking
[1:16:14] lot? You can't have a perfect peace in
[1:16:16] this life. Every time your loved ones
[1:16:18] leave, you think about it. I wonder if
[1:16:19] they're going to come back. I wonder if
[1:16:21] something's going to happen. I wonder
[1:16:22] because we've seen so much bad. We can't
[1:16:24] have a perfect peace in this life. You
[1:16:25] say, well, I I I need that kind of
[1:16:27] peace. He said, but see, in this life,
[1:16:29] it's going to always be an unsettled
[1:16:32] peace. You don't have no peace. He said,
[1:16:34] because it wasn't meant for you to have
[1:16:35] peace here. If you had peace here, you
[1:16:38] would grow accustomed to this world. And
[1:16:39] God don't want you to grow accustomed to
[1:16:41] this world.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; He wants you to rest in him. So come to
[1:16:44] him and then you have peace. He says,
[1:16:47] "So I don't care what it takes. If you
[1:16:48] say the Russians are fixing to pull the
[1:16:50] trigger at this minute, they're sending
[1:16:51] an atomic bomb." But a real born again
[1:16:53] Christian has an eternal peace in his
[1:16:56] heart because he knows who he belongs
[1:16:58] to. He knows his God. He said there
[1:17:00] ain't nothing can harm him. Let the
[1:17:01] bullet fly when before the smoke would
[1:17:03] ever hit the ground or scatter out
[1:17:05] across the street until we'd be in the
[1:17:06] glory with Jesus standing there immortal
[1:17:09] in his likeness. never to be sick and
[1:17:11] never to have a heartache, never to have
[1:17:13] a disappointment. That is our peace.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Our peace is that when we go through
[1:17:17] trials,
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Bible says we're many of our are our
[1:17:20] afflictions, many trials, many
[1:17:22] temptations, many uh things that we go
[1:17:24] through, but our peace is knowing that
[1:17:25] God has the end of end result in
[1:17:28] control.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; That's our peace that we have.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; We have peace believing and trusting in
[1:17:34] God. You know, I think the hardest thing
[1:17:38] for people to do I don't have a clock.
[1:17:40] Somebody
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; The hardest thing for people to do is to
[1:17:44] believe that the word will be fulfilled.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't it easier to believe God did
[1:17:49] something when somebody tells you about
[1:17:50] it
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; or God is going to do something
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; than to believe God's doing something
[1:17:54] right now?
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Isn't it always that way?
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; It's always It's a lot easier to be
[1:17:59] something in the future, but it's hard
[1:18:00] to believe God in the season that you're
[1:18:02] living in. You realize that? But when a
[1:18:04] word is spoke, a promise of God is
[1:18:06] spoke, it has a future. It has a past.
[1:18:08] It has a present.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; The very minute it is spoke, the very
[1:18:12] next second, it now has a past.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; It has a future, but then it has a
[1:18:15] present. The present, which being there,
[1:18:17] there there's going to be same thing
[1:18:18] with a natural seed. When you put a seed
[1:18:20] in the ground, that seed starts dying.
[1:18:22] It has a past. It used to be a seed. It
[1:18:24] used to be in a in a plant somewhere or
[1:18:26] a little package somewhere. Now it's in
[1:18:28] the ground. It it's never going to be
[1:18:29] that again. It can't go back to it. It's
[1:18:31] going to it's going to deteriorate in
[1:18:33] the ground and rot. It can't go back to
[1:18:34] its old form. It has a future, but then
[1:18:36] it has a present.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; See, so we're always looking for the
[1:18:40] right season, but but whenever you look
[1:18:41] at the life of a promise, you realize
[1:18:43] the greatest part of that promise is the
[1:18:45] season of fulfillment.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; It's whenever it's taking place. That's
[1:18:48] the best part about a promise is when
[1:18:50] you're getting it. I I could promise you
[1:18:51] a million dollars and that that'd be a
[1:18:53] wonderful promise to hold on to. But but
[1:18:55] whenever you got the million dollars,
[1:18:56] wouldn't it be a great That's the best
[1:18:57] time is when you actually got it. Isn't
[1:18:59] that right? whenever you can hold it in
[1:19:00] your hand, say, "Man, this is good
[1:19:01] stuff." But you're holding on to the So,
[1:19:04] the season of fulfillment is the most
[1:19:06] rewarding time. But what happens is is a
[1:19:08] lot of times, the longer you wait on
[1:19:10] something, you lose hope.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Isn't that true? Am I tell am I speaking
[1:19:14] truth?
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; The longer you wait on something,
[1:19:16] because of our natural life, you lose
[1:19:18] hope. This is what happened to
[1:19:19] Zacharias. He had lost so much faith
[1:19:20] that when his prayer was answered, he
[1:19:22] didn't even believe that God was
[1:19:23] answering his prayer.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; But everything happens in that season.
[1:19:26] Well, he didn't know. He had prayed all
[1:19:28] this time. But remember said God was
[1:19:29] answering his prayer. He said, "I'll say
[1:19:31] this. God will answer every sincere
[1:19:33] prayer in his own way."
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; God never leaves a prayer unanswered. He
[1:19:36] don't he don't not answer our prayer.
[1:19:39] So, so when you ask God just for
[1:19:42] something, then you just prepare for the
[1:19:45] season of fulfillment.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; We should prepare in our heart that this
[1:19:48] this uh season that will come that we'll
[1:19:51] receive our reward. when you pray for
[1:19:53] something, maybe you're praying for a
[1:19:55] change or praying for direction or
[1:19:56] praying for somebody, praying for your
[1:19:58] children, but there there's a season
[1:20:00] that it comes to pass there. We have
[1:20:02] seasons of this life, you realize
[1:20:03] there's a there's a season of suffering,
[1:20:05] there's a season of glory, there's a
[1:20:06] season of promise, there's a season of
[1:20:08] fulfillment. Change comes in a certain
[1:20:10] season. So, whenever you when you look
[1:20:11] in the Bible, the many times you can
[1:20:13] find places in the Bible where God made
[1:20:15] a promise that it didn't happen for
[1:20:16] several hundred years. When he promised
[1:20:17] Abraham, thy seed will will be a
[1:20:19] stranger. Remember, they're they're
[1:20:20] going to be brought out with great
[1:20:21] substance. 400 years they lived in
[1:20:23] bondage before that season of
[1:20:25] deliverance came. Same thing happened
[1:20:27] with Isaiah. He said, "Behold, a virgin
[1:20:29] shall conceive." It was 700 years before
[1:20:31] a virgin ever conceived. But the promise
[1:20:33] was still just as good. See, but but in
[1:20:36] its season, it came to pass. So, here's
[1:20:38] what happened in Zachcharias. It p it
[1:20:40] came around to the season. God had a
[1:20:42] purpose in his life. It came to the
[1:20:44] season that that John the Baptist would
[1:20:46] come and forun the forerrun the first
[1:20:48] coming of Christ. she would fulfill
[1:20:50] Malachi the third chapter. And here when
[1:20:52] they were praying for a baby, brother
[1:20:53] brother Brian, little did they know that
[1:20:55] their baby was going to fulfill
[1:20:56] prophecy. There's no way they they
[1:20:58] thought that that was something that
[1:20:59] Malachi had said 400 years, 500 years
[1:21:01] ago. They they never attributed it to
[1:21:04] that. They were just asking God for a
[1:21:06] child. But but but but God had to bring
[1:21:08] it in a certain season. See, because it
[1:21:10] took the spirit of Elijah to introduce
[1:21:12] Christ. John the Baptist would had the
[1:21:14] spirit of Elijah. and and in order for
[1:21:17] him to introduce Christ, then the spirit
[1:21:19] of Elijah had to be on earth at the same
[1:21:21] time Christ was on the earth.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; So, he couldn't had this child 40 years
[1:21:25] ago or 30 or 50 years ago. It had to
[1:21:27] happen in the season that God had
[1:21:30] purposed it in the beginning.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; I thought that's about the way it is
[1:21:33] sometimes with us. You realize that
[1:21:35] there's seasons in your life. There's
[1:21:36] seasons that we that places that we come
[1:21:38] from. Can I just tell you what Paul
[1:21:40] said? I'm I'm going to hurry to get to
[1:21:41] the end. But Paul said, "There was a
[1:21:43] time he hath quickened us when we were
[1:21:45] dead in trespasses and sins." In other
[1:21:47] words, there was a time that you were
[1:21:49] dead. Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; But God quickened you to life.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; There was a time in times past. It was a
[1:21:54] season of your life. I'm talking about
[1:21:56] an old season. There's a time past you
[1:21:58] walked according to the course of this
[1:21:59] world. There was an old season that you
[1:22:01] walked according to a spirit that
[1:22:03] worships the children of disobedience.
[1:22:04] There was a time when you had
[1:22:06] conversation in the lust of your flesh.
[1:22:08] There was a time that only thing that
[1:22:09] was on your mind was fulfilling the
[1:22:11] desires of the flesh and the mind. There
[1:22:13] was a time that you had the nature of
[1:22:15] the children of wrath even as others.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; But then there came a time Paul said
[1:22:19] that that season ended.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; He said for God who is rich in mercy.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; For his great love wherewith he has
[1:22:26] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[1:22:29] hath quickened us together with Christ.
[1:22:31] That makes me want to shout all over
[1:22:33] this building.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Think about even when we were dead in
[1:22:36] sins. That means while you were living
[1:22:38] in that season, he said, "But God
[1:22:40] quickened us together with Christ." It
[1:22:43] was before he ever seemed like he ever
[1:22:45] answered your prayer, before you were
[1:22:46] ever filled with the Holy Ghost. Before
[1:22:48] you ever gave your heart to God, while
[1:22:50] you were in that other season, he said,
[1:22:52] "But then God, who is rich in mercy,
[1:22:54] while we were dead in sin, he has
[1:22:56] quickened us together with Jesus
[1:22:58] Christ."
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; In your season of sin, in your season of
[1:23:02] unbelief, sir, that's when God quickened
[1:23:04] a seat.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. The whole time you thought God
[1:23:06] wasn't answering your prayer. The whole
[1:23:07] time you was going back and forth to an
[1:23:09] altar, running from God, saying, "I
[1:23:11] can't make it right. I can't serve God.
[1:23:13] I'll just give up." Year after year, you
[1:23:15] gave up so many times. And the whole
[1:23:16] time in that season, God had already
[1:23:19] answered the prayer.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; All them times you said, "I wonder why
[1:23:22] God didn't do it then. I wonder why God
[1:23:25] didn't fill me with the Holy Ghost sin.
[1:23:26] I wonder why God didn't help me then."
[1:23:28] The whole time, God had answered the
[1:23:29] prayer.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. said in the season he said of he
[1:23:33] has raised us together made us to sit in
[1:23:35] heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[1:23:38] the ages to come that we might show the
[1:23:40] that he might show the exceeding and
[1:23:42] riches of his grace and his kindness
[1:23:45] toward us through Christ Jesus.
[1:23:48] See it's a season of our life. We sent a
[1:23:51] we spent a season serving the devil
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; but then in the right season we begin to
[1:23:57] manifest another life.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. We had a season of doubt. Now
[1:24:00] we're in a season of fail.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; We had a season of drought and a season
[1:24:04] of famine.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; You realize that now you're not in that.
[1:24:07] You're in a season of prosperity.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; People are afraid to say that because
[1:24:10] men have abused the word, but that's not
[1:24:12] a bad word.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; We we are in a season of prosperity. We
[1:24:15] have a we have a God that that is
[1:24:18] prospering in our lives. That means the
[1:24:19] word of God that has been swn into your
[1:24:21] life. It's prospering. It's growing.
[1:24:23] It's manifesting. It's producing. We're
[1:24:25] we're in a season of of prosperity. It's
[1:24:27] the season of the prosperity of the
[1:24:29] word. And you realize that in each one
[1:24:31] of us, that word is prospering and it's
[1:24:33] bringing forth faith.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; So, can I say this to you tonight?
[1:24:36] You're not in your season of doubt.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to get real with you.
[1:24:40] You're not in your season of doubt. That
[1:24:41] was that was yesterday year's.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; You're not in your season of unbelief.
[1:24:45] That was a long time ago when you when
[1:24:46] you was an unbeliever. When you when you
[1:24:48] doubt you're you're not in that season
[1:24:50] anymore, but now you're in a season of
[1:24:52] faith.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; See, and it changes how you receive
[1:24:54] something when you realize what season
[1:24:56] that you're in. That's right.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; You're in a season of faith. You're in a
[1:24:59] season of prosperity. You're in a season
[1:25:01] of belief. You're you're in a season of
[1:25:03] believing the the word of God. A season
[1:25:05] of the seed coming forth. You You
[1:25:07] realize that we're not in a We're not in
[1:25:08] a drought no more, brother Mark. We
[1:25:10] We're not in a famine, but we're in a
[1:25:12] season of harvest.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; You know, there was a great famine. I'm
[1:25:16] going to say this in closing. There was
[1:25:18] a great famine in Israel one day if
[1:25:21] sister would come.
[1:25:23] And the, you know, the Bible tells us
[1:25:24] the story of how how that that Elijah
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; had had had brought the or had spoke the
[1:25:32] word of the Lord. The famine that came
[1:25:33] upon Israel. Three years they had been
[1:25:34] in this famine.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; And here that that all this that had
[1:25:38] taken place and they in this great
[1:25:40] drought and all all thing had fell
[1:25:42] apart. And finally at the end of this
[1:25:45] drought, God comes to Elijah and tells
[1:25:47] Elijah that that season's over. I'm
[1:25:50] going to bring rain back to Israel.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; So Elijah, he goes, you remember the
[1:25:55] story, but he goes and he tells that God
[1:25:57] tells him that rain is going to come. He
[1:25:58] went and so Elijah went and he started
[1:26:00] setting things in order to make
[1:26:02] preparation for the rain.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; He went to the men and he said,
[1:26:05] "Somebody go call upon Ahab to tell Ahab
[1:26:08] that that Elijah's here."
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; You remember the man they I I'll just
[1:26:11] tell it like the Bible tells him, but
[1:26:12] remember the man that came to came to
[1:26:14] Elijah? They sent down from Ahab and he
[1:26:16] was a man of God. Bible said he was a
[1:26:18] righteous man. He was the man that
[1:26:20] actually had hid the prophets in the
[1:26:22] caves whenever Jezebel was killing the
[1:26:25] prophets. He was hid and fed them and w
[1:26:27] and gave them water. So here this is the
[1:26:29] man that comes to meet Elijah. Elijah
[1:26:30] said, "You go get Ahab, tell him I'll
[1:26:32] meet him this day." And the man says to
[1:26:34] him, he says, "I Why would you ask me to
[1:26:35] do that? You're just trying to get me
[1:26:37] killed." So because I'm going to go to
[1:26:39] Ahab and tell him you're here. And then
[1:26:41] Ahab's going to come here because he has
[1:26:43] searched far and wide for you. He's sent
[1:26:45] men into every kingdom of this world
[1:26:46] asking, "Have you seen this man, Elijah,
[1:26:48] that's caused so much torture in Israel?
[1:26:50] He's he's got a there there's actually a
[1:26:52] warrant out for your arrest. There's a
[1:26:54] there's a wanted poster in every town
[1:26:56] where I live, Elijah, with your face on
[1:26:58] it, and you want me to go tell him that
[1:27:00] you're here, and when he comes here and
[1:27:01] he don't find you here, he's going to
[1:27:03] kill me. And what have I done to you? I
[1:27:05] helped the prophets."
[1:27:06] And Elijah made gave him his word. He
[1:27:08] said, "No, listen. I'm going to be here
[1:27:11] when he comes. I'll give you my word on
[1:27:13] it. This day Ahab will meet Elijah.
[1:27:17] He had fled from him, hid from him. Ahab
[1:27:20] was a great king, killed by the
[1:27:23] thousands, great warrior king, had a
[1:27:26] great army. But Elijah said, "This day,
[1:27:28] he'll meet me face to face."
[1:27:31] So, you know, they went and told Ahab, I
[1:27:34] know where Elijah is.
[1:27:36] You do? Went down where he was. Bible
[1:27:39] said he came down. First words out of
[1:27:42] Ahab's mouth, you're the troublemaker.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; You're the troublemaker. You're the one
[1:27:47] that's stirring up all this trouble.
[1:27:49] I've been ready. I've been looking for
[1:27:50] you.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; And Elijah said, "Well, the Lord told me
[1:27:53] the rain's going to come.
[1:27:56] Same God that brought the famine is the
[1:27:58] God that's going to bring rain." He
[1:28:01] said, "What you've done?" He said,
[1:28:02] "You're the you caused all this trouble
[1:28:04] in Israel." Elijah just looked right at
[1:28:06] him. He said, "No, sir." He said,
[1:28:07] "You've caused the trouble in Israel."
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You caused it when you brought
[1:28:10] false gods into our temple. You caused
[1:28:12] it when you let Balam took the doctrine
[1:28:14] of Balam and established it over our
[1:28:16] people instead of the doctrine of God.
[1:28:18] When you brought false doctrine in the
[1:28:19] pull pit of God. You caused it.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; You brought the famine. That's
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Said, I'll tell you what you do. You go
[1:28:27] get your 400 prophets,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; 450
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; and you bring them up on this mountain
[1:28:31] and we'll just all meet up there and
[1:28:33] we'll find out if that God that you've
[1:28:35] been serving is really God or if the God
[1:28:37] I'm telling you.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; So, you know what Ahab done? They were
[1:28:42] in a famine. They had no choice. People
[1:28:43] were starving and dying.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; So, he called all the the prophets
[1:28:47] together. Elijah met him up on Mount
[1:28:49] Carmel.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; He when he got up on top of the
[1:28:52] mountain, he said, "I'll tell you what
[1:28:53] you do. You take your sacrifice."
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "You call upon your God and let
[1:28:57] the God that answereth by fire, let him
[1:28:59] be the God." So, they got up there and
[1:29:02] they went to cutting themselves and
[1:29:03] chanting and calling upon their God.
[1:29:05] Come on down. Light this light this
[1:29:07] altar. Come on.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Let light a fire up on the altar.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Elijah stood back and he said, "What's
[1:29:12] the matter? Is your God asleep?"
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Why Why ain't he answering you?
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; You're petitioning your God. You're
[1:29:18] getting no response.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Why didn't he answer? I thought you had
[1:29:21] a God. I thought he was a a great God. I
[1:29:23] You put him in your temples. You put him
[1:29:25] in all your homes. You worship him every
[1:29:26] day.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; You spend all your time talking to him
[1:29:29] and looking at him. And
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; But why ain't he answering you? Why
[1:29:33] can't he help you when you really need
[1:29:34] something?
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; You got the wrong God. You've been
[1:29:37] packing around the wrong God, the wrong
[1:29:39] idol.
[1:29:41] So they Elijah says, "Now says, "Let's
[1:29:45] just see if our God."
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm the only one left that
[1:29:48] believes in God.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; I'm the only prophet left."
[1:29:52] He stood up on that mountain. You know
[1:29:54] what he done? I love this. Cuz it's in
[1:29:55] the middle of a famine.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; There ain't no water nowhere. And he
[1:29:59] takes the last bit of water they have
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; and he dumps it on the ground.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Take barrels of water. that water is a
[1:30:05] precious commodity. Without water, he he
[1:30:08] says, "Dug this trench around the altar.
[1:30:09] Fill the trench up with water. Dump
[1:30:11] water on the altar. Dump water on the
[1:30:14] sacrifice. Dump water. Get some more
[1:30:15] barrels of water. Just keep dumping
[1:30:17] water on it. Keep dumping water."
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Just so you don't think anything ever
[1:30:21] happened.
[1:30:23] And the Bible says that whenever he
[1:30:24] turned, he said, "God, you're the God of
[1:30:26] heaven."
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; You sent me here to this mountain, Lord,
[1:30:29] to vindicate thy word. I've obeyed you,
[1:30:31] Lord.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; And now I'm asking you to answer. Amen.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; And you know what he done for the day?
[1:30:37] He came down
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; with fire and it consumed up the altar.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says the fire of God, it
[1:30:43] licked up the sacrifice. It licked up
[1:30:45] the the the altar. It licked up the
[1:30:47] water. It licked up the dirt. It licked
[1:30:49] up the stones. Everything that they laid
[1:30:52] upon the altar was consumed by the fire
[1:30:54] of God.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; And then Elijah turned to the men. They
[1:30:56] had a newfound courage. He said, "These
[1:30:58] men have been lying to you. All every
[1:31:00] 450 of them. They've lied to you. They
[1:31:03] they they've destroyed you. They took
[1:31:04] the faith of your God out of your life.
[1:31:06] And the Bible says Elijah pursued them
[1:31:08] down to the valley and they slew all of
[1:31:11] those prophets down there in the valley.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; They took their lives and they slew them
[1:31:15] to that and it raised the faith in the
[1:31:18] people. I thought, my isn't that what
[1:31:19] what happens when God answers that
[1:31:22] there's been liars. You realize there's
[1:31:23] been liars in your life there. There's
[1:31:25] been a deceiver in your heart. I'm not
[1:31:27] talking about 450. The Bible tells us
[1:31:29] there was 200,000 thousand demons that
[1:31:32] was released in the river upon and these
[1:31:34] spirits are are moving around this
[1:31:36] world. They're lying to the people of
[1:31:38] God.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Thousands of demons that lie and lie and
[1:31:41] lie upon upon God that you can't believe
[1:31:44] God and you can't receive the promise of
[1:31:46] God and God done forgot about you and
[1:31:48] you'll never go anywhere with God and
[1:31:49] the revival has already died out of your
[1:31:51] life and you wret you wrecked your
[1:31:53] pinnacle.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; And you'll never get back there again.
[1:31:56] But Elijah said, "They're liars."
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; You know what they done? They turned
[1:32:00] around. They pursued after him.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said you had
[1:32:03] possessed the gate of your enemy. I
[1:32:04] don't care what enemy it is. And I don't
[1:32:05] care where he hides. They those prophets
[1:32:08] had nowhere to hide.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; And neither does your enemy.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; When you turn on him and say, "But I
[1:32:13] have a word from the Lord."
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm in a different season of my
[1:32:16] life. I went through a long season. I
[1:32:19] went through a season of doubt. I I
[1:32:20] spent a years of my life where I turned
[1:32:22] my back on God. I spent years being
[1:32:24] backslid. I'm in a different season of
[1:32:26] my life.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; And Satan, you're a liar.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; And I've got a right to receive the
[1:32:31] promises of God. I'm in a season of
[1:32:33] receiving God's promises.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; You may have been backsplit.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; I don't care. I don't care what what
[1:32:40] your story is. It doesn't really matter
[1:32:43] what the story is. You know what
[1:32:45] happened.
[1:32:47] Elijah after God had moved,
[1:32:50] he c called out to the men. He said, "I
[1:32:53] hear the sound of an abundance of rain."
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; There wasn't a sign of rain. He said,
[1:32:59] "But I hear the sound of an abundance of
[1:33:01] rain."
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; He told Ahab, he said, "You better get
[1:33:03] up early this morning. Make sure you get
[1:33:04] your breakfast, get your stuff packed,
[1:33:07] cuz you're not going to have time to
[1:33:08] make it back home before this storm
[1:33:11] hits. I hear the sound of an abundance."
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; So, there ain't a sign of rain anymore
[1:33:17] anywhere. We've been in a famine this
[1:33:18] whole time. Elijah went up on the
[1:33:20] mountain. You know what he did? and he
[1:33:21] went into a private place between him
[1:33:24] and God.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; I love how Elijah answers God. God said,
[1:33:29] "I heard your prayer. There's going to
[1:33:30] be rain." He went out and he called
[1:33:32] Ahab. Put his own life in danger to
[1:33:34] stand before Ahab
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; because God said it was going to happen.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Now he's standing up there again. He
[1:33:40] said, "Lord, you gave the promise. I
[1:33:43] done everything you asked me to do."
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; And he sent his servant. He said, "You
[1:33:47] go out there.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; And tell me when you see rain coming."
[1:33:50] Yes, sir.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; The servant went out and he said, "Come
[1:33:53] back." He said, "Elijah, I don't see any
[1:33:54] rain." He said, "That's okay." He said,
[1:33:57] "Go out there again."
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Come back and tell me you see some rain.
[1:34:01] He went out again. Came back and said,
[1:34:02] "Elijah, I don't see no rain." That's
[1:34:05] okay. Go back out there
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; and look again. Come back and tell me
[1:34:08] there's rain. He went back out.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Came back. I don't see no rain. That's
[1:34:12] okay. Go back out there and look again.
[1:34:15] Come back and tell me when you see the
[1:34:16] rain. He went back out. There was no
[1:34:18] rain. I thought my how he must have
[1:34:20] began to doubt more time after time. But
[1:34:22] the Bible says, "But seven times he went
[1:34:24] out looking for a sign of rain." But
[1:34:26] Elijah said, "You just keep looking
[1:34:27] until you see it."
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something like God would say,
[1:34:30] "You just keep looking till you see it."
[1:34:32] The promise is there. Maybe you can't
[1:34:34] see it. Maybe maybe you've been blinded
[1:34:36] by your circumstance or or blinded by
[1:34:38] drought or something that's been going
[1:34:39] on in your life. He said, "You just keep
[1:34:41] looking until you see it." Finally, the
[1:34:43] servant of the Lord, he came back to
[1:34:45] Elijah. He said, "Elijah, you ain't
[1:34:47] going to believe it." He said, "The
[1:34:48] whale over there by the water. I see a
[1:34:50] cloud about the size of a man's hand."
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; And Elijah, he jumped up and he told
[1:34:56] Ahab, he said, "You better get home cuz
[1:34:58] there's a storm coming. God is opening
[1:35:00] up the windows of heaven and pouring out
[1:35:03] a water that we can't even contain."
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; He got so inspired. It didn't take just
[1:35:09] a little bitty cloud. And it got enough
[1:35:12] inspiration under Elijah that he forgot
[1:35:14] about all the troubles and he outran the
[1:35:16] chariots back home.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; He got so inspired. But said it wasn't
[1:35:20] some great big thing. They just seen a
[1:35:22] little bitty thing
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; and it was enough to put enough fire in
[1:35:26] him to cause him to out. He was an old
[1:35:28] man that could barely even walk up that
[1:35:29] mountain. But he raced the horses going
[1:35:31] back down.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; He said he's just seen a little thing.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Don't matter who you are. Maybe you're
[1:35:37] backslid. Maybe you're an unbeliever. He
[1:35:39] said, "You may have been all scrippled
[1:35:40] up in water baptisms, everything else,
[1:35:42] but if you'll let the spirit of God open
[1:35:43] your eyes and show you a little
[1:35:45] something, and then you just start from
[1:35:47] there,
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; I hear the sound of an abundance of
[1:35:49] rain,
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; it don't matter you believe on creeds
[1:35:51] instead of the word, come back to the
[1:35:53] word." When you just see a little move
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; and your faith accepted it, that's what
[1:35:59] I'm looking for.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "When we're looking for the
[1:36:01] coming of the Lord, we look at the Holy
[1:36:03] Ghost fall in the last days. We look at
[1:36:05] signs and wonders." He said, "What's
[1:36:07] taking place?" He said, "That's exactly
[1:36:09] what God said would take place.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; You may not seen it in your home, but
[1:36:13] it's going on around you. There's a
[1:36:15] revival going on. You may not have
[1:36:16] revival in your heart, but there's a
[1:36:18] revival going on all around you. We see
[1:36:20] the supernatural signs and wonders,
[1:36:22] dead, raised, people healed." He said,
[1:36:24] "Recognize what it is. It's exactly what
[1:36:26] God said would take place. Let your
[1:36:28] faith grab a hold of it
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; and say, "I want that, too."
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Come on, man.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "What did he?" Watch what
[1:36:34] Elijah done. He said when he accepted
[1:36:36] it, he said his his life must have been
[1:36:38] renewed. He outran all the chariots back
[1:36:40] home just because he's accepted. He
[1:36:42] said, "Go get the rain barrels out and
[1:36:45] and I hear the sound of an abundance of
[1:36:47] rain." He said, "The first little move
[1:36:49] is all it took."
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; To put Elijah on the run.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; It just took a little move. He said,
[1:36:55] "Oh, people, if you haven't received the
[1:36:57] Holy Ghost, the first little tinkle that
[1:36:59] would say that's the truth, that man's
[1:37:00] telling the word." He said, "Hurry as
[1:37:02] quick as you can and go get it. Don't
[1:37:05] wait. The first little move. When Elijah
[1:37:07] saw that move, it was evidence. Listen
[1:37:10] what a prophet said. He said when Elijah
[1:37:12] saw that move of God,
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; this little bitty move, it wasn't some
[1:37:16] great thing. He said when he saw that
[1:37:18] little move, he said it was evidence
[1:37:20] that God had answered his prayer.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; It wasn't no great thing. It was an
[1:37:25] evidence, a little move. He said, "I
[1:37:26] wish every sick person in here this
[1:37:28] morning that feels the Holy Spirit in
[1:37:30] your presence right now could realize
[1:37:32] that it's the evidence of a prayer that
[1:37:34] you pray has been answered in the
[1:37:36] presence of God." Oh friends, let me
[1:37:38] tell you tonight, if you just kill a
[1:37:40] little move of God in this place as God
[1:37:42] is moving up and down these aisles, it
[1:37:44] don't take a great move of God that just
[1:37:46] a little tingle of the move of God is
[1:37:48] evidence that God has already answered
[1:37:51] your prayer.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Run to him.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and receive your promise.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Won't you stand to your feet to that?
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "Every man who wants the
[1:38:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost, if you feel a
[1:38:02] little grand feeling, say, I believe
[1:38:03] that's the truth." He said, "You should
[1:38:05] take that."
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; It's the evidence that my answer, my
[1:38:08] prayer's been answered.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Raise up your hands and say, God, I
[1:38:11] receive it now.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; And something will take place.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; That's the word of God.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Word of God.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; When you feel a little moved, maybe
[1:38:19] you've been praying about something. Let
[1:38:20] me tell you what a prophet said. I
[1:38:22] believe it to be a word from the Lord.
[1:38:23] Yes sir.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Said when you feel a little bit of move,
[1:38:26] how many feels the spirit of the Lord
[1:38:27] tonight?
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; How many's been praying about something?
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; He said when you feel that little move,
[1:38:32] it's the evidence of a prayer that you
[1:38:34] prayed has been answered in the presence
[1:38:35] of God.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; So raise up your hands and say, "God, I
[1:38:39] receive it now."
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Something will take place.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many can do that tonight.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; You lift your hands to the Lord. Say,
[1:38:46] "Lord, I receive. Lord, I I've been
[1:38:49] praying. Lord, I I know this is the
[1:38:50] hour. It's a season of receiving an
[1:38:52] answer to my prayer. I don't care how
[1:38:54] hard it's been. I don't care how long
[1:38:56] you pray.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much trouble that it's
[1:38:59] been that God brought you through things
[1:39:00] to bring you to this place.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; And he sent a word from the Lord. He
[1:39:05] said Elijah knew it was an answer to his
[1:39:07] prayer. He just take a little move. He
[1:39:09] said, "Oh God, if we could just see only
[1:39:11] the promise of the word that Christ
[1:39:13] promised, he told us wherever two or
[1:39:15] three are assembled in my name, I am
[1:39:17] there in their midst. And whatever they
[1:39:19] ask, they shall receive. If we can just
[1:39:21] see it and then the first move we can
[1:39:23] move right into it.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; God is promising in his word. Can you
[1:39:28] step into it
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; tonight? Won't you lift your hand to the
[1:39:31] Lord? Say, Lord, I receive it.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, here we are as a body of believers
[1:39:38] tonight.
[1:39:40] God, knowing Lord that many are the
[1:39:44] needs of your people.
[1:39:47] God, you called me tonight, Lord, and
[1:39:49] today, Lord, and put this on my heart,
[1:39:51] God, to be able to speak to your
[1:39:53] children. Lord, I surrender my life to
[1:39:55] you. Lord, I surrender my vessel
[1:39:58] tonight, Lord, just to speak the words
[1:40:00] that you put in my heart. Lord, I
[1:40:01] haven't held anything back. God, I said
[1:40:04] everything you put on my heart to say,
[1:40:07] Lord, I realize that you're here
[1:40:08] tonight. Lord, I see you moving amongst
[1:40:11] your children. And Lord, I see you
[1:40:12] moving on hearts and Lord, many great
[1:40:14] knees, Lord. Tears that are flowing down
[1:40:17] people's faces, God. Here's a real need.
[1:40:21] Lord, you give us a word tonight, Lord,
[1:40:23] that when we see a move of God, it's the
[1:40:26] answer to our prayer. God, it may be a
[1:40:29] little thing, Lord. It may seem like
[1:40:30] something that we may get accustomed to,
[1:40:32] but Lord, I accept it, Lord. God, I
[1:40:35] receive it as an answer to my prayer
[1:40:37] tonight.
[1:40:38] Lord, I pray for these children of God
[1:40:41] tonight, Lord, with their hands raised,
[1:40:44] God, believing upon your word, God, that
[1:40:46] you have answered it. Lord, we say we
[1:40:48] receive it, God. We thank you for all
[1:40:50] you've done for us, Lord. God, I thank
[1:40:53] you for answering our prayer, Lord. I

[1:45:34] [Music]
[1:45:36] There is no one else like me. You see,
[1:45:43] when God answers a prayer, God starts
[1:45:46] moving. You say, "What happened?" Elijah
[1:45:49] recognized the move of God and then he
[1:45:51] ran to the promise.
[1:45:53] When they were in the boat, they
[1:45:54] recognized a a move of God. He said,
[1:45:57] "Drop this old faith and believe and
[1:46:01] believe again." You know what? They ran
[1:46:02] to the promise. When Peter was was
[1:46:04] stepping out to to walk on water, he was
[1:46:07] believe. Believe and and he had to walk
[1:46:11] out to where he was. See, see, God
[1:46:13] moves, but then it's our move. See, when
[1:46:17] God moves, then it's your move. What are
[1:46:18] you going to do when God moves? He said,
[1:46:20] "Wait, we see him moving a little bit.
[1:46:22] We ought to be able to receive.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many tonight just say,
[1:46:25] "Lord, can I just Can I just say that
[1:46:27] it's your move?"
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; God's moving in your life. It's your
[1:46:30] move. What are you going to do with the
[1:46:31] move of God that he's brought in your
[1:46:32] life? What are you going to do with the
[1:46:34] revival that he's brought into your
[1:46:35] life?
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with the
[1:46:36] healing?
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; The answer to the prayer that God's
[1:46:39] brought in your life.

[1:46:55] a God that's been there even when I felt
[1:46:58] like giving up.

[1:47:02] him tonight?

[1:57:02] will make a road
[1:57:06] when you bear a heavy lo.
[1:57:12] I know
[1:57:15] God will make a way.
[1:57:20] It must have felt strange to end up
[1:57:23] stranded
[1:57:24] between an army and the sea. It must
[1:57:28] have felt forsaken. wondering why God
[1:57:33] wasn't all he said he'd be.
[1:57:36] But when your back's against a wall,
[1:57:40] that's the hardest place of all.
[1:57:45] Somewhere between provision
[1:57:48] and impossibilities,
[1:57:50] [Music]
[1:57:54] I know God
[1:57:56] will make a way.
[1:58:00] When there seems to be no way,
[1:58:04] whenever he is faithful,
[1:58:09] he
[1:58:10] will make a road.
[1:58:14] When you bear a heavy load,
[1:58:19] I know
[1:58:22] God will make a way.
[1:58:28] When a wall of circumstances
[1:58:31] leaves you crying in the night
[1:58:35] and you struggle till your strength is
[1:58:39] almost gone.
[1:58:43] I know God will gently hold you in the
[1:58:47] shelter of his heart.
[1:58:51] Then he'll carve a road for you to carry
[1:58:55] on.
[1:58:59] Oh God,
[1:59:01] he will make
[1:59:03] a way
[1:59:04] when there seems to be no way
[1:59:09] forever.
[1:59:10] He is faithful.
[1:59:13] He He will make a road. Hallelujah. When
[1:59:19] you bear a heavy load,
[1:59:24] I know
[1:59:27] God will make a way.

[1:59:35] God will make a way.
