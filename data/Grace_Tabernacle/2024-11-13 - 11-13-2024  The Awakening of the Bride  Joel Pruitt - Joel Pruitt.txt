or Temptations come all you got to do is speak his name let's all stand as we get ready to sing this song she's going to help me with it you know it's kind of for me I see as my Christian walking even in my natural life as things go on you get older and go through different stages how different songs kind of come to you and this song has been you know I I sing it now and I can re relate to it because I got a a young boy and he'll in the middle of the night he wakes up and he'll start crying out for me and you'll just and we're doing this sleep training so we we try to leave him alone but it's something within a Father's Heart whenever your child starts crying out for you there's something within you that that me that I man I want to go grab him I want to go hug him I want to hold him but you know our heavenly father you know if me as a natural man can feel that how much more as a Heavenly Father whenever he hears your cry and you cry out to him how much more he wants to come to you so maybe you have a need this evening maybe something on your heart some a burden you know just cry out to him cuz he's in your boat this evening and he will come and calm your storm cross the oh just sing it with us [Music] tonight started violently blowing he was asleep in the oh does he not care that we perish we're helpless and we're so afraid [Music] Jesus arose when they called him and

your voice lift your hands it's time to child your C have awoken the master amen you believe that tonight mean want somebody give the Lord a hand hand clap of praise and I believe that he's more than able he's heard every cry he knows what we have need of he's the same God he's the same yesterday today and forever the same God that was in Isaac or the god of Isaac and Jacob and Abraham can you imagine all the mighty things that God done with many great men and he's our God tonight amen he's still moving among his children and now we just certainly love the Lord and we just want to remember in prayer uh brother Jo puit is here with us tonight will be speaking for us and just thank thank him for taking the time to come and I just had a couple requests remember Sherman willhide he's in ICU please remember him in prayer and also um sister Adonna uh Bor uh brother Andrew is there speaking for them this evening she's was diagnosed with stage four cancer and so we just ask the Lord to touch her body as well if you have a need on your heart just each one just maybe lift your hand to the Lord I know God knows what we have need of tonight but David man it's kind of odd he asked me to pray on tonight because here while back we' prayed for my sister some of you know my oldest sister her name's debin with the back problems that she'd had they uh they took her in uh they put it off a couple of times but they operated on her yesterday and it was about a 12-hour surgery it was rough and they U said that there was four she had four broken vertebraes instead of two took about like I said 12 hours so she was out a long time and had some side effects from the anesthesia but she's doing better and I'm thankful that we serve a god brother Joe when I was praying for I was kind of worried for but I thought you know what the Bible says the angel of the Lord en camps around about them that fear Him and if you could have seen it in that operating room that day I believe that there was angels and if you could look be on this Veil right now there's angels in here I believe they're concerned tonight and they're giving charge over you cuz we have a father that brother saids concerned so we're going to take these needs before the Lord let's pray in our own way Lord tonight God I thank you that you're my father Lord Lord we love you so much tonight God there's been so many times in my life I didn't feel like I could make it another step but Lord you've always been there you're so faithful God you keep your word and Lord we come as Sons and Daughters tonight believing Lord that these requests that was made known as sister B cancer Lord we've seen it many times cancer is nothing for you but God I pray that you'd help her because the Bible says that the effectual for forever righteous man ath much Lord I just pray tonight to each one of these Lord that I know you're mindful you knew them before they ever written down and I believe you're God that hears and answers prayer believe you're able to answer tonight because some two th000 years ago as you packed that cross and those stripes was put on your back lord you paid the price for healing Lord I Thank you and I just pray you'd be merciful just pray bless the rest of the service we'd be careful to give you the praise that we ask you in Jesus name amen amen how may come to hear the preaching of the word tonight tonight amen amen how how many believes God can speak to you through a Ministry amen we certainly believe that tonight just welcome our our visors here tonight God bless y'all amen we just we're worthy of it all you're worthy of it all for from you are all things to you are all things and you deserve the glory you're worthy of it [Music] all for all things and to you are all things you deserve the glory oh yes you are worthy of it all you believe he's worthy tonight oh yes you're worthy of it [Music] all oh for from you are all things to you are all all things you deserve oh sing it one more time if you believe he's worthy now oh you are worthy of it all yes you are Lord you are worthy of it [Music] all for you are all things to you are all things you deserve the glory and you believe he's worthy of it all tonight amen if you have a need on your heart I wonder if we could just bow our heads one more time just before the word Goes Forth I wonder if we could just say Lord open my heart tonight not to what a man could bring but I believe God has something special every time we come to the house of God if we could just lay aside all the tiredness and all the work that we've done today today everything that would try to so easily beset us and maybe keep us from a blessing here tonight let's just bow our heads for a moment if you have a need just put your hand up to him tonight Heavenly Father Lord I pray Lord for each and every person that's sitting in the sound of my voice tonight Lord if there's sickness here I pray Lord they wouldn't leave feeble or sick tonight and Lord I pray that if there's one here tonight that's a backslider or needs salvation or maybe just a refilling of the Holy Ghost Lord there's nothing too hard for God and we believe that this could be their night here tonight Lord we believe that this was an appointment that was made in before the foundation of the world where we would be standing here and the people would be sitting or standing there and Lord you had a thought in mind and you thought that you would want to feed your people here tonight and maybe there would be something Lord that would just try to come in this service to hinder the move of God but Lord we say we want to break every wall down and every chain here tonight and just worship freely in the house of God I pray Lord you would move everything out of the way that would be unlike you everything that would not be pleasing to you we pray you would remove it tonight bind my lips that I wouldn't say anything that would be contrary to your word and I pray you would move Among Us now in Jesus name we pray and the church said amen if you have your Bibles I'm not going to sing tonight we're going to just you guys have done a wonderful job the child your cries of awoken the master I love that one of my favorite songs and I I I appreciate yall singing that one that's it's good and if I had a thought tonight if you have your Bibles go ahead turn to Psalms 85 and we'll start with verse 6 actually 85 and verse 6 if I had a thought tonight I would like to title it the Awakening of the bride and just a just a simple thought if we can make it that way tonight if the Lord will help us Psalms 85 and verse 6 wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee show us thy mercy oh Lord and grant us thy salvation I will hear what God the Lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to his Saints but let them not turn again to Folly and if we could also turn over in our Bibles there just if we could go to Genesis chapter 2 Genesis chapter 2 and verse 21 Genesis 2 and 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh and she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man so we want to just stop there and may the Lord add His blessings to the word you may be seated take amen how many's happy happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight I know it's Wednesday night so we're just going I'm just going to take all the restrictions off and maybe we'll just preach here for a little biten if that' be okay with you it's always good to come back here and I appreciate brother Matt and and the opportunity I I count this an honor to come here and speak to what we'd consider a sister Church of ours and and uh I I I really enjoyed the tent Meetings online they're really good I'm sorry I couldn't make all the services but uh we didn't know what you know the dates until kind of last minute so brother Matt already told me the dates for next year so we're good and uh I don't have any I'm without excuse and so and so so we just we just but we love you all and we appreciate your heart to serve people thank you all so much when you come and support our meetings and we pray that we can continue to do the same we do love every one of you I want to send greetings from my pastor brother Ben puit and uh he he loves you all as well and right here tonight when I was studying this thought it kind of come to me just my mind works different brother Matt I may not be a normal preacher everything's a little odd everything's a little bit uh all over the place I'm a little scattered when I even when I preach but I'm definitely that way when I'm studying because I may have four or five different thoughts going at the same time now where do where does the Lord want me to go well this one uh was the only one that survived without getting deleted so so that's the only one I got and so uh but you know I want you also tonight just to just to think back we read there in Genesis 2 how God would actually cause Adam to sleep and I want us just to think about that for a minute when he actually took Eve from the side of Adam you notice the animals he would take he would he would create a male animal he could maybe a monkey and then uh the female monkey would actually come from the dirt as well you notice but in the female life when Adam was made there had to come a woman from Adam it couldn't be just another piece of dirt but it had to be from the very flesh of Adam and so there was something there that God was thinking way ahead in time and he thought of a bride that was going to come that had to be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh and I would like to just go ahead and get ahead of my Sermon Just a little bit tonight and say that's you here tonight you are bone of his bone you are flesh of his flesh amen I believe we are his bride tonight brother brandom said you are she and I I would just like to say here tonight just to encourage you don't get discouraged in the time we live in because this age may be going down but the bride is looking up because I believe we're closer than we've ever been can you say Amen so we're not looking for Destruction if you're in the bride we're not looking uh for Doom and Gloom if you're in the bride but what we're looking for tonight is a Rapture can you say amen and we have actually become the very body of Jesus Christ on the earth here tonight so we're not looking we're not looking for another bride to come we're not looking for another Messenger to bring another bride but we have heard the voice of God in our day and we know that we have been called for such a time as this can you say amen and so if you go to Malachi 4 just real quick I didn't put this in there but Malachi 4 youall know it but if you go down there in verse two he said unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall so think about the calves of the stall they've been fed good you've had Mana from Heaven you've you've you've been feasting on spiritual food in due season there's a Time such as this that the bride had to be ready to go so they had to have something to feed on can you say amen and so we're not just feeding on another denominational idea or another opinion of a man but we're actually feeding on the very body word of the son of man can you say amen and so we realized that in Malachi 4 God would send a prophet that in an age that would be so dark and where the Revival fires had died out there would be no Awakening in the modern churches oh they might have good music they might have dancing they might have shouting and I believe in all of those things I hope you do too because there's nothing wrong with shouting over what you believe in there's nothing wrong with having a good time in the house of God but remember those things are not what save you those things are not your anchor those things are just uh those are good things to have those are things when I tell you what you can bask in the presence of God and and I believe I tell you what I I've told our church I wish we had more that run the aisles I wish we had more that stand up and drown you out when you was preaching that's okay because what it is that that's just people getting excited they've been stimulated by the Revelation that has come and I'm I'm good with that but let me tell you that's not the focus of the hour the focus is the word that has been opened in this day to reveal the secrets of the the people to reveal the secrets of the hearts to the people remember this was a prophetic Ministry that came and it will never have another one come there'll never be another messenger like this messenger can you say Amen so we're not looking for another one there's got to be somebody that would turn the hearts of the people back and that one has already come and so I want to just say this just as a background when you look ahead and start looking for something to come well something Great's going to happen and then I'll have faith for a Rapture something Great's going to happen and then I can go to church and well come on somebody listen there's nothing more that needs to happen the word has come and called out a bride you are she can I say that tonight so if we just go on down here brother Brandon would say it like this in the spoken word is the Original Seed he said High breeding first started in Eden started in Genesis it's the beginning that's where and it ends up over here in Revelation at the second coming of Christ he said now remember correctly that's why each generation has its own Revival it gets a chance at the word can you say Amen every one of you had to have a chance of the word of this day God would not put you here and not send a word to call you out can you say Amen because God when God sent Luther to the Earth there was a people that were ready to hear the words of Luther and they would follow the message of that hour can you say Amen Wesley would come along and there had to be a people that was ready to follow the message of Wesley now the ones that denominated the Lutheran then would actually turn down the true word that that because they didn't see it why it was blinded to them because they were still living in a light from another day they were living in the time of Luther and they failed to walk in the light of their day now Wesley would do the same thing Wesley would come along and he had a truth for that hour remember he would call out the people for that hour and they would come to light but remember Pentecost would do the same thing 1906 1906 Pentecost that was a real move of God we don't do away with any of these things sanctification justification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and the tongues these are none of these things were wrong but they would stop there and fail to see the very light that was going forward see they would come out of a little bit they would come out of Darkness into a little bit of light and then they would stop and then they would die it was a cycle of Revival and death can you say amen and so this bride will not partake in a death in their Revival this revival is going to go right on until the coming of the Lord can you say Amen we are not going to die because I tell you what every age might have had their Revival and what they did they would denominate and they would die now a prophet would come right back and say this bride will not denominate oh there may be some people in the message that denominated but this bride will not denominate so you can't die because that's what brings death if you look back in the Garden of Eden and you think back and Eve was there and all she had to do listen they had everything perfect in the Garden of Eden they had no they had no troubles they had no sickness no worry no stress no wedding planning nothing like that everything was perfect everything was perfect Congratulations by the way but everything was good and then and then there's one thing that she's not allowed to do don't touch this one tree and I know no doubt Adam said now Eve the Lord God has spoken and said you can have everything you can have the unlimited Amazon cards you can have the whole bank account everything's yours every everything every tree in the garden every fruit every vegetable every every herb everything is yours but don't touch this one thing and one word would cause death to the entire human race do you see how important the opening of the word is because now you can see the full word restored and we don't have to wonder about it we can see it and there will be no more death why because this eve will not fall can you say amen and she was taken from the side of her Adam can you say Amen she's from the very side of Christ himself but she cannot because God knew when the first one was made there'd be a fall but this eve cannot fall listen God knew that there had to come to Christ to restore a fallen Eve but you can't fall that ought to give somebody a shouting room here tonight you cannot fall away I liked how a brother said at a youth camp here a few months back he said you may fall down but you can't fall away you may make mistakes but that don't mean you ain't bride get right back up and keep trying just because you made a mistake doesn't take you out of this remember brother Brandon would scream and say get back and step he didn't say well that one's not bright he said get back in line with the word of God just because you've Fallen don't stay down but get right back up and say I believe the voice of God for this day has restored my heart back God has called us for such a time as this it's an open book time it's an Awakening of the Bride time it's a time to wake up Sleeping Giant wipe the sleep from your eyes and recognize your day and its message let me get back to my notes here before I just preach and forget them brother Brandon would say like this he said now get on down here he said now a Revival is not bringing in new members but it's to revive what you have it's nice to see new members but that's not what we're really look listen we we need to focus on Outreach I absolutely believe in that I I'm so thrilled when I see people coming back not switching churches but coming back coming back you know it's good to go where you want to go but let me tell you when you see people that ain't in church brother Matt it does something for you they've been out there and they've been in drugs they've been in alcohol some of you I guarantee you've been there but where are you tonight sitting together in Heavenly places hearing the word of God listen I know where you've been but listen that that does not define you that does not define you for tribulation you don't have to go through tribulation because of your past a blood that still works has covered your sin you don't have to worry about it why because you've been called this is your season this is your time this is your revival can I say it like that the bride has got to have an Awakening the bride has got to have a Revival and brother Brandon would actually deal with this in the third seal and he would say the bride hasn't had a Revival yet but then he goes on he doesn't stop there and I'm so thankful he did because so many are still looking for a Revival or or or more word to be come back and be revealed listen the word has been revealed we have Revelations 10:7 for a reason it has been revealed bu the book is open the seals have been taken off well can you say Amen now I want you to notice there's a different in in a national Revival in a bride Revival brother Ram said it's over for the for the N for the national Revival there will be no more an American Revival he said she has been condemned and and he said that's thus sayith the Lord he said he said her time will run out someday he said she's on her downward move right now she'll never come back again can you say Amen she's gone that's right she's been gone since 1956 when she condemned and turned away God from the great Revival hours now that's Doom and Gloom to the world but he's not talking to the bride we're going to go somewhere is this okay is this okay so far all right he said now that's what's the reason today that the revivals that we're supposed to have the denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere the bride hasn't had a Revival yet now remember 1963 the third seal we'll get some okay I'm not I'm not putting quotes against each other by the way but a prophet had progressive revelation a prophet would look back he could look back after he preached it and say I didn't even know what I was preaching I didn't even recognize the time it happened but he then he would tell the people that what they had missed was The Awakening of the bride and so he goes on he said they've got all kinds of church members and they've got all kinds of people and and he said but the bride hasn't had Revival yet it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again can you say Amen now just because I believe brother Andrew said this before just because somebody preached the Thunders wrong a prophet already preached it right yes sir and so we don't have to be scared to say what a prophet said we don't have to be scared to preach all that a prophet said we don't have to worry about some false Doctrine Thunders movement that is tried to creep its way into the message and be under the umbrella of the message of the hour and say this is what brother brand meant I know what he meant because I can read what he said and so I don't have to worry about well I'm I'm preaching new Thunders doctor no I believe that the Thunders the Mysteries contained in those Seven Seals that's what a prophet said and he said it would take those Thunders to wake up a bride if the Thunders have uttered the bride's awake can you say Amen you're not I tell you what we're awake here tonight we don't have to worry we're not we're not going back to another time where where the where the bride has got to be awoke with another message or you know brother Matt I I I don't I'm not coming with a new message you're not coming with a new message all these evangelists and ministers and pastors that brother Matt brings in here they're not coming with a message of their own but they're coming to say that a prophet already came and he came to restore a bride and we're participating in the Revival called a bride's Revival and it is a word Revival it's not built on emotion it's not built on a man it's not built on just a personality but it is built on thus sayeth the Lord so we're looking not for another Revival but we are in revival can you say Amen well I tell you they're looking for Revival in all the Pentecostal churches if you hadn't spoken tongues you don't have listen here tonight we're looking for a word restoration and that's what we want to see in the lives of the people well am I in Revival brother Joel if you're under this messenger and you have accepted the message for your day you are in the bride's Revival don't let nobody put you out of it you're in it you are the bride's Revival well can you say Amen we're going to go on down a little farther before I I get stopped and I end up being here too late brother Joe he said now this messenger m M 4 Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals that's in the church H book now remember there was still healing campaigns going on there was still revivals they would call them going on they would still have prayer lines and pray for the sick and we still do because it's still part of the restoration message well can you sayen we don't do away with anything that has been restored to the church but remember the focus the focus is on the Awakening of the Bride to hear the word of God and become the word herself can you say amen and so he says here he says everywhere now there's no Revival everybody's complaining ministers crying this is 1964 recognizing your day in this message he said fast pray fast pray sound a trumpet how many reads it he's talking about the herald of his coming brother Jack Moore's magazine he say it's a great thing good people he wasn't condemning the people they just hadn't recognized the light that had come yet so we're not listen when you go out here witnessing we're not telling these people that you're not bride we don't know who is and who isn't there could be some sitting out there on the street corner tonight smoking and drinking and and doing all kinds of hard drugs or whatever and that may be the very bride of Jesus Christ that could be the last one we're looking for but we've got to do our work and go out there and just seow seed and and those that are will come maybe you say well I'm not seeing a lot of fruits right now well there's not a lot left but there will be somebody that'll come come and this bride will go in a Rapture can you say Amen we do believe in a rapture we do believe in Awakening of the Bride but she's got to be ready for the Rapture how's he going to come for sleeping bride he's going to come for somebody who is awake and has recognized the hour that she's living in he will not catch you asleep but somebody's going to be working somebody's going to be out doing something somebody's going to be preaching the gospel when it comes for you can you say amen he said everywhere now there's no Revival he said we're not tooo they say we're not too late yet why do they do that why do they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that there will be an Awakening they're good people why is it why have they what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride good people men who were sitting in the message men who were hearing a prophet preach and they had not recognized The Awakening can you say Amen they had not recognized The Awakening of the Bride but listen that's because there's got to be something in you to rec recognize it when it comes across your path the fact that you're here tonight is not by chance it's not because your family's here it's because God chose you and put you in this very spot here tonight God did not listen God did not put you in Luther's age for a reason he did not put you in Wesley's age for a reason he didn't put you in the 1906 Pentecostal age for a reason but there would come a bride age there would come a bride time there would become an Awakening somebody had to be ready for the message of the power to turn their hearts back God knew he couldn't come God knew he couldn't send that messenger in in the other ages why because there was nobody to accept the message in that age but he had to come a little bit of light at a time and it's kind of like witnessing to people sometimes you can't give them everything it once you got to give him a little bit and a little bit more and and listen brother Brandon when he came he had to do the same thing had to be a first pull had to be a second pull and then would come the third pole opening of the word he had to get your attention to wake you up little bride before he could say come out of her come out of those denominational systems get away from those walls get ready it's Rapture time he had to wake you up he had to catch your attention and then you had to be awoken by the word can you say amen amen they fail to recognize now the awake the The Awakening of the Bride the bride's Revival it happens when the true church the bride begins to line up for the word of her age can you say Amen so she's not not just lining up to a part of the word because then that would be just like the first Eve did well I've accepted of the goodness of God I've been in the Garden of Eden I've seen all these great things I've done all the listen I've seen the I've seen God he maybe she she saw all kinds of creation maybe Adam was over there speaking things into existence for her and she saw the spoken word she saw the sign in the hand well come on somebody she saw all the Mysteries and she saw that this Prophet was going to come and everything but she missed him when she come because she disbel one word and this Pride cannot do that same thing why because she was not she was not promised to fall but it was promised there she would not fall and so when the word comes and he says stay in line with the word she doesn't fall by disbelieving one word but she lines up to the word of the hour can you say Amen so when a prophet says it this brid will say Amen to it oh that flesh May fight you listen I'm not talking about flesh conversion here tonight I'm talking about something beyond that flesh I'm talking about something behind that flesh that flesh will do all kinds of well come on somebody that flesh will fail you every day that flesh will come against you that flesh will do things that you never dreamed it could do but God saw you in spite of the flesh you're carrying around he saw you when you were so low down you couldn't sit in the house of God he saw you when you were so low down oh come on somebody maybe nobody else has been there but I've been there I've been in a place where I couldn't have sit in church because my heart condemned me so bad I've been in a a place where there was no way I could sit and enjoy the presence of God but thanks be to God tonight I can stand here I was a sinner but I've been saved by the grace of God I've been called for the message of the hour I'm not looking for another message I'm not looking for another Awakening I'm not looking for another Revival I'm in the Revival it has called me it has changed me how do I know it's not just an emotion an emotion cannot change your life an emotion cannot make you act different oh it can make you act a little crazy when you're in the food but listen it will not hold you outside of the church walls but the word will hold you when the emotion is not there no longer when it feels like on Monday morning you can't even get up and go no farther the word still works brother Joe when it feels like you can't preach another sermon the word still works there's got to be some young men brother matth that's going to take this message and keep it on until the coming of the Lord the word still works when you've lost a loved one the word still works amen yes sir because just because they didn't go in the Rapture with us remember they're already going to be up waiting for us oh come on somebody just because you've lost love oh I wish they went the Rapture they're going to rise first and then we're going to be caught up with our loved ones to meet him in the air the word still works you telling me anything else is going to call us from the graves except for the word itself no it is the word it is the very word that has been spoken it is the voice that is in you last time I was here I believe I dealt with it on the voice of authority listen that is in you when you speak the devil trembles when you speak all hell shakes why because you have a voice of authority because you are the Bride of Jesus Christ and he already knows you know the devil already knows that you can't fall the devil already knows it he's going to do everything he can to stop you but he knows you can't fall away oh he might think he's got you when you fall down he might think he got you when you backslid that one time he might think he got you when you were serving the devil out there in the bar stool but he didn't have you why because God knew all the time Brother David you're one of mine you can't be lost God knew it all the time in spite of my Humanity he saw a seat of God and called me bride well can you say Amen in spite of me he called me Bride In Spite of me when I deserved everything he took when I deserved and I deserved every beating he took I deserved every bruise I deserved the spear I deserve the crown but I get guess what he gave me he gave me a home in heaven why because he saw who you had the potential to be even when you weren't nothing at all well can you say Amen it's a cycle of Revival and death it's a cycle the world goes through this the world you'll see a church grow and then they that that's just part of that's just part of what we go through you'll see churches grow grow and then they they seem to go through dips and you you you'll have a great service and then the Devil comes in and everybody's in a bad mood and you got to fight through it and then you finally break open you're like well we could have had this for the last two hours if we' had just come in prayed up in the right Spirit no but the devil fought you all the way to church but see that's just a Revival here Among Us that's just having a good time in church but the word held you when you didn't feel like shouting the word held you when you felt like backsliding the word held you well come on somebody the word held you when you wanted to lash out at that person you work with well praise the Lord I've been there brother Joe you ever been there I I've been there listen there's some bad people you're going to rub shoulders with there's some people that don't even care about God and they'll laugh at the way you dress and they'll laugh at the way you talk and they'll laugh at who you are but God didn't laugh at you he put his favor on you and called you bride so when the world's laughing you're going to be caught up I don't want to say we got the last laugh cuz that sounds kind of arrogant but I wanted to say this I wish they'd all go with me but I'm going anyway I'm going on with Jesus I don't care if it's just me and Jesus but I believe if you're sitting in a church tonight that is preaching the message of the hour then I want to just go ahead and tell you something has on the inside of you that has put you here and I believe tonight that every person in here why would I believe anything different every person in here I believe you to be a part of this bride I would not hold condemnation over this church I am not here to preach you out of the Bride I'm here to tell you wake up little prde this is your Revival if you can accept this end time Revival if you can accept this end time message then I say there's something on the inside of you you may not even realize who you are but God already saw who you were well the mark he saw you when you didn't have a dime to your name and he said you know what you're my bride he doesn't go by status or money he doesn't go by who your family was listen we got to break those Cycles every once in a while your daddy may have been a bad person your mom may have been a bad person your grandparents may have been bad people but God has called somebody who's going to break that cycle and be called Bride Can you say Amen brother R goes on down here and he says Now history keeps repeating itself in the generation of Israel we see Revival in one generation only to see the fires fade in the next in the third generation Embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestage whatsoever of that original flame and then God lights the fire again aren't you glad he did it for you when it looked like you were going to be the one to finally burn out in that cycle and God went ahead and just put a whole new flame in you can you say amen he said then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated it is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth any more than there is any truth to the apostolic succession it isn't in the word like that you start out with truth truly Born Again Believers and when the next Generation comes along they're no longer just plain Christians but they they have taken a denominational name and now Baptist Methodist Etc that is exactly what they are too they're not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together now by the will of man I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute do I say that but the original fire has died down you won't find hardly any fire in a Lutheran church today even though at one time that was the church on fire I I was around the Westland Methodist growing up the Westlands were good people and I remember being in their meetings and in their camps and and they had a little bit of fire left and if you go there today there's nothing left there's no word hardly left and they'll fight you on on trinitarian I mean they they're just so trinitarian and they could never see they could never see the the the Jesus name baptism they could never come to the Pentecostal age and they would actually go against it and and call it all kinds of evil names and they're the ones that would call them holy rollers and things and these were shouters these were people that didn't look dead but they didn't denied the move of God can you say amen and so when you're around that you realize that then the next Generation comes along there's nothing to hold them but I'd like to go ahead and say that I've seen some people in this message where the grandparents might have been dead it's 12:00 and I've seen the kids find a Revival why because a prophet said every generation will get their chance at the word every generation is going to have their Revival every generation is not going to go back and just let the fires burn out but every generation needs to have a word revival can you say Amen so when the young people are sitting there and you say well what about the young people don't worry about them young people if they're sitting here in the house of God I'd say that's the best place for them why because this is the place where they can hear the opening of the word and the word can cause Revival in the hearts of our young people well can you say Amen I'm not here to just preach another Baptist Doctrine or another Methodist Doctrine but I'm here to say God is got a people who are going to believe every word that he spoke everything that he said in this Bible everything that the messenger would come all those loose ends we're going to believe every word of it can you say Amen I'm not here to add something to the message I'm here to Proclaim that I'm going to say what a messenger said I'm not here to start a new doctrine of the Thunders I'm not here to tell you there's going to be a tent and there's going to be a return and when that happens then you can be saved no your Revival is on right now I don't say there ain't some good people that believe like that but I got to tell you something they failed to recognize the Awakening of the Bride but to you who have not failed to see it you you are in Revival that's why you can go to some message churches and you wonder are they message they're so dead you can't say Amen well can you say Amen I'm not for that at all I think that's just trying to take the people right back into a well I might as well say it you all are okay you all ain't like that so I can just be free here listen there's some Churches you can't get an amen out of them you can say you can say every every every catchphrase in the message every quote that just makes you just stir up you could get in there and you could find all the quotes that makes the people shout a little bit and you could just really be like I'm just going to get these people hyped up you can't move them if there's nothing on the inside to move them you can preach your best message brother Joe and if there's nothing on the inside there's no quickening power can you say Amen but what this word does it actually meets well come on somebody it actually meets with the seed on the inside and that seed when it hears the word of God it's just like that Lily in the mud it may be in the mud it may not even see the light yet but it's growing anyway because there's a Revival that is moving it up to maturity and full light can you say Amen so that's not what we're doing we're not over here trying to say well we need to work everybody no that's not it if if the word is preached and you can sit there dead is 12:00 that's on you well can you say amen amen because when the word is preached there's something on the inside of the Bride that will respond to it I'm not talking about everybody responding the same way I watched people sit there in a service and they just cry and maybe brother Joe that I've watched them sit there and they and maybe they just be you could just see God working on their lives and they never said a word I'm not talking about somebody has to be the loudest shouter in the church I'm not talking about that at all but there needs to be a moving on the inside there needs to be a growing on the inside and then what you really know it by is when you watch them out there in the world you'll watch what the word did in church you'll watch what the word did when they said down and started listening to tapes again you'll watch what the word did when they picked up that bible and took the dust off of it and started reading it again you'll see a life behind it it won't just be a shout but it will be a change on the inside that will start showing on the outside or try to keep them people quiet one time when you recognize your day in its message try to keep them people quiet why because theyve recognized that we're not dead any longer but we are in a bride's revival can you say Amen we're not over here wondering what's going to happen how big is this tent going to be well I hope I'm okay here tonight if I'm stepping on your toes I guess well you probably wouldn't be here in this church if you believe like that that's right so we'll just say it anyway but if you don't don't let that doctor never come in here don't let that doctor ever get a hold of you some people try to listen just believe the word of God just believe the message of the hour stay with what a prophet said just believe that the third pole is on for the bride why because he said it's the opening of the word he said the Thunder already preached he said well come on somebody and if they've already if they were there if they were there and they were preaching them themselves and he could look back and say the reason that the other groups were not catching it because they failed to uh to see The Awakening then I would like to just go ahead and say to you if they were dead because they couldn't see the Awakening then we are alive because of the Awakening then we are we are woke up we are no longer dead listen that the bride in the beginning was in Adam the whole time but she had to be created she had to be woke up as long as she was just a part as long as she was just in Adam there was nothing that she could do there was nothing she couldn't even be a help me to him she could she had no voice she had no body but when God actually would take her out of the Flesh of Adam and make that bride then she could actually have full Authority on Earth just like he did what can you say man she was him brother bam said bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she was a full part of him now what about the bride today he what about well come on somebody what about the bride now if you have seen who you are in the scriptures then brother brandom said when you recognize who you are then we'll be gone I think it's time the bride recognizes that you're not just another church that you're not just another having a good time Pentecostal bunch of people but you are a word bride that is coming in line with the word and the Rapture is upon us yes sir the Rapture is upon us I I I know I know people's looking for more but we're not looking for Nothing But The Rapture brother Ram said I don't see nothing recognizing your day in this message he said I don't see nothing left as a Christian but the coming of the Lord I want to say tonight look up little bride your Redemption draweth nigh it's not something you got to go get prepped for and you got to have another evangelist in for your pastor don't have to preach a certain message at a certain time but what the what what the pastor is going to do is stand there and preach message after message because that word will touch somebody's heart and cause them to take another step closer to a body change when brother Mark's in the Pulpit or one of these other ministers were in the Pulpit listen they're just standing here trying to portray to you trying to give the message to you that has already called you to be restored back and so when the message is preached it has to do what it was intended to do can you say Amen this word was not called to kill you but the word was called to restore you the word was come the word came so that you wouldn't have to die out like another denomination but it came to have a living bride with a living word at a time of rapture can you say Amen so this bride is now ready can you say Amen well where's the rest of them at I don't know but any day now brother Joe it could be in the morning it could be tonight it could be any day now you say well we got a different president the Lord ain't coming oh be careful with that that's a trap of the devil that's a trap of the devil you say well you say well listen well I don't know what you think about politics but I'm just going to tell you just because you think all people peace everything's great watch it that's when destruction comes on the earth and the bride will not be here in the destruction well can you say am man he said the bride wouldn't stay through that listen there may be more who knows the world's going to get worse and worse you say well the squeeze is coming I say the squeeze is on for the bride well can you say Amen the squeez is on go out of here and you see they laugh at a young lady going to school with long hair and a skirt on but they won't laugh at the person that calls themselves a cat you think this world's not crazy it's crazy but the bride is just coming together they realize how crazy this world really is and when you see the destruction you see the Revival over and you realize there's only one place left of safety that's in the message of the hour we're not looking for another denomination for a place of safety I've got to get a little farther here brother Joe before I run out of time brother Ram said that cycle of Revival has never failed can you say amen amen he said all you have to do is recall the last move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed like Christians went to church prayed all night took the street corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit they left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes their old store buildings maybe a barn out here in the middle on a gravel road but what they did they would leave those big old listen you can go to a nice fancy Church in downtown whatever downtown you got around here we don't have none in Hardy that's very fancy but you could go to a big morg and worship and you could go down there and they might play the goodness of God better than you've ever heard it and they might sing they might out sing every one of the people in this building just on Talon alone probably not probably not mad anyway but they could go down there and they would have the best dressed choirs brother Ram talks about it the best dressed choirs the the matching robes and they could even get up there and raise their hands and no doubt you might feel an anointing in that church might on a good day you might but when you come here you may not listen you may be you may Worship in a barn you may get in a tent it's not about it's not about the place that you're worshiping in it's about the person that's sitting here because there's a Revival on the inside of you that they don't even know about well can you say Amen there's a Revival on the inside of you that if there was no other Church to go to and all you could do was Stand Down on the street corner and beat an old tambourine and witness about the message of the hour you would be found faithful doing that why because the message is on the inside of you and you can't hide the light of the hour somebody's going to somebody's going to shine this light to the world somebody's going to be a glow in a dark world and there's people out there I still believe there's people out here that are looking for light but we haven't found them yet but I believe when it's their time when they can accept the message of the hour the message will cross their path because God will not lose one of his so if you got children out there don't you worry about them claim them under the message of the hour if you've got a spouse out there claim them under the message of the hour if you've got family members out there that have not seen this message claim them under this message and say I'm not going to lose a one of them because I'm in the land of promise and everything is mine can you say Amen we're not looking for another Revival that will make our family come back the Revival's here and the family's coming in I'll tell you what I believe tonight brother M when you see family out there and they're drifting and you're like well Lord what's going on it don't listen just have faith for them believe for them because you've got a promise of your children I know they still have to come in I know they still have to accept this message but I have a I have a belief in my heart that there's something going to bring them in before the time of rapture I believe it's going to happen any day if the Rapture is scheduled to happen tomorrow then my lost relatives are somehow going to be ready tonight can you say Amen we're not looking for something else to get our family ready the message is here to get your family ready the message is here to call out those sleeping Saints the message is here the voice of the Resurrection is here all we have to do is participate in this bride's Revival just believe that whatever is in your heart believe that the reason that that you're sitting here tonight may be because your family needed you to have the faith for them when they just couldn't have faith for themselves somebody's got to be ready to fulfill the word of your hour and if brother Brandon would say that you just have to have the same faith for your salvation and have that same faith for your children then I just have to believe that there's a reason he would say that to build somebody's faith when their family just didn't look like they were ever going to come in listen I've seen men and you know some of them brother Matt some of us have standing here you you've seen men that have went out there and they've went into the world and they've done all kinds of unspeakable things but they're preaching the gospel tonight many of them are pastors of churches why because it was the message working in the hearts of the person even when they were out there on the bar stool even when they were out there listen I tell you what there's going to be a lot of people that they're going to be there that you didn't think would make it well come on somebody because all the time we're over here with our measuring sticks listen I believe in Holiness I sure do but I believe it's got to be something on the inside or you can have a whole bunch of people dressed like Holiness Christians that hadn't got an ounce of God in them but if there's something on the inside of you it'll change you and it'll make you to where nobody can talk talk you out of that nobody can talk you into it but something on the inside of you has a staying power can you say Amen about halfway through stay with me for just a few minutes brother Joe I tell you I know it's Wednesday night and I'm always I'm always scared I'm going to lose them when they get tired and well I I'm trying I'm trying let's just stay with her here just for a few minutes when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival praise the Lord for that when she begins to have a Revival and begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God watch then again you see how that the scriptures at that time there will be a message sweep out to catch that bride catch that woman elect can you say amen he said for as the world Satan the deceiver who deceived the first bride to sinning against God by misbelieving his word and now today as we see the church natural in your intellectual gospel listen intellectual gospel is not going to save you it might make you think you're good for a while or maybe think you're saved for a while but there's got to be more than an intellectual gospel or that's never going to take you out of here but he said they're going going further and further away from the word in Social Gospel we find that the women of the world on the streets members and such is carrying themselves in the same atmosphere you can't tell them apart they've lost all sense of common decency the people have see and that's the way the church has and you can see it going straight to the ecumenical council just as certain as anything and right as into Rome as hard as it can go see because it's prophesied and there she is that's her behavior but then watch again the spiritual church how that that group of people called out the elected through every Revival now he names them off he says in the Lutheran Revival and the wesleyian Revival and the Pentecost first started they Dro them women right back in line with the word and then they drift away and there she goes right back over into the chaos but then the time come that the people are ready to line up I hope you hear this now there's a people ready to line up there is a message comes forth and they line with it I'm lining up with it not because I have to but because I want to not because the preacher told me that I wasn't dressing good but I heard of prophet voice and I come to the house of God and I'm lining up with the message I may not understand why but I know that I'm in this revival and I'm going to stay in this revival by lining up with the word of God I cannot fall away can't fall away can you say amen he said but then watch out he said that every Revival was that way he said that they called out the elector every Revival and he talks about them and then he said then the time the people are ready they line up with the message now he goes on down here and he says now friends go back with me there's the F where's the first Revival come a after death is when the days of the grain of wheat had fallen to the ground the body and the bride the bride of Christ he said where did it come from where was the first Revival Christ he said is that right his church he never organized it he just said Apostles and Prophets and so forth in the church to keep it clean but at ni sea of Rome 306 years later they organized it and made an organization out of it is that right and it died now brother brandom talks about the the the death has always caused by a denomination are you still with me and he says everything he said that didn't agree with that church was put to death and it laid still for hundreds of years in the dirt but after a while up she come in Luther and the first little sprigs of corn come up the second it budded out from there and went into swingley and so forth and the other organizations and so forth and after a while he said Here Comes the Anglican church and here come Wesley and with a new Revival and he said it looks a little more like wheat and then what happened to that it organized and dried up and died and the life went right into a Chu and the shut come forth almost perfectly like the wheat but finally its Folly was made manifest can you say amen and he said in the last day in the last eight or 10 years especially in the last three years now what does it do pull away from the wheat now why hasn't there been an organization start up in these last 20 years of this great Revival it now we can go back and say 60 plus years 70 years now this revival has not organized now he says why he says why is it not started up he said it's anointed prophets anointed teachers and so forth but why ain't it there there's nothing Beyond The Grain see it's back without an organization he said oh my blind man could see that it cannot organized can you say Amen it's so firmly against it it's the grain of wheat itself the son of man will be made manifest the grain of wheat will come back to itself again the son of man in the last days and there will come false impersonations of it in the last days it'll almost somebody say almost deceive the of very elected it's not possible aren't you thankful for that he said but it would almost he would be so close it would almost deceive him and he goes on down he said now notice the anointed prophets will be false and and and and there among it will be true anointed he said how you going to tell it by the word can you say Amen by the word like we have it in Shadow do you see it and he said the congregation says amen and he said now notice the anointed ones only the word will separate them not the signs well can you say Amen there'll be signs that listen there look back in in Pharaoh there when Moses was standing there as Janice and jambers and they could do almost everything Moses could do but listen there's got to be something there's got to be a word that came with the sign it's got to be more than just the sign but there's got to be a voice behind it there's got to be a word to wake up the people somebody had to call the people out of Egypt it had to be the word of a Vindicated Prophet not just people that could make God look good or say well look at our gods look what we can do no that's not what we're looking for we're not following the signs we're following the word and the signs will follow us can you say amen he said it's not the signs no they'll do the same signs but the words what separated them sure they all prophesied they all done this listen and I actually take comfort from this scripture because that doesn't mean we won't prophesy and they will we will too well can you say man if we're doing all the same thing then he didn't say we're going to be sitting there and the prophecy listen well come on somebody I don't believe everything that was restored to the church listen I believe in order I believe in church order but everything that was restored to the church is is still here we didn't have to do away with it but our Focus has turned to the word can you say Amen so we don't Focus maybe on a uh listen somebody standing up and and speaking in tongues although I believe in the tongues but listen you know that's not the preeminence there's a reason why there's a reason why that the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophets why because when a preacher standing in the Pulpit that that's not because the preacher has the preeminence but the word which is Christ has the preeminence it's not me that stands up here and says well because I'm standing here every every body else is no that's not it at all brother Matt don't stand up here as a dictator and say well if I'm up here yall sit down and be quiet no sir but he believes in order because a prophet taught the order in the church so what he's telling you is this I believe everything a prophet said and if it's in order then it's lined up with the word then God can use it I hope that's okay I know I'm not at home but sometimes I feel like I am if that's okay y'all just make me feel comfortable and I appreciate it I really really do and I won't abuse that tonight with a long sermon but but he you're like it's already too late but Jesus said they'll do the same things but the word is what separated them now Mark 16 I want you we all know this Mark 16 uh Mark 16:15 and he said to them go you on all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature that's a commission can you say amen and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved can you say Amen but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it will not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we all know that to be true but remember the signs are following the believer so we are following the word and if we're following the word the signs will be there when we need the signs healing is there for you when you need your healing Revival's here when you need Revival but what you got to do is follow the word don't follow the next great move but follow the move that is on for the bride it is the word Revival that is the move that's on for the bride brother Brandon would say it here I've got the quote I'll get to it shortly he said It reminds me of a story I love this quote brother Joe this is one of not one of my favorites because I've told you that a couple times tonight probably already but he said he was talking about the great Welsh Revival and I love this because he's talking about this he said they were they were going out through the nation the Welsh Revival he said what would be taking place they went over to find these people went over to find out and they seen this building it was to see the building that was being held in when they got to Wales they went around and began to ask about where the building was and they seen a happy little officer standing on the corner with his little Tommy hat on I just want to emphasize the word happy this man had been in Revival and he was happy this man was even on the job and he was happy he was at work and he was happy that's a real revival can you say I tell you what sometimes it's hard to be happy at work but this man had been in such a great Revival that he's standing there and and he's swinging his Club around and around like that and these men walk up to him and said sir could you tell me what building the Welsh Revival is held in he said sir I'm it oh come on somebody you say where's this bride Revival happening you're looking at it where is this bride Revival happening it's not just in Black Rock Arkansas it's not just in Hardy Arkansas but it's wherever the Bride of Jesus Christan you are the bride's Revival the bride is feasting on the word of God for this day we've grown up like calvs in the stone we've ate on the Mana from heaven we are she we have become the very body of Jesus Christ we're more than able to take our promises today we're more than able to call those things just like the first Adam did why because we have been restored back not just to 1906 but all the way back to where this first Eve would be restored again and she will not fall the second Eve will not fall why because the first Eve God saw it and he knew that there would be death that would come a Revival would come and death would come look like a garden of En look like a perfect Revival but that Revival had to Die Why why because of a a misbelieving one word but then when this second Eve would come she says Lord whatever you have for me whatever words you have spoken over my family whatever word you're going to speak to me I believe it and I stand on it nothing can take me out of this bride nothing can stop me from believing the word of this day why because I didn't go looking for the message the message found me I didn't go looking when I was a teenager I was raised in some pretty crazy stuff not to be too open about about it but there was some pretty crazy stuff in our household there was some pretty crazy doctrines went on we didn't believe in a rapture we didn't believe in any of these things and I'm just going to go ahead and tell you like this when I when I got out of that I thought I was in a mess I went out looking for another group I thought there's got to be something more for me and I went and I went to a United Pentecostal Church as a teenage boy and I sat in there and they preached on the evidence the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost being speaking in tongues I had heard too much word to sit there I had already heard a prophet say that it was not the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost and he backed it up with scripture and I'm sitting there thinking what am I doing here when I've got the message of the hour when it's literally telling me that what they're preaching is false and he backed it up with the Bible why would I leave the word to come into this chicken pin well come on somebody just because it looks good just because they got bigger churches and they got better dressed members and more money in the headquarters let me goe and tell you something this bride it don't matter how poor she gets it don't matter how small she gets she is an invincible Army she is raised up by the word of God and she will not fall so you might as well just quit trying to put her out quit trying to put the flame out quit trying to say we ain't got no more Revival oh stop with that nonsense and say I am the Revival I am what God has promised for this day brother the Joe he raised you for a Time such as this because every trial you go through he knew you could handle it for the matter everything the reason put you here was not because maybe you say well I wasn't the most qualified let me go and tell you something he needed a man who was going to stand for the word no matter what anybody else would say about him he needed a church that would say I don't care if there's two or three of us here we're going to stand as a mighty Invincible Army I don't care what the world calls us I don't care what the other churches call us I don't care what the so-called message call me I am the Bride of Jesus Christ somebody might as well go ahead and just take their stand and say I am she I am an invisible Army I am the prde of Christ nothing can take me out you didn't put me in it you can't take me out of it he saw me before the foundation of the world well I'm not saying that to brag it's all about him he's the one that did it it's all about the blood it's all about his power his power raised me to where I am his power is going to raise me up on that Resurrection morning his power is going to take us in a Rapture I'm not looking for another Jesus I'm not looking for another word Prophet it's already came and it called out a bride you are the living body of Jesus Christ today what he did you're going to do what he said you're going to say the way he said to live is how you're going to line up to it why because this is a word Revival don't you tell me that it's okay to be dead and quiet in church because I'm going to goad and tell you something if the word has come into you you will be stimulated by the Revelation that has come in your day I'm not talking about a workup I'm talking about a word that will affect the people I'm talking about the word that will move on the hearts of the people a word will call you from the dead sins and trespasses and it will bring you into the Glorious L of the message of the hour this word still works can you say Amen this is the word that's alive all other words that are denominated are dead cold religions but this word this word Works can you say amen I tell you I just I just feel it on my heart tonight to say if you're doubting this message listen don't you go look at them stupid YouTube videos and things that are trying to say that the message is false go ask them where their life is at come they ain't got no life in it but they're they look over here and it's the same people in the days of Jesus would crucify him because how he didn't vindicate the scriptures when he Vindicated them to a te and today you'll see our Prophet that has come and Vindicated his message around the world seven times and you'll see not one time that the Vindication would fail and yet you'll have the naysayers and you'll have the people that say well Moses you're You're Nobody you can't take the people over and you'll have people say well Joshua the Giants are too big for us we got all kinds of people saying the message won't work but I say it will work this message is good enough for me it's good enough for you it's good enough to call you from the grave it's good enough to raise up the dead in your life it's good enough to make a living church here in Black Rock Arkansas brother Joe it's good enough to keep us from the world again it's big enough for me why because it's not a messenger it's the word that came and that is Christ that is coming to the heart of the believer we have been made one with him can you say Amen well I tell you I just I'm about out of time but can I just go a little farther is that okay just a few minutes I just want to drive this home that you are a part of that bride now brother Brandon would say here and I just want to get to this he said the move is on for the bride some of you people that really believe that this is to be the truth that we're entering another age we're entering into the raptured age oh I love is he said you know the church can't go in its condition and it can't get any better so if you're looking for the churches out there to get better and ready for a Rapture you're looking at the wrong place on but what we're looking for is not the church but the bride and so he said now we're entering the rap the church can't go on this condition how many knows that he says amen he said it's got to get worse and it can't go like this see it's got to be something and it's moving right now can you say amen he said friend it's on the move is on for to the bride and I love this he said that's thus sayith the Lord somebody ought to say Amen to that thus sayith the Lord the move is on for the rde that was in 1965 one of the last messages he would preach listen why would he say that because he didn't want you the people he came to to call out of those denominations to be in the same cycle of death as the other churches were he wanted you to recognize the Awakening of the bride and realize this is your age this is bride time this is time to go ahead and Shout over Revelation this is time to shout about more than just a gift but it's time to go ahead and Shout about the giver himself coming down and calling you from the dead sin and trespasses and making you into this glorious gospel listen there is a bride and there's a body of Jesus Christ on this Earth and you are that body you say well where's the literal Corporal body at brother Ram said he's coming and Believers believe that that's exactly what he said he said Believers believe that but listen he had to he never would leave the Earth without a witness so he had to have someone here that would make up the Earthly body of Jesus Christ you are she can you say Amen brother brandom says it like this and I'm going to close on this one he said God and I want you to just if this if any of this applies to you I want you to put your hand up in the air God created me a Revival let me be the Revival Let each one of us be the Revival the Revival in me make me Lord to hunger make me to thirst created me Lord that what is needed in me let me from this hour on be thine more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more humble more kind more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things that are in the past and the negatives let me press towards the mark of the High Calling of Christ I say that's my prayer tonight church let me quit looking to what I was let I wish somebody just stand their feet and say praise the Lord right now if you have been called from the world and its condition This Is Your Night to stand up and say I am the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm not going to go down with the Flames of the world but I'm going to be caught up in that meeting in the air I am the bride body on the earth now we don't have to look around and say there's something else coming to call me up no The Voice has already come the voice of the Resurrection is in you the word is in you you have become the word just like Eve was a part of Adam you are a part of the second Adam and and you cannot fall somebody say I can't fall I'll go ahead and tell the devil I can't fall musicians go ahead and come you don't have to worry about anything because the word already said I can't fall I may make mistakes and you can point to every one of my mistakes and I can go ahead and point you to a promise that I can't fall away you can say well brother Joel you've done this I tell you what I wouldn't want my whole life to be put up on a screen in front of a church neither would you neither would you but after the blood covered if you could look through his eyes it'd be a blank slate nothing left what sins are you talking about amen he don't even remember them no more he don't even have a name for him now why because he can't even find them no more what sins are we talking about what sins can you bring up listen the sins are under the blood this bride has been washed this BL this bride has been cleansed this bride is ready for for a Rapture you say there's still problems yeah humanity is still here you're still in a human flesh but that body ain't going in a Rapture the body ain't going I hope you're hearing me tonight I know we got to live right act right do right we do that because we love the Lord but that body is not converted brother brandom says that he teaches us the body the flesh part is not converted and why does the devil fight your mind because that mind will set there and every evil thought that can come on a man's mind will come on your mind every evil thing that can come into a man's mind that's where the that's the Devil's Ground that's where he fights you and you only keep that under subjection by the word but there's something on the inside of the Bride that is much more than just a mental conception of an idea that a message came there's something on the inside of the Bride that is more than just another good time in a Pentecostal church but there's something way down deep in the soul of a man or a woman and they they can't even help themselves because inside of them they believe even when their mind tells them to doubt can you say Amen when you felt like giving up something held on to you when you felt like backsliding something wouldn't let you go out when you felt like you had to give up because you just couldn't take another step something was holding you can you say amen and I say it's nothing less than God himself in the heart of the Believers that is holding you until your day of redemption can you say Amen if you believe that you're part of his bride tonight don't you let the devil come tomorrow and tell you well am I am I really yes you are the fact that you're here brother brand talks about footsteps meaning possession I know I'm over time about about 5 minutes over but listen the word of God has come in such a way in such a powerful way in this age that it didn't come to low you to sleep like the lead of sins but it come to wake you up and when you find yourself start getting a little cold on God I say come back to the house of God again when you don't feel like going to church that's the time you need to be in church when you don't feel like worshiping Praise Him Anyway when the chains that seem to bind you are holding on to you praise your way out of those chains go ahead and say God has put me here for such a time as this I'm an overcomer I I am called to be the Bride of Jesus Christ nothing can stop this move of God because thus sayith the Lord the move is on for the bride the bride's Revival is here we're awake now we see the Mysteries but we don't listen we may not understand every mistreat but they've been open to us everything you have need of has been open to you can you say Amen with your heads bowed if there's a need on your heart tonight we'd be happy to pray with you if you got something on your heart you can even slip your hand up to the Lord say Lord I know who I am but the devil's fought me hard this week you know I'd like to just give you some comfort and saying the devil the devil knows he's just a bluff but he don't know that you know that yet so sometimes we got to remind the devil Satan you're just a bluff Satan you're just a scarecrow you can't come after me you can't come against this move of God because this move of God that I'm a part of and I'm participating in cannot be stopped can you say Amen with your heads bowed and your eyes closed like I said if you have a need we're happy to pray with you but just pour your heart out to the Lord right there if you listen if you feel bound tonight just worship your way out of that bondage if you feel that the devil is trying to hold you back from participating in the bride's Revival just go ahead and throw them hands up and say devil you ain't got no hold on this bride go ahead and tell that devil Satan you're a liar and you can't stand here why because that commission to cast cast out Devils is going to follow the believer and if you're a Believer here tonight you have the authority to tell that devil to go back to hell where he came from he has no hold on this bride the death cycle has been broken we're a living bride with a living Revival heavenly father as you see these people here tonight you see every need you see every person every hand you know every heart Lord I may not know the needs in this building but your word has touched hearts here tonight and Lord by the power that you have given in this age to the ministry and by the power that you have sent by the word of God the Vindicated prophet of this day I pronounce the Devils to flee from this building tonight I call for Satan to leave the minds of the people right now that they can worship God freely in the house of God I call Lord for families to be restored here tonight not by something I would say not by a man's opinion but because the word has called for those things to be restored in this hour Lord we believe for tonight we are giving everything to you here we're saying we thank you Lord for bringing us here we thank you for calling us from the dead deadness that we were in we thank you that we're not a denomination but we are a living bride today we thank you Lord we give you praise here in the house of God tonight Holy Spirit fall on this place and give us a refreshing and a renewing in our minds that we can go out of this place saying I am in the brid's Revival where's the Revival in your area Lord let us go say I am the bride's Revival I am the Revival let me just work in this field until the time of your coming and just be bold with the word of God and say this is your bride that is
