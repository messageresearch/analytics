[1:01:00] 9th
[1:01:05] chapter and we'll begin
[1:01:07] reading uh from verse
[1:01:16] 17 just a real honor to preach uh with
[1:01:21] these brothers and brother Andrew
[1:01:23] brother Wayne Brother David silers just
[1:01:26] really looking forward to uh the sermon
[1:01:29] in the morning know we're going to be
[1:01:31] greatly
[1:01:33] blessed Mark the 9th chapter and
[1:01:38] uh beginning at verse
[1:01:40] 17 and one of the multitude answered and
[1:01:44] said
[1:01:45] master I have brought unto thee my son
[1:01:49] which hath a dumb spirit and wheresoever
[1:01:53] he taketh him he tear him and he foth
[1:01:58] and nashthe and pineth away and I spake
[1:02:02] to thy disciples that they should cast
[1:02:04] him out and they could not he anth him
[1:02:08] and said oh faithless
[1:02:11] generation how long shall I be with you
[1:02:14] how long shall I suffer you bring him
[1:02:17] unto me and they brought him unto him
[1:02:21] and when he saw him straightway the
[1:02:24] spirit tear him and he fell on the
[1:02:26] ground and wallowed foaming and he asked
[1:02:30] his father how long is it ago since this
[1:02:33] came unto him and he said of a child and
[1:02:37] of times it hath cast him into the fire
[1:02:40] and into the waters to destroy him but
[1:02:43] if thou cast do anything have compassion
[1:02:47] on us and help us now notice the father
[1:02:51] is saying if thou cast do anything have
[1:02:55] compassion on us and help us but notice
[1:02:58] Jesus response Jesus said unto him if
[1:03:02] thou can believe so he's saying if thou
[1:03:06] can't do anything but Jesus is putting
[1:03:08] it back on in in his lap and saying if
[1:03:13] thou C believe all things are possible
[1:03:17] to him that believeth straight way the
[1:03:21] father of the child cried out and said
[1:03:23] with tears Lord I believe believe help
[1:03:27] thou mine
[1:03:28] unbelief now Mark the 11th
[1:03:32] chapter and we're just read from verse
[1:03:36] 22 down to verse
[1:03:40] 26 and Jesus answering saith unto him
[1:03:44] have faith in God or as the pro the
[1:03:47] prophet would give us the correct
[1:03:49] interpretation of that and say or have
[1:03:52] the faith of God for verily I say unto
[1:03:55] you that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:03:59] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:04:03] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:04:06] his heart but shall believe that those
[1:04:09] things which he saith shall come to pass
[1:04:12] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:04:15] therefore I say unto you what things
[1:04:18] soever ye desire When you pray believe
[1:04:21] that you receive them and you shall have
[1:04:24] them and when you stand praying forgive
[1:04:27] if you have ought against any that your
[1:04:30] father also which is in heaven May
[1:04:32] forgive you your trespasses but if you
[1:04:35] do not forgive neither will your father
[1:04:37] which is in heaven forgive your
[1:04:41] trespasses may God add His blessings to
[1:04:43] the reading of the word you may have
[1:04:45] your seats but I'd like to just take for
[1:04:49] a uh thought challenged by the message
[1:04:52] of the hour and uh God has always always
[1:04:56] revealed his care for his children God
[1:05:00] is very concerned about you and I and he
[1:05:04] has sent the best thing that he could do
[1:05:07] to uh to provide uh help for us and to
[1:05:11] manifest his care for us and that is his
[1:05:15] word we find there in Psalms 107 and
[1:05:19] verse 20 he sent his word and healed
[1:05:22] them and delivered them from the their
[1:05:26] destructions and David goes on and says
[1:05:29] oh that men would praise the Lord for
[1:05:32] his goodness and for his wonderful Works
[1:05:35] to the children of men and let them
[1:05:37] sacrifice the sacrifices of Thanksgiving
[1:05:41] and declare his works with rejoicing so
[1:05:44] the prophet would describe the age that
[1:05:48] we live in as a word age or the word age
[1:05:52] and so God has given us the very best
[1:05:56] thing that he could give us in this in
[1:05:59] this evening time and that is his word
[1:06:02] and it is for our healing it is for our
[1:06:05] deliverance it is for our joy it's and
[1:06:09] it's for our homes it's for the
[1:06:12] individual lives it's for marriages it's
[1:06:14] for and it's for our counseling it's for
[1:06:18] re reproof rebuke whatever we have need
[1:06:21] of is found in the word of God and and
[1:06:25] should produce a joy in our hearts it
[1:06:27] should produce a praise in our hearts
[1:06:30] because we have found the answer we have
[1:06:33] found what our soul has been longing for
[1:06:37] we see that when God came down in human
[1:06:40] flesh to manifest his care for us it
[1:06:43] says that he he went about healing all
[1:06:46] that were oppressed of the devil and and
[1:06:50] we find that uh he find he came
[1:06:54] preaching that this is is the Year of
[1:06:56] Jubilee he came to say that the
[1:07:00] anointing is upon me and and I've come
[1:07:03] to preach Deliverance to those that are
[1:07:05] captive and and to loose those that are
[1:07:08] in bondage and and and you see that is
[1:07:12] what the word made manifest does the
[1:07:16] word when it is made manifest it always
[1:07:19] brings Deliverance it always sets those
[1:07:24] that are in captivity those that are in
[1:07:27] prison houses it opens the doors and it
[1:07:30] and it brings you out of bondage into
[1:07:34] the Glorious Liberty of the sons of God
[1:07:37] we find that the word for every age has
[1:07:41] brought a challenge to the believer and
[1:07:44] that is simply if thou can't believe we
[1:07:48] find that the prophet would say that
[1:07:50] God's only provided plan for any age is
[1:07:55] his word so I I don't care how many
[1:07:58] substitutes I don't care how much we try
[1:08:00] to add to God's program but it's still
[1:08:04] the same today that the only plan for
[1:08:08] God Amen for his sons is the word of God
[1:08:12] we find that Paul said that Faith cometh
[1:08:15] by hearing hearing the word of God the
[1:08:19] prophet would answer the question of
[1:08:21] what is Faith well faith is something
[1:08:25] that's Reve to you that is not yet but
[1:08:28] you believe it will be faith is a
[1:08:32] revelation of the will of God so by
[1:08:36] Revelation amen the prophet again would
[1:08:39] say faith is a revelation from God he
[1:08:42] would say he has revealed it to you by
[1:08:46] his grace now now catch this he's
[1:08:48] revealed it to you by his grace it's
[1:08:52] nothing you did you didn't work yourself
[1:08:55] up into Faith you ever have faith it's
[1:08:59] GI to you by the grace of God and God
[1:09:02] reveals it to you therefore faith is a
[1:09:05] revelation and the whole Church of God
[1:09:09] is built upon the Revelation amen then
[1:09:13] we find that the Gates of Hell will
[1:09:16] never Prevail over that
[1:09:19] Revelation because it is a faith it is
[1:09:24] something that is an absolute in your
[1:09:26] heart and it's unmovable it's unshakable
[1:09:30] it is something that it's only give by
[1:09:34] the grace of God God's grace to you is
[1:09:38] Faith is a revelation now we find that
[1:09:42] the prophet would say I want you to get
[1:09:45] built up now in the Holy Oracles of God
[1:09:50] in the faith the faith of this hour the
[1:09:53] faith it's going to take more faith than
[1:09:56] ever was any age for this has to be
[1:10:00] rapturing Faith to be taken up amen so
[1:10:04] we see that it is God that is going to
[1:10:07] give us a revelation that is for the
[1:10:11] Rapture amen this is God's grace that is
[1:10:15] given to the Church of the Living God
[1:10:18] and that is a faith a translating Faith
[1:10:22] a body changing Faith a faith that can
[1:10:25] take you from Mortal to immortality from
[1:10:28] corruption to incorruption can take you
[1:10:31] from a world that is falling apart that
[1:10:35] you don't know how you're going to make
[1:10:36] it you don't know how you're going to
[1:10:38] get to the next day but this is a
[1:10:41] revelation that God has given the Church
[1:10:44] of the Living God that when all hell
[1:10:48] this sells this church when all hell is
[1:10:51] trying to torment your mind and trying
[1:10:54] to weaken your resolve and try to shake
[1:10:57] your families this is a revelation uh
[1:11:00] that you can stabilize your hearts
[1:11:03] stabilize your homes and look upward uh
[1:11:07] because God is coming for a bride that
[1:11:10] has a
[1:11:12] faith you see Peter would say it like
[1:11:15] this amen wherefore GT up the loins of
[1:11:18] your mind and be sober yes sir and hope
[1:11:21] to the end or have an expectation
[1:11:25] look to the end for the grace that is to
[1:11:29] be brought unto you at the
[1:11:31] revelation of Jesus Christ amen so this
[1:11:35] must be the same thing that Jesus was
[1:11:38] talking about when he said as it was in
[1:11:41] the days of Noah so shall it be in the
[1:11:43] revealing of the son of man as it was in
[1:11:46] the days of lot so shall it be in the
[1:11:49] revealing of the son of man and so Peter
[1:11:52] is showing that when the son of man is
[1:11:55] is revealed there is going to be a Grace
[1:11:58] that is given to the church amen you see
[1:12:02] amen when the world is coming to its end
[1:12:06] when the systems of the world is coming
[1:12:09] to its end when the politics of the
[1:12:11] nations are corrupt and the world has
[1:12:15] just went into insanity but yet look to
[1:12:19] the end for when in the evening time
[1:12:22] there shall be light there shall be a
[1:12:26] revelation there shall be an anointing
[1:12:30] that'll sweep over the church that will
[1:12:32] give a Grace it's something that you
[1:12:35] didn't earn it's something that you
[1:12:37] didn't work up to it's not something
[1:12:40] that you are good enough uh but it's an
[1:12:43] election it's a people that's been
[1:12:46] called out for his name Sak because you
[1:12:50] are his chosen elect lady and he's
[1:12:53] brought a sweep of Grace
[1:12:55] over your
[1:12:57] life you see amen Jesus would take us as
[1:13:02] it was in the days of lot amen sodomy
[1:13:07] filth but yet there is an elect on the
[1:13:11] backside of the desert with a
[1:13:14] promise there is a if I could put it
[1:13:17] this way a Son of God that has been
[1:13:20] fellowshipping with God around a promise
[1:13:24] oh oh how the devil tried to disturb him
[1:13:27] and distract him and try to discourage
[1:13:29] him from that promise amen he could look
[1:13:31] at the weakness of his own body he can
[1:13:34] look at the deadness of Sarah's womb he
[1:13:37] can look at the grumbling of the
[1:13:38] complaining and all the bickering and
[1:13:40] all the problems Satan trying to
[1:13:44] discourage him from what was coming down
[1:13:46] that road but I'll tell you what was
[1:13:48] coming down that road Grace was coming
[1:13:50] down that road it was a revelation that
[1:13:54] Elohim was made flesh uh and he was
[1:13:57] going to appear to Abraham uh and say I
[1:14:00] remember my promise uh oh Church aren't
[1:14:03] you glad that in the evening time uh God
[1:14:06] has appeared to us H and said I remember
[1:14:09] my promise uh I remember that I'm going
[1:14:12] to have a bride with that spot with that
[1:14:15] wrinkle with that blemish uh I remember
[1:14:18] that I said I'm going to restore all
[1:14:22] things and I'm going to restore the
[1:14:24] garden of Eden I'm going to restore
[1:14:27] sunship I'm going to restore you back to
[1:14:31] manifested sons of
[1:14:33] God Amen yes sir oh yes sir we got
[1:14:37] something to Fellowship
[1:14:42] around oh yes sir when the Elohim was
[1:14:46] revealed oh it changed
[1:14:49] things the word being revealed through a
[1:14:54] prophet is God's grace to the
[1:14:57] church the
[1:14:59] Revelation released favor upon your life
[1:15:03] and it was something that you didn't
[1:15:04] Merit it's
[1:15:05] unmerited
[1:15:07] undeserving favor of
[1:15:10] God oh praise the name of the Lord I
[1:15:14] think of that woman of ill Fame amen
[1:15:17] just a just a prostitute but you see
[1:15:20] Jesus was invited to to simeon's place
[1:15:24] and they just wanted to make a mockery
[1:15:26] of him amen they they they called him be
[1:15:30] El we heard about it last night and
[1:15:33] there he is sitting in the corner with
[1:15:35] dirty feet but you see to this woman of
[1:15:38] ill Fame just a prostitute amen
[1:15:43] undeserving nothing good about her life
[1:15:46] that anyone would look at her and say my
[1:15:48] she's worthy of Grace she's worthy of
[1:15:51] God's love there is nothing good about
[1:15:53] her but you see there was something
[1:15:56] about election there was a seed that was
[1:15:59] placed within her soul before the
[1:16:01] foundation of the world and it was
[1:16:03] placed there by predestination uh and a
[1:16:07] revelation uh came into her heart all
[1:16:10] the sudden something swept over her and
[1:16:13] she said my that must be the Messiah
[1:16:16] amen and she began amen she begin to
[1:16:20] take some oil and buy with her o with
[1:16:22] her money and and we know the story
[1:16:25] and how she must have snuck through and
[1:16:28] she ends up before Jesus and she begins
[1:16:31] to wash Jesus feet with her tears and
[1:16:35] and dry his feet with her hair and
[1:16:37] everyone is just in just gawking at her
[1:16:41] and looking at the scene and criticizing
[1:16:45] in their heart amen but it was Jesus
[1:16:48] that say Simeon where much is given
[1:16:51] there or where much is forgiven much is
[1:16:55] is loved oh yes her grace Came Upon her
[1:17:00] life and he said I forgive
[1:17:04] you I don't condemn you I am not judging
[1:17:09] you but I am forgiving you amen I tell
[1:17:13] you friends at the revelation of who is
[1:17:17] in our midst it is Jesus Christ it is
[1:17:22] God himself uh that is heal
[1:17:25] tabernacling in human flesh again in
[1:17:29] momies and daddies and boys and girls
[1:17:32] there's a Grace that God has placed
[1:17:35] within
[1:17:36] [Applause]
[1:17:38] us if we could only
[1:17:41] realize is the prophet of God now the
[1:17:43] presence of God
[1:17:47] unrecognized if we could only realize
[1:17:50] that he is appearing to us in these
[1:17:52] meetings for one purpose
[1:17:55] that's to release our desires that we
[1:17:57] have in him to
[1:17:59] us how many can say you've got some
[1:18:02] desires but we've got to recognize his
[1:18:06] presence and now how you recognize his
[1:18:09] presence is when the promised word of
[1:18:12] this age is made manifest not the
[1:18:15] promised word of Moses age or any other
[1:18:18] of the other age is the promise of the
[1:18:20] word for this age you see when a man
[1:18:25] once catches that vision of the
[1:18:27] invisible God and know that he's always
[1:18:31] present there is something that
[1:18:33] stabilizes that man's thinking it
[1:18:37] stabilizes his actions and in the time
[1:18:40] of distress and trouble it'll still make
[1:18:44] him look upward and above the things
[1:18:46] that are happening around him because
[1:18:49] he's looking at the Unseen yet by
[1:18:52] promise so what is the vision of the
[1:18:55] invisible God it is the promised word of
[1:18:59] this age made manifest that's how you
[1:19:03] see God you see his character you see
[1:19:07] that he's unchanging you see that he is
[1:19:10] the same I am that I am and his word has
[1:19:14] been made visible it's been made plain
[1:19:16] it's been made clear it is not something
[1:19:19] that we're just we're just uh guessing
[1:19:22] at in the Bible but you see the word
[1:19:24] word the correct interpretation of the
[1:19:28] scripture has been made visible we are
[1:19:31] not guessing at it we're not trying to
[1:19:33] probe at it we now have a Vindicated
[1:19:37] message we have seen God the same word
[1:19:41] that was made manifest 2,000 years ago
[1:19:44] now made visible among ush and they
[1:19:47] crucified him then and they crucified
[1:19:50] him today but it had to be that the
[1:19:54] bloody bleeding word could come into a
[1:19:56] full ofth that there would be an
[1:19:59] atonement uh to wash away our unbelief
[1:20:02] uh to call us out of all of the Dead
[1:20:06] traditions of
[1:20:07] Leia that we could believe the word and
[1:20:11] see this word made manifest in our
[1:20:15] [Applause]
[1:20:18] lives praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:20:21] you see the Bible says that when the
[1:20:24] headstone
[1:20:25] we see The Headstone coming appearing we
[1:20:29] cry Grace Grace unto it the prophet of
[1:20:32] God would say now in this last age we
[1:20:35] have come back to the Capstone
[1:20:37] Revelation the most important revelation
[1:20:39] of godhead is the whole Bible that is
[1:20:43] Jesus Is God he and the father are one
[1:20:47] there is one God and his name is the
[1:20:50] Lord Jesus Christ and he is the god of
[1:20:54] the amen
[1:20:55] and he never changes what he does never
[1:20:59] changes he says it and it stands fast
[1:21:03] and there is some people that are saying
[1:21:07] Amen to it that are going to prove to
[1:21:10] Satan that we are not like the first Eve
[1:21:13] but there is another Eve that has come
[1:21:15] up in the last days that says Amen to
[1:21:18] the word I am the god that Health all
[1:21:21] thy diseases Amen to the word I am the
[1:21:24] god God that has given you a token by
[1:21:26] that same token you can lift it up with
[1:21:29] your unwavering faith and claim your
[1:21:31] children you can apply it to your home

[1:21:39] amen I am your joy I am your deliverance
[1:21:43] I am your counselor I am the I am I am
[1:21:46] the promised word in Moses day I am the
[1:21:49] promised word in Noah's day I am the
[1:21:52] promised word in Jesus day and I am the
[1:21:54] promised word in the last days that is
[1:21:58] giv Grace to wipe away all unbelief uh
[1:22:01] de clear all the filthiness of that
[1:22:05] Harlot system that held you bound but
[1:22:08] now we're free to believe the
[1:22:12] word to whom the son the word has set
[1:22:16] free made us free we're free

[1:22:21] indeed you see you got to look right
[1:22:24] it's how you look at it we heard about
[1:22:27] that it's all about your perception
[1:22:30] Hallelujah you see they took a picture
[1:22:34] of what happened on Sunset Mountain but
[1:22:37] they had it all
[1:22:38] wrong come on even the
[1:22:42] prophet wasn't looking at it just
[1:22:45] right everyone else was looking at the
[1:22:48] picture and didn't have it just right
[1:22:51] but you see it took the angel of the
[1:22:52] Lord to say you got turn it the right
[1:22:55] way well I thought that I had it the
[1:22:58] right way no you got to turn it right
[1:23:02] and when he turned it right the
[1:23:04] perception completely changed it was
[1:23:08] Jesus
[1:23:10] Christ seven angels that had the face of
[1:23:14] Jesus Christ showing that at the opening
[1:23:18] of the word you are looking into the re
[1:23:20] revelation of the face of Jesus Christ
[1:23:25] I tell you friends the prophet of God in
[1:23:27] alone us now he's looking to his right
[1:23:31] just as Jesus on the cross looked to his
[1:23:35] right and gave a pardon to that Thief
[1:23:39] Hallelujah I'm telling you friends you
[1:23:42] are looking at your pardon at the

[1:24:02] Christ Hallelujah you got to look at it
[1:24:06] right you got to look at it the way he
[1:24:08] sees you you got to stop looking at your

[1:24:13] mistakes you got to stop looking at the

[1:25:15] grace of God that is keeping you
[1:25:19] stabilizing you keeping you from from
[1:25:22] being blown away by many Winds of

[1:26:43] that would be cast out of the blessings
[1:26:46] of God but he has not beheld iniquity in
[1:26:49] Jacob why because there is an atonement
[1:26:54] there is a there is a Brazen serpent a
[1:26:58] smitten Rock and the Shad of the king is
[1:27:00] in the camp what a revelation has broke

[1:28:56] try but it's
[1:28:58] erased it's gone not turned aside we
[1:29:03] have through pardon we are
[1:29:05] released not by psychology we're not
[1:29:09] released by a Creed we're not released

[1:31:13] grace and others are completely Reliant
[1:31:16] upon works and trying to work their way
[1:31:18] into just a good old mule religion but
[1:31:22] you see the prophet of God said we are
[1:31:24] not of that mule religion we are not
[1:31:28] ignorant we've been called out of
[1:31:30] ignorance and we've been come into the

[1:32:01] because we were chosen in him before the
[1:32:03] foundation of the world and Paul said we
[1:32:05] are
[1:32:06] predestinated unto the adoption of
[1:32:10] children and the fullness of our
[1:32:12] adoption is the body change therefore we

[1:37:04] the stronghold the strongholds of hell
[1:37:07] he went down into Hell in a in in a
[1:37:10] theop body and took the keys of death
[1:37:14] hell and he rose up
[1:37:18] Victorious what is this message to the
[1:37:20] church because I live you live because I
[1:37:24] overcome you overcome because I am
[1:37:27] righteous you are righteous then through
[1:37:30] the opening of the word we have received
[1:37:33] a prevailing Revelation that by this
[1:37:36] revelation of the finished work of
[1:37:39] Calvary we can defeat Satan's lies
[1:37:43] defeat Satan's lies those lies that he
[1:37:46] been telling you you'll never be free
[1:37:49] you'll never have joy you'll never have
[1:37:51] love you'll never make the Forever The
[1:37:54] Rapture you got to take this prevailing
[1:37:57] Revelation and defeat the Devil by
[1:38:01] it well I don't feel strong you got to
[1:38:05] change your witness change your
[1:38:06] testimony for we overcome by the blood
[1:38:09] of the lamb and the
[1:38:14] word of Our
[1:38:17] Testimony you see he knew he knew that
[1:38:21] you were going to face the same
[1:38:22] Temptation that he face in the
[1:38:25] wilderness if thou be the Son of God how
[1:38:28] many has ever heard that
[1:38:30] [Music]
[1:38:31] one the devil keeps trying to keeps
[1:38:34] trying to tell you if thou be the bride
[1:38:36] do some trick prove
[1:38:39] it and then he tries to bring you
[1:38:41] through your family tree and and try to
[1:38:43] say how can you how can you be an
[1:38:47] overcomer and then he tries to bring you
[1:38:50] back a year ago and and and and a month
[1:38:53] ago
[1:38:54] even
[1:38:56] yesterday even maybe just a couple hours
[1:39:01] ago and he's over and over saying if
[1:39:05] thou be the Son of God if thou be the
[1:39:07] bride of Christ if you really are the
[1:39:10] elect
[1:39:11] lady and under the Temptation Of The
[1:39:15] Devil Satan stood he wasn't being he
[1:39:19] wasn't being tossed
[1:39:20] about but Satan but Jesus his position
[1:39:24] he understood who he was and he stood
[1:39:26] there and defeated the Devil by the word
[1:39:27] of
[1:39:28] God no anointing he was hungry that's
[1:39:32] right he didn't maybe even feel like a
[1:39:34] Son of God at the
[1:39:38] moment you see the reason that God sent
[1:39:41] a prophet in this age and so manifested
[1:39:45] his glory and his power through that
[1:39:48] redeemed
[1:39:50] vessel to let you know
[1:39:54] that the power of Calvary
[1:39:58] works that over and over he told us that
[1:40:02] his daddy was an
[1:40:04] alcoholic he took us through his family
[1:40:07] treat he took us through how he had a
[1:40:10] temper and and The Temper was so bad
[1:40:12] that he was going to kill a six or seven
[1:40:18] boys but God so took that vessel
[1:40:24] not some human power not some human
[1:40:27] Superman but a redeemed Son of God that
[1:40:32] God could wave over the church and say
[1:40:36] there's many more
[1:40:38] coming I'm going to have a bride that's
[1:40:41] surrendering themselves to this
[1:40:44] Revelation there isn't going to be any
[1:40:46] unbelief hinder them there's not going
[1:40:48] to be anything that can stop him they're
[1:40:51] going to be an invincible Army because
[1:40:54] they realize Satan is trying to defeat
[1:40:59] the power of God in their lives through
[1:41:01] his
[1:41:02] lies so you resist those lies if Jesus
[1:41:06] defeated Satan upon the faith knowing
[1:41:09] who he was and he was a predestinated
[1:41:11] creature are you ready what about the
[1:41:13] predestinated Bride of Jesus Christ now
[1:41:16] you believe the bride is predestinated
[1:41:18] the predestinated bride of Christ now
[1:41:21] the church the word seed with everything
[1:41:23] that God promised to put in the church
[1:41:25] in it right now it's in it now
[1:41:29] everything is in order the Holy Spirit
[1:41:33] has been
[1:41:35] given therefore when Revelation the
[1:41:37] fourth chapter come about and we see
[1:41:40] that the angel is saying come up higher
[1:41:44] John hallelujah what is it John's a type
[1:41:47] of the bride and he's telling this bride
[1:41:50] you got to come up higher oh yeah yeah
[1:41:53] amen uh Lea is blind wretched miserable
[1:41:58] they've rejected me they kicked me out
[1:42:00] of the church age but PR but but little
[1:42:02] bride I'm going to call you
[1:42:05] out and I'm going to unite you around
[1:42:08] the headship of this word and this
[1:42:11] message is going to rule your life it's
[1:42:13] going to control your thinking it's
[1:42:16] going to govern your
[1:42:18] emotions oh sometimes your emotions get
[1:42:20] so haywired but there is head
[1:42:23] that in your heart is the word of God
[1:42:26] that brings that under subjection and
[1:42:28] says I am a Son of God I am the
[1:42:31] righteousness of God in Christ Jesus
[1:42:33] Hallelujah you see the word didn't come
[1:42:35] to push you down how many realizes that
[1:42:39] the word didn't come to push you down
[1:42:41] the word didn't come to beat you up the
[1:42:44] word didn't come to condemn your life
[1:42:46] the word came to Pardon you and lift you
[1:42:51] up for David said I was in a myy pit but
[1:42:56] God rich in Mercy got me
[1:43:00] out I was born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:43:05] under some denominational lie but God
[1:43:09] cared for me and sent a revelation and
[1:43:12] broke the stronghold of hell and
[1:43:15] stabilized my
[1:43:17] life it's an
[1:43:20] absolute you see you're being lifted up
[1:43:24] by the
[1:43:26] word you see the prophet of God says we
[1:43:28] have followed the
[1:43:30] advancement of the
[1:43:32] Gospel from glory to glory right he says
[1:43:36] it's Advanced from justification
[1:43:38] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:41] Ghost the person of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:43] himself the
[1:43:45] word you see what it's done is it's
[1:43:49] brought us to the advancement of the
[1:43:53] church that there's nothing greater than
[1:43:55] the word right and we have grown up to
[1:43:59] the headship of the word then what's in
[1:44:02] the head is the
[1:44:04] [Applause]
[1:44:05] intelligence so God has advanced us into
[1:44:08] the intelligence that we can see who we
[1:44:12] are we can see what God's doing we can
[1:44:17] see that it's greater is he that is in
[1:44:21] me than he that is in this
[1:44:24] World we're not forsaken we're not
[1:44:27] rejected we are not cast aways but we
[1:44:31] have surrendered to the intelligence of
[1:44:36] Elohim your name's in
[1:44:39] there your peace your security it's in
[1:44:43] there therefore it's what you surrender
[1:44:46] yourself
[1:44:48] too the prophet of God says it's not me
[1:44:51] it's not me it's not me the seventh
[1:44:53] angel It's Christ as the son of man and
[1:44:57] I've only surrendered myself to
[1:45:01] him friends the only way that we have
[1:45:04] power to overcome the power to get out
[1:45:06] of this world is it's what we surrender
[1:45:09] ourselves
[1:45:11] to people are surrendering themselves to
[1:45:14] Hollywood Spirits surrendering
[1:45:16] themselves to political Spirits
[1:45:18] surrendering themselves to all kinds of
[1:45:20] influences all kinds of sess that are
[1:45:23] trying to rob them of their time Rob
[1:45:26] them of their energy Rob them of their
[1:45:28] mind but there's got to be a bride
[1:45:31] there's a people in the last days that
[1:45:33] has come into the intelligence of this
[1:45:36] revealed word and it's stabilizing
[1:45:41] us why would that's why Paul said think
[1:45:44] on these things what was he doing he was
[1:45:46] referring to what he what they were
[1:45:48] seeing in his own
[1:45:50] Ministry think on these things
[1:45:53] pure holy blameless the things that
[1:45:57] you've seen in me that's what Paul was
[1:45:59] saying and that's what Paul was
[1:46:02] referring to I'm an absolute to you I'm
[1:46:05] something that's going to stabilize you
[1:46:08] that we're not under law we're under
[1:46:11] grace we're not under Works we're not
[1:46:14] under something that we're trying to
[1:46:16] struggle and barely get by but he says I
[1:46:19] challenge you to get those things out of
[1:46:20] your mind and get your mind Center it
[1:46:23] upon
[1:46:24] Christ Center it upon the atonement
[1:46:27] Center it upon what God has given us in
[1:46:29] this
[1:46:31] hour you see you got to have the right
[1:46:34] attitude though the prophet of God
[1:46:36] talking about what happened on Mount on
[1:46:38] on on Sunset mountain and those seven
[1:46:41] angels He says what is it the quickening
[1:46:44] power coming to to the church making her
[1:46:46] ready this hour that we're approaching
[1:46:49] quickening power oh God help us to
[1:46:51] receive it help us to it see it just
[1:46:54] depends on what attitude you take to it
[1:46:56] whether it's going to do you any good or
[1:46:58] not though you have to believe that you
[1:47:01] don't believe it it won't do you one bit

[1:49:07] depends on our
[1:49:09] attitude the prophet of God would say in
[1:49:11] perfect
[1:49:12] Faith he says I just want to see how
[1:49:14] advanced my church is all right or what
[1:49:17] we believe in see just how advanced the
[1:49:20] people are how they're ready to take the
[1:49:23] sword and walk out on the front line now
[1:49:27] he's always talks about a preacher he
[1:49:30] says someone that's been trained by
[1:49:32] psychology and trained by some Creed or
[1:49:34] some Dogma they're not in the front
[1:49:36] lines oh yeah they're the guy that's in
[1:49:39] the back
[1:49:41] somewhere he said but someone who knows
[1:49:44] how to hold that two-handed that
[1:49:46] two-handed sword and go out in the front
[1:49:48] line and start whacking
[1:49:50] Devils see demons of Oppression taken
[1:49:53] off of your
[1:49:54] life see depression leave
[1:49:57] you see someone who's losing their mind
[1:50:00] come back into the right mind again not
[1:50:03] someone who's timid with it not someone
[1:50:06] who's worried about it but not ashamed
[1:50:09] not ashamed of the message of the hour
[1:50:12] not ashamed to press it out there and
[1:50:14] say there is no cancer demon that can
[1:50:16] stand before the two-edged sword of the
[1:50:19] word there is no depression devil that

[1:58:22] just that's all they can do that's as
[1:58:24] far as they can go but there's a Grace
[1:58:26] there's a revelation that is just
[1:58:27] brooding over our hearts it's ripening
[1:58:30] us under the son of man Ministry it's
[1:58:33] the same Jesus the Same power the same
[1:58:36] anointing it's the same Christ Living in
[1:58:40] you and there's something in you that
[1:58:42] when you want to quit you can't
[1:58:45] quit something when you get knocked down
[1:58:48] and you're listening to the referee
[1:58:50] saying one 2 3 something gets down to S
[1:58:54] and you're just thinking you know it's
[1:58:55] nice and comfortable down here maybe

[1:59:12] is that devil where is he I'm going to
[1:59:15] knock his ears off amen there's a faith
[1:59:19] there's a revelation there's an
[1:59:20] anointing upon my life I've been
[1:59:23] anointed of the Holy Ghost to cast out
[1:59:26] Devils I've been anointed of the Holy
[1:59:29] Ghost to see families restored I'm
[1:59:31] anointed of the Holy Ghost to preach
[1:59:34] Deliverance to the captives and see
[1:59:36] Faith rise
[1:59:39] up see people realize they've been
[1:59:43] pardoned see Joy be
[1:59:47] restored I'm quitting with this
[1:59:50] one you see the prophet of of God would
[1:59:52] say that when you know these
[1:59:57] things then there's a responsibility
[1:59:59] that comes with it that's right right
[2:00:03] and he said it's within man to Sherk or
[2:00:07] sidestep
[2:00:09] responsibility that's right the prophet
[2:00:11] of God and a man running from the
[2:00:12] presence of the Lord he would say that
[2:00:14] he says it's it's just in man to Sherk
[2:00:17] his responsibility he says a man take a
[2:00:19] wife he's got a responsibility as a
[2:00:22] husband to her responsibility to provide
[2:00:25] a
[2:00:25] living and and and and and a home and
[2:00:28] all of these different things and you
[2:00:30] see the prophet of God would show us
[2:00:31] that we've got a responsibility to the
[2:00:34] word that's right now I'm I'm I'm
[2:00:38] quitting with this if you could just I'm
[2:00:40] sorry if I've read too much tonight
[2:00:43] but the prophet of God would say how
[2:00:45] wishy washy that's why too many
[2:00:48] Christians today are so soft soaked in
[2:00:50] everything right until they think all
[2:00:53] they do is join a church go in somewhere
[2:00:55] put their name on a book or do a little
[2:00:57] something jump up and down shout or
[2:00:59] something like that and call it
[2:01:01] Christianity
[2:01:03] Christianity is a everyday rugged
[2:01:08] life living for God in this present
[2:01:12] [Applause]
[2:01:14] world listen now it's a constant say
[2:01:18] constant constant burning of the fire
[2:01:22] and love of God in the heart that set
[2:01:25] you a fire and put you out yonder with
[2:01:28] the people and making converts to Christ
[2:01:33] responsibilities but it's easy to go the
[2:01:36] way the world goes it's easy to flow
[2:01:39] down the stream go out there and sit
[2:01:42] down in the river with your boat you get
[2:01:44] your ores and start pulling up against
[2:01:46] the current you don't make much time and
[2:01:48] it goes hard but you just want let loose
[2:01:52] the ores and watch how fast you pass the
[2:01:54] trees going down but look where you're
[2:01:57] going when things are floating easy
[2:02:00] remember you're going towards a great
[2:02:02] cataract down there of some sort you're
[2:02:04] going towards the falls and it won't be
[2:02:06] long you'll be going over that falls
[2:02:09] just floating with the world easy the
[2:02:12] way it goes you don't want that no sir
[2:02:15] but you must accept your
[2:02:18] responsibility now you believe it you
[2:02:20] think it's the truth and the
[2:02:23] responsibility that God has given us in
[2:02:25] this day to bring this message and as I
[2:02:28] get older and I know my days are
[2:02:29] shortening up I feel the responsibility
[2:02:31] greater than ever I ever felt pressing
[2:02:34] on we must do it we must get down to it
[2:02:40] in everywhere we go and tell the message
[2:02:43] and tell the people that Jesus Christ is
[2:02:46] coming that he's God and he's coming
[2:02:48] soon he's not a there's not a hope left
[2:02:51] in the world but the coming of the
[2:02:54] Lord you see we got a responsibility to
[2:02:57] believe this we've got a responsibility
[2:03:00] to
[2:03:01] press That's why Paul said I forget
[2:03:04] everything that is behind me but I press
[2:03:07] toward the mark of the high calling in
[2:03:09] Christ Jesus you see the prophet of God
[2:03:12] would give us a little example he says a
[2:03:14] brother would come to him and and say
[2:03:17] you know it says of a of a preacher that
[2:03:21] that a a pastor tells congregation do
[2:03:25] you think that I could roll this
[2:03:27] wheelbarrow across this log and they say
[2:03:29] oh yes pastor we believe you can do it
[2:03:32] pastor does it and comes back says do
[2:03:34] you believe that I can put you know this
[2:03:37] log on it and do it yes pastor we we've
[2:03:40] got all confidence in you you you you
[2:03:43] you you can do it and then they said you
[2:03:46] know the Lord is with you
[2:03:48] Pastor how many Pastor how many of us
[2:03:50] pastors oh you got it
[2:03:53] yeah your faith can do
[2:03:57] anything then the Pastor said but I can
[2:03:59] put you in the whe bear and pack the law
[2:04:02] says wait now wait a
[2:04:05] minute it's
[2:04:07] different when you're included in it
[2:04:11] yourself now that's that now that it's
[2:04:14] mighty good for us to say here
[2:04:17] amen it's mighty good for us to say I
[2:04:19] believe that it's the truth but but then
[2:04:22] put it in action you got to put it in
[2:04:27] action yes sir it's one thing to say yes
[2:04:30] I believe I'm healed amen amen amen but
[2:04:33] you see it's your works that testify of
[2:04:37] your
[2:04:39] faith the way that everyone else sees
[2:04:42] that you're a Believer is how you
[2:04:44] respond to the word through your
[2:04:49] actions you see you've got a part to
[2:04:52] play the ministry of the Bride is
[2:04:55] Minister the word to the king
[2:04:58] manifesting his promised word in the age
[2:05:01] that she's living in you know that's the
[2:05:03] harsh desire is
[2:05:05] Lord I want to manifest to every one of
[2:05:08] your
[2:05:09] promises as the musicians
[2:05:11] come you see the prophet of God would
[2:05:14] say he would talk
[2:05:16] about uh Paul
[2:05:19] Raider and he would give us that example
[2:05:21] of how that he couldn't move that log
[2:05:24] and of course brother brother Paul was
[2:05:27] sick that was symbolic of his
[2:05:31] sickness and he couldn't move
[2:05:33] it and then he says he heard a
[2:05:37] voice as he says just roll it in the
[2:05:40] Stream and just ride it down
[2:05:44] river amen you see it was the voice of
[2:05:48] his boss but when he looked it was the
[2:05:50] Lord Jesus yeah
[2:05:52] oh God I'm so glad that the Lord Jesus
[2:05:55] is our
[2:05:57] boss that we don't when we don't know
[2:06:00] how to move things in our
[2:06:02] life and it could be whatever maybe it's
[2:06:04] a sickness maybe it's maybe it's a
[2:06:06] stubborn
[2:06:08] Spirit maybe it's just something that
[2:06:10] it's just you've been prayed for and
[2:06:12] prayed for and prayed for and just and
[2:06:15] and and it looks like there's just no
[2:06:17] hope yeah but you see the prophet of God
[2:06:20] is showing us he's he's he's revealing a
[2:06:24] secret
[2:06:25] here that what you got to do is you just
[2:06:27] got to roll it on over into the water
[2:06:32] you see there's a water of life there's
[2:06:34] a moving of the Holy Ghost that is
[2:06:37] coming right through this place right
[2:06:40] now and then Paul he jumped on the log
[2:06:44] and as he's jumping on it and he's
[2:06:46] crying out I'm riding on it I'm riding
[2:06:49] on it and when he come into it
[2:06:52] right mind he says he was in the middle
[2:06:54] of the floor and he's crying I'm riding
[2:06:56] on it I'm riding on it and he was
[2:06:58] healed something that looked like he was
[2:07:01] going to take him to his grave he's now
[2:07:04] completely healed because God gave him
[2:07:08] the
[2:07:09] remedy the prophet of God would say you
[2:07:12] know he says I'm riding on the message
[2:07:16] of the
[2:07:17] hour yeah did you catch it I'm riding on
[2:07:22] the message of the hour hope to the end
[2:07:26] for the grace that is given at the
[2:07:29] revelation of Jesus Christ the Capstone
[2:07:33] Revelation is this the same God the same
[2:07:37] yesterday today and forever and if he
[2:07:41] healed one back then upon the basis of
[2:07:44] faith in his word he'll do it

[3:08:58] tonight don't want to foret the brothers
[3:09:01] helping out set up the tent and setting

[3:09:08] unrewarded it's all rewarded so I
[3:09:11] appreciate these brothers and appreciate
[3:09:13] our brothers back there running the
[3:09:14] sound and trying to get all that right
[3:09:17] that's hard to do in a tent different
[3:09:19] humidity and weather and bodies of
[3:09:21] people and heat on and heat off and and
[3:09:24] so it's it's kind of hard to do and so
[3:09:26] we appreciate them most the time you
[3:09:28] don't even know you have sound people
[3:09:29] until something's wrong if everything's
