[34:06] somebody say God is wonderful amen we
[34:09] just certainly appreciate the Lord
[34:11] tonight we want to remember in prayer
[34:13] sister Lillian asked for prayer not
[34:15] feeling well also for Leah Scott asking
[34:19] for prayer uh she had had some um uh
[34:23] some complications with her neck surgery
[34:26] that she had I believe that that I know
[34:28] she's had it twice and maybe a third
[34:30] time already but uh the doctors are
[34:33] looking at what they have to do going
[34:35] forward and uh so she's been in a lot of
[34:37] pain just ask the church to remember her
[34:39] in prayer I know that you know sometimes
[34:41] when you don't even but John said the
[34:44] doctor kind of looked at the situation
[34:46] said I really don't even know what to do
[34:48] at this point you know looking at the
[34:50] x-rays and MRIs and the way things had
[34:52] had been and and uh so they were just
[34:54] praying I know she has to go back to the
[34:56] doctor in a few days uh praying that the
[34:58] doctor or the the Lord would give that
[35:00] doctor some wisdom on how to handle this
[35:03] I believe that God is able I I don't I'm
[35:05] not going to settle for a lady in her uh
[35:08] early 30s uh to to be Liv in pain the
[35:11] rest of her life and all that so I
[35:13] believe we as have a right as a body of
[35:15] Believers uh to call upon on the Lord on
[35:17] on her behalf and ask the Lord to touch
[35:19] her body and and continue to move in
[35:22] that situation so maybe we'll just bow
[35:23] our heads tonight if you have a need on
[35:25] your heart just lift your hand to the
[35:27] Lord and and ask him to come and just
[35:29] prepare for the word of God tonight

[44:47] I believe every church service could be

[44:50] Revival whether it's shouting screaming
[44:53] dancing or just the simple the word
[44:55] coming forth and and ministering to your
[44:58] hearts and changing your life changing
[45:01] situations and uh I believe that's what
[45:03] it's about the gospel is able to change
[45:05] lives and and uh when uh Matt and I was
[45:09] visiting about uh over five years ago we
[45:12] was ministering in his house and we was
[45:15] talking about some visions and that was
[45:17] our vision that was our goal you know to
[45:19] to to further the gospel when souls to
[45:22] the kingdom of God and here we are and
[45:25] and the Lord's been blessed and great
[45:27] Tabernacle amen what a beautiful meeting
[45:29] we had and people gathering around from
[45:32] all kinds of places and then and joining
[45:34] our LS of fire together I I think we're
[45:37] blessed people tonight amen we want to
[45:41] look tonight just for a few moments
[45:43] tonight on anointed for victory and I
[45:46] was looking through some of the things
[45:48] brother Brandon was saying on on the the
[45:50] anointed and of course he takes you many
[45:54] times a messiah is the anointed had one
[45:57] and that all that was in God was imorph
[46:00] or emptied out into his son Jesus Christ
[46:04] all that God was was emptied out in his
[46:06] son and all that Jesus was was emptied
[46:10] out in a many member bride and and he
[46:13] was the anointed one he was a god power
[46:15] he had a he had God Authority he had
[46:18] everywhere he went he was blessed
[46:21] everywhere uh Christ went he
[46:24] conquered amen why because he was
[46:27] anointed for the age that he was living
[46:30] in he was anointed with a god anointing
[46:32] and God power and now brother Brown
[46:34] would say it like this he was the
[46:36] anointed one he was the Messiah he said
[46:39] but now we're dealing with messes our
[46:42] little messiah's anointed brother Brown
[46:45] said with the same spirit and we realize
[46:48] he talk he takes you back to to if that
[46:51] same spirit that dwelled in Christ Jesus
[46:54] dwells in you is going to Quicken or
[46:56] make a alive your mortal bodies as same
[46:59] as it did his now he said well Joshua
[47:02] was you know Joshua the Book of Joshua
[47:05] was a was Ephesians of the Old Testament
[47:07] it was a book of redemption he said it
[47:09] had two parts of coming out and going
[47:12] into and and and what a great Jubilee
[47:15] Exodus that is and and we believe now
[47:18] that we cannot lose our
[47:21] inheritance amen nothing in time God
[47:24] listen friends amen it doesn't matter
[47:26] matter if your church finds you worthy
[47:29] doesn't matter if your pastor finds you
[47:31] worthy amen what's important tonight if
[47:34] God found you worthy before the
[47:36] foundation of the world Amen and and
[47:41] Ephesian was ministering on this amen
[47:43] that he found you worthy amen before
[47:46] there was a foundation of the world
[47:48] before there was Stars before there was
[47:50] a Milky Way before there was a hell
[47:53] before there was this generation called
[47:55] the world Amen you were was existing in
[47:58] the mind of God and he found you worthy
[48:02] and nothing in time could ever erase it
[48:06] nothing in time can happen to cause you
[48:09] to lose your
[48:12] inheritance cuz brother R says like this
[48:15] we got an
[48:16] inheritance and our inheritance belongs
[48:19] to
[48:20] us listen he he he as he begins to quote
[48:24] Ephesians inheritance by predes
[48:27] ination he said I inherited something
[48:30] there had to be somebody to leave me
[48:32] inheritance he said why are you say
[48:35] Jesus left your inheritance he said I
[48:37] beg your pardon Jesus never left your
[48:40] inheritance Jesus never left your
[48:42] inheritance he only came down and paid
[48:45] for your inheritance and he brought you
[48:47] to your inheritance but your name was
[48:50] put on the L's book of life before the
[48:54] foundation of the world they said God
[48:57] gave you your inheritance and your
[49:01] inheritance Brother David was
[49:03] first God sent Jesus he said to make the
[49:08] inheritance real to you and I hallelujah
[49:12] amen so that's that's a reason that's a
[49:15] purpose of him condescending down cuz
[49:18] God had in his mind amen before there
[49:21] was a world brother Tom he had your name
[49:24] amen he written your name down and
[49:26] brother Brown said this amen that God's
[49:29] word can never go out void it's got to
[49:33] accomplish it's got to come back to him
[49:35] and render successfully because God's
[49:38] word is undefeatable it can't be stopped
[49:42] nothing can prevent it from coming to
[49:44] the pass Satan has tried it for 6,000
[49:47] years how's that worked out for him
[49:49] every time God spoken word with forth
[49:53] God Vindicated it by bringing it to pass
[49:58] yes sir Hallelujah and it can never
[50:01] return void and the message of the hour
[50:04] would set like this before the
[50:05] foundation of the world God wrote your
[50:07] name no wonder Luke 10: 20 says not
[50:10] rejoicing because Spirits are subject to
[50:12] you but Rejoice because your name was
[50:15] written in the L's book of life before
[50:18] the foundation of the
[50:21] world your inheritance was first
[50:25] Rejoice no something in time can reduce
[50:31] it oh that should make us all happy
[50:33] tonight nothing that you was trapped
[50:36] into in time can reduce your
[50:40] inheritance nothing in time can take
[50:43] away what God gave you in the eternities
[50:47] remember even as we Minister many times
[50:49] in this little series amen they that
[50:52] that the Jubilee sounded amen they got a
[50:55] right to go back to their inheritance
[50:58] the squaders was their time was limited
[51:01] because they received it by something
[51:03] that transpired in time amen but when
[51:06] they heard the Jubilee trumpet amen the
[51:09] individual had the right to go back to
[51:12] take back what rightly belonged to
[51:15] him amen listen friends God's word can
[51:20] never be
[51:21] defeated before there was an
[51:24] accuser God already B acted up in the
[51:29] heavens brother R says therefore the
[51:31] bride the rure come forth there is all
[51:35] pre-planned of God listen to this little
[51:38] statement it's all backed up from the
[51:42] beginning hey Ben he said nobody came
[51:44] Jesus didn't come to to leave you in
[51:47] inheritance you already had the
[51:48] inheritance it was first it was all
[51:51] backed up in the heavens it was all
[51:53] pre-planned by God by his for knowledge
[51:55] he can preach destinate you to to to
[51:58] become sons of
[52:00] God Amen oh that's that's what the
[52:04] message of the hour declared to us amen

[52:08] God you came from God and you're in time
[52:12] amen but that that the time can't hold
[52:15] you amen but for a
[52:18] season turn me up just a little bit

[52:31] lives amen we've all got past we don't
[52:35] want to be connected to any
[52:37] longer just keep that in your mind
[52:40] tonight cuz we're going somewhere with
[52:42] that thought
[52:43] tonight but remember last time or the uh
[52:47] the time before brother Matt when I
[52:49] tried to get brother Noah that $100 bill
[52:52] and he didn't act too excited his
[52:54] pockets are kind of full
[52:56] amen but yeah I offered him to him and
[52:59] no matter what I done to it it didn't uh
[53:03] uh
[53:04] devalue the worth of that bill I
[53:08] crumbled it I stomped on it but after
[53:10] all that you still want said yes I still
[53:12] want it why because it still had value
[53:15] nothing I could do to the $100 bill made
[53:18] it lose its value because it was all
[53:21] backed up by some goat
[53:25] somewhere h Hallelujah and thank God we
[53:28] had a message of the hour to come and
[53:29] tell you friends amen you got
[53:32] inheritance by predestination and it's
[53:35] all backed up in the heavens and nothing
[53:37] in time can separate you from The

[53:43] you hallelujah what a message of the
[53:46] hour to let us know amen we came from

[54:39] you from The Inheritance that God gave
[54:42] you before the foundation of the
[54:45] world nothing can steal your sunship
[54:49] that's right
[54:51] Hallelujah Exodus tells us by little by
[54:54] little I'll drive them out from before

[55:02] looks impossible how many serves a god
[55:04] like
[55:05] that until th be increase inherit the
[55:08] land and I will set the bounds from the
[55:12] sea even unto the Sea of the
[55:15] Philistines and from the desert unto the
[55:18] river for I will deliver the inhabitants
[55:20] of the land into your hand and thou
[55:23] shalt drive them out before thee he he's
[55:26] the our
[55:27] author and our
[55:31] finisher the beauty of this brother
[55:33] Travis God never starts anything he
[55:36] doesn't have the ability to finish he's
[55:39] the author and the finisher whatever he
[55:41] starts he always finishes amen whatever
[55:44] he loses he always
[55:46] finds he come to seek and to save that
[55:49] which was lost our God it's impossible
[55:52] for him to lose one of his we've been
[55:55] engraved into the pal of his
[55:59] hands hallelujah amen he can't forget
[56:03] you I don't care how deep in sin you
[56:06] might want to go amen Our God who's rich
[56:09] in Mercy David tells us Psalm 23 my God
[56:13] will pursue after you he'll go to the
[56:15] darkest jungles to the depths of the sea
[56:18] amen Our God cannot lose a one of you
[56:21] you think you can run fast enough my God
[56:24] can find you he would Trace you down
[56:27] because he can't lose one of his
[56:30] Darkness might try to hold on to you for
[56:32] a season but he can't hold you that much
[56:35] longer hey let me tell you I was going
[56:37] to get to this part but his days are
[56:42] numbered Hallelujah his days are
[56:48] numbered when God sends a
[56:51] Exodus without doubt brother Mark
[56:55] without doubt or fear
[56:59] someone is coming
[57:02] out and somebody is going
[57:07] in what a that's a
[57:10] beauty that's the beauty of it tonight
[57:12] that's the beauty of the Jubilee Exodus
[57:16] amen so the same anointing with the same
[57:18] power that couldn't stop Moses as a
[57:21] oneman Invasion going down to Egypt as
[57:24] she started the Exodus
[57:26] of telling
[57:28] Pharaoh let my people
[57:30] go Moses couldn't defeat pharaoh and his
[57:35] army on his own ability but he was
[57:38] anointed for this amen no matter what
[57:42] Pharaoh tried to do Aben Moses
[57:45] superseded it Aben why because he was
[57:48] working under the authority of almighty
[57:52] God hallelujah amen so the first part of
[57:55] the Exodus we see the mighty hand God
[57:58] taking them out of the task Master's
[58:01] hands out of the beadings and the scars
[58:03] down of
[58:05] Egypt and we see the journey all the way
[58:08] through the
[58:10] Wilderness even to the
[58:13] place will it come time with Moses and
[58:17] I'm not going to elaborate on these
[58:18] things got a lot of things to get to
[58:21] tonight don't let that scare
[58:23] you amen but even to the place brother
[58:26] Matt when he Moses says let's collect 10
[58:29] great men to go out and spy the
[58:33] land amen so they send those spies out
[58:37] with Joshua and
[58:39] Caleb why would he send these two men
[58:43] cuz he's going to have a
[58:44] witness he's going to have somebody's
[58:47] going to to to perform his word cuz he's
[58:50] already begun Exodus and if he starts in
[58:54] Exodus he's not just the god at the
[58:56] beginning and the end but he is the god
[58:59] in the in
[59:01] between
[59:03] Hallelujah and when they came back and
[59:07] they begin to give their
[59:09] testimonies and how the 10 says they're
[59:12] Giants in that land the sons of anoch is
[59:15] in that land we look at they was looking
[59:17] in the mirror and they begin to look at
[59:20] theirselves by look besides looking in
[59:22] the mirror of God's word the word are we
[59:25] already spoke they were amen but these
[59:28] men begin to look at the mirror of their
[59:30] own selves and begin to say we look like
[59:33] grasshoppers in their sight in other
[59:35] words we can't defeat them and no doubt
[59:38] they were speaking from a reality
[59:41] because they was looking at their own s
[59:43] and forgetting God's
[59:46] principles but they still had a witness
[59:49] he still had a Joshua and Caleb amen and
[59:53] after they heard all the negtive report
[59:55] it didn't stop their their their
[59:59] testimony yes sir what did Joshua and
[1:00:01] Caleb say
[1:00:03] brother we are more than able to take
[1:00:08] the land in other words he's saying the
[1:00:10] same God that brought us out of Egypt is
[1:00:14] the same God here's the
[1:00:17] evidence God's not dead he's still alive
[1:00:21] he's This Is Our Land this is our
[1:00:24] inheritance
[1:00:26] yes
[1:00:28] sir
[1:00:30] now if you'll
[1:00:33] notice this tie is getting on my nerves
[1:00:35] if you don't notice I told my wife it's
[1:00:38] too thick she said it's
[1:00:41] okay she said it didn't match but that's
[1:00:46] okay so don't blame her if I got blue on
[1:00:49] my
[1:00:52] pants but God's good isn't he but you
[1:00:57] realize I said all of that dealing with
[1:01:00] the Exodus to say this Caleb's response
[1:01:03] never
[1:01:05] changed no matter what he seen no matter
[1:01:08] what was transpiring amen no matter
[1:01:10] where he was in the journey Caleb no
[1:01:13] wonder the scripture said there's
[1:01:14] another Spirit within him that he was
[1:01:17] anointed for victory and we find him oh
[1:01:21] I could take a whole service on this
[1:01:23] amen we find him in this time of fixing
[1:01:26] of the to embrace heon which it it was
[1:01:29] Caleb's
[1:01:31] inheritance that was inhabitance there
[1:01:33] was Giants in his
[1:01:36] land the sons of angc was inhabitants of
[1:01:41] heon but it did not stop Caleb and his
[1:01:45] response never changed the same God that
[1:01:48] gave him the response why he's following
[1:01:51] the message of the hour he was anointed
[1:01:54] under the message of the
[1:01:57] hour and the same God that was in
[1:02:00] between the same God that was down Egypt
[1:02:03] is the same God is speak
[1:02:06] speaking and leading and guiding an 85
[1:02:09] year old man that is dirt is wore out
[1:02:13] his dirt is worn tired wearied beat down
[1:02:18] batter
[1:02:21] scarred but his
[1:02:23] response give me my mouth
[1:02:28] m theyed heon in
[1:02:33] time Hallelujah and I cannot I cannot
[1:02:36] lose my
[1:02:38] inheritance it came from
[1:02:41] God he gave it to me in the
[1:02:45] heavens thank you Lord he said the same

[1:50:10] there as long as you're holding the
[1:50:13] burden that's all you begin to think it
[1:50:14] gets so heavy like when I had brother
[1:50:17] Ben to hold that bottle up he held it up
[1:50:19] with ease but after a few moments it got
[1:50:22] so heavy he lost his praise he lost his
[1:50:25] shout he lost his his Joy all he can
[1:50:29] think about is the burden oh church he
[1:50:33] don't want you to concentrate on the
[1:50:35] burden you might have to carry it around
[1:50:37] because you're trapped in dirt but let
[1:50:40] him become your burden barrier tonight
[1:50:42] let him put a tender hand of Jehovah
[1:50:45] upon your
[1:50:46] burden oh and when I put my hands upon
[1:50:50] that bottle there was just a joy that
[1:50:53] came bursting in brother Ben's heart and
[1:50:55] I say the same way with you tonight if
[1:50:59] you'll let Jesus Christ come down and
[1:51:01] become your burden barrier you'll have

[2:01:51] that
[2:01:52] when all this big push when they was all
[2:01:55] these demonstrations against the Jews
[2:01:57] and stuff brother bam said that every
[2:01:59] nation I believe he said would turn
[2:02:00] against Israel amen so we're just seeing
[2:02:04] prophecy it shouldn't discourage us but
[2:02:06] just look up brother Tom cuz our
[2:02:08] Redemption draw High amen I enjoyed that
[2:02:11] tonight said a lot of good things
[2:02:12] brother Joe and that Victory formation
[2:02:14] was good we're in if we would he asked
[2:02:17] me to dismiss let's just bow our hearts
[2:02:19] and U I have a little request if You'
[2:02:22] just give me just a few seconds to tell
[2:02:24] you uh my cousin he uh he lives over in
[2:02:27] Northwest Arkansas and uh a lot of you I
[2:02:30] don't know some of you may know him his
[2:02:31] name's Tim Lane and he goes to church
[2:02:34] down there brother Tony's and uh uh he
[2:02:36] lives up by Rogers but he goes down
[2:02:38] there by close to Fort Smith and he
[2:02:40] helps out down there with the music and
[2:02:42] different things and his dad he's uh I
[2:02:45] believe he said he's 79 and my uncle be
[2:02:47] my Uncle Jim and um he said he fell the
[2:02:50] other day and he busted some ribs and I
[2:02:53] guess he busted them so bad that they
[2:02:55] were talking about maybe going in and
[2:02:57] putting some reinforcement or something
[2:02:58] in there some metal but they I guess did
[2:03:01] a CAT scan on him and found out he had a
[2:03:03] tumor on the brain so it been affected
[2:03:06] him a little bit and they didn't realize
[2:03:08] what was going on until the doctors
[2:03:09] found that so if you would would you uh
[2:03:12] keep hold him up in prayer this week and
[2:03:14] and brother Marty mccomus uh they told
[2:03:16] me it wasn't doing very good and if you
[2:03:18] would just you get a chance somewhere
[2:03:21] alone
[2:03:22] a lot of times there's times that I
[2:03:24] whisper y'all's name even when I'm out
[2:03:25] at work in the middle of the night
[2:03:27] sometimes and somebody will come on my
[2:03:29] heart and I'll pray for him and I
[2:03:30] believe God hears it brother Joel I

[2:03:44] Father
[2:03:46] Lord tonight if I wanted to get in to
[2:03:48] see the
[2:03:50] president they'd probably laugh me out
[2:03:53] so there ain't no Arkansas hillbilly
[2:03:55] going to get to come in and see the
[2:03:57] president if I went to other countries
[2:04:00] they wouldn't let me in to see
[2:04:01] dignitaries and great
[2:04:04] leaders but you're the great king of
[2:04:06] kings
[2:04:08] Lord and tonight I simply bow my head
[2:04:13] and I begin to speak to the
[2:04:15] maker and Lord I believe that you hear
[2:04:18] and answer prayer

[2:04:24] here tonight I pray you'd go with them
[2:04:26] as they leave and I I believe that each
[2:04:28] one's been blessed Lord I know I have
[2:04:31] thank you that you would stop by and
[2:04:33] visit us Lord we're So Unworthy but Lord
[2:04:37] how it begins to strengthen our hearts
[2:04:40] when you stop by Lord I pray tonight
[2:04:43] that each one that's sick and
[2:04:45] Afflicted Lord you're a God that hears
[2:04:47] and answers prayer and Lord I still
[2:04:49] believe the scripture where it says that
[2:04:52] by your stripes we were healed Lord It's
[2:04:54] a finished work tonight and I pray Lord
[2:04:56] you'd be with each one and may when we
[2:04:58] leave may we not leave from your
[2:04:59] presence but go with us Lord I pray that
[2:05:03] you'd encourage the hearts of your

[2:05:07] journey because we are Lord in the
[2:05:09] victory formation Lord I Thank you just
