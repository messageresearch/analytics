[45:57] you just a moment to turn there and I
[45:59] appreciate brother Mark getting up here
[46:01] and worshiping the Lord he's my brother
[46:03] so we kind of we kind of get along
[46:05] pretty good so amen y'all appreciate
[46:08] brother Mark
[46:11] amen amen Joshua the 6th chapter the
[46:14] first verse Bible says now Jericho was
[46:17] straightly shut up because of the
[46:18] children of Israel none went out and
[46:20] none came in and the Lord said unto
[46:22] Joshua see I have given into thine hand
[46:26] Jericho and the King thereof and the
[46:29] Mighty Men of Valor and I also want to
[46:31] read out of Revelations in the third
[46:33] chapter and we'll read from the 18th
[46:37] verse and Jesus speaking he
[46:40] said I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[46:43] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[46:46] rich and white rment that thou mayest be
[46:48] clothed and that the shame of thy
[46:50] nakedness do not appear and anoint thy
[46:52] eyes with isav that thou mayest see and
[46:55] we just ask the Lord to add his Blessing
[46:57] to the reading of the word this morning
[46:59] as you take your seats and I'm going to
[47:01] take uh just a minute the or some time
[47:04] this morning to speak of course we've
[47:06] been uh doing this uh study or or or
[47:09] series on on the revelation of the word
[47:12] and kind of been going in different
[47:14] directions as we've been going down
[47:16] through there and but I want to speak
[47:17] this morning on covered by Revelation
[47:20] and I just want to say this this morning
[47:23] it's um it's sure good to be uh to be
[47:25] able to be associated with a group of
[47:27] people that love the word of God Amen
[47:29] that take the revelation of the word and
[47:31] it means something to you and uh we love
[47:34] God how many love God Amen how many love
[47:36] his word amen we sure love the word of
[47:38] God and we love all the things that God
[47:40] has done for us I want to start in in of
[47:43] course last services or last couple of
[47:45] services as we've been preaching on
[47:47] Revelation I won't go back through them
[47:48] but uh had we had touched on the Cain
[47:51] and Abel and how that they had a
[47:52] different kind of Revelation and the
[47:54] sacrifices that they made were different
[47:55] and although that they had a desire to
[47:57] make a sacrifice and they had a desire
[48:00] to worship God and all that was
[48:02] seemingly the same everything was the
[48:03] same except for the sacrifice that they
[48:05] brought before the Lord and brother BR
[48:07] said now watch him he said it was it was
[48:09] the class that Cain came anointed he was
[48:11] anointed with Satan and he made a great
[48:13] big classical thing in other words this
[48:15] is what they had turned Church into and
[48:17] so he came to church and it was a great
[48:19] classical event and and he brought he
[48:21] brought his offering to the Lord and he
[48:23] expected God to receive his offering but
[48:25] it wasn't the kind of offering that God
[48:27] had expected them to bring and so he
[48:28] said but the difference was he says that
[48:30] when Abel came he never come in class
[48:33] but he came in Revelation he said the
[48:35] Bible said in Hebrews the 3r chapter
[48:36] that Abel by faith offered to God a more
[48:39] excellent sacrifice than Cain he said
[48:41] the only way he did it was by faith and
[48:43] by faith in what you would ask well it
[48:45] was faith in the word of God cuz that's
[48:47] the only thing that you can really have
[48:49] faith in he says see and God had
[48:51] revealed to him that it was the blood
[48:54] and Cain had a beautiful offering yet he
[48:56] was not covered in blood but Abel he
[48:59] didn't have a beautiful offering but it
[49:00] was covered in blood and it was
[49:02] according to the word of God and God
[49:04] recognized it because it was his word
[49:07] and I thought my isn't that something
[49:08] that Abel's Revelation allowed him to be
[49:12] allowed him to be covered in the blood
[49:14] of the sacrifice I thought is something
[49:16] that's the way it is today that the
[49:17] revelation of the word of God is what
[49:19] covers you that's what God has brought
[49:22] to us it's a place for the church to
[49:23] find the covering or the things that God
[49:26] has put uh put before us it's found in
[49:28] the revelation of the word and you know
[49:29] I I I as I was been studying on this
[49:31] Revelation you know my mind is going
[49:33] back to the church world today and uh I
[49:35] get to thinking of the Bride church
[49:37] today and all the men and women that
[49:39] have that that have taken a hold of this
[49:42] revealed word of the hour and then they
[49:44] they they spend their lives on it
[49:45] brother Mark and they dedicate their
[49:47] their lives to it and their work and
[49:49] their efforts and their finan they put
[49:50] so much uh behind it you know what would
[49:53] cause a group of people to put
[49:54] everything behind something it's because
[49:56] they have a revelation that struck their
[49:58] heart no nobody could just talk you into
[50:00] dedicating your life to something but
[50:01] it's a revelation that you have that
[50:03] causes you to get behind the word of God
[50:05] and to support the uh the movement of
[50:07] God and the and the message going forth
[50:09] and you know I realize that this is what
[50:11] God is doing today God is building his
[50:13] church around the world and you know
[50:15] what I found out that when God builds
[50:17] something God always does it for a
[50:18] purpose how many believes that say Amen
[50:20] when God builds something he always he
[50:22] always does it for a purpose and when
[50:24] God builds something everything that God
[50:26] builds always last isn't that wonderful
[50:29] the Bible says like this it said except
[50:30] the Lord build the house they labor in
[50:33] vain that build it but but except the
[50:35] Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh
[50:37] but in vain see there is nothing that
[50:39] God has ever built that has not
[50:41] fulfilled its purpose and there's
[50:42] nothing that God has ever built that
[50:44] that doesn't last but you know what I
[50:46] find out that this is the way it is that
[50:48] sometimes that there are things that are
[50:50] standing in the way that God has to tear
[50:53] down before he can build back so I know
[50:55] the the world has a different View about
[50:57] this that the world view today is that
[50:58] anything goes the world view today is
[51:01] that God must be a God that would accept
[51:03] anything and he has to accept everyone
[51:05] equally and there there's this uh
[51:06] there's this Spirit of or or or what
[51:08] word they use of inclusion that
[51:10] everybody ought to be included it don't
[51:11] matter how they are how what what what
[51:14] they think or what they feel or or what
[51:16] they want to be or how they want to act
[51:18] that we ought to you know everything
[51:19] ought to be accepted after all it's the
[51:21] age of acceptance but but you realize
[51:23] that's the world view but just because
[51:25] it's a world view don't make it God View
[51:27] and you know we find in many places that
[51:29] that God ordered men men of God and
[51:31] judges of Israel to tear things down
[51:33] people today is everything's got to be
[51:35] built up and you know God ain't a God
[51:37] that's going to tear something down
[51:38] after all God is a builder and God is
[51:40] about making things beautiful and God is
[51:42] about building great things but friends
[51:44] sometimes before God can build anything
[51:46] then God has to first come and tear
[51:48] something down that's in the way of what
[51:50] God wants to build and you know so we
[51:51] got to be open to God coming and
[51:53] building I find many places in the Bible
[51:55] where had God had to come coming first
[51:57] before there could be building and
[51:58] before there could be restoration that
[52:00] something had to be torn down and take
[52:02] it and taken out of the way you remember
[52:04] the young Josiah when he became the king
[52:06] over Israel the Bible says when Josiah
[52:08] looked across the land even as a young
[52:10] man he realized that there were things
[52:12] in the nation that weren't Godly things
[52:14] there were there there were things that
[52:16] were that were not obedient to the way
[52:18] that God had ordered them to to be
[52:20] raised and so here was a young man that
[52:22] he took his life and he went back to the
[52:24] word of God and brother Mark before he
[52:25] built any anything in that Nation the
[52:27] first thing he does is he went on a
[52:29] mission and he went from City to City to
[52:31] tear down things that didn't belong in
[52:33] the kingdom of God and the Bible says he
[52:35] tore down Idols he tore down shrines he
[52:38] tore down altars he tore down places of
[52:41] worship he tore down sacred monuments he
[52:44] dug up Graves just because the graves
[52:46] were buried with idols and and graven
[52:48] images he tore he dug the graves up and
[52:50] crush the bones that had been laying
[52:52] there with Idols to make room for God to
[52:55] come down in that Nation and to build
[52:57] what God wanted to build let me tell you
[52:59] friend sometimes before God builds he
[53:01] has to first come and tear down you
[53:03] remember the Tower of Bible when God
[53:05] came down God tore it down and let me
[53:07] tell you something else about God when
[53:08] God tears something down God intends on
[53:11] it staying down he don't intend on it
[53:13] being built back up but he tears it down
[53:15] because it don't belong and God will lay
[53:17] a foundation on a on a solid foundation
[53:20] God will build something back in your
[53:21] life that'll be able to stand the test
[53:23] of time see God tears down he wants
[53:26] things down you know I find this is the
[53:27] way it is that there are places that God
[53:29] wants to take the church but sometimes
[53:31] there are just things that are standing
[53:33] in the way that God can't take the
[53:35] church to that next place you know you
[53:37] know there's places in your life that
[53:38] God wants to take you there's
[53:40] Revelations brother marah that God wants
[53:42] to lead his children into there there's
[53:44] places in the life of every believer
[53:46] that God wants to take you to this next
[53:48] place but sometimes we just come to
[53:49] these places that are standing in the
[53:51] way how many how many's ever felt that
[53:53] way I want to go further with God but it
[53:55] seems like there's something that's just
[53:56] blocking me and there this just seems
[53:58] like I keep coming back to this same
[54:00] place there's always something standing
[54:02] in the way but I realize it this morning
[54:04] that God wants to take the church to
[54:06] another place he wants to take the
[54:07] church to a higher place he wants to the
[54:09] church is on the rise it ain't on the
[54:11] decline it's on the incline but ma'am
[54:13] said he said see the doctors of theology
[54:16] but what they have done is they have
[54:17] shut the door to Faith and forbade all
[54:20] to enter and they neither go in nor they
[54:22] let anyone else go in their theology
[54:24] comes out of a textbook on pschology
[54:27] that was written by some unbeliever
[54:29] there's a tech he said but there is a
[54:30] textbook on psychology that every one of
[54:33] us need he said see they shut the door
[54:35] of Faith they opened a book of
[54:36] psychology what kept the children of God
[54:39] from going any further with God he said
[54:41] but there is a textbook that we all need
[54:43] and it's called The Holy Bible it's
[54:45] written by God it contains God's
[54:47] psychology and you don't need any doctor
[54:49] to explain it to you just receive you
[54:52] the Holy Spirit and let him do the
[54:54] explaining that's the textbook that God
[54:57] has sent to the church today oh they may
[54:59] Shut the Door of Faith I I realize that
[55:01] what's happened today is that down
[55:03] Through the Ages brother Xavier that
[55:05] that there's been great walls that have
[55:07] been built up by men that are
[55:09] surrounding the promises of God and you
[55:11] realize that Satan he has anointed men
[55:13] to teach you away from the promise of
[55:16] God can you can you realize I know that
[55:17] sounds like an awful thing but do you
[55:19] realize that Satan has anointed men to
[55:21] teach you away from God's promise he's
[55:24] anointed men to teach you away from what
[55:27] God wants for the church I thought you
[55:28] know sometimes the Bible's promise is is
[55:31] different than the church promise see
[55:32] the bible promises that that there'd be
[55:34] healing but the church says there ain't
[55:36] no such thing anymore the bible promises
[55:38] that you can lay hands on the sick and
[55:40] they'd recover but the church says well
[55:42] that was only for the disciples the
[55:43] Bible says it promises that there' be
[55:45] joy in your salvation but the church
[55:48] it'll bring so much legalism that people
[55:50] can't have any Joy anymore cuz they're
[55:52] always living under condemnation and
[55:54] they can't be free to find the grace of
[55:56] God upon their life and and so that they
[55:58] can't even worship God or have any
[56:00] freedom in their life anymore but you
[56:02] you realize that that the church teaches
[56:04] different than the Bible teaches see but
[56:06] the promises you know the Bible says
[56:07] that where the spirit of the Lord is
[56:09] there's liberty but the church says well
[56:11] there ain't no such thing in that
[56:12] anymore but the church wants to be
[56:14] formal wants to be lukewarm and
[56:16] indifferent to the word of God you
[56:18] realize that's why when you come to
[56:19] churches today that you can have a a
[56:21] minister that it's anointed of God and
[56:23] the power of God fallen and if there a't
[56:25] any anointed Believers in the building
[56:27] it'll be formal it'll be lukewarm it'll
[56:30] be cold but I thank God this morning
[56:32] that not only do we have an anointed
[56:34] word and men that are anointed of God to
[56:36] preach the word of God but we have some
[56:38] hearers this morning that are anointed
[56:41] to receive God's word they're anointed
[56:43] to eat it and take it and feed upon it
[56:45] and let their life be changed by the
[56:47] word of the Living God it ain't no
[56:49] formal Church it ain't no lukewarm
[56:50] Church we're not indifferent to the word
[56:52] of God but we're receivers of the word
[56:54] of God and the promise of the Living God
[56:57] let me tell you something friends the
[56:59] the bible promises a Rapture the church
[57:01] says well not really but when you die
[57:03] maybe there's some kind of consolation
[57:05] that God will give us some kind of
[57:07] unexplainable connection between you and
[57:09] God but friends it ain't unexplainable
[57:11] it's very explainable he said in the
[57:13] moment in the twinkling of an eye this
[57:15] body will be changed the very God that
[57:17] created it he said I go and prepare a
[57:19] place for you for in my father's house
[57:21] are many mansions and if it wasn't true
[57:24] I wouldn't have told you so it's the
[57:26] promise of the Bible but you see what
[57:28] happens is is through Theology and
[57:31] through teaching that men have taught
[57:33] the promises of God right out of the
[57:35] reach of the church man is that
[57:37] something that they've taught the
[57:39] promise of God where you can't even
[57:40] reach it now we find the church is all
[57:42] walled out and the promises are all
[57:45] walled in here they come to this place
[57:48] but Mark they read every scripture but
[57:50] just not the ones that differ from their
[57:52] teaching you ever sit around and talk to
[57:54] some denominational fellow that's so
[57:55] mixed up and what his church says that
[57:57] he can't read what the Bible says and
[57:58] you said well brother but the Bible I
[58:00] had a guy telling me one time that God
[58:02] didn't heal no more I said well I've
[58:03] seen too many people be healed I mean
[58:04] you're talking to the wrong group of
[58:06] kids I know you're an elder and God
[58:07] bless you brother but in our age we've
[58:09] seen God heal we've seen God do the
[58:11] supernatural I saw people that couldn't
[58:13] walk I saw them walk again I saw people
[58:15] that couldn't see I've seen them see
[58:17] again God is still a Healer but I can't
[58:20] accept that but the Bible says lay hands
[58:22] on the sick and they shall recover well
[58:24] now our church ain't going to take that
[58:26] you know cuz that after all that was for
[58:28] that was for somebody else for a day
[58:29] going by I thought my isn't it something
[58:31] they're walking all the way around the
[58:33] promises of God and here there's a
[58:35] promise laid inside but it's so walled
[58:38] off that they can't get to the
[58:40] promise see it's just so they take all
[58:42] these brother Mar they'll they'll circle
[58:44] around them they'll take the Bible and
[58:45] they'll Circle the promises of God
[58:47] they'll they'll read scripture after
[58:48] scripture but just can't open that one
[58:50] that's laying in there why because it
[58:51] differs from the teaching so we're
[58:53] circling a promise but we just can't get
[58:55] to
[58:56] circling a promise but wondering why it
[58:59] don't apply to the church circling a
[59:00] promise but wondering why it ain't
[59:02] taking effect in our life you see what
[59:04] happens is is that people get caught up
[59:06] in this theology can I give you a bit of
[59:08] advice today let me tell you something I
[59:10] I don't mean this to sound mean but
[59:11] friends don't get caught up listening to
[59:13] teaching that keeps you away from any
[59:15] promise of God I'm not going to talk
[59:17] about men but I'm going to say it like
[59:19] this any man that is teaching you away
[59:21] from a promise of God the teaching I'm
[59:23] not going to say he ain't a man of God
[59:25] maybe he's just lost and maybe he's lost
[59:27] his way but the teaching that he's
[59:28] teaching is certainly not of God we're
[59:31] taught we had a brother preach brother
[59:33] Joe preached it last week or the a
[59:35] couple weeks ago he said for the
[59:36] promises with Jesus are yes and amen so
[59:39] if a man would teach you away from God's
[59:41] promise it certainly didn't come from
[59:42] Christ it only could come from the devil
[59:45] but God give us promises brother Mark
[59:47] these promises belong to the church you
[59:49] see these Divine Promises of God you say
[59:51] well how do you receive them you listen
[59:53] how job received them the Bible says
[59:54] here was job he was a the man that
[59:56] claimed his children would be saved you
[59:58] remember all the things that had
[1:00:00] happened in his life I I won't I won't
[1:00:01] preach the story but but everything had
[1:00:03] fell apart in his life until his own
[1:00:05] wife came to him and said why don't you
[1:00:06] just Curse God and die you've lived this
[1:00:09] life and you serve God and you've
[1:00:10] claimed to be a believer and now all
[1:00:12] these things are happening in your life
[1:00:14] how can you stand there and still be a
[1:00:15] believer when all these things are
[1:00:17] happening why don't you just Curse God
[1:00:18] and die but it didn't B to job he said
[1:00:21] you speak like a foolish woman why
[1:00:23] because there was something in the heart
[1:00:24] of job that realized that he had met the
[1:00:27] requirements that God had made but a
[1:00:29] amam said he had faith in what he done
[1:00:31] is because God had given him a
[1:00:33] requirement and not only did job go meet
[1:00:35] the requirement for himself but he met
[1:00:37] the requirement for his children so job
[1:00:39] could stand there in the in the in the
[1:00:40] middle of failure in the middle of
[1:00:42] trouble in the middle of great trial in
[1:00:44] the middle of great loss he' say but I
[1:00:46] met God's requirement and I know that I
[1:00:48] I have faith in the requirement of God
[1:00:51] I've done what God asked for and I
[1:00:52] believe that God is going to see you
[1:00:54] through he said see he met what Jehovah
[1:00:56] required he said if we could just do
[1:00:58] that what God required was a burnt
[1:01:01] offering for his sin and job didn't just
[1:01:03] offer it for himself but he offered that
[1:01:05] burnt offering for his children and when
[1:01:06] he made that offering that's all that
[1:01:08] God required and people today they say
[1:01:11] well I wish God I wish that's all that
[1:01:15] God required today just to take a
[1:01:17] sacrifice and throw it up on a rock and
[1:01:18] I wish that's all God required today
[1:01:20] butam said but God requires less than
[1:01:23] that he said all he requires today is
[1:01:26] just your faith in his word and if
[1:01:29] you'll make his word your absolute then
[1:01:31] any Divine promise in the Bible you can
[1:01:34] tie your soul to it and then it don't
[1:01:35] matter what comes your way it doesn't
[1:01:37] matter how much trouble you get into it
[1:01:39] doesn't matter how many things fall
[1:01:41] around you there's something on the
[1:01:42] inside of you said but my soul is tied
[1:01:45] to a Divine promise of God I've met his
[1:01:47] requirements I've accepted the word of
[1:01:49] God over my life it may not be the way I
[1:01:51] feel but it's what God said about it it
[1:01:54] may not be the way it looks but it's
[1:01:55] what God said about it and I've taken
[1:01:58] the Divine promise of God and I've
[1:02:00] placed it over my life see as we grow we
[1:02:03] come to places that our faith just can't
[1:02:05] get past sometimes these walls they
[1:02:08] separate us from the things that God
[1:02:10] wants us to receive but Joe you notice
[1:02:12] that this is what happened in the Book
[1:02:13] of Joshua here they come down to this
[1:02:15] place that was promised to them these
[1:02:16] brothers been preached on this the past
[1:02:18] couple of weeks they come to this place
[1:02:20] that God had promised them it was the
[1:02:22] land of promise and when they come to
[1:02:23] this this this this place of of Jer Jero
[1:02:26] you realize I I I thought you know here
[1:02:28] that God had promised it all along they
[1:02:29] finally come up to this Great Wall City
[1:02:31] it was it was the very first city that
[1:02:33] they come in contact with when they
[1:02:35] stepped over into the promised land here
[1:02:37] they're coming to receive everything God
[1:02:39] had promised them and the first time
[1:02:40] they entered brother wesle when they
[1:02:42] walk in there's a great wall standing
[1:02:44] before them that prevented them from
[1:02:46] receiving what God had promised them I
[1:02:48] thought my isn't that the way it is with
[1:02:50] a new believer when he comes and enters
[1:02:52] into this land of promise and when he
[1:02:54] walks in brother Mark and he and he
[1:02:56] looks right inside these walls there
[1:02:58] he's hearing about justification and
[1:03:00] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:03:02] Holy Ghost and but you know what it's
[1:03:04] just something that he can't achieve you
[1:03:05] mean you here he's looking at a wall
[1:03:07] thinking you mean that God can take all
[1:03:09] my sin and all my past and all my
[1:03:12] failures and and the thing y'all don't
[1:03:14] you don't even know what I've done in
[1:03:15] the places that I've been and you mean
[1:03:16] to tell me that God the the the allseen
[1:03:19] I the god that is an eternal God that's
[1:03:21] seen the beginning from the end you mean
[1:03:23] that God can't see my sin you mean he
[1:03:25] put it in a place where it don't matter
[1:03:27] anymore that'll never be brought up oh
[1:03:30] it's a promise of God but there's
[1:03:32] something there you know that that you
[1:03:33] have to get past butar for you to be
[1:03:35] able to receive it justification you
[1:03:39] mean God can wash me you mean God can
[1:03:40] feel me so full of his spirit that the
[1:03:42] things of this world won't have no hold
[1:03:44] on me anymore you mean that God can get
[1:03:46] me so filled of his spirit that that
[1:03:48] these things that used to torment me and
[1:03:50] the pressures and and the The
[1:03:51] Temptations but Mar they won't have a
[1:03:53] hold on me and I can come and I can be
[1:03:55] free I can walk by the same thing that
[1:03:57] used to get a hold of me and I can say I
[1:03:59] don't have to pick you up you're a snake
[1:04:01] I know you are and you walk right by it
[1:04:03] why cuz you've been freed by the blood
[1:04:05] of Jesus Christ you see it's a promise
[1:04:07] of God but sometimes it lays behind the
[1:04:10] wall sometimes it's laying there and you
[1:04:13] just can't get a hold of that one my I
[1:04:15] know boy I I'm going to preach to you
[1:04:17] anyway it's what the Lord put on my
[1:04:18] heart you know sometimes we I know the
[1:04:20] Lord I know you say it Lord we can be
[1:04:21] free and I know you say that the desire
[1:04:24] of sin would leave this flesh and Lord I
[1:04:26] but you know there's some things I just
[1:04:27] can't get over see it's
[1:04:30] walls the West they come up in place to
[1:04:33] prevent us from walking into these
[1:04:34] promises of God I thought isn't it
[1:04:36] something the Bible says for seven days
[1:04:38] they marched around these
[1:04:41] walls seven days on the seventh day
[1:04:43] seven times notice what Joshua said the
[1:04:46] Bible said and then Joshua commanded the
[1:04:47] people saying you shall not shout nor
[1:04:49] make any noise with your voice neither
[1:04:51] shall any word proceed out of your mouth
[1:04:53] until the day that I bid you to shout
[1:04:56] then you shall shout and the walls will
[1:04:58] fall down you know what happened y'all
[1:05:00] know the story I'm not going to preach
[1:05:02] on it but you know what happened the
[1:05:03] Bible says that whenever they shouted
[1:05:05] the walls of Jericho fell they everyone
[1:05:08] fell they fell to the ground brother
[1:05:09] Wesley and the very thing that God had
[1:05:11] promised him they got to go and have it
[1:05:13] because they obeyed the Lord I thought
[1:05:15] isn't it something they hear the Lord he
[1:05:17] said there's coming a day that I'm going
[1:05:19] to give you a command this is what he
[1:05:20] told Joshua Joshua said there's coming a
[1:05:22] day I'm going to give you a command it
[1:05:24] may not be today here was before the
[1:05:26] first day before they ever took their
[1:05:28] first step or or first walk around the
[1:05:30] wall but Joshua said there's coming a
[1:05:31] day that I'm going to give you a command
[1:05:34] and that command is going to be to shout
[1:05:36] it's going to be to cry out and whenever
[1:05:37] you hear that command to shout and you
[1:05:39] cry out every wall is going to fall down
[1:05:42] I thought my isn't it something that
[1:05:44] word shout it was a Battle Cry and when
[1:05:46] they went out the Bible says when they
[1:05:48] went out and they made that Battle Cry
[1:05:50] it put fear in the heart of those in
[1:05:52] Jericho they knew that something was
[1:05:53] happening the walls begin to shake there
[1:05:56] was nothing that could hold them
[1:05:57] together but a mark because the Cry of
[1:05:59] the children of God had gone out I
[1:06:01] thought my here here you hear this
[1:06:03] Battle Cry I know sometimes we look for
[1:06:05] you know we're looking for this great
[1:06:06] Cry of battle what what what is it to us
[1:06:09] but listen when I when I read this in
[1:06:11] the concordance and I sure love to do I
[1:06:13] sure love to go through the word in this
[1:06:14] way but but in the concordance it says
[1:06:17] it says it's worth noting that this word
[1:06:19] shout in the Book of Joshua that was
[1:06:21] used for a battlecry is the same word
[1:06:24] that was used and a shout of Joy says so
[1:06:27] in other words whenever a person when
[1:06:30] you find in the Bible and it says shout
[1:06:31] for Joy it's the same it's same word
[1:06:34] that they use when they told them to
[1:06:35] shout or let the battlecry go out I
[1:06:37] thought my isn't this something that for
[1:06:39] you is a shout of Joy but to the devil
[1:06:42] it's a battlecry and you know we're
[1:06:43] looking and say what what are we crying
[1:06:45] out well friends let me tell you it
[1:06:46] ought to put fear in the heart of the
[1:06:48] devil today he put so much on you he
[1:06:51] says you ought to give up he put so much
[1:06:53] on you so much pressure brother Wesley
[1:06:55] that ought to fold and the devil what is
[1:06:57] he doing he's waiting and he's watching
[1:06:59] on you to crumble he's waiting and
[1:07:01] watching for you to give up he's waiting
[1:07:03] and watching for you to turn your back
[1:07:05] on the word of God and go back out into
[1:07:07] the world or go find some denomination
[1:07:09] to sh in he's watching for you to fail
[1:07:11] oh let me tell you man I just I'm going
[1:07:14] to preach for a minute I can't that old
[1:07:15] that old stubborn devil let me tell you

[1:07:30] going to last she's all she's about to
[1:07:32] throw in the towel and but let me tell
[1:07:34] you friends I think we ought to remind
[1:07:36] the devil that there's a word that is
[1:07:38] concerning you Jesus said I'll never put
[1:07:41] on you more than you could bear so if
[1:07:43] the devil says she's going to break I
[1:07:45] say she's going to stand if he says
[1:07:47] she's going to fall I say she's going to
[1:07:49] rise if he say she's going to crumble I
[1:07:51] say she's going to overcome cuz I have a
[1:07:54] word that's overcoming my
[1:07:56] life I'll never put on you let me tell
[1:07:59] you the devil he's waiting for that
[1:08:01] shout of anger he's waiting on you to
[1:08:03] give up he's waiting on you say I quit
[1:08:05] he's waiting on you say I can't stand it
[1:08:07] no more he's waiting on you to say I
[1:08:09] can't go another mile but let me tell
[1:08:11] you it ain't a shout of anger that he's
[1:08:13] going to hear it ain't a shout of fear
[1:08:15] that he's going to hear but I thank God
[1:08:17] there's some Believers this morning that
[1:08:19] have a shout of Joy when you feel like
[1:08:22] giving up somebody say praise the Lord
[1:08:24] when you feel like giv up you say
[1:08:26] Hallelujah Lord I Thank you for every

[1:08:31] thank you for the failures Lord they
[1:08:33] made me what I am he's looking for you
[1:08:36] to give in looking for a shout of fear
[1:08:40] but instead he'll hear a shout of Joy
[1:08:42] let me tell you friends and a shout of
[1:08:44] Joy will release it'll release the
[1:08:46] pressure off your life oh my I feel like
[1:08:50] preaching a shout of Joy it'll release

[1:09:42] Battle Cry to the devil might it's
[1:09:45] something that a shout of joy in the
[1:09:47] church would send the devil running

[1:09:53] you from God's promises it'll lay you
[1:09:55] down before your feet it's a shout of

[1:10:34] what Liberty is anymore used to Worship
[1:10:36] the Lord have so much Liberty in the
[1:10:38] house of God but what they get under
[1:10:39] this that old Spirit holding people down

[1:10:45] free we got a right a shout how many say
[1:10:48] Amen brother Conor you got a right to
[1:10:50] shout you know what the devil does he'll
[1:10:52] look at your life you ain't got a right
[1:10:53] to do nothing you know he does that to
[1:10:55] all all of us you you ain't got but but
[1:10:56] we got a right to it's a shout of joy we
[1:10:59] got a right to thank God for what he's
[1:11:00] done for us said when I give you the
[1:11:02] command you
[1:11:04] shout see why don't we have a right
[1:11:06] because we've had a real conversion how
[1:11:09] many say Amen we've had a real
[1:11:11] conversion you know what we've been
[1:11:12] converted from the love of the world to
[1:11:15] the love of God brother being God took
[1:11:18] us out of the world and and we've had a
[1:11:19] real conversion and now you know what we
[1:11:21] do we seek first the kingdom of God and
[1:11:24] his righteousness as the Bible says to
[1:11:26] do we our our heart has been changed it
[1:11:28] became our priority and brother Mark you
[1:11:30] know what we've had we've had a real
[1:11:32] Pentecostal experience and I know I know
[1:11:34] the churches man I know the churches are
[1:11:37] teaching away from that can I can I take
[1:11:38] just a minute I got a right to M matter
[1:11:41] of fact I'm obligated to but you realize
[1:11:44] the churches are teaching away from that
[1:11:46] but it's not what the prophet taught so
[1:11:48] listen whenever Apostle Paul Apostle
[1:11:50] Paul had to go out and he had an
[1:11:51] experience with God and when he had that
[1:11:54] experience now Paul done the right thing
[1:11:56] is he went back to the scripture to
[1:11:58] found out if his experience was
[1:11:59] scriptural or not how many knows that to
[1:12:01] see Paul went out when he had this he
[1:12:03] said he had to before he could accept
[1:12:05] his experience he went back to the Bible
[1:12:07] and he found out he went to another
[1:12:08] Nation he stayed for three years
[1:12:09] searching the scripture to see if his
[1:12:10] experience was right we realize that he
[1:12:12] had a great thing to face he had to come
[1:12:14] back and tell his church that all the
[1:12:16] people that that the very things that he
[1:12:19] had persecuted was right he said how
[1:12:21] many had to do something like that
[1:12:23] certainly nearly all of us did we had to
[1:12:25] go back and say them people that we
[1:12:27] called Holy Rollers that to come to find
[1:12:29] out they were right I know we don't call
[1:12:31] each other that that's a name the devil
[1:12:32] put on the church that there ain't no
[1:12:34] such a really thing but but he said but
[1:12:35] then people they called Holy Rollers
[1:12:37] come to find out they were right he said
[1:12:39] that's it we just had to turn around and
[1:12:41] the things we once hated we now love
[1:12:43] what was it it was a real conversion it
[1:12:46] may seem like a strange thing it may be
[1:12:48] odd to you but the thing you once once
[1:12:51] hated now you love the thing that the
[1:12:53] world's afraid of but you're in love
[1:12:55] with it oh friends let me tell you I
[1:12:56] thank God that there's a group of people
[1:12:58] here this morning that ain't afraid of
[1:13:00] the move of God I thank God that there's
[1:13:02] some people here this morning that ain't
[1:13:03] afraid of the Holy Ghost brother Wes we
[1:13:05] ain't afraid of the supernatural we
[1:13:07] ain't afraid of Pentecost or or real
[1:13:10] Pentecostal experience now now I'm not
[1:13:12] talking about I'm not talking about a
[1:13:15] Pentecostal church but but speaking of
[1:13:17] the experience that they had in the book
[1:13:18] of Acts how manyan how many knows what
[1:13:19] that was remember when the the Bible
[1:13:21] says when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:13:22] come and the Holy Ghost fell upon them
[1:13:25] they came out speaking in an unknown
[1:13:26] tongue you you realize they stayed in a
[1:13:28] room and they prayed until the spirit of
[1:13:30] God fell upon them until the person of
[1:13:33] the Holy Ghost stepped down into the
[1:13:35] room that they were in you realize who
[1:13:37] it was it was Elohim in the form of the
[1:13:40] Holy Ghost brother the Wesley he came
[1:13:41] right down into the room little licks of
[1:13:43] fire that fell on them and indwelled in
[1:13:45] the hearts of those men till they came
[1:13:47] out speaking in an unknown tongue the
[1:13:49] same God that walked down the shores the
[1:13:52] shores of of Galilee or the in the
[1:13:54] streets of jerus J it was the same God
[1:13:56] that walked down in that room that day
[1:13:58] and that came out speaking in those
[1:13:59] unknown tongues and let me tell you
[1:14:01] friends what has happened that that that
[1:14:03] Pentecostal Church of course they made a
[1:14:05] teaching out of it and they said well
[1:14:06] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is that
[1:14:08] you would speak in tongues because you
[1:14:10] know after all they spoke in tongues and
[1:14:11] so so they said well that must be the
[1:14:13] evidence so if you speak in tongues then
[1:14:14] then you got the Holy Ghost too and see
[1:14:16] when people can't speak in tongues then
[1:14:18] it causes a bunch of confusion you
[1:14:19] realize what it does it builds a wall
[1:14:21] and says well I must not have the Holy
[1:14:23] Ghost because I didn't do what they did
[1:14:25] see the it's a wall that a man that a
[1:14:27] man built up but you realize that the
[1:14:29] miracle that happened at Pentecost it
[1:14:31] wasn't that they spoke in an unknown
[1:14:32] tongue but the real miracle that
[1:14:34] happened is that everybody heard it in
[1:14:36] their own language the Bible says there
[1:14:38] was noise abroad and the multitude came
[1:14:40] together and every man heard them speak
[1:14:42] and they were amazed and marveled saying
[1:14:44] one to another are not all these which
[1:14:45] speak galileans well then how can all of
[1:14:48] us hear in our own language you said
[1:14:50] well what were they speaking listen he
[1:14:52] said we do hear them speak in our own
[1:14:55] tongues the wonderful works of God I
[1:14:57] thought my itness something here The
[1:14:59] Holy Ghost came and he and he ministered
[1:15:01] to every tongue and every nation the
[1:15:03] Bible said that in Jerusalem at that
[1:15:06] time dwelt men of every nation under the
[1:15:09] heavens so here God would come down in
[1:15:11] the form of the Holy Ghost these men
[1:15:13] Anointed with God the Holy Ghost they
[1:15:15] come out they were speaking in unknown
[1:15:17] tongues and the Bible said when they
[1:15:18] spoke out every man of every nation
[1:15:20] heard it in their own language you say
[1:15:22] well what was happening they were
[1:15:23] fulfilling what Jesus said in Luke 24 he
[1:15:26] said repentance and remission of sins
[1:15:28] should be preached in my name among all
[1:15:31] nations beginning at Jerusalem so here
[1:15:34] we see this being fulfilled you but now
[1:15:36] let me show you brother Mark let me can
[1:15:37] I just show you this but watch what what
[1:15:39] was the response of it when the works of
[1:15:42] God were manifested when God began to
[1:15:44] manifest himself the Bible says they
[1:15:46] were amazed and they were in doubt I
[1:15:50] thought isn't that always the way it is
[1:15:51] whenever God does something there's some
[1:15:53] amazed and there's some in doubt when
[1:15:56] God it's a supernatural there's some
[1:15:58] amazed but there's some doubt why can't
[1:16:00] it's always the same response it's the
[1:16:02] same response today when the works of
[1:16:04] God is made manifest they're amazed
[1:16:06] they're endowed it always brings both
[1:16:07] sides some hear and some don't and some
[1:16:10] some see and some don't some will feed
[1:16:12] on the word of God and some won't but
[1:16:14] I've got news for you today that this
[1:16:16] word today this oldfashioned Gospel of
[1:16:19] Jesus Christ the revealing of the
[1:16:20] mysteries of God it must be planted in
[1:16:23] the Church of the Living God
[1:16:25] it'll Amaze some some will be in doubt
[1:16:28] but it has to be planted you say well
[1:16:30] why is it got to be planted because the
[1:16:31] church has to produce the right kind of
[1:16:33] children it's got to bring forth these
[1:16:36] children that God had called it to
[1:16:38] produce so the seed has to be planted
[1:16:39] you realize the church is bringing forth
[1:16:41] all kinds of children but said notice he
[1:16:43] said they got all kinds of new members
[1:16:44] so there must be pregnated with
[1:16:45] something because there's something
[1:16:47] coming forth there's all kinds of
[1:16:49] children he said but what the church
[1:16:50] world don't want is they don't want none
[1:16:52] of them this is inv visible Union 19 65
[1:16:55] he said they don't want none of them
[1:16:57] screaming hollering blabbering acts 238
[1:17:00] miserable creatures that they think they
[1:17:01] are it would certainly embarrass them it
[1:17:04] would Ru her educated ethical scientific
[1:17:07] Society Church that she belonged to they
[1:17:09] would throw her out at the next Council
[1:17:11] she can't have it she don't want to be
[1:17:13] pregnated with the word but that's the
[1:17:15] only kind that the word can bring forth
[1:17:18] are you hear me somebody the one that
[1:17:20] she don't want is the only kind that the
[1:17:23] word can produce what kind of was it it
[1:17:25] was the screaming and hollering and
[1:17:27] blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures
[1:17:30] that that old scientific church rebukes
[1:17:32] but he said but that's the only kind of
[1:17:33] church that God's word can bring forth I
[1:17:36] mean this ain't me as a prophet of God
[1:17:38] he said that's what God's word produces
[1:17:40] it's what it produced 2,000 years ago
[1:17:42] and that's what it produces today the
[1:17:45] spirit of God only produces one kind of
[1:17:47] children they're word born somebody say
[1:17:49] Amen Blood Bought Spirit-filled children
[1:17:53] of God
[1:17:54] that's what the word
[1:17:56] produces let me tell you what they'll do
[1:17:59] but a being they'll they'll bear the
[1:18:01] characteristics of God the character of
[1:18:05] Jesus Christ when they have that real
[1:18:07] conversion they'll love you even if you
[1:18:10] don't love them back they'll say good
[1:18:12] things about you even when you say bad
[1:18:14] things about them they'll give their
[1:18:16] life one for another they'll love those
[1:18:19] that spitefully use them they'll display
[1:18:22] the character of Christ I thought you
[1:18:24] you know taking me a break brother
[1:18:27] Wesley sometimes people want to hold you
[1:18:30] to a Bible standard but they don't want
[1:18:32] to have a Bible
[1:18:34] standard but I thank God that what we
[1:18:36] have as a body of people this morning
[1:18:38] that not only do we hold a standard but
[1:18:40] we want to live the standard that we're
[1:18:42] holding I'm not going to hold something
[1:18:43] over you that I ain't going to live
[1:18:45] myself but I thank God this is real
[1:18:47] Believers it's a we live by the standard
[1:18:51] that we hold we have a desire to live
[1:18:53] the word that we preach but Mar there's
[1:18:56] something in our heart causes us to be
[1:18:58] real Believers let me let me share this
[1:19:01] with
[1:19:02] you the Bible teaches this of course
[1:19:05] they made this the the evidence of the
[1:19:07] Holy Ghost but I I don't want to leave
[1:19:08] you wondering I don't believe God ever
[1:19:09] Liv the church in confusion but there is
[1:19:12] an Evidence of the Holy Ghost but it's
[1:19:14] found in a different place than you
[1:19:15] would than you would expect to find it
[1:19:17] matter of fact you can find in Luke the
[1:19:19] first chapter the Bible says when the
[1:19:21] angel of the Lord can I just can I just
[1:19:22] show you this when the angel of the Lord
[1:19:24] came came to Zacharias remember what the
[1:19:26] angel told him here his wife was going
[1:19:27] to bring forth a child he says fear not
[1:19:29] Zacharias for your prayer is heard your
[1:19:31] wife Elizabeth shall bear a son and she
[1:19:33] shall call his name John he'll have joy
[1:19:35] and great gladness and many Will Rejoice
[1:19:36] at his birth and there shall be a great
[1:19:38] he shall be great in the sight of the
[1:19:39] Lord and He Shall drink neither strong
[1:19:41] drink nor wine and he shall be filled
[1:19:43] with the Holy Ghost even from his
[1:19:45] mother's womb now you hold on to that
[1:19:47] scripture and let's read another one
[1:19:48] Matthew 3 the Bible says when John was
[1:19:50] baptizing at the River Jordan notice
[1:19:53] what happens glory to God while he's
[1:19:55] baptizing brother Jared the Bible says
[1:19:57] and then come Jesus From Galilee to
[1:20:00] Jordan unto John but BR takes those two
[1:20:03] scriptures he says now notice this he
[1:20:05] said first he was filled with the holy
[1:20:07] ghost from his mother's womb and then
[1:20:08] when he was baptized in the Jordan Jesus
[1:20:11] came to him Jesus being the top of the
[1:20:12] word he said see the word always comes
[1:20:15] to those that are truly Spirit-filled he
[1:20:18] said and that is the evidence of being
[1:20:20] filled with the Holy Ghost Now isn't
[1:20:22] that something brother West that the
[1:20:24] real evidence is the word would come to
[1:20:26] you and that you would receive it oh
[1:20:28] friend let me tell you a Spirit-filled
[1:20:29] Bel a Believer they can't stop the
[1:20:32] revelation of the of the word of God
[1:20:34] from coming to them you know whenever we
[1:20:36] started this series brother Mark we
[1:20:37] started in the in Revelation and showing
[1:20:40] how that everything happened by faith
[1:20:42] you were healed by faith our Salvation
[1:20:44] came by faith but but but then the
[1:20:46] question came up but where did Faith
[1:20:47] come from and the Bible says faith
[1:20:49] cometh by hearing of the word of God so
[1:20:52] now remember it wasn't the hearing of
[1:20:53] the ear but it was a the hearing of the
[1:20:55] heart so in other words Faith come by
[1:20:57] Revelation so in other words you
[1:20:58] couldn't have healing without Revelation
[1:21:00] you couldn't be saved without a
[1:21:01] revelation so it took Revelation in
[1:21:03] order to bring Faith but then that
[1:21:05] brings up another question for this
[1:21:06] morning and that question is well then
[1:21:08] if if Revelation is what brings Faith
[1:21:11] well then what brings Revelation well
[1:21:13] the answer is simple the Bible says what
[1:21:15] brings it is the spirit of Truth now
[1:21:18] we've been building through this for
[1:21:19] several weeks but he says see what
[1:21:20] brings Revelation it's the spirit of
[1:21:22] Truth Jesus said in John 14th chapter
[1:21:25] he said I will pray the father he shall
[1:21:27] give you another comforter and he may
[1:21:29] abide with you forever even the spirit
[1:21:30] of Truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:21:33] catch that because it seeth him not
[1:21:35] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[1:21:37] he dwelleth with you he shall be in you
[1:21:39] I'll not leave you comfortless I will
[1:21:40] come to you in a little while the world
[1:21:42] seeth me no more but you see me because
[1:21:44] I live you shall live also and at that
[1:21:46] day you shall know that I am in my
[1:21:48] father and you are in me and I am in you
[1:21:51] so here Jesus prophesies brother Jared
[1:21:53] that there is one coming after him that
[1:21:56] would be called the spirit of Truth so
[1:21:58] he he's introducing this Spirit of Truth
[1:22:00] which which we know he says see but but
[1:22:01] there's some things that you have to
[1:22:03] know about the spirit of Truth the first
[1:22:05] thing you have to know is the world
[1:22:06] can't receive it these are just some
[1:22:09] truths about it first off the world will
[1:22:11] never be able to receive it the Bible
[1:22:12] says so second thing was is the bride
[1:22:15] would have to receive it is't that good
[1:22:18] it was something that the world would
[1:22:19] never receive and the the church
[1:22:21] couldn't help but receive you say well
[1:22:23] she might receive it no no no no no she
[1:22:25] must receive it say well well maybe
[1:22:28] she'll be able to re no no she will
[1:22:29] receive it well it's a possibility that
[1:22:32] you'll be able to receive the spirit no
[1:22:33] it's not a possibility but Mark it's a
[1:22:35] guarantee that the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:22:38] would receive the spirit of truth that
[1:22:39] Jesus told would come the spirit of
[1:22:41] truth it's not a mystery I know it's
[1:22:43] been uh uh preached as a mystery but but
[1:22:46] but John 17 makes it plain and
[1:22:48] identifies what it is he said Thy word
[1:22:50] is truth but said now watch watch these
[1:22:53] two things he said John 14 the world
[1:22:55] couldn not receive the spirit of Truth
[1:22:57] which was the Holy Ghost but then in
[1:22:59] John the 8th chapter Jesus said why do
[1:23:01] you not understand my speech he said
[1:23:02] because you can't hear my word he said
[1:23:05] see so not only could the world not
[1:23:06] receive the Holy Ghost but though
[1:23:09] neither could they receive the word of
[1:23:10] God so they couldn't receive the spirit
[1:23:13] of God neither could they receive the
[1:23:15] word of God he said why because the
[1:23:17] spirit and the word are one and if you
[1:23:19] have the Holy Spirit as the prophets did
[1:23:21] then the word would come to you and you
[1:23:23] would have to receive it that's why
[1:23:25] they'll never have this Spirit like you
[1:23:27] have in in such a a seal of God in their
[1:23:30] life like you have because if you have
[1:23:31] that in your life then you must receive
[1:23:34] the word he said because they're one and
[1:23:36] the word would come to you and you would
[1:23:37] have to receive it so here's what the
[1:23:39] prophet lays down this principle I think
[1:23:40] this is beautiful is he shows us that
[1:23:43] this is this is why we preach so much on
[1:23:45] the Holy Ghost and why and the spirit of
[1:23:47] God and the church getting into a
[1:23:49] spiritual place and and not just being
[1:23:50] some formal church or or just reading
[1:23:52] some scripture and it all being about
[1:23:54] Theology and things but but realize here
[1:23:56] this principle that the prophet lays
[1:23:58] down he said this is what Jesus is
[1:23:59] telling us that the word comes where the
[1:24:02] spirit of God is you see why it's
[1:24:04] important to have the spirit of God in
[1:24:06] the church you see why it's important to
[1:24:08] have the spirit of God in your life and
[1:24:10] to live in a spiritual place and to be
[1:24:12] able to to live in a state of worship
[1:24:14] and and to have your home Sanctified and
[1:24:16] your and your car driving down the road
[1:24:18] is to allow the spirit of God to be
[1:24:20] welcome where you are because where the
[1:24:22] spirit of God is then the word comes so
[1:24:25] if you want to have the word so you must
[1:24:27] have the spirit Jesus said but the
[1:24:29] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[1:24:31] the father will send in my name he'll
[1:24:33] teach you all things and he'll bring all
[1:24:35] things to your remembrance whatever I
[1:24:36] have said unto you you see so the Holy
[1:24:38] Ghost is your teacher but said here
[1:24:40] again we find that the word comes
[1:24:43] because of the spirit of God so once
[1:24:45] again we're show this the word comes
[1:24:47] because of the spirit of God so here's
[1:24:49] here lays a revelation but the mark that
[1:24:51] the world has yet to catch John 16 said
[1:24:54] how be it when he the spirit of Truth
[1:24:56] which was the word is come he will guide
[1:24:58] you into all truth because the word is
[1:25:00] truth he shall speak not of himself but
[1:25:02] whatever he shall whatever he shall hear
[1:25:05] which was the word of God that shall he
[1:25:07] speak to you and then the next part the
[1:25:10] Bible says and he will show you things
[1:25:12] to come I better have me a jubilee when
[1:25:14] I read this you and let somebody answer
[1:25:16] me this question of what gift of the
[1:25:19] five-fold ministry would show you things
[1:25:21] to come somebody answer it God called a
[1:25:25] five-fold Ministry to the church but
[1:25:27] there's a gift in that five-fold
[1:25:28] Ministry that has the ability to show
[1:25:30] you things that have not happened yet
[1:25:31] anybody want to tell me what it is a
[1:25:33] prophet thank you so here Jesus is
[1:25:36] speaking he said the spirit of truth
[1:25:37] will come he shall not speak himself
[1:25:39] whatever he'll hear it be the word of
[1:25:41] God he shall speak to you the word and
[1:25:43] he will show you things to come I isn't
[1:25:45] that good so in other words to hear the
[1:25:47] Holy Ghost is going to come and he's
[1:25:49] going to reveal to the church the the
[1:25:51] word of God he's going to lead them into
[1:25:53] all things but all also this Holy Ghost
[1:25:55] will show you things that are to come
[1:25:57] here what he's showing us is that God is
[1:25:59] going to have to use that gift it can't
[1:26:01] he'll have to use the gift of Prophecy
[1:26:03] you know that's what a prophet is is to
[1:26:04] tell you something that hasn't taken
[1:26:06] place yet so here God is going to use
[1:26:08] this gift of Prophecy to show you things
[1:26:10] that are to come I thought my isn't it
[1:26:11] something that the spirit is bringing
[1:26:13] the word of Prophecy it comes by the
[1:26:15] Holy Ghost oh friends it don't come from
[1:26:17] the devil I know the church where we
[1:26:19] look at it say well it's be El and it
[1:26:21] must have come from the devil and it
[1:26:22] must have come from some much of reading
[1:26:24] or something like that but that ain't
[1:26:25] what Jesus said Jesus said it's going to
[1:26:28] come the spirit of truth will come he'll
[1:26:30] reveal to you the word he'll speak the
[1:26:31] word he'll speak the things that I tell
[1:26:33] him to speak and he'll show you things
[1:26:35] that are to come I say Lord let him come
[1:26:38] Lord Jesus oh let the spirit of Prophecy
[1:26:40] speak in this age it ain't something
[1:26:42] that we're running from it's something
[1:26:44] that we're running to I say hear it this
[1:26:46] morning the voice of truth that is
[1:26:48] crying out in our age he said I want you
[1:26:51] to note very carefully that Jesus did
[1:26:53] not say that the evidence of being
[1:26:54] baptized with the Holy Ghost was
[1:26:56] speaking in tongues or interpreting or
[1:26:58] prophesying or shouting and dancing but
[1:27:00] he said the evidence would be that you
[1:27:02] would be in the truth that's the
[1:27:04] evidence of the Holy Ghost that you
[1:27:06] would be in the truth you know how good
[1:27:08] that makes me feel glory to God yeah
[1:27:10] because sometimes you question yourself
[1:27:12] and you you question your your salvation
[1:27:14] and where you are with God and I I don't
[1:27:15] even know if I have the Holy Ghost or
[1:27:17] not but here the Bible says but the
[1:27:19] evidence that you have the Holy Ghost is
[1:27:21] that you would be in the truth glory to
[1:27:24] God so every day when I get up and I
[1:27:27] read the truth of God's word I say Lord
[1:27:30] I Thank you for bringing me the truth
[1:27:32] Lord I Thank you for revealing truth
[1:27:34] Lord I Thank you for speaking your heart
[1:27:36] to me the truth that came out of the
[1:27:38] mind of God Lord I Thank you for the
[1:27:40] gift of Prophecy that came in my age
[1:27:43] Lord that would show me the things that
[1:27:44] were to
[1:27:46] come it's an evidence that you have the
[1:27:49] Holy Ghost you would be in the word of
[1:27:51] God for your age to see the evidence has
[1:27:53] to do with per receiving of the word can
[1:27:55] I read one more I know we're getting
[1:27:56] close to time Paul said If any man think
[1:27:58] of himself to be a prophet or spiritual
[1:28:00] let him acknowledge the things that I
[1:28:01] write unto you are the Commandments of
[1:28:03] the Lord so he says see the proof of the
[1:28:06] indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and
[1:28:09] to follow what God had already done
[1:28:11] through his Prophet is't that good here
[1:28:14] Apostle Paul there's many spiritual men
[1:28:16] that are raising up in the days of Paul
[1:28:18] but in the midst of all them raising up
[1:28:20] well we've got a we've got a we're close
[1:28:21] to God too well I've got a I've got a
[1:28:23] Theology and you know I've got I've got
[1:28:25] ideas about it too you're not the only
[1:28:26] one you know I you know I've got some
[1:28:28] thoughts about it too you're not the
[1:28:29] only one to get all the answers from but
[1:28:31] listen how Paul Paul knew who he was so
[1:28:34] by the authority of God Paul would say
[1:28:36] these words he said If any man think of
[1:28:38] himself to be a prophet or to be
[1:28:39] spiritual let him acknowledge the things
[1:28:41] that I write unto you are the
[1:28:43] Commandments of the Lord so if you're
[1:28:45] spiritual and you claim to be a prophet
[1:28:47] and you claim to have a word of word of
[1:28:48] the Lord first acknowledge that what I'm
[1:28:50] telling you comes from God so before you
[1:28:53] go off glory to God before you go off
[1:28:55] and you and wandering around and making
[1:28:57] up your own religions and your own
[1:28:59] thoughts about God's word and saying
[1:29:00] well the lord gave me a word about this
[1:29:02] and this is the way we ought he said
[1:29:04] first I want you to acknowledge that the
[1:29:05] word I'm speaking to you didn't come
[1:29:07] from a man but it came from God before
[1:29:09] you sit around with your friends you
[1:29:11] come up with all the ideas about the
[1:29:12] church and how everything's ran and how
[1:29:15] everything is this and it ain't nothing
[1:29:16] but the devil and all the you better
[1:29:18] acknowledge that the first that the
[1:29:19] words that I speak unto you don't aren't
[1:29:21] words that come from a man but they're
[1:29:22] words that come from God
[1:29:24] said the first acknowledge what came
[1:29:26] from God to see it was the the dwelling
[1:29:28] of the holy spirit said Paul had those
[1:29:31] that would say they they would they
[1:29:33] would raise up and they would claim
[1:29:34] another Revelation well I've got a
[1:29:35] higher Revelation than Paul he said what
[1:29:37] do you mean came the word of God out
[1:29:39] from you or did it come to you only you
[1:29:42] got a revelation that's different than
[1:29:45] the word that God's already Vindicated
[1:29:46] he said the word came to you only I love
[1:29:49] how Paul was bold in what he believed
[1:29:50] say see the EV so the evidence of the
[1:29:52] spirit filled Christian believer is not
[1:29:54] to produce truth see where Paul warned
[1:29:56] them because they were produced they
[1:29:57] were manufacturing their own truth he
[1:29:59] said the word of God came from you it
[1:30:01] came from you only you better
[1:30:02] acknowledge something that it better
[1:30:04] line up with what I've already said
[1:30:05] because it came from God see he said now
[1:30:08] notice see the evidence of a
[1:30:09] Spirit-filled Christian believer is not
[1:30:11] to produce truth but is to receive truth
[1:30:14] and to believe it that friends that's
[1:30:15] that's that's a lot the evidence of a
[1:30:18] spirit filled believer is not to produce
[1:30:19] truth it's to receive truth and to
[1:30:22] believe it and Obey it I think the
[1:30:24] problem is today brother Mark is the
[1:30:26] devil's anointed too many men to try to
[1:30:28] produce truth but I think I I'm not here
[1:30:30] to produce anything Lord I'm just here
[1:30:32] to receive it I'm not here to make up
[1:30:34] some religion Lord I'm just here to
[1:30:36] receive what you've already said I'm not
[1:30:38] here to preach a new doctrine Lord I'm
[1:30:40] just here to take what you've are what
[1:30:41] you've already given to the church
[1:30:42] there's too many trying to produce it
[1:30:44] well you know you know I think we ought
[1:30:46] to do it this way and handle it this way
[1:30:48] but it doesn't matter doesn't matter
[1:30:49] what the word says everybody has their
[1:30:50] own idea how to handle every situation
[1:30:52] you know that that after all this is
[1:30:54] that that's an old way of doing things
[1:30:56] you know you oh God I'm going to get
[1:30:57] myself in trouble but I I know how the
[1:30:59] devil is somebody wrongs you say well
[1:31:01] I'll tell you what you just don't talk
[1:31:02] to them no more and that'll put an end
[1:31:03] to that well that's nice you can produce
[1:31:05] your own truth if you want to but let me
[1:31:07] go back to the truth of the word the
[1:31:08] Bible says go to them and make it right
[1:31:10] if you feel like there's something wrong
[1:31:12] well go and correct it and tell them you
[1:31:13] love them and put your arm around them
[1:31:15] and do something nice for them and do
[1:31:16] good to those that spitefully use you
[1:31:19] too many producing
[1:31:21] truth said but we didn't come to produce
[1:31:23] truth we come to receive truth and
[1:31:26] that's an Evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:31:28] that we' receive it and believe it and
[1:31:30] Obey it my my glory to God the evidence
[1:31:35] of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is
[1:31:37] to receive truth I think of this and I'm
[1:31:39] going to hurry and close the first age
[1:31:42] here God sends this gift of Prophecy to
[1:31:44] set the church in order brother Jared as
[1:31:46] he comes into this place we watch as the
[1:31:48] church comes all the way through from
[1:31:50] the first age to the second Church age
[1:31:52] Third Church all the way down to the
[1:31:54] age into the Le leysia where we are
[1:31:56] today and we found ourselves in this age
[1:31:59] of leoda but the Mark just like the
[1:32:01] children of Israel but we're on the last
[1:32:03] day of the March here's where we found
[1:32:05] ourselves on the last day of this great
[1:32:07] March and there here this great wall
[1:32:09] that keeps God's children from their
[1:32:11] promise I I I thought this was so
[1:32:13] powerful how many knows how many nations
[1:32:14] there were in the land of Canaan that
[1:32:16] were keeping the children of Israel out
[1:32:18] of their inheritance the Bible says in
[1:32:20] Deuteronomy there were seven of them so
[1:32:22] here was Seven Nations that were that
[1:32:24] were in this land that had all been
[1:32:25] raised up I I thought my isn't that good
[1:32:27] there was one for every age these great
[1:32:29] big old ugly Nations that were dwelling
[1:32:31] in their land of promise there was one
[1:32:32] for every age they were they were in I I
[1:32:34] know sometimes when people hear this
[1:32:35] story they take it as unfair and they
[1:32:37] say well why would God come and he would
[1:32:39] drive out a people that were already
[1:32:40] there they had already raised up
[1:32:41] children they were in this nation and
[1:32:44] you know and then God would take it away
[1:32:45] from them and give that land to somebody
[1:32:47] else you ever you ever heard people say
[1:32:48] that he said well but you realize then
[1:32:50] somebody said well God promised it to
[1:32:52] him and so so you know he he he had to
[1:32:54] give it to them and then they'll come
[1:32:55] back and go well well why why would god
[1:32:57] promise them something they didn't know
[1:32:58] that God give that land to Jacob and and
[1:33:00] to Jacob's children so you know what God
[1:33:03] was just unfair that he would do
[1:33:04] something like that but friends there's
[1:33:05] something you have to realize is that
[1:33:07] these people that were dwelling in the
[1:33:09] land of Jericho that that that that
[1:33:11] Jericho was inhabited by the Canaanites
[1:33:13] now now the Canaanites which came which
[1:33:15] came from from one Father which was ham
[1:33:17] the son of Noah and the Canaanites came
[1:33:19] from them and in that Land There was
[1:33:21] Canaanites girgashites amorites Hittites
[1:33:23] hivites jebusites and perizzites now
[1:33:26] every one of these these seven uh these
[1:33:28] Seven Nations they had their own Kings
[1:33:30] they had their own strongholds they were
[1:33:32] dwelling in this land that was promised
[1:33:34] this Canaan land that was promised to
[1:33:35] the children of Israel but notice that
[1:33:37] that whenever they were in this place
[1:33:39] there was something different about why
[1:33:40] they were called what they were called
[1:33:42] see the children of Israel when they
[1:33:43] were called a certain tribe it was
[1:33:45] because they were born to a certain
[1:33:47] tribe so if you were born born uh of
[1:33:50] Benjamin then you were of The Tribe of
[1:33:51] Benjamin because of your natural birth
[1:33:53] but but when it came to these seven
[1:33:55] tribes of the land of Canaan or these
[1:33:56] Seven Nations they were they were the
[1:33:58] descendants of Canaan and but but what
[1:34:01] made them had the name they had it was
[1:34:03] just the place that they dwelt in so it
[1:34:05] had nothing to do with their natural
[1:34:06] birth they may have been they may have
[1:34:08] been born over in Jericho but because
[1:34:10] they lived in the land of the Hittites
[1:34:12] where they were called Hittites and
[1:34:13] because they lived in the hi the hivites
[1:34:15] where they were called hivites so so
[1:34:16] brother Wesley what would happen is is
[1:34:18] sometimes well they they get tired of
[1:34:19] living over there maybe they go over to
[1:34:21] another kingdom and now they're not
[1:34:22] called a havit no more now now they're
[1:34:24] caught a hittite see it didn't matter
[1:34:25] how they were born but it was where they
[1:34:27] had fellowship at is what gave them the
[1:34:29] name that they had so there was all of
[1:34:31] these names that were in there and they
[1:34:33] were inhabiting and they were living
[1:34:35] upon the promised land and they were
[1:34:36] living upon the promises of God I
[1:34:38] thought my and here they were jumping
[1:34:40] back and forth one day there was a hii
[1:34:42] and the next day there's a jebusite and
[1:34:44] the next day they me a peri they just
[1:34:46] jump all around and just whichever
[1:34:48] theology they could get a hold of or
[1:34:50] maybe the maybe it had a little bit
[1:34:51] better food over there maybe there's a
[1:34:53] little bit better job so they just kind
[1:34:54] of bounced around from one denom or one
[1:34:56] one one one uh uh jebusite to the other
[1:34:59] but the Mark or one land to the other
[1:35:01] and all these Seven Nations that they
[1:35:03] would come but you realize that it
[1:35:04] didn't matter which one they were a part
[1:35:06] of oh I'm and I'm getting into some
[1:35:08] stuff but it didn't matter which one
[1:35:10] they were a part of sister Nisha every
[1:35:12] one of them were under the same curse
[1:35:14] because they all came from Canaan which
[1:35:16] was the son of ham and the Bible said in
[1:35:18] Genesis the 9th chapter that Noah cursed
[1:35:21] Canaan he said cursed be Canaan and the
[1:35:23] servant of servants he shall be unto his
[1:35:25] Brethren and he said but blessed be the
[1:35:27] Lord of sham that Canan shall be his
[1:35:29] servant God shall enlarge japeth and he
[1:35:32] shall dwell in the tents of Shem but
[1:35:34] Canaan shall be his servant so you know
[1:35:36] what my Bible tells me that long before
[1:35:38] there was ever an Abraham before there
[1:35:40] was ever Sarah before there was Isaac
[1:35:42] before there was Jacob before there
[1:35:44] there was Israel that God had already
[1:35:46] spoke of Canaan and because of the
[1:35:48] wickedness that was in his heart that
[1:35:49] God had brought a curse upon his life
[1:35:51] and let me tell you whenever God comes
[1:35:53] down God even reminds Abraham of it when
[1:35:55] he comes down and he gives Abraham his
[1:35:57] Covenant and he begins to speak of
[1:35:59] Abraham and he tells of his seed
[1:36:01] numbering the stars of the Heaven and
[1:36:02] the SS of the sea and he tells Abraham
[1:36:05] he said but your seed is going to go
[1:36:06] into bondage for 400 years but then
[1:36:09] they're going to come out with great
[1:36:10] substance but in that God reminds him he
[1:36:13] said but it'll come out in the fourth
[1:36:15] generation now God starts telling
[1:36:16] Abraham why it would take that long he
[1:36:19] says it'll come out in the fourth
[1:36:20] generation they shall come hither again
[1:36:23] for the iniquity of the amorites is not
[1:36:25] yet full so here sets an eternal god
[1:36:27] brother Wesley watching a people that
[1:36:30] knowing that their iniquity is growing
[1:36:31] greater and they're they're continually
[1:36:33] going further into evil and the
[1:36:35] wickedness is growing greater but God
[1:36:37] said but in the fourth generation it'll
[1:36:39] come to its high and it's coming the
[1:36:41] time when I'm going to come and I'm
[1:36:42] going to drive them and bring judgment
[1:36:43] upon them and drive them out of this
[1:36:45] land so the Bible says you know they
[1:36:47] they had great sins and matter of fact
[1:36:48] you could I was going to go through it
[1:36:50] but I don't have time but but Leviticus
[1:36:52] 18th chapter the Bible say and the land
[1:36:54] is defiled and therefore I do visit the
[1:36:57] iniquity upon it for the land itself
[1:36:59] vomit out her inhabitants so here when
[1:37:02] you look at the overthrow of these Seven
[1:37:05] Nations the driving out of them was not
[1:37:07] God being unjust but brother Jared it
[1:37:09] was God using his promised seed to bring
[1:37:13] judgment upon the nations of Canaan for
[1:37:16] their their failure to repent for their
[1:37:19] wickedness so here God would use his
[1:37:21] children to enter into this land Land Of
[1:37:23] Promise so for all this time these other
[1:37:26] nations had been raised up it didn't
[1:37:27] matter what name they were or what part
[1:37:29] they went to they they go from this and
[1:37:30] that into the other and they fed on
[1:37:32] those promises that that that wonderful
[1:37:33] land that God had created and they fed
[1:37:35] on it for a little while but God said
[1:37:37] there cometh the time there's coming a
[1:37:39] fourth generation and when this
[1:37:40] generation comes brother Mark the
[1:37:42] children of God are going to come into
[1:37:44] that land and everything that dwells in
[1:37:46] that land will be cast to and there
[1:37:48] ain't nothing going to stop them from
[1:37:49] being able to inherit it you know I see
[1:37:51] this I know when you it looks like
[1:37:53] something the wrath of God but you
[1:37:54] realize when I saw that I I brother
[1:37:56] Wesley I saw the grace of almighty God I
[1:37:59] saw the mercy of God upon the land of
[1:38:01] Canaan you say brother man how could you
[1:38:03] see Mercy when God would come in and
[1:38:05] tear down their walls and destroy their
[1:38:07] their homes and drive them out of the
[1:38:09] land let me tell you why I see Mercy
[1:38:11] because it took God 400 years to do it
[1:38:14] God gave them 400 years to repent of
[1:38:16] their wickedness 400 years to make their
[1:38:19] wrongs right you say brother man you
[1:38:21] think he' have forgave them I know he
[1:38:22] had have forgave them because the men of
[1:38:24] Nineveh were doing the same sins and the
[1:38:26] Bible said but when Jonah came into
[1:38:28] Nineveh and he began to preach the word
[1:38:29] of God that they repented of their sins
[1:38:31] and God spared the
[1:38:33] city see they had time to repent God
[1:38:36] always gives time for repentance he said
[1:38:38] but then you know that's what he does in
[1:38:40] the days of Noah he said 120 years he
[1:38:42] preached his message of mercy of an
[1:38:45] oncoming judgment he said but God in the
[1:38:47] middle of all judgment coming God warned
[1:38:49] them and God didn't just warn the people
[1:38:51] God warned the Sheep he warned the cow
[1:38:53] battle he warned every inhabitant of the
[1:38:55] land that judgment was coming but at the
[1:38:57] end I I think but then but then God came
[1:38:59] and brought judgment to them so here we
[1:39:01] standing in the in the Book of Joshua
[1:39:03] they're standing around these walls but
[1:39:05] the Mark at the end of seven days the
[1:39:07] shout goes out and the Walls Start to
[1:39:09] fall down but brings all that down down
[1:39:11] to this age I know I rushed through this
[1:39:13] but he brought us all the way down to
[1:39:15] this age he said that's what God is
[1:39:16] trying to do today he is trying to warn
[1:39:19] his people today to get away from these
[1:39:21] old ecclesiastical walls that's going to
[1:39:23] crumble in for the coming of the Lord is
[1:39:26] at hand don't you realize it friends it
[1:39:28] was the Judgment of God against the
[1:39:30] immorality and the mixed up of sins and
[1:39:33] and the homosexuality and the
[1:39:35] fornication and the things that had
[1:39:37] entered into the land of Canaan it was
[1:39:39] the natural sins of their flesh that
[1:39:41] they would allow seed with anything to
[1:39:42] come forth and now we look at it in a
[1:39:45] spiritual sense in the middle of Le O
[1:39:47] deia and spiritually the same thing they
[1:39:49] allowed any kind of seed in the church
[1:39:51] it can come from a mother mother a
[1:39:53] daughter a father an uncle don't matter
[1:39:55] where it come from they would allow it
[1:39:57] to be all mixed in and it was it was it
[1:39:59] was it was it was disgusting in the
[1:40:02] sight of God in 400 years brother Mark
[1:40:05] God watches this happen 400 years he
[1:40:07] said but the iniquity is growing R and
[1:40:09] for 400 years God builds up this Army in
[1:40:12] the middle of the land of Egypt what
[1:40:14] looked like it was slaves and what
[1:40:15] looked like they'd never be able to come
[1:40:17] out and what looked like that there'd
[1:40:19] never be nothing they were put down but
[1:40:21] God was building up an army that would
[1:40:22] drive the in inhabitants out of their
[1:40:24] land that he would not only would he
[1:40:25] bring judgment but he would but but it
[1:40:27] was the grace that he give to his
[1:40:28] children to receive their land of
[1:40:31] promise think about it and not only but
[1:40:33] Mark did they go and they and they into
[1:40:36] their Promised Land but the Bible says
[1:40:38] but he vomited out the inhabitants I ran
[1:40:40] out of time I know he said but he
[1:40:43] vomited out the inhabitants ain't that
[1:40:45] the same thing today come down to today
[1:40:47] in the middle of lay out of sea what the
[1:40:48] Bible say because you were lukewarm and
[1:40:50] neither cold nor hot I will spew you out
[1:40:53] of my mouth here right here in a
[1:40:55] spiritual world and warfare he said you
[1:40:58] say I am rich and increase with Goods I
[1:41:00] have need of nothing and knowest not
[1:41:02] that thou are wretched and miserable and
[1:41:04] poor and blind and naked you realize
[1:41:07] what the sins of the Canaanites were but
[1:41:09] the David it started with the father of
[1:41:12] Canaan that would see the nakedness of
[1:41:14] his father remember that's what brought
[1:41:16] the curse from Noah in Leviticus is it
[1:41:18] was a shame to uncover the nakedness of
[1:41:20] thy father or th thy brother thy sister
[1:41:22] andt daughter whole chapter showing the
[1:41:24] shame of nakedness but then we see this
[1:41:26] in the middle of this the shame of this
[1:41:28] nakedness in a in a spiritual world that
[1:41:30] we live in today brother Mark but notice
[1:41:32] what the Bible said Jesus says but I
[1:41:34] counsel you to buy of me a gold that's
[1:41:36] tried in a fire that you may be rich
[1:41:39] with white rment that you may be clothed
[1:41:41] and that the shame of thy nakedness does
[1:41:43] not appear my is't it something today as
[1:41:46] the music players come to realize that
[1:41:48] in that we have a covering that in the
[1:41:51] time of judgment that God would bring a
[1:41:53] cover a covering upon the church the
[1:41:56] very sin that they committed that
[1:41:57] brought judgment to them he said but but
[1:42:00] God would bring a covering today that
[1:42:02] would cover the shame of thy nakedness
[1:42:05] but the Market's really there the sins
[1:42:07] and the failures you realize why it has
[1:42:10] to cover them because those are things
[1:42:12] even though God is a God that can forget
[1:42:14] you're not and the shame of your past is
[1:42:18] always there you ever notice that you
[1:42:20] can you can read about every
[1:42:22] justification you want to you can hear
[1:42:23] the story of it going in the the bottom
[1:42:26] of the of the sea of forgetfulness and
[1:42:28] it has no end and God just forgets it
[1:42:31] but every now and then something will
[1:42:32] happen in your life that'll bring it
[1:42:33] back up somebody you always got them God
[1:42:37] love
[1:42:38] them somebody yeah I know I know what
[1:42:41] you used to be I can tell you you ain't
[1:42:44] change nothing I know what you used to
[1:42:45] be you and you get and you get to a
[1:42:48] place it ain't your fault we get into a
[1:42:50] place
[1:42:51] sometimes just get under anointings and
[1:42:54] they'll call you back to this but here
[1:42:57] God says but I'm going to give you a
[1:43:00] covering that the shame of your
[1:43:02] nakedness wouldn't appear is't that good
[1:43:05] the very thing the condemnation the very
[1:43:08] the shame of your past he said but I'll
[1:43:10] give you a covering that whenever it's
[1:43:12] brought up you know it's there you can't
[1:43:14] get rid of it or my one allow us but
[1:43:16] when it's brought up you say but Lord I
[1:43:18] have a covering I may not be able to do
[1:43:21] nothing about my past but but I thank
[1:43:23] God I have a covering this morning oh my
[1:43:26] I thank Lord that I'm been covered by
[1:43:28] the blood of Jesus Christ I I thank God
[1:43:30] that he's put on me a robe of
[1:43:32] righteousness we've been covered by the
[1:43:35] word of God even in the time of judgment
[1:43:38] brother Mark you going stand to your
[1:43:39] feet God provides a covering he said how
[1:43:41] did Abel know what to do in order to
[1:43:43] offer a proper sacrifice to God he said
[1:43:46] by faith he received the revelation of
[1:43:48] the blood Cain didn't get such a
[1:43:51] revelation even though he had the the
[1:43:53] same Commandment that Abel had you
[1:43:55] realize that he had the same commandment
[1:43:57] but he had a different Revelation he had
[1:43:59] the same commandment he had but he
[1:44:01] couldn't offer the right sacrifice
[1:44:03] because it was a revelation from God
[1:44:05] that made the difference and gave Abel
[1:44:07] eternal life and until God reveals to
[1:44:10] you that Jesus Christ is the Christ and
[1:44:13] that his blood is what cleanses you and
[1:44:15] that God is your savior you will never
[1:44:17] have eternal life it is a spiritual
[1:44:20] Revelation that does it my isn't it
[1:44:23] wonderful brother Mark that God would
[1:44:25] send a revelation in this hour to cover
[1:44:27] your
[1:44:28] nakedness cover the shame of your past
[1:44:31] it's a revelation of who you are and a
[1:44:33] revelation of who God is it's a
[1:44:35] revelation that God would say that I'm
[1:44:37] going to come I'll drive them out of
[1:44:39] this place I'll tear down every wall
[1:44:41] that they built up that would keep you
[1:44:43] out of the promise of God well I can't
[1:44:45] believe that no more oh yes you can I
[1:44:47] know men don't believe it and they may
[1:44:48] not believe you can receive your healing
[1:44:50] this morning but God tore the wall down
[1:44:52] when he said sent Joshua as a Tope of
[1:44:54] the Holy Ghost and he marched around the
[1:44:56] wall he said there's coming a time and
[1:44:58] I'm going to give you a command to shout
