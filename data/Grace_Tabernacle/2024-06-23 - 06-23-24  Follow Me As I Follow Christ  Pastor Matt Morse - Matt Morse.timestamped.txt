[42:44] what the needs are and I know my uncle's
[42:47] been battling a lot in his body so ask
[42:49] the Lord to be with him if you have a
[42:51] need on your heart this morning want you
[42:53] just lift your hand to the Lord and just
[42:55] ask him to come and also so thank you
[42:58] sis remember Sister Sandy they were they
[43:01] able to move them
[43:04] yesterday and she told me yesterday they
[43:06] were they were moving him at a certain
[43:08] time over to the hospice house and so um
[43:11] they were just waiting on a couple of
[43:13] things that come back uh so um I believe
[43:17] that was the the what had taken place so
[43:21] just remember her in prayer I know it's
[43:22] a tough thing that that she's going
[43:25] through and but I know that God is
[43:27] mindful he's never forsaken us he always
[43:29] promised he'd be a comforter and a help
[43:30] to us and you know there's some things
[43:33] part of this life that uh that we don't
[43:35] enjoy and you know I thought if God made
[43:37] this life life perfect we'd never have a
[43:39] desire to go the other side you know we
[43:42] but this just the life that we face and
[43:45] we just long for that day where we don't

[49:39] the gift of evangelism to operate in the
[49:41] body of Christ amen you still believe in
[49:44] the five-fold ministry amen I just love
[49:46] it this morning we're going to read out
[49:48] of the book of uh 1 Corinthians 11th
[49:50] chapter in the first
[49:52] verse Bible said this is Apostle Paul he
[49:54] said be you followers of me
[49:57] even as I also am of Christ and from
[50:01] that this morning I'd like to take this
[50:03] text follow me as I follow Christ and
[50:05] you can take your seats follow me as I
[50:09] follow Christ I we spoke uh last Sunday
[50:14] and we were speaking on the church
[50:16] needing uh a a leading or or the the
[50:19] nature of a True Believer and and how
[50:22] that the nature of a Believer uh would
[50:24] be would be one that would that would
[50:26] have one to follow remember the nature
[50:28] of a Believer would be that of a sheep
[50:29] and and the prophet of God say you know
[50:31] it was a strange thing that God would
[50:33] chose to represent a son on the earth a
[50:36] a creature called a lamb and and how
[50:38] that many times you say wonder why that
[50:40] he was called a lamb but God chose a
[50:41] lamb because a lamb was the meekest of
[50:44] all of the creatures upon the Earth and
[50:46] so of all the animals that God could use
[50:48] to type uh this this uh Christ he said
[50:51] there was nothing more Meek than a lamb
[50:53] but a little lamb had the right kind of
[50:55] nature it was the one that was a
[50:57] surrendered nature he would be able to
[50:59] fulfill uh the prophets and what Isaiah
[51:01] would say he said as a lamb that was
[51:03] done before his shears he open not his
[51:05] mouth and and you know brother B said
[51:07] why couldn't we have those kind of
[51:08] meetings that we used to have he said
[51:09] the way to have meetings like that is to
[51:11] just become sheep and the way I I
[51:14] believe that this morning I I I really
[51:16] believe that that's the purpose of the
[51:17] church is to be able to become she come
[51:20] sheep and and to allow God to be able to
[51:22] lead us and that's why that's why we
[51:24] come and have Wednesday night services
[51:26] like we had Wednesday night is because
[51:27] we have a church filled with the Sheep
[51:29] of God that are that are willing to
[51:31] follow the word of God and I know that
[51:33] whenever when sheep call to God guess
[51:35] what God does he always answers he hears
[51:37] the cry remember the the story that
[51:39] Jesus told about the shepherd when he
[51:41] left the 99 but he went after the one
[51:43] what was it that caused him to go it was
[51:45] a lost sheep or one that uh maybe just a
[51:47] little cry of a little lost lamb and it
[51:49] was enough to get the attention of the
[51:51] Creator God that he would that he would
[51:53] that he would leave the the fold and he
[51:55] would go out and and find that one that
[51:57] was lost and be able to bring them back
[51:58] in and and you know I think it's
[52:00] wonderful to be able to preach the Sheep
[52:02] it's easy they're they don't fight
[52:03] against you they're not criticizing the
[52:05] word they're not attacking what's being
[52:07] preached or what's being said but but
[52:09] the Sheep of God they hear the word of
[52:11] God they'll take it brother the mark
[52:13] even if sometimes it steps on their toes
[52:15] they say Amen anyway there're just
[52:16] something about sheep they they they
[52:18] just have one word it's so be it it's
[52:20] Amen it's it's Lord be it unto me it
[52:23] doesn't matter if it if it feels good
[52:25] they'll say Amen if it feels bad they'll
[52:27] say Amen if it hurts them they'll say
[52:29] Amen if it steps on their toes they'll
[52:31] say Amen because they're the sheep of
[52:33] the word of God and I believe that the
[52:34] Sheep they are made sheep are made to
[52:37] follow they're made to follow after if
[52:39] you ever had a a herd of sheep there's
[52:41] something about sheep you can't get
[52:42] behind them and you can't drive them you
[52:44] you know you can get behind cattle and
[52:46] you can drive cattle and that's how
[52:47] you'd move them across the pasture but
[52:49] when it comes to sheep sheep don't move
[52:51] the same way that cattle move and so in
[52:53] order to move sheep all it takes is a
[52:55] Good Shepherd that would go in front of
[52:57] him the Shepherd that would feed him out
[52:58] of his hand and that Shepherd as he
[53:00] would walk across then the Sheep would
[53:02] would just follow after the shepherd I
[53:03] mean isn't it something that there's
[53:05] some kind of animals that can't be
[53:06] driven that can't be pushed you can't
[53:08] you can't force them into it but but
[53:10] sheep have to be led and so God has
[53:12] called us to this I remember I remember
[53:14] uh he called us to to to be this way I
[53:16] remember when I went over to India and
[53:18] and you remember me telling the story
[53:20] but how the it just fascinated me to be
[53:22] in this city of millions of people be uh
[53:25] gathered around but here these little
[53:27] Shepherds would have their little flock
[53:28] of sheep and they're just looking for a
[53:30] patch of grass here and there to feed
[53:32] them but you go through the hustle and
[53:33] bustle of this great cities and and the
[53:35] horns honking and the chaos in the
[53:37] streets and the people screaming and the
[53:39] vendors on the side of the road and and
[53:41] trying to sell things but the Sheep
[53:43] followed after the shepherd I thought
[53:45] isn't it something there's one Shepherd
[53:46] going this way and another Shepherd
[53:47] going this way and they'll have their
[53:49] little flock following they'll have
[53:50] their little flock following and and I
[53:52] you know my little country boy couldn't
[53:54] help himself and I holled out the sheep
[53:56] hey sheep sheep hey sheep trying to get
[53:58] their they don't look up brother martin
[53:59] they don't pay no attention to you they
[54:01] don't care what's going on around they
[54:03] don't care what's going on in the rest
[54:04] of the city or the rest of the world but
[54:06] they eyes is on one thing it's on the
[54:08] shepherd and and might he just put the
[54:10] staff on the ground and he took another
[54:12] step and they would just follow after
[54:13] him I I thought that's the way it is
[54:15] with the Church of the Living God
[54:16] they're made to follow after Jesus
[54:18] Christ you realize friends that that
[54:20] God's church has always been a church
[54:22] that was led how many believes that say
[54:24] Amen you go all the way back to the book
[54:26] of or the the Book of Genesis when the
[54:28] in the days of Noah whenever God would
[54:30] destroy the Earth what did God do to
[54:32] bring the children of God out of a world
[54:34] that would be judged he sent a man by
[54:36] the name of Noah to lead them out of
[54:38] that condition he built an ark he
[54:40] preached the mercy of God and the grace
[54:42] of God and the Bible says and those
[54:44] people that would follow after the voice
[54:45] of Noah they were spared from judgment
[54:47] their lives were spared their families
[54:49] were spared because they followed after
[54:51] the voice that God sent to the age that
[54:53] they were living in in the days of Moses
[54:55] here the children of Israel or that were
[54:57] caught up in Egypt and brother Mar but
[54:59] whenever God saw that it was time for
[55:01] them to come out of that place he didn't
[55:03] just make up some mighty thing or some
[55:04] miracle to make them come out of there
[55:06] but God sent a man into into into Egypt
[55:09] and the the man was anointed of God with
[55:11] a message for the day and when he went
[55:13] into Egypt he began to call to the
[55:15] children of Israel he see he performed
[55:17] signs and wonders and brother Mah the
[55:19] people turned around they stopped
[55:21] following after Egypt they F they
[55:23] stopped following after the Taskmaster
[55:25] and they turned to Moses and they
[55:26] followed Moses right out of Egypt Into
[55:28] the Wilderness into a land that it
[55:31] looked like there was no food there was
[55:32] no water but but it didn't matter they
[55:34] were following after the leader that God
[55:36] had sent to lead the church I thought
[55:38] this is the way God has always done he's
[55:40] always LED his church somebody say amen
[55:43] God has always LED his church and and
[55:45] when the church got into their own place
[55:47] and they got into into this land of
[55:49] promise and the people wanted a a king
[55:51] to be able to be uh put over them but
[55:53] God allowed him a king but still yeah
[55:56] they were following the leadership of
[55:57] the king that great Saul that was raised
[55:59] up after a few days and and it got into
[56:02] trouble it looked like it would fall
[56:03] away but God wasn't going to let it fall
[56:05] away he raised up a little Shepherd out
[56:07] in the field I thought my isn't it
[56:08] wonderful that it was a Shepherd that
[56:10] God raised up when they got in trouble
[56:12] it was a man that was raised in a
[56:14] Sheepfold it was man that was raised on
[56:16] the on the backside of a Wilderness that
[56:18] had practice in leading God's sheep and
[56:20] God set him over the people of Israel to
[56:23] be the leader over his sheep and and and
[56:25] he led them and and all the way through
[56:27] the Bible we see this same thing they
[56:28] went from being led by David they were
[56:30] led by the prophets of God and these
[56:32] great these great prophets that God had
[56:34] called in the Old Testament they LED
[56:35] God's children all the way down to the
[56:37] greatest of prophets the Bible would say
[56:39] was a man by the name of John the
[56:41] Baptist and and when John the Baptist
[56:43] came what did he do brother Wesley but
[56:45] he led them down to the river Jordan and
[56:47] he baptized them and and and he
[56:49] introduced them to Jesus Christ I
[56:51] thought my isn't it wonderful that God's
[56:53] children have always been LED he led
[56:55] them from John the Baptist brother Mark
[56:57] and then and then came the next Prophet
[56:59] his name was Jesus after John the
[57:01] Baptist and Jesus was the greatest
[57:03] prophet of all there was no man that
[57:05] walked upon the Earth like Jesus Christ
[57:07] but what was he here for to be a
[57:09] Shepherd over the Sheep of God over the
[57:11] flock of God and he led them and the
[57:13] Bible said that when he laid down his
[57:15] life and he he was crucified and he
[57:17] resurrected on the third day and he
[57:19] ascended into heaven and then he sent
[57:21] his Spirit back upon the Earth and then
[57:23] that great holy ghost that came to the
[57:24] Earth became the lead of the children of
[57:27] God and let me tell you friends how many
[57:28] believe that the same spirit that was in
[57:30] Jesus Christ is the same spirit that
[57:32] came back in the Holy Ghost it was the
[57:34] same God that means if the works that
[57:36] Jesus done is the same works that the
[57:38] Holy Ghost done that means the same
[57:40] Prophet that he was when he was here on
[57:42] the earth is the same gift of Prophecy
[57:44] that came back upon the church on the
[57:46] day of Pentecost it was sent to lead the
[57:48] church out of the condition that they
[57:50] were in God has always LED his church
[57:52] somebody say Amen listen what Paul said
[57:55] in Romans 8 14 he said for many as are
[57:58] led by the spirit of God they are the
[58:00] sons of God how many believe that for
[58:02] many as are led by the spirit of God
[58:04] they are the sons of God now I know many
[58:06] many people have misused this scripture
[58:08] down Through the Ages but but we realize
[58:10] the intention of what Paul is saying is
[58:13] to identify that the sons of God are
[58:16] those that are led by the spirit of God
[58:17] how many see that in that scripture and
[58:19] in other words if you would take two
[58:21] groups and and you would look at one
[58:23] group and and that group was led by the
[58:25] spirit of God and they were following
[58:26] after God's spirit well then you could
[58:28] identify them well they must be the
[58:30] children of God because God is leading
[58:31] them you look at the other group and
[58:33] they're not being led by God well they
[58:34] must not be the children of God because
[58:36] God isn't leading them so Paul gives us
[58:38] this as an identifier as who are the
[58:40] sons of God he said the ones that are
[58:42] being L by the spirit of God they are
[58:44] the sons of God and you know so you see
[58:46] that many has taken this today and they
[58:49] they they they've misused it and they've
[58:51] made they made this uh to be a constant
[58:53] they'll say well they I'm a Son of God
[58:55] so they made I'm a Son of God to be a
[58:57] given or a constant can I can I I'm I'm
[58:59] a I'm a math I'm a math uh a math uh
[59:02] student so so I love to look at things
[59:04] in that way and so when you see this
[59:06] scripture brother brother Tim when you
[59:07] see this scripture that that Paul spoke
[59:10] you you you see there's a formula that
[59:11] goes with it Paul says as many as are
[59:14] led by the spirit of God they are the
[59:15] sons of God so if you looked at this in
[59:17] a math in a mathematical perspective
[59:19] maybe you put this formula on it you'd
[59:21] say the people plus the leading of the
[59:23] spirit equals the sons of God how many
[59:25] see there so you take the people and
[59:27] then you take the leading of the spirit
[59:29] and add it to the people then that
[59:31] equals the sons of God so that's the
[59:33] formula that Paul was trying to bring to
[59:35] the church but what men have done is
[59:37] they've taken that formula and changed
[59:39] the formula and they and they do all
[59:41] sorts of things and so they'll they
[59:43] they'll make anything right and say well
[59:45] I I can do this well why you do that
[59:47] because the sons of God are led by the
[59:48] spirit of God and I think you ought to
[59:49] do this and I think you ought to go this
[59:51] way and I think you ought to change this
[59:53] and I think the church ought to be this
[59:54] way and well how can you say say that
[59:56] brother because the sons of God are led
[59:58] by the spirit of God you see what
[59:59] they've done is they've taken this I'm a
[1:00:01] Son of God and made it a constant so now
[1:00:03] the formula has changed and now the
[1:00:06] formula says like this I'm a Son of God
[1:00:09] plus my actions or my beliefs which is
[1:00:11] the leading of the spirit equals the equ
[1:00:13] or my actions or beliefs equals the
[1:00:15] leading of the spirit so because I'm a
[1:00:16] Son of God no matter what I do or no
[1:00:19] matter what I say it was the leading of
[1:00:21] the spirit you see how men have Twisted
[1:00:22] it so it doesn't matter how we it
[1:00:24] doesn't matter how we acted that that
[1:00:26] way a man can come and he can lead over
[1:00:28] the church he can control you he can
[1:00:30] control how you live he can control how
[1:00:32] you how you uh talk to one another he
[1:00:34] can control every part of your life
[1:00:36] that's the spirit of the Nick and then
[1:00:38] would come in this age it would say well
[1:00:40] I'm the Son of God and because I'm the
[1:00:42] Son of God then whatever I say is the
[1:00:44] leading of the spirit but that ain't
[1:00:45] what Paul said he said but sons of God
[1:00:47] are led by the spirit of God in other
[1:00:49] words it's only a way to identify so so
[1:00:52] in reality just because you say
[1:00:54] something don't mean it's the leading of
[1:00:55] the Spirit or because because because if
[1:00:58] it's the leading of the spirit it has to
[1:01:00] be the word of God see that's the
[1:01:02] reality if it doesn't line up with the
[1:01:04] word of God that it wasn't the leading
[1:01:06] of God at all so it doesn't matter how
[1:01:08] big of a son that you I'm going to get
[1:01:09] in trouble these brothers told me I
[1:01:11] could preach it doesn't matter how big
[1:01:12] of a son that you think you are when you
[1:01:14] preach something that or you would speak
[1:01:16] something that wasn't the word of God it
[1:01:18] ain't the spirit of God that's leading
[1:01:19] you if you're if you're telling somebody
[1:01:21] and you're I know and and I'm not
[1:01:22] talking about from the pull pit but
[1:01:23] people get outside and they get in homes
[1:01:25] and they get at kitchen tables and they
[1:01:27] pick up cell phones and they begin to
[1:01:29] minister to one another but friends let
[1:01:31] me tell you if there's a spirit that's
[1:01:32] leading you to something that's outside
[1:01:34] of the word of God it ain't the spirit
[1:01:36] of God that's leading you say Well
[1:01:37] they're sons of God they may be but they
[1:01:39] may be led astray for the spirit of God
[1:01:41] will lead you to the word of God this is
[1:01:43] what Peter said he says seeing that you
[1:01:45] have purified your souls in obeying the
[1:01:48] word through the spirit so the spirit of
[1:01:50] God would cause you to be obedient to
[1:01:53] the word of God it'll only lead you to
[1:01:54] the word I I know how is today well we
[1:01:57] got a new spirit that that that's
[1:01:58] bringing me to a new word there there I
[1:02:00] know I know the uh everybody's got some
[1:02:02] new ideas or things about the word of
[1:02:04] God and and you know there's a new
[1:02:05] spirit in the land and it's bringing
[1:02:07] it's bringing some real Clarity to the
[1:02:09] word of God but listen what Peter said
[1:02:11] he said but the word of the Lord you can
[1:02:13] take that down he said but the word of
[1:02:14] the Lord endureth forever and this is
[1:02:17] the word which by the gospel is preached
[1:02:19] un you so Peter says the word of the
[1:02:21] Lord that's already preached it's not
[1:02:23] going to change it'll endure Forever
[1:02:25] This is the same word that's already
[1:02:27] been preached so any spirit that would
[1:02:29] come today brother Mark to preach
[1:02:31] another gospel than that gospel which
[1:02:33] has already been preached it couldn't be
[1:02:35] the spirit of Christ it would have to be
[1:02:37] the leading of the Antichrist Spirit you
[1:02:40] see the spirit of Christ let me can I
[1:02:41] tell you something about the spirit of
[1:02:43] Christ the spirit of Christ will never
[1:02:45] rebuke a single word of God that means
[1:02:47] you could take a scripture and you could
[1:02:48] read the scripture and the spirit of
[1:02:51] Christ will accept the scripture that
[1:02:52] you read say well I may not understand
[1:02:55] it I may not be able able to see how to
[1:02:56] put that together but it'll accept the
[1:02:58] scripture that's
[1:02:59] read the spirit of Christ it'll never
[1:03:02] rebuke scripture it'll never rebuke the
[1:03:04] word of God you can when you quote it
[1:03:06] you know what it'll do brother Wesley
[1:03:08] it'll say Amen when it steps on their
[1:03:10] toes they'll say Amen when it when it
[1:03:12] when it don't fit the way that that that
[1:03:14] my daddy taught it to me you'll say Amen
[1:03:16] why because it's the word of God and the
[1:03:18] spirit of God will never rebuke the word
[1:03:20] of God but see this word in order for it
[1:03:22] to be effective in the church it has to
[1:03:24] be it has to be mixed correctly see the
[1:03:27] see there's so many that has taken the
[1:03:29] word of God and they'll use they you
[1:03:31] take a portion of scripture you can kill
[1:03:33] anybody with it you notice you can take
[1:03:35] your a little you can take your little
[1:03:36] verse and you can just whack people over
[1:03:37] the head with it and take another verse
[1:03:38] and beat on this person a little while
[1:03:40] and take another verse and beat on this
[1:03:41] person a little while but see because
[1:03:43] the scripture are not mixed correctly
[1:03:45] it'll only kill the Bible said that the
[1:03:46] letter kill it but the spirit giveth
[1:03:48] life so there has to be there has to be
[1:03:50] a right kind of mix in the word of God
[1:03:52] or in the Church of the Living God in
[1:03:53] order for for the word to be effective
[1:03:55] or the spirit to be effective among the
[1:03:57] Believers see so instead of killing with
[1:03:59] it you you you know you you'll never be
[1:04:01] able to understand uh uh uh truth with
[1:04:04] with without the spirit of God and you
[1:04:06] know there's some things that just never
[1:04:07] mix you can take oil and water it'll
[1:04:09] never mix you can take education and the
[1:04:11] word of God it'll never mix but then
[1:04:13] there are some things that will mix and
[1:04:15] the Bible says the greatest mix that
[1:04:17] there is brother Travis when it comes to
[1:04:19] the word of God is the spirit and the
[1:04:21] word of God so when you get the right
[1:04:23] mix of the spirit of God and and you mix
[1:04:26] it with the word of God and then it'll
[1:04:27] lead you to the right thing it'll cause
[1:04:29] you to turn the page to another
[1:04:30] scripture and say but it is also written
[1:04:32] and it is also written and the word will
[1:04:35] be able to blend together why because
[1:04:37] it's the right Spirit and the right word
[1:04:39] mixed together and when you get that
[1:04:40] kind of a mix in the Church of the
[1:04:42] Living God the Right Mix will clean the
[1:04:44] church the Right Mix it'll sanctify the
[1:04:46] house of God the Right Mix it'll clean
[1:04:48] your home out and it won't be a bunch of
[1:04:50] legalism but but it'll clean every lifee
[1:04:53] it'll bring power to your life the right
[1:04:55] of the word and the spirit it'll bring
[1:04:57] Deliverance to you it'll bring the
[1:04:59] supernatural in the house of God When
[1:05:01] the Right Mix of the spirit and the word
[1:05:04] see but to follow the word it comes with
[1:05:06] a price remember the Rich Young Ruler
[1:05:09] when he came to Jesus what did he ask
[1:05:11] him he said what must I do to have
[1:05:12] eternal life so what must I do to to
[1:05:15] have and Jesus said you you got to keep
[1:05:17] the Commandments he began to speak of
[1:05:19] The Commandments and the man said well
[1:05:20] all of these things I have kept from my
[1:05:22] youth and Jesus said unto him well if
[1:05:24] you'd be perfect go sell all that you
[1:05:26] have and give it to the poor and you
[1:05:28] shall have a treasure in heaven and come
[1:05:30] and follow me I love this it comes with
[1:05:32] a cost come and follow me here I thought
[1:05:35] it it wasn't it a privilege that this
[1:05:37] man he had an interview with Jesus he
[1:05:39] had a moment to spend time with him and
[1:05:41] he would offer him such a thing as as
[1:05:44] eternal life and the Bible said but the
[1:05:45] man young man heard the saying he went
[1:05:47] away sorrowful for he had great
[1:05:49] possessions I thought here what it was
[1:05:52] he here this man he could have been a
[1:05:53] disciple like Peter or James or John or
[1:05:56] could have been a great disciple but
[1:05:57] said see here was a kid that had been
[1:05:59] trained or brought upright he had he he
[1:06:01] had been presented to Christ and to use
[1:06:04] and Christ could have used him and all
[1:06:05] the potential that he had here was a
[1:06:07] rich here was a rich young man no no
[1:06:09] doubt being a rich man he was educated
[1:06:11] and influential and and and Wealthy but
[1:06:14] he could have he could have used all of
[1:06:16] that and presented the gospel but yet he
[1:06:18] turned it down what a thing for a young
[1:06:20] boy when Jesus would say follow me he
[1:06:22] said see he had to follow someone but he
[1:06:25] was willing to follow somebody else
[1:06:27] rather than to follow Christ friends
[1:06:28] that's the same thing that we deal with
[1:06:30] today as young people you have an
[1:06:32] opportunity to either follow the
[1:06:34] influence of your friends or to follow
[1:06:35] Jesus Christ you can follow you can
[1:06:37] follow other people you he was
[1:06:39] associated with that maybe could have
[1:06:41] followed the influence of some young
[1:06:43] lady or the influence of some gang of
[1:06:44] boys that he was associated with his
[1:06:46] colleagues in school or he could follow
[1:06:48] Jesus Christ and all of his goodness yet
[1:06:51] he knew he didn't have eternal life see
[1:06:53] in order to follow Christ here Jesus
[1:06:55] Jesus immediately laid this down that in
[1:06:57] order to follow me it'll take a
[1:06:59] sacrifice in order to follow me there's
[1:07:01] going to be a price to pay in other
[1:07:03] words say what was the price to pay the
[1:07:04] price was to give up your old life the
[1:07:06] PRI price was to give up that old the
[1:07:08] old way of thinking and to become a part
[1:07:10] of the move of God brother Mark I I
[1:07:12] think God has given us a way to be able
[1:07:15] to lay down something to be able to pick
[1:07:17] something else up I I know I know if you
[1:07:19] if you ever study economics there's
[1:07:20] What's called the cost benefit analysis
[1:07:22] and what and what that means is that you
[1:07:24] would weigh the cost versus the
[1:07:26] potential reward I know we do that every
[1:07:28] day whether even well most of us do that
[1:07:30] every day our parents we want our kids
[1:07:32] to do it son you should weigh the cost
[1:07:34] or before you before you before you do
[1:07:36] something you know weigh the cost and
[1:07:37] the reward before you before you do it
[1:07:39] it it might not be a good idea but
[1:07:41] that's that's something that we that we
[1:07:43] that we subconsciously do brother Mark
[1:07:45] we what what's it going to cost me to do
[1:07:47] it and what is the what is the value or
[1:07:49] what is the reward and so here here
[1:07:52] whenever Jesus gives the cost and he
[1:07:54] says to lay it down but but notice that
[1:07:56] he didn't just give the price but he
[1:07:58] also told him what the reward would be I
[1:08:01] thought this is so good because the
[1:08:02] gospel has a price but it certainly has
[1:08:04] a reward I think sometimes the cost is
[1:08:07] what's preached so much that the reward
[1:08:09] is forgotten and what happens is when
[1:08:11] you only preach the cost and you only
[1:08:13] preach the sacrifice that has to be made
[1:08:15] and you never preach the reward then
[1:08:17] before long then then going to church
[1:08:20] becomes legalism because well this is
[1:08:22] what you have to do to be a Christian
[1:08:23] and this is what you have to do to serve
[1:08:25] God and this is what you have to do to
[1:08:27] to make it to heaven and this is what
[1:08:28] you have to do to be right and this is
[1:08:30] what you have to do to get a phone call
[1:08:31] from me and this is what you have to do
[1:08:33] to be recognized in the church and this
[1:08:35] is what you have to do to be a somebody
[1:08:37] in the house of God and this is what you
[1:08:38] have to do to have a position in God's
[1:08:40] church but friends the whole church
[1:08:42] becomes a bunch of
[1:08:44] legalism I think Satan Does It Better
[1:08:46] hello somebody I think Satan does a
[1:08:48] better job of presenting the reward over
[1:08:51] the cost because that's all satan does
[1:08:53] it shows you the reward of of being a
[1:08:55] sinner he shows you oh what a what a
[1:08:58] glorious thing that it is brother Ben
[1:08:59] was preaching on it last Sunday of what
[1:09:01] a glorious thing that it is that the
[1:09:03] benefit that that that there is to
[1:09:05] serving God versus the benefit to
[1:09:07] serving the devil I thought see what the
[1:09:09] devil does is he'll make you he'll make
[1:09:10] it look so good you go get you a bottle
[1:09:12] of alcohol and take your wife and hang
[1:09:14] out hang out with your old drinking
[1:09:16] buddies and mine It'll be such a good
[1:09:17] time and get on the radio and crank up
[1:09:19] some good country music and just sit
[1:09:21] back and and maybe sit in that
[1:09:23] atmosphere oh what a fun time it'll be
[1:09:25] but what he don't show you is on the
[1:09:27] other side is your wife with your
[1:09:28] drinking buddy or you lost up with some
[1:09:30] other woman shacked up somewhere and
[1:09:32] you've lost your family and you're
[1:09:34] wrecked up and your and your children
[1:09:36] ain't got a daddy to come home to they
[1:09:38] ain't got a mama to come home to in the
[1:09:40] middle of the night you have to come
[1:09:41] home from work and wonder where your
[1:09:43] wife is see Satan don't put it in the
[1:09:45] brochure but I think we ought to tell
[1:09:47] people the way it is and the way of sin
[1:09:49] is death it's a wrecked up life it'll
[1:09:51] never bring anything good to your life
[1:09:53] or to your home it'll only bring
[1:09:55] destruction I think that people if you
[1:09:57] was raised up in so much stuff you'd
[1:09:59] think the way we was raised would cause
[1:10:00] us to turn to Jesus Christ the things
[1:10:03] that we've seen ought to cause you why
[1:10:05] you've seen the brochure he can't hide
[1:10:07] it from you you've seen the brochure
[1:10:09] that Satan hands out but see he presents
[1:10:11] his his gospel one way but see but see
[1:10:14] you realize he builds up this great
[1:10:16] Kingdom he makes it look so much fun
[1:10:18] it's growing great in number but I've
[1:10:20] got news for you the kingdom of Satan is
[1:10:22] coming down everything he's built up
[1:10:25] it'll never lead to nothing but
[1:10:26] destruction I'm going to preach a minute
[1:10:28] whether you let me or not everything
[1:10:30] he's built up it'll come to it'll come
[1:10:32] Den not anything Satan builds up in your
[1:10:34] life it'll never last it'll never stand
[1:10:36] the test of time it'll never stand the
[1:10:38] Judgment of God for what he's built it
[1:10:40] is determined to
[1:10:42] fall I'm not undermining sacrifice I
[1:10:45] realize it takes a sacrifice in fact I
[1:10:48] I'm saying the opposite to you I believe
[1:10:50] that God demands a total sacrifice I'm
[1:10:52] not saying Don't Preach what God what
[1:10:54] God wants from you because God wants you
[1:10:56] to be willing to give your all he wants
[1:10:58] you to to be willing to be able to say
[1:11:00] God if you need my car here's my car if
[1:11:02] you need my house here's my house if you
[1:11:04] need my my money here's my money if you
[1:11:06] need my life here's my life God wants
[1:11:08] you to be willing to give your all
[1:11:09] friends let me tell you a secret if
[1:11:11] you're willing to give God all that you
[1:11:13] have then God will always make sure you
[1:11:15] have more than you need that's the kind
[1:11:18] of God that we serve are we willing to
[1:11:20] give to God are we willing to sacrifice
[1:11:22] our life unto him he wants all of it oh
[1:11:24] let me tell you what Paul said he said
[1:11:26] who you yield to is whose servant you
[1:11:29] are he made it plain to let you know
[1:11:31] that it don't matter what you're doing
[1:11:33] you're serving somebody said well I'm
[1:11:35] going to keep no you're not keeping
[1:11:36] nothing everything you have you're using
[1:11:39] for one or the other you're either using
[1:11:40] it for God or you used it for the devil
[1:11:42] nothing's just being used for yourself
[1:11:44] he said who you yield yourself to is
[1:11:46] whose servant you are whether it be of
[1:11:48] sin unto death or obedience under
[1:11:50] righteousness but Paul said but thank
[1:11:52] God that you were I love this word were
[1:11:56] thank God that you were the Servants of
[1:11:58] sin see the word he used was were and
[1:12:01] not are thank God that you were the
[1:12:03] Servants of sin but then you obeyed from
[1:12:06] your heart that form of Doctrine which
[1:12:09] was delivered unto you being made free
[1:12:11] from sin you became the Servants of
[1:12:14] righteousness for as you have yielded
[1:12:16] your members servants to uncleanliness
[1:12:18] and iniquity brought iniquity but now
[1:12:20] even so yield your members as servants
[1:12:22] to righteousness unto holiness
[1:12:26] see who Ser who you yield yourself to is
[1:12:28] whose servant that you are see there's a
[1:12:31] cost there's a sacrifice to serving God
[1:12:34] but there's also a reward you say well
[1:12:35] that reward is it eternal life let me
[1:12:37] tell you something about it can I just
[1:12:39] can I just just be free let me tell you
[1:12:40] something about eternal life do you
[1:12:42] realize that eternal life is not
[1:12:43] something that you earn it's not
[1:12:45] something that you've ever done there's
[1:12:46] nothing you've ever done in your life to
[1:12:48] be able to earn it it's not something
[1:12:49] you there's no works you could do the
[1:12:51] Bible said like this Paul said for by
[1:12:53] Grace you have been saved through faith
[1:12:55] not of yourselves it is a gift of God
[1:12:57] not as a result of your work so that no
[1:13:00] man May boast it is a gift of God it
[1:13:02] ain't nothing you've done to ever earn
[1:13:04] it this eternal life it's not a reward
[1:13:06] for your works it's not a reward for how
[1:13:08] good of a church member you are it's not
[1:13:10] a reward for all the things that you do
[1:13:12] for God that's not the reward eternal
[1:13:14] life is a free gift that's why the
[1:13:16] Jewish people they look down on the
[1:13:18] Christians and or this uh the
[1:13:20] Christianity or the modern Christianity
[1:13:22] and and the gentile people and they call
[1:13:24] them a bunch of dogs because they say
[1:13:25] they don't ever do anything to earn
[1:13:27] their salvation they've never done
[1:13:29] anything to Merit it and they they had
[1:13:31] this old friends if you look at this
[1:13:32] what's called Christianity Today I see
[1:13:34] what they feel like it's a lazy
[1:13:36] lifestyle of being called a Christian
[1:13:38] you can slop around any old way and call
[1:13:40] yourself a Christian do nothing for the
[1:13:42] Lord and expect God just to open the
[1:13:44] windows of Heaven to us and that's what
[1:13:46] they see when they look at it from the
[1:13:48] outside but friends but Believers that
[1:13:50] are acceptable to God no matter what
[1:13:52] they do or how they act they serve god
[1:13:54] without evidence this is what they see
[1:13:56] they're they don't have a life to be
[1:13:58] able to be able to to to be able to have
[1:14:00] the things of God but you see how this
[1:14:02] has been so misunderstood because our
[1:14:05] works don't give us salvation but that
[1:14:07] don't mean that we don't do Works our
[1:14:10] works don't give us salvation but the
[1:14:12] Bible says but they certainly give you a
[1:14:14] reward see because many just chalk it up
[1:14:16] with salvation's a reward but listen
[1:14:18] what Jesus said he said I work I must
[1:14:20] work the works of him that sent me while
[1:14:22] it is day the night cometh when no man
[1:14:24] can work so here Jesus says we must work
[1:14:26] while it is day we must work well why he
[1:14:29] said we must do the works of the father
[1:14:31] so why would Jesus tell us to work if it
[1:14:33] ain't going to save you why would he
[1:14:35] tell you brother Jared to to do the
[1:14:36] works of God if it's never going to save
[1:14:38] you salvation's already done it's
[1:14:40] because God rewards you for everything
[1:14:43] that you do hello somebody it means god
[1:14:46] rewards you let let's just lay it out
[1:14:47] there plain you I know how people say
[1:14:50] Well everybody's going to get the same
[1:14:51] reward but let me tell you if if that
[1:14:53] was true brother Morgan then it would
[1:14:54] take take away the law of sewing and
[1:14:56] reaping it wouldn't matter what you
[1:14:57] sewed everybody reaps the same thing
[1:14:59] because we all get the same reward I I
[1:15:01] know the parable that Jesus told in
[1:15:03] Matthew the 20th chapter remember the
[1:15:04] parable of the laborers he said they
[1:15:06] came in the morning time and to to it
[1:15:09] was at the Harvest time they came in the
[1:15:10] morning to hire laborers into his
[1:15:12] Vineyard and he offered them a penny to
[1:15:14] work for the day and they agreed on it
[1:15:16] and they went out to work and then later
[1:15:17] in the day another came by or they went
[1:15:20] out into the market and they found those
[1:15:21] that had no work and said are you are
[1:15:23] you not working well no man is hired he
[1:15:25] said well come and help us cuz there's a
[1:15:26] great harvest he said I'll give you I'll
[1:15:28] give you a penny so they came to work
[1:15:30] and then at 6:00 they came again and at
[1:15:32] 9:00 they came again in the 11th Hour
[1:15:35] they came again and there were still
[1:15:36] servants that had no work and they
[1:15:38] brought them and said well we'll put you
[1:15:39] to work and put and they gave him a
[1:15:41] penny and the Bible says at the end of
[1:15:42] all of the day's work every man lined up
[1:15:45] in order to receive his pay and the last
[1:15:47] was first one to receive pay and when
[1:15:49] the last one he received his Penny and
[1:15:51] the next one received his Penny the next
[1:15:53] one received his Penny and the next one
[1:15:55] received a penny when it got down to the
[1:15:56] first that had been there laboring all
[1:15:58] day they were angered at the master and
[1:16:00] said how can you give them the same
[1:16:02] thing that you have given unto us and
[1:16:04] the master said to them he said I agreed
[1:16:06] to give you that and you agreed to work
[1:16:08] for it so how can you call me not good
[1:16:10] when I've done everything that I said i'
[1:16:11] do and I can give to anybody whatever I
[1:16:14] want to give them because I'm the master
[1:16:16] and the first shall be last but you
[1:16:17] realize that this Parable brother Mark
[1:16:19] it was showing us that the Gentile
[1:16:21] believer had what the Jews had it would
[1:16:24] show us that God God's chosen people
[1:16:26] that would be able that that that for
[1:16:27] thousands of years that God had led this
[1:16:29] nation and God had given them this great
[1:16:32] this great thing but it wasn't just for
[1:16:34] the Jews but Jesus was showing us that
[1:16:36] it was even for the gentile people also
[1:16:38] and they would be able to receive the
[1:16:39] same reward but remember said see he
[1:16:41] said see that that's what happened today
[1:16:43] with the Gentiles he said the seventh
[1:16:45] Angel's message was to open the mystery
[1:16:47] of the seals calling the 11th Hour
[1:16:50] Gentile workers to receive the same pay
[1:16:52] that the first hour workers got I I know
[1:16:54] this sounds contrary to what I said
[1:16:56] while ago but I'm building something he
[1:16:57] said they'll receive the first pay that
[1:16:59] the first workers got now Jesus Jesus
[1:17:01] taught it he said here here some would
[1:17:03] get paid remember all the way down they
[1:17:04] all received it he said but it's so
[1:17:06] perfectly how the first our Messengers
[1:17:08] came with the word with the gospel with
[1:17:10] the truth they came in at the day of
[1:17:12] Pentecost but then there came a Dark Age
[1:17:14] and it blocked them out and then at the
[1:17:16] middle of the day Martin Martin Luther
[1:17:18] and that group came in and they did
[1:17:20] their work and then and then towards the
[1:17:21] end of the day here comes Wesley but
[1:17:23] then it come to the east evening time
[1:17:25] message and they had to receive the same
[1:17:28] thing that they did at the beginning he
[1:17:30] say see the evening time message was to
[1:17:32] restore back again and to bring back
[1:17:34] that same thing again so brother Mark
[1:17:36] the evening light it wasn't meant to
[1:17:38] idolize some man it wasn't meant to bow
[1:17:41] down to some man in the evening time it
[1:17:43] wasn't meant to worship some man it
[1:17:45] wasn't to to become subject to somebody
[1:17:47] but there was one purpose for that
[1:17:49] evening L brother Wesley it was to cause
[1:17:51] people to dig back into the word of God
[1:17:54] and to receive the same pay that the
[1:17:56] early church received I thank God that
[1:17:58] there's somebody here this morning that
[1:18:00] could catch it that the Church of the
[1:18:01] Living God is supposed to receive the
[1:18:03] same thing that they received on the day
[1:18:05] of Pentecost and I have news for you
[1:18:07] this morning I think it's about time for
[1:18:09] payday I think it's time for the Church
[1:18:11] of the Living God to receive what was
[1:18:13] promised her I think it's time that the
[1:18:15] 11th our servant would come and collect
[1:18:17] what God has promised to the church by
[1:18:19] the Bible it's time it's time to collect
[1:18:23] it's time to to stop living away and and
[1:18:25] poverty and here in brother Mark and
[1:18:26] barely getting by in this age of leosia
[1:18:29] but God has promised you something and
[1:18:31] it's time to collect what he promised
[1:18:32] we're living at the end of an age we're
[1:18:34] living at a Rapture age we're living in
[1:18:36] an age where the Bible said that we
[1:18:37] ought to be ready and I think it's time
[1:18:39] that we collect the reward for the labor
[1:18:41] that we have been laboring for it's the
[1:18:44] Rapture age it's the time to receive
[1:18:47] what God has promised you listen listen
[1:18:49] what what what Peter said he said unto
[1:18:51] them behold remember he said to
[1:18:54] answering Peter Jesus said he said
[1:18:56] behold we have forsaken all we followed
[1:18:58] you what shall we receive this is what
[1:19:01] Peter the Jewish asked asked Jesus we
[1:19:03] followed you we forsaken all what shall
[1:19:04] we receive and Jesus said unto them
[1:19:06] verily I say unto you you that have
[1:19:08] followed me in the Regeneration when the
[1:19:11] son of man shall sit in the Throne of
[1:19:12] his glory you shall sit upon 12 Thrones
[1:19:15] judging the 12 tribes of Israel oh my
[1:19:18] you mean God would Elevate one man over
[1:19:21] another you mean you mean God would take
[1:19:24] one man and give him a higher reward
[1:19:26] than he would give another man I know
[1:19:27] this is the society we live in
[1:19:29] everything's equal you mean God would
[1:19:31] allow them to sit on a throne judging
[1:19:34] over the children of Israel he he would
[1:19:36] raise them up to another place and
[1:19:37] Elevate them and give them a higher
[1:19:39] reward let me tell you friends it wasn't
[1:19:41] just for Peter and The Disciples of the
[1:19:43] old day for Jesus went on to say and
[1:19:46] everyone somebody say everyone I know
[1:19:49] it's quiet this morning but everyone
[1:19:51] that has forsaken houses or brother or
[1:19:53] sisters or father father or mother or
[1:19:55] wife or children or lands for my name's
[1:19:58] sake shall receive a h hundredfold and
[1:20:01] shall inherit everlasting life for as
[1:20:03] many as are first shall be last and last
[1:20:05] shall be first let me tell you what it's
[1:20:07] a promise of it's a promise that God
[1:20:10] will reward you for everything that you
[1:20:12] ever give to him there ain't one thing
[1:20:14] you can ever do for the Gospel of Jesus
[1:20:16] Christ that God won't reward you for he
[1:20:18] said if you forsake a house I'll give
[1:20:20] you 100 fold if you forsake lands I'll
[1:20:22] give you 100 fold if you forsake family
[1:20:25] I'll give you 100 fold if you forsake
[1:20:27] money I'll give you 100 fold God will
[1:20:29] never leave you without it was a promise
[1:20:32] to the church in the last day my you
[1:20:34] read that Parable again after hearing
[1:20:36] that scripture you see it's showing us
[1:20:38] that we will received the same promise
[1:20:41] that your Jews had but he will but
[1:20:44] you'll also receive award a reward a
[1:20:46] great reward based on what you give
[1:20:50] isn't it something that our works mean
[1:20:51] something to God he'll always reward you
[1:20:54] why would Jesus put a number on it he'll
[1:20:55] give you a hundred times what you give
[1:20:58] aund times what you forsake why would he
[1:21:00] why would he put that see that that that
[1:21:02] stops me from looking at this saying
[1:21:04] well I'm just a Christian so I'm praise
[1:21:06] the Lord I'm gonna go sit over on a rock
[1:21:07] and I'm gonna have eternal life and you
[1:21:09] know what I believe that if you got
[1:21:10] saved and you and and you was really
[1:21:12] saved and gave your heart to the Lord
[1:21:14] that you could do just that and it would
[1:21:15] never take away your salvation on but he
[1:21:18] said but there's a work to do and I'll
[1:21:20] reward you for the works I don't know it
[1:21:23] makes me want to do something
[1:21:25] makes me want to do something for the
[1:21:26] Lord Jesus said blessed are you when men
[1:21:29] will revile you and persecute you and
[1:21:30] shall say all manner of evil against you
[1:21:32] for my name's sake rejoice and be
[1:21:35] exceedingly glad for great is your
[1:21:37] reward in heaven just because they talk
[1:21:40] about you he'll give you reward for it
[1:21:42] they'll make they'll say evil statements
[1:21:44] about you he said but you'll be rewarded
[1:21:45] in heaven for they persecuted the
[1:21:47] prophets which were before you and
[1:21:49] you're the salt of the earth see
[1:21:50] sacrifice don't come without reward
[1:21:53] there's a reward in heaven how many
[1:21:54] believe that Jesus said moreover when
[1:21:56] you fast don't be as the Hypocrites with
[1:21:58] a sad countenance and they disfigure
[1:21:59] their faces that they appear unto men to
[1:22:01] fast and he said I say unto you they
[1:22:03] have their reward but when you fast
[1:22:05] anoint thy head and wash thy face I oh
[1:22:08] God isn't it something about the people

[1:22:25] Lord don't do it like they do it you do
[1:22:27] it in privately and he'll reward you
[1:22:29] openly it's a it's a sincere heart that

[1:23:01] Lord and we know that our reward is
[1:23:03] waiting us and and we ain't going to not

[1:23:09] didn't get elevated high enough or we
[1:23:10] didn't get recognized in the service but
[1:23:12] I thank God there's some people that
[1:23:14] just come and do the service for the
[1:23:15] Lord and they do their work for God and
[1:23:17] they know there's a reward that's
[1:23:19] waiting for them my get L land she said
[1:23:22] I'll reward you openly where is this
[1:23:24] reward Jesus said lay not up for
[1:23:26] yourselves Treasures upon the Earth
[1:23:28] where moth and rust do corrupt where
[1:23:30] thieves break through and steal but lay
[1:23:32] yourselves Treasures in Heaven this is
[1:23:35] where the treasure is he said there
[1:23:36] ain't no rust no moth and thieves can't
[1:23:38] break through and steal for where your
[1:23:40] treasure is there will your heart be
[1:23:42] also brother Mar God has given us a
[1:23:44] reward it's an everlasting reward it
[1:23:47] can't fade away it it don't lose value
[1:23:50] it don't nothing but but increase it
[1:23:52] never decreases God just piles it on on
[1:23:54] and one day when you get over on the
[1:23:56] other side this this Earthly mind will
[1:23:58] never be able to Fathom the reward that
[1:24:00] God has given you for the persecution
[1:24:02] that you face for the people that walk
[1:24:04] by you and turn up their nose and they
[1:24:06] wouldn't shake their hand because of
[1:24:07] what you believe but friends one day God
[1:24:09] will give you a reward for it you just
[1:24:11] stand your ground and let him build up
[1:24:13] the reward you just stand on the truth I
[1:24:16] say God pile it up build a mountain of
[1:24:18] reward for the Saints of the Living God
[1:24:20] that'll stand true to his word it's an
[1:24:23] everlasting reward
[1:24:25] oh let me tell you Paul preached the
[1:24:26] same thing that Jesus did he said for
[1:24:28] there's no other Foundation can any man
[1:24:30] lay that is laid which is Christ Jesus
[1:24:32] If any man build upon his foundation
[1:24:34] gold or silver or stones or wood or hay
[1:24:36] or stubble Every Man's work will be made
[1:24:38] manifest for the day shall declare
[1:24:40] because it shall be revealed by fire and
[1:24:42] the fire shall try every man's work and
[1:24:44] if any man's work abide that he has
[1:24:46] built thereon he shall receive a what a
[1:24:50] reward in other word we build spiritual
[1:24:52] things and we'll be rewarded and that
[1:24:55] spiritual thing that we build it'll
[1:24:57] it'll stand the test of time it'll stand
[1:24:59] the fire of judgment he said for if any
[1:25:01] man's work could be burn he shall suffer
[1:25:03] loss CU that's all he did with his work
[1:25:05] but I love how Paul lays this in he said
[1:25:07] but he himself shall still be saved he
[1:25:11] didn't take away his salvation but he
[1:25:13] just didn't receive the reward the other
[1:25:14] guy did because all of his Works were
[1:25:17] done but the market was for natural
[1:25:19] things and Paul said it'll all be burnt
[1:25:22] it'll all be of nothing but he'll still
[1:25:24] be saved but I thank God he shows us a
[1:25:27] way that our treasure will be put
[1:25:30] somewhere that it would it would last
[1:25:32] our Treasures we build on this Earth
[1:25:34] brother Wesley they'll be lost but our
[1:25:36] treasure in heaven will be forever how
[1:25:38] many believe that it's an everlasting
[1:25:40] reward Brother David it's an Ever it's
[1:25:42] an everlasting life it's joy unspeakable
[1:25:44] it's a life without heartache and a life
[1:25:46] without pain and trial and sickness and
[1:25:49] death it's a reward that you that you'll
[1:25:51] never even be able to
[1:25:53] fathom see these rewards you think about
[1:25:55] the disciples they got rewarded the
[1:25:57] greatest the greatest possessions the
[1:25:59] greatest position they got they got the
[1:26:01] greatest blessing but that ain't what
[1:26:02] Jesus said let me tell you what Jesus
[1:26:04] said whenever Thomas came to him
[1:26:06] remember when they were he walked into
[1:26:07] the room and they didn't believe who he
[1:26:09] was and old Thomas D he said Thomas but
[1:26:11] reach in here and feel the nail scars
[1:26:13] and he felt the the scar in his side and
[1:26:15] he said but then he believed it was him
[1:26:17] and Jesus said to him he said Thomas
[1:26:19] because you have seen me you have
[1:26:20] believed and blessed are they but
[1:26:22] blessed are they that have not not seen
[1:26:25] and yet they have believed butam say See
[1:26:27] Jesus is Alive and he's among the people
[1:26:29] today I know he's here right now he's
[1:26:31] here and he lives you might not see him
[1:26:33] with a Corporal body but but but he's
[1:26:35] still here you might not be able to
[1:26:37] touch him but he's still here you may
[1:26:39] not be able to talk to him lift to ear
[1:26:41] but he's still here he said that's why
[1:26:43] he said to Thomas how much greater is
[1:26:45] their reward who has never seen me but
[1:26:48] they can believe oh friends think about
[1:26:50] it if the reward that the disciples got
[1:26:52] was great for those that seen him then
[1:26:54] what about you this morning for those
[1:26:56] that walk with him if they got that
[1:26:58] great of a reward then what about you he
[1:27:00] said for greater is your reward that can
[1:27:02] believe that has not seen some things
[1:27:05] you might not understand but you say I
[1:27:07] still believe it well great is your
[1:27:09] reward some things you might not be able
[1:27:11] to explain but I still believe it great
[1:27:13] is your reward some I I may not be able
[1:27:15] to I may not be able to teach it to
[1:27:17] somebody else but but I still believe it
[1:27:19] well great is your reward why is your
[1:27:22] reward so great that makes I don't know
[1:27:24] I don't know why I don't do that to
[1:27:25] y'all but it makes me want run all over
[1:27:26] this building that God would give you a
[1:27:28] greater reward just for being a Believer
[1:27:31] just for being a Believer I wasn't there
[1:27:33] when they when they walked on the shores
[1:27:34] of Galilee I didn't carry his purse I I
[1:27:37] didn't I didn't pack pack his pack his
[1:27:39] sandals I didn't kneel down and wash his
[1:27:41] feet but he said a greater reward you'll
[1:27:43] receive just for believing and having
[1:27:45] not seen there's a great reward that
[1:27:48] lays for
[1:27:50] you following Jesus comes with a price
[1:27:55] but it comes with a great
[1:27:56] reward see what is this great sacrifice
[1:27:59] God
[1:28:00] requires should I donate all my money
[1:28:03] should I give all my time just pour it
[1:28:05] all in maybe that'll be it well anything
[1:28:07] you do it'll be rewarded but listen what
[1:28:10] God really wants he wants obedience to
[1:28:12] the word of God Bible says obedience is
[1:28:15] better than sacrifice listen what watch
[1:28:18] when he called Peter do I got a few
[1:28:20] minutes he said unto them follow me and
[1:28:22] I will make you Fishers of me men you
[1:28:24] notice what happened the Bible says and
[1:28:26] straight away they left their Nets and
[1:28:28] they followed him you know what that
[1:28:29] shows you obedience to the call of God
[1:28:32] he called them and stayed away they left
[1:28:33] their Nets and they followed him and he
[1:28:35] going went from there and he saw two
[1:28:37] brothers James and Son of zebede and
[1:28:39] John's brother and when they came to
[1:28:41] them they were mened their Nets and
[1:28:42] Jesus called them and the Bible says and
[1:28:44] immediately they left the ship and their
[1:28:46] father and they followed him see it was
[1:28:48] a call of God and it was obedience to
[1:28:51] the call of Jesus Christ is what made
[1:28:53] them disciples see that's what a
[1:28:55] disciple is a disciple is one who
[1:28:57] follows that's what Jesus has called us
[1:28:59] to be in this age he's called us to be
[1:29:02] Disciples of Jesus Christ you can read
[1:29:04] in Matthew the 8th chapter Jesus said
[1:29:06] unto them follow me and let the B dead
[1:29:08] bury the dead Matthew 16 he said to the
[1:29:11] disciples If any man will come after me
[1:29:12] let him deny himself take up his cross
[1:29:14] and follow me in John the 10th chapter
[1:29:16] he said my sheep hear my voice I know
[1:29:18] them and they follow me see so to follow
[1:29:21] him would be would would make you a
[1:29:23] disciple of Jesus Christ and being a
[1:29:25] disciple it has a reward but it also has
[1:29:29] a
[1:29:30] commission I know I know this is it may
[1:29:33] not be fired up here but it has a
[1:29:36] commission go into the world and preach
[1:29:38] the gospel that was the commission that
[1:29:40] he gave to us butam said and he don't
[1:29:42] change that if he still got disciples
[1:29:44] today they'll still have the same
[1:29:45] commission go into all the world and
[1:29:47] preach the gospel and these signs shall
[1:29:49] follow them that that believe it'll
[1:29:50] never change our commission is the same
[1:29:52] brother Ben it'll it'll be the same as
[1:29:54] it was to them and go into the world and
[1:29:55] preach the gospel let me ask you this if
[1:29:57] our commission is the same what was the
[1:29:59] purpose of the preaching of the Gospel
[1:30:01] it was to call others to follow Christ
[1:30:04] that was the purpose of them so the call
[1:30:06] that you were called with is the same
[1:30:08] call that you go forth with so he said
[1:30:11] come and follow me so then he said I
[1:30:14] give you a call now you go forth and
[1:30:15] preach the gospel that gospel is the
[1:30:17] same call so your call is the same call
[1:30:19] that Jesus gave you come and follow me
[1:30:21] now you see the words that Paul spoke
[1:30:23] was these very words he said follow me
[1:30:26] as I follow Christ see sometimes read
[1:30:29] that people think it's hard to follow
[1:30:31] well Paul was trying to get people to
[1:30:32] follow after him and Paul was trying to
[1:30:34] be the one that that they wouldn't that
[1:30:36] they that he'd be the the intermediary
[1:30:38] between them and God but he said follow
[1:30:40] me as I follow Christ how important was
[1:30:42] Paul's request to the church see because
[1:30:45] because what you call someone to is
[1:30:47] whose disciple that you are and Paul
[1:30:49] made this plain he said follow me as I
[1:30:51] follow Christ see because if you was a
[1:30:54] disciple of a Baptist Church you'd say
[1:30:56] come and follow me and I'll make a
[1:30:58] Baptist out of you come and follow me to
[1:31:00] the Baptist Church and sign we'll get
[1:31:02] you a membership card and then then you
[1:31:03] can be a Baptist if you're if you're a
[1:31:05] disciple of a Methodist will come follow
[1:31:07] me and become a Methodist if you're a
[1:31:09] disciple of of a presbyterian or a
[1:31:11] Pentecost come follow me you can be a
[1:31:12] Pentecost he said but but but see but
[1:31:14] what but what a disciple is is is is he
[1:31:17] calls someone to whose disciple that
[1:31:19] they are so so what if they would call
[1:31:21] to the church well what would a disciple
[1:31:23] of Jesus Jesus Christ point you to he
[1:31:25] would point you to the same place that
[1:31:27] Jesus pointed you to so what was it that
[1:31:29] Jesus pointed you to Jesus said he said
[1:31:32] except the corn of wheat falls into the
[1:31:34] ground it'll abide alone he said but if
[1:31:36] it will die then it'll bring forth much
[1:31:38] fruit you see where Jesus pointed when
[1:31:40] they asked Jesus about himself brother
[1:31:42] Mark he pointed to his own death he said
[1:31:44] except the corn of wheat would fall into
[1:31:46] the ground brother I love a prophet he
[1:31:48] picked that up he said see where Jesus
[1:31:49] pointed he said your life and his life
[1:31:52] will only find each other it won't be at
[1:31:54] a church it won't be in a building it
[1:31:56] won't be in a Creed it won't be in good
[1:31:58] works but it'll only be in the cross
[1:32:00] where you are crucified with him that's
[1:32:02] where you'll find Christ you'll never
[1:32:04] find Christ by doing better you'll never
[1:32:06] find Christ by turning another page
[1:32:08] you'll never find Christ by start by
[1:32:10] starting a new life you won't find
[1:32:12] Christ there you won't find him in a
[1:32:13] Manger you won't find him in a
[1:32:15] confession boot but you won't find him
[1:32:17] in a Creed or in a fable you won't find
[1:32:19] Christ but you'll only find Christ in
[1:32:22] death Jesus pointed that and any true
[1:32:24] disciple of Christ will point to the
[1:32:26] same thing the only place you'll ever
[1:32:28] find Christ it ain't the church it ain't
[1:32:30] Grace Tabernacle that ain't what we're
[1:32:31] trying to get people to but it's Jesus
[1:32:33] Christ it's a life with Jesus Christ
[1:32:36] that you can go to this place of death
[1:32:38] and you can meet him at the cross and
[1:32:39] brother said when you come to this place
[1:32:41] and you meet him there he said your life
[1:32:43] and his life will find each other that's
[1:32:46] where you find Jesus Christ they'll find
[1:32:48] each other and you'll become a servant
[1:32:50] of him you'll only find him in his death
[1:32:53] in a true servant will take you to him
[1:32:55] you say well where is he he's in his
[1:32:58] word isn't that what the Bible said the
[1:33:00] Bible says in the beginning was the word
[1:33:01] the word was with God and the Word was
[1:33:03] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:33:05] dwelt Among Us in other words the logos
[1:33:07] of God was made flesh and it came to
[1:33:10] this earth and he walked upon this Earth
[1:33:11] and that logos of God called people to
[1:33:14] come and follow him and brother said
[1:33:16] that same word today Never Dies it's
[1:33:19] still a challenge to every young man and
[1:33:21] every young woman follow me
[1:33:24] it's still the same call the word that
[1:33:26] called on the day of Pentecost is the
[1:33:28] word that's calling forth today it ain't
[1:33:30] some man saying come and follow me and
[1:33:32] come after me it's the same word that
[1:33:34] came out of the mouth of Jesus it's the
[1:33:36] same word that came out of the mouth of
[1:33:37] Paul it's the same word that came out of
[1:33:39] the mouth of William brandom it's the
[1:33:41] same word that's being preached here
[1:33:42] today come and follow me as I follow
[1:33:45] Jesus Christ the word is calling us to
[1:33:49] come and follow what's a big difference
[1:33:51] from what the world has done today you
[1:33:53] these dis to I'm going to get myself in
[1:33:55] trouble the disciples today ain't like
[1:33:57] the Disciples of old the disciples today
[1:33:59] they'll bring you to a church and teach
[1:34:00] you a Creed make you memorize something
[1:34:02] take you to a Christmas party see Santa
[1:34:04] Claus and Easter money and all this
[1:34:06] stuff or bring you to an organization
[1:34:08] but Christ brought them to the Cross
[1:34:11] except a corn of wheat would fall into
[1:34:13] the ground when they come to meet him
[1:34:14] this was his answer except a corn of
[1:34:16] wheat would fall into the ground he
[1:34:17] would abide alone Christ led him to the
[1:34:20] Cross said and when you get a real
[1:34:21] disciple that appoint you to Christ
[1:34:24] Christ will bring you to the Cross where
[1:34:25] you are crucified with him and his
[1:34:27] eternal life and your life will meet
[1:34:29] together and your life will die and
[1:34:31] you'll take on his eternal life and
[1:34:33] you're a Son of God what a difference
[1:34:35] from the Disciples of old and The
[1:34:38] Disciples of today friends I thank God
[1:34:41] for some true disciples today that'll
[1:34:43] still lead you to Jesus Christ I thank
[1:34:46] God for some real men and women that'll
[1:34:48] still preach the gospel not to build a
[1:34:50] church and not to build a name for their
[1:34:52] s or not to make yourself look like some
[1:34:54] big somebody but brother Mark to lead
[1:34:56] you to Jesus Christ there's a people
[1:34:59] today that are disciples they're
[1:35:00] following the reality of a living
[1:35:03] God a word that's still alive it's a
[1:35:06] living bride following a Living Word
[1:35:08] they're worshiping a living God said I
[1:35:10] don't F I'm not worshiping a Jew I don't
[1:35:12] worship a god when I wor but I worship
[1:35:15] God when I worship Jesus Christ I don't
[1:35:17] worship some fiction or some kind of
[1:35:19] historical thing I worship Jesus Christ
[1:35:22] in the presence of Jesus Christ right
[1:35:24] now which is his word that's manifested
[1:35:27] in this age so if you want to follow
[1:35:29] Christ or ain't but one way to do it is
[1:35:30] to follow God's word that has been
[1:35:33] manifested that's the way to follow him
[1:35:35] so that why that's what Christ is he's
[1:35:37] here in the form of his word and a true
[1:35:40] servant listen a true servant would take
[1:35:42] you to him and I know they say well
[1:35:44] Christ is on the Earth today a real
[1:35:46] servant would take you to him that's
[1:35:47] true he said but where is he Christ is
[1:35:49] here in the form of the word and the
[1:35:51] word is what brings life because he is
[1:35:54] the word and Christ is the word yes sir
[1:35:56] he is the word himself and the true
[1:35:58] servant will always take you to the word
[1:36:00] of God say what word is it brother Mark
[1:36:03] it's the word with a true interpretation
[1:36:06] it's the word of God that's been
[1:36:07] manifested today that's why there was so
[1:36:09] much Supernatural that was surrounding
[1:36:11] brother braham's Ministry you think
[1:36:13] about this because it would cause you to
[1:36:16] follow a messenger to Christ why would
[1:36:19] God bring gifts and in the spirit of
[1:36:21] Prophecy and Supernatural upon someone's
[1:36:24] life it was the cause it was a it it was
[1:36:26] the purpose was to attract the attention
[1:36:28] of people that the messenger could lead
[1:36:30] you to Christ as any true Messenger
[1:36:32] would I'd be a false messenger if I got
[1:36:34] up here and say you need to come to my
[1:36:35] church and and you need to you need to
[1:36:37] give us money and you need to support
[1:36:39] it'd be a false messenger but a true
[1:36:40] Messenger says you need to surrender to
[1:36:42] Christ you need to follow the will of
[1:36:44] God in your life you you need to allow
[1:36:46] God to lead you you need to be led by
[1:36:47] the holy spirit for the sons of God are
[1:36:49] led by the spirit of God but he had that
[1:36:52] Supernatural in his life I'm going to
[1:36:54] close but he had that Supernatural in
[1:36:56] his life for the purpose brother Jared
[1:36:58] it was it it would it would cause you to
[1:37:00] look to him just like Paul Paul worked
[1:37:03] miracles it caused you to look to him
[1:37:04] and it caused Paul to say follow me as I
[1:37:06] follow Christ not to not to build Paul
[1:37:08] not to build attention to him and
[1:37:10] brother Bram didn't do this didn't do it
[1:37:11] either he never done it to build his own
[1:37:13] name or to draw attention to himself but
[1:37:15] he said but to follow Jesus Christ
[1:37:17] that's a true Messenger of God that app
[1:37:19] point you to Christ my think about it
[1:37:22] what was it it was the The Word Alive in
[1:37:25] human flesh
[1:37:26] again pointing you to the reality of the
[1:37:29] resurrection of Jesus Christ can I tell
[1:37:31] you what I saw in this briefly as the
[1:37:33] music players would come in every age
[1:37:37] Christ has presented himself to every
[1:37:39] Church in every age he comes this same
[1:37:42] way you know it's how he presented him
[1:37:44] brother Mark he said he that hath an ear
[1:37:46] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:37:48] the church every age he presents himself
[1:37:50] to the church and under the messenger of
[1:37:52] every Church he spoke to every church
[1:37:55] and then when he come to this last age
[1:37:57] in Le oia here stands a church this is
[1:38:00] what I saw when I read this here stands
[1:38:02] a church that the Bible said was rich
[1:38:04] and increased with
[1:38:06] Goods but God would come in the form of
[1:38:09] a messenger just like he done to every
[1:38:13] church and he would speak to them I
[1:38:15] thought my hear this can I call her this
[1:38:19] this Rich Young
[1:38:20] church that met him
[1:38:24] and they have an opportunity in the
[1:38:25] middle of this this Rich Young church
[1:38:27] that that had been experienced the the
[1:38:30] the the outpouring of
[1:38:32] Pentecost began to rise up and hear that
[1:38:35] gift of of the Holy Ghost came right
[1:38:38] into the middle of where they are
[1:38:40] brother Mark and you know one day there
[1:38:42] was this group of businessmen they went
[1:38:44] down into a meeting
[1:38:46] and brother Brown preaches this message
[1:38:48] to
[1:38:49] him come follow
[1:38:52] me here they were those that had M
[1:38:55] multi-millionaires and made great
[1:38:57] Investments building up these great
[1:38:58] Pentecostal organizations I thought
[1:39:01] friends if they could only see what was
[1:39:03] being presented to them that
[1:39:04] day the word had come alive the super
[1:39:09] natural had come alive the power of God
[1:39:11] had come alive and here that same Jesus
[1:39:14] that spoke before was speaking through a
[1:39:16] man again the same Spirit it was the
[1:39:18] same holy ghost that said come follow me
[1:39:22] wasn't trying to get them to to follow
[1:39:23] after old man but it was the same words
[1:39:25] that Paul spoke come follow me as I
[1:39:28] follow Christ brother Mark you know what
[1:39:30] I saw I saw that rich young church that
[1:39:34] was sitting there like the Rich Young
[1:39:36] Ruler was that day and saying what must
[1:39:38] I do to have eternal life and that
[1:39:41] messenger said to her if I will be
[1:39:43] perfect and sell all that thou have and
[1:39:45] give it to the poor you shall have
[1:39:47] treasure in heaven and come and follow
[1:39:49] me I'll make you a glorious Church
[1:39:52] you'll be a spy you you you you'll be a
[1:39:54] church without a spot or a wrinkle I
[1:39:56] I'll raise you up above every Church
[1:39:58] there there'll never be a church to ever
[1:40:00] touch what you'll be able to do with the
[1:40:01] spirit of
[1:40:03] God but the young
[1:40:05] Church they heard the saying and she
[1:40:08] went away
[1:40:09] sorrowful because she had great
[1:40:12] possessions great
[1:40:14] followings great wealth great Cathedrals
[1:40:18] that she had
[1:40:19] built and she knew that if I was to give
[1:40:22] up something like that I'd have to give
[1:40:24] up my
[1:40:25] reputation if I'd follow something can
[1:40:27] you imagine those men in that day I'm
[1:40:29] preaching to you now can you imagine the
[1:40:31] men in that day of Paul what they' had
[1:40:33] to give up to follow after Paul I I give
[1:40:36] up my membership in the synagogue to
[1:40:39] come follow after Paul and Paul's wanted
[1:40:42] he's a wanted they got wanted posters of
[1:40:44] him over how could I follow after a man
[1:40:46] like that I'd have to give up my
[1:40:48] membership I I'd have to give up my my
[1:40:50] status in society people would look down
[1:40:52] on me if I followed him this Rich Young
[1:40:55] church he had the same opportunity but
[1:40:58] I'd had to give up my seat in society
[1:41:01] I'd have to give up my friendships and
[1:41:03] my my fellowship card over at the
[1:41:07] church but he knew there was some I love
[1:41:12] this but Jesus he didn't give up on them
[1:41:16] he knew there was some in there that
[1:41:18] would still come out you know what he
[1:41:21] did Brother Wesley he didn't just go
[1:41:23] away he didn't just leave the Rich Young
[1:41:26] Ruler and say well he wouldn't accept it
[1:41:27] so I'm never going to make that call
[1:41:29] again but the Bible said he continued to
[1:41:32] call he raised men up and they continued
[1:41:34] to call it didn't discourage Jesus and
[1:41:37] make him give up his give up his cuse
[1:41:40] and it didn't discourage him and leot
[1:41:41] deia either for the Bible says whenever
[1:41:43] she wouldn't accept him I've got great
[1:41:45] possessions I I I can't I I can't I
[1:41:47] can't do that but the Bible said but he
[1:41:50] said behold I stand at the door and
[1:41:51] knock brother Joe what was he doing he
[1:41:53] just kept calling and kept calling he
[1:41:55] kept preaching and he kept ministering
[1:41:58] and the word of God kept going forth and
[1:41:59] the Holy Ghost it anointed other men and
[1:42:02] they heard the call of God and they got
[1:42:03] on fire for the Lord and they went out
[1:42:05] forth and they made the same call that
[1:42:07] was called upon them he said they'll
[1:42:09] keep calling and he that'll hear my
[1:42:12] voice and open the door I will come in
[1:42:14] unto him and sck with him and he with me
[1:42:17] friends you realize what you're hearing
[1:42:19] this morning it ain't just some old
[1:42:20] country boy preaching to you but it's
[1:42:22] that same knock of God in the middle of
[1:42:24] Le oia that says I stand at the door and
[1:42:27] knock and if any man will hear my voice
[1:42:29] and will open the door I will come in
[1:42:31] unto him I will s with him and he with
[1:42:34] me it's God that is calling us to open
[1:42:36] the door to the revelation of the word
[1:42:38] of God that he could come in and have
[1:42:41] communion with the Church of the Living
[1:42:42] God that he could lift you out of the
[1:42:44] spirit of Le oosa and the confusion that
[1:42:46] goes along with it he's still preaching
[1:42:49] the word of God he's calling for
[1:42:51] disciples to come and follow him and the
[1:42:54] Bible said and to he that does to he
[1:42:58] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[1:43:00] me in my throne even as I O overcame and
[1:43:04] I'm sit down with my father in his
[1:43:06] throne he that over he that he that will
[1:43:09] he to this call that'll become a
[1:43:11] Believer it'll make you an
[1:43:13] overcomer brother Mark it'll give you
[1:43:16] the Throne of Glory it wasn't just for
[1:43:18] the Disciples of old he said but you
[1:43:21] come and sit with me you're not just to
[1:43:23] be a on a throne over over some group of
[1:43:26] people but Jesus said but you'll come
