want to receive something from the word of the Lord amen and I believe that there if you come here to receive I believe that God will give to you and I just believe he's that kind of a God he promised it to us in his word if we come and expect him to receive something from the Lord our expectation is high and we just look forward to what God has in store we just want to invite you uh to the scripture this morning we're going to read first out of the Book of Joshua in the sixth chapter and then the first verse and we'll read the first two verses and then we're going to turn to Book of Revelations and read out of the third chapter Joshua 6 and 1 and then Revelations 3 and 18 so we'll give you just a moment to turn there and I appreciate brother Mark getting up here and worshiping the Lord he's my brother so we kind of we kind of get along pretty good so amen y'all appreciate brother Mark amen amen Joshua the 6th chapter the first verse Bible says now Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel none went out and none came in and the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given into thine hand Jericho and the King thereof and the Mighty Men of Valor and I also want to read out of Revelations in the third chapter and we'll read from the 18th verse and Jesus speaking he said I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy eyes with isav that thou mayest see and we just ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word this morning as you take your seats and I'm going to take uh just a minute the or some time this morning to speak of course we've been uh doing this uh study or or or series on on the revelation of the word and kind of been going in different directions as we've been going down through there and but I want to speak this morning on covered by Revelation and I just want to say this this morning it's um it's sure good to be uh to be able to be associated with a group of people that love the word of God Amen that take the revelation of the word and it means something to you and uh we love God how many love God Amen how many love his word amen we sure love the word of God and we love all the things that God has done for us I want to start in in of course last services or last couple of services as we've been preaching on Revelation I won't go back through them but uh had we had touched on the Cain and Abel and how that they had a different kind of Revelation and the sacrifices that they made were different and although that they had a desire to make a sacrifice and they had a desire to worship God and all that was seemingly the same everything was the same except for the sacrifice that they brought before the Lord and brother BR said now watch him he said it was it was the class that Cain came anointed he was anointed with Satan and he made a great big classical thing in other words this is what they had turned Church into and so he came to church and it was a great classical event and and he brought he brought his offering to the Lord and he expected God to receive his offering but it wasn't the kind of offering that God had expected them to bring and so he said but the difference was he says that when Abel came he never come in class but he came in Revelation he said the Bible said in Hebrews the 3r chapter that Abel by faith offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain he said the only way he did it was by faith and by faith in what you would ask well it was faith in the word of God cuz that's the only thing that you can really have faith in he says see and God had revealed to him that it was the blood and Cain had a beautiful offering yet he was not covered in blood but Abel he didn't have a beautiful offering but it was covered in blood and it was according to the word of God and God recognized it because it was his word and I thought my isn't that something that Abel's Revelation allowed him to be allowed him to be covered in the blood of the sacrifice I thought is something that's the way it is today that the revelation of the word of God is what covers you that's what God has brought to us it's a place for the church to find the covering or the things that God has put uh put before us it's found in the revelation of the word and you know I I I as I was been studying on this Revelation you know my mind is going back to the church world today and uh I get to thinking of the Bride church today and all the men and women that have that that have taken a hold of this revealed word of the hour and then they they they spend their lives on it brother Mark and they dedicate their their lives to it and their work and their efforts and their finan they put so much uh behind it you know what would cause a group of people to put everything behind something it's because they have a revelation that struck their heart no nobody could just talk you into dedicating your life to something but it's a revelation that you have that causes you to get behind the word of God and to support the uh the movement of God and the and the message going forth and you know I realize that this is what God is doing today God is building his church around the world and you know what I found out that when God builds something God always does it for a purpose how many believes that say Amen when God builds something he always he always does it for a purpose and when God builds something everything that God builds always last isn't that wonderful the Bible says like this it said except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it but but except the Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh but in vain see there is nothing that God has ever built that has not fulfilled its purpose and there's nothing that God has ever built that that doesn't last but you know what I find out that this is the way it is that sometimes that there are things that are standing in the way that God has to tear down before he can build back so I know the the world has a different View about this that the world view today is that anything goes the world view today is that God must be a God that would accept anything and he has to accept everyone equally and there there's this uh there's this Spirit of or or or what word they use of inclusion that everybody ought to be included it don't matter how they are how what what what they think or what they feel or or what they want to be or how they want to act that we ought to you know everything ought to be accepted after all it's the age of acceptance but but you realize that's the world view but just because it's a world view don't make it God View and you know we find in many places that that God ordered men men of God and judges of Israel to tear things down people today is everything's got to be built up and you know God ain't a God that's going to tear something down after all God is a builder and God is about making things beautiful and God is about building great things but friends sometimes before God can build anything then God has to first come and tear something down that's in the way of what God wants to build and you know so we got to be open to God coming and building I find many places in the Bible where had God had to come coming first before there could be building and before there could be restoration that something had to be torn down and take it and taken out of the way you remember the young Josiah when he became the king over Israel the Bible says when Josiah looked across the land even as a young man he realized that there were things in the nation that weren't Godly things there were there there were things that were that were not obedient to the way that God had ordered them to to be raised and so here was a young man that he took his life and he went back to the word of God and brother Mark before he built any anything in that Nation the first thing he does is he went on a mission and he went from City to City to tear down things that didn't belong in the kingdom of God and the Bible says he tore down Idols he tore down shrines he tore down altars he tore down places of worship he tore down sacred monuments he dug up Graves just because the graves were buried with idols and and graven images he tore he dug the graves up and crush the bones that had been laying there with Idols to make room for God to come down in that Nation and to build what God wanted to build let me tell you friend sometimes before God builds he has to first come and tear down you remember the Tower of Bible when God came down God tore it down and let me tell you something else about God when God tears something down God intends on it staying down he don't intend on it being built back up but he tears it down because it don't belong and God will lay a foundation on a on a solid foundation God will build something back in your life that'll be able to stand the test of time see God tears down he wants things down you know I find this is the way it is that there are places that God wants to take the church but sometimes there are just things that are standing in the way that God can't take the church to that next place you know you know there's places in your life that God wants to take you there's Revelations brother marah that God wants to lead his children into there there's places in the life of every believer that God wants to take you to this next place but sometimes we just come to these places that are standing in the way how many how many's ever felt that way I want to go further with God but it seems like there's something that's just blocking me and there this just seems like I keep coming back to this same place there's always something standing in the way but I realize it this morning that God wants to take the church to another place he wants to take the church to a higher place he wants to the church is on the rise it ain't on the decline it's on the incline but ma'am said he said see the doctors of theology but what they have done is they have shut the door to Faith and forbade all to enter and they neither go in nor they let anyone else go in their theology comes out of a textbook on pschology that was written by some unbeliever there's a tech he said but there is a textbook on psychology that every one of us need he said see they shut the door of Faith they opened a book of psychology what kept the children of God from going any further with God he said but there is a textbook that we all need and it's called The Holy Bible it's written by God it contains God's psychology and you don't need any doctor to explain it to you just receive you the Holy Spirit and let him do the explaining that's the textbook that God has sent to the church today oh they may Shut the Door of Faith I I realize that what's happened today is that down Through the Ages brother Xavier that that there's been great walls that have been built up by men that are surrounding the promises of God and you realize that Satan he has anointed men to teach you away from the promise of God can you can you realize I know that sounds like an awful thing but do you realize that Satan has anointed men to teach you away from God's promise he's anointed men to teach you away from what God wants for the church I thought you know sometimes the Bible's promise is is different than the church promise see the bible promises that that there'd be healing but the church says there ain't no such thing anymore the bible promises that you can lay hands on the sick and they'd recover but the church says well that was only for the disciples the Bible says it promises that there' be joy in your salvation but the church it'll bring so much legalism that people can't have any Joy anymore cuz they're always living under condemnation and they can't be free to find the grace of God upon their life and and so that they can't even worship God or have any freedom in their life anymore but you you realize that that the church teaches different than the Bible teaches see but the promises you know the Bible says that where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty but the church says well there ain't no such thing in that anymore but the church wants to be formal wants to be lukewarm and indifferent to the word of God you realize that's why when you come to churches today that you can have a a minister that it's anointed of God and the power of God fallen and if there a't any anointed Believers in the building it'll be formal it'll be lukewarm it'll be cold but I thank God this morning that not only do we have an anointed word and men that are anointed of God to preach the word of God but we have some hearers this morning that are anointed to receive God's word they're anointed to eat it and take it and feed upon it and let their life be changed by the word of the Living God it ain't no formal Church it ain't no lukewarm Church we're not indifferent to the word of God but we're receivers of the word of God and the promise of the Living God let me tell you something friends the the bible promises a Rapture the church says well not really but when you die maybe there's some kind of consolation that God will give us some kind of unexplainable connection between you and God but friends it ain't unexplainable it's very explainable he said in the moment in the twinkling of an eye this body will be changed the very God that created it he said I go and prepare a place for you for in my father's house are many mansions and if it wasn't true I wouldn't have told you so it's the promise of the Bible but you see what happens is is through Theology and through teaching that men have taught the promises of God right out of the reach of the church man is that something that they've taught the promise of God where you can't even reach it now we find the church is all walled out and the promises are all walled in here they come to this place but Mark they read every scripture but just not the ones that differ from their teaching you ever sit around and talk to some denominational fellow that's so mixed up and what his church says that he can't read what the Bible says and you said well brother but the Bible I had a guy telling me one time that God didn't heal no more I said well I've seen too many people be healed I mean you're talking to the wrong group of kids I know you're an elder and God bless you brother but in our age we've seen God heal we've seen God do the supernatural I saw people that couldn't walk I saw them walk again I saw people that couldn't see I've seen them see again God is still a Healer but I can't accept that but the Bible says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover well now our church ain't going to take that you know cuz that after all that was for that was for somebody else for a day going by I thought my isn't it something they're walking all the way around the promises of God and here there's a promise laid inside but it's so walled off that they can't get to the promise see it's just so they take all these brother Mar they'll they'll circle around them they'll take the Bible and they'll Circle the promises of God they'll they'll read scripture after scripture but just can't open that one that's laying in there why because it differs from the teaching so we're circling a promise but we just can't get to circling a promise but wondering why it don't apply to the church circling a promise but wondering why it ain't taking effect in our life you see what happens is is that people get caught up in this theology can I give you a bit of advice today let me tell you something I I don't mean this to sound mean but friends don't get caught up listening to teaching that keeps you away from any promise of God I'm not going to talk about men but I'm going to say it like this any man that is teaching you away from a promise of God the teaching I'm not going to say he ain't a man of God maybe he's just lost and maybe he's lost his way but the teaching that he's teaching is certainly not of God we're taught we had a brother preach brother Joe preached it last week or the a couple weeks ago he said for the promises with Jesus are yes and amen so if a man would teach you away from God's promise it certainly didn't come from Christ it only could come from the devil but God give us promises brother Mark these promises belong to the church you see these Divine Promises of God you say well how do you receive them you listen how job received them the Bible says here was job he was a the man that claimed his children would be saved you remember all the things that had happened in his life I I won't I won't preach the story but but everything had fell apart in his life until his own wife came to him and said why don't you just Curse God and die you've lived this life and you serve God and you've claimed to be a believer and now all these things are happening in your life how can you stand there and still be a believer when all these things are happening why don't you just Curse God and die but it didn't B to job he said you speak like a foolish woman why because there was something in the heart of job that realized that he had met the requirements that God had made but a amam said he had faith in what he done is because God had given him a requirement and not only did job go meet the requirement for himself but he met the requirement for his children so job could stand there in the in the in the middle of failure in the middle of trouble in the middle of great trial in the middle of great loss he' say but I met God's requirement and I know that I I have faith in the requirement of God I've done what God asked for and I believe that God is going to see you through he said see he met what Jehovah required he said if we could just do that what God required was a burnt offering for his sin and job didn't just offer it for himself but he offered that burnt offering for his children and when he made that offering that's all that God required and people today they say well I wish God I wish that's all that God required today just to take a sacrifice and throw it up on a rock and I wish that's all God required today butam said but God requires less than that he said all he requires today is just your faith in his word and if you'll make his word your absolute then any Divine promise in the Bible you can tie your soul to it and then it don't matter what comes your way it doesn't matter how much trouble you get into it doesn't matter how many things fall around you there's something on the inside of you said but my soul is tied to a Divine promise of God I've met his requirements I've accepted the word of God over my life it may not be the way I feel but it's what God said about it it may not be the way it looks but it's what God said about it and I've taken the Divine promise of God and I've placed it over my life see as we grow we come to places that our faith just can't get past sometimes these walls they separate us from the things that God wants us to receive but Joe you notice that this is what happened in the Book of Joshua here they come down to this place that was promised to them these brothers been preached on this the past couple of weeks they come to this place that God had promised them it was the land of promise and when they come to this this this this place of of Jer Jero you realize I I I thought you know here that God had promised it all along they finally come up to this Great Wall City it was it was the very first city that they come in contact with when they stepped over into the promised land here they're coming to receive everything God had promised them and the first time they entered brother wesle when they walk in there's a great wall standing before them that prevented them from receiving what God had promised them I thought my isn't that the way it is with a new believer when he comes and enters into this land of promise and when he walks in brother Mark and he and he looks right inside these walls there he's hearing about justification and sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and but you know what it's just something that he can't achieve you mean you here he's looking at a wall thinking you mean that God can take all my sin and all my past and all my failures and and the thing y'all don't you don't even know what I've done in the places that I've been and you mean to tell me that God the the the allseen I the god that is an eternal God that's seen the beginning from the end you mean that God can't see my sin you mean he put it in a place where it don't matter anymore that'll never be brought up oh it's a promise of God but there's something there you know that that you have to get past butar for you to be able to receive it justification you mean God can wash me you mean God can feel me so full of his spirit that the things of this world won't have no hold on me anymore you mean that God can get me so filled of his spirit that that these things that used to torment me and the pressures and and the The Temptations but Mar they won't have a hold on me and I can come and I can be free I can walk by the same thing that used to get a hold of me and I can say I don't have to pick you up you're a snake I know you are and you walk right by it why cuz you've been freed by the blood of Jesus Christ you see it's a promise of God but sometimes it lays behind the wall sometimes it's laying there and you just can't get a hold of that one my I know boy I I'm going to preach to you anyway it's what the Lord put on my heart you know sometimes we I know the Lord I know you say it Lord we can be free and I know you say that the desire of sin would leave this flesh and Lord I but you know there's some things I just can't get over see it's walls the West they come up in place to prevent us from walking into these promises of God I thought isn't it something the Bible says for seven days they marched around these walls seven days on the seventh day seven times notice what Joshua said the Bible said and then Joshua commanded the people saying you shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day that I bid you to shout then you shall shout and the walls will fall down you know what happened y'all know the story I'm not going to preach on it but you know what happened the Bible says that whenever they shouted the walls of Jericho fell they everyone fell they fell to the ground brother Wesley and the very thing that God had promised him they got to go and have it because they obeyed the Lord I thought isn't it something they hear the Lord he said there's coming a day that I'm going to give you a command this is what he told Joshua Joshua said there's coming a day I'm going to give you a command it may not be today here was before the first day before they ever took their first step or or first walk around the wall but Joshua said there's coming a day that I'm going to give you a command and that command is going to be to shout it's going to be to cry out and whenever you hear that command to shout and you cry out every wall is going to fall down I thought my isn't it something that word shout it was a Battle Cry and when they went out the Bible says when they went out and they made that Battle Cry it put fear in the heart of those in Jericho they knew that something was happening the walls begin to shake there was nothing that could hold them together but a mark because the Cry of the children of God had gone out I thought my here here you hear this Battle Cry I know sometimes we look for you know we're looking for this great Cry of battle what what what is it to us but listen when I when I read this in the concordance and I sure love to do I sure love to go through the word in this way but but in the concordance it says it says it's worth noting that this word shout in the Book of Joshua that was used for a battlecry is the same word that was used and a shout of Joy says so in other words whenever a person when you find in the Bible and it says shout for Joy it's the same it's same word that they use when they told them to shout or let the battlecry go out I thought my isn't this something that for you is a shout of Joy but to the devil it's a battlecry and you know we're looking and say what what are we crying out well friends let me tell you it ought to put fear in the heart of the devil today he put so much on you he says you ought to give up he put so much on you so much pressure brother Wesley that ought to fold and the devil what is he doing he's waiting and he's watching on you to crumble he's waiting and watching for you to give up he's waiting and watching for you to turn your back on the word of God and go back out into the world or go find some denomination to sh in he's watching for you to fail oh let me tell you man I just I'm going to preach for a minute I can't that old that old stubborn devil let me tell you at any moment he thinks you're going to buckle he's looking at you in just a minute you just watch she's going to break in just a minute she's going to give up in just a minute she's going to give in in just a minute she's going to bow down in just a minute she ain't going to last she's all she's about to throw in the towel and but let me tell you friends I think we ought to remind the devil that there's a word that is concerning you Jesus said I'll never put on you more than you could bear so if the devil says she's going to break I say she's going to stand if he says she's going to fall I say she's going to rise if he say she's going to crumble I say she's going to overcome cuz I have a word that's overcoming my life I'll never put on you let me tell you the devil he's waiting for that shout of anger he's waiting on you to give up he's waiting on you say I quit he's waiting on you say I can't stand it no more he's waiting on you to say I can't go another mile but let me tell you it ain't a shout of anger that he's going to hear it ain't a shout of fear that he's going to hear but I thank God there's some Believers this morning that have a shout of Joy when you feel like giving up somebody say praise the Lord when you feel like giv up you say Hallelujah Lord I Thank you for every trial I thank you for every Temptation I thank you for the failures Lord they made me what I am he's looking for you to give in looking for a shout of fear but instead he'll hear a shout of Joy let me tell you friends and a shout of Joy will release it'll release the pressure off your life oh my I feel like preaching a shout of Joy it'll release you out of bondage a shout out of joy you know you just get when you get so bound up all it takes you know sometimes just come to the house of God you feel like I I don't even know if I can go another another day but you know what brother Wesley we do we come in and when it gets so bad finally there just something inside you that says Lord you're an awesome God lord you brought me out you brought me this far and your word said you'll see me through Lord I believe your promise I want to thank you for it this morning Lord I Want to Say I Love You Lord I I thank you for all you've done Lord I say you're awesome God I praise thy name oh God I say hallelujah I say praise the Lord what it's a shout of joy that release you from bondage a shout of Joy that'll break chains off your life and that shout of Joy brother Mark whenever whenever it goes out it's a Battle Cry to the devil might it's something that a shout of joy in the church would send the devil running it'll tear the walls that are keeping you from God's promises it'll lay you down before your feet it's a shout of Joy my I think about it I think we got to write the shout this morning how many say Amen somebody say praise the Lord Don't It Make You Feel Good Just to praise God somebody God you're a wonderful God you know how good it makes you feel just to say God you're wonderful God you've never failed me god you're an awesome God I thank you Lord for being there for me when I wasn't there for myself but God you carry me through it does something to your heart just to Worship the Lord a shout of Joy it'll free you it'll free your spirit some people's been bound by so much theology so long they don't even know what Liberty is anymore used to Worship the Lord have so much Liberty in the house of God but what they get under this that old Spirit holding people down but brother Mark I thank God we're free we got a right a shout how many say Amen brother Conor you got a right to shout you know what the devil does he'll look at your life you ain't got a right to do nothing you know he does that to all all of us you you ain't got but but we got a right to it's a shout of joy we got a right to thank God for what he's done for us said when I give you the command you shout see why don't we have a right because we've had a real conversion how many say Amen we've had a real conversion you know what we've been converted from the love of the world to the love of God brother being God took us out of the world and and we've had a real conversion and now you know what we do we seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness as the Bible says to do we our our heart has been changed it became our priority and brother Mark you know what we've had we've had a real Pentecostal experience and I know I know the churches man I know the churches are teaching away from that can I can I take just a minute I got a right to M matter of fact I'm obligated to but you realize the churches are teaching away from that but it's not what the prophet taught so listen whenever Apostle Paul Apostle Paul had to go out and he had an experience with God and when he had that experience now Paul done the right thing is he went back to the scripture to found out if his experience was scriptural or not how many knows that to see Paul went out when he had this he said he had to before he could accept his experience he went back to the Bible and he found out he went to another Nation he stayed for three years searching the scripture to see if his experience was right we realize that he had a great thing to face he had to come back and tell his church that all the people that that the very things that he had persecuted was right he said how many had to do something like that certainly nearly all of us did we had to go back and say them people that we called Holy Rollers that to come to find out they were right I know we don't call each other that that's a name the devil put on the church that there ain't no such a really thing but but he said but then people they called Holy Rollers come to find out they were right he said that's it we just had to turn around and the things we once hated we now love what was it it was a real conversion it may seem like a strange thing it may be odd to you but the thing you once once hated now you love the thing that the world's afraid of but you're in love with it oh friends let me tell you I thank God that there's a group of people here this morning that ain't afraid of the move of God I thank God that there's some people here this morning that ain't afraid of the Holy Ghost brother Wes we ain't afraid of the supernatural we ain't afraid of Pentecost or or real Pentecostal experience now now I'm not talking about I'm not talking about a Pentecostal church but but speaking of the experience that they had in the book of Acts how manyan how many knows what that was remember when the the Bible says when the day of Pentecost was fully come and the Holy Ghost fell upon them they came out speaking in an unknown tongue you you realize they stayed in a room and they prayed until the spirit of God fell upon them until the person of the Holy Ghost stepped down into the room that they were in you realize who it was it was Elohim in the form of the Holy Ghost brother the Wesley he came right down into the room little licks of fire that fell on them and indwelled in the hearts of those men till they came out speaking in an unknown tongue the same God that walked down the shores the shores of of Galilee or the in the streets of jerus J it was the same God that walked down in that room that day and that came out speaking in those unknown tongues and let me tell you friends what has happened that that that Pentecostal Church of course they made a teaching out of it and they said well the evidence of the Holy Ghost is that you would speak in tongues because you know after all they spoke in tongues and so so they said well that must be the evidence so if you speak in tongues then then you got the Holy Ghost too and see when people can't speak in tongues then it causes a bunch of confusion you realize what it does it builds a wall and says well I must not have the Holy Ghost because I didn't do what they did see the it's a wall that a man that a man built up but you realize that the miracle that happened at Pentecost it wasn't that they spoke in an unknown tongue but the real miracle that happened is that everybody heard it in their own language the Bible says there was noise abroad and the multitude came together and every man heard them speak and they were amazed and marveled saying one to another are not all these which speak galileans well then how can all of us hear in our own language you said well what were they speaking listen he said we do hear them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God I thought my itness something here The Holy Ghost came and he and he ministered to every tongue and every nation the Bible said that in Jerusalem at that time dwelt men of every nation under the heavens so here God would come down in the form of the Holy Ghost these men Anointed with God the Holy Ghost they come out they were speaking in unknown tongues and the Bible said when they spoke out every man of every nation heard it in their own language you say well what was happening they were fulfilling what Jesus said in Luke 24 he said repentance and remission of sins should be preached in my name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem so here we see this being fulfilled you but now let me show you brother Mark let me can I just show you this but watch what what was the response of it when the works of God were manifested when God began to manifest himself the Bible says they were amazed and they were in doubt I thought isn't that always the way it is whenever God does something there's some amazed and there's some in doubt when God it's a supernatural there's some amazed but there's some doubt why can't it's always the same response it's the same response today when the works of God is made manifest they're amazed they're endowed it always brings both sides some hear and some don't and some some see and some don't some will feed on the word of God and some won't but I've got news for you today that this word today this oldfashioned Gospel of Jesus Christ the revealing of the mysteries of God it must be planted in the Church of the Living God it'll Amaze some some will be in doubt but it has to be planted you say well why is it got to be planted because the church has to produce the right kind of children it's got to bring forth these children that God had called it to produce so the seed has to be planted you realize the church is bringing forth all kinds of children but said notice he said they got all kinds of new members so there must be pregnated with something because there's something coming forth there's all kinds of children he said but what the church world don't want is they don't want none of them this is inv visible Union 19 65 he said they don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures that they think they are it would certainly embarrass them it would Ru her educated ethical scientific Society Church that she belonged to they would throw her out at the next Council she can't have it she don't want to be pregnated with the word but that's the only kind that the word can bring forth are you hear me somebody the one that she don't want is the only kind that the word can produce what kind of was it it was the screaming and hollering and blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures that that old scientific church rebukes but he said but that's the only kind of church that God's word can bring forth I mean this ain't me as a prophet of God he said that's what God's word produces it's what it produced 2,000 years ago and that's what it produces today the spirit of God only produces one kind of children they're word born somebody say Amen Blood Bought Spirit-filled children of God that's what the word produces let me tell you what they'll do but a being they'll they'll bear the characteristics of God the character of Jesus Christ when they have that real conversion they'll love you even if you don't love them back they'll say good things about you even when you say bad things about them they'll give their life one for another they'll love those that spitefully use them they'll display the character of Christ I thought you you know taking me a break brother Wesley sometimes people want to hold you to a Bible standard but they don't want to have a Bible standard but I thank God that what we have as a body of people this morning that not only do we hold a standard but we want to live the standard that we're holding I'm not going to hold something over you that I ain't going to live myself but I thank God this is real Believers it's a we live by the standard that we hold we have a desire to live the word that we preach but Mar there's something in our heart causes us to be real Believers let me let me share this with you the Bible teaches this of course they made this the the evidence of the Holy Ghost but I I don't want to leave you wondering I don't believe God ever Liv the church in confusion but there is an Evidence of the Holy Ghost but it's found in a different place than you would than you would expect to find it matter of fact you can find in Luke the first chapter the Bible says when the angel of the Lord can I just can I just show you this when the angel of the Lord came came to Zacharias remember what the angel told him here his wife was going to bring forth a child he says fear not Zacharias for your prayer is heard your wife Elizabeth shall bear a son and she shall call his name John he'll have joy and great gladness and many Will Rejoice at his birth and there shall be a great he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and He Shall drink neither strong drink nor wine and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb now you hold on to that scripture and let's read another one Matthew 3 the Bible says when John was baptizing at the River Jordan notice what happens glory to God while he's baptizing brother Jared the Bible says and then come Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John but BR takes those two scriptures he says now notice this he said first he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb and then when he was baptized in the Jordan Jesus came to him Jesus being the top of the word he said see the word always comes to those that are truly Spirit-filled he said and that is the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost Now isn't that something brother West that the real evidence is the word would come to you and that you would receive it oh friend let me tell you a Spirit-filled Bel a Believer they can't stop the revelation of the of the word of God from coming to them you know whenever we started this series brother Mark we started in the in Revelation and showing how that everything happened by faith you were healed by faith our Salvation came by faith but but but then the question came up but where did Faith come from and the Bible says faith cometh by hearing of the word of God so now remember it wasn't the hearing of the ear but it was a the hearing of the heart so in other words Faith come by Revelation so in other words you couldn't have healing without Revelation you couldn't be saved without a revelation so it took Revelation in order to bring Faith but then that brings up another question for this morning and that question is well then if if Revelation is what brings Faith well then what brings Revelation well the answer is simple the Bible says what brings it is the spirit of Truth now we've been building through this for several weeks but he says see what brings Revelation it's the spirit of Truth Jesus said in John 14th chapter he said I will pray the father he shall give you another comforter and he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive catch that because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you he shall be in you I'll not leave you comfortless I will come to you in a little while the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I am in my father and you are in me and I am in you so here Jesus prophesies brother Jared that there is one coming after him that would be called the spirit of Truth so he he's introducing this Spirit of Truth which which we know he says see but but there's some things that you have to know about the spirit of Truth the first thing you have to know is the world can't receive it these are just some truths about it first off the world will never be able to receive it the Bible says so second thing was is the bride would have to receive it is't that good it was something that the world would never receive and the the church couldn't help but receive you say well she might receive it no no no no no she must receive it say well well maybe she'll be able to re no no she will receive it well it's a possibility that you'll be able to receive the spirit no it's not a possibility but Mark it's a guarantee that the Bride of Jesus Christ would receive the spirit of truth that Jesus told would come the spirit of truth it's not a mystery I know it's been uh uh preached as a mystery but but but John 17 makes it plain and identifies what it is he said Thy word is truth but said now watch watch these two things he said John 14 the world couldn not receive the spirit of Truth which was the Holy Ghost but then in John the 8th chapter Jesus said why do you not understand my speech he said because you can't hear my word he said see so not only could the world not receive the Holy Ghost but though neither could they receive the word of God so they couldn't receive the spirit of God neither could they receive the word of God he said why because the spirit and the word are one and if you have the Holy Spirit as the prophets did then the word would come to you and you would have to receive it that's why they'll never have this Spirit like you have in in such a a seal of God in their life like you have because if you have that in your life then you must receive the word he said because they're one and the word would come to you and you would have to receive it so here's what the prophet lays down this principle I think this is beautiful is he shows us that this is this is why we preach so much on the Holy Ghost and why and the spirit of God and the church getting into a spiritual place and and not just being some formal church or or just reading some scripture and it all being about Theology and things but but realize here this principle that the prophet lays down he said this is what Jesus is telling us that the word comes where the spirit of God is you see why it's important to have the spirit of God in the church you see why it's important to have the spirit of God in your life and to live in a spiritual place and to be able to to live in a state of worship and and to have your home Sanctified and your and your car driving down the road is to allow the spirit of God to be welcome where you are because where the spirit of God is then the word comes so if you want to have the word so you must have the spirit Jesus said but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he'll teach you all things and he'll bring all things to your remembrance whatever I have said unto you you see so the Holy Ghost is your teacher but said here again we find that the word comes because of the spirit of God so once again we're show this the word comes because of the spirit of God so here's here lays a revelation but the mark that the world has yet to catch John 16 said how be it when he the spirit of Truth which was the word is come he will guide you into all truth because the word is truth he shall speak not of himself but whatever he shall whatever he shall hear which was the word of God that shall he speak to you and then the next part the Bible says and he will show you things to come I better have me a jubilee when I read this you and let somebody answer me this question of what gift of the five-fold ministry would show you things to come somebody answer it God called a five-fold Ministry to the church but there's a gift in that five-fold Ministry that has the ability to show you things that have not happened yet anybody want to tell me what it is a prophet thank you so here Jesus is speaking he said the spirit of truth will come he shall not speak himself whatever he'll hear it be the word of God he shall speak to you the word and he will show you things to come I isn't that good so in other words to hear the Holy Ghost is going to come and he's going to reveal to the church the the word of God he's going to lead them into all things but all also this Holy Ghost will show you things that are to come here what he's showing us is that God is going to have to use that gift it can't he'll have to use the gift of Prophecy you know that's what a prophet is is to tell you something that hasn't taken place yet so here God is going to use this gift of Prophecy to show you things that are to come I thought my isn't it something that the spirit is bringing the word of Prophecy it comes by the Holy Ghost oh friends it don't come from the devil I know the church where we look at it say well it's be El and it must have come from the devil and it must have come from some much of reading or something like that but that ain't what Jesus said Jesus said it's going to come the spirit of truth will come he'll reveal to you the word he'll speak the word he'll speak the things that I tell him to speak and he'll show you things that are to come I say Lord let him come Lord Jesus oh let the spirit of Prophecy speak in this age it ain't something that we're running from it's something that we're running to I say hear it this morning the voice of truth that is crying out in our age he said I want you to note very carefully that Jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues or interpreting or prophesying or shouting and dancing but he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost that you would be in the truth you know how good that makes me feel glory to God yeah because sometimes you question yourself and you you question your your salvation and where you are with God and I I don't even know if I have the Holy Ghost or not but here the Bible says but the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost is that you would be in the truth glory to God so every day when I get up and I read the truth of God's word I say Lord I Thank you for bringing me the truth Lord I Thank you for revealing truth Lord I Thank you for speaking your heart to me the truth that came out of the mind of God Lord I Thank you for the gift of Prophecy that came in my age Lord that would show me the things that were to come it's an evidence that you have the Holy Ghost you would be in the word of God for your age to see the evidence has to do with per receiving of the word can I read one more I know we're getting close to time Paul said If any man think of himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord so he says see the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and to follow what God had already done through his Prophet is't that good here Apostle Paul there's many spiritual men that are raising up in the days of Paul but in the midst of all them raising up well we've got a we've got a we're close to God too well I've got a I've got a Theology and you know I've got I've got ideas about it too you're not the only one you know I you know I've got some thoughts about it too you're not the only one to get all the answers from but listen how Paul Paul knew who he was so by the authority of God Paul would say these words he said If any man think of himself to be a prophet or to be spiritual let him acknowledge the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord so if you're spiritual and you claim to be a prophet and you claim to have a word of word of the Lord first acknowledge that what I'm telling you comes from God so before you go off glory to God before you go off and you and wandering around and making up your own religions and your own thoughts about God's word and saying well the lord gave me a word about this and this is the way we ought he said first I want you to acknowledge that the word I'm speaking to you didn't come from a man but it came from God before you sit around with your friends you come up with all the ideas about the church and how everything's ran and how everything is this and it ain't nothing but the devil and all the you better acknowledge that the first that the words that I speak unto you don't aren't words that come from a man but they're words that come from God said the first acknowledge what came from God to see it was the the dwelling of the holy spirit said Paul had those that would say they they would they would raise up and they would claim another Revelation well I've got a higher Revelation than Paul he said what do you mean came the word of God out from you or did it come to you only you got a revelation that's different than the word that God's already Vindicated he said the word came to you only I love how Paul was bold in what he believed say see the EV so the evidence of the spirit filled Christian believer is not to produce truth see where Paul warned them because they were produced they were manufacturing their own truth he said the word of God came from you it came from you only you better acknowledge something that it better line up with what I've already said because it came from God see he said now notice see the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce truth but is to receive truth and to believe it that friends that's that's that's a lot the evidence of a spirit filled believer is not to produce truth it's to receive truth and to believe it and Obey it I think the problem is today brother Mark is the devil's anointed too many men to try to produce truth but I think I I'm not here to produce anything Lord I'm just here to receive it I'm not here to make up some religion Lord I'm just here to receive what you've already said I'm not here to preach a new doctrine Lord I'm just here to take what you've are what you've already given to the church there's too many trying to produce it well you know you know I think we ought to do it this way and handle it this way but it doesn't matter doesn't matter what the word says everybody has their own idea how to handle every situation you know that that after all this is that that's an old way of doing things you know you oh God I'm going to get myself in trouble but I I know how the devil is somebody wrongs you say well I'll tell you what you just don't talk to them no more and that'll put an end to that well that's nice you can produce your own truth if you want to but let me go back to the truth of the word the Bible says go to them and make it right if you feel like there's something wrong well go and correct it and tell them you love them and put your arm around them and do something nice for them and do good to those that spitefully use you too many producing truth said but we didn't come to produce truth we come to receive truth and that's an Evidence of the Holy Ghost is that we' receive it and believe it and Obey it my my glory to God the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is to receive truth I think of this and I'm going to hurry and close the first age here God sends this gift of Prophecy to set the church in order brother Jared as he comes into this place we watch as the church comes all the way through from the first age to the second Church age Third Church all the way down to the age into the Le leysia where we are today and we found ourselves in this age of leoda but the Mark just like the children of Israel but we're on the last day of the March here's where we found ourselves on the last day of this great March and there here this great wall that keeps God's children from their promise I I I thought this was so powerful how many knows how many nations there were in the land of Canaan that were keeping the children of Israel out of their inheritance the Bible says in Deuteronomy there were seven of them so here was Seven Nations that were that were in this land that had all been raised up I I thought my isn't that good there was one for every age these great big old ugly Nations that were dwelling in their land of promise there was one for every age they were they were in I I know sometimes when people hear this story they take it as unfair and they say well why would God come and he would drive out a people that were already there they had already raised up children they were in this nation and you know and then God would take it away from them and give that land to somebody else you ever you ever heard people say that he said well but you realize then somebody said well God promised it to him and so so you know he he he had to give it to them and then they'll come back and go well well why why would god promise them something they didn't know that God give that land to Jacob and and to Jacob's children so you know what God was just unfair that he would do something like that but friends there's something you have to realize is that these people that were dwelling in the land of Jericho that that that that Jericho was inhabited by the Canaanites now now the Canaanites which came which came from from one Father which was ham the son of Noah and the Canaanites came from them and in that Land There was Canaanites girgashites amorites Hittites hivites jebusites and perizzites now every one of these these seven uh these Seven Nations they had their own Kings they had their own strongholds they were dwelling in this land that was promised this Canaan land that was promised to the children of Israel but notice that that whenever they were in this place there was something different about why they were called what they were called see the children of Israel when they were called a certain tribe it was because they were born to a certain tribe so if you were born born uh of Benjamin then you were of The Tribe of Benjamin because of your natural birth but but when it came to these seven tribes of the land of Canaan or these Seven Nations they were they were the descendants of Canaan and but but what made them had the name they had it was just the place that they dwelt in so it had nothing to do with their natural birth they may have been they may have been born over in Jericho but because they lived in the land of the Hittites where they were called Hittites and because they lived in the hi the hivites where they were called hivites so so brother Wesley what would happen is is sometimes well they they get tired of living over there maybe they go over to another kingdom and now they're not called a havit no more now now they're caught a hittite see it didn't matter how they were born but it was where they had fellowship at is what gave them the name that they had so there was all of these names that were in there and they were inhabiting and they were living upon the promised land and they were living upon the promises of God I thought my and here they were jumping back and forth one day there was a hii and the next day there's a jebusite and the next day they me a peri they just jump all around and just whichever theology they could get a hold of or maybe the maybe it had a little bit better food over there maybe there's a little bit better job so they just kind of bounced around from one denom or one one one one uh uh jebusite to the other but the Mark or one land to the other and all these Seven Nations that they would come but you realize that it didn't matter which one they were a part of oh I'm and I'm getting into some stuff but it didn't matter which one they were a part of sister Nisha every one of them were under the same curse because they all came from Canaan which was the son of ham and the Bible said in Genesis the 9th chapter that Noah cursed Canaan he said cursed be Canaan and the servant of servants he shall be unto his Brethren and he said but blessed be the Lord of sham that Canan shall be his servant God shall enlarge japeth and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem but Canaan shall be his servant so you know what my Bible tells me that long before there was ever an Abraham before there was ever Sarah before there was Isaac before there was Jacob before there there was Israel that God had already spoke of Canaan and because of the wickedness that was in his heart that God had brought a curse upon his life and let me tell you whenever God comes down God even reminds Abraham of it when he comes down and he gives Abraham his Covenant and he begins to speak of Abraham and he tells of his seed numbering the stars of the Heaven and the SS of the sea and he tells Abraham he said but your seed is going to go into bondage for 400 years but then they're going to come out with great substance but in that God reminds him he said but it'll come out in the fourth generation now God starts telling Abraham why it would take that long he says it'll come out in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full so here sets an eternal god brother Wesley watching a people that knowing that their iniquity is growing greater and they're they're continually going further into evil and the wickedness is growing greater but God said but in the fourth generation it'll come to its high and it's coming the time when I'm going to come and I'm going to drive them and bring judgment upon them and drive them out of this land so the Bible says you know they they had great sins and matter of fact you could I was going to go through it but I don't have time but but Leviticus 18th chapter the Bible say and the land is defiled and therefore I do visit the iniquity upon it for the land itself vomit out her inhabitants so here when you look at the overthrow of these Seven Nations the driving out of them was not God being unjust but brother Jared it was God using his promised seed to bring judgment upon the nations of Canaan for their their failure to repent for their wickedness so here God would use his children to enter into this land Land Of Promise so for all this time these other nations had been raised up it didn't matter what name they were or what part they went to they they go from this and that into the other and they fed on those promises that that that wonderful land that God had created and they fed on it for a little while but God said there cometh the time there's coming a fourth generation and when this generation comes brother Mark the children of God are going to come into that land and everything that dwells in that land will be cast to and there ain't nothing going to stop them from being able to inherit it you know I see this I know when you it looks like something the wrath of God but you realize when I saw that I I brother Wesley I saw the grace of almighty God I saw the mercy of God upon the land of Canaan you say brother man how could you see Mercy when God would come in and tear down their walls and destroy their their homes and drive them out of the land let me tell you why I see Mercy because it took God 400 years to do it God gave them 400 years to repent of their wickedness 400 years to make their wrongs right you say brother man you think he' have forgave them I know he had have forgave them because the men of Nineveh were doing the same sins and the Bible said but when Jonah came into Nineveh and he began to preach the word of God that they repented of their sins and God spared the city see they had time to repent God always gives time for repentance he said but then you know that's what he does in the days of Noah he said 120 years he preached his message of mercy of an oncoming judgment he said but God in the middle of all judgment coming God warned them and God didn't just warn the people God warned the Sheep he warned the cow battle he warned every inhabitant of the land that judgment was coming but at the end I I think but then but then God came and brought judgment to them so here we standing in the in the Book of Joshua they're standing around these walls but the Mark at the end of seven days the shout goes out and the Walls Start to fall down but brings all that down down to this age I know I rushed through this but he brought us all the way down to this age he said that's what God is trying to do today he is trying to warn his people today to get away from these old ecclesiastical walls that's going to crumble in for the coming of the Lord is at hand don't you realize it friends it was the Judgment of God against the immorality and the mixed up of sins and and the homosexuality and the fornication and the things that had entered into the land of Canaan it was the natural sins of their flesh that they would allow seed with anything to come forth and now we look at it in a spiritual sense in the middle of Le O deia and spiritually the same thing they allowed any kind of seed in the church it can come from a mother mother a daughter a father an uncle don't matter where it come from they would allow it to be all mixed in and it was it was it was it was it was disgusting in the sight of God in 400 years brother Mark God watches this happen 400 years he said but the iniquity is growing R and for 400 years God builds up this Army in the middle of the land of Egypt what looked like it was slaves and what looked like they'd never be able to come out and what looked like that there'd never be nothing they were put down but God was building up an army that would drive the in inhabitants out of their land that he would not only would he bring judgment but he would but but it was the grace that he give to his children to receive their land of promise think about it and not only but Mark did they go and they and they into their Promised Land but the Bible says but he vomited out the inhabitants I ran out of time I know he said but he vomited out the inhabitants ain't that the same thing today come down to today in the middle of lay out of sea what the Bible say because you were lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew you out of my mouth here right here in a spiritual world and warfare he said you say I am rich and increase with Goods I have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked you realize what the sins of the Canaanites were but the David it started with the father of Canaan that would see the nakedness of his father remember that's what brought the curse from Noah in Leviticus is it was a shame to uncover the nakedness of thy father or th thy brother thy sister andt daughter whole chapter showing the shame of nakedness but then we see this in the middle of this the shame of this nakedness in a in a spiritual world that we live in today brother Mark but notice what the Bible said Jesus says but I counsel you to buy of me a gold that's tried in a fire that you may be rich with white rment that you may be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness does not appear my is't it something today as the music players come to realize that in that we have a covering that in the time of judgment that God would bring a cover a covering upon the church the very sin that they committed that brought judgment to them he said but but God would bring a covering today that would cover the shame of thy nakedness but the Market's really there the sins and the failures you realize why it has to cover them because those are things even though God is a God that can forget you're not and the shame of your past is always there you ever notice that you can you can read about every justification you want to you can hear the story of it going in the the bottom of the of the sea of forgetfulness and it has no end and God just forgets it but every now and then something will happen in your life that'll bring it back up somebody you always got them God love them somebody yeah I know I know what you used to be I can tell you you ain't change nothing I know what you used to be you and you get and you get to a place it ain't your fault we get into a place sometimes just get under anointings and they'll call you back to this but here God says but I'm going to give you a covering that the shame of your nakedness wouldn't appear is't that good the very thing the condemnation the very the shame of your past he said but I'll give you a covering that whenever it's brought up you know it's there you can't get rid of it or my one allow us but when it's brought up you say but Lord I have a covering I may not be able to do nothing about my past but but I thank God I have a covering this morning oh my I thank Lord that I'm been covered by the blood of Jesus Christ I I thank God that he's put on me a robe of righteousness we've been covered by the word of God even in the time of judgment brother Mark you going stand to your feet God provides a covering he said how did Abel know what to do in order to offer a proper sacrifice to God he said by faith he received the revelation of the blood Cain didn't get such a revelation even though he had the the same Commandment that Abel had you realize that he had the same commandment but he had a different Revelation he had the same commandment he had but he couldn't offer the right sacrifice because it was a revelation from God that made the difference and gave Abel eternal life and until God reveals to you that Jesus Christ is the Christ and that his blood is what cleanses you and that God is your savior you will never have eternal life it is a spiritual Revelation that does it my isn't it wonderful brother Mark that God would send a revelation in this hour to cover your nakedness cover the shame of your past it's a revelation of who you are and a revelation of who God is it's a revelation that God would say that I'm going to come I'll drive them out of this place I'll tear down every wall that they built up that would keep you out of the promise of God well I can't believe that no more oh yes you can I know men don't believe it and they may not believe you can receive your healing this morning but God tore the wall down when he said sent Joshua as a Tope of the Holy Ghost and he marched around the wall he said there's coming a time and I'm going to give you a command to shout friends I thank God this morning that we're not waiting on a command any longer but the command has already gone forth that the Church of the Living God can shout for Joy cuz there ain't a wall that stands between you and the promise of God and everything that belongs to you is waiting on you to take it they had to leave the land and give it over to the children of God those that were covered by the blood of Jesus Christ I don't know about you it sure makes me want to praise the Lord don't make you just can may you just lift your hand to the Lord say Lord Lord I Thank you for a covering Lord I Thank you for a revelation Lord that that has covered my shame Lord God knowing my failures I I shouldn't even be here this morning but God you provided a covering friend he come as a reminder to you even in the midst of your own failures even if you're living in sin I I don't care what you yesterday or the day before but God has a covering for you if you'll just receive it won't you just lift your hands Lord God let me have it I don't know about you friends but Lord Lord I Lord let me have that kind of covering Lord
