[42:56] to invite you to the scripture this
[42:58] morning we're going to uh take a turn in
[43:01] John the 11th chapter and we're going to
[43:03] read out of the 11th verse and then uh
[43:05] we'll go up to the uh about the 25th
[43:08] verse we'll give you just a moment to
[43:10] get there John 11 and
[43:12] 11 and I know we had some just a really
[43:17] Mighty move of God Wednesday night
[43:19] certainly appreciate what how many that
[43:21] the Lord touched in the meeting
[43:22] Wednesday night amen God bless you and I
[43:25] had a sister telling me when she's like
[43:26] you got got to reading that quote about
[43:28] the angel of the Lord being near and I
[43:30] saw that Pillar of Fire right there on
[43:31] the platform I thought isn't it he's the
[43:33] same Pillar of Fire that he always has
[43:35] been amen and he's still present with us
[43:37] this morning amen so even even when you
[43:40] don't see him he's still present amen so
[43:42] we just appreciate God for that and but
[43:45] we do we want to read out of the 11th
[43:47] chapter and the 11th verse a very
[43:48] familiar reading the Bible said these
[43:50] things said he after he saith unto them
[43:53] our friend Lazarus sleepeth sleepeth but
[43:56] I go that I may wake him out of his
[43:59] sleep then said his disciples Lord if he
[44:03] sleeps he shall do well how be it Jesus
[44:06] spake of his death but they thought he
[44:08] spoke of him taking a rest in sleep but
[44:11] then Jesus said unto them plainly
[44:13] Lazarus is dead and I am glad for your
[44:16] sakes that I was not there to the intent
[44:18] that you may believe nevertheless let us
[44:21] go unto him then said Thomas which is
[44:23] called dimus unto his fellow disciples
[44:25] let us also go that we may die with him
[44:28] and then Jesus came and he found that he
[44:30] had Lain in the grave 4 days already now
[44:34] Bethany was n un Jerusalem about 15
[44:37] furlongs off and many of the Jews came
[44:39] to Martha and to Mary to comfort them
[44:41] concerning their brother but then Martha
[44:43] as soon as she heard that Jesus was
[44:45] coming she went out and met him but Mary
[44:48] and uh sat still in the house and then
[44:51] said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou had
[44:54] us been here my brother had not not died
[44:58] but I know that even now whatsoever thou
[45:02] will ask of God God will give it thee
[45:05] Now isn't that isn't that something you
[45:06] got to notice here that it was her
[45:08] approach to the word of God brother man
[45:10] would use that in blind birus he said
[45:12] see if you come to a gift of God you've
[45:14] always got to come with the right
[45:15] approach or come with the right mental
[45:17] attitude so he said if you don't come
[45:18] with the right approach you'll never
[45:20] receive nothing so she says Lord I
[45:23] believe that that whatever th will ask
[45:26] of God God will give it to thee and
[45:28] Jesus said unto her thy brother shall
[45:30] rise again and Martha said to him I know
[45:33] that he shall rise again in the
[45:34] resurrection at the last day but Jesus
[45:36] said unto her I am the resurrection and
[45:39] the life and he that believeth in me
[45:42] though he were dead yet shall he live
[45:45] amen we want to preach this morning on
[45:48] bound to be free as you take your seats
[45:51] on bound to be free I know this is a
[45:54] very familiar reading and just to kind
[45:55] of lay a foundation this this morning uh
[45:58] we we realized that here as Jesus was
[46:02] entering into this place as he begin to
[46:04] talk to the disciples and telling them
[46:06] something uh that that he had saw by
[46:08] Vision knowing that Lazarus was going to
[46:10] raise from the dead and uh we realized
[46:13] that that that I I I'm a firm believer
[46:15] of this that uh that this was something
[46:17] that Jesus knew that you know no no
[46:19] doubt that they had sent word to him and
[46:21] told him that he was sick and they sent
[46:23] word and telling him that uh he was in a
[46:25] bad way and this was you realize that
[46:27] these were friends of Jesus they were
[46:29] very uh close friends and they were uh
[46:31] there was as family as there was family
[46:33] in order uh you know many times that he
[46:36] had sat in that very house and they had
[46:38] prepared meals for him and many time had
[46:40] had Fellowship in that way and but when
[46:42] they called upon him for healing but he
[46:44] didn't go and he delayed his coming and
[46:46] he delayed his his departure and the
[46:49] longer it got the sicker got and uh
[46:51] finally broke into this his sickness
[46:53] broke over into death and and as he
[46:55] would tell the disciples that you know
[46:58] uh that that he realized that that death
[47:00] had came to him and he went to tell the
[47:01] disciples that that Lazarus is sleeping
[47:04] and so they uh so they begin to make
[47:06] their Journey down to where Lazarus was
[47:08] and uh we realize whenever they came to
[47:11] this place that uh as as they went there
[47:14] I really believe this that Jesus knew
[47:16] the condition of Lazarus the whole time
[47:18] he knew that he was going to die and he
[47:20] knew that he was going to be raised
[47:21] again he knew that God was going to use
[47:23] him to show his glory he knew that there
[47:25] was something that had to be shown known
[47:27] in this time and Lazarus just happened
[47:29] to be the one that was anointed for the
[47:30] hour for God to be able to use as a as a
[47:33] sign of resurrection and uh so we we see
[47:36] as he went down to this place and and he
[47:39] came to where he was and and they come
[47:41] out to meet him and they come to speak
[47:42] to him and and but but as he came to
[47:45] this place as Jesus um as he as he come
[47:48] to the tomb and and you know you can see
[47:49] the scene as here these many Jews had
[47:51] gathered around and the family and the
[47:53] loved ones and here they were weeping
[47:54] and and crying and and see in this
[47:57] condition and but Jesus stood out there
[47:59] and and the Bible said he was grieved in
[48:01] his Spirit he he wept because of uh you
[48:03] know he had such a burden for the people
[48:05] and but as he stood in that place as he
[48:08] he looked out and here was a there was a
[48:10] man that was laying in a tomb and on
[48:12] that tomb was a stone that blocked him
[48:13] in and he comes out and he said take the
[48:16] stone off or the stone off of the Tomb
[48:18] and and roll it away let the let the
[48:20] cave be opened up and you know and here
[48:22] Martha said Lord you know he's been dead
[48:24] for 4 days I'm sure his body is stinking
[48:26] now he said but just get the stone out
[48:28] of the way and so as they rode the stone
[48:30] away and then the Bible says and he
[48:32] cried out with a loud voice Lazarus come
[48:35] forth and the Bible says when Jesus said
[48:37] the words Lazarus come forth that he
[48:40] that was dead came forth I always
[48:43] thought it was powerful that b he was he
[48:45] that was dead now he came forth and but
[48:47] the Bible says but whenever he came out
[48:49] he came out and he was bound at his
[48:51] hands and he was bound at his feet and
[48:54] he had a napkin over his face and he was
[48:56] bound
[48:57] with a napkin and brother Mark in other
[48:59] words all that he had was bound up even
[49:02] though he was called from the dead into
[49:04] the land of the living still yet he
[49:06] walked out after the resurrection and he
[49:08] walked out bound and you know I think
[49:10] that you look at from a spiritual sense
[49:11] but said according to To His abundant
[49:15] Mercy quoting what Peter said according
[49:17] to His abundant Mercy Heath begotten us
[49:19] again unto a lively Hope by the
[49:22] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[49:24] dead being born again not of a corrupt
[49:26] able seed but of an Incorruptible by the
[49:29] word of God which liveth and abideth
[49:32] forever so here we see this that that
[49:34] that Jesus has called us into this place
[49:37] of resurrection and here as we've seen
[49:39] just like Lazarus in the natural we saw
[49:41] this same thing in the spiritual that
[49:43] we've been called to a place of
[49:44] Resurrection you've been called to a new
[49:46] birth you've been called um uh uh to a
[49:49] uh to a new life or to be borned again
[49:51] and and you know what I find it many
[49:53] times that there are many people that
[49:55] are bound by many things things and you
[49:57] know you say well brother mat well I've
[49:58] had a new birth and you know I've been
[50:00] born again and I and I really believe
[50:01] that I say Amen but you know many times
[50:03] you'll find those that after they've
[50:05] been born and after their birth but
[50:07] still yet they're Bound by many things
[50:09] and what these are is brother wesy they
[50:10] are good people that are bound they are
[50:12] free people that are bound they are born
[50:15] again people that are bound they're
[50:16] people that have been called out of out
[50:18] of death and under life but still yet
[50:21] they come outbound and you know you if
[50:23] you ever go study the scripture you'll
[50:25] find out that no matter where you go in
[50:28] the Bible you'll find that God never
[50:30] wants his children to be bound somebody
[50:33] say amen he never wants his children to
[50:35] be bound you'll find them bound he's
[50:37] going to find a way to set them free
[50:38] because it's not the desire of God for
[50:40] you to be bound in any way it's not
[50:42] God's desire for your spirit to be bound
[50:45] up it's not his desire for you to be
[50:47] bound Up In the Flesh or bound up in
[50:49] your in your spirit or bound up in your
[50:51] walk with God it's God's desire let me
[50:52] just establish something this morning
[50:54] it's the desire of God for his children
[50:56] children to be free that's God's desire
[50:59] it's not his desire to be bound you know
[51:00] many places you find in the scripture
[51:02] and you'll find that the children of God
[51:04] were found in a place of bondage you
[51:06] even as as as back in the early church
[51:08] you'll see that they were they were the
[51:10] nicians and that was binding the
[51:12] children of God but we realize that this
[51:14] Spirit even in the early church now how
[51:16] many knows what nickon is there here it
[51:18] was a spirit that was binding God's
[51:20] church now that comes from a Greek word
[51:22] which was Nel which meant to conquer and
[51:25] then Leos which meant leoty so here this
[51:28] this word nickan it was a binding of the
[51:31] people of God and so we see even in the
[51:33] early Church in the Ephesus Church this
[51:35] was the good thing that God noticed
[51:37] about the church he said he said that
[51:40] you hate the Deeds of the nicians which
[51:42] I also hate but by the third Age The
[51:45] Very Deeds the things that they were
[51:46] doing had turned into the doctrine of
[51:48] the church so by the time we get to the
[51:50] perous age no longer was it just a deed
[51:53] but now it had became Doctrine where
[51:55] Jesus would say so you have uh this is
[51:58] what I hate about this age or this
[52:00] church age he said is that you also have
[52:02] them that hold the doctrine of the nians
[52:05] which thing I hate so now the very Deeds
[52:07] that they done now it had become
[52:09] Doctrine brother Bram said just to be
[52:10] plain with you he said in other words
[52:12] somebody was doing something in that
[52:14] early church that was Conquering the
[52:16] leoty somebody say Amen in other words
[52:18] they were being conquered so brother
[52:20] Mark if they were being conquered then
[52:22] there had to be an authority that was
[52:24] conquering them there had to be
[52:25] something that was was holding them or
[52:27] something that was binding them say so
[52:29] see in other words the people they were
[52:31] being subjected somehow in a way that
[52:34] was absolutely contrary to the word of
[52:36] God now think of this these are God's
[52:38] children this is God's church this is
[52:40] God's people but somehow someway they
[52:42] were being subjected to in a way that
[52:44] was contrary to the word of God in other
[52:46] words they were brought subject in a
[52:48] contrary way now let me just lay a a
[52:50] foundation here this morning it's not
[52:53] bad to be under subjection can I just
[52:55] say that that way it's not bad to be
[52:57] subject it's not bad to be under
[52:58] subjection matter of fact the Bible
[53:00] would teach us to the contrary it would
[53:02] say that to be subjection means to
[53:04] surrender to another's control but the
[53:07] question is is what are you surrendering
[53:09] to see it's not bad to be subject it's
[53:11] not bad to be under subjection but the
[53:13] question is what are you being under
[53:14] subjection to I tell you what James said
[53:17] he said wherefore God sayith God
[53:19] resisteth the proud but but but giveth
[53:21] grace to the humble so therefore submit
[53:24] yourselves therefore to God so it's okay
[53:27] to submit but submit to the right thing
[53:29] he said submit yourselves to God and
[53:31] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[53:34] even Peter would write about it he said
[53:35] humble yourselves under God's Mighty
[53:37] hand and God will lift you up Paul in
[53:40] Ephesians the five fth chapter he would
[53:42] use the natural relationship between a
[53:44] husband and wife to type uh the
[53:46] relationship between Christ and the
[53:48] church remember what he said he said
[53:50] wives submit yourselves to your husbands
[53:53] as unto the Lord for the husband is the
[53:55] head of the wife even as Christ is the
[53:57] head of the church and he is the savior
[53:59] of the body therefore as the church is
[54:02] subject unto Christ so let the wives be
[54:05] to their own husbands in everything now
[54:08] I know there's many evil-minded men that
[54:10] have taken this scripture and abused it
[54:12] and and and used it to put a I'll just
[54:15] put that woman in her place that's what
[54:16] they say you know I I'll just keep her
[54:18] down here and I'll put her under my foot
[54:20] and I'll just rule over and I I'm the
[54:21] head of my household I'm the king of my
[54:23] you know these evil-minded men that try
[54:25] to rule over their life in some evil way
[54:27] like that but they failed to read the
[54:29] rest of I may as well just pre may as
[54:30] well give it all to you this morning but
[54:32] they failed to read the rest of the
[54:33] scripture where Peter said but also or
[54:36] Paul said husbands also love your wives
[54:38] as Christ loved the church and gave
[54:41] himself for it so ought to men love
[54:43] their wives as their own bodies so all
[54:47] this stuff you do and I'm going to give
[54:48] you some free pastoring but all this
[54:50] stuff you do to take care of you and you
[54:52] got to make sure your your belly's full
[54:53] and make sure you feel good and make
[54:55] sure you're comfortable make sure
[54:57] everything works to your liking but PA
[54:58] but Paul said but you ought to love your
[55:01] wife as your own body for he that loveth
[55:04] his wife loveth himself so then he
[55:06] speaks so he makes a good balance and
[55:08] when the husband gets in his position
[55:09] it's a lot easier for the wife to get
[55:11] into hers amen somebody thank you
[55:13] brother man preach it I believe I will
[55:15] concerning the church listen what Paul
[55:17] said he said therefore as the church he
[55:19] said submit yourselves one to another
[55:22] submit one to another in the fear of God
[55:25] so it's not bad to be under submission
[55:27] but submit to the right thing say see so
[55:29] we submit ourselves one to another in
[55:31] other words we ought to be accountable
[55:33] one to another and subject one to
[55:35] another according to the word of God in
[55:37] Philippians the Bible say let nothing be
[55:39] done in strive for vain Glory but in
[55:41] humility Let each esteem other better
[55:44] than themselves now this is not a
[55:46] suggestion this is the nature of a
[55:48] Believer to esteem others better than
[55:51] yourself you know why because God hates
[55:53] that old evil highminded selfish
[55:56] attitude that people have that
[55:58] everything is about them and every
[55:59] Everything has to take care of their
[56:01] feelings and their likings and has to
[56:03] fit the way they see it or the way like
[56:04] it God hates that Spirit he he doesn't
[56:07] like it he said we ought to we ought to
[56:08] prefer our brother we ought to we ought
[56:10] to prefer our sister that's the nature
[56:12] of a Believer for the Bible says look
[56:14] not every man on his own things but look
[56:17] every man on the things of others in
[56:19] other words consider your brother and
[56:21] consider your sister you know oh I know
[56:23] it gets a little Sicky when you get into
[56:25] this but sometimes better if you can
[56:27] consider their feelings and consider
[56:28] what they're going through and consider
[56:30] what what caused them to to act the way
[56:32] that they act see but the Bible says
[56:33] consider one another and I I'm not just
[56:36] preaching this so you can hear it I'm
[56:37] preaching it to you so you so it can
[56:39] change you that this is the nature of a
[56:40] Believer this is the way we ought to be
[56:42] the Bible said let this mind this is
[56:44] where this scripture come from he said
[56:46] let this mind be in you which was also
[56:49] in Christ Jesus this was the mind that
[56:52] Christ had was to consider the other it
[56:54] was a it was to be a servant to to the
[56:56] world it was to consider his Brethren or
[56:58] his sister the mind of Christ is to
[57:00] serve the mind of Christ is to be humble
[57:02] the mind of Christ is to be little and
[57:04] not to be big the mind of Christ is to
[57:07] be is to go to the cross of Calvary and
[57:09] pay and pay a way that you wouldn't have
[57:11] to bear the cross the mind of Christ is
[57:13] to carry your burden and this is the
[57:16] nature that the Bible teaches us to have
[57:18] is to carry one another's burden lift
[57:20] one another edify one another keep them
[57:23] help them strengthen them along the way
[57:25] it ain't to fight H against each other
[57:27] it's not to fight against Authority it's
[57:29] not even uh to keep from being subject
[57:31] under Authority but it's to be subject
[57:33] to the right thing and be subject to the
[57:35] right Spirit you know many times you'll
[57:37] find this because we're a Triune being
[57:38] how many believe that we're a Triune
[57:40] being we're made of a body Soul and
[57:42] Spirit and because we're Body Soul and
[57:44] Spirit we realize that our spirit is
[57:47] subject to spirits and so sometimes
[57:49] sometimes we surrender to the wrong
[57:51] Spirit we allow this flesh to get under
[57:54] the subjection to wrong spirits and
[57:55] Friends what happens is because we're in
[57:58] a spirit realm and in this Spirit realm
[58:00] a spirit gets a hold of a person it'll
[58:02] take them and it'll completely change
[58:04] their nature and you know them very well
[58:05] and you're not that's not like them
[58:07] that's not like her to to act that way
[58:09] it's not like that brother to lash out
[58:11] like that it's not it's not like him to
[58:13] ignore you it's not like her see because
[58:15] we prefer one another and because we
[58:17] know one another and we're we're
[58:18] brothers and sisters in Christ then we
[58:20] realize that sometimes that Spirits get
[58:22] a hold of people and they cause them to
[58:24] do or say things that they don't mean to
[58:26] say or they don't mean to do I know what
[58:28] we want to do we want to cut their head
[58:29] off but let me I I'll just tell you
[58:31] where that Spirit comes from it come
[58:32] from the same place that caused them to
[58:34] act out in the first place so we just
[58:36] want to identify being subject to the
[58:38] wrong thing sometimes in our spirit we
[58:40] get subjected to the wrong thing and
[58:42] demon powers they control you and they
[58:44] build they they they control your
[58:47] thoughts and they control your actions
[58:49] and can you imagine it this morning that
[58:51] an actual demon a spirit would would
[58:53] would to take control of a human being
[58:55] it would C them to do certain things or
[58:57] say things but you say well brother man
[58:59] I I I just don't see how that happens
[59:01] but it's a reality you realize you
[59:03] realize what a demon is see a demon or a
[59:06] devil in our English language is is is a
[59:08] Tormentor that's that's what is
[59:10] identified as a as a demon so in other
[59:12] words it's a fellow that torments
[59:14] brother said a fellow that torments is a
[59:16] devil it's an evil one and demons are
[59:18] tormentors that torment Us in other
[59:20] words a Tormentor is a person who
[59:23] inflicts severe mental or physical s
[59:26] suffering on someone else so notice it's
[59:28] not a person that's doing it it's a
[59:30] demon that does it it's a Tormentor
[59:32] that's why when you when you see
[59:33] somebody that's just torturing or a big
[59:35] old bully just that's tormenting
[59:36] somebody well you say well that's pure
[59:38] demonic well it is demonic because it's
[59:40] a demon power that is behind them
[59:43] causing them to do it it's a demon let
[59:45] me just be straight with you it's a
[59:46] demon that is attached to your spirit it
[59:48] gets in your spirit and it begins to
[59:50] cause you to say things and and do
[59:52] things and before long you look back and
[59:54] say well I don't know why I even ask
[59:56] acted like that I I love that person I
[59:58] don't know why I even said that or why
[1:00:00] why why why would I even do something
[1:00:01] like that because sometimes demons being
[1:00:03] a spirit they use our flesh they get in
[1:00:05] control of our flesh and then they use
[1:00:07] us to do and say things you say well I I
[1:00:09] don't really believe demons can do that
[1:00:11] well let me just take you to the Bible
[1:00:12] you remember the story of Ahab and the
[1:00:14] prophet Micaiah when he would come and
[1:00:16] warn him about going into battle
[1:00:18] remember when he come down he said he
[1:00:19] had 400 prophets that said go into
[1:00:21] battle but when Micaiah came he said but
[1:00:23] no but I see when I looked out I seen
[1:00:26] Israel as a shepher or as sheep without
[1:00:28] a Shepherd that their Shepherd had
[1:00:30] fallen in battle and they were all
[1:00:31] scattered and they they were going back
[1:00:33] to their homes they had nothing to go
[1:00:34] back to because they went into this
[1:00:36] battle and Ahab said but I have 400
[1:00:38] prophets that says contrary he said but
[1:00:40] let me tell you about those prophets he
[1:00:42] said I also saw at the Throne of God I
[1:00:45] saw a lying Spirit come to the throne of
[1:00:47] God and say Lord would you send me down
[1:00:50] and I will anoint those prophets that
[1:00:51] they will lie to Ahab and allow thy
[1:00:54] judgment to come upon him so here lying
[1:00:56] spirits that came down they were sent
[1:00:58] from the Throne of God and they anointed
[1:01:00] men and caused those men to prophesy
[1:01:02] lies unto Ahab that would cause him to
[1:01:05] go into battle that the Judgment of God
[1:01:07] would come about so Spirits can get on
[1:01:09] people Spirits can control people
[1:01:11] Spirits can cause you to say things they
[1:01:13] can cause you to do things demonic
[1:01:15] spirits you said you mean the devil can
[1:01:17] use my tongue but abam said certainly he
[1:01:19] does he'll make you say things that you
[1:01:21] don't want to say he'll make you lie
[1:01:24] he'll make you steal he'll make you tell
[1:01:25] tell things that ain't right he'll make
[1:01:27] you say bad words that God don't want
[1:01:29] you to say when the devil gets complete
[1:01:32] control of you there ain't no telling
[1:01:33] what you will do see a spirit that can
[1:01:36] get a hold of a human body said if he
[1:01:38] ever gets all the way control of you you
[1:01:40] don't know what you're going to say you
[1:01:42] just become a mad man that's like that
[1:01:45] the the man the the gatan that went out
[1:01:48] remember Legion had so many demons on
[1:01:51] him that that he couldn't even be
[1:01:52] identified of who of who he was he he
[1:01:55] was F with so many demons that when they
[1:01:57] would put chains on him he would break
[1:01:59] the chains he would he they they
[1:02:00] couldn't bind him they he was living out
[1:02:02] in caves he was an outcast to society
[1:02:05] and you know you know the prophet would
[1:02:07] tell us that every bit of that happened
[1:02:08] to that man because of one little lie
[1:02:11] that he told think about it it had to
[1:02:13] start with something he didn't he wasn't
[1:02:15] just an open vessel and filled with all
[1:02:17] these demons but it started with one
[1:02:19] thing and that's what devil does is
[1:02:21] Satan will use anything to bring you
[1:02:23] subject unto him I'm trying to to show
[1:02:25] you what the devil trying to do this
[1:02:26] morning he's trying to make you subject
[1:02:29] unto him and he'll use anything to do it
[1:02:31] he'll use a little lie or he'll use a
[1:02:33] little drug or he'll use a little music
[1:02:36] or he'll use a little perversion he'll
[1:02:38] use a little of anything to open the
[1:02:40] door to allow him to come into this body
[1:02:43] in the spirit realm because he he knows
[1:02:45] the weakness of the flesh he's always
[1:02:47] tormenting he's trying to find a way to
[1:02:49] torment you to bring you down that that
[1:02:51] he could use you and you'd be so
[1:02:53] tormented that you wouldn't be able to
[1:02:54] find your way out he's trying to find a
[1:02:57] way to bind the people of God that's
[1:03:00] right but let me tell you though you may
[1:03:01] fall subject to a demon Spirit can I
[1:03:04] just say it this way this morning you
[1:03:05] don't have to remain that way though you
[1:03:08] fall subject to a demonic power you
[1:03:11] don't have to remain that way it may get
[1:03:13] on your spirit and maybe go for a few
[1:03:15] days or a few weeks or a few months some
[1:03:17] people a few years that that demon power
[1:03:20] would control the way you act or react
[1:03:22] or the way you talk to one another but
[1:03:24] here you are you're a son of God and the
[1:03:26] daughter of God and you don't have to
[1:03:27] remain that way but one day it'll come a
[1:03:30] time like it was when Jesus came across
[1:03:32] the sea and he met that gaan standing
[1:03:34] there and the Bible says when Jesus
[1:03:36] looked into his eyes the demon spoke out
[1:03:38] of him he said what have I to do with
[1:03:40] thee oh Jesus of Nazareth let me tell
[1:03:42] you what he done he peered past the
[1:03:44] flesh Through The Eyes of Flesh into the
[1:03:47] spirit of a man and he talked to the
[1:03:49] demon that was on the inside of it and
[1:03:51] said you have no right to linger in that
[1:03:53] vessel any longer you have no right to
[1:03:56] to inhabit that house any longer and I
[1:03:59] command you to leave and the demon came
[1:04:01] out of the man think about this demon
[1:04:04] there was so many that was on upon him
[1:04:06] he said what is thy name he said our
[1:04:08] name is Legion for we are many you think
[1:04:12] about that Old Demon for he he could
[1:04:14] have been outnumbered a million to one
[1:04:15] but let me tell you something about
[1:04:17] Jesus Christ there ain't no number of
[1:04:20] demons that ever outnumber the Son of
[1:04:22] God there ain't no number of demons
[1:04:24] that'll ever have power power over the
[1:04:26] Son of God demons are powerless before
[1:04:30] him Spirits are powerless before him all
[1:04:34] of death and hell they're powerless
[1:04:36] before him sickness is powerless before
[1:04:39] him death is powerless before him evil
[1:04:42] spirits are powerless before
[1:04:44] him and not only are they powerless
[1:04:47] before him you think about him may see
[1:04:51] what happened with Lazarus here Lazar
[1:04:54] Lazarus was laying in a grave filled
[1:04:56] with death his life had left his body
[1:04:59] but even death couldn't hold him Jesus
[1:05:02] all he did was called out his name he
[1:05:04] said Lazarus come forth and inside of
[1:05:07] that grave inside of that old body that
[1:05:10] was laying there that had no life in it
[1:05:12] the real life of Lazarus came and it
[1:05:15] inhabited that body again and that body
[1:05:17] stood up and he began to walk he called
[1:05:20] him out of the grave and let me tell you
[1:05:22] this when he called him out he didn't
[1:05:24] call him out to keep him bound but he
[1:05:26] called him called him out that he could
[1:05:27] go free he didn't call him to leave him
[1:05:30] in that condition he called him that he
[1:05:32] could stand and be a free man just like
[1:05:34] he called you when God called you he
[1:05:36] didn't called you for you to be bound he
[1:05:38] didn't call you you weren't born again
[1:05:40] to remain bound you wasn't born again to
[1:05:42] let to to be uh inflicted with death in
[1:05:45] your spirit you was born again to be a
[1:05:47] free son and daughter of God and your
[1:05:49] spirit to be free of the things of the
[1:05:51] devil that would have you bound you were
[1:05:54] born to be free you were called called
[1:05:56] raised and
[1:05:58] loosed that's what God done for us today
[1:06:01] he walked out there all bound up in
[1:06:04] those grave clothes I can just see
[1:06:05] Lazarus when he come out can you imagine
[1:06:07] the scene I I know you know the story
[1:06:10] but can you imagine the scene this
[1:06:11] morning he said Lazarus come forth I can
[1:06:13] imagine here he walked out there I know
[1:06:15] some of y'all May some saw some of it
[1:06:17] this week but here was the real thing he
[1:06:19] come out there he was all bound up the
[1:06:20] Bible said his feet was bound his hands
[1:06:23] was bound with grave clothes his feet
[1:06:25] was bound with grave clothes his face
[1:06:27] was bound with a napkin with grave
[1:06:29] clothes hear this old mummified looking
[1:06:31] grave cloth rap man come walking out of
[1:06:33] the grave but that ain't the way that
[1:06:35] Jesus had intended on him being he I
[1:06:37] called you for a reason and I didn't
[1:06:39] call you to walk around like a dead man
[1:06:41] I didn't call you to limp around like a
[1:06:43] dead man I didn't call you that you
[1:06:45] couldn't speak like a man that hadn't
[1:06:47] come to Li but I called you to live I
[1:06:49] called you I raised you I called you I
[1:06:52] called you out of this place he called
[1:06:54] you out of the Grave he gave you life
[1:06:56] that you wouldn't be bound but you'd be
[1:06:57] free and Jesus looked over at him oh I
[1:07:00] can just see him standing there hear
[1:07:02] that man come out and as the crowd begin
[1:07:03] to back up in my I don't know what just
[1:07:06] happened here a man come out of the
[1:07:07] Grave did somebody check his pulse I
[1:07:09] checked his pul four days ago I checked
[1:07:11] his PA he come out there you know what
[1:07:13] Emanuel when he came out he still stunk
[1:07:15] like a dead man he still looked like a
[1:07:17] dead man he had grave clothes all over
[1:07:19] but it wasn't enough to leave him in
[1:07:21] that place but Jesus said I say loose
[1:07:23] him and let him free
[1:07:26] you know what they done they took the
[1:07:27] grave clothes off of the man they took
[1:07:29] the napkin off of his face they Unbound
[1:07:32] his feet and they Unbound his hands that
[1:07:34] he could move again he could walk a
[1:07:36] little bit he could raise his hand a
[1:07:37] little he was free to serve God loose
[1:07:41] him and let him free he said you were
[1:07:43] called raised and
[1:07:46] loosed he didn't just born it you didn't
[1:07:49] just get a new birth to stay bound but
[1:07:51] he was raised and loosed let me tell you
[1:07:54] this not only is Satan powerless before
[1:07:57] Jesus but he's also can I say it this
[1:08:00] way he's just as powerless before his
[1:08:04] name that's what the Bible said can you
[1:08:07] think of it he's even powerless before
[1:08:09] the name of Jesus well the devil don't
[1:08:11] like this I'm going to preach it I can
[1:08:13] just feel it he don't like it Oh Glory
[1:08:15] thank you Lord he don't like it I'm
[1:08:16] going to preach it you know why he's
[1:08:18] powerless before the name of Jesus you
[1:08:20] remember when Jesus sent his disciples
[1:08:22] out the 70 and they went in he said you
[1:08:24] go into every house and you witness you
[1:08:26] tell of the gospel and they went out and
[1:08:28] they laid hands on sick and the sick
[1:08:29] recovered and demons left people and
[1:08:31] they came back when they gave their
[1:08:33] testimony of all the work that had been
[1:08:35] done the Bible says when they returned
[1:08:36] with joy they said even the devils are
[1:08:38] subject to us through thy name and Jesus
[1:08:41] said I saw Satan as a lightning fall
[1:08:43] from Heaven he said behold I give unto
[1:08:45] you power to tread on serpents and
[1:08:48] scorpions and over all the power of the
[1:08:50] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[1:08:53] hurt you you me read that to you again
[1:08:54] since the devil don't want you to hear
[1:08:56] it he said I give unto you power to
[1:08:59] tread on serpents I give you power to
[1:09:02] tread on scor and over all the power of
[1:09:05] the enemy and nothing shall by any means
[1:09:07] hurt you I know what the devil does he
[1:09:09] wants to remind you of the scripture you
[1:09:11] know because Jesus did say it after all
[1:09:13] every time you hear that you know Jesus
[1:09:15] said Rejoice not that Spirits are
[1:09:17] subject unto you but rather Rejoice
[1:09:19] because your names are written in heaven
[1:09:22] I say Amen but do you realize that the
[1:09:25] only only reason you have power over the
[1:09:27] enemy is because your name is written in
[1:09:29] heaven the only reason you have power
[1:09:31] over the devil is because of who you are
[1:09:34] that's your that's your identification
[1:09:35] you realize that having that Revelation
[1:09:38] is what causes the church to Rejoice you
[1:09:41] remember what John saw when he looked up
[1:09:43] there he said I saw him sitting upon the
[1:09:46] throne in the right hand of him that
[1:09:48] said he had a book and on the backside
[1:09:50] it was sealed with Seven Seals he said
[1:09:52] but I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:09:54] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[1:09:56] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[1:09:59] and I looked in all over the world there
[1:10:01] was no man that was found worthy to open
[1:10:04] the book there was no man that could
[1:10:06] loose the seal he said and I wept much
[1:10:08] because no man was worthy to find the
[1:10:10] book and neither to read the book or to
[1:10:12] even look their own but then as John was
[1:10:14] set in this place and here he found that
[1:10:16] there was no man worthy there was no man
[1:10:18] that could open the book and there's no
[1:10:20] man that could take it and there's no
[1:10:21] man that could loose it and reveal it to
[1:10:23] the people he said and then one of the
[1:10:25] elders said weep not John for the line
[1:10:28] of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to
[1:10:30] open the book and you know what he done
[1:10:32] he turned around to see that great line
[1:10:35] he turned around to see that great
[1:10:36] warrior of the tribe of Judah and when
[1:10:39] John turned he said when I turn I saw a
[1:10:41] lamb that had been slain before the
[1:10:44] foundation of the world he slain it in
[1:10:46] this in the mind of God that one day we
[1:10:49] would come down to this place that he
[1:10:50] would go before the cross of Calvary he
[1:10:53] would be slain and stripped of his life
[1:10:55] that he would stand there before the
[1:10:56] Throne of God and be victorious over the
[1:10:59] devil and take the book of life and open
[1:11:01] it to the people of God that you may
[1:11:04] know who you are said he opened the book
[1:11:07] and John said when I saw it you know
[1:11:09] what he saw he saw his name written
[1:11:11] there he said when I saw it he said
[1:11:13] everything in heaven everything in the
[1:11:15] earth everything under the Earth
[1:11:17] everything that dwell in the Seas heard
[1:11:19] I John shouting blessing and honor and
[1:11:23] glory to him and Power to him that set
[1:11:26] it upon the throne and to the lamb
[1:11:28] forever and ever see why was he shouting
[1:11:31] about because he saw his name that's the
[1:11:33] same thing with you and I you know you
[1:11:36] that you know why we're why the there's
[1:11:37] so much joy in the church but because we
[1:11:39] found our name written in the book we
[1:11:41] know who you realize that's what the
[1:11:42] whole church world uh can't do they can
[1:11:45] search the whole entire Bible but they
[1:11:47] can't find their identity in the Bible
[1:11:49] you say where' your church come from
[1:11:50] well well you know it come from the book
[1:11:52] of Acts they all say that but but but
[1:11:54] then they changed the the very
[1:11:56] identification of what the book of Acts
[1:11:57] church was and try to identify with the
[1:11:59] same thing isn't that just the spirit of
[1:12:01] our world today try to be one thing and
[1:12:03] identifies another he said but there had
[1:12:05] to be a reality there had to be a real
[1:12:07] identification there has to be somebody
[1:12:09] that can look back and say that's what I
[1:12:11] am because that's the character the
[1:12:13] characteristics they have and I bear the
[1:12:15] same characteristic this morning see so
[1:12:18] they search for their identity we're all
[1:12:20] looking for this but when the book was
[1:12:21] open listen when the book came open and
[1:12:24] then Jesus CHR CHR himself came in his
[1:12:26] Spirit to reveal who you are in this end
[1:12:30] time that you're the Bride of Jesus
[1:12:32] Christ see it wasn't until the opening
[1:12:34] of these seals that you realize who the
[1:12:36] Bride of Jesus Christ was it's not
[1:12:37] talked about in the church world this
[1:12:39] isn't we're not trying to be the bride
[1:12:41] we're trying to be the church isn't that
[1:12:42] the church we're trying to be the church
[1:12:44] we're the Church of God but here when
[1:12:45] the book became open now all of a sudden
[1:12:47] the Revelation uh is open to the
[1:12:49] believer it says you're not the church
[1:12:51] you're the bride the church separated
[1:12:54] you're the C out and then you can go
[1:12:56] back into the whole scripture and you
[1:12:58] find out everything in the Bible was
[1:13:00] written about you it wasn't to talk
[1:13:01] about the church at all it was to talk
[1:13:03] about the bride that's what happened
[1:13:05] when Israel came out of Egypt it was a
[1:13:07] type of a bride being called out of a
[1:13:09] church a nation out of a Nation said
[1:13:12] you're the Bride of Jesus Christ right
[1:13:14] in the middle of this church World
[1:13:16] here's the bride here's here's my
[1:13:18] beloved here here's Mrs Jesus and you
[1:13:21] realize that because of who you are that
[1:13:24] the devil can't rule over you and then
[1:13:27] because of who you are for the Tom he
[1:13:29] has no authority over you so I can say
[1:13:31] that this morning I'm not rejoicing
[1:13:33] because because Spirits are subject to
[1:13:36] me but I'm rejoicing because I'm not
[1:13:39] subject to
[1:13:40] them because of who you are you don't
[1:13:43] have to be subject to the devil said my
[1:13:46] my name is written on the Lamb's Book of
[1:13:49] Life I'm rejoicing because I saw my name
[1:13:52] I'm rejoicing because who I am Bible
[1:13:54] says is Rejoice ever more we got a right
[1:13:57] to Rejoice don't you realize I'm not
[1:13:59] rejoicing in my power I'm rejoicing in
[1:14:01] my Liberty I'm rejoicing in my freedom I
[1:14:04] believe we have a right to it we got a
[1:14:05] we got a right as a body of Believers to
[1:14:07] Rejoice this is what a prophet said he
[1:14:09] said Christ was sent to you the
[1:14:11] Believers and you have a right to enjoy
[1:14:14] his fellowship and His blessings and
[1:14:16] everything that he died for you've got a
[1:14:19] right to enjoy it I got news for you I
[1:14:22] enjoy the presence of God I enjoy the
[1:14:25] blessings of God I I enjoy the word of
[1:14:27] God I enjoy coming to church I I enjoy
[1:14:29] to hear the preaching of the word I
[1:14:30] enjoy gospel singing it brings a joy to
[1:14:33] me I enjoy it said you've got a right to
[1:14:36] it see n think about it if a demon
[1:14:39] Spirit an evil spirit can take a man's
[1:14:42] life completely control it till he has
[1:14:45] no control over himself then what about
[1:14:47] a Holy Spirit what would it do am I am I
[1:14:50] do I got
[1:14:51] time if what about the Holy Spirit demon
[1:14:55] Spirit can take a man into such control
[1:14:57] cause him to say things and do things
[1:15:00] now it's easy to see that we see many
[1:15:02] people like that man's demon possessed
[1:15:03] he wouldn't do that if he didn't have
[1:15:04] demons it's he's got to be demon
[1:15:06] possessed but if a demon Spirit can do
[1:15:08] it what about a Holy Spirit what about
[1:15:10] the spirit of God if it could ever get
[1:15:12] complete control of a person what would
[1:15:14] it do you think about it you you you
[1:15:17] know some of you that that that like
[1:15:19] Watchers I know brother West he's got
[1:15:20] quite the watch collection he he likes
[1:15:22] he likes Watchers you know the old old
[1:15:25] watches they used to run on a on a
[1:15:27] tension coil which was called a main
[1:15:29] spring so if you take a watch and that
[1:15:31] watch inside of it had has all sorts of
[1:15:34] Gears the old the old uh uh big
[1:15:36] grandfather clocks and the and and and
[1:15:38] alarm clocks everything used to be made
[1:15:40] this way and now of course they have
[1:15:41] mechanical or or they have automatic
[1:15:44] watches and that that are made and all
[1:15:46] this but but here these mechanical
[1:15:48] watches they were they had all these
[1:15:50] gears but the problem is is because all
[1:15:52] these gears are connected and they're
[1:15:53] connected to all the hands but the gears
[1:15:56] can never turn on their own see they had
[1:15:58] to have a power source so the old watch
[1:16:00] makers in the middle of this you can't
[1:16:02] you can't hardly see one but if you ever
[1:16:03] look at one there's a there's a there's
[1:16:05] a hundreds it seems like hundreds of of
[1:16:08] little teeth and gears all through this
[1:16:09] watch and and in the middle of it right
[1:16:11] in the center there's this tiny little
[1:16:12] button that that just looks like a
[1:16:14] little brass piece and and but inside of
[1:16:16] that brass piece is what they call a
[1:16:18] main spring and that main spring is a
[1:16:21] tension coil and so it's it's it's it's
[1:16:23] notched all the way around it and so
[1:16:25] what they do is the watchmaker as he
[1:16:26] would put that in there and of course
[1:16:28] that little piece of metal it's notched
[1:16:30] all the way around it and so it it can
[1:16:31] grab a hold of those gears with The
[1:16:33] Notches so they actually wind up that
[1:16:35] tension coil inside of a main spring
[1:16:37] until it would become so tight and what
[1:16:39] happens is as a coil is tighten it's a
[1:16:42] little science lesson but as a coil is
[1:16:44] tightened it builds up an energy that
[1:16:46] it's trying to release so it's tighten
[1:16:48] that's why a spring bounces because the
[1:16:50] energy that's built up in it by
[1:16:51] compressing it or suppressing it it's
[1:16:53] building up an energy and something in
[1:16:55] the energy eventually the Energy's got
[1:16:57] to give it's it's trying to find a place
[1:16:58] to let go or or or or the power to be
[1:17:00] able to come out of it and so as they
[1:17:02] wind it up that it it has a stored power
[1:17:05] on the inside of this main spring and as
[1:17:08] this power or this stored power as it as
[1:17:10] it begins to unwind it releases the
[1:17:13] power that's in that main spring begins
[1:17:16] to release under the mechanics of the
[1:17:18] watch and so now as that power begins to
[1:17:21] release it starts to turn and now with
[1:17:23] the Restriction in the gears that you
[1:17:25] built in it causes the hands to move a
[1:17:27] little bit so it starts to it changes
[1:17:29] time and then the the little the second
[1:17:31] hand it starts ticking why is it ticking
[1:17:34] it has no power on its own it can't
[1:17:36] control its ticking it can't control its
[1:17:38] movement but there's a mainspring on the
[1:17:40] inside of it that's releasing a power
[1:17:43] and as the power is released then the
[1:17:45] hand can't do nothing but go because
[1:17:47] it's attached to the Gear see the Power
[1:17:49] released in the mechanics it begins to
[1:17:50] move but said so this is what happens
[1:17:53] when the Holy Spirit comes in he said
[1:17:55] there's something that moves you you may
[1:17:57] not be able to understand what it is but
[1:17:59] it's a supernatural being inside of you
[1:18:02] it's moving and it's controlling your
[1:18:04] emotions it'll make you scream when you
[1:18:07] don't feel like screaming it'll make you
[1:18:08] run when you don't feel like running
[1:18:10] it'll make you shout when you don't feel
[1:18:12] like shouting it'll make you pra he said
[1:18:14] it'll make you praise God automatically
[1:18:17] you don't even have no control over it
[1:18:19] what's happening there something on the
[1:18:21] inside of you that causes you to praise
[1:18:23] God it's a power sword and inside you
[1:18:26] this power that is tore is unwinding and
[1:18:29] it's releasing its power into the
[1:18:31] mechanics of this human body and now all
[1:18:33] those mechanics that have been built up
[1:18:35] all of a sudden they begin to move
[1:18:36] differently they the alarm clock goes
[1:18:39] off and it wakes you up in the middle of
[1:18:40] the night why because there's a power on
[1:18:42] the inside of it that's releasing in the
[1:18:44] mechanics you say what is it he said
[1:18:46] it's the spring of God's grace in the
[1:18:49] middle of your heart it's controlling
[1:18:52] you making you shun evil making you
[1:18:54] leave accept life and Lead death and get
[1:18:57] away from doubt and have faith let me
[1:18:59] tell you friends we may as well have
[1:19:00] church anyway but you may not have moved
[1:19:03] in years but when you you may have been
[1:19:05] walking around you may have had your
[1:19:07] hands down you may have been tied up
[1:19:09] they may have been hanging down there
[1:19:10] both hands around 6:00 for a lot of
[1:19:12] years but all of a sudden there's a
[1:19:14] power on the inside of you and when the
[1:19:16] Master Watch makes her when he releases
[1:19:19] that power it begins to move and now
[1:19:21] those same oh let me tell you it changes
[1:19:23] you that same old hand they begin to
[1:19:26] come up in the air the ones that
[1:19:28] couldn't praise God now they begin to
[1:19:30] praise and the voice that couldn't speak
[1:19:32] now it begins to speak again the legs
[1:19:34] that couldn't move now they begin to run
[1:19:36] again why something happened on the
[1:19:38] inside of you you have no control over
[1:19:41] yourself it's a main spring it's the
[1:19:43] spring of God's grace oh my used to you
[1:19:46] walk in church you walk in and people
[1:19:48] would look at them am I here they come
[1:19:50] here sister droops and brother drab but
[1:19:53] now all of a sudden that m gets a hold
[1:19:55] of you and you get a name change now
[1:19:57] it's sister joy and brother glad
[1:19:59] something happened on the inside of you
[1:20:01] that has control over you he said that
[1:20:04] mainspring it'll make you cast down all
[1:20:06] your reasoning it'll cause you to accept
[1:20:08] God's word you go 40 years being one way
[1:20:11] but you let that main spring turn loose
[1:20:13] all of a sudden he said it's moving it's
[1:20:14] ticking it's going around and around
[1:20:16] it'll make your whole emotion come right
[1:20:18] in control with God what a marvelous
[1:20:21] thing that it is when the Holy Spirit
[1:20:24] controls you
[1:20:25] see you become a new creation that's why
[1:20:28] you can tell it's not it's not hard to
[1:20:29] identify some people say well M what
[1:20:31] discernment you have to recognize that
[1:20:34] somebody's not under the control of the
[1:20:35] Holy Spirit and they're being controlled
[1:20:37] by a demon they don't take a lot of
[1:20:38] discernment it's the characteristic of
[1:20:41] the of the flesh is is showing you what
[1:20:44] is controlling them on the inside that
[1:20:46] don't mean they're lost hello it don't
[1:20:48] mean they're not a son of God or not a
[1:20:50] daughter of God it didn't mean Lazarus
[1:20:52] was still dead he was just bound
[1:20:54] come on but it had to be something to
[1:20:56] release
[1:20:57] power see when the Holy Spirit controls
[1:21:00] you says you become a new creation
[1:21:03] because the life of Jesus Christ has
[1:21:05] took your spirit into controlling you
[1:21:07] you're a new creature and once purged it
[1:21:10] has no more desire of sin as long as you
[1:21:12] live on this
[1:21:14] Earth what the main spring does my I'm
[1:21:18] too I'm too
[1:21:19] long can I can I can I read you
[1:21:21] something this might get a little sticky
[1:21:23] but I'm going to read it to you anyway I
[1:21:25] believe y'all been here long enough I
[1:21:26] couldn't run
[1:21:27] yall said you know word the word
[1:21:30] wouldn't never run off a Believer anyway
[1:21:31] would it so you know the real Christian
[1:21:33] way is to hide everything from a
[1:21:36] brother understand this in other words
[1:21:39] don't tell his bad things just tell his
[1:21:41] good
[1:21:42] things just tell what you know about him
[1:21:44] is good if anything's bad let it alone
[1:21:47] I'm showing you the nature of the
[1:21:49] mainspring said the poor Fell's got
[1:21:51] enough against him anyhow don't try to
[1:21:53] take a pole and shove him in the ditch
[1:21:55] the Christian attitude is to pick him up
[1:21:56] and take him out of the ditch don't ever
[1:21:58] try to shove him down he's already down
[1:22:01] try to help him up too many today too
[1:22:04] many people today try to do that said if
[1:22:07] I could get something other on them that
[1:22:09] they could say was really bad then we
[1:22:12] can use that for our conversation that
[1:22:14] we can talk about how bad they are you
[1:22:16] know how it is is some they they want to
[1:22:18] hurt and tear down
[1:22:20] others said but see that's what the
[1:22:22] Pharisees done the leaders of the that
[1:22:24] day they always tried to belittle Jesus
[1:22:26] before the people they wanted to
[1:22:29] belittle him isn't that the way it is
[1:22:31] you see a brother that in a fault or a
[1:22:32] brother makes a mistake said they always
[1:22:35] they always try to tear him down and
[1:22:36] belittle him but said see but that's
[1:22:38] just the way that the devil has of
[1:22:41] working the Pharisees and the teachers
[1:22:43] they constantly try to belittle him they
[1:22:44] threw off on how they could give him
[1:22:46] what or could give to him all that that
[1:22:49] they done it they watched him constantly
[1:22:50] to find out if they could find a fault
[1:22:52] they never spoke of his good things they
[1:22:54] always finding something they could
[1:22:55] belittle him about and say see look you
[1:22:57] there if he was a man of God he wouldn't
[1:22:58] do it that way if he was a man of God he
[1:23:00] wouldn't do this he said they were
[1:23:02] always trying to cast a shadow upon him
[1:23:04] to get the people to disbelieve him that
[1:23:07] is the work of the
[1:23:10] devil always trying to find a fault in
[1:23:12] another you say well if there's a real
[1:23:14] Christian they wouldn't be doing that if
[1:23:16] if she was a real Christian she wouldn't
[1:23:17] be saying that if she's real I wouldn't
[1:23:19] have nothing to do with her if she was
[1:23:20] real why she ain't she's a hypocrite
[1:23:22] anyway they're always trying to find
[1:23:23] fault in one another he said that's the
[1:23:25] work of the
[1:23:27] devil listen friends that's the work of
[1:23:30] the devil that's not God that's the work
[1:23:33] of the devil you say well you know
[1:23:35] that's why they did with Jesus but that
[1:23:36] wasn't the end of it he said and that
[1:23:38] old scheme has never
[1:23:39] ceased many times you'll find a brother
[1:23:42] that go in and preach the gospel or do
[1:23:44] something or somebody wants to do a work
[1:23:46] that's made a mistake comes into the
[1:23:47] neighborhood and people look back and
[1:23:49] they'll go all in their path say well I
[1:23:51] heard this about them and I heard that
[1:23:52] about them I Heard they' done this so
[1:23:53] what are they doing here somebody's
[1:23:55] trying to help try to be a help even a
[1:23:56] minister trying to lead somebody the
[1:23:58] right way but the devil is going to
[1:23:59] point out to every unbeliever every
[1:24:01] so-called chrisan everything that they
[1:24:03] ever done so that they won't have
[1:24:05] confidence in them think about what he's
[1:24:07] doing say so said but what we ought to
[1:24:09] do Brethren is somebody would do
[1:24:10] something wrong then you because we're
[1:24:13] subject to do it every one of us we're
[1:24:15] subject to fall we're subject to make
[1:24:17] mistakes we're subject to to be an error
[1:24:20] and because we're all subject to be an
[1:24:21] error he said every one of us I am too
[1:24:23] but as we go along let's remember this
[1:24:25] we are brothers somebody say we are
[1:24:27] brothers can we add this in we are
[1:24:29] sisters we are Brothers and Sisters in
[1:24:32] Christ so what we ought to do if we if
[1:24:35] we have a fight well that's fine we'll
[1:24:36] just fight it out in the backyard but we
[1:24:38] ain't going to bring it out in the front
[1:24:40] we're not going to try to take them
[1:24:41] public and try to go to somebody else
[1:24:42] and tell them every mistake they did and
[1:24:44] how I think they are to handle it and
[1:24:45] how their daddy should have got them how
[1:24:47] well everybody has a a fix for
[1:24:49] everything he said but what we ought to
[1:24:50] do is hide their wrong and expose their
[1:24:53] right
[1:24:55] isin't that opposite of the the the
[1:24:56] spirit of the devil it ain't people I'm
[1:24:58] just showing you two Spirits so Jesus
[1:25:01] they tried to find every little Shadow
[1:25:03] they could find to belittle him in the
[1:25:05] sight of people and that's what the
[1:25:06] devil wants he wants to hurt your
[1:25:09] influence before
[1:25:10] people isn't that isn't that right he
[1:25:12] wants to hurt your influence before
[1:25:14] people he says so let's watch what we do
[1:25:16] walk let's walk like real men of god
[1:25:18] let's talk like men of god let's act
[1:25:19] like men of god let's live like men of
[1:25:22] God because the devil your adversary is
[1:25:24] is going about like a roaring lion
[1:25:25] trying to devour everyone that he can my
[1:25:29] isn't it something brother M they tried
[1:25:30] to belittle him you say why did they why
[1:25:32] did they want to belittle him because he
[1:25:34] had a Ministry of God why would Satan
[1:25:36] want to belittle you why why does he
[1:25:38] want to tear down the Believers because
[1:25:39] you have a Ministry of God here you are
[1:25:41] a testimony of Jesus Christ so they
[1:25:43] would take every flaw that they could
[1:25:45] find to get him out of the way they
[1:25:46] wanted him to quit they wanted him they
[1:25:48] wanted the people to denounce him they
[1:25:49] wanted him to back up they wanted him
[1:25:51] they wanted they wanted him to destroy
[1:25:52] in the towel and quit so they put all
[1:25:54] this pressure on him that he would give
[1:25:55] up a't that what the devil does so see
[1:25:57] that's what he's still doing today to
[1:25:59] put all this pressure on you so that
[1:26:00] You' just give up if you can hear what
[1:26:02] somebody said oh my God God help me but
[1:26:06] but don't come and tell me what somebody
[1:26:07] says I used to have some real good
[1:26:08] friends and they're they're friends and
[1:26:10] loved ones and and people that you love
[1:26:12] but I always love those loved ones that
[1:26:13] come and tell you what somebody else
[1:26:15] said about you I tell them to shut up I
[1:26:17] don't care I I have real good loved ones
[1:26:20] that says well you know what this person
[1:26:21] said about you I said I don't want to
[1:26:23] hear it no more you right WR it down on
[1:26:24] piece of paper put it in that box over
[1:26:26] there I'll never read it when I get time
[1:26:27] maybe I'll get to it you know why
[1:26:29] because I don't want to hear it I don't
[1:26:30] want to read about it I don't want to
[1:26:32] know what they said I don't want to know
[1:26:34] what they think it ain't nothing but an
[1:26:35] enemy using you to cause somebody's
[1:26:38] Spirit to be tore down you say oh
[1:26:39] brother Matt don't say that about me I'm
[1:26:41] not saying it about you I'm telling you
[1:26:43] it's an enemy it's an enemy it's a demon
[1:26:45] spirit that is using you causing you to
[1:26:47] make somebody feel little you say you
[1:26:50] mean the devil would do that he'll cause
[1:26:52] them to say it and he'll cause you to
[1:26:53] repeat it it same devil he'll cause them
[1:26:56] to say it and you to repeat it just so
[1:26:58] they'll feel little why so they don't
[1:27:00] feel like a daughter of God so they
[1:27:01] don't feel like a Son of God so they
[1:27:03] can't go around their brother now they
[1:27:04] can't shake their hand now they can't
[1:27:05] look him in the eye now they can't sit
[1:27:07] and have Fellowship y'all have already
[1:27:08] kicked me out so I may as well go on but
[1:27:09] now you can't even fellowship with him
[1:27:11] anymore and when did that ever become
[1:27:13] the nature of Jesus Christ it ain't the
[1:27:15] nature of Christ it's the nature of the
[1:27:17] devil if I'm the last man standing in
[1:27:19] this church I'll preach it to those
[1:27:20] walls it ain't the nature of Christ it's
[1:27:22] the nature of the devil and he's still
[1:27:24] doing it today to cause division amongst
[1:27:27] the children of God the Sons and
[1:27:29] Daughters of God but the spirit of
[1:27:30] Christ it overlooks their wrongs it
[1:27:33] overlooks their mistakes it overlooks
[1:27:35] their binding that the devil has put on
[1:27:37] their Spirit it overlooks those things
[1:27:40] and it hides their wrong and it lifts
[1:27:42] their right it's the difference of the
[1:27:45] spirit of Christ he said they'll find
[1:27:47] every little flaw they can because he
[1:27:49] wanted him to quit that's what the devil
[1:27:50] he wants you to see every little flaw in
[1:27:52] one another he wants you to quit he
[1:27:53] wants you give up he wants you to have
[1:27:55] no confidence in each other have no
[1:27:57] confidence in anybody else well I just
[1:27:59] won't talk to nobody then I'll just sit
[1:28:00] by myself cuz I can't trust nobody
[1:28:02] anyhow look what the devil's doing to
[1:28:05] you destroying your spirit you say what
[1:28:07] is he doing he's trying to bind the Free
[1:28:09] People of
[1:28:10] God trying to bind us that we can't
[1:28:14] even can't Lord help us this morning
[1:28:17] that we can't love one another like we
[1:28:19] should see what was he doing what they
[1:28:21] do in Jesus's day they were trying to
[1:28:23] keep people from getting to Christ
[1:28:26] trying to keep them the same you realize
[1:28:28] that's the same devil because he knows
[1:28:30] if he could ever keep you from getting
[1:28:31] to Christ that he can rule over you if
[1:28:34] he can ever keep you from getting to
[1:28:36] Christ men men have taken this or the
[1:28:38] devil used many men to take advantage of
[1:28:41] people in this very way they set guards
[1:28:43] up that you can't get past you can't get
[1:28:46] to Jesus because I've got a guard in the
[1:28:48] way think about it if you don't go to my
[1:28:51] church you'll never make it what is it
[1:28:53] it's it's a guard to keep you from
[1:28:55] getting to him if you're not a part of
[1:28:57] this assembly well then you're lost
[1:28:59] anyhow it's a guard to keep you from
[1:29:01] getting to him if you don't belong to
[1:29:03] this organization well then you you
[1:29:04] can't be a believer it's a guard to keep
[1:29:07] you from getting to him if you don't if
[1:29:08] you don't look like this sister or look
[1:29:10] like this brother you'll never make it
[1:29:11] it's a guard to keep you from getting to
[1:29:13] him well my my grandpa he said we ought
[1:29:15] to wear shoes like this but if you don't
[1:29:16] wear them you're going to be lost it's a
[1:29:18] guard to keep you from they build up all
[1:29:20] kinds of guards to keep you from getting
[1:29:23] to Jesus
[1:29:24] but do you realize that that there is no
[1:29:27] guard blocking you the Bible only tells
[1:29:30] us of one place that that was ever
[1:29:31] guarded and it was in it was in the Book
[1:29:33] of Genesis whenever the the fall in the
[1:29:35] garden took place and Jesus came or God
[1:29:37] came down in the garden you remember
[1:29:38] what he told him he said he when he cast
[1:29:40] them out of the garden because of the
[1:29:42] Fall he put up a chair of thems on the
[1:29:44] east side of the garden garden the gate
[1:29:45] and they had flaming swords that guarded
[1:29:47] every way to keep the way to the tree of
[1:29:49] life and at that time men had no access
[1:29:52] to that tree of life in other words
[1:29:53] eternal life they had no they had no
[1:29:55] access to it because of the fall of Man
[1:29:57] there was no access but when Christ came
[1:29:59] notice what he said brother Bobby he
[1:30:01] said I am the bread of life and any man
[1:30:03] would eat of this bread he would never
[1:30:05] die here in other words he took the
[1:30:07] guard away but man said you know what
[1:30:09] happened he said what a thrilling
[1:30:10] thought it is that the Tree of Life In
[1:30:11] the Garden of Eden it couldn't be
[1:30:13] approached because of the fall of Adam
[1:30:15] but it's now given to the Overcomer you
[1:30:18] say where's that at it's in the Bible
[1:30:20] revelations 2:7 it says to him that
[1:30:22] overcometh I will live to eat of the
[1:30:24] tree of life which is in the midst of
[1:30:26] the paradise of my God and Bam said that
[1:30:30] flaming sword that kept you away from
[1:30:32] him has been sheathed that makes me want
[1:30:35] to shout all over this it's Sunday
[1:30:36] morning you can shout it makes you want
[1:30:38] to shout all over this building that
[1:30:40] flaming sword that kept you away from
[1:30:42] Jesus Christ or from the Tree of Life it
[1:30:45] has been sheath this morning it's not
[1:30:47] it's not moving every way the guard has
[1:30:49] been taken away therefore there ain't no
[1:30:51] man that has a right to keep you away
[1:30:53] from from Christ there's no man has a
[1:30:55] right to bind you or keep you from
[1:30:57] eternal life there ain't no man has a
[1:30:59] right to keep you from eating of this
[1:31:01] bread this Word of Life that'll give
[1:31:03] eternal life let me tell you what
[1:31:05] friends we got a right to possess it we
[1:31:07] got a right to eat it I know what we're
[1:31:08] going to do every Sunday every Wednesday
[1:31:11] every time we come in the house of God
[1:31:13] give me the word of God let me feed on
[1:31:15] it and I'm going to eat it until I get
[1:31:17] into a body change I think that's what
[1:31:19] we ought to do this morning we ought to
[1:31:21] eat oursel right into a body change
[1:31:23] eating enough word that it begins to
[1:31:25] change our body my go I feel good this
[1:31:28] morning that it'll change our Natural
[1:31:29] Body it'll take this whole body of
[1:31:31] corruption and cause it to put on
[1:31:34] incorruption said here he stands this
[1:31:36] Jesus Christ we stand before him there
[1:31:39] ain't nothing guarding him hello
[1:31:40] somebody there ain't nothing guarding
[1:31:42] him he's a he's accessible and here he
[1:31:44] stands and he stood as he stands he said
[1:31:47] notice but what does he stand for he
[1:31:48] stands for the love of God where
[1:31:50] everyone has a chance
[1:31:54] man ain't that good he stands for the
[1:31:56] love of God where everyone has a chance
[1:32:00] the love of God that's what Jesus stood
[1:32:02] for he didn't stand for laws or Creeds
[1:32:04] or affiliations or denominations but he
[1:32:06] stood for the love of God men today is
[1:32:09] constrained by the Holy Spirit to come
[1:32:10] and love him and serve him and he's
[1:32:12] seeking for such to do that God is
[1:32:14] looking for somebody who will stand out
[1:32:17] on the front line with
[1:32:19] love a't that something you want a big
[1:32:22] front liner that can Will build a sword
[1:32:25] he said but he's looking for somebody
[1:32:26] that can stand on the front line with
[1:32:28] love the nature of Jesus
[1:32:31] Christ my as a music player
[1:32:35] come see he's looking for somebody
[1:32:37] that'll stand friends if we ever get a
[1:32:40] taste of this life it changes who you
[1:32:43] are brother Weser the Holy Ghost it
[1:32:44] brings life it don't bring death it's
[1:32:47] not bringing judgment to the believer
[1:32:48] it's not bringing bondage it's not it's
[1:32:51] not trying to I was preaching it
[1:32:52] Wednesday night you know people say well
[1:32:53] when I get baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:32:55] well maybe the Lord will take me out of
[1:32:56] here he said that ain't what we're
[1:32:57] trying to do we're not getting ready to
[1:32:59] die we're getting ready to live I don't
[1:33:01] know about the rest of the world but I
[1:33:02] know about us we're not we're getting
[1:33:04] ready to live we're we're we're he he
[1:33:06] didn't call us said see the the Holy
[1:33:08] Ghost come you ain't living until you
[1:33:09] have the Holy Ghost says so I'm getting
[1:33:11] ready to live that's the thing of it I'm
[1:33:13] getting ready to live in Christ I want
[1:33:14] to live a life that's Victorious over
[1:33:16] sin I want to live a life that's
[1:33:18] Victorious over death how many say Amen
[1:33:20] I'll give a I want to have a life that's
[1:33:22] Victorious over hell I I want to have
[1:33:25] the victory that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:33:27] is sent for to be
[1:33:29] victorious think about it he's a God
[1:33:32] that brings the dead to
[1:33:34] life that's what he does he brings the
[1:33:37] dead to life you remember what the Bible
[1:33:40] says Paul said it like this he said none
[1:33:42] of us lives to himself no man dies to
[1:33:44] himself he said whether we live or
[1:33:46] whether we die it's unto the Lord for
[1:33:50] Christ is both died and Rose and revived
[1:33:53] that he might be the Lord both of the
[1:33:56] dead and the living for on the cross he
[1:33:58] bought the whole world of people they
[1:34:01] are his a't that contrary to a lot of
[1:34:04] people's teaching said they are all his
[1:34:08] he bought the dead and the living that's
[1:34:09] why Jesus was standing in the Book of
[1:34:11] Revelations with the with those
[1:34:13] lampstands in his hand remember the
[1:34:15] church had fallen away in leoda but when
[1:34:18] you seen him standing there he still had
[1:34:20] it in his hand it was still his e even
[1:34:24] though when read and talk about how it
[1:34:25] fell away and how how how that it had
[1:34:27] gone so far but here he was standing
[1:34:29] there said but it's still his it's his
[1:34:33] those that are dead those that are alive
[1:34:35] it's still his he bought it he paid for
[1:34:38] it you think about it in the name of
[1:34:39] Christianity but the mark there's life
[1:34:41] and there's death there's so many
[1:34:43] there's a True Vine there's a false Vine
[1:34:45] there's a there's a wheat and A Tear
[1:34:47] there's a just and unjust but friends I
[1:34:49] got news for you we don't go to a dried
[1:34:51] up church we don't go to we don't go to
[1:34:54] a dead thing we're we're not looking for
[1:34:56] dead we're looking for life we don't
[1:34:58] come to church looking for dead there's
[1:35:00] so many that they dimm down the lights
[1:35:02] and they but they take it all the way
[1:35:04] down why they're trying to create this
[1:35:06] old this old atmosphere we ain't got to
[1:35:08] create that we're not trying to create
[1:35:10] the atmosphere of a death and a burial
[1:35:12] it's the atmosphere of Resurrection that
[1:35:14] we're interested in the atmosphere of
[1:35:17] life that's why we don't go to a dried
[1:35:19] up formal church that's why your pastor
[1:35:21] won't ever quit that's why that's that's
[1:35:23] why he pushes every every service to
[1:35:25] bring life to the people to to pick
[1:35:27] people up when they're down saying don't
[1:35:29] be down be up God didn't cause you to be
[1:35:31] cast down he caused you to be lifted up
[1:35:34] the word of God it wasn't meant for you
[1:35:35] to walk around all beat down and dead it
[1:35:38] was meant for you to be alive to be a
[1:35:40] living testimony of the word of God
[1:35:43] we're not looking for dead we're looking
[1:35:45] for life let me tell you a secret I'm
[1:35:49] I'm I'm going to make this statement you
[1:35:51] can't find life everywhere
[1:35:54] you can't find life
[1:35:56] everywhere sometimes see sometimes
[1:35:59] people go they go to dead places looking
[1:36:02] for life and then they're shocked cuz
[1:36:04] they couldn't find any life there can
[1:36:06] you imagine going into a dead church
[1:36:07] trying to find life there's no life in
[1:36:09] it oh some old dried up denomination
[1:36:11] somewhere that's ran by a bunch of men
[1:36:13] but there's no life in there ain't no
[1:36:15] moving of the Holy Ghost what is it it's
[1:36:17] because it's a place of the dead and
[1:36:18] we're looking for something that's alive
[1:36:20] amongst the dead I can prove that when
[1:36:22] the when they went to the supper that
[1:36:24] day and Jesus was laying in the Tomb
[1:36:26] remember he had already resurrected and
[1:36:28] when they came out came to the supper
[1:36:30] they they prepared they found that the
[1:36:31] stone was rolled away and when they
[1:36:33] entered in they found not the body of
[1:36:35] the Lord Jesus and the Bible said it
[1:36:37] came to pass that they were
[1:36:39] perplexed in other words they were
[1:36:41] completely baffled you see I could see
[1:36:43] the confusion Destiny because they were
[1:36:46] looking for a dead thing amongst the
[1:36:50] dead and found it
[1:36:52] missing how would a dead thing be
[1:36:54] missing where could it go so you could
[1:36:56] see the the confusion when you're
[1:36:58] looking for dead among dead and you
[1:37:01] don't find it the dead is missing it
[1:37:03] causes confusion but there's no need to
[1:37:06] be confused when you're searching for
[1:37:08] living things among dead and you don't
[1:37:10] find it see there's no need to be
[1:37:13] confused because the living thing isn't
[1:37:14] dwelling among the dead to see you come
[1:37:17] into a you can go into a dead place and
[1:37:18] say well I can't find life and I can't
[1:37:20] find Christ what's going on I'm so
[1:37:22] confused I'm so perplexed to this but it
[1:37:25] shouldn't cause us to be perplexed cuz
[1:37:27] you're not going to find living among
[1:37:28] the Dead the Bible says here when they
[1:37:31] were confused he said as they were
[1:37:33] afraid they said the angel said to them
[1:37:35] why seek you the living among the dead
[1:37:38] see they were looking for a dead thing
[1:37:40] they were looking for history looking
[1:37:42] for something that was going on
[1:37:43] something that was that was passed they
[1:37:45] had to be informed that what you're
[1:37:46] searching for it's not dead but it's
[1:37:49] alive had somebody come inform them now
[1:37:51] you're dwelling in the wrong place
[1:37:53] because you've been coming here all this
[1:37:55] time you come to you come to to to to
[1:37:57] find him but you'll never find him here
[1:37:58] again this is a place where dead things
[1:38:00] lay but life has left it so stay out of
[1:38:04] the dead and go find the life get out of
[1:38:06] the graveyard and go among the land of
[1:38:08] the living and find he that is living
[1:38:10] said what you're searching for is alive
[1:38:13] see when you search for life in a dead
[1:38:14] place and you don't find it don't be
[1:38:16] alarmed just get away from the dead
[1:38:17] place to go where there's life and
[1:38:19] search for Life there and you'll be sure
[1:38:20] to find it let me tell you friends you
[1:38:22] know why cuz say that because we're not
[1:38:24] among the dead this morning we're among
[1:38:26] the living and among the living you know
[1:38:28] what I expect to see life God's church
[1:38:31] is a Living Church we're alive we're not
[1:38:33] a bunch of dead people we're not a bunch
[1:38:34] of a dead religion but you're God's free
[1:38:37] men and women and you're living you've
[1:38:39] been called out by God you've been
[1:38:41] raised from the death of this sin the
[1:38:43] death of this world and you've been
[1:38:45] resurrected to life and as you stand to
[1:38:47] your feet this morning let me tell you
[1:38:49] you was raised for a purpose you was
[1:38:52] raised to do the work of God God you
[1:38:54] wasn't raised to be bound you wasn't
[1:38:56] raised to be tormented you was raised to
[1:38:58] be free so I wonder if there's somebody
[1:39:00] here this morning that could lift your
[1:39:01] hand and say brother may I want to be
[1:39:03] free I don't want nothing to bind me I
[1:39:05] see how the spirit of the enemy would
[1:39:07] come in and try to bind my spirit
[1:39:09] against my brother or my sister but I
[1:39:11] rebuke you devil in the name of Jesus
[1:39:13] Christ you have no authority over these
[1:39:16] Believers we got a right to be free you
[1:39:19] got a right to put your arm around your
[1:39:20] brother and around your sister and say I
[1:39:22] love you and me it from your heart you
[1:39:25] got a right to it the devil's a liar
[1:39:28] God's word is
[1:39:29] true you got a right to it let's bow our
[1:39:31] heads gracious Heavenly
[1:39:33] Father Lord the power of God in this
[1:39:36] building Lord we realize that you come
[1:39:38] to set us free as a body of Believers
[1:39:41] Lord we stand as free men and women God
