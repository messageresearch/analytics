Book of Revelations we're going to read out of the 22nd chapter and in the 14th verse and before I get in trouble I'm I'm supposed to announce that we're having a a dinner tomorrow our picnic out here and uh for Memorial Day and I think some folks are going to start showing up around 11:00 and so we just look forward I don't know they ain't going to eat until probably maybe 12: or 1 and so just come out out in Fellowship so whatever time we happen to eat we'll just eat and we when we get tired of playing and hungry again we'll eat again so amen that's just we just uh just come looking for some good time and fellowship and how many's looking forward to that amen God bless you this morning we want to read 20 Revelations the 22nd chapter in the 14th verse and we'll give you just a moment to get there and and I just uh been I love the word and I kind of got picked on after Wednesday night and some of the some of the ladies and and they heard me preaching said he's the only preacher I know that can print can plant fried okra it's like you I was wondering why everybody was laughing when I got talking about me and my wife planting fried ochre and they said well you you don't plant it fried you just plant okra and then when you get it if I ever figure out how to plant fried okra I'll be the richest man in the South some fried green tomatoes just put them in the ground they come out ready to eat I mean my goodness but uh that's that must been what it was like in whenever the children of Israel went on the Wilderness Journey just fried ochre and and fried green tomatoes all the time it was already ready I I think that's way it that's the way I want it just bring it to me already cooked amen you love the Lord this morning amen we just want to read out of the Book of Revelations the 22nd chapter the 14th verse the Bible said blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city for without our dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolators and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie but I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches and I am the root and The Offspring of David and the bright and The Morning Star and this morning as you take your seats I'd like to speak on the Morning Star Revelation now I've been speaking on This Book of Revelation for or or or on Revelation the last few Services it's just been something that's really been on my heart and uh we've been as we've been speaking on Revelation last Sunday uh we were showing how that it takes a revelation to receive any promise of God and uh so if you wanted to receive healing or salvation or whatever it might be it would all come uh by Revelation I know there's a challenge uh uh against that statement because the Bible says that it takes Faith to receive them and the Bible even says it was by Grace you're saved through faith and I believe that I believe that we're saved by faith I believe that our healing uh comes by faith but then it goes a little bit deeper because it takes something in order to have faith and see so you ask this question what does it take to have faith Paul says that that God deals to every man a Measure of Faith so we asked this question last Sunday as we were closing is how does God deal it the Bible says faith cometh by the hearing of the word of God so when a man can hear the word and he comes and he hears the the word being preached and then you catch a revelation of the word that's preached and then that Revelation that you've caught of the word that's being preached is what brings you faith and so that's why brother brm would make this statement he said faith is a revelation see you couldn't even have faith without Revelation therefore you couldn't be healed without Revelation you couldn't be saved without Revelation you couldn't you couldn't believe without Revelation but Market takes faith in order to have it he said what is Faith he said faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be see faith is the revelation of the will of God so it's all by Revelation so if you want to receive something from God it'll take a revelation if you want to receive a a promise of God it'll take a revelation if you want God to do something for you and you say brother Matt I want to be a real believer and I I want to believe every promise and I want to I want to be able to have healing I want to see uh hands laid on the sick and the sick recovery all these great things and and the whole world is trying to build up a great faith in order to receive the promise of God but the reality is what we need is a revelation of what faith is and we need a revelation of God's word and he said see it's by Revelation that's why brother B would say that more than anything else we ought to pray for Revelation how many believes that say Amen we ought to pray for Revelation he says see because when you have a true Revelation then you can't go wrong you see that when you have a true Revelation nobody can lead you astray and I I got to think about that what a true Revelation does you know brother Wesley when a person has a revelation of Divine Healing that's whenever you can see some that come through a prayer line and they're healed and then you could see a thousand people that come through a prayer line and nothing happened to them and they never receive their healing and it will never shake your faith and the reason it doesn't shake your faith is because your faith is not based on the outcome of a healing line it's because your faith was based on the revelation of the mercy of God of healing see because you have a revelation of healing and you have a a revelation of Divine Healing and then people aren't healed but you don't lose faith and people walk away the same and you don't lose Faith they keep the same symptoms you don't lose Faith because you realize your faith isn't based on symptoms it isn't based on their feelings it isn't isn't based on the failures of others or the faith of others or nothing like that but it's based on the revelation of Jesus Christ and it's the same way with salvation you ever you ever take a person and they'll get a revelation of what salvation really is then brother Wesley you know what happens Hypocrites don't change you anymore you know the I think the greatest thing that caus people to stop going to church brother Mark most of the time when they get backslid is they it's because they'll see somebody that is already backslid well I would go down there and go to church but you know half them people's Hypocrites anyway and you know I would go church but last time I went to church I seen so and so down there at Walmart my the way they were dressed and the way they were acting why if they were real Christians ain't none of them be like that but I'll tell you I'm just going to stay home any anyway but you realize what it is is when a person gets a revelation of Salvation then a hypocrite can't turn you away when you get a revelation of Salvation then somebody backslid and they can't turn you away they don't shake you anymore because you have a real Revelation and see so we find this is to be the case that having a real Revelation is what makes you a solid believer how many believe that having having a real Revelation makes you a real believer it gives you a foundation brother Mark upon the on the word of God it's what makes you come to church when you don't feel like it it's what makes you get up on Sunday morning when when everything's going wrong and the and the in the in the in the in the house is falling apart and the and everything's are wreck and you and your wife's in the middle of argument and all but but you look past it all and you go to church anyway because you have a revelation of of why it is that you serve God and a revelation of of your salvation that was given to you by grace and it was unmar brother Savor you there wasn't nothing you could do to earn it and that love for Christ and all that he's done for you it caused you to get out of bed and go sit on a church pew on Sunday morning it caus you to lift your hand it caus you to say Amen it it caus you to clap and to sing and and when you're tired and you don't feel like going to church oh but it caus you to get into the service why because you have a revelation of Salvation you have a revelation of what he done for you and and because of it you want to give something back to God and you want to let him know Lord I love you and I thank you and I Lord I I'm so grateful of all that you've done for me Lord so I come to give this time to you I thought i' give all week to my job and I I give all week to my to my family and I give all week to all these other things but this morning I come to give my time to you and Lord this morning I come to Worship You Lord this morning I've caught a revelation of who you are and what you done for me and I I come to lay down before you Lord this morning to give everything back that I can give see having a real Revelation is what makes you a solid believer that's why Jesus would say upon this rock I'll build my church isn't it something that God would send a revelation of Jesus Christ and that Revelation was a real Revelation it Ain it ain't just revelation of of the name but it's a revelation of who he really was and friends let me tell you with a real revelation of Jesus Christ you will see his authority over the dimension that you're living in I thought about this this morning you know it's easier to see Jesus having an authority over an unseen Dimension than it is for him to have an authority over the dimension we're living in you ever thought about that because God is an unseen God so we look at God of God being unseen and and it's easy for us to say well God can have dominion over the devil and God can have dominion over the over hell and God can have dominion over these principalities and God can have dominion over this Supernatural realm or or this other dimension or these things that we can't see see it's easy to see God or it's easy to see Jesus have power over those things but what it's hard to do is to see him have power over the things that are tangible it's hard to see him have power I know that's backwards away but but it's the truth it's hard to see him have power over things that you go through it's hard to see him have power over o over things that we that we're dealing with in this life but you realize it's easy to see in a spiritual realm he has power over Heavens power over things you can't see but brother Mark when you catch a real revelation of Jesus Christ then you catch a revelation that he has an authority over things that you can see Paul said he's above every principality and power and might in every Dominion in every name that is named not only in this world but also the world that the world that is to come you may tell you what that means it means that Christ has dominion over your problem this morning Christ has dominion over your home he has dominion over the family trouble he has dominion over the church and the church problems he has dominion over your health problems God don't just want to be a god of Heaven he don't just want to be a god of another world he don't just want to be a god of some spiritual realm but I thank God that we have a revelation of who Jesus Christ was and that he was sent to this earth to have dominion over natural things he was sent to have dominion over these flesh bodies and dominion over the problems and the trials that we face each and every day it's a real revelation of Jesus Christ you know I think sometimes is what it is is sometimes we get caught up watching all the destruction and and all the things that's going on in this world and we forget about the real outcome we we we get caught up in everything that's going on around us and we forget that there's something that God has promised us and and you know brother wesy we get troubled in our spirit and we get unsettled because things that's going on in the churches and and things that are other people are doing and because people are maybe people are are getting in their mind or they'll they'll leave away from the the the message or they'll go they'll go away from church or they they don't want to be around they don't want to Fellowship no more and we get all we get all wrapped up in it see our trouble our spirit gets troubled and and we get unsettled but you realize that we're that's not unordinary that's even the Prophet Daniel got into that place you you realize you remember when when Daniel had the dream he seen a dream of four beasts remember he said there they were four beasts that were beasts of power I'm not I'm not going to go through it this morning but but he said he said but then those beasts they were stripped of their power they were they were destroyed they were stripped of power they had their Dominion taken away and then and then he said this is what he saw in a dream he said but then I saw one that was like of the son of man that come from the clouds of Heaven as the an of days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and the kingdom that all people and Nations and languages should serve him and his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion you know what that means that it still lasts today his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion anybody hear me this morning his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion let the devil know it this morning his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion that means on Sunday morning right here in the middle of May and 2024 that the Dominion of this king is still Everlasting he said it's an everlasting dominion and it'll and there was given him dominion over every Kingdom and everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom shall not be destroyed but even after seeing this are you hearing me even after seeing this he saw the four beasts that would fall he saw this great one that would rise up that was likened under the son of man he saw Dominion that was given to him the Bible said but even then Daniel said but I'm grieved in my Spirit I'm grieved in my spirit because I don't understand what it meant I'm grieved in my spirit because I don't know what these beasts really were and I'm grieved in my spirit because I because I was troubled about it because I didn't really have a revelation of it and so what did he do brother marah is Daniel goes down you say why why why would he be grieved because he had a great dream but he had no Revelation So Daniel said so in the dream he goes down to one of them was standing in the crowd and Daniel asked them he said what is the truth of all all this he said so the man made known unto me he said the four beasts were Four Kings which shall arise out of the earth he said but the other when the when you saw the Dominion come he said that was the Saints of the most high God that shall come and take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever and ever and ever oh I thank God that there came somebody that would give a revelation that it wasn't just God it wasn't just to God out of Heaven that Jesus didn't come just to have dominion for himself but he said he made it known to me that the saints of God would have dominion upon the Earth he made it known unto me that the saints of God it it wasn't just yesterday but forever and ever and forever and ever they'll have dominion upon the Earth said the saint shall take his kingdom GL that makes me want to preach this morning that's why Paul said he said Christ is the head and church and the church is the body and he has put all things under his feet you know what that means brother Mah if the bo if the church is the body body of Jesus Christ and all things are under his feet then the things are under the feet of the body the Feet's the lowest thing on the body so that means it doesn't matter what is ever brought up or what what the devil Rises up it's under the feet of the Bride of Jesus Christ because you're the body of Jesus see it takes a true revelation of the Dominion of Jesus Christ that's what we're looking for this morning let me tell you they tell him like he's a story they tell him like it's some story book but friends let me let me tell you this morning that Jesus Christ is not some fictional character he he's not some guy in a story he's the king of glory he ain't just something that was made up to make you feel good in the middle of the night but it was Jesus Christ the son of God that came down to the Earth that shed his blood that would give dominion and power to the church over every devil that they had faced in the age that we're living in you say brother Matt well how do you get that Revelation well let me tell you what Paul said he said no man can say that Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Ghost man there's a little freebie for the trinitarians out there you know one place Jesus told Peter he said you you didn't get that Revelation from man but you got it from God Paul says we get it from pet or Jesus said you get it from the Father Paul said you get it from the Holy Ghost well either either one of them is wrong or there's both right but what was it it's a holy ghost Revelation that's what we need this morning that's what the church is need it's a holy ghost Revelation but Mark it's not a head knowledge it's a it's a holy ghost it's a reveal he thing of God that come from the come from the spirit of God a real Revelation that can that's not in the head of a man but it's in the soul of a man it's something that sinks down into your heart that that causes you to be able to stand it don't matter what comes at you or what waves or what or how rocky that it gets but because there's a real Revelation it'll always stand friends I thank God for it this morning how many how many believes that how many how many thank God for it you say I thank God for the supernatural spirit of God you realize it was a prom Pro of God in the Bible brother Wesley said the Bible the bible promises that that that that the the Holy Ghost would come to them it would be a down payment for your inheritance it's just a little portion of what God's going to give you but it'll have the same power just to show you that that God can redeem these bodies he can take a man that's in sin a man that that's dead in his trespasses and he can bring him back to life the Bible said what would it do it would Quicken him to life it would make him live again listen Paul said because they were dead but it brought them to life no wonder Satan hates revelation because it brings the church to Life by the power of the Holy Ghost no wonder he hates Revelation it'll take somebody that was dead that can barely come to church and it'll put a Zeal in their heart to want to serve God it'll put the praise of God on their lips for theor and it'll give them a foundation to stand upon that the devil can't shake he can't run them out of church he can't run he can't shake you out of church he couldn't he couldn't lead you out of church he couldn't entice you out of church he couldn't Force you out of church he couldn't get you out brother Mark because you have a revelation my may be simple this morning but it's the truth we have a revelation that came from God that's why Satan hates it why because it it's it brings the church to life see when you recognize that you are the body of Jesus Christ catch this simple thought powerful Revelation when you recognize that you are the body of Jesus Christ and your hands are his hands and your feet are his feet listen somebody and you speak the words you speak are as Jesus would speak them then that Revelation can take one man and give him enough power to conquer every devil in hell brother Charles you ever catch a hold of that that I am the body of Jesus Christ then no devil will ever be able to stand before you I'm the body of Jesus Christ he'll never have authority over you I'm the body of Jesus Christ he'll never be able to put you down again because the same one that walked upon the Earth the one that walked the shores of Galilee is walking in human flesh this morning it'll conquer every devil in hell that's why brother B said he he said he knows that if the people ever get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army he's talking about you if the church ever gets a true revelation of who she is what she stands for think about it she'll be an invincible Army how many knows what Invincible means it means you're too powerful to be defeated man is't that good a revelation that can make you so powerful brother Mark that the devil don't know what to do with you too powerful to be defeated so when the Devil Comes you know what you do you turn around I heard brother Mark trying to do it this morning but you turn around you say Satan I'm too powerful to be defeated how many say that this morning I'm too powerful to be defeated go ahead and say it again I'm too powerful to be defeated it's okay to repeat I'm too powerful ful to be defeated somebody say it like you're meaning I'm too powerful to be defeated want somebody put your shoulders back and stand up and look the devil in the eye and say I'm too powerful to be defeated let me tell you friend this is Grace Tabernacle this ain't some Baptist Church down the road where people don't have a revelation of who God is I think we got a r to stand and look the devil in the eye say I'm too powerful we to be defeated we come to have church we come to obey the word of God we come to follow the message of the hour we come to follow the move with the spirit you say but Matt why are you so bold let me tell you cuz Revelation empowers you Revelation it strengthens you it causes you to be able to stand upon your feet and stand against the devil and look man you people are afraid to say it I'm too powerful to be defeated cuz the devil's convinced you that you ain't got no power he's convinced you that you'll never overcome he's convinced you that you're worthless and you're cast out and you're run down and you're an outcast but let me tell you look him in the eye and say I'm too powerful to be defeated she'll be an invincible Army when you catch a revelation of who you are you can stand up there'll bully the devil I'm too powerful to be defeated well let me tell you what happens when Revelation strikes a man it was the Revelation that enabled David to stand before that Giant Goliath you say brother Matt it was a revelation sure it was remember when David went down to Goliath you realize that David was living under a covenant that God had given to Abraham and so because of this Covenant that God had made when David stood before them you remember the Covenant remember when he told Abraham he said have he said keep this Covenant between you and me and your seed he said every Manchild among you shall be circumcised and in that Covenant he said I will bless them that bless you I will curse them that curse you and then when they entered into a battle brother Mark you can find it in the book of Deuteronomy when they entered into a battle here when they went down into this battle with Goliath they had forgotten This Promise from God but when they went enter into a battle God had given them an order to say these words he said when you go into a battle he said have a priest come up before the people and speak to the people before you go into battle and the priest shall say here oh Israel approach this day under battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not do not tremble neither be you terrified because of them for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you he said send a priest before the people before they go into battle and speak those words friends I thank God that there's still some god- calleded men that when you're heading into a battle that they don't care to stand before the people of God and they say you approach this day under battle against your enemy and but let your heart not faint fear not do not tremble neither be you terrified because of them for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies and to save you see it was a it was a part of the Covenant that David had let me tell you what he did Brother Mah he took the revelation of the word of God and that Covenant that was made by God through circumcision and he stood by Revelation and he asked this question who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the Living God brother brother Wesley he had enough about him to know what the word of God required that he knew he had met God's requirements and he knew that Goliath hadn't he said who's this uncircumcised woman that would come and stand before me when I'm living under the Covenant that God gave to Abraham I've met God's requirement I've done all that God asked me to do and he gave me a promise let me tell you friends it's what gave him the right to stand before Goliath it wasn't the valley of Elum that he was stand or ELO that he was standing on it wasn't the power of King Saul that he was standing on it it wasn't the might or the power or the ability or the strength of the Israel army but he was standing on the revelation of the Covenant of almighty God because he had a revelation of the Covenant he could stand before Goliath what boldness that it gave him who art thou uncircumcised Philistine what give a little boy the the brother Mark the the courage to be able to stand before a great Giant and say who art thou you uncircumcised Philistine he knew he hadn't met God's requirement but David knew that he had see it was a revelation of God's covenant let me tell you friends because he had that kind of Revelation when he got down can I preach a minute I won't hold you long but when he got down on that Battlefield brother Mark you know what he done he got down there and guess what happened first thing out of Goliath's mouth the Bible says Goliath be to curse David by his own Gods let me tell you you know what happened when Goliath cursed David when he cursed everybody else you know what they did brother Joe they cared down in their tents when he cursed everybody else they went in hiding when he cursed everybody else they went over behind King Saul and said oh King can you help us some way but when he cursed David David just started dancing oh thank God oh why you dancing David oh don't you hear it I got a covenant with God he said I'll bless them that bless you I'll curse them that curse you he said curse on devil do your worst he danced oh I could just see him dancing on the battlefield oh David why you dancing oh God did you hear what the giant said about me he said I'll never make it he said I'll never be filled with the Holy Ghost he said I'll never be right with God he said I'll never make a Rapture he said I'll never make it home he said I'll never be a believer oh I thank God for the curse of the devil cuz you said Every curse he puts on me you'll bring back on him that's why we all look at the Devil say it louder devil you'll never have a church say it louder ain't nobody ever going to go say it louder you're too old to start preaching say it louder you never get the Holy Ghost say it louder your pastor's going to haunt you say it louder say it louder why you dancing I have a covenant with God he said I'll bless them that bless you and the curse you put on me will come back on you why he had a covenant had a revelation of the Covenant that God gave him see Revelation is what allows you to stand let me ask you what it was how did Moses how did Moses stand in the in the Palace of pharaoh see it was a revelation that he received at the burning bush but Mark when he went down this Revelation was so powerful that it caused a man an old man he caused an old wasn't too old but he caused this young man Moses to stand when he stood there at this Burning Bush but Mark it caused him to have the confidence to go stand before an entire nation of people and to speak the word of God knowing they had in they had swords any one of them could have took his life but but he had a revelation from God brother Bobby what was it that gave it to him I don't have to go through the whole story you know it but the Bible says but watch the Revelation came his Revelation came it was a real Holy Ghost experience see what what was all included there was a pillar of fire there was signs and wonders here he had done one sign then he done another sign remember God he told him he said if they don't believe the the the voice of the first sign they'll believe the voice of the second so here God not only does he show him a sign he says that sh that sign is going to speak on your behalf when you don't have the words to say let the sign speak when you can't defend yourself let the sign speak when you when you you can't work your way out of it let the sign speak when they wrap you up in scripture and because of your own failure of understanding just let the sign do the speaking say see they'll believe the voice of the sign you you realize what happened brother Mark is that whenever he got it he he got a revelation of his calling and brother bam said then then he went down because he had a revelation of what God had called him to do he said but that don't just go for Moses that goes for any man or woman hello somebody that goes for any man he said any man or woman that's ever been in the backside of the desert like Moses was and the revelation of God made manifest to him through the Holy Ghost there ain't nothing that can shake him when you get alone with God and let the revelation of God strike your heart there ain't nothing can shake him I can say this there ain't nothing can shake her either man or woman there ain't nothing can shake your what causes these young girls to be able to stand up in this world and be able to be Believers and go on when everybody else says well that ain't what pretty is let me show you what pretty is but they don't they don't fall for it they still hold a a standard of Holiness and and stand in in in the in the in the picture of the beauty of what what God called beautiful and and what any godall man would call beautiful and and they stand on it why brother Mark because they met God face to face they c a revelation of the word of God there ain't nothing can shake them it's no wonder that Paul wanted the church to have Revelation you see that it's no wonder he said matter of fact in the end of the Bible the is a whole book just on Revelation it was the revelation of Jesus Christ and it brother man say who was it the Bible said it he said he was the bright and The Morning Star but said and that morning star is with us tonight is there in this morning star it shines brighter than any other star in the morning isn't that something here he would say he's with us tonight I thought I thought about how he's with us tonight and you realize there was many Ministries there's many stars that that were shining there there's many stars that are shining today that will attract people to their life but you realize he said but the Morning Star will outshine them all there's many great lights in this world but the Morning Star will outshine them all and he came for a purpose you said well what was the purpose of the Morning Star he said he come to reflect the presence of the coming son you see what he was showing he was showing us is that the son that was coming was already here he said he was here in spirit he's come to reflect the presence of what would be a coming son so here standing in his presence he would reveal truth standing in his repr presence he would reveal Hearts what was it it was the very it was the very Morning Star it it was the it was Jesus Christ the lord of Glory that came and took the word of God and begin to reveal it to the hearts of people you you realize that there in the in this time there was there was crowds of people that were for 1900 years had looked at this book of Revelation as a book of mystery but you realize that this morning that we don't look at it that way anymore but we look at it as an open book this and that's the Revelation that Satan hates brother Mark he don't want you seeing that as an open book he don't want you knowing you're living in leot deia he don't want you seeing that that it's an age of lukewarmness he don't want you see that we're in the end time or or that we're living in the time of judgment but Satan's purpose is that every soul would meet his fate so brother Wesley what he does is he brings destruction and lies and he Bluffs and he he brings deceits and and and all these things upon on the people of God to keep you from catching a revelation the true revelation of Jesus Christ but what God does is God comes and he exposes the battle plan of Satan so before any of us was ever born here God had already purposed that Satan is going to do this he'll destroy he'll lie he'll deceive he said but what I'm going to do this is the age for it that you're going to thank God here here's where we are this is the time we we we didn't choose it brother Wesley but here we are he said but here I'm going to come and I'm going to expose the plan of the devil you said well how did he expose it he exposed it by fulfilling Malachi 4 and5 and sending the spirit of Prophecy to our generation how many believes that but manam said see he said through these Church ages there's a great mess up that comes along but at the end of the church age the seventh Angel's message is to pick up these lost Mysteries and give it to the church now we notice that you you realize that that the purpose of the seventh angel was to take the Mysteries that were lost and give it to the church that's why when John when he saw the Throne of God you realize when he saw this Throne that there was a sealed book in his hand and John said you you and and when John would write about the first seal being open he would talk about the white horse rider remember the first seal he said when it was opened up there was one that was riding on a white horse butam said there was a mystery that goes with that riter see the world today and in matter of fact he said this mystery would be revealed to the entire world one day brother Joe the whole world will see it one day it'll be shown to the world who this white horse rider really is he said but it'll only be revealed to them after the lamb leaves the father's throne and his anaccessory as kinsman redeemer is over well friends I got news for you I don't wait I don't want to wait until then to get a revelation of who the white horse rider is I don't want to wait till then to catch the revelation of this Spirit that's moving across the land today but I say oh God by your grace and mercy may we catch it right now see the world they'll catch it one day it'll be revealed to them but for us here comes this morning star in the middle of of this book brother marah and it begins to shed light upon the on the mysteries of God to be able to show to the Bride of Jesus Christ Paul said that your eyes would be enlightened that they would come open to the very Mysteries that God has placed in the Bible that Christ The Living Jesus Christ should dwell in humanity again now brother man said now now I want you to notice this he said this ain't for everybody hello that's just the case he said but he said you know and then he say he gives every Pastor the r I'm going to go ahead and take my Liberty this morning he gives every Pastor the r he says so you know what you you out there you churches and pastors he said you can speak whatever you want to you've got a right by your own conviction to speak what you want to and if a minister don't want this amongst his people well then he don't have to take it to them he said but this is meant to be among the people that I have been sent to speak to therefore I must reveal what is truth now a't that good brother Mah so the Revelation was sent to whom the prophet was sent the Revelation wasn't sent to everybody it was sent to the ones that the prophet was sent to and he wasn't sent to all the churches he hello he wasn't sent to the Nations he wasn't sent to all the organizations he wasn't sent to the millions that came to his meeting but he was sent to those that had heard his message as individuals that's what Malachi said he said behold I send unto you Elijah the prophet he didn't come to save the whole world he came to save individuals that would see the light from The Morning Star shining upon the word of God and it would reflect something that was true and it would strike something in their heart brother Mark said I send to you see we know because of what Jesus said that this was not the man Elijah he said I'll send unto you Elijah the prophet can I take just a minute here I know this is being recorded and we have a lot of people that watch these but you realize that that that this was not that that that whenever Malachi made this prophecy he was not talking about the man Elijah we know that's Elementary but he was talking about the spirit of Elijah matter of fact it was the spirit of God that was upon Elijah it was God that gave Elijah that he had to get that Spirit from somewhere before Elijah ever even existed but here the spirit was on Elijah that same Spirit of Elijah Came Upon Elisha remember that was the second coming then John the Baptist Jesus said he came in John the Baptist then melachi 4 said before the the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord before the Earth shall burn brother Mark or or or burn as fire and hay and stubble here this Spirit would come again and then again at the end of The Book of Revelation you find Moses and Elijah that are that are in in the in that great City remember the Bible said they had see them dead for for for I believe three days but they seen them laying there before they came back to Al and so we see this this is not the man Elijah but it's the spirit of the Prophet Elijah so many dismissed this they dismiss this word Prophet they they I thought brother Robert said it really well the other day we was eating dinner he said you know for a person that say I don't believe in a prophet he said according to my Bible they may as well just go around saying I don't believe in pastors I don't believe in evangelist I don't believe in teachers I don't he said he said because the the the the the office of the pastor came from the same place the office of the Prophet came from Ephesians the 4th chapter Paul said he called some pastors and apostles and evangelists and teachers and Prophets for the perfecting of the Saints for the preaching of the word of God you see so so here here God send it for this reason he said but notice whenever the prophet came brother Mark in the opening dark am I too late in the I'm just getting here in the opening of The Seven Seals brother Jared you find out in Revelation the fifth chapter now now you know what what the seals were open I know we we've done studies on this but but maybe some are are newer but but that you realize that this book that John saw in Revelations 5 was the book of redemption he knew what he knew what was the book because it bothered him that it wasn't open he knew something about it enough that it troubled him that it was a sealed book and so when he saw this he but but but he said I was I was troubled and and he wept but all of a sudden here come one of the elders that turned to him and said weep not John and he said here one has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals of the book and so whenever John would turn he sees this you realize that John sees this as a future prophecy in other words one day it would happen in other words it did not happen in front of John it was just a vision that John saw John didn't see the seals open off the book and have a revelation of what it was it was a vision John didn't even understand the things that were being unfolded he said but he wrote them because that's what he told him to write but he didn't have a full understanding of this but it was a vision say see so as as he but as he shows this this this uh these seals being open remember it was a sealed book and the Bible said then in Revelation six the the he the lamb came and he took a hold of the book that was sealed and he began to remove the seals off the book now remember what happened when the first seal was open at at the uh when it got ready you realize that the White Horse the white horse rider has been preached and still is today and there's a lot of confusion that surrounds it that it's been preached as Christ and and and it's for good reason it's because without a revelation it appears that way because the the Bible said in Revelation 6 in the opening of the first seal it says I saw Behold a white horse and he that set up on him had a bow a crown was given to him he went forth conquering and to conquer looks like a great man well it looks the same as Revelations 19 and 11 he said and I saw heaven open and behold a White Horse He that set upon him was called faithful and true and and in righteousness he does judge and make war now how many realizes that Jesus Christ it was Christ sitting upon a white horse in righteousness he judge and make war he was called faithful and truth but realize Revelation 6 he was sitting on a white horse he went forth conquering he was given a crown and he had a bow you realize see brother Mark he looked so close to what Christ at the church well today uh but I know there's some kind of coming out of it now but but many uh uh the most still say today well that was Christ and he come in power and it came forth to conqueror or it was somebody that God had anointed to come forth to conqueror to set things in order water but you realize that that when a Prophet come and he took this he made it plain he said this was not Christ it was the Antichrist because he had a bow and no arrows he was a bluff he just see so he takes these seals brother Mar and he actually goes and he starts to show you where they are and show you who we are and by the Fulfillment of what Jesus said to the disciples remember Matthew 24 remember what the question was he said what is the sign of the end that's what that they asked Jesus and Jesus says to them what's what's he say he said as they sat there they said what will the end be what are the signs of the coming what is the end of the world the first thing Jesus said to them he said take heed that no man deceive you this is how Jesus answers he said for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many now watch this in Matthew 24 the first thing Jesus would say would happen they will come and say I am Christ and shall deceive many now watch when the seal comes off the book in Revelations the sixth chapter in the first verse when the first seal comes off the book it's a white horse rider that has a bow and no arrows in other words it's one that looks like Christ but it come to deceive many now watch what the prophet does he said now what was the second thing in Matthew 24 Jesus said and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars and see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom now how many when now now if you go back and read Revelation 6 in the fourth verse the second seal is being opened what was the second seal he said there went out another horse that was a red horse power was given upon him to take peace away from the earth well what happens when you take peace off of the earth you get war and rumors of war and Nation Rising against nation and the Bible said the peace would be taken off the Earth and they should kill one another and there was given him a great sword so the first seal was Matthew 24 the second seal was Matthew 24 what was it it was identifying the signs that the end of the world was near remember that's what they asked now what was the third thing that Jesus said Matthew 24:7 he said there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places all these things are the beginning of Sorrows famines pestilences what happened in the third seal Revelation 6 he said then I saw a black horse and he that set up on him had a pair of balances in his hand I heard him say in the midst of the four beasts a measure of wheat for a penny here they're begging for food a measure three measures of barley for a penny see not thou see thou hurt not the oil and the wine say see here the third seal Matthew 24 watch the fourth thing Jesus said would happen he said they'll deliver you to be afflicted and they shall kill you and you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake what happened in the fourth seal Revelations 6 and8 he said I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that set upon him was death and Hell Followed With Him and the power was given unto him over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and hunger and death and the Beast of the earth you said well who was it they killed you'll find that out in the fifth seal he said when the fifth seal was opened I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and the testimony for which they had does that not exactly say what Matthew 24 said he said they shall kill you and you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake because of the testimony they had he said they would be slain because of their testimony they would be killed my friends don't you see what's happening here that the opening of the seals was the revealing of the sign of the end of the world it was the O it was the revealing of the signs of the time that's why the Bible would say Revelations 10:7 that this Angel would come and he would declare that time would be no more you see the purpose of the Angel it was a declaration that we're living in the end time otherwise we' just go on by and say there's another thousand years that's going to come so why we got to why we even need to go to church why would you even need to tell your kids it ain't going to matter there won't be a Rapture until thousand years down the road but there has to come a time that the word would be fulfilled so here an angel of God comes and he stands one foot on the land and one foot on the sea and he makes a declaration that there shall be no time any longer this is a fulfillment of what Jesus said that that it'll be the sign of the end time he begin to remove the question from the minds of people and unfold the mystery that was upon the book and to show you who you are where you came from where you're going the age we're living in he showed you that we're living that we're in the end time oh don't you realize friends that the purpose man people get so caught up but the real just make it simple the purpose of the Angel was to show us where we're living it was to show us who we are it was to show us that that we're in the that that the age we're living in the time and and and that we ain't going to go through another hundred Generations but this is the end time it's going home time it's m it's to get the church to be Rapture Ready again when they had fallen away from God through every age the church fell away no wonder what what Satan does why does he come to destroy your confidence in God's word is't that such a wise attack he comes to destroy your confidence in the only thing that could help you so he comes I'll tell you what he don't have to come by he don't have to come by and tempt you with something he don't have to come by and get you to go off in in the sin or in the world but all he does is comes and destroys your confidence in the very thing that would take you out of this world the only way you'll ever make a Rapture this is Satan's greatest trick here this isn't something that I'm telling you today it's something that the prophet told us 50 years ago that that's Satan's greatest trick is to destroy your confidence in the word of God what's that tell me stay stay confident in God's word keep God's word at the Forefront of your of your life brother Mar don't don't don't lose faith in the word of God keep a hold of the Revelation that God has sent you m m make sure that Revelation came from God make sure it wasn't talked into you make sure it wasn't told into you make sure nobody convinced you of it but you go somewhere get in the backs side get in a prir closet somewhere and let a revelation come by the Holy Ghost of who Jesus Christ is in this age too many people going to church they get wrapped up in too many theologies and they come really wise people and they they sit through years of dead churches trying to teach people what what things are of God they never have any Holy Ghost movement brother Mark the Revelation ain't coming from the Holy Ghost it's coming from a pastor reading it out of a book but I thank God there's still somebody that'll go to the backside of a desert and get a revelation from almighty God it can't come from a church it's got to come from God and when the devil don't want you to have it you see why he wants to keep the holy ghost out of the church he don't want you to have it he don't want you to get into that atmosphere where you don't care who you are or you don't you don't even know who you are and you and you forget your own name he don't want you in that atmosphere why because that's where the revelation of God comes from so I'll just keep you down here in carnality can I Pastor for a minute I'll just keep you down here in the world and I I'll just keep you down here all these pressures of life and I I'll keep you down here in all these work problems and and family problems and church problem I'll just keep you wrapped up in all this I don't want you in that atmosphere cuz that's where a real Revelation comes said what is he trying to do destroy your confidence in the word of God because they don't want you having the Revelation but let me tell you friends don't fall for it don't fall for it how many say Amen don't fall for it I'll try to lose your confidence in the word don't fall for it see because everybody has their part to play you say that means me yes you we all have a part to play according to the Bible see God part what was God's part to expose the devil what was Jesus's part he said to show it to the servants what was John's part to write it down what was the prophet's part to reveal it to you and what's your part the Bible says to hear it and to keep it see we all have a part that's what can I let me read it to you the Bible said the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass he sent and signified by his Angel to his servant John who bear record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and blessed is he that reads and hears the words of this prophecy and keeps those things which are written therein for the time is at hand blessed is he that hears blessed are the readers brother Mark blessed are the hearers blessed are the keepers I say of the word of God well friends let me tell you if you've heard this message and recognize it to be true you're a truly blessed if you've heard it and you've recognized it to be the voice of God you're truly blessed or blessed by but said no man is ever the same he said you might hear in your ears a voice speaking he said but if you could ever hear it with your heart he said then you're really hearing you don't see with your eye you look with your eye but you see with your heart don't just see it don't just hear it with your ears but you you don't really just kind of want to understand it but you want to hear with your ears you want to hear with your heart he said let's hear the true voice of God and don't let it fall off of you like water off a duck B but when you really hear it you hear it with your heart and receive it in your heart and let it be received into your life and let it become who you are it's a true revelation of Jesus Christ I say every one of them oh glory to God don't you realize where we are all the rest of them has done played their part the God has done expose the devil Jesus has done showed it to the servants John has already wrote it the prophet has already revealed it now it's our time brother Mark to hear the word of God and to receive it and to say amen and to call it truth and to stand on it and catch a re revelation of who Jesus Christ is and friends let me tell you when you play your part there will be a Revival that'll come to your heart you won't be a dead church member no more you won't be looking at all these other things and other churches and all the things that they're trying to preach to put to bring a wet blanket on the people of God but something will burn in your heart that little bit of of zeal will come to your heart you'll say I believe in the revelation of Jesus Christ it's not a dead Revelation it's a holy ghost Revelation it ain't a dead Revelation it's a god-given in Revelation and it puts Revival in the heart of people Bible said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches of each age brother said every age it was the same cry hear what the spirit says he said if you're a Christian you'll get back to what the spirit is teaching it's the word of God for this age if you're a real believer said every Messenger to every age will preach that word and every fresh and true Revival here it is is every fresh and true Revival will be will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age back to the word of God brother Travis back to the Holy Ghost back to praying for Revelation back to being a spiritual church you see where God's calling us you don't be no I know the the whole world can be a bunch of dead churches we're just not going to be one of them see brother M I don't like that kind of preaching with friend it's not going to change I mean I don't I hope you don't think it's going to stick around a little while and you're going to change me I caught a revelation of who Jesus Christ is I was a dead sinner that was lost in the world and he came and he changed my heart he turned my family around he turned my life around there's something in me that's burning in my heart that the devil can't put out I'm not going to be quiet about it I'm not going to stop hollering about it I ain't going to sit down on it but I'm going to stand and preach the word of God that that same gospel that changed my life could change somebody else's you want to have a dead Church go find one you ain't going to find it here he said remember we need to get back to being a spir glory to God I feel like preaching he said we need to be back to being a spiritual church remember this in the church age book remember this this ain't me this is a prophet of God speaking to you remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it watch that white horse rider he looks just like him he looks just like a oh God sent man he looks just like Christ but he's a bluff he had a bow without any arrows he said he would come that Antichrist Spirit into the church and defile it what would he do brother Mark he said he would make it lukewarm make it formal and make it powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works at the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time that he has cast into the Lake of Fire he'll always fight it because he can't stand it that tells me friends until the time we're taking off of this herd that old Devil's still going to be raising his ugly head and trying to take the holy ghost out of the church and trying to take the move of God out of the people of God let me tell you something about God's people he'll never get it out of them because he didn't put it in them it didn't come from a man it didn't come from a church but it came from the revelation of Jesus Christ it's a holy ghost Revelation but Mark it came from one the one and only the bright and The Morning Star he revealed it unto them it didn't come from it it came from him brother Wesley he revealed it unto them no wonder no wonder there's so many great men today that are preaching this message great men around the world I see many of them great pastors do you realize the greatest Pastors in the world they're out there preaching this message they're great men I my hat off to every one of them for doing their part for the kingdom of God they're great men sometimes you know you you hear different ones and this may not agree this just this way maybe don't agree but that's just okay because every church is Sovereign everybody don't see everything the same way everybody's Revelation ain't on the same level we we're not we we're all growing in Christ but they're great men of God and I respect them all for the office that they hold and I thank God that God has these men that will hold this message over the people to show them as a standard brother Mark of what God has called us to he says see this is what Satan don't want he knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost listen now let this sink in he knows assuredly that that original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 and action is the true church the devil knows assuredly see the devil's sure of it most people aren't the devil's sure of it he said he knows assuredly that the True Church of God is that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 is the true church that Jesus claims as his own everything else is false doesn't matter who it is where it is everything else is false but the true church is that original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action that's the true church that Jesus claims as his own let me tell you something about that church it ain't a lukewarm Church it ain't a formal Church it ain't a powerless Church you know why you know some oh God some folks started out this way brother Mark but because it's it's hard to keep that standard over people it's hard to keep people that are that are being held down by leod DEA and they walk in church by the hundreds that are drugged down and chained down and bound down and it's hard for pastors to stand up and try to take those chains off of people and let the Holy Ghost move in the church and let people be free it's hard to come in week in and week out and drag people through the through the mud and and drag the chains off of them and drag the weights off their feet and help them to be able to stand up again and weak in and weak out and sometimes the ministers just get tired and they get wore down and they just give up on the fight but friends I thank God that there's a refreshing that come from the from the from the mouth of God but he said those that are thirsting from for life there's a there's a refreshing water that comes this morning there's a fresh word that said rise up and let the Holy Ghost move in the house of God rise up and get a refilling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost rise up and let a Revival strike your heart don't be lukewarm don't be formal and don't be powerless we're God's church we got a right to stand upon the word of God oh friends listen to tell you what Satan took Satan is taken a look he took a look alike church and he put a cross on the door and he conquered Millions by thinking that they're doing God of service has he not done it they've denied the power of God they denied the Holy Ghost they denied healing they denied prayer line they deny anything that has to do with the move of God they deny the revelation of Jesus Jesus Christ by doing so he has trapped many of God's children and he's keeping them from being what God called them to be friends but don't you realize that we have a call of God in this hour and I'm closing we've had a call of God in this hour and I'm going to tell you this call it was not in it was not made to be preached and left in 1950s or 1960s but this call of God is going out today me and brother Robert was visiting about it it was a call of God that came to the bride ofes Jesus Christ he said come out of her my people do you realize in the Old Testament there's a we read the story of Israel but the mark and how it types the Gentile church today so see where the where the where the church spiritual we're the church spiritual just like Israel was the church natural you know I could go through all the types of how that we're just like them that they were they were in bondage we were brought out of bondage human bondage just like Israel was brought out of Egyptian bondage I could go through all the tops that we come out of out of bondage Into the Wilderness but you know there's something that's a little different about our call and what God sent Moses to call them see our call and Israel's call was two different calls when you look when you look at what Moses's call was to the children of Israel but Mark the call wasn't to the children of Israel the call was to Pharaoh did you notice that Moses's call was let my people go I thought my isn't it something that when Moses went down this was his message let my people go it was a call to pharaoh and the reason it was a call to Pharaoh is because pharaoh had power over the people of God by prophecy by the word of God they were put under the power of pharaoh they were put under the uh they were put under bondage of pharaoh by the word of God he said they'll be in bondage under them for 400 years and because the word of God had put them under bondage of pharaoh then it had to take God to come by and he had to declare unto pharaoh to let him go but watch when our call came in this hour our call was come out of her my people the call wasn't to the devil the call to us was to the Bride of Jesus Christ cist you know what that tells me is that when God sent Moses to Israel he had to call Pharaoh cuz Pharaoh had power over him but when God sent a message to us he didn't he don't have to tell the devil anything he told you come out of it because the devil has already been defeated the enemy that has you bound has no power over you the Taskmaster that has you bound he has no authority over you he was defeated at Calvary so he gave you a different call he said come out of her my people he don't have to talk the devil out of it he don't have to show him any signs he don't have to do any wonders in his presence it's a call to every individual come out of her my people and when you get tired of living in it you may tell you what you'll do but Mark you'll throw your bag over your shoulder and you'll put your feet or in your shoes and you'll go down the road and say devil I ain't going to be a part of it no more I want to be a part of the move of almighty God I want the power of the Holy Ghost to be preached to my family I want to see the power of this message demonstrated in the preaching of the word of God it's a call to the people of God come out of her my people if you want to stand to your feet God don't have to talk the devil out you know why brother brother David Paul because we're already fighting a defeated enemy he beat our Taskmaster before we was ever born my isn't that good see their Taskmaster they he was he he he still had them defeated he was still alive but ours has already been defeated come out of her my people I don't have to go do 10 things and put some plagues and to get the devil to leave you alone I don't have to take the the staff and lay it on the ground and turn it into a snake again so the devil will leave you alone I don't have to displace some great Supernatural sign so the devil will leave you alone it was a call of God to every individual you come out of her my people come out of her come out of the confusion come out of the the denominational system come out of the things of this world and come back to the word of God it was called of God's children to come back to the word ain't that something defeated enemy I don't know about y'all it makes me want to shout all over this building our call their call was to a pharaoh that was holding them but our call is to a people to recognize who you are isn't that good come out of her come out of her my people you realize what that takes when you hear it it may take you a while to catch it brother Wesley come out of her my people many would hear that call and let it go I don't know who they're talking to you know when you go go into the fellowship hall and them kids are them kids are being Rowdy and running around in there and y'all playing that's what we built it for thank God for it take your Liberty but they in there playing one of them old daddies some of them are louder than others they'll come to the door let's go kids let's go brother brother wesy ain't got I said it but once some of y'all y'all repeat yourselves but he don't he's made made it plain they're at the age they they they understand but he comes in says kids get in a van and you know what all the kids there's all kinds of kids in the building but they don't all load up in their van paig have a heart attack they don't all load up in the van but they're all kids but he said come out of her my people see that was the call of God it was the voice of God calling to his children but Mark so when he calls many would hear it I don't know who he's talking to but there's some that would hear it and say that's me that's me I'm not going to be wrapped up in that I want to go up into the heavenlies I want to get the revelation of Jesus Christ I want to have a real Revelation who he is I want to know who our relationship I want him to speak to me I want to have communion with him I want to fellowship with him he's my God he's my father you love the Lord this morning let's just bow our heads
