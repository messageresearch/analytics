[45:26] your heart w't you just ask the Lord to

[47:20] get something from God Amen how many
[47:22] believe he's willing to give it to you
[47:24] amen I believe he is amen let's just
[47:26] read Exodus the 20th chapter and the
[47:29] first verse and uh the Bible this is the
[47:32] of course the very familiar reading of
[47:35] scripture uh but the Bible says and God
[47:37] spake all these words saying I am the
[47:39] Lord thy God which have brought them out
[47:41] of the land of Egypt or brought thee out
[47:43] of the land of Egypt and out of the
[47:45] house of bondage Thou shalt have no
[47:47] other gods before me Thou shalt not make
[47:50] unto thee any Graven image or any
[47:52] likeness of anything that is in heaven
[47:54] above or that is in the earth beneath or
[47:56] that is in the water under the Earth
[47:58] Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them
[48:00] nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am
[48:03] a jealous God visiting the iniquity of
[48:06] the fathers upon the children under the
[48:08] third and the fourth generation of them
[48:10] that hate me we'll just ask the Lord to
[48:12] add His blessings to the reading of the
[48:14] word this morning as you take your seats
[48:16] I want to speak on uh this subject on a
[48:19] shattered image a shattered image now uh
[48:23] I know that this is a very familiar uh
[48:26] portion of scripture and and uh of
[48:29] course all of our young people the these
[48:31] young kids that have these wonderful
[48:32] Sunday school teachers every one of them
[48:34] could read to us the Ten Commandments
[48:36] and uh probably quote them better than
[48:38] we could and and uh but this is the the
[48:41] scripture where Moses had first brought
[48:43] the uh Ten Commandments and read them
[48:45] over the children of Israel and and of
[48:47] course you you realize that there were
[48:49] you know many Commandments there was the
[48:51] command to give uh to keep the Sabbath
[48:54] day to keep it a holy day I'm not going
[48:55] to preach on each one but one of them is
[48:57] a lesson and and a great message that so
[48:59] often times get put back in uh into into
[49:02] some old Covenant or something that
[49:04] don't matter anymore but they ought to
[49:05] mean something to us and uh but but but
[49:08] it was to the keep remember the Sabbath
[49:10] day and keep it holy and uh and then and
[49:12] to and thou shalt not commit murder or
[49:14] to kill or shall not commit adultery or
[49:16] Thou shalt not steal or Thou shalt not
[49:18] bear false witness against thy neighbor
[49:20] and or don't covet thy neighbor's house
[49:22] or his wife or servants or things that
[49:24] he had in other words that uh that the
[49:26] spirit of jealousy would have no place
[49:28] in The Believer but whenever you look
[49:30] through the Commandments that God had
[49:32] made you realize that this must have
[49:34] been something that was important to God
[49:35] it was the first thing that he mentioned
[49:37] when Moses uh uh came to give the
[49:39] Commandments and uh it was the first one
[49:41] that was established of the Ten
[49:43] Commandments and and it wasn't a little
[49:45] thing to God whenever you I won't read
[49:47] them all this morning but when you read
[49:49] through the things that God had said
[49:51] through the Old Testament of the people
[49:53] that had disobeyed this commandment it
[49:55] was of a great uh it was of a great
[49:57] punishment that God would bring upon one
[50:00] that wasn't obedient to this command
[50:02] that God had made and uh matter of fact
[50:04] in the book of Deuteronomy the Bible
[50:05] says uh to him that standeth here here
[50:08] Moses would give the order of those that
[50:10] would break this law that that would
[50:12] have a Graven image or they would they
[50:14] would bow to another God or have an idol
[50:16] and and but but as he would would speak
[50:18] to Moses he said it those that stand
[50:20] here this day before the Lord and also
[50:23] him that is not here he said you know
[50:26] how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt
[50:28] and how we came through the Nations
[50:30] which you passed by and you have seen
[50:32] their Abominations and their idles of
[50:35] wood and stone and silver and gold which
[50:37] are among them God began to talk to them
[50:39] about their journey and how uh the
[50:41] things that they had passed and the
[50:43] cities and the Nations and and God
[50:45] called their attention to all the things
[50:47] that they had came by and he said this
[50:49] is how the world lives and this is how
[50:50] this nation lives and this is the gods
[50:52] that they have and and some are of wood
[50:54] and some are of stone and and you pass
[50:56] by these great many Abominations and
[50:58] their Idols he said but lest there be
[51:00] should be some among you a man or a
[51:02] woman or a family or tribe whose heart
[51:04] would turn away this day from the Lord
[51:06] Our God to go and serve the gods of
[51:08] these nations unless there should be
[51:10] among you a root that would beareth Gall
[51:12] and wormwood and it would come to pass
[51:14] that when you would hear the words of
[51:16] this curse that you would bring a
[51:18] blessing or bless yourself in your heart
[51:20] and say that I shall have peace and and
[51:22] I can walk in the imagination of my
[51:24] heart he said then you've added
[51:25] drunkenness to thirst he said for the
[51:27] Lord will not spare him but when the
[51:29] anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall
[51:32] smoke him against that man and all the
[51:34] curses that are written in this book
[51:36] shall lie upon him and the Lord shall
[51:38] blot out his name from under the heaven
[51:40] this is a great thing to God for for for
[51:43] to have another God or idolatry or build
[51:46] up an image and he said he would blot
[51:47] his name out from under Heaven the Bible
[51:49] the Bible would tell us any of you that
[51:51] are Bible studiers this morning you
[51:52] realize that God didn't just say that
[51:54] but God did it and uh remember last
[51:56] Sunday when we were preaching on the
[51:57] sins of jeroboam and how that jeroboam
[51:59] had taken a golden calf and he had put
[52:01] one in in Dan and and the other he had
[52:04] placed in the city of Beth remember when
[52:05] he he said it's too much to go to
[52:07] Jerusalem to worship God so we'll we'll
[52:09] just make it easier to worship and we'll
[52:11] put a golden calf over here in Dan and
[52:13] it'll make it a little less journey and
[52:15] and he put priests over it and they made
[52:17] sacrifices unto it and they and they
[52:19] built a temple for the uh for a golden
[52:21] calf to be worshiped and they they they
[52:23] copied basically all the things that you
[52:24] would do in order to rightfully worship
[52:26] God but the only problem is is they took
[52:28] God out of it and so they replaced it
[52:30] with another God so they still went
[52:32] through the motions they still came to
[52:33] church and they they still lifted their
[52:35] hands and they still said amen and they
[52:37] still praise the Lord and they still
[52:38] made sacrifices they still you could
[52:40] take it to a modern day and they still
[52:42] spoke in tongues and they still
[52:43] prophesied and they and all the things
[52:45] that would that would that would appear
[52:47] to be things of God but the problem is
[52:49] is that they took God out of it and they
[52:51] replaced it with a golden calf and so so
[52:53] what good is all the noise and what good
[52:55] is all the uh
[52:57] of the of going through the motions of
[52:58] going to church and being and and and
[53:00] and and being there on a Sunday and
[53:02] making the sacrifice if there's no God
[53:04] in there to worship and so so you see
[53:06] but when they replac these Gods the
[53:08] Bible would tell us that the one was in
[53:09] bethl now how many knows that bethl was
[53:11] a city that was on the border of Ephraim
[53:14] which was one of the original tribes of
[53:16] Israel and of course Dan being a tribe
[53:18] of Israel you can find that in the book
[53:19] of numbers and many places in the Old
[53:21] Testament but you'll notice that that in
[53:23] the Book of Revelations whenever the
[53:25] whenever God begins to speak of the
[53:27] 144,000 and 12,000 from each tribe would
[53:30] be called out of Israel that when you
[53:32] read in Revelation 7 that no longer is
[53:34] Dan and Ephraim listed in the tribes of
[53:37] Israel so see God didn't just say that
[53:39] I'll remove their name out of the book
[53:41] but God did it he removed that that
[53:43] whenever you read of the tribes of
[53:44] Israel no longer are they even listed
[53:46] the places that had an idol in them the
[53:48] places where the people went to worship
[53:50] the Bible said that when they put those
[53:52] Idols in those cities that it caused
[53:55] everybody to sin it it caused people to
[53:57] fall you realize the danger of an idol
[53:59] that's built up it wasn't just jeroboam
[54:01] that it caused jeroboam to fall but
[54:03] because he built up an idol and he
[54:05] established it before the congregation
[54:07] and now it caused the congregation to
[54:10] follow after the wrong thing and it
[54:11] caused the congregation to to go and it
[54:14] was an easy way and it was an easy God
[54:16] to serve and he didn't have the laws
[54:18] like God had and he he didn't have the
[54:21] there wasn't such a the pressure and you
[54:24] know it just seemed like an easier way
[54:25] to serve God him but the Bible said that
[54:27] their name was removed from the book
[54:30] listen and God said and the Lord shall
[54:32] separate him and unto evil out of all
[54:35] the tribes of Israel according to all
[54:37] the curses of the Covenant that are
[54:39] written in the book of the law so that
[54:41] the generation to come of your children
[54:43] that shall rise up after you the
[54:44] stranger will come from AAR land and
[54:47] he'll say when they see the plagues of
[54:49] that land and the sicknesses which the
[54:51] lord has laid upon it and that whole
[54:53] land thereof is brimstone and salt and
[54:55] burning and swn down down and and nor
[54:57] beareth and no any Grass Grows and like
[54:59] the overthrow of Sodom and gomorra and
[55:01] adman Zeon which the Lord overthrew in
[55:03] his anger and his wrath even all the
[55:05] nations shall say wherefore hath the
[55:08] Lord done this unto this land what
[55:10] meaneth the heat of his great anger the
[55:13] men shall say because they have forsaken
[55:15] the Covenant of the Lord God of their
[55:17] fathers which he made with them when he
[55:19] brought them forth out of the land of
[55:21] Egypt for they went and they served
[55:23] other gods and they worshiped them Gods
[55:26] whom they knew not and whom God had not
[55:29] given unto them his Fury would be so
[55:32] great that Brother David whenever
[55:34] whenever people would ask what did they
[55:37] do to cause such a thing what did they
[55:39] do to cause the anger of God to be
[55:42] kindled against them in such a way what
[55:44] did they do to bring such a curse upon
[55:47] their life and then the men would say
[55:49] because they raised up an image before
[55:51] God they they've raised up something and
[55:53] they've went from worshiping God and
[55:55] they've raised up this great image and
[55:56] made it Christianity or or made it made
[55:59] it the god they made an image and they
[56:01] made some other God they made a Graven
[56:02] image and you realize that whenever God
[56:04] would say this he would say there should
[56:06] be no image there would be no graven
[56:08] image made there would be nothing that
[56:10] would come between me and you you say
[56:12] why would this mean so much to God I'm
[56:13] just laying a foundation here but but
[56:15] you realize that whenever God made this
[56:17] Commandment that this came after a time
[56:19] when images were there there were many
[56:21] images that were made the Nations that
[56:23] they passed through other nations and
[56:25] rulers they had their own God they were
[56:27] any other Nation outside of Israel they
[56:29] were following after their own God they
[56:31] had their own deities they had those
[56:33] that they worshiped they had they had
[56:34] Idols that they had built up when God
[56:37] gave the law to Moses you think about it
[56:39] when he said you shall have no God he
[56:41] said because I delivered you and you
[56:43] were in a hopeless State you were in a
[56:46] place of bondage you you were it was
[56:48] when you had no hope but I came in and I
[56:51] delivered you out of that place listen
[56:53] listen as God be to before he ever even
[56:55] spoke to him he said I want to remind
[56:57] you who our our relationship and I want
[56:59] to remind you where you were whenever I
[57:02] called you and I want to remind you of
[57:04] what you were in and what you were
[57:05] wrapped up in and the things you were in
[57:07] and the things your family was going
[57:09] through whenever I came and I called you
[57:11] out of it and I I released you from
[57:13] bondage and I established you and I made
[57:15] a way for you and I established your
[57:17] goings and I and I called you out of
[57:19] this state of bondage to give you a
[57:20] place that you could freely worship me
[57:22] God said I I called you from this place
[57:24] you think about it the way that God
[57:26] would look on it as he would as he would
[57:28] bring them from this place you realize
[57:30] that they had that they had just came
[57:32] from hundreds of years of bondage and
[57:35] living under the influence of an
[57:37] Egyptian culture and religion this this
[57:40] this Israelite Nation when God called
[57:42] them you realize that they lived in the
[57:43] land of Egypt and the Bible would tell
[57:45] us or actually history would tell us
[57:47] that in the land of Egypt that there
[57:48] were
[57:49] 1,500 Egyptian gods that are known by
[57:52] name outside of the ones that we don't
[57:55] even know the name to but but you can
[57:56] see these gods and uh uh uh through the
[57:59] the civilization brother brother Tim has
[58:01] a has a photo that but but all through
[58:03] the tombs you'll see the Egyptian gods
[58:05] they were written on hieroglyphics they
[58:06] were put in tombs they were when someone
[58:08] was buried they' put the God that was
[58:10] the god of that family and they would
[58:12] draw the image of it over their uh over
[58:14] their tomb or their or their family
[58:16] gravite but you realize that there were
[58:18] there were so many of them 1500 there
[58:20] was no way to go to go through it all
[58:22] this morning but but when you look at
[58:24] these Gods this this that's the god of
[58:26] oseris which is the the the great one of
[58:28] the greatest Gods a major God and then
[58:30] annabis which is a minor God and Horus
[58:32] who's a great God which was which is
[58:34] said to be the son of of ocus and and
[58:37] one of the one of the female gods and
[58:39] but that that picture is actually a a
[58:41] real picture that's thousands of years
[58:43] old that that was in the valley of kings
[58:45] in the Tomb of horb and so so there this
[58:48] is what Israel came out of this is the
[58:50] nation that they were in these are the
[58:52] children of God I I'm putting that there
[58:54] to to plant a seed this morning there
[58:56] that everywhere they look this is the
[58:57] imagees they looked at when they walked
[58:59] down the streets of Egypt these are the
[59:01] great images that they saw and there
[59:03] were there were so many gods in Egypt
[59:05] they were can I can I just lay a few
[59:07] down here but but there was AER that was
[59:10] the god of the earth and Ammon who was
[59:12] the creator God the deity of Egypt and
[59:15] and an her a god of war and a god of
[59:18] Honey a which was a Sund this deity that
[59:21] that was a a great a great God Adam
[59:23] which was a Creator God a solar deity
[59:26] benu which was a solar God which was
[59:28] depicted as a heron and then jab which
[59:30] was an earth God and happy which was the
[59:33] god of the of the Nile flood Horus which
[59:35] was a major God he was usually shown as
[59:38] a falcon or as a human child he linked
[59:40] him with the sky and kingship and
[59:42] protection and healing and all those
[59:43] things uh uh kepri which was another
[59:45] solar God he was often treated as the as
[59:48] the mourning form of the god raw who
[59:50] would come in the evening and so in the
[59:52] morning they would worship this God in
[59:53] the evening then they they would worship
[59:55] God or or raw and so and then and then
[59:57] Nam or neemu he was a he was a ram God
[1:00:00] he was a patron deity and and that would
[1:00:04] control the floods of the waters and he
[1:00:05] would give life to the gods and life to
[1:00:07] the humans and and then consu which was
[1:00:09] a moon God Mahesh which was a lion God
[1:00:12] Manu the God of War nerum which was a
[1:00:15] the god of lotus NTI which was a falcon
[1:00:17] God he was worshiped in middle Egypt he
[1:00:20] he was the one that appeared as the
[1:00:21] fairy man if you ever seen the myth of
[1:00:22] the Egyptian gods he he was the fairy
[1:00:24] man uh uh greater gods and then Neer
[1:00:28] which was the god of grain so then ocus
[1:00:30] which we've seen the picture of which
[1:00:32] was which was the god of death and
[1:00:33] Resurrection he he's the one that that
[1:00:35] that they would say that was the ruler
[1:00:37] of the underworld he he kept an eye on
[1:00:39] things after you died and to determine
[1:00:41] where where you would come back in this
[1:00:42] afterlife and and so and then T which
[1:00:45] was a a Creator deity and the god of
[1:00:48] Memphis and set which was ambivalent God
[1:00:51] there Shu which was the god of the wind
[1:00:53] or the god of the air sobec which was
[1:00:56] the Crocodile God that was that was
[1:00:58] worshiped by by comomo the great uh the
[1:01:00] great uh uh group and and and sdu which
[1:01:03] was the god of the sky tho which was a
[1:01:05] moon God the god of writing and the god
[1:01:07] of scribes and and then wwor which was a
[1:01:10] which was the god of the Mediterranean
[1:01:12] Sea so every every great place every
[1:01:15] river every sea Every Mountain every
[1:01:17] every great thing in Egypt had a God
[1:01:19] that you could worship so if whatever
[1:01:21] you had need of there was somebody to go
[1:01:23] to that would certainly be able to to
[1:01:25] bring it to pass even even the the the
[1:01:27] the women had their own Gods the female
[1:01:29] counterpart of Ammon which was ammonet
[1:01:32] anakate which was The Feathered
[1:01:33] headdress wereing Goddess of Egypt
[1:01:35] that's that's plenty of them to get the
[1:01:36] picture there was a lot of gods in Egypt
[1:01:38] these are some of the major major gods
[1:01:40] and and you realize that this uh nation
[1:01:43] of Israel this is what they lived in on
[1:01:45] a day basis the children that came out
[1:01:47] of Israel they were born in the nation
[1:01:50] of Egypt that worshiped these Gods when
[1:01:52] they went and they played with their
[1:01:53] little friends in the street these gods
[1:01:55] were on building they were on the houses
[1:01:57] they were lifted up they they were great
[1:01:59] statues and things of them built so you
[1:02:01] see when they come out of this all these
[1:02:03] great statues and things that were built
[1:02:05] to these Gods but let me ask you this
[1:02:07] who do you think built all those statues
[1:02:09] of these Gods it wasn't the Egyptian
[1:02:11] princes that built them it was the
[1:02:13] Hebrew slaves so here God knew this one
[1:02:16] thing that the hands of his children had
[1:02:19] built every God the hands of the
[1:02:21] children of God had built their feet
[1:02:23] they had built the legs of them they had
[1:02:25] built these palaces to worship them it
[1:02:27] was the hands of the children of Israel
[1:02:29] that built the statues it was the hands
[1:02:31] of the children of Israel that built the
[1:02:33] places of worship and you realize that
[1:02:35] even though they had labored over them
[1:02:36] let me tell you something friends they
[1:02:38] put their work into it they put their
[1:02:40] sweat into it and they labored over them
[1:02:42] and they built them for Egypt and they
[1:02:44] built these great Gods but you realize
[1:02:46] of all the labor that they done for them
[1:02:48] that those Gods never done one thing for
[1:02:50] the children of Israel they never done
[1:02:52] one thing for God's children I thought
[1:02:54] my but see God had a prophecy he said in
[1:02:57] 400 years you'll live in a Land of
[1:02:59] bondage but at the end of 400 years I'm
[1:03:02] going to bring you out and let me tell
[1:03:03] you when God went to keep his word after
[1:03:06] 400 years of them living in this place
[1:03:08] of God or or or or a place of bondage
[1:03:11] when it came time for God to move David
[1:03:14] Paul there wasn't a single Pharaoh there
[1:03:16] wasn't no Army of pharaoh there was no
[1:03:19] God of Egypt there wasn't 1,500 deities
[1:03:22] that could stop Jehovah God from
[1:03:24] fulfilling his word
[1:03:26] you me tell you what that means it means
[1:03:28] it turns out that Oh Glory I feel like
[1:03:30] preaching on it turns out that benu had
[1:03:33] no power over the son after all but let
[1:03:36] me tell you my god did when he took
[1:03:38] Joshua down there that day when he was
[1:03:40] in the middle of a battle and through
[1:03:41] the voice of a of a man of God he told
[1:03:44] the son to stand still that he could
[1:03:46] finish his battle it turns out that they
[1:03:48] had no power over the sea like God did
[1:03:51] when Moses went down to the Red Sea and
[1:03:53] the waters would stop them but he
[1:03:55] stretched his dried out over the sea and
[1:03:57] the waters parted and the children of
[1:03:59] Israel went across dry Tri it turns out
[1:04:01] they had no power over the Earth like
[1:04:03] God did when he sent a Prophet by the
[1:04:05] name of Elijah and told the Earth that
[1:04:07] it couldn't bring forth seed any longer
[1:04:09] and a famine would come on the land it
[1:04:11] turned out they had no power over the
[1:04:14] rain and the power over the heavens like
[1:04:16] God did when he called his Prophet to
[1:04:18] speak to the heavens and call Rain upon
[1:04:20] the Earth again sir it turns out they
[1:04:23] had no power after all you think about
[1:04:26] it they had no power over anything they
[1:04:28] had no they had no power over the
[1:04:30] animals oh friends I could preach this
[1:04:31] morning if you let me they had no power
[1:04:34] over the animals like God did when
[1:04:36] Abraham took his own son Isaac up on a
[1:04:38] mountain to lay him on a rock to
[1:04:40] sacrifice him and the Bible said when he
[1:04:42] laid him up there he said the lord
[1:04:43] giveth and the lord taketh away I'll
[1:04:46] I'll do what God has told me to do and
[1:04:48] the Bible says but then there was a ram
[1:04:50] that was caught in the thicket the
[1:04:52] sacrifice that repl replace the life of
[1:04:54] his own son let me tell you friends it
[1:04:56] wasn't nemu the ram God that supplied a
[1:04:59] ram for Abraham but it was Jehovah God
[1:05:02] that put a ram in a Thicket let me tell
[1:05:04] you because he's Jehovah he's the god of
[1:05:07] creation he's the god of the son he's
[1:05:09] the god of the heaven he's the god of
[1:05:11] the sea he's the god of the earth he's
[1:05:13] the god of the water he's the god of the
[1:05:15] foul he's the god of every creeping
[1:05:17] thing he's the god of the beasts of the
[1:05:19] land and he put a ram in a Thicket let
[1:05:23] me tell you this friends the gods of
[1:05:24] Egypt were no match for Jehovah God I
[1:05:27] feel like having church I can't help it
[1:05:29] they were no match for Jehovah God let
[1:05:32] me tell SOC the crocodile God he
[1:05:34] couldn't even destroy Moses when he was
[1:05:36] a baby laying in a basket floating down
[1:05:38] the river and aisle I said the gods of
[1:05:40] Egypt were no match for the god Jehovah
[1:05:43] God he's the god you say well why
[1:05:46] couldn't they do it because they were
[1:05:48] gods that were created by the
[1:05:50] imagination of men and I got some news
[1:05:53] for you this morning that every God God
[1:05:56] that is made out of the imagination of
[1:05:58] men will perish with the men that
[1:06:00] imagine them they'll have no place well
[1:06:03] let me tell you that's what happened
[1:06:04] when the flood came the Bible says the
[1:06:06] flood came you know what it destroyed
[1:06:08] the Bible says man's imagination was on
[1:06:11] evil continually the thoughts of man
[1:06:12] they had built up many gods and idols
[1:06:14] and things that men worship they refused
[1:06:16] to worship God like Noah and his family
[1:06:18] did but when the flood Came Upon the
[1:06:20] Earth it took every man every
[1:06:22] imagination every God that they had ever
[1:06:24] built up in every house in every land in
[1:06:27] every Temple and it destroyed it off the
[1:06:29] face of the Earth they have no power
[1:06:31] over Jehovah
[1:06:33] God I'm so thankful this morning brother
[1:06:35] Wesley I'm thankful that we don't have
[1:06:37] to have a different God for everything
[1:06:40] we have need of right I'm thankful I
[1:06:43] don't have to have a God for the sun and
[1:06:45] a God for the moon and a God for the
[1:06:47] stars and a god it may mean more to you
[1:06:50] if you ever went to India one time but
[1:06:51] but God I I can I just tell it I I was
[1:06:53] over there in in one of the trips that I
[1:06:56] had gone on in the great uh hurricane it
[1:06:58] was a hurricane pile and you can look it
[1:06:59] up when you get home but this hurricane
[1:07:01] it was a class 4 hurricane and to take
[1:07:03] over the whole entire east coast of
[1:07:05] India they evacuated I believe it was
[1:07:07] 1.2 million people the newspaper said
[1:07:10] I've got the article at home if you ever
[1:07:11] want to see it but they evacuated people
[1:07:13] but more importantly I was in the
[1:07:15] evacuation so there when they were
[1:07:17] evacuating everybody out of the city cuz
[1:07:19] this hurricane was coming to destroy the
[1:07:21] coast of India I have a photo on my on
[1:07:24] my tablet of of the hurricane as it was
[1:07:27] as it had to uh uh showed that that vag
[1:07:30] the city we were in was in the middle of
[1:07:32] where this storm was coming there there
[1:07:33] was no way around it and people were
[1:07:35] evacuated off the coast and move to
[1:07:36] other places so we I couldn't get on
[1:07:39] evacuation bus and be stranded out in
[1:07:41] the middle of India so I went to the
[1:07:42] hotel and we had people praying and we
[1:07:44] knelt down we started praying that the
[1:07:46] Lord would help us I said I don't
[1:07:47] believe God sent me here to Die the
[1:07:48] brother said brother what are you going
[1:07:50] to do I said I'm going to go to bed
[1:07:51] because I don't believe this Trip's over
[1:07:53] I don't believe God sent me here to die
[1:07:55] I I don't have nowhere else I can go
[1:07:57] there's no refuge for me in a in a camp
[1:07:59] in India somewhere but God supplied me a
[1:08:01] room and I'm going to the room and I'm
[1:08:02] going to rest and tomorrow we can
[1:08:04] continue on with the meeting we got up
[1:08:06] the next day in the newspaper article
[1:08:08] I've got it in my in in my office but
[1:08:10] the newspaper article it said the city
[1:08:12] of Destiny had another miraculous
[1:08:16] escape the hurricane that was coming to
[1:08:19] vac it turned and went up the coast and
[1:08:22] it said not even a single drop of rain
[1:08:25] fell in the city of Isaac oh friends let
[1:08:27] me tell you what happened when I went
[1:08:29] outside that morning the beaches were
[1:08:31] full of worshippers that were putting
[1:08:33] flowers out in the water and worshiping
[1:08:35] some goddess and some another God and
[1:08:37] some the god of the rain and some the
[1:08:39] god of hurricane I stood behind them and
[1:08:41] these brothers that were with me I
[1:08:43] thought my if their eyes could only be
[1:08:45] open for just a minute to realize it
[1:08:47] wasn't this goddess but it was Jehovah
[1:08:49] God he's the Creator he made the storm
[1:08:52] and he made the peace he made the sea he
[1:08:55] made the winds and the rain he's the god
[1:08:57] over all of it and he delivered us that
[1:09:00] day well guess what we went on and had a
[1:09:02] meeting I'm so thankful we baptized
[1:09:04] hundreds of people in those meetings
[1:09:06] because God had made a way you realize
[1:09:08] that God let a storm come just to have a
[1:09:10] testimony to use to build the meeting
[1:09:12] that's how God works he's the god over
[1:09:15] all of it I feel like I feel good this
[1:09:16] morning I'm thankful I don't have to
[1:09:18] have a different God can you imagine if
[1:09:20] you had to have a different God you got
[1:09:21] into some marriage troupel and you had
[1:09:23] to go around looking for the counselor
[1:09:24] God where where did I put the counselor
[1:09:26] here here we are in a mess I don't know
[1:09:27] where I put the counselor babe did you
[1:09:29] put it somewhere where is it can you
[1:09:31] look in your purse see if you can find
[1:09:32] the counselor because we're in trouble I
[1:09:35] don't have to have a different God when
[1:09:37] you get behind on your bills somebody
[1:09:38] help me I somebody find the prosperity
[1:09:41] God we're in trouble I don't know where
[1:09:43] to find him and and now I'm behind on my
[1:09:45] bill I don't know how I'm going to pay
[1:09:46] it when you get sick somebody find the
[1:09:48] Healer I don't know where I put the
[1:09:49] Healer when you when you have a when
[1:09:51] when the doctor says you can't have a
[1:09:52] baby somebody find the god of fertility
[1:09:54] that it'll friends it ain't got nothing
[1:09:56] to do with it there's one God his name
[1:09:58] is Jehovah and he can do it all you say
[1:10:01] how do you know because he is not an
[1:10:04] image that was created by the
[1:10:05] imaginations of man but he is a living
[1:10:08] reality that created man that's our god
[1:10:13] Jehovah God let me tell you what the
[1:10:15] Bible says we're not to make an image of
[1:10:17] him we're not to make an image but we're
[1:10:20] to be made in His image that's what the
[1:10:23] Bible said he didn't tell tell us to go
[1:10:25] make an image he said I made you in my
[1:10:27] image but say some some says if you pack
[1:10:30] an image of Christ in your car on your
[1:10:32] wall that it's a sign of a Christian
[1:10:34] said well them things are all right but
[1:10:35] I don't believe that packing an image
[1:10:37] makes you a Christian I believe that
[1:10:38] being an image of Christ is what makes
[1:10:40] you a Christian it's not what we do
[1:10:42] outwardly it's what happened inwardly
[1:10:44] that makes us what we are therefore if
[1:10:46] he is our image and we are in his
[1:10:48] likeness and we're members of his body
[1:10:49] we should be images like him then our
[1:10:52] lives should reflect the image of Christ
[1:10:54] not in our joining church or in our
[1:10:56] packing a crucifix or our emotions but
[1:10:59] it should be in the living presence of
[1:11:00] the Living God that's reflected through
[1:11:02] our life how many say Amen to that he
[1:11:05] say see church membership is all right I
[1:11:07] have nothing against it or any of those
[1:11:09] things but brother to be a Christian
[1:11:11] means to be conformed to the image of
[1:11:13] Christ we want to be the living images
[1:11:16] not pack an image but to be an image of
[1:11:19] the Lord Jesus Oh My it makes me feel
[1:11:21] good this morning we're to be an image
[1:11:23] of the Lord Jesus see if we're to
[1:11:25] reflect his image then what is his image
[1:11:28] I tell you what the Bible says here's
[1:11:29] what Paul said he said speaking of
[1:11:31] Christ in Colossians he said he is the
[1:11:33] image of the invisible God where to
[1:11:36] reflect Christ's image Paul said Christ
[1:11:38] was the image of the invisible God and
[1:11:40] the firstborn of every creature so if
[1:11:42] you're to reflect the image of Christ
[1:11:44] and Christ is the image of God think
[1:11:46] about what you're really supposed to be
[1:11:47] reflecting that's a tall task isn't it
[1:11:50] to reflect the image of God in this
[1:11:52] world but don't dismiss it that's what
[1:11:54] the Bible says you say I how could I
[1:11:55] reflect the image of a Creator how could
[1:11:58] I reflect the image of of almighty God
[1:12:00] how it's so easy to dismiss because we
[1:12:02] look at this flesh and how weak that we
[1:12:04] are and how could we ever reflect a
[1:12:06] deity in such a way as this but don't
[1:12:08] don't dismiss it because the Bible said
[1:12:09] that in Genesis the first chapter God
[1:12:11] said and God said let us make man in our
[1:12:14] image this was God's intention all along
[1:12:16] after our likeness and let him have
[1:12:18] dominion over the fish of the Sea and
[1:12:20] the foul of the air over the cattle over
[1:12:22] all the Earth over every creeping thing
[1:12:24] that creepeth upon the Earth so God
[1:12:26] created man in his own image and in the
[1:12:30] image of God created he him male and
[1:12:32] female created he them see so when God
[1:12:35] made men brother the Jared he made them
[1:12:38] in his own image and he gave them
[1:12:40] Dominion so people say well man was made
[1:12:43] in the image of God so that gives man
[1:12:44] dominion over everything now that ain't
[1:12:46] what God Said didn't give him dominion
[1:12:48] over everything because because there's
[1:12:49] some you don't have dominion over Paul
[1:12:51] would say that was an exception you say
[1:12:53] see because you have dominion over
[1:12:55] everything except for the god that
[1:12:56] created you let me just show you what
[1:12:58] God's saying see Paul Paul goes on and
[1:13:01] he tells us he tells you what part of
[1:13:02] this image that you are in Colossians he
[1:13:04] says for by Christ were all things
[1:13:06] created that are in heaven in Earth
[1:13:08] visible invisible whether they be
[1:13:10] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[1:13:12] or Powers all things were created by Him
[1:13:15] and for him and he is before all things
[1:13:17] and by him all things consist and he
[1:13:20] speaking of Christ he is the head of the
[1:13:23] body the church so Christ is the head
[1:13:26] and the church was the body said see so
[1:13:29] he he didn't ever Place us as the head
[1:13:31] the church is the body so here God would
[1:13:33] make you in His image but it was never
[1:13:34] to be have dominion over God say see so
[1:13:38] he is the the head of the body which is
[1:13:40] the church who is the beginning
[1:13:41] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:13:43] things he might have
[1:13:46] preeminence so here here's the here's
[1:13:48] the head of the body here's the the even
[1:13:50] though we were made in His image we were
[1:13:52] not made to replace God we were not made
[1:13:54] to be above God we were not made to be
[1:13:56] established and and and and Paul said
[1:13:58] for it pleased the father that in him
[1:13:59] should all the fullness dwell so the
[1:14:01] headship was given to Christ and the
[1:14:03] church the body under the headship of
[1:14:05] Christ would have authority over all
[1:14:07] things have dominion over the Earth and
[1:14:10] have dominion over sickness and have
[1:14:12] dominion over the Flesh and have
[1:14:13] dominion over death and hell and the
[1:14:15] grave and the and the devil he would
[1:14:17] have dominion under the headship of
[1:14:19] Jesus Christ see the Bible says you're
[1:14:21] made in the image of God but not that
[1:14:23] you would ever have authority over God
[1:14:25] let me let me tell you friends this
[1:14:27] morning that it don't matter how great
[1:14:28] you ever build a man that man will never
[1:14:31] have authority over God it doesn't
[1:14:32] matter how many men there are you can
[1:14:34] get a group of them together of Great
[1:14:36] Men and you can bind them together but
[1:14:38] they'll never have authority over God
[1:14:40] you can make a great nation you can get
[1:14:42] great armies you can make great
[1:14:44] coalitions but they'll never be above
[1:14:46] God God will never allow any man or any
[1:14:49] man-made thing to Tower above him or to
[1:14:51] replace him or to have dominion over him
[1:14:53] or to take preeminence over him God will
[1:14:55] never allow it see man tried that one
[1:14:58] time I know this may this may be a lot
[1:15:00] but man tried that that one time in the
[1:15:02] Book of Genesis in the 11th chapter
[1:15:04] remember when they went out after the
[1:15:05] flood they said I'll tell you what we'll
[1:15:06] do we'll just bind together and we'll
[1:15:08] make a tower that reaches up into the
[1:15:10] heavens and then if there if God ever
[1:15:12] comes and he floods the Earth again we
[1:15:13] won't have to worry about it because
[1:15:14] we'll just go up in the tower and
[1:15:16] everything will be saved we'll we'll
[1:15:17] just get we'll just we'll just achieve
[1:15:19] greatness and and you know what here
[1:15:20] whenever God saw them that he said they
[1:15:22] would do great things they would do
[1:15:24] things that that they they they should
[1:15:25] not be able to do and so here God would
[1:15:27] separate them by their own language and
[1:15:29] stop them from being able to do it
[1:15:31] remember when they built the Tower the
[1:15:32] Bible says God came he's divided their
[1:15:34] language they that they couldn't
[1:15:35] communicate any longer and they couldn't
[1:15:37] finish the task they could no longer
[1:15:39] work together and bind together to do
[1:15:41] this thing why because they were trying
[1:15:42] to take the place of God they were
[1:15:44] building something that would that would
[1:15:46] replace God isn't that something that
[1:15:48] all the way through the Bible through
[1:15:49] thousands of years of of of all history
[1:15:53] of of humanity there's always a people
[1:15:55] that are trying to replace God oh it
[1:15:58] don't matter if 6,000 years ago and
[1:16:00] today there's people that try to replace
[1:16:02] God they replac him with other men
[1:16:04] they'll replac him with churches they'll
[1:16:06] replac him with Idols they'll replac him
[1:16:08] with with with beliefs or denominations
[1:16:09] or great things and you see this great
[1:16:12] this great uh Tower of bab that was been
[1:16:14] built but butam said but see God has got
[1:16:17] enough of it he said he's had enough of
[1:16:19] this scientific Moon shooting missile
[1:16:22] dropping age that we're in it ain't
[1:16:24] nothing but another Tower of Babel and
[1:16:26] don't you know that God will destroy
[1:16:29] this Earth because he said he would he
[1:16:32] said that's the reason I'm out here
[1:16:33] tonight that's the reason I'm trying to
[1:16:35] press forward to get every soul that I
[1:16:37] can because the longsuffering of God in
[1:16:39] the days of Noah is the same as it is
[1:16:41] now he's not willing that any should
[1:16:43] perish and God sent every kind of a gift
[1:16:46] that he could before the people and
[1:16:47] still they stay outside of the Kingdom
[1:16:51] you say what causes it why does so many
[1:16:53] struggle entering in and why why why do
[1:16:56] they struggle with with the move of God
[1:16:58] and why do they struggle with the
[1:16:59] supernatural here here God would send
[1:17:02] Great Signs to the church to turn the
[1:17:04] hearts of the people away from the
[1:17:05] things that men had built up and back to
[1:17:08] God he said it's because much of it it
[1:17:10] comes from the pull pits that's being
[1:17:12] preached he said we know that when they
[1:17:14] get out they preach the denial of the
[1:17:15] days of Miracles and the denial of the
[1:17:17] Holy Ghost and so forth that's what
[1:17:19] brings that they deny the Supernatural
[1:17:22] and they deny what God's anointing they
[1:17:24] deny the things that God does they deny
[1:17:26] healing but friends we ain't coming to
[1:17:28] deny it this morning we're coming to
[1:17:30] invite it I don't deny the word I want
[1:17:32] to invite the word I don't deny the
[1:17:34] supernatural I I how many would join
[1:17:36] with me this morning I didn't come to
[1:17:37] deny the promise of God I come to invite
[1:17:40] it into my life I didn't deny the power
[1:17:42] of God but I want to invited it in my
[1:17:44] church we didn't come to deny it we came
[1:17:46] to invite it but you realize you realize
[1:17:49] what that Tower of bible really was see
[1:17:51] many put it in history whether it was
[1:17:53] just some that they built but it wasn't
[1:17:55] it was it was that they came together in
[1:17:57] such a way that they were building
[1:17:59] something together in such a way that
[1:18:02] they would be greater in God and friends
[1:18:03] I got news for you it wasn't left in
[1:18:05] history can I read you a modern day
[1:18:07] version of it this is in Revelation the
[1:18:09] 13th chapter you'll see the modern day
[1:18:11] version of the Tower of Babel the Bible
[1:18:14] says I stood on the sand of the sea and
[1:18:15] I saw a beast rise up out of the sea
[1:18:18] having seven heads and 10 horns and upon
[1:18:20] his horns 10 crowns and upon the heads
[1:18:22] the name of blasphemy and there was
[1:18:24] given unto him a mouth speaking great
[1:18:27] things and blasphemies blasphemies and
[1:18:30] he opened his mouth in blasphemy against
[1:18:32] God to blaspheme his name and his
[1:18:34] Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven
[1:18:37] and it was given unto him to make war
[1:18:39] with the Saints to overcome them and
[1:18:41] power was given him over all kindreds
[1:18:43] and tongues and Nations and all that
[1:18:45] dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him
[1:18:48] whose names are not written in the book
[1:18:50] of Li the lamb slain before the
[1:18:52] foundation of the world here bam says
[1:18:54] see what was he said see he this these
[1:18:56] blasphemies that are spoken anybody
[1:18:58] whose name was not written in that book
[1:19:01] they would all go worship Him you see
[1:19:02] the great Coalition or or the or The
[1:19:04] Binding Together of people and as long
[1:19:06] isn't it isn't it the way it is as long
[1:19:08] as we get enough people to agree with us
[1:19:10] then we then we can be right as long as
[1:19:12] we get enough people on board you know
[1:19:14] that's the way our that's the way our
[1:19:15] world is that's the way the the
[1:19:17] government is and Society well as long
[1:19:18] as enough people vote for it then it
[1:19:20] must be right that's how they judge
[1:19:21] whether things are right or wrong you
[1:19:23] get a bunch of ungodly men and women and
[1:19:25] a bunch of people that ain't filled with
[1:19:26] the Holy Ghost and you get them all
[1:19:28] together and you let them think with
[1:19:29] whatever nasty worldly thoughts they can
[1:19:31] and they can put that filthy mind to
[1:19:33] work and they can make a vote and that
[1:19:34] must be right because they all thought
[1:19:36] the same thing let me tell you friends
[1:19:38] you can take 10 billion flies and put
[1:19:40] them in a room and tell you to eat
[1:19:42] garbage but it's still going to taste
[1:19:43] like garbage it don't matter how many of
[1:19:45] them's on the garbage pile or on the
[1:19:47] Heap I think we ought to turn to the
[1:19:49] word of God this morning and forget what
[1:19:51] the world's trying to sell you and look
[1:19:52] to God's word and take the way with the
[1:19:55] Lord despise
[1:19:59] few they would all worship him if their
[1:20:01] names wasn't in the book but said don't
[1:20:04] you remember how Nimrod that hypocrite
[1:20:06] built this big tower he made all other
[1:20:08] cities pay tribute to it Babel is the
[1:20:10] same thing it just changes its name as
[1:20:12] it comes up it's Rome now it's Babylon
[1:20:15] and the whole world is brought to
[1:20:17] Babylon you realize what the world has
[1:20:19] done today I know you you may not study
[1:20:22] this stuff but you ever review the the
[1:20:24] Great coun the church councils the World
[1:20:26] Council of churches people bow down to
[1:20:28] it and they they'll take brother bam

[1:20:31] take on the mark of the beast and not
[1:20:32] even know it because what are they doing

[1:20:38] headship and let's all just come let's
[1:20:40] all just make peace and just well well

[1:20:48] let's said they take on the mark of the
[1:20:49] beast and not even know it he says see

[1:20:57] one he never dealt with one but those
[1:21:00] who are elected will hear the word and
[1:21:02] they'll come out of it we'll build up a
[1:21:05] great image we'll build up something
[1:21:07] great that'll draw people we'll build up
[1:21:09] some some man-made Theology and it'll
[1:21:12] draw people and we'll make we'll make
[1:21:13] some way that they can come isn't it
[1:21:15] something how the churches are well I'll
[1:21:16] tell you what we'll do you want to see
[1:21:18] the greatest moving churches in the
[1:21:19] world today the fastest growing churches
[1:21:21] in the world it's a church that has a
[1:21:23] Pentecostal that has a Pentecostal style
[1:21:26] or has that kind of music but they but
[1:21:28] they don't have any Holiness you want to
[1:21:30] see a fast moving the these churches out
[1:21:32] there in the world it's because they get
[1:21:34] in there and they and they'll they they
[1:21:36] love they love mimicking what the Holy
[1:21:37] Ghost is but they have but but they have
[1:21:39] no Holiness they take out that well you
[1:21:42] can come and you can be any my goodness
[1:21:43] I'm going to get myself in trouble but
[1:21:45] you can be a Christian you you can look
[1:21:47] like the world the women they cut their
[1:21:48] hair all off and they they they they run
[1:21:50] around half naked and and men and
[1:21:53] lusting after them and they're filth and
[1:21:54] the men turned into a bunch of sissies
[1:21:56] and there ain't nobody knows their place
[1:21:57] anymore a man that can't be a man and a
[1:21:59] woman can't be a a woman you can walk
[1:22:01] down the street and half the time you
[1:22:03] can't even tell them apart and somehow
[1:22:05] people have said that that's the normal
[1:22:07] let me tell you friends the only normal
[1:22:08] thing there is is Jesus Christ the only
[1:22:11] normal thing there is is the word of God
[1:22:13] you can't go to a denomination and find
[1:22:15] [Applause]
[1:22:18] it I know people try to make room for
[1:22:20] everybody but that ain't what we were
[1:22:22] called to do I ain't trying to be mean
[1:22:23] I'm just trying to be straight this
[1:22:24] morning we weren't called to do don't
[1:22:26] tell your children we're just going down
[1:22:27] there and fellowship with everybody else
[1:22:29] and just get all wrapped up and all that
[1:22:31] and it'll be okay they'll destroy your
[1:22:32] children they'll plant seeds they'll
[1:22:34] build images in their mind build up
[1:22:36] thoughts in their mind that they grow up
[1:22:38] well it ain't so bad after all cuz they
[1:22:40] do it nothing bad ever happens to them
[1:22:42] but they fail to recognize a living
[1:22:46] God it's contrary to the word of God
[1:22:49] said God never dealt one he never had
[1:22:52] one never dealt in one never dealt with
[1:22:53] one hello somebody wake up he never
[1:22:57] dealt with one he never dealt in one
[1:22:59] never had one but those who are
[1:23:01] electable hear the word of God and
[1:23:03] they'll come out of it you think of this
[1:23:05] age it's the age that's leosa that we're
[1:23:08] in blind and miserable and naked and
[1:23:12] don't even know it brother said that's
[1:23:14] what this church has constantly done
[1:23:16] Through the Ages she's left the word of
[1:23:18] God and taken her own Creeds she
[1:23:20] organized and joined herself to the
[1:23:22] world that she is naked and God is
[1:23:24] judging her lewdness the only way she
[1:23:27] can get out of this dread situation is
[1:23:29] obeying the Lord and coming back to his
[1:23:31] word that's what Revelations 18 said
[1:23:34] come out of her my people 2 Corinthians
[1:23:36] 6 he said be ye not unequally yolked
[1:23:38] together with unbelievers for what
[1:23:40] Fellowship hath righteous with
[1:23:41] unrighteousness what communion hath
[1:23:43] light with Darkness what corn uh Concord
[1:23:46] hath Christ with bow or what part ha he
[1:23:48] that believeth with an Infidel and what
[1:23:51] agreement hath the temple of God with
[1:23:53] idols that's the Bible but said for you
[1:23:58] are the Temple of the Living God as God
[1:24:00] has said I will dwell in them I will
[1:24:02] walk in them I will be their God and
[1:24:04] they shall be my people so come out from
[1:24:06] among them and be ye separate sayeth the
[1:24:08] Lord touch not the unclean thing and I
[1:24:11] will receive you and I will be a father
[1:24:13] unto you and you shall be my sons and
[1:24:14] daughters sayeth the Lord God Almighty
[1:24:18] see it's been built up as a big image of
[1:24:20] Christianity but you realize that no
[1:24:22] image will ever stand before the word of
[1:24:24] God no matter how beautiful it is it'll
[1:24:27] never stand in the place of God you know
[1:24:30] in the Old Testament I I'm I'm wrapping
[1:24:33] up here but in the Old Testament there
[1:24:35] was there was a great I'm starting to
[1:24:37] wrap up can I put it that way there was
[1:24:39] a great God in the Old Testament you
[1:24:41] know the uh the the the greatest two
[1:24:43] gods that were known in the Old
[1:24:44] Testament was Baal and deeon you studied
[1:24:47] the scripture they were the the the
[1:24:49] great many followers of millions of
[1:24:51] people deeon being the god of the
[1:24:53] Philistines remember whenever whenever
[1:24:55] Goliath went down into the field and he
[1:24:57] fought against David this was the gods
[1:24:59] that he called upon the Bible says he
[1:25:00] called upon his own Gods that he would
[1:25:03] come and deliver him and I thought isn't
[1:25:05] it something that he would call upon his
[1:25:07] gods and and here here little David
[1:25:08] would stand there he said how dare you
[1:25:10] defy the armies of the Living God while
[1:25:11] you're ain't nothing but an
[1:25:12] uncircumcised Philistine but the gods of
[1:25:16] of the Philistines were no match for the
[1:25:18] God for the god of of David and so you
[1:25:20] see as this this great Deon this great
[1:25:23] God deeon was a great fish God and he
[1:25:26] was he was known throughout all the
[1:25:27] lands of the Philistines he was the
[1:25:29] greatest of their gods but in the Bible
[1:25:31] there that you can find two stories that
[1:25:33] that really that really talk about this
[1:25:35] God and the the greatness that he was
[1:25:37] and and and and you see that that that
[1:25:39] how how much that he meant to those
[1:25:41] people and so you'll find that one day
[1:25:43] that there was a man by the name of
[1:25:44] Samson and know y'all know the story of
[1:25:46] Samson and how that Samson he had he had
[1:25:49] he had a vow with God and he had broken
[1:25:51] The Vow with God and remember he had
[1:25:53] laid in the lap of the Li and entertain
[1:25:55] these things and because of it he he had
[1:25:57] lost his strength and he had broken his
[1:25:58] vow and so the Bible says that they took
[1:26:00] Samson and they placed him in a temple
[1:26:03] and they and you realize that the temple
[1:26:05] they placed him in was the Temple of
[1:26:06] deeon it was their place of worship so
[1:26:08] they brought Samson and they placed him
[1:26:10] here and and they they brought him in
[1:26:12] there to make fun of him and mock him
[1:26:14] and here Samson was a great man of God
[1:26:16] he was a man that that was that was a
[1:26:19] that was so uh ordained of God and he
[1:26:21] had great strength and he had been such
[1:26:23] a he had been such a a a Warrior against
[1:26:27] the Philistines and and the and and and
[1:26:29] all the the Wrath that they had and so
[1:26:31] but whenever they took him and they
[1:26:32] brought him to this place this place of
[1:26:34] worship the Bible said like this it said
[1:26:36] the Lords of the Philistines gathered
[1:26:37] them together to offer a great sacrifice
[1:26:40] unto Deon their God and to Rejoice isn't
[1:26:42] it something that Samson the servant of
[1:26:45] God the man of God that they would bring
[1:26:47] him to dayone to offer as a sacrifice
[1:26:50] they were they were going to make sacri
[1:26:52] sacrifices to their God and and make
[1:26:54] sport of Samson and so because they had
[1:26:56] taken him they brought him before their
[1:26:58] God and to rejoice and they said our God
[1:27:00] ha delivered Samson our enemy into our
[1:27:02] hand and when the people saw him they
[1:27:05] praised their God and they said our God
[1:27:07] had delivered into our hands our enemy
[1:27:08] and the destroyer of our country which
[1:27:10] slew many of us and it came to pass when
[1:27:13] their hearts were merry they said call
[1:27:15] for Samson that he may come and let us
[1:27:17] make sport and they called Samson out of
[1:27:19] the prison house and he made them Sport
[1:27:21] and they set him between the pillars and
[1:27:23] Samson said unto unto the lad that led
[1:27:25] him Hand by hand he said suffer me that
[1:27:28] I may feel the pillars where this house
[1:27:29] stands that I may lean upon them see you
[1:27:32] realize this house it was filled with
[1:27:33] 3,000 Philistines that had gathered in
[1:27:35] this place here to come to worship this
[1:27:38] great God Deon for the victory that
[1:27:40] deeon had brought them over Samson the
[1:27:42] servant of God but said what a sad sight
[1:27:45] it was he said here you think of this
[1:27:47] this this picture of what was taking
[1:27:48] place it must have been a hot afternoon
[1:27:51] whenever here sson would come walking in
[1:27:53] the sun was shining down on this great
[1:27:55] Cathedral this celebration and these
[1:27:57] Philistines would look down from the
[1:27:59] galleries as the as Samson and this
[1:28:01] young lad would enter in here here here
[1:28:03] he's leading him like a dog into this
[1:28:05] place and here these high honored men of
[1:28:07] the Philistines that were that were
[1:28:09] coming to worship their great God he
[1:28:11] said what a sad sight to see them as
[1:28:13] they as they looked and leaned forward
[1:28:15] to get a good look at the boy that led
[1:28:17] the blind man and the Halls Echo with
[1:28:19] drunken rry and celebrating he said
[1:28:22] here's what hurts me is they were C
[1:28:24] celebrating the victory of their fish
[1:28:26] God Deon over Jehovah's servant this is
[1:28:29] what hurts is that they were celebrating
[1:28:31] the that this Idol that they were
[1:28:33] celebrating that they were worshiping
[1:28:35] saying that he had given them victory
[1:28:37] over a servant of God you realize that's
[1:28:39] what Satan's looking to do he's looking
[1:28:41] to have a celebration of a victory over
[1:28:44] the idol that has that has taken over
[1:28:46] every servant of God he said but you
[1:28:49] realize what a disgrace it was what a
[1:28:51] thing had happened the man had failed it
[1:28:54] wasn't God That Failed but his servant
[1:28:55] had
[1:28:56] failed and Jehovah he must have been
[1:28:58] thinking as he looked down to see all
[1:29:00] that was going on drunken conglomeration
[1:29:03] of women here they were half stripped
[1:29:05] down and fine jeweled and decorated and
[1:29:07] all fixed up watching this take place
[1:29:10] and in their their drunken husbands all
[1:29:12] drinking and celebrating to a god a fish
[1:29:14] God an idol that had took victory over
[1:29:17] Jehovah's
[1:29:18] servant what a sad sight it is to see an
[1:29:22] idol take victory over Jehovah's servant
[1:29:26] what a sad sight it is that a that an
[1:29:28] image would take victory over Jehovah's
[1:29:31] servant something that has been built up
[1:29:34] that that was built up by man that would
[1:29:36] take victory over a servant of Jehovah
[1:29:39] God you see you could imagine if God as
[1:29:41] God would look down on his servant that
[1:29:44] had been defeated the one that he had
[1:29:45] made a vow with here was a servant of
[1:29:47] the Lord and God he had made a promise
[1:29:49] to God and God had made a promise to him
[1:29:52] and for many years he kept the promise
[1:29:54] and and and he he done to be obedient to
[1:29:56] the Lord but he had
[1:29:58] failed and this great image that he had
[1:30:00] built up in his mind it was something
[1:30:02] may been something from days gone by and
[1:30:04] Years Gone by well it ain't you ain't
[1:30:05] going to go you can't go back to it but
[1:30:07] it was a great image that had taken
[1:30:09] victory over him people worshiping an
[1:30:12] idol for the victory that had given them
[1:30:14] and God watched the whole thing can you
[1:30:16] imagine God that made him God that gave
[1:30:18] you the power God that gave him the vow
[1:30:21] God that gave him the strength to be
[1:30:23] able to lead to be able to lead the the
[1:30:25] children of Israel as a judge against
[1:30:27] the Philistines he was a man of great
[1:30:28] strength that one day that he went down
[1:30:30] and slew a thousand with a Jawbone one
[1:30:32] day when they took him and they they put
[1:30:34] him in a city the Bible says he just
[1:30:36] took the gates of the city and ripped
[1:30:37] him up and carried him out of the way
[1:30:39] they couldn't they couldn't lock him up
[1:30:41] anywhere but he allowed something to
[1:30:43] come into his life and now they were
[1:30:45] worshiping a god an imaginated God a god
[1:30:50] of imagination that had taken victory
[1:30:53] over Samson I thought my can you imagine
[1:30:56] God sitting there and looking at this
[1:30:58] situation you know I I I think of it
[1:31:01] this way I think God if God ever sat on
[1:31:03] the edge of his seat he was sitting on
[1:31:05] the edge of his seat that day God was
[1:31:07] waiting for his servant to turn around
[1:31:11] he was waiting for him God being an
[1:31:13] eternal God and no doubt knowing how
[1:31:15] things would turn out but God was just
[1:31:16] waiting on the word of Samson to say
[1:31:19] Lord could you restore me one more time
[1:31:21] he's a God who is rich in Mercy he's the
[1:31:24] god of restoration he's the god that can
[1:31:26] take something that's broken he can put
[1:31:28] it back together again this is the god
[1:31:31] that that that had time in this
[1:31:32] condition and and God don't you think
[1:31:35] about God watching him God don't enjoy
[1:31:37] watching you struggle God don't enjoy
[1:31:40] watching you fail he don't enjoy
[1:31:42] watching you be made spoiled of by the
[1:31:44] devil he don't enjoy watching you be
[1:31:46] made fun of and poked out and blindness
[1:31:48] coming upon your life God don't enjoy
[1:31:49] watching his servy in that condition and
[1:31:52] God waited until fin finally here Samson
[1:31:54] stood in that place and something came
[1:31:56] and moving around him I think it was an
[1:31:58] angel of the Lord that went down to
[1:32:00] where he was and begin to minister to
[1:32:02] him that that it ain't over yet there's
[1:32:04] still breath in your body there's still
[1:32:06] a little bit of life if you'll call upon
[1:32:08] the name of the Lord he is just a hear
[1:32:10] you he'll forgive you he'll come and
[1:32:12] help you right
[1:32:13] now and Samson begin to cry out to God
[1:32:16] he called to the Lord Bible say he said
[1:32:18] Lord remember me I pray strengthen me
[1:32:20] just this once oh God that I may be
[1:32:23] Avenged of the Philistines from our two
[1:32:25] eyes and he took a hold of the two
[1:32:26] pillars upon the house where it stood
[1:32:29] and the one that was born up with his
[1:32:30] right and his left hand and Samson said
[1:32:32] Lord let me die with the
[1:32:34] Philistines and he bowed himself with
[1:32:36] all of his might and the house fell upon
[1:32:39] the Lord's and upon the people that were
[1:32:41] therein so the Deb which he slew at his
[1:32:43] death was more than he ever slew in his
[1:32:46] life see what looked like it would be a
[1:32:49] great defeat became his greatest Victory
[1:32:52] what looked like it' be greatest
[1:32:54] struggle it became his greatest Victory
[1:32:56] you say what brought the victory it's
[1:32:58] because he turned to the Lord oh my can
[1:33:00] you imagine hey they took out his eyes
[1:33:02] they didn't take out his ears can you
[1:33:04] imagine Samson sitting there and hearing
[1:33:06] the commotion of them going on and
[1:33:08] knowing his relationship with God and
[1:33:10] the things that he had seen God do and
[1:33:12] now he was hearing them sit and worship
[1:33:14] this son God or this this fish God de
[1:33:16] gon and oh de gon the great how you
[1:33:18] brought Sanson they gone the great how
[1:33:20] you brought victory over him they gone I
[1:33:21] imagine sanson's whole mind when he
[1:33:23] heard it went back to everything he had
[1:33:25] ever done or said that was wrong and say
[1:33:27] oh God how'd I ever get myself into that
[1:33:30] condition if I could go back and talk to
[1:33:31] me I'd talk me out of it I'd say Samson
[1:33:34] turn around and follow the word of the
[1:33:36] Lord and Lead this thing and let God be
[1:33:38] your lead let him be your
[1:33:41] guide the Bible says he slew them 3,000
[1:33:44] fell that day even when the men you
[1:33:47] think about it even when men fall the
[1:33:50] word of God remains true even when men
[1:33:53] fall but Jesus said Heaven and Earth
[1:33:55] will pass away but my word shall never
[1:33:57] pass away men will fall but the word
[1:33:59] will never fall listen what Samson
[1:34:01] prayed for he prayed for a restoration
[1:34:03] of The Vow that he had with God it was
[1:34:06] the it was it was the it was the very
[1:34:08] thing that he had made you realize that
[1:34:09] this vow this vow was a covenant that
[1:34:11] God had made with him how many knows
[1:34:13] what what a Nazarite vow was a Nazarite
[1:34:15] vow a Nazarite is one that is
[1:34:17] consecrated for a purpose and here's
[1:34:20] what brother bam said he said see Samson
[1:34:21] was consecrated to an age and to a
[1:34:24] purpose so therefore he let his hair
[1:34:25] grow out long remember when he finally
[1:34:27] told the lia the secret he had that long
[1:34:29] curly hair hanging down them locks kind
[1:34:31] probably looked like Xavier over there
[1:34:33] had that hair just along long and
[1:34:34] hanging around but he but he had them
[1:34:36] locks hanging but it was it was the
[1:34:37] Nazarite bow that God had made with him
[1:34:40] and finally when he told Delilah The
[1:34:42] Secret of it that she took the scissors
[1:34:43] and cut it off and he lost his vow with
[1:34:46] God and remember said see every child of
[1:34:49] Abraham is a Nazarite with a vow from
[1:34:51] God swore by himself so it ain't just
[1:34:54] Samson it's every one of us that are
[1:34:56] Abraham's seed so if you're how means
[1:34:58] Abraham's seed if you're Abraham's seed
[1:35:00] then you have a vow with God and if you
[1:35:02] have a vow with God then you've been
[1:35:04] consecrated for a purpose you say well
[1:35:06] what's the purpose it was to take the
[1:35:08] Covenant which is the word of God it was
[1:35:11] it was to separate oursel from the world
[1:35:13] it's the Covenant that God has made with
[1:35:15] us therefore it may not be the very same
[1:35:17] thing as Samson in the Old Testament but
[1:35:19] God has given us an order of how we look
[1:35:22] we don't we don't look like the world
[1:35:23] that's when you look at the church today
[1:35:25] the church don't look like the world it
[1:35:27] don't dress like the world it don't act
[1:35:29] like the world let me tell you friends
[1:35:30] what we were made to do was proved to
[1:35:32] the world that that that that the life
[1:35:35] that you live that there is a race of
[1:35:37] people that can overcome the pressures
[1:35:38] of the age that we live in you're made
[1:35:41] to prove to the world that there's a
[1:35:44] super race I'm not talking about the
[1:35:45] color of a person's skin I'm talking
[1:35:47] about the race that Peter was talking
[1:35:49] about he he said you're a chosen
[1:35:51] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[1:35:53] Nation A peculiar people that you should
[1:35:56] show forth the Praises of him that has
[1:35:57] called you out of Darkness into this

[1:36:02] not a people but you're now the people
[1:36:04] of God there was a time when you hadn't
[1:36:06] obtained Mercy but now you have obtained
[1:36:08] Mercy You're A peculiar people that's
[1:36:10] been called out of the world but let me
[1:36:12] tell you friends even greater than that
[1:36:15] not only were you called out of the
[1:36:16] world Cody but the world has been called
[1:36:18] out of you God called it out of you it
[1:36:21] wasn't to remain in you when he called
[1:36:23] you out of world he called the world out
[1:36:24] of you do you realize that the very
[1:36:26] thing that had power over you has been
[1:36:28] called out it don't matter what it is
[1:36:30] whenever you were in this world the
[1:36:32] demon of lust has been called out of you
[1:36:34] the the the the demon of adultery has
[1:36:36] been called out of you the spirit the
[1:36:39] spirit that that would cause a man to

[1:36:51] but the world has been called out of you
[1:36:54] many are Waring today there there's a
[1:36:56] great battle that is going on within
[1:36:59] there's a great struggle can I finish
[1:37:01] just here I'm about to close a great
[1:37:04] struggle you think of this all this this
[1:37:06] shaking that is going on in the in the
[1:37:09] life of a human being if you could if
[1:37:11] you could see friends you'd have a lot
[1:37:12] more grace on people if you could look
[1:37:14] into the into the heart of a man see
[1:37:17] what he's struggling with and the things
[1:37:20] that that are in his life that he didn't
[1:37:22] put there you know May came from history
[1:37:24] or may have been handed down from from
[1:37:26] Generations it may be it was outside
[1:37:28] influences and things but all these
[1:37:30] things that are in our lives and so you
[1:37:32] have a little bit of Grace for people
[1:37:33] because you realize they're war and
[1:37:34] there's a great battle a lot of things
[1:37:36] that are that are quaking within us they
[1:37:39] struggle say what's this struggle All
[1:37:41] About You think because in this struggle
[1:37:44] there have been great gods that have
[1:37:45] been built up in them men have done so
[1:37:48] many things they built images in our
[1:37:50] mind that become Gods to us great things
[1:37:52] they take men and they make God out of
[1:37:54] them they take churches and they make
[1:37:56] Gods out of them they take they take
[1:37:58] pastors and make Gods out of them and
[1:38:00] when they build up and then when the men
[1:38:02] fall then the people are left without
[1:38:04] when the church falls the people are
[1:38:06] left scattered when the when the men go
[1:38:08] they're left scattered because they put
[1:38:10] up an image between them and God but do
[1:38:12] you realize that God called that there
[1:38:14] would be nothing between you and him
[1:38:16] there' be there's no man that's between
[1:38:18] you and God except Jesus Christ who is
[1:38:20] God he he he was made he made a way that
[1:38:23] every person person that every believer
[1:38:25] that every one of us that we would have
[1:38:27] access to God we don't have to go to a
[1:38:29] priest and confess our sins and and
[1:38:31] confess our faults in some confession
[1:38:33] booth and ask for somebody to pay away
[1:38:35] that you can have access to God and you
[1:38:37] can take the poorest woman in the church
[1:38:39] and she can kneel down in her bedroom
[1:38:41] closet and the same God that would come
[1:38:43] down in the in the house of God will
[1:38:45] meet her right in her prayer
[1:38:47] closet you don't have to be some great
[1:38:49] man or great wealth to meet with God say
[1:38:52] see he he there there they built up
[1:38:54] these images but just because you think
[1:38:56] about it just because it was formed in
[1:38:58] the image of a God don't mean that it
[1:38:59] has the power of
[1:39:01] God many images have been built up
[1:39:04] people are living under the power you
[1:39:06] think of this I want you to catch this
[1:39:09] this morning people live under the power
[1:39:12] of an image that they have built by
[1:39:15] their own
[1:39:16] imagination they're living under a
[1:39:19] struggle that's been built by
[1:39:21] imagination you think about what happens
[1:39:24] any of you that's recently gave your
[1:39:26] heart to the Lord and some of you been a
[1:39:27] long time you may still remember it but
[1:39:29] you remember when you when you first
[1:39:30] come and and every you want to give
[1:39:32] everything to the Lord you begin to make
[1:39:34] things right and you go home and you go
[1:39:36] home at night you know what the devil
[1:39:38] does how many testify of this but
[1:39:40] whenever he comes by he'll say but you
[1:39:42] can't ever live that anyway how many
[1:39:45] testify to that am I the only person
[1:39:46] devil ever y'all raise your hand High
[1:39:48] everybody thank you you know why cuz he
[1:39:50] does it to everybody so whenever you get
[1:39:53] alone and say well you couldn't ever be
[1:39:55] a Christian anyway after all what you
[1:39:57] did was way worse than what anybody else
[1:39:59] ever
[1:40:02] did you know matter of fact you know God
[1:40:06] May forgive you but the people won't
[1:40:09] ever I don't know how you can go
[1:40:10] Fellowship there because they know you
[1:40:12] they know everything you done you can't
[1:40:14] hide that they'll all they're always
[1:40:15] that's always going to be there this is
[1:40:17] the devil talking to build up an
[1:40:20] image that come from the imagination of
[1:40:23] of men think of this sitting there in in
[1:40:25] our own
[1:40:27] imagination you'll build a reason why
[1:40:29] you can't go to church and in your own
[1:40:31] imagination you'll build a reason why
[1:40:33] you can't serve God in your own
[1:40:35] imagination you'll build a reason why
[1:40:37] why you're not the bride and why you
[1:40:38] can't go in a Rapture and why you can't
[1:40:40] believe the message in your own
[1:40:41] imagination you'll build a something
[1:40:43] that'll stop you from being able to
[1:40:45] serve the Lord this is the Great War
[1:40:47] struggle that's going on see you realize
[1:40:51] that they're living under this power
[1:40:52] these images that they've allowed to be
[1:40:54] built up many things get between you and
[1:40:57] God many great things that we build up
[1:41:00] we make Gods out of them butam said you
[1:41:02] can make somebody a God you can make
[1:41:04] anything a God you can build anything up
[1:41:07] to be your God to be what you serve it
[1:41:10] could be jobs houses it could be cars it
[1:41:13] could be people it could be Idols it
[1:41:15] could be things it could be thoughts it
[1:41:17] don't matter what it is it can become a
[1:41:19] God it'll take your time the time that
[1:41:22] you should devote to the Lord it'll rob
[1:41:23] you of all your time it'll rob you of
[1:41:25] all the all the the the the devotion
[1:41:28] it'll rob you it'll rob you of being
[1:41:30] able to worship God and you realize that
[1:41:32] these things has been built up but they
[1:41:35] they become Gods but see there's a
[1:41:37] difference between what a God is and
[1:41:40] what God is can I just finish with this
[1:41:44] see the Bible tells us in John the first
[1:41:45] chapter in the beginning was the word
[1:41:47] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:41:48] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:41:50] dwelt among us and we beheld him the
[1:41:53] only gotten father full of grace but in
[1:41:55] the Old Testament when you read that in
[1:41:56] the beginning God it uses a different
[1:41:59] word you ever notice that in the Old
[1:42:01] Testament we preached a whole series on
[1:42:02] on the word Elohim in the Old Testament
[1:42:05] it was in the beginning Elohim see
[1:42:06] Elohim means the self-existing one and
[1:42:09] there's a great difference between the
[1:42:11] word Elohim and the word that we use for
[1:42:13] God see our God means an object of
[1:42:16] worship but Elohim means a self-existing
[1:42:18] one so anybody can take something and
[1:42:20] make a God out of it but brother said
[1:42:22] but notice that difference but in the
[1:42:24] beginning there was God the
[1:42:25] self-existing one he says so you can
[1:42:27] make a God out of anything but it can
[1:42:29] never be self-existent you could worship
[1:42:31] that piano but the piano can't create
[1:42:33] itself that you could worship the uh
[1:42:35] this pull pit but the pull pit is not
[1:42:37] self-existent you could worship another
[1:42:39] man but the man is not self-existent it
[1:42:42] had to be created by something but
[1:42:44] Elohim the Bible said but in the
[1:42:46] beginning Elohim that's our God in the
[1:42:49] beginning Elohim the self-existing one
[1:42:51] the only thing that there ever was that
[1:42:53] never had a Creator the only thing that
[1:42:56] ever was that is beyond our
[1:42:58] understanding with this created human
[1:42:59] mind that we have the self-existing one
[1:43:03] he said we can't be self-existing we
[1:43:05] can't be Almighty we can't be omnipotent
[1:43:07] or omnipresent or omnicient Elohim
[1:43:10] expresses all of that we cannot be that
[1:43:13] the tree that you make a God out of or
[1:43:15] the building you make a God out of it is
[1:43:17] not self-existing so whenever God
[1:43:20] created in the beginning the Bible said
[1:43:22] in the beginning Elohim
[1:43:23] created the Heaven and the Earth he said
[1:43:26] what when the attribute of Elohim you
[1:43:27] think about it when the attribute of
[1:43:29] Elohim which was called the Holy Ghost
[1:43:31] the person of Jesus Christ see these are
[1:43:33] attributes of God Father and Son and
[1:43:35] Holy Ghost it's the attributes of God
[1:43:37] and when that attribute called the Holy
[1:43:39] Ghost the attribute called the person of
[1:43:42] Jesus Christ the word of God Finds Its
[1:43:44] place in the soul of a man it'll shatter
[1:43:46] every image of any God that you have
[1:43:49] ever built up let me tell you Friends
[1:43:51] when the word of God comes into a temple
[1:43:53] it'll Shadow the it'll Shadow the image
[1:43:56] of any God that's been built oh there
[1:43:58] was there was a time as the music
[1:43:59] players get ready there was a time in
[1:44:01] the Old Testament the Bible said that
[1:44:03] Israel had gone down into battle and
[1:44:05] because of her condition she had fallen
[1:44:08] in battle you remember this when she
[1:44:10] fell in battle the Philistines heard
[1:44:12] that there was a great there was a great
[1:44:14] Roar in the camp of the Israelites and
[1:44:16] the philistin said well what's going on
[1:44:18] they said well the Ark of the Lord has
[1:44:20] came onto the battlefield and fear
[1:44:22] struck the Philistines and and when fear
[1:44:24] struck them they they begin to cry out
[1:44:27] well we we can't do nothing now this is
[1:44:29] the gods listen how they said it God's
[1:44:31] plural because that's the only thing
[1:44:33] they knew this is the gods that
[1:44:35] delivered them out of Egypt this is the
[1:44:37] gods that brought them over the Red Sea
[1:44:39] this is the gods that has slain every
[1:44:41] city before them and finally some
[1:44:43] Philistines stood up he said well they
[1:44:45] ain't but they fell before us it ain't
[1:44:47] going to stop them now let's go destroy
[1:44:49] them anyhow and they got up enough
[1:44:50] courage that they went down in the
[1:44:51] battlefield Samson was a young man a
[1:44:54] young Prophet at the time or Samuel but
[1:44:57] you know when they went in the
[1:44:57] battlefield guess what happened they
[1:44:59] slew the Israelites they destroyed them
[1:45:03] everyone that stayed in battle they lost
[1:45:04] their life or fled from it and the
[1:45:06] Philistines they got they got them a
[1:45:08] trophy they took a looked around and
[1:45:11] said my it wasn't that great after all
[1:45:14] Bible says they picked up these Great
[1:45:15] Men of the Philistines they picked up
[1:45:17] that great Ark of the Covenant that was
[1:45:19] built the same one that walked across
[1:45:21] the Red Sea and that Phil army they
[1:45:23] lifted it above their heads they went
[1:45:26] back into town in ashod and said we've
[1:45:28] had victory over the gods of Israel you
[1:45:32] know what they did Brother David they
[1:45:33] took that they took that that that Arc
[1:45:36] of the Covenant and they took the those
[1:45:38] Commandments of God which was the top of
[1:45:41] the word and they took that Ark and they
[1:45:44] took it down into the Temple of
[1:45:46] deeon and they set it down in there you
[1:45:49] know where they put it they put it right
[1:45:50] by the great image of the great fish God
[1:45:52] d
[1:45:53] gone the Bible said they come in they're
[1:45:56] they're going to have a good worship
[1:45:57] over it they went to having a party and
[1:45:59] they took the they took the Ark of God
[1:46:01] and they laid it in there and set it by
[1:46:02] day gone and when the when the men of
[1:46:04] ashot arose early in the next morning
[1:46:07] the Bible says they went down into the
[1:46:08] temple and deeon was falling on his face
[1:46:12] before the Ark of the
[1:46:13] Lord and you know what the men did they
[1:46:16] took Deon Glory they took Deon and they
[1:46:19] set him back up again they I don't know
[1:46:22] what happened happened to our God I
[1:46:24] thought isn't it something that the
[1:46:26] Bible said he was laying on his face
[1:46:28] before the Ark of the Lord so they set
[1:46:30] him back up and said well I don't know
[1:46:32] what's going on here they set him back
[1:46:34] up they went back next day the Bible
[1:46:36] said they rose up early in the morning
[1:46:38] and deeon was falling on his face to the
[1:46:40] ground before the ark and the head of
[1:46:42] deeon and both of his palms of his hands
[1:46:44] were cut off and the only thing left was
[1:46:47] a
[1:46:49] stump the Ark of the Lord entered into
[1:46:52] the temple
[1:46:53] right and the image of Deon fell you
[1:46:56] know you can only prop it up so glory to
[1:46:58] God I done I'm I'm already out of time
[1:47:00] but you can only prop it up so long
[1:47:02] before God will just take it down to
[1:47:04] nothing you can you can take an image
[1:47:06] that's been built up when the word of
[1:47:07] the Lord enters into a temple it don't
[1:47:09] matter what the image was it's going to
[1:47:12] fall and you can prop it up today you
[1:47:14] can come back tomorrow and you can prop
[1:47:16] it back up and God can knock it down you
[1:47:18] can come back next week and you can go
[1:47:19] right back into the same thing and you
[1:47:21] can pop it up and God will knock it down
[1:47:23] but one morning you'll come in and
[1:47:25] you'll find it with its head cut off and
[1:47:27] it won't have the hands to hold on to
[1:47:28] you any longer and it'll be nothing but
[1:47:30] a stum in a memory of a image a
[1:47:33] shattered image that remains in your
[1:47:35] life when the go word of God enters in
[1:47:39] it'll make his way every image will fall
[1:47:42] you think when the true word of God
[1:47:44] comes in contact with some man-made
[1:47:46] image it don't matter what it is the
[1:47:47] word of God will always Prevail won't
[1:47:49] you stand to your feet this morning
[1:47:51] it'll Prevail you realize you say how
[1:47:53] was it Prevail because it's the life
[1:47:55] that is in the word that prevails over
[1:47:57] all things and the life that see our God
[1:48:00] is not a dead God it's a living God so
[1:48:02] the word that's entering into you it
[1:48:04] ain't some dead thing it's a living
[1:48:05] thing if you could ever catch the
[1:48:07] revelation of it it's something that is
[1:48:09] moving on the inside of you it's a
[1:48:11] spirit it's not just an imagination and
[1:48:13] this spirit that is dealing with things
[1:48:14] in your life it's cutting them away and
[1:48:17] it's shattering every image that you
[1:48:18] built up every image of legalism it gets
[1:48:21] cut out every every image of following
[1:48:23] after men it gets cut out every image of
[1:48:26] a denomination is cut out every image of
[1:48:28] sin and spirits and demons it gets cut
[1:48:31] out because it can't stand before the
[1:48:35] word of God says see that what it is
[1:48:38] it's the life of God and that life
[1:48:41] becomes a token unto you that whenever
[1:48:44] that image raises up don't think you
[1:48:46] don't raise up his ugly head I know some
[1:48:48] of you sitting here this morning maybe
[1:48:51] you I mean barely even come to church
[1:48:54] some people they barely they're barely
[1:48:55] even here I'm glad you're here it's a
[1:48:57] good place to
[1:48:58] start but there's more to it than just
[1:49:00] coming to
[1:49:02] church you these things that's been
[1:49:03] built up in our lives there comes a time
[1:49:05] when you say enough's enough and I'm not
[1:49:07] going to let this thing destroy me
[1:49:10] enough enough I built it up as a great
[1:49:11] image that I'll never be able to
[1:49:13] overcome it and it's just a part of my
[1:49:14] nature and I can't get past it but it
[1:49:16] comes a time when enough is
[1:49:18] enough and enough word will come in you
[1:49:21] see why it's important to go to church
[1:49:23] it's important to hear the word of God
[1:49:25] it's important to listen to the message
[1:49:26] when enough word gets in there the enemy
[1:49:28] can't have no place that life and then
[1:49:31] when he raises up his ugly head You' got
[1:49:33] a token something that you can display
[1:49:35] over him and say behold it the life that
[1:49:37] was in the word that was in the blood it
[1:49:39] paid the sacrifice was made and it's
[1:49:41] over you and you can hold it over him
[1:49:43] brother B said see the life that life he
[1:49:45] said we identify ourselves in his death
[1:49:47] burial and Resurrection by Believing on
[1:49:48] him and being baptized unto his death
[1:49:51] burial and resurrection and and when we
[1:49:53] rise up the holy spirit is there to give

[1:50:30] over every sickness there's a God you
[1:50:33] can hold over every failure every
[1:50:35] problem every Spirit that's unlike God
[1:50:37] if you could get a hold of him this
[1:50:39] morning there's a God that you could
[1:50:41] that you could hold over and today it be
[1:50:42] the last day that you ever had that
[1:50:44] image raised up in your life he said
[1:50:47] your unchanging faith pulsates it and it
[1:50:50] forms it your faith forms it what is
[1:50:54] this God that's entered into you he said
[1:50:56] your faith forms it a form of Jesus
[1:50:59] Christ the image that you're walking in
[1:51:03] today take a hold of the faith of the
[1:51:06] word of God and let the image of God be

[1:51:33] becomes the greatest problem and the joy
[1:51:35] of coming to church and serving the lord
[1:51:37] it goes by the wayside CU all these
[1:51:39] things has been built up in our life and

[1:51:43] God maybe be sicknesses it may be
[1:51:45] something in your body maybe whatever it
[1:51:48] is that would cause
[1:51:50] us something to be built up

[1:51:57] shatter every
[1:51:59] image maybe you have a need this morning
[1:52:01] you say brother Matt I pray you'd

[1:52:56] Christianity you spent years under under
[1:52:59] men and built an image of what a real
[1:53:01] Christian really is and it ain't got
[1:53:03] nothing to do with
[1:53:05] it nature is a hard nature and harsh to
[1:53:08] one another and bitter and that's not
[1:53:11] that's not the the nature of Jesus
[1:53:13] Christ friends I don't believe that that
[1:53:16] you can be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:53:18] and that it don't have the power to take
[1:53:20] that old nature out of you I believe it
[1:53:21] does
[1:53:23] I believe that the things that you carry
[1:53:24] and the things that was put in your life
[1:53:26] I believe that the Holy Ghost has the
[1:53:27] power to change a person's nature you
[1:53:30] know why cuz I've seen too many people
[1:53:31] that their nature was changed I believe
[1:53:33] he has the power to do it if you have
