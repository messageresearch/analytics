I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. He says, "Be not conformed to this world, but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is good and acceptable and perfect will of God." Heavenly Father, I want to thank you this morning for allowing us to be here. Ask you to bless the church at home this morning. God, I pray that you'd be with Brother Kanan, Lord, as as he endeavors to speak there, Father. I pray you'll be with them. But Lord, this morning I just look I ask you to be with us this morning, God. Help us, Father, that you'll just bless the service and bless brother Matt and bless the services here, Father. Lord, just Lord, the fruit of it has been wonderful, Father. Ask you Lord that you'll just be merciful in Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated this morning. Amen. I want to take a little while. He says, "Now I want you to be transformed by the by the renewing of your mind." Now, I want to talk to you this morning maybe a little transform in life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I begin to think of this this morning. Amen. And last night. And and I thought, you know, you know, and I'd like to take that thought, the life that's within itself. &gt;&gt; The life that's within itself. Because the thing about it is, you know, you're not nothing is going to come forth unless there's something in it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And I so I began to look at that last night and I thought, you know, Amen. According to the prophet of God, you know, he says, "Now, you know, when brother man began to deal with the seed life, Amen. And he and he began to tell us about how that the seed amen was put there. But the seed would be just as useless as useless could be if it had not life within itself. &gt;&gt; See the thing about it is when the life was in itself, amen. So I don't care what you plant, it's not manifested at that time. Amen. So but the thing about it is is when that life that's in it, it produces itself unto Amen. It brings identification of itself. Didn't you say amen? It's not identifying something else. And that's the reason, Amen. A lot of time we're coming to an identification of the seed. Amen. That life was in itself. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the thing about it is, Amen. It's not something that just happened. It's something that's actually in there that transformed that it actually, Amen. begins to see what it really was. Now, I don't care how how good you put it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can put it in good ground. Amen. As the Bible says, but the thing about it is if there's not life within itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that life in it didn't just come when you put it in the ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. The life had to come from some Amen. some source. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it could identify itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care how good you can sing. I don't care how good you can preach. Amen. You've got to have a life to identify. Amen. Where you come from or who you are. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And I thought, you know, as the prophet of God says, Amen. He says that when he puts a seed in the earth, this the seed can only come with the life that's within it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, we used to when we planted a garden or so forth back back in the day and and so when you put the uh your seed there back in the day, you would put the package at the end of the row to let you know &gt;&gt; what you put in there. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll let you know what you put in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because after a while, it all the ground just looked like Amen. It was Amen. been fixed to grow something. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So after a while, Amen. What happens was Amen. something of that life begins to bust through the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. It begin to bust through the earth, but it's strictly not yet identified. &gt;&gt; It's really not yet identified. Amen. To be who it's supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And so therefore, Amen. You know, it's like brother Pam says, Amen. He says, now he puts it there with a power. &gt;&gt; See, Amen. There's a power within himself to break forth. Amen. Every obstacle, Amen. that he has to get through to get to identification. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Amen." So somebody says, "Oh, I'd like to be this." Amen. You're going to you're you're not going to ever be anything that what you already are. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I don't care if them monkeys think that there this guy's going to be a woman or this woman's going to be a man. the identification of the power of life that it's a boy. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says now he puts that there I don't never have to worry about being bride. &gt;&gt; Why? The power of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Of this bride is there. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It comes to a station or a time that it could identify who it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Am I by myself? &gt;&gt; Well, is it the truth? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, after a while, Amen. We call ourselves message believers. &gt;&gt; We call ourselves bride. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But after a while, &gt;&gt; Amen. If we plant radishes. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; All right. We got a radish package &gt;&gt; at the end of the row. But you don't know if they gonna come up or not. &gt;&gt; Now, every seed in this package is not necessarily got life. &gt;&gt; Y'all Hey, &gt;&gt; I can go home. He already got paid. Every seed in here may not have life. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; If you ever planted a garden, you know that. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know what? But you still plant it with potentials. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because you don't know who he is and who's not. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God says, &gt;&gt; I put it there with potentials. &gt;&gt; Amen. to bring what it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not something to be transformed to something else. &gt;&gt; But I want something of myself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason brother Bon said Jesus wanted children of himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He don't want Amen. He don't want Satan's kids. &gt;&gt; He wants children of himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So he had to have a bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He had to have a woman. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he says, "Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to put it here with the potentials." &gt;&gt; And there's a power in that seed. &gt;&gt; That p in that in that seed, there's such a power of life, it'll tear that ground off. Come on. &gt;&gt; It'll tear that ground up. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go on home. &gt;&gt; It'll tear that life up. &gt;&gt; It'll tear this body up. It'll transform like it's never been transformed before. [applause] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See? Amen. What's in there, it's going to tear out after a while. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Why?" It's a power in itself. &gt;&gt; Because of the life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Last night I had half gallon water jugs. Ain't got nothing this morning. [laughter] Has anybody got any water in there? See, everybody jumps up. It's a little late, ain't it? I got you back on my terms now. Thank you, buddy. And you're a good guy. You even opened it. Listen to this. See, a lot of time we say, you know, we look around and we see people leaving. No, they wasn't part of the life &gt;&gt; of the seed. and they can't help it. &gt;&gt; You know, you ever plant corn, you know, and I'm not talking about big, but you know, you plant corn and you plant that row of corn and sometimes you got a heel here, but you got one way over here. You got one over here, but you still planted corn, but there was no life. The life was an innness, but it looked just like it. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; It's out of the same package. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But it was no life in this one &gt;&gt; to bust through the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't nothing in here. &gt;&gt; It wasn't life to reproduce &gt;&gt; another stalk of corn. &gt;&gt; That's the reason God had to elect. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He had to elect something and put a life in it &gt;&gt; that it could bust forth through all kind of trials. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All kind of heartaches. &gt;&gt; Because it had a power &gt;&gt; in itself &gt;&gt; to bring forth &gt;&gt; to show [screaming] who it was. [applause] &gt;&gt; Huh? See, I never had the power of life to be a Brandham. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Or or a glover. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there was a power of life in me &gt;&gt; that I came forth &gt;&gt; to identify the longorous s &gt;&gt; that make sense to you sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. See because amen when that baby come forth it had a power of life &gt;&gt; within itself. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. It started kicking, hollering, screaming, all this kind of stuff. He wanted to put it back in there right then. But he he couldn't. &gt;&gt; But he had a power of life within itself. &gt;&gt; Huh? And so what it does, it starts Amen. starts moving &gt;&gt; or starts Amen. nursing. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To peel the life that's in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch what he says. He said, "Now watch it." He said now it can only bring forth the power of life that's within it. Amen. That's within it to transform itself. &gt;&gt; I don't have to have Andrew. Amen. To transform &gt;&gt; the life. &gt;&gt; I hear what is he doing? He waters, &gt;&gt; but he'll never bring forth &gt;&gt; the life, &gt;&gt; but he can water it. He can fertile it &gt;&gt; but he can't bring life. &gt;&gt; And it can't bring life when there's no life to be brought. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason. Amen. Brother said there's nothing. Denomination system is still born. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's still born. There's no life there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The ground was prepared. Everything was Amen. Everything was uh uh uh ministered like it's supposed to be, but there was nothing in there. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; That's the reason when David saw the ark coming, &gt;&gt; he got so excited, &gt;&gt; he got to dancing, &gt;&gt; but the church &gt;&gt; got all uptight about it. &gt;&gt; His wife began to get ugly. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because the word was coming. life was coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she had a dead womb. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that church cannot reproduce itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because but they look good. &gt;&gt; They talk good &gt;&gt; but there was no power of life within itself. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so the thing about is brother B said he's put in there we're potentials. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the word potentials means having the capacity to become something or develop something in the future. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it wasn't bride in the first age. &gt;&gt; It was sort of making it. Right. &gt;&gt; But he came all the way down. You say, "We have, but brother said, bride, bride all through the ages." Yeah, but she couldn't be full bride until this last day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She couldn't manifest herself. She went into the ground. But now there's now God planted a seed with potentials. &gt;&gt; Amen. To &gt;&gt; to uh Amen. develop in the future of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You say amen. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Brother man said he said look whatever Amen. Amen. Whatever it was the transforming power that God put the in the seed &gt;&gt; God put in the seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To Amen. with the power to transform itself into the body or the bride of Jesus Christ. And it's not you making it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, brother Brandon was actually like this like the the package. He put the package at the end of the row &gt;&gt; and he said this is this this will be a bride. That's good. &gt;&gt; This will be a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he put the package. Amen. And so we saw Amen. all of this struggling through time. &gt;&gt; All of it struggled. &gt;&gt; It went through drafts. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Went through storms. &gt;&gt; Amen. All through time. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was it doing? Struggling. &gt;&gt; Amen. But life was in it. Life was in it &gt;&gt; during the struggle. Life was in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. As a Amen. As the time went on and the right sun, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Begin to bail down on it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when that sun begin to draw, &gt;&gt; the earth begin to quiver. &gt;&gt; Amen. Something begin to happen on the inside because the sun begin to draw &gt;&gt; the life &gt;&gt; that's in the seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say amen. &gt;&gt; It's wonderful there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, you know, God's got it already fixed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And so the prophet of God says, "Amen." So, he's not going back down here and saying, "Well, I'm going to try to pick up brother so and so, sister so and so, and I'm going to try to make them bright." &gt;&gt; That ain't happening. &gt;&gt; That ain't happening. And why you're so happy today. &gt;&gt; Amen. With what the revelation is because you have busted through the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have busted through this earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now you begin to see &gt;&gt; what the word of God's all about. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, we come from everything. Hey, I was born a Roman Catholic. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then I got in amongst the my mama got us into the Protestants. Amen. Then I got to the I went to the Ostein move. I baptized you night of Pentecost. Woo Jesus. &gt;&gt; But see that couldn't bring me to life. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; But one day, &gt;&gt; the sun went over the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. That there was a life. &gt;&gt; Amen. They've been placed with a power of life within itself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when the word spoke, &gt;&gt; something began to happen. &gt;&gt; Hey, somebody said, "Well, I've been trying to quit this." Uhuh. When life begin to break forth, &gt;&gt; something begin to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when that son, the sen comes over and he breaks the earth. &gt;&gt; He'll let you come through there &gt;&gt; and he's pulling the life out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, you can throw the package away. &gt;&gt; Now it's it's Amen. Now it's that identification. Come on. &gt;&gt; Now we've come to identification. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's radishes. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's cucumbers. &gt;&gt; How'd you know that? &gt;&gt; It's life identification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cucumbers didn't come up in the playh in a place of reddishes. &gt;&gt; We didn't come up Luther. &gt;&gt; We didn't come up west. &gt;&gt; We didn't even come up Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We come up in the hour to reflect or to identify the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You say amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, I've been trying to quit this." You know, when an eagle, you know, when an eagle gets a It's about the hottest place I ever been up here. [laughter] No fan nowhere.

You was out here now you're here. &gt;&gt; And and as as you have you matured now you begin to be identified. You begin to become an identified of who you are, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who are you? That robe of flesh that you've been wearing for 30, 40, 50 years is &gt;&gt; Mr. Robin W. &gt;&gt; But you fixing to be identified. The package of the world is going to see who you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because brother Ram said, "Amen. Things that ought to be." He said, "One day he'll display this bride to the world." So, Amen. The package is not no longer at the end of the row. Now, the row has been made manifest. Stand your feet with us.

One day you'll identify yourself, what you really are. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, the thing about is I thinking about this morning, how much God's given people talent to do things that's not even ordained of God. But your talent has been blessed. We've been blessed with it. But this morning, you may not be able to carry a tune in a bucket. Me, too. But you know what? You've been identified at the end of the row. Amen. I don't know who he is, but I'd sure like to be like that. Amen. What is it? Identification. God showing the world. Did he say it? Yeah, he said it. He said, "I want a display." My brother said, "He'll display to the world." That ain't in the millennium. &gt;&gt; That ain't in heaven. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's over here in the back woods of wherever we at. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Back in these woods. &gt;&gt; He's got some place to identify [music] the people. &gt;&gt; Push back in the corner. Push back out here. But he's got a people that's going to identify. I'm going to display them people. &gt;&gt; How's he going to do that? None yet. None your business. But I'm going to display her &gt;&gt; cuz a prophet of God left his word. You know, prophet of God could leave us and never worry about us &gt;&gt; because he knew what was planted. [singing] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Oh, somebody help me. I got to stay down." No, I done stored up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I done stored up food. &gt;&gt; And you know what? I showed him at the end of the road, spoke the words, original seed.

When you when you start getting age, Amen. things starts changing. Look at him. He's whiteheaded. Didn't help his looks, [laughter] &gt;&gt; but there's been a change, right? [music] He's changed into a maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like brother Ram said, that oak like that old oak tree, you go get center of the shade of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we're coming to that time that brother R said, I already done it. Now I can slip off the scene. Because he said, now this has become a pest house. &gt;&gt; Now I want to step out of here. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he said, "I already put it at the end of the row." &gt;&gt; Already planted at the end of the row. I stored it up. Now there's going to be a matt Mars. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; He's going to come. Oh, he's went through a lot of battles, but still been corn. &gt;&gt; Still corn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this morning, Amen. Look at your identification this morning. Amen. Of who you really are. God's identifying. God's identifying that bride now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Unbelievers has started to jump off &gt;&gt; as we pierce the sun to our headship. Bugs starts getting off of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we get there. Brother said be just very few cuz all this road that was planted just a few hills come up. One here, one Alabama, one Georgia. Why? But it's all planted. It's all planted. Just a few came up. Amen.

Nobody loves &gt;&gt; Amen. like he loves to hear his people say, "I love you." Hallelujah. Do you know that brother Benham taught me that I am Jesus's victory? When he looks at me and I'm in my struggle, he says he's a man after my own heart. He's in a struggle, &gt;&gt; but he's a man after my heart. &gt;&gt; I see him in a battle. Amen. But I see him lifting up in the night time, raising his hands and said, "Lord, I want to love you more than I ever loved you before. And we sing that song victory in Jesus. &gt;&gt; But Jesus sings it victory. &gt;&gt; Come over here. &gt;&gt; When David was dancing, his wife was all beside herself. Brother said, "Jesus, God looked out there and he said, "God, he's a man after my own heart. &gt;&gt; He's acting a crazy. He's acting wild. &gt;&gt; He said, "I can just feel him. &gt;&gt; I can just feel him." &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be acting strange. You may be going through a battle. And God said, "He's a man after my own heart." &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; I remember Jack Cole saying one time Jack called sad. This little old person come to him and such a weary and all beat out of shape but she needed God to do something. He said I just prayed for her. Said I prayed for her and he said now angels step back for she's fixing to have a spell. Step back cuz she's going to have a spell. &gt;&gt; Cuz I just delivered her. &gt;&gt; I just saved her. Step back, angel. Get back. Amen. They fixing to have a spell. &gt;&gt; God bless you in Jesus name. Bless you, brother. Oh. Amen. Can you sing it to him with all your heart now?
