I I say if you haven't done it, why don't you just uh purpose that in your heart this morning that you know what, maybe maybe you fell in love and you know sometimes we let our love wayne a little bit and it gets a little cold and we got to shake ourselves and be reminded Lord I'm I'm sorry you you did everything for me and Lord I want to give a little bit back to you that you could just have your way and have your preeminence in my life and you know it's easy to get caught up with the things of life. But but I say, you know, it's good to fall in love with him &gt;&gt; because he loved us before the foundation of the world. And and I like to tell the church, you know, this whole thing is rigged. &gt;&gt; We're going to make it. &gt;&gt; We're going to make it. &gt;&gt; You know, there shouldn't be any fear. There shouldn't be any gloom. And my we should just be able to love him with all of our heart. Let's just go before him. Lord Jesus, we're just so thankful, Lord, that we could just be gathered into your presence, Lord. and just have another opportunity that you could come by our way. And Lord, we're just looking to you that you would come and minister. Lord, you know where each one of us are at in our lives and in our walk. And Lord, if our heart is far from you, if we've been turned away or if we're looking to turn back, but Lord, I'm so thankful that you won't lose a one. And Lord, you're always looking and coming for us even when we're not looking for you. And Lord, I pray that our heart would just turn to you and that we'd fall more in love with you this morning, Lord. And as your word goes forth, we just pray that you'd break the bread of life and feed your people. Bless bless this assembly. Bless our pastor, Brother Matt, and all the saints that have gathered, those that aren't able to make it, those that are out on the airways. Lord, I just even thought as it was hard to get the stream up and maybe get the video going, I thought maybe maybe there's the devil's fighting against something because there's coming a blessing for somebody that maybe weren't able to make it into these four walls, but they they have a heart to hear from you, Lord. And I know that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. And I believe you're coming with a specific word for each one of us. We love you. We ask these blessings in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you have your Bibles, let's just turn in Colossians chapter 3. Just thank brother Matt for the opportunity to stand here before you and minister. It's always good to come and just appreciate him and his wife and all the hospitality and and their family. They're just a joy to be around and just love love to see uh people give all their heart to the Lord and just see what they can do for the kingdom of God. And you know, I I say it's it's a late hour. We ought to be doing everything to get people in. &gt;&gt; That's right. You know, we ought to be seeking and saving that which is lost. You know, sometimes we make everything so predestinated that we don't have a job to do. But but God only has your hands as you yield your hands and eyes as you yield your eyes and a mouth as you would yield your mouth. And then God could speak through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just see how the Lord will help us uh this morning just to uh minister. Colossians chapter 3 and verse one and two. It says, "If ye then be risen in Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ siteth on the right hand of God, set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth." My, I tell you what, it's it's hard not to uh allow earthly things and the five senses to uh get all your time and attention, but we need to set our affections on things above. in Hebrews 6:1. Just another familiar reading there. Hebrews 6:1. Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and faith toward God. Amen. We just ask a blessing on the reading of the word. You may have your seats. Uh, brother Brandham would say this in uh, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. He would say uh, don't be afraid to put Christ to a showdown. For if he is Christ, he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. We don't have to be afraid. &gt;&gt; If a servant of Christ should be afraid, there's something wrong with the servant. When Moses looked this way and that way, when he slew the Egyptian, it showed he was out of the divine presence of God. For a servant of Christ don't have to look and see if a man said, "Am I doing all right? Is that fine?" Or, "I I'm afraid you'll say something about me." &gt;&gt; A man that's commissioned of God looks upward and onward. &gt;&gt; You don't have to care what the world says about it anyhow. &gt;&gt; He's not listening to the world. He's got a divine commission from God and enjoying that presence. &gt;&gt; I like that. I just maybe something on my heart I want to preach to you this morning is upward and onward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I love that so much. A man that's commissioned of God looks upward and honored. And I believe the bride of Christ, we have a commission. &gt;&gt; We have an objective and our objective is glory. We are we are going into a rapture. And and you know, we ought to not care about what the world has to say about it anyhow. You know, so many times, uh, the critics and people want to come up and say, well, you know, so and so said this and so and so said that. Well, do you know that that's how they feel about it? Well, you know, you know, I know we're humans and we have emotions and when we have feelings, but you know, as the bride of Christ, we have one objective and and that's the word of God and that's glory. And and sure, things hurt when people say this and they try to discourage, but what did God say about it? And if God has given you his word and he's given you a commission, then don't worry about the critic. Don't worry about the naysayer. You're not listening to the world. You got a divine commission from God. And I say we ought to enjoy his presence. I I think the bride ought to get back to enjoying the word of God and enjoying the presence of God. And who cares what the critic says and and this person said and and the person sitting next to me, I come to the house of God to worship. I'm going to praise him. I'm going to enjoy the word. I'm going to enjoy his presence. He's worthy of praise. He's worthy of my voice. He's worthy of my shout. He's worthy of my dance. He's worthy of my strength. He's worthy of every amen and everything I give to him, Lord. And I want to enjoy his presence. &gt;&gt; I want to go upward &gt;&gt; and onward. The scripture would say, Jesus speaking in Matthew 5:48 says, "Be therefore perfect, &gt;&gt; even as your father which is in heaven is perfect." Colossians 3:2, "Set your affections on things above," which is our text, not on things on earth. Come on, man. &gt;&gt; My If we ever live in an age where it's easy to set your affection on the on your job and your work and your car and your your house and and entertainment and all these things, you know, we ought not to do that. Our our our affection should be for him and for his word and and we ought to always be looking for a way to please him and make oursel available to him and Lord, what would you have me to do do today? You know, we get such a rigid schedule where we ain't got no time for God. You know, it would be a shame if if if if we wrote out our whole schedule and it was it said, "Okay, Lord, you have you have 7 to 9 on Wednesday night and you have 11 to 2 on Sunday and then you just pencil in everything else." No, it ought to be every minute, every hour. &gt;&gt; You know, the scripture even tells us pray without ceasing. You know, that there ought to be something in our heart bubbling up and and looking upward and onward. And you know, Paul said, "Forgetting those things which are in the past, I press toward the mark of the high calling in Jesus Christ." You know, uh that also means for for the good and the bad. You know, many times we we might feel accomplished. We we we we've done a little bit for the kingdom of God and and we put in some work and we feel pretty good and you're just on cruise control. You know, we got to we got to forget that. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, you you got to not live like I've apprehended and I've obtained, you know, and I I I I've made it and I go to church and I I do my job. And so now I can just take care of myself. I can work for my retirement. I can work for that new car. I can work for that new house. I go to church on Sunday. I go on Wednesday and I I listen to a tape every once in a while. But you're not careful. Your affections are on the things of the world and not on the things of God. I say we got to leave the past in the past. &gt;&gt; You know, that's wonderful. You got a good track record. I'm glad you've been coming to church for 20 years. I I'm glad you listen to tapes. But you know what? That was yesterday. And we got today. And he's the same yesterday, today. I say, God, what do you have for me today, Lord? What's my commission today, Father? I want to serve you. I want to give you my heart. I want to give you my life, Lord. I want to open up in a full surrender. Lord, I'm leaving those things behind, and I'm pressing toward the mark of the high calling of Jesus Christ. And I was just thinking about how how Paul says that forgetting those things that are in the past, you know, I say, "What what an opportunity we have this morning that the past can be put behind us." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, "What what what an opportunity that God has provided." &gt;&gt; And I just want to say the reason some of us can't go forward, we're too busy hanging on to the past. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, uh uh so many times we we get to places in our walk and in our lives and maybe God does something for us and and we start out, you know, I like the scripture says, "Oh foolish, you know, you are you so foolish having begun in the spirit. Are you now perfected in the flesh?" We wonder why we get into situations and problems. You wonder why you feel backslid. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of times people will come like, "Well, hey, what's going on? What are you going through?" It's like, "You left off doing all the things you were doing. and you ain't reading your Bible like you used to. You ain't listening to tapes like you used to. You ain't in fervent prayer for your brothers and sisters. You ain't seeking God. You wonder why you're in a funk. Well, get back to praying. &gt;&gt; Get back to reading. Well, I don't feel anything when I when I read. I I not get out anything when I listen. Well, I tell you what, I don't care what the bag of bones feels. There ought to be something inside of say, you little bag of bones. I don't care if you feel like you ain't getting anything out of it. I'm going to pray if I don't feel like my prayer is getting out of this building. I'm going to listen to a tape and if I don't feel like I'm getting anything out of it, I'm going to church and if I don't feel a thing, I'm just going to lift my hand. I'm going to say, "Praise God." Anyhow, &gt;&gt; and sometimes we just letting all the things God brought us out of hang on to us. &gt;&gt; You know, I I I wonder if some message believers or or or some preachers out there, we're just becoming good Catholics. &gt;&gt; You got to do repentance and and well, you know, you did because you did this, you're reaping that and you're reaping that. You know what? I serve a God that is able. &gt;&gt; He can wash you white. I don't care how bad your past was. I don't care how bad your faults and your failures was. I don't care if you made a mistake yesterday. Well, I tell you, the blood still has power this morning. If you plead the blood of Jesus Christ, you are forgiven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But oh, in in our flesh, in our in our senses, it's so easy to allow the things of our past just to kind of hang on to us or or oh my, I tell you what, uh uh uh so and so didn't invite me over and and you know, and they went on that vacation and I wasn't invited and and you know, the pastor did that for soand so and he didn't do it for me and and all of a sudden we allow all these things to start hanging on to us and you know what? But then you come to the house of God and you wonder why you're not enjoying his presence. You wonder why you're not enjoying a blessing? Because you got all these things hanging on you. &gt;&gt; Well, you know why? You know, why does God blesses so and so? Why doesn't he bless me? &gt;&gt; You know, so many times we we start to look at things in the natural and the carnal and why what is it? Maybe we got our affections on the things on the earth. Well, we're foolish to compare ourselves one to another. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; I say, let's get back to the main thing. Let's get back to the word. I said, did did Christ die for you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did he save you? &gt;&gt; Did he write your name on the lamb's book of life? &gt;&gt; Are you going in a rapture? Did you receive a message, a vindicated message by a vindicated prophet that called you out of denominations, that called you out of the chicken yard of the world? I I I say it's a finished work. &gt;&gt; Then what are you sad about? What you worried about? Why are you crying about it? I say we ought to be the most happiest people on the face of the earth to know that we are going in a rapture. We got an objective. Our objective is glory. I'm going upward. I'm going onward. I'm not worried about my past. God took care of my past. &gt;&gt; And I want to say, if he took care of your past, he'll take care of your future. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Quit worrying about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Forget those things which are behind. &gt;&gt; Let's go upward. Let's go onward. &gt;&gt; And I've been just feeding on this message. Why Christ speak? And you know it just Moses was never settled until he met the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the reason why a lot of people aren't settled and and they're not secure in their salvation and and they're always looking for something else or a certain way or or or uh just follow me here. May maybe they they look for some man to speak a word over them or or or they're always I need something. I need something to speak to me in my I I tell you what, you know, Moses, that's what the our opening quote said. Moses, he he was trying to fulfill the word of God in his own in his own right. &gt;&gt; And you go through this message here, why Christ speak, he said, brother Bam says, oh, he had intellectual faith. He was born for a purpose. He was the chosen one for the job. &gt;&gt; But he had intellectual faith. &gt;&gt; And brother said with all that intellectual faith, he he said, you know, all that accomplished was a dead Egyptian. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he was worried and looking this way and that way. And he ran and he fled. I say a lot of us, are we that way? Hey, you know, we we try to do something for God and oh, did I do it right? Or what's so and so going to say? Well, I'll go do this for the Lord, but what happens if so and so thinks I'm trying to do this or that? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be afraid. We shouldn't be fearful. &gt;&gt; But when Moses finally met that pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; prophet of God said, "The pillar of fire had what Moses lacked." &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know about you, but I know one thing. The pillar of fire has what I lack. And I say, "What an opportunity we have this morning." The same pillar of fire that was up there on the side of that mountain in a burning bush that spoke out to Moses is the same pillar of fire that is right here in Black Rock, Arkansas to speak to your heart, to speak to your need, to erase your past, to show you your future, to take you upward and onward. &gt;&gt; I say he's here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What an opportunity we have. You don't have to wait another service. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That thing that's been bothering you, that thing that you're holding on to, &gt;&gt; you got something you need to make right with your wife, brother, &gt;&gt; don't put it off. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't go another day. Don't go another service. &gt;&gt; You wonder why the wife is nervous and she's frustrated around in the home. She don't know what's wrong, but you do. Come on. &gt;&gt; You need to make that right. &gt;&gt; Get the presence. You know, hey, just let God speak to your heart. Come on. We're living in a wicked age. &gt;&gt; The lid of hell has been torn off. And there's 200,000,000 demons that have been loosed on the bride. They're attacking your mind. They're attacking your marriage. They're attacking your church. They're attacking your pastor. We're in a fight. We're in a battle. &gt;&gt; We can't just be going along like loosey goosey like nothing's going on. and and maybe there's a little frustration in the house and well why is my wife feeling a little frustrated? Why are things going why are things just don't feel right in the home? You're in a battle. &gt;&gt; We're in a fight. &gt;&gt; I say some of us brothers, we need to man up and say, "You know what? I'm going to possess my vessel and sanctification and honor. I'm going to apply the token to my home. These spirits that I let in here and this nervousness that I let in here, I'm going to apply the token of the living God. I'm going to kick that nonsense out." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Don't Don't wait. We're not guaranteed tomorrow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Have we got so comfortable that we're just coasting now? You know, &gt;&gt; he'll come when he comes. I'm going to Disney World in two weeks. He'll come when he comes. I I sure hope the Lord don't come because I'm looking forward to Disneyland. Let me get my pay raise first. Let me build a bigger house. Let me get a nice Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; Let's get our affections back on the word of God. &gt;&gt; And I say we have an opportunity this morning. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I I say what happens if I we you know what? We ought to we ought to act like this is our last service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just act like this might be the last service we ever have. &gt;&gt; This is going to be my opportunity to let my brothers and sisters know I believe this message. You know, I might have not I might not have raised my hand before and I might have got excited before, but you know what? I realized something. I'm a child of God. I'm the bride and I'm going in the rapture. If I got excited for the things of the world, if I got excited at a ball game. If I got excited for the things of the flesh, you know what? I'm finally I'm going to get free in the presence of God. I'm going to get excited because I have an objective. I got a commission from God. I am going in a rapture. [Applause] Oh, what kind of service could we have? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We start getting our eyes off the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Get our eyes on his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God would say it a certain way. Oh, if we could just break away from this sensebound existence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, oh God, may we break away from this sense bound existence this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. get a revelation of the word and your will for our life. Brother Brandham says this in why Christ speak. He says, "And one day while attending the flock, all at once he seen a burning bush up on top of the mountain burning and went up there and not an intellectual and imagination or delusion, optical illusion, but there was the God of Abraham in a light, a pillar of fire back in the bush. the fire like waves going out, but it didn't bother the bush. And the voice of the scripture, the voice of God, spoke through there and said, "I have chosen you. You are the man. I've raised you up for this purpose. I'm proving to you here by signs you're going down to deliver the children of Israel because my word has got to be filled." I I just want to say this. Don't don't don't gloss over that too quick. You are here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; God is calling you. You are the man. You are the lady that God has called. &gt;&gt; I've raised you up for a purpose to put every devil under your foot. &gt;&gt; I've raised you up to go on a body change. I've raised you up to lay hands on the sick and they recover. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, his word of this day has got to be fulfilled." We're living in the hour. No matter what anyone else says, the word has to be fulfilled. Heavens and earth will pass away, but not his word. Now, when Moses got all this together and seen by every direction, it anointed his faith. What a thought. Now, if I can just maybe show how that speaks to me when when I see the fulfillment of Malachi 4:5 when I see that God has sent a vindicated prophet and Revelations 10 1-7 has been fulfilled. The mighty angel has come down, God has has spoken and loosed the seven seals. And and we might not have been in the meetings. I I don't know about you, but I wasn't there. I wasn't there in Jeffersonville, Indiana when he preached the seven seals. I wasn't there when he preached preached Christ the mystery of God revealed. But then a prophet comes and he'd start talking about identification and say, "I was there when Moses crossed the Red Sea. I was there when he went to Calvary." And then by faith, I see physically in this body, I might not have been there. Oh, but I come from somewhere. There's something in me that was there. There's something in me that was there when Moses crossed the Red Sea. There was something in me with Abraham up on that mountain. There was something in me. I say, why? Because you've come from God and you're going back to God. &gt;&gt; So then when my prophet says, when you see all these things, no, I might not have been there in 1963, but there's something in me by faith. I can see it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I see it laying in the word, and by faith it's vindicated. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "When Moses got all this together and seeing by every direction, it anointed his faith." Oh my, what a thought itself. Seeing the scriptures pointing right straight to what it was and speaking God and the evidence of it there, it anointed what faith he had in him to go to work. &gt;&gt; Well, some of us need to go to work. &gt;&gt; Come on. And that don't mean clock in at your job. &gt;&gt; We need to go to work. &gt;&gt; Our faith needs to be anointed. &gt;&gt; We need to go to work. What ought that do to us? We need a repentance. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We need a revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm saying myself, see, I need a shaking. I need something. I I wonder if we could just identify with that a little bit this morning. If somebody can be honest with themselves and say, you know what? I I I need to repent. Come on. &gt;&gt; I You know what? I I I I I looking in my life. You know what? I need I need to repent of some things. I I need to make some things. I really need a shaking. Maybe you look into your life and realize, hey, so you know what? I need a revival. I I I say that for I need a revival, Lord. I I need a revival. Father, stir up the water. Stand get all the trash out of my life, Lord Jesus. I I need something. And I say if the prophet of God could stand there and openly make a confession to the congregation, say, "I'm I'm saying I need something myself." I believe every believer in here can identify with that word. Say, "Oh, God, I need something. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I I need the Holy Ghost, Lord. I need you, Lord, to come into my home. I realize I've made a mess of things and I've tried to make it right and I've only made it worse. And Lord, I need your help in my marriage. I I I need you to help me love my wife better. You know, one of the the the scriptures that I marvel at is husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm getting myself in trouble now. Lord, I I I I I need you. &gt;&gt; Sorry, son. I'm hunting. &gt;&gt; Lord, I I I need to talk to you about something. Well, I I'm I'm going on a trip with the brothers, Lord. I &gt;&gt; Is God too busy for you? &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, brothers. We We shouldn't get too busy. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't get too busy for our wives. We shouldn't get too busy for our kids. They need you. Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church. &gt;&gt; I can't do that. &gt;&gt; Dead silence. &gt;&gt; I don't have the ability. &gt;&gt; But if I can let him come. &gt;&gt; Look, we we we could go right into a filio love and agape. I ain't talking about a a filio love. &gt;&gt; Husbands, love your wives as that Christ love the church. That's an agapeo love. say, "Oh, God, I need agape love in my life, Lord. I I I've been a little selfish, Lord. I I I've tended to myself a little bit, but let me start looking on the needs of my family, more. Let let me start to to to really uh look out on the kids and and look out on their well-being and see what I could do better. Maybe you could sac sacrifice a little bit so they could do a little bit better. Are you hearing me? Is that okay? I I I don't know. I just know the capstone is love. And and the only way we're going to get out of here, church, is when we can get back to real agape love in the hearts and lives of believers. Where when you hear a need right over the pulpit, you just go, "Oh, God bless so and so." But we can really get a burden in our hearts for lost souls and and people's family and prodical sons and daughters. And we can have a real love in our heart pouring out for our wives and our children and our church and our pastor. We can be in a real prayer. Oh God, bless brother Matt. We need a real dynamic word to come forth, Lord. But anoint my ears to hear. Lord, there's needs. May you send a word, Father. Your word is sharper than any two-edged sword. May you come in power and demonstration. &gt;&gt; Oh, we'll start having a revival. All right. &gt;&gt; Start to get in one mind and one accord. &gt;&gt; I see some sitting on me. Yeah, you might need it the most. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All right. I see it. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm not afraid. I got a commission. Come on. &gt;&gt; I don't have to look left or look right. &gt;&gt; We got a commission. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "I long for the days of Ananas and Safia when sin's called out at the door." &gt;&gt; Make no mistake, there's times, I would even say your pastor of the anointed could call it out. &gt;&gt; A man of God could be preaching on the anointing and there's a resistance in the spirit and you can discern what that spirit is and you're resenting. Why? because you're not allowing deliverance. &gt;&gt; You can't love that spirit. If you're guilty, why don't you say, "Lord, forgive me." &gt;&gt; Make it right. Your attitude can hinder the move of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's what a prophet taught me. Your attitude. I say let's let's get it under the blood. &gt;&gt; Let's look upward and onward. Prophet of God said, "Don't look at where you were. Look at where you're going." &gt;&gt; I like that. &gt;&gt; Oh, sometimes we get too busy living life in a rearview mirror. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Just always looking to the past. Look to the past. He said, "That's how you end up in a wreck." &gt;&gt; Let's quit looking at the past. Let's start looking at where we're going. &gt;&gt; That's what I say. We we sometimes we just let the past hang all over us. &gt;&gt; You know, I believe I had an experience. I got filled with the Holy Ghost and and then I did good for three or four months and and I gave right back into that that temptation. Okay. Well, what are you gonna do about it? &gt;&gt; You gonna throw Are you gonna quit? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You're throwing the towel. Well, God, you your power wasn't good enough. I'm going to go back to the word now. Just make it right, &gt;&gt; Lord. I messed up again. Forgive me. But I know your grace. I know your mercy. I know your blood is more than able to save and sanctify my life again, Lord. Maybe I didn't have what I thought I had, Lord. But I know there's more for me, Lord. So, I'm coming back, Lord, in a true repentance, Lord. I'm sorry. I failed you once again. I'm pleading the blood of Jesus Christ, Lord. But I'm going to get back up and I'm going to face that enemy one more time. And if I fall, I'll make it right and I'll get right back up. And one of these days, I'll get the full total victory. &gt;&gt; I say, let's put it under the blood. Let's go forward. &gt;&gt; That's right. Right. &gt;&gt; Paul said in Romans 8:1, "There is therefore now no condemnation, &gt;&gt; to them which are in Christ Jesus, &gt;&gt; who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit." &gt;&gt; In Christ. &gt;&gt; Well, how do you get in? By one spirit. &gt;&gt; We're all baptized &gt;&gt; into his body. &gt;&gt; Well, how do I do that? Repent. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Make it right. Turn from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to do it anymore. &gt;&gt; Be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And you shall. &gt;&gt; You know, you can take that right there and whoop the devil. &gt;&gt; Maybe say, "Maybe I don't got it. Maybe I I don't have what I thought I had, but I got a promise. &gt;&gt; I have repented. I have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And my God told me I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Devil, back up. Watch out. If I ain't got it now and I'm living like this, wait till I get it. &gt;&gt; But that's just a battle in your mind. &gt;&gt; But sometimes we got to fight like that. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I've made it. I made some pretty bad mistakes. Come on. &gt;&gt; And I'd be like, dude, I you don't got what you think you had. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; And I've been sitting there like, maybe I don't. &gt;&gt; So, what am I going to do? &gt;&gt; I ain't I ain't going back to the world. &gt;&gt; I I there there's nothing in denomination that that entices me. &gt;&gt; I mean, it is dead than dead can be. Come on. &gt;&gt; I come out the world. &gt;&gt; And it's dead than dead can be. &gt;&gt; I made a horrible mistake. I messed up. &gt;&gt; I should have never done it. &gt;&gt; I ain't got nowhere else to go, brother Matt. &gt;&gt; I ain't got nowhere else to go, Lord. I made a mistake, but Lord, I'm coming back to you because I ain't got nowhere else to go. Lord, I need you. I need your grace. I need your word. I need revelation. I need your strength. I need your power. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching about going upward and onward. &gt;&gt; Don't look at the past. Look at what you're going to be. &gt;&gt; Well, my scripture tells me there's therefore now no condemnation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Boy, I tell you what, the devil sure likes to heat that onto you. &gt;&gt; But if you have truly made it right, &gt;&gt; Amen. and you have repented of your sins, &gt;&gt; there is no condemnation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And and I just want to maybe say this. I I really feel like that's where a lot of us struggle in our walks with the Lord is we are always struggling with condemnation. We're always struggling with uh uh well, you know, I I believe I got the Holy Ghost and and God done something supernatural in my life, but but I fell to that temptation. Well, I just want to say this that &gt;&gt; doesn't change the word. &gt;&gt; What are you going to put your faith in? Are you going to put your faith in your failure or are you going to put your faith in the word? &gt;&gt; Are you going to put your faith in your works or are you going to put your faith in the word? Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you going to put your faith and and the mistakes and failures that you made or you going to say, you know what, Lord? &gt;&gt; You said, if I call on the name of the Lord, I shall be saved. You said if if I confess that you're just and faithful to forgive me. Well, I want to say, is God a liar? &gt;&gt; God is not a man that he can lie. Then if he gave you his word, then take God at his word. &gt;&gt; Quit listening to the devil. Quit listening to your past. Quit listening to the condemnation. rise above it. &gt;&gt; I like this. Ephesians says in Ephesians 1:4, "According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, &gt;&gt; that we should be holy and without blame before him love." Remember we said you got a purpose. You are called for a purpose. We're not looking at what we were. We're looking at what we're going to be. He He has chosen you before the foundation of the world that you would be holy and without blame before him in love. &gt;&gt; He predestinated you unto adoption by the children of Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I like to say this because it's not a question as if you can. It's not a question of if he will. &gt;&gt; It's not a challenge. Can I get it all together? It's a promise of what God is doing in your life. &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry. You don't have to wonder, well, will I ever come to adoption? Will I ever get the Holy Ghost? Will I ever get total victory? Will I ever get total deliverance? I'm saying you got a word from the Lord that he has chose you before the foundation of the world that you should be holy without blame before him in love and has predestinated you unto adoption. That is not a challenge. That is a promise for the purpose of your life. That every one of you are coming into the stature of a perfect man. And there ain't no demon in hell. There ain't no complex. There ain't no fear. There ain't no anxiety. There ain't nothing can stop you from coming into the word of God that he's promised to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Romans 8:30. You like your Bible? Romans 8:30 would say this, "Moreover, whom he did predestinate." &gt;&gt; Them he also called, &gt;&gt; and whom he called, them he also justified. &gt;&gt; And whom he justified, them he also glorified. &gt;&gt; Sounds like this thing's rigged. &gt;&gt; So maybe you're justified. &gt;&gt; Maybe he's working on sanctification in your life. &gt;&gt; It's all a work of the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't let the devil beat you up and rob you of your joy of the work of God that he's doing in your life. &gt;&gt; What shall we say to these things? &gt;&gt; What shall we say to these things? &gt;&gt; If God before us, &gt;&gt; who can be against us? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know we're in a battle. I I know I know 200,000,000 demons have been loosed on the bride and and I know they're fighting against us and trying to keep you from going upward and going onward. Oh my. The scripture says in Ephesians 6:12, "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers and rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." &gt;&gt; You wonder why it's so hard to pray. &gt;&gt; Well, quit wondering. We got a real devil, a real adversary. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The greatest battle ever fought. That's what brother Brandham said. You know, you might not have run into the devil, but you will. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, you got to recognize him real. &gt;&gt; There is a real devil. &gt;&gt; And if you just, you know, as the old saying goes, you walk, you know, walking through a graveyard whistling because you're acting like nothing's there, I tell you, they're all around. &gt;&gt; That's right. They're trying to hinder you from praying. They're trying to hinder you from going to church. &gt;&gt; And you know, sometimes not the biggest, most obvious things. You can you can get everything together and and you just make my family is finally going to be 20 minutes early to church. Hallelujah. and you dump your coffee in your lap &gt;&gt; or the child throws this on the ground or you get in the car and honey I told you to put gas in the car. I I mean I didn't say like that honey. Um I should have put gas in the car for you. We're going to be late again. But it's always something. &gt;&gt; But but you know something was on my heart. You know we got to have some spiritual awareness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Like we we we and &gt;&gt; the devil, you know, there's coming a time in the millennium that we know the devil will be chained by circumstance because he won't have anybody to work through. &gt;&gt; But I I hope this doesn't surprise any of you, but we are not in the millennium. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if you are, I haven't got there yet because And if we are, I'm disappointed. &gt;&gt; We ain't there yet. Because there's plenty of things for the devil to work through. &gt;&gt; He'll work through your job. He'll he'll work through your neighbor. He'll work through your car. He'll work through the streaming and the video. &gt;&gt; Make it crash. Make the microphones mess up. Look, there's even quotes from Brother Bam. Talk about it. &gt;&gt; Devil's going to try to get into something. Why? To try to disrupt, to try to discourage. &gt;&gt; He going to work through whatever he can. And you know, you know, one of the things he likes to to to to work through the most, me, &gt;&gt; the guy in the mirror. &gt;&gt; I'm my own worst enemy. &gt;&gt; And I say we ought to have some spiritual awareness in our lives &gt;&gt; and start recognizing in our home, in our situations, in our car, and on our jobs, and everything that we are in a battle. We are in a real war. And we got to say, you know, why did so and so say that? We got to be looking for opportunities to let God come in and realize, you know, that's just the devil. He's just trying to He's just trying to hinder something. He's just trying to cause some I say we there ought to be some discernment. There ought to be some real spiritual awareness and the bride of Christ to realize, hey, we are in a battle. We are in a real war. And to recognize some of the entertainment and some of the things that we give our time and attention to. Satan's want to use those things to distract and pull away and to bring spirits in. I say we ought to we ought to get some spiritual awareness in our lives. [Music] &gt;&gt; Recognize the devil is real. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I like how the prophet goes on. He says, "But then what do you do?" He says, "Recognize that greater is he &gt;&gt; that is in you &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in me than this trial that I'm going through. Greater is he that is in me than the bills that I got to pay." &gt;&gt; Come on. Some of us depend way too much on our job and not on God. &gt;&gt; I see it all the time because they give their job more preeminence than the word. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm sorry. I'm oldfashioned. I I don't know anywhere anywhere else to live. I just know one thing. If you put God first, &gt;&gt; I I'm often met with people, you know, in business and and they'll they'll they'll say, you know, I I I want to start a business and it seems like maybe you've been able to to to to get somewhere and and they I said, "Look, I can sit down and talk to you business all day and and I I I can talk to you about the numbers and everything, but I just let me just tell you my business plan." My business plan comes out of the book of Matthew. Seek ye first the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; That's the problem. Some of us want to be blessed and we're not seeking God. You want a new car, you're not seeking God. We're seeking worldly things, but we're not seeking his righteousness. We're not seeking his word. I want to tell you, if you put God first, &gt;&gt; all these things &gt;&gt; will be added unto you. I say if you if you by faith can take that word, &gt;&gt; what did that opening quote say? Don't be afraid to put Christ to a showdown. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You want to be in church and it's a choice between work and church. Go to church. &gt;&gt; But it better be by faith &gt;&gt; because if it's not by faith, you'll be broke with no faith. Hey, Moses when he slayed that Egyptian, it wasn't by faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, well, I'm a deliverer. &gt;&gt; I guess I got to do my my job. How am I going to do it? Well, I guess I'll start one by one. Own efforts, own ability. But when he came into that presence of that pillar of fire &gt;&gt; and it anointed his faith &gt;&gt; so then now oh okay Lord I see something laying in your word I'm going to come into prayer Lord Jesus I need you to come father anoint my faith I'm going to take you at your word not not not not not to benefit myself not not to b but Lord Jesus I I'm taking you at your word father and now Lord by by by by the faith that you you've given me. I'm going to take that you earned and I'm going to go for it and I'm going to put you first. Oh, I'd say go ahead and put Christ to a showdown. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He won't disappoint you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He will never fail you. He will never leave you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. And greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; Just speaking along the long lines of faith. Brother Benham says this in why Christ speak. He says faith sees what God wants you to see. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Faith sees what God sees. Reasoning and senses sees what the world wants you to see. Notice reasoning. Why? It's only human sense. It's only uh reasons. Well, a ain't this just as good. See that? That's just exactly, you know, I don't know why that pops in my head, but streaming's not just as good. &gt;&gt; It It's not as good. &gt;&gt; You want me to I I Let me just tell you, I've done it. &gt;&gt; I'd much rather be in a meeting than stream a meeting. &gt;&gt; I'd rather be in church than stream church. Now, if you're Now, if you're Now, if you're sick and you can't make it or something comes up, man, praise God, we can stream. &gt;&gt; I'm glad it's archived so that I if I miss something, I can go back and hear what my pastor had to say or the local ministry had to say &gt;&gt; and I can get caught up because the five-fold ministry has been given for your edification and the perfecting of the saints. But I I it seems like people's faith is deteriorating &gt;&gt; and certainly there's been a lot of jokes that have raised up. But I say you ought to thank God that God has given you a God called pastor and a local five-fold ministry that loves the message of the hour and preaches the message and says what a messenger said and doesn't put his thoughts and his ideas and try to twist it and spit it, but brings the the unadulterated word of God and preaches it so you can live it and believe it and be free. And if all you can do is stream, well, we're glad you can stream. But I say there's nothing like being being gathered together of the saints of God. &gt;&gt; There's nothing like being able to come together. He said, you know, your reasoning says, "Well, a ain't this just as good?" That's just exactly when you see when you use those senses which is contrary to the word, then that's what the world wants you to see. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But faith don't look at that. Faith looks what God said. &gt;&gt; See, you know, you cast down reasons. &gt;&gt; If it's contrary to the word, &gt;&gt; cast it down. &gt;&gt; I If God didn't say it, leave it alone. &gt;&gt; So many times we listen to our thoughts and and listen to all these ideas and things that are contrary to the word. Look, if it's contrary to the word, cast it down. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, I believe in uh maybe his greatest battle ever fought, he said, he said, uh uh uh Satan's army brings diseases. &gt;&gt; Satan's army brings all these things to throw it on. He said, "But God's army is commissioned to cast it out." &gt;&gt; I think it's time that we start to cast out some of the things that have come on our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, if you're battling nervousness, you ain't got to live like that. &gt;&gt; If you're battling anxiety, you don't got to live like that. &gt;&gt; Satan put it on you. But I say, I got a commission &gt;&gt; from Almighty God to cast it out. &gt;&gt; We can cast down reasoning, cast down imagination, cast down wickedness, cast down lust, cast down those demon spirits. &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry. You don't have to wonder. Some of us are so caught up with the past and and the things that we've gone through, we're we're worried and wonder, am I going to make it, brother Matt? Am I going to make it? &gt;&gt; The word says you're going to make it. &gt;&gt; The word said you already made it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That makes me happy because I've made a lot of mistakes. I've done a lot of things that I shouldn't have done, but I can look into my Bible and it tells me I chose you. &gt;&gt; When did he choose you? &gt;&gt; When when you when you finally made up your mind to do right? &gt;&gt; When did he choose you when you repented of your sins? &gt;&gt; Did he choose you when you got baptized? &gt;&gt; He chose you before the foundation of the world. That ought to be enough right there to make you scream and shout to know that before the world was ever created, he wrote my name on the Lamb's Book of Life. And no matter how many times I fail, &gt;&gt; I can't even mess it up. &gt;&gt; Now, that ought to produce a love in your heart, &gt;&gt; not a license for for for living any kind of way you want. Some people, well man, I'm just &gt;&gt; I'm so justified and sanctified and predestinated, I can go to the bar. &gt;&gt; Well, you know them by their fruits. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you got an intellectual faith, &gt;&gt; if you got an intellectual understanding, when you come into the presence of that pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; it'll change you. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, "We can cast down all these things." He said, "You're above it, resurrected in Christ Jesus." setting in heavenly places with every devil under your foot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just want to preach right there for a minute. &gt;&gt; We got we got men raising up and diminishing the power of God and and preaching a halfway gospel and a sofa religion and and making excuses for the flesh and the power of God in the individual's life. I say don't let any preacher diminish the power of God. God can have so control of you that the devil don't know what to do with you. You can be so surrendered. You can speak mountains into existence. You can speak them into the sea. You can speak squirrels into existence. Oh, brother Matthew, that was just for the prophet. That was a first one to maturity. Showing the bride of Jesus Christ, we're all coming to the stature of a perfect man. And if you have a need, if you say to this mountain, that puts you back in the word. &gt;&gt; If you say, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; We got uh men making excuses for the flesh. Well, you know, it's just going to it's just going to be that way and and you know, that's the way you were born and this and that. I rebuke that. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to stop short of perfection. I'm not going to stop short of manifesting every promise that was spoke by Malachi 4:5. &gt;&gt; I'll say like Paul said, "My preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit, that your faith not might not stand in the wisdom of man, but in the power of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. Prophet of God picks that up and says the power of God to change the man. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know where we're the rest of the way we're going to go in the service, but I say one thing. Is there somebody here says, "I need to change." &gt;&gt; I need the power of God to change me, &gt;&gt; Lord. Make me more like you, &gt;&gt; Lord. I I need more of you. I need that shaking. I need that repentance, Lord. I need that revival. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to see that word so manifested in my life. Lord, I I don't want to settle short. I don't want to stop short. &gt;&gt; Look, friends, we have a message of restoration. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I mean, everything that Adam has lost has been given back to the believer, full authority, full power. &gt;&gt; Why would we stop short? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like the children of Israel crossing over Jordan say, "Hey, we made it to the promised land. Well, yes and no. There's so much more God has in store for us, church. &gt;&gt; Let's not stop short. Let's keep going upward and onward. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, there is a power here this morning to change you. &gt;&gt; There's a power here. There's a revelation here for you this morning. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Is there somebody here that in your heart you you you're crying out for more revelation? Somebody, &gt;&gt; is there somebody that wants total victory over that thing that you've been battling? &gt;&gt; You ain't got to wait any longer. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, he's right here, right now. &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart that that same pillar of fire that met Moses on the back side of the desert, he's here right now, this morning. When I read things like this in the message, when a spirit born, spiritfilled man in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lips. &gt;&gt; Why? That is the same as deity speaking. &gt;&gt; Every mountain has to go. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to put Christ to a showdown. &gt;&gt; We're commissioned to cast out evil spirits. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have you don't have to fear that thing that you've been battling. &gt;&gt; I say I pray God would anoint your faith this morning &gt;&gt; to speak to that mountain. &gt;&gt; Fear, you've plagued me long enough. &gt;&gt; I I'm casting you down. Anxiety, you've plagued my life long enough. I I I'm speaking to you. Anxiety, there ain't no place for you anymore. The word has come and the pillar of fire is here to anoint my faith. You got to go, devil. Get out of my way. I cast you down in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Lust, you got to go. Complexes, you got to go. Fear, you got to go. Devil, get out of my life. Get out of my family. Get out of my church. &gt;&gt; I cast you down. &gt;&gt; Speak to the mountain. Every mountain got to go. &gt;&gt; You don't got to back up. That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Matthew, you're just saying that. Well, I might be just saying that. &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart. &gt;&gt; I've seen it. &gt;&gt; I believe it. Talking about a commission. I believe God's given your pastor a divine commission to go into all the world and preach the gospel. To lay hands on the sick and they shall recover, to cast out evil spirits. &gt;&gt; I believe I've been called. I believe we have a commission. Then I say, I am not afraid to put Christ to a showdown. &gt;&gt; Faith knows where it's standing. &gt;&gt; Fa There's no fear in faith. &gt;&gt; There's no fear in faith. Faith knows about it. &gt;&gt; Faith got big, great, big muscles and hairs on the chest. Faith says, "Shut up." And everybody else sits down. I know where I'm at. &gt;&gt; Well, do you know where you're standing at this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; Then I say, why don't we quit tolerating some of the stuff that we're tolerating? &gt;&gt; We've allowed some things into our house. We've allowed some things into our home. We've allowed some entertainments in. We're doing some things we should not do. We've allowed atmospheres and complexes and things. I say it ought not to be that way. &gt;&gt; We We don't need a sixstep counseling program to fix it either. &gt;&gt; I don't need to go down to some shrink down the street to fix my mind. All I need is Jesus. Just give me Jesus. Jesus Christ. the same yesterday, today, and he knows all about it. If you can just get to Jesus, and I want to tell you, Jesus Christ is here this morning, he can make the wrongs right. &gt;&gt; He can fix your mind. He can fix your marriage. He can deliver you from lust and complexes and fear. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know what I'm talking about. Scripture says, "For whosoever is born of God," 1 John 5:4, "For whosoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is no fear in faith. &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, you got five senses, but there's another six sense. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We just try to move towards a close here. The prophet of God said, "Moses never feared Pharaoh. He said he didn't care what Pharaoh said. &gt;&gt; The most mighty ruler in all the world. &gt;&gt; Moses had a commission from God. &gt;&gt; And once he came into that pillar of fire, the prophet of God said, "A man commissioned of God, he's enjoying his presence." &gt;&gt; Oh my, I like that. I just want to enjoy his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to enjoy his word. I want to enjoy where I'm going. He said, "A man that's commissioned of God looks upward and onward." You don't have to care what the world says about it anyhow. &gt;&gt; Well, my Bible says, "These signs shall follow them that believe. In my name, they shall cast out devils. &gt;&gt; They shall speak in tongues, they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." Look, I do not have to look to the left and to the right. I don't have to fear, and I don't have to wonder. If somebody comes up for prayer, I am not wondering and questioning if I have a divine commission to take God at his word. And my God is not a liar. And if God anoints your faith to take God at his word, I say that mountain's got to go. Satan, you got to go. Cancer, you got to go. Sickness, you got to go. Fear, you got to go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Prophet of God said this. He said, just bringing this out of why Christ speak. He says the real Christian believer today, no matter what the church says, what anybody else says, when that light strikes and they see the very vindication of God, that pillar of fire hanging there and the signs and wonders that's promised, the scripture being laid in, it comes to life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I I don't know about you, but I believe as we are all predestinated sons and daughters of God that there is a seed laying there within you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you and you can you can try in your own efforts. You can run into the world. You can do all these things. Just as brother Bannon was laying in there about Moses, he had an intellectual faith, an intellectual standing that he was born for a purpose. And even though it was intellectual, he was intellectually right. He had been raised him and told him, "You were born for a purpose. You're a proper child." Moses knew he was born to be a deliverer. Moses, he knew the ways of his people. He was raised in church. He was raised in a message church. He knew he was going in a rapture. He he he knew that he was the bride of Jesus Christ, but it was all under an electoral faith. All the equipment was there. All the ability was there. &gt;&gt; He could quote the quotes. He could quote the prophet. He could say all those things and he'd be right. But yet the seed had never been quickened. &gt;&gt; It had never been made alive. You wonder, well, when I I start out, see, when when Moses tried to manifest the word in his own ability, it didn't work. &gt;&gt; You wonder why sometimes we try to manifest the word and it doesn't work. Maybe it's in our own ability. It's not his time. It's not his season. You might not be the right person for it. You know, all those must. &gt;&gt; Must be the time. Must be the season. Must be the right person. So many times something needs to be done and and it's the will of the Lord that it get done, but you ain't the right person. &gt;&gt; Come on. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; And that we've been taught that by a prophet. &gt;&gt; We got to wait for the time and the season. Sometimes the reason why we can't have an overcoming life, &gt;&gt; we're like Moses. You're trying to make this message work. Look, you can never make the message work in your flesh and you can never make it work in your mind. It will drive you insane &gt;&gt; or you'll walk away. &gt;&gt; But if you ever come into the presence of that light, &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, help me right now. If you ever come into the presence of that pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; it'll quicken that seed to life." I &gt;&gt; I was thinking about that woman at the well, how many times she had tried, how many mistakes, how many husbands buried in mistakes and failures and buried in religion. A and because of her own choices and her own mistakes, she was an outcast. And she's coming to the well and behold, there's somebody waiting on her. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe I can say it like that. Maybe maybe maybe you've been going through things and you've been wondering. But I want to say when you came here this morning, somebody was waiting on you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He knew all about your faults. He knew about your failures. He knew about the mistake. But he was waiting there for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I got needs to go by Samaria." And to think in in all of her efforts and all of her struggles and all of her trials, buried in all of that, there was a predestinated seed. And all it needed to do was come into his presence. &gt;&gt; Give me a drink. &gt;&gt; It's not customary for for us Samaritans to talk to you. If you knew who you were talking to, you would ask me for a drink. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have nothing to draw with. Are you greater than our fathers, Jacob? There's coming a time where you'll neither worship on that mountain and this one. &gt;&gt; Oh, what what was he doing? He was catching our spirit. &gt;&gt; Some of us, we allow our hearts to be so hard. &gt;&gt; We don't let the anointed word catch our spirit in the service. We're just so shut off and locked up. And I say, if if you'll just start communing just for a minute, say, Lord, you know, you're right. I'm just going to let you have the ride away, Lord. Come on. &gt;&gt; I I want I want to talk it over. I I've been a little hurt and I haven't wanted to really talk about it much, but but Lord, I I'll I'll entertain for a minute. &gt;&gt; I start to open up my heart. He said, "Well, why don't you go get your husband?" You don't have a husband. You've told the truth and the one you're living with, you've had five. And the one you What was it doing? The word was starting to discern her heart. &gt;&gt; What was it? that it was that anointed word flashing upon that predestinated seed. &gt;&gt; And even in her condition, when that light struck that seed, something spoke back. I perceive that thou art a prophet. &gt;&gt; When Messiah comes, he will tell us these things. &gt;&gt; I am He. And just in a moment in his presence, &gt;&gt; think of the years, think of the marriages, think of the hurt, think of the pain, think of how much she was an outcast. &gt;&gt; And in a minute, all of her past. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Became a testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now she's running back into the city. &gt;&gt; Which once would have been, oh, &gt;&gt; I'm an outcast. I'm a sinner. Look at the things I've done. But now that she's been in his presence, come see a man &gt;&gt; who told me all the things that I done. Is this not the Messiah? And she converted a whole town. &gt;&gt; But I want to say that same Jesus is here this morning. Maybe we'll just invite the musicians to come as we look for a place to close. &gt;&gt; That same Jesus is here that you can come into his presence. That that seed can be quickened, that seed can be made alive. My Bible tells me in Romans 8:35, "What shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, shall distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword? As is, as it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are counted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. &gt;&gt; Look, we have a commission. Take the land. Footsteps our possession. Total victory, total deliverance. You don't have to you don't have to uh uh settle. Come on. You don't have to settle for partial victory. &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; brother. Brother Brandham goes in and and and it says about how, you know, Pharaoh once he started seeing all the plagues and everything, he finally told Moses, he said, "You know what, Moses, why don't you just just go worship and then come back?" &gt;&gt; And sometimes God starts moving in our life and and we make a deal with the devil. Well, you can come to church three times or two times a week, but you know, come back to your job. Come back to your music. Come back to your entertainment. But I like how the prophet starts to talk about Moses. He said, "Haven't we got that today? If you just join church, that's all right." He said, "You know, the faith that Moses had didn't believe in a so far religion." He said, "We're all going. We're going all the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to the promised land. &gt;&gt; We just don't go out here and make a denomination and stop. We're going on through. &gt;&gt; I am going to the promised land God promised us. &gt;&gt; Look, I want to tell you church, there ain't no obstacle. There ain't no Red Sea. There ain't no Pharaoh. There is nothing that can stop you from going upward and onward into every single promise that God has given you. &gt;&gt; Look, this bride doesn't believe in a sofa religion. We don't believe in a halfway religion. We we we we believe in total victory. You don't have to settle for a halfway religion. You don't have to settle for a partial victory. You don't have to settle for your kids being out there in the world. I serve a God that's more than able. He can save your family. He can save your kids. &gt;&gt; We're all going and I ain't leaving a hoof behind. &gt;&gt; Every blessing in the Bible is yours. Every promise for the age is yours. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. We're going all the way. &gt;&gt; Moses said, "It's just not me going. We're all going." &gt;&gt; Brother said, "We got something to do. We've all got to be anointed." &gt;&gt; I'd like to maybe end right around them lines. We all got to be anointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't just depend on your mommy and your daddy. &gt;&gt; You can't just depend on the preachers. We all need one another. We all got to be anointed. &gt;&gt; Maybe we all just stand. Faith sees what God wants. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God wants you to be delivered. God wants you to be healed. God wants you to be free. God wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; God wants to end you with power on high. You know, I brought this quote up, so I'm going to read it because many times I feel like where a lot of us get stuck is we lack. And I say, "God, give me more revelation of this." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But how are we ever going to go into the greater works? How are we ever going to speak bounds? How are we ever going to do all these things when when we ain't got a a true revelation of justification? &gt;&gt; We're still letting the devil uh remind us of our past. We're still letting things kind of overshadow us. &gt;&gt; I wonder if it was all Hey, if it's under the blood, it's taken care of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says it like this. You are standing completely justified. Look, we're preaching about going upward and onward. &gt;&gt; We're talking about leaving the past behind. &gt;&gt; We're talking about don't look at what you were. Let's look at what you're going to be. My prophet said, "You're standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning." Amen. &gt;&gt; This is my message to the church. He says, "You are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God." &gt;&gt; Every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place. &gt;&gt; You are perfect. &gt;&gt; Well, I want to say this. If if if I could just catch a revelation, a greater revelation of that, then what do I got to be afraid of? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm justified. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; I'm perfect. &gt;&gt; That means I can take God at his word. I can march forward into every single promise. I don't have to be looking to the left and to the right. Well, what does so and so have to say about that? Well, maybe maybe I'm not this and maybe I'm not that. Don't be afraid to put Christ to a showdown. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; A man that's commissioned of God looks upward, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; and onward. &gt;&gt; You don't have to care about what the world says about it anyhow. He's not listening to the world. &gt;&gt; He's got a divine commission from God and enjoying &gt;&gt; that presence. I say, why don't we start enjoying his presence? &gt;&gt; Maybe as we just sing a song of worship. Let's get our eyes back on the word. Let's set our affections on the word, not on the things of the world. Start to look, hey, I I have a commission of almighty God. I I I got I got to possess my vessel in sanctification. I got to be a leader of my home. I got to be be a real husband. I got to be a real father. I I got to take this word and I got to press it into the coming of the Lord. I don't have to worry about my past, my failures. If I made a mistake, I plead the blood. I get back up. I go onward. If I'm not seeing the fruits of God in my life, go. You know where you're living. &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know whether you're living right. You know whether you got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And many times if you're hearing some negative condemnation, you don't got the Holy Ghost. You made a fail. You know what? Whenever you want to know the devil's lines when he's talking, &gt;&gt; come on now. &gt;&gt; And that's where you say, "Well, if I don't got it, I got a promise. I'm going to get it. I'm going to keep going on with God. You ain't got don't don't argue. Don't wonder. &gt;&gt; He who started the work in you is just and faithful to finish it. &gt;&gt; I say it's time to take the word of God and start beating back the devil. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said if he don't move the first time, what do you do? Hit him again. &gt;&gt; Hit him again. I said, let's get back to enjoying the presence of Almighty God. God bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. trusting all these things will work for my good. He walks beside me. Heaven is in my view. I'm going to make it through. Will I say I'm going to make it? He all said I would. They just keep trusting all these things will work out for my good.

This is my plea. Let the worshippers arise. Let the sons and daughters sing. Yes, my Lord, I'm surrendering my all. Oh Lord, I surrender. Oh father, I hear it growing louder.

You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just certainly appreciate our brother speaking. We I just want to point out where brother Chris is right there. Brother Chris, raise your hand. Don't be embarrassed. Just go ahead and raise your hand. That's brother Chris. Amen. and y'all just turn around and and greet him this morning. They're they're our canons now. So, we just got everything moved in and his wife and family and so they certainly mean a lot to us and have had a desire to to be here for some time and so they've finally been able to get moved in. So, y'all just welcome them and if any way we can help and be reach out and be a support to them, we certainly uh want to do that. So, I just want to maybe I'll just give him a warm welcome this morning. God bless you, brother. And I know sister Sandy, we left her with her family there for a few days. And so, until she gets a a real ID and an up-to-date passport, uh she's she's going to be looking looking for a way to get I don't know how we got her out there. Sarah said they had to coax the people who let her in the airport. So, her passport was expired and the ID was out of date and they let her on the plane. I They'd have never let me by with that. But she's a sweet little lady and and they let her board the plane and she was a non-threat. And I don't know where how they gathered that. But um but see, we we certainly had a good time. But she had been witnessing to some of her uh grandkids. And last Thursday, um, we we went down to the river there and and baptized and had quite a little baptism service there, uh, Thursday and we baptized three of her grandchildren. And, uh, and I we was baptizing the boy. And then this, uh, young girl, Brother Brian, was part of the service there. And that young girl, she came there, she wanted to get baptized. And of course, you know, me as a being a pastor, I I'll baptize anybody. I don't I don't I'm not going to turn anybody away. we don't turn anybody away from communion. We don't turn anybody away from fellowship and we don't turn anybody away from baptism. And so they feel like that's on their their heart to do. We sure would never get in the way of that. And and so uh uh but this little girl, she walked in there and I said, "Do you I said, "Do you uh do you know what baptism means? I mean, cuz here she comes walking in the water." She said, "It means I want to live my life for God." I said, "Well, that's good enough revelation for me." Well, come on in here. Amen. So we just appreciate the Lord. Amen. I believe he can give that revelation to a little girl. Amen. And I think that if I if if that God is merciful, I think it's the mercy of God that he would give you that revelation as a child. Amen. And keep you through all the the things that we go through in this life. So we just appreciate what God has been doing. And a lot of these young people's been I know little Emma got baptized the other day and and uh and and one of uh brother Brian's nephew there had been baptized in in the past few weeks. So we just really appreciate what God is doing among the uh the young people. And you realize that's another generation of believers and and what we instill in them. I thank God. I thank God. But I heard a a song this morning that was talking about the uh the pre the preacher that prayed for the preacher that prayed for me. I thank God there was somebody that witnessed to them long enough that they would be able to witness to me. Amen. Otherwise, we'd be without hope. I appreciate our elders and uh standing on the word. And we have such wonderful elders in our church. This is a real it's a holiness church and we get so many compliments on the way that our our brothers and sisters present themselves in the world. And I'm so proud of you, all you young people and young brothers and sisters and how you present yourself. And uh it just every everywhere we go, we get compliments coming back from the camp of other churches and uh people complimenting our church and how that the uh the young people conduct themselves and the way they act and the way they dress and look. And so I just say God bless you. I I thank God that we're able to be a part of a church that would have that kind of a life. And and I I just I just appreciate what God is doing. And I appreciate brother Madd and just opening up his heart and and my what a what a reminder to keep our eyes on the things the look on the things of God and not the things of the world. Amen. My isn't that a isn't that a right thing that we ought to be able to follow the will of God regardless of what would happen in this world. Well, regardless of our job or our boss and you know, well, I'd like to serve God and Lord's put something on my heart, but you know, but what about if my boss wouldn't let me, but you know, but if the boss fires you, just go ahead and follow what God puts on your heart. That that ought to be our desire is just to go follow God. Amen. And once you get that place, God will work the rest of it out. I believe that. Do you believe that this morning? And and so we sure appreciate our brother just opening up and letting God use him this morning. And and we just want to be in that commission. We don't want to be unsettled. There's too many unsettled people today. And that brother opened up with that this morning. You know, talking about Moses. You know, Moses lost out on 40 years of years that God could have used him. He lost 40 years because he was running instead of just following the pillar of fire, looking for an answer somewhere else or maybe I'll find it here, maybe I'll find it there. So unsettled. But whenever he met the pillar of fire, then God was able to use him. I thought, Lord, don't let me lose 40 years. Don't let me wander here and there and waste 40 years before I find that you could use me right there. Amen. So, I just thank God that he would bring a man uh to remind us of that. And brother Bram said we are following that same pillar of fire. Do you believe that this morning? Matter of fact, he said that same pillar of fire is what will lead us into the millennium. So, if you're not following, you're never going to be led into there. So, we have a pillar of fire that we're following after. He leads us right into his word and he he he he he corrects us sometimes and it ain't it ain't fun when you get talked to like a child sometimes. But but sometimes he but just like a good daddy after he corrects you, he tells you you're the you're the best son there ever was and you're you're the best you're the best player on the field. You're the you're the best one out there. You're the best kid in the school. And so we like a good a good heavenly father that can correct us and then encourage us. Amen. Don't you love that this morning that God cares enough about our needs to lead us? We sure love the Lord and and appreciate Brother Matt. And so we just want to bow our head. Brother Brian, could you close us in a word of prayer this morning? We bow our heads. Most gracious heavenly father, Lord, Father God, you sent your word to heal us, Lord. Father God, and so many times we've heard messages lately about the battle, Lord God. And we stand on a battlefield, Lord. Father God, and you sent Brother Matt unto us this morning, Lord God, that would tighten up our armor, Lord. Father, it would tighten up our helmet, tighten up our shield, Lord. Father, and sharpen our sword, Lord, that we could stand upon the very word, Lord God, and go to battle, Lord God. Give us the skill and the understanding, Lord, to fight the battle that lays before us, Lord. Father God, I pray, God, that you would give strength to Brother Matt, Lord God, as he poured himself out, Lord. Father God, be with him and his family as they travel, Lord God, not knowing what their itinerary is. But I know, Lord, one thing, Father God, he's on the field for you, Lord. And I pray Lord Lord that you would give him strength Lord to do what you've called him to do Lord knowing Lord God he's not backing down but going forward Lord and I know that every servant of God that is here this morning Lord every child of God that is here this morning no matter what age Lord they're going forward and upward Lord Jesus and I pray that you give each one of them strength to stand Lord God Father for I know if we do all we can do to stand Lord you'll swoop loop in, Lord, and you'll carry us through. Lord, I praise you for this church, for my pastor, for each member here. Lord, I thank you and I love them, each one. And we love you, Lord. Father, because you brought your word to us, Lord. Father, you didn't leave us out in the cold, Lord God, not knowing, Lord, what your word means to us, Lord. Father, you sent us a prophet, Lord, that read the love letter to us, Lord. Now we can go with assurance to know Lord God that we are yours and you are ours Lord. We love you and we praise you Lord in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
