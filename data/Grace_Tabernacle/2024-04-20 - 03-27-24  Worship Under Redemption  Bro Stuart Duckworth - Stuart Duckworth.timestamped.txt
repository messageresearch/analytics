[30:58] Lord will will move in on your behalf
[31:01] amen amen just a just a sub subtext
[31:04] there subtitled rejecting and overcoming
[31:07] the LIE of the devil John
[31:11] 8 then spake Jesus again unto them
[31:15] saying I am the light of the world and
[31:18] he that followeth me shall not walk in
[31:20] darkness but shall have the light of
[31:23] life and the Pharisees therefore said
[31:26] unto him thou bearest record
[31:28] of thyself and thy record is not true
[31:31] true so they're basically calling Jesus
[31:33] a liar and Jesus answered and said unto
[31:36] them though I bear record of myself yet
[31:39] my record is true for I know whence I
[31:41] came and whether I go but ye cannot tell
[31:45] whence I come and whether I go ye judge
[31:48] after the flesh I judge no man and yet
[31:51] if I judge my judgment is true for I am
[31:54] not alone but I am the father that sent
[31:57] me and it is also written in your law
[32:00] that the testimony of two men is
[32:26] true
[32:32] and we see Jesus here even as a young
[32:35] child growing up you no doubt there were
[32:37] Whispers of of of of his birth and and
[32:40] the illegitimacy of it and as a young
[32:43] child he had to deal with those things
[32:45] as a teenager growing up he had to deal
[32:47] with those things and even Amen in his
[32:49] ministry here he also had to deal with
[32:52] these with these
[32:53] things and brother randam says here in
[32:56] 1951 he he said all that live Godly in
[32:59] Christ Jesus will suffer persecution he
[33:02] said the devil's always been after the
[33:04] Church of the Living God is that right
[33:06] and it's always had a black name Jesus
[33:09] was born in this world with a black name
[33:11] as a IL illegitimate child did you know
[33:14] that supposed to be born a child out of
[33:16] holy wedlock Jesus had that hanging on
[33:19] him but in his heart he knew he was the
[33:23] son of God and that's what it comes down
[33:25] to amen amen the lies of the devil
[33:27] you've got to come down you've got to
[33:29] know who you are because those attacks
[33:32] of the enemy are going to come he's
[33:33] going to try amen to Del legitimize if I
[33:37] get that word out try not to say that
[33:40] one again amen our Jesus he's going to
[33:44] try to try to try to throw a black name
[33:46] on what we believe amen but to you and I
[33:49] there's life in this no matter what the
[33:51] internet says no matter amen what
[33:53] somebody tries to figure out on their
[33:55] own understanding amen amen in this
[33:57] message message for you and I it is life
[34:00] because it is Jesus
[34:03] Christ and he goes on he says and men
[34:05] and women you know where you stand
[34:07] tonight and there's only one person
[34:09] knows he said that's God knows where you
[34:12] stand so it's between you and God it's
[34:15] not the voices of the outside world it's
[34:17] not the voices that try to come in it's
[34:19] not the Demons of Doubt right amen it's
[34:22] between you and God God knows where you
[34:24] stand and you know where you stand
[34:25] tonight he says so if you're Hearts
[34:28] right with God really live for him be
[34:30] true to him love him so much that
[34:33] everything else becomes secondarily and
[34:35] then you'll love the Lord God with all
[34:37] your heart with all your strength with

[35:04] always trying to get Jesus to trip up
[35:07] and under a religious spirit they did
[35:10] this to tempt Jesus that they might have
[35:13] accusation against him but he stooped
[35:15] down and rode in the sand as though he
[35:18] heard them not and they continued to ask
[35:21] him and he stood upon his feet and he
[35:25] said he that is without sin cast the
[35:27] first stone in her he was the only one
[35:30] that could say something like that and
[35:32] them being convicted in their conscience
[35:34] begin to leave one by one starting with
[35:36] the eldest and then Jesus asked her he

[48:18] what did they do they they broke the law
[48:20] of God they broke the law of what God
[48:22] said not to do amen he told Eve he said
[48:25] you you eat this and your eyes will be
[48:27] open you shall be as Gods knowing good
[48:30] and evil and see Satan is a designer

[48:37] and by his lies his Mis
[48:39] misrepresentations of what God said he
[48:42] projects his thoughts for your life
[48:45] because he's a designer he can't create
[48:48] so he has to project and try to pervert
[48:50] what God has already created right
[48:53] right so and we see from that accepted
[48:57] lie in the Garden of Eden Satan has
[48:59] designed his own Eden and has become the
[49:02] god of this evil age he's had 6,000
[49:06] years Amen to design he's had 6,000
[49:09] years to study human nature to study you

[49:35] over amen but don't let down your guard
[49:38] amen amen because he's like a roaring
[49:40] lion seeking roaming about seeking whom
[49:42] he may devire and don't think he ain't
[49:44] trying to destroy the seed of God here
[49:47] tonight amen but I want to say tonight
[49:49] that you're predestinated you're
[49:50] predestinated in this hour to stand amen
[49:53] as that Eve she sold you out she gave
[49:56] you up amen this Eve is predestinated to
[49:59] stand in this
[50:02] hour take what a prophet of God said
[50:05] about you let it anoint your faith amen

[52:46] pump in their system she became more and
[52:48] more like a man got a full beard but
[52:51] that's the
[52:52] perversion of what we've gotten to it's
[52:55] the saddest thing
[52:57] it's the saddest thing but in in the in
[52:59] the Demonic Realms you see what Satan
[53:01] he's trying to copy what God is doing
[53:04] among his people amen he's changing us
[53:06] from glory to glory amen we may not all
[53:10] change all at once amen but there's
[53:12] stages there's things amen there there's
[53:14] amen there's Revelations that come and
[53:17] what we'll do is if if you'll just sit
[53:20] sit quiet and sit still the father will
[53:22] reveal his word to you amen but we let
[53:26] we let jobs we let we let this we let
[53:28] our wife we brother say you let the
[53:30] pastor you let this one and you let this
[53:32] this one take it out of you but it's a
[53:34] father if you'll sit quiet if you'll sit
[53:36] still he's trying to reveal himself to
[53:38] you he's trying to change you from glory
[53:41] to glory amen amen to make you different
[53:43] from what you
[53:46] were but under perversion we see what
[53:49] Satan's trying to
[53:50] do you see some of these people they
[53:52] I've just seen where you probably seen
[53:55] it too where you you know these
[53:56] transgenders they'll change and then
[53:58] they'll want to go back and then they'll
[54:00] want to go back again what is it their
[54:03] minds are all messed up they're living
[54:05] under the deception and the delusion of
[54:07] the
[54:10] devil but there's a word here to change
[54:13] you I can't change you but he can I
[54:17] can't change you but I know a man who
[54:20] can
[54:25] amen I just read this quote and I I
[54:27] thought it it was good maybe we can get
[54:30] something out of it he says here now
[54:32] that's in power of transformation he
[54:34] says that's what I'm trying to warn you
[54:35] all here about when you see God's seed
[54:38] begin to take hold to grow watch out for
[54:41] that fellow coming in just as slick as
[54:43] he can be quote scripture just as as who
[54:46] couldn't have who wouldn't have it see
[54:48] watch him because he's a deceiver I'm
[54:50] not talking about nobody I just read
[54:52] this quote and I seen it and I thought
[54:54] it was good I'm going he said I'm going
[54:56] to call instead of a conformer being
[54:58] conformed he's a
[54:59] deformer Satan is a deformer deforming
[55:02] the things that's been conformed he's a
[55:04] deformer a perverter a corruptor of the
[55:07] Original Seed of the original program he
[55:10] said now you see here like in your group
[55:12] here you've got a program you've got a
[55:14] vision you've got a program you've got a
[55:17] vision now watch for that corruptor
[55:18] he'll be Sly Slick as he can be but keep
[55:21] your vision see keep holding to that
[55:24] amen a a prophet of God God came in this
[55:27] hour he showed us the difference between
[55:29] the church and the bride he showed us
[55:32] the serpent seed he showed us the man of
[55:34] iniquity showed us all these things and
[55:36] it it's it's to show you who you are
[55:39] show you that you're different that
[55:41] you're set apart that we're supposed to
[55:42] be different from the church and to give
[55:45] us a vision of what the bride is
[55:47] supposed to
[55:48] be amen pray for my
[55:55] voice praise the
[55:58] Lord in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[56:01] the church age book he says in this
[56:04] Revelation he tells us what the end of
[56:06] the devil is he tells us how it's going
[56:09] to deal with the devil and cast him into
[56:11] the Lake of Fire he reveals the end of
[56:14] the wicked ones who follow Satan and
[56:16] Satan hates that he said have you ever
[56:18] noticed Satan hates the two books of the
[56:21] Bible all the more than the others he's
[56:23] always attacking the Book of Genesis and
[56:25] the Book of Revel ations in both of
[56:27] these books we find Satan's Origins his
[56:30] awful ways of Destruction and that's why
[56:32] he attacks them he hates to be exposed
[56:34] in those books because he's exactly what
[56:36] he is and Jesus he said Jesus said about
[56:39] Satan he has no part in me and I have no
[56:42] part in him and he said the devil would
[56:45] like to try to come prove different but
[56:46] he cannot so all he does is try to
[56:48] destroy the confidence in the word he
[56:52] said I love this but when the church
[56:53] disbelieves Satan and believes the
[56:56] spirit's revelation of the word the
[56:58] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her
[57:02] don't you believe that tonight all hell
[57:04] is against this truth all hell is
[57:06] against this teaching there had to come
[57:08] a movement where they would try to
[57:10] destroy this word where they would try
[57:12] to discredit this word amen because it
[57:14] always had to come it always had to be
[57:17] that way amen but amen there's a church
[57:19] that's going to disbelieve Satan and
[57:21] she's going to believe the spirit's
[57:23] revelation of the world that's not will
[57:26] bram's Revelation that's the spirit of
[57:28] God the light of God the power of God
[57:31] that was s in this hour amen amen the
[57:34] the spirit's Revelation telling you who
[57:36] you are telling you the conditions of
[57:38] the age amen warning you of the formal
[57:41] spirit that would creep in the blindness
[57:44] of this age and it ask you to purchase I
[57:48] have that you can see anoint your eyes
[57:51] with the message of the hour the spirit
[57:54] of God speaking to you
[57:57] amen it's more than words of a man and
[58:01] how Satan God help my voice how Satan
[58:05] projects his thoughts and he designs God
[58:07] has projected his thoughts to you and I
[58:09] in this hour to change you and to
[58:11] transform you you got to reject the LIE
[58:15] of the
[58:17] devil
[58:19] amen I love this Christ in the true
[58:22] church is what a continuation of the
[58:25] book of Acts
[58:26] but the Book of Revelation shows how the
[58:28] Antichrist spirit will come into the
[58:30] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[58:33] formal and Powerless amen so it it
[58:36] exposes Satan it exposes his works and
[58:39] you've got to discern you've got to
[58:42] discern and withstand as Believers in
[58:44] this hour you've got to discern and
[58:46] withstand that Antichrist spirit and
[58:48] what does he come and do he tries to
[58:50] make he tries to quien you down he tries
[58:53] to bring you down amen he tries to give
[58:55] you an old form normal oh oh weak Spirit
[58:58] oh water down Spirit he'll try to come
[59:00] in our pull pits and I nobody here does
[59:02] this but he'll try to come in our pull
[59:04] pits and try to sugarcoat something try
[59:07] to water something down amen I don't
[59:09] want nothing watered down give it to me
[59:11] straight tell me about it tell me where
[59:13] I'm wrong amen because judgment begins
[59:16] at the house of God Amen if we're going
[59:18] to get right this is the place we're
[59:19] going to get right amen give it to me
[59:22] straight tell me just like the prophet
[59:24] said it amen amen the Spirit and the
[59:26] bride the Bible says the spirit and the
[59:28] bride are saying the same thing and me
[59:30] the spirit and the prophet and the bride
[59:33] are all saying the same thing that's
[59:37] good yes
[59:38] sir Satan hates
[59:41] Revelation because he knows if the true
[59:44] the people can get the true revelation
[59:46] of what the true church is what she
[59:48] stands for she can do the Greater Works
[59:51] she'll be an invincible
[59:53] Army amen
[59:57] amen Satan hates revelation we love it
[1:00:01] he says with true Revelation in our
[1:00:03] lives the gates of hell can't Prevail
[1:00:05] against us but we will prevail over them
[1:00:10] amen he's trying to show you not give
[1:00:13] you just a head knowledge or an
[1:00:15] intellectual faith if you'll get quiet
[1:00:17] before God he'll show you his revelation
[1:00:22] of his word I believe that amen
[1:00:27] we look at the scripture that we
[1:00:29] read Jesus are calling him a
[1:00:32] liar This Record wasn't true what he was
[1:00:35] bearing witness of wasn't true but he
[1:00:38] was bearing witness of the
[1:00:39] light amen he was the light of the world
[1:00:43] and he said he that followeth me shall
[1:00:45] not walk in darkness but shall have the
[1:00:47] light of life he said though I bear
[1:00:50] record of myself my record is true and I
[1:00:53] love this when our scripture that we
[1:00:55] read he said I know from when I came and
[1:00:58] whether I go amen Jesus knew where he
[1:01:01] came from he knew from what he came from
[1:01:05] he knew is how he knew is why he knew
[1:01:08] his purpose amen Jesus knew who he was
[1:01:10] and he knew where he came from amen and
[1:01:13] he knew where he was going Jesus wasn't
[1:01:15] confused but he knew what he believed
[1:01:17] and that's what it takes for the bride
[1:01:19] in this hour Satan will try to get you
[1:01:21] to doubt he'll try to get you doubt who
[1:01:23] you are amen amen that's when you've got
[1:01:25] to be just as sure as Jesus was it's got
[1:01:28] to be just as real to you amen and when
[1:01:30] the Revelation comes amen there's power
[1:01:33] in that Revelation amen there's power to
[1:01:35] bind the enemy amen when you know who
[1:01:37] you are amen amen sat can't put nothing
[1:01:40] on you you know who you are you you have
[1:01:43] an identification and I'm a son that I'm
[1:01:45] a daughter of God amen amen and Satan is
[1:01:48] under your feet you have authority
[1:01:51] tonight as Sons and Daughters of
[1:01:54] God but you've got to know
[1:01:57] whom you have beli you got to know
[1:01:58] what's right you got to know what the
[1:02:00] scripture says about you your life has
[1:02:02] to be identified in that word amen you
[1:02:05] know where you came from and you know
[1:02:07] where you're going
[1:02:11] amen love the Lord
[1:02:14] tonight
[1:02:15] amen I got about 12 more
[1:02:20] pages
[1:02:22] goodness try to hurry up
[1:02:24] here so
[1:02:26] they' ask
[1:02:28] Jesus who is your father where is your
[1:02:31] father and he dealt with this his entire
[1:02:34] life brother Brenham says here he says
[1:02:36] look at Jesus away with that guy we know
[1:02:38] he's a Samaritan he's crazy will you
[1:02:40] teach us you were born in adultery you
[1:02:43] wasn't nothing but an illegitimate child
[1:02:45] to come from who's your
[1:02:47] daddy say God's your father you
[1:02:49] blasphemer why you mean to tell us but
[1:02:51] Jesus said in St John 8 he said why do
[1:02:55] you not understand understand my speech
[1:02:57] even because you cannot hear my word and
[1:03:00] he said ye are of your father the devil
[1:03:03] and the lust of your father will you do
[1:03:05] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[1:03:07] a bold nod in the truth because there is
[1:03:10] no truth in him when he speaketh a lie
[1:03:12] speaketh of his own for he is a liar and
[1:03:15] the father of it so Jesus was speaking
[1:03:17] to these Pharisees here these were these
[1:03:19] were clean men these were men that you
[1:03:21] couldn't put a finger on their lives
[1:03:23] their lives were without blemish but
[1:03:25] brother around said why because they
[1:03:27] couldn't see the message they couldn't
[1:03:29] see the word he was right there in front
[1:03:31] of him but they rejected him and the
[1:03:33] seed of the serpent will always reject
[1:03:36] the word and God will give them an
[1:03:38] opportunity he'll give them away if
[1:03:40] you'll do right amen amen won't you be
[1:03:42] accepted but it's not in them to do
[1:03:44] right because that seed of that serpent
[1:03:47] will always reject the word amen because
[1:03:49] they are are ordained to that
[1:03:54] condemnation sir second Thessalonians
[1:03:57] 2:10 with all deceivableness of
[1:04:00] unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:04:02] because they receive not the love of the
[1:04:04] truth that they might be saved and for
[1:04:08] this cause God shall send them strong
[1:04:10] delusion that they should be believe a
[1:04:13] lie and that they all might be damned by
[1:04:16] who believed not the truth but had unle
[1:04:19] pleasure in
[1:04:21] righteousness oh
[1:04:24] my brother random says here God's WRA
[1:04:27] gift he said God give them over the
[1:04:30] strong delusion to believe a lie and be
[1:04:31] damned by God said it would do it you
[1:04:33] refuse right you have to take wrong
[1:04:36] there's no other way you refuse to go
[1:04:38] right you have to go left go other some
[1:04:41] way besides right you can't go right and
[1:04:43] wrong at the same time when they refuse
[1:04:45] the Holy Ghost they refuse Christ they
[1:04:48] refuse God's program they refuse the
[1:04:50] messenger they refuse everything so
[1:04:52] therefore they're they're left in their
[1:04:54] sins and there's nothing left them but
[1:04:57] judgment so they're under this delusion
[1:05:00] amen they're ordained to condemnation

[1:05:04] this if there are damned who believe not

[1:11:57] either Bible said let the mind that was
[1:12:00] in Christ be in you and he was always
[1:12:03] about the father's business so that's
[1:12:06] the only thought that you ought to have
[1:12:08] what God said about it not what somebody
[1:12:11] else said about you got to reject those
[1:12:13] thoughts CU amen those thoughts are
[1:12:16] going to come what somebody else said

[1:13:00] Right amen don't give no place to the
[1:13:03] devil don't let him have no
[1:13:07] place oh my I got so much here let's
[1:13:10] just skip on down a little bit Jesus
[1:13:13] knew who he
[1:13:14] was it didn't matter what what what
[1:13:17] anybody said he knew who he was he knew
[1:13:20] his position and he had faith in who he
[1:13:23] was he knew what his purpose was was and
[1:13:26] he was there to do not of his own
[1:13:27] pleasure but to do the will of the
[1:13:30] father and brother Bram says here in
[1:13:32] perfect Faith he says now the only thing
[1:13:33] you have to do then is have faith in
[1:13:36] what you are have faith in what the word
[1:13:38] says you are he said and Jesus had faith
[1:13:41] in the word he said he said that he was
[1:13:43] I am the bread of life that come from
[1:13:46] God out of Heaven I am the tree of life
[1:13:48] that was from the Garden of Eden I am
[1:13:50] all these things I am that I am he said
[1:13:52] and he knew with that perfect faith that
[1:13:55] he was the anointed Messiah amen that
[1:13:57] the spirit of God was upon him he said
[1:13:59] now in myself I do nothing but it's my
[1:14:02] faith in God and God was in him and the
[1:14:04] Word was made manifest and he says this
[1:14:06] he said then when the word of God comes
[1:14:08] in you it's made manifest if you're a
[1:14:10] Believer and a Believer is amen it's the
[1:14:12] faith of God that moves in you so you
[1:14:15] got to understand your position in the
[1:14:17] scripture you got to understand where
[1:14:19] you came
[1:14:20] from and where you're
[1:14:23] going think about it
[1:14:25] Resurrection time and going to the
[1:14:28] Cross Jesus brother BR says here in the
[1:14:31] perfect Faith he says you destroy this
[1:14:33] body and I'll raise it up cuz he knowed
[1:14:37] he was the Messiah he said I the
[1:14:39] scripture says I'll not suffer my Holy
[1:14:41] One to see corruption he knowed he was
[1:14:43] the Holy One he knew that's what he was
[1:14:46] and neither will I leave his soul in
[1:14:48] hell he didn't and he knowed he had he
[1:14:51] he do it and he had confidence that that
[1:14:54] he was there to conquer both death and
[1:14:56] hell he said you destroy it if you wish
[1:14:59] you but I'll raise it back in 3 days he
[1:15:01] said oh my I have power to lay my life
[1:15:03] down and I have power to take it up
[1:15:06] again amen nobody ever said nothing like
[1:15:08] that amen amen nobody ever ever declared
[1:15:12] those words amen but there was one that
[1:15:14] knew who he was and he said you're a
[1:15:16] Christian you have right any Redemptive
[1:15:19] blessing that Jesus died for for you

[1:15:39] doubt you got to walk right on he says

[1:15:49] to believe no matter what and go right
