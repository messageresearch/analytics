[33:41] amen how many loves the Lord amen we
[33:44] just come to be able to hear a word from
[33:48] the Lord tonight I know it's a Wednesday
[33:50] night many took off this old hot day of
[33:53] working and just to take and just a lot
[33:57] of
[33:58] a lot of tired days in the summer and
[34:01] but we just appreciate the sacrifice to
[34:02] come and fulfill the scripture and and
[34:07] forsake not to assemble ourselves
[34:08] together tonight amen just to be in the
[34:11] presence of the Lord and I believe that
[34:12] there ain't ever a time that you can go
[34:14] to the house of God and and expect
[34:16] something from the Lord that God don't
[34:18] come and do something for you amen I
[34:21] believe that's the kind of God that we
[34:22] serve amen we just want to remember in
[34:25] prayer tonight sister uh Sandy and and
[34:28] her family there and she heard had she
[34:33] had given such a wonderful report of of
[34:36] her family and the services and things
[34:37] and how much that they appreciated the
[34:40] church and all that was done for them
[34:41] and uh certainly appreciate you for
[34:45] making the sacrifices in order to uh to
[34:47] do that and and matter of fact her one
[34:50] of her sons came up to me and told me he
[34:53] said you know I didn't um he said I
[34:56] didn't uh or ever been to a place where
[34:59] a man was honored like a like our father
[35:02] was honored by by you guys and so we
[35:04] just want to thank you from bottom of
[35:06] our heart and and just just appreciate
[35:09] each one and certainly remember them in
[35:11] prayer also uh April Nichols in prayer
[35:14] she's still in the hospital in Jonesboro
[35:16] Nea and uh she had had a stroke a few
[35:19] days ago and uh wasn't able to uh move
[35:23] anything on our left side and they got
[35:25] the test and things back and the doctor
[35:27] had given them a a very negative report
[35:31] initially that that it looked like that
[35:32] she may never use the left side of her
[35:34] body again and I know we have many that
[35:37] have been praying and we went by there
[35:39] yesterday with sister Judy Brother Don
[35:41] and uh some of the family that had came
[35:44] by and and the spirit of the Lord just
[35:46] moved into the room and I know that I I
[35:48] I don't know a lot of things but I know
[35:50] when God comes near and I've been in
[35:52] this in the presence of the Lord long
[35:54] enough for many times and enough to know
[35:56] when he comes by and he he hears what we
[35:59] what we pray and he knows what we have
[36:01] need of and but just a real sweet Spirit
[36:05] just moved down into the room and and I
[36:07] I believe that that the Lord will just
[36:09] continue to touch her and I think uh
[36:11] yesterday she even was able to move her
[36:14] feet a little bit and and they're
[36:16] they're going to try to get her into
[36:17] some recovery and Rehab but I believe
[36:20] that God is more than able uh to restore
[36:23] and and I just don't I don't want to see
[36:25] God just heal her body but I want him to
[36:27] rest store fully and and that that she
[36:30] would just be a a new creation in Christ
[36:33] that's all that's what we all needed you
[36:34] know we come to a place that we just
[36:36] want God to make us a new and God is
[36:39] that kind of a God and and uh I just
[36:41] appreciate the Lord for doing that if
[36:43] you remember her in prayer and maybe you
[36:45] have a need on your heart tonight just
[37:01] well praise the Lord yeah we had a
[37:03] request earlier to pray for brother
[37:05] Keith they were in Jamaica in line for
[37:07] that hurricane but she just gave a
[37:09] report that uh that all they got was
[37:11] some strong winds and things so they
[37:14] they were able to escape that and but I
[37:16] know many weren't so just remember those
[37:18] families in prayer tonight if we bow our
[37:20] heads together if you have a need just
[37:22] lift your hand to the Lord gracious
[37:23] Heavenly Father Lord we are so thankful
[37:26] Lord for all that you you've done for us
[37:28] and Lord we thank you for having a place
[37:31] that we could come Lord God a throne of
[37:34] Mercy Lord that we could call upon in
[37:36] our time of need and Lord we we ask you
[37:39] Lord that you would continue to touch
[37:41] and to heal and Lord to minister to
[37:44] those Lord that are spirits are are
[37:46] broken Lord and God I know there's many
[37:48] needs in the building tonight Lord and

[47:29] 15 verse
[47:48] 40 just read down to verse
[47:54] 49 he says there are also celestial
[47:57] bodies and bodies terrestrial but the
[47:59] glory of the celestial is one and the
[48:02] glory of the terrestrial is another
[48:04] there's one glory of the sun another
[48:06] glory of the Moon and another glory of
[48:08] the stars for one star different from
[48:11] another star in glory so also is the
[48:14] resurrection of the dead it's swn in
[48:16] corruption is raised in corruption it's
[48:19] sown in dishonor is raised in glory it
[48:22] is sown in weakness it's raised in power
[48:25] it's sown a natural body it's raised a
[48:27] spiritual body there's a natural body
[48:30] and there's a spiritual body and so it
[48:32] is written the first man Adam was made a
[48:34] living Soul the last Adam was made a
[48:36] quickening spirit how about that which
[48:39] not first which is spiritual but that
[48:41] which is natural and afterward that
[48:44] which is spiritual the first man is of
[48:47] the earth Earthly the second man is a
[48:49] Lord From
[48:51] Heaven as as is the Earthly such as they
[48:55] also they are Earthly as also the
[48:58] Heavenly such are they also that are
[49:01] Heavenly as we are
[49:03] born to wear the image of the Earthly we
[49:07] shall also bear the image of the
[49:11] Heavenly can we just bow our hearts one

[50:31] last time we was here we we ministered
[50:33] on he has given us the land
[50:37] and and we G through a lot of scriptures
[50:39] and we was looking how that God would
[50:42] tell us it's your land it's uh and we
[50:44] was looking how that that uh that uh
[50:47] it's nothing it's not something just way
[50:49] off in the future somewhere but we're
[50:52] here reaping the benefits of Calvary and
[50:55] I'd like to take a moment tonight to
[50:57] minister to your hearts amen that
[50:59] something the Lord's laid on our hearts
[51:01] the last several days on reflecting your
[51:04] inheritance and we would think on
[51:07] inheritance Brother David our minds a
[51:10] lot of times go back to to the days of
[51:13] theirs Moses and how that Abraham had
[51:16] made a promise God had made a promise
[51:18] through Abraham thank you brother that
[51:21] they was going to sojourn in a land for
[51:23] so many years 400 years and they would
[51:27] and they would that God was going to
[51:29] deliver them with a mighty
[51:33] hand and
[51:42] it not used to singing before I
[51:45] preach my mouth's dry
[51:49] but but
[51:51] God had their in had them in their mind
[51:55] the whole time
[51:58] and I thought about that brother Matt
[52:00] how we go through a lot of you just
[52:02] testifying how the Lord hey came on the
[52:05] scene in your behalf when you gave your
[52:07] heart to the Lord I and I thought that
[52:09] all the things that we go through all
[52:12] the things that transpires in our lives
[52:14] and we go down some dark roads we've all
[52:18] we' we've all came through them times in
[52:20] our lives and but I I want to believe
[52:23] tonight and I believe through the
[52:24] message of the hour that God was
[52:27] watching over his inheritance amen his
[52:30] in his Heritage from day one when you
[52:33] was in your when you was formed in your
[52:35] mother's womb God knew that you was
[52:38] there he he watched over your birth he
[52:41] watched you every day of your life amen
[52:44] cuz God had a plan for you and I believe
[52:47] it's exactly the way he did with the
[52:49] children of Israel that day amen God
[52:52] watched every time they they they took
[52:55] the taskmasters with and they beat him
[52:57] amen God watched every time they was
[52:59] down in the mud holes of Egypt making
[53:02] brick and the mortar and and sweating
[53:05] and made fun of and talked about and
[53:08] scandalized amen God was standing back
[53:11] amen don't you think for a minute that
[53:13] God wouldn't had a plan and that God was
[53:16] God wasn't going to remember everything
[53:18] they done to the children of God Amen
[53:21] God Amen has you on his mind in interest
[53:25] amen every everything that you go
[53:27] through Heen the Bible tells us Romans
[53:30] 8:28 all things work for the good that
[53:34] them that are called them that love
[53:36] their God Amen everything's working out
[53:39] for your good amen even amen the bad
[53:42] things even the Terrible
[53:45] Things in fact brother R said you know
[53:48] that trouble has got bits in his mouth
[53:52] God has put bits in the mouth of trouble
[53:55] brother Travis He he controls trouble he
[53:58] controls hell he controls the devil
[54:01] listen friends a but nothing happens to
[54:04] you by coincident I'm telling you we
[54:06] serve a powerful God he's all knowing
[54:09] he's all powerful he's everywhere
[54:12] tonight and he was there that day when
[54:15] he was repairing A Man Called
[54:18] Moses in the back side of the
[54:21] desert beating everything out of him to
[54:24] a place where he could find used Moses
[54:27] to go down as well probably God would
[54:30] call it as a oneman
[54:32] Invasion to go down and take over Egypt
[54:37] and here comes Moses what a
[54:39] paradox that a man and his
[54:43] wife on a mule or camel going down to a
[54:47] great nation of Egypt with all their
[54:50] artillery with all their Warriors all
[54:53] their soldiers with all their strength
[54:55] with all their power power but here come
[54:58] a
[55:00] man that was a reflecting
[55:04] home that was going to reflect his
[55:07] inheritance and he goes down not under
[55:09] the altar not under the plan of Moses
[55:12] but under the plan of almighty God and
[55:15] he told him to go down there and begin
[55:18] to tell pharaoh to let my people go
[55:23] could you imagine what kind of paradox
[55:25] that must have been amen as they went
[55:27] down no doubt they was made fun of but
[55:30] that laugh would begin to stop when they
[55:33] begin to see there was power and
[55:36] authority behind the voice of
[55:41] Moses
[55:44] Hallelujah didn't mean to spend much
[55:46] time on that tonight
[55:48] but but there was a god orchestrating
[55:52] this out am been to a place where for
[55:56] Pharaoh family told Moses to get
[56:00] out take all that you got don't keep
[56:04] nothing behind take everything you got
[56:07] and get out of
[56:10] Egypt and there goes Israel out of
[56:14] bondage headed to the promised
[56:17] land and there comes a place of the Red
[56:20] Sea and and here God moves again in
[56:24] their behalf
[56:27] and then there comes an enemy in like a
[56:29] flood but God raises up a standard
[56:32] against the enemy and all night long but
[56:35] the next morning at the rising of the
[56:37] sun brother Mark that God begins a move
[56:42] God begins to move and here come brother
[56:44] jareda wind of Yahweh from the heavens
[56:47] and begin to divide the sea and here
[56:50] goes am been not just a church of 200
[56:53] people but we're talking about a group
[56:56] of of two million people walking across
[56:59] on dry
[57:01] ground Hallelujah could you imagine what
[57:04] it sounded like amen when they got on
[57:06] the other side and the waters begin to
[57:10] come back upon their enemy and they
[57:12] looked back and seen that their enemy
[57:14] was
[57:17] dead you think Grace Tabernacle gets
[57:21] loud could you imagine when maram
[57:24] grabbed a tamarine
[57:26] Moses be to sing a new
[57:30] song they were screaming and shouting
[57:33] and
[57:36] rejoicing Hallelujah now they're looking
[57:39] back and seeing their enemy is
[57:42] dead and they begin to reflect home they
[57:46] begin to praise God they begin to
[57:51] Rejoice
[57:54] my don't be afraid to Rejoice
[57:59] tonight if they can
[58:01] Rejoice over a Red Sea
[58:05] conference Grace Tabernacle are you
[58:07] hearing me tonight am bet we got
[58:09] something to shout about if they can
[58:12] shout over that what about you and I
[58:15] amen we're been redeemed by the blood of
[58:17] an lamb an innocent lamb amen amen he
[58:21] became me that I could become him by
[58:24] grace
[58:28] and then they s joone
[58:30] further and Moses began to send some
[58:32] spies over and the spies went over and
[58:37] spied out the
[58:39] land and when they begin to come
[58:42] back maybe brother Wesley
[58:47] that the 10 spies was a little ahead of
[58:50] the others too and they got back to
[58:54] camp and they was for fatigued and they
[58:56] was wore out and it was hot that day and
[59:00] we worked hard that day and they had a
[59:04] church service at Wednesday night and
[59:07] they all come together
[59:09] and here was 10 that came back and no
[59:13] doubt could you imagine what kind of
[59:14] church service that must have been as
[59:17] they was sitting back waiting for this
[59:19] report they've been waiting to hear to
[59:22] see amen what kind of land this was and
[59:26] and they came back to that church
[59:27] service on Wednesday night amen and
[59:30] these 10 spies come back and begin to
[59:35] Bear the image of the
[59:37] Earthly has I begin to say you brother
[59:40] Amos there's no way there is no way we
[59:44] can take the
[59:46] land there's Giants that inhabit that
[59:49] land we look like grasshoppers in the
[59:52] side of those kings
[59:57] this is just me but maybe Joshua and
[1:00:00] Caleb came in a a littleit later got
[1:00:03] there a little late but they was packing
[1:00:05] some
[1:00:07] evidence that God's Not Dead He's Alive
[1:00:12] they been packing some
[1:00:14] evidence and no doubt sister Debbie they
[1:00:16] was wore out they was fatigued from the
[1:00:19] journey but when they got to the church
[1:00:21] service at Wednesday night they begin to
[1:00:24] testify they be we begin to Bear the
[1:00:27] image of the Heavenly as they begin to
[1:00:31] go beyond the Flesh and begin to talk
[1:00:34] from the spirit the scripture said there
[1:00:36] was another Spirit within Caleb and that
[1:00:40] spirit amen that bore the image of the
[1:00:43] Heavenly begin to scream out

[1:00:55] why why ain't you rejoicing tonight
[1:00:58] because they begin to listen to the 10
[1:01:00] senses of the Flesh and the spirit and

[1:01:06] lie but Joshua and K said hold
[1:01:10] on I'm here to tell you look at these
