[26:14] see
[26:16] [Music]
[26:18] him there
[26:20] [Music]
[26:24] for your glory.
[26:28] Even when you told him to lay his eyes
[26:33] on the altar,
[26:36] you found out that he didn't love the
[26:39] promise more than.

[26:55] ask the men not to trust him.
[27:00] [Music]
[27:08] There's a broken world around us quickly
[27:13] falling
[27:16] to see so loud we can hear you calling
[27:23] it
[27:25] so loud
[27:28] or are we just too proud to receive your
[27:32] mercies
[27:34] or to bring you glory?
[27:39] Even when you tell us to lay our eyes on
[27:44] the altar,
[27:46] will you find out that we don't love the
[27:50] promise more than you?
[27:55] Do we truly
[27:57] believe
[27:59] that you'll provide a real
[28:06] wea
[28:09] [Music]
[28:21] in your life that you keep holding?
[28:26] The desires of this world will keep you
[28:31] drowning.
[28:35] If you could only see God's gifts are
[28:39] greater than your needs
[28:42] or desires.
[28:45] He is your provider.
[28:50] Even when he tells us to lay our eyes on
[28:54] the altar,
[28:57] when we find a bride who doesn't love
[29:00] the promise for them,
[29:04] [Music]
[29:05] Lord, we truly
[29:08] believe
[29:10] that you'll provide a ramp.
[29:14] God, help me to completely
[29:19] trust you,
[29:22] Lord. I do. I do completely
[29:27] trust you.

[43:38] come.
[43:40] Let it live in me. This is my prayer.
[43:46] This is my plea. Let the worshippers
[43:50] arise.
[43:54] How many can rise to a call to worship
[43:56] this morning? Yes, my Lord,
[44:02] I'm surrendering my all.
[44:06] Oh my Lord, I surrender to the king.
[44:13] Father, I hear it growing louder. It's a
[44:17] song of your redeemed as the saints of
[44:21] every nation are awakening to sing. From
[44:27] my heart there comes an anthem. How many
[44:30] has that song ringing from your heart
[44:32] this morning? Lord, this is my song. I
[44:36] sing to my king. Let the worippers
[44:40] arise.
[44:45] Let the sons and daughters sing.
[44:48] [Applause]
[44:51] I'm surrendering my all
[44:55] my
[44:58] surrender to the king. Let the
[45:02] worshippers arise.
[45:05] Oh yes, my lord.
[45:08] Let the sons and daughters sing.
[45:13] Oh, I'm surrendering my all.
[45:19] Yes, my Lord. I surrender to the King.
[45:25] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[45:27] clap of praise this morning? I said,
[45:29] give the Lord a hand clap of praise this
[45:31] morning. Isn't he worthy of it? We're
[45:33] talking about the King of Kings. Amen.
[45:36] He's worthy of our praise. I mean, we
[45:38] are the stones. odd stones, every shaped
[45:41] stone that there was that was made that
[45:43] built Solomon's temple. But here we are
[45:45] today and we come in all shapes and
[45:48] sizes. But one thing those stones had in
[45:50] common, brother Marcus, they are lively
[45:52] stones. How many are alive? How many are
[45:53] alive this morning? We're lively stones
[45:56] built up a spiritual house to make a
[45:58] sacrifice unto God. I'm not a dead
[46:00] stone. I'm a lively stone made by God to
[46:04] worship my God. Amen. How many lively
[46:07] stones do we have here this morning?
[46:09] Amen. Man, you may as well be alive. I
[46:11] couldn't think of a better place to be
[46:12] alive. We're in the house of God. Amen.
[46:14] We come to worship the Lord. You love
[46:16] the Lord this morning. Somebody turn
[46:18] around and somebody say, "I'm a lively
[46:20] stone." Amen. Say it like you mean it.
[46:22] I'm a lively stone. Brother David, I'm a
[46:24] lively stone. Amen. I come to worship
[46:27] God. You love the Lord. Amen. Isn't he
[46:29] wonderful? Brother Bam said, "We expect
[46:31] God to do something for us." He said,
[46:33] "But he can't do nothing for us if we
[46:35] come in drooping around like somebody
[46:37] half dead." He said he wants a lively
[46:39] church. He wants members in there to be
[46:41] lively stones built up in the house of
[46:43] faith. So how many come expecting God to
[46:46] do something for them? I said how many
[46:48] come expecting God? Otherwise, why are
[46:50] you here? We come expecting God to do
[46:53] something for us. So if I'm expecting
[46:55] him to do something, I'm not going to
[46:57] droop around. I'm a lively stone. I'm
[46:59] built up to sacrifice unto my God. I
[47:02] want to find my place in the temple of
[47:04] God. Let every stone that has a breath
[47:07] praise ye the Lord. Let every voice cry
[47:09] out this morning. Amen. We love the
[47:11] Lord. You love the Lord this morning. I
[47:13] say he's wonderful.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of all the praise. Amen.
[47:18] Before we open the word, we just want to
[47:20] greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[47:22] Welcome everybody in the house of the
[47:24] Lord. God bless you. God bless our
[47:26] visitors and uh church folk alike. All
[47:29] the home folk. Amen. We just love the
[47:32] Lord. Amen. just love to to come and
[47:35] gather in the word and maybe you have
[47:37] something on your heart want to remember
[47:38] our meetings that are coming up be
[47:40] praying about that. Uh brother Andrew
[47:43] he's at brother Fred Mullen's meeting
[47:45] this morning and uh and he'll be there
[47:48] Wednesday night to open our meeting up
[47:50] at 7 o'clock on Wednesday night. And so
[47:53] we're really looking forward to a real
[47:55] outpouring of the Holy Ghost. uh brother
[47:57] Jonathan Martin will be uh following
[48:00] brother Wayne Lawson, brother David
[48:02] Siler and so we we're looking forward to
[48:04] having a real uh time in the Lord. How
[48:06] many's looking forward to that? How many

[48:14] help if that woman prays that God's
[48:16] going to do something. How many will
[48:17] join Sister Sandy and brother David
[48:19] Paul. Amen. Be praying about the
[48:21] meetings. God bless y'all. Amen. And
[48:23] fasting.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I just I believe we ought to be
[48:27] prepared.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come expecting God to do great
[48:31] things. Amen. We don't make sacrifices
[48:33] just to uh just for no reason. I I
[48:36] expect the supernatural. Amen. One of
[48:38] these days it'll be the last meeting we
[48:39] ever have. Amen. And I expect it to be a
[48:42] great one. Amen. So, we just come in
[48:45] expectation of the Lord. How many come
[48:46] in expectation this morning? I believe
[48:48] that God is more than able to do
[48:51] abundantly more than we could ever ask
[48:53] or think. But if you have something on
[48:54] your heart, won't we just approach him
[48:56] before we read the word of God, ask him
[48:59] to come? Gracious heavenly father. Lord,
[49:01] we thank you for all that you do for us.
[49:04] Lord, we welcome you in this service
[49:06] this morning. God, we come as a body of
[49:09] believers. And Lord, we just ask you,
[49:11] Lord, that you would help us to put
[49:12] ourselves aside. And God, may you just
[49:15] come and pour your spirit out according
[49:17] to your word. God, may you anoint it
[49:19] Aresh, Lord. Bring it alive, Lord, that
[49:22] we'd leave this place being fed and
[49:24] edified and strengthened by the word of
[49:27] God, Lord. And may we know that we've
[49:28] been in your presence, Lord. We'll be
[49:30] careful to give you the glory for all
[49:32] that's done and said, we ask in Jesus
[49:34] name. Amen. Amen. We just want to invite
[49:38] you to the scripture this morning, uh,
[49:40] to the book of Joshua. We're going to
[49:42] read out of the first chapter and and uh
[49:46] in the first verse Joshua the first
[49:48] chapter and the first verse and we'll um
[49:51] try to uh we had started in on Wednesday
[49:55] night and and uh was really just really
[49:57] enjoy the presence of the Lord and and
[50:00] uh we we just want to be able to kind of
[50:02] uh go to the next phase of that this
[50:04] morning and we just trust the Lord knows
[50:07] all things. Amen. You love the Lord.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Joshua the first chapter in the
[50:11] first verse, Bible says, "Now after the
[50:14] death of Moses, the servant of the Lord,
[50:15] it came to pass that the Lord spake unto
[50:19] Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses's
[50:21] minister, saying, Moses, my servant, is
[50:24] dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this
[50:27] Jordan, thou and all this people, unto
[50:29] the land which I do give to them, even
[50:31] to the children of Israel, and every
[50:33] place that the soul of your foot shall
[50:36] tread upon, that have I given unto you,
[50:39] as I said unto Moses. We'll just allow
[50:43] you to take your seats this morning. And
[50:45] I'd like to speak on on on the walk of
[50:48] grace. He said, "Every place they put
[50:50] their shall tread upon. that have I
[50:53] given unto you as I said to Moses the
[50:55] walk of grace this morning Wednesday
[50:57] night we had uh speaking on Lot being
[51:00] called out of Sodom and and remember how
[51:02] the angel had came in and uh and had
[51:05] called him uh to arise and take your
[51:07] family out of this place uh uh before
[51:10] that judgment would strike and you know
[51:12] if um and the angel had given a warning
[51:14] unto Lot and his family lest thou be
[51:17] consumed by judgment and of course we
[51:20] didn't get all the way through but we
[51:21] know according to the scripture that uh
[51:23] that they lingered there even after the
[51:25] warning of the angel that uh that they
[51:28] lingered. But it was the mercy of God
[51:30] that took them by the hand and led them
[51:32] out of destruction and out of judgment.
[51:35] I I always thought that's a wonderful
[51:36] thing because the Bible said he gave
[51:38] them a warning. He he told them they
[51:40] ought to leave. He told them judgment
[51:42] was coming, but because they lingered,
[51:44] the Bible says, "So the man took them by
[51:46] the hand and led them out of the city."
[51:48] I thought, "Isn't that something?" And
[51:49] it wasn't them getting a hold of mercy,
[51:50] but it was mercy that got a hold of
[51:52] them. And said, but in the time that
[51:54] judgment was going to strike, mercy took
[51:56] a hold of their hand and he brought them
[51:58] uh out of that place and led them past
[52:00] persecution and past death. And uh you
[52:02] know, the Bible tells us that that same
[52:04] thing uh uh would happen in this day.
[52:07] Jesus says, he said, "The same day that
[52:08] Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire
[52:10] and brimstone from heaven and destroyed
[52:13] them all." And then Jesus said, "But
[52:15] even thus shall it be in the day when
[52:17] the son of man is revealed." So here he
[52:19] makes a prophecy of the end time in Luke
[52:21] 17:30 that in the day when the son of
[52:24] man is revealed uh the same thing that
[52:26] happened in the day of of Lot or the
[52:29] days of Sodom happened today there, you
[52:31] know, there was a question that was
[52:32] asked in the in questions and answers uh
[52:35] that that said, "Will the bride go
[52:37] through persecution like the early
[52:38] apostolic church did?" I love uh brother
[52:40] Bam according to the scripture. He said,
[52:42] "No, the next thing for the bride is the
[52:44] rapture." He said, "See, because we're
[52:46] at the promised land. We're at the
[52:47] border. You" He said, "See that that's
[52:49] where we are. We're we're at the we're
[52:51] we're at this place uh of coming out of
[52:54] this world. So, they won't go through
[52:55] persecution. She's not going to go
[52:57] through judgment. Uh but the next thing
[52:58] for the bride of Jesus Christ is is a
[53:00] rapture." And uh you know, you realize
[53:02] that he would say this at the revealing
[53:04] of the son of man. How many knows what
[53:06] that means? that the revealing of the
[53:07] son of man uh that that that uh that
[53:10] that they would come at that very day on
[53:12] that same day uh that they would that
[53:14] judgment would strike the earth. You
[53:15] remember when Jesus came I may as well
[53:16] just lay it in here but when Jesus came
[53:18] to the earth he came in three names. He
[53:20] came in the son of God, the son of man,
[53:22] and the son of David. He he's been
[53:24] called all three things. And so he was
[53:26] in three sons names. But but the son of
[53:28] man we we realize according to the
[53:30] scripture the son of man which which
[53:32] meant a prophet. Ezekiel was called a
[53:34] son of man. the the prophets of old were
[53:36] called the son of man. They had a son of
[53:38] man ministry as a prophet. And so uh but
[53:40] when he lived on the earth, you notice
[53:42] that Jesus never said, "I am the son of
[53:44] God." Everybody said that about him. The
[53:46] disciples said it. The council said it.
[53:48] Uh even the devil would say it. If thou
[53:50] be the son of God, then then then then
[53:53] uh uh do call this or call angels. When
[53:55] he was on the cross, he would say, "If
[53:57] thou be the son of God, take yourself
[53:59] off this cross." And uh during his
[54:01] trial, remember they would they would
[54:03] call him the son of God. But even when
[54:05] the high priest would ask him on trial,
[54:07] "Do you not say that you're the son of
[54:08] God?" And and Jesus Jesus immediately
[54:11] referred him to Daniel the 7th chapter
[54:13] to the uh to the vision of Daniel. He
[54:16] said, "You will see the son of man
[54:18] sitting at the right hand of divine
[54:19] power. He will come amongst the clouds
[54:22] of the heaven." So here, although he
[54:24] would say, "I am, but you will see the
[54:25] son of man." Notice that he's always
[54:28] referring to himself as the son of man.
[54:30] And uh even remember when the woman came
[54:31] to him, I'm just laying a foundation,
[54:33] but when the woman came to him and she
[54:35] was asking for healing, she said, "Thou
[54:37] son of David, have mercy on me." And the
[54:39] Bible says he wouldn't even respond to
[54:40] her, but he ignored her until finally
[54:42] she said, "Lord, have mercy upon me."
[54:44] And then he turned to her. See, because
[54:46] he wasn't in the office of son of David
[54:48] or in the office of of son of God.
[54:51] Although he came in all three of those.
[54:52] He was all three of those. He always has
[54:54] been and he always will be. But the
[54:56] office that he was in, he said he was as
[54:58] the son of man. Many called him that
[55:00] name. But whenever Jesus referred to
[55:02] himself, many times he would use this
[55:04] word, I am the son of man. Actually, the
[55:06] son of man is is mentioned in the New
[55:08] Testament 82 times. He says the son of
[55:11] man. The son of man. The son of man. So,
[55:13] so, so there was a the the importance of
[55:15] him was recognized in the ministry of
[55:18] Jesus while he was on the earth. He was
[55:20] a God prophet. Anybody know that? He was
[55:22] a God prophet. And because a prophet is
[55:24] one that brings the word, it was a
[55:26] restorer of the word that brought the
[55:28] word of the Lord to the people. And so
[55:31] here Jesus being that as a God prophet,
[55:33] he was known as the son of man just like
[55:35] the prophets of old were called son of
[55:37] man. Here Jesus was in this son of man
[55:39] ministry. And so that's the reason said
[55:42] that's the reason he could not be the
[55:43] son of God there because he was the son
[55:46] of man because Moses said the Lord your
[55:48] God shall raise up a prophet like an
[55:50] unto me. So because Moses made that and
[55:53] made that statement, God is going to
[55:55] raise up a prophet like an unto me. Then
[55:57] when Jesus came, that's why Jesus would
[55:59] call himself the son of man. It was not
[56:01] to to diminish his gift or to diminish
[56:03] who he was, but it was actually to
[56:05] positionally place him in that body of
[56:07] believers as this son of man ministry.
[56:10] And so this is so the because the word
[56:12] came to the prophets. He said he was the
[56:13] word. He was the fullness of the word.
[56:15] He was a son of man. He was a God
[56:17] prophet. He was the fullness of of the
[56:19] Godhead. Bodily dwelt in him. But then
[56:21] after he left the earth and now for the
[56:24] past 2,000 years that he has been known
[56:27] as the son of God, as the spirit of God
[56:30] that's moving amongst the church. So, so
[56:32] over these 2,000 years, brother Jarb,
[56:34] we've been experiencing that the world
[56:36] has been experiencing that same son of
[56:38] God here. He would he would come as the
[56:40] Holy Ghost of this Holy Spirit ministry.
[56:43] But then in the millennium, he would be
[56:44] the son of David that would sit up on
[56:46] the throne. uh o of the Jews. So, so, so
[56:49] he said, "We believe all the
[56:50] scriptures." So, then watch what Luke
[56:52] says or Jesus says in Luke. He said, "At
[56:55] the end of this church age that we're
[56:56] living in, the son of man would be
[56:58] revealed again in the same manner that
[57:00] it was in Sodom." In other words, he
[57:02] would come as in the same prophetic
[57:04] gift. He would be revealed again in the
[57:06] last days. And the and Jesus said in the
[57:09] same day that the son of man is
[57:10] revealed. You see what what that is?
[57:12] that same prophetic gift, that same uh
[57:15] uh that same God prophet, that same uh
[57:17] that same uh uh gift that came to the
[57:19] earth when it's revealed in the last
[57:21] days, then fire and brimstone would fall
[57:23] upon the earth. Now, it's important to
[57:25] know this that when Jesus said in that
[57:27] same day, that word day uh come from the
[57:30] Greek word hammer and in in context that
[57:33] Greek that Greek word actually means
[57:36] it's referring to a period of time. So
[57:38] when Jesus said in the day that the son
[57:40] of man is revealed, in that same day
[57:43] fire and brimstone fell or will fall
[57:45] upon the earth, he actually said in the
[57:47] days of Lot. And then he said in the day
[57:48] of the son of man, which is actually
[57:50] referring to a period of time. So he's
[57:52] showing us that in the day when that son
[57:55] of man ministry would be or the son of
[57:57] man would be revealed. There's coming
[57:58] another day, not just when he was on the
[58:00] earth, but there's coming a day that
[58:01] that that that son of man would be
[58:03] revealed unto the people. And in that
[58:06] same day, fire and judgment would fall
[58:08] upon the earth. Said, see, so what's
[58:10] next for the world? Whenever you see
[58:12] that present and you see it being
[58:14] revealed in this age, it shows us that
[58:16] the next thing to happen in this world
[58:17] is judgment. How many knows that? So the
[58:20] next thing we're going to see is
[58:21] judgment upon the earth. But before
[58:23] judgment strikes the earth, the Bible
[58:25] tells us that the bride must go in a
[58:28] rapture. So before there's ever
[58:30] judgment, before there's ever I think
[58:32] sometimes we just need a reminder that
[58:34] before anything strikes the earth, that
[58:36] the bride is going to be gone. The bride
[58:38] will be lifted. In Revelations 18, it
[58:40] said there will come judgment. There
[58:41] would come destruction. It would be the
[58:43] destruction of that Roman Catholicism
[58:46] system that was built up and and all of
[58:48] her daughters and that denominational
[58:49] spirit that has been ruling men and
[58:52] binding men away from the presence of
[58:54] the reality of a living God. and all of
[58:56] that would be judged and burned and
[58:58] destroyed underfoot. But the next time
[59:00] you see the bride of Jesus Christ uh uh
[59:03] in the Bible is in Revelations the 19th
[59:05] chapter when John said, "And I heard a a
[59:08] voice that was thundering out of heaven,
[59:10] a voice of a great multitude, and they
[59:12] were rejoicing saying, hallelujah, for
[59:15] the Lord God omnipotent reignth." You
[59:17] say, "What were they rejoicing about?"
[59:19] He said they cried out, "Let us be glad
[59:21] and rejoice for the and give honor to
[59:24] him for the marriage of the lamb has
[59:25] come and his wife hath made herself
[59:28] ready." There's coming a day of
[59:30] rejoicing because the bride and the
[59:32] husband had be united in their home.
[59:34] When they were brought together and here
[59:36] he said they saw this, brother B said
[59:38] there ain't nothing that would be able
[59:39] to hinder it. There ain't nothing in the
[59:40] world that'll hinder the catching away
[59:42] of the bride of Jesus Christ. Can I just
[59:44] say that again? I know the devil don't
[59:46] like it. There ain't nothing in this
[59:47] world that can hinder the catching away
[59:50] of the bride of Jesus Christ. I know how
[59:52] the world is today. They don't believe
[59:54] in a rapture. They don't believe in in a
[59:56] moving of the spirit of God. They don't
[59:58] believe in a reality of God. They
[1:00:00] believe in a Bible that's a Bible of
[1:00:01] history. They believe in fairy tales and
[1:00:04] a fairy tale Jesus and a fairy tale God
[1:00:06] and a fairy tale gospel to make people
[1:00:08] feel good so they can feel like they're
[1:00:10] a part of something. But I believe that
[1:00:12] there's a real church that's a spiritual
[1:00:14] church that's been called out of
[1:00:16] denominationalism and called out of Leoa
[1:00:19] and into a place with God where the
[1:00:21] rapture of the church will take place
[1:00:23] and there ain't nothing going to hinder
[1:00:25] it. Brother said ain't nothing here we
[1:00:27] are in this lessian age. He said and in
[1:00:29] this condition I don't see anything that
[1:00:31] could hinder the church at this time the
[1:00:33] coming of the Lord Jesus outside the
[1:00:36] readiness of his church.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; And another place he said the Gentiles
[1:00:39] have been called out. How many knows
[1:00:41] that according to the Bible, the
[1:00:42] Gentiles have been called out, the bride
[1:00:44] is ready, and the rapture is at hand. It
[1:00:48] shows how close we are to living in a
[1:00:50] rapture time.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; We're living in a rapture age. How many
[1:00:53] believe that it's a time of exodus?
[1:00:55] That's why That's why it's so hard to
[1:00:58] get into the spirit because it's a time
[1:01:00] of exodus. That's why there's so much of
[1:01:02] a burden on the church. That's why it's
[1:01:04] such a fight to come in the house of
[1:01:06] God, brother Marah, and make an
[1:01:07] atmosphere where God can come and
[1:01:09] minister because it's a time of exodus
[1:01:11] and the burden has been has been built
[1:01:13] upon the church of the living God.
[1:01:15] What's Satan trying to do in this age?
[1:01:17] He's trying to press you down, where you
[1:01:19] can't break through, where you can't
[1:01:20] break free, where you can't get anywhere
[1:01:22] with God. He wants you so bound up by
[1:01:24] theology that you can know everything
[1:01:26] but don't know God. You can know every
[1:01:28] answer but don't know God. But friends,
[1:01:30] let me tell you, the spirit of God has
[1:01:32] came in this age to break down the
[1:01:34] bounds of Satan, the bondage of Satan,
[1:01:37] and allow people to have a relationship
[1:01:40] with God and with God alone. That means
[1:01:42] you don't have to go through me to get
[1:01:43] to God. You don't have to go through a
[1:01:45] prophet. You don't have to go through a
[1:01:47] priest. You don't have to go through no
[1:01:48] man. There ain't no mediator between a
[1:01:50] man and God except for the one man,
[1:01:52] Christ Jesus.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; And he has made a way that you can have
[1:01:56] a relationship with God.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; It's a time of Exodus. That's why it's
[1:02:00] hard to break through. So pressured up
[1:02:02] and people are so burdened down. You
[1:02:04] know why the prophet said? Because the
[1:02:05] last plague that came upon Egypt was
[1:02:07] what? It was death. Before they exodus
[1:02:10] out of Egypt, the last plague was death.
[1:02:12] Said it'll be the same thing in this
[1:02:13] age. At the time of Exodus, the last
[1:02:15] plague that'll come upon the church. It
[1:02:17] won't be a natural death. It'll be a
[1:02:19] spiritual death. That's your Bible.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual death that come upon
[1:02:23] the church. said now that because
[1:02:25] they're into this spiritual place, you
[1:02:27] know, can I just tell you where
[1:02:28] spiritual death comes from?
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you cuz that spirit's here
[1:02:30] this morning. I want to put him in his
[1:02:32] place. I don't bow down to no devil.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Spiritual death comes from rejecting the
[1:02:36] word of God.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; So when you hear the word and something
[1:02:39] on the inside of you rejects the word
[1:02:41] that God's speaking to you, it brings
[1:02:42] spiritual death to you.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; That's where spiritual death comes from.
[1:02:46] Says spiritual death in the church
[1:02:48] world, brother Mark here, it's come
[1:02:49] around this world and now people have
[1:02:51] lost their worship. They've lost their
[1:02:54] zeal to serve God. They've lost they
[1:02:56] don't know what it means. See, well, I I
[1:02:58] worship God. I might throw up my hands
[1:02:59] and all this and but it ain't about
[1:03:01] emotion. It's about spiritual worship.
[1:03:03] It's about getting to a place with God
[1:03:05] that you don't even know who you are and
[1:03:07] you forget your own name. That you can
[1:03:08] enter enter into a place with God, not
[1:03:11] just to feel good, but allow God to live
[1:03:13] on the inside of a human being and the
[1:03:15] old nature to be gone away and a new
[1:03:16] nature take its place.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Then you can enter into a spiritual
[1:03:20] worship. enter in to the praise of God.
[1:03:23] But friends, let me tell you, the devil
[1:03:25] may be trying to put it out, but can I
[1:03:26] just say this freely this morning? God's
[1:03:28] church is a spiritual church.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; God's church is a spiritual church.
[1:03:34] Don't you never deny that.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Wednesday, we were speaking or when
[1:03:38] Jesus about Jesus when he said that he
[1:03:40] would call to any man that would come
[1:03:42] after me, let him deny himself. Deny his
[1:03:45] own thoughts, deny his own feelings,
[1:03:47] deny his own mission, emotions. What's
[1:03:49] it mean to deny yourself? Said, "Let him
[1:03:51] deny himself and follow me." But that
[1:03:53] call, it goes beyond the flesh. It's a
[1:03:55] call to a spiritual walk.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Said, "So deny himself and follow me."
[1:04:00] Not a not a flesh walk. Not a but a
[1:04:02] spiritual walk. If you never get a
[1:04:04] spiritual walk, right, you don't have to
[1:04:05] worry about the flesh. It follows after
[1:04:07] the spirit.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; It reflects after what's going on the
[1:04:11] inside. So here it's a spiritual walk.
[1:04:13] And that So here God is calling us to
[1:04:16] follow after the spirit of God. I love
[1:04:18] how Peter gives a proper response to
[1:04:20] that scripture. Jesus said, "If any man
[1:04:22] will come, let him come deny himself."
[1:04:24] Peter Peter gives this response in the
[1:04:25] book of Mark. He said, "Lord, we have
[1:04:28] left all and have followed thee."
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many can answer like Peter
[1:04:33] did.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, I've left all and I How many's got
[1:04:35] that same answer?
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; How many's got that testimony that Peter
[1:04:38] had? They could say that with an open
[1:04:40] heart and say, "Lord, I have left all
[1:04:42] and followed thee. I I know you made a
[1:04:44] call that any man that would come after
[1:04:46] deny himself and follow me. But I want
[1:04:48] you to know I've left all and I'm
[1:04:50] following you. That's the testimony that
[1:04:52] Peter had.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Wasn't a bad place to be because Jesus
[1:04:55] answered him. He said, "I say to you,
[1:04:57] there's no man that has ever left a
[1:04:59] house or brother or sister or father or
[1:05:01] mother or wife or children or lands for
[1:05:03] my sake in the gospel." But he shall
[1:05:05] receive a hundfold in this time houses
[1:05:07] and brothers and sisters and mothers and
[1:05:09] children and lands with persecutions and
[1:05:12] in the world to come he shall receive
[1:05:14] eternal life.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; So following Jesus comes with an eternal
[1:05:19] reward.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; My isn't it wonderful? You see what it
[1:05:21] means to follow him. You say, "Brother
[1:05:22] Matt, what do I do?" You surrender to
[1:05:24] your own will
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; and follow after him.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; You know, I found this to be true
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; that you can either be used of God or
[1:05:31] you can be used of the devil. Amen.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; That's just a subtle truth.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; You can be used of God or you can be
[1:05:38] used of the devil. You say, "Well, how
[1:05:39] how is that?" But it's just whatever you
[1:05:41] surrender yourself to. How many how many
[1:05:43] knows that's true? You can surrender
[1:05:45] yourself to the devil. The devil can use
[1:05:46] you. He can make a wreck out of your
[1:05:48] life. He can he can turn you into all
[1:05:49] sorts of things, but you can take that
[1:05:51] same man and surrender him to God and
[1:05:53] God can use him. He can do the
[1:05:55] supernatural. He he he he can he can
[1:05:58] have strength to be able to lead and
[1:06:00] help and and and work and do the things
[1:06:02] of God. The same man that would lead
[1:06:03] people in destruction can lead people
[1:06:05] into lie just because he would surrender
[1:06:07] himself to the right thing. When you get
[1:06:09] Christ in your heart, you know what it
[1:06:10] means to have Christ in your heart? It's
[1:06:12] to have the Holy Spirit. Christ and the
[1:06:14] Holy Spirit are the same thing.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Says to have Christ in your heart, what
[1:06:18] it is, it's that anointing. Christ in
[1:06:20] you is anointing you. But remember says,
[1:06:22] see, and when Christ has anointed you,
[1:06:24] then he can use you to do anything he
[1:06:26] wants to use you in because he's you're
[1:06:28] in the body and you're subject to
[1:06:30] whatever God wants to use you for.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; He can use you for any gift. He said he
[1:06:34] can lead you. He don't The Holy Spirit
[1:06:36] is a being. It's God. It's God in you.
[1:06:38] The person of God that's lit your entire
[1:06:41] being. It's changed you. And now you're
[1:06:43] a new creature. And now God can use you.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Say, "You mean you mean God can use me?"
[1:06:49] I know this. I can read through the
[1:06:50] Bible. Well, I can find men all through
[1:06:52] the Bible that God led because they
[1:06:54] surrendered theirel to God.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; And I don't have to preach them all, but
[1:06:58] you know it's true. What was it that
[1:07:00] what was it that caused Elijah to go up
[1:07:02] Mount Carmel and challenge all those 450
[1:07:05] prophets and say, "But if you're God,
[1:07:07] let the God thatth by fire be God." He
[1:07:09] was led of God to do that. What called
[1:07:11] Moses to go into Egypt and call the
[1:07:13] children of Israel out of Egypt? He was
[1:07:15] led of God. He was a man that was led of
[1:07:18] God. What caus what caused Noah to go
[1:07:20] out and build an ark and everybody make
[1:07:22] fun of him and dedicate his life to
[1:07:24] doing something that seemed so odd to
[1:07:25] the rest of the world because he was a
[1:07:27] man that was led of God? What caused
[1:07:29] Abraham to leave his family and sojourn
[1:07:31] in a strange country and walk into a
[1:07:33] land looking for a city that he never
[1:07:35] even could lay eyes on with his natural
[1:07:37] eye? But still yet he kept walking
[1:07:39] towards it because he was a man that was
[1:07:41] led of God. What caused Shamgar to go
[1:07:44] out and face a thousand Philistines with
[1:07:46] an ox code defending his family because
[1:07:48] he was a man that was led of God? What
[1:07:50] caused David to walk down in the into
[1:07:52] that valley of Elaw and stand before a
[1:07:55] giant that was far greater and didn't
[1:07:56] have the ability to destroy him because
[1:07:58] he was a man that was led of God. What
[1:08:01] caused Solomon to inhabit the the the
[1:08:03] throne of David when he was just a boy
[1:08:05] and didn't have the ability to lead the
[1:08:07] children of God? It was because he was a
[1:08:09] man led of God. It don't matter if
[1:08:11] they're old. It don't matter if they're
[1:08:13] young. It don't matter if they're
[1:08:14] equipped, if they're ready, if they're
[1:08:17] big, if they're little, if they're great
[1:08:18] or if they're small. If a man can
[1:08:20] surrender himself to God, God can use
[1:08:23] him to do great things. They are men
[1:08:25] that were led of God. I thought, my
[1:08:27] isn't it wonderful that God can use men?
[1:08:29] But let me tell you, my favorite one, it
[1:08:31] was Apostle Paul. You know why? Because
[1:08:33] whenever God started leading Paul, Paul
[1:08:35] wasn't nothing but a sinner. My Bible
[1:08:38] told me that Paul, he was on his way to
[1:08:40] Damascus. He was going to kill
[1:08:42] Christians. And while he was on his way
[1:08:44] to Damascus, Jesus met him on the road
[1:08:46] and changed his very desire. He he he
[1:08:49] didn't say he didn't take him to
[1:08:50] Damascus. You know, he still went to
[1:08:52] Damascus after Jesus met him. But the
[1:08:54] difference was when he went there, he
[1:08:56] went with a different purpose than he
[1:08:58] intended to go there in the first place.
[1:09:00] So here Paul, his desire, his desire to
[1:09:03] go there, it didn't change. She still
[1:09:05] went there, but his purpose for going
[1:09:07] there certainly changed after he met
[1:09:09] God. You know what that tells me? That
[1:09:11] God can lead a sinner. He even took a
[1:09:13] man that was a sinner and God led him.
[1:09:15] Ain't that ain't that what the Bible
[1:09:17] said? It said that whenever Paul, he was
[1:09:19] breathing out threatenings and slaughter
[1:09:21] against the disciples of God. He wanted
[1:09:23] to destroy them all. And Paul went to
[1:09:25] the the Paul went to the council and he
[1:09:28] desired letters to go to Damascus that
[1:09:31] he could kill the Christians or those
[1:09:33] that would call themselves disciples of
[1:09:35] Jesus. But then when he went down the
[1:09:37] road, all of a sudden Jesus met him
[1:09:39] there and he changed his purpose in his
[1:09:42] walk. His desire to go there didn't
[1:09:45] change, but the purpose changed and and
[1:09:48] the purpose of his desire changed. I
[1:09:49] thought it did something. Well, what
[1:09:51] caused Paul to want to go to Damascus in
[1:09:53] the first place? Let me tell you what it
[1:09:55] was. The Bible said there was a desire.
[1:09:57] Let me ask you this. Who put the desire
[1:09:59] in his heart to go there? Who put the
[1:10:01] desire, a sinner man, a a man that was a
[1:10:04] sinner that was killing Christians that
[1:10:06] God would put a desire in his heart to
[1:10:09] go to the very place that God was going
[1:10:11] to meet him. I wish I was an angel in
[1:10:13] heaven that day when God began to reveal
[1:10:15] his plan. Hey friend, we're we're going
[1:10:17] to bring one. He's going to lead the
[1:10:19] Gentile church. I know we've been with
[1:10:21] the Jews all along, but I'm turning from
[1:10:23] the Jew unto the Gentile, and now we're
[1:10:25] going to save this whole Gentile race.
[1:10:27] Lord, how are you going to do it? I'm
[1:10:29] going to send a prophet. I'm going to
[1:10:30] use this man. His name is Saul. You mean
[1:10:34] the man that's down there slaughtering
[1:10:35] your people. That's the one I'm going to
[1:10:37] use. I'm going to use him to be a
[1:10:38] prophet. I'm going to send him into the
[1:10:40] Gentile church. He's going to lead them
[1:10:42] out of that old spiritual condition and
[1:10:44] right into the baptism of the Holy
[1:10:46] Ghost. It was God that had a plan to use
[1:10:49] him. Well, how are you going to use him?
[1:10:51] Let me tell you what you do. You go over
[1:10:53] there. He sent a spirit. I I feel like
[1:10:55] preaching anyway. He sent a spirit down
[1:10:56] there. You put a desire in his heart to
[1:10:59] go to Damascus and you make his purpose
[1:11:01] so strong that that's what he'll do. And
[1:11:03] so there they went down and that desire
[1:11:05] struck his heart. And here Paul went
[1:11:07] down to the council. I've got to have a
[1:11:08] letter. I got a desire in my heart to go
[1:11:10] to Damascus and slaughter these
[1:11:12] Christians.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. Well, how's that going to work?
[1:11:15] Let me tell you what I want. I can just
[1:11:16] see L the Lord just taking his plan and
[1:11:18] rolling out before the angel and you
[1:11:20] say, "Well, well, right, you're going to
[1:11:21] go right here. You're going to put a
[1:11:23] desire in his heart and you're going to
[1:11:24] bring him down the road to Damascus."
[1:11:26] And I'll tell you what y'all are going
[1:11:27] to do. You're going to go down that road
[1:11:29] and you're going to find the little lady
[1:11:30] with a basket and you're going to make
[1:11:32] her stop at the store and you go to the
[1:11:33] guy that's pushing the car and you break
[1:11:35] his wheel and make him stop on the side
[1:11:37] of the road and you go to the other one
[1:11:38] and you park him. That way whenever Paul
[1:11:40] gets to this very place right here, then
[1:11:43] I'm going to walk down and I'm going to
[1:11:44] meet him there. I I I got an appointment
[1:11:46] with him. I want to have some alone time
[1:11:49] and I'm going to change his heart. Let
[1:11:51] me tell you friends, if God can lead a
[1:11:53] man that's a sinner, then what about a
[1:11:55] son and a daughter of God?
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; God leads his church. He can lead the
[1:12:00] children of God.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Don't think God can't lead you. God led
[1:12:04] him down a path of salvation.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; See, it depends on what you surrender
[1:12:09] yourself to.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Paul let the law use him. And what it
[1:12:13] did is it brought death.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; He surrendered himself to the law and it
[1:12:17] brought death.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; But when he surrendered itself to grace,
[1:12:21] it brought life.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Ain't that powerful?
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Is whatever you surrender to you, if you
[1:12:26] want to surrender to the devil, the
[1:12:27] devil will use you. If you want to
[1:12:29] surrender to the law, the law will use
[1:12:31] you. But if you want to surrender to
[1:12:32] grace,
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; grace can use you.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; So see, God's calling us out of one
[1:12:37] thing into another. You realize that's
[1:12:39] what redemption takes. Redemption takes
[1:12:41] two parts. Abraham shows this in the
[1:12:42] paradoxes that see Joshua is a book.
[1:12:45] It's a book of redemption. The Old
[1:12:46] Testament Joshua we would have to
[1:12:48] consider it to be the book of redemption
[1:12:50] because in redemption has two parts.
[1:12:51] Anywhere anywhere redemption always has
[1:12:54] two parts. It's out of and into.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; God never calls you out and leaves you.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So redemption has two
[1:13:01] parts. He's always bringing you out of
[1:13:02] one thing into another. So that's all
[1:13:04] that's an always. So So here, watch how
[1:13:06] God does this in the book of Ephesians
[1:13:09] of the Old Testament. That'd be a good
[1:13:10] title for the book of Joshua would be
[1:13:12] call it the book of Ephesians of the Old
[1:13:14] Testament. Can I can I can I tell you
[1:13:16] why? See, because the book of Joshua
[1:13:18] parallels the book of Ephesians. So, in
[1:13:20] the book of Ephesians, you you can see
[1:13:23] it very plainly in the book of
[1:13:24] Ephesians. You'll notice both books
[1:13:26] begin with this this same uh this same
[1:13:28] concept that they're bringing you out of
[1:13:30] one place and into another. That's what
[1:13:32] was happening in Joshua. Go he he said,
[1:13:34] "Now, after the death of Moses, my uh
[1:13:37] Moses, my servant, is dead. Therefore,
[1:13:38] arise and go over the Jordan, thou and
[1:13:40] all this people under the land which I
[1:13:42] give them. So, see, so he was called to
[1:13:44] bring them out of one place and into
[1:13:46] another.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; So, see, so watch what happened in the
[1:13:49] book of Ephesians. So, one in Joshua, it
[1:13:51] was Israel out of the wilderness into
[1:13:53] the into the the promised land. But in
[1:13:55] the book of Ephesians, it was the
[1:13:57] believer out of sin into their spiritual
[1:14:00] promise. Can I read it? Ephesians the 2
[1:14:02] chapter, the first verse. And you hath
[1:14:03] he quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:14:05] and sins. Wherein in times past you
[1:14:08] walked according to the course of the
[1:14:09] world, according to the prince of the
[1:14:11] power of the air. The spirit now
[1:14:12] workketh the children of disobedience,
[1:14:14] among whom you have all your had your
[1:14:16] conversation in times past and the lust
[1:14:18] of the flesh, fulfilling the desires of
[1:14:20] the flesh and in the mind, and were of
[1:14:22] the nature of the children of wrath by
[1:14:23] others. But God who is rich in mercy for
[1:14:27] his great love wherewith he has loved
[1:14:29] us. Even when you were dead in sins, he
[1:14:31] quickened us together with Christ. And
[1:14:33] by grace now you are saved. And he hath
[1:14:36] raised us up together. Watch this book
[1:14:38] of Joshua. He has raised us up together
[1:14:41] and made us sit together in heavenly
[1:14:43] places in Christ Jesus. So not only did
[1:14:46] he call you out of sin, but then he led
[1:14:48] you into this place of grace. He said he
[1:14:51] raised us up together to sit in heavenly
[1:14:53] places with Christ. So he called him out
[1:14:55] of one place entering into another. It's
[1:14:57] a perfect parallel. Watch. even their
[1:14:59] inheritance that they received. Watch
[1:15:01] the the book of Joshua. The inheritance
[1:15:03] was a physical land. It it was a a
[1:15:06] promise of God in the book of Ephesians.
[1:15:07] Ephesians 1:10, it says, "But the
[1:15:09] dispensation of the fullness of time
[1:15:12] might gathered together in one all
[1:15:14] things in Christ, both which are in
[1:15:15] heaven and which are in earth, even in
[1:15:17] him." So, he's showing that God is
[1:15:19] bringing us to a place in whom also we
[1:15:22] have obtained our inheritance. So, book
[1:15:26] of Joshua, it's taking them to to their
[1:15:28] inheritance. The book of Ephesians, it's
[1:15:30] taking us right into our inheritance.
[1:15:31] You see, you see it again in their
[1:15:33] battle. Whenever the the book of Joshua,
[1:15:35] they went into battle, uh it was a
[1:15:37] struggle. It was to conquer a physical
[1:15:39] land and a a physical war, isn't it
[1:15:42] something though that although it it was
[1:15:44] a rightful place, he says, see, but the
[1:15:46] believers, they had to fight against
[1:15:48] these spiritual forces in order to claim
[1:15:50] their inheritance in Christ. So just
[1:15:52] like they had to go in and fight for it.
[1:15:55] Just we had to do the same thing. We we
[1:15:58] have an inheritance. Then then there's a
[1:16:00] warfare. So they they fought a natural
[1:16:02] battle to receive their inheritance.
[1:16:04] What's Paul say? Ephesians the 6th
[1:16:05] chapter. He said, "We wrestle not
[1:16:07] against flesh and blood, but against
[1:16:09] principalities and powers and the rulers
[1:16:11] of darkness uh against spiritual
[1:16:14] wickedness in high places. Wherefore
[1:16:15] take on the whole armor of God." So here
[1:16:17] in Joshua, they were equipping them to
[1:16:19] go into battle to receive their
[1:16:21] inheritance. And now in the book of
[1:16:23] Ephesians, Paul is equipping the church
[1:16:25] to go into battle, to receive their
[1:16:27] inheritance. So all the way through you
[1:16:29] you find this to be a perfect parallel
[1:16:31] even even that the Holy the Holy Spirit
[1:16:34] today is a type of Joshua. That's why
[1:16:36] you've heard that that that that Joshua
[1:16:38] was a type of the Holy Ghost. He said,
[1:16:39] "Because that's what God has sent to the
[1:16:41] church to bring you into this place,
[1:16:44] into this promised place or into this
[1:16:45] this land of inheritance." But it's our
[1:16:48] it's our rightful place. It's our it's
[1:16:50] our rightful position. And although I
[1:16:52] thought, isn't it Isn't it something
[1:16:53] that although it was promised to them,
[1:16:56] but still yet they had to fight to
[1:16:58] obtain it?
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Did you notice that in Joshua? It was
[1:17:01] promised to them, but when the spies
[1:17:03] went over and looked at the land, they
[1:17:04] said, "There's big giants in the land.
[1:17:06] We can't we can't take that." But but
[1:17:08] then there was a couple that said Joshua
[1:17:09] and Caleb said we can go over there and
[1:17:10] take it out because the word of God says
[1:17:12] we can say see and so when Joshua went
[1:17:14] over it they had to go into battle even
[1:17:17] though it was rightfully theirs. It
[1:17:19] belonged to them but still yet they had
[1:17:21] to go into battle in order to obtain it.
[1:17:23] I thought that's the same way with a
[1:17:25] believer in the book of Ephesians here.
[1:17:26] We're called to be spiritual overcomers
[1:17:28] and we're called to sit in heavenly
[1:17:30] places with Christ Jesus. But Paul would
[1:17:32] say, "But put on the whole armor of God
[1:17:35] that you may be able to withstand in
[1:17:37] that evil day, having done all to stand.
[1:17:41] Stand therefore." Says, "So even in this
[1:17:43] age, God has given us a place
[1:17:45] spiritually to be as believers." But you
[1:17:47] have to fight to be able to get it.
[1:17:49] Don't you realize it's a struggle. You
[1:17:50] say, "Why is it such a fight to come to
[1:17:52] church?" It's because God has a place
[1:17:54] for you to be spiritually, and Satan
[1:17:56] don't want you to get it. So it may be
[1:17:58] your inheritance, but it's a battle.
[1:18:00] It's a battle in the morning. It's a
[1:18:01] battle in the It's a battle at night.
[1:18:03] It's a battle at church. It's a battle
[1:18:05] at home. It's a battle at work. It's a
[1:18:07] battle wherever you are. It's a battle
[1:18:09] to get into the place spiritually
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; that God has called you to be in.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Said it's a rightful place, but we still
[1:18:15] fight it. You see the parallel.
[1:18:16] Ephesians parallels Joshua. So, see,
[1:18:19] here God, he calling us to our place,
[1:18:21] our our spiritual place, and we're
[1:18:23] fighting to get through it. So, see, but
[1:18:24] notice here it watch the the other part
[1:18:27] in in the process of redemption. So
[1:18:29] there's three stages to Israel's
[1:18:31] journey. It was coming out of Egypt,
[1:18:32] going in the wilderness, entering into
[1:18:34] the promised land.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; So there's three stages of their
[1:18:36] journey. But watch the parallel. The
[1:18:38] same thing in the Christian experience.
[1:18:40] Justification, sanctification, baptism
[1:18:42] of the Holy Ghost. I don't have time to
[1:18:44] teach on them all, but you know that.
[1:18:45] But but so here's the three stages of
[1:18:47] grace. It's a perfect type to their walk
[1:18:50] with God in the natural is a perfect
[1:18:52] type with ours. In the spiritual, I love
[1:18:53] the direction that brother Bam takes
[1:18:55] this. He says, "See, here we find Joshua
[1:18:57] was representing grace or some
[1:18:59] propitiation that it could not exist in
[1:19:03] the same time that the law was in
[1:19:05] existence." Can I have just a minute
[1:19:06] here? Is everybody awake? I I just take
[1:19:08] a minute because I really think it it
[1:19:09] would help you. He said, "But but but
[1:19:11] grace," he said, "See, he Joshua
[1:19:13] represented grace, but he could not
[1:19:14] exist at the same time that the law was
[1:19:16] in existence." But that ain't just with
[1:19:19] Joshua. But it's the same way with any
[1:19:21] message. You realize that it doesn't
[1:19:23] matter what the message is. Any message
[1:19:24] that forwards the people of God on, it
[1:19:27] will never coincide with a previous
[1:19:29] message. If it's sent to forward the
[1:19:31] people, but said, "That's why there's
[1:19:32] trouble today." He said, "Cuz you can't
[1:19:34] put new wine into old bottles." You know
[1:19:36] why that was? Them old animal skin
[1:19:38] bottles that they put wine in and the
[1:19:40] wine when you put wine in it. Wine has
[1:19:42] to take a while to ferment. And you put
[1:19:44] it in that old bottle and the old bottle
[1:19:46] is stiff and dry and it been torred up
[1:19:49] and it don't it it ain't it ain't uh uh
[1:19:51] oiled up or it can stretch. you don't
[1:19:53] have the ability to stretch it. And if
[1:19:54] you put new wine in it, as the wine
[1:19:56] begins to ferment, it just explodes the
[1:19:58] bottle and it ruins the wine. So Jesus
[1:20:00] said, you can't put new wine in old
[1:20:02] bottles. So, so there had to come
[1:20:04] something that was a fresh bottle. They
[1:20:06] had to come something that was freshly
[1:20:08] oiled that would be able to accept this
[1:20:10] new wine. So he said that's why he said
[1:20:12] that you couldn't have both at the same
[1:20:14] time. He said see you can't put new wine
[1:20:16] in old bottles. said that Joshua so
[1:20:18] Joshua could not come he he could not
[1:20:21] come into his ministry until after Moses
[1:20:24] was gone. Isn't that something? But do
[1:20:26] you realize that even though he didn't
[1:20:28] come into his ministry but but still yet
[1:20:30] that that that uh he was there all the
[1:20:32] time all from the very beginning you
[1:20:34] think about this he said from the very
[1:20:36] first verse he said Moses my servant is
[1:20:38] dead now arise and take this people into
[1:20:40] the promised land. So see Moses which
[1:20:43] represented the law he had served his
[1:20:45] time. He said the law had served its
[1:20:47] time.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; But then whenever he called Joshua,
[1:20:50] watch what happened. Do you realize that
[1:20:53] before God called Joshua that grace was
[1:20:54] actually there first? Kind of late. It's
[1:20:57] Sunday morning.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; You realize there was grace there before
[1:20:59] there was ever a law. Said it was
[1:21:01] already grace. It started with grace to
[1:21:03] begin with. Before they had law, there
[1:21:04] was grace. So grace came first. That's
[1:21:06] that's why when they were in Egypt,
[1:21:08] there was no law in Egypt. It was just
[1:21:09] grace. It it was grace that that
[1:21:11] provided a prophet to come and lead them
[1:21:13] out of Egypt. It was grace that provided
[1:21:15] an atonement, a a sacrificial lamb. It
[1:21:18] was grace that put blood on the door. It
[1:21:20] was grace that sent a pillar of fire to
[1:21:22] call them out of Egypt. So grace was
[1:21:24] there all along.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; But then they but they came out. They
[1:21:30] had an atonement. It had been provided
[1:21:32] before there was ever a law. But say
[1:21:33] grace was before the law, during the
[1:21:35] law, and after the law. Grace has always
[1:21:36] been there.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; There's always been grace. said, "But
[1:21:41] Joshua,
[1:21:43] excuse me,
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; brother."
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Joshua representing grace was right
[1:21:48] along with the law,
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; but it could not be enforced as long as
[1:21:53] the law was in its proper place.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; So grace was there, but grace couldn't
[1:21:57] be enforced. Isn't that powerful?
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; So grace has always been here.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Said, but it couldn't be enforced
[1:22:01] because you were holding a law
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; and it kept grace from being able to be
[1:22:05] enforced. That's a powerful message.
[1:22:08] says, "So grace couldn't couldn't come
[1:22:10] to its place because the law was in its
[1:22:12] place." She says, "So the church world
[1:22:14] in this last day, it's come along. It's
[1:22:16] played its part." Said, "But there's a
[1:22:17] coming a time it must cease. It's got
[1:22:19] because there's got to be an Ephesians
[1:22:20] of this journey just as there was in
[1:22:22] every other journey."
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; So since the law, you think about it,
[1:22:25] since the law could never, it could
[1:22:27] never save a sinner, the promised land,
[1:22:30] it represented a day of grace. The law
[1:22:32] would never save them. So here they were
[1:22:33] walking to this place or to this promise
[1:22:35] said and Moses couldn't take a minute of
[1:22:37] that because now Moses represented he
[1:22:39] represented the law and we of course of
[1:22:41] course course we study this in the
[1:22:42] scripture you realize it actually uh it
[1:22:44] perfectly types the three stages of
[1:22:46] grace justification sanctification
[1:22:47] baptism of the holy ghost but said see
[1:22:49] because here they were it was three
[1:22:51] stages of their journey first it was a
[1:22:53] preparation by faith they had to and you
[1:22:55] see what I mean they had to go out into
[1:22:57] the wilderness they had to leave their
[1:22:58] homeland they they didn't just get to
[1:23:00] Egypt they had always been in Egypt they
[1:23:01] were born in Egypt they raised in Egypt.
[1:23:03] That's all they knew. So, they had to
[1:23:05] they had to uh prepare by faith to be
[1:23:08] able to leave the taskmaster knowing
[1:23:09] that they were going to get killed or
[1:23:11] they'd be beaten or or or be I wonder
[1:23:13] how many putting in their place would be
[1:23:15] able to go along with it. I don't know
[1:23:16] about this. I just I just do the bricks
[1:23:18] and and and build the corners is all I
[1:23:20] do. And then and then I eat and I go
[1:23:22] home with my family. I don't want to get
[1:23:23] involved in all that. After all, that
[1:23:25] you know that that'd be tyranny or
[1:23:26] something or or you know that that I
[1:23:28] wouldn't want to be a part of that. And
[1:23:30] so so they had to prepare by faith in
[1:23:33] order to go to this place. And so under
[1:23:35] that sacrificial lamb then the second
[1:23:37] place. So here they they got prepared
[1:23:39] that that by faith and what they did is
[1:23:40] they slayed a lamb and they put the lamb
[1:23:42] on the door that when the death angel
[1:23:44] would come that that it would save all
[1:23:46] of those that were in Egypt. So see so
[1:23:48] when they put the blood on the door and
[1:23:49] preparing by faith they were covered
[1:23:52] under the blood.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; And then whenever they left they crossed
[1:23:55] the Red Sea and went out into the
[1:23:57] wilderness. said, "See, and they it was
[1:23:58] a type of separation. It represented
[1:24:00] another stage in their journey, just
[1:24:02] like you and I." First, they came under
[1:24:04] the blood, by faith. Isn't it something?
[1:24:06] That's what you have to do. You have to
[1:24:07] accept it by faith. You're a sinner.
[1:24:09] You're lost. You got all these things on
[1:24:11] your life. And you have to just accept
[1:24:13] the blood of Jesus by faith, thinking
[1:24:15] that that blood is going to save you.
[1:24:17] And that blood is going to wipe away
[1:24:18] your sin, knowing that your memory don't
[1:24:20] ever get rid of it, that the law don't
[1:24:22] ever get rid of it. You can go back and
[1:24:24] read it. It's always still there. You
[1:24:26] can go find a paper that still says you
[1:24:28] did it. You can find a courthouse that
[1:24:29] still says you did it. But you have to
[1:24:31] accept by faith this law of God that
[1:24:34] over that supersedes this law of the
[1:24:36] flesh that says that by grace I've been
[1:24:38] saved. See, so they had to accept by
[1:24:41] faith that that blood on their door was
[1:24:43] enough to get them past judgment. It
[1:24:45] ain't something that they can know
[1:24:46] without having faith. They only could
[1:24:48] accept. Are you Are you with me? I'm
[1:24:50] laying it down on purpose. You You have
[1:24:52] to accept it by faith that that law is
[1:24:54] good enough for me.
[1:24:56] said, "So, first they had to accept that
[1:24:57] by faith." And they had to prepare by
[1:24:59] faith. That's why whenever you come to
[1:25:00] an altar and you repent, you say, "What
[1:25:02] are you doing? You're preparing by faith
[1:25:04] that the blood of Jesus is good enough
[1:25:05] to cover your sins.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; It sure ain't good enough to get it out
[1:25:09] of your wife's mind or your friends or
[1:25:10] your or your parents sometimes because
[1:25:12] they remember that stuff, but it's good
[1:25:13] enough to cover it in the mind of God."
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Say, "So, we have to by faith." said
[1:25:18] first they had to come to this place and
[1:25:20] prepare themselves by faith to enter
[1:25:23] into this walk of grace. They're
[1:25:25] preparing themselves by faith. Then the
[1:25:27] next thing they did watch it Egypt. They
[1:25:28] went to the uh Red Sea and they crossed
[1:25:30] over said what was it? They went down
[1:25:32] and it's just like you and I. We go down
[1:25:34] to the water and we're baptized in the
[1:25:35] water which is a sign of the old man uh
[1:25:38] uh dying and the new man being born.
[1:25:41] Says see now they went through the blood
[1:25:42] and they went through the water. So see
[1:25:44] now he said they're baptized. They
[1:25:45] repented. They were baptized. They come
[1:25:47] out and they walk in a new life, in a
[1:25:49] new land, in a newness journey among a
[1:25:51] new people and the hand of God is upon
[1:25:53] you. But then they finally come to a
[1:25:55] place in this walk. They went through
[1:25:57] the blood. They went through the water
[1:25:59] just like you and I said, but then they
[1:26:01] come to the place in their walk that
[1:26:02] they were not satisfied with their walk
[1:26:05] of grace.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; They came through this place in their
[1:26:09] walk. Went through the blood, went
[1:26:11] through the water, but they weren't
[1:26:13] satisfied with their walk of grace. He
[1:26:15] said, "And all of a sudden they thought
[1:26:16] they have to do something else that they
[1:26:19] could save themselves."
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; See, justification is an act of grace.
[1:26:23] Sanctification is an act of grace. So,
[1:26:25] but because they weren't satisfied with
[1:26:28] their walk of grace, they desired
[1:26:29] something more. But remember, that's
[1:26:31] where people are today. And no matter
[1:26:32] what the work of grace is, whether it be
[1:26:34] divine healing or any other work of
[1:26:36] grace, he said people feel like today
[1:26:38] that there's something that you have to
[1:26:39] do. Said, "But there's nothing you have
[1:26:42] to do but believe. just believe God.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? You realize that
[1:26:46] the children of Israel could have
[1:26:47] continued right into the promise, but
[1:26:50] they weren't satisfied in the walk of
[1:26:52] grace.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; So, they thought there was something
[1:26:54] more they had to do. They wanted to they
[1:26:56] had to have a church and they had to
[1:26:57] have somebody over them and they had to
[1:26:58] have a law to live by and they had they
[1:27:00] had to have all that. So, they they
[1:27:02] demanded it of God. Said they could have
[1:27:03] walked right in the promise because the
[1:27:05] promise wasn't given to them under the
[1:27:07] law. How many knows that the promise was
[1:27:08] given to them under under grace? It came
[1:27:11] from Abraham. It was an unconditional
[1:27:13] promise that would lead them into that
[1:27:14] land. The promise didn't require the
[1:27:16] law. They required the law.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "Therefore, they got to this
[1:27:20] place." He said, "Before they could go
[1:27:21] to the promise, they decided there was
[1:27:23] something they have to do theirel."
[1:27:24] That's the Bible. They decided there was
[1:27:25] something they had to do their yourself.
[1:27:26] He said, "We still find human beings
[1:27:28] today doing that same thing. There's got
[1:27:30] to be something else that I have to do.
[1:27:32] That that that the blood and the water,
[1:27:34] it wasn't enough. This walk of grace
[1:27:36] isn't enough. There's got to be more
[1:27:37] that I have to do. I got to beat the
[1:27:39] altar before I can get saved. I got to
[1:27:41] have this great sensation before I can
[1:27:43] praise God and worship. I got to have
[1:27:45] all this before I can get to this place
[1:27:46] with God. I got I got to get rid of my
[1:27:48] tobacco before before I can get saved.
[1:27:51] You know, I had a lady we invited to
[1:27:52] church the other day to come to the
[1:27:54] meeting. She said, "Well, I I I can't
[1:27:55] remember exactly how she said it, but
[1:27:57] well, I can't come to the meeting
[1:27:58] because I don't have no dress. So, I
[1:28:00] can't go out there to y'all's meeting
[1:28:01] because you got to wear a dress to go to
[1:28:02] the meeting." I said, "I don't know who
[1:28:03] told you that lie, but you just come on
[1:28:04] to the meeting."
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; I know what God does when he gets a hold
[1:28:09] of people. You just come on to the
[1:28:11] meeting. Are you kidding me? See, that's
[1:28:13] just the mind of people that they built.
[1:28:15] There's something I have to do. But this
[1:28:16] ain't something you do, friends. If you
[1:28:18] took off pants and put on a dress, it
[1:28:20] don't mean nothing anyhow. If you can
[1:28:22] took all the makeup off your face, it
[1:28:24] don't mean nothing to God anyhow.
[1:28:25] Anything you do don't matter to nothing.
[1:28:27] Only thing that matters is what God does
[1:28:29] with you.
[1:28:31] said, "So, we need to get to a place
[1:28:32] with God that God can do something with
[1:28:34] you and God can lead you and God can
[1:28:37] dress you and God can equip you and God
[1:28:39] can use you."
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; See, it's it's the mind of people today.
[1:28:44] What do I have to do to be saved? What
[1:28:46] do I have to do to be right? What I It
[1:28:48] ain't what you have to do. Isn't that
[1:28:50] preached so backwards in this world?
[1:28:52] It's such a it's such a legalistic
[1:28:54] mindset that that that that people put
[1:28:56] that on people that they feel like they
[1:28:58] got to do that to get to God. Just get
[1:28:59] to God and let God take care of the rest
[1:29:01] of it.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; However you can, just get to God.
[1:29:04] Whatever it takes, just get to God
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; and then let God lead you.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; That's the way I believe it.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Said, "See, we find out we're human
[1:29:14] beings. We feel like there's still
[1:29:15] something we have to do." He said, "We
[1:29:17] feel like we've got to do something in
[1:29:18] it also." He said, "But there ain't but
[1:29:20] one thing you have to do. That's
[1:29:21] surrender to your own will and the will
[1:29:24] and the idea of almighty God. Let it
[1:29:25] come into you and then it's finished.
[1:29:27] That's all there is. just take his
[1:29:28] promise and nothing else and walk by it
[1:29:30] and God does the rest of it.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Ain't that wonderful? Don't that make
[1:29:34] the the load so much lighter. I just I
[1:29:37] just surrender to the will of God. Let
[1:29:39] God I've been trying to kick this habit
[1:29:41] for so long. I just can't get rid of it.
[1:29:43] I I I I've tried to beat it off me. I've
[1:29:45] tried to pray it off of me. I tried to
[1:29:47] drown it off of me. I tried to burn it
[1:29:49] off of me. I tried to do everything I
[1:29:51] can to get rid of it. And I just can't
[1:29:52] seem to get rid of it. But friends, it
[1:29:54] ain't up to you to do it. Just get to
[1:29:56] God and let God go to working on you.
[1:30:00] See,
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; just surrender to God and let God do the
[1:30:03] rest of it.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Walk by it and then God does the rest.
[1:30:07] Said that's what they wanted. They
[1:30:08] wanted a law. Said, you know what God
[1:30:10] gave them? He gave them the desire of
[1:30:11] their heart.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; And he gave them a law. And you know
[1:30:14] what that law became? It became a thorn
[1:30:15] in their flesh the rest of their walk
[1:30:17] until the day of Jesus when he came on
[1:30:19] the cross of Calvary. The law was a
[1:30:20] thorn in the flesh of Israel because
[1:30:22] they desired a law. He said, "But see
[1:30:26] you, anything you try to do within
[1:30:28] yourself," he said, "It'll always work
[1:30:29] to your dishonor. It'll always be a
[1:30:32] disadvantage, but you must just simply
[1:30:34] believe God,
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; and that settles it."
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful this morning? No
[1:30:39] matter what the promise is, just believe
[1:30:41] God.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am the Lord thy God that
[1:30:44] health all thy diseases." Just believe
[1:30:46] God. He said, "If there's any among you,
[1:30:48] let them call the elders of the church.
[1:30:50] Just believe God. Lay hands on the sick
[1:30:52] and they shall recover. Just believe
[1:30:54] God. The works that I do shall you do
[1:30:56] also. Just believe God. Friends, I don't
[1:30:58] care what the promise is or answer ought
[1:31:01] to be. I just believe God. If it's a
[1:31:03] promise of healing, I say I believe God.
[1:31:06] If it's a promise of salvation, I
[1:31:08] believe God. If it's a promise of
[1:31:10] deliverance, I believe God. If it's a
[1:31:12] promise of eternal life, I believe God.
[1:31:14] If it's a promise of the rapture, I
[1:31:16] believe God.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Believe God and let God take care of the
[1:31:21] rest of it. Amen.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; In every generation, God's people,
[1:31:25] they're looking for a promise. I'm about
[1:31:27] to close. As they're looking for a
[1:31:29] promise, you notice in Abraham, what he
[1:31:31] was looking for a city, Moses, they were
[1:31:33] looking for a promised land, a land that
[1:31:34] was flowing with milk and honey. In the
[1:31:36] days of the Jews, they were looking for
[1:31:38] the son of David to be restored to the
[1:31:39] throne of Israel. But even in our
[1:31:41] generation, we're looking for something,
[1:31:43] too.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; You look around the church world,
[1:31:46] they're all calling for something. They
[1:31:47] post it on all the social media. They
[1:31:50] all what they're looking for. They're
[1:31:52] trying to bring churches together and
[1:31:54] and man, we we're looking for a great
[1:31:56] revival in the land. And we're looking
[1:31:58] we're looking for a healing campaign.
[1:32:00] We're looking we're looking for this.
[1:32:01] We're looking for more more people in
[1:32:03] the church. All this coming together
[1:32:04] trying to trying to to please everybody
[1:32:06] and have this great revival. You realize
[1:32:09] that's what that's why there's so many
[1:32:10] letdowns is when you is because you get
[1:32:12] to a place in your walk that you're
[1:32:14] looking for the wrong thing. And if
[1:32:16] you're looking for something that don't
[1:32:17] belong to you, then you're always let
[1:32:18] down. If you was looking to come to
[1:32:20] church this morning, can I just be Can I
[1:32:22] just be real? If you're looking to come
[1:32:24] to church this morning and get a million
[1:32:25] dollar check, you'd always be
[1:32:27] disappointed because you ain't never
[1:32:28] going to walk in and get a million
[1:32:29] dollar check. So, if you're looking for
[1:32:31] the wrong thing, you're always
[1:32:32] disappointed. So, when you come to try
[1:32:34] to serve God and you try to have this
[1:32:36] walk of this walk of grace, many of you
[1:32:39] started many times down this pathway,
[1:32:41] but you're trying to serve God and
[1:32:42] you're looking to get the wrong thing
[1:32:43] out of God,
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; and you never get it. And then you
[1:32:47] always leave disappointed
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; because you're not looking for what is
[1:32:50] rightfully yours,
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; not looking for the right thing. So,
[1:32:53] see, because they're they're looking for
[1:32:55] it. So, they're always disappointed
[1:32:56] because they're looking for the wrong
[1:32:57] thing. But said, but I'm not looking for
[1:32:59] revival in our generation. He said, I'm
[1:33:01] looking for the coming of the Lord
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; in our gener. Isn't that something,
[1:33:05] brother Mark? Therefore, you don't ever
[1:33:07] have to leave disappointed because we're
[1:33:09] looking for the coming of the Lord. So
[1:33:10] every day is another day that I take a a
[1:33:13] step in this walk of grace saying it
[1:33:15] ain't going to be it ain't going to be a
[1:33:16] few more days that are filled with
[1:33:18] trouble. There's going to be turmoil.
[1:33:20] There's going to be trials. There's
[1:33:21] going to be burden. There's going to be
[1:33:23] pressure. But I'm looking for the coming
[1:33:25] of the Lord. I'm going to have some letd
[1:33:26] downs. I'm going to have some people
[1:33:28] that are up and some people that are
[1:33:29] down. Some people that are pulling and
[1:33:31] some people that won't. But you know
[1:33:32] what? One thing, one of these days, the
[1:33:34] grace of God, the heavens will open and
[1:33:37] the bride of Jesus Christ will rapture
[1:33:39] off of this earth. I'm looking for the
[1:33:41] coming of the Lord. Therefore, I'm never
[1:33:43] disappointed in my walk cuz I'm looking
[1:33:45] for that ultimate victory. I'm not
[1:33:48] looking for riches. I'm not looking for
[1:33:50] cars. I'm not looking for lands. We're
[1:33:52] not looking for houses. That ain't what
[1:33:54] we're looking for. So, if our job fails
[1:33:56] and so let it be. If people fail, so let
[1:33:58] it be. Cuz we're looking for the coming
[1:34:00] of the Lord.
[1:34:04] Everything fails around us, let it be.
[1:34:06] We're looking for the coming of the
[1:34:07] Lord.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; See, when you're looking for the right
[1:34:09] thing, you're never disappointed
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; because our eye is on the right thing.
[1:34:12] Friends, that's our promise. That's what
[1:34:14] we're walking toward. That's why we have
[1:34:16] a church. That's why there's such
[1:34:18] revival. That's our purpose.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Don't lose sight of it.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; We're looking for the coming of the
[1:34:24] Lord.
[1:34:25] That's the purpose of our church
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; is to prepare for the coming of the
[1:34:29] Lord.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Not to build a church, not to build a
[1:34:32] name, not to build a ministry, not to
[1:34:34] not to be somebody. If we wanted to be
[1:34:36] somebody, we wouldn't have a church in
[1:34:37] Black Rockck. We'd pick a big city
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; where there was a bunch of people that
[1:34:41] could come to it,
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; but instead we just want to be in the
[1:34:44] will of God
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; and get our hearts prepared for the
[1:34:47] coming of the Lord
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; to arise and take a hold of the promises
[1:34:52] of God. It's a walk of grace. Amen.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; It's a walk of grace.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Can I close with this?
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Listen, we're preaching out of
[1:35:01] Ephesians.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Henceforth, since we're
[1:35:04] walking on this walk, walk not as other
[1:35:06] Gentiles walk." Ephesians 5'8, he said,
[1:35:09] "Walk as children of the light."
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; See, our walk with God, do you know what
[1:35:14] Paul's actually speaking of in this
[1:35:16] portion of scripture? He's actually
[1:35:17] speaking of our spiritual growth. And
[1:35:20] and he shows this that our spiritual
[1:35:23] growth which is the maturing of a
[1:35:24] believer he shows that maturing is a
[1:35:28] progression in your walk. I think that's
[1:35:30] so powerful.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Says so you say well how do I walk with
[1:35:32] God and how do I get further in my walk
[1:35:34] with God? Paul actually shows us in
[1:35:36] Ephesians 5 that our that our maturing
[1:35:38] in the in the word and maturing in the
[1:35:41] gospel is you progressing in your walk.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; So every time you mature a little bit
[1:35:45] that's taking another step. You're
[1:35:46] progressing in your walk. He says, "See,
[1:35:48] but but in the walk," Paul warns. He
[1:35:50] said, "But even as believers," he says,
[1:35:52] "but don't walk as other Gentiles walk."
[1:35:55] Isn't that something that that here in
[1:35:56] the church, we're all on that same walk
[1:35:58] of grace. He said, "But don't walk as
[1:35:59] other Gentiles walk because if you take
[1:36:01] the steps they take or take, you're not
[1:36:04] walking in progress, but you're actually
[1:36:06] regressing."
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; And so Paul says there's steps of
[1:36:09] progress and then then there are steps
[1:36:11] of regress. And then Paul lays it out
[1:36:13] here, the steps of regression. You know
[1:36:14] what that means? The steps of
[1:36:15] regression. It means to no longer walk
[1:36:17] back or forward, but now you're walking
[1:36:19] backward. Says, see, so Paul said here,
[1:36:21] we're in this walk of grace and we
[1:36:23] should be we should be walking and
[1:36:25] progressing and maturing in the word,
[1:36:27] but somehow that Satan comes in and he
[1:36:29] gets a he gets a way into your life
[1:36:31] through somebody or some voice or or or
[1:36:34] or some website or something. and he
[1:36:36] finds a way into your life and all of a
[1:36:38] sudden while you're on this walk and
[1:36:39] you're taking a step something halts you
[1:36:41] on your walk and you may stand for a
[1:36:43] little bit and you entertain him and
[1:36:44] then while you're standing there you
[1:36:46] have a decision. This is what Paul's
[1:36:47] talking about. You can either take a
[1:36:49] step forward or you can take a step
[1:36:51] backward and Paul's showing how that the
[1:36:53] Gentiles he said their walk is not a
[1:36:55] walk of progress but their walk is an
[1:36:58] actually a walk of regress. And he shows
[1:37:00] the steps that it takes to go backwards.
[1:37:02] How many wants to know what they are? He
[1:37:03] says, "See, because they walk in the
[1:37:05] vanity over in the vanity of their own
[1:37:08] mind. They think that in their mind it's
[1:37:10] smarter than the gospel. It's smarter
[1:37:12] than the supernatural. It's smarter than
[1:37:14] spiritual things." He said in the vanity
[1:37:16] of their mind that they reason. They
[1:37:18] they they try to figure the whole Bible
[1:37:20] out, but with some kind of logical
[1:37:22] explanation or something like that over
[1:37:24] the spirit of God moving. But you
[1:37:26] realize that spiritual things, brother
[1:37:27] Mark, they're not carnally discerned.
[1:37:29] Everything you believe is based on
[1:37:31] faith. If you couldn't believe in the
[1:37:32] resurrection, if you was trying to use
[1:37:34] your logic or reasoning, how can you
[1:37:36] believe a man could raise up from the
[1:37:38] dead? How could he destroy a temple and
[1:37:40] in three days build it up again? If was
[1:37:42] using the reasoning of a human mind, you
[1:37:44] could never believe in the resurrection.
[1:37:46] You could never believe in creation that
[1:37:48] a god could come down and take dirt out
[1:37:50] of the earth and breathe into it and
[1:37:52] make it a living soul and form a body
[1:37:54] out of it. Our logic don't allow it.
[1:37:56] Reason don't allow it. But our faith
[1:37:58] allows us to believe the spiritual
[1:38:00] things of God.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Don't walk in the vanity of
[1:38:03] your own mind because you can't even see
[1:38:05] the things of God from a carnal mind. It
[1:38:08] takes a spiritual mind to see the things
[1:38:10] of God."
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Says, "So it ain't debated and fear." My
[1:38:13] Can you imagine going down and trying to
[1:38:14] explain to somebody Jesus saying,
[1:38:16] "Lazarus, come forth and a dead man come
[1:38:18] wobbling out of a grave with grave
[1:38:20] clothes on." Can you imagine me taking
[1:38:22] this water and dumping it out of this
[1:38:23] bottle and it turning into wine? Why you
[1:38:25] can't? There's no reason to explain it.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Said, but it has to be. He said, so
[1:38:30] don't don't don't use the vanity of your
[1:38:32] mind. He said, because they walk after
[1:38:33] the vanity of their mind, then their
[1:38:35] understanding is darkened. See, now
[1:38:38] there's no light in their walk. They
[1:38:39] can't see truth. And because they can't
[1:38:41] see truth, they become ignorant to
[1:38:43] truth. I'm going right backwards through
[1:38:45] the scripture. So through ignorance or
[1:38:47] their lack of understanding, he said,
[1:38:49] now they become alienated with God. So
[1:38:52] they started this walk
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; and the vanity of the mind put a halt on
[1:38:56] my walk
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; and then all of a sudden I start taking
[1:39:00] a few steps backward. I don't know about
[1:39:02] y'all but
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; how many you don't have to raise your
[1:39:04] hand but we've all been there.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Take a few steps backward. It's the
[1:39:08] truth. Regressing don't even know why
[1:39:10] you're regressing. It's just the vanity
[1:39:12] of the mind before long. He said then
[1:39:13] they become alienated from God. Isn't
[1:39:16] that the truth? They become estranged or
[1:39:18] withdrawn, separated from God to where
[1:39:21] they they don't even have a communion.
[1:39:24] There's no fellowship. They become
[1:39:25] completely alienated with God. They're
[1:39:27] not they're not moved by the spirit of
[1:39:29] God anymore.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; They're alienated from God. God can't
[1:39:33] speak to them. They get into this place
[1:39:35] of bondage. You say, "Well, what got
[1:39:36] them there?" It was because of the path
[1:39:38] they walked down.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; And Paul says, "But don't take this
[1:39:42] path. Don't go down the path of regress.
[1:39:45] the musicians want to come said these
[1:39:47] aren't the steps that we ought to take
[1:39:49] as a believer as a born again Christian
[1:39:51] don't walk backwards but walk forward
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; don't take the path of regress
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; but take the path of progress
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; friends let me tell you if you've heard
[1:40:02] if you've heard of Christ Paul said then
[1:40:04] when you hear of Christ you may be
[1:40:05] walking this way
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; step by step going backwards they aren't
[1:40:10] big steps you ever notice that when a
[1:40:12] person comes to the Lord a lot of times
[1:40:13] it's a big step they it's drastic things
[1:40:16] change in their life. It's a great
[1:40:18] outpouring of the Holy Ghost. Drastic
[1:40:20] things happen. It's a great big step
[1:40:22] that they take forward. They go be
[1:40:24] baptized. All their friends see it. It's
[1:40:26] posted on on social media. I gave my
[1:40:27] heart to God. It's a great big step.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; But the step backwards is never as big
[1:40:32] as the steps forward.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; They're always just small. Just some
[1:40:36] little step, little thoughts. And said
[1:40:39] Paul said it come from the vanity of our
[1:40:40] mind.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Just little steps. Isn't it so easy?
[1:40:43] little steps back.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; I I don't know about all that anyway.
[1:40:48] You know,
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; after all, I've been believing the
[1:40:50] rapture for a long time. And
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; here we are 60, 70 years down the road.
[1:40:56] Rapture still ain't the church is still
[1:40:57] here. Still the same struggle, the same
[1:41:00] trials, the same problems. And people
[1:41:02] are acting worse now than they ever did.
[1:41:05] People used to love one another. They
[1:41:06] used to go to church and tell people
[1:41:09] they loved them, put their arm around
[1:41:10] them, and there was such a unity. Now it
[1:41:13] just seems like every man's after
[1:41:14] himself. People become so selfish. I
[1:41:17] don't even think there is any love of
[1:41:19] God left. It's just small steps through
[1:41:22] the vanity of our mind.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "But don't walk this path.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Don't walk the path of regress,
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; but walk the path of progress."
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; See, how do you do it? He said when they
[1:41:37] met Jesus,
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; see sometimes
[1:41:40] you realize that you realize that when
[1:41:43] Paul was walking down the road to
[1:41:44] Damascus, it was not a forward walk.
[1:41:49] I mean, he may have been walking that he
[1:41:50] was actually he was further and further
[1:41:52] away from God. He didn't even know it.
[1:41:53] He was going out killing Christians.
[1:41:56] But whenever Jesus met him, so even even
[1:41:58] if you're going backwards, someplace in
[1:42:00] this road that Christ comes to everyone,
[1:42:04] he said, "I've never lost a one." And
[1:42:07] some place in this road, he comes down
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God, it softens our
[1:42:11] heart. What was some old hard thing, and
[1:42:13] begins to deal with our heart, says,
[1:42:16] "Don't don't give up on me. Don't you
[1:42:18] you know, you you've heard this. Maybe
[1:42:20] it was a long time ago. Maybe you heard
[1:42:23] somebody say you was just a little boy
[1:42:24] and you you wanted to have a a walk with
[1:42:27] God, a real experience with God and you
[1:42:28] made a you made a commitment. Things
[1:42:30] happened in your life. Maybe your family
[1:42:32] let you down. Your dad, your mom, they
[1:42:33] all let you down. It caused you to go
[1:42:35] into this kind of place. He said, "But
[1:42:38] then when he would meet him,
[1:42:40] Paul said, then you can put off the
[1:42:43] former conversation of the old man and
[1:42:46] all that corruption according to all
[1:42:47] these deceitful lust." But when you met
[1:42:50] Jesus, be renewed in the spirit of your
[1:42:53] mind. So, every thought that was
[1:42:56] planted, I'm going I'm going to be
[1:42:57] honest with you. Every thought that was
[1:42:59] planted, it come from a devil, but every
[1:43:02] thought that was planted, it was
[1:43:04] renewed. Renew the spirit of your mind.
[1:43:07] Isn't that wonderful that God every
[1:43:10] single seed that was planted that Satan
[1:43:12] put there that in just a moment in the
[1:43:14] presence of almighty God that all them
[1:43:16] seeds are washed away.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Just to take them out. I I don't want to
[1:43:20] let the devil take root in their mind.
[1:43:22] He said because so we're renewed in the
[1:43:24] spirit of our mind. All of a sudden
[1:43:25] there's a refreshing comes. He said then
[1:43:27] you put on the new man which after God
[1:43:29] has created in righteousness and true
[1:43:31] holiness and all that old man that you
[1:43:34] put you've been building up on you all
[1:43:37] those old garments you've been built
[1:43:38] garments of hate and garments of malice
[1:43:40] and garments of of all this this these
[1:43:44] evil things. But now you replace it with
[1:43:47] a garment of holiness
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; and a garment of praise and a garment of
[1:43:51] worship and a a garment of the spirit of
[1:43:53] God. He said, "Now you put on the new
[1:43:55] man." Isn't that wonderful? You can you
[1:43:57] can clothe yourself in the new man which
[1:43:59] after God has created in true holiness.
[1:44:02] Paul says, "So don't you never give
[1:44:05] place to the devil."
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; So even every believer, do you realize
[1:44:10] every believer? He said he he can come
[1:44:12] in just a few moments. He can start you
[1:44:15] back down that path again. Just a few
[1:44:17] moments and don't ever somebody say it.
[1:44:18] Don't give place to the devil.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Don't give him no places. You want to
[1:44:22] stand to your feet. Let me tell you why,
[1:44:25] Sister Destiny. Because we're not
[1:44:26] walking with the devil. We're walking
[1:44:28] with God.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; It ain't our relationship with the
[1:44:32] devil. It just it's so it's so bad
[1:44:34] sometimes. People share their testimony.
[1:44:36] seems like their whole testimony,
[1:44:37] everything they tell you about their
[1:44:38] life is is their relationship between
[1:44:40] them and the devil. Well, I struggle
[1:44:42] with this and I struggle with that and I
[1:44:43] can't get over with this and man, I said
[1:44:45] this, I shouldn't have done that. It's
[1:44:46] all everything they tell you is their
[1:44:48] relationship. You and the devil got
[1:44:50] quite a relationship. That's all you
[1:44:51] ever talk about. But how about your
[1:44:53] relationship between you and God? And
[1:44:56] God spoke to me this morning. He put a
[1:44:58] He put a zeal in my heart. He put a
[1:45:00] refreshing. He he he done something. And
[1:45:02] he he he caused me to walk close to him.
[1:45:06] You realize you can walk so close to God
[1:45:09] that the world can't even have no effect
[1:45:10] on you.
[1:45:12] Noah's family was saved because he
[1:45:15] walked with God.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Enoch raptured because he walked with
[1:45:19] God. You know what that tells me?
[1:45:20] Whenever you walk with God that your
[1:45:23] family is saved and you're on your way
[1:45:24] to a rapture. That's what it tells you.
[1:45:27] That your family is saved. You're on the
[1:45:29] way to a rapture. It's a walk of grace,
[1:45:31] friends. Don't try to put nothing else
[1:45:34] in it. It's a walk of grace. It It ain't
[1:45:36] a walk of law. It ain't It ain't a walk
[1:45:38] of legalism. It's a walk of grace. It
[1:45:40] ain't nothing you can do. It's what God
[1:45:42] does. You said, "How do I walk down this
[1:45:44] walk of grace?" Just surrender to God
[1:45:46] and let God lead you every step of the
[1:45:48] way. Quit trying to fix yourself and put
[1:45:51] on all these old outward garments to try
[1:45:54] to be somebody in the gospel and just
[1:45:56] surrender to God and let God work on you
[1:45:58] from the inside out.
[1:46:01] Why is there so much trouble? I wonder
[1:46:03] if you want to bow your heads this
[1:46:05] morning.
[1:46:07] If you could say, "Brother, man, I
[1:46:08] know." God bless you, brother, sister.
[1:46:11] Lord bless you. I know. I know that I've
[1:46:14] I found myself in that place. I've
[1:46:17] struggled. I recognize my struggle is
[1:46:19] because I try to do things myself. I
[1:46:22] try. It's because our flesh. I I I I try
[1:46:25] to do this to be to be worthy and and
[1:46:28] and then because I I have a bad day or
[1:46:30] some bad thought in my mind, well then I
[1:46:32] can't I have so much condemnation, I
[1:46:34] can't even come to church and praise the
[1:46:35] Lord. It it it's caused me to go down a
[1:46:38] bad path. I never could be good enough
[1:46:41] on my own. But I wonder how many this
[1:46:44] morning if you say, "Brother man, I
[1:46:46] while I have an opportunity while the
[1:46:49] spirit of God is moving in this
[1:46:50] building, maybe I could just surrender
[1:46:53] to the spirit of the grace of God."
[1:46:57] I don't want to surrender to the law,
[1:46:59] friends. I'm not asking you to surrender
[1:47:00] to a church, not to surrender to a pa a
[1:47:03] pastor or I'm asking you to surrender to
[1:47:07] the grace of God. Say, "Lord, I need
[1:47:09] your grace in my life. I I I don't know
[1:47:12] how I got into this place, but I can't
[1:47:14] even seem to pray to get back to where I
[1:47:16] used to be. Just seems like the devil's
[1:47:19] done taken that out of my life. And he's
[1:47:21] told me I I that's the last time I'll
[1:47:23] ever be there. It already happened. I'll
[1:47:25] never be able to go back to that place
[1:47:26] again. Friends, let me tell you, that's
[1:47:28] the vanity of your mind to walk you
[1:47:31] backwards right into a trap. But
[1:47:33] friends, let me tell you what the devil
[1:47:35] don't know is on that road that God is
[1:47:38] going to meet you there. And I believe
[1:47:41] that this morning. I believe he's met
[1:47:42] every one of you in this place to say,
[1:47:44] "Here is the grace of Jesus Christ." And
[1:47:47] he's met you on this walk and says, "But
[1:47:49] would you would you just surrender to
[1:47:51] the to the walk of grace? Surrender to
[1:47:55] the grace of Jesus Christ." Let's just
[1:47:58] pray this morning. Gracious heavenly
[1:48:00] father,
[1:48:02] Lord, we just thank you for your spirit
[1:48:04] here this morning, God, to see you
[1:48:07] dealing with our hearts. And Lord,
[1:48:10] knowing that only your word can do it,
[1:48:12] Lord, you said that your word was a
[1:48:13] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:48:15] intents of our heart, God. And we
[1:48:17] believe that this morning, God, I've
[1:48:20] seen you move and speak.
[1:48:22] Lord, spirits that have been broken this
[1:48:24] morning just at the preaching of the
[1:48:25] word, God, these demonic powers, Lord,
[1:48:28] if people could could see with a natural
[1:48:31] eye what's taking place in the spirit
[1:48:32] realm, these demonic powers, Lord, that
[1:48:35] would destroy the children of God. But
[1:48:38] Lord, here sons and daughters of God,
[1:48:41] Lord, that you've called, Lord, they
[1:48:42] belong to you, Lord. They were with you
[1:48:44] before the foundation of the world.
[1:48:47] Lord, every devil in hell is against
[1:48:49] them coming to their place in grace. But
[1:48:53] Lord, I just ask you this morning, Lord,
[1:48:55] that you'd be so merciful. Lord, that
[1:48:58] the very angel, the spirit of God that
[1:49:00] was in the the house of lot that day
[1:49:02] would take them by the hand, say before
[1:49:05] destruction would ever fall upon this
[1:49:07] place, Lord, let the hand of mercy lead
[1:49:10] us out. God, may you take us by the hand
[1:49:12] and lead us to a path of safety.
[1:49:15] Lord, we thank you for it this morning,
[1:49:18] God. May you pour your spirit upon each
[1:49:20] one, Lord. They may they find grace in
[1:49:22] your sight, Lord. May you be merciful
[1:49:24] unto them, God. May we draw closer to
[1:49:27] you, Lord. We love you.
[1:49:31] We thank you for all you do for us,
[1:49:33] Lord. You never fail us. You're such a
[1:49:36] merciful God, Lord, just to stand in
[1:49:38] your presence, Lord. How humbling it is,
[1:49:41] God, to know that you're moving in our
[1:49:43] midst, Lord. You're speaking to your
[1:49:45] children, God. How we thank you. We love
[1:49:49] you, Lord, this morning.
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:54] Thank you, Lord Jesus.

[1:52:17] I would rather

[1:56:07] is
[1:56:11] [Music]
[1:56:14] [Applause]

[1:56:29] cross.
[1:56:32] [Music]
[1:56:39] [Music]
[1:56:47] The crowd
[1:56:49] understand
[1:56:52] this one day
[1:56:54] by night
[1:56:57] the king would leave his throne.
[1:57:03] Just to put on
[1:57:06] the robe
[1:57:08] of an earthly
[1:57:11] man and feel the pain
[1:57:16] of flesh of common flesh and bone.
[1:57:22] Holding to
[1:57:25] walk down
[1:57:29] [Music]
[1:57:32] the ra
[1:57:34] to dark calary.
[1:57:37] [Music]
[1:57:40] All but the blood
[1:57:43] that Jesus shed. He signed my pardon.
[1:57:48] He
[1:57:50] said that I
[1:57:52] could still
[1:57:55] go free.
[1:57:57] And I say that I
[1:58:02] I can see
[1:58:04] go free.
[1:58:08] Tell me what kind
[1:58:11] of man
[1:58:14] would reach down
[1:58:16] his hand
[1:58:18] and do this for me.
[1:58:22] [Music]
[1:58:24] I'm so unworthy
[1:58:27] to live
[1:58:29] yet not fit
[1:58:32] to kill. But a man on the cross. He
[1:58:38] wrote my name
[1:58:41] in his will and said that I
[1:58:45] could steal
[1:58:48] free.
[1:58:52] Well, I never
[1:58:54] could cry. You ever just thought about
[1:58:57] it? Understand this one thing.
[1:59:01] Why the King of Kings
[1:59:04] would leave
[1:59:06] his throne?
[1:59:11] Just to put on
[1:59:13] this whole filthy robe of an earthly
[1:59:18] man
[1:59:20] and feel the pain of common flesh
[1:59:25] and bone.
[1:59:30] to later
[1:59:32] walk down
[1:59:34] that lonely
[1:59:37] path.
[1:59:39] Then
[1:59:41] to dark
[1:59:46] [Music]
[1:59:48] those blood red stains,
[1:59:52] they broke all of my chains.
[1:59:57] And now I I can still
[2:00:02] go free,
[2:00:04] that I say
[2:00:07] that I
[2:00:09] can still.
[2:00:11] How many's free this morning? Won't
[2:00:13] somebody just praise the Lord and then I
[2:00:15] say, "What kind
[2:00:18] of man?" Thank you, Lord. Won't somebody
[2:00:20] just tell him, "Lord, I thank you. I
[2:00:22] once was lost, but now I'm found. I once
[2:00:25] was bound, but now I'm free. Yes, my
[2:00:29] Lord, I was so unworthy
[2:00:33] to live.
[2:00:35] Yet I'm not fear
[2:00:38] to kill, but then a man on the cross. He
[2:00:44] wrote my name in his will
[2:00:49] and said that I
[2:00:51] can still
[2:00:54] go free
[2:00:56] that I know a man on
[2:01:01] the cross. He wrote my name
[2:01:06] in his will and said that I
[2:01:10] can still
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:13] free
[2:01:17] [Music]
[2:01:19] [Applause]
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:23] a man on the cross.
[2:01:26] He wrote my name in his will. He pinned
[2:01:30] it in his own blood.
[2:01:32] and said that I can steal
[2:01:37] for free.
[2:01:41] Amen. If you're free this morning, won't
[2:01:43] you give him a hand clap of praise?

[2:10:30] your pastor. And I sure appreciate
[2:10:34] [Music]
[2:10:36] appreciate you all. Appreciate my wife
[2:10:39] for serving. And I remember after we
[2:10:42] started this work, we was we lived over
[2:10:46] in Black Rockck and we had I don't know,
[2:10:49] we baptized 15 or so people. Sister
[2:10:52] Megan where she was the first first one
[2:10:55] came out the first day and got baptized
[2:10:57] and she'll never know what that meant to
[2:11:00] me.
[2:11:02] going through such a a battle to follow
[2:11:05] the leading of the Lord and and so many
[2:11:08] different people pulling you different
[2:11:10] directions and I can't explain how that
[2:11:13] how that that felt and try, you know,
[2:11:16] just having to follow the Lord. But we
[2:11:19] had our little service that morning and
[2:11:21] Sister Megan, her husband, came in and
[2:11:24] she she came in and gave her heart to
[2:11:25] the Lord. She's been here ever since.
[2:11:28] It's the uh first first convert in our
[2:11:31] our church and it's been a real blessing
[2:11:34] and a testimony. But when we got home
[2:11:37] that day, we were after the baptism, my
[2:11:40] wife was in there and we were praying.
[2:11:42] She getting ready to go to bed and she
[2:11:44] just started crying after a little bit.
[2:11:46] I said, "What's the matter?" And she
[2:11:47] said, "I just want to thank you for
[2:11:48] giving me a purpose." I thought here to,
[2:11:51] you know, go through our whole life
[2:11:52] looking for our purpose in our life with
[2:11:55] God and to find that there's there's
[2:11:57] nothing greater to to know what that is.
[2:12:00] I've I I chased everything to find that.
[2:12:03] But whenever you find something you know
[2:12:05] is just the Lord, then you then you just
[2:12:07] you could just surrender to it. And we
[2:12:09] sure appreciate you and allowing us to
[2:12:12] pastor you. and I appreciate you
[2:12:14] overlooking my failures and mistakes and
[2:12:17] and and allowing me to grow in this
[2:12:19] office and I pray God will bless each
[2:12:22] one of you. Love every one of you.
[2:12:24] There's so many I could go down the
[2:12:26] whole list. I'd love to take all day and
[2:12:28] tell about what every one of you mean to
[2:12:30] me because you all do. Every person,
[2:12:32] there's something that you've done
[2:12:33] that's impacted my life. And I thank you
[2:12:36] all for doing that. I thank y'all for
[2:12:38] being real believers and Christians that
[2:12:40] I can look up to and model my life
[2:12:42] after. So, I say God bless you. God
[2:12:44] bless y'all this morning.
