is for us to be here with you in these meetings appreciate the mat inviting Carol myself to come it's um a great privilege always to speak to the bride of Christ let's turn if you would tonight to the Song of Solomon chapter 2 verse 10 Song of Solomon chapter 2 verse 10 great all the min brothers that are here tonight certainly appreciate you all being here as well Song of Solomon chapter 2 verse 10 The Song of Solomon is a very unusual book The Hebrews would not even let their children read The Song of Solomon until they were uh young men and young women and it's was called called the holiest of holies of the Old Testament Canon of scripture so that tells you a lot about the way that they looked at it and we know that it's a story about Christ and his bride which is us us here tonight hopefully and and our lord Jesus let us um we'll break into this story now in in chapter 2 verse 10 my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away for Lo the winter is passed the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth and the time of the singing of the birds has come and The Voice of the turtle or the turtle dove actually is the Hebrew there the voice of the turtle is heard in our land the Fig Tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one and come away now when you read read this and realize what we were in comparison to what this says it's truly A great miracle chapter 4 verse 16 now it's back and forth between him and her he will say certain things and she will say certain things and here in chapter 4: 16 it's her now now listen to how she beckons created nature to come and reflect what he has made in her so that he can be able to enjoy the fruit of his labor awake Oh north wind and Come Thou South so she's beckoning The North Wind and the south wind and blow upon my garden and listen the reason why that the spices thereof May flow out and this is what I want to speak to you tonight let my beloved come into his garden let my beloved come into his garden and eat his Pleasant fruits can we bow our heads together oh our dearly beloved we who were former thorns and brambles and briers and bushes we stand in your great presence tonight thanking you for what you have done for us there's not a person in this building that was Worthy of the grace that you've given to us but we know it's not because of our worthiness but because of yours but then we also realize as we read in the Book of Revelation that when you spoke to one of the church ages and you told them you will walk with me in white for you are worthy so the only worthy one that there was shared his glory and honor with this Bramble this Thorn this bush which seemed worthless and you transformed Us by your grace as we heard about it last night so beautifully expressed Lord I pray that You' take your word and speak to us tonight father May there be things of Eternal value that'll be accomplished out of these meetings as we've gathered together and we know in order for that to happen it'll take you to do it as great as some of these gifted men are and how they've studied and prayed and it still takes that divine intervention so help me tonight Lord that I'll get out of the way shut my mouth to anything that would displease you speak to us father we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated early on in the Book of Genesis we can see that a garden has a very important place in the Providence of God man actually was made outside of the Garden of Eden and then the Bible says that God placed him in the garden so he made him on the outside and the prophet said that Eden was like a state and then the Garden of Eden would have been like a city inside the state so man was made on the outside and then brought and positionally placed in the Garden of Eden and it was a beautiful we know Paradise of God and we know that the Garden in in the Bible and the typology has such great significant stories to tell us we know that man actually forfeited his rights to godship in the Garden of Eden so if it was lost in a garden it must also be regained in a garden Adam forfeited his rights of godship in the Garden of Eden the prophet tells us in forsaking all in 1962 that Jesus forfeited his rights to sunship to become a curse for you and I where in Pilot's Hall in the garden of gimon that's right Simon which is the garden of the olive press so there the olives were put in the press and the precious oil was ground out of them to anoint a bride and his presence it makes us feel sad in our hearts whenever we read the Bible and and read the message of the hour and realize that there are billions of people that will live on the face of the Earth and they're not quickened into the same privilege that you and I have been given they will live their mortal life and some of them will go to church and some of them will be saved people but they'll never be able to walk where God has called us to walk and that doesn't make us better than them it just means we found favor in his eyes if you're familiar with this story of The Song of Solomon you know that it was Solomon out on a journey looking in a certain part of his kingdom and he saw this girl that we don't know her by name but she was called the schula might or schula Smith and she was a very poor girl and she didn't know anything about royalty she didn't dress Royal talk Royal just a very poor girl but she found favor in the eyes of King Solomon and the word shulamite is the feminist form of Solomon so it was Mr and mistress Solomon sort of like Mr and miseries Jesus Christ you imagine how difficult that it must have been for her her thinking had to be totally changed she looked at herself early on in the Song of Solomon here and she says I am black but comly and she tells us that by being out in the fields and keeping her father's flocks and how that her family was kind of abusive to her and even her siblings how they had treated her and she was look down on the Cinderella I guess we'd say of the family and one that anyone would never look at her and think that there was anything of notoriety about her that she was nothing Noble even in her own family much less that a king would fall in love with her so it must have took quite some time being in the courts of the king himself to change her sinking from what she was to what he kept telling her that he saw that she was which is not the same thing at all and the Bible we know that the Bible is silent on a lot of these things in the scripture and the prophet tells us that the Bible condenses its truths and we know that that's right and we don't really have a lot of the insight to be able to go with her when the Mighty Men took her there and when they went into the into the great Union and she became his wife and we don't we don't have much to to go on to see what it must have been like but can you imagine with me tonight what a difficult time that it must have been for her transitioning from being a woman in this very poor part of the land of Israel and she is no doubt predestined as far as what she thinks she'll never amount to anything shall never be anything maybe like some of you were were and like we were told and that would never amount to nothing would never be anything and then all of a sudden we heard something one day that called our name and it called us Beyond ourself and as she was still transitioning and we if you read this whole book sometime when you get time seven eight chapters do it doesn't take that long but you can watch as she starts responding in chapter one and then in Chapter 2 and it's like that she's becoming more revelated in her relationship to him now by the time that they they already join in Union we can see that she's she's accepting her her new given position that she has found favor in his sight but she's still trying to learn how to talk the way he talks because the way that she even relates to love even in the beginning of this book it's like that she capitalizes on her love for him and how she feels about him and she can relate easier to that and accept that easier than she can accept how he loves her and how he relates to her but you watch her and as he she's in his presence his presence is modifying and changing her more and more day by day and you imagine as she was taken into his presence and they changed her garments and the great trumpets must have sounded that day in Jerusalem and the bands were playing and the servants had brought her on his personal own buyer b i e ER and They carried her up and as he was he would have been it would have been been against a Divine protocol for him to go to her City and get her so the servants brought her to him but there was a great great noise of all the singing and the incense and all that was going on and the musicians that were playing and she was looking as she was coming outside now a country girl most of us I suppose here tonight probably country people and you can imagine now if you were leaving Walnut Ridge or Pocahontas and you were moving to New York City now if most of you feel about NYC the way I do they can keep that place as far as I concerned oh yeah but I am I am getting psyched up oh yeah to move into a city short amen Hallelujah but as as with her the king our King still has a hard time with us because uh I I don't think that probably most of us here tonight have still been totally convinced what our love and our praise and just little simple things like raising our hands and our voices and saying Jesus I love you so much and we just think what's the big deal about that do you know that angels of God cannot say that on the same level that you can to me this is why life is becoming so complex and so difficult for us as the seven seal people the people who have been in the day when the sounding of the word of God and the Mysteries that will produce a rapturing faith I'm sure most of you are not looking for another messenger an H day Prophet or whoever that's going to come and bring no surely we're beyond that right I am satisfied we have received the message of God for the last day and if Satan cannot get us sidelined on that he will try to get us so busy and so occupied not not with sin not with gambling and running slot machines and things like that just with life you be honest and say that tonight just was life and you say you never have enough time I'm still looking for them people that told me when I reached 65 everything slowed down cuz I'm fixing to be 69 in a few months and I found out a long time ago they done lied to me I I'm still looking for them people trying to figure it out I fall you know I had this in my mind I I lived in Kentucky and raised the he'll be the boy and you'd see old people and you had passed by in their house and they're sitting out there on their rocking chair I mean just hanging out out and doing nothing drinking tea you know eating moon pies just doing nothing the old farmer and his over RS and and the wife you know and they' take 47 naps during the day couldn't sleep a wink after midnight of course but I mean that's what life was and I'm realizing I ain't even got a front porch I ain't even got no rocking shares that wouldn't do no good I couldn't use them if I had them and what is it am I sinning am I lying no it ain't that it's life and why why it's all to deprive our king of what you and I alone can give him remember the prophet saying it's the father he said why do you hunger he said it's the father trying to get this Revelation known to you but it's the things of life that we just get so busy notice as she says oh she calls him my beloved let my beloved come into his garden you see when we are sure that he is ours on then it will bring us into a closer Place once we realize he is ours and we we are his I don't belong to the world I don't belong to the church now I'm going to bring it down to your greatest battle you don't belong to yourself most of us can have an easier time say no to the world no to drinking but our hardest battle is saying no to us come on now you know who your greatest enemy is tonight don't you you looked at him when you combed your hair before church if you got any left I mean and when you brush your teeth that's the greatest enemy you'll ever have is that right sure we can sacrifice for our wine somebody they need somebody in the church to sweep the floor Honey I volunteered you to do that well they need somebody in the church to cook devil eggs honey I volunteered you and they're needing some kids kids I volunteered you and Dad what are you going to do well I'm I'm golfing this evening I I'm going on a fishing trip oh my you see the Revelation that the bride must come to before the resurrection can ever come to pass is our place in him amen so the bride calls herself his garden so she actually invites him notice the session that she gives him by claim is come to your garden for this is who I AML I'm Yours take me y'all remember when you gave your heart to God when you first got saved and then you got the Holy Ghost and you say man that was it I gave you my whole heart how we wish PR it ain't that easy I'll be 69 years old in July I gave my heart to the Lord when I was a 12year old boy I started preaching when I was 18 and I'm still finding there's little Corners over here a little places over there anybody in you're be honest with me tonight and say yeah that's me too so we're still giving more and more isn't it amazing is the great experiences that brother Bram had with God and yet when certain times would come in his life the opening of the seals and different things and the Lord would tell him separate yourself from these men for a visitation on a hunting trip remember that and he said the Lord was calling him for a place of more consecration to God so it's not like that we consecrate ourselves one time and that we're done with it it's like we come through stages of more and more and more and more and he said well you know it's just us and our church no you don't understand Peter James John Paul Bartholomew Matthew Mark there's millions of people that are waiting on you and I and the devil knows enough about this word to know if a mature bride does not leave this age there will be no Resurrection or Rapture all the ages for 2,000 years are waiting on you and I it ain't no wonder all hell is against us but I'm going to tell you here tonight all hell may be against us but all Heaven is behind us hallelujah all Heaven is behind this bride you are not by yourself I am not by myself we are joint hirs with Christ [Applause] Jesus Lord let my beloved want you Noti by now she's finally starting to see it that she doesn't see herself as a garbage [Music] dump you imagine the first time she said it I am his Delight he rejoices the prophet zephani says more of the most astounding statements that God said I Will Rejoice over you oh yeah and sing over you and we just look at one another you know well we're Arkansas Hillbillies y'all live y'all call this Hillbillies too these knobs and stuff okay all right and Kentucky Hillbillies and you some of you Flatlanders you know what we're talking about then we look well we're just we're just we ain't nobody listen bride it's time that your mentality changes listen the prophet tells us in Souls that are in prison now now the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer and there is the soul wow we will never bring the capping of this age come on by looking at ourselves as a garbage duck so she says let my beloved come into his garden so she expresses what where' she get this at he told her this himself but the gospel must be preached but it also has to be received that's right and then fed back in the same channel what good is preaching salvation to do if nobody says hey you know what I'm lost and I want to be saved then what do they do they accept it they believe in their heart and with their mouth they confess it I want to confess I'm a sinner but I accept Jesus as my savior what good would it do if they said unto the best preachers in the world and never accepted it and confessed it come on somebody the prophet said in law in Chicago 1955 he said many people say I'm not a good Christian I ain't got much faith and he named a a few things out what they said he said you should never say that because when you say that you are talking the devil's language the devil don't always use four-letter words the devil don't always cuss but some of the devil's language is you ain't good enough you're low down you made mistakes oh come on somebody sure one of the greatest challenges I believe in this last day is for the bride to believe what God says about her above what she knows about herself we know we've got shortcomings we know we fall short of the glory of God I don't know about you I'm sick and tired of looking at myself as a landfill I ain't a landfill I'm D all right but I'm looking at that deposit down inside of my soul and say I'm not landfill I ain't full of trash I ain't full of garbage I'm full of joy and love and peace and kindness and Temperance and forgiveness and godliness hallu oh Lord help me yes L she actually invites him to come into his garden and enjoy the Delights that are in his garden can you imagine that the Lord Jesus I'm walking down through Lowe's and I need some Plumbing stuff and I I'm G to refinish a piece of wood and I need some lacquer I need this and that and the other and I'm pushing the buggy checking my list as I walk down through there the presence of God comes near me he do you that way grocery store making the bed sister frying eggs you understand what that means to him don't think it just saved you and then he's waiting to see you over Yonder he wants to spend time with you every day of and we've got so much going on and what do we do the very last words that we say at night dear God remember the rent the house payment and Lord you know 15th of of April is coming very very soon tax time and you know this is coming and Lord I need that and I need that and Lord I need that remember this person remember that and that and that and that and then what to return and get back to him you know what I like to do sometimes I like to go and just leave my list out of my prayer closet I just come to worship you I just come to tell you how much I love you well he wants to hear my needs he wants to hear my desires and my petitions but I believe I was ordained before the foundation of the world to give him love to praise him to adore him you see she she identifies this Garden that's right as not being a shared garden with the world but she gives him total possession of this Garden because the possession belongs to him by purchase come on but it's also his by sewing the right contents now this is the thing I love about the Lord that all these preachers one day will stand before God and God will they'll walk up before him and all all you lay to as well and God will not before the Judgment seat hopefully we'll all miss that but we'll stand there for rewards yes sir and God gave us strength every day of our life and the brothers preached and God gave them time to study inspiration to study gave them favor with people and God orchestrated the whole thing and then God give them the strength to preach it give them the ability to Bear the burdens of the people and their fusses and their ups and downs and ins and out and God was the one who done all of that and then they're going to walk up in front of him and he's going to turn and reward them for everything they done for him when he was the one that helped them to do it for him and going to do you the same way you lay it to he gave you strength to overcome the habits in your life and then you'll stand there before him and he'll say come in blessed of my father come in blessed of my father enter into the joys of the Lord which were prepared for you before the foundation of the world as if though you done some great something when he saved you he Sanctified you he gave you the Holy Ghost and gave you the strength to overcome and then he says now look at what I've got for you you see the shift in in this chapter it goes from her calling it which she does prior to this one her garden my garden my garden my this and my that but by now chapter four and we know that four is the number of Earthly Deliverance so now she's understanding that she is not her own and what she's even able to do it's him giving her their strength to do it so she actually calls it his so she says come into my garden so this is yours so where where did all the fruits come from now she says Let the north wind blow and then let the south wind blow and then she gives plurality to the garden and said that there's Gardens of spices so in this Garden was spices and fruits almonds all types of nuts all different things and where did all that seed come from she didn't have that come on cuz in her first life she was a thorn oh yeah in her first life in her first breath on this Earth she was born defeated born lost that sounds like me that sounds like you and then what did he do he took us and changed us and made us in his very image some of us was in such a bad shape the devil didn't even have no hope for us I love brother wend saw my TR of the Lord that gave him that song devil we're through you had all these years to do all this with and look what you made out of us and look what Jesus done in a short matter of time isn't it amazing what God has done in our life lives but somehow we're still looking I'm afraid many times in the thing with what can I do for God and we look at our works as if though but we fall so short and we do but there's no way without him helping us that we can place the proper value on the way he looks at what he gets from us on notice in chapter 6 verse 2 my beloved has gone down and to his garden to the beds of spices to feed in the gardens and to gather lies so he now descends into the fruits and the nuts which we know now as a sign of age and maturity an apple tree may be there for years before it ever starts producing same with almonds macadamia nuts hickor nuts walnuts all kinds of different ones it will take them years but now she's moving up in chapter four all right to where that something is coming out in her life and she's able to look at it and finally see it herself you know maybe for years she had a little Buds and boy she shouted and I mean carried on with them Birds if Birds would make a shout what off the almonds to do oh come on somebody you realize friends that if Paul and Peter and the saints of God that have lived in the ages gone by if we could hear them speaking to us from the other dimension tonight they would be encouraging us press on children press on you children of the evening light because we are waiting on you remember when Peter left this Earth Earthly realm of mortality and mood into the sixth Dimension I know you know it already but yet Peter James John Paul all of those Brothers have not yet seen the Lord Jesus they have not yet seen the Lord Jesus it would be Unbecoming to him for them to see him in that high priest form can you imagine what we're waiting for Hallelujah we are waiting for him to change his garments to take off that Garment of the high priest Hallelujah as it did in the Song of Solomon and whenever his mother was the one who had made the embroidering and the crown and the the feast that they would have lasted for about seven days seven days when a Hebrew boy and girl would get married and whenever he was born they planted a tree for a boy when a girl was born they planted another tree for her whenever they got engaged and they'd signed the Covenant then they whenever they getting ready to consummate the wedding and say the last few verses then they would cut down his tree they would cut down her tree they would make two trees out of hers and two trees out of his then they would stretch an animal skin a tent called a hoopa they would stretch the Hoopa then the bride and the groom would step underneath there and there was their identity of their tree of life Hallelujah underneath there Hallelujah he would say to her be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel and he would take a drink of the wine and he would give it to her then he would take the cup and crush it under his feet then he would take the bride into the bridal chamber you ever wonder why it wasn't called the bridegroom chamber you ever wonder why even in our weddings here that we don't say Here Comes the Groom skinny as a broom how come we don't sing to the groom who do we sing to the bride it's written in our culture don't you understand all of Heaven is Waiting the angels are under anticipation and they are waiting for what they are waiting for a mature Bri but we're too busy we're too busy with this and that I hate to say but a lot of times preachers are too busy trying to get everybody to see what they see arguing over this fussing over that all of us dotting our eyes and crossing our tees friends I'm afraid that we've got an image in our mind that the Apostolic Church did not have they differed in their opinions Peter even wrote things about Paul said beloved brother Paul WR things it's hard to be understood and but yet somehow the devil has tricked us and thinking every message church every message preacher oh they can't have their difference opinion and where did you get that at they're going to agree on the teaching of the word of God the message of the hour that's right I'm not your absolute brother wayang no other preacher that's not our absolute the absolute is the word of God and will we have them difference of course we will just like a family I'm the oldest of seven kids my wife is the eldest of eight don't tell me you can't have bickering indifferences in your family but they're still my family they are still my brothers and my sister come on somebody I pray that God helps us and I I don't have to just pray this way and hope it'll be but it will come to pass as it did there when the Holy Ghost fell in the book of Acts you imagine the devil coming up in the upper room and saying you got to be kidding me you mean Jesus this Mighty God has left his church in the in the charge of these men right here you got to be kidding me they can't even get along they're arguing whoover who's going to have the biggest church and who streams more and who's got more hits on YouTube come on somebody there ain't no way in the world that them people ever do anything but all of a sudden there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting what happened the bridegroom come down and got in the garden Hallelujah the bridegroom entered by his presence into the [Applause] garden I would like to have been down inhale for just a few minutes after the upper room when them demons went down into hell and say Satan we have messed up come on we we we we we thought that we had this single and he came here he lived he died he raised and we thought it was over with I'm telling you we have messed up you see the devil probably wouldn't would in the upper room he was so busy doing other things he didn't think nothing was going to go on cuz them guys kept fussing and arguing and fighting and some of them saying we've already got it brothers and other said no we ain't already got it well I'll tell you one thing you don't agree with me in my theology John well Peter you sit down I'm tell you one thing come on I hope that ain't the cause why so many preachers still fussing around the message because they lack the Holy Ghost oh [Applause] Jesus you see them when they getting up man Brothers this is that yeah Hallelujah they said you got to be kidding that people's drunk Peter didn't deny they wasn't drunk he said we just didn't drunk like you think we're drunk I tell you one thing I hear the prophet of God say we should get so drunk on the holy ghost that we don't even know what her name is we're drunk on riches we're drunk on lead to why don't we get drunk on the Holy Ghost so we can get so lost in the presence of God that we can start crying out come Lord Jesus come Lord Jesus hallelu I wonder friends I wonder as our Heavenly bridegroom waiting to hear the reciprocating cry from his bride's voice to say come Lord Jesus I'm afraid for so many years we've said said wait a little longer please Jesus I've got a few more boats houses I'd like to win wait a little longer please Jesus all right come on he has a way of making us miserable though don't he now if you'll notice it's not him pushing himself in sir he could have it was his all right but there's one thing I love about him he's a perfect gentleman he's right here in this place tonight and he will give you as much of him as you will allow him to do and if you're afraid ofc like me or some of the rest of these Pentecostal people over here you know and you're so afraid you're terrified oh what if I would act like that what if I what if I would I don't care however he wants to bless me go you see by him blessing me if I look at it the right way I'm actually blessing him back see that's so hard for us to comprehend because it's our thinking of ourselves what what can I give him come on sh she says he's gone down into his garden he's gone down yes into his garden so the groom's Union with the bride produces this phrase that is written about her in chapter 4 my garden my sister my spouse so he actually calls the bride his sister you didn't know that well that's that's in your Bible look turn look if you want to I don't care my sister my spouse don't youy to understand what makes you different than church members you and Jesus have got the same daddy that's right and it ain't Joseph Lord God children what our brother talked about last night it's not this yes it's not this year this is only the dirt but we keep focusing on this one are we ever going to get past this and look at on the inside of you is a representation of almighty God come on come on my beloved has gone down into his garden to the beds of spices you see when he joins with her then she becomes a garden enclosed which would be quite easy to understand when you look at what would have been in that Mediterranean area and I've been there I know was foxes as you know the little foxes that spoil the vines you remember that in the scripture there would be jackals there would be different animals so what good would it do to have all of this garden and all this work and all this money tied into it and then not have it enclosed in a wall so the wall when the Wall comes and seals her Hallelujah so she's an open work until she gets sealed so she can have Great Tribulation or great trials and Jubilation and trials and test and all all this can go on and her fruit is there yeah glory to God thank you Lord Jesus but because she's not enclosed yet her Joy can Trickle and get away from her so quick and she's up and down and in and out so he wants to come down and join together with her in a union and when he does he completes the wall around her and encloses her inside the wall now you see this is one thing that separates us from the rest of the world and the rest of the world look at us they look at our youth and our our sisters and they look at them and they say poor old things them poor little old girls look at them look at them poorly little things most of them ain't never had the haircut they ain't never had them p pink lips and my goodness purple hair and green hair and look at them poly those things I feel so sorry for them look at them women got that long hair and why're they're held in a prison well you see what they're looking at they're looking at our wall but they don't realize what that wall is to them it's a prison to us it's an enclosure of safety hallelujah our souls are sealed in behind the wall of the Holy Ghost it keeps the Coyotes out it keeps the foxes out it keeps the jackles out amen thank God for a wall around the bride a wall of separation that separates us from the world we don't want to look like the world we don't want to act like the world we don't want to talk like the world and we don't do it because this legalism we could go out if we want to but we don't want [Applause] to I'm going to tell you tonight I've got all the girlfriends I want I drink all I want to drink I lie all I run a r i Rob all the banks I want to Rob y'all too I just don't want to do that sort of thing let me give you a little analogy here tonight if God told you right here tonight I'll give you seven days I'll give you seven days to do anything you want to do come on my whatever it is all limits took off and exactly a week from tonight at this exact time I will forgive you for every one of those things and it'll be as if though nothing ever happened on and you tell me from your soul what you choose I'll tell you where you got the Holy Ghost if God want to tell me that it scared me to death I said no no I don't want none of that stuff Lord I don't want none of that why because my Nature's Been Changed by a new birst he deposited that something inside of me brother Wayne quoted it last night to as many as as they heard his word to he gave the power to become the sons of God the word power excuse you Authority jurisdiction to become I love that word power to become the sons of God and it was a prophecy to come to pass you are a word from God you are a word from God and you oh Hallelujah you are coming to pass praise God Saints we are coming to pass Hall come into your [Music] G but you see it's like us as humans because of this dirt still that we're dealing with that we keep putting it off you know I mean yeah sure when I overcome this I I'll have I I I'll have the joy that I need after I over come this trial this this one here presently you know and then after that I I'll I'll be better and then you get over there you still don't have it and you're waiting to where you can have that joy and peace and don't try to sell what pleases him so much when you're going to all hell but it don't stop your praise it don't stop your attendance to church come on I'll tell you one thing a lot of I think sometimes demons in some way has got more sense than a lot of Christians a lot of Christians get discouraged and they do one of the worst things they can do to stop going to church every time demons come to church they get whooped they get wore out you imagine the devil every message church that dude goes to and the anointed men of God they get out there they expose him they tear the hide off of him they call him the offest bunch of names that ever was and he comes back every service he's the most faithful member I've got I preached to him for years and years I've told him everything I've told him he's going to hell he'll nod his head and said that's right I'm going to hell ony you're alive I'm alar that's right you you low down no good for nothing you're lying to God's people I tried I'm lying to God's people I'll see you Wednesday night Donnie well you come back devil I'm going to burn you hide but at least he's got enough sense to come back because maybe he's thinking he can read in the back of the book just like you and I can he sees where he's going to wind up you can read in the back of the book and see you win and you act like the loser you act like the loser you're not the loser we are the winners by the power of Jesus [Applause] Christ Glory look what he does my beloved is gone down into his garden to the beds of spices to feed Lord have Merc to feed in the gardens to refresh himself and Delight himself how it must please him when you have a petition on your heart and you're so hoping he'll say yes but instead he gives you a flat no and gives you no explanation and it absolutely breaks your heart but you still have spices to offer toall my beloved has gone into his garden to the beds of spices this kind of Christian I want to be yes sir I don't want to have just a little tiny pot about that big you know I know it's getting close to Springtime and I've already seen the Bonnie plant truck out and about you know going to Lo here and there but I I don't want to be a kind of Christian like this I've got a little Tu but two inch plot in my life and I've got just barely enough joy to keep from being stinking miserable and I've got just enough forgiveness to forgive brother Wayne if he trespasses me not much not much excessive forgiveness glory to God I'm going to heaven Hallelujah well I hope not like that cuz I don't want to go to Heaven if you're going to be there like that but wouldn't it be awesome today if in your soul there would be a bed just an entire bed of forgiveness I ain't talking about being able to forgive those that you [Applause] like a matter of fact brother tells us eternal life is living for others and he said that's not living for the man that loves you but that's actually living for the man that would kill you if he could praise the Lord how many beds we got how many plant with well do we at least have some hope Hallelujah come on so you imagine you've got a bed of forgiveness and a bed of mercy and longsuffering and gentleness and kindness and the miraculous part about it is that don't run in your family cuz natur by GNA and genetics it may run in your family to carry grudges forever I mean anybody does anything against you you don't never forget them but all of a sudden the Lord God comes down inside of your heart and does something to change you and out of there start sprouting all these plants of forgiveness and mercy and kindness tenderness and gentleness and godliness and brotherly kindness my beloved has gone down into his garden to the beds of spices to feed in the gardens and together lies oh come on to crop them with the hand so this is what the word means to crop them the lies with the hand the L unlike an acacia tree which has quite a long lifespan it's not like the bris Kong Pine out in Arizona and some of the great gigantic Forest of the great Sherman Pines in California but the Lily has a very short lifespan but I want you to notice how that she sees him as he moves among the spices and he moves among the nuts and all the plants that's in her life but she notices that he has this particular interest about lies you see this is what children of God are compared to once that finish work of God is able to be made manifest in their lives so the Lord Jesus transforms them from as I said thorns and brambles and BRS and nettles and all those types of things and then out of the ground comes forth this little beautiful Lily but we know that the lifespan of the Lily is all in the hands of the maker I preached the funeral just the other day at the church and one of our sisters that went on to meet the Lord and they had these beautiful flowers on the grave on the casket so when I walked away and one of the brothers from the church works for that funeral home and he said brother Donnie these flowers will be ruined tonight they'll be killed he said you think I should ask some of the people if they'd want them I said yeah maybe maybe Brother Louie so Brother Louie asked my wife Carol and asked different ones and Carol gets a lily maybe a hydrangea was it Carol something three or four different things it just absolutely beautiful breathtaking in Beauty and when we left on this trip we went through Kentucky to see Carol's mom we left him in water in the kitchen by the kitchen window but when we get back home they will be drooped over dried they look terrible but I'm so glad that when the Great Master produces a lily of a child of God and he looks at their life at when they come to maturity in his eyes not always ours that he passes down through the garden of the Bride now remember what I'm preaching about tonight is you as a bride collectively around the world you as a bride that come here to this church and wherever Church you go to but also you as an individual but also gathered in the sixth Dimension come on I know you're aware of this we're getting more and more and more on the other side before long there going to be more there than they are here it happened to [Music] us be two years on October when the Lord reached down and picked a little Lily out of the flower garden of his bride when she was born her mother and I named her Erica Lee Reagan little old thing was mean on a copperhead when she was a little girl sneaking mean but when the bridegroom come down and built a wall around her and transformed her right I've seen her little life be effective so much to people around the world that never even better and for those of you that prayed for thank you in my eyes it was not time in her mama's eyes her husband's eyes two sets of beautiful twin girls 15 months apart but Papa come down and took that Lily and said you're mature you're mature she trusted him she believed him my son-in-law Lance told me the night he said brother Donnie I have such a hard time with some of the songs we sing at church he said because them were the same songs and he said I'd walk in the bedroom and she'd be laying in there hard enough strength to even get up out of the bed but she'd be laying there with her little hands raised up to heaven worshiping God and tears flowing down her us God still gathers the lies it might be an 18year old girl and we look and say no God no it's premature it's premature I can't believe that friends I cannot believe the devil can sneak one over on God and take my daughter your daughter your mother your father oh I'll tell you one thing I always go back to that sermon I know in 1960 oh you talking about it in encouraging one and it gives me that confidence brother Donnie do you understand I don't understand it looks like to me that them girls needed their mom more than ever before 18 and 16 they need their mama how can their grandparents try to raise them I don't know but I know my God makes no mistakes and this is what I've offered him oh Hallelujah during this time out of the bed of my garden love and praise and adoration I don't understand I don't know why and I I asked him and I asked him and he broke my heart but you know what I did I didn't stop preaching I didn't quit Church well I ain't going back to church no more absolutely not I went right back to church and preached again and if you want to know tonight where I stand I'm standing right on the word of God and I'm still praying for people with cancer and I've seen God move for people with cancer and I've seen God perform Miracles that's right and healings and deliverance my God makes no mistake and what can we give back to him when we're in the midst of trial take from the herb of my joy take from the herbs of my peace my happiness I give them back to you Jesus when it feels like my praise is gone when it feels like I don't have enough strength to raise my hands and say I Praise You Lord you say I ain't got nothing to praise him for yes you do he saves you didn't he he Sanctified he didn't you he gave you the Holy Ghost didn't you don't wait till everything gets perfect in your adversity open your life Lord can you imagine in heaven there's no way you can understand how difficult it is for a pastor whenever you lose a family member oh my before we ever buried my daughter I had to start counseling people my family some of my church family because they didn't understand why and I think who's going to counsel me yes sir I'm still counseling people and oh yeah the devil's whispered to me just like he does to you he loves you so much yeah again you don't know what it's like you hear the testimonies turned in at the church they played a short video here just a few weeks ago of a man that wasn't even a message believer one in a million people care one in 10 million people had this rare form of whatever it was a Baptist rode him up in a wheelchair and we laid our hands on him and then they sent a video back where the man was sitting up at his at his table around the table with his wife praising God now that's wonderful isn't it but you know what the devil does to you you know what he done to me sitting back in the office come on ahuh now you said he loved you well explain that to me Preacher Man you pray for that man he wasn't even a believer and God heard your prayer and answered your prayer and done a miracle and your daughter needed one and he slammed the door in your face no he didn't no he didn't he just answered in a different way I wanted to nurture the Lily and God wanted to pick the Lily and God took the Lily home come on S maybe you're sitting here tonight and you're still wondering and questioning what about this one what about that one yeah I go right back to that little stat clap baby and I've read the devil that quote on you better over and over again and that sister later she said brother bam did I have enough Faith he said Oh Sister you had great faith cuz when God said no you still believed him let me tell you young people whenever you're going through hard times and maybe you come to the service and you say God if you don't help me I can't make it another trial and the devil will fight you with everything that he's got and it seemed like God don't love you but stand your ground brother Donnie what what advice should would you give me praise him like you've never praised him before love him like you've never loved him before because that ministers to Jesus and it absolutely proves to Satan that there is a people on the Earth in the last day that love him more than Mama more than daddy more than their own life they're going to praise him and say Jesus I give you [Applause] praise you see when that little Lily comes to that full ripeness at the age of three five 10 20 44 and he says come on you see I saw what that cancer devil done to my daughter her long beautiful hair hanging way down here I saw what that chemo done I saw what them steroids done to her face and let me warn cancer tonight you've got one mad preacher on your hands and it robbed her of her beauty when her hair started falling out big handfuls and her husband got scissors and finally just cut it all off she wept and she cried but you know what we done we loved him we praised him you understand sometimes you can't shout yourself out of a battle sometimes you can't run out you ain't got enough strength but sometimes you praise yourself out you just say Lord the Lord give and the Lord took away blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah how many wants to be that kind of a Christian that the Song of Solomon is writing about when you're going through hell oh I hear the prophet say Lord you have broken my heart over and over again but I thank you for it it don't take much to praise God when God answers your prayer immediately and God gives you a miracle but what if God says no and God leaves you in a trial oh my friend think of brother Ron Spencer all the people that he's prayed for around the world and God's done great things and look at himself still fighting this battle brother Daryl ward has prayed for so many people around the world and he was out here visiting you all one time and called me crying laying in the motel floor because he had so much pain in his back laying in the floor of the hotel and he's legs up on the bed and said Brother D I don't think I've got enough strength to get to church WIll you pray for me yeah but you know what God done God moved for him and he come right to church and preached and blessed you Hallelujah why because he offered God spice of sacrifice he offered God nuts of praise and he offered God That Glory but did God heal him no he's still dealing with it come on so just in case you're wondering do preachers have a flowery bed of e well some of them might most of the ones I know don't they've got to be examples and how am I going to be an example how are these brothers going to be an example to their people we're going to worship when we don't feel like worshiping we're going to preach when we don't feel like preaching we're going to pray when we don't feel like praying we're going to go to church when we don't feel like going to church come on somebody and you know what you need to do you need to show up at your post of Duty because you being there is an encouragement to your pastor oh you say but I'm battling so much but it might be your very night that the Lord God is going to come down and walk into his garden and take joy and peace that you've given him and bring your victory that very night every departed Saint is a gathered Lily oh yeah thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah thank you and if I go by the way of the Grave I expect to see her again and I ain't just looking for my little girl since I've been to Tennessee there I performed my 153rd was it Carol fifth funeral last week since I've been there I'm waiting to see a lot of them you see if I'm alive when that Resurrection morning comes I'm going to have to have a pretty good size house and all to get in cuz I'm looking to see them Hallelujah this ain't a dream to me this is not an old man's imagination friends we on the very of the very Eve of the resurrection and it will be the bride what if it is laked to the bride saying come Lord Jesus come Lord Jesus come take us out of here oh Lord gather your lies hallelu and their souls start being released from the sixth dimension hu and the prophet going beyond the camp 1964 said think of it missing people they can't find you anymore but you're getting together with the rest of the group and together you come up missing on the Earth right now that sounds like fun to me yes sir oh you talking about that devil he laid a trap for you and a snare for you and on Monday morning he's going to set it and God has Monday morning time for the Rapture and the devil said yep I've got it set for that old boy today and God says yep I've got it set for my whole church today and all of a sudden the Devil comes up to you man he's fixing to bother you and all of a sudden you're wof you're gone and the devil said which way did he go which way did he go I don't know what happened he was there and now he's gone where are we we are missing on the earth Hallelujah getting together with the rest of the group why because the bridegroom is gathering his lies oh Hallelujah he's going to gather his bride Garden hallu I am my beloveds the Hebrew of that is literally I am full for my beloved oh yeah notice on Song of Solomon chapter 2: 16 the way in her young state that she identifies her attention and affection to him my beloved is mine and I am his he Feed Us among the lies so now she grounds her convictions more on his love toward her instead of her love toward him oh oh thank you Lord let my beloved come into his garden so while the spices of the Lord's Garden are manifesting themselves and one day it will be as we have read let me read it to you again and we'll we'll close Song of Solomon chapter 2 verse 10 my beloved spe and said unto me rise up Hallelujah my love my fair oneise and come away and the dead in Christ shall rise first yes sir and we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye Paul goes on to say for we believe that Jesus died and rose again then which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him when he comes I love the way he says it there in Corinthians then will be brought to pass the saying death is swallowed up in Victory what you think now wait a minute wait a minute why didn't Jesus fulfilled that verse come on come on that verse is left that's right for the shulamite what have you Paul had of the resurrection and yet he applied that when we are raised that's when death will be swallowed up in Victory it will be something like has never been before all over the face of the Earth India Africa Malaysia in the islands brother Andrew where you going next week all over the world I've stood in many of those places that didn't have electricity in their home a dirt floor mud walls in their church and when the rains come it washes their walls away and then they have to put the mud back up again but yet they had received the pearl of great price and I packed them little you know computer things and all that you would have think I gave them gold bars right to bring them message discs and and books and church AE books or seal books and you think oh my it's just like you brought on gold it was more precious than gold that's right what about it friends what about it are we thinking like wife on talking like wife acting like wife or are we still acting like slaves you remember the book of Exodus whenever God told Moses tell Pharaoh right tell Pharaoh let my son go now you see if God did not Elevate Israel plac ped a state of slavehood it was against the law to steal another man's slave God was not stealing Israel he raised their position that's right and said Israel is my son oh yeah so that changes everything that's right hallelujah hallelujah oh the devil claimed you but he couldn't see that seed that God put down inside 1965 now many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or a little girl there was something in you when you was a child you'd go to school and things like that and people would do other things and it just seemed like you couldn't do it it was that little representation from God it was there in you as our brother read it last night God spoke your name before the foundation of the world listen to me children my name is not just in the Book of Life my name is in the Lamb's Personal Diary which is identified as the Lamb's Book of Life you see God gave adam that Lamb's Book of Life and you and I should have come by a spoken word birth spoken word original seat 1962 the prophet said that Eve should have given birth to Isaiah she should have given birth to Christ she should have given birth to me but she bypassed that and gave birth to Cain instead of Christ and that's what a lot of the churches have done down Through the Ages they've given birth to a Cain a denomination onstead of Christ may God help us that we don't do the same thing why would we forfeit Christ for Cain why would we forfeit oh my a move of man which is nothing but death and we would trade off life hallelujah hallelujah and once God come back with that word through his prophet and the prophet positionally placed them by the word of God for that day Israel is my son oh yeah well you know what they could act different you imagine how hard that was to transition your mind from being a slave crack that whip you hear that whip cracked you jump whatever they said do you do it right but all of a sudden you catch a word from God from a prophet don't you understand why this message is so valuable to US list let's not think it what is something gone by you know something like a commentary it ain't a commentary it's a message that God sent us why help shape and change our thinking that's right come on you are what you think and if you think you'll never amount to anything you won't believe me I've lived with that much of my life come on brother my daddy told me that over and over again Donnie you'll never amount to nothing you'll never be nothing and it's amazing when I get down and get discouraged and get weary that I'll still think them same thoughts after all these years why to more seeds some here Y come on and it's easy to fall back so we fight through it if Donald Trump could get shot in the air and scream fight fight fight what about you bride and know I didn't vote for him I don't vote what I do to I voted for Jesus but if a man could stand up like that and say fight fight fight what about it young people can we stand and say fight fight fight we'll fight against sin we'll fight against compromise we'll fight against unbelief we'll fight against our schedules being so busy we're going to worship we're going to praise we're going to love him I'm going to love him when I'm down I'm going to praise him when I'm weary it's my god hallelu let's Stand Together hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] rise up my love my fair one and come away for L the winter is passed now remember there'll be no winter in the Millennium winter is God's curse on the earth in the Millennium it'll be gone imagine Jesus speaking this to his sweetheart for Lo the winter is passed the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth and you think you've seen beautiful flowers now oh my Carol had a sister that she loves so dearly fleshly sister they nearly killed her with with chemo and she went out of her body and she told her husband tell Carol and brother Donnie I love them and she went into this into this land she never did like certain colors of flowers but when she got there those colors were there and she liked them and the sky was so blue and the yellows were so vibrant yes and the Reds and the oranges oh Hallelujah you understand one of the things that make heaven so great is we won't just be young we'll all be changed and that part about you that don't like that sister sitting on the other end of the Pew that part about her will be changed but that's only half the story the part about you that don't like her it'll be changed too PR God and that's only the seventh day now remember we can't go straight into eternity from lead TOA we got to come back and fulfill the seventh day because Adam called God out of his Millennium God rested didn't mean God was tired God entered into his Millennium and Adam's need for Redemption put God's Millennium on hold and he called God out of his millennium so God didn't say all right fine forget it forget about it oh no ain't going to forget about it it'll restart again the seventh morning will start again yes sir praise God oh hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus can we just worship him a little oh we praise you tonight Jesus forgive us for being so busy Lord forgive us Lord when we're down and weary and we kind of Hold Back Our Praise from you we're sorry Lord I Hope Jesus during this time of Eric even Lord that I didn't hold back from you I hope I didn't keep back praise and love and adoration from you help me Jesus we worship you tonight Lord God I want my life to be a life filled with herbs fruits spices nuts praise and adoration but I can talk like you talk I can walk like you walk and one of these days I'll walk right out of this world into a new body Lord if there's any sick among us tonight would you let the presence of God pass through this building and deliver your children if there's any that's discouraged and weary May the angels of God pass through this place maybe there's some that need the Holy Ghost they get joy and they lose it they get peace and they lose it they need to become one with the bridegroom then they will become an enclosed garden and from that point on their Treasures are protected forever fill with the Holy Ghost tonight Lord pass by this way Jesus We Worship You Lord we bless your name father now with our eyes closed can we just raise our hands in his presence we worship ship you Jesus we give you praise our Lord we're going to praise you Lord all that's in US Lord From This Day on like never before we're going to praise you in the morning we're going to praise you in the new we're going to praise you in the good days when

will I say Lord you you are more precious than silver and Lord you are you're more worthy than go I know Lord you are more beautiful more than diamonds I say nothing that I desire compares to you isn't it wonderful tonight what a beautiful message what a beautiful message amen that the Lord would come and speak to us like that can I tell you something I guess it was Sunday after church and and uh me and my wife was sitting over at the house and all the kids was gone and so you know sometimes you're sitting around and reading and and uh may have been Saturday evening before but but we're sitting over there in the evening and I had my Bible out and I started talking about some things in the scripture and and uh she said you know I never never really heard that like that well I said well let me just read it so I turned over to the song of solom and sitting there in our living room I read the entire book of The Song of Solomon and I said in that odd how that he talks to her and then she talks back to him and after a little bit she took on his language and started we sat there in the in the living room and went went and read through that and just thinking about how that what God had done for us and I remember telling her I said that'd make a good sermon wouldn't it like yeah it would well praise the lord we heard it isn't it wonderful that that God would do something in you that isn't that what he's been trying to tell us all weekend that you could identify yourself or you could see yourself the way that God sees you my what a privilege it is to know how God feels about you if we could ever get to that place in our heart I know we live in a tough time we live in a challenged age you know here brother Donnie had ended that message and he was talking about how they were being called out of Israel and you know the the very cry that or the the the request that Moses made was let to let my people go that they could come into the mountain and worship me it was a call all that they would have the freedom to come and worship and and to praise their God and isn't it odd that whenever he made that request Pharaoh's response to Moses was get you back to your burdens and then he added more work on them and more burden on them he said if you got enough time to worship then you've got too much free time on your hands so I'm going to put a little bit more pressure but the Bible said God only allowed so much before he delivered them I thought isn't that something like our God even in the time you know why Satan put so much pressure on them because it was time to leave at the time of The Exodus he put pressure on them and added work to them and added pressure I thought here it is in the time of the Bride of Jesus Christ this is our our time of Exodus it's our time of departure is at hand and here we are living in the the age of greatest pressure but God has given us a way to overcome it amen isn't that wonderful amen I I don't think I can't think of anything else I'd rather have in this life than to have Jesus Christ is that your testimony can we sing that tonight will I'd Rather Have Jesus then silver or gold I'd rather be his than have riches UNT I'd Rather Have Jesus then houses or lands and I brother be led by his name Pier hands than to be a king of a vast domain and be H in sins dread yes I'd rather have Jesus [Music] than that this world AFF for today yes I would rather have Jesus and worldly Applause I would rather be faithful to his de oh I'd rather have my Lord Jesus than worldwide Fame can I'd rather be true won't you sing it tonight to His holy name than to be a king of a vast man and beeld in sin Dre s oh I would rather have Jesus than any anything that this world of Force to yes I would rather I wonder how many can truly say that tonight then all the men's Applause Lord I'd rather be faithful to your dear call I would rather have Jesus and world what Fame I would rather be true to His holy name than to be the king of a vast domain and be held in sin dread s well I would rather have Jesus [Applause] than that this whole world afford today amen won't you give him a hand clap of praise tonight amen I couldn't think of anything greater to have this life nothing that we could gain it would be any greater than Jesus Christ I know he puts a lot of the devil puts a lot of stops in our way to try to hinder us but you know what I think we ought to do is turn around to the devil and say I'm going on with Jesus just the same I wonder how many here tonight can say brother Matt that message was for me Satan he's tried to stop me he's been battling my mind he's tried to to uh put me down and take the joy of the Lord go ahead and be honest tonight I'm going to lift my if I could hold them both and still talk I would but he tried to take the joy of God out of our life but here God would come by tonight and speak to you directly and say is there a little bit of something still blooming I wonder if there's any is there a flower still blooming in your garden tonight I wonder how many can stand in the face of the devil and sing that old song say well I'm going on with Jesus just the same I'm going on with Jesus just the same I know he's made you want to quit you can talk about about me or scandalize my name but I'm going on Jesus just the same well the narrow ways a straight way it has no

here there ain't no room for the devil so I think we ought just put him in his place and go on and worship God anyhow sir put him in you know you know that's that's the only way is to put him in his place you say well brother mat I I got to get the devil where belongs so you me tell you the only way you'll ever get the devil in his place is when you get into yours preach it when you get into your place then the devil has to get into his and God has given us a position in the word of God as a Son of God he told me who I was he told me stop looking at my flesh this old dirt because he got brought grace that brought me out of it and out of that Garden of dirt is growing flowers to my God the the stature of a perfect man right of that old God I'll tell you what I don't know what y'all heard this weekend but I think we need to put the devil in his place you got all kinds of people trying to tell you you can't make it and you'll never be good enough or or you you can't be a Christian you can't be a believer the your friends tell you've gone too far your your loved ones tell you gone too far and you can't be a real Christian you'll never make nothing you'll never be a preacher you'll never be a singer you'll never be able to be a servant of God but I think we need to to put the devil in his place B said we're listening to the wrong thing he said even when the doctor says you can't get well he said that's when you're wrong that's just a devil standing there trying to poke things into you so it don't matter what it is if it ain't line with the word of God it's the devil trying to poke it into you so I think we need to turn around and look at him don't look at your wife but we need to turn around and look at the Devil and tell him you ain't got no right to do that and put him in his place you don't ever have to accept it said that's all we got to do I believe they are that we're called of God but the devil just makes a puppet out of them to push them around from place to place but we need to tow the mark with him and call the scripture on his hand so I say Devil by the word of God I'm a Son of God by the word of God I'm a believer I'm a blood bought Son of God the creator of Heaven and Earth has created in me a new life and put the devil in his place how many can do it tonight won't you give a hand clap of praise to the Lord let let me tell you the truth isn't it wonderful when you come to church I feel like having Church y'all may as well let me it's the only place I know you can come in Bound and you can go out free that's what happened to the Hebrew children isn't it something when they went into the fire the same fire that burned those that judged them is the same fire that set them free they said well I'll put enough fire on them I'll make it so hot that they can't do nothing and it'll take their life but all it did was burn the one that judged them and it caused their hands to come free that they could worship their God so I say in the midst of the fire let's lift our hand and put the devil in this place we got a ride to praise God how many can do it tonight we're going to tell him like this I'm so tired of you Satan you've had me bound up way too long so I'm going to raise my hands is there somebody can raise your hands to the Lord tonight I'm going to sing me a happy song well you said I couldn't make it you told me

effects of the devil on people you know why cuz I know what it's like to be bound I know what it was like when I couldn't raise my hand and I couldn't feel free and I couldn't worship God I was so bound up by so much Theology and every other kind of different person's opinion about it but then one day I I was out there in the woods and I was just to praying talking to the Lord and there's such a joy came on me it didn't matter who was looking and who was around nobody's opinion mattered anymore I was alone with my God and I determined in my heart that when I come to worship God I'll worship him that way I didn't I don't worship because of anybody around me it ain't because who's watching or who ain't watching it's me alone with my God and I think we should put the devil in this place tonight he's we're free he told me not to sing come on now how many how many testify about that how many say the devil's told you that he told me not to shout but I'm going to take the word of God and drown the devil out I'm so tired of your Satan you've had me bound too long I'm going to raise my hand to heaven I'm going to sing me Happy song you said I was a weak Christian you said I had no power
