and Lord Inspire something to your heart it just there's a Zeal that that we have to want to be able to present it to people that would it would be edifying to you so let's just read out of Matthew the 24th chapter and the 28th verse and and I'll allow you to be seated the Bible says for wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together and the believer say amen amen you can have your seats tonight and I want to speak on this subject what is the car us and who are the Eagles and I want to also read out of First Kings in the 17th chapter and we're going to read out of the eth verse and just you don't have to turn there but I'll read it the Bible says and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise and get thee to zerath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there for behold I have commanded a widow woman here to sustain thee amen we'll just ask the Lord to add his Blessing to the word that is read tonight but I want to speak on this what is the carcass and who are The Eagles I know that uh we read this scripture out of out of First Kings and you see that the Lord uh has put a calling upon Elijah's life and how many's familiar with the story of when he called Elijah out of uh or into zerath and here he had put a an instruction on how many's familiar with the story there couldn't be more than there's got to be more than one person y'all say Amen my my vision ain't great amen it's hard to see Hands I do better with the word so uh plus I know what the prophet said he said the Holy Ghost backs the word of God with with the amen God bless you amen but we uh but the but the the Bible says I commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee and the Lord has called him when he called Elijah out of this place of where he was and here he was calling him uh into into this place we realize that this word uh starts it starts as as the word is coming to Elijah and Elijah is at the brook cherith and he is waiting he is there and he is being uh taken care of by God and he had he had been there as a refuge of from a drought or or from a famine and uh you remember the story as Elijah had prophesied un Ahab that he said there would come no DW or there will come no rain in the land and and and when when Elijah had given this word to Ahab and given this uh uh this judgment from God upon the land and uh that there would be no there would be no place a sustaining place but uh but when God brought this and he brought this curse or this famine or what you would call it upon the land but whenever it came to Elijah the Bible says but God had ordered him to a place that he would be sustained and so uh even in the midst of the famine that he would call and even the there would be no DW there'd be no rain but uh God had called him to This Little Brook that was over near the river of Jordan and and the Lord had told him he said I've commanded Ravens to feed you uh and here so and I've commanded uh and and this Brook will be a place to sustain you and so uh when Elijah was sitting by the Brook he was doing he was in the will of God it was a place that God had called him to and so here we find out that the Bible tell us that Elijah being a man of God he had gone to the brook he had obeyed the word of the Lord he was he was fulfilling what God had told him to do and he was satisfied from the water and the Ravens came and the Ravens fed him and and and I I don't know how long he was there the Bible don't really tell us how long he said I know the famine had gone on for three and a half or four years that had happened in that time so so somewhere in the middle of this famine or or this drought that had Came Upon Israel uh the the brook had finally came to a place that it was dried up and I thought you know I wonder what had gone through Elijah's mind when he was sitting there after the word of the Lord had came to him and told him you go to the brook and and the Ravens are going to feed you and here Elijah was sitting and brother marah as many day after day he'd get up and he would drink water out of the brook and a raven would come by and a raven would feed him and the next day he'd get up he'd drink water out of the brook and the Raven would come by and the Ravens would would bring him food and and day after day it had gone on but one morning when Elijah woke up he looked down and the brook no longer had water in it I thought I wonder what went through this man of God's mind as he was sitting here and and Brother David he thought well this is where God had sent me and this is I know I was following the word of the Lord and but as he came by the Brook but one morning he gets in the Brooks no longer producing water there's no water coming down the stream and I thought isn't it something that the brook dried up there wasn't going to be no more Ravens that would bring any food to feed him but what he did have is whenever the water stopped and there was there may not have been no raven come by but he got another word from the Lord see and the Lord said now go down to zerath for I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain you I thought you know it doesn't matter what what what what the old word was or what the previous instruction that God had given to Elijah what Elijah could have looked at that and said but you know what I have a word from the Lord that he gave me a few years ago and he told me to come right here to this place and I would be sustained and and Elijah could have took that and he could have he could have said well I'm not going to follow this new word of the Lord I'm just going to take the old word that God had spoke to me I'm just going to I'm just going to live by that and he could have fought and brother Mark he could have tried to dig a well but there had never been any water and he he could have he could have tried to train Ravens but they never went out and found food because the word of the Lord had called him to this other place and so as God be to call him and I and you you know how Elijah here he was a man that was followed he would follow the word of God and brother Joe he went down and the Bible said as he went down into the place brother said Elijah being a prophet of God and maybe the Lord had said it like this go down into the City and keep walking until you find a woman that had to sticks in her hand and she's going to be there to feed you he said see because when he went down he was he was looking for what God had showed him he said that's what God does God does things that are real so he wasn't looking for some sign or something in the sky but God him being a prophet of God and and having a vision no doubt from God as he went down into this place and and he we go down he would see he he would say God sent him down there and as he went down to the place he said I'm going to send you there and there's a woman that's going to feed you and she may not have nothing in her house but she's going to be able to feed you and and the Bible says as he went down and and you know how the story goes I love how brother Bram dramatizes he said he went down and as he walking along finally he comes across this lady that has these two sticks in her hand and he he seen the woman packing the sticks and said well that must be her and so he he calls out to catch her attention and he says woman would you fetch me a little water and you know the story the Bible says she said well well well well I I'll certainly go to do it and as she turned to do it he then he also says to her but also bring me a little more of bread in your hand and and and brother B said you know notice Elijah having seen a vision knowing the condition that she already had he said but as she as she begin to go she said as the Lord liveth he she was being a Believer she said as the Lord liveth I've only got a handful of meal and just a spoonful of oil and I've already prepared and I've dressed it and I've got it ready and I'm going to take these two sticks and make a little cake and a fire and and and make a cake for my me and my son and we're going to eat it and at the end of that meal we're not going have nothing else to eat at the end of that meal we're just going to be out in the wilderness and we're going to die and that that's all that we have left and brother man said but notice in this part of this story here comes a great lesson he said Elijah said unto her well go bake me a cake first see and then notice he said what is it it's a lesson that we learn and that lesson is seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness so Elijah calls to her he said you go bake me one first and you you know I could just see that little a woman brother Travis as she proceeded to do what what Elijah had ordered her to do as she turned around and she began to make preparation I I don't believe that she had that she argued with him about it I believe in her heart that she had already prepared to do that very thing he said you go bake me a cake first and something in her said I'll go do just that I don't know how I'm going to survive I don't know how we're going to make it but there's something about this man that God had sent to my house I I don't know where this guy came from he comes stomping out of the Wilderness but there was there was some kind of anointing around Elijah's life that caused her whenever he told her to go bake her a cake that that that it caused her to be obedient to the call of God and and so she when she turns around and she and she makes an effort to do it and she goes to proceed to do it and maybe she's wondering in her house in her heart who is this and what's going on and all of a sudden the prophet of God says she heard that comforting word that always Comforts us for thus sayeth the Lord the barrel will not be empty nor the cruise run dry my isn't it a comforting word to hear for the Bride of Jesus Christ thus sayeth the Lord you know brother Morgan when you hear those words thus sayeth the Lord you no longer have to worry when you hear thus sayeth the Lord you don't have to wonder or wonder where it came from or what the outcome is going to be but she heard that comforting word thus sayeth the Lord the barrel will not be empty nor the cruise run dry until the day that God sends rain upon the Earth and you know what the Bible tells us how many knows the end of the story you know what she done she made him a cake she came out and fed him and then the Bible says that until the famine left the land her her meal Barrel never ran dry her oil her Cruise of oil it never ran dry the neighbors around they ran out of oil they ran out of meal but that little woman's cupboard it was never empty every morning when she went in she could make how many cakes she desired how many her heart's desire Brother David she could eat breakfast she could eat lunch she could eat dinner she could feed her son and it never run out until the end of the famine in the land let me tell you something friends about this story as long as the prophet of God was at the brook The Raven had food to eat also this is something I saw in this today I thought it was so wonderful and as long as the prophet of God was at the Widow's house I'm not sure what happened to the Ravens after the prophet left the brook but I know one thing when he entered into the Widow's house she had food to eat too let me tell you friends the same thing that the prophet was feeding on the widow woman ate the same thing he fed on her son ate the same manner he was eating on was the same manner that satisfied her I know sometimes it don't look like it's going to work out sometimes it looks like because of circumstance we're at the end of the road but brother man said what was it he said in that very dark and crucial moment there come he said but God is always on the scene in your dark and crucial moments God is on the scene how many say amen he said if you're sure that it's God and you've repented your sins and if you met God's requirement then you can can be sure that God will keep his promise if men and women could only realize that that God is obligated to keep his promise if youve met his requirements and you've confessed your sins and you've made your wrongs right and you've done everything God has required you to do then you hold on to God and you've got to see daylight he's got to bring it through you just hold on to God in that dark crucial hour you don't worry in the middle of that Darkness Daylight's going to come in the middle of coldness brother Mah there's a fire that's going to burn in the middle of a famine there's food there to eat oh all through the Bible I can find places where God intervenes can you let me preach just a minute all through the scripture I find places where God intervenes we see that that sometimes we get to a place where we feel like we're forsaken sometimes you feel you you get discouraged and your and your faith gets depleted and you don't and you feel you just completely given up but God constantly reminds us in the scripture that that that there's never that he'll that to never let your place discourage you never let where you are discourage you as being a Believer I know sometimes it's so easy to look around us and friends I'm not going to ask you to look around but sometimes whenever you look around it's very discouraging to see the the the place that you're in and the the things that are going on around you and the and the things that are happening in your house but here God reminds us never let your place be a discouragement to you he tells us that some things are just out of your control but let me tell you friends it doesn't matter what what your situation is when it may be out of your control but it's never out of God's control it doesn't matter what your situation is the Bible tells us that you can always find a place where God has intervene here's what happened with this woman brother brother uh Xavier when this woman was starving and she was about she was about on her last meal that God sent Elijah to her house to make sure meal bear was full when the three three Hebrew children were thrown in a fiery furnace brother Jared God came down in the furnace where they were don't ever let your place cause discouragement to come to your life the situation you're in it don't Define you it a it ain't your end result it it ain't the the place where you're just going to have to live the rest of your life and deal with it and cope with it but in every situation God has sent somebody to intervene oh friends you go through the Bible you find there was a lame man at the pool of Bethesda that couldn't get his way to his healing but just because he couldn't get there don't mean that God couldn't find him and Jesus walked right up to where he was he said why don't you receive your healing he said every time I try to some man gets in away he said but your healing is here everywhere don't let your place be a discouragement to you at the gate beautiful there was a man that Peter and John went by and they healed him in his place at a at Gaza there was an Ethiopian unic that was that was looking for answers and and God came by and gave him an answer there was a woman in Samaria that was in a mixed up marriage and Jesus came by and he met her at a well friends it don't matter what the place it don't matter how big or how little it is Peter was just having a bad day at work he wasn't catching any fish but Jesus came out he said throw your net on the other side it don't matter if it's a big problem if it's a a small problem a big thing or a little thing but your circumstances don't control you hello somebody and let me tell you this they certainly don't control God either so if it's good God's in control in the bad time God's in control when you're up God's in control when you're down God's in control when you're on a mountain God's in control when you're in a valley God's in control when whether you're rich God's in control whether you're poor God's in control I think we ought to have what Paul said he said he said now that I speak in respect of of want for I have learned he said whatsoever stay I in therewith to be content in other words he said I know I know how to be abased and I know how to abound this is Apostle Paul he said everywhere in all things I'm instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need but I can do all things can I read that out of an amplified Bible you know I love to do it he said I have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances I've learned to be content in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of facing life whether I'm wellfed or even whether I'm hungry whether having an abundance or whether being in need I can do all things that God has called me to do through Christ who gives me strength friends let me tell you we're not fair weather Christians we don't just serve God on on sunny days but we've been built on a firm foundation we're a body of Believers that has built been built on a foundation of Faith you know what brother Mark you know what that means that regardless of the circumstances we just press on regardless of the situation we press on regardless the Bible said though a thousand far 10,000 at my right hand still yet I'm going to serve the Lord I I'm going to keep pressing the battle why because because God called me and I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength Paul said I have learned in other words I have been taught by circumstance to wait on God and wait on his word now let me tell you this friends I I know sometimes the people don't want you to wait you know sometimes people get impatient they you know and I talk to people all the time about situations and everybody that that that most of the time they'll you know they tell you the problem then tell you how to fix it but you know you know sometimes you just got to wait on the Lord sometimes is you know it seems like to be the theme the last few Services every brother that comes up and preaches says something about it you know some times you just have to wait on God and you you have to let let let let God Work how God works and you know we we think we ought to do it now and fix it right now and and you know you know brother Matt if you'll go tell them that'll well you'll straighten it right out but friends you realize that ain't just the way it works let me tell I'm going to give you a free poem I just made it up if the pastor's in a hurry then the church better worry you wait on the Lord why aren't we waiting on God because we don't want to get in trouble we wait upon the Lord we so so when the circumstan it's bad the Bible would tell us brother Mark we wait on God we wait on the Lord here's what Isaiah said he said they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint you said well brother man how do you wait on the lord well let me tell you you wait on the word let me tell you the word to waiting on the Lord is waiting on a word from the lord it's it's a waiting on the on on a word leading or a word direction you remember a few weeks ago I preached a message on the three kings and how that they had gone out the king of Edom and of Judah and of Israel and how how they had gone out and they took the compass and the compass LED them to their death here they they had no uh water for their cattle or their army but remember when they got in this place one of the men said but is there not here a prophet of the Lord that we may inquire of the Lord by him and one of the one of the servants said well there's a man by the name of Elisha he he's a prophet of God he poured water over the hands of Elijah and but you notice there was a reason there was a reason why that they would hear Elisha you said well what was it that would cause him to want to hear what Elisha said well here he what Jehoshaphat said about him he said because the word of the Lord is with him so why would they listen to Elisha it was because they were waiting on a word from the Lord the word of the Lord is with them and when they realized they were in trouble they said let's inquire of God in other words we need a word from the Lord on this so the call for a prophet I know some people look at it as a strange thing here these men were calling upon a prophet today if you told people well let's see what a prophet said about it they look at you like you have two heads cuz well why would you call upon a prophet but it wasn't that they were just looking for a prophet but they called upon a prophet because they were really looking for a word from God so the call upon a prophet of God is really to uh call upon the word of God we're looking for a word from the Lord is there somebody here that can give us a word leading is there somebody here that can give us a leading of the word of the Lord so so you could say it like this that waiting on the Lord Brother The Mark is waiting for a leading of the word of God so to wait upon the Lord is waiting for the word to lead you it's waiting for the word to guide you it's waiting for something to be said that pertained to that matter and matter of fact brother Mar said like this he said any man that's a Christian he will be led by the word of God he won't be led by men he won't be led uh by by all these things and but he'll be led by the word of God and listen Isaiah said and they that wait upon the Lord they'll Mount up with wings as Eagles I thought what a powerful type that Isaiah used they'll Mount up with wings as Eagles you realize that the Bible would tell us there's there the Bible actually types many different groups of people as Birds I don't have time I can see on a Wednesday night to go through all this but I can I can get the the basis of it but in the Bible we find clean birds and unclean Birds there's many different families of birds there's bird types and the Bible would talk about quail and how how it was good for food and then you know we find the you know the different families that all the birds are in there's water foul there's short which Morgan loves they well they sure love to go after the water foul and when it's in season and then and then there's short birds and and then and then there there there's the dove family which was a type of the Holy Ghost in the scripture and you you'll find out it ain't only in the Bible but brother Mark but even in society we find that that that birds are used to type classes of people or different people and and you know I I got to think about that it's kind of humorous but you know we we call some people nightowl you know that's actually a family of bird and so that well that group well well that's just an night out what it means is I'm going to get myself in trouble but but it's those kind of people that they don't like the light so they just stay around in the darkness and they they don't want nothing to do with the light they just want fellowship with all the darkness and all the all the rest of things that move around in the middle of the night and so so it's just a family of birds and you know there's other birds there there's one called the cuckoo bird I don't think I need to explain it but I met some of them there there's a family called the loons We call we we made up a word about people going to the Looney Bin it was after a family of bir it it was the loons and you know there then then there's the parrot family Oh Glory oh boy there's the parrot family this is all you get out of them it don't they they hear gossip and it comes in one ear and right out the mouth it ain't it ain't in one ear and out the other it's in the ear and out the mouth they can't even get off the phone before they're texting somebody else and telling them what they heard it's the parrot family they're just Birds there's all kinds of birds there's Fish Eaters there's seed eaters there's birds of prey there's meat eaters but I'm Morgan but then there's an eagle e then there was an eagle see this Eagle is a bird that comes in its own class but jar there ain't no other bird the characteristic of an eagle is so Superior to that of any other bird brother Aon you think about a an eagle the to describe an eagle an eagle is a strong bird even the scientists whenever they would when they would describe the the character of an eagle they would say that an eagle is a Fearless bird in other word he is so he is so set on his resolve that that you couldn't scare them off they if a if an eagle would fly off it's not even out of fear it's it's to it's to get to a better position to be able to fulfill what his will is anyway there there's just something about an eagle he's a Fearless bird here's a bird that that is focused it's a bird that that has Vision above any other bird brother Bobby an eagle they they say an eagle can see a rabbit from three miles away he can spot a rabbit hopping in a field three miles up in the heavens and find his prey he's got greater Vision than any bird an eagle he he's got this a great wingspan and you know there there's birds that's bigger than an eagle but the problem is they just got funny legs and little short wings and they they they run real fast but they can't fly but an eagle he's got it all but a Morgan he he's the highest flyer he's got a the greatest wingspan he he and there's something about an eagle that whenever a storm comes and and all the other birds when a storm comes they'll find refuge and they'll burrow up in little thickets and they'll find something that they can they can find go to the ground do you ever notice in a great storm that bird ain't hanging out there in the top of a tree but they go into the thickest they they they become they become Earthbound Birds because they're trying to find protection from a storm but an eagle does exactly the opposite when the storm and the winds begin to blow the eagle will set his wings and allow the winds from the storm to push him to a higher height until he can rise above the very storm that's taking every bird to the ground there's a there's a characteristic about an eagle he's different than any other bird and I thought isn't it something that the Bible he would say you would rise up on the wings as an eagle so we find out in the Book of Revelation as it speaks of the world system today and you you see that there's so many different types of birds that was used you'll find that that that here as it talks about the church world and the things that people go God this I'm I'm gonna get too deep before I start but but but they but how that that that old Babylon church or that old Harlot church we find in the Book of Revelation that they would allow anything to worship this is the world that we live in today there's all kinds of things that's being fed there's all kinds of of places to go feed there's all kinds of birds that's going to all kinds of buildings and they're looking for all kinds of food something that'll satisfy their their taste but you realize but every bird has a different taste for different things and the Bible would tell us in the end time there would be these great churches and that that on nicet and spirit would rise up as the mother of all of them and the priest would would conquer the people of God and they would put a spirit of Oppression on them it's no wonder that a holy ghost filed preacher can't stand to see a people oppressed it's no wonder that a holy ghost filed preacher can't stand to see people tied down and not able to worship God and not able to lift their hands and not able to praise God and say Amen because the oppression didn't come from God it come from the devil and here this Spirit or this Old nickan Demon would come and to oppress the people of God in other words it would it would conquer the leoty and they they they build all kinds of there's all kinds of sanctuaries for birds to feed on but Brother David you know but there's some that they don't they don't believe in sanctification there's some they don't believe in Holiness there's some they preach for fame and they preach for money there's all kinds of sanctuary and there's all kinds of birds but listen what the Bible said in the end time in Revelations the 18th chapter John said after these things I saw another Angel come from Heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the greatest Fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people be you not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues you realize this word partake when you look the word partake up the primary definition of the word partake it means to eat or to drink so here the Bible tells us be not partakers in other words don't eat what they're eating don't drink what they're drinking but Mar because if you'll eat if you'll partake of it then you'll receive of her plagues I thought my ain't it something there's many birds that are feeding on many things but then there's the eagle this Eagle for the David is not searching for some old dead food but the eagle is a type of bird that eats on Fresh kill brother Morgan it's looking for fresh Mana it's not looking for something that that's been handed down through 14 generations of of some denominational father that created some system and now here we are just following what they what they all vote on but it's looking but but he's looking for fresh Mana see some some birds they they'll eat on a on that old denominational table and they're I know this some people this ain't popular preaching in the world today but but you realize that they're feeding on a church rather than the word of God but but when you re when you feed on the church here what the Bible says is that you'll receive the plague that comes with what you're feeding on but let me tell you something I've got good news for you tonight that the eagle is not feeding on some denominational thing but the eagle is feeding on the on the Mana from almighty God let me tell you that system is not a feeding ground for the Eagles so after a little oh I know let me tell you something about them Eagles after a little while something has to happen to cause that eagle to go to somewhere else to feed and the question answers 1964 brother b gets this question where the the Matthew 24:28 it says wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together and the person writes the question who is the carcass and who were the Eagles but said well that's a good question he said there's nothing wrong with that he said what is the carcass the carcass is what the Eagles feed on and the eagle think of it the eagle is considered in the Bible to be a prophet so think of the Prophet as an eagle you see he said see what is the carcass that they feed on the carcass is the word so you see the prophet would feed upon the word of God is there something here he says see God calls himself an eagle then if God's an eagle what are we we're eaglets we're the Believers see so wherever the word is the true nature of the bird will show it self say see an eagle which wants fresh meat he must have his fresh meat he's not a buzzard he's an eagle you can't give no denominational stuff to him he's got to have Eagle food that's the freshest of the meat it ain't what Moses done it ain't something for Martin Luther's message it ain't something from a Catholic Church it ain't something from a Baptist somewhere it ain't something that was Ted by John Smith or John Wesley or Calvin or Knox or or or any of these Great Men of God said but what the eagle has to have is God's word for right now it's what God does today that's what she's looking for the eagle is going to feed on Fresh Meat she's looking for fresh Mana she's looking on on the fresh kill of the word of God he said that's the part he said right now the meat that's killed for this day that's the part of Christ that died to make this word be confirmed that's what they eat on the part of Christ that died to make his word confirmed let me tell you that same carcass that God would send to feed the prophet is the same carcass that the Believers are feeding on today can you turn this down up here he says see and I notice the same carcass that the prophet fed on is the same carcass that the Believers fed on I thought my isn't it something The Raven fed it was it was a raven that was feeding an eagle you ever thought it was a raven that was feeding an eagle give it give a little more back but but you realize that until God called him down to minister to that Gentile woman I thought what a beautiful type that this was that here the brook had dried up and it went to a it went to a g woman and she heard she heard these words thus sayeth the Lord and and brother Jared whenever she heard that she obeyed the voice of Elijah and then her obedience it gave Elijah life so here a woman as she was sitting in this place and I thought man this is such a beautiful time here here that it all that it all dried up and after it had dried up and it had brought her to this place then then here she comes and this Gentile woman and she hears Elijah and he gives her thus sayith the Lord she obeys his voice and you realize what gave him life was her obedience to his voice and as she heard it and as as as life was was given into him his word that he spoke caused her family to be fed and it caused her family to live I thought my isn't it something there was a spirit in her that gave life to the word of God there was a spirit in her that gave life to the voice of Elijah he came out he said thus sayith the Lord and the spirit in her is what gave it life in order that she could be fed but says see C- denominations they can never bring life to the word of God because it brings life it'll never bring life out of their denomination he said but the Holy Spirit does it gives life to the word see there was something in her that give life to God's word there was something in her that caused that caused it to live there was something in her you realize that Elijah couldn't sustain her if that thing that was inside of her couldn't have caused her to be obedient to the word but something in her gave life to to the word Oh I thought my isn't it something that before Elijah she was in a famine before Elijah came she was in a drought brother Jared but when she received thus sayeth the Lord she came out of the famine and she came out of the drought when she received thus sayeth the Lord it gave life to the word and the word that she gave life to sustained her to the end of the famine oh my I think it's something to think of it today that that's the call that God has given us in this hour he said come out of her by people you're not a part of the unclean bird you're not a hateful bird but it's an a call for the eagle to come out of her let me tell you friends the eagle ain't sitting around feeding on some Rogue kill anymore well you know sometime go I I used to get I I used to be discouraged I remember when I was a young man and you know we got to talk about them Eagles all the time and how they fed on Fresh mana and some little smart OT come to the church one time and said well I'll tell you what I've seen an eagle I seen an eagle sitting on the side of the road and he was eating road kill just with all them vultures and everything else and as a young man that bothered me cuz you know I got to look at it up and sometimes Eagles do get on the side of the road and they do eat with all the vultures and they do eat Rogue kill and they do eat things that they shouldn't eat but then I thought you know as I read this scripture well why would God ever call them out if they never were in something it don't mean that the eagle never was there but a mark there was an eagle that was in a system with a Cage Bird there was an eagle that was locked up somewhere with an unclean bird sometimes Eagles they're down there eating BR kill and sometimes they're eating things that they ought not be eating sometimes Eagles are found down in a barnyard but I thank God that the eagle can hear the call of God In This Hour come out of her my people and be not a partaker of her sins there's many that are malnourished but about because they they ain't feeding on the right thing people get too much of things mixed in their diet there's some you know even there's some good Eagles sometimes that their diets messed up they they they get on a all Facebook diet you ever he you ever get get caught up on that one they get on an all Hollywood Diet or a a CNN diet or a Fox News diet but let me tell you friends if that's all you're feeding on you will be miserable why you why will you be miserable because you're an eagle an eagle can sit around and eat Rog kill but after a little while it'll bother his stomach something something ain't right it won't take long and something in that eagle says I can't eat this nonsense any longer I got to go find some fresh meat and you know what he'll do he'll go back in the heavens and he'll search for some fresh kill why because he's an eagle see that's the call of God in this Age come out of her my people you realize that God has called you to a higher Dwelling Place sometimes you get you remember the the story but I'm told about how that that old Eagle sometimes it'll get crusted over and his eyes it go through that molten phase of its life you know and and and it it'll get so moled over that that it can't see no more it can't find food and and it'll it'll be sitting there until it until it's about to it's about to die but the other eagles around what they'll do is but Jared they'll go out and find food and they'll kill food for it and they'll come over there and they'll drop it at his feet I thought my isn't that something what God could teach us through nature that sometimes they get moled over and sometimes they're tore up in their spirit and sometimes they got that old get back or bite back spirit and people they get so worked up but you know what the good Eagles do the good eagles they just go out and they find some fresh mana and they come out and they lay it at their brother's feet they they don't take the opportunity and say well he's down I'll tell you what I'm going to go by and Claw him he'll never know who clawed him I'm going to go by I'm going to beak him a little bit he'll never know who beak him but that ain't what they do they go and they find food and they lay it at his feet so that he can be sustained in that mol stage and they'll nurse him and and give him a little food and they'll eat it up I I thought my if you could see the Eagles today as they would tear apart the meat and lay it at his feet and little B so he could feed on it and draw strength from it until one day he has just enough strength that he could fly again and he'll go back over to the Rock and he'll be he'll use the strength that has been built up by those other eagles and he'll go to beating on that rock until all that M stuff falls off of his face and he can see again replenished encouraged back to his place of being an eagle see sometimes sometimes we got to be we got to hear the call of the eagle the call is to a higher calling we're Eagles we're not we're not canaries we're Eagles we're not parrots we got to hear the call of the eagle come to a greater diet it's the call of the eagle come back to the true word of God it's the call of the eagle get back to the true revelation of the Holy Ghost let me tell you friends Satan Satan wants to keep the word of God away from you he wants to keep it out of out of your heart and out of your life and out of your mouth but let me tell you this word is food for the Eagles it belongs in your mouth Satan will do everything he can to stop it to stop the word from growing in you but let me tell you something there's not one devil that can keep the words from growing in the heart of a Believer some Believers say amen I said there there's not a devil that can keep the word of God out of the heart from growing in the heart of the believer cuz this word is equipped to overcome every devil brother bam said one time he was sitting there praying as he as he would open the scripture he said Lord as we open your word this morning we find a consolation in these Stepping Stones to bring us closer to you he said Lord I pray that the holy spirit will open this word to us that we as thy servants will be better equipped man see it takes a word to be better equipped it takes a word to be fulfilled it takes a word to have strength no wonder the no wonder Satan's doing all that he can to keep the word out of the mouth of the Eagles because he knows it's what gives you strength but brother dve what happens is if you can ever get an eagle to a place where there's some fresh kill they'll get to a place where the word is being opened up to them and the word is being revealed it it may be in in small pieces at first but what it does is it equips us it Ain it ain't just a dead letter this old this old Bible it comes to life and and it's not it's not just some Idle Word or letters on a page it's a revealed word and as it's revealed to the believer then the word begins to drop in their heart and it becomes a revelation and then that Revelation it speaks and when the Revelation speaks mountains start to move brother Tom when it speaks Devils start to flee when it speaks demons they start to tremble when it speaks hell gets out of the way atmospheres change Supernatural things begin to happen said see God has equipped the church with a revealed word of God God at the beginning he gave his children something the very thing that they needed to get through every age but said he gave him an atomic weapon he said why would he give you that cuz he was an eternal God say see he knew there was going to be conflict he knew there's going to be a battle but he equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition the right kind of attack the right kind of everything they had need of that would sweep all the way from Eden all the way to a Rapture glory to God that includes me he gave us what we needed that would work all the way from the Garden of Eden until the time of the Rapture that puts me right in the middle of it that means God gave you a word as an eagle a revealed word that you could feed on that would sustain you in the middle of a famine it's it it's the carcass of the word of God he said what is it it's the word the word that's what defeats Satan it's the word it'll defeat him anywhere any place he said it won't we don't want a substitute of something else why would we take a substitute when we've already got the best thing there is the word of God that fresh word of God Brother David anointed by God is the carcass that the Eagles feed on why don't we need anything else let me tell you friends I don't need drugs to get high I'm an eagle I'm an eagle I don't need the wealth of the world to be happy I'm an eagle it's my satisfying portion the word that we feed on is a satisfying portion of God see listen she saved she saved the prophet and the prophet saved her isn't it something she fed her spirit brother Jared it fed the word it gave life to the word and it sustained her butram said see and then notice what happened when the prophet was saved so was the widow woman butam said see and the God is rich in Mercy he said God saved Moses and the eagle Believers in the time of Moses he said because they had respect to his word and today friend the only way that we can ever have favor with God God is rich in Mercy but we've got to respect what he said about it you just can't take what somebody else said you've got to take what God said he said let every man's word be a lie and let my word be true and today we are told that all you have to do is many places is to join a church or have a Creed or something like that or say a prayer put your name on a book be sprinkled or baptized some certain way or something like that that's all you have to do but that's wrong to be an eagle of God you've got to follow the word day by day hello somebody to be an eagle of God you've got to follow the word day by day he said you've got to continue to feed upon the word of God do you realize friends that this message that we're feeding on is the foundation to every promise of God that lays in this Bible brother Jared it's the foundation to having a happy home it's the foundation of healing it's it's the place to find Salvation it's the place to to see the supernatural it's the it's it's a place to find Refuge it's the place to see Miracles take place but in order for you to see it you have to accept it to be the word of God over your life before you can receive the benefit of it you see most people look at the at this word and brother Dave they want the benefit of it but they wouldn't accept it as to be the word I thought you know it's just something about God's word you know a couple years maybe I guess it was last year me and my wife we were we were thinking about you know everybody was going out and building those those Gardens and some of our family had nice Gardens well we had a little bit of extra space up there by the house and so I thought well you know we can we can make a garden and we we'll just be able to to feed ourselves and that would wouldn't that be nice you get a little bit of reward for your labor and you know so I like I like fried okra so we we got us a plan we're going to have some good okra at home we we'll we'll get the so all that right so we set out our plan to grow some fried ochre but Jared I went down I got I done what I was supposed to do I picked out I went asked the people what's the best kind of ochre that you can buy they told me the best kind and so I got it and we got home and you know and and we we done every everything that that that that we done up to that place and but you know here we are I guess we're about a year and a half later and I don't know if it's Sarah's Green Thumb or or what it is but we never ate one piece of okra off of an ochra plant we had one okra that's ever grown there ain't been the there ain't been a little okra stem move his little okra head above a okra Bloom if they have Bloom brother Joe we have got no fruit from our okra patch not a single fruit but see there's a problem on our farm I don't know if it's just our farm but I I think it might be on other Farms as well but but I can show you the reason why that we never ate okra brother Tim because the okra that we bought is in this package this is what I bought at Home Depot and the problem is is I never took it out of the pack I bought the okra I took it home I put it on a shelf here we are almost two years later I've never ate the fruit of it it's never manifested I've never enjoyed it it's never done one thing for me it's not satisfying for me because it's still in the same package that I bought it in and I think that's what happens to a lot of people is here you see you have to accept the word of God over your life before you can receive the benefit of it you have to take this word and it has to be planted somewhere it can't just be something that's sitting on a shelf it can't just be something that you read but said see see first what happened it had to be planted and then it had to be watered and once it was planted and once it was watered then you'd be able to receive the fruit of the seed that you received and brother said what he said what did Elijah tell the woman that went to do it it was nothing with that nothing but a handful of meal he told her he said you make me a cake first first and then you start he said see the miracle will happen after you take God's word first then you begin to believe God's word and then the miracle will take place on the word see there has to be a foundation you want to see the benefit from the word of God but there has to be a foundation upon God's word and that Foundation is the word has to be placed he said see then the miracle will take place on the word because the word is a seed that brings forth the miracle so you got to take the word first and the Holy Spirit will then come and it'll give it life like water falling from Heaven oh friends let me tell you there's many that's looking for a miracle or a promise from God but you first have to take the seed of the word of God you have to plant it in your life you have to let the water of the Holy Ghost to be water upon it and then the promise will be made manifest see that's the problem today is there's many seeds that just haven't been watered there's many words brother brother Dave there's many words all all kinds of things that are growing there's many there's many there's many other seeds that that have been watered they grow up in all kinds of people's lives many types of religions churches and all kinds of things that grow but you realize that just because it's something that's growing don't mean it's something that's true there's all kinds of seed Jesus said the rain will fall on the just and on the unjust friends let me tell you a secret tonight I'm going to close but every proclaimed Christian is believing some message hello every proclaimed Christian is believing some message that's by somebody but you notice in Matthew the 24th chapter this was the answer to how will we know it's the end time the Jesus said or how we know the sign of the end of the world Jesus said you will know for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets they'll show great signs and wonders in so much if it were possible they would deceive the very elected said notice they were false prophets plural false Christ plural plural see but the anointed one what is an anointed one false Christ a Christ is an anointed one that means it's one with a message so in other words there are teachers in the world that have came through the world today said see but when they come with this message the only way the message can be brought out is one that is Anointed so if a man is going to bring a message he's anointed by something to bring the message so whatever denomination it is whatever Church it is it's a man that's bringing a message and he's anointed by by something to bring a message but the Bible says but there would be there would be a prophet that was anointed but there shall arise false anointed teachers or anointed prophets anointed Christ said what is it it's anointed teachers that are false teaching a message that is false anointed teachers anointed people with a false teaching they're anointed ones in the end time but friends if there're are false Christ and there and then and there are there there are false and there there's a Christ that's true if there's teachers that are false then there's a teaching that's true don't let don't let that scripture discourage you because the Bible said there are false Christ don't look at everybody that's anointed and say well they must be false cuz there's an anointing upon their life but friends because Jesus said the rain falls on the just and the unjust but not only will they have an anointing but you can take them back to the word of God and you'll find out the true anointing will never differ from God's word why because they're Eagles Prophet Eagles followed by Pro by eagle Believers feeding upon an anointed word of God not following after false Christ or false teachers or or false churches or false anointed ones but an anointed word that would be the bread of life that we could feed on that tonight that we're that we're feeding on not not some idea of a man but the word body of the son of man but said I I wasn't the one that appeared down there on the river see many had put this on a man hello many have put this on a man and they've got so far off a left field he said I wasn't the one that appeared down there on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect that they are I'm only there whenever he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it was just I surrendered myself and he spoke through it wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it wasn't the Manifest it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded and it's not a man but it's God that's the history that God unfolded that it wasn't a man it was God it wasn't the messenger it was God through the messenger he said see he said the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man don't you realize friends it's an anointing at the end time it's the ones that the false anointing would be mimicking those false cries would be mimicking but I thank God that there's some true word Believers I thank God that there's some Eagle Believers that would hear thus sayth the Lord out of the mouth of Elijah and that there would be something in her heart there'd be a spirit in her heart that would give life to the word of God and let me tell you friends if you'll ever Surrender Your Life to it you'll never have to worry about feeding you'll never have to worry about being satisfied you'll never have to worry about any famine that would come upon the land today surrender to the word of God surrender to the word of God said it's the when they when you feed it you give it life it'll satisfy you part two I'll bring next week let the music players come said there's many that are falsely anointed but there's only one that's true anointed said who is it it's the son of man the son of man is Christ and he's the one that you're feeding on let's not get confused is it wasn't the messenger The Messengers was just the one that the son of man used he was just the voice that the son of man used to speak to our heart you realize it wasn't Elijah Elijah had no ability to fill that woman's meal Barrel he had Elijah what what give Elijah the ability to say that your meal bear will never run dry he was a man just like anybody else but the word of the Lord spoke through the mouth of Elijah and when that woman went back to be obedient something I just see Elijah I don't know that he even thought about it brother David as she went to turn to go back and something on the inside of him just came out and said thus sayeth the Lord your meal Barrel will never run dry M can you imagine thus sayith the Lord your cruise of oil will never fail feed the word that feeds you is it something she gave it she gave it life and it fed her he said well how do I give it life you allowed to be planted you allowed to be watered by the Holy Ghost you give it life you let it grow and it'll sustain you in the time of famine you want to stand to your feet [Music]
