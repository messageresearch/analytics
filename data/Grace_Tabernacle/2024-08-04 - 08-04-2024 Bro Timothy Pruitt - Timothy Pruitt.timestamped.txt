[56:29] day that he went into a ship with his
[56:32] disciples and he said unto them let us
[56:34] go over unto the other side of the lake
[56:37] and they launch launched forth and as
[56:39] they sailed he fell asleep and there
[56:41] came down a strong or a storm of wind on
[56:44] the lake and they were filled with water
[56:47] and were in Jeopardy and they came to
[56:49] him and awoke him and said master master
[56:51] we perish and he arose and rebuked the
[56:54] wind and the Raging of the water and
[56:56] they ceased and there was a calm and he
[56:59] said unto them where is your faith and
[57:02] they being afraid wondered saying one to
[57:04] another what manner of man is this for
[57:07] he commandeth even the winds and the
[57:09] water and they obey him amen we'll let
[57:12] you be seated today amen also thankful

[57:33] burges is here too brother amen I'm just
[57:36] so thankful to have everyone and a lot
[57:38] of you I don't know I've met maybe
[57:40] didn't see your faces and and I remember
[57:43] a lot of faces I have a lot of trouble
[57:45] remember names you know I'm getting up
[57:47] in age we're at the point that we don't
[57:48] even have kids that go with us anymore
[57:51] uh you know uh you used to travel with
[57:53] all your children and things and now
[57:55] they're married and
[57:56] amen we got a we got a grandchild coming
[57:58] on the way so that's a new phase of life
[58:00] that we're looking forward to and and uh
[58:03] but you know we're we none of us would
[58:05] have ever expected to still be here uh
[58:08] but I'm thankful to know that it wasn't
[58:10] on my time but it's on God's time
[58:12] because if God would have came many
[58:14] times in the time that we expected him
[58:16] to come amen many of you wouldn't even
[58:18] be here today many of you would have
[58:20] still been in a lost condition or or not
[58:22] even born into this world but God has
[58:25] waited because he has a time and and an
[58:28] hour for his his appearing and we nobody
[58:31] knows the exact moment or the exact time
[58:34] but we do know he is coming amen and we
[58:37] we we are declaring that this morning
[58:39] that there is a Rapture that is going to
[58:41] take place is not a fairy tale it's not
[58:43] a a sand castle that you build and and
[58:46] it's just a bunch of sand nothing to it
[58:48] but it is the realities of God because
[58:50] it's spoken his word and God's word will
[58:53] be performed he will fulfill what he has
[58:55] said
[58:56] this morning I would like to speak to
[58:58] you on Faith's decree uh a decree is an
[59:01] official order issued by a legal
[59:04] Authority and I I got this from uh just
[59:07] I was listening to a tape and heard
[59:08] brother brandham quote this song he said
[59:11] there is a land beyond the river that we
[59:13] call the sweet forever and we only reach
[59:16] that Shore by Faith's decree we only
[59:20] reach that sweet Forever by Faith's
[59:23] decree by the word of God Amen that
[59:26] place that is so impossible this morning
[59:28] to even describe he would go there and
[59:31] have that experience of going Beyond and
[59:33] he said I I can't hardly describe how
[59:35] wonderful it is over there and how how
[59:38] amazing and the love and all that he
[59:40] couldn't even put hardly put it into
[59:41] words you know and we haven't even been
[59:44] there and if we did go we would come
[59:46] back and and it would be hard for us to
[59:48] describe the grander and the beauty that
[59:50] awaits a Believer who goes to that place
[59:53] and you know that's one thing that gives
[59:54] me Comfort you know to as as you think
[59:57] about the experience that brother
[59:58] brandham had when we when we lose our
[1:00:01] loved ones you know we grieve and and we
[1:00:03] mourn and when we suffer great loss but
[1:00:06] you know they're not over there grieving
[1:00:07] for us they're not over there missing us
[1:00:09] they're not over there you know worried
[1:00:11] about us and all of that and he say he
[1:00:13] would actually say is he would look back
[1:00:15] there at his body laying there on on
[1:00:17] that bed and and he would see his hands
[1:00:19] behind his head and he was laying beside
[1:00:21] his wife there were children in the Next
[1:00:23] Room that he loved very much but his
[1:00:26] heart was not upon his wife or his
[1:00:28] children his heart was to stay there he
[1:00:30] didn't want to go back he said do I have
[1:00:32] to go back to that Old Rag again to that
[1:00:34] old body again because it was such a
[1:00:36] wonderful place and and and we know that
[1:00:39] we are looking for that and we're going
[1:00:41] to experience that very soon no doubt
[1:00:43] but we will only see it by living by
[1:00:46] faith speaking by faith speaking face
[1:00:49] decree so what is face decree a decree
[1:00:52] is an official order given by a legal
[1:00:54] Authority it is the decree is the word
[1:00:57] of God the word of God is what faith
[1:00:59] speaks amen amen you may speak a lot of
[1:01:02] things but if you're speaking your
[1:01:03] feelings you're not speaking by faith
[1:01:06] amen you're speaking by feelings but we
[1:01:08] want to speak the word of God and that's
[1:01:11] where faith will find this resting fa
[1:01:13] resting place see Faith always looks to
[1:01:16] the word faith places itself on the
[1:01:19] unmovable Rock God's Eternal Word Faith
[1:01:22] doesn't look at reasons I don't care how
[1:01:23] much you can show maybe something would
[1:01:25] be better but if the word says no faith
[1:01:28] rests right there if the word says yes
[1:01:31] Faith rests right there that is the
[1:01:34] sanctuary of Faith resting place now we
[1:01:36] can rely on hope we can have hope but
[1:01:39] when you have just hope in your heart
[1:01:41] You Hinder Faith Hope looks for
[1:01:43] something way off I hope I'll get there
[1:01:45] I hope I'll be there but Faith looks as
[1:01:48] it as right now cuz Faith is the
[1:01:50] substance of things hoped for amen it it
[1:01:54] Faith claims it right now faith says God
[1:01:56] said so and it's settled it's finished
[1:01:59] it's mine I don't care what the devil
[1:02:01] says or anybody else says amen faith
[1:02:03] says God said it I believe it it's
[1:02:06] finished amen so that settles it you
[1:02:09] know I don't care if I'm still crippled
[1:02:11] if I'm still blind if I'm still sick I
[1:02:14] don't care it has nothing to do with it
[1:02:16] I believe it anyhow it's my possession
[1:02:19] it's mine right now why cuz God said it
[1:02:21] was mine and not it's not mine because I
[1:02:24] feel like it is mine or I think it's
[1:02:26] mine it is mine because God's word said
[1:02:29] it is mine therefore I believe it hope
[1:02:31] says what God said so and I'm expecting
[1:02:34] it to get it someday I I'm expecting
[1:02:37] someday for it to happen but as long as
[1:02:39] Satan can put you into another day as
[1:02:42] long as he can push you off to another
[1:02:44] service or or another to another moment
[1:02:46] just as just as just as good as he wants
[1:02:49] he he just don't want you to realize
[1:02:50] it's yours today it's your moment right
[1:02:53] now you know if you never get it just
[1:02:55] believe that you know you know you know
[1:02:58] Satan's always like the you know putting
[1:02:59] the carrot out in front of the horse
[1:03:01] that he never gets there it's always out
[1:03:03] there in front of you you one day I can
[1:03:05] be a Christian one day I'll be good
[1:03:07] enough one day I I'll be a Son of God
[1:03:09] one no today God is PR declared that's
[1:03:13] who I am I am healed why not because I
[1:03:16] feel I'm Healed I'm Healed because his
[1:03:18] word declares I'm Healed I I'm not saved
[1:03:21] because I feel like I'm saved I'm saved
[1:03:24] because his word declares I'm say Amen
[1:03:27] so this is where you got to put it Faith
[1:03:28] acts now it's positive amen you know
[1:03:32] sickness or everything else when Faith
[1:03:33] steps in he said it's like a snowball on
[1:03:36] a hot stove it melts away everything
[1:03:39] everything goes away from Faith cuz
[1:03:41] Faith stands up and takes over the rule
[1:03:44] When Faith speaks everything else keeps
[1:03:47] still he said that little old sickness
[1:03:49] is Burling around and making big
[1:03:51] challenges and saying well days of
[1:03:53] Miracles are passed or it'll be another
[1:03:55] Serv or or this that and the other
[1:03:57] another day it might happen but let step
[1:03:59] Faith step up one time and pull his
[1:04:02] muscles up and say I'm here to take over
[1:04:04] he said I'm telling you everything else
[1:04:06] will keep still When Faith speaks amen
[1:04:10] that's what we want this morning we
[1:04:11] don't want our feelings to speak we
[1:04:13] don't want our thoughts to speak we
[1:04:15] don't want even a man from Louisiana to
[1:04:17] speak we want the faith of almighty God
[1:04:19] to speak amen faith has a voice a decree
[1:04:23] has no power unless it's de declared and
[1:04:26] it has no power declared unless it has
[1:04:29] something to back it up amen therefore
[1:04:32] I'm thankful I'm not here declaring the
[1:04:34] words of just a seventh grade educated
[1:04:36] Kian or just the words of some man that
[1:04:39] wrote A Few scriptures but I'm here
[1:04:41] declaring the word of almighty God and
[1:04:44] there is something that is here that'll
[1:04:46] back up what he said he said in Matthew
[1:04:48] 17 and verse 20 Jesus said if you have
[1:04:51] faith you shall say to this mountain I
[1:04:54] love how he puts that brother M he don't
[1:04:56] say go get a preacher and speak go let
[1:04:58] him speak for you go let somebody he
[1:05:00] said if you say to this mountain how
[1:05:02] many you's are here to this morning if
[1:05:04] you say to this mountain amen this
[1:05:07] mountain see this mountain must hear
[1:05:09] your
[1:05:10] voice not just a preacher's voice this
[1:05:12] ain't all about a preacher this ain't
[1:05:14] all about a prophet amen it's all about
[1:05:17] God coming in flesh in this hour that
[1:05:19] we're living in and that mountain
[1:05:21] hearing your
[1:05:23] voice so the action the Bible of faith
[1:05:26] is speaking the word of God the decree
[1:05:29] and standing on your statement of faith
[1:05:31] Jesus said if you have faith you will
[1:05:34] speak so there's no such a thing as just
[1:05:37] silently
[1:05:39] believing come on somebody well I I just
[1:05:42] not me well there's no such a thing as
[1:05:44] silently believing what you believe will
[1:05:47] come
[1:05:48] out amen if you don't have enough
[1:05:51] confidence to say it then you really
[1:05:52] don't believe
[1:05:53] it come on somebody body Jesus said he
[1:05:57] said if if you have faith as grain of a
[1:05:59] mustard seed you'll say to the sycamine
[1:06:01] tree be thou plucked up by the root and
[1:06:04] be thou planted in the sea and it should
[1:06:06] obey you if you have faith and don't
[1:06:09] doubt you say to this mountain it shall
[1:06:11] it shall happen so according to Jesus
[1:06:14] for Faith to operate it must be released
[1:06:17] through a spoken
[1:06:19] word hallelujah what you speak is the
[1:06:22] evidence of your faith another way of
[1:06:24] saying it is your speech really reveals
[1:06:27] what you truly
[1:06:29] believe come on somebody amen 2
[1:06:32] Corinthians 4: 13 says but having the
[1:06:34] same Spirit of Faith according to what
[1:06:37] is written I believe therefore I speak
[1:06:40] we also believe therefore we also speak
[1:06:43] so if you believe you will therefore
[1:06:47] speak you know uh Luke chapter 6 and
[1:06:49] verse 45 we'll go through through a few
[1:06:52] uh scriptures here a good man out of the
[1:06:54] good Treasure of his heart bringeth
[1:06:56] forth which is good and the evil man out
[1:06:58] of the evil Treasure's heart bringing
[1:07:00] forth that which is evil for out of the
[1:07:02] abundance of the heart his mouth
[1:07:04] speaketh Amen in Luke or Matthew 12 and:
[1:07:07] 34 he says you old Generation of Vipers
[1:07:10] how can you be an evil speak good things
[1:07:12] for out of the abundance of the heart
[1:07:15] the mouth speaketh a good man out of the
[1:07:17] good Treasure of his heart bringeth
[1:07:19] forth good things an evil man out of the
[1:07:21] evil treasure bring forth evil things
[1:07:24] but I say unto you that that Every Idle
[1:07:26] word that men shall speak shall give
[1:07:29] account thereof in the day of judgment
[1:07:31] and I got to looking at this word this
[1:07:33] what is it mean by Idle Word Idle Word
[1:07:35] is insincere language of a person who
[1:07:38] speaks one thing but means another amen
[1:07:42] do you know that God bless you can be an
[1:07:44] Idle Word if it's inere insincere and
[1:07:47] and you mean you speak one thing but you
[1:07:49] mean another come on somebody or you
[1:07:51] don't really mean it amen this is what
[1:07:52] an idle word for by thy words th shalt
[1:07:55] be justified and by thy words Thou shalt
[1:07:58] be condemned so it's very much there's a
[1:08:01] very much of power that goes with what
[1:08:03] words we speak in our lives amen so out
[1:08:06] of the abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:08:08] is speaking now amen you know I want to
[1:08:11] talk about a man that was named fimon
[1:08:13] that's in the Bible and Paul would speak
[1:08:16] about him in the first chapter and he
[1:08:18] would he would thank God and make
[1:08:20] mention of him in his prayers and he
[1:08:22] said I've heard of your love and I've
[1:08:23] heard of your faith which thou Hast
[1:08:25] toward the lord Jesus then he said that
[1:08:27] that toward and toward all saints that
[1:08:29] the communication of thy faith may be
[1:08:32] effectual by the acknowledging of every
[1:08:35] good thing which is in you in Christ
[1:08:37] Jesus for we have great joy and
[1:08:39] consolation in thy love because the
[1:08:42] bowels of the Saints are refreshed by
[1:08:45] the amen by what the communication of
[1:08:48] his faith by what he spoke amen by what
[1:08:51] he said amen I I want to be a refreshing
[1:08:54] Christian I want to be somebody that
[1:08:56] when they come around they're refreshed
[1:08:59] because I have something good to say and
[1:09:01] it ain't my own thoughts or what I think
[1:09:03] about something it's what God's word
[1:09:05] says about
[1:09:06] it amen see thoughts become words and
[1:09:10] words become actions amen I want to be a
[1:09:13] refreshing Christian amen that somebody
[1:09:15] can come and get a fresh drink of the
[1:09:17] Lord Jesus Christ amen I don't want to
[1:09:20] be so gomed up with everything and hard
[1:09:22] feelings and situations that's happened
[1:09:24] here and there and that's all I'm
[1:09:25] thinking about that's all I'm dwelling
[1:09:27] on that's all I'm looking at but I want
[1:09:29] to be looking at the word of God that if
[1:09:32] there's Church troubles I want to be
[1:09:33] looking at the word of God Amen if
[1:09:35] there's situations I don't know how to
[1:09:37] handle or I don't know what to do or I
[1:09:39] don't know where to turn I want to be
[1:09:40] looking at the word of God Amen so amen
[1:09:45] it's very powerful if you look at how
[1:09:47] much power our tongue has now just go
[1:09:51] into this for a moment Proverbs 18 and
[1:09:53] verse 21 says death and life are in the
[1:09:56] power of the
[1:09:58] tongue yeah buckle up just for a moment
[1:10:01] moment they that love it shall eat the
[1:10:03] fruit thereof what the scripture is
[1:10:05] saying is the words you speak have the
[1:10:09] ability to give life to a person or a
[1:10:12] situation however they also have the
[1:10:15] ability to kill and
[1:10:18] destroy amen the scripture is a simple
[1:10:22] reminder of how much our words matter
[1:10:27] amen so out of your mouth you have the
[1:10:29] ability to build up or tear down you
[1:10:33] have the ability to motivate or
[1:10:36] discourage you have the ability to lift
[1:10:38] people higher or drag them down lower
[1:10:42] out of the out of the abundance of the
[1:10:43] mouth to inspire to Greatness or to push
[1:10:46] them to mediocrity all because of the
[1:10:49] words that are coming out of your mouth
[1:10:51] this is life and death that is in the
[1:10:53] power of the tongue right am amen
[1:10:57] hallelujah amen Matthew again 12 and: 37
[1:11:01] says for by thy words thou shall be
[1:11:03] justified or by thy words Thou shalt be
[1:11:07] condemned so our words are very
[1:11:09] important how we speak is very important
[1:11:11] how we speak to each other is very
[1:11:14] important how we speak man to wife is
[1:11:17] very important husband to wife how we
[1:11:19] speak uh father to daughters and sons
[1:11:22] and mothers is very important amen how
[1:11:25] we speak about our church and our church
[1:11:27] people it's very
[1:11:29] important amen we got to make sure we
[1:11:31] ain't dwelling on negativity cuz I can
[1:11:34] promise you the devil is always there to
[1:11:36] show negativity he is always there to
[1:11:38] tear down and to tear down the preacher
[1:11:41] and tear down the deacons and tear down
[1:11:43] the music and tear down and tear down
[1:11:45] and tear down that's his job I don't
[1:11:47] want to be accomplice to the words of
[1:11:49] the devil but I want to be guilty of
[1:11:51] lifting
[1:11:52] up guilty of building up and saying you
[1:11:56] can make it you will make it amen this
[1:11:59] church will
[1:12:02] stand amen so in Hebrews chapter 4 and
[1:12:06] verse1 14 seeing that we have a great
[1:12:08] high priest that has passed into the
[1:12:10] heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold
[1:12:13] fast our
[1:12:15] profession Hebrews 10:23 says let us
[1:12:18] hold fast the profession of our faith
[1:12:20] without wavering for he is faithful that
[1:12:23] promise and Psalms 19 and verse1 14 it
[1:12:26] says let the words of my mouth and the
[1:12:28] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[1:12:31] thy sight oh Lord my strength My
[1:12:35] Redeemer amen I you know I I've seen

[1:12:51] the road a little while you know and you
[1:12:53] see a lot of things I I've seen men that

[1:12:58] ministry over sitting around a table and
[1:13:00] they they NE they're negative about what
[1:13:02] this done and how you handled this and
[1:13:04] that and they're spewing it out to their
[1:13:06] children and then it tears them down to
[1:13:08] where they don't have confidence in the
[1:13:10] ministry and then their children get in
[1:13:11] trouble and they want the ministry to
[1:13:13] help when they can't help no more
[1:13:15] because there ain't no confidence
[1:13:17] there and it wasn't tore down by anybody
[1:13:20] else but the father the mother sitting
[1:13:23] around disputing out all this negative I
[1:13:26] I don't know why I'm here but this is
[1:13:27] where we at I I just know the devil
[1:13:30] loves to work behind the scenes over
[1:13:32] time trying to destroy the work of God
[1:13:35] and he's always there trying to tear
[1:13:37] this and tear that and pick against this
[1:13:39] and pick against listen we're not here
[1:13:41] for our feelings to be petted we're not
[1:13:43] here to just get a pat on the back and
[1:13:45] say you're doing good we're here to hear
[1:13:47] the word of God and if God wants to come
[1:13:50] and tear us apart and it needs to be
[1:13:52] tore out of our life let it be so
[1:13:56] [Applause]
[1:14:00] Proverbs 6 and verse 2 says Thou Art
[1:14:03] snared with the words of thy mouth and

[1:16:47] back down saying but I'm Healed by the
[1:16:49] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he'd
[1:16:51] go back and he swallow it back down in
[1:16:53] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm
[1:16:55] Healed and he said somebody said I was
[1:16:57] making a mockery out of that he said I
[1:16:58] wasn't making no mockery I wasn't saying
[1:17:01] it because I felt healed or I thought I
[1:17:02] was here he said I was saying it because
[1:17:05] that's what God's word said listen you
[1:17:07] always have the right as a Christian to
[1:17:10] speak God's word but the devil wants to
[1:17:13] make you think well it's just your
[1:17:14] feelings or that's just you that's just
[1:17:17] you saying it no I'm saying what God
[1:17:19] said I'm speaking what God said listen
[1:17:23] if we can ever get to the place that we
[1:17:25] quit speaking our feelings or our fear
[1:17:28] or our unbelief and we only speak what
[1:17:30] his word says then things will take
[1:17:33] place in our
[1:17:35] lives he says see I am strong I have now
[1:17:39] accepted Jesus as my healer never have
[1:17:42] any negative
[1:17:46] testimony just believe it God is under
[1:17:49] obligation he Jesus is sitting at the
[1:17:51] right hand of the father to accept what
[1:17:53] you say he said sitting there as the
[1:17:55] high priest of our confession to make
[1:17:57] good before the father anything that he
[1:17:59] died for that you're confessing that
[1:18:01] he's done now healing is not something
[1:18:03] that you just say well I I believe it I
[1:18:05] believe that's all right if that's the
[1:18:07] best you can do just mentally say I
[1:18:09] believe it and I accept it but then if
[1:18:11] you accept it on these these basis then
[1:18:14] you just keep saying it over and
[1:18:16] over say it out
[1:18:20] loud come on say it out loud I'm here
[1:18:25] and he keeps saying it say it over and
[1:18:27] over I'm Healed I'm Healed say it until
[1:18:30] you actually believe
[1:18:32] it and he said when you believe it then
[1:18:35] something's going to take place he said
[1:18:38] but don't have a negative testimony
[1:18:40] every time when you confess well I still
[1:18:42] feel bad today and you go right straight
[1:18:45] back to the same rut you was in the
[1:18:46] beginning that's not a man or woman
[1:18:48] that's been baptized with the Holy
[1:18:49] Spirit but would start that your convers
[1:18:52] your confession saying I believe I've
[1:18:54] lost the Holy Spirit I believe it's gone
[1:18:56] for me and you'll go right
[1:18:59] down that's right don't ever have a
[1:19:03] negative
[1:19:06] testimony amen you can look that up as
[1:19:08] many times don't ever have no negative
[1:19:11] testimony Jesus has healed me I'm well
[1:19:15] it is
[1:19:16] finished come on somebody Jesus has
[1:19:19] healed me I'm well it is finished it is
[1:19:23] over with I'm not dealing with that no
[1:19:25] more yeah I may still have the symptoms
[1:19:28] but symptoms are liars his word is the
[1:19:30] truth and his word says I'm Healed
[1:19:32] therefore I'm Healed his word says I'm
[1:19:35] saved therefore I'm
[1:19:37] saved his word says I'm a son or
[1:19:39] daughter of God therefore I am a son or
[1:19:42] daughter of
[1:19:44] God don't ever have no negative
[1:19:47] testimony testify positive Jesus has
[1:19:50] healed me and I'm well

[1:19:56] healing no matter how you're feeling if
[1:19:59] you go to feeling and you know go back
[1:20:00] to that every time that you have a
[1:20:02] negative testimony every time you look
[1:20:04] at the symptoms then you fall back
[1:20:06] that's not a
[1:20:08] Christian amen that's not a Christian is
[1:20:11] no matter how solid you are in faith is
[1:20:13] right now that something's happened to
[1:20:15] get you a hold of you to tell you're not
[1:20:17] a Christian you start out testify well
[1:20:19] I'm not a Christian no more and you'll
[1:20:21] drop right back you're no more a
[1:20:22] Christian as soon as you testify that
[1:20:24] you've
[1:20:26] Fallen amen see it's a strange thing
[1:20:28] that this is so much thought of people
[1:20:31] they say well I'm weak my faith is not
[1:20:33] very much I'm not a very good Christian
[1:20:35] that's just what the devil wants you to
[1:20:39] say come on somebody that's just what
[1:20:42] the devil wants you to say I'm not a
[1:20:45] very good Christian amen you must never
[1:20:47] say
[1:20:48] that direct quote you must never say
[1:20:52] that don't never let your testimony be
[1:20:54] be negative let it be positive all the
[1:20:56] time I'm saved I have God in my heart I
[1:21:00] believe him with all my heart with all
[1:21:03] my heart it's
[1:21:06] finished and let your testimony always
[1:21:09] your thoughts everything never permit a
[1:21:11] negative thought to come to your mind if
[1:21:12] you can help
[1:21:14] it and if it does come don't entertain
[1:21:19] it sure the devil's going to put
[1:21:21] negative thoughts to in your mind

[1:21:24] goes on this church all kind of negative
[1:21:26] thought but you ain't got to entertain
[1:21:27] that

[1:24:14] Temple of the Holy Ghost I don't have to
[1:24:17] listen to your nonsense
[1:24:19] [Applause]
[1:24:24] amen see you speak what you believe in
[1:24:26] your
[1:24:27] heart ah yeah you know you can pretend
[1:24:30] for a while and
[1:24:31] lie you know and say things and you
[1:24:34] really don't believe it but when your
[1:24:35] guard is down and you speak without
[1:24:38] thinking you will say what you
[1:24:44] believe well I just want to give him a
[1:24:46] piece of my mind how many pieces you got
[1:24:48] left
[1:24:55] amen some sooner or later you're going
[1:24:56] to run out of
[1:24:58] pieces Romans 10 verse 8 said but what
[1:25:01] saith that the word of not is n the word
[1:25:04] is n the even in the mouth in thy mouth
[1:25:06] and in thy heart that is the word of
[1:25:08] faith which we preach that it sh th Thou
[1:25:11] shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord
[1:25:13] Jesus and Sh believe in thy heart that
[1:25:15] God has raised him from the dead and
[1:25:17] thou shalt be saved for with the heart
[1:25:19] man believeth un righteousness but with
[1:25:21] the mouth confession is made unto
[1:25:24] salvation so where is the word of faith
[1:25:26] it's in the heart and in the
[1:25:29] mouth amen for for Faith to work
[1:25:32] properly it must be in both places amen
[1:25:35] what you believe in your heart must be
[1:25:37] expressed through your mouth for it to
[1:25:39] produce salvation means Deliverance so
[1:25:41] this is the way the scripture tells us
[1:25:43] people can be delivered and set free by
[1:25:45] believing it in their heart and saying
[1:25:48] it in their
[1:25:50] mouth Amen brother Tom Ray told me one
[1:25:53] time he was preaching along these lines
[1:25:54] and speak to your mountain and he said
[1:25:56] as he was speaking the spirit of God got
[1:25:59] to moveing and up in the balcony there a
[1:26:01] a little lady stood up just in the
[1:26:03] middle of his sermon she just got so
[1:26:05] overwhelmed by and she said I believe my
[1:26:07] family saved in the name of the Lord
[1:26:09] Jesus Christ and he said that we watched
[1:26:13] as God moved Time After Time After Time
[1:26:16] till he brought them all in and gave him
[1:26:18] the Holy Ghost amen what was it it was
[1:26:21] believing in the heart but it can't just
[1:26:23] stay there it has to be spoken out of
[1:26:25] your lips it has to be released there's
[1:26:28] a power that has to be
[1:26:29] released your words have power this is
[1:26:32] why he would say to the the disciples he
[1:26:34] says who does man who do men say that I
[1:26:37] am and some say well you're John the
[1:26:39] Baptist some say Elias some say Jeremiah
[1:26:41] or one of the prophets he said well who
[1:26:43] do you
[1:26:45] say really don't matter what anybody
[1:26:47] else thinks is what do you
[1:26:49] think amen you know what do you think
[1:26:52] you're going to get out of this service
[1:26:57] come on it ain't really mattering what
[1:26:59] anybody else thinks what do you
[1:27:01] think amen you know uh what are you
[1:27:04] expecting to receive and Simon answered
[1:27:06] and said Thou Art the Christ the son of
[1:27:08] the Living
[1:27:10] God and he said blessed art thou Simon
[1:27:12] bar Jonah for flesh and blood has not
[1:27:15] revealed you didn't learn this from your
[1:27:16] mom and dad amen but my Father which is
[1:27:20] in heaven and I say to thee that thou
[1:27:22] art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll be of
[1:27:24] my church upon what rock not Peter but
[1:27:27] the revelation of who Jesus was or is
[1:27:30] amen and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:27:32] Prevail against it and I'll give unto
[1:27:34] thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:27:36] and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[1:27:38] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[1:27:40] Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be
[1:27:42] loosed in heaven see Faith spoke and
[1:27:46] power was
[1:27:47] released hallelujah hallelujah Faith
[1:27:50] decreed and power to was loose amen was
[1:27:54] given to loose and to
[1:27:56] bind because a man spoke what he
[1:28:01] believed Peter believed it because there
[1:28:03] was many there was 70 that walked away
[1:28:05] from him he said You shall eat my flesh
[1:28:07] and drink my blood and they was that's a
[1:28:09] hard saying what is he talking about and
[1:28:11] they left and Jesus looked at them said
[1:28:13] will you go also and Peter said where
[1:28:15] else are we going to go only you have
[1:28:17] the words of eternal

[1:28:40] walked away and now their children are
[1:28:42] homosexuals and all kinds of stuff
[1:28:44] that's going on I'm not going
[1:28:48] there where else are we going to go

[1:36:06] if we would allow our mouth to release
[1:36:08] our
[1:36:09] faith and speak the word of
[1:36:14] God so well I don't know brother Tim
[1:36:17] what brother brand says it like this
[1:36:19] says which has greater Authority
[1:36:21] greatest Authority and a angel from
[1:36:24] heaven or an angel in the pull pit he
[1:36:26] said an angel at the pull pit yes sir
[1:36:30] amen Paul said if an angel from heaven
[1:36:32] comes and preach any other gospel than
[1:36:33] this that I've already preached let him
[1:36:35] be a curse so Thea the so the angel
[1:36:37] Anointed with the Holy Spirit and with
[1:36:39] the word stands next to God in heaven
[1:36:42] his authority all powers in Heaven and
[1:36:44] Earth is given to my hand go and I'll go
[1:36:46] with you what if you loose on Earth I'll
[1:36:48] bind in he or I'll loose on Heaven
[1:36:50] whatever you bind in on Earth I'll bind
[1:36:52] in heaven
[1:36:55] he said if the holy go holy church if
[1:36:57] the great holy church only realized this
[1:37:00] power to do these things now notice he
[1:37:02] talks about the angel the pull pit but
[1:37:04] he didn't leave it right there he said
[1:37:06] if the great holy church only realized
[1:37:09] his power to do these things but there's
[1:37:11] so much doubt and fear and trembling
[1:37:13] wondering if it will could it happen as
[1:37:15] long as that exists the church will
[1:37:18] never stand upright but when every talk
[1:37:21] of fear
[1:37:25] oh talk of fear is vanished sir listen
[1:37:30] you can't help help having thoughts of
[1:37:32] fear or thoughts of unbelief or thoughts
[1:37:36] of Doubt but don't ever let them
[1:37:38] thoughts become
[1:37:40] talk cuz that's when it's got
[1:37:43] power when every talk of fear is
[1:37:46] vanished and the Holy Spirit is complete
[1:37:48] control of the church all those fears
[1:37:51] gone that church has the power
[1:37:53] power and they have everything that
[1:37:56] heaven owns behind
[1:37:58] them amen we're not in this
[1:38:02] alone you are not by
[1:38:04] yourself this church is not by itself
[1:38:07] the bride around this world is not by
[1:38:09] theel matter of fact there's more with
[1:38:11] us than there is against
[1:38:13] us amen you say well brother Timothy
[1:38:16] there's a lot of cancer there's a lot of
[1:38:17] fears there's a lot of anxieties there's
[1:38:19] a lot of all sin there there's so so
[1:38:21] much of it seem like every I don't know
[1:38:23] a person anymore that ain't affected by
[1:38:26] cancer or some kind of sickness but let
[1:38:28] me tell you there's more healing than
[1:38:30] there is sickness there's more joy than
[1:38:32] there is sorrow there's more salvation
[1:38:35] than there is sin there's more for us
[1:38:38] than there is against
[1:38:40] us and if God be for us who can be
[1:38:44] against us no weapon formed against you
[1:38:46] will
[1:38:48] prosper but it'll fall to the
[1:38:51] ground whenever talk of fear is
[1:38:56] vanished they have everything that
[1:38:57] heaven owns behind them they're
[1:38:59] ambassadors of the throne the ambassador
[1:39:01] of Christ has the authority and anything
[1:39:03] that Christ own belongs to that
[1:39:05] Ambassador he said go ye into all the
[1:39:07] world you're my Witnesses after the Holy
[1:39:09] Ghost has come upon you and what is a
[1:39:12] witness it is an ambassador now I've
[1:39:14] been overseas a lot and they got
[1:39:17] ambassadors to countries and we've
[1:39:20] watched Even in our governments how they
[1:39:22] backed off and let people get killed and
[1:39:24] stuff because you know what for
[1:39:26] political reasons or whatever and that
[1:39:28] Ambassador thinking he's got the
[1:39:30] authority of the country behind them
[1:39:32] then the country moves back the this
[1:39:34] country is going to move back it may do
[1:39:36] a lot of things but one thing God won't
[1:39:38] do he will never move back from
[1:39:46] you no he'll stay right there matter of
[1:39:50] fact if you find yourself without God
[1:39:52] you go back to where you left left
[1:39:55] him amen so he will never back back up
[1:39:59] from a fight he will never back up from
[1:40:02] a battle he never pulls back and say
[1:40:04] well just see if you can handle this one
[1:40:06] no he's there all the time he's moving
[1:40:10] all the time he's helping all the
[1:40:13] time where would we be if it wasn't for
[1:40:16] him this morning a lot of us would be
[1:40:18] out on the streets a lot of us probably
[1:40:19] be dead in the graveyard somewhere amen
[1:40:21] if it wasn't for God moving in our
[1:40:23] hearts and our Liv and many times we
[1:40:25] don't even think about it but God is
[1:40:27] always orchestrating
[1:40:31] things sometimes we get all upset
[1:40:33] because you know we're delayed a little
[1:40:35] bit and meanwhile God's blocking you
[1:40:36] from
[1:40:38] something you don't ever know what's
[1:40:40] behind the scenes but all you got to put
[1:40:43] is in your mind and heart and confession
[1:40:45] is all things work together for the
[1:40:48] good all
[1:40:51] things but to be an ambassador
[1:40:54] amen the whole powers of Heaven is right
[1:40:57] in your hands it's not in heaven it's in
[1:41:00] your hands but the church will still
[1:41:03] will still sit bar and we sit dormant is
[1:41:06] because we don't recognize what we
[1:41:10] have he said when the least of his
[1:41:12] Believers no matter how long how little
[1:41:14] whatever you are the least of his
[1:41:16] Believers is in him all evil is under
[1:41:19] you Christ is the head of the body
[1:41:22] wherever the head is the bodies with
[1:41:25] it amen we saw his head in heaven the
[1:41:28] cloud was signifying his head but
[1:41:30] where's his body it's on
[1:41:33] Earth amen showed it Revelations 10 he
[1:41:36] had a head in heaven but his body came
[1:41:38] down on Earth and he put one foot upon
[1:41:40] the land and one foot upon the sea
[1:41:41] showing he had dominion over every Power
[1:41:44] but who's represented by that body you
[1:41:48] are amen it ain't just one man Christ
[1:41:51] it's his body on Earth operating as he
[1:41:54] would operate healing as he would heal
[1:41:57] deliver as he would deliver yes sir well

[1:42:05] maybe you are maybe you're nothing but
[1:42:07] the souls on the maybe that's all you
[1:42:08] are just the souls on his feet but when
[1:42:11] that foot goes
[1:42:12] down every Devil's under
[1:42:16] you you might be that's why he'd say the
[1:42:18] least the least believer would get down
[1:42:21] on his knees every devil in hell
[1:42:24] trembles that's
[1:42:28] right amen see he don't get out of his
[1:42:31] word where Jesus is the church is with
[1:42:34] him he stays with the word watch it make
[1:42:36] it manifest his church is with him well

[1:42:46] every
[1:42:47] sickness listed every devil every Power

[1:42:54] feet amen I don't feel he said I don't
[1:42:56] even feel like I'm 52 this morning
[1:42:58] that's the truth if I can just get the
[1:43:00] church to see it brother we'll be Tri

[1:48:24] mattered was the badge that was on his
[1:48:27] chest amen and he went back out there
[1:48:29] and the man tried to bully him again but
[1:48:31] Barney for a moment tried to back up but
[1:48:33] all of a sudden he remembered those
[1:48:34] words but this badge speaks for what I

[1:48:48] stand up to the devil one time and say
[1:48:50] devil listen I may not be nothing but it
[1:48:53] ain't dependent on my strength it's
[1:48:55] dependent on the badge of the holy
[1:48:57] spirit that lives on the inside of me
[1:49:00] and I have authority over you this
[1:49:04] morning and you'll realize he's just a
[1:49:06] bluff it's all he is he said when that
[1:49:09] man steps out and he's all them cars
[1:49:11] whooping up and down he says
[1:49:14] stop all them
[1:49:17] [Applause]
[1:49:19] brakesman I've seen it happen brother
[1:49:21] Matt I I've seen it happen when a man
[1:49:24] gets enough of the devil and he speaks
[1:49:27] out a word of faith and he says
[1:49:31] stop and he has to stop listen where
[1:49:34] some fathers at get enough of the devil
[1:49:36] that's going through your home and say
[1:49:40] stop come on somebody amen where's
[1:49:43] somebody at that's tired of the devil
[1:49:44] running through their mind and say
[1:49:47] stop you I don't have to bow down to
[1:49:50] your thoughts those are not my thoughts
[1:49:55] brother talks about it very clearly go
[1:49:57] look up he said how does some questions
[1:49:59] ask him how do you know if you're
[1:50:00] thinking your thoughts or the devil's
[1:50:02] thoughts he says anything that's
[1:50:04] contrary to the word of God is the
[1:50:05] devil's
[1:50:07] thinking and he said anything that's
[1:50:09] lined up with the word of God is God's
[1:50:11] thinking he never puts it actually on
[1:50:13] the person who asked the question it's
[1:50:15] either the devil's or it's
[1:50:19] Gods come on somebody so if you're
[1:50:22] thinking thoughts that are contrary to
[1:50:24] the word of God that is the devil's
[1:50:26] thinking it's not your thinking it's the
[1:50:28] devil trying to put thoughts there but
[1:50:30] if you allow it to sit there you know
[1:50:32] he'll laugh he'll come in with suicide
[1:50:34] thoughts and he'll hammer and Hammer and
[1:50:36] Hammer until finally somebody puts those
[1:50:38] thoughts into
[1:50:40] action come on Amen but he has no power
[1:50:43] Amen to do anything unless that person
[1:50:45] puts that thought into an
[1:50:47] action and this is exactly right he has
[1:50:50] no power he can put thoughts of
[1:50:52] negativity ity he can put thoughts of
[1:50:54] all kinds of things towards your
[1:50:55] marriage towards the church towards your
[1:50:57] child towards whatever but unless you
[1:50:59] put it into action he has no
[1:51:02] power same with God's thoughts if you
[1:51:04] never put them into action there's no
[1:51:07] power but once you releas it in faith
[1:51:09] believing all things are possible I can
[1:51:12] have what God has told me I can have I
[1:51:14] can have my children yes how do you know
[1:51:17] you can have your children brother

[1:51:20] could he said the promises unto you and
[1:51:22] your children he said they shall be

[1:52:08] Timothy my wife's going through the
[1:52:10] change yeah I do know
[1:52:13] brother I've seen
[1:52:16] it but I know God's still God during
[1:52:19] those moments
[1:52:20] too I seen my own mom I never thought
[1:52:23] that I would have to sit down and
[1:52:24] counsel my mom and
[1:52:26] dad sit down with my mom cuz she was
[1:52:29] going through the change of life and it
[1:52:30] was so hard on
[1:52:32] her and she was just tore
[1:52:34] up in her mind the devil put all kinds
[1:52:37] of crazy thoughts in her mind and she's
[1:52:40] begin to think it was her own thoughts
[1:52:42] and she just cried and to me and said
[1:52:44] tell me I don't want to think these
[1:52:45] things you devil was anointing
[1:52:47] jealousies and stuff all kinds of
[1:52:49] stuff so she had got on some some
[1:52:52] hormonal treatment and things and that
[1:52:54] wasn't helping and she went over to a
[1:52:56] meeting over there in in in Europe
[1:52:59] brother Tim and brother Ron Spencer
[1:53:00] brother Eddie biscuit was invited there
[1:53:03] ministering and one night had been a
[1:53:07] deal went on I won go into all that but
[1:53:09] Dad was up late dealing with a situation
[1:53:12] she was in her room and she was all tore
[1:53:13] up in her thoughts my mom when she'd get
[1:53:16] nervous she'd ring her hands and walk
[1:53:18] back and forth and crying and thinking
[1:53:20] something's happening to my dad you know
[1:53:22] and
[1:53:23] all kinds of thoughts are going through
[1:53:24] her mind he walks in and finds her all
[1:53:25] Disturbed and has to spend hours calming
[1:53:27] her down and the next night brother Ron
[1:53:29] Spencer's
[1:53:31] preaching he's walked down the aisle and
[1:53:33] he looked at looked at my mom and he
[1:53:35] said sister Karen the work God started
[1:53:37] in you he's going to finish he said God
[1:53:40] saw you last night ringing your hands he
[1:53:42] said but God's here to finish the work
[1:53:44] listen brother Matt I saw a woman that
[1:53:46] went there so hurt and so bound up by
[1:53:49] this thing of of hormones and things
[1:53:51] that was just so so torment in her mind
[1:53:53] come back a different
[1:53:56] person actually what she used to be and
[1:53:59] she didn't know no longer her rest of
[1:54:01] her life ever had to have any hormones
[1:54:03] any treatment anything so I know God
[1:54:06] heals that
[1:54:12] too but he wants to take people in their
[1:54:15] weaknesses and make them think well
[1:54:16] you're just thinking that that's who you
[1:54:19] are that's you know the devil no that's
[1:54:21] just the devil coming in your mind and
[1:54:23] trying to twist it and turn it and hurt
[1:54:26] you and hurt
[1:54:28] others but there is a power that's
[1:54:30] greater I'm a witness of it you can
[1:54:33] stand upon the word of God and say devil
[1:54:39] stop let me just drop a little Word of
[1:54:41] Wisdom here when you say that you ain't
[1:54:43] talking to your
[1:54:46] wife you ain't talking to your
[1:54:49] husband well I tell you devil stop you
[1:54:51] got a
[1:54:54] no no that'll cause you a lot of grief
[1:54:58] cause you a lot of trouble but when you
[1:55:00] get down on your knees and say God I
[1:55:03] don't know how to handle this I don't
[1:55:04] know what to do I don't know where to
[1:55:06] turn but I know the devil has no right I
[1:55:10] know he has no right to come and cause
[1:55:12] this torment and cause this this
[1:55:14] Division I know he has no right so
[1:55:17] therefore I submit myself to you God
[1:55:22] I've had to do it many
[1:55:25] times when you realize who is at work CU
[1:55:29] if you find out how quickly I don't even
[1:55:31] know why we're going down all these
[1:55:33] paths but we're just here but I know you
[1:55:36] know how it is he he makes sure that
[1:55:38] you're on your way to
[1:55:40] church or somebody's about to come
[1:55:44] over something's about to take place
[1:55:47] then he wants to bring all this stuff up
[1:55:49] in your
[1:55:50] life because he knows something
[1:55:52] somebody's about to get
[1:55:54] help and he's trying to destroy it and
[1:55:57] hurt it where help can't
[1:56:00] come but this is where we got to submit
[1:56:02] oursel it's not that we're strong we're
[1:56:05] nothing but what is behind
[1:56:08] you what's with you you've joined an
[1:56:11] army you've joined a force there's going
[1:56:13] to be keep that you're going to keep law

[1:56:25] because you're raised and sitting in
[1:56:27] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and the
[1:56:29] devil recognizes that and everything
[1:56:33] slides as breaks when those hands go
[1:56:37] up hallelujah amen maybe this morning
[1:56:41] you don't feel like it and you've seen
[1:56:43] yourself all tore up and you seen
[1:56:45] yourself tore up in your spirit but if
[1:56:46] you'll just start raising those
[1:56:49] hands I'll throw up these hands
[1:56:52] and praise you again and again amen I
[1:56:56] may not feel like it I may not want to
[1:56:58] it may not be what's going on me at the
[1:57:00] moment but if I'll just do it
[1:57:09] anyhow this man one time came to
[1:57:12] Jesus he was a
[1:57:15] centurion he came to him as we bring
[1:57:17] these things
[1:57:20] down said Lord my servant is lying
[1:57:23] paralyzed Jesus said well I'll come and
[1:57:25] heal him he said well I I'm not worthy
[1:57:27] for you to even come under my roof but
[1:57:29] you say the word and he's
[1:57:34] healed see because I'm a man that's
[1:57:36] subject to Authority uh with soldiers
[1:57:38] that are subject to me I say to one go
[1:57:40] and he goes I say one come and he comes
[1:57:42] my slave do this and he does it Jesus
[1:57:45] answered he was amazed said those that
[1:57:47] are following I tell you truly I have
[1:57:50] not found such great faith that anyone
[1:57:52] in Israel I say to you that many
[1:57:54] Gentiles will come from the East and
[1:57:56] West and will sit down with Abraham
[1:57:58] Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:58:00] while the sons and Heirs of the Kingdom
[1:58:02] those that are descendants of Abraham
[1:58:04] who would not recognize me as Messiah
[1:58:06] will be thrown into the outer Darkness
[1:58:08] into that place there' be weeping and
[1:58:10] grinding of teeth and Jesus turned to
[1:58:13] him said go and it will be done for you
[1:58:16] as you have
[1:58:18] believed and the servant was restored to
[1:58:21] health that that very
[1:58:24] hour he said I like the attitude of the
[1:58:27] Centurion he man that felt unworthy and
[1:58:29] as long as you feel Unworthy of the
[1:58:32] blessing you're asking you're going to
[1:58:34] get
[1:58:36] it when you get to a place where you
[1:58:38] think that God just owes it to you then
[1:58:40] that's where you're mistaken we're in
[1:58:42] debt to God God is not in debt to us but
[1:58:45] we're indebted to him but he said Lord
[1:58:47] I'm not worthy that you come under my
[1:58:49] roof neither I'm worthy to come face you
[1:58:52] in other words I've sent to your church
[1:58:54] to meet you and ask this question but I
[1:58:56] have faith I know that you're man and
[1:58:58] authority and you speak the word and
[1:59:01] it'll
[1:59:04] happen Jesus said I've never seen such
[1:59:09] faith in all of
[1:59:11] Israel we have been brought under the
[1:59:14] time of restoration it's a full rest not
[1:59:17] Reformation restoration it's restoring
[1:59:19] it right back to an Eden again
[1:59:24] brother you can go through this and I
[1:59:25] I'm I'm not going to go through all of
[1:59:26] it but brother Brown talks about
[1:59:28] restoration and to restore is to bring
[1:59:30] it back a claim and enforce it and you
[1:59:34] enforce it by your voice he said restore
[1:59:36] is to bring back what it was at the
[1:59:38] beginning back to a natural condition in
[1:59:41] order to do this we have the right to
[1:59:43] enforce it to enforce his rightful
[1:59:46] condition if somebody stole property
[1:59:48] from you and they were holding it
[1:59:50] captive

[1:59:57] happen not no red blooded

[2:18:18] hear men talk we come to hear the word
[2:18:20] of the Lord and I believe God has spoke
[2:18:22] this morning if you could hear it we
[2:18:25] look for God to move brother Mark but
[2:18:27] sometimes in our Humanity we don't see
[2:18:30] what God's really doing but I believe
[2:18:32] that God came this morning and he spoke
[2:18:34] to us and he gave us a word I'm not
[2:18:36] going to be the devil's accomplice amen
[2:18:38] I'm not here to I don't I don't work for
[2:18:40] the devil so I don't speak like the
[2:18:43] devil I don't talk as talk I don't walk
[2:18:45] as walk I'm not here to work for the
[2:18:47] devil I don't here I'm not here to
[2:18:48] represent him I'm not an ambassador of
[2:18:51] the devil this morning but I'm an
[2:18:52] ambassador of Jesus Christ so it may get
[2:18:55] on your nerves but I want to testify
[2:18:57] about what God says may not be the
[2:18:59] answer you want to hear sometimes but
[2:19:01] let's just say what God says about it
[2:19:03] and it'll fix every problem sometimes it
[2:19:05] don't feel good when somebody don't
[2:19:06] agree with you everybody wants you to
[2:19:07] see it their way but I think we need to
[2:19:09] just take what the word says and stand
[2:19:11] on it because it's the word of the Lord
[2:19:13] amen I believe that I believe we have a
[2:19:15] right we have a right to come and stand
[2:19:17] on God's word amen how many believe that
[2:19:19] say amen amen want somebody give him a
[2:19:21] hand clap of Praise again and we're
[2:19:23] going to say keep on the fire in line
[2:19:25] keep on the fireing line amen somebody
[2:19:27] say praise the Lord L somebody say
[2:19:30] hallelujah hallelujah I know people
[2:19:32] don't like that when you do that but the
[2:19:34] prophet did it he said I think we ought
[2:19:35] we ought to say hallelujah we ought to
[2:19:37] praise the lord we shouldn't be afraid
[2:19:38] to worship God you know that's what
[2:19:41] happened to Daniel that day whenever the
[2:19:42] king put out a decree and they came by
[2:19:45] and said you couldn't pray anymore and
[2:19:46] you couldn't you couldn't worship any
[2:19:48] other God besides the god that we've
[2:19:50] created but Daniel said I'm not living
[2:19:52] by King's decree but I've been given
[2:19:54] another decree this morning it was
[2:19:56] called Faith's decree and I can lift my
[2:19:58] hands and the Bible said with his window
[2:20:00] open he bowed down and he prayed to God
[2:20:03] Daniel was a worshipper he wasn't
[2:20:05] ashamed of what anybody thought about
[2:20:06] him and I believe that's the way we
[2:20:07] ought to be as Believers this morning
[2:20:09] with the windows open we ought to lift
[2:20:11] our hands and say praise the Lord how
[2:20:12] many say praise the Lord this morning
[2:20:14] don't be ashamed of God don't let that
[2:20:16] old cold Spirit come into the church and
[2:20:19] well I got a secret serve God secret
[2:20:21] worship God after all it's according to
[2:20:23] the dict it ain't the dictates of your
[2:20:24] heart that's what the devil's doing when
[2:20:26] he suppresses the believer say from
[2:20:28] saying I believe God we ought to be able
[2:20:30] to confess that out of our mouth I
[2:20:32] believe God and I deny every devil that
[2:20:34] would tell you anything different it's
[2:20:36] God and he's God in power and we got a
[2:20:38] right to worship him we got a right to
[2:20:40] lift our hands not not only do we have a
[2:20:42] right to but according to my Bible we're
[2:20:44] obligated to as Believers to worship Our
[2:20:47] God and any devil that would stand in
[2:20:49] the way within you going out the doors
[2:20:51] and go Fellowship somewhere else but
[2:20:53] because we have a right to worship God
[2:20:55] and we got a right to do it without the
[2:20:56] devil suppressing God's people we got a
[2:20:59] right to be free this is a church that's
[2:21:01] free and you have a right to come in
[2:21:03] here and be free not to have some Spirit
[2:21:05] come in and sit down the Pew next to you
[2:21:06] and suppress your worship and your
[2:21:08] praise to God I rebuke that devil in the
[2:21:11] name of Jesus Christ these people are
[2:21:13] God's people they're God's free men and
[2:21:15] women the prophet called them and they
[2:21:16] got a right to worship their maker they
[2:21:19] got a right to say God I love you you
[2:21:21] got a right to confess and speak out of
[2:21:23] your mouth that's what the devil's what
[2:21:25] took everything out of our mouth but we
[2:21:28] got a right here's what the brother said
[2:21:29] we got a right to speak I say we should
[2:21:32] speak it this morning speak worship
[2:21:34] speak Grace speak praise speak speak
[2:21:37] edifying things to one another I believe
[2:21:39] it was a word from the Lord amen we're
[2:21:41] not a bunch of Fanatics coming around
[2:21:43] here just saying a bunch of things he
[2:21:45] read that quote that's one of my
[2:21:46] favorite quotes brother B said you say
[2:21:47] it until you do believe it cuz the world
[2:21:50] looks at says you're a fanatic because
[2:21:51] you're just saying things but you say it
[2:21:54] from your heart and you keep confessing
[2:21:55] it until you do believe it amen how many
