[47:56] that c kindled that's what we want
[47:57] tonight amen amen how many love the Lord
[48:00] amen we just want to read out of 1
[48:02] Timothy the 3rd Chapter and the 16th
[48:04] verse the Bible says and without
[48:06] controversy great is the mystery of
[48:08] godliness for God was manifest In the
[48:10] Flesh justified in the spirit seen of
[48:13] angels preached unto the Gentiles
[48:16] believed on in the world and received up
[48:18] into Glory now we also want to read out
[48:21] of Romans the 8th chapter and the 19th
[48:24] verse and the Bible says for the earnest
[48:27] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[48:29] the
[48:30] manifestation of the sons of God and
[48:32] we'll just ask the Lord to add His
[48:34] blessings to the reading of the word as
[48:35] you take your seats notice as Paul would
[48:38] say this in the book of Timothy he says
[48:41] that he was he was justified in the
[48:43] spirit but God was manifested In the
[48:46] Flesh and then Romans Paul said but the
[48:48] earnest expectation of the creature
[48:50] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[48:52] sons of God I got this out I want to I
[48:54] want to speak on on manifesting God 's
[48:57] perfect purpose and I took this out of u
[49:00] a message that brother R would preach
[49:02] have faith in God he was talking about a
[49:03] missionary trip that they had gone to
[49:05] India and how they had gone in and the
[49:07] authorities in India had asked them as
[49:09] missionaries to don't come as
[49:11] missionaries and he said we've got all
[49:13] the tracks and everything we've already
[49:14] seen all that matter of fact we heard of
[49:16] Jesus Christ before America was even a
[49:18] nation you know India is an older nation
[49:21] and so we've already heard of all that
[49:23] but what we want is somebody who can
[49:25] make the word manifest that's what we
[49:27] want to see is someone who can make the
[49:29] word be alive how many can say Amen to
[49:31] that tonight we don't need another track
[49:33] we don't need just some other word or
[49:35] something just to make us feel good but
[49:37] what we need is some people that'll make
[49:39] the word be alive he said the letter kth
[49:41] but the spirit giveth life so the word
[49:43] manifest today is what we need how many
[49:45] say Amen to that in the Church of the
[49:47] Living God what we need today is the
[49:49] word made manifest you know some would
[49:51] asked this question brother Mark if God
[49:53] would come to make the word manifest
[49:56] well how would it come about you know I
[49:57] got to think of all the the questions
[49:59] when you think about the things that God
[50:01] has promised and the purpose that God
[50:03] has promised to come to pass and we
[50:05] sometimes we sit around as as as uh even
[50:08] as Believers but these questions get uh
[50:10] come up in our mind but how would God do
[50:12] that and how How would how would so and
[50:14] so be healed or How would how would the
[50:16] dead ever raise or How would how would
[50:18] there ever be a Rapture how can people
[50:20] leave the Earth and nobody anybody ever
[50:22] sit around and just thought about that
[50:23] am I come on now I'm not the only person
[50:25] how many raise your hand if you thought
[50:27] about it you wonder how God can do some
[50:29] of yall thought about some of y'all just
[50:31] man I want to sit down with you for a
[50:32] little while and gain the wisdom but but
[50:35] but I've always asked that just consider
[50:37] the weakness of My Flesh but brother
[50:38] Dave Paul you know sometimes you wonder
[50:40] how could God do all these things and
[50:42] how could he do this great work and how
[50:45] how could he take a church and Rapture a
[50:46] church and you know these questions that
[50:48] come upon our minds but you know this
[50:50] questions brother Mark they came in the
[50:51] days of Isaiah one time there was many
[50:53] questions that were similar questions
[50:55] and I love how that God answers them
[50:57] through Isaiah the prophet he says first
[50:59] he says in Isaiah 46 he says remember
[51:02] the former things of old so see when a
[51:04] question comes up on the ability of God
[51:06] or what God is able to do the answer he
[51:09] said Remember the former things of old
[51:12] he said for I am God and there is none
[51:14] else I am God and there is none like me
[51:17] so before God would even answer the
[51:18] question tonight first he would ask you
[51:20] to remember who who it is that you're
[51:22] asking the question of so when you
[51:24] wonder how's it how's God able and how
[51:27] how how's he able to to to save my
[51:29] children that are lost and how's he able
[51:30] to to heal the sick and how's he able to
[51:33] put back things together that that had
[51:34] been torn apart and how how has God
[51:37] first he would answer this in this way
[51:39] that first of all I want you to know to
[51:40] remember the things that I've already
[51:42] done remember that I am God and remember
[51:45] there is none else and I am the Lord thy
[51:47] God and there is none like me and then
[51:49] he he makes this reminder and then he
[51:51] says I'm the one that declared the end
[51:53] from the beginning and I'm the one that
[51:55] made the ancient times and the things
[51:56] that are not or that are yet done saying
[51:59] my counsel shall stand and I will do all
[52:02] my pleasure so God tells us in his own
[52:04] word when the questions would come up
[52:06] brother Mark that God you realize that
[52:08] God would say that I'm the one that
[52:09] would do it and you know that why how
[52:11] could God say that I'm the one that's
[52:12] going to do it and I shall bring it to
[52:14] pass and I and it shall be done brother
[52:17] Mark it ain't that God's a fortune
[52:18] teller you know sometimes you get to
[52:20] look in at words and prophecies and
[52:21] things like this and and you say well
[52:23] you know maybe he can just see the
[52:25] future and maybe these predictions and
[52:27] things but God is not a fortune teller
[52:29] he he ain't one that makes predictions
[52:31] he's not he don't have a crystal ball
[52:32] that he's up there trying to look and
[52:34] see how things are going to turn out but
[52:36] the reality is is that God knows what's
[52:39] coming because God plans what's coming
[52:41] and when God plans it then he performs
[52:44] his own plan so we see this in an
[52:46] amplified Bible it would say it this way
[52:47] that my counsel shall stand and I will
[52:49] do all of my pleasure and I will fulfill
[52:52] my purpose so you see that God brother
[52:54] Mark he he makes his own purpose and we
[52:56] don't and you he don't wonder if someone
[52:58] else is going to be responsible for
[53:00] fulfilling his purpose but God when he
[53:03] makes a purpose he takes the
[53:05] responsibility of fulfilling the purpose
[53:08] that he made isn't that a wonderful God
[53:10] so when God makes a purpose and he
[53:11] declares something that will happen God
[53:13] declares it as a purpose and then he
[53:15] takes upon himself the responsibility of
[53:18] fulfilling the purpose that he made I
[53:21] think it's wonderful to think of how
[53:22] that he would write these things he said
[53:24] see when when when he when he makes his
[53:26] purpose or he makes his his his his will
[53:29] or he speaks his word he says I will
[53:31] accomplish all of my purpose I I will
[53:34] take the responsibility so we see this
[53:36] as the case is that God plans brother
[53:38] Mark and he governs all things so
[53:40] anything that we look to come to pass or
[53:42] things that we look to happen we realize
[53:44] that God is in control of it all how
[53:46] many believes that say amen God is in
[53:48] control of it all it's his purpose that
[53:49] is coming to pass so we find out the
[53:52] Bible would tell us this that God has
[53:53] the rightful Authority and the power to
[53:56] bring bring about his own intentions so
[53:58] everything he intends to come about it
[54:00] does come about and it comes about in
[54:02] God's Own time it's fulfilled in God's
[54:04] time just in God's plan his purpose is
[54:06] always fulfilled there's never been a
[54:08] purpose of God that didn't come to pass
[54:10] we God ain't wandering around he ain't
[54:12] scratching his head he's not afraid that
[54:14] things aren't going to work out he don't
[54:15] want he don't Pace the floors like you
[54:17] and I do trying to figure out if things
[54:18] are going to work out but when God makes
[54:20] a purpose it was his plan he purposed it
[54:23] in his heart and he took upon himself
[54:25] the responsibility in order to bring it
[54:27] bring it to pass I I thought you know
[54:29] why why the the world today they try to
[54:31] block God out they try to make the that
[54:33] the world events are just things of
[54:35] chance and and and y' y'all just preach
[54:37] with me just a few minutes but this is
[54:38] the world we live in they they make
[54:40] things that it's just so happen it's
[54:41] just going to be that way and and
[54:43] whoever is the king that it just so
[54:45] happen and whoever is in office it just
[54:47] so happen and and they try to remove God
[54:49] out of everything it is that we do but
[54:51] the reality is is it doesn't matter how
[54:54] hard they try they'll never take Christ
[54:56] out of it it doesn't matter how many
[54:58] efforts they make they'll never take God
[55:00] out of it let me tell you a truth
[55:01] friends that Jesus Christ can't be done
[55:03] away with his word can't be done away
[55:06] with for he's the center of everything
[55:08] in all of history Jesus is the center of
[55:10] it all matter of fact you can take a
[55:12] calendar brother Mark and you'll find
[55:13] out in just a few studies that that that
[55:16] that that every event that ever took
[55:18] place in the history of mankind is
[55:20] categorized around the birth of Jesus
[55:23] Christ how many know that you go you
[55:25] know one time I went through these I I
[55:26] won't do it tonight but you you know you
[55:27] go back in history and and you'll see on
[55:29] the calendar anything that happened
[55:31] before Christ used to it just said BC
[55:34] which was speaking of the time before
[55:35] Christ I know the world is trying to
[55:37] change that and take it all out and make
[55:39] it something else where just so they can
[55:41] remove Christ out of it but but this is
[55:43] how everything was categorized you get
[55:45] an old Encyclopedia Britannica you read
[55:47] in 3100 BC it was when when the Great
[55:50] stonehinge happened in England or in
[55:51] 1200 BC when Greece was invaded 776 BC
[55:56] was when Athletics was formed in in the
[55:58] honor of the Greek god in that in 700 BC
[56:01] in that Century it's when the Roman
[56:03] nation was formed it's when the the
[56:05] great Wars broke out of the Spartans and
[56:07] the and the Persians and the Greeks the
[56:09] things that everybody likes to make
[56:10] movies and things about but but but it
[56:12] was 700 BC it was showing us it was the
[56:15] time before Christ came walking upon the
[56:17] Earth and and and and you see as it as
[56:19] it got closer to the time you see as
[56:21] things begin to happen and and Julius
[56:23] Caesar was assassinated there was a war
[56:26] Great War in Rome and then Caesar
[56:28] Augustus was named Emperor and he had
[56:30] this Zeal to to overtake the everything
[56:32] that was around him and but you notice
[56:34] that while these natural events are
[56:36] taking place there's also the biblical
[56:39] events that we read about in the house
[56:40] of God that are taking place all along
[56:42] the side of it and we see that during
[56:44] this time BC and before Christ there was
[56:46] a man by the name of Abraham that was
[56:48] birthing a nation and we saw as that n
[56:51] nation was formed in the in the life of
[56:53] Jacob and he had his children they
[56:55] remember they went into a into a famine
[56:57] and Joseph went over into Egypt and he
[56:59] found a way that they could be sustained
[57:00] during the famine and and and through
[57:02] all that time through they they went out
[57:04] and the nation came there all the the
[57:07] sons of Israel and they gathered up in
[57:08] that place and God sustained them and
[57:10] for 400 years they worked in that area
[57:13] and they became a great number of people
[57:15] and then God would send Moses he would
[57:17] bring them out of this captivity and
[57:19] this slavery remember remember the old
[57:20] Pharaoh when he saw them growing in
[57:22] number he said there's more of them than
[57:23] there are of us if we don't bind them
[57:25] they'll take us over and so they put
[57:27] pressure on him and they put him in that
[57:28] that that that place of bondage but God
[57:30] he brought Moses and brought him out and
[57:32] then Joshua came in after Moses and he
[57:35] brought them into their Homeland and
[57:36] divided them into lands and you know
[57:38] that you know how the story goes they
[57:39] wanted a king so they raised up Kings
[57:41] and then they went again into another
[57:43] captivity and Babylonian Rule and and
[57:46] then in the middle of all that
[57:47] Babylonian captivity 70 years later they
[57:50] raises up another man by the name of
[57:51] Nehemiah and zerubabel and these are men
[57:54] that God called and they came to restore
[57:56] the city of Jerusalem and Ezra remember
[57:58] he came back to restore the word I found
[58:00] this I found this so powerful that
[58:02] whenever the King of Persia after all of
[58:04] this fall and all the the tragic rise
[58:07] and fall of the nation of Israel that
[58:09] here they are in this captivity their
[58:11] they their their Temple that Solomon had
[58:13] built had been torn down it just seemed
[58:15] like it wasn't nothing there and the
[58:17] promise of God had failed and the
[58:19] purpose of God had failed and all the
[58:21] things that God had promised them it had
[58:22] came to nothing it didn't last very long
[58:24] just a few years but brother Mark in the
[58:27] middle of this captivity there comes
[58:28] another man that was raised up named
[58:30] King Cyrus who was the king over over
[58:33] over Persia and when they took over
[58:34] Babylon the Bible says watch what God
[58:37] does with King Cyrus here he was a
[58:39] gentile King but I think it's so
[58:41] wonderful to see that God would take a
[58:43] gentile King and use him to advance his
[58:47] purpose upon his people here was a man
[58:49] that wasn't a follower he was a man that
[58:51] wasn't he wasn't uh he wasn't of the
[58:53] nation of Israel he was a Persian king
[58:55] but the Bible said in Ezra the first
[58:57] chapter that the first year of Cyrus the
[59:00] King of Persia that the word of the Lord
[59:02] came by the mouth of Jeremiah that it
[59:04] might be fulfilled that the Lord steered
[59:06] up the spirit of Cyrus the King of
[59:08] Persia and he made a proclamation
[59:10] throughout all the kingdom he put it in
[59:12] writing saying thus saith Cyrus the King
[59:15] of Persia that the Lord God Of Heaven
[59:17] hath given me all the kingdoms of the
[59:18] earth he's charged me to build him a
[59:20] house in Jerusalem where which is Judah
[59:23] who is there among you that are of his
[59:25] people his God be with him and let him
[59:27] go back to Jerusalem which is in Judah
[59:30] and build a house of the Lord God of
[59:32] Israel for he is God which is in
[59:35] Jerusalem I thought when I read that I
[59:37] thought my isn't it something that God
[59:39] here he shows us that he will work his
[59:41] purpose no matter who he has to use to
[59:44] bring his purpose about here was a man
[59:46] that had nothing to do with Israel here
[59:48] was a king that came out of another
[59:50] Nation here he he didn't have ties to to
[59:53] Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob and
[59:55] the Crossing over the Red Sea or the
[59:57] coming out of Egypt or or or the or the
[59:59] one the Tabernacle in the wilderness he
[1:00:01] wasn't tied to any of that he was a
[1:00:03] gentile King brother Mar raised in
[1:00:04] another Nation raised under another
[1:00:06] family raised for his own purpose and in
[1:00:09] his Zeal to take over the world here was
[1:00:11] his own statement God has given me the
[1:00:13] Whole World in His Zeal to take over the
[1:00:15] world that something in his Spirit would
[1:00:18] say but I got to go back to Jerusalem
[1:00:20] and I'm going to let y'all go home and
[1:00:21] be rebuild your temple and I'll let you
[1:00:23] do it in peace and I'll even give you
[1:00:25] the money and the supplies in order to
[1:00:26] build it I thought that's how our God is
[1:00:29] he used a Persian to fulfill his purpose
[1:00:32] he used a Persian king that was a that
[1:00:35] that was a greedy man that had desires
[1:00:37] to build great wealth but God used him
[1:00:39] to make his purpose come about for his
[1:00:41] children let me tell you friends it may
[1:00:43] seem like everything's out of order it
[1:00:45] may seem like everything's out of cater
[1:00:47] and we don't know which way to turn but
[1:00:49] it doesn't matter who's in office it
[1:00:51] doesn't matter who takes who takes
[1:00:52] control my God will use whoever he has
[1:00:55] to use to make his purpose come to pass
[1:00:57] for his children we don't have to wonder
[1:01:00] and worry and fret over over what
[1:01:03] tomorrow holds what we need to know
[1:01:04] tonight is Who Holds Tomorrow and it and
[1:01:07] it's our God he he's still in control he
[1:01:10] still has power he still has a purpose
[1:01:12] and he'll still bring his purpose to
[1:01:14] pass he'll work through whoever he has
[1:01:16] to work through when they went to the
[1:01:18] temple they rebuilt the city Bible says
[1:01:21] they they here in in 63 BC here in this
[1:01:24] Roman Empire came in and they con
[1:01:25] conquer Jerusalem but in the midst of
[1:01:27] this Roman occupied Israel come the
[1:01:30] birth of our Lord Jesus Christ here they
[1:01:32] were in just a in a terrible State and
[1:01:34] and Rome had came in again they they
[1:01:36] they they they couldn't even go out of
[1:01:37] there they were half of them were on a
[1:01:39] curfew there was revolts all the time
[1:01:41] and in the middle of all this chaos of a
[1:01:43] of a torn up Nation being bound by by by
[1:01:46] Rome here comes the birth of our Lord
[1:01:48] and savior they were looking for some
[1:01:49] great king to come and deliver him but
[1:01:51] he was born in a manger and you know
[1:01:53] what happened all of history changed in
[1:01:56] the life of Jesus Christ when it goes
[1:01:58] from The Life of Christ it changes from
[1:02:00] BC to a d an OD Domino which meant the
[1:02:03] year of Our Lord so we see as the time
[1:02:06] would progress brother Mark now we're
[1:02:08] not counting down now we're counting up
[1:02:10] the years from the time that the Lord
[1:02:12] was upon the Earth here we are in the
[1:02:13] year of 2024 from the time that the Lord
[1:02:17] Jesus walked upon the face of the earth
[1:02:19] I thought isn't it something brother
[1:02:20] Marcus history would tell us uh you know
[1:02:22] event would happen after event 1492
[1:02:26] Columbus sail and and founded or found
[1:02:29] America 1776 we became an independent
[1:02:32] nation from English rule in 1865 we had
[1:02:35] that great Civil War slavery was
[1:02:37] abolished at the ending of a of a civil
[1:02:39] war there was these this this is the
[1:02:41] events that took place they were ad ad
[1:02:43] ad but the whole time natural events are
[1:02:46] taking place guess what There Are
[1:02:48] Spiritual events that are taking place
[1:02:50] here after Jesus had had went into the
[1:02:52] tomb and he was ascended the Bible says
[1:02:54] just a few days I can can say Ad but a
[1:02:57] few days later 120 were gathered in the
[1:02:59] upper room and the Holy Ghost fell in
[1:03:01] the upper room they came out of the
[1:03:02] upper room filled with the spirit of God
[1:03:04] and they preach with such conviction and
[1:03:06] power of the Holy Ghost that 3,000 men
[1:03:09] they gave their heart to God on that
[1:03:10] very that that I'm talking about
[1:03:12] unbelievers people that would have made
[1:03:13] fun of and mocked them and people they
[1:03:15] would have hid from a few days before
[1:03:17] but ad they came out and the spirit of
[1:03:19] God was upon them they were filled with
[1:03:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:03:23] men that they went to they took that
[1:03:25] same Spirit of of God and they delivered
[1:03:27] it unto men and they fulfilled the
[1:03:29] commission that God had given to the
[1:03:31] church friends it didn't stop there in
[1:03:33] just a few years there came a man by the
[1:03:35] name of apostle Paul he was called by
[1:03:37] God he went out and done missionary work
[1:03:38] he went into Asia Minor and started
[1:03:40] churches all over all over Asia Minor
[1:03:43] and from his ministry came another man
[1:03:44] from his ministry come a man by the name
[1:03:46] of Iranians that went on to fulfill the
[1:03:49] commission of God and the purpose of God
[1:03:51] and to carry forward God's purpose and
[1:03:54] from there we just see as time would
[1:03:56] continue to go on 312 ad there was a man
[1:03:59] by the name of St Martin and St Martin
[1:04:01] you you ever read the story of him what
[1:04:03] a powerful life that he had here here he
[1:04:05] was a man that was a giver and and and
[1:04:07] and was willing to uh to to give all
[1:04:09] that he had to help those that were poor
[1:04:11] and those around and he had such a
[1:04:13] spirit on him to give and one night it
[1:04:14] was said that St Martin he actually G
[1:04:16] seen a beggar on the street and he gave
[1:04:18] part of his coat to him and that same
[1:04:20] night he had a dream and Jesus appeared
[1:04:22] to him in the dream and he was wearing
[1:04:24] the full coat and when he woke up the
[1:04:26] next morning that the coat was made
[1:04:27] whole I don't know I'm just saying what
[1:04:29] they wrote in history but this was a
[1:04:31] testimony about a man that was filled
[1:04:33] with the spirit of God and it didn't
[1:04:35] stop there in 606 ad there was a man by
[1:04:38] the name of St Columba in the in the
[1:04:40] history you can read books about Columba
[1:04:42] there there books about his life and the
[1:04:44] in the in the spirit of God that was
[1:04:45] upon him but here he would come as a
[1:04:47] messenger to the age that he lived in
[1:04:50] and they would say he healed the sick he
[1:04:52] opened blinded eyes he caused those that
[1:04:54] were dead to be raised he healed
[1:04:56] diseases he he stopped wild beasts he
[1:04:58] spoke to storms and storm ceased he
[1:05:00] wasn't just some Catholic Church priest
[1:05:02] he wasn't just somebody sitting in a
[1:05:03] confession Booth he was a man that was
[1:05:05] filled with the spirit of almighty
[1:05:08] God 1520 ad Martin Luther came to to
[1:05:13] start the Reformation or be a major part
[1:05:15] of the reformation and John Wesley 1750
[1:05:18] ad to carry on this this voice of
[1:05:20] sanctification and and just the
[1:05:22] furtherance of the Gospel all the way
[1:05:23] down into 1906
[1:05:26] the Bible or or the the history would
[1:05:28] tell us that there was a great Revival
[1:05:30] remember that old zza Street Revival
[1:05:31] that we talk about it was an outpouring
[1:05:33] of the Holy Ghost what was it it was so
[1:05:35] impactful that a prophet of God would
[1:05:37] look at that time and he would declare
[1:05:39] it to be the beginning of another age he
[1:05:42] said here we are in the age of leosia it
[1:05:44] was the it was the restoration of
[1:05:46] Pentecost it was where the church had
[1:05:48] come back come back to this place again
[1:05:50] and friends let me tell you this it
[1:05:52] doesn't matter how you look at it I I
[1:05:53] know I'm kind of going fast but I want
[1:05:55] to get a Foundation laid it don't matter
[1:05:57] how you look at it it doesn't matter if
[1:05:58] it's a natural event it doesn't matter
[1:06:00] if it's a spiritual event it doesn't
[1:06:02] matter if it's a world event if it's a a
[1:06:04] Biblical event there is one man that is
[1:06:07] in the center of it all and his name is
[1:06:09] Jesus Christ in all the world in all of
[1:06:12] history there's one man he's in the
[1:06:14] center of it all his name is Jesus let
[1:06:17] me tell you friends not only is he in
[1:06:19] the center of everything that took place
[1:06:20] in time but he's in the center of
[1:06:22] everything that ever took place in
[1:06:24] Eternity for the Bible said in in the
[1:06:26] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:06:28] Earth the Earth was without form and it
[1:06:31] was void and darkness was upon the face
[1:06:33] of the deep see the beginning is a place
[1:06:35] where something started but before there
[1:06:37] was a beginning there was still this
[1:06:39] same Christ before the beginning this
[1:06:42] same this same God in his brother Mark
[1:06:45] he was he was with his thoughts we say
[1:06:47] he was alone with his thoughts but you
[1:06:48] realize but in his thoughts was his
[1:06:52] purpose and he had a desire to see it
[1:06:54] fulfilled God thoughts they they weren't
[1:06:56] like man's thoughts you know we the
[1:06:58] Bible says man's thoughts are on evil
[1:06:59] continually hello somebody you can't sit
[1:07:01] in a church service without your mind
[1:07:02] wanding off to somewhere that it
[1:07:04] shouldn't wander off to because that's
[1:07:05] the way the thoughts of men are but the
[1:07:07] Bible says but God's thoughts are
[1:07:09] perfect thoughts they're pure thoughts
[1:07:10] they're righteous thoughts and he said
[1:07:12] my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:07:14] neither are my ways your ways but my
[1:07:16] thoughts are higher my ways are higher
[1:07:18] and as the rain cometh down and the snow
[1:07:20] from Heaven it Waters the Earth it makes
[1:07:22] it bring a bud that they may give seed
[1:07:24] to the SE and bread to to the eater then
[1:07:26] so shall my word that goth forth out of
[1:07:29] my mouth shall not return unto me void
[1:07:32] but accomplish that which I please and
[1:07:34] shall prosper where I sent it my what a
[1:07:37] promise of God that my word shall
[1:07:40] prosper whereever I send it how many say
[1:07:42] Amen to that so it doesn't matter where
[1:07:44] the word of God Is Spoken it's going to
[1:07:46] prosper how many believe
[1:07:48] that he said it'll Prosper so that means
[1:07:51] when God sends a message to his people
[1:07:53] brother Mark we have a promise from God
[1:07:55] that the word is going to prosper oh I
[1:07:57] love this the whole world is looking for
[1:08:00] Prosperity they're looking for for great
[1:08:02] wealth and to prosper in their work and
[1:08:04] prosper in their life but do you realize
[1:08:06] that the only real Prosperity we ever
[1:08:08] have is in the word of God butam said
[1:08:11] see and until you get back to the real
[1:08:13] gospel again get back to God's word get
[1:08:16] back to thus sayeth the Lord we'll never
[1:08:19] Prosper until we do that listen friends
[1:08:23] you want to see your life Prosper get
[1:08:25] back to thus sayith the Lord you want to
[1:08:27] see your work Prosper get back to thus
[1:08:29] sayeth the Lord you want to see your
[1:08:31] church Prosper get back to thus sayith
[1:08:33] the Lord he said we'll never Prosper
[1:08:35] until we do that that's the only place
[1:08:38] where true Prosperity is see when we
[1:08:40] look at Prosperity we look at this word
[1:08:42] Prosper as success or a gain in material
[1:08:46] things see where God's word it'll
[1:08:48] Prosper it'll gain in in great things
[1:08:50] and gain in material things but you
[1:08:52] realize that in this portion of
[1:08:53] scripture in Isaiah 55 the word Prosper
[1:08:56] comes from a Hebrew word that says salak
[1:08:59] which is TS l a c which don't it don't
[1:09:02] mean to prosper like we would say it but
[1:09:03] it actually means to advance so when you
[1:09:06] requote this scripture here's what God
[1:09:08] says it will advance where I send it
[1:09:10] listen he talks about the rain coming
[1:09:12] down and the rain would stack a seed in
[1:09:14] other words and that seed when the rain
[1:09:16] hits it it won't remain a seed but it's
[1:09:19] going to bring forth the fruit so listen
[1:09:21] he said and so shall my word that goes
[1:09:22] out of my mouth it'll not return void
[1:09:25] but it will accomplish that which I
[1:09:26] please in other words it will advance
[1:09:29] where I send it in other words it will
[1:09:31] cause things to move forward it will
[1:09:33] cause them to grow listen it'll bring a
[1:09:37] seed to life so so God will never allow
[1:09:39] it to remain a seed he'll never allow
[1:09:41] well it might makes me want to preach
[1:09:43] the thoughts that God has about you
[1:09:45] he'll never even allow them to remain a
[1:09:47] thought he said they're good thoughts
[1:09:48] they're great thoughts the thoughts I I
[1:09:50] think toward you they're thoughts of
[1:09:51] peace and not of evil but God's thoughts
[1:09:54] he won't allow them to remain is to but
[1:09:56] he they must become word and they must
[1:09:58] come to pass so see this is this is
[1:10:01] God's word he said it'll Advance where I
[1:10:03] send it so it'll bring seed to life
[1:10:05] listen what science says in order for a
[1:10:07] seed to come to life in order for there
[1:10:09] to be life there has to be four things
[1:10:11] you want know what they are there has to
[1:10:13] be a seed there has to be water there
[1:10:15] has to be a light and there has to be
[1:10:17] bedding ground that's a quick that's an
[1:10:19] Arkansas version of science but that's
[1:10:21] what we have to have in order for it to
[1:10:23] bring forth life and I love this because
[1:10:25] Isaiah as he's writing of the word of
[1:10:27] God God says as the rain comes forth so
[1:10:30] shall my word so he shows us that his
[1:10:33] word is water you see that Paul would
[1:10:36] speak it in Ephesians 5 he said he might
[1:10:38] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:10:40] of the Water by the word so you see he
[1:10:42] types the word as water but now watch
[1:10:45] what Jesus does in Luke the 8th chapter
[1:10:48] he gives a parable to those that are
[1:10:49] sitting around him and he speaks of a
[1:10:51] swer going forth and sowing a seed and
[1:10:54] at the end of the SE seed Falling by the
[1:10:56] wayside some fell on Stony ground some
[1:10:58] fell in the thistle some fell on good
[1:11:00] ground but Jesus said at the end of it
[1:11:02] he said the parable of this is is that
[1:11:04] the seed is the word of God so now not
[1:11:07] only do we have a place where it says
[1:11:09] but the word is water but now Jesus says
[1:11:12] but the word is a seed and then we go
[1:11:15] over into Psalms 1119 and here's what
[1:11:17] David said he said the word is a lamp
[1:11:19] unto my feet and it's a light unto my
[1:11:22] path even Jesus when he would come he
[1:11:24] said I and the light of the world so now
[1:11:27] not only is it water and not only is it
[1:11:29] seed but now Jesus said but it's also a
[1:11:32] lie it's so so the word is all three I
[1:11:34] thought my no wonder that God could say
[1:11:37] that it would Prosper or it would
[1:11:39] Advance where I send it it will not
[1:11:41] remain a seed cuz the same God that
[1:11:43] planted the seed is the same God that
[1:11:45] brought the water and the same God that
[1:11:47] poured out the water is the same God
[1:11:49] that shined his light upon it he's the
[1:11:51] same God that put life on the inside of
[1:11:54] it and he's the same God that'll fulfill
[1:11:56] his purpose in every
[1:11:58] seed it will not remain in seed form no
[1:12:00] wonder God said it would Advance it
[1:12:02] can't remain in seed form cuz it's all
[1:12:04] of that it can't remain in that place
[1:12:07] but you know what God had to do brother
[1:12:09] Tom God had to do one more thing he had
[1:12:11] to make an atmosphere for a seed to grow
[1:12:13] it takes us all the way back to this
[1:12:15] time of creation the Bible says the
[1:12:17] Earth here it it was without form and
[1:12:20] void and God begins to speak do you
[1:12:21] realize when God spoke the world was
[1:12:23] created by the spoken word and God be to
[1:12:26] speak and as he would say let this seed
[1:12:29] bring forth and let this seed bring
[1:12:30] forth and bear this such fruit and as he
[1:12:33] began to speak he said let every seed
[1:12:35] bring forth of its old kind and brother
[1:12:37] Mark you know what happened is that
[1:12:39] every seed that God made had to grow
[1:12:42] isn't that something there wasn't no
[1:12:43] messed up seeds there wasn't something
[1:12:46] that didn't have us tampering around
[1:12:48] with seeds is what causes have a certain
[1:12:50] yield that don't come forth right but
[1:12:52] when God made seeds they everyone came
[1:12:54] forth why because they were created by
[1:12:56] the spoken word of God you think about
[1:12:59] when this natural seed that God made and
[1:13:02] this natural seed God had made it the
[1:13:03] Bible said and then he divided the Earth
[1:13:05] from the waters and then he said let
[1:13:07] there be light God made everything that
[1:13:09] was needed for the seed to grow and then
[1:13:11] he made he said let dry land appear and
[1:13:13] then God what he did is he made a
[1:13:15] bedding ground to place that seed in and
[1:13:17] all the things that God had created by
[1:13:19] his spoken word they came together
[1:13:22] around that bedding ground that God had
[1:13:23] made and he placed the seed in that
[1:13:25] ground brother marah and by his word
[1:13:27] that was seed by the water that was that
[1:13:30] was word and by by the light that was
[1:13:32] word that seed be to grow in the ground
[1:13:34] and it brought forth the very thing that
[1:13:36] God had thought in his mind there had
[1:13:38] never been an apple tree there had never
[1:13:39] been a pecan tree nobody could say it
[1:13:41] was right or but but it matched the
[1:13:43] image that God had in his mind he wanted
[1:13:46] to see him come to pass so he he made
[1:13:48] the seed he made the water he made the
[1:13:50] LIE then he made a bedding ground for it
[1:13:52] to come forth in so you see that but but
[1:13:55] as God does this you notice that that
[1:13:57] that that the natural life it all came
[1:13:59] by seed but if Natural Life come by seed
[1:14:03] wellin spiritual life how you think it
[1:14:04] comes it's going to come by seed too
[1:14:07] that's what Jesus said he said the word
[1:14:09] is seed you think about it John one I
[1:14:11] may as well just preach it John said in
[1:14:13] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:14:15] was with God and the Word was God in the
[1:14:18] 14th verse he comes in see notice he
[1:14:20] tells us this the word is here but what
[1:14:22] the word needed is it needed a betting
[1:14:25] ground for it to grow he could have said
[1:14:27] in the beginning was a seed in the
[1:14:29] beginning was the light in the beginning
[1:14:30] was the water in the beginning was
[1:14:32] everything that God needed but what God
[1:14:34] needed was a beding ground that he could
[1:14:36] place that seed in that it could come
[1:14:38] forth and manifest the very image that
[1:14:40] God had in his mind so the Bible says
[1:14:42] that God in the or John says that God
[1:14:45] came down in the 14th verse he said he
[1:14:47] was made flesh and he dwelt Among Us
[1:14:50] that very word what did he do he he came
[1:14:52] and he found a little uh one young lady
[1:14:56] by the name of Mary that came in contact
[1:14:58] with an angel of the Lord and God took
[1:15:00] that seed that that God had made which
[1:15:02] was his own word and he put it down in
[1:15:05] the womb of a woman and planted it in
[1:15:06] her that she would be able to bring I
[1:15:08] thought my God isn't this something that
[1:15:10] God would have a bedding ground Not only
[1:15:12] was he the seed Not only was it the
[1:15:14] water Not only was it the lie but it was
[1:15:16] God that prepared a ground that he could
[1:15:18] put that seed in that it would manifest
[1:15:20] the very thing that God had in the back
[1:15:22] part of his mind and the Bible says and
[1:15:25] the Word was made flesh and he dwelt
[1:15:28] among us all this word and prophecy and
[1:15:30] preaching see it has to have a place to
[1:15:33] be manifested all the things that God
[1:15:35] has said see in this it do matter what
[1:15:38] promise God made it has to have a
[1:15:40] bedding ground to be manifested in so in
[1:15:42] this womb the seed was placed the word
[1:15:45] was made flesh he was the manifestation
[1:15:47] of what God was the Bible would even say
[1:15:50] he was the image of an invisible God I
[1:15:54] isn't it isn't it something and then
[1:15:56] when Jesus would come he'd say I say
[1:15:58] unto you except a corn of wheat would
[1:16:01] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[1:16:02] alone but if it die it'll bring forth
[1:16:04] much fruit so he teaches us this
[1:16:07] principle that a seed must be planted to
[1:16:10] manifest so it started as a seed in the
[1:16:13] days of Jesus the gospel was planted
[1:16:14] into a tomb he went in a tomb he he
[1:16:17] resurrected on the third day he came
[1:16:19] back forth on Easter morning he ascended
[1:16:21] into Glory he came back in the form of
[1:16:23] the Holy Ghost the power came that to
[1:16:25] those they went out boldly preaching the
[1:16:26] gospel you realize that this prophecy
[1:16:29] that that it would be preached in every
[1:16:30] nation beginning at Jerusalem so here
[1:16:33] God he would plant this in Jerusalem but
[1:16:35] when it came up and brother Mah and he
[1:16:37] ascended into glory and the spirit of
[1:16:39] God fell upon on them they had the power
[1:16:41] of God on their life and the very thing
[1:16:43] that he planted in Jerusalem Advanced
[1:16:45] into all the world he didn't mean for it
[1:16:48] to just remain there he meant for it to
[1:16:50] move he meant for it to go out into
[1:16:52] every nation into somebody to spread the
[1:16:54] gospel let me tell your friends it's a
[1:16:56] living gospel it's moving around the
[1:16:58] world it's been carried by anointed men
[1:17:00] and women that are telling the testimony
[1:17:02] of Jesus Christ and the life of Christ
[1:17:05] and they're living a life and witnessing
[1:17:07] to others what is it it's the
[1:17:08] advancement of the word of God and it's
[1:17:11] moving around the
[1:17:13] world and somewhere along the way as the
[1:17:17] word is advancing throughout the Earth
[1:17:20] it gets deluded by men along the way it
[1:17:24] gets deluded Ed by theologies and
[1:17:26] thinkings and and men that would that
[1:17:29] weren't annointed brother Mark that well
[1:17:31] we'll just kind of keep things this way
[1:17:32] it makes a little easier and so and so
[1:17:33] they're more comfortable coming to
[1:17:35] church if you don't talk about those
[1:17:36] things and you know then then we'll have
[1:17:37] we'll have some better fellowship and
[1:17:39] after all she makes fried chicken and my
[1:17:40] if we got rid of her we wouldn't have no
[1:17:42] more chicken so they begin to make all
[1:17:44] for whatever reasons but men make up
[1:17:47] reasons but it got deluded and the power
[1:17:51] of what was being spoken and the power
[1:17:53] that was poured out on the day of
[1:17:54] Pentecost
[1:17:55] then the then it lost its effect in the
[1:17:57] church and you notice and through but
[1:18:00] but through all this and as it began to
[1:18:02] go all these different ways if you could
[1:18:03] just look at the big picture all these
[1:18:05] different ways but there's still this
[1:18:07] this true seed that's going through all
[1:18:09] this it may have just been a small
[1:18:10] number and there was times when it was
[1:18:11] such a a small number it looked like
[1:18:13] there wasn't none at all and then Into
[1:18:15] the Dark Ages you notice that that they
[1:18:17] were they were crucified and martyred
[1:18:19] and and and put to death for for for
[1:18:22] standing for Jesus Christ and they were
[1:18:24] they were buried and you say well what
[1:18:26] was it it was the burial of a seed that
[1:18:28] would soon come back and grow into its
[1:18:30] full maturity but said see it had to die
[1:18:33] through those Dark Ages just like any
[1:18:34] other corn of wheat it has to go beneath
[1:18:36] the Earth and be buried to bring forth
[1:18:38] in the First Reformation them two blades
[1:18:40] of Luther the stalk and Wesley the the
[1:18:42] tassel the great missionary age it had
[1:18:44] to come forth in the Pentecostal for the
[1:18:46] restoration of gifts almost to deceive
[1:18:48] the very elected it looks like a wheat
[1:18:51] grain open it up but there's no wheat at
[1:18:52] all it's only a Shook and now in 1965 he
[1:18:56] makes this statement he said but now
[1:18:58] it's beginning to pull away and the
[1:19:00] wheat is beginning to be seen my isn't
[1:19:03] that
[1:19:04] good is there some Believers in here
[1:19:06] that heard that he said it's beginning
[1:19:09] to pull away and the wheat is beginning
[1:19:11] to be seen think about this that went
[1:19:13] into the ground the seed that went into
[1:19:15] the ground and as it begin to come forth
[1:19:18] he said see this is not the Pentecostal
[1:19:21] age this is the latterday age this is
[1:19:23] the bride age this this is the evening
[1:19:25] life where Malachi 4 must be fulfilled
[1:19:27] to follow God's pattern what is it it's
[1:19:30] the advancement of the word of God you
[1:19:33] think about it it's moving I maybe some
[1:19:35] of you aren't familiar with the
[1:19:36] terminology but this word is moving but
[1:19:39] Mark it's growing here the church has
[1:19:41] grown into this age and making
[1:19:42] preparation for a Rapture you see you
[1:19:44] see what took place the first corn of
[1:19:46] wheat which was the bridegroom it was
[1:19:47] Jesus he went into the ground he had to
[1:19:50] fall into the Earth in order to rise
[1:19:52] again he said so if the bridegroom had
[1:19:54] to do within the bride done it also she
[1:19:56] was that was born at Pentecost she went
[1:19:58] through the Dark Ages just like any
[1:20:00] other seed she was buried and had to die
[1:20:03] they must do it but what it did is it
[1:20:05] started something and they sprouted out
[1:20:08] again in Luther's age in the Reformation
[1:20:10] what you realize that what caused the
[1:20:13] Reformation was was the martyrs that had
[1:20:16] went down in the Dark Ages what caused
[1:20:18] those men to be so bold to be able to
[1:20:20] stand upon the word of God what gave
[1:20:22] them so much courage what caused them to
[1:20:24] come out their houses and say say I'm
[1:20:26] going to stand on the word of God it was
[1:20:28] because of the those that were martyred
[1:20:30] and those that were slain for the name
[1:20:32] of Jesus Christ you let one man be Marty
[1:20:34] for the name it would raise up a Revolt
[1:20:36] of men that would save for the life of
[1:20:38] him that innocent blood that you spill
[1:20:40] it's what it's what caused them to rise
[1:20:42] up it was a seed that went into the
[1:20:44] ground and that seed that went into the
[1:20:46] ground it gave life in the days of
[1:20:48] Martin Luther for them to come out of
[1:20:50] the ground and to stand against a Roman
[1:20:52] Catholic church and to say that ain't
[1:20:53] the truth but God God's word is true and
[1:20:55] we're going to go back to the Bible and
[1:20:57] we're going to make sure it's in a
[1:20:58] language that everybody can read it and
[1:21:00] we ain't going to come down to a
[1:21:01] confession Booth to confess to some men
[1:21:03] are false but we're going to go to Jesus
[1:21:05] Christ because you ain't our intercessor
[1:21:07] Christ is our
[1:21:09] intercessor it gave them the courage to
[1:21:11] be able to stand upon the word of God
[1:21:14] and they grew up through that that stalk
[1:21:16] and it went into a to a tasel y can turn
[1:21:18] that down if it's hurting the babies but
[1:21:19] went into a tassel in in the age of
[1:21:22] Wesley in the age of Pentecost it came
[1:21:24] back all the way into this almost in
[1:21:26] this age of maturity you look out in a
[1:21:28] wheat field and brother Mark you know
[1:21:29] what you see it looks just like wheat
[1:21:32] even when the seed has already came out
[1:21:34] of it but notice this but you open it up
[1:21:37] and the seed is not there see that every
[1:21:39] one of them had a purpose God used them
[1:21:42] to fulfill his purpose they were
[1:21:44] carriers of the life you say cuz you
[1:21:47] know many ask this question how could it
[1:21:50] ever be of God if it ain't no more God
[1:21:51] used it to carry the life forward but
[1:21:55] then we come into this age to see the
[1:21:57] the bride had to go born at Pentecost
[1:21:58] had to go through the Dark Ages just
[1:22:00] like any other seed and be buried they
[1:22:02] had to die but it sprouted again in
[1:22:04] Luther in the First Reformation it
[1:22:06] didn't look like the seed that went in
[1:22:08] but it was the light of that day and the
[1:22:10] stalk then went to tassel and West Sea
[1:22:12] and the tassel and the Pentecost the
[1:22:13] Shook and the life continues on you
[1:22:15] realize this and now the Shu has pulled
[1:22:18] away and the wheat to give the wheat a
[1:22:21] chance to lay before the sun to ripen
[1:22:23] you want to know where we are today the
[1:22:25] message coming right back into the
[1:22:27] church again forming the body of Jesus
[1:22:29] Christ just like the first original one
[1:22:32] that went into the ground this is what
[1:22:34] the Bible had prophesied that there
[1:22:36] would come a church in the last days
[1:22:38] brother Mark that'd be the same church
[1:22:40] that it was on the day of Pentecost
[1:22:42] there'd be a church in the last days
[1:22:43] that would that would come forth that
[1:22:45] would manifest the very life of Jesus
[1:22:48] Christ same church same work same God
[1:22:52] doing the same works today that he done
[1:22:54] back
[1:22:56] then think about it the message coming
[1:22:58] into the church he said the shuck is
[1:23:00] pulled away give the weed a chance to
[1:23:02] lay before the sun I hope you're hearing
[1:23:05] me to ripen the message coming right
[1:23:09] back into the church again forming the
[1:23:11] body of Jesus Christ just like the
[1:23:12] original one that went into the ground
[1:23:14] isn't that something the message coming
[1:23:16] into the church again I'll tell you what
[1:23:18] you know why this goes over most
[1:23:20] people's head because they don't hear
[1:23:21] the
[1:23:21] message said but the message has to come
[1:23:24] into the church chur again in order for
[1:23:25] the church to manifest the same life
[1:23:27] that it had before so when the message
[1:23:29] comes into the church it'll have life
[1:23:32] when the message comes to a church it'll
[1:23:34] have true worship when the message comes
[1:23:36] to the church it'll heal the sick and
[1:23:38] let me tell you friends it'll do the
[1:23:39] same thing to every individual it'll
[1:23:41] take a dried up old believer halfway
[1:23:43] church member 25 years old be going to
[1:23:45] church cuz your daddy made you your
[1:23:47] whole life but then one day you'll get a
[1:23:48] hold of something and get a revelation
[1:23:50] of who God is and the message of the
[1:23:52] hour will strick your heart and you
[1:23:53] don't go to Church to be known it ain't
[1:23:55] no social party anymore it ain't show
[1:23:57] off baby clothes or show off this or
[1:23:59] that but it's because there's something
[1:24:00] on the inside of you that has a burning
[1:24:02] desire to manifest the life of Jesus
[1:24:05] Christ it'll take every critical spirit
[1:24:07] away from you every Spirit of hypocrisy
[1:24:10] away from you it'll cause you to be a
[1:24:11] real believer and want to come to the
[1:24:13] house of God you'll come in shouting
[1:24:15] you'll come in praying you'll come in
[1:24:17] with the things of the world off your
[1:24:18] mind cuz there's something in your heart
[1:24:20] that wants to get back to God and be
[1:24:22] what God has called you to be something
[1:24:24] in the Bride of Jesus Christ that causes
[1:24:27] her to want to manifest the purpose of
[1:24:29] God I don't want to be a church member I
[1:24:32] want to manifest the purpose of God I
[1:24:34] don't want to be a benchwarmer I want to
[1:24:36] manifest the purpose of God I want the
[1:24:38] life of Jesus Christ to be manifested in
[1:24:42] me that's what a Believer wants that's
[1:24:45] the desire of our heart when the message
[1:24:47] comes into your life it'll heal the sick
[1:24:49] when the message comes in it'll it'll
[1:24:51] it'll take it'll deliver you of all the
[1:24:53] spiritual things it'll set free the
[1:24:55] captives it'll men broken homes it'll
[1:24:57] restore your relationship back between
[1:24:59] you and
[1:25:00] God it'll take families that are torn
[1:25:03] apart you know what they need they need
[1:25:05] the message of God why why are they in
[1:25:08] such a rate they need the message of the
[1:25:10] hour to hear what God is speaking in
[1:25:12] this age but Mark it's the only thing
[1:25:15] that that can come that can restore us
[1:25:17] back that was the purpose of the message
[1:25:19] was to turn our hearts back to the
[1:25:22] original faith I don't know about y'all
[1:25:25] it makes me want to
[1:25:26] shout see the church World failed to see
[1:25:28] the advancement of the word of God see
[1:25:32] but as Moses called out a nation Christ
[1:25:34] today is calling a church he called a
[1:25:35] nation out of a Nation Christ is calling
[1:25:37] a church out of a church the same thing
[1:25:40] in type taking them into a glorious
[1:25:42] Eternal promised land now to refuse the
[1:25:45] person that's doing the calling which is
[1:25:47] actually Christ see we look behind the
[1:25:49] pull pit and we see the man he said but
[1:25:53] to refuse the person that's doing the
[1:25:55] calling which is Christ no matter if
[1:25:57] you're Pentecostal Methodist Luther
[1:25:59] whatever you are in this age you have to
[1:26:02] accept just like they did in that age
[1:26:04] you have to accept the person of Christ
[1:26:06] which is the word see so when the word
[1:26:09] Goes Forth here God he don't give us an
[1:26:10] option let me tell you you say brother
[1:26:12] man why don't God give me an option
[1:26:13] because God is going to fulfill his
[1:26:16] purpose so you know what he does he put
[1:26:18] something in you that causes you to be
[1:26:20] able to accept the word of God he put
[1:26:22] something in you even when it hurts and
[1:26:24] sometimes sometimes it it just feels
[1:26:26] like a knockout punch sometimes it feels
[1:26:27] like the preacher stepping all over your
[1:26:29] toe sometimes you're feeling like you're
[1:26:30] getting beat with a whip you feel like
[1:26:32] they felt when Jesus went into the
[1:26:33] temple beating out the money changers
[1:26:35] sometimes we feel that way said but the
[1:26:38] purpose of it is is that God is going to
[1:26:41] make sure that you carry out his purpose
[1:26:44] so see you have to accept it which is
[1:26:46] the word so you see what the plan of
[1:26:48] Satan is in this age this the plan of
[1:26:51] Satan is to stop the word of God from
[1:26:53] advancing and I already out a time is to
[1:26:55] stop the word of God from advancing from
[1:26:58] moving forward so what he does brother
[1:27:00] Mark is he puts up scarecrows in front
[1:27:01] of everybody and everybody has different
[1:27:04] ones he put scarecrows in front of you
[1:27:06] to keep you from being able to go any
[1:27:08] further with God so whatever that is it
[1:27:11] may you would put them and say well you
[1:27:13] can't go you can't go past this and you
[1:27:15] know sometimes I think about it every
[1:27:17] one of us is different but if you if you
[1:27:18] just think about that tonight what
[1:27:20] Scarrow has Satan put in front of you
[1:27:24] to keep you from advancing in the word
[1:27:27] of God what scarecrow does he put on
[1:27:30] your road is it well you know I've
[1:27:31] already been to to this church and they
[1:27:33] did me wrong they hurt my feelings so I
[1:27:35] can't put my confidence in people
[1:27:36] because the last time I put my
[1:27:37] confidence in somebody they all let me
[1:27:39] down so I can't really trust nobody and
[1:27:41] I gotta got see it's a scarecrow that
[1:27:43] keeps you from fulfilling the fruits of
[1:27:45] the spirit I want to love everybody but
[1:27:46] I can't really love everybody because
[1:27:48] after all you know last time I I opened
[1:27:50] up my heart and I did for them then they
[1:27:51] hurt my feelings and did didn't have
[1:27:52] nothing to do with me back and and
[1:27:53] matter fact I wouldn't try to shake
[1:27:55] their hand they wouldn't even shake my
[1:27:56] it's a
[1:27:57] scarecrow he puts in the church I'm too
[1:28:00] little I'm too big I'm a girl I'm a guy
[1:28:06] I can't
[1:28:07] pray whatever I'm I'm not smart enough
[1:28:11] whatever scarecrow that Satan puts in
[1:28:12] front of you that you can't go any
[1:28:14] further with God I've had family
[1:28:16] problems I've had I've had I've had
[1:28:19] husband issues wife issues children
[1:28:21] issues Church problems they're
[1:28:23] scarecrows to keep you from advancing in
[1:28:26] the word of God you think about it the
[1:28:29] scarecrows that he puts in the church so
[1:28:31] many times you would tell you I know
[1:28:33] this because I'm a pastor and I talk to
[1:28:34] a lot of people that don't go to church
[1:28:36] and I always get the same answers it's
[1:28:38] the oddest thing it tells you it's a
[1:28:40] devil it's the oddest thing they say the
[1:28:42] same things I know they don't talk they
[1:28:44] don't even know each other but they'll
[1:28:45] tell you the same thing well you know
[1:28:47] what I I was going to church and I was
[1:28:49] doing good for a while but you know man
[1:28:50] there's so many Hypocrites in there I've
[1:28:52] seen that one sister down there and you
[1:28:53] you seen what she wrote on Facebook and
[1:28:55] then she comes over and raises her hand
[1:28:57] act like she's just a Christian then she
[1:28:58] goes off posting this stuff and why
[1:29:00] there ain't no Christian in her so she's
[1:29:02] a hypocrite I'm GNA be Pastor mad a
[1:29:06] minute I don't know when's the last time
[1:29:08] y'all went to Walmart but I'm never
[1:29:10] going back to
[1:29:11] Walmart because there's so many
[1:29:13] Hypocrites in there I can't find the
[1:29:15] food out I can't Wade through the
[1:29:17] critics in Walmart to be able to find
[1:29:20] the the Chili Cheese Fritos
[1:29:24] on Isle N I can't get through them
[1:29:25] there's too many Hypocrites you you you
[1:29:28] hear what I'm saying there's so many
[1:29:30] there's there's so many Fanatics in
[1:29:32] Walmart that I can't even go to Walmart
[1:29:35] there there's so many there's so many
[1:29:37] impersonators in Walmart they act like
[1:29:39] they're they're big shots they act like
[1:29:41] they got money they put on fancy clothes
[1:29:42] and they put carry fancy wallets they
[1:29:44] spray on perfume act like there's
[1:29:46] somebody really ain't got two nickels
[1:29:47] rubbed together they're impersonating
[1:29:49] somebody else there's impersonators they
[1:29:51] filled up the whole aisles of Walmart I
[1:29:53] can never go back
[1:29:55] think about it everywhere you go it's
[1:29:58] the same thing but that ain't the real
[1:30:00] reason I'm not an impersonator brother
[1:30:03] man said it shouldn't make you not want
[1:30:05] to go to church or not want to serve god
[1:30:07] this is my own words but it ought to
[1:30:08] make you want to serve God because if
[1:30:10] there's somebody impersonating something
[1:30:11] they're impersonating because there's a
[1:30:13] real somewhere so you know what I don't
[1:30:15] have to be put out by the impersonator
[1:30:18] what I want to do is become the real
[1:30:20] that I might win the impersonator and
[1:30:22] cause the make believer to want to be a
[1:30:24] real
[1:30:25] believer that's just pastor Matt
[1:30:28] tonight scarecrows that keep him from
[1:30:31] advancing that's what goliath was when
[1:30:33] he stood before the children of Israel
[1:30:35] down in the valley here they were up on
[1:30:36] a mountain they couldn't even go and do
[1:30:38] their own they couldn't even do their
[1:30:39] own march to their own land because he
[1:30:40] was SC he was a scarecrow that kept them
[1:30:43] from advancing never fired a shot never
[1:30:45] swung a sword he sat down there and run
[1:30:47] his big mouth and every one of them
[1:30:48] stayed where they were because a
[1:30:49] scarecrow kept them from advancing but
[1:30:51] you know what it took it took a man that
[1:30:54] young boy that came down there and saw
[1:30:55] what was going on and he said you know
[1:30:57] what I may not know a whole lot but I
[1:30:59] know one thing God's Church deserves
[1:31:01] better than this I know one thing God's
[1:31:03] children deserve better than this
[1:31:05] there's promises in this word that
[1:31:06] you're not living up to there's things
[1:31:08] that God has promised you that you're
[1:31:10] not taking advantage of there's
[1:31:11] blessings in God's word that they're not
[1:31:13] upon your life because you're you're
[1:31:15] hiding from you're allowing the Devil
[1:31:16] get in between you and God you want to
[1:31:18] be a real Christian and you want to be a
[1:31:20] real believer and you want to be a Son
[1:31:21] of God and you want to raise your you
[1:31:23] want to raise your your children and to
[1:31:24] be able to not be you want it to be
[1:31:26] effortless that you can just be a real
[1:31:28] soldier in the army of God and there's
[1:31:30] scarecrows that are standing in your way
[1:31:32] but I thank God that God would anoint a
[1:31:34] man named David you know what he did
[1:31:36] Brother Morgan he went down to a stream
[1:31:38] he said it may not take much he took
[1:31:40] five Stones which was F AI T he stood in
[1:31:43] the face of a giant he said how dare you
[1:31:45] defy the armies of the Living God I
[1:31:48] think that's what we need today we need
[1:31:50] some anointed men and women and anointed
[1:31:52] mamas and daddies and grandmas and
[1:31:54] grandpas they'll stand the old Scarecrow
[1:31:57] in the eye and say how dare you defy the
[1:31:59] children of the Living God we're living
[1:32:02] under the Covenant that God has given
[1:32:04] unto us you're standing Upon Our Land
[1:32:06] now get out of the way and let God have
[1:32:08] his way how will God bring his purpose
[1:32:11] to pass brother Mark he'll raise up
[1:32:12] somebody to be able to move forward
[1:32:15] he'll raise up somebody to advance his
[1:32:17] word he'll never let it lay stagnant
[1:32:19] he'll never let it go backward God don't
[1:32:22] have a retreat in his army but got to
[1:32:24] raise up somebody that'll go forward in
[1:32:26] the word of God the rest of the churches
[1:32:29] they Oh Glory they may not like it but
[1:32:32] God will raise up somebody that'll go
[1:32:34] forward in the word God will raise up
[1:32:36] somebody that'll take this message that
[1:32:38] God has sent and they'll elevated over
[1:32:40] the people of God and they'll move
[1:32:42] forward in the word of
[1:32:44] God why he said you cuz God's purpose is
[1:32:47] going to be fulfilled that's what we
[1:32:49] need it takes an anointed man to be able
[1:32:51] to stand up before God butam said God is
[1:32:53] training for this great battle the Bible
[1:32:55] says we're living in a time when culture
[1:32:57] and education has smothered over the
[1:32:59] word of God it's got into reasoning the
[1:33:01] Battle Is Now who will
[1:33:04] stand the battle is now but who will
[1:33:08] stand the battle is in Array look what
[1:33:11] opposition that we have great
[1:33:13] denominations telling people the days of
[1:33:15] Miracles has
[1:33:17] passed all that stuff that's just for
[1:33:19] the disciples I've heard it I've talked
[1:33:21] to them all sit down with my faor my
[1:33:24] favorite Baptist saying is the law and
[1:33:26] the prophets was until John I love it
[1:33:29] you know what they mean by that well
[1:33:30] there was no Prophet that would come
[1:33:31] into the world after John the Baptist I
[1:33:34] thought how a foolish statement when
[1:33:35] you're so wise didn't even know Jesus
[1:33:37] was a
[1:33:38] prophet who was born after John the
[1:33:40] Baptist so wise that you didn't know
[1:33:42] Jesus was a prophet or John the
[1:33:45] Revelator or or or the Bible said agabus
[1:33:48] was a prophet book of Acts he was a
[1:33:51] prophet you know what I asked a lady she
[1:33:53] told with that one time brother Tom she
[1:33:54] said the law and the prophets was until
[1:33:56] John so after after John I said after
[1:33:59] John what there W there waser no
[1:34:00] prophets I said well so let me ask you
[1:34:03] if the law I wasn't going to get into
[1:34:04] this but you can have it for free if the
[1:34:06] law and the prophets were until John and
[1:34:08] that means there's no more prophets that
[1:34:10] means there's no more law are you with
[1:34:13] me so if you want your neighbor's
[1:34:17] wife if you want to
[1:34:19] steal if you want to cheat and lie well
[1:34:22] all that came from the law of
[1:34:24] Moses God never done away with it but if
[1:34:28] it has to stop at John well then why are
[1:34:30] we carrying it
[1:34:31] forward you see because that's not what
[1:34:34] the scripture even was meaning but the
[1:34:36] rest of the scripture said but the
[1:34:37] Kingdom of Heaven here we are in another
[1:34:40] in this Messianic kingdom and there's
[1:34:43] still prophecy there's still the
[1:34:45] five-fold ministry Paul told us that he
[1:34:47] said the apostles prophets teachers
[1:34:49] evangelists Pastors in the five-fold
[1:34:51] ministry in the kingdom of God the
[1:34:53] spirit spiritual Kingdom that we're in
[1:34:55] today so still the great gifts of God
[1:34:59] and Jesus said I didn't come to do away
[1:35:00] with the law I came to fulfill it and
[1:35:02] then he gave another one love one
[1:35:04] another he didn't do away with them he
[1:35:06] didn't say run off and do away with
[1:35:07] everything that's ever been taught no he
[1:35:09] built on
[1:35:11] it amen and gave you the by his grace
[1:35:14] the ability to be able to live it that's
[1:35:16] just the way I believe it he said the
[1:35:19] battle is ready to go she's in Array now
[1:35:22] what great opposition that we have
[1:35:24] but who will be like David that would
[1:35:27] stand against that old Philistine and
[1:35:30] say I'll go fight him God wants men and
[1:35:33] women this morning who can raise up and
[1:35:34] say I'll take the Lord at his word No
[1:35:36] Matter What fail this one fail or that
[1:35:38] one you saws all this forth you go
[1:35:40] you're afraid of him well you just get
[1:35:41] back where you belong but let the Davids
[1:35:43] move forward if the saws want to get out
[1:35:45] of the way and they don't want to handle
[1:35:46] it let the saws get out of the way but
[1:35:48] let the Davids go on he said because
[1:35:49] God's Army is marching forward Men of
[1:35:52] Valor men of Faith men of power men of
[1:35:56] understanding you say I'm not smart
[1:35:58] enough I don't know enough I'm not big
[1:35:59] enough I'm not old enough well let me
[1:36:01] tell your friends he said you don't have
[1:36:03] to be smart they don't have to be
[1:36:04] educated they just have to be channels
[1:36:07] that God can work through in order for
[1:36:10] God to use you you don't have to be a
[1:36:11] great man you have to be a willing
[1:36:13] channel that God can work through isn't
[1:36:15] that good you have to be I'm let the
[1:36:17] music players come I've already lost you
[1:36:19] you have to be a willing channel that
[1:36:21] God can work through how can he work
[1:36:24] this day I wonder if I ask this today
[1:36:26] how many how many willing channels do we
[1:36:28] have won't you stand to your feet how
[1:36:30] many willing channels that are willing
[1:36:33] that that they're willing to manifest
[1:36:34] the word of God you say well how how
[1:36:36] will I do it well let me tell you how
[1:36:37] you do it when the word comes you don't
[1:36:41] stop it up you let it flow through you
[1:36:43] that's a channel see a a channel it
[1:36:46] don't stop things a channel is free
[1:36:49] flowing it allows water you take an old
[1:36:51] water Channel it allows water to go
[1:36:52] through it say see and when it comes
[1:36:55] through you when it flows through you
[1:36:58] here's a message in itself then it comes
[1:37:00] out with great
[1:37:02] power think about the word that goes
[1:37:04] forth out of my mouth just like when you
[1:37:07] come into a church service brother
[1:37:09] Travis you when you realize when you sit
[1:37:11] in this assembly that you have two
[1:37:14] choices you can be a roadblock or you
[1:37:16] can be a
[1:37:17] channel every one of you me too when I
[1:37:20] sit here you can be a roadblock or you
[1:37:23] can be a channel that God can work
[1:37:24] through you say brother may how am I one
[1:37:26] or the other because when the word of
[1:37:28] God is preached you could say or or even
[1:37:31] somebody comes up to sing a song well
[1:37:33] that's the wrong song I don't want to
[1:37:34] hear her sing that song She's terrible
[1:37:36] at that song it's not a channel it's a
[1:37:39] roadblock but why is she sing it again
[1:37:40] she sang last Sunday that's not a
[1:37:42] channel it's
[1:37:43] roadblock why is he preaching didn't he
[1:37:45] preach two weeks ago somebody get the
[1:37:47] calendar out see I mean it's not a
[1:37:49] channel it's a
[1:37:51] roadblock he said but we have to be a
[1:37:53] channel
[1:37:55] you realize that God God knows things we
[1:37:58] don't
[1:37:59] know great power he's moving in ways
[1:38:01] that we don't understand he knows he
[1:38:03] knows every he knows what to put you
[1:38:05] through in order to make you what he
[1:38:06] wants you to be sometimes he'll put you
[1:38:09] through things you don't like and it
[1:38:11] hurts every minute of it but if you
[1:38:14] could see the end of the road say but
[1:38:16] God is doing something
[1:38:18] here he's doing something to me he's
[1:38:21] molding my character he's making he's
[1:38:23] trying to take this old nature that is
[1:38:26] handed down from family members and
[1:38:28] daddies and momas he's trying to take
[1:38:29] that old nature out of me and put a
[1:38:30] different kind of Nature and then it'll
[1:38:33] all get
[1:38:34] better isn't it something how that you
[1:38:37] know when a roadblock comes I'm just
[1:38:39] just speaking what the Lord putting on
[1:38:41] my heart but when a roadblock comes you
[1:38:44] can't get nothing out of a
[1:38:46] service you can't you can't come to
[1:38:48] church you can't you can't get nothing
[1:38:49] out of it everything's wrong they're too
[1:38:52] loud this one's too quiet they clap this
[1:38:54] wrong everything's all messed
[1:38:56] up but if you ever get in the right
[1:38:58] channel then none of that ever matters
[1:38:59] you ever noticed that so when you get a
[1:39:02] person that says well I'll I'll just be
[1:39:04] a channel that God can work through and
[1:39:06] then you'll get one over in front of
[1:39:08] them and and and that that they'll just
[1:39:10] start worshiping the Lord say you know
[1:39:11] what Lord let me just be a channel I I
[1:39:13] don't want to get my spirit all tore up
[1:39:14] and be a roadblock let me be a channel
[1:39:16] and they just start praise the Lord Lord
[1:39:18] I Thank you for for coming tonight Lord
[1:39:20] I Thank you for allowing me to to have a
[1:39:22] vehicle to be able to get to church
[1:39:23] Lord I Thank you for my health I thank
[1:39:25] you for allowing me to have the hands to
[1:39:26] be able to raise to you Lord I I thank
[1:39:28] you for giving me a voice that I could
[1:39:30] speak to you Lord I Thank you for
[1:39:31] allowing me to SP sing Lord I Thank you
[1:39:33] for my children and you just become a
[1:39:35] channel and all that God's given you you
[1:39:37] don't you don't just bottle it up but
[1:39:39] you give it back to the Lord you begin
[1:39:41] to Worship the Lord and you know what
[1:39:43] happens is you enter into an atmosphere
[1:39:45] and that atmosphere it don't just stay
[1:39:47] right where you are but from where you
[1:39:49] are it be it'll move out why because he
[1:39:52] always advances
[1:39:54] God never pours himself into something
[1:39:56] that won't pour out he pours himself
[1:39:58] into things that will allow to be to be
[1:40:00] poured out that's why God wants vessels
[1:40:02] that are flowing he wants people that
[1:40:04] are moving he want he wants churches you
[1:40:05] want to see a church blessed you start
[1:40:07] doing missionary work and supporting
[1:40:09] missionaries why is why is God to grow
[1:40:11] the church in such a way because it's a
[1:40:13] channel that God can work through you
[1:40:15] take a person that never that never done
[1:40:17] anything they hold on to all their money
[1:40:19] and they they'll never it just seems
[1:40:20] like they never grow in any way and then
[1:40:22] that same person they'll start
[1:40:23] supporting the church and supporting
[1:40:25] missionaries and and trying to help the
[1:40:26] work of the Lord and everything around
[1:40:28] their household will change their bills
[1:40:30] will change their pay they get pay
[1:40:32] raises their cars La their tires last
[1:40:34] longer on their cars they're putting
[1:40:35] 400,000 miles on
[1:40:38] Fords listen because they got into a
[1:40:42] channel where God could use
[1:40:44] them that's what we need to be in a
[1:40:46] channel where God could use us I love
[1:40:49] you brother
[1:40:51] Noah he's a good man
[1:40:53] but we want to be in the right channel
[1:40:56] allow God to use us say see when we get
[1:40:58] in the
[1:41:01] channel that's brother Market it just
[1:41:04] opens up the whole you how many just in
[1:41:06] a few minutes see the atmosphere in this
[1:41:09] building
[1:41:10] change it ain't it ain't from that
[1:41:13] music it's from a person it's from your
[1:41:16] heart opening up and saying Lord let me
[1:41:18] be a channel Lord let me let let let
[1:41:21] your spirit flow let let when the word
[1:41:23] word comes Lord and even when the
[1:41:25] preacher says something I don't like
[1:41:26] Lord let me say Amen you realize that
[1:41:28] when we amen the word of God what it
[1:41:31] does brother Jared whenever the word of
[1:41:33] God is spoke when we worship think about
[1:41:35] it we this is a church that that backs
[1:41:36] the word so I'm not preaching at you
[1:41:38] because you already do it but it's a
[1:41:40] church that backs the word they they
[1:41:42] like to say Amen don't let me sit right
[1:41:43] there sometimes I wish I had another me
[1:41:45] but I can't help I love to back the word
[1:41:47] of God why because I want that word that
[1:41:49] comes in me I want to be a channel for
[1:41:51] it I say Amen it means so be it I want
[1:41:53] to let it out why because we're pulling
[1:41:55] to create an atmosphere that a
[1:41:56] life-changing word can come forth and so
[1:41:59] here when you when you hear a word you
[1:42:01] say Amen you say so be it why it's a
[1:42:03] channel that God can flow through
[1:42:06] confirming his word that it can grow and
[1:42:09] the more you pull the more word comes
[1:42:11] the more word Comes The More You Pull
[1:42:13] and it begins to build an atmosphere in
[1:42:14] a building and an anointing comes around
[1:42:16] and all of a sudden all the things of
[1:42:18] this world don't matter anymore you say
[1:42:20] brother Matt you mean all that comes
[1:42:22] from just saying amen to the word of God
[1:42:25] I wish I could call her to the
[1:42:26] stand and ask sister Hattie right what
[1:42:29] it meant to say Amen to the word of God
[1:42:33] when everybody else would laugh at a
[1:42:34] testimony and make it a mockery but she
[1:42:36] said that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:42:39] and the angel of the Lord turned to her
[1:42:40] and said you tell her she can have
[1:42:41] anything that her Hearts Desire whatever
[1:42:44] she would say she'd have it and friends
[1:42:46] I'm here to tell you I'm declaring unto
[1:42:49] you if God is a god at all it didn't
[1:42:52] matter what that woman asked for God
[1:42:53] would have gave it to her if she have
[1:42:55] asked for a million dollars I believe
[1:42:57] with all my heart it had been stacked up
[1:42:58] on her on the top of her table you say
[1:43:01] well how would he had done it the same
[1:43:02] way that he done it with Peter when they
[1:43:03] went to pay their taxes and he said Lord
[1:43:05] how shall we pay he said go catch a fish
[1:43:07] and when you catch him in his mouth
[1:43:09] will'll be the Corin that we need to pay
[1:43:10] our taxes that same God he' have put it
[1:43:12] on her table because she said amen to
[1:43:15] the word of God all she did was say Amen
[1:43:19] you think she understood that why she
[1:43:20] didn't understand it but she said amen
[1:43:23] why because she believed God's word and
[1:43:25] something in her caused her to say Amen
[1:43:28] that the purpose of God might be
[1:43:29] fulfilled in her life let me tell you
[1:43:31] friends just say an amen it'll do
[1:43:33] something for you why because it's a law
[1:43:35] of God the Bible says when it goes for
[1:43:37] there has to be somebody to confirm it
[1:43:38] so here God would come in an assembly he
[1:43:40] would preach the word and the people
[1:43:42] said amen the oldest the oldest record
[1:43:45] we have in the Bible of an assembly was
[1:43:47] in the days of Nehemiah and the Bible
[1:43:49] said Ezra stood up on a pull pit of wood
[1:43:51] and they stood beside him and he open
[1:43:53] the Bible or the word of God and the
[1:43:55] people when he opened the word they all
[1:43:57] stood for the reading of the word that's
[1:43:59] why we do it today and when he began to
[1:44:01] read the word the Bible said after the
[1:44:03] word went forth they said amen and amen
[1:44:06] they lift their hands in the air they
[1:44:08] bowed their faces to the ground and they
[1:44:10] begin to worship God who told them to
[1:44:13] say Amen nobody said it who told them to
[1:44:16] raise their hand nobody told them they
[1:44:18] were channels that God could work
[1:44:21] through friends with the spirit of the
[1:44:22] Lord you say what's he looking for he's
[1:44:24] just looking for you to be a
[1:44:26] channel you say Amen well make me a
[1:44:29] channel it'll make you a channel the
[1:44:30] word of God it'll release the power you
[1:44:33] wonder why we have meetings and the
[1:44:35] power of God's movement it's because
[1:44:37] people come to church prayed up how come
[1:44:40] you can come in a meeting hear a
[1:44:41] wonderful preacher but the preacher
[1:44:44] ain't even started preaching yet the
[1:44:45] anointing is all over the building it's
[1:44:47] because people come to church they spend
[1:44:49] time praying all week for the service
[1:44:51] they make sacrifice for it they sit down
[1:44:53] on the bench they're praying they're
[1:44:54] worshiping the Lord the first words out
[1:44:56] of the preacher's mouth Amen brother
[1:44:58] amen praise the Lord and they're such an
[1:45:00] anointing in the building why it's
[1:45:03] because we're
[1:45:04] channels so I say Lord let me be
[1:45:08] that can you say that tonight I'm going
[1:45:10] to close can you say Lord let me just be
[1:45:12] a channel what's been wrong in my life
[1:45:15] it's
[1:45:16] scarecrows that put that brought you to
[1:45:18] a stopping place but brother Mark don't
[1:45:21] don't don't let it stop you just be a
[1:45:23] channel for the Lord so then when the
[1:45:25] word Goes Forth you watch what happens
[1:45:27] you realize that saying that saying Amen
[1:45:29] brother Mark it does something he said
[1:45:32] see there was a lady in in one of
[1:45:33] brother bram's meetings it was a Spanish
[1:45:35] lady she couldn't speak English but the
[1:45:37] spirit of the Lord began to move and
[1:45:39] they all moved the same way he pointed
[1:45:41] it out in the audience you can hear it
[1:45:42] on tape he said isn't it odd that they
[1:45:44] don't even know what I'm saying but the
[1:45:46] same reaction that y'all had is the same
[1:45:47] reaction they had showing that it was
[1:45:49] anointing of the Holy Ghost it was the
[1:45:52] Holy Spirit they were worshiping it
[1:45:53] wasn't a man they were worshiping they
[1:45:54] did before even before it was even
[1:45:56] interpreted they were already worshiping
[1:45:58] God and when he said that there was a
[1:45:59] lady in the congregation that said amen
[1:46:02] and he turned to him and he said why did
[1:46:04] you say amen for sitting right there he
[1:46:06] said do you believe that your sinus
[1:46:08] trouble is going to believe you you do
[1:46:10] well then stand to your feet it leaves

[1:46:15] audience of our peers that was sitting

[1:46:19] sitting there just because they would
[1:46:20] say Amen to the word of God something
[1:46:23] that God spoke and they said amen to it
[1:46:25] and it healed their body you know what
[1:46:27] it does m to think that God would do
[1:46:29] something for you just for backing the
[1:46:31] word of God that's what he's looking for
