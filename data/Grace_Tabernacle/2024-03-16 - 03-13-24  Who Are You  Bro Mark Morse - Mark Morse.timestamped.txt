[8:05] a great time in the Lord Sunday morning

[8:10] of those about here and there amen I
[8:14] just like to say thank you for allowing
[8:16] me to come and speak to you this evening
[8:20] we uh we'll do our best to present the
[8:23] word of God Amen that's what we're here
[8:25] for is to hear the word and you know
[8:27] sometimes preachers get up here and they
[8:29] need to hear the word too amen sometimes
[8:32] it comes just fresh and and new up here
[8:34] as it does out there amen that's just
[8:37] the presence of the Lord I appreciate
[8:39] the presence of the Lord tonight and
[8:42] appreciate him being with us won't you
[8:44] just give him a hand clap of praise
[8:48] tonight
[8:49] amen we
[8:52] got amen we've got a couple of different
[8:55] scriptures uh turn to Hebrews 11 we
[8:59] start at verse
[9:08] one
[9:11] amen says the Bible says in Hebrews 11
[9:14] it says now Faith is the substance of
[9:16] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[9:19] Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[9:23] good report through faith we understand
[9:26] that the worlds were framed by the word
[9:27] of God so that things which our are seen
[9:31] we're not made of things which do appear
[9:34] and you don't have to term that in
[9:35] Romans 10:1 17 the Bible says so then
[9:38] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[9:41] the word of God and in Acts 19 and 15
[9:45] Bible says and the evil spirit answered
[9:47] and said Jesus I know and Paul I know
[9:51] but who are ye amen if you just want to
[9:54] Bow your heads this evening Heavenly
[9:56] Father Lord we just thank you for all
[9:58] that you have done for us Lord we we
[9:59] thank you for the healing power Lord we
[10:01] thank you for your mercy we thank you
[10:03] for your grace Lord we thank you for
[10:05] your presence here tonight Lord we thank
[10:07] you for all that you have done for us
[10:09] and father we pray that we would move
[10:11] out of the way and just step into that
[10:13] atmosphere of God tonight Lord we're
[10:15] looking to hear from you that's our goal
[10:17] tonight is to hear from the Lord father
[10:19] we just thank you now in Jesus name we
[10:21] pray amen amen you can be seated I know
[10:24] that's a rather odd assortment of
[10:26] scriptures that we have this uh this
[10:29] evening amen but we'll get to it in a
[10:32] little bit amen so the Bible says that
[10:35] faith is the substance of things hoped
[10:36] for and the word faith is just simply
[10:39] means complete trust or confidence in
[10:43] someone or something now the word
[10:46] manifestation means an event action or
[10:50] object that clearly shows or embodies
[10:52] something especially a theory or an
[10:56] abstract idea I got to look in you know
[10:59] you think about that God when he was
[11:00] creating the Earth and and the world
[11:02] that when his word went out it was the
[11:04] faith of God that caused the Earth to be
[11:06] made it was that faith that he had
[11:08] inside of him he wasn't sitting up there
[11:10] worried about it he wasn't confused
[11:12] about it he wasn't he had what he was in
[11:14] his mind and that's what he spoke and
[11:16] when he spoke the Earth began to be made
[11:18] when he spoke the the the sun came forth
[11:21] when he spoke the stars came forth when
[11:23] he spoke the dry land appeared when he
[11:26] spoke Adam and or Adam come up out of
[11:28] the ground when God spoke that's what
[11:30] happened because he had his faith in his
[11:32] own word and I like to look at that I
[11:34] got to thinking about God's faith if you
[11:35] could ever have God's faith we might
[11:37] have our own faith in something
[11:39] sometimes but when you pick up on God's
[11:41] faith that changes everything things
[11:43] begin to start moving and things just
[11:45] begin to start changing when you get a
[11:47] hold of God's faith when God's faith
[11:49] comes down into you it changes the whole
[11:51] situation you could have you know
[11:53] something you've been praying for
[11:54] forever and you could have all the faith
[11:55] in the world but when God's faith steps
[11:57] down in there then you know that
[11:59] something's begin to change and we know
[12:01] that the creation was a manifestation of
[12:03] God's word brother Bram says but let's
[12:06] take it on another tree so we can bring
[12:07] it out and fulfill our text let's take
[12:10] it a tree of faith that Eve taken of
[12:12] this forbidden tree of unbelief that we
[12:14] could then we could make the text come
[12:16] out it was Faith she disbelieves God's
[12:18] word God said a certain certain thing
[12:21] will happen she ought to have left it
[12:23] alone she ought to ought to have
[12:25] believed it the way God said it but no
[12:27] Satan come along with his Theology and
[12:30] she mixed it and gave it to Adam and it
[12:32] caused a hybrid Faith that's what the
[12:34] church has got today so-called Church a
[12:36] hybrid Faith it's mixed with fears
[12:38] doubts frustration if it was genuine
[12:41] faith it wouldn't move When God says
[12:43] anything it would be that way but see
[12:45] she mixed it took what God Said and what
[12:48] Satan said and churned it together here
[12:50] it is that's the way many people do
[12:53] today see they take what the Bible says
[12:55] and what man says makes a hybrid faith
[12:58] and when they do they bring it back oh
[13:00] it makes a beautiful Church sure but
[13:02] it's no life in it it's dead a hybrid
[13:05] Faith oh I do believe that God was yes
[13:07] but now he's not a Healer today that's
[13:09] hybrid faith I believe to the the Holy
[13:12] Ghost to the Pentecostals back there on
[13:14] the day of Pentecost but that's not for
[13:16] us today a hybrid Faith condemned by God
[13:19] hybrid no good stay away from it it's
[13:21] evil it brings in doubts maybe I'll go
[13:24] up and get healed maybe the Lord will
[13:26] heal me that's hybrid Faith it's no good
[13:29] that's church Faith we want God's faith
[13:32] God said something and that's the truth
[13:33] stay with it amen oh I wish my words was
[13:36] wrote with an iron pin stay with what
[13:38] God said it's the truth hybrid Faith
[13:40] it'll read Hebrews 13 and say Jesus
[13:43] Christ the same yesterday today and
[13:45] forever Hebrews and then the hybrid
[13:47] faith comes in well in a certain way
[13:50] he's the same yesterday today and
[13:51] forever but he's not oh just right there
[13:54] when you think about Jesus Christ being
[13:56] the same yesterday today and forever
[13:58] when you read the Bible and you read the
[14:00] what he did in the Old Testament and you
[14:02] see the things that happened the
[14:04] healings that happened when you see the
[14:05] the men of the old when they looked upon
[14:07] the on the brass serpent that they were
[14:09] healed when you look upon the cross
[14:10] you're healed he is Christ the same
[14:12] yesterday today and forever he's the
[14:14] same God he was back there the same God
[14:16] he is today and when you get a hold to
[14:18] that faith that starts changing your
[14:20] life you can mix it with whatever you
[14:22] want to mix it with you can try to turn
[14:24] it and make your own idea you can try to
[14:26] reason it out you can try to think about
[14:28] it you can try to to forge it you could
[14:30] try to do whatever you want to do but
[14:32] when you begin to mix things with God's
[14:34] faith it starts turning things around
[14:36] that's what the church needs today they
[14:38] need a little bit of God's faith to step
[14:39] in because they're still want to do
[14:41] their own way they still want to do
[14:43] their own things people's wan to leave
[14:45] and they're trying to reason out God
[14:47] they're trying to say well God can't do
[14:48] this today God can't do that today the
[14:50] message is wrong this is wrong that's
[14:52] wrong what they're looking at is their
[14:54] own idea and their own faith but they
[14:56] never look to God's face because they
[14:58] missed the whole point they can look at
[15:00] the man but they miss the Christ you can
[15:02] look at the man all day but you miss the
[15:05] Jesus down inside the man when you miss
[15:07] the Jesus inside the man then there's
[15:09] something wrong the man the man could
[15:11] fall the man might make mistakes but
[15:13] when you look at Jesus Christ inside the
[15:15] man that turns everything around that's
[15:18] what I want to look at tonight I want to
[15:19] look at every person in here I don't
[15:21] want to see the man I don't want to see
[15:23] the nature of the man inside of them
[15:25] what I want to see is the Jesus that
[15:27] resides down in their heart I want to
[15:29] see the faith of God that comes out
[15:30] inside of them every day that's what I
[15:32] want to see I want to see when they're
[15:34] depressed that God would come down and
[15:36] they would step up just a little bit
[15:38] higher that's what I want to see tonight
[15:40] I want to see God move I want to see the
[15:42] hand of God's
[15:44] faith the genuine faith will say he is
[15:47] the same it's not hybrid it's not it's
[15:50] not all churched up with Theology of man
[15:53] not mule religion man's word and God's
[15:55] word mixed together like the perverted
[15:57] wi Vine hey
[15:59] amen I tell you when God says it that's
[16:01] the way it is you can hang your hat on
[16:04] that when God tells you something's
[16:06] going to happen you just go ahead and
[16:08] you stand upon that Faith When God says
[16:10] you're healed you stand upon that When
[16:12] God says you're saved you can stand on
[16:14] that why too many doctrines and
[16:16] theologies you got people getting saved
[16:18] every other night and they'll get saved
[16:19] tomorrow and get saved the next day and
[16:21] try to go get saved this time that God's
[16:23] already said it you need the altar
[16:25] experience you need that experience of
[16:28] God and when you get that then won't you
[16:30] stand upon that and then don't let the
[16:32] devil come back in you make a mistake
[16:34] you plead the blood of Jesus you fall
[16:36] down you just say Lord I'm sorry you get
[16:38] back up and you keep on going too many
[16:40] times people walk away from God and they
[16:42] walk back into the same nonsense that
[16:44] they they did they come out of because
[16:47] they don't know who he is he's a God
[16:49] that saves he's a God that heals he's a
[16:51] God that delivers why do I know that
[16:53] because he's done it for me I'm a
[16:55] witness that can stand here and tell you
[16:57] that God's faith got inside of me one
[16:59] day I had my own faith I had my own
[17:01] ideas I had my own will I had my own way
[17:05] but when my God stepped down inside of
[17:06] me it changed it all it changed it from
[17:11] corruptible to Incorruptible that's my
[17:13] God if my God can change me he can
[17:15] change anybody amen if my God can do
[17:18] that he can change anybody I have no
[17:20] doubt in my mind that God can change a
[17:22] biggest atheist that in the world he can
[17:25] go to him and he can prove who he is God
[17:28] can turn it around
[17:31] I don't see God sitting up there chewing
[17:32] on his fingernails wondering if you're
[17:33] going to be saved or not I don't see God
[17:35] chewing his fingernails wondering if
[17:37] he's going to see you in the Rapture I
[17:39] don't see him doing that I see him
[17:41] standing upon his word and saying that
[17:43] you are the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[17:45] you're coming up here to be with me no
[17:47] matter what circumstances you go through
[17:49] no matter what sickness you come through
[17:51] no matter what depression comes your way
[17:53] no matter what reasoning comes out of
[17:54] you no matter what thing God is standing
[17:57] there saying you will be with me that's
[18:00] what I believe tonight I might have
[18:02] failed I might have made mistakes I
[18:04] might have tripped up but my God said
[18:06] you're going to be
[18:07] here amen that's the place that rock is
[18:10] Christ Jesus said point you to the
[18:12] promised land you get on him one time
[18:15] and you'll see every promise of God is
[18:17] true absolutely that's right if you
[18:19] abide in me and my word in you then ask
[18:22] what you will and it'll be done for you
[18:24] cuz he is the word it just manifests
[18:26] itself through you when you abide in him
[18:29] amen I love this what brother R says he
[18:31] said Enoch needed a ladder one day he
[18:34] had walked 500 years with God and had
[18:35] pleased him he needed a ladder God
[18:38] provided him a highway walked right up
[18:40] home
[18:45] amen them crazy things just get in the
[18:47] way half the time says Elijah needed a
[18:50] rope one time and God gave him a chariot
[18:52] with horses to it oh my Samson needed a
[18:55] spear and God gave him a jaw bone of a
[18:57] wild mule and it beat down a thousand
[18:59] Philistines with it God provides your
[19:01] needs God has a way what if Samson said
[19:04] now wait a minute this Jawbone isn't
[19:06] sharp it isn't a spear look at them big
[19:08] thick helmets on the Philistines he just
[19:10] took God's provided way and beat right
[19:13] into it that's all you need is to take
[19:15] What God Says and go to beaten with it
[19:17] just as hard as you can you'll get
[19:19] yourself free after a while yes sir amen
[19:22] when you get a hold to God's word you
[19:24] just take that word and you have a
[19:26] promise of God and you just start
[19:27] beating and you just just start beating
[19:29] and you just start beating and
[19:31] eventually you're going to get out of
[19:32] that mess because you took what God said
[19:34] about it and you took his word and
[19:36] that's what you did with just keep
[19:38] beating just keep beating amen he went
[19:41] through a thousand Philistines with
[19:42] Jawbone when natural nature tells you
[19:45] that there is no way that would happen
[19:47] but God Did It God's faith oh good lord
[19:50] God's faith stepped over into a jaw Bon
[19:52] a mu one time I tell you God's face
[19:54] stepped over when David was standing
[19:56] there and it got into a little old rock
[19:58] somewh where and it it knocked down a
[20:01] Philistine what can his word do in your
[20:03] heart tonight what can his word do with
[20:05] you tonight I tell you it'll break every
[20:07] chain it'll break every idea it'll break
[20:10] everything that youve got it'll break
[20:12] all the things that have bound you down
[20:14] that's what God's word will do for you
[20:16] that's what it's done for me Oh Glory to
[20:18] God Amen Joshua needed the bridge God
[20:22] provided a power God provided a power
[20:25] for you and I there was a there was a
[20:28] power sitting there we didn't have a
[20:29] power Pentecost didn't know what to do
[20:31] with it but God sent a man named William
[20:33] random and he was a prophet and he begin
[20:35] to show you what you could do with that
[20:37] power and you got a hold to the message
[20:39] of the hour and it changed you amen you
[20:42] didn't know where you were going turn
[20:43] these monitors up a little bit he did
[20:45] you didn't know what you were doing you
[20:47] had no idea but then that Prophet came
[20:50] and he begin to tell you he begin to
[20:52] point you the right direction he said
[20:54] that's Jesus over there that's where I'm
[20:56] pointing to amen that's that's what he's
[20:59] pointing to he says that's the faith
[21:01] that you need you he didn't need faith
[21:03] in the man but you needed faith in the
[21:05] god of the man that's where the faith
[21:07] that's what he pointed
[21:09] to that's all he ever did was he pointed
[21:11] to that and then somebody picked up that
[21:14] message and they started running with it
[21:16] somebody picked it up and now you look
[21:18] around you and you begin to hear the
[21:20] testimonies of what God is doing you
[21:22] begin to hear the cancers being healed
[21:24] you start to heal that people are being
[21:26] delivered of drugs and alcohol and all
[21:28] the things that come against you start
[21:30] seeing people matter of fact there was a
[21:32] a little testimony come out of a brother
[21:34] Tim PR that he was that they were having
[21:36] service one night and a young man had
[21:38] had left church and he wasn't going back
[21:42] and he was out working or no he they
[21:43] said he was asleep in his bed and and it
[21:46] was a Wednesday night and he woke up and
[21:48] it was real late he he walked around the
[21:50] house and he got to look and there was
[21:52] nobody in the in the house and he's like
[21:54] well where's everybody at well the young
[21:57] boy had thought honestly thought that
[21:59] the Rapture taking
[22:01] place so that young
[22:04] man got in his truck and drove down the
[22:07] road they said he went through Fields he
[22:09] went through everywhere getting to
[22:11] church and he walked in that church and
[22:14] at that time right before that his
[22:16] sister had went up for prayer for him
[22:19] and then he come in that church wearing
[22:21] his pajamas and found the Lord there
[22:24] he's still an on time
[22:27] God oh how how long do you have to wait
[22:30] I don't know Abraham waited 25 long
[22:33] years Abraham waited forever but then
[22:36] one day Sarah be to cry out and begin to
[22:39] give birth about something that was a
[22:41] promised son and there he was and oh and
[22:44] Abraham could take and he picked up in
[22:47] the he picked up Isaac and he held him
[22:49] in his arms what I thought that it was
[22:51] that Abraham was standing there with
[22:53] Isaac and holding him and carried him
[22:56] and he knew that God had met his needs
[23:01] oh Hallelujah you talk about God's
[23:04] faith Daniel needed the fence to keep
[23:07] the Lions off of him God gave him an
[23:09] angel see that's the provided way what
[23:12] needed God provided and God provided in
[23:14] his own way now what If Daniel would
[23:16] have said now wait a minute I can think
[23:18] of a better way than a pillar of fire
[23:19] standing before me now that that line
[23:22] might not have any effect upon him he
[23:24] might come right on through that Pillar
[23:25] of Fire if you'll just get me a great
[23:27] big fence and fence me in see that would
[23:30] have been Daniel trying to do something
[23:32] but he just accepted God's provided way
[23:35] laid down and went to sleep and slept
[23:36] all night just in peace God provided a
[23:39] away the Hebrew children needed some
[23:41] water a fire hose down there to put out
[23:44] all that fire when they jumped in there
[23:45] but God provided them a fourth man God
[23:48] provided a fourth man in the fire god
[23:50] provided a pillar of fire for us to lead
[23:52] us in this day amen if we wouldn't have
[23:55] had the pillar of fire where would we be
[23:58] we would had the message of the hour
[23:59] where would we be and people want to
[24:01] just go off and and wander off out in
[24:04] the wilderness cuz that's where they're
[24:05] headed they're wandering around in the
[24:07] wilderness because they're not following
[24:09] the pillar of fire that's what we need
[24:11] tonight we need to follow that Pillar of
[24:13] Fire wherever it goes wherever it leads
[24:16] it might lead you down into some into
[24:18] some ghetto somewhere but you follow
[24:20] that Pillar of Fire I don't care where
[24:22] it takes you you follow that and you
[24:24] hang on to that because that is not just
[24:26] a just a flame or or or some myth or
[24:29] something but that is the word of God
[24:31] that's Jesus Christ walking again that's
[24:34] what it is
[24:35] amen the wise men needed a
[24:39] compass God provided a
[24:41] star they took the star that's all they
[24:44] needed the church needed
[24:46] power God provided the Holy Ghost he
[24:49] didn't provide a book of Ethics he
[24:52] didn't provide a Christian government he
[24:54] provided the Holy Ghost that's what God
[24:56] provided he never Ste

[27:18] God he pulled you out of situations You'
[27:21] have never dreamed he' you come out of
[27:23] amen and I'm happy that he's my God I'm
[27:26] grateful that he's my God I I want to
[27:28] worship my God I Want To Praise my God I
[27:31] want to give my God thanks I've watched
[27:33] too many people stand at some chilly old
[27:35] ball game and I've done it myself I
[27:37] stood up there and I've shouted for the
[27:39] ball game I've went to the concert I
[27:41] stood on the back of the bench and oh I
[27:43] was just happy as I could
[27:46] be I was happy as I could be standing in
[27:49] that old ball
[27:50] game or that old concert oh but then
[27:54] something got a hold to me and I come to
[27:57] a new new place and now I can come in
[28:00] here and I can start talking about my
[28:02] God and oh Lord I ain't going to stand
[28:05] on the
[28:06] chair but I that's what I was doing I
[28:08] was standing in a chair at that concert
[28:10] I'm sitting there singing
[28:16] her I
[28:19] was
[28:21] amen standing there just a just a
[28:24] singing and shouting and praising I
[28:26] guess if you want to call it that
[28:28] but when I start talking about my god
[28:31] when you start telling me about what God
[28:33] has done for you that does something to
[28:35] my soul when brother Matt goes to India
[28:37] and he comes back and he starts
[28:39] witnessing of what God has done that
[28:41] does something to my heart because what
[28:43] I can do then is I can take the the
[28:45] testimony that he has and I can go give
[28:47] it to somebody else that needs it
[28:49] because he I asked him the other day I
[28:51] said I said I I hope you don't mind this
[28:53] but I I said I I told somebody a
[28:55] testimony of yours and he said it ain't
[28:57] my test Tony it's the Lord's
[28:59] testimony amen it's the Lord can you
[29:02] imagine it's the Lord's testimony cuz
[29:04] the Lord is the one did it God is the
[29:06] one did it God's the one brought you out
[29:08] of your sickness God's the one that
[29:09] brought you out of all the nonsense you
[29:11] were in it's God that did
[29:13] it
[29:15] amen amen God showed
[29:19] up
[29:21] amen
[29:24] God there's another door just around the
[29:27] corner it's a Door of Faith
[29:28] oh there's many of them let's talk of
[29:30] Faith just a
[29:31] moment now I'll let you in Jesus but
[29:34] I've got my own faith well he can't do
[29:37] much for you if you got your own faith I
[29:39] don't want no faith I want his faith my
[29:42] faith is no good the faith of God is
[29:43] what we need God's faith in us my faith
[29:46] is no good your faith is no good it
[29:48] takes Christ to come in and stand in
[29:50] that door of faith and be Lord Lord over
[29:53] your faith when you read in the Bible
[29:56] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[29:58] day and forever your faith will your
[30:00] faith will say that's impossible but his
[30:03] faith will say amen I am if the critic
[30:06] says the days of Miracles have passed
[30:09] the the faith of God will say he doesn't
[30:11] know what he's talking about if the
[30:13] critic says Jesus doesn't heal the holy
[30:15] spirit standing in the door of your
[30:17] faith will say I'm the Lord that Health
[30:18] all of thy diseases it just makes such a
[30:21] difference to let him in at the door of
[30:24] Faith do you believe that tonight I tell
[30:27] you God is
[30:29] faithful he's my God I begin to look
[30:31] over and when we were starting to read
[30:33] Hebrews chapter 11 it says by faith
[30:37] abble offered unto God a more excellent
[30:39] sacrifice than Cain by faith Enoch was
[30:41] translated that he should not see death
[30:44] and without faith it is impossible to
[30:46] believe to please him for he that cometh
[30:48] to God must believe that he is that he
[30:50] is a rewarder of him that diligently
[30:52] seek Him by faith Noah being warned of
[30:55] God of things not seen as yet move with
[30:57] fear prepared an arc to the saving of
[30:59] his house by faith
[31:02] Abraham by faith oh they're
[31:05] all I ain't really got time to go
[31:08] through there's 40 verses right
[31:10] there and one more shall I sa for the
[31:13] time would fail to tell me of Gideon of
[31:15] barck of Samson and Jeffy of David also
[31:18] and Samuel and other prophets who
[31:20] through faith subdue kingdoms
[31:22] righteousness obtain promises stop the
[31:24] mouths of lions quench the violence of
[31:26] fire escaped the edge of sword out of
[31:28] weakness were made strong wax vient in
[31:31] fight turned to flight the armies of the
[31:33] aliens women received our dead raised to
[31:35] life again and others were tortured not
[31:37] accepting Deliverance that they might
[31:39] obtain a better resurrection and others
[31:41] had trial of of of cruel mockings and
[31:45] scourging gave more ever of bonds and
[31:47] imprisonment they were stoned and they
[31:49] were swn aunder were tempted were slain
[31:51] with a sword they wondered about sheep
[31:53] skins and goat skins being destitute
[31:55] Afflicted tormented of whom the world
[31:58] was not worthy they wandered in deserts
[32:00] and in mountains and in Deads and caves
[32:02] of the earth and these all having
[32:03] obtained a good report through faith
[32:05] receive not the promise God having
[32:08] provided something better for us that
[32:10] they without us should not be made
[32:12] perfect
[32:14] amen first Peter 2 and9 but you are a
[32:17] chosen
[32:18] generation a royal priesthood and holy
[32:22] nation A peculiar people that you should
[32:25] show forth the Praises of him who has
[32:28] called you out of Darkness into His
[32:30] Marvelous Light how many's come out of
[32:31] Darkness tonight every one of us should
[32:34] have our hands raised because every one
[32:35] of has come out of Darkness we have
[32:37] stepped over into the light the light
[32:39] that God has provided it's not some some
[32:43] man-made idea it's not a man-made light
[32:46] but it's a pillar of fire that's what we
[32:48] stepped into and that's what I want to
[32:49] step in tonight I want to see that
[32:51] Pillar of Fire moving and stirring and
[32:54] stirring people's hearts and it moves
[32:56] over here and it moves over there and it
[32:58] begins to speak to people that's the
[33:00] light that I want to be in I want to be
[33:02] in a light that is manifested of god the
[33:05] devil can manifest anything he wants he
[33:07] can create it he can try to make it he
[33:09] can try to reason he can try to do all
[33:11] that but my God is real
[33:15] amen which in times past were not a
[33:19] people but are now the people of
[33:22] God which have not obtained Mercy but
[33:25] now have obtained Mercy for thou are
[33:28] Deuteronomy 7 for thou are Unholy people
[33:31] unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God
[33:33] has chosen thee to be a special people
[33:35] unto himself above all people that are
[33:37] upon the face of the Earth the Lord did
[33:39] not set his love upon you nor choose you
[33:41] because you were more number for than
[33:43] any people but you are the fewest of all
[33:45] people but because the Lord loved you
[33:48] because he would keep an oath which he
[33:50] had sworn unto your fathers hath the
[33:52] Lord brought you out with a mighty hand
[33:54] and redeemed you out of the house of
[33:55] bondman know therefore that the Lord thy
[33:58] God he is God the faithful God which
[34:00] keepeth Covenant and mercy with them
[34:02] that love him and keep his Commandments
[34:04] to a thousand
[34:08] Generations amen you love the Lord
[34:10] tonight you know I got to thinking about
[34:13] you know the the the faith that is
[34:15] manifested I wanted to kind of go
[34:17] through something it's kind of a little
[34:18] simple a simple thing but some of some
[34:21] of us you know some of us you know grew
[34:24] up kind of playing chess a little bit
[34:26] you know me and Matt grew up with with
[34:27] it and I don't know how many knows a lot
[34:29] about Chess but as I begin to look at
[34:32] the chessboard I started looking at at
[34:34] at the different pieces of the
[34:35] chessboard you're sitting there and
[34:38] every piece that is on that board is
[34:40] working for the king every piece there
[34:43] is working under the authority of the
[34:45] king you know the the Chess Master
[34:47] sitting there and everything is working
[34:50] under that Authority you begin to look
[34:52] at the Queen the the queen has more
[34:55] Authority than any spece on the board
[34:58] she can go she can go at any angle she
[35:00] can go straight and she can go any way
[35:01] she wants she holds the authority and
[35:04] her main job is to protect the king
[35:06] without the queen when you take the
[35:08] Queen off the board or somebody captures
[35:10] that it it causes problems but she holds
[35:14] an authority that the other pieces don't
[35:16] hold she holds that Authority and you
[35:19] begin to look at every piece of Bishops
[35:22] they have their place the knights they
[35:24] have their place the Rooks they have
[35:26] their place but every time they move
[35:28] they're moving under the authority of
[35:30] that King but there's one little piece
[35:32] that I want to talk about tonight that
[35:34] the little Pawn It's the littlest guy on
[35:37] the board and in chest every piece is
[35:39] worth so many points a lot of people
[35:41] don't play that way but they're all
[35:42] worth and he's a least of all that
[35:45] little Pawn don't mean nothing you know
[35:47] he can be just sacrificed to a lot of
[35:48] guys they just sacrifice and throw him
[35:50] off the board so we don't really need
[35:52] that pawn and that little Pawn he he's
[35:55] kind of he's kind of limited to what he
[35:56] can do he he's kind of limited in what
[35:58] he can and how he can move you know his
[36:01] first his first move is that you know he
[36:03] can move two spaces on his first move
[36:05] that's a that's a big jump for the pawn
[36:08] but then after that you know that little
[36:09] Pawn he begins to get around and and he
[36:11] can only take one step at a time he can
[36:14] only move forward one
[36:16] time and you know he looks over and he
[36:18] sees this great bishop and he he looks
[36:20] over at him he's like well that guy can
[36:22] move way over here matter of fact that
[36:24] night he can jump people and he can do
[36:26] all this over here and and when he looks
[36:28] at that Queen he looks and he says you
[36:30] know what you know I'd like to be that
[36:33] little Queen someday I'd like to be that
[36:36] but but you know he's just a kind of a
[36:37] simple little old
[36:39] pawn but that pawn he starts going
[36:41] through a lot he starts going through
[36:44] through spaces and he's seeing all this
[36:46] movement around him he's watching his
[36:48] buddies you know get captured knocked
[36:50] off the board but he's only moving one
[36:52] step at a time and I find that sometimes
[36:55] that people only move one step at a time
[36:59] sometimes it feels like you're moving
[37:00] backwards even but just move one step at
[37:02] a time like that little Pond just keep
[37:05] moving just keep taking your steps just
[37:08] keep moving but then that little Pawn
[37:11] comes up to one more
[37:13] step there's eight squares on a board
[37:15] it's a 8 by8 board and that pond steps
[37:18] over into that e
[37:20] Square he gets through all the defenses
[37:23] he gets through all the things and all
[37:26] the conditions and all all the fights
[37:28] and all the wars and all the battles and
[37:31] all the things that come against him all
[37:33] the people that are talking about
[37:34] talking about him saying you don't mean
[37:36] nothing little pwn you ain't nothing you
[37:38] ain't nobody you're never going to make
[37:40] it you're never going to get any bigger
[37:42] you're never going to get any hard
[37:43] higher you're never going to do anything
[37:45] and he just keeps stepping but when he
[37:47] moves over into that eigh step he moves
[37:51] over into the Eighth Day there's
[37:52] something that begins to happen with
[37:54] that little Pawn there is a choice
[37:56] that's being made right there that
[37:58] little Pond can now become a
[38:01] queen
[38:03] but anything that he wants to be that's
[38:06] what he can be and then when he becomes
[38:08] a Queen full Authority is placed upon
[38:11] his life when you become the Bride of
[38:14] Jesus Christ full Authority is placed
[38:17] upon your life and then here's what I
[38:19] want you to do after you took that eight
[38:21] step I want you to turn around I want
[38:24] you to look at the board and you look at
[38:26] all the pieces that have about you all
[38:28] the things that have battled you all the
[38:30] pieces that have done everything to you
[38:32] and tell those pieces who you are tell
[38:35] them who you are and that's what they
[38:37] said to those men they said who are you
[38:40] Jesus I know Jesus I
[38:43] know Paul I know but let me tell you
[38:47] because a pawn is never just a pawn a
[38:49] pawn is a queen in waiting all you need
[38:52] to do is find a way to keep moving
[38:54] forward one square after another and you
[38:57] can get to the other side and unlock all
[39:00] kinds of Power who are you who are you
[39:05] this this is what I want to hinge on
[39:06] tonight you talk about faith being
[39:08] manifest I want to tell you who you are
[39:10] tonight I'm the one that was healed with
[39:12] cancer when they ask you who are you I'm
[39:15] the one who's depressed and now have joy
[39:17] I'm the one who has anxiety and now have
[39:20] peace I'm the one who was healed with
[39:21] headaches I'm the one who had strokes
[39:23] but I'm now healed I'm the one who was
[39:25] blind but now I see I was the one who
[39:28] had foot pain for a year and a half now
[39:30] I have no pain I was the one who was an
[39:32] addict and now I am free I was the one
[39:35] who was nothing but now my faith has

[41:55] that old devil that has hindered

[42:03] Oklahoma and we fought to get there and
[42:07] it was just
[42:08] like anytime something would happen
[42:10] something would happen things would it's
[42:12] just a big seemed like everything wanted
[42:14] to fight with us to get out

[42:22] quoted a quote about the cookie y'all
[42:25] remember the him talking about
[42:27] the the kid the child w a cookie so the
[42:32] Wednesday morning I come and told him I
[42:33] was talking to him about it and I said
[42:35] you know brother Joe Wednesday morning I
[42:37] was listening to a tape and brother
[42:38] brand quotes that quote you know I
[42:40] thought that was amazing I thought you
[42:42] know what the lord is good well this is
[42:46] two times Thursday night I went out to
[42:49] the camp and brother Andrew Glover was
[42:50] standing out he he told me to come here
[42:51] and I got to testify him testifying to
[42:53] him about that quote and his mouth just
[42:56] fell open
[42:57] he was standing there and he went that's
[43:00] where I'm at Thursday night he quoted
[43:02] the same quote so it got me to thinking
[43:04] you know what I'm going to cry out to
[43:06] God God I need a cookie I need something
[43:10] and I'm going to get it amen I need
[43:13] something I'm going to get it I'm going

[43:20] bug you till I get my peace I'm going to
[43:22] bug you till I get my Deliverance I'm
[43:24] going to bug you till I get healed I'm
[43:26] going to BU B you I'm going go there was
[43:28] a man did that one time that Elijah was
[43:31] standing there he said if you see me go
[43:33] you're going to get a double portion of
[43:35] what I have and then elishah got to get
[43:38] all over him you know Elijah was
[43:39] probably like man would you leave me
[43:41] alone would you get off my back he said
[43:44] no I'm not going to get off your back
[43:46] because I've had a promise I've had a
[43:48] promise I'm not getting off your back
[43:51] and he followed him and he followed him
[43:53] and then there come a day that Elijah
[43:55] was fixing to go up and Elijah took his
[43:58] mantle and he walked over to the river
[44:00] and he said River roll back and the
[44:02] river roll back and he walked across and
[44:05] Elijah he told Elisha you you might wait
[44:07] here no I'm coming with you I'm getting
[44:09] that double portion I'm going to get
[44:11] that and he went across with him and
[44:14] then out of the heavens came a chariot
[44:17] of fire and horses and oh Elijah the man
[44:20] of God that he was stepped up over onto
[44:23] that Chariot and he took off up to
[44:25] heaven and Elijah going wasn't just a
[44:29] second or two the mantle fell back down
[44:32] and Elisha picked up the mantle oh and
[44:34] it fit him quite well by the way and he
[44:37] went to that River and he rolled that
[44:40] that that mantle up in his hand and he
[44:42] smoke the river he said where is the god
[44:45] of Elijah and the river rolled back and
[44:48] I tell you tonight where is the god of
[44:50] Elijah it's in the Bride of Jesus Christ
[44:54] that is where it's at because that was a
[44:56] sheep be waving that's what that was
[45:00] that was showing you who you could be
[45:02] that was showing you the authority that
[45:04] you
[45:06] have that's showing you who you are and
[45:09] it's time to step out and tell the devil
[45:12] who you
[45:14] are but we were out there again and the
[45:19] aaden he always had that thing with his
[45:21] eye little Crosse eye that got messed up
[45:24] when he was little when he was a baby a
[45:26] man grew over and he stopped the growth
[45:28] of the vision of that eye and so I took
[45:32] him up PR prayer and I told the brothers
[45:35] what was going on with him and so they
[45:37] they prayed for him and then uh the next
[45:40] day there was a blind man come through
[45:42] the through the line and we prayed for
[45:45] it and then brother Wendell the next
[45:48] night whatever night it was Saturday
[45:51] night he is testifying he said there is
[45:53] a man here that God healed of blindness
[45:56] and the brother out I thought well I
[46:00] want to talk to that fell I want to talk
[46:02] to him I want ask him his testimony when
[46:04] me and Sarah went out when we went out
[46:06] that night I I went up to him I got
[46:08] introduce myself we got to talking and I
[46:10] said brother you know tomorrow if you
[46:12] got time I'd like to hear your testimony
[46:15] and his wife said you know what uh it's
[46:18] not very long you can tell it now and
[46:21] the first
[46:23] words that come out of his mouth was my
[46:26] eye was crossed lost when he was
[46:29] born and right then and there I knew the
[46:32] Lord was
[46:33] speaking me I knew it anyway but it was
[46:35] just a confirmation that God was there
[46:38] and he said I had surgery on my eye to
[46:41] fix it and that surgery caused my eye to
[46:44] go
[46:45] blind that's the same surgery they're
[46:48] wanting to do with with Aiden to fix
[46:49] that
[46:51] eye and and he said he was in a meeting
[46:54] in at brother Sean Martin
[46:57] he was sitting in the
[46:59] congregation and the Lord dealt with him
[47:01] and he said Lord I'm Healed and accepted
[47:04] his healing it was a manifestation of
[47:06] his faith the man told his wife when he
[47:09] left he said I'm driving home and held
[47:12] his hand over his good eye while he
[47:15] drove home I looked at the man I saw the
[47:19] man and both of his eyes are just as
[47:21] straight as they can
[47:23] be but the faith that I have for that
[47:26] little boy right there there's going to
[47:28] be a day when you're going to look at
[47:29] him and you're going to see that eye
[47:31] straightened up that's what you're going

[57:54] Sunday and heard you know testimony of
[57:58] of of his mother-in-law praying for she
[58:00] had come up for prayer for Aiden Sunday
[58:03] morning he didn't know that they didn't
[58:04] know anything that was going on and and
[58:06] I told the testimony there at the end of
[58:08] the service and and I i' been gotten in
[58:11] just under inspiration was telling the
[58:13] testimony of that little girl that was
[58:15] healed and of blindness and and I didn't
[58:18] know what brother Mark was going to
[58:18] preach tonight but I put this I put this
[58:21] down because I wanted when I told it I
[58:22] don't want to tell anything wrong and
[58:24] when I told it I kind of mixed up two
[58:25] different test testimonies and I and I
[58:27] pray y'all forgive me for that I don't I
[58:29] don't I'm human and and I mess up more
[58:32] than anybody but but but the but the
[58:35] account of it was greater than I could
[58:36] tell it anyway and you know somebody had
[58:38] brought it to my attention and you know
[58:40] called that that little girl was that
[58:42] was a little white girl and I'd call her
[58:43] black girl and kind of mixed up the
[58:44] stories whatever but but uh but but you
[58:47] know sometimes we get lost in the weeds
[58:49] and we miss the we missed the whole
[58:51] story but I thought you know I'll I just
[58:53] wanted to to share this tonight and and
[58:55] uh that this uh this had happen in
[58:58] Jonesboro Arkansas and actually uh it
[59:01] wasn't just I I'd put both stories
[59:02] together and but it was two different
[59:04] testimonies and two's better than one
[59:05] anyway and so I thought you know what
[59:07] I'll just read it the way it happened
[59:09] and and uh and and I didn't know he was
[59:11] going to preach that or tell testimonies
[59:12] about his boy's eyes but but the the
[59:15] Lord had already put this on my heart so
[59:17] I just want to read it tonight but
[59:18] brother Bram was telling an account of
[59:20] these are me the meetings that took
[59:21] place in Jonesboro in the first account
[59:23] and and it was that little girl that
[59:25] came to him and asked asking for healing
[59:27] and or you remember she had she was
[59:28] coming to look for the Healer and and he
[59:30] said she's coming this way and pushing
[59:32] and bumping and excusing herself and
[59:34] hollering daddy daddy where are you he
[59:36] said and I leaned over and he said I he
[59:38] said you know wait till this is over he
[59:40] said because you're going to think I was
[59:41] a hypocrite doing this he said but I
[59:43] moved over to where I got right in line
[59:45] with her and she'd go this way and I'd
[59:47] stay in the way until she bumped into me
[59:49] and when she bumped in something told me
[59:51] to go over there he said when she hit me
[59:52] she said pardon me I said yes ma'am she
[59:55] said Daddy I said what do you want who

[1:01:56] weeds he said but nevertheless she said
[1:01:59] he said well that she had heard a man
[1:02:01] that had came and and and and and uh had
[1:02:04] been healed and and so she had came on
[1:02:06] that testimony of another man being
[1:02:08] healed and she said I read I heard him
[1:02:10] testify and I heard him on the radio
[1:02:12] testifying and reading his Bible and she
[1:02:14] said that's the only hope that I have to
[1:02:16] ever see I said Do You Believe such and
[1:02:18] she said yes sir he said listen sir is
[1:02:21] there any way you could just get me to
[1:02:23] where he's at and if you'll get me to
[1:02:25] where he's at I'll find my daddy after
[1:02:27] that he said that was too much for me
[1:02:29] she said I'll find my daddy if you can
[1:02:31] just get me in there I thought that's
[1:02:33] the way our God is he he he tried her
[1:02:35] faith just enough until she find out she
[1:02:37] had the faith of God and but friends
[1:02:40] what What mattered was is she was
[1:02:41] standing in the presence of the Creator
[1:02:43] and his name wasn't William brandham it
[1:02:45] was Jesus Christ and he worked through a
[1:02:47] prophet of God to give a little girl her
[1:02:50] sight back isn't that wonderful tonight
[1:02:53] that our God would give a little girl
[1:02:54] back her sight I believe that same God
[1:02:56] that would take a man in Oklahoma and
[1:02:58] that would that would fix his eyes that
[1:03:00] was crossed that had gone blind the same
[1:03:02] God that'll touch that little boy's eyes
[1:03:04] that is Sting here tonight I believe
[1:03:06] that and I shared that that you know I
[1:03:09] know how that that this world is today
[1:03:12] and and you know they there's let me can
[1:03:14] I just give you something free tonight
[1:03:16] let me give you something that's going
[1:03:17] to help you because you're going to come
[1:03:18] there this you mark my words you're
[1:03:20] going to be challenged you'll be
[1:03:22] challenged in this hour of of
[1:03:24] testimonies that brother brandham told
[1:03:25] well this way somebody said it this way
[1:03:27] and this way somebody but I want to tell
[1:03:29] you something that William brandom nor
[1:03:31] any man that's ever been ordained of God
[1:03:33] to preach the gospel has ever made a
[1:03:35] claim that William brandham was an
[1:03:36] infallible man he never claimed that and
[1:03:38] any god-ordained man has never claimed
[1:03:40] that any man that God has ever inspired
[1:03:43] has never claimed that that does not
[1:03:45] come from God people may have put that
[1:03:47] on his life but that did not come from
[1:03:49] God and it never came from him but let
[1:03:51] me say this but the message that he
[1:03:53] preached was an infallible message it
[1:03:56] was sent for the purpose of bringing a
[1:03:58] bride out of Le oosa and bringing a
[1:04:00] people back to God that they would find
[1:04:03] out who they came from and they would
[1:04:04] see the very Vindication of the
[1:04:06] resurrection of Jesus Christ don't get
[1:04:09] caught in the
[1:04:10] weeds but you'll be challenged on it but
[1:04:12] you have to know that same you think
[1:04:14] about it they would pick little parts
[1:04:16] and they pick on his stories I I kind of
[1:04:18] feel that way sometimes people pick on
[1:04:19] me I tell stuff backwards all the time I
[1:04:21] don't mean to and I don't do it to
[1:04:22] mislead anybody and you know if we could
[1:04:25] if we could ask him brother BR why'd you
[1:04:27] tell that that way and then the other
[1:04:28] time you said it was blue and the other
[1:04:30] time you said it was black he'd say
[1:04:31] friend I'm you forgive me sometimes I'm
[1:04:33] tired and I I'm weak in my body and you
[1:04:35] forgive me I don't mean to do that
[1:04:36] that's the way he would do it don't
[1:04:38] don't don't don't let that whenever
[1:04:40] whenever that comes around you you I'm
[1:04:42] just giving you a fair warning one day
[1:04:44] that'll come around and there'll
[1:04:45] somebody sit in your living room or call
[1:04:47] you on
[1:04:54] the
[1:05:24] e
[1:05:54] e
[1:06:20] she said I believe I will see when I
[1:06:22] leave here brother brandom then asked
[1:06:25] everyone to bow their heads the young
[1:06:27] man he did not mean to be disrespectful
[1:06:29] it
[1:06:42] was suddenly brother Brandon pushed the
[1:06:44] little blind girl from him and as he did
[1:06:47] the young man watched intently as big
[1:06:49] white marbles these were his words
[1:06:51] formed in her eyes he stifled a gasp at
[1:06:54] the sight just as as brother Brown spoke
[1:06:56] to the little girl he said oh honey I
[1:06:59] forgot to ask you what color eyes did
[1:07:01] you want and the little girl quickly
[1:07:03] answered blue and once more brother
[1:07:06] Brandon pulled her back to him and in a
[1:07:08] voice that conveyed both assurance and
[1:07:09] humility he said Lord I forgot to ask
[1:07:12] you if you would give her blue eyes the
[1:07:15] young man's gaze was fixed upon the
[1:07:17] child's eyes as he saw the blue of the
[1:07:20] iris's form in the child's eyes even as
[1:07:24] she had asked the prophet of of God she
[1:07:26] left the building seeing through new
[1:07:28] blue eyes although almost half a century
[1:07:31] has passed that young man now a pastor
[1:07:34] in a Southern state has never forgotten
[1:07:35] the day he really witnessed the power of
[1:07:38] God to create the Creator is still here
[1:07:44] that's the point of the story is the
[1:07:46] creator is still Among Us isn't it
[1:07:48] wonderful to know the Creator friends
[1:07:50] let me tell you that same Creator is
[1:07:52] still here today let me tell you another
[1:07:54] story I was standing at in India one day
[1:07:56] I and a man come up to the prayer line
[1:07:58] and he walked up there and I'd been
[1:08:00] preaching and and in in my broken way of
[1:08:02] preaching but something had put a a draw
[1:08:04] in his heart to to come up and some
[1:08:07] other people in the the assembly had
[1:08:09] known him in the street they knew that
[1:08:10] he was blinding they went and they got
[1:08:12] him and they brought him into the
[1:08:13] meeting and they brought him up to the
[1:08:14] front of the platform and after
[1:08:16] preaching of the faith of God and the
[1:08:18] power of God and brother Joe when they
[1:08:20] stood that man before me that day I
[1:08:22] wanted to hide behind the platform
[1:08:24] because I didn't know how you you you
[1:08:26] you preach something and there's such an
[1:08:27] authority in preaching it but whenever
[1:08:29] they walk that man up I realized I had
[1:08:31] no ability to open his eyes I had no
[1:08:33] ability to heal him I had nothing I
[1:08:35] could offer him except for the word that
[1:08:36] I'd been preaching and I felt about this
[1:08:39] big and I walked around there to the
[1:08:41] side of that little platform and those
[1:08:43] Brothers had brought him up and had an
[1:08:44] interpreter there said brother what do
[1:08:46] you come for prayer and the brother
[1:08:47] began to speak for him he said he's
[1:08:49] blind he's been blind for many years and
[1:08:52] it may have been from his birth if I
[1:08:53] told that before it was from his birth
[1:08:54] y'all forgive me me because I'm human
[1:08:56] sometimes I forget but I don't remember
[1:08:58] if it was when it was birth or or maybe
[1:09:00] it been been many years but long long
[1:09:02] time when the man was blind he stood
[1:09:04] before me you could see over his eyes
[1:09:06] they were glazed over in a in a in an
[1:09:08] odd look it it wasn't even an ordinary
[1:09:10] look and I'm not a doctor but I just I
[1:09:12] just know it wasn't how the human eye
[1:09:14] supposed to look and I stood there and
[1:09:16] the only thing I knew to do was
[1:09:17] testifying of what our Creator God could
[1:09:20] do and I went testimony after testimony
[1:09:23] I be to tell that man to the best of my
[1:09:25] remember remance and I told him of how
[1:09:27] that John Ryan brother Joe told about it
[1:09:28] the other day I told him how John Ryan
[1:09:30] had received his healing and I told him
[1:09:32] about the little girl in Jonesboro and I
[1:09:34] told him I said I'm from Jonesboro I'm
[1:09:35] from the same city that that little girl
[1:09:37] was healed in and I told him about the
[1:09:38] other little girl that was healed there
[1:09:40] and I'm from Jonesboro and I and I begin
[1:09:42] to make connection with him about how
[1:09:44] God the Creator God had had came and
[1:09:46] done these these miraculous things and
[1:09:49] as I testified about Jesus and all the
[1:09:51] things that Jesus had done and I kept
[1:09:53] telling him after a little while or a
[1:09:55] few minutes I asked him I said brother I
[1:09:58] said do you I said do you know Jesus or
[1:10:01] I said if you heard of Jesus he said
[1:10:03] well he said I've heard of him but I've
[1:10:05] never met him I thought my what a what a
[1:10:08] response he said I've heard of him but
[1:10:11] I've never met him and I said well
[1:10:13] friend he's standing here right now and
[1:10:16] I'd like to introduce you to him and I
[1:10:19] started I knelt down and I asked him I
[1:10:21] said well friend let me ask you if he
[1:10:23] was a God that could heal other eyes
[1:10:25] would you serve him if he had heal your
[1:10:28] eyes too and that man said I'd serve him
[1:10:30] all the days of my life would you
[1:10:32] renounce the gods of India the gods that
[1:10:35] that that you've been serving that you
[1:10:36] got on your mantel that you that you
[1:10:38] carry out in your pocket and we would
[1:10:39] you serve this Jesus if he had open your
[1:10:41] eyes and the man's testimony he said I
[1:10:43] would serve him if he had opened my eyes
[1:10:46] and I stood there with them brothers and
[1:10:47] I laid my hands on that man and we had
[1:10:49] prayer for him they let him out of that
[1:10:51] building just a few minutes later a few
[1:10:53] the power God dropped in there the
[1:10:55] people was worshiping other people many
[1:10:57] healings that took place in that meeting
[1:10:58] they let him out of the building that
[1:11:00] night we came back and we had another
[1:11:02] service later on that evening and at the
[1:11:04] end of that evening I watched as that
[1:11:06] man come in there and here in one hand
[1:11:08] he had one woman in the other hand he
[1:11:10] had another woman and he walked up there
[1:11:12] I remember him stepping over a cord and
[1:11:14] I thought isn't that something that that
[1:11:15] man it was the wires and all the cords
[1:11:17] that they had bundled up to go to all
[1:11:19] the microphones and speakers and I
[1:11:21] remember watching that man as he
[1:11:22] scuffled up and Brother David and he
[1:11:24] stepped over that cord about ran out of
[1:11:25] the back of the building I thought what
[1:11:27] would give that man the ability a a man
[1:11:29] that couldn't see a few hours before but
[1:11:32] he had enough that he could see the cord
[1:11:33] laying in the floor and he walked up to
[1:11:36] the front of that church he said brother
[1:11:38] Matt he said he said I brought my wife
[1:11:40] and this is my mother-in-law he said and
[1:11:42] they want to serve Jesus too I thought
[1:11:45] is't this something that our God why
[1:11:47] because he's a Creator God he can put
[1:11:49] enough in them enough faith in somebody
[1:11:51] that his wife would give her heart to
[1:11:53] the Lord and his mother-in-law there
[1:11:54] ain't no telling how many shows that
[1:11:56] have been worn from the testimony of one
[1:11:59] man I remember when I got on the plane
[1:12:01] and that brother sent me an email from
[1:12:02] India and I was I was sitting there on
[1:12:04] the flight going home it's about a 30h
[1:12:06] hour flight mix you know stopping and
[1:12:09] going and I remember when I was sitting
[1:12:10] on that flight and somehow got enough
[1:12:12] when he got on the Wi-Fi and got an
[1:12:14] email Brother David I got an email from
[1:12:16] that brother and he got to testifying of
[1:12:18] what that man had said and and and Buddy
[1:12:21] when he started testifying about got in
[1:12:23] trouble on the plane and he he he wrote
[1:12:26] in the email he said that brother he
[1:12:27] said brother Matt when he when you told
[1:12:30] him that Jesus the Same Jesus that
[1:12:33] healed that little girl and the same
[1:12:35] Jesus that healed John Ryan and the same
[1:12:37] Jesus that put the eyes that made mud
[1:12:40] and put it in that Blind Man's eyes over
[1:12:43] there by the pool of salom when you told
[1:12:44] him the testimonies of what Jesus done
[1:12:47] and you said that same Jesus is standing
[1:12:49] here right now would you meet him he
[1:12:52] said the man was blind he said and in
[1:12:55] his testimony he didn't realize that
[1:12:58] Jesus this is in India in his testimony
[1:13:01] he didn't realize Jesus was one that had
[1:13:03] an Earthly Ministry 2,000 years ago and
[1:13:06] that he wasn't really standing there he
[1:13:08] said and that man told us that when you
[1:13:10] told him that he thought he was just
[1:13:12] standing there beside you because he
[1:13:15] couldn't see you no more than he could
[1:13:16] see him I thought brother isn't that
[1:13:18] something he said didn't our Prophet say
[1:13:20] that our sight is a hindrance to our
[1:13:23] faith in the very in the very senses of
[1:13:25] our flesh is a hindrance to our faith I
[1:13:27] thought isn't that something but that
[1:13:29] man stood there and his own sight
[1:13:31] couldn't be a hindrance to him to
[1:13:33] believe that Jesus was still standing
[1:13:35] there and could give him back his sight
[1:13:37] that's the kind of faith that I want
[1:13:39] tonight the faith of God that could drop
[1:13:41] into the heart of a man and his senses
[1:13:44] his five senses couldn't hinder him from
[1:13:46] believing God I had a jubilee on the
[1:13:48] airplane R home I I come up out of my
[1:13:51] seat saying praise the Lord oh God don't
[1:13:53] ever let my senses be hindrance to my
[1:13:55] faith and he received his healing that's
[1:13:59] my God he's the Creator and he's still
[1:14:01] alive today he's still doing the same
[1:14:03] work today and I believe that Daddy has
[1:14:05] got a right to confess the healing for
[1:14:07] his son's eyes that one day that little
[1:14:10] boy will stand in this same pulpit and
[1:14:12] Testify the same thing that I was a
[1:14:14] little boy and my eyes were crossed and
[1:14:16] it bothered me but I but my but my daddy
[1:14:19] and my mama they stood for me and God
[1:14:21] healed my eyes and I'm here to testify
[1:14:23] about today that I'm Healed by the blood
[1:14:25] of Jesus Christ why because our God is a
[1:14:28] Creator he's a Healer brother Mark said
