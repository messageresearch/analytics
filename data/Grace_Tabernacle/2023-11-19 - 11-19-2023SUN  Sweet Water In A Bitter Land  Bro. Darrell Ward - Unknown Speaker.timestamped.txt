[40:29] boy and a voice spoke to my heart and
[40:32] said if you go out that door I'll never
[40:34] call you
[40:36] again and it was that afternoon that I

[41:46] that we could ever hope for amen I want
[41:49] to read from Exodus chapter 15 starting
[41:51] at verse
[41:54] 11 the Bible says this
[41:58] who is like unto thee Oh Lord among the
[42:02] gods who is like the Glorious in
[42:06] Holiness fearful in Praises doing
[42:11] wonders Verse 18 the Lord shall reign
[42:16] forever and
[42:18] ever for the horse of pharaoh went in
[42:22] with his chariots and with his Horsemen
[42:23] into the sea and the Lord brought again
[42:26] the Waters of the sea upon them but the
[42:29] children of Israel went on dry land in
[42:32] the midst of the sea amen and maram the
[42:35] prophet of a sister of Aaron took a
[42:36] timal in her hand and all the women went
[42:39] out after her with timal and with dances
[42:43] and Mariam answered them sing ye to the
[42:46] Lord for he hath triumphed
[42:48] gloriously the horse and his rider hath
[42:52] he thrown into the sea so Moses brought
[42:56] Israel from the Red Sea and they went
[42:57] out into the Wilderness of shur and they
[43:00] went three days into the Wilderness and
[43:02] they found no
[43:04] water and when they came to morah they
[43:07] could not drink of the Waters of morah
[43:10] for they were bitter therefore the name
[43:12] of it was called morah and the people
[43:15] murmured against Moses saying what shall
[43:18] we drink and he cried unto the Lord and
[43:22] the Lord showed him a tree which when he
[43:24] had cast into the waters the waters were
[43:27] made sweet and there he made for them a
[43:30] statue and an ordinance and there he
[43:33] proved
[43:35] them and he said if thou wil diligently
[43:38] hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God
[43:42] and will do that which is right in his
[43:44] sight and will give ear to his
[43:46] Commandments and keep all of his statues
[43:49] not just the ones we want but all of his
[43:52] statues I will put none of these
[43:55] diseases upon upon thee which I have
[43:57] brought upon the Egyptians for I am the
[44:01] Lord that Health
[44:05] thee Amen Let Us bow our heads I want to
[44:09] speak to you for a few minutes this
[44:10] morning on Sweet Water in a bitter
[44:16] land Heavenly
[44:19] Father Thy word is
[44:22] true I commit this
[44:25] congregation and myself into your hands
[44:29] For Your Glory in Jesus name God bless
[44:33] you Saints you may be
[44:36] seated now in our scripture
[44:40] reading that we read to you this morning
[44:42] it opens with a declaration of how great
[44:46] our God is and i' like to say this
[44:50] morning that he is that there is no God
[44:54] like our God there are many gods in the
[44:57] world today that's exactly right people
[45:00] take a sports Manan or some kind of
[45:02] musician or a politician and will make a
[45:04] God out of them people make Gods out of
[45:07] their cars and out of their jobs and out
[45:08] of their homes there's all kinds of gods
[45:10] in the world today but I stand here with
[45:13] this declaration that there is no God
[45:16] like our God the Bible says in Isaiah
[45:18] 469 remember the former things of old
[45:21] for I am God hallelujah and there is
[45:24] none else I am God and there is none
[45:27] like me he is the true and living God
[45:32] you know Brother David Siler I heard him
[45:33] say one time he was over in India and he
[45:35] said he saw a man take a piece of wood
[45:37] or a piece of brass or something like
[45:39] that and he fashioned him out of God and
[45:42] Brother David said I watched that man
[45:43] set that God Down and Worship the God
[45:46] that he made with his hands and Brother
[45:48] David said as I was watching him do that
[45:50] I thought to myself I'm so glad that I
[45:52] don't serve a God that I made with my
[45:54] hands but I serve a God who made me with
[45:57] his hands and I'm so glad that I stand
[45:59] here today Hallelujah not a god of
[46:02] imagination but we have been made by the
[46:04] hands of almighty God created for such a
[46:07] time as this this is our day this is our
[46:10] hour This is Our Moment friends he
[46:12] called us for this day amen oh my there
[46:16] is no God like our God he is the true
[46:19] and living God I'm so glad that we serve
[46:21] a God not a dead God of stone or or a
[46:25] god of that that has no ability to
[46:27] answer back that we could pray to that
[46:29] we could cry out to but he cannot answer
[46:31] back to us I'm so glad that I don't
[46:33] serve a god of someone's imagination but
[46:36] we serve a God today who has the ability
[46:39] to answer back we serve the Living God
[46:42] he is Almighty he is all powerful he is
[46:44] full of Mercy he is love
[46:47] amen and we can cry out to this God and
[46:50] he hears our cry and he sees our tears
[46:54] and our God has the ability to answer
[46:57] back Jeremiah 33:3 says call unto me
[47:00] sayith the Lord and I will answer thee
[47:04] not could be not hope so not maybe but
[47:06] he said if you cry to me I will answer
[47:09] you you said oh is that true the Bible
[47:12] says so remember when Moses was at the
[47:15] burning bush and he said why have you
[47:16] not delivered your children why have you
[47:18] not heard the Cry of your children what
[47:20] did God tell Moses I have surely seen
[47:22] the Affliction of my people I have heard
[47:25] their cry
[47:26] Hallelujah and I am cut down to deliver
[47:29] them amen hallelujah call unto me he
[47:34] said and I will answer thee you think of
[47:36] Jonah in the belly of a whale a man who
[47:39] had more symptoms more circumstances
[47:42] against him than any man I know anybody
[47:46] here ever been swallowed by a fish Jonah
[47:49] was swallowed by a fish but what did he
[47:52] say he said I cried out to the Lord
[47:56] I cried by reason of my Affliction unto
[47:59] the Lord and he heard me out of the
[48:03] belly of Hell cried I and thou heardest
[48:06] my voice David said in Psalms he said in
[48:08] my distress I called upon the Lord and I
[48:11] cried under my God and he heard my voice
[48:13] out of his Temple and My Cry came before
[48:16] him even into his ears who is like thee
[48:19] Oh God among the gods who is like thee
[48:22] glorious in Holiness fearful in Praises
[48:25] do doing wonders and let me say wonders

[48:31] bondage notice he went there he told
[48:33] Moses go down there tell go down there
[48:35] tell Pharaoh Moses go down there and
[48:37] tell Pharaoh I didn't come to steal your
[48:40] slaves but you go tell Pharaoh I have
[48:43] come to deliver my children Israel is my
[48:50] son
[48:52] hallelujah amen wonders he did he
[48:55] brought the children out of bondage with
[48:57] a mighty hand and he drowned Pharaoh's
[49:00] Army the greatest army to that
[49:03] date and he drowned them in the
[49:07] sea he sent 10 plagues upon Egypt Egypt
[49:12] had all kinds of gods but they had 10 of
[49:14] the famous
[49:16] gods and God trumped everyone of their
[49:20] gods to prove he was the true and Only
[49:24] God he sent 10 plagues for the 10 most
[49:28] famous Egyptian
[49:31] gods you believe
[49:34] that he turned the water of now into
[49:38] blood seven days the Egyptians had a God
[49:41] by the name of hapi ha a pii the god of

[50:32] the God of medicine it rained hell out
[50:35] of the sky and turned the fire upon the
[50:37] earth and the Egyptians had a god named

[56:04] trying to stop that bug that's what you
[56:06] need to do this morning you need to
[56:07] realize that your enemy is nothing but a

[56:12] stop him under their
[56:13] [Applause]
[56:16] feet you need to tell Satan you are
[56:19] under my
[56:23] feet and on the banks of the Red Sea
[56:25] they were having a Hallelujah big time
[56:28] after a great Victory here they go
[56:30] through the Wilderness they're on their
[56:32] Journey marching shouting praising God
[56:35] following the message of a prophet
[56:37] following the pillar of fire on their
[56:39] way to a Promised Land being led by a
[56:41] God who can not
[56:44] fail they are being led by a God who
[56:47] done told them when you come to this
[56:50] mountain you will worship me on this
[56:53] mountain so as far far as God was
[56:55] concerned they were already
[57:00] there and here they go through this
[57:03] Wilderness shouting screaming praising
[57:06] God having a Revival following a God who
[57:11] could not
[57:12] fail three days into the journey they
[57:17] find their first
[57:20] test they find theel in a desert place
[57:25] with no
[57:27] water three days they marched all the
[57:30] families all the cattle the animals the
[57:34] mules coming out of Egypt a single day
[57:38] in the wilderness without water would
[57:40] have been tolerable two days would have
[57:42] been difficult but three days would be
[57:46] impossible especially for
[57:48] children and the
[57:50] Animals anybody ever been
[57:53] thirsty I I remember one time I was in
[57:55] the Army and we got caught out
[57:57] unexpectedly On Maneuvers and I didn't
[57:59] get no water in my canteen and was out
[58:02] there in the hot sun it was hot and I
[58:04] was so thirsty I thought I was going to
[58:07] die and I asked a total stranger someone
[58:11] i' never seen in my life sir can I have
[58:13] a drink of your
[58:15] water you said why would you do that
[58:17] what if he had some kind of disease I
[58:19] was
[58:22] thirsty anybody ever been that thirsty
[58:24] amen amen but you know what he done he
[58:28] never gave me the
[58:30] water he said I just have enough for
[58:33] myself and to be so
[58:40] thirsty and after three days of marching
[58:43] no water someone up ahead yells
[58:48] water there's a fountain of water and
[58:51] just At The Mention Of that water they
[58:53] begin to break RS Maybe the little ones
[58:55] begin to run ahead maybe the animals
[58:57] begin to smell it and begin to run
[58:59] towards the water and the one that got
[59:00] there first it got down and he got him
[59:02] some water three days I've got water he
[59:12] go get
[59:14] back get back don't drink it what Lord
[59:18] what what what's wrong it's
[59:21] bitter get the kids back get the animals
[59:24] back might make them
[59:28] sick can't drink
[59:31] it no
[59:34] water but you see three days without
[59:38] water you would about drank
[59:41] anything but notice catch this God made
[59:45] this water so bitter that they could not
[59:48] drink it and sometimes God will make a
[59:52] trial so hard
[59:55] the water will be so bitter that you
[59:58] can't expect nothing less than a
[1:00:00] miracle that God wouldn't make the trial
[1:00:03] so hard the test so hard that you would
[1:00:06] look nowhere else there would be nowhere
[1:00:08] else you could look to but
[1:00:10] [Music]
[1:00:14] him
[1:00:16] bitter
[1:00:17] Waters think about that the
[1:00:20] disappointment of finding water only to
[1:00:23] realize it was bitter would only make
[1:00:25] the situation worse it would have been
[1:00:28] better to find no water at
[1:00:30] all than to find water that you couldn't
[1:00:35] drink think about that it would have
[1:00:38] been better not to even seen it but to
[1:00:41] look upon the Water to see it perhaps it
[1:00:44] wasn't bloody perhaps it was clear
[1:00:46] perhaps it was sparkling it was so
[1:00:48] enticing it was so inviting but they
[1:00:51] could not drink it it would only make
[1:00:55] the situation worse to be so thirsty to

[1:01:57] just three days before 72 hours before
[1:02:02] they were singing shouting
[1:02:05] dancing beating tambourines talking how
[1:02:08] great their God
[1:02:10] was now three days 72 hours later
[1:02:15] they're murmuring and complaining and
[1:02:17] scared and upset the very ones that were
[1:02:20] shouting the very ones that were
[1:02:22] standing up in church clapping the very
[1:02:24] ones that was hollering amen and Glory

[1:02:43] changed when they arrived in Morra the
[1:02:47] bitter land and it's in those worst
[1:02:51] moments come on when the doctor says I'm

[1:03:18] father of
[1:03:20] them it's when he finds US weak and
[1:03:23] weary and depressed and
[1:03:26] disappointed that he really likes to
[1:03:28] jump on your back he really likes to
[1:03:31] pour it on
[1:03:34] you can you imagine the
[1:03:37] lies that tempted to overtake them when

[1:03:44] yours delivered you out of Egypt were
[1:03:48] you had food you had water to
[1:03:51] drink to leave you three days in a
[1:03:53] desert to die and then tempt you with
[1:03:57] water that you can't even drink some God
[1:04:01] you serve some cruel God you
[1:04:05] serve and it's in those moments it was
[1:04:08] in that moment that every fear
[1:04:13] surfaced and all they
[1:04:15] saw was
[1:04:18] death it was a bitter
[1:04:21] situation indeed you see the devil only
[1:04:25] wants you to see the x-rays and the MRIs

[1:04:30] addiction the marital situation the fear
[1:04:33] the pain the No Way Out situation he
[1:04:35] wants you to see the storm but he
[1:04:37] doesn't want you to see the
[1:04:41] sun I flew on many of flights going
[1:04:44] different places to preach I've got on
[1:04:45] an airplane when it's been raining I've
[1:04:47] been on an airplane when the sky was
[1:04:49] dark and gloomy and cloudy been on the
[1:04:50] plane when it was sleeping and snowing
[1:04:52] and you get on that plane and you take
[1:04:54] off and as it breaks up through the
[1:04:55] atmosphere coming through those clouds
[1:04:57] the plane will shake and drop and bump
[1:04:59] but I'm telling you once you break
[1:05:01] through those clouds every time I've
[1:05:02] ever been on that flight when I break
[1:05:04] through that cloud guess what I see I
[1:05:06] see the sun shining and I don't care how
[1:05:09] dark it would be how great the storm
[1:05:11] would be if you can get above the clouds
[1:05:14] you'll find the sun don't look at the
[1:05:16] storm look at the son
[1:05:20] amen you see the devil wants you to see
[1:05:23] your prison house

[1:05:27] prison house come on somebody I'm
[1:05:29] telling you he wants you to see the bars
[1:05:31] on the door of your prison house but
[1:05:34] what he don't want you to see is that
[1:05:36] door has been
[1:05:40] opened
[1:05:44] hallelujah
[1:05:46] hallelujah
[1:05:48] hallelujah oh my thank you
[1:05:52] Lord notice
[1:05:54] the Red Sea was a water
[1:05:59] problem and God fixed
[1:06:03] it so if our God can fix one water
[1:06:07] problem can he fix
[1:06:10] another if he can take care of one water
[1:06:13] problem can't he take care of another
[1:06:15] notice the Red Sea and the bitter water
[1:06:18] was both water
[1:06:21] problems what are you saying I'm saying
[1:06:24] this if he can heal skin
[1:06:26] cancer he can heal bone cancer liver
[1:06:29] cancer breast cancer brain cancer if he
[1:06:31] can bring one prodal home he can bring
[1:06:33] all prodal
[1:06:36] home if he can fix one marriage he can
[1:06:38] fix yours if he delivered you once has
[1:06:41] he ever delivered you if he delivered
[1:06:43] you once cannot he do it
[1:06:47] again I say yes he can I say yes he
[1:06:53] can
[1:06:54] but all they saw was death and bitter
[1:06:58] undrinkable water in a desert place and
[1:07:02] the people mumedi the very ones that was
[1:07:06] shouting and beating on tambourines was
[1:07:08] now saying what are we supposed to drink
[1:07:11] Moses what shall we
[1:07:16] drink following a prophet's message
[1:07:19] where's that
[1:07:21] goddess the people murmured against
[1:07:23] Moses saying what shall we drink you see
[1:07:28] think God was leading him to the
[1:07:30] promised land that he said was
[1:07:33] theirs God don't change his mind about
[1:07:35] his word if God said it God will do it
[1:07:39] listen to me God don't keep his word 99
[1:07:41] times out of 100 but the prophet said
[1:07:43] 100 times out of a 100 God will keep his
[1:07:50] word men may lie to you governments M
[1:07:53] lay to you politicians May lie to you
[1:07:56] preachers May lie to you come on
[1:07:57] somebody but the word of God will never
[1:08:00] lie to
[1:08:01] [Applause]
[1:08:07] you if a man says thus say the Lord and
[1:08:10] the Lord didn't say it that man's worthy
[1:08:12] of Hell come on somebody cuz you're
[1:08:15] telling God if you say God said it and
[1:08:17] it don't happen you're making God out to
[1:08:18] be a liar and my God don't lie I said my
[1:08:22] God don't lie
[1:08:24] here a few years ago this the Church of
[1:08:26] Christ wanted to come they heard what
[1:08:27] the Lord did for Jessica and they wanted
[1:08:29] to come and debate me about Divine
[1:08:31] Healing I said boys you come too late to
[1:08:34] tell me that you come too late to tell
[1:08:36] me God don't open blinded eyes and make
[1:08:38] the lame walk you've come too
[1:08:40] late they said well God don't do that no
[1:08:42] more I said I'm sorry that your God Is
[1:08:45] So puny that he can't heal but my God
[1:08:48] hallelujah my God could still heal he
[1:08:51] can still deliver he can raise the Dead
[1:08:53] he can cast out Devils come on somebody
[1:08:56] that's my God
[1:08:59] today
[1:09:03] Hallelujah God was leading him to the
[1:09:06] land that he always said was THS he'd
[1:09:09] already said it's your
[1:09:12] land then why why would he not bypass
[1:09:17] the bitter
[1:09:20] water wasn't it Phillip was it philli
[1:09:23] that was caught up in that that that
[1:09:25] great
[1:09:26] Revival and he went out into the desert
[1:09:28] to find that unic wasn't that Phillip
[1:09:32] and didn't the spirit of the Lord after
[1:09:33] he witnessed to this Ethiopian and
[1:09:36] Ethiopia took the word of God back to
[1:09:37] his people didn't the spirit of God
[1:09:39] catch that man away and I think one
[1:09:42] place the prophet said he showed up in
[1:09:44] the city of zotus or something like that
[1:09:46] something like 29 miles
[1:09:48] away that's a pretty good trip right
[1:09:52] there so if God could lift up one man
[1:09:55] and set him in another place can he lift
[1:09:58] up two
[1:10:00] million so why didn't God just lift them
[1:10:02] up and place them in the
[1:10:05] land why the bitter water why wouldn't
[1:10:08] he bypass that land but you see he led
[1:10:11] them right straight to that bitter
[1:10:15] water but where the Israelites didn't
[1:10:17] see a way where they didn't see a way
[1:10:21] God
[1:10:22] did the test for the isites was a
[1:10:26] question of
[1:10:28] faith in what they couldn't
[1:10:32] see you see if you understand something
[1:10:34] and see something and figure it out that
[1:10:36] ain't Faith that's
[1:10:39] knowledge and God was wanting
[1:10:42] Israel to see not with the eyes of their
[1:10:45] head but with the eyes of their
[1:10:50] hearts the prophet said in look into the
[1:10:52] Unseen he said we we are told we have an
[1:10:54] outer man and an inner man and the outer
[1:10:57] man looks by his eyes and the inner man
[1:10:59] walks by faith so we have to be led by
[1:11:02] one of these two persons the outside
[1:11:04] outer man is South but the inner man is
[1:11:07] God and the Bible says in 2 Corinthians
[1:11:10] 5:7 for we walk by faith and not by
[1:11:14] sight you see you can either walk by
[1:11:17] faith or you can walk by sight but you
[1:11:19] cannot walk by both at the same time and
[1:11:22] God was wanting to to look with the eyes
[1:11:24] of their heart not what they saw with
[1:11:27] their
[1:11:29] head you see without the bitter Waters
[1:11:32] there would have been no opportunity for
[1:11:35] God to perform a miracle that
[1:11:39] day see you got to understand that every
[1:11:42] Miracle every Miracle starts with a
[1:11:47] problem well brother Dar I've got a
[1:11:49] problem you're a candidate for a
[1:11:52] miracle
[1:11:54] we live in such a Negative age
[1:11:56] everything's
[1:12:00] Negative they call her red light a stop
[1:12:02] light why do they call it a stop light
[1:12:04] you go as much as you stop unless they
[1:12:05] call it a go
[1:12:07] light
[1:12:10] absolutely well
[1:12:15] glory
[1:12:16] amen but you see without a problem there
[1:12:20] could be no
[1:12:21] Miracle there have been no opportunity
[1:12:23] for God to perform a miracle that day
[1:12:26] and the most difficult situations in our
[1:12:28] life are opportunities for God to do the
[1:12:32] miraculous and to turn our bitter
[1:12:35] situations
[1:12:37] sweet to show us just how great he is
[1:12:42] that's
[1:12:45] right you see the
[1:12:47] murmurings against God what did it do it
[1:12:51] made Moses C cry out to God yes notice
[1:12:55] while ago when we read about Jonah he
[1:12:58] cried out to God but why did he cry out
[1:13:00] to God he said I cried out to God by
[1:13:03] reason of my
[1:13:05] afflictions and many times I wonder if
[1:13:08] God don't allow things to come into our
[1:13:09] life so that we'll cry out to
[1:13:12] him because you know as well as I do
[1:13:14] none of us pray like we should when
[1:13:16] everything's going good you might as
[1:13:18] well say Amen or out you know it's the
[1:13:20] truth we're all human
[1:13:25] but the murmuring against God made Moses
[1:13:27] cry out and if you want to have your
[1:13:30] Mariah if you want to have your
[1:13:32] bitterness healed then take the case To
[1:13:35] God In Prayer you see God begins by
[1:13:39] making us
[1:13:41] begin the people complain to Moses Moses
[1:13:44] took the complaint to his
[1:13:46] master in all the trials of her life in
[1:13:49] all the testings in our life the surest
[1:13:52] way to have victory
[1:13:54] is through
[1:13:57] prayer the prophet said prayer is the
[1:13:59] most powerful weapon ever placed into
[1:14:02] the hand of human beings the power of
[1:14:05] prayer man nor demon can stand before
[1:14:11] prayer H is that not true is that true
[1:14:15] buddy in India when there's a cyclone
[1:14:17] coming is that not true that they even
[1:14:19] put it in the paper miraculously this
[1:14:22] city survived
[1:14:24] why because some Believers was on their
[1:14:26] knees crying out to God it didn't even
[1:14:30] rain the power of prayer to th
[1:14:33] Hallelujah to turn a
[1:14:41] storm man nor demon can stand before
[1:14:43] your prayer well brother Daryl I can't
[1:14:46] pray like brother Matt and I can't pray
[1:14:47] like brother Mark and I can't pray like
[1:14:49] brother Joe I can't listen to me ain't
[1:14:51] nobody can pray like you can
[1:14:55] pray God built each of us the way he
[1:14:57] wants to use us and we'll deal with
[1:14:59] things brother Joe in our life we will
[1:15:01] deal with things that others may never
[1:15:03] have to deal with but God will allow
[1:15:05] those things to come to mold us in a way
[1:15:08] that he wants to use
[1:15:13] us prayer is more powerful the prophet
[1:15:17] said than an atomic
[1:15:21] bomb you know they Dr an atomic bomb in
[1:15:24] World War II on Hiroshima and nakasaki I
[1:15:27] believe it's how you say
[1:15:28] it and even today there are people being
[1:15:32] born with birth defects from the
[1:15:34] radiation of those two bombs 70 some
[1:15:38] years later people are still being
[1:15:40] affected by a bomb that was dropped
[1:15:42] before many of us in this building was
[1:15:44] ever
[1:15:45] born and if an atomic bomb can do that
[1:15:48] what can your prayer do when the prophet
[1:15:50] said your prayer is more powerful than
[1:15:52] an atomic B
[1:15:53] [Applause]

[1:21:12] could and people will put so much well
[1:21:15] my doctor said this and the doctor said
[1:21:19] that and listen sometimes the doctor's
[1:21:21] report is
[1:21:23] 100%
[1:21:26] correct and sometimes it ain't
[1:21:30] that's we had a man that came in for a
[1:21:32] prostate
[1:21:34] test and they called him up and said sir
[1:21:36] you have prostate cancer you need to
[1:21:39] come in so we can get started on it he
[1:21:41] said well I've got a cattle farm down
[1:21:43] here in Greenville said I need a few
[1:21:44] days to get somebody take care of my
[1:21:45] cattle they said well get it took care
[1:21:47] of you need to come in we need to get
[1:21:48] started on your treatment the man writes
[1:21:51] a note to his family and he says I would
[1:21:53] rather die by a bullet than die from
[1:21:57] cancer and he goes out into his field
[1:22:00] and he takes his own
[1:22:03] life 3 days after the funeral the
[1:22:06] hospital called his family and said we
[1:22:07] made a terrible
[1:22:09] mistake the report that was on your
[1:22:11] husband's chart belonged to someone else
[1:22:14] your husband has no cancer at all but he
[1:22:18] believed the doctor's report he believed
[1:22:21] it to the point he took his own
[1:22:25] life but just think if he'd have took
[1:22:27] that belief and turned it towards God's
[1:22:29] promise how much better off he would
[1:22:31] have
[1:22:33] been so what do you saying I'm saying
[1:22:35] this sometimes doctors are
[1:22:37] right sometimes they ain't they do the
[1:22:39] best that they can
[1:22:41] do but there's another report called
[1:22:44] Isaiah's
[1:22:46] report Hallelujah and that report has
[1:22:50] never been wrong
[1:22:53] [Applause]
[1:22:58] Hallelujah the doctor's report are
[1:23:00] Isaiah's report whose report will you
[1:23:02] believe as for me in my house We Shall
[1:23:05] Believe the report of the
[1:23:07] Lord his report says I'm Healed his
[1:23:10] report says I'm sealed I will believe
[1:23:12] God's
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:15] report oh brother I hear what you're
[1:23:17] saying but my problem my problem you
[1:23:20] don't understand my problem listen
[1:23:23] you may not see the sweet and the bitter
[1:23:25] yet but hold on and have faith God works
[1:23:30] all things good to bring about the
[1:23:33] sweet according to Romans
[1:23:36] 8:28 all things work to the
[1:23:40] good even we don't understand why and
[1:23:44] many times God don't even ask us to
[1:23:46] understand why he just says can you
[1:23:50] trust me TR that's good I remember the
[1:23:54] night of the accident when two of my
[1:23:55] family was killed and my baby was laying
[1:23:58] up there dying and my wife was so upset
[1:23:59] she was shaking her I could still see it
[1:24:01] in my mind her hands was shaking I went
[1:24:03] and got a garbage can so she could throw
[1:24:04] up she was so sick at her stomach and
[1:24:06] she was crying she said I don't
[1:24:08] understand she said you're going all the
[1:24:10] time preaching you're never
[1:24:13] home and God would do this to us God
[1:24:16] would allow us to go through this she
[1:24:18] said I don't
[1:24:21] understand and I grabbed her by the
[1:24:23] hands I said listen honey I don't
[1:24:24] understand either but sometimes God
[1:24:27] don't ask us to
[1:24:29] understand he just says can you trust me
[1:24:33] can you trust your
[1:24:34] God he makes no
[1:24:38] mistakes and if you can trust him even
[1:24:40] though you don't understand it if you
[1:24:42] can trust him there comes a
[1:24:46] release there comes a
[1:24:50] release oh God
[1:24:55] amen the next time you come into your
[1:24:58] moral the next time you come into that
[1:25:00] desert place instead of
[1:25:03] panicking have faith that the god you
[1:25:06] serve is the god who will turn the
[1:25:08] bitter water sweet for you for the glory
[1:25:12] of his name you see in the desert places
[1:25:15] God shows his greatest power in desert
[1:25:17] places comes the greatest
[1:25:20] Miracles God chose them to bring them to
[1:25:22] a place where they had to rely on and
[1:25:25] trust him
[1:25:27] completely completely instead of looking
[1:25:30] to the water for life he wanted them to
[1:25:33] look to him you see if they would have
[1:25:35] come up on the water and a drank the
[1:25:37] water they would have gave God praise
[1:25:40] but it was nothing like
[1:25:42] this he didn't want them just to see the
[1:25:45] water he wanted them to see just how
[1:25:48] great he
[1:25:51] is do you trust God this morning to
[1:25:53] deliver you to carry you through the
[1:25:55] Israelites didn't see the water they
[1:25:57] could drink they didn't see that but God
[1:25:59] did God saw the sweet in the bitterness
[1:26:02] you say how because he provided
[1:26:05] it in a desert Place God shows his
[1:26:09] greatest
[1:26:12] power Luke 9:12 says when they begin to
[1:26:15] wear away they came 12 and said unto him
[1:26:17] send the multitude away that they may go
[1:26:19] into the towns and the countries and
[1:26:20] round about and lodge and get fiddles
[1:26:23] for we are in a desert
[1:26:25] place that means a Wilderness desert
[1:26:28] desolate solitary lonely desolate
[1:26:33] uninhabited you see the Jesus Took the
[1:26:36] disciples out into the desert to get
[1:26:38] some rest but word got out where they
[1:26:39] were going to be and when they got there
[1:26:41] there was a multitude of people waiting
[1:26:43] already in the desert waiting on them
[1:26:45] and the Bible said that there was 5,000
[1:26:47] not counting men not counting women and
[1:26:51] children
[1:26:52] and after a long day of
[1:26:54] services it was getting evening time and
[1:26:56] the disciples come to the master and
[1:26:58] said Lord send these people away we have
[1:27:01] nothing to feed them with we're out here
[1:27:03] in a desert place we have nothing send
[1:27:06] them into the town that they can find
[1:27:07] loding that they can find
[1:27:11] food and Jesus said go among
[1:27:15] them and find something to feed them
[1:27:20] with and so they go Go Out Among the
[1:27:23] people and what do they find they find a
[1:27:25] little
[1:27:27] boy and they come up the little boy and
[1:27:29] he's holding this bag in his hand and if
[1:27:32] I remember I think the prophet said
[1:27:34] something like he slipped out of school
[1:27:35] and went over the mountain saw the meat
[1:27:36] and went down there to see what was
[1:27:37] going on he was
[1:27:40] curious anyhow he was at the meeting and
[1:27:43] he had this bag and it come up to the
[1:27:45] little fella said hey buddy what you got
[1:27:47] in that
[1:27:48] bag he said it's my
[1:27:51] lunch
[1:27:52] your lunch yes sir five biscuits two
[1:27:56] fish just enough for a little
[1:27:59] boy well what are you going to do with
[1:28:03] it eat
[1:28:05] it I said
[1:28:07] well would you be willing to give that
[1:28:10] lunch to
[1:28:14] Jesus what's Jesus want with my
[1:28:17] lunch he's going to feed this multitude
[1:28:31] Jesus is going to feed this multitude
[1:28:34] with my
[1:28:36] lunch you see as long as he held it in
[1:28:38] his hand it was just a little boy's
[1:28:40] lunch right but when he gave it to Jesus
[1:28:43] Look what Jesus was able to do with it
[1:28:45] as long as you hold that problem in your
[1:28:47] hand it's your problem as long as you
[1:28:49] hold that fear in your hand it's your
[1:28:50] fear but if you can give that back to
[1:28:52] Jesus just see what he's able to do with
[1:28:54] it give that diabetes to him give that
[1:28:58] back trouble to him give that glyos come
[1:29:00] on give that sorrow to
[1:29:03] [Applause]
[1:29:06] him he wants to feed this multitude with
[1:29:09] my lunch you see brother and sister God
[1:29:11] don't need something
[1:29:12] big he just needs something
[1:29:16] yielded and little as much of God is in
[1:29:20] it
[1:29:24] so Jesus took
[1:29:25] it and he blessed it and he fed
[1:29:31] 5,000 you see in that desert place I'm
[1:29:34] coming to a close they were fixing to
[1:29:35] see just how great their God was for in
[1:29:38] that desert place come A great
[1:29:41] miracle they were tired they were weary
[1:29:43] they were hungry and he fed them the
[1:29:45] children of Israel were tired and weary
[1:29:47] and thirsty and he gave them Sweet Water
[1:29:51] you may be in your your desert place
[1:29:52] this morning you may have arrived in the
[1:29:55] land of bitter
[1:29:57] water but maybe you're there maybe
[1:30:00] you're there right now for your greatest
[1:30:04] Miracle you see in that desert place in
[1:30:08] your land of Mora why don't you do like
[1:30:12] Moses and cry out to God Amen and let
[1:30:16] God show you a tree that's always been
[1:30:20] here on
[1:30:22] that's you say what tree is that it's
[1:30:25] calvary's tree you see calvary's tree
[1:30:28] holds the answer to every problem
[1:30:32] Calvary is where he paid the price to
[1:30:35] have the ability to turn your bitter
[1:30:38] Waters to
[1:30:40] Sweet Sweet Water in a bitter
[1:30:45] land David said in Psalms 138:7 though I
[1:30:49] walk in the midst of trouble
[1:30:52] thou wil revive me Thou shalt stretch
[1:30:55] forth thine hand against the wrath of my
[1:30:57] enemies and thy right hand shall save
[1:31:02] me though I walk in the midst of my
[1:31:05] troubles thou will revive me that R
[1:31:07] revived means to live to have life to
[1:31:10] remain alive to sustain to Quicken am to
[1:31:13] be quickened to be restored to be
[1:31:15] revived from sickness from
[1:31:17] discouragement from faintness from
[1:31:19] death notice David did say if I walk in
[1:31:23] the midst of trouble he said though I
[1:31:26] walk in the midst of my trouble David
[1:31:28] had an understanding that there will be
[1:31:33] trouble but in the midst of all of our
[1:31:36] trouble he said he will revive me in the
[1:31:40] times of my
[1:31:42] troubles in the land of bitter Waters he
[1:31:45] shall make my water
[1:31:50] sweet when my mama was dying of cancer
[1:31:53] she said something I'll never
[1:31:56] forget she said
[1:31:58] darl I may have cancer but cancer does
[1:32:03] not have
[1:32:07] me brother man I may have all kinds of
[1:32:10] troubles I may have troubles that you
[1:32:12] don't even know about that I've not even
[1:32:14] shared with you but in all my troubles
[1:32:16] in all my
[1:32:19] pain it does not have
[1:32:23] me it does not have
[1:32:29] you he promised he promised he would
[1:32:33] revive
[1:32:35] us the prophet said I think of a lot of
[1:32:37] times today the reason we get into typ
[1:32:39] places listen as we close we get into
[1:32:41] typ places is God wants to reveal and to
[1:32:44] show us his
[1:32:47] love and to prove to us that he's the
[1:32:50] same God yesterday today and forever and
[1:32:54] his power is still the same certainly he
[1:32:58] wants to show us his power he likes to
[1:33:02] manifest his power maybe that's why you
[1:33:05] got sick maybe that's why you got sick
[1:33:09] he wants to show you his
[1:33:14] love a Wonder working
[1:33:19] God I don't care what kind of problem
[1:33:21] you have today don't you sit here and
[1:33:24] tell me that my God can't do something
[1:33:26] about it don't you tell me he can't do

[1:33:43] that we'd seen the Lord do took a little
[1:33:45] thought on the witness of his majesty
