[36:01] thankful tonight.
[36:03] He looked
[36:05] beyond
[36:08] all my faults and he saw my needs.
[36:17] And I shall
[36:20] forever
[36:24] lift
[36:26] my eyes to C. Calary
[36:33] to view the cross
[36:39] where Jesus
[36:42] died
[36:43] for me.
[36:49] How marvelous,
[36:54] the grace
[36:56] that caught my falling
[37:01] soul.
[37:04] He looked
[37:06] me home.
[37:09] All my faults and his fault. Oh, let's
[37:13] all stand and sing the second verse as
[37:15] we invite our brother Andrew to come.
[37:19] It was God's grace
[37:25] that brought me out
[37:29] of darkness
[37:35] into
[37:36] the light
[37:40] where I
[37:43] &gt;&gt; can clearly
[37:45] sing.
[37:48] Oh, how shout
[37:51] it from
[37:55] the mountains
[37:57] and the valleyies.
[38:04] Oh, he looked
[38:06] behind
[38:09] all my faults and he saw my need.
[38:17] Oh, just worship him now. I shall
[38:21] forever
[38:25] lift
[38:27] my eyes to calary
[38:34] to you. the cross
[38:40] where my Jesus
[38:42] died
[38:44] for me.
[38:49] How
[38:51] the love,
[38:55] the grace that caught my falling
[39:01] soul.
[39:04] He looked
[39:06] behold
[39:09] all my faults and he saw
[39:14] my Oh, sing the chorus again now.
[39:18] And I shall
[39:21] forever
[39:25] lift
[39:27] mine eyes to calary.
[39:32] Oh, aren't you thankful for the cross to
[39:34] view
[39:36] the cross? Jesus
[39:42] died
[39:44] for me.
[39:49] How long
[39:55] the grace that called my falling
[40:00] soul.
[40:04] He looked beyond
[40:09] all my faults
[40:12] and saw
[40:13] my need.
[40:17] Amen. How many's thankful tonight for
[40:19] that? Amen. You're thankful for the
[40:21] grace of God that could Amen. look
[40:23] beyond all of our mistakes and all of
[40:25] our failures. And Amen. He he looked
[40:28] beyond all of that to find that part of
[40:30] himself that he deposited on the inside
[40:32] of us. And amen, I tell you, I don't
[40:35] know, I was listening to the prophet of
[40:36] God today as he was speaking and he was
[40:38] talking about the grace of God that
[40:40] comes into the life of a believer and he
[40:43] said, you know, there's something about
[40:44] it. He said, when the spirit of the Lord
[40:45] begins to reveal that word, he said,
[40:47] then there's something inside of that
[40:49] believer that begins to scream grace,
[40:51] grace. Amen. Grace, grace under the
[40:53] things. And I tell you tonight, the
[40:55] things that we hear, the things that we
[40:56] see, the things that we believe on a on
[40:59] a daily basis, we ought to be crying out
[41:01] grace, grace. Amen. and that you would
[41:03] allow me to see these things. How many's
[41:05] thankful for it tonight? Amen. There's a
[41:07] lot of people in the world, but God
[41:09] chose us and we want to take this
[41:11] opportunity tonight to thank him. Maybe
[41:13] we could just bow our hearts here
[41:14] tonight for a word of prayer. I wonder
[41:16] how many would have a special need upon
[41:18] your heart. Something that you would
[41:20] just desire from the King of Grace
[41:21] tonight to do for you. I know he sees
[41:24] every hand. He knows every need.
[41:25] Tonight, let's just approach him.
[41:27] Heavenly Father, Lord, as your believers
[41:30] have gathered here on this Wednesday
[41:31] afternoon, Father, we've not gathered
[41:33] here out of ritual or out of tradition,
[41:35] Father. But Lord, we've gathered here
[41:37] tonight because we're your sons and your
[41:39] daughters. And Lord, Father, we are
[41:42] longing on the inside of our hearts
[41:43] tonight to fellowship with you, Lord, to
[41:46] hear your word, to feel your spirit, oh
[41:48] God. Lord, to feel your presence as it
[41:51] was moving among your congregation
[41:53] through the song service. Lord, we were
[41:55] so thankful, Lord, to know that the
[41:57] angels of God are already in attendance
[41:59] in this meeting tonight. Now, Father, as
[42:01] we endeavor to look into your word, I
[42:03] pray you would send the spirit of wisdom
[42:05] and revelation into the building
[42:07] tonight, Lord, I pray you would bind
[42:09] every spirit of unbelief, oh God. Lord,
[42:12] you would bind every spirit of
[42:13] discouragement, Lord. Ever every spirit
[42:15] of of of hindrance, Father, I pray you
[42:18] would drive it out of the building
[42:19] tonight, dear God. Lord, these are your
[42:21] eagles and they've come to fellowship
[42:23] around the carcass of your word. And
[42:25] Lord, maybe some would be sick here
[42:27] tonight. Lord, I know there's healing in
[42:29] this carcass. Maybe some would be bound.
[42:31] I know there's deliverance, Lord. And
[42:33] Father, maybe some would be discouraged.
[42:35] I I am a firm believer that there's
[42:38] encouragement in this word tonight. Now,
[42:40] Lord, may you may you move among us in a
[42:42] special way, Lord. We surrender our
[42:44] hearts into you, our minds. Forgive us
[42:46] of our failures, Lord. forgive us of our
[42:48] shortcomings, oh God. And Lord, may we
[42:51] not just leave here tonight with a good
[42:52] feeling, Lord, or with just a just a
[42:54] better idea about the things that we'll
[42:56] look at, but may we leave here tonight
[42:58] transformed, oh God. And Lord, be made
[43:00] into that image that you would have of
[43:02] us. Lord, be with those that are away
[43:04] that are traveling, dear God. May you
[43:06] keep your hand of protection upon them,
[43:08] Lord. Our pastor, Lord, and his his
[43:10] wife, they're away on a getaway. Father,
[43:12] may you be with them, Lord. May you may
[43:14] you just may you just move in a special
[43:16] way among us tonight. and maybe some
[43:18] listening at home tonight unable to be
[43:20] here. Lord, I pray you would minister to
[43:22] them as well. For it's in the mighty
[43:24] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[43:25] Christ, we pray. And all the believers
[43:28] says, "Amen." Amen. Surely, we can do
[43:32] better than that. And all the believers
[43:33] said,
[43:34] &gt;&gt; "Amen." Amen. God bless you tonight. We
[43:36] greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[43:38] Christ. While you're standing with us
[43:40] tonight, we want to go to the book of
[43:41] St. John. The book of St. John, the 12th
[43:44] chapter. I want to say it is a real
[43:46] honor to be home tonight and to be
[43:47] speaking to you. We thank our pastor for
[43:49] this opportunity tonight and sure good
[43:52] to see everyone out in the house of God
[43:53] on this on this cold Wednesday evening.
[43:56] A but I I believe the fire of God is
[43:58] burning on the inside and amen. I just
[44:00] want to just want to take this
[44:01] opportunity tonight to say how much we
[44:03] love and appreciate each and every one
[44:05] of you and amen your your faithfulness
[44:07] and your attendance and support of the
[44:09] work of the Lord and Amen. And I know
[44:11] some are driving um um up to an hour,
[44:13] hour and a half to be here on a
[44:14] Wednesday evening. We say God bless you
[44:16] all tonight. Amen. We just pray the Lord
[44:18] will will speak to your hearts tonight
[44:20] in the book of St. John the 12th
[44:22] chapter. And I just want to read one
[44:25] verse. St. John chapter 12 and verse
[44:28] number 32. Uh Jesus here speaking. It's
[44:31] a very very familiar scripture. He says,
[44:34] "And I if I be lifted up from the
[44:37] earth," now I want you to notice how he
[44:39] says this. He doesn't say this plural.
[44:41] He says this singular. And I, if I be
[44:45] lifted up from the earth, will draw all
[44:48] men, now notice here again, unto me. Not
[44:52] plural, but unto me, singular. If I be
[44:55] lifted up from the earth, will draw all
[44:58] men unto me. We ask the Lord this
[45:00] evening to bless the reading of his
[45:02] word. as you can have your seats here
[45:03] this evening. I I want to tonight by the
[45:05] help of the Lord for just a few moments
[45:07] tonight uh if I would if I would take a
[45:09] title this evening. I want to speak to
[45:11] you on this uh spiritual concentration.
[45:14] Spiritual concentration and maybe uh to
[45:17] pull a little something out of that. I
[45:18] want to talk to you on this concentrated
[45:21] on the attraction. Amen. Concentrated on
[45:23] the attraction. You know uh there in St.
[45:26] John 12 and verse 32, Jesus very
[45:29] emphatically says unto us, "And I, if I
[45:32] be lifted up from the earth, will draw
[45:35] all men unto me." Now, when you look
[45:37] there at that word lifted, it means to
[45:39] lift up on high. It means to exalt. It
[45:41] means to raise uh to the very summit of
[45:44] of of magnifying and prosperity. It
[45:47] means to exalt. It means to raise to
[45:50] dignity, to honor, and to happiness.
[45:52] there. That word draw, it means to drag
[45:55] off. It means to draw, amen, by an
[45:58] inward power. It means to lead. It means
[46:00] to impale. So here, amen, our Lord Jesus
[46:03] is saying, "If I, Amen, will be lifted
[46:06] up. If I will be exalted, if I will be
[46:09] raised up on high, then I will lead,
[46:11] Amen, or I will draw all men unto
[46:14] myself." Brother Ram said, "Every man,
[46:16] Amen, that really feels that tug of the
[46:18] Holy Spirit, Amen, will lay aside
[46:21] everything else and run to him." Amen.
[46:24] If you really get to needing it bad
[46:26] enough, if it comes between death and
[46:28] life, he says you'll move no matter what
[46:30] anybody says. Amen. You must get to
[46:33] Jesus. It's between life and death, and
[46:36] you must find him right quick. Now, I'll
[46:39] just say this tonight. Whatever uh is
[46:41] being lifted before the people, amen, is
[46:44] is is the drawing power. Amen. Whatever
[46:46] is being exalted or whatever is being
[46:48] put before the people high enough, amen,
[46:51] where they can see it, then that amen,
[46:53] is the drawing power. And the prophet of
[46:55] God would say in the Easter Seal, he
[46:57] says, I am wondering today it's what's
[46:59] happening. Amen. Are we really getting
[47:01] the people to God? He said, are we just
[47:04] getting them to church? He said, now
[47:05] watch, we must get them to Christ. Amen.
[47:09] where the quickening power is again in
[47:12] going beyond the camp. He says, "More
[47:14] and more I am made to believe, amen,
[47:17] that people are not getting to Christ."
[47:19] Now, I'm here to try to help in every
[47:21] way that I can and make my statement as
[47:23] clear as I know how to make them, and
[47:25] you suffer with me if you will. He said,
[47:27] "As I look and preach across the
[47:29] nation," he says, "I'm watching the
[47:31] people and I am fully persuaded," amen,
[47:34] that the people are not getting to
[47:36] Christ. He says, "I believe the enemy
[47:39] has thrown the hindrance." See, because
[47:41] the reason I believe this, he is not the
[47:44] object that they have been pointed to.
[47:47] See, they have either been pointed to a
[47:49] dogma or to a doctrine or to a party or
[47:52] to an experience or a sensation or
[47:54] something like that. Amen. Instead of
[47:57] being pointed to Christ, AMEN. AND
[48:00] CHRIST is the word. Now, amen. I can say
[48:03] to you tonight what the prophet of God
[48:04] said. He said, "The message, amen, is
[48:07] Christ and Christ is the word." Now,
[48:10] amen. The inspiration of this thought,
[48:12] it just struck me here the other day as
[48:14] I was listening to the sermon, "What is
[48:15] the attraction on the mountain?" And
[48:17] brother Bram's getting ready to turn to
[48:18] his text. And right there in paragraph
[48:20] 27, he just says a little something. He
[48:23] says, "Now, so I've got my mind, amen,
[48:26] set on this message." That's that third
[48:28] pull. Amen. It's the one that I must be
[48:32] loyal and reverent to. Now, I want you
[48:34] to watch this. Amen. My mind is set on
[48:37] that third pull. It's not the three or
[48:40] the second, but it's the one. Amen. That
[48:42] I must be loyal and reverent to. Now, in
[48:45] the in the morning service, he
[48:47] identifies, and I'm going to maybe let
[48:48] at another time go deeper in this on the
[48:50] third pool. But just tonight, just to
[48:52] touch it, in the morning service, he
[48:55] identifies, amen, what those three pools
[48:57] or three turns of his ministry is. He
[49:00] said, "Now see the very day when this
[49:02] messenger," not when he starts on, but
[49:04] when he begins to declare his message.
[49:07] Now see, the first pool was healing. The
[49:09] second pool was prophesying. Amen. But
[49:12] the third pool was the opening of the
[49:14] word. Amen. The mysteries revealed. And
[49:17] there is no more higher order, amen, to
[49:20] the re to reveal the word than prophets,
[49:22] right? Amen. But the only way the
[49:24] prophet can be vindicated is by the
[49:26] word. And listen, remember the third
[49:29] pull, amen, was the opening of them
[49:32] seven seals to reveal the hidden truth
[49:35] that has been sealed in the word. Now,
[49:37] amen, I find it amazing, brother Brian,
[49:39] out of three pools. Amen. The only one
[49:42] you will hear him saying this is on that
[49:45] third pull. So, amen. I BELIEVE THAT IT
[49:47] WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PULL. AMEN. Out
[49:50] of all three pools was that third pull.
[49:52] It was the one he said I must be loyal
[49:54] and reverent to. Amen. I'll say this. I
[49:57] believe it's the one that we as the
[49:59] bride, AMEN, MUST CONCENTRATE ON. AMEN.
[50:02] I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING that we
[50:03] should just let become a term among us
[50:05] or amen, just become a doctrine. BUT IF
[50:08] A PROPHET OF GOD, AMEN, SAID I'VE GOT TO
[50:10] BE LOYAL AND I'VE GOT TO BE REVERENT TO
[50:12] THAT THIRD PULL. AMEN. Then I do not
[50:14] BELIEVE THERE WAS ANY HALF-HEARTEDNESS,
[50:16] AMEN, IN WHAT HE PREACHED ABOUT THAT
[50:18] THIRD PULL. I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS
[50:20] ANY RESERVATION IN his spirit. Amen. To
[50:23] stand there and to declare the things he
[50:25] was saying. Amen. About seven seals and
[50:28] seven thunders. AMEN. THAT I THINK AS
[50:30] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, WE OUGHT TO
[50:32] TURN OUR EYES SOLELY, AMEN. UPON THAT
[50:35] third pull. Amen. And concentrate upon
[50:37] it. Now, when you when you think of that
[50:39] word concentration, it is the action or
[50:42] the power. Amen. A focus in one's
[50:45] attention. Amen. Or mental effort to pay
[50:48] close attention. I love this. IT IS
[50:50] SINGLEMINDEDNESS. AMEN. IT IS
[50:52] ABSORPTION. AMEN. It is engrossment. It
[50:55] is focusing, centering. Amen.
[50:57] Centralization. Amen. It is a direction.
[51:00] Amen. It is dealing with ONE PARTICULAR
[51:03] THING ABOVE ALL OTHERS. AMEN. WHEN YOU
[51:06] BEGIN TO CONCENTRATE ON SOMETHING, AMEN.
[51:08] THERE'S NOT MULTIPLE THINGS THAT'S GOT
[51:10] YOUR ATTENTION. BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE
[51:12] THING THAT'S GOT YOUR ATTENTION. AMEN.
[51:14] AND BY YOU GIVING YOUR ATTENTION UNTO
[51:16] IT. AMEN. YOU HAVE EXALTED IT. AMEN. YOU
[51:19] HAVE ELEVATED IT. YOU HAVE RAISED IT TO
[51:21] A PLACE, AMEN, THAT IT COULD HAVE AN
[51:23] IMPACT UPON your life. My Amen. You will
[51:26] agree that we're living in an hour
[51:27] that's a very scattered hour. Amen. The
[51:29] prophet of God said it beautiful. He
[51:31] said, "It's a day to where people's
[51:33] minds," Amen. are so scattered. How many
[51:36] can agree there? Amen. The minds of
[51:38] people are so scattered. He said, "I
[51:40] FEEL SORRY FOR THEM." LISTEN, THEY DON'T
[51:43] KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE. NOW, come on,
[51:44] church. Amen. It was not under that
[51:46] first pull. Amen. THAT WE FOUND OUT WHAT
[51:49] YOU BELIEVE. IF IT WAS NOT UNDER THAT
[51:50] SECOND PULL THAT WE FOUND OUT WHAT TO
[51:53] BELIEVE, BUT IT WAS UNDER THAT THIRD
[51:54] PULL, the opening of the word, AMEN,
[51:57] THAT AN AUTHORITY OF FAITH COME TO THE
[51:59] CHURCH, AMEN, to believe that this book,
[52:02] AMEN, IS NOT THE IDEAS OF A MAN. IT IT
[52:05] IS NOT THE CREEDS OF THE DENOMINATION.
[52:07] IT IS NOT THE HANDBOOK OF ORGANIZATION,
[52:10] BUT IT IS THE INFALLIBLE WORD OF
[52:12] ALMIGHTY GOD. HEAVENS AND EARTH WILL
[52:14] PASS AWAY. HEY, BUT MY WORD SHALL NEVER
[52:17] PASS AWAY. AND THERE'S A PEOPLE HERE
[52:19] TONIGHT, AMEN, that can stand up on that
[52:21] word. He said, "One says this and one
[52:24] says that." HE SAID, "BUT LET EVERY
[52:26] MAN'S word be a lie." Amen. How many
[52:28] agree? Let every man's word be a lie and
[52:30] let MINE BE TRUE. AMEN. REB SAID, "THE
[52:33] American people, they're they're so
[52:35] scrupled up in their mind." He said,
[52:36] "The American people's the worst
[52:38] confused people I know of in the world."
[52:41] He said, "Religiously speaking," Amen.
[52:43] In Amos 8:1, AMOS PROPHESIED. He said,
[52:47] "Behold, THE DAY COMES." AMEN. SAYAITH
[52:49] THE LORD THAT I WILL SEND A FAMINE IN
[52:52] THE LAND. Now watch. Amen. Who is
[52:54] sending THE FAMINE IN THE LAND? AMEN.
[52:56] The Lord, HE SAID, NOT A FAMINE of
[52:58] bread, NOR A THIRST FOR WATER. AMEN. BUT
[53:00] OF HEARING the word of the Lord. NOW
[53:03] LOOK HERE IN VERSE 12. AND THEY SHALL
[53:05] WONDER. AMEN. AMEN. THAT'S A PART OF THE
[53:07] PROPHECY. THEY SHALL WONDER. THEY SHALL
[53:09] go from sea to sea. They will go from
[53:12] the north even to the east and shall
[53:13] run. Amen. To and fro and seek. Amen.
[53:16] The word of the Lord. Now, HERE'S THE
[53:18] SAD PART. AMEN. AND THEY SHALL NOT FIND
[53:20] IT. NOW, AMEN. AMOS SPOKE THIS THOUSANDS
[53:23] OF YEARS AGO. AMEN. BUT A PROPHET COME
[53:25] IN 1955 and read that scripture AND
[53:28] SAID, "IF THAT DON'T FIT THIS NATION at
[53:30] this time, I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT DOES
[53:33] FIT." He said, "We don't need bread. We
[53:35] got plenty of it." AMEN. WE DON'T NEED
[53:37] WATER. WE GOT PLENTY of it. We got
[53:39] plenty clothes to wear. WE GOT HOUSES TO
[53:41] LIVE IN. HE SAID, "SEE, but it's a
[53:43] famine." Amen. for the hearing OF THE
[53:45] WORD OF GOD. HE SAYS, "A MAN WON'T know
[53:48] what to believe." AMEN. YOU'RE ALL
[53:50] CONFUSED. One says this and one says
[53:53] that and one says this and one says
[53:55] something else. HE SAID, "BUT BASE YOUR
[53:58] THOUGHTS, AMEN. on thus saith the Lord
[54:01] and God will confirm it." He said,
[54:03] "What's the matter with us?" Amen. WE
[54:06] ARE SO DENSE, AMEN, WITH ALL KINDS OF
[54:08] DOCTRINES and everything. He said, "It
[54:10] just can't GET TO US." I love this. We
[54:12] have been churched. Amen. And churched
[54:15] and rechurched and churched and
[54:17] dechurched. Amen. That's pretty
[54:19] powerful. We have been churched and we
[54:21] have been churched and we have been
[54:23] rechurched. How many been there? And you
[54:25] you've been re and deoured. He said in
[54:28] this that and all this and that and you
[54:29] don't know what to believe. Now watch.
[54:31] He said A LITTLE MOVE OF GOD WILL BREAK
[54:33] OUT AND THEY'LL RUN OUT INTO FANATICISM.
[54:35] AND HE SAID WHAT DOES fanaticism do? It
[54:38] paralyzes amen the people. HE SAID,
[54:40] "LORD, WE ARE LIVING in a day when
[54:42] PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT, AMEN, SO hard against
[54:45] this, amen, against you, against your
[54:48] word, amen, against your spirit. The
[54:50] hour WE'RE LIVING IN, FOLKS, AMEN, MEN
[54:52] ARE TEACHING AGAINST GOD. THEY ARE
[54:54] TEACHING AGAINST HIS WORD. They are
[54:56] teaching against his spirit. Amen. And
[54:58] it's causing the people not to know WHAT
[55:00] TO BELIEVE." NOW, YOU ALL know what I'm
[55:02] talking about. Amen. JUST LET A MAN
[55:03] START TEACHING AGAINST THE MOVEMENT OF
[55:05] GOD. AMEN. AND THE HOLY Ghost will COME
[55:07] IN A BUILDING AND WON'T NOBODY KNOW HOW
[55:09] TO RESPOND. AMEN. BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS
[55:12] TAUGHT THEM AGAINST WORSHIPING. AMEN.
[55:14] THE LIVING GOD. AMEN. BUT I DON'T THINK
[55:16] WE OUGHT TO TEACH ANYTHING AGAINST THE
[55:18] WORD. I THINK WE OUGHT TO STAND. AMEN.
[55:20] UPON THUS SAYAITH THE LORD. I BELIEVE
[55:22] HE'S A GOD THAT OUGHT TO BE WORSHIPED. I
[55:25] BELIEVE HE'S A GOD THAT OUGHT TO BE
[55:26] REVERENCED. I BELIEVE HE'S A GOD THAT
[55:28] OUGHT TO BE PRAISED. I DON'T THINK WE
[55:30] OUGHT TO LET SOME MAN, AMEN, TEACH THE
[55:32] POWER OF GOD OUT OF THE CHURCH. I THINK
[55:34] WE OUGHT TO OPEN UP THE DOOR AND WELCOME
[55:36] THE MOVEMENT of the Holy Ghost in the
[55:38] church. Amen. Without any restrictions
[55:41] &gt;&gt; or any hindrances. He says, I believe we
[55:44] are now living in the time, Amen, of a
[55:46] weak and an evil generation. How many
[55:49] knows the Bible said that? Amen. It
[55:51] would be a weak and an evil generation
[55:53] of mixed up, amen, confused theologians.
[55:57] AMEN. AND CHURCHES ALL BUNDLED TOGETHER
[56:00] until the people don't know what to
[56:02] believe. Now, I just have TO SAY THIS
[56:04] TONIGHT. THANK GOD THAT HE HAS PROVIDED,
[56:07] AMEN, A WAY IN THIS LAST DAY, AMEN, TO
[56:10] STRAIGHTEN OUT ALL THE CONFUSION. HE
[56:12] SAID, "BEHOLD, I STAND AT THE DOOR AND
[56:14] KNOCK." AMEN. If any man will hear my
[56:16] voice and will open the door, HE SAYS,
[56:19] "I WILL COME INTO HIM AND I WILL S WITH
[56:22] HIM AND HE WITH ME." YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
[56:24] WORD SUCK MEANS? It means reveal. So, if
[56:27] any MAN WILL OPEN THE DOOR, THEN I WILL
[56:30] COME IN THERE. And said, "WHAT'S HE
[56:32] GOING TO REVEAL?" HE'S GOING TO REVEAL
[56:34] I'M JESUS CHRIST THE SAME. AMEN.
[56:37] YESTERDAY, TODAY, and forever. AMEN.
[56:39] THINK TONIGHT. HOW? AMEN. THEY WERE
[56:41] WALKING THERE on that Emmas road, AND
[56:43] THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID THEIR MINDS WERE
[56:45] BLINDED. AMEN. They didn't know what to
[56:47] believe. He said, "And there's many a
[56:49] PERSON LIKE THAT IN BOWMONT TONIGHT."
[56:51] AMEN. THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
[56:53] BELIEVE. He said, "But you know what
[56:55] they did?" Amen. They did the most
[56:57] wisest thing that any man could do. THEY
[57:00] INVITED HIM IN. THAT'S IT. It's then and
[57:04] then only he can reveal himself. AMEN.
[57:07] WHEN HE IS INVITED TO COME IN. HOW MANY
[57:09] WANTS HIM TO COME IN HERE TONIGHT? AMEN.
[57:11] AMEN. HOW MANY WANTS HIM TO COME IN
[57:13] EVERY SERVICE? AMEN. DO YOU KNOW HOW YOU
[57:15] BRING HIM IN? AMEN. He's already here.
[57:18] Amen. BUT HE'LL ONLY COME WHERE HE'S
[57:20] INVITED AND HE'LL ONLY STAY WHERE HE'S
[57:23] MADE WELCOME. DO YOU KNOW HOW YOU
[57:25] WELCOME THE REVEALER INTO YOUR HEART? IS
[57:28] YOU SAY, "LORD JESUS, I KNOW THE
[57:30] SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT AND I MIGHT NOT
[57:32] UNDERSTAND IT." AMEN. But come INTO MY
[57:35] HEART. I WANT TO ACCEPT YOU. I WANT TO
[57:38] BELIEVE YOU AND THEN MANIFEST YOURSELF
[57:41] TO ME. LISTEN, IF HE DID IT TO THE TWO
[57:43] ON EMMAS, HE CAN DO IT RIGHT HERE
[57:45] TONIGHT. AMEN. BECAUSE IF I WILL BE
[57:48] LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO
[57:51] MYSELF. I WILL LEAD THEM INTO the
[57:54] furtherance of the revelation of the
[57:56] WORD OF GOD. MY TO think tonight he IS
[57:58] HERE AND HE'S NOT HERE JUST TO BE A
[58:00] SPECTATOR. HE'S NOT HERE JUST TO BE AN
[58:03] ONLOOKER. HE is here to TAKE AN ACTIVE
[58:05] PART IN EVERY ASPECT OF THIS SERVICE
[58:08] TONIGHT. YES, SIR. AMEN. I just recently
[58:11] heard someone Amen. THEY MADE A
[58:13] STATEMENT. I really never even heard
[58:14] this term. Amen. But they made a
[58:16] statement. THEY SAID, YOU KNOW, THEY
[58:18] SAID THERE'S A LOT OF DISTRACTIONS going
[58:19] on. And they said all kinds of people
[58:22] are spiritually distracted. Amen. And
[58:24] there's only a few that's spiritually
[58:26] concentrated. AND AND I'LL BE HONEST, I
[58:28] I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS SUCH A TERM
[58:30] as spiritual concentration. But I went
[58:32] on the on the internet there and begin
[58:34] to look it up. And it's actually the
[58:36] practice, amen, of intentionally
[58:38] focusing, amen, THE MIND ON A SACRED
[58:41] OBJECT. It's the meaning or the
[58:43] experience, amen, in order to deepen. Oh
[58:46] God. Amen. WHEN YOU BEGIN TO WHEN YOU
[58:49] BEGIN TO SPIRITUALLY CONCENTRATE ON
[58:51] SOMETHING, AMEN, THE PURPOSE BEHIND WHY
[58:53] YOU'RE DOING IT, AMEN, IS TO DEEPEN,
[58:56] AMEN, YOUR AWARENESS, AMEN, CLARITY, AND
[58:59] IT BRINGS AN inner transformation.
[59:02] Oh, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN.
[59:04] THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "GOD
[59:06] IS AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP." AMEN. AND AND
[59:10] I FOUND THIS AS ITS CORE. AMEN. IT means
[59:13] gathering scattered attention. Amen. and
[59:16] directing it steadily. Amen. Towards
[59:18] what is spiritually essential. Oh church
[59:21] OF THE LIVING GOD, I BELIEVE A RAPTURE
[59:23] IN THIS HOUR IS SPIRITUALLY ESSENTIAL. I
[59:27] BELIEVE HOLY GHOST MEETINGS ARE
[59:28] SPIRITUALLY ESSENTIAL. I BELIEVE SICK
[59:31] BEING HEALED AND LIVES BEING CHANGED AND
[59:33] HEARTS BEING RESTORED. I BELIEVE
[59:36] SITUATIONS BEING FIXED, AMEN, IS
[59:38] SPIRITUALLY ESSENTIAL. WELL, LISTEN.
[59:40] WHAT A MISERABLE bunch of people WE
[59:42] WOULD BE TONIGHT. AMEN. TO HAVE THAT
[59:44] DESIRE AND NOT HAVE THE MEANS by which
[59:47] it would TAKE TO BRING THAT DESIRE TO
[59:49] PASS. BUT I CAN SAY UNTO YOU TONIGHT,
[59:51] AMEN, THAT THIRD PULL was the opening OF
[59:54] THE WORD WHICH WAS THE RELEASING OF THE
[59:57] REVELATION. AMEN. TO BRING EVERYTHING IN
[59:59] GOD'S WORD TO PASS. AMEN. In his
[1:00:02] redeemed believers, amen to think
[1:00:04] tonight the spiritual amen
[1:00:06] concentration. Now, I found it amazing.
[1:00:08] I'm going to go into these more later.
[1:00:10] AMEN. BUT RIGHT HERE, I JUST WANT TO HIT
[1:00:11] IT REAL QUICK. IT INVOLVES SEVERAL
[1:00:13] DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. AMEN. The first one
[1:00:16] is a focused attention. It means you
[1:00:18] choose, amen, a single focus point and
[1:00:22] you repeatedly return to it. Amen. When
[1:00:25] the mind wonders, Amen. When when you
[1:00:27] begin to concentrate on something, AMEN,
[1:00:30] YOU FOUND AN OLD LANDMARK. AMEN. You
[1:00:33] found something that's worth. Amen.
[1:00:35] Giving your attention to. AND WHEN YOUR
[1:00:37] MIND BEGINS TO WONDER, AMEN. you turn ON
[1:00:40] A TAPE. AMEN. WHEN YOUR MIND BEGINS TO
[1:00:42] WANDER, YOU JUST THROW UP YOUR HANDS AND
[1:00:45] YOU BEGIN TO WORSHIP GOD. WHEN YOUR MIND
[1:00:47] BEGINS TO WONDER, YOU JUST BEGIN TO
[1:00:49] REMEMBER ABOUT HIS MERCY AND HIS GRACE
[1:00:52] AND HIS REDEMPTION. COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:00:54] AMEN. HOW MANY CAN TESTIFY SOMETIMES,
[1:00:57] AMEN, THAT YOUR MIND WILL START
[1:00:58] WONDERING AND YOU'LL START WONDERING,
[1:01:00] "AM I EVEN SAVED? DOES GOD REALLY LOVE
[1:01:02] ME? DO I REALLY HAVE THE HOLY GHOST?"
[1:01:05] AMEN. BUT THEN YOUR MIND, AMEN, BEGINS
[1:01:07] TO GO BACK TO THE THING IT SHOULD FOCUS
[1:01:09] ON. AND IT WAS THE DAY THE HOLY GHOST
[1:01:11] CAME. AMEN. And he changed you. AMEN.
[1:01:14] FROM THE INSIDE OUT. AMEN. HE DONE
[1:01:16] SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT NO
[1:01:18] MAN CAN REVERSE.
[1:01:21] AMEN. THAT SPIRITUAL CONCENTRATION.
[1:01:23] BROTHER NO, I FIND IT AMAZING. IT BRINGS
[1:01:25] AN inner stillness. Amen. It is a It is
[1:01:28] an ATTENTION STABILIZER. AMEN. It It
[1:01:31] quietens mental noises. AMEN. NOW LISTEN
[1:01:34] HERE. THOUGHTS MAY STILL ARISE. AMEN.
[1:01:37] But they lose their grip. Amen. It's a
[1:01:40] IT'S A MEANINGFUL INTENTION. It's unlike
[1:01:43] ordinary concentration. AMEN. WHERE
[1:01:46] SOMEBODY'S studying or they're problem
[1:01:48] solving. AMEN. BUT SPIRITUAL
[1:01:50] concentration is oriented towards
[1:01:53] wisdom, insight, devotion, and an
[1:01:56] awakening. AMEN. THIS IS PROBABLY MY
[1:01:58] FAVORITE ONE. AMEN. Spiritual trans
[1:02:00] SPIRITUAL CON CONCENTRATION
[1:02:02] CONCENTRATION RATHER. IT HAS A
[1:02:04] TRANSFORMATIVE EFFECT. AMEN. As one
[1:02:07] BEGINS TO SPIRITUALLY CONCENTRATE, it
[1:02:09] begins to cultivate and it BEGINS TO
[1:02:12] CAUSE TRANSFORMATION. AMEN. Now listen,
[1:02:15] there is a big difference. Amen. IN
[1:02:17] ORDINARY CONCENTRATION, AMEN. AND
[1:02:19] SPIRITUAL CONCENTRATION. Ordinary
[1:02:22] concentration is it's task oriented.
[1:02:25] AMEN. BUT SPIRITUAL CONCENTRATION IS
[1:02:27] IT'S truth oriented. AMEN. ORDINARY
[1:02:31] CONCENTRATION IT ends when the task
[1:02:34] ends. AMEN. BUT SPIRITUAL CONCENTRATION,
[1:02:37] IT AIMS AT LASTING INNER CHANGE. AMEN.
[1:02:40] ORDINARY CONCENTRATION, now listen,
[1:02:42] IT'LL STRENGTHEN THE INTELLECT. AMEN.
[1:02:44] BUT SPIRITUAL CONCENTRATION WILL BRING
[1:02:47] awareness and WILL BRING A TRANSFORMING
[1:02:49] CHARACTER. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD,
[1:02:52] AMEN, THE FOCUS OF THIS MESSAGE, AMEN,
[1:02:55] is to instill, AMEN, THE DIVINE
[1:02:57] CHARACTER OF JESUS CHRIST into every
[1:03:00] believer. HE SAID, "BUY ME GOLD TRIED IN
[1:03:03] THE FIRE AND you and then you will be
[1:03:05] try you'll BE TRULY RICH." RIGHT? AMEN.
[1:03:08] LISTEN to me. Naked physically we came
[1:03:10] into the world. Amen. But naked
[1:03:12] spiritually we will not leave it. Oh no.
[1:03:15] We are going to take something with us.
[1:03:18] Amen. What are what that something is is
[1:03:21] all we can take with us. Listen, there's
[1:03:23] nothing less AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE.
[1:03:26] SO WE HAD BETTER BE REAL CAREFUL NOW.
[1:03:28] AMEN. TO SEE that we are taking
[1:03:30] something that will make us right before
[1:03:32] God. Amen. So then what will he TAKE
[1:03:35] WITH US? BROTHER RAM says we will take
[1:03:37] our character, brother. That is what we
[1:03:40] will take with us. LISTEN, WE'RE NOT
[1:03:42] GOING TO TAKE OUR QUOTE BOOKS. AMEN.
[1:03:44] WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE OUR MP3
[1:03:46] libraries that exist. Amen. We're not
[1:03:48] GOING TO TAKE OUR CELL PHONES. AMEN.
[1:03:50] WE'RE NOT GOING TO PACK UP OUR OUR
[1:03:52] BIBLES AND ALL OF OUR STUDY BOOKS. AMEN.
[1:03:54] THE ONLY THING WE'RE GOING TO TAKE,
[1:03:56] AMEN, IS THE CHARACTER THAT HAS BEEN
[1:03:58] DEVELOPED ON THE INSIDE OF US BY
[1:04:00] FOCUSING ON WHAT'S IN THOSE BOOKS AND BY
[1:04:03] FOCUSING ON WHAT'S IN THOSE TAPES. MY
[1:04:06] NOW WHAT KIND OF CHARACTER WILL YOU TAKE
[1:04:08] WITH YOU? Will it be like his whose
[1:04:11] character was molded by suffering in the
[1:04:13] fiery furnace of affliction? Or will it
[1:04:15] be the softness of this characterless
[1:04:18] way of seeing people? It is up to each
[1:04:20] one of us. For in that day every man,
[1:04:23] AMEN, WILL BEAR HIS OWN BURDEN. NOW,
[1:04:26] AMEN. I'm talking HERE TO YOU TONIGHT,
[1:04:27] AMEN, ABOUT THIS SPIRITUAL
[1:04:29] CONCENTRATION, ABOUT THIS STILLNESS.
[1:04:31] NOW, AMEN. HOW CAN I SPEAK OF THIS and
[1:04:34] not look in Psalms 46 and10 when David
[1:04:37] SCREAMED OUT, "BE STILL." AMEN. And know
[1:04:40] THAT I AM GOD. LISTEN WHAT HE SAYS. I
[1:04:43] WILL BE EXALTED AMONG THE HEATHEN, AND I
[1:04:46] will be EXALTED IN THE EARTH. COME ON.
[1:04:49] THAT'S THE SAME ONE THAT SPOKE IN JOHN
[1:04:51] 12. BROTHER ROYAN SAID, "IF I WILL BE
[1:04:54] LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO
[1:04:57] MYSELF." AMEN. I FIND TONIGHT, AMEN,
[1:05:00] THAT THE STILLNESS OF THE HOLY GHOST,
[1:05:02] AMEN, is the pathway, Amen, that leads
[1:05:04] to divine knowledge. Amen. I think of
[1:05:07] how brother Ram was speaking there in
[1:05:09] 1957 of blind Barnameus in his healing.
[1:05:12] And he said Jesus stood still. I love
[1:05:15] that. And said, "Bring him here." Oh,
[1:05:18] brother Jesus stood still and they
[1:05:20] BROUGHT THE BEGGAR TO HIM. HE SAID,
[1:05:22] "NOW, HIS FAITH HAD STOPPED THE SON of
[1:05:24] God and brought him to a standpoint,
[1:05:27] amen, TO A STILL STOP." AND I SAY
[1:05:30] TONIGHT, I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE, WHAT
[1:05:32] YOUR NAME IS, HOW POOR YOU ARE, HOW FAR
[1:05:35] YOU'VE GONE, YOUR FAITH WILL bring God,
[1:05:38] AMEN, TO A STANDSTILL TO HEAR YOUR
[1:05:40] HUMBLE CRY. BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM
[1:05:44] GOD. DON'T YOU LISTEN TO THE RUMBLING
[1:05:46] BUBBLE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND THESE
[1:05:49] THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU STAND STILL AND
[1:05:52] KNOW THAT I AM GOD. COME ON. I THINK
[1:05:55] IT'S TIME WE QUIT LETTING THE DEVIL RUN
[1:05:56] US AROUND. AMEN. With every LITTLE WIND
[1:05:59] OF DOCTRINE AND EVERY LITTLE IDEA THAT
[1:06:01] RAISES ITS HEAD, I THINK IT'S TIME WE
[1:06:03] COME TO A PLACE where we can stand still
[1:06:06] and know THAT HE IS GOD AND KNOW THAT HE
[1:06:08] IS HIS WORD. AMEN. When you when you
[1:06:11] begin to look at this in the Old
[1:06:12] Testament, YOU ALL KNOW, AMEN, THERE WAS
[1:06:14] AN OUTER COURT. There was an inner
[1:06:16] court. AMEN. THERE WAS A HOLIEST of
[1:06:18] holies. BROTHER SAID, "NO MATTER." AMEN.
[1:06:20] HOW BIG OF A HOUSE YOU HAVE. He said,
[1:06:22] "Listen, you really only live in three
[1:06:24] rooms." He said, "Every Christian lives
[1:06:26] in a three- room house." He said, "Now
[1:06:28] listen, IT'S IN THAT THIRD ROOM." AMEN.
[1:06:30] IT'S IN THAT THIRD POOL. AMEN. IT'S IN
[1:06:32] THAT THIRD ROOM. AMEN. WHERE A HIDDEN
[1:06:35] LIFE IS TRANSFORMED OR COMES TO LIGHT.
[1:06:38] HE SAID, "NOW LISTEN, THE KITCHEN'S
[1:06:40] WHERE you eat and the living room is
[1:06:42] where you commune." HE SAID, "BUT IT'S
[1:06:43] THAT BEDROOM is where you rest." HE
[1:06:46] SAID, "OH, HE MOVES ON INTO THE BEDROOM.
[1:06:48] THE STILL QUIETNESS WITH GOD WHERE ALL
[1:06:50] THE THINGS of the world is shut out. AND
[1:06:52] HE IS ALONE IN THE STILLNESS WITH GOD."
[1:06:56] BROTHER, SISTER, THAT'S THE PLACE THIS
[1:06:58] PENTECOSTAL MOVE OUGHT TO BE TODAY. NOT
[1:07:00] AS SO MUCH BABBLING. WE'RE TRINITY.
[1:07:02] We're Methodist. We're assembly. WE'RE
[1:07:04] CHURCH OF GOD. WE OUGHT TO BE ALONE IN
[1:07:07] THAT QUIET STILLNESS WITH GOD. AMEN. YOU
[1:07:09] SAY, "WHY DO WE NEED TO BE THERE?" AMEN.
[1:07:11] BECAUSE THERE'S A PROPHECY IN THE BOOK
[1:07:13] OF ACTS. AMEN. LISTEN. Repent ye
[1:07:16] therefore and be converted that YOUR
[1:07:18] SINS MAY BE BLOTTED OUT. WHEN WHEN THE
[1:07:21] TIMES OF REFRESHING, AMEN, SHALL COME
[1:07:25] FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD. YOU KNOW
[1:07:27] WHAT A REFRESHING IS? AMEN. A REFRESHING
[1:07:29] IS WHEN GOD, AMEN, fulfills his word.
[1:07:32] Brother said the first THING WAS A
[1:07:34] REFRESHMENT. HE SAID THE DEW DON'T FALL
[1:07:37] IN DAYTIME. The dew FALLS IN THE
[1:07:39] NIGHTTIME WHEN EVERYTHING IS AT PEACE.
[1:07:42] AMEN. The de can never fall on you, my
[1:07:44] brother, as long as you're FUSSING AND
[1:07:46] ARGUING AND STEWING ABOUT THE THINGS
[1:07:49] here on this earth. He said, "BUT GET
[1:07:51] ALONG WITH GOD AND LET THE DEW DROPS OF
[1:07:54] MERCY, AMEN, FALL UPON YOU IN THE
[1:07:56] STILLNESS, OH PRECIOUS MEMORIES, HOW
[1:07:59] THEY LINGER, HOW THEY EVER FILL MY
[1:08:01] SOUL." NOW LISTEN WHAT HE SAYS HAPPENS
[1:08:03] IN THE STILLNESS. HE SAYS IN THE
[1:08:05] STILLNESS OF THE MIDNIGHT. AMEN. SECRETS
[1:08:08] UNFOLD. AMEN. IN THE STILLNESS OF THE
[1:08:11] MIDNIGHT IS WHEN SECRETS UNFOLD. HOW F
[1:08:14] HOW WE THANK GOD. AMEN. THAT HE HAS COME
[1:08:17] IN THIS HOUR. HE SAYS TO BRING a real
[1:08:19] reality. NOW, AMEN. I DON'T THINK
[1:08:21] CHRISTIANITY ought to be A PUT ON. AMEN.
[1:08:23] I DON'T THINK IT OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING
[1:08:24] THAT THAT we put on when we're just
[1:08:26] around certain people. Re said no. HE
[1:08:29] SAID, "CHRISTIANITY IS NOT NOTHING YOU
[1:08:31] PRETEND. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE IT." AMEN.
[1:08:34] YOU GOT TO HAVE IT BECAUSE THE DEVIL
[1:08:36] KNOWS WHETHER YOU HAVE IT OR NOT. He
[1:08:38] said, "Oh, but when God in the stillness
[1:08:40] of his spirit has placed IT IN YOU, THEN
[1:08:43] THE DEVIL CAN'T STAND ON THAT GROUND. HE
[1:08:46] CANNOT GOW THAT SAND WITH HIS DIRTY
[1:08:48] HOOFS. HE CANNOT COME TO THAT PLACE
[1:08:51] BECAUSE IT'S A PLACE WHERE GOD AND MAN
[1:08:54] MEETS ALONE. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING
[1:08:56] GOD. DON'T YOU SEE WHAT THAT THIRD POOL
[1:08:58] WAS? AMEN. THE PUBLIC COULD KNOW IT
[1:09:01] BECAUSE IT WAS NOT A PUBLIC SHOW BUT IT
[1:09:04] WAS A PREPARED PLACE. AMEN. WHERE CHRIST
[1:09:06] WOULD MEET WITH HIS BRIDE AND THERE
[1:09:08] WOULD BE A RELATIONSHIP TAKE PLACE. OH
[1:09:11] MY. SPIRITUAL CONCENTRATION, AMEN, IS
[1:09:14] WHEN THE INSIDE, AMEN, focuses and it
[1:09:17] removes all the distractions. Amen. I
[1:09:20] love what JESUS SAID IN MATTHEW chapter
[1:09:22] 6 and verse 5. He said, 'WH THOU
[1:09:24] PRAYEST, THOU SHALT not be as the
[1:09:26] hypocrites ARE, FOR THEY HAVE TO PRAY
[1:09:28] STANDING IN THE SYNAGOGUES and in the
[1:09:30] corners of the streets, and that they
[1:09:32] may be seen of men. HE SAID, BUT VERILY
[1:09:34] I SAY UNTO YOU, THEY SHALL HAVE their
[1:09:37] reward. HE SAID, BUT THOU, AMEN, I PUT
[1:09:40] MY NAME THERE. WHEN THOU PRESS, ENTER
[1:09:43] INTO THY CLOSET, AND WHEN THOU HAS SHUT
[1:09:46] THE DOOR, AMEN. IT SOUNDS LIKE A
[1:09:47] CONCENTRATION'S HAPPENING, DON'T IT?
[1:09:49] AMEN. HAS SHUT THE DOOR, then pray TO
[1:09:52] THY FATHER WHICH IS IN SECRET, AND THY
[1:09:55] FATHER WHICH SEETH in secret, AMEN,
[1:09:57] SHALL REWARD THEE OPENLY. OH CHURCH OF
[1:10:00] THE LIVING GOD, AMEN. WILL KNOW WHEN
[1:10:02] YOU'RE PRAYING IN SECRET. AMEN. WILL
[1:10:04] KNOW WHEN THE Y'ALL KNOW WHAT I'M
[1:10:06] TALKING ABOUT, DON'T YOU? AMEN. AMEN. I
[1:10:07] TELL YOU, AMEN. THERE'S A THERE'S A OH,
[1:10:09] I'M GOING GET IN TROUBLE HERE. AMEN.
[1:10:11] THERE'S A WAY TO TELL WHEN A MAN'S
[1:10:12] really concentrated to God or not. Amen.
[1:10:15] You You all have heard HIM GET UP AND
[1:10:16] SAY, "WELL, AMEN. I AIN'T GOT MUCH TO
[1:10:18] SAY TONIGHT, SO I'M JUST GOING TO PREACH
[1:10:19] BY INSPIRATION. And it's really not
[1:10:21] preaching. Amen. It's a beating session.
[1:10:23] And they beat from one end TO THE OTHER
[1:10:25] AND CALL IT INSPIRATION. AMEN. BUT WHEN
[1:10:27] A MAN HAS GOTTEN ALONG WITH GOD
[1:10:30] UNDERNEATH THE AROMA OF THE SEVENTH
[1:10:32] ANGEL'S MESSAGE, HE WILL BEGIN TO reveal
[1:10:35] the secrets of his word. AND WHEN HE
[1:10:37] STEPS BEHIND THAT PULL PIT, IT DON'T
[1:10:39] MATTER IF THEY'RE SHOUTING OR IF THEY'RE
[1:10:40] POUTING. IT DON'T MATTER IF THEY'RE
[1:10:42] RUNNING OR THEY'RE SLEEPING. WHEN A MAN
[1:10:44] HAS MET GOD ON THE SACRED SANDS OF THE
[1:10:47] BACKSIDE OF THE DESERT, HE KNOWS WHAT
[1:10:50] HE'S SAYING. IT'S GOT TO BE SAID. SO
[1:10:52] THERE AIN'T NO DEVIL GOING TO DETER HIM
[1:10:54] WHEN HE'S SAYING IT BECAUSE HE'S FOCUSED
[1:10:57] ON THE POWER OF GOD COMING IN THE CHURCH
[1:10:59] BY THE THIRD PULL MESSAGE OF the hour.
[1:11:03] Oh my. Brother Bam goes in the what is a
[1:11:05] VISION AND I FOUND IT AMAZING BROTHER.
[1:11:07] HE DIRECTLY connects Matthew 6. Amen. To
[1:11:10] that third pull. He said now watch here.
[1:11:12] He come to me that day and spoke and
[1:11:14] said, "I'LL MEET YOU IN THERE." AMEN.
[1:11:17] This is the third pull,
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; BUT NOBODY WILL KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. I
[1:11:22] SAID, "WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IN
[1:11:24] THERE. Why there?" He said, "IT WILL NOT
[1:11:27] BE A public show this time." I SAID, "I
[1:11:31] DON'T UNDERSTAND GOING INTO THAT CLOSET
[1:11:33] LIKE THAT." HE SAID, "IS IT NOT WRITTEN
[1:11:35] BY OUR LORD THAT WHEN THOU PRAYEST, BE
[1:11:38] NOT LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, WHO LIKE TO BE
[1:11:40] HEARD BEFORE MEN, BUT ENTER INTO THAT
[1:11:43] SECRET PLACE, that secret closet, and
[1:11:46] pray to the Father
[1:11:48] who seeth in secret, and he who SEETH IN
[1:11:51] SECRET SHALL REWARD THEE OPENLY." HE
[1:11:54] SAID, "SEE, IT'S PERFECTLY to the
[1:11:56] scripture EVERY TIME IT IS." AND I SAID,
[1:11:59] "I UNDERSTAND." AMEN. AND THEN he took
[1:12:02] ME TO THIS PLACE AND HE SAT ME DOWN IN
[1:12:04] THIS ROOM WHERE I WAS AT. AND THEN HE
[1:12:06] TOLD ME WHAT TO DO FOR THE THIRD TIME.
[1:12:08] NOW CHRISTIAN FRIEND, WHEN I LEAVE THE
[1:12:11] WORLD, THAT'LL STILL BE IN MY BOSOM. BUT
[1:12:14] YOU MARK MY WORDS. What's going to take
[1:12:16] place? Oh, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD.
[1:12:19] AMEN. WE CAN MARK HIS WORDS TONIGHT,
[1:12:21] BROTHER DAVID. AMEN. YOU KNOW WHAT HE
[1:12:23] SAID? HE SAID THAT SEVENTH SEAL, I'LL
[1:12:25] TAKE IT WITH ME TO MY GRAVE. BUT AFTER
[1:12:27] HE DIED, JEFFERSONVILLE, THANK GOD.
[1:12:29] AMEN. RELEASE THE ORIGINAL RECORDING OF
[1:12:32] THE SEVENTH SEAL. AND TONIGHT, WE'RE NOT
[1:12:34] A BUNCH OF IGNORANT PEOPLE that's got to
[1:12:37] believe THIS ABOUT THE RAPTURE AND
[1:12:38] BELIEVE THIS MAN'S IDEA ABOUT THE
[1:12:40] SEVENTH SEAL AND FOLLOW THIS MAN'S IDEA
[1:12:42] ABOUT THE THIRD PULL. BUT WE HAVE GOTTEN
[1:12:44] ALONG WITH GOD IN A PLACE OF
[1:12:47] CONCENTRATION. AND THE HOLY GHOST HAS
[1:12:49] BEGUN TO REVEAL TO US THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:12:52] HOUR IS THE THIRD POOL. IT'S THE CHANGE
[1:12:54] OF OUR BODIES. AMEN. AMEN. YOU ALL KNOW
[1:12:56] THAT THIRD POOL, WHAT IT DONE, IT
[1:12:58] SCATTERED THE LITTLE FISH. AMEN. LITTLE
[1:13:01] FISH GATHERED UNDER THE FIRST POOL. THEY
[1:13:03] GATHERED UNDER THE SECOND POOL. AMEN.
[1:13:05] BUT THAT THIRD PULL, AMEN. IT SCATTERED
[1:13:08] THE LITTLE FISH, BUT IT ATTRACTED THOSE
[1:13:11] RAINBOW TROUT. IT ATTRACTED THAT BRIDE,
[1:13:14] THAT LITTLE FLOCK. AMEN. I THINK OF HOW
[1:13:16] THERE IN MATTHEW 21 WHEN JESUS, AMEN,
[1:13:19] COME RIDING INTO TOWN. AMEN. THE PROPHET
[1:13:21] OF GOD SAID HE MADE UP THIS LITTLE GROUP
[1:13:23] OUT OF A BUNCH OF POOR PEOPLE. HEY.
[1:13:25] AMEN. A BUNCH OF FISHERMEN AND A BUNCH
[1:13:27] OF TAX GATHERS AND A BUNCH OF
[1:13:28] UNEDUCATED. He said, "See, but in the
[1:13:30] midst OF ALL OF IT, THROUGH EVERY AGE
[1:13:33] AND EVERY PROPHET THAT HAD BEEN OR WOULD
[1:13:36] BE, THERE IS GOING TO BE A CERTAIN
[1:13:38] AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT IS PREDESTINATED,
[1:13:41] AMEN, TO HEAR THAT MESSAGE." OH, AND
[1:13:44] THEY'LL FOLLOW IT. LISTEN, THERE IS A
[1:13:47] BRIDE ON THE EARTH TONIGHT WHO IS NOT
[1:13:49] JUST HEARING THIS MESSAGE, AMEN, BUT SHE
[1:13:51] IS FOLLOWING IT. AMEN. SHE IS
[1:13:54] CONCENTRATED ON IT AND IT IS
[1:13:55] TRANSFORMING HER. It is stabilizing HER.
[1:13:59] IT IS EMPOWERING HER. IT IS ANOINTING
[1:14:01] HER. IT IS ENCOURAGING HER. Oh to thank
[1:14:04] tonight THE THOSE IGNORE CROWDS. AMEN.
[1:14:07] AMEN. THOSE THOSE PREDESTINATED ONES,
[1:14:10] BROTHER DAVID PAUL, THEY IGNORE THE
[1:14:11] CROWDS. AMEN. THEY IGNORE THE CRITICISM.
[1:14:14] AMEN. THEY HAVE NO ARGUMENTS. AMEN.
[1:14:16] THERE'S ONE THING THEY DO AND THAT'S
[1:14:18] BELIEVE. AMEN. TO GET EVERY BIT OF IT
[1:14:21] THEY CAN. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
[1:14:22] BROTHER TIM. AMEN. BUT I WANT TO SOAK IT
[1:14:25] IN. AMEN. I WANT TO BE LIKE MARY. I I
[1:14:27] WANT TO SIT AT THE FEET OF JESUS. I
[1:14:29] DON'T JUST WANT THIS TO BE A SUNDAY
[1:14:31] MORNING AFFAIR. I DON'T JUST WANT THIS
[1:14:33] TO BE A WEDNESDAY NIGHT AFFAIR. AMEN.
[1:14:35] BUT I WANT THIS TO BE AN EVERY HOUR OF
[1:14:36] MY LIFE. AMEN. SOAKING IN, AMEN. THE
[1:14:40] REVELATIONS. AMEN. SOAKING IN THE GRACE
[1:14:42] OF GOD. COME ON, GRACE TABERNACLE. IT'S
[1:14:44] TIME TO SHAKE YOURSELF AND SAY, "THIS IS
[1:14:47] THE HOUR." AMEN. WE'VE HEARD THESE
[1:14:49] THINGS. WE'VE PREACHED THESE THINGS.
[1:14:51] WE'VE SUNG ABOUT THESE THINGS. WE'VE
[1:14:53] SHOUTED ABOUT THESE THINGS. BUT NOW IT'S
[1:14:55] TIME TO SO HONE IN AND BEGIN TO
[1:14:57] CONCENTRATE ON THESE THINGS UNTIL THE
[1:14:59] VERY CHARACTER OF JESUS CHRIST IS
[1:15:02] DEVELOPED IN EVERY INDIVIDUAL. AMEN. IF
[1:15:05] IF THERE'S A DESIRE IN YOUR HEART TO
[1:15:07] HAVE IT, THERE'S A GOD IN HEAVEN TO
[1:15:08] PERFECT IT.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AMEN. I'LL SAY THIS. THE
[1:15:11] OPPOSITE OF AN ATTRACTION IS a
[1:15:13] distraction.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; And you all know in LUKEAP 10:38, IT
[1:15:18] SAYS, "NOW IT CAME TO PASS AS THEY
[1:15:19] WENT." AMEN. AND HE ENTERED INTO A
[1:15:21] CERTAIN VILLAGE AND A CERTAIN WOMAN. I
[1:15:22] like that certain certain amount of
[1:15:24] people. A CERTAIN WOMAN NAMED MARTHA
[1:15:27] RECEIVED HIM INTO HER HOUSE AND SHE HAD
[1:15:30] A SISTER CALLED MARY WHICH ALSO SAT AT
[1:15:33] JESUS' FEET AND HEARD HIS WORD. BUT
[1:15:36] MARTHA, AMEN, WAS CUMBERED ABOUT MUCH
[1:15:39] SERVING AND CAME TO HIM AND SAID, "LORD,
[1:15:41] DOST THOU NOT CARE THAT MY SISTER HATH
[1:15:44] LEFT ME TO SERVE ALONE?" AMEN. BID her
[1:15:47] therefore that she help me. NOW LOOK AT
[1:15:49] THIS WORD CUMBERED. IT MEANS TO DRAW
[1:15:51] AWAY. IT MEANS TO BE DRIVEN ABOUT
[1:15:54] MENTALLY. IT MEANS to be overoccupied.
[1:15:57] NOW COME ON. I'M PREACHING TO YOU. AMEN.
[1:15:59] She was cumbered. AMEN. AMEN. SHE WAS
[1:16:01] DRIVEN ABOUT MENTALLY. SHE SHE WAS BEING
[1:16:04] DRAWN AWAY. AMEN. SHE WAS OVEROCCUPIED.
[1:16:07] AMEN. I MIGHT AS WELL READ THE REST OF
[1:16:09] IT. SHE WAS TOO BUSY. AMEN. NOW LOOK
[1:16:11] WHAT JESUS ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO HER.
[1:16:13] HE SAID, "MARTHA, MARTHA, THOU ART
[1:16:15] CAREFUL AND TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS."
[1:16:18] HOW MANY'S EVER BEEN THERE? AMEN. HOW
[1:16:20] MANY'S EVER COME TO CHURCH? AND MAYBE
[1:16:21] SOME OF Y'ALL ARE SITTING HERE TONIGHT
[1:16:23] JUST LIKE MARTHA WAS. AMEN. YOU'RE
[1:16:25] CUMBERED. AMEN. YOU'RE TROUBLED ABOUT
[1:16:27] MANY THINGS. AMEN. BUT CAN YOU HEAR the
[1:16:29] voice of the word? YOU KNOW WHAT HE
[1:16:31] SAID? HE SAID, "LISTEN, BUT ONE THING IS
[1:16:33] NEEDFUL." AMEN. NOT MANY THINGS. AMEN.
[1:16:36] BUT ONE THING IS NEEDFUL. AND MARY HAD
[1:16:39] CHOSEN THAT GOOD PART WHICH SHALL NOT BE
[1:16:42] TAKEN AWAY FROM HER. HAVE YOU EVER
[1:16:44] FOCUSED ON SOMETHING, FOLKS, AND THEN
[1:16:46] IT'S JUST TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU? HAVE YOU
[1:16:48] EVER GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU GOT TO A
[1:16:50] SITUATION AND THEN IT'S JUST TAKEN AWAY?
[1:16:52] I'M PREACHING TO YOU TONIGHT. AMEN.
[1:16:54] THAT'S WHY I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET BACK
[1:16:55] TO PREACHING THE MESSAGE AND QUIT TRYING
[1:16:57] TO BUILD MINISTRIES AND BUILD
[1:16:59] PERSONALITIES. I I LET ME LET ME
[1:17:01] REPHRASE THAT. I BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO
[1:17:02] BUILD MINISTRIES, AMEN, under the power
[1:17:04] of GOD THAT'LL BE MINISTRIES OF THIS
[1:17:06] MESSAGE. BUT BUILDING UP MEN AND THIS
[1:17:08] GUY DONE THIS AND THIS GUY DONE THAT AND
[1:17:10] THIS CHURCH. AMEN. FORGET IT ALL. AMEN.
[1:17:13] AMEN. CUZ ONE DAY, OH GOD, Y'ALL KNOW
[1:17:15] WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AMEN. Y'ALL
[1:17:16] REMEMBER IN SCHOOL WHEN YOU GOT A
[1:17:18] FRIEND, YOU RAN AROUND CALLING EVERYBODY
[1:17:19] THEIR BEST FRIEND AND WHILE YOU WERE
[1:17:21] TELLING SOMEBODY THEY WERE YOUR BEST
[1:17:22] FRIEND, THEY WERE TURNING ON YOU. AMEN.
[1:17:24] AND THEY WERE BECOMING YOUR ENEMY. WHAT
[1:17:26] ARE YOU SAYING, PREACHER? I'M SAYING
[1:17:28] QUIT GIVING YOURSELF, AMEN, TO LITTLE
[1:17:30] DISSENSIONS AND TO LITTLE POLITICS AND
[1:17:33] TO LITTLE ILL FEELINGS, AMEN, BECAUSE IN
[1:17:35] THE MOMENT, IN THE TWINK OF AN EYE,
[1:17:37] IT'LL ALL BE GONE. BUT THERE IS ONE
[1:17:39] THING THAT SHALL NEVER PASS AWAY. IT'S
[1:17:42] THE WORD OF GOD. AND IF A MAN, WOMAN,
[1:17:44] BOY, OR CHILD WILL EVER GIVE THEMSELVES
[1:17:46] UNTO THE THINGS OF GOD. AMEN. THERE WILL
[1:17:49] BE AN ETERNAL REWARD THAT NO MAN can
[1:17:51] take away from you. YES, SIR. AMEN.
[1:17:54] DON'T FOCUS ON THESE MANY THINGS. FOCUS
[1:17:56] ON THAT ONE THING. WATCH HOW JESUS
[1:17:58] CONTRASTED. HE CONTRASTED MANY THINGS
[1:18:01] WITH ONE THING. YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID?
[1:18:03] HE SAID, "LOOK HERE. YOUR PRACTICAL
[1:18:05] NEEDS ARE IMPORTANT." AMEN. But
[1:18:07] listening to Jesus should be the
[1:18:10] priority. I LOVE WHAT BROTHER MATT SAID
[1:18:12] THERE ON SUNDAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF
[1:18:13] THE HOUSE OF GOD. AMEN. I KNOW I I'M I'M
[1:18:16] LAUGHED AT AND MADE FUN OF AND OLD
[1:18:17] SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AMEN. BUT
[1:18:19] THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT ME THAT JUST
[1:18:21] GETS PHYSICALLY SICK WHEN I CAN'T BE IN
[1:18:23] THE HOUSE OF GOD. AMEN. I MAY BE
[1:18:25] PHYSICALLY SICK. AMEN. BUT I'LL GET EVEN
[1:18:27] SICKER, BEN. AMEN. BECAUSE THERE'S
[1:18:29] SOMETHING IN ME THAT DESIRES TO BE
[1:18:33] WHERE THE CARCASS IS. SOMEBODY SAY,
[1:18:35] "WELL, AMEN. I DON'T THINK CHURCH IS
[1:18:37] IMPORTANT." WELL, MAYBE NOT TO YOU.
[1:18:38] AMEN. BUT JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT
[1:18:40] IMPORTANT TO YOU, DON'T MEAN YOU HAVE
[1:18:42] THE RIGHT TO SET THE STANDARD OF HOW
[1:18:44] EVERYBODY ELSE SHOULD CONDUCT THEIR
[1:18:46] CHURCH ATTENDANCE. I THINK IF THERE'S A
[1:18:48] CHURCH CLOSE BY, YOU OUGHT TO DARKEN THE
[1:18:50] DOOR OF IT. AMEN. YOU OUGHT TO SAY,
[1:18:51] "LORD, I'M HERE TO WORSHIP YOU.
[1:18:55] AMEN. I know YOU'RE THINKING I'M TOO FAR
[1:18:56] ON THAT. BUT I'M REALLY NOT BECAUSE THAT
[1:18:58] M BECAUSE WHAT JESUS SAID THERE IN LUKE,
[1:19:01] IT TIES ALL THE WAY BACK TO PSALMS 27
[1:19:04] AND VERSE FOUR WHEN DAVID SAID, "ONE
[1:19:06] THING HAVE I DESIRED OF THE LORD, AND
[1:19:08] THAT WILL I SEEK AFTER THAT I MAY DWELL
[1:19:11] IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF
[1:19:15] MY LIFE, THAT I WILL BEHOLD, AMEN, THE
[1:19:18] BEAUTY OF THE LORD, AND TO INQUIRE IN
[1:19:21] HIS TEMPLE." OH, GRACE TABERNACLE. HOW
[1:19:24] MANY CAN SAY, "LORD, LET IT BE." THERE'S
[1:19:26] ONE THING I DESIRE THAT I MAY DWELL IN
[1:19:30] THE PRESENCE OF JESUS CHRIST THAT I MAY
[1:19:33] BE THERE. THAT I MAY BEHOLD HIS BEAUTY.
[1:19:36] THAT I MAY INQUIRE IN HIS TEMPLE.
[1:19:38] REVEREND SAID, "IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL." He
[1:19:40] said, "There's so many emotions and SO
[1:19:42] MANY THINGS TO DISTRACT US FROM THE
[1:19:45] SPIRIT TODAY." NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT PAUL
[1:19:48] SAID IN 1 Corinthians 7:35? He said,
[1:19:50] "The thing I SPEAK FOR YOUR OWN PROFIT,
[1:19:53] NOT THAT I MAY CAST A SNARE UPON YOU."
[1:19:56] AMEN. SO I WAS NOT SAYING THOSE THINGS.
[1:19:58] BROTHER MATT IS NOT SAYING THOSE THINGS.
[1:20:00] AMEN. TO CAST A SNARE UPON YOU. AMEN.
[1:20:03] BUT THAT WHICH IS COMELY. NOW LOOK HERE.
[1:20:06] AND THAT YOU MAY ATTEND UPON THE LORD
[1:20:09] WITHOUT DISTRACTION.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU MAY ATTEND UPON THE LORD
[1:20:15] WITHOUT DISTRACTION. LOOK AT THIS WORD
[1:20:17] ATTEND. IT MEANS TO SIT CONSTANTLY. IT
[1:20:20] MEANS TO BE DEVOTED TO. NOW, BROTHER
[1:20:22] ANDREW, ARE YOU SAYING, "AMEN, THAT I'VE
[1:20:24] GOT TO I'VE GOT TO LIVE IN A ROOM WITH
[1:20:26] the door shut, the shades pulled down,
[1:20:28] with my ear TO A TAPE PLAYER ALL THE
[1:20:30] TIME?" NO, FOLKS. I'M TALKING ABOUT
[1:20:32] SOMEBODY WHO MOVES INTO AN EXPERIENCE.
[1:20:35] THEY MOVE INTO A HIDDEN LIFE. AND WHEN
[1:20:38] THEY'RE ON THE JOB, THEY'RE DESIRING THE
[1:20:40] LORD. WHEN THEY'RE AT SCHOOL, they're
[1:20:42] fellowshipping with the Lord. WHEN
[1:20:44] THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY TO WORK. AMEN.
[1:20:45] THEY'RE FELLOWSHIPPING with them. I'VE
[1:20:47] HEARD SOME OF YOU BROTHERS TELL ME ABOUT
[1:20:49] THOSE MORNING DRIVES TO WORK and you
[1:20:51] just turn ON A TAPE AND THE POWER OF
[1:20:53] GOD. I GET A WITNESS HERE TONIGHT. AMEN.
[1:20:55] THE POWER OF GOD DROPS IN YOUR TRUCK.
[1:20:57] AMEN. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? THAT'S ONE
[1:21:00] THING I HAVE DESIRED THAT I WOULD
[1:21:02] CONCENTRATE UPON THE THINGS THAT GOD HAS
[1:21:05] DONE IN MY GENERATION. OH, THAT WORD
[1:21:08] DISTRACTION. IT MEANS WITHOUT IT MEANS
[1:21:10] WITHOUT ANXIETY. IT MEANS WITHOUT CARE.
[1:21:13] REB SAID, "OH, HE IS THE CENTER of our
[1:21:15] worship. He is the center of our
[1:21:17] attraction. HE IS THE CENTER OF OUR
[1:21:20] LIFE. ALL THAT WE HAVE AND WANT ARE AND
[1:21:23] WILL BE IS BASED UPON HIM. HE IS THE ONE
[1:21:28] WHO CAME AND GAVE HIS LIFE FOR US. HE
[1:21:31] COME DOWN FROM GOD OUT OF GLORY AND WAS
[1:21:34] MADE FLESH AND DWELT AMONG US AND TAKEN
[1:21:37] UPON HIM THE SIN OF US ALL AND THE
[1:21:39] SICKNESS OF US ALL AND BORED AWAY TO
[1:21:42] CALVARY AND THERE PAID THE PRICE.
[1:21:44] LISTEN, NOT MANY, NOT US. AMEN. NOT ALL
[1:21:47] OF US, BUT HE IS WORTHY OF ALL THE
[1:21:51] PRAISE THAT WE CAN GIVE TO HIM. LISTEN,
[1:21:54] I TELL YOU WHAT I PRAY I PRAY THIS
[1:21:56] CHURCH IS KNOWN FOR. I PRAY WE'RE KNOWN
[1:21:58] FOR A BUNCH OF SHOUTING, HOLY GHOST
[1:22:00] FILLED. AMEN. FIREBAPTIZED PEOPLE THAT
[1:22:03] KNOWS WHO SAVED US. WE KNOW WHO HEALED
[1:22:06] US. WE KNOW WHO DELIVERED US. WE KNOW
[1:22:08] WHO REDEEMED US. WE KNOW WHO GAVE US THE
[1:22:10] HOLY GHOST. AND HIS NAME IS JESUS
[1:22:13] CHRIST. AND IF WE CAN DO ANYTHING, WE
[1:22:15] WANT TO DO IT UNTO HIM BECAUSE HE IS
[1:22:18] WORTHY OF IT ALL THAT WE COULD EVER GIVE
[1:22:22] UNTO HIM. IF I BE LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW
[1:22:26] ALL MEN UNTO MYSELF. I LOVE WHAT he
[1:22:29] says. He says, "The greatest attraction
[1:22:31] THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER HAD IS WHEN
[1:22:33] CHRIST be lifted up to A FALLEN WORLD."
[1:22:37] TO MY OPINION, THE GOSPEL NEVER LOSES
[1:22:40] ATTRACTION. AMEN. TO A BELIEVER, IT'S
[1:22:42] ALWAYS THE SAME GOSPEL. NOW, FOLKS, I'M
[1:22:45] TALKING ABOUT A HIDDEN LIFE. I'M TALKING
[1:22:47] ABOUT A CONCENTRATED LIFE. I'M TALKING
[1:22:50] ABOUT I'M TALKING ABOUT FOCUSING ON
[1:22:52] SOMETHING THAT WILL STABILIZE YOU. AMEN.
[1:22:55] SOMETHING THAT WILL TRANSFORM YOU,
[1:22:57] SOMETHING THAT WILL GIVE YOU A CHARACTER
[1:23:00] ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR HEART. REMEMBER
[1:23:02] SAID THE GOSPEL AND YET IN ITS
[1:23:04] SIMPLICITY IS THE GREATEST DRAWING CARD
[1:23:07] THE WORLD has ever known. Jesus said
[1:23:10] WHEN HE WAS HERE ON EARTH, "IF I BE
[1:23:13] LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO ME."
[1:23:16] I LOVE THIS. BLACK, WHITE, YELLOW,
[1:23:18] BROWN, whatever their color or race is,
[1:23:21] the gospel still holds the center OF
[1:23:24] ATTRACTION TO EVERY MAN. HE SAID CHRIST
[1:23:28] IS OUR LEADER. HOW MANY AGREES THE
[1:23:31] MESSAGE IS CHRIST AND CHRIST IS OUR
[1:23:34] LEADER? THEN WHEN WE ALLOW OUR FOCUS,
[1:23:37] AMEN, to drift from the attraction, we
[1:23:40] begin to focus ON DISTRACTIONS. YOU ALL
[1:23:42] KNOW WHAT HAPPENS? REVIVAL FIRES BEGIN
[1:23:45] TO DIM DOWN. NOW, NOW, NOW, LET ME
[1:23:47] PREACH A MINUTE HERE BECAUSE PAUL TOLD
[1:23:49] TIMOTHY, IN THE LAST DAYS, PERILOUS
[1:23:51] times shall come. And down IN VERSE
[1:23:53] FOUR, HE SAID, "THERE'LL BE TRAITORS.
[1:23:56] THEY'LL BE HEADY. THEY'LL BE
[1:23:57] HIGHMINDED." AMEN. THEY'LL BE LOVERS OF
[1:24:00] PLEASURE MORE THAN LOVERS OF GOD.
[1:24:03] BROTHER RAM'S REFERRING TO SECOND
[1:24:04] Timothy 3 AND HE SAID, "THE TELEVISION
[1:24:06] has come into the home and holds the
[1:24:08] people away FROM THE PRAYER MEETINGS.
[1:24:10] IT'S GOT AN ATTRACTION TO it
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; that's attractive AND BEAUTIFUL. AND I
[1:24:15] DON'T NOW NOW I THANK GOD FOR for a
[1:24:18] prophet. David, he wasn't a legalist. He
[1:24:20] was a he was a prophet. HE SAID, "NOW I
[1:24:22] DON'T SAY THAT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS
[1:24:24] ISN'T ALL RIGHT. THERE'S A LOT OF it
[1:24:26] there's a lot of IT THAT ISN'T. WE KNOW
[1:24:28] THAT." HE SAID, "YES, 99% OF IT ISN'T
[1:24:33] ALL RIGHT. BUT SAY THERE WOULD BE 1% of
[1:24:35] it." WELL, WHAT YOU GET IN THAT 1%,
[1:24:39] would you mean to give up that 1% for
[1:24:42] the church of the living God?
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. That's the time to
[1:24:48] say amen. AMEN. WILL YOU GIVE UP THAT 1%
[1:24:52] FOR THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD WHERE
[1:24:54] IT'S 100% RIGHT? AMEN. YOU'LL STAY AWAY
[1:24:57] ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT FROM PRAYER MEETINGS.
[1:25:00] NOW, COME ON, FOLKS. I'M NOT I'M NOT
[1:25:02] TRYING TO BE A TRYING TO BE A LEGALIST.
[1:25:03] I'M TRYING TO BE A GOSPEL PREACHER.
[1:25:05] AMEN. WELL, THERE MAY BE ONE LITTLE
[1:25:07] PERCENT, RIGHT? AMEN. BUT WHAT IS WORTH
[1:25:09] THAT 1% WHEN THE HOUSE OF GOD IS FULL OF
[1:25:13] 100% OF JESUS AND 100% OF HIS WORD AND
[1:25:17] 100% OF HIS POWER? I KNOW PEOPLE, AMEN,
[1:25:19] THEY'LL MISS CHURCH FOR 1%. THEY'LL STAY
[1:25:22] HOME FOR 1%. AMEN. BUT I DON'T KNOW
[1:25:24] ABOUT YOU, I'M NOT A 1% CHRISTIAN. I AM
[1:25:27] A HOLY GHOST FILLED, FIRE BAPTIZED. I'M
[1:25:30] RUNNING FOR JESUS AND I GOT TO MAKE A
[1:25:32] HUNDRED. AMEN. I wish I had MY BUDDY,
[1:25:35] BROTHER FRED MULLEN HERE TONIGHT. HE'D
[1:25:37] SING, "I'M RUNNING FOR JESUS, TRYING TO
[1:25:39] MAKE A 100. 99 AND A HALF JUST WON'T
[1:25:41] DO." AMEN. AMEN. I love Brother Fred. He
[1:25:44] gets to singing that. And Sister Joyce,
[1:25:45] he'll start all the way DOWN THERE AT 85
[1:25:47] AND SAY, "WHAT ABOUT 85? JUST won't do."
[1:25:50] And he'll go all the WAY UP TO 99 JUST
[1:25:52] WON'T DO. AMEN. LISTEN, FOLKS. 99 AND A
[1:25:54] HALF WON'T DO. IT'S GOING TO TAKE A
[1:25:57] 100%. AMEN. To be A BELIEVER IN THIS
[1:26:00] HOUR. SIN IS ATTRACTIVE AND WAY YOU TAKE
[1:26:02] IT. SIN is attracted to the human being.
[1:26:05] LISTEN, BECAUSE HE'S A SUBJECT OF THE
[1:26:07] FALLEN RACE THAT WE ARE, AND IT'S
[1:26:09] ATTRACTIVE. HE SAID, SATAN KNOWS HOW TO
[1:26:13] MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE. HE'S A GENIUS AT HIS
[1:26:15] JOB.
[1:26:17] OH MY. AMEN. IF HE CAN'T GET IT OUT
[1:26:19] THERE IN THE WORLD FAIR, he brings it
[1:26:22] right INTO THE CHURCH. HE COMES RIGHT
[1:26:24] OVER on our ground. That's the reason,
[1:26:27] brethren and sisters, WE SHOULD
[1:26:28] RECOGNIZE HIM. IF I BE LIFTED UP, IT'S
[1:26:32] TIME THAT THE CHURCH WAS SPIRITUAL TO
[1:26:36] RECOGNIZE TO KNOW GOD. NOT BY CREED, NOT
[1:26:39] BY DENOMINATION, BUT BY EXPERIENCE of
[1:26:43] being FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. WHOLE
[1:26:45] CHURCH. THAT'S MY DESIRE IS THAT EVERY
[1:26:48] MEMBER OF THIS ASSEMBLY WOULD BE SO FULL
[1:26:51] OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT WHEN THE DEVIL
[1:26:53] TRIES TO BRING SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE,
[1:26:55] THERE IS SOMETHING RAISES UP ON THE
[1:26:57] INSIDE OF YOU AND SAYS THAT'S A
[1:26:59] DISTRACTION THAT'S TRYING TO TAKE MY
[1:27:01] FOCUS AND MY ATTENTION AWAY FROM THAT
[1:27:04] THIRD PULL.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; He said it used to be the old
[1:27:08] Pentecostals wouldn't let their children
[1:27:09] ever go to picture shows.
[1:27:12] Well, the devil pulled one over on their
[1:27:14] eyes AND HE BROUGHT THE PICTURE SO RIGHT
[1:27:16] IN THE HOUSE. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU SEE HOW
[1:27:18] HE GOT IT SLICK, WHY SLIMY AS HE CAN BE.
[1:27:21] Don't you never underestimate him. You
[1:27:24] stay UNDER THE CROSS. IT'S THE ONLY
[1:27:27] PLACE TO STAY FOR SAFETY. NOW, NOW THIS
[1:27:30] BROTHER, HE SAID, "SO THE OLD-TIMERS,
[1:27:32] YOU SEE, AMEN. THEY STAY WITH GOD."
[1:27:34] WELL, I SAY, "GOD, GIVE US SOME ELDERS."
[1:27:38] COME ON, FOLKS. AND I SAY, "GOD, GIVE US
[1:27:39] SOME ELDERS THAT'LL STAY WITH GOD THAT
[1:27:42] WILL NOT LEAVE THEIR FIRST LOVE."
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "PREACHER, WHY ARE YOU SAYING
[1:27:46] THIS?" BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID,
[1:27:47] "NEVERTHELESS, I HAVE SOMEWHAT AGAINST
[1:27:49] THEE BECAUSE THOU HAS LEFT THY FIRST
[1:27:52] LOVE." NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT A PROPHET
[1:27:53] PICKS that up and says? HE SAYS, "IN THE
[1:27:55] GENERATIONS OF ISRAEL, WE SEE REVIVAL IN
[1:27:59] ONE GENERATION only to SEE THE FIRES
[1:28:02] FADING IN THE NEXT. AND IN THE THIRD
[1:28:04] GENERATION, EMBERS THAT MAY BE GLOWING
[1:28:07] SLIGHTLY, BUT IN THE FOURTH, THERE MAY
[1:28:10] BE NO VESTAGE WHATSOEVER OF THAT
[1:28:13] ORIGINAL FLAME. I SAY, GOD, DON'T LET
[1:28:15] THAT BE SAID ABOUT US. I SAY, GOD, GIVE
[1:28:17] US SOME ELDERS THAT WILL NOT WEAKEN AND
[1:28:20] WILL NOT DILUTE THE STANDARDS OF
[1:28:22] HOLINESS AND PURITY. LISTEN, OUR YOUNG
[1:28:25] PEOPLE NEED ELDERS TO LOOK UP TO AND SEE
[1:28:28] THAT SOMEBODY BELIEVES WHAT THE PROPHET
[1:28:30] SAID AND WILL SEPARATE THEMSELVES AND
[1:28:33] WILL CONCENTRATE THEMSELVES ON THE
[1:28:35] THINGS OF GOD.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. He said, "You start out with
[1:28:39] true born again." Now, put your seat
[1:28:41] belts on. I guess it's just going to get
[1:28:42] bumpy for a minute.
[1:28:44] YOU START OUT WITH TRULY BORN AGAIN
[1:28:46] BELIEVERS AND WHEN THAT NEXT GENERATION
[1:28:48] COMES ALONG, THEY ARE NO LONGER just
[1:28:51] plain Christians, BUT THEY HAVE TAKEN A
[1:28:53] DENOMINATIONAL NAME AND ARE NOW BAPTIST
[1:28:56] AND METHODIST. HE SAID, "LISTEN, THE
[1:28:58] FERVENT DESIRE TO PLEASE GOD, THE
[1:29:00] PASSION TO KNOW HIS WORD, the cry, OH
[1:29:03] MY, THE CRY FOR REACHING OUT IN THE
[1:29:05] SPIRIT, IT ALL BEGINS TO FADE."
[1:29:10] AND INSTEAD OF THAT CHURCH BEING ON
[1:29:12] FIRE, IS THIS OKAY?
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; WITH THE FIRE OF GOD, IT HAS COOLED off
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; and become a bit formal.
[1:29:22] THAT IS WHAT WAS HAPPENING BACK THERE TO
[1:29:25] THE EPHESIANS. THEY WERE GETTING a bit
[1:29:28] formal. Now, EITHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE
[1:29:30] FIERY OR YOU'RE GOING TO BE FORMAL.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; AND I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DON'T
[1:29:34] WANT NO PART OF FORMALITY. FORMALITY
[1:29:37] ROBS THE POWER OF GOD FROM BLESSING THE
[1:29:39] CHILDREN OF GOD. AMEN. I DON'T WANT NO
[1:29:41] FORMAL CHURCH. I DON'T WANT NO FORMAL
[1:29:44] RELIGION. I WANT SOMETHING THAT'S GOT
[1:29:46] SOME FIRE IN IT THAT WHEN IT BEGINS TO
[1:29:48] MOVE, IT BEGINS TO BURN AWAY EVERYTHING
[1:29:51] THAT'S UNLIKE OUR GOD.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. HE SAID THE ABANDONMENT WAS TO
[1:29:55] GOD WAS DYING OUT. AND THE PEOPLE
[1:29:58] WEREN'T TOO CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT GOD
[1:30:00] THOUGHT ABOUT THEM AS THEY BEGIN TO BE
[1:30:03] CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT THE WORLD THOUGHT
[1:30:05] ABOUT THEM. WELL, I WOULD DO THIS, BUT
[1:30:07] YOU KNOW, MY FRIEND SAYS THIS AND I
[1:30:09] WOULD DO THIS, BUT YOU KNOW THAT ONE
[1:30:11] SAID THIS AND AND YOU KNOW, AMEN. IT'S A
[1:30:13] LITTLE OLDFASHIONED JUST TO HOLD them
[1:30:15] old time standards. William Brandom.
[1:30:17] Amen. So, we're just going to we're
[1:30:18] going TO BELIEVE THEM. NO, WHAT YOU'RE
[1:30:20] GOING TO DO IS LET THE FIRE OF GOD,
[1:30:22] AMEN, GO OUT OF YOUR LIFE AND THEN THE
[1:30:24] SECOND GENERATION WILL BE JUST LIKE
[1:30:26] ISRAEL. THEY WILL DEMAND A KING TO BE
[1:30:29] LIKE OTHER NATIONS. AND WHEN THEY DID
[1:30:31] THAT, THEY REJECTED GOD. BUT THEY DID IT
[1:30:33] ANYWAY. That's the HISTORY OF THE
[1:30:35] CHURCH. NOW LISTEN. He says WHEN IT
[1:30:37] THINKS MORE OF CONFORMING TO THE world
[1:30:40] of the world INSTEAD OF CONFORMING TO
[1:30:42] GOD, IT ISN'T LONG UNTIL YOU SEE THEM
[1:30:46] STOP DOING THINGS they used to do.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Am I reading the message right?
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; AND START DOING THINGS THEY wouldn't do
[1:30:55] initially. They change their manner of
[1:30:58] dress. Now, now watch what happens.
[1:31:01] Their attitudes and their behavior.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Y'all know I'm TELLING THE TRUTH. YOU
[1:31:07] YOU JUST START DRESSING A LITTLE BIT
[1:31:08] like the world and coming to CHURCH AND
[1:31:11] THEN YOUR ATTITUDE changes and it
[1:31:13] changes from preach IT PREACHER TO I
[1:31:15] DARE YOU TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Y'ALL KNOW I'M PREACHING, DON'T YOU?
[1:31:19] AMEN. AND THEN THE BEHAVIOR CHANGES.
[1:31:21] AMEN. BEGIN TO REBEL AGAINST THE WORD.
[1:31:23] LISTEN, I'M RIGHT HERE IN THE MESSAGE.
[1:31:25] IT'S BECAUSE YOU GET LAXED. AND THE PRO
[1:31:27] OF GOD SAID THAT'S WHAT EPHESUS MEANS.
[1:31:30] IT MEANS RELAXED and drifting. WHEN YOU
[1:31:33] GET RELAXED, YOU BEGIN TO DRIFT. HE SAID
[1:31:35] THE CYCLE OF REVIVAL AND DEATH HAS NEVER
[1:31:37] FAILED. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS RECALL.
[1:31:40] AMEN. THE LAST MOVE OF GOD IN THE
[1:31:42] SPIRIT. WHEN MEN AND WOMEN DRESSED LIKE
[1:31:44] CHRISTIANS, THEY WENT TO CHURCH. THEY
[1:31:46] PRAYED ALL NIGHT. THEY TOOK TO STREET
[1:31:48] CORNERS. THEY WEREN'T ASHAMED OF THE
[1:31:51] MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SPIRIT. THEY LEFT
[1:31:53] THEIR OLD DEAD CHURCHES AND THEY
[1:31:55] WORSHIPED IN HOMES OR OLD STORE
[1:31:57] BUILDINGS. THEY HAD REALITY, BUT IT
[1:32:00] WASN'T TOO LONG A TIME UNTIL THEY BEGIN
[1:32:03] TO GET ENOUGH MONEY TO BUILD FINE NEW
[1:32:04] CHURCHES. I'm going to preach. AND THEY
[1:32:06] PUT IN A CHOIR INSTEAD OF SINGING UNTO
[1:32:09] GOD FOR THEMSELVES. AND THEY PUT GOWNS
[1:32:11] ON THE CHOIR. SOMEBODY SAY, "WHY THEY DO
[1:32:13] THAT?" WELL, IF THE DRESSES WERE LONG
[1:32:15] ENOUGH, THEY WOULDN'T HAD TO PUT GOWNS
[1:32:16] ON THEM TO BEGIN WITH.
[1:32:19] COME ON, PREACHER. PREACH, HOLY GHOST.
[1:32:22] AMEN. THEY ORGANIZED A MOVEMENT AND RAN
[1:32:24] IT BY MAN. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS. AND
[1:32:26] THEY SOON BE TO READ BOOKS THAT WERE NOT
[1:32:28] FIT TO READ. NOW, NOW FOLKS, I'M JUST
[1:32:30] GOING TO SAY IT LIKE THE PROPHET SAID.
[1:32:32] THEY LET DOWN THE BARS AND THE GOATS
[1:32:34] CAME IN AND TOOK OVER. I I KNOW PEOPLE
[1:32:36] THAT'S JUST LIKE THIS. THE CRY OF JOY
[1:32:38] WAS GONE. THE FREEDOM OF THE SPIRIT WAS
[1:32:40] GONE. OH, THEY KEPT ON WITH THE THRM.
[1:32:43] AMEN. BUT THE FIRE HAD DIED DOWN. AND
[1:32:45] THE BLACKNESS OF ASHES IS ABOUT ALL THAT
[1:32:48] IS LEFT. FOLKS, YOU KNOW I'M TELLING THE
[1:32:50] TRUTH. WHAT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON IS
[1:32:52] DETERMINE WHAT LEVEL YOU'RE LIVING ON.
[1:32:54] YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T READ OLD DIRTY BOOKS
[1:32:56] ALL THE TIME AND EXPECT THE POWER OF
[1:32:58] GOD, AMEN, TO FILL YOU WITH THE DESIRES
[1:33:01] OF YOUR HEART. COME ON. AMEN. YOU CAN'T
[1:33:03] FEED ON HONKY TONK MUSIC ALL WEEK LONG
[1:33:06] AND THEN EXPECT THE LAND TO BLESS YOU ON
[1:33:08] SUNDAY MORNING. YOU'RE TOO DISTRACTED.
[1:33:10] YOU'RE TOO SCATTERED. BUT GOD SAID, "IF
[1:33:13] I WILL BE LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW ALL MEN
[1:33:17] UNTO MYSELF." COME ON. I THINK IT'S
[1:33:19] TIME.
[1:33:21] I MIGHT AS WELL PREACH. IT'S THE TRUTH.
[1:33:23] I THINK IT'S TIME TO TEAR DOWN EVERY
[1:33:25] IDOL THAT WE HAVE EXALTED IN OUR LIVES
[1:33:27] THAT HAS TAKEN OUR CONCENTRATION OFF OF
[1:33:30] THIS MESSAGE. IT'S TIME TO TEAR IT DOWN
[1:33:32] AND LIFT UP JESUS CHRIST. HE IS YOUR
[1:33:35] FUTURE.
[1:33:37] I'M PREACHING TO YOU. HE IS YOUR FUTURE.
[1:33:40] HE IS YOUR FUTURE. JESUS CHRIST IS YOUR
[1:33:43] FUTURE.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; WELL, I'm nervous. had a had a young man
[1:33:49] tell me one time. He said, "I'm nervous.
[1:33:50] I don't know what's wrong with me." And
[1:33:51] then then a few days later, he's telling
[1:33:53] me about some some some hard rock, punk
[1:33:55] rock, or whatever they call it music
[1:33:57] that I had an old buddy of mine up in
[1:33:58] Hills, West Virginia. Brother Roy, he
[1:34:00] called it your mama hate music. It's
[1:34:02] what it does. You get under that
[1:34:04] nonsense and you
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching. You don't have to tell
[1:34:07] me. I know I am.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; GET UNDER THAT NONSENSE AND IT STARTS
[1:34:10] AFFECTING THE WAY YOU TALK TO YOUR MAMA.
[1:34:12] AFFECTING OH, COME ON. I DON'T HAVE TO
[1:34:14] TELL I DON'T HAVE TO BE A PROPHET TO
[1:34:16] TELL A BOY'S LISTEN TO COUNTRY MUSIC.
[1:34:17] ALL OF A SUDDEN, TOBACA SHOWS UP IN THE
[1:34:19] LIP. COME ON. AND EVERY WOMAN, COME I'm
[1:34:22] preaching to you. AMEN. IT'S BECAUSE
[1:34:24] SOMEWHERE WE'VE GOT DISTRACTED. BUT
[1:34:27] THERE'S A MESSAGE, FOLKS. AND IF A
[1:34:29] PROPHET WAS LOYAL AND REVERENT TO IT, I
[1:34:32] THINK IT'S TIME WE WHO CLAIM TO BE THE
[1:34:34] BENEFICIARIES OF THIS MESSAGE OUGHT TO
[1:34:36] LIFT IT UP AGAIN AND POINT EVERY FAMILY,
[1:34:39] POINT EVERY YOUNG PERSON, POINT EVERY
[1:34:41] PREACHER. OH, IF I COULD COMPEL
[1:34:44] EVERYBODY TONIGHT, LIFT HIM UP UNTIL HE
[1:34:47] BEGINS TO LEAD YOU INTO THE RICHES OF
[1:34:50] HIS GRACE AND THE DEPTHS OF HIS MERCY.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I WANT TO KNOW HIM BEYOND THE
[1:34:56] SURFACE RELATIONSHIP. I WANT TO KNOW HIM
[1:34:58] BEYOND THE KITCHEN EXPERIENCE. I WANT TO
[1:35:00] KNOW HIM BEYOND THE LIVING ROOM. I WANT
[1:35:02] TO KNOW HIM IN THE STILLNESS OF HIS
[1:35:04] SPIRIT WHEN HE begins to unfold secrets
[1:35:06] to me.
[1:35:10] You say, "Preacher, why are you
[1:35:11] preaching on those things?" Because you
[1:35:12] can't keep firing your soul and feed on
[1:35:14] that nonsense.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just preached to you. Cuz I've
[1:35:19] seen I've seen romance novels destroy
[1:35:21] marriages.
[1:35:23] YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE WOMEN GET IN THEIR
[1:35:25] MIND some image of a man and there ain't
[1:35:27] no man can ever fit that image.
[1:35:30] Well, Brother Bram called them True
[1:35:32] Story magazines.
[1:35:34] Come on, FOLKS. I'M PREACHING. BROTHER
[1:35:36] BRHAM CALLED THEM TRUE STORY MAGAZINES.
[1:35:38] LISTEN, THEY'RE FILTH.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; WELL, brother Andrew, what are you
[1:35:43] talking about? I'm talking about
[1:35:44] religion that's called it okay.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT I'M TALKING ABOUT
[1:35:49] CONFUSED THEOLOGIANS THAT HAVE TAKEN OUR
[1:35:52] FOCUS OFF OF THE STANDARDS OF THE WORD
[1:35:53] OF GOD AND THE POWER OF GOD. SAID THE
[1:35:56] REVIVAL FIRES ARE DIMIN. NOW LISTEN, I
[1:35:58] DON'T HAVE TO JUST HIT ON BOOKS. I can
[1:35:59] hit on movies.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Are we are we are we are
[1:36:03] we keeping the standards? Are we keeping
[1:36:05] our center of traction on the word or
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Oh God, folks, it's the truth.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; SEEING THE GREAT REVIVAL FIRES BEGIN TO
[1:36:15] DUMB DIM DOWN, LET US FIND ANOTHER MOVIE
[1:36:18] AND LET US FIND THE NEW BOOK and find
[1:36:20] the new country SONG OR NEW ROCK AND LET
[1:36:22] US THROW ON SOME WOOD OF THE WORD.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; COME ON. IF THE FIRE IS GOING DOWN, THAT
[1:36:27] AIN'T THE TIME TO MISS CHURCH. IF THE
[1:36:29] FIRE IS GOING DOWN, THAT AIN'T IT TIME
[1:36:31] TO BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE PERVERSION OF
[1:36:34] LEODYSA.
[1:36:35] THAT'S THE TIME TO GET IN THIS MESSAGE
[1:36:37] AND DIG YOU OUT SOME LOGS AND BEGIN TO
[1:36:40] THROW THE LOGS.
[1:36:42] COME ON, CHURCH. LET ME ASK ONE TIME,
[1:36:43] THEY SAID, "WHY IN THE WORLD, AMEN, DO
[1:36:45] YOU POST QUOTES ON FACEBOOK ALL THE
[1:36:47] TIME?" I SAID, "CUZ MAYBE SOMEBODY MIGHT
[1:36:49] SEE SOMETHING WORTH LOOKING at one
[1:36:50] time."
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. WE ADVERTISE
[1:36:54] EVERYTHING ELSE. WHY DON'T WE ADVERTISE
[1:36:56] THE POWER OF GOD? WHY DON'T WE ADVERTISE
[1:36:58] THE MESSAGE OF IT? WHY DON'T WE
[1:37:00] ADVERTISE THAT OVER HERE ON THE SIDE OF
[1:37:02] THE ROAD IN BLACK ROCKCK, ARKANSAS,
[1:37:04] THERE IS A GOD WHO'S A SAVIOR? THERE'S A
[1:37:06] GOD WHO IS A HEALER. THERE'S A GOD WHO'S
[1:37:08] A DELIVERER. THERE'S A GOD WHO'S MOVING
[1:37:11] AND HEALING AND DELIVERING
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; IF I BE LIFTED UP. Somebody say, "What
[1:37:16] are you talking about?" Amen. I don't
[1:37:17] just want it to be A POSTER BOARD. AMEN.
[1:37:19] I DON'T THINK our best sign of this
[1:37:20] church ought to be out there on the
[1:37:22] highway.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SIGN AND THANK GOD FOR
[1:37:25] IT, BROTHER BOBBY. AMEN. I DON'T THINK
[1:37:27] THE BEST SIGN OUGHT TO BE AT THE END OF
[1:37:28] THE CHURCH ROAD. I THINK IT OUGHT TO BE
[1:37:30] THE CHARACTER OF THIS MESSAGE REFLECTED
[1:37:33] IN EVERY MEMBER OF THIS ASSEMBLY.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; I SAY, "GOD, START WITH ME, LORD."
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; SEE, Satan is very strategic in his
[1:37:44] attacks.
[1:37:46] He knows his timing.
[1:37:48] Oh, yeah. Devil knows his timing. What
[1:37:51] is timing? Now, look here. when he when
[1:37:54] he sends his distractions
[1:37:56] is when he's got it timed down just
[1:37:58] right. Now, brother B said this, there's
[1:38:01] a purpose in him sending them
[1:38:02] distractions.
[1:38:05] Y'all still love me?
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose in him sending them
[1:38:08] distractions. You know what it is? It's
[1:38:10] to rob you of the moment.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; It's to rob you of the moment. Now,
[1:38:16] watch this. The thief cometh not but for
[1:38:19] to bless you and to encourage you.
[1:38:24] THE THIEF COMETH NOT BUT FOR TO steal
[1:38:27] and TO KILL AND TO DESTROY.
[1:38:31] BUT I
[1:38:32] IF I BE LIFTED UP, I AM COME THAT THEY
[1:38:36] MIGHT HAVE LIFE AND THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE
[1:38:39] IT MORE ABUNDANTLY. Now look here. Amen.
[1:38:42] AMEN. SOMEBODY SAY, "WHY ARE YOU
[1:38:43] PREACHING THIS?" I'VE been this for
[1:38:44] about two weeks. It's been in my not.
[1:38:46] Here we are. Can we preach a second?
[1:38:47] AMEN. COME LADY, HOW DO YOU DO LADY?
[1:38:50] COME HERE JUST A MINUTE. NO, MOTHER. I
[1:38:52] NOW WATCH THE DEVIL'S TIMING. OKAY,
[1:38:55] brother the discernment. He says, I WANT
[1:38:57] YOU TO RAISE UP. RAISE HER UP. DON'T LAY
[1:39:00] DOWN. LOOK HERE AT ME. DO you believe me
[1:39:03] TO BE GOD'S PROPHET? DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT
[1:39:06] you're hearing is the truth? Are you
[1:39:09] ready for this? YOU'RE GETTING AWFULLY
[1:39:12] SICK, aren't you?
[1:39:15] IS THE REASON YOU'RE DOING THAT.
[1:39:18] SATAN IS TRYING TO ROB YOU.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; COME ON. SHE'S BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
[1:39:25] MOMENT FOR YEARS TO BE SITTING SIS IN
[1:39:28] THE PRESENCE OF GOD WITH THE PROPHET OF
[1:39:30] GOD TO PRAY FOR HER AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
[1:39:32] SHE STARTS GETTING AWFULLY SICK. WHY
[1:39:34] DIDN'T SHE GET AWFULLY SICK AT THE
[1:39:35] HOUSE? WHY DIDN'T SHE GET AWFULLY SICK?
[1:39:38] AMEN. DURING THE SONG SERVICE, BROTHER
[1:39:40] DAY PAUL, WHY DIDN'T SHE GET AWFULLY
[1:39:41] SICK WHILE HE WAS PREACHING? BUT RIGHT
[1:39:43] THERE, THAT OLD STRATEGIC DEVIL HAD SO
[1:39:46] TIMED IT DOWN. AND IF HE COULD JUST GET
[1:39:48] HER ATTENTION ON A DISTRACTION AND GET
[1:39:50] HER REAL SICK, HE SAID, "SATAN'S TRYING
[1:39:53] TO ROB YOU. BUT IF YOU'LL BELIEVE ME TO
[1:39:55] BE HIS SERVANT TONIGHT, YOUR DELIVERANCE
[1:39:57] IS HERE. YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY TO COME
[1:39:59] HERE, HAVEN'T YOU?"
[1:40:01] Here's another one. Here's a man sitting
[1:40:03] in front of me. He has suffered with
[1:40:04] arthritis. I don't know whether he's
[1:40:06] going to get it or not. He's kind of a
[1:40:07] man about my age. HE SUFFERS WITH
[1:40:09] ARTHRITIS. HE IS NOT FROM HERE. HE IS
[1:40:12] FROM KANSAS CITY. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
[1:40:15] GOD WILL HEAL YOU? DO YOU BELIEVE GOD
[1:40:17] CAN TELL ME WHAT YOUR NAME IS?
[1:40:22] MR. FRANCIS, do you BELIEVE WITH ALL
[1:40:25] YOUR heart he was trying to rob you from
[1:40:28] it, sir?
[1:40:32] You was thinking I was meaning another
[1:40:34] man, but it was you.
[1:40:38] AND WHEN I SAID THAT, A REAL FUNNY
[1:40:40] FEELING COME OVER YOU real sweet AND
[1:40:42] WARM. IF THAT'S RIGHT, WAVE YOUR HAND
[1:40:44] LIKE THIS. Now go your way. You're
[1:40:47] healed.
[1:40:48] Glory to God. ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME
[1:40:50] TONIGHT? THAT DEVIL'S TIME RIGHT NOW.
[1:40:53] HE'S TRYING TO DISTRACT. YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:40:54] I'M TALKING ABOUT? WHEN THE PREACHER'S
[1:40:56] PREACHING, THAT DEVIL STARTS TRYING TO
[1:40:57] DISTRACT YOU. WELL, HE'S HITTING THE
[1:40:59] THIS AND HE'S HITTING THAT AND HE OH,
[1:41:00] NO. AMEN. WHY DON'T YOU STAND UP AND
[1:41:02] LOOK THAT DEVIL IN THE FACE AND SAY, "I
[1:41:04] KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. HE'S PREACHING THE
[1:41:06] WORD." AND THROWING some logs of the
[1:41:09] WOOD OF THE WORD ON THE FIRE TO BURN.
[1:41:13] I SEE A MAN I believe it was DOWN THERE
[1:41:15] HERE THE OTHER MEETING said now now look
[1:41:17] here not everybody got it
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; he said I see a man sitting here and the
[1:41:21] Holy Spirit I've been watching him when
[1:41:23] I was preaching he was a crippled man he
[1:41:26] had crutches under his arm and just when
[1:41:29] I started to make the call Satan come to
[1:41:32] the man a black shadow and I watched it
[1:41:34] with my own eyes
[1:41:36] he got up and walked out.
[1:41:42] Now, folks, you may not do that
[1:41:43] physically,
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; but don't you let the devil make you do
[1:41:46] that mentally?
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Word of God gets to being preached, the
[1:41:54] pastor, the man of God, whoever stand
[1:41:56] there preaching the word and the devil
[1:41:57] says, "Oh, well, listen. Let me tell you
[1:41:59] what this is about." And you listen to
[1:42:01] that devil and you just get up and check
[1:42:02] out mentally. Well, he ain't got no
[1:42:03] business saying that. He ain't got no
[1:42:05] right preaching.
[1:42:07] This is what a pro OF GOD SAID. HE GOT
[1:42:09] UP AND WALKED OUT, HE'LL ALWAYS BE A
[1:42:12] CRIPPLED. SO WERE HE BE HEALED RIGHT
[1:42:14] HERE. IF HE WOULD HAVE JUST SEE, BUT YOU
[1:42:16] I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY. ARE Y'ALL READY
[1:42:18] FOR THIS? I'M BRINGING THIS DOWN RIGHT
[1:42:20] HERE. ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? I GUESS HE
[1:42:22] JUST LISTENED to the enemy.
[1:42:26] So you mean in a service you got a
[1:42:28] chance to listen to the word
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; or listen to the enemy?
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; SEE, GOD LIKENS PEOPLE UNTO SHEEP. And
[1:42:35] sheep are wonders. THEY'RE CONFUSED.
[1:42:38] THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE. The
[1:42:40] shepherd's calls are coming from
[1:42:42] everywhere. But Jesus said, "The sheep
[1:42:44] follow him, for they know his voice, and
[1:42:47] a stranger will they not follow, but
[1:42:50] will flee from him, for they know not
[1:42:53] the voice of strangers." Look at this
[1:42:56] word stranger. It's another man's, other
[1:42:59] men's, belonging to another, a
[1:43:02] foreigner, a stranger, not of one's own
[1:43:05] family.
[1:43:07] an alien, an enemy. Rebraham said, "See,
[1:43:10] you can't die. You're done quickening."
[1:43:12] Or if the church could only see that,
[1:43:14] it's not what you're going to be. You
[1:43:16] already are. It's the devil trying to
[1:43:19] rob you from that.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Well, SAY, "NOW, I TELL YOU, I BELONG TO
[1:43:24] THIS." I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU belong to.
[1:43:27] You got to be born, REGENERATED,
[1:43:30] BAPTIZED WITH THE HOLY Ghost into Jesus
[1:43:32] Christ, quickened to every word. Your
[1:43:35] spirit in you will punctuate amen to
[1:43:38] every word OF THE BIBLE. OUTSIDE OF
[1:43:41] THAT, IF IT SHAKES ITS HEAD ON ONE, YOU
[1:43:44] GET RID OF THAT SPIRIT. IT'S NOT THE
[1:43:47] SPIRIT OF GOD THAT would dispute the
[1:43:50] word of God.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; It'll keep the word of God. Not only
[1:43:54] does it believe it, but it makes it
[1:43:56] live. It manifests the word of God. But
[1:43:59] by one spirit, we're all baptized into
[1:44:00] one body. And that body is a family. the
[1:44:03] family of God. And that's the house of
[1:44:06] God. And the house of God is the name of
[1:44:09] Jesus Christ. Look here. I have chosen
[1:44:11] to put my name at the door of the house
[1:44:13] of my worship. For my family will be
[1:44:16] gathered in there under the blood like
[1:44:18] it was in Egypt. Anything outside. And
[1:44:21] in there, are y'all ready for this? In
[1:44:24] there, there's no leaven bread. There's
[1:44:26] no denominational mixture in it
[1:44:29] anywhere. IT'S MY HOUSE. MY CHILDREN
[1:44:33] BORN to my genes. My genes are in them.
[1:44:36] I put my word in them. I'll write them
[1:44:39] up on the TABLES OF THEIR HEART. THAT'S
[1:44:41] MY FAMILY. THE FAMILY of the body of
[1:44:45] Jesus Christ. Oh my. Satan sends
[1:44:48] distractions in all kinds of forms. He
[1:44:50] tried to distract Elisha from that
[1:44:52] double portion by the critics and
[1:44:54] unbelievers. Brother said he tried to
[1:44:56] distract Peter from getting to Jesus
[1:44:58] with the winds on the water. He got his
[1:45:00] eyes off of Jesus and began to look at
[1:45:02] how big the waves was. When he seen the
[1:45:04] waves were contrary, he began to sink.
[1:45:06] Are y'all ready for this tonight? And
[1:45:08] every man that will look at his
[1:45:09] affliction after being prayed for
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; is sure to sink.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; What about every man that'll that'll
[1:45:18] hear the word of God and go back to
[1:45:19] doing things that the word of God
[1:45:20] condemns?
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm in the message. You don't
[1:45:26] look at your affliction. You keep your
[1:45:28] EYES ON THE PROMISEGIVER, THE LORD JESUS
[1:45:31] CHRIST. YOU KEEP YOUR EYES ON HIS WORD.
[1:45:36] HE'S THE ONE WHO PROMISED. HE WATCHES
[1:45:38] OVER IT to perform it. He keeps it in
[1:45:41] the hollow OF HIS HAND. AND IN the
[1:45:43] depths of his heart, it's beded. His
[1:45:45] word has to be true. Get your mind off
[1:45:48] your sickness, off your troubles, and
[1:45:51] keep your eyes on Jesus.
[1:45:55] If I be lifted up, I will draw a men to
[1:45:59] myself. Let our musicians come tonight.
[1:46:02] What is the attraction? My I got a whole
[1:46:04] message here. What is the attraction?
[1:46:06] Brother said, "Here it is." He said,
[1:46:08] "It's God fulfilling his word." Now,
[1:46:13] folks, I know I know maybe sometimes
[1:46:15] somebody say, "Well,
[1:46:17] I don't I don't I don't understand why
[1:46:19] the word has got to be so hard." Well,
[1:46:21] really, the word's not that hard.
[1:46:23] It's not. Reb said the word's a love
[1:46:26] letter.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; But I'll just say this to you. The Holy
[1:46:30] Spirit draws by an instinct, by an
[1:46:33] inward power. I think of how, and I'll
[1:46:36] just I'll just close on this. I think of
[1:46:39] how when you're really when you're
[1:46:40] really in love with something, when
[1:46:43] you're really identified in something,
[1:46:45] when you're really when you're really
[1:46:47] connected to something, that no matter
[1:46:49] what you're going through, when you
[1:46:52] begin to look at it, it'll begin to pull
[1:46:55] you out. Y'all y'all ever y'all ever
[1:46:58] experienced that? I sitting in my office
[1:47:00] today studying and I got a chair in the
[1:47:03] corner of my office and then there's a
[1:47:04] window on the other side of the of my
[1:47:07] office here, Brother David.
[1:47:08] And and there's a scripture that the
[1:47:10] Lord gave me when I first started
[1:47:12] preaching, when I got ordained, when God
[1:47:14] called me in the ministry and the my
[1:47:16] pastor at the time and brother Bill
[1:47:18] ordained me in the ministry. There was a
[1:47:20] scripture the Lord gave me. It was Acts
[1:47:21] chapter 20 verse 24. I don't know if
[1:47:23] maybe you could pull that up for me if
[1:47:24] there's anybody up there. I I'll just
[1:47:26] say it to you like this. I was sitting
[1:47:28] in my office today and I was preaching.
[1:47:30] And I think I was up somewhere and
[1:47:32] brother brother Isaac Hatfield heard me
[1:47:34] say that that the Lord gave me that
[1:47:35] scripture and that the Lord gave it to
[1:47:37] me in my heart and just I told the
[1:47:39] little bit the testimony of it and
[1:47:41] brother Isaac heard it and I don't know
[1:47:42] it's about two or three weeks later I
[1:47:44] got a package on the front door. Brother
[1:47:46] David it was a it was a picture frame of
[1:47:48] the cloud and it had the cloud turned
[1:47:51] and on the on the writing on that was
[1:47:53] that scripture Acts chapter 20 verse 24
[1:47:56] and I and it was it was just just
[1:47:58] printed right there on it. And so I
[1:47:59] actually when I when I when I got it, I
[1:48:01] hung it up above a window just just
[1:48:04] right there. And you ever you ever just
[1:48:06] get discouraged and
[1:48:09] two of you, three of you, you ever just
[1:48:11] get real down?
[1:48:13] See, but if there's something you're
[1:48:15] connected to ever gets lifted up where
[1:48:16] you can see it and brother Mark, I sit
[1:48:19] in my office today and just going
[1:48:21] through some thoughts in my mind and
[1:48:22] battles and pressures and situations and
[1:48:25] and you know, even preachers go through
[1:48:26] that.
[1:48:28] And I just I was just sitting there. I
[1:48:30] don't know. I'll find it here real
[1:48:31] quick. I want to read it to you. I was
[1:48:33] just sitting there in my office. And
[1:48:35] while I was sitting there, I just
[1:48:37] started praying. I was listening to a
[1:48:38] tape and something in my heart just
[1:48:40] said, "Look up." And brother, I just
[1:48:42] looked up and when I looked up, my eyes
[1:48:44] fell on that picture. And that verse
[1:48:47] says this, "None of these things move
[1:48:49] me.
[1:48:51] Neither count I my life DEAR UNTO MYSELF
[1:48:53] SO THAT I MIGHT finish my course with
[1:48:55] joy and the ministry which I have
[1:48:58] received of the LORD JESUS TO TESTIFY
[1:49:01] THE gospel of the grace of God.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Bryant, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
[1:49:05] HAPPENED, BUT IT WAS LIKE A HAND JUST
[1:49:07] COME RIGHT DOWN IN THAT LITTLE office
[1:49:08] out THERE AND JUST PULLED ME RIGHT UP
[1:49:10] OUT OF THAT. ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME? THAT
[1:49:13] SAME GOD IS RIGHT HERE IN THIS BUILDING
[1:49:15] TONIGHT. LISTEN, NO MATTER HOW LOW YOU
[1:49:17] ARE, BROTHER TRAVIS, NO MATTER WHAT
[1:49:19] YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, IF I BE LIFTED UP,
[1:49:22] NOT THE PREACHER, BROTHER CARTER, NOT A
[1:49:24] MAN, BUT IF CHRIST BE LIFTED UP, WHO IS
[1:49:26] YOUR LIFE, WHO IS YOUR SALVATION, AND
[1:49:29] YOU CAN LOOK AT HIM, SISTER JOYCE, HE'LL
[1:49:31] PULL YOU RIGHT OUT OF WHATEVER YOU'RE
[1:49:32] GOING THROUGH.
[1:49:34] Y'all believe that tonight?
[1:49:37] Won't you stand to your feet with us
[1:49:38] tonight?
[1:49:40] See, what he is is he's the inside.
[1:49:43] He's the inside.
[1:49:49] He's the inside.
[1:49:51] And if I be lifted up,
[1:49:56] if I be lifted up, I'll draw all men
[1:49:58] unto myself. See, but before an end sign
[1:50:01] can have an effect, it's got to be
[1:50:03] lifted.
[1:50:05] Before it can have a before it can
[1:50:07] affect you, Brother Brian, it's got to
[1:50:08] be up so high you can see it. I remember
[1:50:12] I remember a brother told me one time he
[1:50:14] said he said I was preaching in a church
[1:50:15] and while I was preaching I read a quote
[1:50:17] and I said brother Brandham said he said
[1:50:19] some man in the crowd hollered out and
[1:50:20] said who's brother Brandham.
[1:50:24] I kind of chuckled. He said what's so
[1:50:26] funny? I said well cuz they ain't never
[1:50:27] lifted the message up high enough so
[1:50:29] they can see what's going on in the
[1:50:30] church.
[1:50:33] See unless an in sign is lifted it'll
[1:50:36] never have an effect. Do you know Sister
[1:50:39] Beth and the inside will never affect
[1:50:40] you until you can see it?
[1:50:43] Remember that serpent on the pole? If
[1:50:44] you were bitten, had to be raised up and
[1:50:47] then you had to look and live. It
[1:50:48] couldn't just be on the pole. It had to
[1:50:50] be lifted where somebody could put their
[1:50:52] eyes on it. And brother Bobby, they
[1:50:53] could concentrate on it. And as they
[1:50:55] concentrated on it, healing virtue would
[1:50:56] begin to come to their life. But it had
[1:50:59] to be lifted. Listen, I don't know about
[1:51:01] you tonight, but I'm not afraid to raise
[1:51:02] my hand and say, "I am not ashamed of
[1:51:04] this message.
[1:51:06] I am not ashamed of the standards of a
[1:51:08] prophet taught. I AM NOT ASHAMED TO SAY,
[1:51:10] "LORD, whatever it takes in my life to
[1:51:12] circumcise me, keep the revival fires
[1:51:14] burning."
[1:51:17] I'm not ashamed of it. It's an insign.
[1:51:20] It's a rallying point. It's the
[1:51:22] attraction of my life. I remember back
[1:51:25] in the summer, I was over in in Czech
[1:51:27] Republic. I flew in there to preach and
[1:51:30] the brother text me. He said, "There's
[1:51:32] going to be a young man to pick you up
[1:51:33] at the airport." It's kind of I'm kind
[1:51:35] of probably getting ahead of myself, but
[1:51:36] I feel like telling it tonight. Gonna be
[1:51:38] a young boy pick up at the airport.
[1:51:40] Said, "Now, now you've never seen him
[1:51:42] before, but he'll be holding a picture."
[1:51:45] And it'll be a picture, Brother Brandham
[1:51:46] with the pillar of fire over his head
[1:51:48] and said, "He'll be holding that picture
[1:51:49] and said, "Look for him, and when you
[1:51:52] see him, go with him." Brother Ryan,
[1:51:55] when I walked out of the airport, there
[1:51:56] was a lot of people standing there
[1:51:57] holding pictures and cards and signs,
[1:51:59] but there was one little boy over in the
[1:52:00] corner and he had his picture up real
[1:52:02] high and I turned my head up.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of people SAYING, "YOU
[1:52:07] NEED A WELL, they weren't saying it like
[1:52:08] that. You need a taxi. You need a ride.
[1:52:10] You need Hey, hey, YOU NEED A RIDE. HEY,
[1:52:12] HEY, YOU NEED AND BROTHER, I JUST WALKED
[1:52:13] RIGHT THROUGH THEM WITH MY HEAD UP CUZ
[1:52:15] MY EYES HAD CAUGHT MY IDENTIFYING. MY
[1:52:18] EYES HAD CAUGHT WHAT I'M IDENTIFYING
[1:52:20] WITH. AND I WAS WALKING ABOVE ALL THE
[1:52:22] DISTRACTIONS. I WAS WALKING ABOVE ALL
[1:52:24] THE VOICES. I WAS NOT PAYING ATTENTION
[1:52:26] TO ANY OF IT BECAUSE I WAS CONCENTRATED
[1:52:28] ON WHAT COME TO PICK ME UP. CHURCH, THIS
[1:52:32] MESSAGE HAS COME TO CARRY YOU OUT OF
[1:52:34] THIS WORLD.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Lift your eyes up tonight and focus on
[1:52:38] it. Ignore the distractions.
[1:52:42] Almighty God, we bow our hearts in your
[1:52:43] presence tonight. Lord, your word is
[1:52:46] true. Father, I believe you're right
[1:52:49] here in this building tonight speaking
[1:52:50] to hearts and lives. Lord, I know the
[1:52:53] enemy's come in like a flood. And Lord,
[1:52:56] to say some of these things are not
[1:52:57] popular, Lord, are not. Lord, it's
[1:52:59] become an age where it seems as if no
[1:53:02] one wants to just just slow down and say
[1:53:04] things a prophet said. Lord, sometimes
[1:53:06] you got to dig into it. And Lord, you
[1:53:08] got to you got to find that that meat of
[1:53:11] this message, Lord. But Lord, there's
[1:53:13] one thing about it. Sometimes a prophet
[1:53:15] will dig real deep into it. Sometimes
[1:53:17] he'll he'll just hit it as he's
[1:53:19] preaching along and keep on moving. But
[1:53:21] Lord, if we'll just stay concentrated on
[1:53:23] it, no matter if it's a high spot, a low
[1:53:25] spot, Lord, if it's a corrective spot,
[1:53:28] if it's a if it's a blessing spot, if
[1:53:30] it's a shouting spot, Lord, Lord,
[1:53:32] THERE'S NO PART OF THIS MESSAGE that we
[1:53:34] have to bypass. There's no part of this
[1:53:37] message, Lord, that's a distraction.
[1:53:39] Lord, your prophet said it's that third
[1:53:41] pull. It's that one I must be loyal and
[1:53:44] reverent to. Lord, I believe right here
[1:53:46] tonight there's a group of believers
[1:53:48] that have gathered themselves inside of
[1:53:50] this sanctuary on a Wednesday evening.
[1:53:52] Lord, maybe the devil's trying to
[1:53:54] distract him. Lord, maybe the devil's
[1:53:56] trying to beset him in some way or
[1:53:58] trying to reroute him. Lord, father, as
[1:54:00] I was just hearing your prophet say
[1:54:02] yesterday in victory day, he said when a
[1:54:04] Christian gets so close to victory, he
[1:54:07] said that's when the devil begins to
[1:54:08] reroute them and try to reroute their
[1:54:10] path. I thought, "Oh, God, don't let
[1:54:13] that be said about one believer here
[1:54:14] tonight. Lord, DON'T LET THAT BE SAID
[1:54:16] ABOUT A ONE OF US TONIGHT that Lord, we
[1:54:18] were so close to victory, but we let the
[1:54:21] devil in his strategic, slimy, shrewd
[1:54:23] way come in and reroute us. Lord, don't
[1:54:26] let it be said that we got our eyes off
[1:54:28] of the focus. We got our eyes off of the
[1:54:31] attraction and we got our eyes over on
[1:54:33] the distractions, LORD. BUT LORD, LET US
[1:54:35] BE LIKE MARTHA, FATHER. LORD, LET US LET
[1:54:38] US BE LIKE LORD, LET US BE LIKE THAT
[1:54:39] WOMAN in the Bible, Lord, that washed
[1:54:41] your feet, FATHER. LORD, LET US BE LIKE
[1:54:44] THAT ONE THAT WILL TEND UP ON YOU
[1:54:45] without distraction. Lord, I raise my
[1:54:48] hands to you tonight, LORD. I SAY,
[1:54:50] FATHER, FORGIVE ME FOR GETTING
[1:54:51] DISTRACTED. I SAY, LORD, FORGIVE ME FOR
[1:54:53] LETTING THE ENEMY SHIFT MY FOCUS, LORD.
[1:54:56] LORD, MAYBE SOMEONE SITTING HERE
[1:54:57] TONIGHT, THEY HEAR YOUR WORD SPEAKING TO
[1:54:59] THEM. MAYBE RIGHT NOW THEY JUST WANT TO
[1:55:00] SLIP UP THEIR HAND TO you and SAY,
[1:55:02] "LORD, FORGIVE ME FOR GETTING
[1:55:04] DISTRACTED. LORD, FATHER, FORGIVE ME FOR
[1:55:06] LETTING MY EYES WONDER, MY THOUGHTS
[1:55:08] WONDER, MY MIND WONDER. LORD, I WANT TO
[1:55:10] STAY SPIRITUALLY CONCENTRATED ON THIS
[1:55:12] WORD. LORD, I WANT TO STAY SPIRITUALLY
[1:55:14] FOCUSED ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN this
[1:55:16] hour, Lord. I don't want to focus on my
[1:55:18] past. It's behind me, Lord. I don't WANT
[1:55:20] TO CONCENTRATE ON MY MISTAKES. I DON'T
[1:55:22] WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON MY FAILURES,
[1:55:24] LORD. BUT, LORD, I WANT TO CONCENTRATE
