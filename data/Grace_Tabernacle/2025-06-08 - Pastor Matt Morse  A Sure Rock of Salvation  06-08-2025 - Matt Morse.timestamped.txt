[40:33] God, we just are so honored, Lord, to be
[40:36] able to take the word of God and to be
[40:38] able to read it. And Lord, you've given
[40:41] us the ability to open the book and
[40:43] Lord, to take the words that are there
[40:45] and and to speak them before the people.
[40:48] And but Lord, even in all of that, Lord,
[40:50] we couldn't bring any revelation from
[40:53] it. Lord, the power that lays within it.
[40:56] Lord, we couldn't give that power, but
[40:58] Lord, that all falls upon you. And Lord,
[41:00] we just ask you this morning, Lord, that
[41:02] you would anoint the word that has been
[41:04] given. And we just ask that you would
[41:07] help each one, every hand that's raised,
[41:09] every need that needs to be met this
[41:11] morning, every soul that needs saved,
[41:14] every person that needs healing. God, we
[41:17] just rely upon you to do what you do
[41:20] this morning. God, we just ask you that
[41:22] you would be with each one. Lord, we
[41:23] pray that you would anoint this word,
[41:25] Lord, that we would go from this place
[41:26] knowing that we've been in your presence
[41:28] and we'll be careful to give you the
[41:30] glory for all you do. In Jesus name we
[41:32] pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you this
[41:36] morning. We just want to invite you to
[41:37] the scripture. Uh we're going to read
[41:39] out of the book of uh First Kings, the
[41:41] 17th chapter or the the 16th chapter.
[41:44] And we'll start in the 33rd verse. in
[41:48] the 16th chapter and the 33rd verse and
[41:51] um we'll read the 33rd and the 3 uh
[41:55] fourth verse. We'll give you just a
[41:57] moment uh to get to there. Can you turn
[42:00] that? Amen. Just a moment. Can you Thank
[42:05] you,
[42:07] buddy. Amen. When you get there, just
[42:10] say amen. How many loves the word? Amen.
[42:13] And we just certainly enjoy the singing
[42:15] and my it it's just a I think that young
[42:18] lady wrote that song she was singing
[42:20] this morning and my isn't that a
[42:22] wonderful gift. Amen. How many
[42:23] appreciates that this morning and Amen.
[42:26] God bless
[42:28] you. Just appreciate all the gifts that
[42:31] God brings our way. Amen. But we want to
[42:35] take uh this scripture uh first Kings
[42:37] the 16th chapter. if you'll help me
[42:39] speak something that the Lord has put on
[42:40] my heart and uh kind of build from where
[42:44] we were a couple Sundays ago. But um
[42:47] just kind of go this direction. First
[42:48] Kings 16 in the 33rd verse it says, "And
[42:52] Ahab made a grove and Ahab did more to
[42:55] provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger
[42:58] than all the kings of Israel that were
[43:00] before him. And in his days did Hile the
[43:03] Bethlite build Jericho. He laid the
[43:06] foundation thereof, and Abram his
[43:08] firstborn, and set up the gates thereof,
[43:10] and his youngest son, Seag, according to
[43:12] the word of the Lord, which he spake by
[43:14] Joshua, the son of Nun. I also want to
[43:17] read out of Matthew out of the uh
[43:20] seventh chapter, and we'll read in the
[43:22] 24th verse. Matthew 7 and 24.
[43:27] Jesus says,
[43:29] "Therefore, whosoever heareth these
[43:32] sayings of mine and doeth them, I will
[43:34] liken him unto a wise man which built
[43:37] his house upon a rock." And the rain
[43:39] descended, and the floods came, and the
[43:42] winds blew, and he beat upon that house,
[43:44] and it fell not, for it was founded upon
[43:46] a rock. And everyone that heareth these
[43:49] sayings of mine, and doeth them not,
[43:50] shall be likened unto a foolish man,
[43:52] which built his house upon the sand. and
[43:55] the rain descended and the floods came
[43:57] and the winds blew and he beat upon the
[43:59] house and it fell and great was the fall
[44:02] of it. We'll just ask the Lord to add
[44:04] his blessing to the reading of the word
[44:06] this morning as you take your seats. I
[44:08] would like to speak on uh this subject
[44:10] this morning on a sure rock of
[44:14] salvation. A sure rock of salvation. I
[44:18] was reading out of this book of Kings
[44:20] and uh you know over the past couple of
[44:22] weeks I've been reading uh from these
[44:25] chapters and of course we read here at
[44:27] the end of the chapter 16 uh this had
[44:30] this had came this little portion of the
[44:33] Bible had came uh after it was it was
[44:36] writing all the way from the the 15th
[44:37] chapter into the 16th chapter. The Bible
[44:40] is telling us the story. Of course, if
[44:42] you read the book of Kings, it was
[44:43] written by the prophet Jeremiah, and
[44:45] he's writing about all of the kings that
[44:48] reigned over Israel during this this uh
[44:51] uh time period. I think it was around uh
[44:54] 400 or so years in the time that
[44:56] Jeremiah wrote First Kings and Second
[44:57] Kings. And uh and he writes of the Kings
[45:00] and really the context of the entire
[45:02] book of Kings is uh the kings that were
[45:05] coming into office and whether or not
[45:07] they served the Lord or not. And it was
[45:09] uh it showed how that they managed their
[45:12] kingdom and then how that God always had
[45:14] a prophet that was on the scene that
[45:16] would go to the kings and was trying to
[45:18] keep the kings in order. So there was
[45:20] there was great conflict through the
[45:21] whole two books of of the kings being uh
[45:24] coming and going and descending and uh
[45:26] and ascending unto the throne and God
[45:28] trying to keep them in order.
[45:30] But you'll notice as you get into the
[45:32] 16th chapter that here uh uh from 15 on
[45:35] that that from the sins that Jeroboam
[45:38] had bought or had committed uh that the
[45:40] Bible every time it would talk about
[45:42] another king it would say and he uh
[45:44] followed after the sins of Jeroboam and
[45:46] it didn't matter uh it just seems like
[45:48] everyone especially in this chapter
[45:49] there wasn't a single king that was a
[45:51] good king. So during this whole uh uh
[45:53] time period they were wicked kings and
[45:55] they followed after Jeroboam. You know
[45:57] how how that Jeroboam had when he had
[45:59] came into office and he had uh taken the
[46:01] kingdom of Israel and had brought in
[46:04] idols and put uh put these great uh
[46:07] images up on all the high places where
[46:09] all the temples used to be and uh and
[46:11] and Jeroboam the greatest uh evil thing
[46:14] that he done is Jeroboam actually called
[46:16] people to ministry. He would put he
[46:18] established all these young men and
[46:20] anybody that could hold a microphone
[46:21] Jeroboam would put them in office. He
[46:22] just wanted somebody to sit in the
[46:24] priest house that would be able to uh to
[46:27] be able to to say that he had a lot of
[46:28] them and had a lot of houses of worship
[46:30] and all these places and uh but they
[46:32] were out of the Levitical lineage. So
[46:35] they weren't worthy to be in that
[46:36] office. But Jerobo put him in that
[46:38] office because he was trying to build a
[46:40] great kingdom. But because of this, the
[46:41] Bible would pro or the the prophet would
[46:43] come and he would prophesy against him
[46:45] that great would be his fall and that
[46:47] and that his that his family would be
[46:49] ate by dogs and the foul of the air and
[46:51] all these things that would come upon
[46:52] his life. And so we realize that a as
[46:54] you would read through the the kings
[46:56] that follow Jeroboam, it was constantly
[46:58] failure, failure, failure. from the king
[47:00] of Naab to Basha to Eli to Zimry to
[47:04] Omry, which is the father of of Ahab.
[47:06] Uh, every king that you would read in
[47:08] the 16th chapter, the Bible would say,
[47:10] "And they did worse than all the kings
[47:13] that were before them." Then the next
[47:14] king, and they did worse than all the
[47:16] kings that were before him, all the way
[47:18] down to when you read about Ahab, that
[47:20] that Ahab he done worse. And the Bible
[47:23] said he did more to provoke the Lord
[47:25] than any other other king that had ever
[47:27] uh uh served over Israel. So he was
[47:29] certainly a a wicked king, this King
[47:31] Ahab. But then at the end of all of this
[47:34] writing of the kings and their doings,
[47:36] there's one verse of scripture that
[47:38] speaks of a builder in the days of Ahab.
[47:40] Right in the end of it, it says, "But
[47:42] hyle uh uh the builder, he built the
[47:44] city of Jericho." Now uh you can you can
[47:47] uh uh think of this from uh from what
[47:50] little is written. It's the only verse
[47:51] of scripture in the Bible that talks
[47:53] about this man. But uh from that verse,
[47:55] you can realize that he was certainly a
[47:57] great builder. No builder has the uh
[47:59] ability or the request to build a city
[48:02] if he wasn't a builder. He wasn't uh he
[48:04] wasn't just building a building. He had
[48:05] built a city. And this wasn't just any
[48:07] city. Uh it was a great city. It was
[48:09] something uh uh uh something of a great
[48:12] feed. And when you read about this man
[48:14] Hyle, of course, the Bible would tell us
[48:16] he was a Bethlite. He was born in Bethl.
[48:18] He was the of course Bethl means the
[48:20] house of God. And so here this man had
[48:22] been raised up in this place. and he
[48:24] grew and no doubt uh as he grew he would
[48:27] he would learn the skill and and the
[48:29] training to be able to build and he was
[48:31] he married and he had children and he
[48:33] raised a family. You can get all this
[48:35] out of that one verse and u but there's
[48:37] no record of all the things that he ever
[48:39] built outside that he built the city of
[48:41] Jericho. So he he certainly was a
[48:43] builder. He built the city and uh you
[48:45] know but as I I would uh read about this
[48:48] man hyle uh and you know and some of the
[48:50] uh some of the historians would suggest
[48:52] that maybe that he built it because he
[48:55] found a land that was over the great
[48:56] plains that overlooked the river of
[48:58] Jordan and and uh and maybe he saw that
[49:01] and he wanted to build something for his
[49:02] wife. And you know there's all kinds of
[49:04] uh historical reasons why people would
[49:06] say that Hy would go build this city of
[49:09] Jericho but the Bible doesn't really uh
[49:11] tell us the purpose of why he built it.
[49:12] Uh uh but but when I read about this,
[49:15] you know, brother Mark, I I I kind of
[49:17] read into things and you know that uh
[49:19] you realize that at the time of his
[49:21] building and where it was written about
[49:23] his building, we know this that it was
[49:25] during the reign of Ahab and you know
[49:27] the the life of Ahab, Ahab was the king
[49:30] over the northern kingdom of Israel. How
[49:32] many knows that that that Israel was a
[49:34] divided kingdom? And so uh from the time
[49:37] of King Solomon when Solomon died and
[49:39] the and Rayaboam had became the king
[49:42] over Israel uh all of the the the the
[49:45] people in the north had came against
[49:46] they had rebelled against Rayoboam. And
[49:49] so it it divided the kingdom of Israel.
[49:51] And so we find that that in this kingdom
[49:53] here was the northern kingdom which was
[49:55] called which was Israel and the the
[49:57] southern kingdom which was Judah. Uh
[49:59] that they both had different kings. And
[50:01] so here in this kingdom of Israel, which
[50:04] is where Jericho was, it was a part of
[50:06] the northern kingdom. And uh and right
[50:08] on the border of Judah and upon uh uh uh
[50:12] the northern kingdom, right over to the
[50:14] eastern side, right where the where the
[50:15] Jordan River came down and it met the
[50:18] Dead Sea. This is where the city of
[50:19] Jericho was. Remember, according to the
[50:21] Bible, when Joshua come over the River
[50:23] Jordan, there set the city. And so so it
[50:26] was sitting right on the corner of this
[50:27] region, right by the uh right by the
[50:29] Jordan River. And you know, as I as I
[50:31] read about this, I thought, you know, as
[50:33] a as a strategist, that would be a great
[50:35] place for a military outpost. It would
[50:36] be a great place to a defensive
[50:39] stronghold. And so, as we read about the
[50:42] Bible, about this uh this builder, uh we
[50:44] we see that the Bible is actually
[50:46] listing kings and the things that kings
[50:48] built. It says, "This king built in the
[50:50] city of Tisbah, and this king built in
[50:52] the city of Samaria. He actually built
[50:54] the city of Samaria and made it his his
[50:57] stronghold." But then when it comes down
[50:58] to Ahab, the Bible says, "And Ahab built
[51:00] groves and then Bile built the city of
[51:03] Jericho." And so as I read this, you
[51:05] know, I thought that that maybe that
[51:07] that B didn't just go build this because
[51:09] he thought it was a nice place to build,
[51:10] but maybe it was something that would
[51:12] been ordered by King Ahab, that this
[51:14] would be a place that would prevent
[51:16] Judah from attacking. There was
[51:18] constantly in battle for this whole time
[51:20] of his reign. There was a war that went
[51:21] on between Judah and the northern
[51:23] kingdom. But but you know I thought but
[51:25] here maybe he was hired as a builder to
[51:27] rebuild this city and maybe he was hired
[51:30] to make this stronghold in this place.
[51:32] But nevertheless of the purpose of his
[51:34] building the construction of it came at
[51:36] a great price. For the Bible said in his
[51:38] days did Hy the Bethlite build Jericho
[51:41] and he laid the foundation thereof in
[51:43] Abram his firstborn. See so what we can
[51:46] gather from this is it matters what you
[51:49] build on here. here this this or hy he's
[51:53] going to build this great city brother
[51:54] Maher but but but it came at a great
[51:56] cost and let me tell you what the Bible
[51:58] says Jesus said that a foolish man
[52:00] builds his house upon a sand and a wise
[52:03] man builds his house upon the rock
[52:05] that's a that's a scriptural principle
[52:06] and let me let me tell you what I found
[52:08] out that everything that you do in this
[52:10] life uses that same principle how many
[52:12] knows that it don't matter what you
[52:14] build in this life it it uses that same
[52:16] principle you you know you could take a
[52:18] person that that they're going to get
[52:19] healthy and they go work out and they uh
[52:21] but before you can go bodybuilding, they
[52:24] tell you, "Well, you have to build a
[52:25] core first." Maybe you're going to play
[52:27] sports and before you can play sports,
[52:28] you build up cardio and you run because
[52:30] you had to have a foundation. Otherwise,
[52:32] you would never even be able to play the
[52:34] sport. If you was going to build a
[52:35] business, you would you would have to
[52:36] have a customer base that would be able
[52:38] to support the business before you could
[52:40] expand out. If you're going to build a
[52:42] house, that house has to have a
[52:43] foundation under it. So that as you're
[52:45] building upon it, it doesn't matter all
[52:47] the greatness of everything you build,
[52:48] everything that could be done right. But
[52:50] if the foundation isn't right, the house
[52:52] will never stand. So, uh, it doesn't
[52:54] matter what we build in this life, it
[52:56] has to have a right foundation. You can
[52:58] take a a husband and a wife and a
[53:00] marriage and there and and it has to be
[53:02] able to be built on something, right? It
[53:04] can't be built on on finances. It can't
[53:06] be built on houses. It can't be built on
[53:08] money. It can't be built on material
[53:10] things. But even a marriage, it has to
[53:12] be built on something that'll survive
[53:14] the tests and the trials and the and the
[53:16] financial hardships. It has to be built
[53:19] on on a real love between a man and a
[53:21] woman and God being in their marriage.
[53:23] So, so we realize that every part of our
[53:26] life, it has to be built on something.
[53:28] How many knows that we are we are triune
[53:30] beings? Brother say we are body, soul
[53:32] and spirit. We are we are not just
[53:34] flesh. We are made up we are a spiritual
[53:37] being. We go through many things in this
[53:39] flesh. We battle things. We And the
[53:41] reason there's such a great struggle is
[53:43] we're not just dealing with the things
[53:45] of the flesh. The battles that you go
[53:46] through are not just trials of the
[53:48] flesh. They're not just they're not just
[53:50] battles and mind battles, but we're
[53:52] fighting a battle on a spiritual level.
[53:54] Somebody say, "Amen." Every day when you
[53:56] get out of bed, you're fighting a
[53:57] spiritual battle. When you go to the
[53:59] store, you're fighting a spiritual
[54:00] battle. When you get in your car and
[54:02] drive down the road, we're constantly
[54:04] fighting a spiritual battle. You're
[54:06] battling things that you cannot see. And
[54:08] it just seems like everywhere you go,
[54:10] you're combating spirits. That's why the
[54:11] Bible would say that there has to be
[54:13] something in us that can fight back on a
[54:16] spiritual level. So, you can't fight
[54:17] spiritual things with natural things
[54:19] there. It ain't the natural ability will
[54:21] never give you the ability to overcome
[54:23] spiritual things. That's why when Paul
[54:25] would write in Romans 8, he said, "But
[54:27] the spirit of him that raised Jesus from
[54:29] the dead, if it dwells in you, he that
[54:31] raised up Christ shall also quicken your
[54:33] mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth
[54:36] in you." So in other words, the life
[54:38] that you have came by the spirit of God.
[54:41] The only way you'll ever overcome in
[54:42] this life, it'll come by the spirit of
[54:44] God. How many members we had gone
[54:46] through this word quicken and it meant
[54:48] it meant to come from the Greek word
[54:50] zoapel which meant the life of God being
[54:53] infused in the believer. Remember we
[54:54] went through that the other day how that
[54:56] it meant to be to to fill up and to soak
[54:58] in and and the spirit of God to be able
[55:00] to flow through you. That's what God is
[55:02] looking for is a a a being that's a
[55:05] triune being to take on the spirit of
[55:08] God and the life of God in the in that
[55:10] believer to be able to overcome in this
[55:12] life. That's the spirit that that the
[55:14] life that is in you. That's what'll get
[55:15] you through this life. But listen, but
[55:17] but but it takes the spirit is certainly
[55:20] the life in you, but it takes the word
[55:23] of God to keep that channel clear that
[55:26] God can continue to flow through you.
[55:28] So, I think a lot of times where people
[55:30] get into trouble, I'm just going to
[55:31] pastor a little bit this morning, but a
[55:33] lot of times why people get into trouble
[55:35] is because they neglect that part of
[55:38] fulfilling or taking the word and
[55:40] keeping that channel, being able to
[55:41] clear it out. That's why Jesus would say
[55:43] these words. He said, "He that heareth
[55:45] these words that I speak and doeth them
[55:48] shall be like a wise man that built his
[55:50] house upon a rock." So here Jesus
[55:52] establishes to us that it's important
[55:55] for us to hear the word of the Lord and
[55:57] it's important for us to do the very
[55:58] word that we hear. So I know that today
[56:01] that many times that people they get to
[56:03] a place so spiritually that they say
[56:05] well we don't have no need of the Bible
[56:07] anymore. We don't have no need, you
[56:09] know, but after all look at where I've
[56:10] gone spiritually and I I've been filled
[56:12] with the spirit of God and God has
[56:14] brought me thus far and you know I see
[56:16] it all around the world today. Well, we
[56:18] don't have no need for that. We don't
[56:19] have no need for for for oldfashioned
[56:21] prayer meets and sitting down and
[56:23] opening a Bible up on a coffee table and
[56:25] reading the Bible. Why do we need that
[56:26] more? You matter of fact, I've got in
[56:28] trouble for it at this church. I've had
[56:30] some of our critics that had made some
[56:32] statements kind of like that and and I
[56:33] certainly appreciate our critics, but uh
[56:35] but maybe uh you know, one would say,
[56:37] well, you know, he preaches too much out
[56:39] of the Bible. I thought, my I didn't
[56:40] know you could do that or or you put too
[56:42] much emphasis on the Bible. But let me
[56:44] tell you what a prophet said. He said,
[56:46] "There has been more persecution over
[56:48] this book than any other book in the
[56:50] world." He said, "But yet, it is still
[56:51] the greatest book that was ever written.
[56:54] There ain't nothing that outshines it.
[56:56] There's nothing that outclasses it.
[56:57] There's no book that's any greater.
[56:59] There's nothing you can read. Every
[57:01] question that you ever have in this
[57:03] life, the answer of it is laying between
[57:05] these books and the 66 books of the
[57:07] Bible lays the answers to life's
[57:09] question." Friends, I know what they
[57:11] say. Well, after all, I've received the
[57:13] spirit of God. So why do I need that
[57:14] Bible? After all, I've received the life
[57:17] of God in me. So why do I need that
[57:19] Bible? You know what? That's
[57:20] oldfashioned. And we don't need that
[57:22] kind of stuff anymore because I've been
[57:23] filled with the Holy Ghost. And what we
[57:25] found today is there's too many people
[57:27] that are so-called filled with the
[57:29] spirit of God. But they live a life
[57:31] without the Bible. They preach a gospel
[57:33] without the Bible. That's why they stand
[57:35] in pulpit and their sermons aren't
[57:37] anointed and their messages are
[57:38] uninspired because they don't read their
[57:40] Bible. I say if a man is called of God,
[57:43] he'll take the word of the Lord and
[57:45] present it to a people of God and the
[57:47] inspiration that wrote it will reveal it
[57:49] to the hearts of believers and it'll
[57:51] bring a revival in the household of
[57:53] every man and woman.
[57:55] Oh, I know what Oh, I can hear it right
[57:57] now. I know what the devil says. Well,
[57:58] you know, he can quote the scripture.
[58:00] Well, the letter killth, brother Matt,
[58:02] but it's the spirit that gives life.
[58:03] Well, let me tell you, friends, what is
[58:05] the spirit giving life to? The spirit
[58:07] gives life to the word of God.
[58:10] So you had to have the word for the
[58:11] spirit to give life. It don't mean to do
[58:13] away with our Bible. For the spirit
[58:15] gives life to the word. You say, "Well,
[58:17] why do we need it?" Can I tell you what
[58:18] a prophet said? He said in the message
[58:20] thirst in 1965, he said, "When you
[58:23] neglect thirst, you die." He said, "If
[58:25] you neglect thirst, if you neglect to
[58:27] take a drink of water, then you ain't
[58:28] going to drink no more. Then you die. If
[58:30] you neglect to eat food, then you're
[58:32] going to die." He said, "So if you
[58:34] neglect to give the Holy Spirit, the
[58:36] word of God, then you will die. It don't
[58:39] matter where you came from. If you was a
[58:41] Christian or you was a Baptist or you
[58:42] was a Methodist or a Pentecostal or a
[58:44] Presbyterian, it don't matter where you
[58:46] come from. He said, "I don't care. It
[58:48] don't matter nothing to me and I don't
[58:49] think it matters to God." He said, "But
[58:51] you are an individual and you'll never
[58:53] go to heaven as a church or
[58:55] denomination. You'll only go to heaven
[58:57] as one single person between you and
[58:59] God. It don't care what church you
[59:02] belong to. And if you neglect to read
[59:05] the Bible and to believe the Bible, then
[59:07] the hol and the Holy Spirit to feed upon
[59:10] that, you will die. That's why Jesus
[59:13] said that man should not live by bread
[59:15] alone, but by every word that proceedth
[59:17] out of the mouth of God. Well, friends,
[59:19] did you ever think about that this
[59:20] morning? That in every believer, there
[59:23] is a hungry and a thirsty Holy Ghost.
[59:26] You say, "I've been filled with the
[59:27] spirit of God." But that spirit of God
[59:29] that is in you is hungering for the word
[59:31] of God. It's thirsty for the word of
[59:33] God. Oh, hallelujah. The how the Holy
[59:36] Ghost, it desires to be fed. The Holy
[59:38] Ghost, it feeds. Let me tell you, say
[59:40] what's it feed on? It feeds upon the
[59:42] word of God. It's looking to be fed. I
[59:44] tell you what they've done today. They
[59:46] took the Bible out of schools and they
[59:48] took the Bible out of governments and
[59:49] they took the Bible out of churches and
[59:51] replaced it with creeds that a man could
[59:53] follow. But friends, I say this this
[59:55] morning. As long as there's a breath in
[59:57] my body and this church stand that this
[59:59] Bible will always be at the forefront of
[1:00:02] this church. It's the word that God has
[1:00:04] given unto the believer. It'll be in
[1:00:06] this church. It'll be on this pullpit.
[1:00:09] It'll be preached to these people. It'll
[1:00:11] be in the heart of every believer. It'll
[1:00:13] be in the home of every son and daughter
[1:00:15] of God.
[1:00:17] If you neglect to feed the Holy Ghost,
[1:00:19] the word, it will die. You will die. I
[1:00:22] don't matter how much of the spirit of
[1:00:23] God you got. If you neglect to feed at
[1:00:25] the word of God, you will die. Paul
[1:00:29] said, "All scriptures." Somebody say,
[1:00:30] "All scriptures." Man, I feel like
[1:00:32] preaching. Y'all do, too. All scriptures
[1:00:34] was inspired by God and is good for
[1:00:37] doctrine. You see why we need the word
[1:00:38] of God. It's what brings inspiration to
[1:00:40] our life. Say, "Why don't why don't the
[1:00:42] devil like it?" Let me tell you why.
[1:00:44] Because it exposes the devil.
[1:00:47] You know why he don't like this Bible
[1:00:48] preaching? It exposes him. He don't like
[1:00:51] to be exposed. But friends, I got news
[1:00:52] for you. It's got to be preached. That's
[1:00:55] why God sent the message in this
[1:00:57] generation. People get it so mixed up.
[1:00:59] He sent it to bring this Bible back to
[1:01:02] life. That's what the spirit of God
[1:01:05] does. It gives life to the word of God.
[1:01:08] Oh, he brought it that that's what the
[1:01:10] message done in this hour, brother Mark.
[1:01:12] It brought the promises of God and made
[1:01:14] them a reality right before the people
[1:01:16] again. It took Hebrews 13:8. Jesus
[1:01:19] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:01:21] forever. And it took it and lifted it
[1:01:23] out of the pages of this book and put it
[1:01:25] on display before a world. It took John
[1:01:27] 3:16, for God so loved the world that he
[1:01:30] gave his only begotten son. And it
[1:01:32] lifted it out of the pages of the Bible
[1:01:34] that it would follow Psalms 23 around
[1:01:36] and follow goodness and mercy into every
[1:01:38] life and call a people back to God
[1:01:41] again. It's lifted it. It's a call for
[1:01:43] sinners. It's a call of God and listed
[1:01:45] it out of the pages of the Bible to be
[1:01:47] able to do God's work in this hour. It
[1:01:49] took John the 10th chapter when Jesus
[1:01:51] said, "My sheep hear my voice and a
[1:01:53] stranger they they will not follow." It
[1:01:55] took it and caused the call of God, the
[1:01:58] shepherd of God to be able to call the
[1:02:00] sheep of God into his pasture. No longer
[1:02:03] is it just a bleeding of sheep in the
[1:02:05] middle of the night, but there's a voice
[1:02:06] of God called shepherds that's crying
[1:02:08] out in the night, "Come into the fold."
[1:02:11] That Christ has the answer. that there's
[1:02:13] danger that's lurking in the darkness
[1:02:15] the enemy that wants to destroy you. But
[1:02:17] I thank God that we've came far enough
[1:02:19] along to have enough vision to see in
[1:02:21] the middle of the night and know that
[1:02:23] God is calling us out of this world into
[1:02:26] his marvelous light.
[1:02:28] We need the word of God. Abraham said,
[1:02:30] "How can we stress this so much? The way
[1:02:32] the church is going, they let down the
[1:02:34] morals of the people. They let them
[1:02:35] live, go to dancers, rock and roll,
[1:02:37] dress any way they want to, everything,
[1:02:39] and still go on the same. It's
[1:02:40] compromising preachers. See, but what we
[1:02:43] need is Oh, somebody say amen. But what
[1:02:45] we need is old-fashioned God- sentin,
[1:02:47] heavenborn preachers who will tell the
[1:02:49] truth regardless of who it hurts. Like
[1:02:52] John when he walked out of the
[1:02:53] wilderness, he said the axe was laid to
[1:02:55] the root of the tree. That's why the
[1:02:56] Bible would say any tree that wouldn't
[1:02:58] bring forth good fruit is heuned down
[1:03:00] and it's cast into the fire. That's
[1:03:03] right. He said, "We need preachers,
[1:03:04] prophets like that, who will bombard and
[1:03:06] use the judgments of God for ammunition
[1:03:09] and tear up in this wicked condition
[1:03:10] that we're living in, to have ammunition
[1:03:13] to destroy the devil." Oh, friends, I
[1:03:16] got news for you this morning. God's
[1:03:17] armory is filled with ammo, to destroy
[1:03:20] every devil. It don't matter what spirit
[1:03:22] that you're fighting. We may as well not
[1:03:23] hold nothing back this morning. It don't
[1:03:25] matter what spirit you fight. It don't
[1:03:27] matter what you face. The reality is we
[1:03:29] can come to church and make everybody
[1:03:30] feel good. But whenever you go home,
[1:03:32] you're battling spirits. When you leave
[1:03:34] the building there, it's war with your
[1:03:36] mind. You can't pick up your phone. That
[1:03:38] there ain't a spirit that's trying to
[1:03:39] torment you. But God's armory is filled
[1:03:43] with weapons to destroy that very enemy.
[1:03:45] You say, "What's it do?" Let me tell you
[1:03:47] what the word does. It don't matter what
[1:03:48] spirit that you're battling. The word of
[1:03:50] God exposes it and it destroys it. No
[1:03:54] wonder the devil hates you. It exposes
[1:03:56] it and destroys it. You say any spirit,
[1:03:59] any spirit. It doesn't matter what it is
[1:04:01] that you face. If you was battling a
[1:04:02] spirit of lust, you say, "What'll I do?"
[1:04:04] Well, read Matthew 5:28 and expose it.
[1:04:06] Jesus said, "I say unto you, whosoever
[1:04:08] lookketh upon a woman to lust after her
[1:04:10] has committed adultery already in his
[1:04:12] heart. It exposes it and then it
[1:04:15] destroys it." Maybe it's jealousy. Maybe
[1:04:17] it's envy. Maybe it's alcoholism. It
[1:04:19] don't matter what it is. You can read
[1:04:21] Galatians 5:19. Paul said, "These are
[1:04:23] the works of the flesh." That's adultery
[1:04:26] and fornication, uncleanness, idolatry,
[1:04:29] witchcraft, hatred, emulations, trap,
[1:04:31] heresies, envyings, murders,
[1:04:33] drunkenness, revelings, and such alike.
[1:04:35] Of these, I tell you, I have told you in
[1:04:37] times past that they that do these
[1:04:39] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[1:04:41] God. It exposes it. Oh, then it destroys
[1:04:45] it. It don't matter what the spirit is.
[1:04:47] Maybe it's a critical spirit that gets
[1:04:49] on people. They they can't help but
[1:04:51] criticize everything around them and
[1:04:53] everybody around them and God help
[1:04:54] somebody try to do something for the
[1:04:56] Lord, but an old critical spirit will
[1:04:58] rise up and try to squash it back down.
[1:05:00] But let me tell you what you do. You
[1:05:01] read Ephesians 4:29. Paul said, "Let no
[1:05:04] corrupt communication proceed out of
[1:05:06] your mouth, but that which is good and
[1:05:08] use of edifying that it may minister
[1:05:10] grace unto the hearers." You say, "Why
[1:05:13] did he say that?" Because Paul said that
[1:05:15] critical spirit grieves the Holy Spirit
[1:05:17] of God. Right? They're afraid to say it,
[1:05:20] afraid to read it, afraid to preach it,
[1:05:23] afraid to offend somebody. Can I go
[1:05:25] ahead and read it? Paul said, "But now
[1:05:27] put off these things, anger, wrath, and
[1:05:30] malice, and blasphemy, filthy
[1:05:32] communication out of your mouth. Don't
[1:05:34] lie one to another, seeing that you have
[1:05:36] put off the old man with his deeds, and
[1:05:40] you put on a new man and been renewed in
[1:05:42] the knowledge of the image of the one
[1:05:44] that created him." He didn't just say,
[1:05:46] "Put off the old man. put off. A lot of
[1:05:48] people will put off the old man and
[1:05:50] carry on like the old man. But Paul
[1:05:52] said, "Put off the old man with his
[1:05:54] deeds. The deeds of the flesh, the works
[1:05:56] of the flesh. Put off the old man with
[1:05:58] his deeds." But said, "You can't ever
[1:06:00] get rid of sin by patting it on the
[1:06:02] back. You can't read it by educating
[1:06:04] people. Programs have become demolished.
[1:06:05] They fail." There's only one remedy for
[1:06:07] sin, and that is Christ. That is Christ.
[1:06:11] He is the remedy. and Christ and not
[1:06:13] Christ through an intellectual
[1:06:14] confession but through the baptism of
[1:06:16] the Holy Ghost to a new life and a
[1:06:19] regeneration. He said that's the only
[1:06:21] remedy for sin. That's the only remedy
[1:06:23] for a nation. That's the only remedy for
[1:06:25] a church and it's the only remedy for
[1:06:27] people. It's Christ by the power of the
[1:06:30] Holy Ghost that would come in and make
[1:06:31] you a new man that would take the old
[1:06:33] man and the deeds of the flesh and cast
[1:06:35] them aside and stomp him underfoot and
[1:06:38] allow the life of God to live through
[1:06:39] every believer. Christ through the
[1:06:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost, the spirit of
[1:06:44] God alive in his people again. Friends,
[1:06:46] let me tell you what we need. We need
[1:06:47] the word of the Lord. People are looking
[1:06:50] for everybody to shape their life. And
[1:06:51] let me tell you, the only thing that'll
[1:06:52] ever get it right is the word of the
[1:06:54] Lord. The only thing that'll ever shape
[1:06:55] it up is the word. We need the word.
[1:06:57] That's what shaped us. And Paul tells
[1:06:59] us, he says, "Don't refuse the voice
[1:07:02] that God sends to you." What a powerful
[1:07:05] word. See, Paul came after Jesus was
[1:07:08] upon the earth. And so here here Paul's
[1:07:11] ministry came after this. And so Paul
[1:07:13] would talk about how the ministry of
[1:07:15] Jesus while he was on the earth and now
[1:07:17] what God was doing under the under this
[1:07:20] office of the Holy Ghost. He said refuse
[1:07:22] not him that speaketh. He said for they
[1:07:24] that refused him when he spoke on the
[1:07:26] earth they did not escape. He said how
[1:07:28] much more shall we not escape when he
[1:07:30] speaks from heaven. He said see when he
[1:07:32] the voice it shook the earth. He said
[1:07:34] but then he said but once more I will
[1:07:36] shake not the earth only but also the
[1:07:37] heaven. And Paul, what was it that was
[1:07:39] shaken the earth? Paul says, "And this
[1:07:41] word yet once more signifies removing
[1:07:45] things that are shaken as of things that
[1:07:47] are made. And those things which cannot
[1:07:48] be shaken may remain. Wherefore we
[1:07:51] receive in a kingdom which cannot be
[1:07:53] moved. Let us have grace whereby we may
[1:07:56] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[1:07:58] with godly fear." So in other words, we
[1:08:01] have a voice that is speaking from
[1:08:03] heaven. Paul says, "Hear it. It's the
[1:08:07] voice." Think of it. It's a voice of the
[1:08:09] father. It's a voice of correction. It's
[1:08:12] a voice of instruction. It's a voice of
[1:08:15] love and a voice of the promise of God.
[1:08:18] And Paul said, "And this voice is doing
[1:08:20] two things." One, the word comes to
[1:08:23] shake things from you. Hello, somebody.
[1:08:27] It comes to shake. How many can testify
[1:08:29] of that? The word comes to shake things
[1:08:31] from you. So, you get a little hard
[1:08:33] preaching sometimes. What's it doing?
[1:08:34] It's shaking things from you. It ruffles
[1:08:36] your feathers a little bit. And
[1:08:37] sometimes you got to get your feathers
[1:08:38] ruffled. You can get rid of all the dust
[1:08:40] and all the things that's built up in
[1:08:41] them. It's okay to ruffle your feathers.
[1:08:43] Hello. God bless you for ruffling my
[1:08:46] feathers a little bit. It don't hurt
[1:08:47] nobody have their feathers ruffled. It
[1:08:49] does two things. It shakes things from
[1:08:51] you. And then the second thing is it
[1:08:54] establishes the things which cannot be
[1:08:56] moved. It shakes the things that don't
[1:08:59] belong. And then it establishes those
[1:09:01] things that can't be moved. This is what
[1:09:04] Paul's saying. of God. Don't don't fear
[1:09:07] the voice of God that come under the
[1:09:10] anointing of the Holy Ghost that wrote
[1:09:12] the very pages that even Paul would
[1:09:14] write. He said, "It's coming to shake
[1:09:15] things up. It's coming to to shake you
[1:09:18] and to establish you." Listen what David
[1:09:20] said. He has he said, "I have set the
[1:09:22] Lord always before me because he is my
[1:09:25] at my right hand and I shall not be
[1:09:28] moved." See, David had something that
[1:09:30] kept him. He was a man that went through
[1:09:32] many great trials. You know the life of
[1:09:34] David? He was a Remember when he was
[1:09:36] just a young boy, David fought a lion.
[1:09:38] He had to have something that would get
[1:09:40] him through that battle. David when he
[1:09:42] when he went out and the bear came
[1:09:43] against the sheep, he had to have
[1:09:44] something that would get him through
[1:09:46] that battle. He when he then whenever he
[1:09:48] fought Goliath, he had to have something
[1:09:49] that would get him through that battle.
[1:09:51] Let me let me tell you what it was. He
[1:09:52] said, "I always kept the Lord before me,
[1:09:56] and because I kept the Lord before me, I
[1:09:59] shall not be moved." Now, what a what a
[1:10:01] what a an answer that David gives us.
[1:10:03] So, you know what that tells me is that
[1:10:05] when he went out into the field and the
[1:10:07] and the bear came that David wasn't
[1:10:09] we're blind on his own flesh. Well, what
[1:10:11] can I find that can that can defeat a
[1:10:13] bear? Is there something in my arsenal
[1:10:15] that I can beat a bear with? But it had
[1:10:17] nothing to do with that. But David's
[1:10:18] mind was I keep the Lord before me.
[1:10:20] Lord, you brought me into this place.
[1:10:22] You called me to be a shepherd. You
[1:10:23] placed me into this field. And Lord,
[1:10:25] you've called me over this sheep.
[1:10:27] They're the other household of my
[1:10:28] father. And Lord, I'm down here. I'm
[1:10:30] doing my job to the best of my ability.
[1:10:32] And now this crazy bear is coming out
[1:10:34] against your sheep. But Lord, I put you
[1:10:36] before me. I don't have the ability to
[1:10:38] take him. I don't have the ability to
[1:10:40] fight him. I don't have the ability to
[1:10:41] destroy. But Lord, I put you before me
[1:10:43] that my enemy may fall at my feet. David
[1:10:46] said, "I've always kept the Lord before
[1:10:48] my face. Therefore, I shall not be
[1:10:50] moved." That's how he was able to stand
[1:10:52] whenever he went into battle, Brother
[1:10:54] Bobby. Because he put the Lord before
[1:10:56] him. When he had a trial, he put the
[1:10:58] Lord before him. when he had a problem,
[1:10:59] he put the Lord before him. Let me tell
[1:11:01] you, even in the midst of David's
[1:11:03] failures, he would put the Lord before
[1:11:05] him. That's what always brought him out.
[1:11:08] David wasn't a perfect man. He was a man
[1:11:10] that had great faults just like you and
[1:11:12] I. He was a man that made mistakes. He
[1:11:14] He made failures just like you and I. He
[1:11:17] was not a perfect man. But I can say
[1:11:18] this just like David this morning that I
[1:11:21] may fight. I may struggle. I may battle.
[1:11:24] said, "I put the Lord before me and I
[1:11:27] shall not be moved." I wonder how many
[1:11:29] can say that this morning. I put the
[1:11:31] Lord before me. Somebody say it with me.
[1:11:34] I put the Lord before me and I shall not
[1:11:36] be moved.
[1:11:38] This was the heart of David. To be able
[1:11:41] to understand what he would face, I put
[1:11:43] the Lord before me. But said, "We know
[1:11:45] that in the day that we're living, the
[1:11:48] very foundation of every natural thing
[1:11:51] is failing."
[1:11:53] The foundation is failing. He said, "But
[1:11:55] we have a sure rock of salvation." The
[1:11:59] very foundation that's failing, but we
[1:12:01] have a sure. Thank you, brother. But we
[1:12:03] have a sure rock of salvation. You say,
[1:12:05] "Well, what is that rock of salvation?"
[1:12:07] He said, "That we've been redeemed by
[1:12:09] the precious blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:12] Christ." Thank you. That we've been
[1:12:14] redeemed by the precious blood of the
[1:12:17] Lord Jesus Christ. So you see, our
[1:12:18] redemption has become our sure rock of
[1:12:21] salvation. You say, "Well, why? Why is
[1:12:23] it a sure rock?" Let me tell you this.
[1:12:25] Because salvation would never do it on
[1:12:27] its own. Can I just break this down a
[1:12:29] little bit? But Mark says, "Bring it on
[1:12:31] down." But salvation would never do it
[1:12:34] on its own. See, you can take a man.
[1:12:36] Let's say a man is out in the river and
[1:12:37] he's drowning in the river. And you went
[1:12:39] out in a boat and you saved the man that
[1:12:40] was drowning. You took him out of the
[1:12:42] water. You put him in a boat. You took
[1:12:44] him back to shore. You done the very
[1:12:45] thing that was necessary to save him.
[1:12:48] But whenever he got out of the water, he
[1:12:50] still had the same problems he had. He
[1:12:52] still had the same past. The debts that
[1:12:54] he owed when he went into the water, he
[1:12:55] still owed the debts when he got out of
[1:12:57] the water. See, so everything that he
[1:12:59] had before is still there. So salvation
[1:13:01] wasn't enough just to say that you're
[1:13:03] saved or or there comes salvation. But
[1:13:05] the reason the salvation of Jesus Christ
[1:13:07] has become a sure rock is the way that
[1:13:10] God saves. He saves us by redemption.
[1:13:13] It's a very particular way to save. Let
[1:13:16] me tell you what this means. In other
[1:13:17] words, it means the price has been paid.
[1:13:20] It means that all your past sins and the
[1:13:22] debts that you owe because of this flesh
[1:13:24] was paid for on the cross of Calvary.
[1:13:27] So, not only was I just saved, but my
[1:13:29] debts was paid. Not only did he save me,
[1:13:32] but my past has been erased. Not only
[1:13:35] did he save me, but he took all the sins
[1:13:37] and the problems and the things of my
[1:13:39] flesh and he put them under the blood of
[1:13:41] Jesus Christ that they can never be
[1:13:42] brought up again.
[1:13:44] And because of that kind of a salvation
[1:13:47] by redemption, a sure rock of salvation,
[1:13:50] brother Mark, now you can have something
[1:13:54] that you can build a life on.
[1:13:57] See all the the failures and the flaws
[1:13:59] and the the miss the mess ups. It was
[1:14:03] all
[1:14:04] erased. Now you can build on it. You see
[1:14:08] why? Because our flaws, our mistakes,
[1:14:11] all of our unbelief, our our old birth,
[1:14:14] all these things in our past, it's all
[1:14:16] been erased.
[1:14:18] And now because it's been erased, here
[1:14:20] comes this new foundation for you to
[1:14:23] start as a believer and build a brand
[1:14:25] new life. You see why it's so important
[1:14:28] to to find this place of redemption and
[1:14:30] and be filled with the Holy Ghost and to
[1:14:32] feed upon the word of God. What is it
[1:14:34] doing? It's establishing a foundation
[1:14:37] that you can build a life on that when
[1:14:39] you get down through life 40, 50 years
[1:14:41] later and you go through great trials
[1:14:43] and people wander this way and fall this
[1:14:45] way and that way. But there's something
[1:14:46] about you, there's a stability about
[1:14:48] your life because it was built upon a
[1:14:50] right foundation. And many people fail
[1:14:53] to find that foundation. And they build
[1:14:55] they boy help me. But they they build uh
[1:14:58] because they're married to somebody or
[1:14:59] they build because they because they're
[1:15:01] kin to the preacher. They they build
[1:15:03] they build because they like going to
[1:15:04] church. And so they try to build a life
[1:15:06] on those things or just fellowship and
[1:15:08] all that. And all those things are
[1:15:09] wonderful things, but that can't be what
[1:15:11] you build your life on.
[1:15:13] You have to ruffle your feathers. Get
[1:15:16] down to the bel the the very building
[1:15:19] and rebuilding of this this foundation.
[1:15:22] See, and as you're building on this
[1:15:23] foundation, you notice what happens. Can
[1:15:25] I just Can I just preach? You know what
[1:15:27] happens is that people come along and
[1:15:29] it's just the devil. But people come
[1:15:31] along and say, "Well, I know what's
[1:15:32] underneath all of that. I can tell you
[1:15:34] what's under that building there. I know
[1:15:36] what he he used to do, and I know how
[1:15:38] she used to act, and I know I know what
[1:15:39] she she was, and underneath all that
[1:15:42] long hair, and underneath all that all
[1:15:44] that holiness apparel, it ain't nothing
[1:15:46] but a sinner. They ain't nothing but a
[1:15:48] con man. That ain't nothing but a
[1:15:49] failure. They they they they write all
[1:15:51] kinds of things about you, but let me
[1:15:52] tell you a secret about a foundation.
[1:15:54] You can't see what's under that
[1:15:56] building.
[1:15:57] You don't know what's under there. They
[1:15:59] can look at this building and say,
[1:16:01] "Well, I know what all that was. I know
[1:16:02] what her life's been built on. I know
[1:16:04] about all that. I know about all that. I
[1:16:06] know what her life's been built on." But
[1:16:08] you can't see what her life's built on.
[1:16:10] You can't see the foundation of that
[1:16:11] building. You may go back and say,
[1:16:13] "Well, I think it was this and I think
[1:16:14] it was that and I saw her do this and I
[1:16:16] I saw him do that." But friends, but hid
[1:16:18] beneath all of that is a foundation that
[1:16:21] is established upon a solid rock. It's
[1:16:24] established upon the redemption of Jesus
[1:16:26] Christ. Where where the problem, don't
[1:16:28] you see? It's hid beneath the building.
[1:16:30] But by redemption, it shows us that you
[1:16:33] belong to God before the foundation of
[1:16:35] the world. And now you've been redeemed
[1:16:37] back to God. That means if he paid the
[1:16:40] price, he accepted you as you are.
[1:16:43] Hello, somebody. That means God knew
[1:16:45] your faults. He knew your flaws whenever
[1:16:47] he made the purchase. You were damaged
[1:16:49] goods. Whenever he paid the price and
[1:16:52] said it is finished on the cross of
[1:16:53] Calvary,
[1:16:55] but the Bible said it pleased the father
[1:16:58] to sacrifice his own son for what? That
[1:17:00] the pleasure of the Lord might prosper
[1:17:02] in his hand. You know what that tells
[1:17:04] me? That God, he knew our value when he
[1:17:07] bought us. Hello, somebody. Let that
[1:17:09] sink in. He knew our value when he paid
[1:17:12] the price. He knew all about us. And the
[1:17:15] Bible said it pleased him to do so. In
[1:17:18] other words, he was happy to pay the
[1:17:20] price. Ain't that wonderful? God don't
[1:17:23] purchase like we purchased. Sometimes
[1:17:25] when we buy things, we get buyer
[1:17:26] remorse. You ever go buy something big?
[1:17:28] Well, man, I wish I wouldn't have done
[1:17:29] that. Put it on a put it on a payment
[1:17:32] plan, whatever. But but boy, I wish I
[1:17:33] wouldn't have done that. My that was
[1:17:35] just too much money, man. I didn't need
[1:17:37] that anyway. You know, I don't like that
[1:17:38] dress anyway. I don't know why. I don't
[1:17:40] know why. How many Come on. Hello,
[1:17:41] somebody. I don't know why I bought that
[1:17:42] dress. I shouldn't have bought that.
[1:17:44] Y'all y'all know y'all tell your husband
[1:17:46] that I shouldn't have bought that. Do
[1:17:47] you think? And then the husband, if he's
[1:17:48] got any sins, he says, "Be that's a
[1:17:50] beautiful dress. Oh, oh, that's just I'm
[1:17:53] glad you bought it. That's just
[1:17:54] beautiful." Are you sure? Absolutely. It
[1:17:56] is wonderful. You be honest and tell her
[1:17:58] it's wonderful. Be truthful and tell her
[1:18:00] how great it looks. But but I we always
[1:18:03] get buyers remorse. I wish I wouldn't
[1:18:05] have done that. I wish I wouldn't have
[1:18:06] bought it. I wish I wouldn't have made
[1:18:08] this purchase. That's not what I thought
[1:18:10] it was going to be. You know, after I
[1:18:11] bought it, the reviews look good on
[1:18:12] Amazon, but when it when it came in, you
[1:18:14] know, that's the problem with buying
[1:18:16] things on Teeu is, you know, it looked
[1:18:18] good on there, but when I got it in, you
[1:18:20] know, it said solid gold, but really it
[1:18:22] was made out of brass.
[1:18:24] It was it was it was painted with gold
[1:18:26] spray
[1:18:27] paint. My I
[1:18:30] heard I heard there was a great I heard
[1:18:32] there was a great earthquake that that
[1:18:34] hit over there in China and it destroyed
[1:18:37] a like I think it was a 50,000 square
[1:18:39] foot new warehouse the other day. It
[1:18:42] destroyed it. It's done $88 in
[1:18:46] damage, but it's not what we thought it
[1:18:49] was.
[1:18:50] Sorry. Sometimes you buy things and it's
[1:18:54] you didn't you didn't get what you think
[1:18:55] thought you were buying. So, you remorse
[1:18:58] over the purchase that you made. But
[1:19:00] see, God don't ever have that feeling.
[1:19:02] Isn't that wonderful, brother David? He
[1:19:04] don't ever have that thought. says,
[1:19:05] "See, because God is an eternal God, and
[1:19:09] God sees the end from the beginning. He
[1:19:11] knows your life and where it would turn
[1:19:13] out. He knew every mistake you'd make.
[1:19:15] He knew every road you'd ever go down,
[1:19:17] every path, every gutter, every alleyway
[1:19:19] that you would ever be found in. God
[1:19:21] knew it whenever he paid the price." And
[1:19:23] when he paid it for you, he has no
[1:19:25] regrets.
[1:19:27] He said, "It is finished." He don't
[1:19:29] regret the purchase that he made. Isn't
[1:19:32] that just like our nature?
[1:19:36] our nature. Do I got a minute? Am I
[1:19:40] running out of time? It's just like our
[1:19:41] nature is to try to make ourselves worth
[1:19:44] something. That's what we do when we buy
[1:19:46] stuff. We try to justify why we bought
[1:19:48] it. Well, this is why this we try to
[1:19:50] make ourselves feel better about the
[1:19:52] purchase by justifying it. But that's
[1:19:54] our nature is that we would try to
[1:19:56] justify the purchase that God has made
[1:20:00] by things that we've done in our life.
[1:20:03] Isn't that something? But we're going to
[1:20:04] justify God. How how can you justify
[1:20:06] God? It is his purchased possession. How
[1:20:08] can you justify God's purchase? So,
[1:20:10] we're always trying to make it better.
[1:20:12] If I could do this better and do this,
[1:20:13] right? Can I read you what Brother Man
[1:20:15] said? He said they would come to say,
[1:20:16] "Brother Madam, if I could just quit
[1:20:18] smoking, if I could just lay down
[1:20:19] drinking, if I could just quit stealing,
[1:20:21] if I could just quit doing this, then he
[1:20:23] said, "Don't worry. Just walk on. God
[1:20:25] will take care of the rest of it."
[1:20:27] Trying to justify the purchase that God
[1:20:29] made. But if I could quit, if I could
[1:20:31] quit lying, then I could be a son of
[1:20:32] God. If I could quit cheating, I I could
[1:20:34] be a daughter of God. If I could quit
[1:20:36] these things, he said, "If I know I
[1:20:37] could do it, I'd accept Christ right
[1:20:39] now." He said, "Don't you worry. Just
[1:20:41] move on. Go on, and you'll see the
[1:20:43] salvation of the Lord. It ain't you that
[1:20:46] made the price or paid the price. It was
[1:20:49] God that made the purchase. It ain't you
[1:20:51] that made it worthy. It was God that
[1:20:53] made it worthy. It It was he that bought
[1:20:55] it. He bought you as you are. Let me
[1:20:57] friend, let me tell you this, friends.
[1:20:59] If God bought you as you are, it's up to
[1:21:01] him to change you. It was he that bought
[1:21:03] you. It's up to him to change you. It's
[1:21:05] up to him to shape you. It ain't nothing
[1:21:07] you can shape yourself. It takes God to
[1:21:09] shape you. Take things off your life.
[1:21:11] Shake those things that don't belong and
[1:21:13] establish you in the word of God. He
[1:21:16] said, "What do you do? You just keep
[1:21:17] accepting Christ and let him do the
[1:21:19] work." Hello, somebody.
[1:21:25] You just keep accepting Christ. That
[1:21:27] make not I just had to clap clap myself.
[1:21:29] You just keep accepting Christ and let
[1:21:32] God take care of the rest of it. You
[1:21:35] keep accepting him. Let him do the work.
[1:21:38] Let me tell you why. Because our God has
[1:21:41] a
[1:21:42] reputation. But David, he'll go anywhere
[1:21:45] he has to go.
[1:21:47] Isn't that wonderful? There ain't
[1:21:49] nothing can stop him from getting to
[1:21:51] those that belong to him.
[1:21:53] All through the Bible, we read about
[1:21:55] these great places, these places that
[1:21:57] Jesus had gone, that God had gone.
[1:22:00] Brother Mark, he crossed over many seas.
[1:22:03] He's gone to the lowest parts of the
[1:22:05] earth. He even went all the way to hell
[1:22:08] to find souls that were locked up in a
[1:22:11] prison. It was it is God's purpose that
[1:22:13] no matter where you are, he's willing to
[1:22:15] go that far to get you. Isn't that
[1:22:18] powerful? See, we can put limitations on
[1:22:21] God by looking at somebody's life and
[1:22:23] saying, "Well, God ain't never going to
[1:22:24] get that one." But God will go wherever
[1:22:25] he has to go to get those that belong to
[1:22:28] him. Can I just say it? Can I can I just
[1:22:31] say he ain't afraid of the bar. He ain't
[1:22:33] afraid he ain't afraid of the drug
[1:22:35] house. He He ain't afraid of the valley.
[1:22:38] He ain't afraid of the alleyway. God
[1:22:40] ain't afraid to go where God has to go
[1:22:42] to get those that belong to him. Said
[1:22:44] he'll cross whatever he has to cross.
[1:22:46] See this because he's calling unto
[1:22:48] himself a bride. You realize that's what
[1:22:50] we are this morning. This bride church,
[1:22:52] she's been called called by God. He's
[1:22:54] calling a bride unto himself. And let me
[1:22:57] tell you what I love about the call of
[1:22:58] God in the bride of Jesus Christ. If the
[1:23:01] Bible never puts a stipulation anywhere
[1:23:04] on the condition of that call, in other
[1:23:06] words, or the condition of the person
[1:23:08] when the call was made. It don't matter
[1:23:10] who they were or where they were. The
[1:23:12] same call is for all of them. It don't
[1:23:14] matter if they're man, woman, or child.
[1:23:15] It don't matter what country they're in,
[1:23:17] what color their skin is, what
[1:23:18] nationality, who they were born to, what
[1:23:20] their flaws or mistakes were, the call
[1:23:22] of God, it goes to everyone, every time.
[1:23:25] And it always gets who God.
[1:23:28] It didn't matter where they were, what
[1:23:31] sin that she was in, what past she was
[1:23:33] in, how much she come out of, but when
[1:23:36] you're called out, you come to God.
[1:23:40] Isn't that powerful? He went to a
[1:23:42] different place to get every one of us.
[1:23:44] It's so easy. look at each other's lives
[1:23:46] say, "Well, I'm not so sure about that
[1:23:48] one." But God had to go there to get
[1:23:49] them. Well, I'm not so sure about Well,
[1:23:51] you know what? That person, but but God
[1:23:54] had to go to a different place to get
[1:23:55] them than he did to get you. But he's
[1:23:58] the same God. And it's the same call.
[1:24:00] May a different condition you was in
[1:24:02] than they were. But they ain't one no
[1:24:04] worse than the other. But it took the
[1:24:06] same God to go in, make the same call to
[1:24:08] call us out to God. Didn't matter what
[1:24:11] we were in, she's been called out to
[1:24:13] God. Think about it. All the past
[1:24:16] mistakes, failures, their said that's
[1:24:18] the way it is in this gentile church. He
[1:24:20] said there is a bride. She is elected
[1:24:23] and she will be called according to
[1:24:25] election. We belong to God. There is a
[1:24:27] bride. Can I confirm this? What a
[1:24:29] confirmation. There is a bride. She is
[1:24:31] elected and she will be called according
[1:24:33] to the election of God. That means you
[1:24:35] can go through this life and run as long
[1:24:37] as you want to. But there comes a time
[1:24:38] in your life when you belong to God that
[1:24:40] the calling of God will come upon your
[1:24:42] life. Oh, hallelujah. It'll put a It'll
[1:24:45] put a pull on you that you can't fight.
[1:24:47] It'll draw you into a position you never
[1:24:50] dreamed you'd be in. It'll make you
[1:24:51] somebody that you never thought you
[1:24:53] would be. It's the pull of God on your
[1:24:55] life. Let me tell you, it's trauma. It
[1:24:57] ain't you holding on to God, saying,
[1:24:58] "God, would you pull me out?" It's the
[1:25:00] great big hand of Jehovah God taking a
[1:25:03] hold of his beloved and bringing them
[1:25:05] out of the condition that they were in
[1:25:06] and establishing them upon a firm
[1:25:10] foundation.
[1:25:11] [Applause]
[1:25:13] You know, one
[1:25:14] day the Bible would tell us in the city
[1:25:17] of
[1:25:18] Jericho that they heard that Joshua was
[1:25:22] on his way. Now Joshua being a great man
[1:25:26] of God here, this city of Jericho, as
[1:25:28] the history would tell us, was a great
[1:25:30] walled city. And in that city, there
[1:25:32] lived a lady by the name of
[1:25:35] Rahab that was, can I just can I just
[1:25:37] say this like I see it? that was
[1:25:40] predestinated of God, but she was living
[1:25:42] as a harlot.
[1:25:44] She was a daughter of God, but she was
[1:25:46] living as a harlot. She was a gentile
[1:25:49] that was to be the wife of a Hebrew
[1:25:52] prince, but she was living as a harlot.
[1:25:55] She was the mother of Boaz that would be
[1:25:58] the husband of Ruth, but she was living
[1:26:00] as a harlot. From her lineage would come
[1:26:03] the man Joseph who would marry who would
[1:26:05] be be espoused to Mary that would raise
[1:26:08] Jesus all the days of his life until he
[1:26:10] became an old man. But she was living as
[1:26:12] a harlot.
[1:26:15] She was trapped in this city. What a
[1:26:18] condition that she was in. Brother Mar
[1:26:21] how that she had made so many mistakes
[1:26:23] in this this house of uh prostitution.
[1:26:28] But in all of this that there was this
[1:26:31] condition she was in she couldn't get
[1:26:32] out of. She maybe it was something that
[1:26:35] happened as a young girl that had got
[1:26:36] her into this place. There was nowhere
[1:26:38] else to go. There was nothing that she
[1:26:39] could do to feed her family and take
[1:26:41] care of her family. There was walls on
[1:26:43] every side of her that she couldn't
[1:26:44] escape. There was no other city that she
[1:26:46] could go live in. She couldn't do
[1:26:48] nothing else with her life. Her life was
[1:26:49] a wreck. She had no way out.
[1:26:53] But God saw her in that very condition
[1:26:56] in the middle of this city of Jericho.
[1:26:58] How she must have felt so walled in and
[1:27:01] had no way of escape. She was trapped in
[1:27:03] that condition and had no way out. No
[1:27:05] way. Her life, her foreseeable future,
[1:27:07] her life, it it would never leave that
[1:27:09] condition. I imagine as she sit and
[1:27:11] talked many times about how her life
[1:27:13] would always be this way. What am I
[1:27:15] going to do when I get old? Who's going
[1:27:17] to feed me? Who's going to take care of
[1:27:19] me? What a wreck that her life was in
[1:27:21] trapped in this walled city. But let me
[1:27:24] tell you what God did. He saw her in
[1:27:26] that condition. And can I just say it
[1:27:27] like I seen it? And he sent an army to
[1:27:30] bring her out. He didn't send one man.
[1:27:33] He didn't send two spies. God sent an
[1:27:35] army. The very army, the entire army of
[1:27:39] God that was upon the face of the earth,
[1:27:41] he sent to her doorstep to bring her out
[1:27:44] of that condition. She was trapped in
[1:27:46] Jericho. Hello, somebody. She had no way
[1:27:49] out. She had no way to get out of that
[1:27:51] lie. She was a a slave to her lifestyle.
[1:27:54] She was under the shadow of a great wall
[1:27:56] her whole life. She had been used up by
[1:27:58] the devil. She had been accused by every
[1:28:00] accuser. She had been abused by every
[1:28:02] man. I wonder how many nights that she
[1:28:05] laid there praying and begging God, "Oh,
[1:28:07] I don't belong here, but I got nowhere
[1:28:09] else to go. If there's a God somewhere
[1:28:11] that could bring me out, is there a God
[1:28:13] somewhere that can lift me out of this
[1:28:15] condition?" But then one day, she heard
[1:28:17] about the God of Israel. He was a
[1:28:19] miracle working God. He had the ability
[1:28:21] to part waters of the Red Sea. He had
[1:28:24] the ability to bring his children out of
[1:28:26] bondage when they were in Egypt. She
[1:28:28] said, "Oh God, I am such a daughter. I
[1:28:30] am such a child that's in a place of
[1:28:32] bondage, and I need thee, oh God."
[1:28:36] And so much when the spies came to her
[1:28:37] house, she said, "We've heard of your
[1:28:39] God. We've heard the men are fear of
[1:28:42] your God. They are afraid of your God."
[1:28:44] She said, "But would you ask the Lord?
[1:28:47] Not just your God, not just their God,
[1:28:49] but the Lord. She She wanted to be
[1:28:52] identified with God.
[1:28:54] Ask the Lord for a way to save me. Don't
[1:28:57] you realize that God was on his way to
[1:29:00] her, she didn't know it. She was sitting
[1:29:03] there in that condition. My I could just
[1:29:04] see her what a mess that she was in. But
[1:29:07] the whole time she was praying, the
[1:29:09] whole time she was feeling about this,
[1:29:11] she was predestinated to God. She
[1:29:13] belonged to God. Ain't that right? That
[1:29:15] God wouldn't guide her. She didn't. And
[1:29:17] the whole time she was in that
[1:29:19] condition, all the struggles, all the
[1:29:21] trials, all the them sleepless nights,
[1:29:23] all the the the the filthy work that she
[1:29:26] was in, but the whole time that God was
[1:29:29] on his way to her. My isn't that
[1:29:31] powerful? Just depends on how you want
[1:29:32] to read the Bible. They went through
[1:29:34] they they they fought through battles to
[1:29:36] get through her. They crossed Red Seas
[1:29:38] to get through her. They crossed
[1:29:39] wildernesses to get through her. They
[1:29:40] they went through many battles in the
[1:29:42] wilderness. They fought many men just to
[1:29:44] get to the door of the house of
[1:29:47] Rahab. God had one that was coming that
[1:29:50] would avenge her. Her life, it was
[1:29:53] Joshua who was a type of the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:56] Look who God sends. And when he comes to
[1:29:58] her life, he's going to take everything
[1:30:02] that had ever held her back and he's
[1:30:04] going to destroy it out of her
[1:30:06] life. Everything, all of her past, he
[1:30:09] was coming to destroy it. My isn't that
[1:30:11] something? Joshua didn't even know what
[1:30:12] he was going to do. He thought he would
[1:30:14] just follow the commission of the Lord.
[1:30:16] But God had a God had him on a
[1:30:18] mission. Everything in her life he was
[1:30:20] going to destroy. See, you know what it
[1:30:21] means to avenge? It means to write a
[1:30:23] wrong by punishing the wrongdoer on
[1:30:25] behalf of the innocent. She didn't have
[1:30:27] the ability to destroy her past, but
[1:30:29] Joshua did. Here's a type of the Holy
[1:30:32] Ghost. So here when he would come to
[1:30:34] this place as as one that would have the
[1:30:37] ability to avenge her of the wrongs that
[1:30:39] had been done in her life, you know,
[1:30:40] when you read in the book of of numbers
[1:30:42] the 35th chapter, you can read about
[1:30:44] about the the revengers of the blood or
[1:30:46] the avengers of the blood. And and the
[1:30:48] the Bible uses that word gow g a l gow.
[1:30:51] And but when you read this word, it's a
[1:30:53] Hebrew word. It means to redeem or to
[1:30:56] avenge or to deliver. So when you read
[1:30:58] about in numbers 35, it talks about the
[1:31:00] avenger that would come. But when you
[1:31:01] read in the book of Ruth, I thought this
[1:31:03] is powerful about this word because when
[1:31:05] you read the book of Ruth, that same
[1:31:07] word gow is written in the book of Ruth.
[1:31:09] But when we read it in the English
[1:31:10] language, it has a different
[1:31:11] translation. It don't say avenge or
[1:31:14] revenge. But when you read it in Ruth,
[1:31:16] seven times it's written there and it's
[1:31:18] written as the word redeem. So the same
[1:31:20] word that was to avenge or to revenge is
[1:31:23] the same word that's used in the book of
[1:31:25] Ruth that means redeem. So, so, so it
[1:31:27] would mean this. It was an act as a
[1:31:29] kinsman to do the part of the next of
[1:31:31] kin. And another meaning would be the
[1:31:34] payment by pay to redeem by payment of
[1:31:36] value assessed. Isn't that powerful? By
[1:31:39] payment of the assessed value. In other
[1:31:40] words, the full value of what it is, the
[1:31:43] full payment would be made. That's what
[1:31:44] it means to redeem of consecrated
[1:31:46] things. Listen to the best part. By the
[1:31:48] original owner, this is what Joshua was
[1:31:51] coming to do. by the original owner to
[1:31:54] redeem with God as subject implying a
[1:31:57] personal relationship. So here would
[1:31:59] come the one that she belonged to in the
[1:32:01] beginning just like God done to every
[1:32:03] one of us when Satan had you in his old
[1:32:05] greasy palms. But you didn't belong to
[1:32:07] the devil. You belong to God. And when
[1:32:09] God would come as the original owner, I
[1:32:11] don't care about your life or your past
[1:32:13] or your failures or where God brought
[1:32:15] you out of. I don't need to know about
[1:32:17] that. All I need to know is that you
[1:32:19] belong to God before the foundation of
[1:32:21] the world. And the original owner made
[1:32:24] an assessment of your life and he paid
[1:32:26] the full price of the assessed value.
[1:32:29] Glory to God. He didn't try to get you
[1:32:31] for a bargain. He didn't try to jew the
[1:32:33] devil down. He paid every price that
[1:32:35] that that was due so that there wasn't
[1:32:37] nobody that could come back and lay any
[1:32:39] claim upon your life. Let me tell you,
[1:32:41] he paid the the assessed price. She
[1:32:44] didn't know she belonged to God. Matter
[1:32:46] of fact, she didn't even know who she
[1:32:47] was. After all, Rahab, me tell you what
[1:32:50] Rahab thought she was. Somebody wants to
[1:32:51] know. Rahab taught she was a harlot.
[1:32:55] That's what Rahab thought she was
[1:32:57] because that was her life. I thought,
[1:32:58] but that that ain't who she was anyway.
[1:33:00] That's just what she done. She was
[1:33:02] living as that. But that ain't who she
[1:33:03] was. That's what the devil I know I said
[1:33:05] this before, but that's what the devil
[1:33:07] tells you. Anytime you fail, he calls
[1:33:09] you a failure. When you sin, you're a
[1:33:11] sinner. If you commit an adultery,
[1:33:12] you're an adulterer. If if you make
[1:33:14] mistake that that you if you lied, then
[1:33:16] you're a liar. But I got news for you.
[1:33:19] Sin can never be your identity. Things
[1:33:22] that you've done can't be your identity.
[1:33:24] But your identity was given to you
[1:33:25] before you were born.
[1:33:28] So that's not what you are. It's just
[1:33:30] what you done. But none of it mattered
[1:33:34] because Bible I'm closing. I hurry
[1:33:36] there. The Bible says on the seventh day
[1:33:39] they marched around the walls of Jericho
[1:33:41] and they heard the sound of the freedom
[1:33:45] trumpet of Joshua ring out. I thought my
[1:33:47] wasn't that powerful. They hear Rahab
[1:33:49] when she would she had be listed that
[1:33:51] day. They marched around those walls and
[1:33:53] the sound of freedom rang out. Let me
[1:33:55] tell you what it was, brother Mark. It
[1:33:56] was the voice of redemption to the
[1:33:58] bride. It was a voice of redemption to a
[1:34:00] gentile bride. Let me tell you what it
[1:34:02] done. It shook. They all the men of
[1:34:05] Jericho, they shook with fear. But
[1:34:07] Rahab, she stood with courage. They ran
[1:34:10] at the call of God. But she responded to
[1:34:13] it. That's our call. That's our That's
[1:34:15] our redeemer that's coming to save us.
[1:34:17] That that's that that's God. He's
[1:34:19] knocking on my door. That salvation,
[1:34:21] it's coming to my house. I don't have to
[1:34:23] be afraid. It's the salvation of the
[1:34:25] Lord. He's ringing out in my ears right
[1:34:27] now that it didn't matter what I came
[1:34:29] out of. That ain't going to identify me.
[1:34:31] That ain't who I am. It's what I done.
[1:34:34] But I belong to God in the first place
[1:34:36] until finally it would break off of our
[1:34:38] life.
[1:34:39] Jesus brother said we're living in such
[1:34:42] a fear. That's why Jesus always had to
[1:34:44] say fear not. He said, "We're," that's
[1:34:45] the trouble with the church today. We're
[1:34:47] scared to death that we're going to make
[1:34:48] a failure. He said, "But how? Glory to
[1:34:51] God. How can you fail if you're in
[1:34:55] Christ?
[1:34:56] We're so scared we're going to be a
[1:34:58] failure, but how can you fail when
[1:35:00] you're in Christ? You can't fail. You've
[1:35:02] got everlasting life. All demons in hell
[1:35:05] can't shake you. You've got everlasting
[1:35:07] life." Jesus said so. So, don't be
[1:35:10] afraid of failure.
[1:35:12] Don't be afraid that you're going to
[1:35:14] serve God and fail. How can you fail?
[1:35:17] You got everlasting love. Oh friends,
[1:35:19] when they when they went to shouting,
[1:35:22] the walls of Jericho started to
[1:35:25] shake. The more they should, after a few
[1:35:28] seconds, they begin to rumble and fall
[1:35:31] down that that two-tiered city. The
[1:35:33] walls begin to fall down the the way
[1:35:35] where the men of of Joshua could walk
[1:35:37] right up. And the Bible says, "And then
[1:35:39] they burned the city with fire and all
[1:35:41] that was in it. Only the silver and gold
[1:35:44] they couldn't the treasure of the Lord.
[1:35:45] But Joshua saved Rahab the harlot with
[1:35:48] her father's household and all that she
[1:35:50] had. And she lives in Israel even to
[1:35:52] this day because she hid the messengers
[1:35:54] whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."
[1:35:57] The very thing that had her bound,
[1:36:00] destiny, it was destroyed. The very
[1:36:03] thing, every accuser that she had was
[1:36:06] killed. They were burned to the ground.
[1:36:08] They were slain with a sword. My you
[1:36:10] know, let me tell you what happened that
[1:36:12] that that when she went on with her
[1:36:14] life, do you realize that according to
[1:36:15] the laws of of Israel that if a person
[1:36:18] were to going to to be accused of a of a
[1:36:21] sin or a wrong that they committed that
[1:36:23] it took two witnesses a good report. And
[1:36:25] here Joshua by the order of the Lord had
[1:36:27] killed every man, woman, and child in
[1:36:29] Jericho, saving Rahab and her family
[1:36:32] that come out there. Let me tell you
[1:36:33] what that means. That means every
[1:36:35] witness that could stand against her was
[1:36:37] slain by the sword of Joshua. In other
[1:36:39] words, it was destroyed by the Holy
[1:36:40] Ghost. It didn't mean it didn't have the
[1:36:42] ability to stand and accuse you no more.
[1:36:45] The only one that could accuse her that
[1:36:47] was left and remaining was her. And she
[1:36:49] could stand up all she wanted to and
[1:36:51] come to Joshua and say, Joshua, I ain't
[1:36:53] nothing but a failure. I can just tell
[1:36:54] you, I used to be a harlot. You know, I
[1:36:56] I made a lot of mistakes. I've done a
[1:36:58] long wrongdoing. I don't deserve to go
[1:36:59] with Israel. I don't deserve to be
[1:37:01] saved. I don't be I don't deserve to be
[1:37:03] called the bride of Christ. I don't
[1:37:05] deserve to be a Christian. That Joshua
[1:37:06] would look right in her face. He said,
[1:37:08] "Well, that's wonderful, but where's the
[1:37:10] second report?" It takes two reports for
[1:37:12] an accusation to come up on somebody's
[1:37:14] life. Somebody find me another man that
[1:37:17] is alive that could witness to what this
[1:37:19] woman says that every single one of her
[1:37:21] accusers had been destroyed by the sword
[1:37:24] of the Holy Ghost. Friends, let me tell
[1:37:26] you, that's what happened to every
[1:37:28] believer in here this morning. I don't
[1:37:30] care what the devil said. I don't care
[1:37:32] what you saw and the places you've gone,
[1:37:34] but the accusers that that you had in
[1:37:36] your life have been destroyed by the
[1:37:39] Holy Ghost. Brother Tom, they've been
[1:37:41] destroyed out of our life. Said, "See
[1:37:44] what happened to her? She was one of
[1:37:46] those when she was taken as one of the
[1:37:47] Israelites. She fell in love with a man
[1:37:50] that was a captain and the prince of
[1:37:51] Judah. And finally, she married him. And
[1:37:54] when the estate was settled up for the
[1:37:55] Israelites, she and her beloved husband
[1:37:57] lived in Bethlehem. a gentile bride
[1:38:01] married to a
[1:38:02] Jew. Why? Because she believed in a
[1:38:05] miracle working God. Look what was what
[1:38:09] she come from from being out of a house
[1:38:11] of ill fame of prostitution. But through
[1:38:14] her conversion and through her unfailing
[1:38:16] faith in God, it brought her from a
[1:38:18] prostitute house to a beautiful home in
[1:38:21] Bethlehem.
[1:38:23] Isn't that powerful? It brought her from
[1:38:25] a prostitute house to a beautiful home
[1:38:28] in Bethlehem. What a difference. But
[1:38:31] David, she built her alive on a new
[1:38:35] foundation. The rock of salvation by
[1:38:39] redemption. The price was paid. The past
[1:38:41] was destroyed. Her past was erased. Can
[1:38:44] I tell you what happened to her
[1:38:46] past? What God had had delivered her
[1:38:48] from? How many wants to know?
[1:38:50] Joshua said after he brought her out, he
[1:38:53] laid this oath on them, "Cursed is the
[1:38:55] man before the
[1:38:57] Lord who rises up and rebuilds this city
[1:39:00] Jericho. With the loss of his firstborn
[1:39:03] shall he lay its foundation, and with
[1:39:05] the loss of his youngest son, so he set
[1:39:07] up the gates." See, that's what happened
[1:39:10] to the children of Hyel, the builder.
[1:39:13] when he was coming to rebuild a city
[1:39:16] that had been cursed. The Bible said in
[1:39:19] his days hael the Bethlite built
[1:39:20] Jericho. He laid its foundations at the
[1:39:23] cost of the life of Abraham his
[1:39:25] firstborn. He set up the gates at the
[1:39:28] loss of his youngest son according to
[1:39:30] the word of the Lord which he had spoke
[1:39:31] to Joshua the son of Nun. The loss came
[1:39:35] because he was building on a cursed
[1:39:37] foundation. Isn't this powerful? I
[1:39:40] thought
[1:39:41] here 5 30 years
[1:39:44] later had 530 years had passed since the
[1:39:48] time that Rahab had walked away from the
[1:39:51] rubble that was
[1:39:53] Jericho. I thought here as she walked
[1:39:56] away from this place and down the road
[1:39:58] to
[1:40:00] Bethlehem, she left behind her all of
[1:40:03] the abuse. She left behind her all of
[1:40:07] the accusers. She left behind her all of
[1:40:10] the the misuse and how that she was
[1:40:13] mishandled and taken advantage of all
[1:40:15] that was left behind her. I thought how
[1:40:17] she must have felt when she was walking
[1:40:20] away from the rubble of what used to
[1:40:24] have her so
[1:40:26] bad. And as her back was turned to it,
[1:40:28] can I just say this as we're closing? As
[1:40:31] her back was turned to it and she's
[1:40:34] walking towards this new life of
[1:40:36] Bethlehem.
[1:40:38] But she hears the words of Joshua behind
[1:40:42] her saying, "Cursed is any man that
[1:40:45] would ever try to rebuild this. For what
[1:40:48] God has done, let it be done." When a
[1:40:50] man would try to rebuild this city,
[1:40:52] he'll pay for it for the life of his
[1:40:53] son. I thought, "My Rahab must have been
[1:40:55] rejoicing." You mean all my past that's
[1:40:58] been torn down that God intends for it
[1:41:00] to lay there? Amen. It's going to lay in
[1:41:03] that condition that God would so much
[1:41:04] that he would put a curse upon a man
[1:41:06] that would try to bring it back up
[1:41:08] again. Cursed be the man that would try
[1:41:10] to build the wall back up that had my
[1:41:12] Rahab w trapped up. Cursed be the man
[1:41:14] that would try to raise back up the city
[1:41:16] that had her trapped and no way out.
[1:41:18] Cursed be the man that would try to
[1:41:20] revive her past and build it up. That
[1:41:23] every day that of her life when she
[1:41:25] would ever travel by this place, I want
[1:41:27] her to see it as a field of rubble. I
[1:41:29] wanted to see it as a scorned place, a
[1:41:31] burned down place that there ain't
[1:41:33] nothing there that could ever honor ever
[1:41:35] again.
[1:41:36] The curse of God was put upon that land.
[1:41:39] I thought, I wonder how many days that
[1:41:41] she traveled down the to the ruins of
[1:41:45] Jericho and said, "There lays my
[1:41:48] past, my memories." And it's just a
[1:41:51] memory now. All those old things, it
[1:41:53] ain't it ain't a part of me no more.
[1:41:55] It's just a
[1:41:57] memory. 5 30 years later, God remembered
[1:42:01] the promise that he had made. Ahab was
[1:42:05] building his kingdom. H was the builder.
[1:42:08] Went to build the city of Jericho. The
[1:42:10] curse of God fell upon his life because
[1:42:13] he would build that in that very place.
[1:42:15] You know, even to this day, even the
[1:42:17] city of Jericho that's
[1:42:19] nearby. But even to this day, that very
[1:42:21] city that Rahab lived in, you got a
[1:42:24] picture of it. Archaeologists have done
[1:42:26] many digs over the past years there sets
[1:42:29] the ruins of what was Jericho dug out of
[1:42:32] the ground they found even the stones
[1:42:35] they in one place that they found stones
[1:42:37] where they would say that it was the
[1:42:39] only portion of the wall that didn't
[1:42:40] fall like it was just one little spot
[1:42:42] where these stones that they dug out and
[1:42:44] showed how that the foundation of the
[1:42:45] city was built in one little spot the
[1:42:47] stones didn't fall remember Rahab's
[1:42:48] house it was sitting on a wall I was
[1:42:50] reading about all the things they that
[1:42:52] they found through the archaeologist
[1:42:53] side said they found a 1 meter thick
[1:42:55] layer of ash and debris, including jars
[1:42:58] of burnt wheat that had been found in
[1:43:00] many sections of the city. Jars of
[1:43:02] charred grain that would support the
[1:43:03] Bible's claims that the attack took
[1:43:06] place just after harvest under the under
[1:43:08] the siege was short seven days. The
[1:43:10] Israelites didn't plunder. They left it.
[1:43:12] Only thing they took out was the metals,
[1:43:13] but everything else was still there.
[1:43:15] They found char burnt seeds and we even
[1:43:17] some houses in the lower part of the
[1:43:19] city that were built in the lower city
[1:43:20] wall which was exactly how Rahab's house
[1:43:23] is described. In at least one area there
[1:43:25] was a mud brick wall that had not
[1:43:26] collapsed consistent with Rahab's house
[1:43:28] being spared even though it was attached
[1:43:30] to a city wall. This is the things that
[1:43:32] they have found when they've been
[1:43:33] excavating in the place of Jericho. But
[1:43:36] let me tell you what they didn't find as
[1:43:38] a music player's coming. What they
[1:43:40] didn't find is they never found any
[1:43:42] evidence of Rahab's
[1:43:46] They never found any part of her history
[1:43:49] or of her past or to say, "Well, that's
[1:43:52] what she was." Or there's no evidence of
[1:43:54] Rahab being a whatever you want to call
[1:43:57] her. There there's no evidence of it
[1:43:59] anywhere. And that all that history, it
[1:44:01] was erased and it never became part of
[1:44:05] her life again. It's only a history. It
[1:44:08] ain't a part of who she was. That's not
[1:44:10] even how that she was remembered. Can I
[1:44:13] tell you where it is? You can go there.
[1:44:15] You'll never find the ruins of Rahab.
[1:44:17] You'll never find the life of Rahab.
[1:44:19] There's nothing that ties that place to
[1:44:21] Rahab. There's no there's no tithe. This
[1:44:24] was Rahab's house. There's nothing
[1:44:25] there that even ties her to that old
[1:44:29] place. Let me tell you where you can
[1:44:31] find her. Her history. Matthew the first
[1:44:34] chapter of the Bible says, "This is the
[1:44:36] book of the generation of Jesus Christ,
[1:44:39] the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[1:44:42] Abraham begot Isaac, and Isaac begot
[1:44:45] Jacob, and Jacob begot Judas and his
[1:44:47] brethren. Judas begot Pharisees, and
[1:44:50] Zara of Tamar, and Pharisees begott, and
[1:44:53] Escham begott Aram, and Aram begot
[1:44:55] Aminadab, and Aminadab begat Naan, and
[1:44:58] Nan begot Salmon, and Salmon begot Boaz
[1:45:03] of
[1:45:04] Rahab. There's her history. It's not in
[1:45:07] the rubble or the ruins of a failed city
[1:45:10] or a failed pass the walls that was
[1:45:13] destroyed to bring her out. But her
[1:45:15] history is laying in the book of the
[1:45:19] generation of Jesus Christ. Friends, let
[1:45:22] me tell you, you looking for your you're
[1:45:24] looking for yourself in the wrong place.
[1:45:27] We're looking for oursel in the wrong
[1:45:29] wrong condition. Looking back in your
[1:45:31] past, you'll never find you there. You
[1:45:33] can bring it all up. You'll never find
[1:45:34] you there because that's not who you
[1:45:36] are. It don't matter what somebody how
[1:45:38] somebody looks at you. It don't matter
[1:45:40] how long it's been. She was Rahab.
[1:45:42] Glory. From the time she left out of
[1:45:44] that city, it was destroyed. There was
[1:45:45] no going back to it. It had been
[1:45:48] destroyed by the Holy Ghost. She
[1:45:50] couldn't even reestablish it. It's a
[1:45:52] cursed land
[1:45:53] today. Couldn't even be built back up
[1:45:56] again. But her her name is found in the
[1:46:00] generation, the book of the generation
[1:46:02] of Jesus Christ. You going to find where
[1:46:03] you are as you stand to your feet.
[1:46:05] You'll find your name written in the
[1:46:08] book of the generation of our Lord
[1:46:11] Jesus. Isn't that a powerful thought
[1:46:13] this morning? The Mark here was a
[1:46:17] woman. She built a new
[1:46:20] life on a sure rock of
[1:46:23] salvation. The redemption of her life,
[1:46:27] the debt has been paid. But say we are
[1:46:30] justified as though you never done it in
[1:46:34] the first place.
[1:46:37] He said it's not even regarded at all.
[1:46:40] Isn't that a powerful thought? Can you
[1:46:41] let this sink in? How's it done? In
[1:46:43] God's book of the sea of forgetfulness,
[1:46:45] your old book of marriage is divorced
[1:46:47] and dead. It's not even in the memories
[1:46:50] of God. You are justified. Therefore,
[1:46:53] being justified, it was accused. You was
[1:46:55] accused, but you never done it in the
[1:46:58] first place. The old union is in the sea
[1:47:00] of God's forgget. You wasn't even
[1:47:03] married to it to begin with. The
[1:47:05] bridegroom, he bore your shame himself
[1:47:08] for you in your place. He took your
[1:47:10] place for you were predestinated for him
[1:47:13] to be in his bride before the foundation
[1:47:15] of the world. The Bible said so. You are
[1:47:20] the predestinated seed of God.
[1:47:26] When I think about the
[1:47:30] Lord, how he saved
[1:47:32] me, how he raised me, how he filled me
[1:47:37] with the Holy Ghost, how he healed me to
[1:47:42] the uttermost. And when I think about
[1:47:45] the
[1:47:47] Lord, how he picked me up, turn me
[1:47:51] around, how he place my
[1:47:54] feet on solid
[1:47:57] ground. I said when I think about the
[1:48:03] Lord, how you save me, how you raised
[1:48:07] me, how you fill me with the Holy Ghost,
[1:48:12] how you heal me to the uttermost. And
[1:48:16] when I think about the
[1:48:19] Lord, how you pick me up and turn me
[1:48:23] around, how you place my
[1:48:26] feet on solid
[1:48:29] ground. It makes me want to shout,
[1:48:34] "Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Lord,
[1:48:38] you're worthy of all the glory, all of
[1:48:41] the honor, all of my
[1:48:44] praise. It makes me want to shout,
[1:48:49] "Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Lord,
[1:48:53] you're worthy of all the glory, all of
[1:48:57] the honor, all of my
[1:48:59] praise." When I think about the Lord,
[1:49:06] how he
[1:49:08] How you raise me, how you feel me.
[1:49:14] Isn't that a wonderful thought this
[1:49:15] morning?
[1:49:17] Oh, when I think about the Lord, how you
[1:49:22] pick me up and you turn me around, how
[1:49:25] you place my
[1:49:27] feet on
[1:49:30] ground, it makes
[1:49:33] me hallelujah.
[1:49:36] Thank you Jesus.
[1:49:40] All the
[1:49:45] [Music]
[1:49:54] glorus all the glor.
[1:49:57] [Music]
[1:50:09] [Music]
[1:50:13] Glory ghost heal to the uttermost. And
[1:50:18] when I think about the
[1:50:21] Lord, how you pick me up and turn me
[1:50:25] around. How you place my
[1:50:28] feet on solid
[1:50:30] ground. It makes me want to shout,
[1:50:35] "Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Lord,
[1:50:39] you're worthy of all the glory, all of
[1:50:42] the honor, all of my praise.
[1:50:46] It makes me want to shout
[1:50:50] hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Lord,
[1:50:53] you're worthy of all the glory, all of
[1:50:57] the honor, all of my praise.
[1:51:02] When I think about the
[1:51:05] Lord, how you save me, how you raise me,
[1:51:10] how you fill me with the Holy Ghost, how
[1:51:14] you heal me to the uttermost. And when I
[1:51:18] think about the Lord, how you pick me up
[1:51:24] and turn me around, how you place my
[1:51:27] feet.
[1:51:32] [Music]
[1:51:36] Hallelujah. Jesus,
[1:51:40] all the glory,
[1:51:43] Lord, all of my
[1:51:48] praise. Amen. Won't you give the Lord a
[1:51:50] hand clap of praise this
[1:51:53] morning? I've been
[1:51:56] changed. I've been healed.
[1:52:00] Yes, I've been free.
[1:52:04] I've been
[1:52:07] delivered and I found joy.
[1:52:12] I found
[1:52:14] peace. Amazing grace.
[1:52:18] I'm highly
[1:52:20] favored. And right now is the moment.
[1:52:26] Yesterday is the day. I've been
[1:52:30] changed. Yes, I've been
[1:52:34] changed. And I said, I won't go back. I
[1:52:38] can't go back to the way it used to be
[1:52:43] before your spirit came and changed me.
[1:52:48] Well, I said I won't go back. I can't go
[1:52:52] back to the way it used to be before
[1:52:56] your spirit came and changed me. Well,
[1:53:01] all my shame,
[1:53:04] all my guilt, all my guilt, yes. All my
[1:53:08] sins, all my sins, they've been
[1:53:12] forgiven. Now there's no more chains.
[1:53:16] Hallelujah. No more fear.
[1:53:20] Yes. All my past
[1:53:23] is finally
[1:53:25] over. And right now is the moment. I
[1:53:30] wonder how many make that declaration
[1:53:31] this morning. I've been
[1:53:34] changed. Yes, I've been changed. And I
[1:53:39] say that I won't go back. I can't go
[1:53:43] back to the way it used to be before
[1:53:48] your spirit came and changed me. Well, I
[1:53:52] said I won't go back. I can't go back to
[1:53:57] the way it used to be before your spirit
[1:54:01] came and changed me. Well, all my shame,
[1:54:08] all my guilt, all my Yes. All my sins,
[1:54:13] all my sins, they've been
[1:54:16] forgiven. Now there's no more chains.
[1:54:20] Well, I just makes me want to shout.
[1:54:22] Where there's no more fear, all my Yes.
[1:54:26] Oh, my past is
[1:54:29] over. And right now is the moment. Yes,
[1:54:34] today is the day I've been changed. Come
[1:54:38] on, Rahab. Won't you sing it to the
[1:54:40] Lord? I know it's my day. And I said, I
[1:54:45] won't go back. I can't go back to the
[1:54:48] way it used to be before your spirit
[1:54:52] came and changed
[1:54:54] me. Yes. I said I won't go back. I can't
[1:54:59] go back to the way it used to be before
[1:55:04] your spirit came and changed me.
[1:55:11] [Applause]
[1:55:22] Hallelujah. We ain't got to go back to
[1:55:24] that. My past is laying in rubble. What
[1:55:27] a revelation. It's laying in
[1:55:30] rubble. I know what the devil does. He
[1:55:32] comes flying by. It's who you
[1:55:35] are. That's what I did.
[1:55:38] who I am. My name's been written in the
[1:55:41] book of the generation of Jesus Christ.
[1:55:44] Ain't that powerful? You know, there's a
[1:55:46] book of the generation of Christ
[1:55:50] pre of his ministry on the earth and his
[1:55:53] birth, death and burial and
[1:55:55] resurrection. But there's a book of the
[1:55:57] generation of Christ post his death and
[1:56:00] burial and resurrection. My name's
[1:56:02] written in that book. We are the
[1:56:05] generation. Isn't that powerful? Brother
[1:56:07] Mark, we come from the very bloodline of
[1:56:10] Jesus Christ. The blood that flowed
[1:56:12] through the through the very lamb of God
[1:56:14] that flowed through the veins of Jesus
[1:56:17] Christ upon this earth. That same blood,
[1:56:19] the blood of God was paid for our sin.
[1:56:23] And that very blood is what ties you to
[1:56:25] God. Amen. I wish you could do a DNA
[1:56:28] test, a spiritual DNA test on your life.
[1:56:30] That's what God done this morning to
[1:56:33] show you where you really came from and
[1:56:34] who you belong to.
[1:56:37] Isn't the Lord wonderful? Won't you give
[1:56:38] him another hand clap of praise?
[1:56:40] Somebody say, "God is good." Somebody
[1:56:42] say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:56:46] I said, "All my
[1:56:50] shame, all my guilt,
[1:56:54] all my sins, all my s, they been
[1:56:58] forgiven.
[1:57:00] Now there's no more change,
[1:57:05] no more fear,
[1:57:08] it's all my past.
[1:57:11] It's finally over.
[1:57:20] [Music]
[1:57:38] Your spirit came and change.
[1:57:56] [Music]
[1:58:08] I've been
[1:58:10] delivered and I'

[1:59:42] I'

[2:00:13] Your spirit came and
[2:00:29] changed me.
[2:00:32] [Music]
[2:00:42] came and changed
[2:00:45] [Music]
[2:00:47] me. Jesus is here.

[2:01:35] Oh, I receive

[2:01:45] hands toward the heavens.
[2:01:49] I lift my eyes where my help comes
[2:01:55] from. I look to
[2:01:58] you. You're my rock, my
[2:02:02] healer. I trust in
[2:02:05] [Music]
[2:02:07] you. I know he is here.
[2:02:16] He is here.
[2:02:22] [Music]
[2:02:23] Healing is here.
[2:02:27] Yes, my
[2:02:29] Lord. I believe
[2:02:35] it. Oh, he is
[2:02:42] here. He is here.
[2:02:50] Healing is
[2:02:53] here. Yes, my
[2:02:55] Lord. And
[2:02:57] I'm
[2:03:01] leaving. So I lift my
[2:03:06] hands. Won't you just lift your hands to
[2:03:08] the Lord? Just worshiping a moment
[2:03:11] before we go. Where my help comes from.
[2:03:17] I look to you.
[2:03:20] You're my rock, my
[2:03:22] healer. I trust in you. Yes. I lift my
[2:03:28] hands.
[2:03:33] Oh, to the
[2:03:36] heaven. I lift my eyes where my help
[2:03:41] comes from.
[2:03:43] I look to
[2:03:45] you. You're my rock, my
[2:03:49] healer, and I trust in
[2:03:56] you. Jesus
[2:03:58] is
[2:04:03] here. Jesus is here.
[2:04:10] My Jesus
[2:04:12] [Music]
[2:04:13] is
[2:04:18] my
[2:04:20] receive. Amen. You love the Lord this
[2:04:23] morning. How many just give him a hand
[2:04:25] clap of
[2:04:30] praises? He is. Let's just bow our heads
[2:04:32] together. Gracious heavenly father,
[2:04:35] Lord, how wonderful that you are,
[2:04:38] Lord, God. What a privilege, Lord, to
[2:04:42] know
[2:04:43] you, Lord,
[2:04:45] to know how that you've called us, Lord,
[2:04:49] and saved us. Not just a salvation,
[2:04:51] Lord, but a salvation by
[2:04:54] redemption, Lord. The price that has
[2:04:56] been paid for our life, Lord.
[2:05:00] Lord, everything that was owed, Lord,
[2:05:02] was
[2:05:03] paid. Lord, here we stand as free men
[2:05:07] and women of God. And Lord, I thank you,
[2:05:10] Lord, for that. Lord, may it never
[2:05:13] become old, Lord, or not have the
[2:05:16] meaning that it
[2:05:18] should. Lord, may we never forget to
[2:05:21] remember or to remind one
[2:05:23] another of the things that you've done
[2:05:26] in our life. Lord, I thank you for each
[2:05:29] one in this this morning, Lord. May the
[2:05:31] church be encouraged as we go from this
[2:05:33] place,
[2:05:34] Lord. God, that we have something to
[2:05:37] build a life on. I pray that you would
[2:05:39] help every stone that's built, every
[2:05:41] stone that's laid in every family, Lord,
[2:05:44] would be according to thy word, God.
[2:05:46] Something, Lord, in their life that
[2:05:48] would be established that Satan would
[2:05:50] have no ability to destroy. Strengthen
[2:05:53] the body of believers, the saints of
[2:05:54] God, Lord, this morning, Lord. May you
[2:05:57] give us such a zeal, Lord, to to bring
[2:05:59] others into the fold. Lord, that there's
[2:06:02] there's a grahabs that are out there
[2:06:03] looking and searching. They're no doubt
[2:06:06] trap. And Lord, you have an army in this
[2:06:08] world today led by that same Joshua, the
[2:06:11] Holy Ghost. Lord, may we go where you
[2:06:14] lead us, Lord, and call who you send us
[2:06:16] to call, Lord, that your house may be
[2:06:19] filled. Lord, we thank you for all you
[2:06:21] do. Lord, I ask, Lord, our brother David
[2:06:24] had a special request this morning.
[2:06:26] God has asked the church to remember,
[2:06:29] Lord. So here as a body of believers,
[2:06:31] Lord, we call upon you, Lord, and call
[2:06:35] out his name. And Lord, I pray that God
[2:06:37] that you would you would move in in his
[2:06:40] family, Lord, and intercede on this
[2:06:41] great need, God, that your hand of
[2:06:44] mercy, Lord, would be upon it, Lord. We
[2:06:47] just ask you, Lord God, because we trust
[2:06:49] you and Lord, we'll remember it as the
[2:06:51] week goes on. Lord, we just thank you
[2:06:53] for all that you do for us. and we give
[2:06:55] you glory for it. In the name of Jesus
[2:06:57] Christ we pray.
[2:07:00] Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning.
[2:07:03] Just want to remind the church next
[2:07:08] Sunday, Father's Day. We
[2:07:12] have brother Andrew will be here. He'll
[2:07:15] be speaking for us on Sunday, but also
[2:07:17] the following day we'll be going on the
[2:07:20] youth trip. So, we're going to leave
[2:07:22] Monday morning and Branson. And so we
[2:07:26] just encourage everybody that's going,
[2:07:29] if you haven't got everything settled up
[2:07:31] on that, try to do that beforehand. We
[2:07:34] got all the rooms and everything booked
[2:07:35] and and paid for. You can just get with
[2:07:38] with my wife on that or me. And
[2:07:42] also that sister Cara and and sister
[2:07:48] Mariah Glover have helped set up a
[2:07:52] church directory. And so I think brother
[2:07:54] announced that this morning I'm sure.
[2:07:56] But uh but all they need is your email
[2:07:59] address to set you up an account and so
[2:08:03] I think they had some forms if you want
[2:08:04] them to fill everything out for you. But
[2:08:05] you don't have to put all your
[2:08:06] information. They don't need your social
[2:08:08] security number and all all that stuff
[2:08:10] and your credit score. Uh but but the
[2:08:13] church has grown so fast and I'm not
[2:08:16] going to ask you to raise hands, but how
[2:08:18] many people could raise their hand this
[2:08:20] morning that that know that can look
[2:08:22] around and people in here that they
[2:08:23] don't know their name. So, we could all
[2:08:25] raise our hand, but but uh but the
[2:08:28] church grows that fast and people's
[2:08:30] always asking for numbers. So, it's just
[2:08:31] a way that people could see who's coming
[2:08:33] in. And so, uh we've me and brother
[2:08:36] Andrew are going to take care of the
[2:08:38] cost of it. But, Sister Mariah is going
[2:08:40] to take photos for anybody that would
[2:08:42] like photos to be taken
[2:08:45] and and to put their family photo on
[2:08:48] there. So, she's going to do that next
[2:08:50] Sunday after church. So, I thought that
[2:08:52] was a really nice thing to to be able to
[2:08:54] do. So, if you don't have a family photo
[2:08:56] to put on there, that's good. And if
[2:08:58] nothing else, you can you can you can
[2:09:00] kind of know who's who, that might help
[2:09:03] you. A lot of new folks, they don't
[2:09:05] don't know who everybody is. So, we just
[2:09:07] encourage you to put the information
[2:09:08] that you want on there. We don't you
[2:09:10] don't have to put everything. If your
[2:09:11] number is private, you want to keep it
[2:09:12] private, keep it private. Just put the
[2:09:13] info that you'd want. If it's just kids
[2:09:15] names and birthdays, that's fine, too.
[2:09:17] uh just so uh that we can kind of we
[2:09:21] want to be able to say happy birthday
[2:09:22] every now and then to somebody too. And
[2:09:24] I'm the worst with remembering
[2:09:25] everything and and we thank God for it,
[2:09:28] but the church has gotten too big to
[2:09:30] remember everybody's birthdays and
[2:09:32] anniversaries and that's a that's a a
[2:09:34] wonderful thing, but this is a good tool
[2:09:36] to be able to help. So appreciate those
[2:09:38] sisters doing that and you can get with
[2:09:43] [Applause]
[2:09:45] them. God bless you as you go.
[2:09:50] Amen. Where do I
[2:09:52] [Music]
[2:09:54] go? When the storms of life are raging,
[2:09:59] who do I talk
[2:10:02] to? When the winds of sorrow blow? Is
[2:10:07] there
[2:10:08] [Music]
[2:10:10] auge in the time of
[2:10:13] tribulation? I go to the rock. I know
[2:10:17] that he's able. I go to the
[2:10:21] rock. Well, I go to the rock of my
[2:10:25] salvation. I go to the stone that the
[2:10:28] builders rejected.
