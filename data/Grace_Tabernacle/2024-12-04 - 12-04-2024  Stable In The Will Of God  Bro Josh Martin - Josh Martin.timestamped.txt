[13:11] evening amen whatever you have need of
[13:14] just asking for it let's sing that song
[13:17] I'm getting ready to leave this world
[13:19] key of D how many of you getting ready
[13:21] to leave this world Amen I was listening
[13:24] to a sermon today and the minister
[13:26] mentioned an article and it said the
[13:29] Sanhedrin have made a announcement and
[13:33] it said that all the Jews need to come
[13:36] back to Israel
[13:38] immediately and it kind of quickened me
[13:41] because you know the prophet says watch
[13:43] Israel whenever whatever God's doing
[13:44] with Israel he's going to do with the
[13:45] church and it said in that article they
[13:48] the the Sanhedrin and the council they
[13:50] told the people whatever you got to do
[13:52] get home it's it's pertinent it's
[13:54] important that you get home to Israel
[13:57] now and he says whatever you got to do
[13:59] he says if you got to sell some stuff to
[14:01] get over here he say if you got to leave
[14:02] jobs he says whatever you got to do just
[14:05] get over here to Israel now because you
[14:06] only can be protected in Israel and that
[14:09] stirred my heart cuz Saints we're
[14:11] getting ready to leave this world and I
[14:14] think it's time we just set aside all

[41:28] pray it can it can come together and
[41:31] strengthen and and edify in some way and
[41:33] if I would have a subject it would be
[41:35] stable in the will of God and these are
[41:38] just some things I I've been been
[41:40] studying going and it's been an
[41:41] encouragement to me being being
[41:43] stabilized and so I pray it can it can
[41:46] help you as well tonight but there in
[41:48] job 23 And1 The Bible would say then job
[41:51] answered and said even to today is my
[41:54] complaint bitter my stroke is heavier
[41:56] than my my groaning oh that I knew where
[41:59] I might find him that I might come even
[42:01] to his seat I would order my cause
[42:04] before him and fill my mouth with
[42:06] arguments I would know the words which
[42:08] he would answer me and understand what
[42:10] he would say unto me will he plead
[42:13] against me with his great power no but
[42:15] he would put strength in me there there
[42:19] the righteous might dispute with him so
[42:21] should I be delivered from Ever from my
[42:24] judge behold I go forward but he is not
[42:27] there backward but I cannot perceive him
[42:30] on the left hand where he doth work but
[42:32] I cannot Behold Him He hideth himself on
[42:35] the right hand that I cannot see him but
[42:38] he knoweth the way that I take and when
[42:41] he ha tried me I shall come forth as
[42:43] gold my foot hath held his steps his way
[42:47] have I kept and not declined neither
[42:49] have I gone back from the Commandment of
[42:51] his lips I have esteemed the words of
[42:54] his mouth more than my necessary food
[42:57] but he is in one mind who can turn him
[43:00] and what his soul desireth even that he
[43:03] doeth for he performeth the thing that
[43:05] is appointed for me and many such things
[43:09] are with Him amen can we bow our heads
[43:11] tonight de gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[43:15] how humbled we are to come into your
[43:17] presence father as we feel you near us
[43:19] tonight Lord God I ask that you would
[43:22] anoint the speaker and the hearer
[43:24] tonight Lord God I ask that you would
[43:26] help me to lab myself aside father and
[43:28] as the word would come forth Lord May It
[43:31] Be Inspired Lord and God as the
[43:33] congregation would hear the words father
[43:35] may they receive it into their hearts
[43:37] Lord whatever the need is God I believe
[43:39] you're still the the need maker Lord the
[43:42] meter of every need father I ask that
[43:44] you would just come among us tonight
[43:45] Lord and and speak to the hearts Lord
[43:47] and to the needs God lord we lay the
[43:50] service into your hands in Jesus
[43:52] Christ's name amen you may be seated and
[43:56] un stable in the will of God and and I
[43:58] want to start out by reading a quote and
[44:01] perseverance brother Brandon would say
[44:03] that's what we do what what we must do
[44:05] you must find first find the will of God
[44:08] before you can do the will of God you
[44:10] must first know what his will is in the
[44:12] matter and then don't turn it loose as
[44:14] the lady said today as she was trying to
[44:17] get beyond the sound barrier and then
[44:19] the plane just picks up the speed and
[44:21] goes at on and limited when it passes
[44:23] the sound barrier well when you pray
[44:26] until you pass that doubt barrier then
[44:28] you're running free and you can go on
[44:30] and there's nothing can bother you then
[44:33] because you're running free you're past
[44:35] unbelief it's done it's been settled
[44:37] it's all over when you get Assurance in
[44:40] your heart that it's going to be that
[44:43] way you're just as happy as if it has
[44:45] already happened so once you get the
[44:48] Assurance in your heart that something
[44:50] is going to be a certain way then you
[44:52] can be as happy now as if though it's
[44:55] already taken place and and we would see
[44:57] that you must fire first find the will
[44:59] of God before you can do the will of God
[45:01] then brother Brandon would tell us then
[45:03] don't turn it loose because many people
[45:06] they they think they find the will of
[45:07] God but the first time they come up
[45:09] against a an opposition or an obstacle
[45:12] well maybe maybe we miss we misheard or
[45:15] or maybe we we we didn't find the will
[45:17] of God you see what that is is the devil
[45:20] coming and trying to pressure you away
[45:23] from what God has for your life you see
[45:25] the very opposition
[45:27] is a sign that you're in the will of God
[45:30] many times cuz brother Brandon would
[45:31] tell us that cloudy skies and and and
[45:34] and and dark clouds above your mind is
[45:37] not a sign of God's disapproval or is
[45:40] the bright skies and sunny days a sign
[45:43] of his approval you see so many times
[45:45] the devil like likes to put question
[45:47] marks in our mind when we come up
[45:49] against something oh maybe I done
[45:51] something wrong maybe maybe I made a
[45:53] mistake here maybe maybe we made the
[45:55] wrong choice here that ain't the time to
[45:58] give up in the will of God that is the
[46:00] time to keep pressing on and we would
[46:02] see that Jesus would be a prime example
[46:06] of following the will of God he would
[46:07] say I do nothing till I see my father do
[46:10] it you know I seek not my own will but
[46:12] the will of the father and and it would
[46:15] be pretty incredible how much Faith
[46:18] Jesus would have to have to accomplish
[46:21] the will of the father CU we would see
[46:23] that he would agonize there in the
[46:24] Garden of Gethsemane and and would would
[46:27] say if it's possible let this cup pass
[46:29] from me he knew what it would take to
[46:32] accomplish the will of God for his life
[46:34] he had to be beaten he had to be
[46:36] crucified his beard had to be plucked
[46:38] out it was already prophesied by David
[46:41] that all of these things would take
[46:43] place and yet he would say nevertheless
[46:46] not my will but thy will be done he was
[46:49] so persuaded of the will of God for his
[46:53] life he was willing to endure and you
[46:55] see are we persuaded enough for the will
[46:58] of God for our lives that we can endure
[47:01] you see many times we turn around in the
[47:03] will of God because we're not persuaded
[47:06] that it is the will of God but if you
[47:08] find that this message is the will of
[47:10] God for your life then you are persuaded
[47:13] and there's nothing that could separate
[47:15] you from the will of God and we would
[47:18] see and I love job's confession he would
[47:21] say you know job 23:11 my foot hath held
[47:24] his steps his way have I kept and not
[47:28] declined neither have I gone back from
[47:30] the Commandments of his lips I have
[47:32] esteemed the words of his mouth more
[47:35] than his necessary food and my my
[47:38] necessary food and job knew what he was
[47:40] doing was the will of God he knew he
[47:43] wasn't a secret sinner he knew he he
[47:45] wasn't he wasn't mistaken on where he
[47:48] was and brother Brandon would say he
[47:50] knew that he was just even whenever his
[47:53] friends were saying he was a secret
[47:55] sinner he knew he was was just because
[47:58] he was in the will of God by by
[48:00] performing a a burnt sacrifice so he
[48:03] knew that the sacrifice had made him
[48:06] perfect and so the will of God that he
[48:08] was in was greater than the accusations
[48:12] that was coming against him and many
[48:14] times we have accusations coming against
[48:16] us how we're doing this wrong we're
[48:18] doing that wrong you made the wrong
[48:19] mistake but if you're in the will of God
[48:22] that will is greater than any accusation
[48:25] that comes against
[48:27] and I believe that is something we all
[48:29] have to find for our lives is what is
[48:31] the will of God for my life because if
[48:34] you don't find it anything is going to
[48:37] turn you away and brother Brandon was
[48:39] said so many times we get to a place
[48:41] where we can't stand still and nervous
[48:44] and and just as we start to do something
[48:46] good then we see trouble coming but that
[48:49] is the devil trying to accept the
[48:52] program of God we find in our individual
[48:55] lives in the church world and National
[48:57] Affairs you find it everywhere and then
[49:00] we then we can know that when we're
[49:02] ready ready to do right wrong is always
[49:05] present but the way to overcome that is
[49:08] to than in your heart which way God
[49:11] would have you to go which is the best
[49:14] way and stay with that way and so
[49:17] brother Brandon was letting us know when
[49:19] we start to do something for God evil is
[49:22] always going to be present to turn you
[49:24] around but then I love it he G gives us
[49:27] the secret how to overcome this find
[49:30] Which Way in your heart to go then you
[49:33] stick with it you see this ain't the
[49:35] time to turn around and say devil you
[49:37] won this ain't the time to turn around
[49:39] and say circumstances you won this is
[49:42] the time to find an anchor for the heart
[49:45] and keep pressing on and be stable in
[49:48] what God has done for us in this
[49:51] generation and I believe if that the
[49:53] people would find the will of God for
[49:55] their lives there would be more people
[49:57] stable you know there would be more
[49:59] people that that that wasn't backbiting
[50:01] cure talking about that one you know
[50:03] there wouldn't be as many insecurities
[50:05] and complexes cuz if you find who you
[50:08] are where you're going what you're doing
[50:11] you get stable you don't care what that
[50:13] one's doing how great of a job that one
[50:15] is doing how much this one's going how
[50:17] how that one's prospering what about you
[50:20] it don't matter about that one it don't
[50:21] matter about your neighbor it don't
[50:23] matter about the preacher what are you
[50:25] doing for the Lord what is the will of
[50:27] God for your life you see young people
[50:30] can be so stable in the will of God that
[50:33] when the devil does come with
[50:35] insecurities you say oh no devil I'm
[50:37] stable on what God has chosen me to do
[50:41] you see you might not be called to be a
[50:43] preacher but if you're called to be in a
[50:45] manner be stable in that if go maybe God
[50:48] hasn't called you to be a deacon but if
[50:50] God has called you to be a husband be
[50:52] stable in what God has called you to do
[50:55] cuz that's where the blessings of God
[50:57] are going to fall is where God has
[50:59] called you to be you see if you get out
[51:01] of your position the blessings of God
[51:04] are not going to fall in your life but
[51:06] if you stay where God has placed you and
[51:09] where God has called you to be that's
[51:11] where the blessings of God are going to
[51:13] fall you remember the missionary that
[51:15] that felt led to go to Africa I believe
[51:17] and he would come before the missionary
[51:19] board and would say I feel led to do
[51:21] this and take my family with me and the
[51:23] board would say there's no way you know
[51:25] they have that AR is over there they
[51:27] have this illness over there that this
[51:29] disease you're taking your family with
[51:31] you they would say you're crazy and what
[51:34] would the missionary say he says well
[51:36] God has told me to go and we're safer
[51:39] there than we are here he had found the
[51:41] will of God for his life and he knew it
[51:45] did not matter the opposition that came
[51:48] against him he was stable and what God
[51:51] had chose him to do oh little church
[51:53] tonight we can be so stable in what God
[51:56] has chose us to do that when the storms
[51:58] come it does not bother us when
[52:00] circumstance come it does not bother us
[52:03] cuz we're
[52:04] stabilized oh Hallelujah that's why we
[52:07] can't be ruled by emotions if you're
[52:09] walking by your emotions you're never
[52:11] stable so you can be up today down
[52:13] tomorrow and then you never know what
[52:15] the will of God is you know if you're
[52:17] walking by emotions whenever you're up
[52:19] on a spiritual High man the Lord is with
[52:21] me but what about tomorrow when you
[52:24] don't got the emotions when you don't
[52:25] feel like a Christian where's your
[52:27] stability at I don't believe your
[52:29] stability is in emotions your stability
[52:33] is in the will of God that has been
[52:35] delivered in this generation oh you may
[52:38] say what are you talking about brother
[52:40] Josh I believe this a message has showed
[52:43] us what we are to be in this generation
[52:46] you might not be a preacher but you
[52:47] might be a prayer Warrior and it lets
[52:49] you know wherever you are abide in the
[52:52] calling that God has put inside of your
[52:54] life oh Hallelujah
[52:57] and we would see that with the
[52:58] missionary had made no sense with the
[53:00] missionary board that he was to go but
[53:03] he found the will of God and it might
[53:05] not make sense the direction that you're
[53:07] going to many people but if it is the
[53:09] will of God stick with him and we would
[53:12] see that it was the will of God for
[53:14] Jesus you know to rise up upon the third
[53:16] day and we would and we would look at
[53:18] the story and how he was dead for three
[53:20] days corruption was about to come and
[53:23] and everything like that but it was
[53:25] already prophesied that he was to raise
[53:27] up again and what is so incredible that
[53:30] it was already prophesied that not one
[53:33] bone would be broken in Jesus body right
[53:35] and here would come the soldiers when he
[53:38] was upon the cross they would break the
[53:40] would break this thief's leg they would
[53:42] break this one's leg but then they would
[53:43] come to Jesus and could not break his
[53:46] leg but then they would stab him with a
[53:47] spear right because it was already
[53:50] prophesied the will of God was for none
[53:52] of his bones to be broken so that is the
[53:55] authority
[53:57] of the will of God over every one of our
[53:59] Lives if we just submit oursel to what
[54:02] God has chosen us to do no weapon formed
[54:05] against you shall prosper that's where
[54:08] the blessings of God are oh Hallelujah
[54:11] that's where the blessings of God are is
[54:13] where God has chosen you to be and we
[54:16] would see that job was constantly
[54:18] pointing to the will of God you know
[54:20] there in job 23:10 but he knoweth the
[54:22] way that I take and when he have tried
[54:25] me I shall come forth has gold here all
[54:28] hell was turned loose upon job and all
[54:31] he would say was he knoweth the way that
[54:34] I take you see what stability is he did
[54:37] he have there he knoweth the way that I
[54:40] take and he would say when he had tried
[54:42] me and what I love about job's
[54:44] confession is is when he had tried me I
[54:46] shall come forth as gold and so while he
[54:49] was sitting there in the fire his eyes
[54:52] wasn't upon the fire his eyes was upon
[54:55] the finished Pro
[54:57] what is this fire going to do for me you
[54:59] see I don't believe we go through trials
[55:02] without it being appointed for us we go
[55:05] through things and it's leading us to
[55:07] the the the the purpose of God that he
[55:10] has for our life and here job was saying
[55:12] when I am tried I shall come forth has
[55:16] gold he was looking at the will of God
[55:18] and that nothing happens by accident he
[55:21] would say in job 23 and4 for he
[55:25] performeth the thing that is appointed
[55:27] for me he
[55:30] performthe would know that he was not on
[55:33] Earth by accident but he was on Earth
[55:36] for an appointed season for a very a
[55:39] specific reason and he performthe
[55:42] appointed thing for me and that is
[55:45] something we can all take courage in
[55:47] that we're not here by accident and if
[55:49] we are here we are here to perform a
[55:53] special task and we're not the one
[55:55] performing it he's the one performing
[55:57] him we're just surrendering oursel to
[56:00] what God has called us to be and he is
[56:03] the one performing the miracle in every
[56:05] one of our Lives oh Hallelujah and you
[56:08] know and here here Hebrews 10:36 the
[56:11] Apostle Paul would say for ye have need
[56:14] of patience that after you have done the
[56:16] will of God you might receive the
[56:18] promise so it was after sticking with
[56:21] the will of God that the promise can be
[56:24] fulfilled oh and every one of us has
[56:26] promises concerning our lives but how do
[56:29] we achieve those promises by sticking
[56:32] with the will of God you see many times
[56:35] it looks glamorous looking across the
[56:37] road and brother the brandom would tell
[56:38] us the grass is always greener on the
[56:40] other side of the fence right it's
[56:42] always easier sitting here and looking
[56:44] over there saying man I wish I was there
[56:46] that's where God is oh man this is
[56:48] taking place over here that one's taking
[56:51] place over there and you're failing to
[56:52] see this if this is where God has placed
[56:55] you this is is where your promise is
[56:58] this is where your inheritance is this
[57:00] is where your stability is if this is
[57:03] where God has placed
[57:04] you oh Hallelujah and you see the the
[57:08] the Bible would say in 1 Thessalonians 3
[57:10] and 2 and S timoth this our brother and
[57:13] minister of God our fellow labor in the
[57:16] gospel of Christ to establish you and to
[57:20] comfort you concerning your faith that
[57:23] no man should be moved by these
[57:25] afflictions for yourselves know that we
[57:28] are appointed there unto to establish
[57:31] you what were they establishing this
[57:33] church in the will of God they were
[57:36] bringing the gospel of Christ and saying
[57:39] this is going to establish you and
[57:41] comfort your faith oh and and can you
[57:44] imagine maybe maybe some of these church
[57:46] members had been going through a hard
[57:48] time maybe they had been hitting stone
[57:50] wall at the stone wall they don't feel
[57:52] like God's answering their prayers then
[57:54] all of a sudden here comes a preacher
[57:55] saying I'm coming with the gospel of
[57:57] Christ to comfort your faith and maybe
[58:00] your faith feels a little bit weak this
[58:03] evening maybe you've gone through some
[58:04] trials this week you don't know if you
[58:06] can take another step but let me Comfort
[58:09] your faith that there is a will for
[58:11] everyone of your lives and only one
[58:14] person can perform that will and that is
[58:17] you your neighbor can accomplish the
[58:19] will your sister can accomplish the will
[58:21] only you can accomplish the will of God
[58:24] for your life Hallelujah and that no man
[58:28] should be moved by these afflictions oh
[58:30] ain't that ain't that powerful no man
[58:32] should be moved and so the Apostle Paul
[58:35] wasn't saying that that that that the
[58:37] strengthening of your faith was going to
[58:39] keep the afflictions away but he was
[58:41] saying when the afflictions come you
[58:44] shall not be moved by it the Apostle
[58:46] Paul would say in one place none of
[58:48] these things moved me but the brand
[58:50] would say he was harnessed to the will
[58:52] of God but the Apostle Paul would say I
[58:54] was not disobedient to the heavenly
[58:56] vision how come he was not disobedient
[58:59] to it he was tied to it you see if if
[59:02] you're tied to something you can only do
[59:04] the will of the one you're tied to right
[59:07] you remember whenever Jesus would tell
[59:08] the disciples go into the City and
[59:11] you're going to find a donkey right and
[59:12] he's going to be tied up and if anybody
[59:15] asks you what is the purpose of it tell
[59:17] him I sent you and go untie it and you
[59:20] would notice that before the donkey
[59:23] could perform the will of Jesus it to be
[59:26] untied so in other words if you're tied
[59:29] to something you cannot perform another
[59:32] task and if you're tied to the will of
[59:34] God the devil can come with his will
[59:38] with his purpose with his goals and
[59:41] achievements but if you are tied to the
[59:43] will of God there's no Direction you're
[59:46] going to go but the path of God that he
[59:49] has for your life and let me say this
[59:52] evening be harnessed to the will of God
[59:55] that no matter what comes against you
[59:57] nothing moves me the Apostle Paul would
[59:59] say it none of these things moved me I'm
[1:00:02] harnessed to one thing that is the will
[1:00:04] of God oh Hallelujah you see if you're
[1:00:08] tied to something you can't be led to
[1:00:11] another direction and you would see that
[1:00:13] the Apostle Paul would say who shall
[1:00:15] separate us from the love of God and
[1:00:18] that is a powerful statement because he
[1:00:19] would continue on and would say your
[1:00:21] tribulation or distress or persecution
[1:00:25] or famine or nness Pearl or sword as it
[1:00:28] is written for thy sake we are killed
[1:00:30] all the day long we are counted as sheep
[1:00:33] for the slaughter nay in all of these
[1:00:36] things we are more than conquerors
[1:00:38] through him that loved us and so here
[1:00:41] the Apostle Paul would say nothing shall
[1:00:44] separate us from the love of God so the
[1:00:46] very thing he was tied to nothing could
[1:00:49] separate him from and what is so
[1:00:51] powerful and then he would say we're
[1:00:53] more than conquerors through him that
[1:00:56] loved us so the very thing he was tied
[1:00:59] to was strengthening him to go through
[1:01:02] the persecutions he was going through oh
[1:01:05] and the will of God for your life once
[1:01:07] you're tied to it nothing can separate
[1:01:10] you from it and that is the very
[1:01:12] strength that you need to go through the
[1:01:15] hard times that you go through oh we see
[1:01:17] if if you know the will of God for your
[1:01:19] life is a Rapture there's nothing that
[1:01:22] the doubts can do to keep you out of it
[1:01:24] you're tied to it right and so that is
[1:01:27] the very strength that you need to press
[1:01:30] on you see if you knew you know if you
[1:01:33] had a vision that that that you're going
[1:01:35] to go on a trip tomorrow and you almost
[1:01:37] get in a wreck you know and you know
[1:01:39] that you don't get in the wreck that
[1:01:40] that God keeps you from keeps you from
[1:01:42] getting in the accident when you're
[1:01:44] driving down the road you may know that
[1:01:46] there's going to be almost a collision
[1:01:48] take place but God already showed you
[1:01:51] that you're going to make it through it
[1:01:52] what was like the Apostle Paul whenever
[1:01:54] the Lord would tell him he was to stand
[1:01:56] before the king of Gus I believe and
[1:01:59] when they were in the Shipwreck
[1:02:00] everybody thought they were going to die
[1:02:02] the Apostle Paul says not no not one man
[1:02:05] is going to die if you stick with the
[1:02:07] ship right in other words if you stay in
[1:02:09] the will of God your life is going to be
[1:02:12] spared how come he knew that he was
[1:02:15] going to survive God already showed him
[1:02:18] he was to stand before the king of gpus
[1:02:21] and let me tell you this God has showed
[1:02:23] us in this generation when the prophet
[1:02:26] went beyond the curtain of time he would
[1:02:28] say I saw you there that is a stability
[1:02:32] we can anchor in our life that no matter
[1:02:35] what we go through there's already a
[1:02:37] vision concerning my
[1:02:40] life oh Hallelujah you see we're not
[1:02:43] walking by emotions we're walking by a
[1:02:45] vision that God has given us in this
[1:02:48] generation but we would see that that if
[1:02:50] you if you if you if you find the will
[1:02:52] of God for your life then there's a risk
[1:02:55] that that we can abide him and brother
[1:02:57] Brandon would tell us excuse me he would
[1:03:00] say the great miracle of Noah's day was
[1:03:03] Noah being tucked away in the ark when
[1:03:05] the rain fell ain't that a that a
[1:03:08] powerful thing the great miracle wasn't
[1:03:10] necessarily the boat the great miracle
[1:03:13] was Noah being tucked away in the boat
[1:03:16] you know him having enough confidence in
[1:03:18] what God showed him that he could rest
[1:03:22] he could be he he could be stabilized
[1:03:24] when the rain start to fall that's what
[1:03:27] the great great miracle was was Noah
[1:03:30] resting in the ark and that is the
[1:03:32] greatest miracle today is people being
[1:03:34] able to rest we're living in the day
[1:03:37] where man people are out of their minds
[1:03:38] there's anxieties complexes
[1:03:41] insecurities it's the greatest battle
[1:03:43] ever fought but there are Miracles
[1:03:45] taking place there are people resting in
[1:03:48] the will of God for their life you know
[1:03:51] brother the Brandon would tell us that
[1:03:52] the a Christian experience or the
[1:03:54] Christian experence erience is based
[1:03:57] solemnly upon rest he says you're tossed
[1:04:00] to and fro until you come to Christ and
[1:04:03] then he says then it's all finished
[1:04:05] we're resting in Christ and so we're
[1:04:08] tossed to and fro until we are until we
[1:04:11] come to Christ then we are resting and
[1:04:15] you see this ain't the time to tuck tail
[1:04:17] and run this is the time to stand where
[1:04:20] God has placed us you know and brother
[1:04:21] Brandon would say in one place when you
[1:04:24] find the will of God he said says don't
[1:04:26] let nobody talk you out of the will of
[1:04:28] God he would say would talk about balam
[1:04:30] and would say balam would know the will
[1:04:32] of God but then would let the king talk
[1:04:34] him out of him so it ain't that this
[1:04:36] ain't time to be talked out of the will
[1:04:38] of God for our lives you know brother
[1:04:41] Brandon would talk about George
[1:04:42] Washington and would say George
[1:04:44] Washington would stay on his knees till
[1:04:46] he found the will of God he would sit
[1:04:48] there we know the famous painting of him
[1:04:50] in the snow he says he stayed there in
[1:04:53] snow all the way up to his waste and so
[1:04:56] he got an answer from God that he was to
[1:04:58] be Victorious and so whenever he got up
[1:05:01] off his knees he was walking by a vision
[1:05:04] then he knew that God already promised
[1:05:07] him the victory so when he went across
[1:05:09] that River and bullets were going
[1:05:11] through his coold he had a promise that
[1:05:14] he was in the will of God so it did not
[1:05:16] matter the opposition that was coming
[1:05:19] against him he was in the will of God
[1:05:22] and if you find it don't let nobody talk
[1:05:24] you out of it for your life Hallelujah
[1:05:28] and we would see that Paul the Apostle
[1:05:30] Paul would say prove all things and hold
[1:05:33] fast to them which is good so don't hold
[1:05:36] fast to everything but prove it you see
[1:05:39] you want to find the will of God for
[1:05:40] your life make sure it lines up with
[1:05:42] scripture come on now make sure it lines
[1:05:45] up with the message of the hour you see
[1:05:47] I'm not one that believes well I'm not
[1:05:49] one that believes if God tells you
[1:05:51] something and it don't line up with the
[1:05:53] scripture is it from God come on now you
[1:05:56] got to make sure the will of God that is
[1:05:58] coming to you is from God the Apostle
[1:06:01] Paul would say if an angel if me if
[1:06:03] anybody else comes and tells you
[1:06:05] anything than what I've already told you
[1:06:07] right let him be a curse don't listen to
[1:06:09] it so before you know the will of God
[1:06:12] you got to make sure it lines up with
[1:06:14] the scripture with the message of the
[1:06:16] hour prove all things then hold fast to
[1:06:20] them which is good so if you proven that
[1:06:24] you have the will of God hold fast to it
[1:06:27] don't let go of it when the first win
[1:06:29] comes when the first credit comes but
[1:06:32] hold fast to it and say this is where
[1:06:34] God has placed me oh Hallelujah you see
[1:06:39] brother the Brandon going talk about
[1:06:40] Jehoshaphat and the nation of Judah and
[1:06:43] would say Jehoshaphat was a righteous
[1:06:45] man and you know he would say that he
[1:06:47] was serving the lord by the best of his
[1:06:49] ability he was doing the best that he
[1:06:52] knew to do and what would happen the
[1:06:54] moabites would come against the nation
[1:06:56] of Judah right and but the Brandon would
[1:06:58] tell us that the people were all afraid
[1:07:01] they were in TMO they were running every
[1:07:03] different direction and then the Lord
[1:07:05] would speak to Jehoshaphat and would say
[1:07:08] stand still right and see the salvation
[1:07:11] of the Lord and you know what brother
[1:07:12] Brandon would say brother Brandon would
[1:07:14] say as long as they were together and
[1:07:17] praying it was God's battle ain't that
[1:07:20] powerful as long as they were together
[1:07:23] you see whenever troubles come come to
[1:07:25] the church that ain't time to be divided
[1:07:28] oh I'm preaching now whenever
[1:07:30] tribulation comes against the church
[1:07:32] whenever trials comes and and turmoils
[1:07:35] come that ain't the time to TU tuck tail
[1:07:37] and stay home from church and and stay
[1:07:39] home and andore phone calls and ignore
[1:07:42] text that is the time to come together
[1:07:44] so God can fight the battle as long as
[1:07:47] you're divided you're trying to fight it
[1:07:50] and you're not going to get Victory but
[1:07:51] this ain't the time to be divided let
[1:07:54] Trials come let WI blow against this
[1:07:56] church but if this is the will of God
[1:07:58] for you to be here come together in one
[1:08:01] Accord and let the fire of God fall like
[1:08:05] never before it was the 120 that was in
[1:08:08] the upper room in one Accord come on now
[1:08:12] in one Accord and that's when the
[1:08:15] Revival fell down you want to see a
[1:08:17] Revival like never before get rid of all
[1:08:20] the division get rid of all the
[1:08:21] backbiting get rid of all the naysaying
[1:08:24] get rid of all the gossip sessions and
[1:08:26] come together in one Accord One Vision
[1:08:29] one motive that is the will of God and
[1:08:32] you'll see the blessings of God fall
[1:08:35] like never
[1:08:36] before you see I'm not one that believes
[1:08:39] that that that God starts something and
[1:08:41] just leaves it if God started this
[1:08:43] assembly he's going to be faithful to
[1:08:46] complete it all the way to the coming of
[1:08:48] the Lord I don't believe God has done
[1:08:51] with this assembly I don't believe God
[1:08:53] has done with the families that in this
[1:08:56] assembly I don't believe God is done
[1:08:58] with those Ministries if God has placed
[1:09:00] you here God is going to continue to
[1:09:03] bless the will for this
[1:09:06] church but he needs some people that's
[1:09:08] stable in it come on he need somebody
[1:09:12] that says wow this is where you placed
[1:09:14] me I'm going to be stabilized it don't
[1:09:17] matter what comes and goes what what
[1:09:19] that one says this is where the
[1:09:21] blessings are for me it might not be for
[1:09:24] you but it is for me
[1:09:26] right oh you see that's what our
[1:09:28] confession should be if somebody comes
[1:09:30] up to you and says you know what this
[1:09:31] one says I your church believes this way
[1:09:34] you know this one says this well it
[1:09:36] might not be for you but it's for me yes
[1:09:38] sir it might not be feeding you but I'm
[1:09:40] sure it's feeding
[1:09:41] me anyways that was free but you see
[1:09:44] it's troubles that is trying to break up
[1:09:47] the will of God but God would tell
[1:09:49] Jehosaphat stand still stand still quit
[1:09:52] running to and fro stand still then
[1:09:55] you'll see the salvation of the Lord and
[1:09:58] you would see that it's fear many times
[1:10:00] it's fear that tries to break up the
[1:10:02] will of God you know brother brandom
[1:10:04] would talk about Peter and would say
[1:10:06] when he walked upon the Water to Jesus
[1:10:08] brother brandom says he walked on
[1:10:10] substance right and you know what's so
[1:10:12] incredible is what would Peter first say
[1:10:15] he would look out and would say Jesus if
[1:10:18] that is you bid me to come right so
[1:10:22] Peter wanted to make sure it was Jesus
[1:10:25] called in him right cuz that really
[1:10:27] spoke to my heart because could you
[1:10:29] imagine being Peter if that wasn't Jesus
[1:10:32] you're going to walk out and go boom
[1:10:34] right but if it is Jesus and he is
[1:10:37] calling me the Supernatural is going to
[1:10:40] be there you see that's why it's so
[1:10:43] important to make sure you're following
[1:10:45] the will of God because you're going to
[1:10:47] be like Peter if it ain't the will of
[1:10:49] God you're going to step out and sink
[1:10:52] right you're going to go through a drown
[1:10:53] you know any and what is so incredible
[1:10:57] is brother brandom says he was walking
[1:10:59] on substance and he says his substance
[1:11:02] would have led him straight to Jesus but
[1:11:04] what happened fear ain't been incredible
[1:11:07] that he started to look at the waves and
[1:11:10] as he looked at the waves but the
[1:11:12] brandom says what he feared Came Upon
[1:11:14] him so as he started to doubt what Jesus
[1:11:18] told him to do he lost the very
[1:11:21] substance oh you know what brother
[1:11:23] Brandon would say brother Brandon would
[1:11:24] say he professed his faith but had no
[1:11:28] substance that's where the church world
[1:11:30] is at today everybody's Christians
[1:11:33] everybody believes in a God but where's
[1:11:35] the substance where where's the reality
[1:11:39] of the Gospel where's the reality of
[1:11:42] this message we don't want professors we
[1:11:44] want somebody that's got substance and
[1:11:47] the only way you can have substance is
[1:11:49] in the will of God brother Brandon which
[1:11:52] would quote job and job would say what I
[1:11:54] have feared had has come upon me and so
[1:11:57] fear tries to take you out of the will
[1:11:59] of God you know and many times the Devil
[1:12:01] comes with fear and says you have to
[1:12:03] fear God how many's ever heard that I've
[1:12:06] heard it you you you're afraid if you
[1:12:07] make a mistake well God's not going to
[1:12:09] forgive me if you if you stumble and
[1:12:12] fall you're going to send your day of
[1:12:13] Grace away that's fear and you know
[1:12:15] there's a difference between the fear of
[1:12:17] the Lord and the fear of Satan because
[1:12:19] the Bible says we got to fear the lord
[1:12:22] and brother Brandon would tell us that
[1:12:23] the fear of the Lord is not being afraid
[1:12:26] of God it's reverencing God so there's a
[1:12:29] difference between being afraid and the
[1:12:32] fear of God you see the Devil comes with
[1:12:35] fear to get you to be afraid that when
[1:12:37] you do make a mistake you you you you
[1:12:40] don't think you God can pick you up you
[1:12:42] know you make a mistake and instead of
[1:12:44] turning to God for forgiveness you go
[1:12:46] the other direction right and what that
[1:12:48] does is that takes away your substance
[1:12:51] and you can't fight the Devil Without
[1:12:53] substance fa is the substance the
[1:12:56] evidence of Things Not Seen and so
[1:12:58] without substance how are you going to
[1:13:00] overcome the
[1:13:02] devil come on now you see if I was
[1:13:05] scared of Mark and I was afraid that he
[1:13:07] can whip me and we got into an argument
[1:13:10] and things started to get heated and I
[1:13:12] knew he could take me I'm going to back
[1:13:14] down right if I knew he was about to
[1:13:17] whip me if I said another thing I'm
[1:13:19] going to back down you win and that's
[1:13:21] what happens many times in the house of
[1:13:24] God we we lose our substance because of
[1:13:27] fear and whenever spirits come against
[1:13:29] the home we've got no strength to push
[1:13:32] it back so we step back and let this
[1:13:35] come in we step back and let that come
[1:13:37] in we step back we allow spirits to come
[1:13:40] into our home we allow spirits to come
[1:13:43] into our family we allow spirits to come
[1:13:45] into the church but this ain't time to
[1:13:48] be governed by by fear this is the time
[1:13:51] to grab faith in the will of God and see
[1:13:54] every Spirit has no right in my home has
[1:13:57] no right in my mind has no rights in my
[1:14:01] family in this
[1:14:03] church oh this ain't the time to give up
[1:14:06] and give in and play dead with the devil
[1:14:08] and say come on in this is the time to
[1:14:10] say greater is he that is in me we're
[1:14:13] more than conquerors through him that
[1:14:16] loves us I'm not backing down I'm
[1:14:19] standing
[1:14:20] forward oh you remember the dream of the
[1:14:22] preacher would have right and he was in
[1:14:25] this tram there would come a devil and
[1:14:27] he would say boo and he would jump back
[1:14:29] he would get smaller the devil would get
[1:14:31] bigger right and this happened Time
[1:14:34] After Time After Time and he would find
[1:14:37] a Bible I believe and would grab the
[1:14:39] Bible and would say boo the devil jumped
[1:14:42] back and got smaller he got bigger right
[1:14:46] you see it's time that we throw out the
[1:14:48] the the the defensive mindset of just if
[1:14:51] I step back you have a little bit of
[1:14:52] ground I step back you have a little bit
[1:14:54] of ground and that's not the way it
[1:14:56] works it's time to grab the will of God
[1:15:00] and say if God placed me here this is

[1:15:38] she would jump on top of him and would
[1:15:40] start the pray and said I give his life
[1:15:42] back but the brandom says well it wasn't
[1:15:45] his time to go then he says the life

[1:16:36] glory to God and so what's so incredible
[1:16:39] is brother Brandon would say the
[1:16:42] greatest thing that I find against the
[1:16:44] church tonight is fear everybody scared
[1:16:47] to death about something what are you
[1:16:49] scared about if a man's born again he
[1:16:52] should be happy Carefree
[1:16:55] oh man if he's born again he should be
[1:16:58] happy and carefree not not not chain
[1:17:02] down to the world not trained down to
[1:17:04] emotions but
[1:17:06] Carefree here we continue on to say just
[1:17:09] like these fellas up there singing and
[1:17:11] brother the brother testifying back
[1:17:13] there just free there ain't nothing can
[1:17:15] harm you nothing present nothing future
[1:17:19] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:17:21] God that is in Christ God has promised
[1:17:25] us it you see why why do we have to be
[1:17:29] afraid we don't got to be afraid when
[1:17:31] things come against us and you know what
[1:17:33] what another thing that that fear does
[1:17:36] Fear takes away H the personal effect of
[1:17:39] the message fear would say that yeah the
[1:17:42] message might be true but it's not for
[1:17:44] you right how many's ever heard that
[1:17:46] that's a young person I heard all the
[1:17:47] time the devil telling me and it really
[1:17:49] comes into families whenever you're a
[1:17:51] pastor son or a pastor daughter or a
[1:17:53] Deacon's child cuz you hear you you see
[1:17:56] the anointing in your family right you
[1:17:59] see man I've got I got two uncles that
[1:18:01] are pastors my grandpa was a pastor my
[1:18:03] dad's a pastor so I'm sitting here
[1:18:06] looking at the anointing flowing through
[1:18:07] all of these individuals then I make a
[1:18:10] mistake and I'm sitting there thinking
[1:18:12] man why why can't I do that why can't I
[1:18:15] achieve that why can't I why can't I do
[1:18:18] something like that it was fear and that
[1:18:20] fear was making the message
[1:18:24] through them but it can't work through
[1:18:26] me oh come on now you see brother
[1:18:29] brandom would would tell a story and and
[1:18:32] and the story would line up with with
[1:18:34] the niagar Falls story and you remember
[1:18:36] niagar Falls there was a man that would
[1:18:38] put a rope across the across STP and
[1:18:41] would walk across it youall remember
[1:18:42] that story remember that event and then
[1:18:45] the story would go that he would ask the
[1:18:47] people do you think that I can walk
[1:18:49] across this rope and come back they
[1:18:51] would all say yeah you can do it okay he
[1:18:54] would do it and they and they would say
[1:18:56] that he would actually get a stove and
[1:18:58] would fry an egg on the stove while
[1:19:01] walking across the Rope across nowar
[1:19:03] Falls ain't that incredible and
[1:19:05] everybody believed he can do it he would
[1:19:07] come back get a whe Barrel you think I
[1:19:09] can push it across oh yeah you can do it
[1:19:12] go across come back do you think I can
[1:19:14] push a person in the wheelbarrow oh yeah
[1:19:17] you can do it and they said he said okay
[1:19:20] then get in everybody says oh no they
[1:19:23] believed there could be done until it
[1:19:26] came to the end that's where the devil
[1:19:28] wants to put you with fear it can be
[1:19:30] done but not through you it's time to
[1:19:33] cast down the spirit of fear and grab a
[1:19:37] hold of the will of God in this
[1:19:39] generation and say devil not by might
[1:19:42] not by power but by my spirit saith the
[1:19:45] Lord I can't do it but the will of God
[1:19:48] is
[1:19:50] greater but the BR say in the church and
[1:19:53] you in the church you sitting here
[1:19:54] tonight oh you're struggling and
[1:19:56] struggling God's app pulling to you and
[1:19:58] showing you things if you could ever get
[1:20:01] past the sin barrier of unbelief then
[1:20:04] unlimited Revival would break out
[1:20:07] through the United States and everywhere
[1:20:10] if you can go beyond the sound barrier
[1:20:13] that the sin barrier of unbelief oh is
[1:20:16] it true does it mean me can I be healed
[1:20:19] could I be saved could I get filled with
[1:20:22] the Holy Ghost he says get Beyond want
[1:20:25] that ain't that incredible that's what
[1:20:27] feared does it can't happen to you can I
[1:20:30] be saved can I be filled with the Holy
[1:20:32] Ghost but brother brandom says once you
[1:20:34] get beyond that unlimited Revival will
[1:20:38] break out across the states but I don't
[1:20:40] believe it's going to break across the
[1:20:42] states because brother Brandon would
[1:20:43] tell us America's under judgment but the
[1:20:45] bride she's she America has missed the
[1:20:48] Awakening of the Bride but you are in
[1:20:50] the bride's Revival and so once you get
[1:20:53] past is the Bri's Revival for me then
[1:20:56] you can break into an unlimited
[1:20:59] Revival oh you can break through it you
[1:21:02] know brother the brandom would say in
[1:21:03] one place that before the before the the
[1:21:06] airplane gets past the sound barrier it
[1:21:09] says the boats feel like it's going to
[1:21:10] fall out he says the wings feel like
[1:21:12] it's going to fall out it feels like
[1:21:14] it's going to fall apart but you know
[1:21:16] what brother brandom says once it gets
[1:21:18] past its own sound then it runs at ease
[1:21:22] its own sound come on now that's where
[1:21:25] many of us fa with fear is our own sound
[1:21:29] our own insecurities our own mistakes
[1:21:32] our own failures and that sound is
[1:21:35] pushing us back from the Revival that
[1:21:38] God has for us cast out the Fear cast
[1:21:42] out your own sounds cast it out and
[1:21:45] break through into the Eternal Realms
[1:21:48] that God has for you you got to break
[1:21:51] through your own sound though what does
[1:21:53] that mean those insecurity
[1:21:55] those voices that comes and says you're
[1:21:57] not good enough you'll never amount to
[1:21:59] anything you're not worthy of it you're
[1:22:01] right you're not worthy of it but God
[1:22:03] Made You worthy of it come on now God
[1:22:06] Made You worthy God blessed you it
[1:22:09] wasn't God wasn't Mary saying God you
[1:22:11] got to choose me and I'm going to be the
[1:22:13] Virgin it was God that chose her it was
[1:22:16] the angel that says you're highly
[1:22:17] favored you're blessed among women it
[1:22:20] was it was God coming to her and
[1:22:22] revealing to her his will then all she
[1:22:25] had to do was be stable in it how should
[1:22:29] it be I know not no man and what is so
[1:22:31] incredible is the message of Gabriel had
[1:22:34] all the answers here she would say how
[1:22:37] would this be I know not no man then the
[1:22:39] message would say the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:41] going to overshadow you you don't have
[1:22:43] to do anything why would she say be it
[1:22:46] unto me according to Thy word thy will
[1:22:51] hallelujah it's not you trying to
[1:22:53] perform it you're surrendering yourself
[1:22:56] to what God's given
[1:22:58] you Hallelujah and you sh with the brown
[1:23:01] I'm going tell us the biggest curse on
[1:23:03] people is the fear he says God has given
[1:23:06] you he made the provision for everything
[1:23:09] you have need of but you're afraid to
[1:23:10] take him out's word and what's so
[1:23:13] incredible you remember Elijah and I
[1:23:15] won't hold you too very long tonight but
[1:23:18] you remember Elijah here Elijah was was
[1:23:20] going through some things he was there
[1:23:22] up in in the cave right and and why
[1:23:24] would he say he would he would be
[1:23:26] complaining to God and would say God
[1:23:29] they have tore down your altars right
[1:23:31] they have killed all of your prophets
[1:23:33] I'm the only one that is left and what's
[1:23:37] incredible is he's complaining to God
[1:23:40] and what would God say there's still
[1:23:42] 7,000 that has not bow their knee to
[1:23:45] bail here he was sitting in a state I'm
[1:23:49] by myself nobody understands I'm not
[1:23:52] going to make it there's no Supernatural
[1:23:54] here and your God is said what you
[1:23:56] talking about man I still got a Remnant
[1:23:59] I still got 7,000 that is still
[1:24:02] stabilized and the devil likes to come
[1:24:05] and says this one's falling away that
[1:24:07] one's falling away that one's doubting
[1:24:09] this one's doing this let them do what
[1:24:11] they want to if they want to go out
[1:24:14] there and paint the town red let them do
[1:24:16] it but it's for me in my house I'm going
[1:24:19] to serve the Lord Elijah is saying I'm
[1:24:22] by myself but God says what are you
[1:24:23] looking at
[1:24:24] I'm looking at the bigger purpose you
[1:24:27] got to look at the will of God for your
[1:24:29] life quit looking at what's around you
[1:24:31] quit looking at the situations and look
[1:24:34] at the way God's looking at it the way
[1:24:37] Elijah was looking at it was different
[1:24:39] than the way God was looking at him you
[1:24:41] remember Gideon the Bible says an angel
[1:24:44] would come to Gideon and would say
[1:24:46] you're a mighty man of Valor you
[1:24:47] remember that and what would Gideon say
[1:24:50] I'm based in my father's house and my
[1:24:53] father's house is poor right and what
[1:24:55] does what is the definition of the word
[1:24:57] Valor is wealthy so here comes an angel
[1:25:00] from God saying you're a mighty man of
[1:25:03] wealth and he looks and says I'm poor
[1:25:05] I'm the least in my father's house he
[1:25:08] was looking at himself differently than
[1:25:10] the way God was looking at him you got
[1:25:13] to look at yourself the way God sees you
[1:25:15] God don't look at you as a tribulation
[1:25:18] Saint God looks at you as his bride God
[1:25:21] don't look at you as serpent seed he
[1:25:24] looks at you as his bride so you got to
[1:25:27] change your perspective in the way God
[1:25:30] looks at you come on now you remember
[1:25:32] brother brownon would say the the the
[1:25:34] Pharaoh would look out the window and
[1:25:36] would see mud dobers would see slaves
[1:25:38] right and he says Moses looked at it and
[1:25:41] seen a victory he seen a promise they
[1:25:44] were looking at the same things but
[1:25:46] different perspectives come on sometimes
[1:25:49] we got to change the way we look at
[1:25:51] things come on the situation that you
[1:25:54] think is going to take you down has no
[1:25:56] authority over you unless you give it to
[1:25:58] it come on now you see there's a rest
[1:26:03] that we can be in you see and brother
[1:26:05] Brandon would tell us that we're Triune
[1:26:07] being right and what is so
[1:26:10] incredible is brother brownon would talk
[1:26:12] about job and would say that job was a
[1:26:14] man of inspiration and this really spoke
[1:26:17] to me as a preacher and I know everybody
[1:26:19] can relate to this he would say that job
[1:26:22] was a man of inspiration and he would
[1:26:24] see everybody would come to job and ask
[1:26:27] job what is the will of God for my life
[1:26:29] what what does the Lord want to say to
[1:26:30] me every time they needed an answer they
[1:26:33] came to job but what would happen while
[1:26:36] he's on his Ash sheep but the brandom
[1:26:38] says he had no
[1:26:40] inspiration ain't that just just just it
[1:26:42] it it really it really done something to
[1:26:44] me but the Brandon then would say that
[1:26:47] the Vindication that Noah or that Jo job
[1:26:50] was a servant of God was his inspiration
[1:26:53] so here he is sitting a man of God being
[1:26:56] used but now the Chanel of God is
[1:26:59] working through him closes up could you
[1:27:01] imagine the Mind battles right God's
[1:27:03] working through me here and God's a it's
[1:27:05] a powerful Ministry a powerful gift a
[1:27:08] powerful thing all of a sudden it closes
[1:27:10] up and you're sitting there all by
[1:27:11] yourself you get no answer from God but
[1:27:14] the brandom says that all those friends
[1:27:16] that would come to him for inspiration
[1:27:18] all left him so now everybody that came
[1:27:21] to him because of his gift is now gone
[1:27:25] and he's sitting there and brother
[1:27:26] Brandon would say this and man this
[1:27:28] really struck me he would say he wanted
[1:27:30] to see if there was somebody who could
[1:27:33] intercede for him he had interceded for
[1:27:36] so many people but now is there somebody
[1:27:39] that could speak for him could there be
[1:27:41] somebody put his hand on job a sinful
[1:27:44] man and a holy God and make a bridge the
[1:27:47] way could he go to his house and knock
[1:27:50] on the door would he open the door and
[1:27:52] talk a minute ain't that that the agony
[1:27:55] of job and the the Bible would tell us
[1:27:57] that job was looking for God oh if I
[1:27:59] could just find God I I would sit down
[1:28:01] and talk with him I would relay my heart
[1:28:04] if I could just find him but the brandom
[1:28:06] says he's wanting somebody to intercede
[1:28:09] for him and man that hit me between the
[1:28:11] eyes as a minister you know what youall
[1:28:13] know what it's like whenever you get
[1:28:15] behind the pull pit you there's there's
[1:28:17] an anointing you're breaking away for
[1:28:19] people to get Victory you you're
[1:28:21] breaking channels open you see Victory
[1:28:23] falling but but then all of a sudden you
[1:28:25] go home and the anointing wears off the
[1:28:27] anointing goes off of you you're laying
[1:28:29] in your bed saying my goodness what did
[1:28:31] I do wrong here the spirits come against
[1:28:33] your mind here you just made a way for
[1:28:35] somebody else but now you can't get a
[1:28:37] breakthrough mothers feel that way when
[1:28:40] you you you're the one that does the
[1:28:41] laundry for the children cook supper for
[1:28:44] for the family you're making sure the
[1:28:46] house is cleaned and prepared but who's
[1:28:49] going to intercede for you right daddy
[1:28:51] you go to work you you you you make sure
[1:28:54] there's food on the table you make sure
[1:28:56] there's gas in the cars you make sure
[1:28:58] there's electricity in the home but what
[1:29:00] about you who's going to intercede for
[1:29:03] you and here's where here's where job
[1:29:05] was if I could just find him if I could
[1:29:08] just find him I would relay my heart oh
[1:29:12] man and that really hit me if we could
[1:29:14] just find him we get to that place many
[1:29:16] times that's when you need to know
[1:29:19] you're in the will of God when you can't
[1:29:22] see him when you can't hear hear him
[1:29:24] when you can't feel him there's only one
[1:29:27] thing you can hang on to I'm in the will
[1:29:30] of God job was saying if I could just
[1:29:33] find him but he performeth the way I
[1:29:36] take he I have not I'm not I'm not under
[1:29:39] judgment right now I've walked in his
[1:29:41] footsteps his words have constantly been
[1:29:43] on my mouth yeah he does he's doing
[1:29:47] these things for me I don't know why I'm
[1:29:49] here but I'm in the will of God I can't
[1:29:52] find him but I know know I'm right where
[1:29:54] he wants me to be maybe you're there
[1:29:57] tonight maybe you feel like you've hit
[1:29:59] rock bottom but just make sure you know
[1:30:02] you're in the will of God and if you are
[1:30:04] in the will of God don't give up come on
[1:30:07] now don't give up don't back down don't
[1:30:09] turn around but keep going
[1:30:12] forward He Man we've been there we me
[1:30:14] and my wife's been there you know we've
[1:30:16] recently went full-time in the ministry
[1:30:18] and man all hell has turned loose upon
[1:30:21] it man we're driving down the road a
[1:30:23] rock up cracks her windshield okay we
[1:30:26] get to our hotel room we get up the next
[1:30:29] morning ant are inside of our car I've
[1:30:32] never even heard of that happening
[1:30:33] before ants all in the car our heater
[1:30:36] goes out our our furnace goes out our
[1:30:38] hot water heater goes out my truck
[1:30:40] breaks down all this happens since we
[1:30:42] made the decision to go full time and so
[1:30:45] we're sitting there did we do something
[1:30:46] wrong right did did we make the wrong
[1:30:48] decision and then here I'm studying on
[1:30:51] these things and I read that job says
[1:30:53] I'm in the will of God I'm my my his
[1:30:56] words are being on my lips and I said
[1:30:58] devil back up we're in the will of God
[1:31:01] and you can say that ton not devil back
[1:31:03] up I'm in the will of God I might not
[1:31:06] understand why I'm going through it but
[1:31:09] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail I'm
[1:31:11] going through it I'm in the will of God
[1:31:14] for my
[1:31:15] life you're stable there's a
[1:31:19] stability you're
[1:31:22] stabilized Hallelujah Hallelujah and
[1:31:25] here job you know it was it's so
[1:31:28] incredible because here James would say
[1:31:29] look at the patience of Job look at the
[1:31:32] patience like and you would thank job if
[1:31:34] he would hear that say patience what do
[1:31:36] you mean patience I was sitting there
[1:31:39] saying God if you forsaken me you know
[1:31:42] God where are you God if I could find
[1:31:44] you I would relay my heart but you know
[1:31:46] that word patience in the Greek means
[1:31:49] perseverance steadfast enduring so James
[1:31:53] says look at the steadfastness of
[1:31:56] job even when he was on Rock Bottom he
[1:32:00] was steadfast oh and may that be the
[1:32:03] testimony for my life may that be the
[1:32:05] testimony for your life you might hit
[1:32:08] rock bottom but you're still patient
[1:32:11] you're still enduring you're still
[1:32:13] steadfastness and you would see that
[1:32:16] that that faith and patience work hand
[1:32:18] in hand the Apostle Paul would say in
[1:32:20] Hebrews 6:12 that ye be not slothful but
[1:32:23] followers of them who through faith and
[1:32:26] patience inherit the promises and
[1:32:29] brother Brandon would say only through
[1:32:31] patience do our souls get life only
[1:32:34] through patience only through
[1:32:36] steadfastness only through endurance
[1:32:38] brother Brandon would tell us that that
[1:32:40] there there were two two phases the
[1:32:42] Christianity youall remember that and he
[1:32:44] would say the first one is is an
[1:32:46] intellectual or mental conception of God
[1:32:49] he says Where It's just in the mind and
[1:32:51] he says then there's a second phase
[1:32:53] which which is an experimental Faith
[1:32:55] right and he says you've tasted you've
[1:32:57] experienced God and he says that's those
[1:33:00] two phases and he says the first phase
[1:33:02] the first guy is hungry all the time he
[1:33:05] says he eats off the things of God but
[1:33:07] his Feast does not last out but he says
[1:33:10] the second one he says looks like
[1:33:12] nothing bothers him and I thought my
[1:33:14] goodness and if you if you continue on
[1:33:16] in the quote he says the other one seems
[1:33:18] to have Victory all the time there's
[1:33:20] nothing bothers them they're just as
[1:33:23] solid and anchored as they can be no
[1:33:25] trials no storms bothers them at all and
[1:33:29] I thought okay there's still storms
[1:33:31] there's still trials but it don't bother
[1:33:33] them you see there's a difference you're
[1:33:36] still going through trials you're still
[1:33:37] going through storms but it don't bother
[1:33:40] you you see you've experienced that this
[1:33:42] is the will of God you see it's not
[1:33:45] mental it's not in the mind you see but
[1:33:48] it's in the soul and brother Brandon
[1:33:50] would tell us we're Triune being right
[1:33:52] he would say we're Body Soul and Spirit
[1:33:54] he would say there's five senses to the
[1:33:56] body right there's there's sight there's
[1:33:58] taste there's smell there's hear and
[1:34:00] there's feeling right he says that's the
[1:34:02] five senses to the body then he says
[1:34:04] there's five senses to the spirit man
[1:34:07] right imagination conscience reasoning
[1:34:09] affection and memory he says those are
[1:34:11] five senses to the spirit man but then
[1:34:13] you've got a soul right and he says the
[1:34:15] soul there's two senses faith and doubt
[1:34:19] and what's so incredible is brother
[1:34:20] brandom says faith rescues you from your
[1:34:23] five sins
[1:34:24] of my goodness so whenever your your
[1:34:26] whenever your five senses of your spirit
[1:34:29] man is bringing you down faith in the
[1:34:31] soul rescues
[1:34:33] you that's why the will of God is in the
[1:34:36] soul not in the mind you can't be in
[1:34:39] that first face have a mental conception
[1:34:42] that you're doing right you got to know
[1:34:44] from the soul oh that's what brother the
[1:34:47] brand say you can have the Holy Ghost
[1:34:49] every day of your life and go straight
[1:34:50] to hell right you can have it on your
[1:34:52] flesh you can have it on your spirit man
[1:34:54] and it's not going to do nothing for you
[1:34:56] but but it's got to go to the soul the
[1:34:59] message can't just stay in the mind it
[1:35:01] can't just go to the Flesh and make you
[1:35:03] feel good Make You Dance go to the
[1:35:05] spirit man make you speak in tongues
[1:35:07] that's great and all but it's got to go
[1:35:09] to the soul once it goes to the soul
[1:35:12] then there's a stability that when the
[1:35:14] speaking in tongues wears off I'm still
[1:35:16] stable that whenever the feeling wears
[1:35:19] off I'm still stable when the dancing
[1:35:21] wears off I'm still stable see it's not
[1:35:24] in the mind not in the flesh not in the
[1:35:26] spirit but in the
[1:35:28] soul oh remember brother Brandon will
[1:35:30] talk about the three courts of the the
[1:35:33] Tabernacle in the Old Testament you
[1:35:34] remember that he was said there was the
[1:35:36] the outer Court inner court and the most
[1:35:37] holy place and he says the first chord
[1:35:40] he says the light was the sky natural
[1:35:43] light so if it was cloudy it was cloudy
[1:35:46] in the first chord if it was dark it was
[1:35:48] dark in there the sun was down it was
[1:35:50] sunny in there you see so the first
[1:35:52] Court the the the the light of it was
[1:35:54] determined by natural conditions then
[1:35:57] you would go into that second court and
[1:35:59] brother brandom says the light there was
[1:36:01] the the candlesticks and he says the
[1:36:03] candlesticks was lit by the preacher and
[1:36:06] so the light inside of that second Court
[1:36:08] was determined by your gifted preacher
[1:36:11] so if he was going through a trial you
[1:36:13] went through a trial right but you go
[1:36:16] into the third Court the holiest of
[1:36:18] holies the veil is dropped and there
[1:36:21] ain't no sun in there there ain't no
[1:36:23] candlestick lighting is the sh Glory you
[1:36:26] see so there ain't no man-made light no
[1:36:28] natural conditions it could be cloudy on
[1:36:30] the outside but it's still light on the
[1:36:32] inside the preacher might be late but
[1:36:35] it's still light on the inside and if
[1:36:37] the will of God anchors in the soul let
[1:36:40] everybody else do what they want to but
[1:36:43] there's an anchor on the inside of the
[1:36:47] Soul hallelujah oh when I say the
[1:36:50] Rapture is the will of God for your life
[1:36:52] Let It Go to the soul the body change is
[1:36:56] the will of God for your life let it go
[1:36:58] to the soul a Revival is the will of God
[1:37:01] let it go to the
[1:37:04] soul not just from the flesh but go to
[1:37:06] the
[1:37:08] soul Hallelujah I'm feeling good up here
[1:37:12] you see but the Brandon would say but in
[1:37:14] faith there's no reason he said there's
[1:37:16] no reason you've got it from God you
[1:37:18] know it's there I don't care how much it
[1:37:20] looks wrong you know it's still right
[1:37:23] it's thus saith the Lord he would say
[1:37:26] now now now this out here Satan just
[1:37:28] tempts you and knocks you around every
[1:37:30] way here but down here he can't do it
[1:37:34] unless you let him do it he says your
[1:37:37] spirit your flesh and your spirit he can
[1:37:39] tempt you but down there in the soul he
[1:37:42] has no control over it unless you let
[1:37:44] him in
[1:37:45] it oh got quiet there you see you've got
[1:37:49] the control over the enemy he can come
[1:37:51] against your flesh and spirit but where
[1:37:53] you're stabilized that's where you have
[1:37:55] to fight it oh now you got to fight it
[1:37:58] from coming inside of the Soul you see
[1:38:01] and brother brandham says you know it's
[1:38:03] right you're walking by thus sayith the
[1:38:05] Lord and so when you got this thus
[1:38:07] sayith the Lord it stabilize you and I
[1:38:09] think you know I seen a meme the other
[1:38:11] day and and it says that Elijah was the
[1:38:14] first Trash talker and man I just loved
[1:38:17] that was so funny could you imagine
[1:38:18] being Elijah and brother Brandon would
[1:38:21] tell us he saw Victory a vision so he
[1:38:24] already knew he was going to get the
[1:38:26] victory by it was sort of it was sort of
[1:38:28] an unbalanced uh uh battle here you know
[1:38:31] because you know as sports players I'm
[1:38:33] sure you you play you play football you
[1:38:35] know and if you're that you're stronger
[1:38:37] than the guy across the line but all of
[1:38:39] a sudden he gets in your mind starts
[1:38:41] doing his mind games right he starts
[1:38:42] talking trash to you and what when the
[1:38:45] reason why sports players talk trash is
[1:38:47] the one that get into your head right
[1:38:50] they know you're better than them they
[1:38:51] know you're stronger you're faster you
[1:38:53] know but they want to get into your head
[1:38:55] and if they can get into your head they
[1:38:57] mess you up right and here Elijah man
[1:39:00] it's the these guys the prophets of B
[1:39:03] knew they had the victory it was just
[1:39:05] one old man the King was the queen was
[1:39:07] against him the whole nation was against
[1:39:10] them and here comes Elijah choose ye
[1:39:12] this day who you're going to serve if
[1:39:14] the if the if the bail be God serve him
[1:39:17] but if God be God serve him and here
[1:39:18] stands the prophets of bell they're not
[1:39:20] going to believe this guy we got them so
[1:39:23] wrapped up in fear we got them so
[1:39:26] wrapped up they might miss the Rapture
[1:39:27] if they do that we got them so wrapped
[1:39:30] up then all of a sudden here comes the
[1:39:32] prophet say you know what y'all go ahead
[1:39:34] and go first you do your Showdown you
[1:39:36] know you do what you think is right here
[1:39:38] they start dancing there's Elijah cry a
[1:39:40] little louder maybe he's sleeping maybe
[1:39:44] he's on vacation maybe he's he's fishing
[1:39:47] maybe he's doing this he already seen my
[1:39:49] victory by Vision he knew he was going
[1:39:52] to win so go you're cutting yourself cut
[1:39:54] yourself come on to dance a little more
[1:39:57] yeah come on keep crying oh you're tired
[1:39:59] oh don't get tired out on me now come on
[1:40:02] cut yourself a little bit more he
[1:40:04] already had it by vision and oh man
[1:40:07] that's the way the bride needs to be
[1:40:09] devil that's all you got oh you got fear
[1:40:12] you got car plexes that's all you come
[1:40:14] on that's all you got try a little
[1:40:16] harder try a little harder try messing
[1:40:19] up my marriage try messing up my church
[1:40:22] try taking my children try taking my
[1:40:24] preacher try it we've already got
[1:40:27] Victory by
[1:40:29] Vision oh Hallelujah come on devil
[1:40:32] that's all you got cry a little louder
[1:40:35] amen come on and they would say that's
[1:40:37] what Muhammad Ali would do and Muhammad
[1:40:39] Ali would tell him you know oh that's
[1:40:41] all you got he would just sit there and
[1:40:43] be dodging oh that's all you got you're
[1:40:45] not getting tired are you oh come on
[1:40:47] tral all okay I'm going to start
[1:40:48] fighting now you see he would get into
[1:40:50] their mind and man the devil gets into
[1:40:52] our mind mind many times let's reverse
[1:40:54] that and say devil that's all you got
[1:40:57] you don't have enough you see the reason
[1:41:00] is is we're not fighting with the mind
[1:41:03] we're fighting with the soul sir it see
[1:41:06] you can't go Toe to Toe with your
[1:41:08] intellect you got to go Toe to Toe with
[1:41:10] the soul where it's anchored down there
[1:41:12] that's where the will of God is oh
[1:41:15] Hallelujah and you seeing but the
[1:41:17] Brandon would tell us that Jesus would
[1:41:21] had perfect faith and he and and I'm
[1:41:23] bringing this to a close and brother
[1:41:25] Brandon would tell us that J that the
[1:41:27] the two ingredients to perfect faith and
[1:41:29] he would say was Jesus knew who he was
[1:41:32] and had no condemnation he would say
[1:41:34] that imperfect faith and he would tell
[1:41:36] us and I love it he would say Jesus
[1:41:39] walked in his own world he said he
[1:41:41] walked in another world with just
[1:41:43] perfect faith and he says and when the
[1:41:45] woman with the issue of blood would come
[1:41:48] to Jesus and would touch him he says he
[1:41:50] had so much of this perfect Faith
[1:41:52] virtues just float out of his garments
[1:41:55] but I thought man that's powerful but
[1:41:56] then it don't stop there and then he
[1:41:58] says and so when a man lives by faith
[1:42:01] and walks by faith I mean substance
[1:42:03] Faith you see and fear is trying to take
[1:42:06] away your substance and this is why we
[1:42:08] need substance he says I mean substance
[1:42:10] Faith he is isolated from the entire
[1:42:13] world and becomes a new creature in
[1:42:15] Christ there now you're getting into
[1:42:18] bride material when I read that about
[1:42:21] one of the shout not Church material
[1:42:23] they've got profession of Faith but the
[1:42:25] bride's got substance Faith that's bride
[1:42:28] material which is stepping into another
[1:42:31] world oh Hallelujah that's why the gates
[1:42:34] of hell are trying to come but they're
[1:42:36] not prevailing you're walking in another
[1:42:38] world your flesh is walking on this
[1:42:41] Earth but your soul is in Heavenly
[1:42:43] Heights in Christ Jesus and he comes and
[1:42:47] he tempts and he tempts and he tempts
[1:42:49] but we're in another another world he
[1:42:50] continues on and becomes a new creature
[1:42:52] in Christ
[1:42:53] there now you're getting to brow
[1:42:55] material see see see you're getting into
[1:42:57] Rapture condition that this that means
[1:43:00] for each one of us and I love this part
[1:43:02] he says not just the pastor deacons
[1:43:05] trustees that means the Ley every
[1:43:08] individual that walks in the world is
[1:43:10] with God Alone every individual that
[1:43:14] walks with God is in a world alone oh
[1:43:17] then he then he would say then he would
[1:43:20] say that just like virtue came out of
[1:43:22] Jesus garments he says when you're
[1:43:24] walking in this world with God virtue
[1:43:26] comes out of your garments ain't that
[1:43:29] incredible so now the very flesh oh I
[1:43:31] love it you know the very garments that
[1:43:34] made Jesus human was now bringing
[1:43:38] Deliverance for the SW with the issue of
[1:43:40] blood right he laid aside his Royal
[1:43:42] garments and put on your garments he
[1:43:45] came in human flesh he came he came in
[1:43:48] Dusty garments and here that garment
[1:43:50] gave virtue and here now you're garment
[1:43:53] your flesh your Humanity you see you're
[1:43:57] not on Earth to glorify God with your
[1:43:59] flesh you're on or you're on Earth to
[1:44:01] glory god in your flesh you see your
[1:44:04] flesh can't Glory the devil but inside
[1:44:07] of that flesh your soul can be so
[1:44:09] stabilized that the virtues of God
[1:44:10] starts to flow out of your life you're
[1:44:13] walking in a world alone with God let
[1:44:14] our musicians come but the brandist say
[1:44:17] now perfect Faith Masters all conditions
[1:44:20] all circumstances and I love how brother
[1:44:22] br but put it cuz many times you know
[1:44:25] I've heard this and it almost sounds
[1:44:28] like it change it can change conditions
[1:44:30] and it can your faith can change
[1:44:32] situations but but the brandom continues
[1:44:34] on in there he would say the Lord's
[1:44:36] revealed that this certain thing is
[1:44:38] going to happen just speak on it and go
[1:44:39] on he says just don't ask any questions
[1:44:42] it's all over just keep going see it
[1:44:45] Masters all circumstances well if you do
[1:44:47] this so and so is going to do he says
[1:44:50] see there you see it's got it mastered
[1:44:52] faith believes God will work it out I
[1:44:55] don't know how he's going to do it but
[1:44:57] he'll do it anyhow see Masters all
[1:45:01] circumstances so faith and mastering all
[1:45:03] circumstances is saying I don't know how
[1:45:06] it's going to happen but it's going to
[1:45:08] happen you see many times we want to see
[1:45:11] the victory before we believe that
[1:45:13] there's going to be Victory oh now you
[1:45:15] see job was on his ass sheep and what I
[1:45:19] what's so incredible is job would say
[1:45:21] you know if a man die shall live again
[1:45:24] you if I could just find God then I
[1:45:26] would talk to him he had all of these
[1:45:28] questions because he lacked inspiration
[1:45:31] but what would happen the Bible would
[1:45:33] tell us that the Thunder would begin to
[1:45:35] Roar right and what would happen job
[1:45:38] would have just hear thunder he heard a
[1:45:40] voice and what would that voice do the
[1:45:43] voice would lift him up he would say I
[1:45:46] know my redeemer liveth so the very one
[1:45:49] he was looking for he would then see
[1:45:53] what else would he say in my flesh amen
[1:45:56] I shall see God so before the Thunder he
[1:46:00] was saying if a man die shall he live
[1:46:02] again he had questions he was looking
[1:46:05] for the answers but after the voice
[1:46:07] spoke to the Thunder he found the will
[1:46:09] of God for his life I'm not just going
[1:46:11] to go in the grave and die if a man die
[1:46:13] shall he live again I don't know but
[1:46:15] then the will of God would be unveiled
[1:46:17] in your flesh if you go the way of the
[1:46:20] grave and your skin worms destroy thy
[1:46:22] body in in your flesh you're going to
[1:46:24] see me I thought oh brother the brandom
[1:46:26] would tell us that the Thunder is the
[1:46:28] voice of God you see we got more than
[1:46:31] just thunders in this generation people
[1:46:33] still looking for the Myster of the
[1:46:34] Thunders we got the voice of God we got
[1:46:37] the will of God and in your flesh you're
[1:46:39] going to see God I believe this message
[1:46:42] has got every answer to every question
[1:46:45] whatever you have need of God has the
[1:46:48] has the answer to it and here
[1:46:51] joob and would think that I I've often
[1:46:54] thought this that after job would say
[1:46:57] this I know my redeemer liveth and on
[1:46:59] that day I'll say in my flesh I'll see
[1:47:00] God those skin worms you know destroy
[1:47:02] this body he's still there on his as
[1:47:05] sheep right he didn't wait till he was
[1:47:08] out of the trial to confess it but while
[1:47:11] he was still in the trial he was already
[1:47:14] confessing it already confessing it and
[1:47:17] you may still be in your trial but keep
[1:47:19] confessing it keep confessing the
[1:47:21] promises of God keep confessing you know
[1:47:24] the the Bible would tell us that Jesus
[1:47:26] told the disciples you know go go Terry
[1:47:28] ye in the city of Jerusalem and tell you
[1:47:31] be endued with power upon High and the
[1:47:33] word Terry in the Hebrew means to stay
[1:47:36] abide continue to stay in expectation
[1:47:40] and somebody would ask a question to
[1:47:42] brother Brandon and would say What's the
[1:47:44] difference between tering ye in
[1:47:47] Jerusalem until you renewed and with
[1:47:49] Jesus breathing on them and says receive
[1:47:51] the Holy Ghost he that they asked the
[1:47:53] question what's the difference but
[1:47:55] brandom says whenever Jesus breathed on
[1:47:57] them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:48:00] he says that was the promise of it he
[1:48:02] says but they had to go Terry to receive
[1:48:05] the Fulfillment of it oh and Terry is
[1:48:08] the stay in expectation so God would
[1:48:11] give them the promise but they had to
[1:48:12] stay in expectation to receive the
[1:48:15] promise oh and God has stabilized us
[1:48:18] with his word but we still got to stay
[1:48:20] in expectation we got to stay
[1:48:23] expectation if the Lord don't come today
[1:48:24] he's coming tomorrow if he don't come
[1:48:26] tomorrow he's coming next week if he
[1:48:28] don't come next week he's coming the
[1:48:29] next week you see we're staying in
[1:48:32] expectation and all of a sudden they
[1:48:34] were together in one Accord in the upper
[1:48:36] room and their expectation would break
[1:48:38] way into eternity and your expectation
[1:48:42] is going to break way into eternity
[1:48:44] don't give up on your faith don't give
[1:48:46] up on your expectation If You're
[1:48:48] Expecting loved ones to come back to the
[1:48:50] house of God keep expecting for it you
[1:48:53] got to chry you got to endure you got to
[1:48:55] be patient let's bow our heads
[1:48:59] tonight your gracious Heavenly
[1:49:02] Father Lord how I love you tonight Lord
[1:49:05] and I know everyone in this building
[1:49:06] loves you
