Amen. And brother Bram said when a worshipper comes and puts his head or hand upon the head of his sacrifice which was Jesus Christ and finds out that he had made paid the price for our sin and it wasn't [music] wasn't some bulls and goats or some by law. He said but his name's been put on the lamb's book of life and then the worshipper can walk out with a clean heart. Amen. When you realize that we have a sacrifice that's been made for us. How many say that's the desire of your heart tonight? Amen. and that you could walk out of the presence of God with a clean heart. Amen. We sure love the Lord tonight [music] and just say it's good to be in the house of the Lord. Want to welcome each one of you tonight. And I just want to remember in prayer uh this uh Sister Alina, which is one of the ladies that aren't that don't live here, their family, but they listen to the services. Uh but she's been having some real bad morning sickness asking the church uh for prayer. Also a prayer request for Olivia Simpson. Uh the doctor says says that she either has ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. So just ask the Lord to touch her body. Just remember her in prayer this evening. Maybe if somebody else have a need on their heart. I know God is certainly mindful of what we have need of. But before we [music] approach the word of God, I think we ought to bring our petitions before the Lord according to the word. Amen. And just call upon the name of the Lord. So let's just bow our heads together and just each one [music] ask him in your own way. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we are so grateful, Lord, to be able to stand and just to come to fellowship together around the word of God. Lord, how wonderful that you are, Lord. You've been so mindful of us, Lord. and you've done so many miracles in our midst, Lord, and many sicknesses that have been healed, Lord. And God, [music] people that have been in all sorts of conditions and places and many cases throughout the the church and the body of believers, but Lord, we've seen your hand on so many times. And Lord, so we just ask you tonight once again, Lord, that you'd be mindful of your children, Lord. And God, I pray that you would touch those that are sick, that are need, have a need this this evening, Lord. you know what we have need of. And Lord, we just come asking your hand of mercy [music] upon each one of these. Lord, we pray that you would anoint the word of God as we read it, Lord, that it would bring life to those that hear it. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight. And if you have your Bibles with you, just want to invite you to the book of Acts. And we're going to read out of the fifth chapter in the 16th verse. Acts 5 and 16. Amen. How many enjoy those services over the weekend, Brother Homer? Amen. I don't know how many of y'all's been going around the house saying, "I'm still corn." Me and Brother Ben, we texted, we've been texting back and forth. I'm still corn. And it don't matter how loud you say it or how quiet you say it. Has the same meaning. Amen. And I sure enjoy brother Homer and what [clears throat] a blessing he was to the church and and sure always appreciated his ministry and and certainly an elder in this message and have a lot of great a lot of respect for brother Homer. So we sure appreciate him come and open up his heart to us and it was definitely edifying to our church. Amen. And I know I grew so uh uh you know I know many testify the same thing and I think that's what we ought to do every time we come in the house of God is to grow a little bit closer to God. Amen. So I want to read out of Acts the 5th chapter and we'll read from the 16th verse. The Bible says now this this is after uh that they had been the disciples that Peter and they had been thrown into a prison and came back out of the the prison. They had been so uh tormented by the Pharisees and and uh there was many that was following them around and and and seen many great miracles. And the Bible said there came also a multitude out of the cities around about Jerusalem uh bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone. Then the high priest rose up and all that were with him, which is in the sect of the Sadducees, and were filled with indignation. And they laid their hands on the apostles to put them in the common prison. But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said, "Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life." And I would like to use that as a title uh tonight. Go stand and speak. And I'll just allow you to take your seats, go stand, and speak. You know, this instruction has been given many times uh in the Bible. And and in fact, um uh when God has a message for a people, there's always I find that this is the truth that there's always somebody to deliver God's message. God never has a message without uh finding somebody that will deliver it uh to the people. And the Bible is filled with examples of those that were sent out by God. And uh we won't have time to go through them all, but all through the scripture, whether it been Moses who was ordained of God to go into Egypt or whether uh it was Elijah that was called of God to go prophesy in the in the days of Ahab and many great prophets of God. But uh anytime God had a message, he would the Bible would tell us that they would be sent out by God. They would uh they would they would have this same instruction from God. Uh, brother Brandham actually preached a message called Gold Tale, which was a message concerning the commission that the angel of the Lord gave uh, at the time of Jesus's resurrection. Remember when Mary and they went down to the tomb and they found uh, there was that he wasn't there, but there was a man sitting by the side and he said to them, "Go and tell the disciples that he's on his way to meet them." And and so, not only were they sent, but they were they were sent with a message. message. Brother Bam said, you know, it doesn't do much good uh to go if you haven't got something to tell. Said, I think it's been a whole lot of the trouble today as we go to tell, but we've got nothing to tell. Nothing of any benefit, nothing that would help people. But see, there's many people going, there's a lot of people going and there's a lot of people talking and a lot of people telling, but you have to have something to be able to tell. He said, uh, so it's nothing of any benefit or nothing that would help people, but if we would follow the instructions of the these disciples who got the commission and realize that we have the same commission. Go and tell my disciples that I am risen from the dead and just go tell it. I I thought that that that's a good lesson for every preacher. It's a good lesson for every church member. Uh when we when we're when we're out delivering the message that God has given us, there was a real uh commission that he gave us. He said, "It's the same one they had. that it's a go tell that Jesus has been resurrected from the dead. And we see that in Mark the 16th chapter when Jesus would speak to the disciples just before he ascended into glory. The Bible said he told them, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe in my name. They shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. So, so first we see this uh being it was it was spoke during the resurrection go and tell my disciples and then uh then after the after it was told to the disciples to go manifest the resurrection of Jesus Christ he said go into all the world and preach the gospel. So it's the same message go and tell. I I thought isn't it something? And it came whenever the angel spoke to Mary. It came when Jesus spoke to the disciples. And then we find that same message in the book of Acts. And that realize that the message hasn't changed. The Bible said, "Go stand and speak the words of this life." And not only did he send them, but brother Ben, but he gave them the words to be able to speak. He said, "Go speak the words of this life." In other words, you have a message and that message is is the life or the resurrection of Jesus Christ. See? So, so God's word it, you know, I think that God has given us that message. It's not a changed message. It ain't a new message. He hadn't given us something uh today that's different than it ever has been. It's always been the same message. It's the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I think a lot of times that people uh they they get lost in what the message is and they uh they lose the reality of what this message is and try to make it something else and and trying to bring people into something else. But this is the message that God has given unto us. It's the tale of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. That's why we live in this age and we've seen many great miracles and there was a prophet in this age that that was per that performed many great miracles. It was to show the resurrection of Jesus Christ. So So you see it's still the same message all along. It ain't never changed. It's the same foundation that was laid. It was Jesus Christ. And and that's the commission that the church has today is to go and tell of the life or the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And you know what I find out to be the truth? That whenever God's word is told that it always has a reaction. How many believes that God's word is spoke, there's alo always a reaction. When the word of God goes forth, there's belief or there's unbelief. There's judgment or there's mercy. There there's there's many different things, but there's always a reaction. You know, I think about how uh that that there's always a response. When God gives an order to go speak, there's something uh that that God is seeking for. God don't send a message without a purpose for the message to be sent. He don't send an order without a purpose. He don't send anything out. There's nothing idle that's done by God. He don't give you a an order to go out and do something that has no purpose. But if God sent you to speak, then there's somebody there that would hear what you have to say. It makes me think of Eleazar. And whenever the Bible says that he went out seeking a bride for Isaac, do you realize that Eleazar uh first of all, Eleazar did not have his own message. He uh he was actually uh when he went down that old dusty trail and he out there going out to seek for a bride for for the man Isaac. But you realize that that the that Eleazar was on a mission of Abraham. He wasn't on his own mission. He wasn't uh trying to do his own thing. But brother said Eleazar he was representing the message that went forth from Abraham. So the message came from Abraham. Eleazar was a vessel that was going forth to bring about a child or a bride unto the unto his son Isaac which was a type of the father today uh that was sending out a message in this hour to bring a bride to his pro to his son which was Jesus Christ. So there would be a church in this last day that would hear the ministry of that eleaser or that eleaser call that would that would respond to it. You realize friends the eleaser he didn't carry his own message. He didn't have his own agenda. He wasn't trying to build his own kingdom. But the Bible said that he carried gifts from the father Abraham down to the well. That mean every gift that he had, every ability that he had, all that he took to the well, all that was displayed before Rebecca, none of it was Eleaser's. It was all belonged to Abraham. Eleazar was just a poor man in service to Abraham and service to the father that came back down and delivered the gifts that the father had given unto him for the purpose of bringing a bride unto his son. And friends, let me tell you, when God sends someone with a message, he equipped him for the journey. He gave Elezer what he needed. He He gave him every gift that he would need. He knew what would turn her heart. He knew what would put a smile on her face. He He knew what would melt her heart. He knew everything to give her that and he knew this. He knew that whenever he went and he that there would be two things just like every call of God there there's a calling and there's a response to the calling. I believe that that God knew when Eleazar left the house of Abraham that Eleazar wasn't going to come back empty-handed. How many believe that? And I believe in this hour that God knew when he sent a message in the middle of Leodysa that it wouldn't come back empty. But there will be somebody that would respond to the call of God. See, anytime there's a calling, there's always a response. Brother Homer preached the message on how a seed responds to the light. And and you realize that you're serving God is a response. It's not just something that you decided to do, but you being here this morning or tonight and you just serving God. It's a response to a call that God has placed in your life. For you to come to church on a Wednesday night and you to have your hands raised and be serving and committing your life to God. Every bit of that is a response to a call. We didn't just get up one day and decide, I'm going to be a church member. I'm going to go down to Grace Tabernacle and I'm going to put in my time and I'm going to but but it has nothing to do with that. All of your serving God is a response to a call that God placed in your life. You being a believer is a response. You serving God is a response. You being filled with the Holy Ghost, it's a response to a call of God. I can prove that by the Bible because Joel said, "This promise is unto is to you and to your children and them that are a far off and as many as the Lord our God shall call." So in order for you to even receive the Holy Ghost, it had to be a response to a call that God has made in this hour. So here God came down and he's calling to the church and he's calling right in the middle of this old rugged age and this old lost age in the middle of the darkness of Leodysia in the filth of this world but the call of God is still going out and the cry of God is still going out and that Eleaser message is still going out and every now and then it'll come by a well where there's a Rebecca that's sitting there that something on the inside of her heart hears the voice of Eleaser and it caused her to turn her heart unto uh Isaac. &gt;&gt; Now, isn't that something that she was she was drawn to him? Why? It was a response to a call. See, some I think sometimes people misunderstand God. You know, I I you know, because they say, "Well, I think I thought we we called on God, that's whenever we're ser we're saved." And that's the Bible. That's what Paul said. He said he's the Lord over all and he's rich unto all that call upon him. So, you call for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How many believe that? Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. But can I go a little bit farther? Said, but how can they call on him who they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him if they have not heard? And how can they hear without a preacher? See, how can the message get out if there ain't nobody to preach it? And how shall they preach except they be sent? So, what that tells us is before you could ever call on God to be saved, first you had to receive a call from God that that was sent by an anointed person, a a man of God that was anointed for the hour to take the word of God and come right down to your house or to your living room and to deliver a message from God that was a call of God and something would prick your heart and that little prick in your heart WOULD CAUSE YOU TO call upon the name of the Lord. Thereby, you are saved. It all come from God calling us first. See, this was Eleazar's ministry. He went for the purpose of getting a bride for the promised son. And you know what? I I I love this because Eleazar didn't know what her name was. He didn't know what she looked like. He I h how will I know who she is? What if she don't come? How will I be able to recognize her? All these things that was on his heart. But you know what Abraham told him before he left? He said, "Don't worry about all of that, Eleazar, because the God that made the promise, he will send an angel before you, and you shall bring forth a bride for my son." So, there wasn't nothing in Eleazar's heart that wondered, "When I go down by the well, I'm going to come back empty-handed because he had a promise from God. You just go down there and preach the message, and you're and an angel's going to go before you." In other words, he's going to play. He He's going to cause them. He's going to make an atmosphere. He's going to prepare the hearts of the people. An angel will go before you that when they hear the call, they're going to respond the right way. &gt;&gt; Somebody has been prepared to hear the word or the message from Eleazar. See the when he come, he he said, "You just go you just go say what I say to to say you." In other words, you just go preach the message. You just go you just go speak it. You know what? He may have went down there feeling like I'm not the man equipped for the I just preached tonight. I I'm not the man equipped for this. and you know there's many that are a lot better than me and maybe somebody would be they'd be goodter at it and they'd get a little bit more response and all of that. He said, "But you just go preach the message. I'll send an angel down there before you and I'll prepare the heart of the one that's supposed to receive it and she'll respond." &gt;&gt; And you know what? Even after all of that promise, Eleaser still being a real man of God, you know what he done? He got down there and he started praying to God. He said, "Lord, here I am. I've done all this traveling. I I packed the camels. We loaded the the the the train. We we we we've got all the gifts and everything. We come down to the well now. He sat there thirsty and he be to he be to pray to God and say, "Lord, can you give me some way to know that she's the one?" He said, "Let her I I just pray let her be the one that when I asked for a drink that she would say, not only will I give you a drink, but I'll water your camels also." See, in his prayer was that her response would identify who she was. In other words, listen what he's saying. I don't have the ability to identify her. I don't have the ability. I don't know if she belongs TO YOU OR NOT. I don't know if she's the one OR NOT. I CAN LOOK AT ACROSS THE WHOLE CONGREGATION. I DON'T KNOW WHO'S SAVED AND WHO AIN'T. I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE who belongs to God and who don't. But he said, God, let her response be her identification. Isn't that a prayer? I don't have the ability. He said, BUT LET HER RESPOND in such a way that she would be identified. And so you see that her response became her identity. And while she was praying, while he was praying, the Bible says all of a sudden Rebecca came walking on the scene. While he was yet praying, the very thing he was praying about, came walking down there. And you know what he done, Eleaser? He called upon her. He he, you know, and and he asked her for a drink. And she said the very thing that he prayed, "Well, not only will I give you to drink, but I'll water your camels also." You know what he didn't have to do? He never had to talk her into it. He never had to coach her into him. He never had to prime it out of her. All he said was, "Would you give me a drink?" And she responded the way she was supposed to respond. And you know what he done? HE SAID, "THIS IS HER. PRAISE GOD. IT'S HER." HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S HER, ELEAZAR? Because her response identified who she was. She heard the message of the hour and she responded to it. SHE HEARD THE CALL OF GOD AND SHE RESPONDED TO IT. There's many that would have ran away. There's many that would have went the other way or went home. But she responded to the call of God and her response identified who she was. And then he told her what his purpose of was for being there and how that she had fulfilled it. But remember says here the character. He said he found the character that was in the woman Rebecca, that beautiful bride of Isaac. And he told her about Isaac and she never questioned one thing but she believed the word of the messenger and she made ready to go. She said I will go. He said to what? A man she had never even seen or know nothing about. But yet she was ready because she was predestinated or for ordained to that. An angel had already came and prepared the way. It had prepared the ground. He had prepared every heart that whenever she heard that message of Eleaser, she would respond the right way. Friends, I don't know about you, but I say, God, let me just respond the right way. I may know not not know the right thing to say, but let my response be so be it. Let my response be amen to the word of God. Let my response be Lord. SO BE IT UNTO ME LORD AS YOU see fit. But notice what it was. What showed her character is that she responded. He said she was a woman of great character. But what showed her character is that she responded without knowing anything. Isn't that wonderful? She didn't respond because she was going to get a gift. Hello somebody. &gt;&gt; She didn't respond because she was going to get something. She responded I as a fulfillment of prophecy. It's it was the heart of a servant. She never expected one thing. See, she she wasn't looking for gifts. She wasn't looking for recognition. Hello, somebody. She wasn't looking for glory. She wasn't looking for praise. She responded because of who she was. I I got news for you. We live in a world that it's like living in an elementary school. Everywhere you go, everybody's looking for praise. I'll do that if you'll give me a little praise. I I'll do that if I can get a little glory. I'll do that if I can get a little money. I I'll do that if I CAN GET A LITTLE BIT. AFTER ALL, don't you see what everybody's like a bunch of elementary school kids? It's good for kids. But when adults are doing it, it shows the maturity of the adult. A kid says, "Didn't I do good, daddy? Don't you like that? Isn't my drawing good? Isn't that good? Isn't that wonderful?" That's a That's a child. But as you grow and mature as a Christian, we're not seeking after that. We're not praise seekers. We're not looking for the praise of men. Matter of fact, the Bible said that there was many chief priests and elders that believed on Jesus Christ, but they wouldn't confess his name because they was afraid they would be thrown out of the synagogue. And the Bible says, "For they love the praise of men more than they love the praise of God." &gt;&gt; This world is full of praise seekers. &gt;&gt; Didn't you see what I done? Can't you see what I done? Can't you always looking for praise because they're not confident in just the in just serving the Lord? So, see, they're they're praise seekers. Jesus said, "Take heed." Can &gt;&gt; Well, that ain't that ain't nice. But I'm just going to say it like it is. We're not We don't serve God to get anything. &gt;&gt; So, see, she she didn't she didn't respond to get anything. She wasn't looking for a gift. She wasn't looking for a handout. &gt;&gt; She was just responding because of who she was. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Take heed when you do your arms before men, not to be seen of them. Otherwise, you have no reward of your father which is in heaven." &gt;&gt; So, when you give, you don't give to be seen given. I'm just going to give you some free teaching. You don't give to be sing given. He said, because you will have no reward from your father which is in heaven. Therefore, when you do thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites and the synagogues do, but it may be the may glory from men. But I say unto you, they have their reward. But when you do arms, let not the left hand know what the right hand doeth, that thine arms may be in secret, and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. So So you give in secret that you're rewarded openly. Says, see why why do you serve God? Why do you give? Do we give to to get recognition or to get glory or or to get praise? He said, even when you pray, don't be as the hypocrites are because they stand in the synagogues and the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men. He said, "But I say they have their reward. But when you pray, enter into thy closet, and the door shut, pray to the Father in secret, and the Father which seeth thee in secret shall reward thee openly. But when you pray, use not vain repetition as the heathen does, for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. But but be not ye therefore like them, for your Father knoweth what things you have need of before you even ask him." So we don't have to make vain repetitions and vain babblins and try to be somebody or make some some great prayer or something in front of everybody to try to gain recognition. You know why? Because we're not looking for praise. We're not looking for glory. I'm not looking for men's applause. I IT'S OKAY TO GET IT. When somebody does something, it's okay to say good job and God bless you. And it's okay to reward them. But we don't serve God in order to get a reward from men. I SERVE GOD JUST TO SERVE GOD. I SERVE GOD BECAUSE THAT'S WHO WE ARE. And let me tell I may as well just preach that I'm here anyway. I I didn't know I was going to get into all this. But let me tell you what happens when you go praise seeking. It robs you from the blessing that God wants to give you. Because when you're seeking the praises of men and you don't get praised like you ought to get praised or you feel like you ought to get praised and then you're down and you're critical and you're upset in your spirit and then the blessing that God would give you for what you done, you can't even recognize the blessing because you're so tore up because you're expecting something else &gt;&gt; from men, &gt;&gt; it robs you of your blessing. &gt;&gt; You don't get your blessing. It's overshadowed. your blessing from God becomes overshadowed by your desire to be praised by men. &gt;&gt; Said, but we don't we don't we don't come to God seeking seeking praise or seeking glory. You know, you remember whenever Jesus was standing in the house or sitting in the house of Simon and that little ill-famed woman went down to where he was, brother said, "Notice that woman when she washed Jesus's feet, he said she never asked for a blessing." &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? She knelt down at his feet. You remember you remember the story? She knelt she knelt down at his feet and she looked at him that that old hypocrite Simon was making fun of him and and trying to degrade his character. So that's what they're always trying to do. Make him look little and like he's nothing but that old Pharisee after he invited him in there and he let him sit back there. He never washed his feet. They never they never done anything to him. They didn't greet him like they did others. They just let him come in so they could make fun of him. And you know, remember when they came in, they they may put a robe on them or or wash their feet at the door and spray some perfume and make them welcome that that everybody can come and fellowship together. But when Jesus came in the building, even though that he was invited in there, they didn't welcome him. They didn't wash his feet. They didn't greet him with a kiss. They they didn't put a robe on him. They didn't they they they had no perfume to put on him, but they just allowed him sit over there in the corner with dirty feet to be mocked and made fun of. That's the one down there in Nazareth. That's the one that's out prophesying. That's the one that that's out healing the sick and raising the dead and making the lame leap like a heart. That's the one that that's trying to fulfill all the all the words of David. They just sitting there and poked fun and made fun of him sitting there. But all of a sudden that little prostitute walked by. But says she was just a little degraded woman. Had a few nickels that she had earned from her ill fame living. But when she saw him sitting there and she came down to his feet and those big tears rolled down her cheek, she went down there and she bought an alabaster box with all the money that she had. She bought an alabaster box of ointment and and she slipped away in some way. She snuck in into the building where he was and she fell down at his feet and she began to cry. And when she went she didn't have a towel to wash his feet with. He said so she took her hair and she began to wipe his feet with her hair. thought what a what a beautiful water for his feet was the tears of a repentant sinner as she began to wash his feet and you realize that she wasn't asking God I thought about her kneeling there many times you'd wonder but that woman kneeling at the feet of Jesus what what would you do at the feet of Jesus but you know you realize that while she was down there she never asked him for one thing she never asked him for one thing she wasn't kneeling there to get personal gain she wasn't kneeling there to make her life better she wasn't kneeling there uh to try to gain some wealth or or gain some recognition or to be a somebody. She just seen but said she just seen that it needed to be done. She knelt down at his feet because she seen that it needed to be done. He said that's what I was. I was I was just that type of people, a no good sinner. Every one of us was the same that hasn't come to him. He said, "But you don't just come to be a member of a church, but you come because there's something to be done because Jesus needs to be served. Somebody should be there." Oh, don't you think we ought TO DO IT? SOMEBODY should be there. She didn't say, "Lord, IF YOU BLESS ME, I'LL SERVE YOU. LORD, IF YOU'LL BLESS MY HOME, I'LL SERVE YOU. LORD, IF YOU'LL GIVE ME WEALTH, I'LL SERVE YOU. LORD, IF YOU'LL GIVE ME STATUS, THEN I'LL SERVE YOU." BUT SHE JUST SEEN THAT IT NEEDED TO BE DONE. &gt;&gt; And she served him. He said, "Is there somebody that'll just serve him?" She just washed his feet and she wiped them with the hairs of her head. Said, "Can't we do that today? Can't we do that today that we just don't ask for nothing?" Hello, somebody. Can't we do that today that we just don't ask for nothing? It just needs to be done. He needs to be worshiped. He needs to be served. The gospel needs to be preached. WHETHER WE GET A PENNY OR OR WE DON'T GET NOTHING, IT NEEDS TO BE PREACHED. WE HAVE A CAUSE. WE NEED TO SERVE GOD. He needs to be sure. HE NEEDS TO BE WORSHIPED WITHOUT ASKING FOR ANYTHING. I don't need a position. I don't need a payment. I don't need to be a somebody in the church in order to show up for church. I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE AN OFFICE IN THE CHURCH. OH, GOD forbid we give somebody an office to make them come to church. If that's the reason, that's the worst person to ever give an office to. &gt;&gt; It'll be the ones that come to church that are there at their posted duty. That's the kind of people you give offices in the church to because they're there. God, y' don't y'all don't get after me. Just preaching the word. But we don't we don't need a position in order to serve God. &gt;&gt; I don't need a a a gain. I don't need recognition in order to serve God. I serve God because of who I am and because of who he is. So we were all a sinner just like her. But I can come before him. I can serve him because of who I am and because of who he is. You see, we you don't you realize, don't we have in there a cause to preach the gospel? Do we not have a need? Is this world in the worst condition that it's ever been? There's certainly a need. There's a cause. In a in a time of war, there's a need for peace. In a time of darkness, there's a need for light. In a time of famine, there's a need for bread. IN A TIME OF HATRED, there's a need for love. I say there's a cause. &gt;&gt; We have a cause. You see, but it's a message. But remember said it's a message and it's got to go regardless. &gt;&gt; Regardless of what we get out of it, it's a message and it has to go forth. We serve God because there's a message and it has to go forth. Don't you realize there's a herd and a wounded and a sinful world that's been deceived by the devil. But God has given you a message to tell the world about a resurrected Jesus. I'm not talking about the preachers. I'm talking about everybody. He's given you a message to tell the world about a resurrected Jesus that's still alive and he's working amongst his people today. How many believe that? Say amen. I said he's still alive and he's working among his church. Let me tell you why, friends? Because the devil's done everything he can to stomp out the name of Jesus. You realize why we have a right to go speak the name of Jesus out in this community? Because the devil's doing everything he can to stomp it out. But I say in the face of every devil in hell, in the name of Jesus. I say, come on, somebody say it WITH ME THIS TONIGHT. IN THE NAME OF JESUS, IN THE IT DON'T MATTER WHAT THE devil said. IN THE NAME OF JESUS. OH, DON'T YOU REALIZE that that in the Bible they had been preaching and they and the devil it didn't bother him that Peter was preaching. It didn't bother him that the disciples were preaching. But the Bible says what bothered them, what stirred them up is because they spoke in the name of Jesus Christ. And &gt;&gt; you know what they done? They came and they they put them in the jail and the angels came and let them out. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "Then they went down in the temple and they were preaching in the temple according to the instruction of the angel. And the council went and got them again. And when they brought them and set them before the council, the high priest asked them, listen what he asked. The high priest asked them. He said, "Did we not straightly command you that you should not teach in his name?" Other words, you can you can preach all you want to, but leave the name of Jesus out of it. &gt;&gt; Isn't it something like the devil? He said, you can you can preach what you want to, but leave the name of Jesus out of it, and you or otherwise you'll fill Jerusalem with your doctrine. You intend to bring this man's blood upon us. But the Bible said, "But Peter and the other apostles said, but we ought to obey God rather than men. For the God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew, and you hanged on a tree. In other words, you crucified him, but my God raised him up. You cast him out, but my God drew HIM BACK IN. YOU YOU CURSED HIM, BUT GOD BLESSED HIM. YOU STOMPED HIM DOWN, BUT GOD HAS ELEVATED HIM. &gt;&gt; He said he's EXALTED HIM WITH HIS RIGHT HAND TO BE A PRINCE AND A SAVIOR to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are his witnesses of these things. And so is the Holy Ghost that has been given unto us to them that obey him. See, they were preaching the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; And finally, there was a halfway smart Pharisee. There's some men today that need to take the wisdom of Galia. There was a halfway smart Galia, a Pharisee named Galiel. And he said, "If this be the work of men, then it'll come to nothing. But if it be the work of God, we couldn't overthrow it if we wanted to, and we're going to find ourselves going against God." He said, "So, wouldn't it be best if we just left it alone and just see what kind of work that it is?" He said, "See, so finally whenever they left, so they said, 'Okay, we'll just let them go." So they gave him a good beatating and they said, "You can go out and then we'll go beat you and then we go out, but don't you speak the name of Jesus anymore." And they let him go. You know what they did, brother Ben, when they left? The Bible says they left out rejoicing because they counted it worthy to suffer shame for his name. They count it worthy to be like that little prostitute that knelt down at his feet that people that ill-famed woman. They they count it worthy to be like Rebecca that would that would go and just water the camels. And why why are you down there, Rebecca? You don't even know who that is. What are you what are you following after? YOU YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM OR OR WHERE HE COME FROM. You've never met THIS HOUSE. WHAT CAUSED YOU TO WATER LIKE your water? But she counted them worthy &gt;&gt; because she's who she was. He's who he was. The Bible says, "In daily in the temple and in every house, they cease not to preach and teach in the name of Jesus." Let me tell you why Satan don't like it. Because he fears the name of Jesus. And he's done everything that he can to keep the name of Jesus out of the mouth of believers. But I say this, I say this tonight. In the name of Jesus, let the sick be healed. In the name of Jesus, let the lame walk. In the name of Jesus, let the deaf let the deaf hear. In the name of Jesus, let let the dumb speak. In the name of Jesus, let the blind LET THE BLIND SEE. IN THE NAME OF JESUS, LET THOSE THAT ARE BOUND BE FREE. IN THE NAME OF JESUS, LET THOSE THAT ARE LOST BE SAVED. I DEFY EVERY DEVIL OUT OF THE PITS OF HELL THAT WOULD TAKE THE NAME OF JESUS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE believers or to try to separate it from this message in the name of Jesus. So, let it be done. Oh, let me tell you what that devil's done. He tried to come by AND SAY, "WELL, Y'ALL'S FALLEN after something, some phony thing, but but but because try to make it something that IT AIN'T." BUT YOU'LL NEVER SEPARATE the name of Jesus away from the message of the hour. You realize that, brother Brandham, in his recorded ministry, he spoke the name of Jesus over 37,000 times. That's,200 sermons. 37,000 times. That's 31 and some change times per sermon on an average that he spoke the name of Jesus. THAT MEANS YOU CAN'T SEPARATE THE MAN FROM HIS MESSAGE. HE CAME AS A MINISTRY, an eleaser ministry to PREACH THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST. EVERY TIME HE HAD A MICROPHONE, HE SPOKE THE NAME OF JESUS. EVERY TIME HE HAD A PLATFORM, HE SPOKE THE NAME OF JESUS. EVERY TIME YOU GIVE HIM A VOICE, HE SPOKE THE NAME OF JESUS OVER SIN, OVER DEVILS, OVER HELL, OVER BONDAGE. EVERY TIME YOU GIVE A MAN OF GOD AN OPPORTUNITY, HE'LL SPEAK THE name of Jesus. He wasn't coming to BUILD HIS OWN KINGDOM. HE WASN'T COMING TO TO DRAW SOMETHING. WELL, FRIENDS, LET ME TELL YOU THAT WHAT A WHAT A MAN THAT THE DEVIL WOULD SAY WAS BUILDING A KINGDOM UNTO HIMSELF. HE SPOKE ABOUT JESUS a lot &gt;&gt; to be a man that was trying to build a kingdom to himself. But the devil hates it. He hates when you preach about the resurrection of Jesus Christ. He hates it to be manifested. You know why Satan hates it? Hello, somebody. You know why he hates it? Because the Bible said, "If you shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe it in your heart that God has raised him FROM THE DEAD, YOU SHALL BE SAVED." &gt;&gt; NO WONDER THE DEVIL HATES YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK THE NAME OF Jesus &gt;&gt; and confess the name of Jesus with your mouth. [snorts] Said, "For every for the heart of every man believeth under righteousness, with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. said, "Confess the name of the Lord Jesus. Believe it in thy heart and thou shalt be saved." Ain't that powerful? Sister Paige, she here few days ago her grandfather had passed away. She had asked the church for prayer and uh he was been very sick and you know her real concern was is that her grandpa never served the Lord. Many times she stood and gave a testimony and gave a witness to him, testified to him, lived a life in front of him, but he never served the Lord. She tried to talk to him about church and tried to talk to him about the Lord, but no, no, no, no. Don't want to talk about that. And I I went to his funeral, you know, I recognized at his funeral when they started putting the pictures on the board that Paige was his favorite human being. I found that out real fast. Every picture flashed whenever he was in a picture with her, he was a different man. You you just see it on his face. But when she asked asked for prayer, he was in the hospital, she they they they had gone in there to do surgery and the and it had failed. And so whenever he came back into the room, they said that that he's he's probably not going to live. It had failed. And they had to rush him back in. He was bleeding internally. There was no way to stop him. And so so we we all went into prayer for him. And and and so he went back in. It looked like he he wasn't going to make it. And they they got through the night and they came back the next day. And the nurses even said that he was a walking miracle. The next day he came back and and he he was able to communicate with his family and they said he was a walking miracle. And the next within 24 hours later he had passed on. And I remember whenever pages sent out the testimony to everybody and said, you know, it's such a miracle. My grandpa, they gave him they said he was wasn't going to make it through the night and all this and but but God brought him through the night and now and now they're they're calling him a walk of miracle and glory to God for for what he done. And within 24 hours he had passed on. You know it troubled her. It was uh because you know she had prayed and told this testimonies all of it. But you know when we were sitting at the funeral I heard the minister that was doing the doing the service and he got to telling that testimony of how what had happened to him and how that how that he was supposed to be gone. And then the and all of a sudden he was back and it was a miracle. And here he had another day to spend with his family. And that man had been trying for a year to go sit down and talk to him about the Lord. He said, ' And every time I went to talk to him, he said, 'N no, not right now. Now is not a good time. Very friendly, a good man. Everybody loved him. He just didn't want to talk about the Lord. He said, but that day his son called me and said he wants to see you. He said, so I went up there with him and he said, I heard him out of my own ears. I heard him speak, Lord Jesus, will you please save me? &gt;&gt; I said, that's all I needed to hear right there because that's what my Bible said in Romans 10:9. If thou shalt confess the Lord Jesus with thy mouth and believe it in thy heart, thou shalt be saved. I thought, isn't our God a miracle working God that would give a man that SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE THAT NEVER ONE DAY DID HE EVER serve the Lord, BUT THEN HE WOULD GIVE IT HE WAS SO MERCIFUL ENOUGH THAT HE WOULD BRING HIM BACK OR OR GIVE HIM LIFE ANOTHER DAY, JUST ONE MORE DAY WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONFESS THE name of the Lord Jesus Christ. FRIENDS, I'M TELLING YOU that one confession out of thy mouth of the name of Jesus Christ is enough to wipe away 80 years or A THOUSAND YEARS OF THE SIN OF MANKIND. IT TOOK ONE CONFESSION AND A FAITH IN THY HEART TO BELIEVE IT. OH FRIENDS, it don't take a big work up. It's a confession. THAT'S THE POWER THAT'S IN THE NAME OF Jesus Christ. No wonder the devil wants to keep the name of Jesus out of the mouth of the believers because there's power in the name of Jesus. It's a deliverer. He's a healer. He's a savior. HE SAID, "GO STAND AND SPEAK OF THE LIFE THAT GOD HAS GIVEN YOU. TAKE A STAND IN THIS HOUR AND PREACH THE GOSPEL of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; You friends, let me tell you this. The apostles, they they disagreed on a lot of things, but there's one thing. Many Bible studies, there's one thing they all agreed on, and that was everything we do, we do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Paul said, "Whatever you do in word or deed, do it in the name of Jesus." Book of Acts said there's no other salvation in any other name than than under the heaven is given among men whereby we must be saved but the name of Jesus Christ. I say we have a cause to bring Jesus present among the people to make him known. That's how you realize that's how you win people to the Lord. They that they can see him in you. &gt;&gt; That's the only way you'll ever win anybody to the Lord. That's our cause. That's our that's our purpose. It's our business. Our business is to win the center. &gt;&gt; You know, I told Sister Paige and I asked her, could I share this? So, it's okay. But I told her, I said, you know, you you you may not even been there whenever your grandpa made that confession, but every day you lived a life in front of him. &gt;&gt; And every day, I promise you that he that that that was on his mind. Every testimony that you ever told him, it was on his mind. Every every thing, every opportunity that you ever gave him, it was on his mind. See, you win. You don't win a sinner. See, see, see, people think people think they win souls by by by praying for people. Can I just Can I give you something? &gt;&gt; And you know, you can pray the most sincere prayer and it'll never win a soul to God. &gt;&gt; They think it's by praying for people. I'm going to go pray for the sinner and if I pray for them, it'll win them to the Lord. But you're praying for them will never win them to the Lord. &gt;&gt; It don't win people to God. But said, you don't win him by praying for him. You win him by talking to him and introducing him to Christ. That's your business. That's your duty is to win sinners by talking to them and projecting to them the love of God through the word of God. That's what wins the sinner. Because some people say, "I won't even go to a church, but I sure like that woman or I sure I sure like that fella." See, because you're winning them. And if you would have stayed at home and just prayed for the sinner and never went in contact, then there is very little that can be done. But you've got to pray and then go. See, you got to go do it. Then you're projecting his love. So, it wasn't pray and stay, but it was pray and go. &gt;&gt; See, there's a lot of people that pray and stay, but that ain't the commission that God gave us. It ain't pray for the sinner and stay, but it's pray and go and go to the That's why Jesus said, "I HAVE A NEED TO GO by Samaria to the woman at the well." That's why he went to the caves of the of the man from Ga the Gera that was that was filled with ALL THE DEMONS. THAT'S WHY WHEN THE MAN THAT WAS HEALED OF BLINDED EYES AND THEY KICKED HIM OUT OF THE SYNAGOGUE, THE BIBLE SAYS, "BUT JESUS FOUND HIM OUTSIDE OF THE CITY AND SAID, "DO YOU BELIEVE on the son of God?" &gt;&gt; See, because he wasn't afraid to go &gt;&gt; to where they were. &gt;&gt; Said, "Pray and go." Not pray and stay. Pray and go. Go stand and speak. &gt;&gt; See, we have a commission to go. A message to preach. I wish I had all night and I know I don't. But we have a commission to go and a message to preach. &gt;&gt; But you realize that what you speak &gt;&gt; is only as good as the platform that you're speaking from. &gt;&gt; It's only as good as you realize that what whenever whenever Stephen was stoned in the Bible and they they brought him down there and here they were they were going to stone him for for for his conviction. He was out there preaching and my he gave him a straight message. The Bible says that they saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. I I know how that's interpreted because when people preach it, they say his face shined as an angel or it shone like an angel. But do you realize that when you read that word, they saw his face as the face of an angel, that word angel is actually messenger. So the Bible says, so they saw his face as it had been the face of a messenger. Now a messenger is face is not a bright light. It's not a it's not a bright light. They didn't see Stephen in a bright glow on his face, but he be here he was preaching. You stip you uncircumcised in your heart and ears. You resist the Holy Ghost. You're just like that what your father's done. You do the same thing. You crucify Jesus. You're going to pay for his sin. You're the you're the ones that are lost. He was giving him a straight message. But remember, but but but the glowing he wasn't glowing like a light, but his shining came from where he knew where he was standing and he knowed his position. Said, "So his face may not have shined like a light up there, but the angel knows what he's doing. An angel is a messenger that's commissioned from God. And he don't have to back down because he knows right where he stands. So what gave him the face of an angel was that he had met God. He was filled with the Holy Ghost. HE WAS STEADFAST IN THE MESSAGE THAT GOD GAVE HIM. That he was preaching. He lived it. He breathed it. And he believed it. AND THAT GAVE HIM A PLACE TO STAND. BUT SAID THAT'S WHY HIS FACE SHONE LIKE THAT BECAUSE HE KNEW RIGHT where he was standing &gt;&gt; because he believed the word of God. He was a son of God. Oh friends, don't you realize in order for you to go and speak, you have to have a place to stand and you can't stand You can't stand on your own reputation because every one of us will be lost. We don't Everybody would look at your past and say, "Well, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANYWAY BECAUSE I know where you came from and I I know what you used to be. How I I I promise you they'll come and condemn you if you no matter where you go to church and no matter what your who your pastor is. Every church hears the same thing about every pastor. But you bet whenever you come in the house of God, don't you think somebody ain't gonna come by and say, "Well, I couldn't ever sit under him because I know he used to do this. I REMEMBER ONE TIME HE DONE THIS." And you know, after all that is, what is it? It's a devil that would try to dispute the place that we're standing. But do you realize that our ministry, it don't come from oursel? Our ministry don't come from our uh from our past. IT DON'T IT AIN'T IT AIN'T BUILT ON OUR OWN MERIT. WE'RE NOT STANDING ON OUR own reputation, but what we're standing on is I'VE BEEN REDEEMED BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. AND THE STEADFASTNESS DOESN'T COME FROM MY EFFORT. It come from the BLOOD OF JESUS. I MADE MY CONFESSION. I BELIEVED IT WITH MY HEART. AND THERE AIN'T NO DEVIL THAT CAN TAKE IT AWAY. I WONDER HOW MANY CAN SAY THAT TONIGHT. I MADE MY CONFESSION AND I BELIEVE IT WITH MY HEART and there ain't no devil that can take it away. But a man said, "Now because of that," &gt;&gt; he said, "Now you're standing completely justified." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, that make a old country boy want to dance. He said, "You're standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning." Said, "This is my message to the church now. You are standing if you're listen if you're standing on God's word and with God's word every amen every jot every tit you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place justified. Why? Why are you justified? Because you're standing on God's word. He said you are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. Every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God, he stands as though he never sinned in the first place, you are perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ. Now, brother Ben, not only are we going, not only do we have a message TO SPEAK, BUT WE'VE GOT A PLACE TO STAND. I'm standing by the blood of Jesus Christ. GOD HAS GIVEN US A platform to speak the testimony OF JESUS CHRIST. HOW DO YOU SPEAK LIFE ANYHOW? IT'S BECAUSE THAT LIFE HAS CAME DOWN ON THE INSIDE OF ME AND IT'S TRANSFORMED ME. AND WHAT USED TO BE DEAD HAS COME ALIVE. WHAT USED TO BE LOST HAS BEEN SAVED. WHAT USED TO BE SICK HAS BEEN MADE WELL. &gt;&gt; I'm not standing on my own merit, but I'm standing on the blood of Jesus Christ. So, now we stand as though we never sin. Now, because we're standing, we stand as free men, brother Tom. Free men and women standing as children of God. standing as redeemed saints of God as the music players want to come. See, it matters where you stand. You can't stand on your own merit, brother David. Your own righteousness, it you couldn't stand on that. We couldn't stand on our own efforts. But now we have a place to stand, a platform to speak from. And on that platform, Brother Joe, you have a right to speak. Isn't that right? You know what the devil does? He tries to take that testimony out of your life. Friends, let me tell you, by the blood of Jesus Christ, he gave you a place to be able to testify, to go and speak, &gt;&gt; place to stand on, to tell what God has done for your life. Friends, nobody wants to hear you preach if you don't live the testimony that you're preaching. &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to hear you sing if you don't live the testimony that you're singing about. said, "But when you put it under the blood, then it gives you a platform to stand and speak. It gives you a platform to stand and sing because my sins have been put under the blood of Jesus Christ." He's given us a place to say, "I've been justified." Oh, friends, you ain't got a you ain't got a long enough night for me to tell you all the things I've done wrong. You do you don't have enough enough books. I I could go all day of all the things I thought, all the things went through my [music] mind. You You ain't got enough time. We're not looking at our own marriage. Quit looking at yourself. You're ugly. Quit looking at yourself. Think of it. Our our past, it's ugly. You're never going to find anything beautiful in it. It's just ugly. We have an ugly past. But we have something else to look to. Amen. The mirror of his word. He said, "If you'll stand on his word, you stand justified as though you never sinned in the first place." I don't know about you, but if I was standing here [music] and you had a word from the Lord that says, "If you'll just stand here, you can stand justified. I'd just step on over here. I don't want to stand over there where I was lost and filled with sin and oh I my my testimony is ruined but let me just as easy as you stepped over into that you can just step right back over here under the blood of Jesus. I want you to stand to your feet this evening. [music] I wonder how many say God give me a platform to speak from.

I wonder how many tonight as you bow your heads say, "Brother Matt, I pray you'd remember me." Amen. That God would give us a place to stand. And it ain't by our own merit or efforts, but God's given us a place to stand. And maybe the devil's done something. He just brings things in your testimony and brings so much condemnation in your life that you can't even go do the commission that God gave you. How can I go stand and speak? I've lost my place to stand from or I've lost my voice or I've lost my zeal to go and I just pray that God would come and restore it. You realize that [music] Satan's doing all he can to rob you of your testimony. Maybe you've had a misstep, but God is a merciful God this this evening. Say, "Lord, I pray pray you'd remember me.

If you had nothing in return, [music] but would you still worship him? And the song came to my mind while he was singing this or while he was saying that. And it says, "I love him because he first loved me and he purchased my salvation." So I I just want to sing this song right before we go. Let's just sing this just let's just put everything aside.
