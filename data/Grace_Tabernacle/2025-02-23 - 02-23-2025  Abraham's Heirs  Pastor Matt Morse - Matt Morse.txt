mistakes and Lord our flesh and Lord we just ask that you would come and anoint this word Lord and God anoint every heart every believer Lord hear such a joy in the house of God this morning and Lord we just ask you that you would come and take this word and make it alive to us we pray in Jesus name amen amen we just just want to invite you to the scripture uh we're going to read out of Galatians in the third uh chapter and we'll uh start in the 27th verse read the last three verses of the chapter give you just a moment to turn there Galatians 3 and 27 amen when you get there just say amen and Galatians 3:27 Bible says for as many of you has have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ then you are Abraham's seed and your HS according to the promise we'll just ask the Lord to add His blessings to the reading of the word as you take your seat this morning I want to speak uh today on Abraham's heirs on Abraham's heirs uh I know many of you have been uh here over the past few weeks and we've been uh speaking on this series out of Galatians the 3 chapter and uh and I trust it's been a blessing to you there's so much Revelation that just lays in this uh scripture and uh but the Lord has just really put this on my heart this morning and uh I want to take just a moment as we're speaking on this subject uh just to kind of I know there's some new people that maybe wasn't here the first service we took uh out at the beginning of the chapter we spoke on the seed of Faith how many's read through Galatians 3 over maybe some of y'all did this morning I asked the brothers to put it on the board and uh but it's been uh there's such a a revelation of of of the church and in our in our future that lays in this in this uh promise and uh but but we started this series in the in on the seed of faith and showed how that we were not uh just the children with uh promise but we were the children of promise and uh so we showed how that there was great things about being a Christian and and uh one of the great things that there was was that it didn't matter what we ever face there's always a Bible promise concerning what we face so uh if we Face bondage there's a promise concerning Deliverance if you if you face a sickness there's a promise of healing if you're lost there's a promise of Salvation so uh these are the promises of God that pertain to the believer but we realize that this morning that not only do we receive the promises of God but we are a promise of God somebody say that I am a promise so not only do we receive promises but we are a promised see for all through the scripture God has promised that there was coming a people or there would come a seed of God all through the Old Testament we saw this as it would come to place in the man Jesus and how that here he was the promised seat of God and brother Wesley he was born he was sacrificed he was buried he was raised uh raised from the dead he ascended upon high but whenever he ascended it did not end the seed line of God but the Bible says but then he poured his Spirit back upon the church I know there's many today that are still searching for that seed they're looking they're uh in Israel they're always searching history they're looking for the seed line of Abraham and trying uh to to to tie the lineage and find out their connection but uh but do you realize today that although the history of the lineages it may have been lost it remember when the temple was destroyed and all the all the books were destroyed and and they can't trace it any longer but brother Mark that seed line was not ever to carry on through is Israel it was to carry through that seed which was called Jesus and it didn't end with Jesus I I think that's wonderful because the Bible says this it said for whom he fornew he predestinated to be conformed to the image of the son that he might be what the firstborn among many Brethren that means Jesus who was Abraham's seed he was the firstborn of many there was many to come after him there was many of the Seed of Abraham that would come after this man Jesus so we realize that the seed of faith has carried on through this day and even today that that seed is still alive when you look around this building this morning that very seed that was prophesied in the Book of Genesis you see them sitting here this is what God was speaking of when he talked to Abraham this very group of people this very body of Believers of around the world today brother Mark where everyone AP part of that seed that God was speaking of to Abraham so but the Bible said that this seed is still alive it carried into this day and that very seed is what brings the word seed to life in you that very that very Faith Seed of Abraham is what brings the seed of the word of God to life and you it's what causes you to be a believer that's what makes you come here on a Sunday morning and fellowship around the word of God that's what caused you to leave all the other things and and come and find a place in God's word that you can be identified in the word of God the next service we went and spoke on being redeemed from The Curse Of God remember how the Bible says that Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law every redeemed means to regain possession that means we were lost we had to be redeemed we had to be bought back we were under a curse and and friends you know that we were every one of us were bound I I don't know about you but I know I remember what it was like to be bound but though I was bound Christ came and he set me free see I was redeemed from the curse though I was bound yet Christ came and he set me free there's a reason that Redemption means so much to the believer it's because we recognize the power that the curse had on us so it means something to be redeemed why mind what good would it do to say you're free you're free you're free if you didn't know you were bound what good would it do to say you're well you're well you're well if you didn't know what sickness was what what good would it do to say you're saved you're saved you're saved if you didn't know you were lost but you realize the only way to see the value in Redemption would be able to know how bad the curse was and because we know that curse had a hold on us and because we know we were bound to this world and we were bound to flesh and we were held down by that old curse called death but brother wesy because we know the curse then we value the Redemption that came by the blood of Jesus Christ that called me out of sin and out of the Flesh and out of the curse of death and he set my feet on a rock to stay I I'll tell you what because we know the curse that's why we rejoice in Redemption because I know how bad it was brother Mar when I deserve death but I rejoice in life I deserve hell but I rejoice in Heavenly places I know what it's like to be sick so therefore I worship god oh our friends I tell you this morning I can Rejoice because there's a breath in my body cuz God allowed me to come this morning and be able to stand before this lovely congregation there's breath in my body therefore I rejoice in my God I wonder how many come to the Tabernacle this morning say brother mat here in this place of communion in this place of Fellowship I lift my hands and I rejoice in my God I lift my voice and I rejoice in my God for the Bible says let everything thing that has a breath praise ye the Lord therefore I praise him I know what it's like to be sick so I rejoice and being well I know what it's like to be lost so I rejoice in being saved I know what it's like to be bound so I rejoice in my freedom this morning we've been set free brother Joe it wasn't by an accident it wasn't because we were lucky it wasn't by chance but it happened because we had a mediator come by the great hand of our mediator brother Mark our goal between you realize Israel had Moses but we had the man Jesus Christ he was our mediator and because we have him he set a he set apart this people to this day to be able to receive the promises of God the last service we spoke on being Faith children and how that we were children of Abraham through faith in Christ Jesus now I want to take this direction this morning here me y'all feel like preaching praise the Lord here Paul showed how the Covenant with Abraham notice wasn't based on on works but he proved by showing he proved that it wasn't based on works by showing that Abraham was called righteous before he ever performed a single act of obedience can I go here this morning you realize that here this Covenant was called an unconditional coven now I know I know there's many uh arguments about that in in the in the theologians but but you realize that that that because when you read it when you read about the Covenant the Bible actually shows that there were conditions of it how many knows that in Genesis 17 the Bible say this is my Covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised see you say well is that a condition well well it's a condition but let me show you this but re the reason it was called unconditional this is what this is the Revelation that Paul is bringing to the Gentiles it's an unconditional Covenant here they they they had been so Bound by law and so Bound by the dos and don'ts following after the the law that brother Mark they couldn't even hardly see something that could could be unconditional but Paul was bringing this to the people he said the reason it was is because when the Lord was bringing the confirmation of the Covenant remember Genesis 15 now this come after the troubled years this is after the the the great Wars that had taken place in Sodom remember Abraham and he took his servants and they went into Sodom and they fought and they and they brought lot back from captivity and after he came into this out of this battle and he sat down and he met with melaz DIC and here he had that great communion with the with the with the king of peace that had no beginning of days or or or or ending ending of days and so the Bible says but after all these things then the word of the Lord come to Abram in a vision and he said fear not Abram for I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward oh I love how God starts this conversation but you realize because Abraham had just sat down with the Kings after these great battles and here they offered Abraham rewards but he wouldn't take it I thought my wouldn't it be like kings today if you if you the one that came in and you defended them and your your your your army is what helped them here brother Mark look what they were doing they were offering rewards they were offering an alliance so Abraham you can just you can just buddy up with us and we'll just all we'll just make it and we'll form this great Kingdom but Abraham wouldn't have nothing to do with it he's said I don't want your reward I don't want nothing from you I don't want anybody to be able to say I don't even want to be able to think that it was something that I did that caused me to be who I am but I want to rely on God and God alone so when God comes to meet Abraham the first words that God says is I am thy exceeding great reward my a't that wonderful you know he wouldn't accept a reward but he said I am th I am thy reward and I am thy Shield oh my you realize that when God begins to speak to him and then Abraham he has a question in his heart and he begins to ask God here here Abraham was looking around at his circumstances and all the the things that that had gone on and he he begins to ask God and what a mess that it was brother Mark in the middle of these great battles but but he says he said Lord he said what would you give me seeing that I go childless here it was a man knowing that he had a promise of God remember from from the time that he had gone out but Lord what will you give me seeing that I go childless the only Heir that I have is a servant in my house how can he be my Heir but listen what God said he said he said but your servant shall not be thine Heir but your Heir will come forth out of thy own bows he shall be thine air see I think that's the way it is sometimes brother Mark we have to be reminded because sometimes just like Abraham we look around at the circumstances and say is this my inheritance no doubt Abraham had a right why because he was a man in flesh and sometimes we look around is this my inheritance is my sickness my inheritance is my is this cancer my inheritance is is all these things I'm going through and the the things that was handed down and the genetics of my of My Flesh is this my inheritance the way I act and and sometimes things in my in my spirit get all worked up is this my inheritance am I always going to have to be critical am I always going to have to be uh angry and upset and have these kind of feelings is this my inheritance but let me tell you something friends some things we inherit from our Earthly father and some things we inherit from our heavenly father so here Abraham he's looking around at his circumstances let me tell you but his Earthly father because of you you because of who he was you realize that the heavenly father can give you things above the ability that the Earthly father can give the Earthly father is limited our Earthly body is limited it's limited to Earthly things because of his Earthly father and because of his Earthly condition Abraham was limited in fulfilling the promise of God he was a 75 year old man he didn't have the ability to bring forth child his wife was an old woman she didn't have the ability to bring forth child why because they were from their Earthly father the genetics of their Earthly body and the genetics of a flesh body was not able to produce a promise because of that's because they were Earthly and Abraham was looking at this Earthly part and this Earthly thing and this flesh body and he was looking at the circumstances of Flesh and saying how can I bring about the promise of God for all I see is an old man all I see is the inability to bring forth children but God said but that shall not be thine inheritance see because the heavenly father can give you something greater than the Earthly father can give good to see you brother Robert the heavenly father has ability to give more than the Earthly father can give so look what God does the Bible says the angel of the Lord came to him in the middle of the night oh I can just see it can I just can I just preach it he came to him you you see the Lord come to Abraham come and just put his arm around him Abraham come out here and walk with me for a little bit watch this question it's a real concern how can I have children how how can what what will you do for me how how can I be this how can you be how can I bring this to pass and God takes him out in the wilderness and he comes out there and he says now Abraham he says look towards the heavens look up there Abraham and count the stars but what a way God has what away with words brother Mark what what what will what will my reward be what can you do for me how can I bring this to pass Abraham come here can you count those Stars imagine he was confused talking to the angel of the Lord said well certainly I couldn't count the Stars there's too many to count can you imagine his response as we would how how could we how could we count them and God said he said so shall thy seed be a't that wonderful brother Mark what will you give me count the Stars I have no air count the Stars there's no one to come after me count the Stars what will this be handed down to count the Stars count the stars for so shall thy seed be I think that's what God tries to tell us sometimes brother the cow we get to looking at our circumstances and sometimes it just takes God to come by and say look up you get to looking at the flesh how can I bring about the promise of God in my life you're looking at the wrong thing but it took God to come by an Angel of the Lord in the middle of the night to say quit looking at the circumstance and look up there's a Redemption laying there oh friend sometimes we get so caught up in it it's easy to look around but God said look up in the midst of Trials look up in the midst of tribulation look up the Bible says look unto Jesus who's the author and the finisher of our faith I thank God that we have a place to look in the middle of a hardship look to Jesus in the middle of a trial look to Jesus in the middle of when when we feel like giving up he said but look to Jesus in the middle of our sickness look to Jesus when the bills are piled up and we ain't got nobody to turn through look to Jesus who's the author and the finisher of our faith let me tell you what the devil wants you to do the devil wants you looking around at everything else he wants you focus on circumstance well I may as well preach the devil wants you looking around at all your problems and all everybody else's problems and all the church problems all the things that are going on let me tell you what the devil is he's a nosy Devil he's just like Bayo was Old King Bala when he came to Bam and said but look at Israel over here look at Israel over there is it some like some big old some big old ugly ba to stand there and point out all the problems in every other church and all the problems that everybody else had oh friends I say we ought to turn to ba and say shut your mouth I don't have to listen to that any longer the spirit of B has been by the name of Jesus Christ I'm not looking at circumstance I want to look up sometimes sometimes we just have to be reminded look up you think you don't get caught up in it sometimes we get blinded sometimes we don't see things correctly sometimes we get into total darkness but but you realize if it wasn't for Darkness you'd never appreciate the light hello sometimes we get into total darkness even God's Prophet was in total darkness we found Apostle Paul one day in total darkness his eyes were blinded but you notice what happened to Paul when he got in this state of blindness in his time of Darkness there came a man by the name of ananas he said brother Saul received thy sight in the same hour Paul said I looked up upon him is't that wonderful in the middle of in the middle of circumstances in darkness sometimes that's just what it takes it takes a man of God to come by and say look up in the middle of problems it takes a man of God like cananas to come by and say look look up you're looking at the wrong thing but just look up come out of Darkness look up receive thy side look up look past circumstances let the past be the past and look up you ain't living in the past no longer put it behind you and leave it behind you and look up God gave you a New Hope look up you don't have to go to bed with the same anxiety and the same problems and the same pressures it's behind you look up the very thing that was causing it you left out of therefore you're free this morning so look up look up man you think about Saul he could have sat there and felt bad for himself he had a right to can you imagine what it felt like to him after getting a revelation that the people he killed was the was the very was the very God that he claimed to serve after getting that revelation God I've been fighting against you this whole time and I didn't even know it he got he could have he could have felt terrible when he looked to his own life realized all this but I think one of the greatest things an and I has ever said he said brother Saul a't that wonderful when he didn't even feel like he was a part but ananas called him brother that makes me want to shout all over this building he didn't he was a murderer of Christians but an and I said brother sa other people come by and said we don't want to have nothing to do with him but an and I said brother sa he called him brother friends I don't care where you've been I don't care what you came out of I don't care how bad it was you're here now I say we called each other brother I call you sister I welcome you into the family of God said why because he was brother you know why because ananas didn't see his past he saw him as he was he was a blood-bought Son of God he called him brother brother Beni he called him brother he's a blood bought Son of God look up look up he said well I'm looking I don't see God butram said you have to have God in here to see God out there see if you haven't gotten him here you'll never see him out there realize this is what this is what Abraham had he believed the Bible says he believed in the Lord and it was counted unto him for righteousness he believed in the Lord it was counted for righteousness here is where Paul begins to show this promise of being unconditional he said see he was called righteous before he ever made a single act he was accepted by God before he made an act of obedience he believed in the Lord and he counted unto him for righteousness it wasn't an act that he done it wasn't it wasn't actions that he made it wasn't something that he went out and performed butam says see God gave Abraham a promise when he was an old man 75 his his wife 65 they were going to have a child and he made the Covenant with Abraham an unconditional Covenant and we found out by going back in the word that when God makes a covenant between him and a man man always breaks his Covenant but God always keeps his so God made this Covenant by himself he put it to Abraham he gave it to Abraham not if Abraham would do anything but God said I have done it see it's already a finished thing it's completely and wholly with Grace it's not on no conditions at all it's God's covenant with Abraham isn't that what the Bible said he said but it wasn't only for Abraham but it was for Abraham's seed after him see there was two parts of this Covenant can I get into it there was two parts of this Covenant one part was natural the other part was spiritual and the natural part the Bible would tell us that it was speaking of the Seed of Abraham it was a physical seed a material seed of course he said it was the Jewish people and the Covenant was to stay in the promised land and that God would bless them because they fulfilled the Covenant of God but then notice that how because these were God's people and brother Mark they had this Covenant upon their life but when you begin to look at the prophecy of Ezekiel and you look at the vision that Ezekiel had Ezekiel speaks of this great nation of Israel and he talks to them as being a great tree a great olive tree that would that would be planted remember in in his vision he said it would be uh planted by good soil and Great Waters it would bring forth branches it would bring bear Mighty fruit it would be a goodly Vine and he talks about this great nation that God is creating but you notice over in the book uh uh of Romans in the New Testament we find that this great this great tree that was built this is what he typed it as it was a great tree that God has planted it's great it's a goodly Vine it's producing it's manifesting but in the book of of Romans we find out that the gentile people were grafted into that very tree so this is where Paul would speak of it Romans 11:17 he said and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a Wild Olive Tree now take a moment and look at this the Wild Olive Tree what is he speaking of a wild Olive Tree was the gentile people so you see because in the ancient in the ancient agriculture a wild Olive Tree was considered to be less than a than a tame Olive Tree see it was it was unproductive when it was compared to a cultivated Olive because a cultivated Olive Tree it was trimmed it was pruned it was pruned in a way that it would bring forth more fruit anybody that knows anything about plants or trees you know that when you go and you prune them right then they'll put off more branches so a tame tree produces more fruit than a wild tree it's a it's better it's uniform it's everything in order it has great production but then Paul he begins to speak of the gentile people he said but then there's a wild olive tree that would be that that thou being a wild Olive were grafted in among them so he shows of how that that this tree was grafted in and would be a partaker Paul said of the root and the fatness of the Olive Tree now we realize that that that this olive tree that in Israel they they had they had all these Groves of Olives I mean it was a it was a great uh uh thing that they planted and and grew among them so here here as Paul would talk about this he says that we would be a partaker of the root and the fatness of the Olive Tree so in other words this Olive root think about what it represents brother Mark it is showing the root is where the life comes into the tree now where did this come in from the life it was in the tree that was planted with Abraham in other words the Covenant that God made with him that abrahamic Covenant it's the very root of the Olive Tree that's where that's what was planted it started with Abraham so if you look at this tree of Israel being an olive tree then the root of it it could or the the seed of it planted and it took root the foundation of it it was Abraham it was Father Abraham so here God had came and made this Covenant with Abraham so here Paul says that we were grafted being a wild olive tree that we were grafted among them and we are a partaker of the root and that means the very Covenant that God made with Abraham that you and I are partakers of he said and the fatness of the Olive Tree oh my that b makes me want to shout in other words the fatness or or the nutrition or the nourishment of that olive tree oh oh don't you see it here being nourished in other words brother Mark the same spiritual blessing that applied to Abraham applied to the Gentile the the same promises that flowed through that Covenant the fatness of the tree the promises of God would flow out of every Branch so if you were grafted into the Olive Tree then the very promise of God and the Covenant God made the very life that was in the root will grow out of every branch and it'll bring forth the very fruit of almighty God he said we were grafted in therefore we receive the of the fatness of the tree that means it includes the promises of God so we're a receiver of Salvation I'm a receiver of Divine Healing I'm a receiver of the baptism of the Holy Ghost because I've been grafted into the tree of God oh don't you see that the Gentile Believers by being grafted in they partake in the blessings and they become the HS of the promises of God we were grafted in the tree therefore we're the Hees of the same promise now now you remember whenever whenever Solomon was building the Temple over in Israel remember what the Bible said here when he done all the order of the Lord and he built that Great temple in Israel the Bible says then the glory of the Lord filled the temple how many remember the story I'm not going to preach I won't have time but the glory of the Lord filled the temple but in ezekiel's Vision Ezekiel watched that same Glory that filled the temple Ezekiel watch The Glory leave it and leave the city of Jerusalem and Ezekiel said it like this he said and the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and it stood upon the mountain on the east side of the city now let me ask you this how many knows what mountain is on the east side of Jerusalem it's the Mount of Olives it just happens to be the place where the olive trees were planted in Jerusalem so it's the place of all the all the Groves and here Ezekiel says Ezekiel says that the glory of the Lord left the midst of the city watch he's watching in Vision he leaves the midst of the city in other words where Solomon's Temple was where the glory of the Lord was Ezekiel said but the glory of the Lord left the midst of the city and it went up onto the mountain of Olives I thought my isn't it something to think that here God is saying when when when Israel forsakes me well then I'm going to get back to the Olive Tree cuz I got some work to do when they forsake me when they won't accept me where the glory of the Lord went he went to the olive grov why brother Marque had a work to do in the Olive Grove he said I'll cut off a branch that won't produce I'll cut off one the ones that have been broken off BBE they was broke by War maybe they was broke by ancestry maybe they was broke by false teaching but those that had been broken off that would not believe I'll Graft in another Branch that'll bring forth life it was Jesus the glory of the Lord that went into the olive trees oh let me tell you there's something special about that mountain of Olives you realize it was on the mountain of Olives that David the king of Israel whenever Absalon came in to take over and to cast him out he him being an outcast of his own kingdom he was a rejected King that was mountain of Olives was the mountain that David went up and he went up weeping and crying over what had just happened brother said see when David was rejected from his own people him being a king he went up on the hill and he looked back over the mountain of olives and being EX communicated from his own people he looked back over the city and he wept what he didn't know is 800 years later brother Wesley that the son of David would sit on the same Hill and he' be weeping because he was rejected by his own City and he cried out Jerusalem Jerusalem how often I would have hovered over you as a h does her brood but you would not the same place this rejected King David had gone Here Comes Here Comes the son of David but a mar a rejected King that went up that mountain of olives and he began to weep over Israel oh don't you realize that it was on the mountain of Olives that the Bible said Jesus spent his evenings in the daytime he preached in the temple in the night time he Abode in the Mount of Olives it was his Dwelling Place this was the place that Jesus preached the Disciples of the end time and tribulation and judgment in Matthew 24 so was on the Mount of Olivos you watch so many things that take place on this very Mountain Matthew 24 he says there's a tribulation coming that very message when was preached right on that mountain of Olives but you realize it wasn't all that happened there but also on this mountain of Olives it was the place that Jesus descended from whenever they were standing in the city of Jerusalem that day remember he came riding down on a CT and they threw their cloaks on the ground and they were crying Hosanna Hosanna it's the king of glory and they begin to shout because the King was coming down here he was riding on a cat fulfilling prophecy descending the Mount of Olives brother Mark and the in the Pharisees said would you tell them to hold their peace Jesus said if they hold their peace these rocks would immediately cry out why because they recognized who he was that was descending from off the mountain here we come down that day on the Mount of Olives we realized that after his resurrection brother Wesley when the when the disciples would go with him and here he's about to ascend into heaven you realize where it was he went up on the Mount of oliv and on the Mount of Olives the disciples followed him and when they came there the Bible says after a little while he ascend up into heaven and they stared after him into the heavens but but but these two men begin to speak to him and they they said why do you men of Galilee why stand you gazing up into heaven these angels they were many and why why stand you gazing up into heaven that same Jesus which has been taken from you into heaven shall come in like manner just as you seen him go so the very way that you seen him go up into the heavens is the same way that he'll return oh brother Mar there's so much in that you find out that in the end of the Great tribulation whenever Christ would return to the earth oh you realize that it was on the Mount of Olives where Jesus will appear Matthew 24 he said immediately after the tribulation in those days the sun would be darken and the then shall appear the sign of the sun of man in heaven and then shall the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and with great Glory Zechariah 14 he said on that day his feet shall stand on the the Mount of Olives that lies Jerusalem to the east so the very way you seen him go up is the very way he'll come down the very place they seen him go up is the very place he'll come down oh friends oh my a't that something to think about here one day that he'll come and descend right back on that same Mountain I'll tell you what my Bible says the Bible says one day at the end of this tribulation that that great mountain of Olives it'll split in two that great earthquake will take place it'll divide in two and out of the ground will come a great Mountain but say it'll be pushed up out of the earth cuz there will be no more sea and out of this great ground ground will come this great mountain right in the middle of the Mount of Oles it'll grow up to the top and Out of Heaven Will descend that man Jesus Christ and he'll sit up on his throne 1500 miles up in the air out of the ground will come the mountain and out of heaven will come the city to set up on that mountain oh friends don't you realize that here that that very place that he'll come that very place at this New Jerusalem was set that was the same city that Abraham was looking for when he went out looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God and looking for a city that had no Foundation the prophet of God said I believe it was the same place they say it was in Salem OR the near the City of Salem which became Jerusalem but in that same place that Abraham sat and met with mezc is the same place that the God will descend again upon the upon this Earth in that same place that oh my let me tell you something isn't that wonderful the same way you seen him go up is the same way you seen him go down but I got news for you brother Mark he won't be there alone can I read it for the Bible said and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds and from one end of Heaven to the other that means on that same Mountain brother Mah that same Mount of Olives here where that New Jerusalem is setting that the very Believers the the Bride of Jesus Christ those that are redeemed of God will dwell with in that City they have no sin they have no no failure there won't be no devil there to torment you there there'll be no nigh it'll be an eternal day a city where the lamb is the LI oh Hallelujah one day we're going to this place he said Jesus has gone to prepare it with the Divine hands a Divine City a Divine architect for a Divine bought people for a predestinated people he has gone to prepare you say I want to be on that mountain I don't know how how many lift your hands I'm on I want to be on that mountain I want to be I want to live in that City I want to be on that mountain I I want to send that mountain but let me show you something do you realize what was laying at the base of the Mount of Olives this is the place before Jesus's crucifixion that they came to arrest him right at the base of the Mount of Olives is the Garden of Gethsemane here is the place of self-sacrifice it's the place of surrendering to your own will brother said Jesus died more of a death in Gethsemane than he died on the cross it was a die dying out to my own flesh and dying out to my own will remember he said if this cup P could pass from me he said nevertheless let not my will but thy will be done he said oh before see before you can go to the mountain you had to pass by Gethsemane isn't that good before you can have a place on the mountain you got to have a Gethsemane you're going to have to pass by this this Place see it's a dying out to self will it's a dying out to our flesh and a receiving of the life of Jesus Christ the very place that he laid spiritually speaking the very place that he laid in the very Cross of dying out brother John every one of us have to come to that same place we had to meet God on those same grounds we have to have our own Gethsemane a dying out to our own self and our flesh in order to be able to dwell on that mountain brother BR said then all the saints that died all over the world they may have been burned they were drowned they were eat by lions everything else but they'll come forth out of every crack every crevice every corner of the world I hope I'm there I don't know where where I'll be but wherever it is if I'm in that group there's nothing that can keep me from being there and I don't have to be any certain place only place I have to be is in Christ oh my that don't don't that mess up the legalist you mean I don't have to go to your church to be saved praise the Lord no you don't only place I have to be is in Christ for those that are in Christ will bring god with him I don't care where it's at but bury me in Jesus cuz he'll bring me there we it ain't we ain't got to make our way there brother Mark we we ain't got a journey there we don't have to have a pilgrimage to get there he said just bury me in Christ Jesus and Jesus will bring me there he'll place my feet on the mountain he'll carry me up in my Dwelling Place a mansion that he has prepared for me in glory bury me in Jesus and he'll bring me there hallelujah thank you Lord bury me in Jesus and he'll bring me there said what's Paul telling that those that were outwardly was not the Jews but it was inwardly that were the seeds of Abraham for the Bible says we being dead in Christ we take on Abraham's seed and we are Hees according to the promise so see now the reason we're called Abraham's seed is because that Abraham's seed physically was speaking onto Isaac Isaac to Christ Christ came back he gave his life a ransom for us then he sent the Holy Spirit back which gives us the faith that Abraham had before he was ever circumcised he believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and then God gave him the sign of circumcision as a confirmation or a recognition of his faith see God had given him the promise because of his faith God gave him the promise because he believed but then he gave him the sign as a recognition of his faith because isn't that wonderful see so it's an unconditional promise he said therefore today when we believe God with all of our heart and accept his son the Lord Jesus and God recognizes that faith is true in him then he sends back down the Holy Spirit of promise and he seals us until the day of our Redemption my that takes all of the scare out of it hallu is't that wonderful it takes all the scare out of it he sent back his holy spirit to seal us it takes all this SC out of it says see so there's no negative thoughts in all of Christianity that makes me want to shout hallelujah there ain't no negative thought in all of Christian you know men men men make negative thoughts men are are the one that that bind people and they they hold people by their Authority and they make everything about the Bible D if you don't do this you're going to hell if you don't do this God's going to judge you and if you don't do this you're going to you're going to get a curse you don't get all this going to happen to you but there ain't no negative thought in Christianity they use negativity to bind it and to hold people they take quotes and they twist them all up to promote some negative perspective but friends today you're saved and tomorrow you're lost or as long as you agree then you're saved if you don't agree with me no more then you're lost but friends that ain't got nothing to do with Christianity for the Bible says he has redeemed us from the curse of the law you know what that means it's already done but B said everything in Christianity is past tense it's already hello somebody everything is past 10 it's already finished that means the healing is not what a man can do it's what Jesus has already done salvation is not what a man can do it's what God has already done it ain't what a church can do it's what God has already done it's a finished work and your faith in that finished work that Christ completed everything and was brought in the fall Christ redeemed it back by his atoning death vicarious suffering at calvary's Cross and he was put in the grave and God raised him up on the third day for our justification and now we see him sitting on the right hand of God making intercessions Upon Our profession for the same word is or or confession said no matter how much you pray how much you cry how much you agonize how much you do it will never be accepted right for God can do nothing for you until first by faith you just accept it believe it and confess it people agonize they cry they pray they cut theel they shout they run they do everything they can to try to be a part of God and and to be an heir of the promise of God but it don't matter how much you cry how much you agonize over it said the first thing you have to do is by faith accept the promise of God accept that I'm an heir of God accept that I'm a Seed of Abraham and then believe it with all your heart just like Abraham did he said oh thy seed shall number the stars of the heaven I believe you Lord and then made it it count him for righteous and then brother Mark you then you go and confess it I accept it somebody say I accept it I believe it and I confess it oh some of you didn't say I confess it but go ahead and confess it even if it's a whisper just barely let it out I confess that's a little bit of a confession it's still a confession if you can barely talk if you can't speak signed language I confess it it's a promise of God I don't mean that as a funny but but but but but speak it however you can I confess It Whatever language I confess it I confess it I accept it I believe it I confess it listen this is what Paul's message in Galatians 3 was about that the receiving of the Holy Spirit was a sign of true faith in Jesus Christ it was not a result of following the law so it don't matter what you're going through by faith you're a child of God somebody say by Faith by faith we're Overcomers what Jesus say he said he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son isn't that wonderful God's placed in you the ability to overcome the devil he said you know that Christ was manifested to take away our sins for in him there is no sin and whoever abideth in him sinth not for whoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God and in this Paul said in this the children of God are manifested and the children of the devil in other words that's how you tell the difference is the children of God they can't sin in other words they can't dis believe that's what sin is it's unbelief and because they're the children of God they can't disbelieve because there's a seed of God in them therefore they can't seeing so that that's why we can say it this morning let me say I believe that means I'm not a child of the devil I'm a Child of God somebody say it I'm a Child of God we're not a child of the devil we're the children of God I accept it I believe it and I confess it I'm not a child of the devil but by the blood of Jesus Christ and my faith in the power of God I accept it and confess it today I'm a Child of God in Me God's seed remains in me is the supernatural in me's the Holy Ghost In Me Is the power to overcome and I say greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world I'm a Child of God hallelujah I'm a Child of God oh let me tell you can me show you something powerful just before the musicians come you realize Abraham was dealing with these two covenants it was law and Grace but right in the levitical law of Moses but Mark God shows Israel that the abrahamic Covenant I was reading this this week about Shadow all over my actually I did a little shouting didn't about nothing I did a little but right in the middle of this levitical law of Moses God shows Israel that the abrahamic Covenant is a greater Covenant even written in the law here remember in the law of Moses it would come down from the mountain he gave them the law of God to live by what they must do what they couldn't do sacrifices that had to be made for atonement and then the Lord begins to tell them that that that despite receiving the curses for failure remember we preached a message on it but despite receiving the curses for their failure because they wouldn't keep that old Covenant but yet God would remain faithful to his people now let me show you something because when God is showing them that he'll remain faithful do you realize that the faithfulness of God was not a part of the Mosaic Covenant but the faithfulness of God came out of the abrahamic Covenant in other words God would remain faithful despite what You' done so it wasn't that wasn't Mosaic that was from Abraham and here says see it was it was God being faithful it was and so this abrahamic Covenant being unconditional the Lord was mound to protect Israel and despite their failure and to keep the because they couldn't keep the old Covenant they see they were cursed by the law they would be cursed they' go out of their borders of protection and according to the law when they got in this place out of their borders here the Bible says but if they confess Leviticus 26 if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers with their trespasses es which they trespassed against me that they also they have walked contrary to me and I've walked contrary to them and I and and have brought them into the land of their enemies if then their uncircumcised Hearts would be humbled and they would accept of the punishment of their iniquity then I will remember my Covenant with Jacob and also Isaac and Abraham will I remember and yet for for after all that when they be in the land of their enemies I will not cast them away neither will I abore them to destroy them utterly and to break my Covenant with with them for I am the Lord their God in the midst of the law here when the curse was supposed to come and here they'd be cast into the land of their enemies but here God said even in the midst of the law but if they'll hear me and they'll repent I will be I I'll remember them I'm not going to leave them in their enemies I won't cast them away I won't utterly destroy them it'll be just for a little while but I will not break my Covenant with him for I and the Lord thy God he wasn't speaking of the Covenant of Moses he was speaking of the Covenant of Abraham I will not break my Covenant I am a faithful God I'll see to it that you make it in the end oh there'll be 144,000 that'll live in that City why that God has God had made a promise to the children of Israel out of every tribe there' be those that would that would make it par think of it here in the midst of the law but Grace still stands brother say God means for people to live by Grace not by law we get so legalistic tell we well it'd be wrong for me to smoke and it'd be wrong for me to run around on my while he said but that ain't got nothing to do with it it ought to be out of love that we don't smoke because if you love God you won't do evil things because you love him too much it a well I don't go do that cuz I'll get in trouble I can't do that it'll make them mad I can't do that it's wrong to do that ain't what we're doing it's because we love God and the love of God in our hearts it keeps us away from those things and sometimes brother Mark even in all that the Sons and Daughters of God you get trapped up and you make mistakes and you fall but here our God even in the middle of the law he said but I won't leave them there forever I won't leave them in in the land of their enemy but when they call upon me I'll remember the Covenant that I have made with him and I will bring them out it's a Covenant of Grace remember that's what Dwight Moody said remember he preached on Romans 7 the story said he went out in the street after he preached the message first guy he said he goes do you know Grace the guy said Grace who he said the grace of God do you know Grace Grace who it's the grace of God you see it thrilled me when I see how that Grace separates us from the law and that what part that Grace played said see for it's by grace that we are saved not what we can do no no matter whatever we do it's not counted to us but it's Grace is what saves us and by Grace you are Sav through faith We're The Heirs of God not just Abraham but The Heirs of the seed Here We Stand today brother Wesley think about here that that that not the promise wasn't just to Abraham as the music players would come the promise wasn't just to Abraham but the promise was to The Heirs is't that wonderful here Abraham being a man of God it was counted them for righteousness he was a Believer but the promise wasn't just for him it was to his HS you know I thought about how it was that day here when God came to Abraham and he says to him take your son Isaac up on the mountain and sacrifice him to me Abraham being a faithful man obeyed the Lord and he took his son his only son the one that God had promised him the one that his heirs would come from hear this promised son Jared he walks down the path and took a journey over there to go up on the mountain then they come to this place and he turns around to the other men says you know me and the lad we're going to go up on the mountain but then we're going to come back so he goes and I can just see Abra or little Isaac just walking along with his daddy can I just paraphrase this he's walking along with his daddy a a young boy and he's as he's walking along and remember what the Bible says he looked over and they're making their way up the mountain for the sacrifice and he says Daddy I see the I see the sticks and you know I see the I see the cord I see the the parts that's used to make a sacrifice but where is the sacrifice but you realize who Isaac was he didn't even know who he was he's walking with his daddy I can just see Abraham walking with his son Lord dad where's the sacrifice what will God provide us what would God give us he just put his arm around him and say Isaac look up in the heavens can you count the Stars son daddy you know I can't count the Stars one you just see him counting one two three four five I can't count past a thousand Daddy I can't count all those Stars he said that was the same promise that God gave me he said you can't count them and so shall thy seed be you know what the Lord told me he said in Isaac shall thy seed be called so son don't you worry about no wonder
