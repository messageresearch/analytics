[59:19] earth and the time of the singing of the
[59:22] birds has
[59:24] come and The Voice of the turtle or the
[59:28] turtle dove actually is the Hebrew there
[59:30] the voice of the turtle is heard in our
[59:34] land the Fig Tree putteth forth her
[59:37] green
[59:38] figs and the vines with the tender grape
[59:43] give a good
[59:44] smell Arise My
[59:47] Love My Fair

[1:00:02] it's truly A great
[1:00:04] miracle chapter 4 verse
[1:00:11] 16 now it's back and forth between him
[1:00:15] and her he will say certain things and
[1:00:18] she will say certain things and here in
[1:00:21] chapter 4: 16 it's her now now listen to
[1:00:26] how she beckons created
[1:00:30] nature to come
[1:00:33] and reflect what he has made in her so
[1:00:37] that he can be able to enjoy the fruit
[1:00:40] of his
[1:00:41] labor awake Oh north
[1:00:45] wind and Come Thou
[1:00:49] South so she's beckoning The North Wind

[1:00:57] upon my
[1:00:59] garden and listen the reason why that

[1:01:08] want to speak to you tonight let my
[1:01:11] beloved come into his
[1:01:14] garden let my beloved come into his
[1:01:18] garden and eat his Pleasant
[1:01:23] fruits can we bow our heads together
[1:01:28] oh our dearly
[1:01:32] beloved we who were former
[1:01:36] thorns and brambles and
[1:01:39] briers and
[1:01:42] bushes we stand in your great presence
[1:01:46] tonight thanking you for what you have
[1:01:49] done for
[1:01:51] us there's not a person in this building
[1:01:54] that was Worthy
[1:01:56] of the grace that you've given to
[1:01:58] us but we know it's not because of our
[1:02:02] worthiness but because of
[1:02:04] yours but then we also realize as we
[1:02:07] read in the Book of Revelation that when
[1:02:09] you spoke to one of the church ages and
[1:02:12] you told them you will walk with me in
[1:02:16] white for you are
[1:02:19] worthy so the only worthy one that there
[1:02:23] was shared his glory and honor
[1:02:26] with this Bramble this
[1:02:29] Thorn this bush which seemed
[1:02:33] worthless and you transformed Us by your
[1:02:35] grace as we heard about it last night so
[1:02:38] beautifully expressed
[1:02:40] Lord I pray that You' take your word and
[1:02:42] speak to us tonight
[1:02:44] father May there be things of Eternal
[1:02:47] value that'll be accomplished out of
[1:02:49] these meetings as we've gathered
[1:02:51] together and we know in order for that
[1:02:53] to happen it'll take you to do it as
[1:02:58] great as some of these gifted men are
[1:03:00] and how they've studied and prayed and
[1:03:03] it still takes that divine intervention
[1:03:06] so help me tonight Lord that I'll get
[1:03:07] out of the way shut my mouth to anything
[1:03:10] that would displease you speak to us
[1:03:13] father we ask in the name of the Lord
[1:03:16] Jesus and the Saints
[1:03:18] said amen God bless you you may be
[1:03:21] seated
[1:03:32] early on in the Book of
[1:03:34] Genesis we can see that a garden has a
[1:03:39] very important place in the Providence
[1:03:42] of
[1:03:43] God man actually was made outside of the
[1:03:49] Garden of Eden and then the Bible says
[1:03:52] that God placed him in the garden so he
[1:03:56] made him on the outside and the prophet
[1:03:57] said that Eden was like a state and then
[1:04:02] the Garden of Eden would have been like
[1:04:04] a city inside the state so man was made
[1:04:09] on the outside and then brought and
[1:04:12] positionally placed in the Garden of
[1:04:15] Eden and it was a beautiful we know
[1:04:18] Paradise of God and we know that the
[1:04:21] Garden in in the Bible and the typology
[1:04:25] has such great significant stories to
[1:04:28] tell us we know that man actually
[1:04:31] forfeited his rights to
[1:04:34] godship in the Garden of Eden so if it
[1:04:37] was lost in a garden it must also be
[1:04:42] regained in a garden Adam forfeited his
[1:04:46] rights of godship in the Garden of Eden
[1:04:50] the prophet tells us in forsaking all in
[1:04:52] 1962 that Jesus forfeited
[1:04:56] his rights to
[1:04:59] sunship to become a
[1:05:01] curse for you and I where in Pilot's
[1:05:06] Hall in the garden of gimon that's right
[1:05:11] Simon which is the garden of the olive
[1:05:15] press so there the olives were put in
[1:05:18] the press and the precious oil was
[1:05:22] ground out of them to anoint a bride and
[1:05:25] his
[1:05:27] presence it makes us feel sad in our
[1:05:30] hearts whenever we read the Bible and
[1:05:33] and read the message of the hour and
[1:05:35] realize that there are billions of
[1:05:37] people that will live on the face of the
[1:05:39] Earth and they're not quickened into the
[1:05:43] same privilege that you and I have been
[1:05:46] given they will live their mortal life
[1:05:49] and some of them will go to church and
[1:05:50] some of them will be saved people but
[1:05:54] they'll never be able to walk
[1:05:56] where God has called us to
[1:05:59] walk and that doesn't make us better
[1:06:01] than them it just means we found favor
[1:06:03] in his
[1:06:05] eyes if you're familiar with this story
[1:06:07] of The Song of Solomon you know that it
[1:06:09] was Solomon out on a journey looking in
[1:06:13] a certain part of his kingdom and he saw
[1:06:16] this girl that we don't know her by name
[1:06:19] but she was called the schula might or
[1:06:21] schula
[1:06:22] Smith and she was a very poor girl
[1:06:26] and she didn't know anything about
[1:06:28] royalty she didn't dress Royal talk
[1:06:31] Royal just a very poor girl but she
[1:06:35] found favor in the eyes of King Solomon
[1:06:40] and the word shulamite is the feminist
[1:06:42] form of
[1:06:45] Solomon so it was Mr and mistress
[1:06:49] Solomon sort of like Mr and miseries
[1:06:52] Jesus Christ
[1:06:55] you imagine how difficult that it must
[1:06:57] have been for her her thinking had to be
[1:07:01] totally changed she looked at herself
[1:07:04] early on in the Song of Solomon here and
[1:07:07] she says I am black but comly and she
[1:07:11] tells us that by being out in the fields
[1:07:14] and keeping her father's flocks and how
[1:07:17] that her family was kind of abusive to
[1:07:20] her and even her siblings how they had
[1:07:23] treated her and she was look down on the
[1:07:27] Cinderella I guess we'd say of the
[1:07:29] family and one that anyone would never
[1:07:33] look at her and think that there was
[1:07:34] anything of notoriety about her that she
[1:07:36] was nothing Noble even in her own family
[1:07:39] much less that a king would fall in love
[1:07:41] with her so it must have took quite some
[1:07:45] time being in the courts of the king
[1:07:49] himself to change her sinking from what
[1:07:53] she was to what he kept telling her that
[1:07:57] he saw that she was which is not the
[1:08:00] same thing at all and the Bible we know
[1:08:04] that the Bible is silent on a lot of
[1:08:06] these things in the scripture and the
[1:08:07] prophet tells us that the Bible
[1:08:09] condenses its truths and we know that
[1:08:11] that's right and we don't really have a
[1:08:13] lot of the insight to be able to go with
[1:08:16] her when the Mighty Men took her there
[1:08:19] and when they went into the into the
[1:08:21] great Union and she became his wife and
[1:08:24] we don't we don't have much to to go on
[1:08:27] to see what it must have been like but
[1:08:30] can you imagine with me tonight what a
[1:08:32] difficult time that it must have been
[1:08:35] for her transitioning from being a woman
[1:08:39] in this very poor part of the land of
[1:08:42] Israel and she is no doubt predestined
[1:08:45] as far as what she thinks she'll never
[1:08:48] amount to anything shall never be
[1:08:50] anything maybe like some of you were
[1:08:53] were and like we were told and that
[1:08:55] would never amount to nothing would
[1:08:57] never be anything and then all of a
[1:08:59] sudden we heard something one day that
[1:09:02] called our
[1:09:04] name and it called us Beyond
[1:09:08] ourself and as she was still
[1:09:11] transitioning and we if you read this
[1:09:13] whole book sometime when you get time
[1:09:15] seven eight chapters do it doesn't take
[1:09:17] that long but you can watch as she
[1:09:20] starts responding in chapter one and
[1:09:23] then in Chapter 2 and it's like that
[1:09:25] she's becoming more revelated in her
[1:09:29] relationship to him now by the time that
[1:09:33] they they already join in Union we can
[1:09:36] see that she's she's accepting her her
[1:09:40] new given position that she has found
[1:09:44] favor in his sight but she's still
[1:09:47] trying to learn how to talk the way he
[1:09:52] talks because the way that she even
[1:09:54] relates to love even in the beginning of
[1:09:58] this book it's like that she capitalizes
[1:10:01] on her love for him and how she feels
[1:10:06] about him and she can relate easier to
[1:10:10] that and accept that easier than she can
[1:10:13] accept how he loves
[1:10:16] her and how he relates to
[1:10:20] her but you watch her and as he she's in
[1:10:24] his presence
[1:10:25] his presence is modifying and changing
[1:10:29] her more and more day by day and you
[1:10:33] imagine as she was taken into his
[1:10:37] presence and they changed her garments
[1:10:40] and the great trumpets must have sounded
[1:10:43] that day in Jerusalem and the bands were
[1:10:46] playing and the servants had brought her
[1:10:50] on his personal own buyer b i e ER and
[1:10:55] They carried her up and as he was he
[1:10:59] would have been it would have been been
[1:11:00] against a Divine protocol for him to go
[1:11:03] to her City and get her so the servants
[1:11:05] brought her to him but there was a great
[1:11:09] great noise of all the singing and the
[1:11:12] incense and all that was going on and
[1:11:15] the musicians that were playing and she
[1:11:18] was looking as she was coming outside
[1:11:20] now a country girl most of us I suppose
[1:11:22] here tonight probably country people and
[1:11:25] you can imagine now if you were leaving
[1:11:27] Walnut Ridge or
[1:11:30] Pocahontas and you were moving to New
[1:11:32] York
[1:11:33] City now if most of you feel about NYC
[1:11:37] the way I do they can keep that
[1:11:42] place as far as I concerned oh yeah but
[1:11:45] I am I am getting psyched up oh
[1:11:49] yeah to move into a city
[1:11:53] short amen
[1:11:58] Hallelujah but as as with her the king
[1:12:04] our King still has a hard time with
[1:12:09] us because uh I I don't think that
[1:12:12] probably most of us here
[1:12:15] tonight have
[1:12:18] still been totally
[1:12:21] convinced what our
[1:12:23] love and our
[1:12:26] praise and just little simple things
[1:12:29] like raising our hands and our voices
[1:12:31] and saying
[1:12:34] Jesus I love you so
[1:12:38] much and we just think what's the big
[1:12:40] deal about
[1:12:43] that do you know that angels of
[1:12:47] God cannot say that on the same level
[1:12:50] that you
[1:12:53] can to me this is why life is becoming
[1:12:58] so
[1:13:00] complex and so difficult for us as the
[1:13:04] seven seal people the people who have
[1:13:08] been in the day when the sounding of the
[1:13:10] word of God and the Mysteries that will
[1:13:12] produce a rapturing faith I'm sure most
[1:13:15] of you are not looking for another
[1:13:17] messenger an H day Prophet or whoever
[1:13:20] that's going to come and bring no surely
[1:13:22] we're beyond that right I am satisfied
[1:13:26] we have received the message of God for
[1:13:29] the last
[1:13:31] day and if Satan cannot get us sidelined
[1:13:35] on that he will try to get us so busy
[1:13:39] and so occupied not not with sin not
[1:13:43] with gambling and running slot machines
[1:13:46] and things like that just with life you
[1:13:50] be honest and say that tonight just was
[1:13:52] life and you say you never have enough
[1:13:55] time I'm still looking for them people
[1:13:58] that told me when I reached 65
[1:14:00] everything slowed down cuz I'm fixing to
[1:14:03] be 69 in a few months and I found out a
[1:14:06] long time ago they done lied to
[1:14:09] me I I'm still looking for them people
[1:14:11] trying to figure it out I fall you know
[1:14:14] I had this in my mind I I lived in
[1:14:16] Kentucky and raised the he'll be the boy
[1:14:18] and you'd see old people and you had
[1:14:20] passed by in their house and they're
[1:14:21] sitting out there on their rocking chair
[1:14:23] I mean just hanging out out and doing
[1:14:26] nothing drinking tea you know eating
[1:14:28] moon pies just doing nothing the old
[1:14:31] farmer and his over RS and and the wife
[1:14:34] you know and they' take 47 naps during
[1:14:36] the day couldn't sleep a wink after
[1:14:38] midnight of course but I mean that's
[1:14:40] what life was and I'm realizing I ain't
[1:14:42] even got a front porch I ain't even got
[1:14:45] no rocking shares that wouldn't do no
[1:14:47] good I couldn't use them if I had them
[1:14:49] and what is it am I sinning am I lying
[1:14:52] no it ain't that it's life
[1:14:55] and
[1:14:56] why
[1:14:59] why it's
[1:15:01] all to deprive our
[1:15:06] king of what you and I alone can give
[1:15:11] him remember the prophet saying it's the
[1:15:13] father he said why do you hunger he said
[1:15:15] it's the father trying to get this
[1:15:17] Revelation known to you but it's the
[1:15:20] things of
[1:15:21] life that we just get so busy
[1:15:26] notice as she
[1:15:28] says
[1:15:30] oh she calls him my beloved let my
[1:15:35] beloved come into his garden you see
[1:15:39] when we are
[1:15:40] sure that he is
[1:15:44] ours on then it will bring us into a
[1:15:48] closer Place once we realize he is ours
[1:15:54] and we we are
[1:15:58] his I don't belong to the world I don't
[1:16:01] belong to the church now I'm going to
[1:16:04] bring it down to your greatest battle
[1:16:06] you don't belong to
[1:16:08] yourself most of us can have an easier
[1:16:11] time say no to the world no to drinking
[1:16:14] but our hardest battle is saying no to
[1:16:17] us come on now you know who your
[1:16:19] greatest enemy is tonight don't you you
[1:16:21] looked at him when you combed your hair
[1:16:23] before church if you got any left I mean
[1:16:26] and when you brush your teeth that's the
[1:16:28] greatest enemy you'll ever have is that
[1:16:31] right sure we can sacrifice for our wine
[1:16:35] somebody they need somebody in the
[1:16:36] church to sweep the floor Honey I
[1:16:38] volunteered you to do that well they
[1:16:39] need somebody in the church to cook
[1:16:41] devil eggs honey I volunteered you and
[1:16:43] they're needing some kids kids I
[1:16:45] volunteered you and Dad what are you
[1:16:47] going to do well I'm I'm golfing this
[1:16:50] evening I I'm going on a fishing trip
[1:16:56] oh
[1:16:57] my you see the Revelation that the bride
[1:17:01] must come to before the resurrection can
[1:17:05] ever come to pass is our place in him
[1:17:10] amen so the bride calls
[1:17:14] herself his
[1:17:18] garden so she actually invites
[1:17:22] him notice the session that she gives
[1:17:26] him by claim is come to your
[1:17:30] garden for this is who I
[1:17:35] AML I'm
[1:17:38] Yours take
[1:17:40] me y'all remember when you gave your
[1:17:42] heart to God when you first got saved
[1:17:45] and then you got the Holy Ghost and you
[1:17:46] say man that was it I gave you my whole
[1:17:49] heart how we
[1:17:53] wish PR it ain't that
[1:17:56] easy I'll be 69 years old in July I gave
[1:17:59] my heart to the Lord when I was a 12year
[1:18:01] old
[1:18:02] boy I started preaching when I was
[1:18:06] 18 and I'm still finding there's little
[1:18:09] Corners over here a little places over
[1:18:13] there anybody in you're be honest with
[1:18:15] me tonight and say yeah that's me too so
[1:18:18] we're still giving more and more isn't
[1:18:21] it amazing is the great experiences that
[1:18:23] brother Bram had with God and yet when
[1:18:25] certain times would come in his life the
[1:18:26] opening of the seals and different
[1:18:28] things and the Lord would tell him
[1:18:30] separate yourself from these men for a
[1:18:33] visitation on a hunting trip remember
[1:18:34] that and he said the Lord was calling
[1:18:36] him for a place of more consecration to
[1:18:40] God so it's not like that we consecrate
[1:18:42] ourselves one time and that we're done
[1:18:45] with it it's like we come through stages
[1:18:48] of more and more and more and more and
[1:18:51] he said well you know it's just us and
[1:18:53] our church no you don't understand Peter
[1:18:55] James John Paul Bartholomew Matthew Mark
[1:18:59] there's millions of people that are
[1:19:01] waiting on you and I and the devil knows
[1:19:04] enough about this word to know if a
[1:19:07] mature bride does not leave this age
[1:19:11] there will be no Resurrection or
[1:19:15] Rapture all the ages for 2,000 years are
[1:19:20] waiting on you and I it ain't no wonder
[1:19:22] all hell is against us
[1:19:25] but I'm going to tell you here tonight
[1:19:27] all hell may be against us but all
[1:19:29] Heaven is behind us hallelujah all
[1:19:33] Heaven is behind this bride you are not
[1:19:36] by yourself I am not by myself we are
[1:19:41] joint hirs with Christ
[1:19:44] [Applause]
[1:19:50] Jesus Lord let my beloved want you Noti
[1:19:55] by
[1:19:57] now she's finally starting to see
[1:20:01] it that she doesn't see
[1:20:04] herself as a garbage
[1:20:08] [Music]
[1:20:10] dump you imagine the first time she said
[1:20:14] it I am his
[1:20:20] Delight he
[1:20:22] rejoices the prophet zephani says more
[1:20:25] of the most astounding statements that
[1:20:28] God said I Will Rejoice over you oh yeah
[1:20:32] and
[1:20:34] sing over
[1:20:37] you and we just look at one another you
[1:20:39] know well we're Arkansas Hillbillies
[1:20:42] y'all live y'all call this Hillbillies
[1:20:43] too these knobs and stuff okay all right
[1:20:46] and Kentucky Hillbillies and you some of
[1:20:47] you Flatlanders you know what we're
[1:20:49] talking about then we look well we're
[1:20:51] just we're just we ain't nobody listen
[1:20:54] bride
[1:20:55] it's time that your mentality
[1:20:59] changes listen the prophet tells us in
[1:21:01] Souls that are in prison now now the
[1:21:04] mind that was in Christ Jesus is in
[1:21:08] every believer and there is the
[1:21:16] soul
[1:21:18] wow we will never bring the capping of
[1:21:22] this age come on by looking at ourselves
[1:21:26] as a garbage
[1:21:31] duck so she says let my
[1:21:35] beloved come
[1:21:37] into his garden so she expresses what
[1:21:42] where' she get this at he told her this
[1:21:47] himself but the gospel must be preached
[1:21:52] but it also has to be received that's
[1:21:54] right and then fed back in the same
[1:21:58] channel what good is preaching salvation
[1:22:00] to do if nobody says hey you know what
[1:22:02] I'm lost and I want to be saved then
[1:22:04] what do they do they accept it they
[1:22:06] believe in their heart and with their
[1:22:08] mouth they confess it I want to confess
[1:22:11] I'm a sinner but I accept Jesus as my
[1:22:14] savior what good would it do if they
[1:22:16] said unto the best preachers in the
[1:22:18] world and never accepted it and
[1:22:20] confessed it come on somebody the
[1:22:23] prophet said in law in Chicago 1955 he
[1:22:26] said many people say I'm not a good
[1:22:27] Christian I ain't got much faith and he
[1:22:30] named a a few things out what they said
[1:22:32] he said you should never say that
[1:22:35] because when you say that you are
[1:22:37] talking the devil's language the devil
[1:22:40] don't always use four-letter words the
[1:22:43] devil don't always cuss but some of the
[1:22:46] devil's language is you ain't good
[1:22:48] enough you're low down you made mistakes
[1:22:52] oh come on somebody
[1:22:55] sure one of the greatest challenges I
[1:22:57] believe in this last day is for the
[1:23:00] bride to believe what God says about her
[1:23:04] above what she knows about herself we
[1:23:08] know we've got shortcomings we know we
[1:23:10] fall short of the glory of God I don't
[1:23:13] know about you I'm sick and tired of
[1:23:15] looking at myself as a landfill I ain't
[1:23:18] a landfill I'm D all right but I'm
[1:23:20] looking at that deposit down inside of
[1:23:23] my soul and say I'm not landfill I ain't
[1:23:27] full of trash I ain't full of garbage
[1:23:30] I'm full of joy and love and peace and
[1:23:33] kindness and Temperance and forgiveness
[1:23:36] and
[1:23:37] godliness
[1:23:51] hallu oh Lord help me yes
[1:23:58] L she actually invites
[1:24:01] him to come into his
[1:24:05] garden and
[1:24:07] enjoy the
[1:24:10] Delights that are in his
[1:24:15] garden can you imagine that the Lord
[1:24:19] Jesus I'm walking down through Lowe's
[1:24:21] and I need some Plumbing stuff and I I'm
[1:24:24] G to refinish a piece of wood and I need
[1:24:26] some lacquer I need this and that and
[1:24:29] the
[1:24:29] other and I'm pushing the buggy checking
[1:24:32] my
[1:24:33] list as I walk down through there the
[1:24:35] presence of God comes near me he do you
[1:24:38] that way grocery store making the bed
[1:24:40] sister frying
[1:24:42] eggs you understand what that means to
[1:24:45] him don't think it just saved you and
[1:24:48] then he's waiting to see you over Yonder
[1:24:50] he wants to spend time with you every
[1:24:53] day of
[1:25:00] and we've got so much going
[1:25:03] on and what do we do the very last words
[1:25:06] that we say at night dear
[1:25:11] God remember the rent the house payment
[1:25:15] and Lord you know 15th of of April is
[1:25:17] coming very very soon tax time and you
[1:25:19] know this is coming and Lord I need that
[1:25:21] and I need that and Lord I need that
[1:25:22] remember this person remember that and
[1:25:24] that and that and
[1:25:29] that and then what to
[1:25:31] return and get back to
[1:25:34] him you know what I like to do sometimes
[1:25:37] I like to go and just leave my list out
[1:25:40] of my prayer
[1:25:42] closet I just come to worship you I just
[1:25:46] come to tell you how much I love you
[1:25:48] well he wants to hear my needs he wants
[1:25:50] to hear my desires and my petitions but
[1:25:52] I believe I was ordained before the
[1:25:54] foundation of the world to give him
[1:25:58] love to praise him to adore
[1:26:04] him you see she she
[1:26:07] identifies this Garden that's right as
[1:26:10] not being a shared garden with the world
[1:26:14] but she gives him total possession of
[1:26:18] this Garden because the
[1:26:20] possession belongs to him by purchase
[1:26:23] come on but it's also his by sewing the
[1:26:28] right contents now this is the thing I
[1:26:30] love about the Lord that all these
[1:26:32] preachers one day will stand before God
[1:26:34] and God will they'll walk up before him
[1:26:36] and all all you lay to as well and God
[1:26:39] will not before the Judgment seat
[1:26:41] hopefully we'll all miss that but we'll
[1:26:43] stand there for rewards yes sir and God
[1:26:46] gave us strength every day of our life
[1:26:49] and the brothers preached and God gave
[1:26:51] them time to study inspiration to study
[1:26:53] gave them favor with people and God
[1:26:55] orchestrated the whole thing and then
[1:26:58] God give them the strength to preach it
[1:26:59] give them the ability to Bear the
[1:27:01] burdens of the people and their fusses
[1:27:03] and their ups and downs and ins and out
[1:27:06] and God was the one who done all of that
[1:27:08] and then they're going to walk up in
[1:27:10] front of him and he's going to turn and
[1:27:12] reward them for everything they done for
[1:27:16] him when he was the one that helped them
[1:27:19] to do it for
[1:27:22] him and going to do you the same way you
[1:27:25] lay it to he gave you strength to
[1:27:27] overcome the habits in your life and
[1:27:29] then you'll stand there before him and
[1:27:31] he'll say come in blessed of my father
[1:27:34] come in blessed of my father enter into
[1:27:36] the joys of the Lord which were prepared
[1:27:38] for you before the foundation of the
[1:27:40] world as if though you done some great
[1:27:43] something when he saved you he
[1:27:45] Sanctified you he gave you the Holy
[1:27:48] Ghost and gave you the strength to
[1:27:50] overcome and then he says now look at
[1:27:52] what I've got for you
[1:28:03] you see the shift in in this
[1:28:06] chapter it goes from her calling it
[1:28:09] which she does prior to this one her
[1:28:13] garden my garden my garden my this and
[1:28:18] my
[1:28:20] that but by now chapter four and we know
[1:28:23] that four is the number of Earthly
[1:28:27] Deliverance so now she's understanding
[1:28:31] that she is not her
[1:28:33] own and what she's even able to do it's
[1:28:36] him giving her their strength to do it
[1:28:40] so she actually calls it his so she says
[1:28:43] come into my garden so this is yours so
[1:28:46] where where did all the fruits come from
[1:28:49] now she says Let the north wind blow and
[1:28:52] then let the south wind blow
[1:28:54] and then she gives plurality to the
[1:28:56] garden and said that there's Gardens of
[1:28:58] spices so in this Garden was spices and
[1:29:02] fruits almonds all types of nuts all
[1:29:06] different things and where did all that
[1:29:08] seed come from she didn't have that come
[1:29:11] on cuz in her first life she was a thorn
[1:29:16] oh yeah in her first life in her first
[1:29:18] breath on this Earth she was born
[1:29:21] defeated born lost that sounds like me
[1:29:24] that sounds like you and then what did
[1:29:27] he do he took us and changed us and made
[1:29:31] us in his very image some of us was in
[1:29:34] such a bad shape the devil didn't even
[1:29:36] have no hope for us I love brother wend
[1:29:39] saw my TR of the Lord that gave him that
[1:29:41] song devil we're through you had all
[1:29:44] these years to do all this with and look
[1:29:46] what you made out of us and look what
[1:29:48] Jesus done in a short matter of time
[1:29:51] isn't it amazing what God has done in
[1:29:53] our life
[1:29:55] lives but somehow we're still looking
[1:29:58] I'm afraid many times in the thing with
[1:30:01] what can I do for
[1:30:03] God and we look at our works as if
[1:30:06] though but we fall so short and we do
[1:30:08] but there's no way without him helping
[1:30:11] us that we can place the proper value on
[1:30:14] the way he looks at what he gets from
[1:30:19] us on notice in chapter 6 verse 2
[1:30:25] my beloved has gone
[1:30:28] down and to his garden to the beds of
[1:30:32] spices to
[1:30:35] feed in the
[1:30:38] gardens and to gather
[1:30:42] lies so he now
[1:30:46] descends into the fruits and the nuts
[1:30:50] which we know now as a sign of
[1:30:52] age and
[1:30:54] maturity an apple tree may be there for
[1:30:57] years before it ever starts producing
[1:31:00] same with almonds macadamia nuts hickor
[1:31:02] nuts walnuts all kinds of different ones
[1:31:04] it will take them years but now she's
[1:31:06] moving up in chapter four all right to
[1:31:10] where that something is coming out in
[1:31:13] her life and she's able to look at it
[1:31:16] and finally see it
[1:31:18] herself you know maybe for years she had
[1:31:21] a little Buds and boy she shouted and I
[1:31:22] mean carried on with them Birds if Birds
[1:31:25] would make a shout what off the almonds
[1:31:27] to
[1:31:29] do oh come on somebody you realize
[1:31:32] friends that if Paul and Peter and the
[1:31:35] saints of God that have lived in the
[1:31:37] ages gone by if we could hear them
[1:31:39] speaking to us from the other dimension
[1:31:41] tonight they would be encouraging us
[1:31:44] press on children press on you children
[1:31:47] of the evening light because we are
[1:31:50] waiting on you remember when Peter left
[1:31:53] this Earth Earthly realm of mortality
[1:31:55] and mood into the sixth Dimension I know
[1:31:58] you know it already but yet Peter James
[1:32:00] John Paul all of those Brothers have not
[1:32:03] yet seen the Lord
[1:32:05] Jesus they have not yet seen the Lord
[1:32:08] Jesus it would be Unbecoming to him for
[1:32:12] them to see him in that high priest
[1:32:18] form can you imagine what we're waiting
[1:32:20] for Hallelujah we are waiting for him to
[1:32:24] change his
[1:32:26] garments to take off that Garment of the
[1:32:30] high priest Hallelujah as it did in the
[1:32:33] Song of Solomon and whenever his mother
[1:32:36] was the one who had made the
[1:32:37] embroidering and the crown and the the
[1:32:40] feast that they would have lasted for
[1:32:42] about seven days seven days when a
[1:32:45] Hebrew boy and girl would get married
[1:32:47] and whenever he was born they planted a
[1:32:48] tree for a boy when a girl was born they
[1:32:51] planted another tree for her whenever
[1:32:53] they got engaged and they'd signed the
[1:32:54] Covenant then they whenever they getting
[1:32:56] ready to consummate the wedding and say
[1:32:58] the last few verses then they would cut
[1:33:01] down his tree they would cut down her
[1:33:03] tree they would make two trees out of
[1:33:05] hers and two trees out of his then they
[1:33:08] would stretch an animal skin a tent
[1:33:11] called a
[1:33:13] hoopa they would stretch the Hoopa then
[1:33:16] the bride and the groom would step
[1:33:18] underneath there and there was their
[1:33:21] identity of their tree of life
[1:33:24] Hallelujah underneath there Hallelujah
[1:33:27] he would say to her be thou Sanctified
[1:33:31] unto me according to the law of Moses
[1:33:34] and of Israel and he would take a drink
[1:33:37] of the wine and he would give it to her
[1:33:40] then he would take the cup and crush it
[1:33:42] under his feet then he would take the
[1:33:45] bride into the bridal chamber you ever
[1:33:48] wonder why it wasn't called the
[1:33:49] bridegroom chamber you ever wonder why
[1:33:52] even in our weddings here that we don't
[1:33:54] say Here Comes the Groom skinny as a
[1:33:57] broom how come we don't sing to the
[1:34:00] groom who do we sing to the bride it's
[1:34:03] written in our culture don't you
[1:34:06] understand all of Heaven is Waiting the
[1:34:09] angels are under
[1:34:11] anticipation and they are waiting for
[1:34:14] what they are waiting for a mature Bri
[1:34:27] but we're too
[1:34:32] busy we're too busy with this and that I
[1:34:36] hate to say but a lot of times preachers
[1:34:37] are too busy trying to get everybody to
[1:34:38] see what they see arguing over this
[1:34:41] fussing over that all of us dotting our
[1:34:42] eyes and crossing our tees friends I'm
[1:34:45] afraid that we've got an image in our
[1:34:46] mind that the Apostolic Church did not
[1:34:48] have they differed in their opinions
[1:34:51] Peter even wrote things about Paul said
[1:34:53] beloved brother Paul WR things it's hard
[1:34:55] to be understood and but yet somehow the
[1:34:58] devil has tricked us and thinking every
[1:35:00] message church every message preacher oh
[1:35:03] they can't have their difference opinion
[1:35:05] and where did you get that at they're
[1:35:06] going to agree on the teaching of the
[1:35:08] word of God the message of the hour
[1:35:10] that's right I'm not your absolute
[1:35:12] brother wayang no other preacher that's
[1:35:14] not our absolute the absolute is the
[1:35:16] word of God and will we have them
[1:35:18] difference of course we will just like a
[1:35:21] family I'm the oldest of seven kids my
[1:35:23] wife is the eldest of eight don't tell
[1:35:25] me you can't have bickering
[1:35:26] indifferences in your family but they're
[1:35:28] still my family they are still my
[1:35:31] brothers and my sister come on somebody
[1:35:34] I pray that God helps us and I I don't
[1:35:37] have to just pray this way and hope
[1:35:38] it'll be but it will come to pass as it
[1:35:42] did there when the Holy Ghost fell in
[1:35:43] the book of Acts you imagine the devil
[1:35:46] coming up in the upper room and saying
[1:35:47] you got to be kidding me you mean Jesus
[1:35:50] this Mighty God has left his church in
[1:35:53] the in the charge of these men right
[1:35:55] here you got to be kidding me they can't
[1:35:57] even get along they're arguing whoover
[1:35:59] who's going to have the biggest church
[1:36:01] and who streams more and who's got more
[1:36:03] hits on YouTube come on somebody there
[1:36:07] ain't no way in the world that them
[1:36:09] people ever do anything but all of a
[1:36:11] sudden there came a sound from Heaven as
[1:36:14] of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled
[1:36:17] all the house where they were sitting
[1:36:19] what happened the bridegroom come down
[1:36:22] and got in the garden Hallelujah the
[1:36:25] bridegroom entered by his presence into
[1:36:29] the
[1:36:30] [Applause]
[1:36:36] garden I would like to have been down
[1:36:40] inhale for just a few
[1:36:44] minutes after the upper
[1:36:47] room when them demons went down into
[1:36:49] hell and say
[1:36:51] Satan we have messed up
[1:36:56] come on we we we we we thought that we
[1:36:59] had this single and he came here he
[1:37:00] lived he died he raised and we thought
[1:37:02] it was over with I'm telling you we have
[1:37:05] messed up you see the devil probably
[1:37:06] wouldn't would in the upper room he was
[1:37:08] so busy doing other things he didn't
[1:37:10] think nothing was going to go on cuz
[1:37:11] them guys kept fussing and arguing and
[1:37:13] fighting and some of them saying we've
[1:37:14] already got it brothers and other said
[1:37:16] no we ain't already got it well I'll
[1:37:17] tell you one thing you don't agree with
[1:37:19] me in my theology John well Peter you
[1:37:21] sit down I'm tell you one thing come on
[1:37:25] I hope that ain't the cause why so many
[1:37:26] preachers still fussing around the
[1:37:28] message because they lack the Holy
[1:37:30] Ghost oh
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:39] Jesus you see them when they getting
[1:37:46] up man
[1:37:50] Brothers this is that yeah Hallelujah
[1:37:54] they said you got to be kidding that
[1:37:57] people's drunk Peter didn't deny they
[1:37:59] wasn't drunk he said we just didn't
[1:38:01] drunk like you think we're
[1:38:03] drunk I tell you one thing I hear the
[1:38:05] prophet of God say we should get so
[1:38:07] drunk on the holy ghost that we don't
[1:38:09] even know what her name is we're drunk
[1:38:12] on riches we're drunk on lead to why
[1:38:15] don't we get drunk on the Holy Ghost so
[1:38:17] we can get so lost in the presence of
[1:38:21] God that we can start crying out come
[1:38:24] Lord Jesus come Lord
[1:38:28] Jesus
[1:38:31] hallelu I wonder
[1:38:34] friends I
[1:38:36] wonder as our Heavenly
[1:38:39] bridegroom waiting to hear the
[1:38:41] reciprocating cry from his bride's voice
[1:38:45] to say come Lord
[1:38:50] Jesus I'm afraid for so many years we've
[1:38:53] said said wait a little longer please
[1:38:57] Jesus I've got a few more boats houses
[1:39:00] I'd like to win wait a little longer
[1:39:04] please Jesus all right come on he has a
[1:39:08] way of making us miserable though don't
[1:39:12] he now if you'll notice it's not him
[1:39:15] pushing himself in sir he could
[1:39:19] have it was his all right
[1:39:23] but there's one thing I love about him
[1:39:25] he's a perfect
[1:39:27] gentleman he's right here in this place
[1:39:30] tonight and he will give you as much of
[1:39:33] him as you will allow him to
[1:39:37] do and if you're afraid ofc like me or
[1:39:39] some of the rest of these Pentecostal
[1:39:41] people over here you know and you're so
[1:39:44] afraid you're terrified oh what if I
[1:39:46] would act like that what if I what if I
[1:39:48] would I don't care however he wants to
[1:39:51] bless
[1:39:52] me go you see by him blessing me if I
[1:39:54] look at it the right way I'm actually
[1:39:57] blessing him
[1:40:01] back see that's so hard for us to
[1:40:03] comprehend because it's our thinking of
[1:40:06] ourselves what what can I give
[1:40:09] him come
[1:40:13] on sh she says he's gone down into his
[1:40:18] garden he's gone down yes into his
[1:40:23] garden
[1:40:25] so the groom's Union with the
[1:40:29] bride produces this phrase that is
[1:40:33] written about her in chapter
[1:40:36] 4 my
[1:40:38] garden my
[1:40:41] sister my
[1:40:44] spouse so he actually calls the bride
[1:40:47] his
[1:40:51] sister you didn't know that well that's
[1:40:53] that's in your
[1:40:54] Bible look turn look if you want to I
[1:40:57] don't
[1:40:57] care my sister my
[1:41:02] spouse don't youy to understand what
[1:41:04] makes you different than church
[1:41:09] members you and Jesus have got the same
[1:41:11] daddy that's right and it ain't
[1:41:18] Joseph Lord God children what our
[1:41:21] brother talked about last night it's not
[1:41:23] this yes it's not this year this is only
[1:41:25] the dirt but we keep focusing on this
[1:41:28] one are we ever going to get past this
[1:41:30] and look at on the inside of you is a
[1:41:32] representation of almighty
[1:41:38] God come on come on my beloved has gone
[1:41:42] down into his
[1:41:45] garden to the beds of spices you see
[1:41:48] when he joins with
[1:41:50] her then she becomes a garden
[1:41:55] enclosed which would
[1:41:58] be quite easy to understand when you
[1:42:01] look at what would have been in that
[1:42:03] Mediterranean area and I've been
[1:42:06] there I know was foxes as you know the
[1:42:09] little foxes that spoil the vines you
[1:42:11] remember that in the
[1:42:12] scripture there would be jackals there
[1:42:15] would be different animals so what good
[1:42:17] would it do to have all of this garden
[1:42:20] and all this work and all this money
[1:42:22] tied into it and then not have it
[1:42:26] enclosed in a
[1:42:29] wall so the wall when the Wall comes and
[1:42:34] seals her
[1:42:36] Hallelujah so she's an open work until
[1:42:41] she gets
[1:42:42] sealed so she can have Great Tribulation
[1:42:45] or great trials and Jubilation and
[1:42:47] trials and test and all all this can go
[1:42:50] on and her fruit is there yeah glory to
[1:42:52] God thank you Lord Jesus but because
[1:42:54] she's not enclosed yet her Joy can
[1:42:56] Trickle and get away from her so quick
[1:42:58] and she's up and down and in and out so
[1:43:00] he wants to come down and join together
[1:43:03] with her in a union and when he does he
[1:43:06] completes the wall around her and
[1:43:09] encloses her inside the wall now you see
[1:43:11] this is one thing that separates us from
[1:43:14] the rest of the world and the rest of
[1:43:16] the world look at us they look at our
[1:43:18] youth and our our sisters and they look
[1:43:19] at them and they say poor old things
[1:43:21] them poor little old girls look at them
[1:43:24] look at them poorly little things most
[1:43:26] of them ain't never had the haircut they
[1:43:28] ain't never had them p pink lips and my
[1:43:31] goodness purple hair and green hair and
[1:43:33] look at them poly those things I feel so
[1:43:36] sorry for them look at them women got
[1:43:38] that long hair and why're they're held
[1:43:40] in a prison well you see what they're
[1:43:42] looking at they're looking at our
[1:43:48] wall but they don't realize what that
[1:43:50] wall is to them it's a prison to us it's
[1:43:56] an enclosure of
[1:43:58] safety hallelujah our souls are sealed
[1:44:03] in behind the wall of the Holy Ghost it
[1:44:07] keeps the Coyotes out it keeps the foxes
[1:44:11] out it keeps the jackles out amen thank
[1:44:15] God for a wall around the bride a wall
[1:44:19] of
[1:44:20] separation that separates us from the
[1:44:23] world we don't want to look like the
[1:44:25] world we don't want to act like the
[1:44:26] world we don't want to talk like the
[1:44:29] world and we don't do it because this
[1:44:31] legalism we could go out if we want to
[1:44:34] but we don't want
[1:44:36] [Applause]
[1:44:41] to I'm going to tell you tonight I've
[1:44:43] got all the girlfriends I

[1:47:17] come on I'll tell you one thing a lot of
[1:47:21] I think sometimes demons in some way has
[1:47:23] got more sense than a lot of Christians
[1:47:24] a lot of Christians get discouraged and
[1:47:26] they do one of the worst things they can
[1:47:27] do to stop going to
[1:47:29] church every time demons come to church
[1:47:31] they get whooped they get wore out you
[1:47:33] imagine the devil every message church
[1:47:36] that dude goes to and the anointed men
[1:47:37] of God they get out there they expose
[1:47:39] him they tear the hide off of him they
[1:47:42] call him the offest bunch of names that
[1:47:44] ever was and he comes back every service
[1:47:46] he's the most faithful member I've got I
[1:47:48] preached to him for years and years I've
[1:47:50] told him everything I've told him he's
[1:47:52] going to hell he'll nod his head and
[1:47:53] said that's right I'm going to hell ony
[1:47:55] you're alive I'm alar that's right you
[1:47:58] you low down no good for nothing you're

[1:48:04] night Donnie well you come back devil
[1:48:05] I'm going to burn you hide but at least
[1:48:07] he's got enough sense to come back
[1:48:09] because maybe he's thinking he can read
[1:48:11] in the back of the book just like you
[1:48:12] and I can he sees where he's going to
[1:48:15] wind up you can read in the back of the
[1:48:17] book and see you win and you act like
[1:48:20] the loser you act like the loser you're
[1:48:23] not the loser we are the winners by the
[1:48:27] power of Jesus
[1:48:29] [Applause]
[1:48:39] Christ Glory look what he
[1:48:41] does my beloved is gone down into his
[1:48:47] garden to the beds of
[1:48:50] spices to feed
[1:48:54] Lord have
[1:48:56] Merc to
[1:48:58] feed in the
[1:49:01] gardens to refresh
[1:49:03] himself and Delight
[1:49:07] himself how it must please
[1:49:09] him when you have a petition on your
[1:49:12] heart and you're so hoping he'll say
[1:49:16] yes but instead he gives you a flat
[1:49:20] no and gives you no
[1:49:24] explanation and it absolutely breaks
[1:49:26] your
[1:49:30] heart but you still have spices to offer
[1:49:45] toall my beloved has gone into his
[1:49:47] garden to the beds of spices this kind
[1:49:50] of Christian I want to be yes sir I
[1:49:52] don't want to have just a little tiny
[1:49:53] pot about that big you know I know it's
[1:49:55] getting close to Springtime and I've
[1:49:57] already seen the Bonnie plant truck out
[1:49:58] and about you know going to Lo here and
[1:50:00] there but I I don't want to be a kind of
[1:50:02] Christian like this I've got a little Tu
[1:50:03] but two inch plot in my life and I've
[1:50:05] got just barely enough joy to keep from
[1:50:07] being stinking miserable and I've got
[1:50:09] just enough forgiveness to forgive
[1:50:11] brother Wayne if he trespasses me not
[1:50:12] much not much excessive
[1:50:16] forgiveness glory to God I'm going to
[1:50:18] heaven Hallelujah well I hope not like
[1:50:21] that cuz I don't want to go to Heaven if
[1:50:23] you're going to be there like
[1:50:27] that but wouldn't it be awesome
[1:50:31] today if in your soul there would be a
[1:50:33] bed just an entire bed of
[1:50:40] forgiveness I ain't talking about being
[1:50:42] able to forgive those that you
[1:50:47] [Applause]
[1:50:50] like a matter of fact brother tells us
[1:50:53] eternal life is living for others and he
[1:50:56] said that's not living for the man that
[1:50:58] loves you but that's actually living for
[1:51:00] the man that would kill you if he
[1:51:10] could praise the
[1:51:12] Lord how many beds we
[1:51:15] got how many plant with well do we at
[1:51:19] least have some
[1:51:21] hope Hallelujah come
[1:51:23] on so you imagine you've got a bed of
[1:51:26] forgiveness and a bed of mercy and
[1:51:29] longsuffering and gentleness and
[1:51:31] kindness and the miraculous part about
[1:51:33] it is that don't run in your
[1:51:37] family cuz natur by GNA and genetics it
[1:51:40] may run in your family to carry grudges
[1:51:43] forever I mean anybody does anything
[1:51:45] against you you don't never forget
[1:51:47] them but all of a sudden the Lord God
[1:51:50] comes down inside of your heart
[1:51:53] and does something to change you and out
[1:51:56] of there start
[1:51:58] sprouting all these plants of
[1:52:02] forgiveness and mercy and kindness
[1:52:05] tenderness and gentleness and godliness
[1:52:07] and brotherly
[1:52:11] kindness my beloved has gone down into
[1:52:14] his
[1:52:16] garden to the beds of spices to
[1:52:20] feed in the gardens
[1:52:25] and
[1:52:25] together
[1:52:27] lies oh come
[1:52:32] on to crop them with the hand so this is
[1:52:35] what the word means to crop them the
[1:52:40] lies with the
[1:52:43] hand the L unlike an acacia
[1:52:46] tree which has quite a long
[1:52:50] lifespan it's not like the bris Kong
[1:52:52] Pine out in Arizona and some of the
[1:52:55] great gigantic Forest of the great
[1:52:58] Sherman Pines in
[1:53:00] California but the Lily has a very short
[1:53:05] lifespan but I want you to notice how
[1:53:07] that she sees him as he moves among the
[1:53:11] spices and he moves among the nuts and
[1:53:14] all the plants that's in her
[1:53:16] life but she notices that he has this
[1:53:19] particular interest about lies
[1:53:25] you see this is what children of God are
[1:53:28] compared to once that finish work of God
[1:53:32] is able to be made manifest in their
[1:53:34] lives so the Lord Jesus transforms them
[1:53:37] from as I said thorns and brambles and
[1:53:41] BRS and nettles and all those types of
[1:53:46] things and then out of the ground comes
[1:53:48] forth this
[1:53:50] little beautiful Lily
[1:53:58] but we know that the lifespan of the
[1:54:00] Lily
[1:54:02] is all in the hands of the
[1:54:06] maker I preached the funeral just the
[1:54:09] other day at the church
[1:54:10] and one of our sisters that went on to
[1:54:13] meet the
[1:54:15] Lord and they had these beautiful
[1:54:18] flowers on the grave on the casket so
[1:54:21] when I walked away
[1:54:23] and one of the brothers from the church
[1:54:25] works for that funeral home and he said
[1:54:27] brother Donnie these flowers will be
[1:54:28] ruined tonight they'll be killed he said
[1:54:31] you think I should ask some of the
[1:54:33] people if they'd want them I said yeah
[1:54:35] maybe maybe Brother
[1:54:36] Louie so Brother Louie asked my wife
[1:54:39] Carol and asked different ones and Carol
[1:54:41] gets a lily maybe a hydrangea was it
[1:54:43] Carol something three or four different
[1:54:45] things it just absolutely beautiful
[1:54:48] breathtaking in
[1:54:50] Beauty and when we left on this trip we
[1:54:53] went through Kentucky to see Carol's mom
[1:54:55] we left him in
[1:54:57] water in the kitchen by the kitchen
[1:55:02] window but when we get back
[1:55:05] home they will be drooped over
[1:55:09] dried they look
[1:55:12] terrible but I'm so glad that when the
[1:55:15] Great
[1:55:16] Master produces a lily of a child of God
[1:55:22] and he looks at their life at when they
[1:55:24] come to maturity in his eyes not always
[1:55:31] ours that he passes down through the
[1:55:33] garden of the Bride now remember what
[1:55:35] I'm preaching about tonight is you as a
[1:55:37] bride collectively around the world you
[1:55:40] as a bride that come here to this church
[1:55:42] and wherever Church you go to but also
[1:55:44] you as an
[1:55:45] individual but also gathered in the
[1:55:47] sixth
[1:55:48] Dimension come on I know you're aware of
[1:55:51] this we're getting more and more and
[1:55:54] more on the other
[1:55:56] side before long there going to be more
[1:55:59] there than they are
[1:56:05] here it happened to
[1:56:09] [Music]
[1:56:11] us be two years on
[1:56:14] October when the Lord reached
[1:56:17] down and picked a little
[1:56:21] Lily out of the flower garden of his
[1:56:25] bride when she was born her mother and I
[1:56:27] named her Erica Lee
[1:56:31] Reagan little old thing was mean on a
[1:56:33] copperhead when she was a little
[1:56:35] girl sneaking
[1:56:39] mean but when the bridegroom come
[1:56:43] down and built a wall around her and
[1:56:47] transformed her right I've seen her
[1:56:51] little life
[1:56:53] be effective so much to people around
[1:56:56] the world that never even better and for
[1:56:59] those of you that prayed for thank
[1:57:01] you in my eyes it was not
[1:57:04] time in her mama's eyes her husband's
[1:57:08] eyes two sets of beautiful twin
[1:57:12] girls 15 months
[1:57:17] apart but Papa come down and took that
[1:57:20] Lily and said you're
[1:57:24] mature you're
[1:57:26] mature she trusted him she believed him
[1:57:31] my son-in-law Lance told me the night he
[1:57:32] said brother Donnie I have such a hard
[1:57:34] time with some of the songs we sing at
[1:57:36] church he said because them were the
[1:57:38] same songs and he said I'd walk in the
[1:57:40] bedroom and she'd be laying in there
[1:57:42] hard enough strength to even get up out
[1:57:44] of the bed but she'd be laying there
[1:57:47] with her little hands raised up to
[1:57:49] heaven worshiping God and tears flowing
[1:57:51] down her
[1:57:53] us God still gathers the
[1:57:58] lies it might be an 18year old girl and
[1:58:01] we look and say no God no it's premature
[1:58:03] it's premature I can't believe that
[1:58:05] friends I cannot believe the devil can
[1:58:09] sneak one over on God and take my
[1:58:12] daughter your daughter your mother your
[1:58:14] father oh I'll tell you one thing I
[1:58:17] always go back to that sermon I know in
[1:58:20] 1960 oh you talking about it in
[1:58:22] encouraging one and it gives me that
[1:58:24] confidence brother Donnie do you
[1:58:25] understand I don't understand it looks
[1:58:28] like to me that them girls needed their
[1:58:29] mom more than ever before 18 and 16 they
[1:58:32] need their mama how can their
[1:58:34] grandparents try to raise them I don't
[1:58:36] know but I know my God makes no mistakes
[1:58:40] and this is what I've offered him oh
[1:58:43] Hallelujah during this time out of the
[1:58:45] bed of my garden love and praise and
[1:58:48] adoration I don't understand I don't
[1:58:51] know why and I I asked him and I asked
[1:58:54] him and he broke my heart but you know

[2:00:26] to start counseling

[2:00:48] to me just like he does to you he loves
[2:00:50] you so much yeah again you don't know
[2:00:53] what it's like you hear the testimonies
[2:00:55] turned in at the church they played a
[2:00:57] short video here just a few weeks ago of
[2:01:00] a man that wasn't even a message
[2:01:02] believer one in a million people care
[2:01:05] one in 10 million people had this rare
[2:01:07] form of whatever it was a
[2:01:09] Baptist rode him up in a wheelchair and
[2:01:12] we laid our hands on him and then they
[2:01:15] sent a video back where the man was
[2:01:16] sitting up at his at his table around
[2:01:18] the table with his wife praising
[2:01:20] God now that's wonderful isn't it but
[2:01:23] you know what the devil does to you you
[2:01:25] know what he done to me sitting back in
[2:01:26] the office come on ahuh now you said he
[2:01:29] loved
[2:01:31] you well explain that to me Preacher
[2:01:35] Man you pray for that man he wasn't even
[2:01:37] a
[2:01:38] believer and God heard your prayer and
[2:01:41] answered your prayer and done a miracle
[2:01:44] and your daughter needed one and he
[2:01:46] slammed the door in your
[2:01:49] face no he didn't
[2:01:52] no he didn't he just answered in a
[2:01:53] different
[2:01:54] way I wanted to nurture the Lily and God
[2:01:57] wanted to pick the Lily and God took the
[2:02:00] Lily home come on S maybe you're sitting
[2:02:02] here tonight and you're still wondering
[2:02:04] and questioning what about this one what
[2:02:05] about that one yeah I go right back to
[2:02:08] that little stat clap baby and I've read
[2:02:10] the devil that quote on you better over
[2:02:12] and over again and that sister later she
[2:02:14] said brother bam did I have enough Faith
[2:02:16] he said Oh Sister you had great faith
[2:02:19] cuz when God said no you still believed
[2:02:23] him let me tell you young people
[2:02:25] whenever you're going through hard times
[2:02:27] and maybe you come to the service and
[2:02:29] you say God if you don't help me I can't
[2:02:30] make it another trial and the devil will
[2:02:32] fight you with everything that he's got
[2:02:35] and it seemed like God don't love you
[2:02:36] but stand your ground brother Donnie
[2:02:39] what what advice should would you give
[2:02:40] me praise him like you've never praised
[2:02:42] him before love him like you've never
[2:02:45] loved him before because that ministers
[2:02:47] to Jesus and it absolutely proves to
[2:02:51] Satan that there is a people on the
[2:02:53] Earth in the last day that love him more
[2:02:56] than Mama more than daddy more than
[2:02:59] their own life they're going to praise
[2:03:02] him and say Jesus I give you
[2:03:05] [Applause]
[2:03:15] praise you see when that little Lily
[2:03:17] comes
[2:03:22] to that full
[2:03:27] ripeness at the age of three five 10
[2:03:31] 20
[2:03:33] 44 and he
[2:03:36] says come
[2:03:39] on you see I saw what that cancer devil
[2:03:41] done to my
[2:03:45] daughter her long beautiful hair hanging
[2:03:48] way down
[2:03:50] here I saw what that chemo
[2:03:53] done I saw what them steroids done to
[2:03:56] her
[2:04:00] face and let me warn cancer tonight
[2:04:04] you've got one mad preacher on your
[2:04:18] hands and it robbed her of her beauty
[2:04:24] when her hair started falling out big
[2:04:26] handfuls and her husband got scissors
[2:04:29] and finally just cut it all
[2:04:32] off she wept and she
[2:04:36] cried but you know what we done we loved
[2:04:41] him we praised
[2:04:43] him you understand sometimes you can't
[2:04:46] shout yourself out of a battle sometimes
[2:04:48] you can't run out you ain't got enough
[2:04:49] strength but sometimes you praise
[2:04:52] yourself out you just say Lord the Lord
[2:04:55] give and the Lord took away blessed be
[2:04:57] the name of the
[2:04:58] Lord hallelujah hallelujah how many
[2:05:02] wants to be that kind of a Christian
[2:05:04] that the Song of Solomon is writing
[2:05:06] about when you're going through hell oh
[2:05:08] I hear the prophet say Lord you have
[2:05:10] broken my heart over and over again but
[2:05:14] I thank you for it it don't take much to
[2:05:17] praise God when God answers your prayer
[2:05:19] immediately and God gives you a miracle
[2:05:22] but what if God says no and God leaves
[2:05:24] you in a trial oh my friend think of
[2:05:26] brother Ron Spencer all the people that
[2:05:28] he's prayed for around the world and
[2:05:30] God's done great things and look at
[2:05:32] himself still fighting this battle
[2:05:34] brother Daryl ward has prayed for so
[2:05:36] many people around the world and he was
[2:05:37] out here visiting you
[2:05:40] all one time and called me crying laying
[2:05:44] in the motel floor because he had so
[2:05:47] much pain in his back laying in the
[2:05:49] floor of the hotel and he's legs up on
[2:05:52] the bed and said Brother D I don't think
[2:05:53] I've got enough strength to get to
[2:05:55] church WIll you pray for me yeah but you
[2:05:58] know what God done God moved for him and
[2:06:00] he come right to church and preached and
[2:06:01] blessed you Hallelujah why because he
[2:06:05] offered God spice of sacrifice he
[2:06:08] offered God nuts of praise and he
[2:06:11] offered God That Glory but did God heal
[2:06:14] him
[2:06:18] no he's still dealing with it
[2:06:22] come
[2:06:25] on so just in case you're wondering do

[2:08:46] released from the sixth dimension
[2:08:52] hu and the prophet going beyond the camp
[2:08:54] 1964 said think of it missing
[2:08:59] people they can't find you
[2:09:02] anymore but you're getting together with
[2:09:04] the rest of the group and together you
[2:09:08] come up missing on the Earth right now
[2:09:11] that sounds like fun to
[2:09:13] me yes
[2:09:16] sir oh you talking about that devil he
[2:09:18] laid a trap for you and a snare for you
[2:09:21] and on Monday morning he's going to set
[2:09:22] it and God has Monday morning time for
[2:09:25] the Rapture and the devil said yep I've
[2:09:27] got it set for that old boy today and
[2:09:30] God says yep I've got it set for my
[2:09:32] whole church today and all of a sudden
[2:09:34] the Devil comes up to you man he's
[2:09:35] fixing to bother you and all of a sudden
[2:09:38] you're wof you're gone and the devil
[2:09:41] said which way did he go which way did
[2:09:43] he go I don't know what happened he was
[2:09:46] there and now he's gone where are we we
[2:09:48] are missing on the earth Hallelujah
[2:09:51] getting together with the rest of the
[2:09:53] group why because the bridegroom is
[2:09:57] gathering his
[2:09:58] lies oh Hallelujah he's going to
[2:10:03] gather his bride
[2:10:12] Garden hallu I am my
[2:10:16] beloveds the Hebrew of that is literally
[2:10:20] I am full
[2:10:22] for my beloved oh
[2:10:27] yeah notice on Song of Solomon chapter
[2:10:29] 2: 16 the way in her young state that
[2:10:32] she identifies her attention and
[2:10:34] affection to him my beloved is
[2:10:37] mine and I am his he Feed Us among the
[2:10:42] lies so now she grounds her
[2:10:45] convictions more on his love toward her
[2:10:49] instead of her love toward him
[2:10:53] oh oh thank you
[2:10:56] Lord let my beloved come into his
[2:11:00] garden so while the spices of the Lord's
[2:11:04] Garden are manifesting
[2:11:07] themselves and one day it will be as we
[2:11:09] have
[2:11:11] read let me read it to you again and
[2:11:13] we'll we'll
[2:11:14] close Song of Solomon chapter 2 verse
[2:11:18] 10 my beloved spe
[2:11:22] and said unto
[2:11:24] me rise up Hallelujah my
[2:11:29] love my fair
[2:11:32] oneise and come
[2:11:36] away and the dead in Christ shall rise
[2:11:39] first yes sir and we which are alive and
[2:11:42] remain shall be
[2:11:46] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[2:11:49] an eye Paul goes on to say for we
[2:11:51] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[2:11:54] then which sleep in Jesus will God bring
[2:11:56] with him when he comes I love the way he
[2:11:58] says it there in Corinthians then will
[2:12:00] be brought to pass the saying death is
[2:12:03] swallowed up in Victory what you think
[2:12:05] now wait a minute wait a minute why
[2:12:06] didn't Jesus fulfilled that verse come
[2:12:10] on come on that verse is left that's
[2:12:15] right for the
[2:12:19] shulamite what have you Paul had of the
[2:12:22] resurrection and yet he applied that
[2:12:25] when we are
[2:12:26] raised that's when death will be
[2:12:29] swallowed up in
[2:12:32] Victory it will be something like has
[2:12:34] never been before all over the face of
[2:12:37] the Earth India Africa Malaysia in the
[2:12:42] islands brother Andrew where you going
[2:12:44] next week all over the world I've stood
[2:12:47] in many of those places that didn't have
[2:12:48] electricity in their home a dirt floor
[2:12:52] mud walls in their church and when the
[2:12:54] rains come it washes their walls away
[2:12:58] and then they have to put the mud back
[2:12:59] up
[2:13:00] again but yet they had received the
[2:13:03] pearl of great
[2:13:05] price and I packed them little you know
[2:13:09] computer things and all that you would
[2:13:11] have think I gave them gold
[2:13:13] bars right to bring them message discs
[2:13:16] and and books and church AE books or
[2:13:18] seal books and you think oh my it's just
[2:13:21] like you brought on
[2:13:22] gold it was more precious than gold
[2:13:26] that's
[2:13:28] right what about it
[2:13:31] friends what about it are we thinking
[2:13:34] like wife on talking like
[2:13:37] wife acting like wife or are we still
[2:13:41] acting like slaves you remember the book
[2:13:44] of Exodus whenever God told Moses tell
[2:13:46] Pharaoh right tell Pharaoh let my
[2:13:53] son
[2:13:57] go now you see if God did not Elevate
[2:14:01] Israel plac ped a state of
[2:14:05] slavehood it was against the law to
[2:14:08] steal another man's
[2:14:10] slave God was not stealing
[2:14:13] Israel he raised their position that's
[2:14:16] right and said Israel is my son
[2:14:21] oh yeah so that changes everything
[2:14:23] that's
[2:14:25] right
[2:14:27] hallelujah
[2:14:28] hallelujah oh the devil claimed you but
[2:14:31] he couldn't see that seed that God put
[2:14:34] down
[2:14:35] inside 1965 now many of you can
[2:14:38] fellowship with me on this thought when
[2:14:40] you was a little boy or a little girl
[2:14:42] there was something in you when you was
[2:14:44] a child you'd go to school and things
[2:14:47] like that and people would do other
[2:14:48] things and it just seemed like you
[2:14:50] couldn't do it it was that little
[2:14:52] representation from God it was there in
[2:14:55] you as our brother read it last night
[2:14:57] God spoke your name before the
[2:14:59] foundation of the world listen to me
[2:15:01] children my name is not just in the Book
[2:15:04] of Life my name is in the Lamb's
[2:15:07] Personal Diary which is identified as
[2:15:09] the Lamb's Book of Life you see God gave
[2:15:12] adam that Lamb's Book of Life and you
[2:15:14] and I should have come by a spoken word
[2:15:16] birth spoken word original seat 1962 the
[2:15:19] prophet said that Eve should have given
[2:15:21] birth to Isaiah she should have given
[2:15:24] birth to Christ she should have given
[2:15:25] birth to me but she bypassed that and
[2:15:28] gave birth to Cain instead of Christ and
[2:15:31] that's what a lot of the churches have
[2:15:32] done down Through the Ages they've given
[2:15:34] birth to a Cain a denomination onstead
[2:15:37] of Christ may God help us that we don't
[2:15:40] do the same thing why would we forfeit
[2:15:42] Christ for Cain why would we forfeit oh
[2:15:45] my a move of man which is nothing but
[2:15:48] death and we would trade off life
[2:15:53] hallelujah hallelujah and once God come
[2:15:57] back with that word through his
[2:15:59] prophet and the prophet positionally
[2:16:02] placed them by the word of God for that
[2:16:04] day
[2:16:06] Israel is my son oh
[2:16:10] yeah well you know what they could act
[2:16:13] different you imagine how hard that was
[2:16:15] to transition your mind from being a
[2:16:17] slave crack that whip you hear that whip
[2:16:20] cracked you jump
[2:16:21] whatever they said do you do it right
[2:16:23] but all of a sudden you catch a word
[2:16:25] from God from a prophet don't you
[2:16:27] understand why this message is so
[2:16:29] valuable to US list let's not think it
[2:16:31] what is something gone by you know
[2:16:32] something like a commentary it ain't a
[2:16:35] commentary it's a message that God sent
[2:16:37] us why help shape and change our
[2:16:41] thinking that's right come on you are
[2:16:46] what you
[2:16:47] think and if you think you'll never
[2:16:50] amount to anything you won't believe me
[2:16:53] I've lived with that much of my life
[2:16:55] come on
[2:16:57] brother my daddy told me that over and
[2:16:59] over again Donnie you'll never amount to
[2:17:03] nothing you'll never be
[2:17:06] nothing and it's amazing when I get down
[2:17:09] and get discouraged and get weary that
[2:17:12] I'll still think them same thoughts
[2:17:14] after all these years
[2:17:17] why to more seeds some here Y come on
[2:17:23] and it's easy to fall
[2:17:26] back so we fight through
[2:17:29] it if Donald Trump could get shot in the
[2:17:31] air and scream fight fight fight what
[2:17:34] about you
[2:17:35] bride and know I didn't vote for him I
[2:17:37] don't vote what I do to I voted for
[2:17:41] Jesus but if a man could stand up like
[2:17:44] that and say fight fight fight what
[2:17:46] about it young people can we stand and
[2:17:49] say fight fight fight we'll fight
[2:17:51] against sin we'll fight against
[2:17:53] compromise we'll fight against unbelief
[2:17:56] we'll fight against our schedules being
[2:17:58] so busy we're going to worship we're
[2:18:01] going to praise we're going to love him
[2:18:04] I'm going to love him when I'm down I'm
[2:18:06] going to praise him when I'm
[2:18:09] weary it's my god hallelu let's Stand

[2:18:30] love my fair one and come away for L the
[2:18:35] winter is passed now remember there'll
[2:18:38] be no winter in the
[2:18:41] Millennium winter is God's curse on the
[2:18:45] earth in the Millennium it'll be
[2:18:48] gone imagine Jesus speaking this to his
[2:18:51] sweetheart for Lo the winter is passed
[2:18:55] the rain is over and gone the flowers
[2:18:58] appear on the
[2:19:00] earth and you think you've seen
[2:19:02] beautiful flowers now oh my Carol had a
[2:19:05] sister that she loves so dearly fleshly
[2:19:10] sister they nearly killed her with with
[2:19:13] chemo and she went out of her
[2:19:16] body and she told her husband tell Carol
[2:19:18] and brother Donnie I love them
[2:19:23] and she went into this into this
[2:19:27] land she never did like certain colors
[2:19:30] of
[2:19:31] flowers but when she got there those
[2:19:33] colors were there and she liked
[2:19:38] them and the sky was so blue and the
[2:19:42] yellows were so vibrant yes and the Reds
[2:19:45] and the
[2:19:48] oranges oh Hallelujah
[2:19:51] you understand one of the things that
[2:19:53] make heaven so great is we won't just be
[2:19:56] young we'll all be
[2:19:58] changed and that part about you that
[2:20:00] don't like that sister sitting on the
[2:20:01] other end of the
[2:20:03] Pew that part about her will be changed
[2:20:06] but that's only half the story the part
[2:20:08] about you that don't like her it'll be
[2:20:09] changed
[2:20:13] too PR God
[2:20:21] and that's only the seventh day now
[2:20:24] remember we can't go straight into
[2:20:26] eternity from lead TOA we got to come
[2:20:29] back and fulfill the seventh day because
[2:20:31] Adam called God out of his
[2:20:34] Millennium God rested didn't mean God
[2:20:38] was tired God entered into his
[2:20:40] Millennium and Adam's need for
[2:20:43] Redemption put God's Millennium on hold
[2:20:47] and he called God out of his millennium
[2:20:51] so God didn't say all right fine forget
[2:20:53] it forget about it oh no ain't going to
[2:20:55] forget about it it'll restart
[2:20:59] again the seventh

[2:32:20] and uh me and my wife was sitting over
[2:32:22] at the house and all the kids was gone
[2:32:24] and so you know sometimes you're sitting
[2:32:27] around and reading and and uh may have
[2:32:30] been Saturday evening before but but
[2:32:32] we're sitting over there in the evening
[2:32:33] and I had my Bible out and I started
[2:32:35] talking about some things in the
[2:32:37] scripture and and uh she said you know I
[2:32:39] never never really heard that like that
[2:32:41] well I said well let me just read it so
[2:32:42] I turned over to the song of solom and
[2:32:44] sitting there in our living room I read
[2:32:46] the entire book of The Song of Solomon
[2:32:49] and I said in that odd how that he talks
[2:32:51] to her and then she talks back to him
[2:32:54] and after a little bit she took on his
[2:32:56] language and started we sat there in the
[2:32:58] in the living room and went went and
[2:33:00] read through that and just thinking
[2:33:01] about how that what God had done for us
[2:33:03] and I remember telling her I said that'd
[2:33:05] make a good sermon wouldn't it like yeah
[2:33:08] it would well praise the lord we heard
[2:33:10] it isn't it wonderful that that God
[2:33:13] would do something in you that isn't
[2:33:15] that what he's been trying to tell us
[2:33:16] all weekend that you could identify
[2:33:20] yourself or you could see yourself the
[2:33:21] way that God sees you my what a
[2:33:24] privilege it is to know how God feels
[2:33:26] about you if we could ever get to that
[2:33:28] place in our heart I know we live in a
[2:33:30] tough time we live in a challenged age
[2:33:33] you know here brother Donnie had ended
[2:33:35] that message and he was talking about
[2:33:36] how they were being called out of Israel
[2:33:39] and you know the the very cry that or
[2:33:41] the the the request that Moses made was
[2:33:44] let to let my people go that they could
[2:33:46] come into the mountain and worship me it
[2:33:49] was a call all that they would have the
[2:33:50] freedom to come and worship and and to
[2:33:53] praise their God and isn't it odd that
[2:33:55] whenever he made that request Pharaoh's
[2:33:57] response to Moses was get you back to
[2:34:00] your
[2:34:01] burdens and then he added more work on
[2:34:04] them and more burden on them he said if
[2:34:05] you got enough time to worship then
[2:34:07] you've got too much free time on your
[2:34:09] hands so I'm going to put a little bit
[2:34:10] more
[2:34:11] pressure but the Bible said God only
[2:34:13] allowed so much before he delivered them
[2:34:15] I thought isn't that something like our
[2:34:16] God even in the time you know why Satan
[2:34:19] put so much pressure on them because it
[2:34:21] was time to leave at the time of The
[2:34:24] Exodus he put pressure on them and added
[2:34:26] work to them and added pressure I
[2:34:28] thought here it is in the time of the
[2:34:30] Bride of Jesus Christ this is our our
[2:34:32] time of Exodus it's our time of
[2:34:33] departure is at hand and here we are
[2:34:36] living in the the age of greatest
[2:34:38] pressure but God has given us a way to
[2:34:40] overcome it amen isn't that wonderful
[2:34:44] amen I I don't think I can't think of
[2:34:46] anything else I'd rather have in this
[2:34:47] life than to have Jesus Christ is that

[2:38:54] stops in our way to try to hinder us but

[2:39:19] the joy of God out of our life but here
[2:39:21] God would come by tonight and speak to
[2:39:23] you directly and say is there a little
[2:39:25] bit of something still blooming I wonder

[2:43:58] in this place anyway well I come to have
[2:44:01] church and you know ain't no room in
[2:44:03] here it's so tight in here there ain't
[2:44:05] no room for the
[2:44:06] devil so I think we ought just put him
[2:44:09] in his place and go on and worship God
[2:44:10] anyhow sir put him in you know you know
[2:44:13] that's that's the only way is to put him
[2:44:16] in his place you say well brother mat I
[2:44:18] I got to get the devil where belongs so
[2:44:19] you me tell you the only way you'll ever
[2:44:20] get the devil in his place is when you
[2:44:23] get into
[2:44:24] yours preach
[2:44:25] it when you get into your place then the
[2:44:28] devil has to get into his and God has
[2:44:31] given us a position in the word of God
[2:44:33] as a Son of God he told me who I was he
[2:44:37] told me stop looking at my flesh this
[2:44:39] old dirt because he got brought grace
[2:44:41] that brought me out of it and out of
[2:44:43] that Garden of dirt is growing flowers
[2:44:47] to my God
[2:44:50] the the stature of a perfect man right
[2:44:53] of that old God I'll tell you what I
[2:44:54] don't know what y'all heard this weekend
[2:44:56] but I think we need to put the devil in
[2:44:57] his place you got all kinds of people
[2:44:59] trying to tell you you can't make it and
[2:45:01] you'll never be good enough or or you
[2:45:03] you can't be a Christian you can't be a
[2:45:05] believer the your friends tell you've
[2:45:07] gone too far your your loved ones tell
[2:45:09] you gone too far and you can't be a real
[2:45:11] Christian you'll never make nothing
[2:45:13] you'll never be a preacher you'll never
[2:45:14] be a singer you'll never be able to be a
[2:45:16] servant of God but I think we need to to
[2:45:19] put the devil in his place B said we're
[2:45:21] listening to the wrong thing he said
[2:45:23] even when the doctor says you can't get
[2:45:24] well he said that's when you're wrong
[2:45:27] that's just a devil standing there
[2:45:28] trying to poke things into you so it
[2:45:30] don't matter what it is if it ain't line
[2:45:33] with the word of God it's the devil
[2:45:34] trying to poke it into you so I think we
[2:45:36] need to turn around and look at him
[2:45:37] don't look at your wife but we need to
[2:45:39] turn around and look at the Devil and
[2:45:40] tell him you ain't got no right to do
[2:45:42] that and put him in his place you don't
[2:45:45] ever have to accept it said that's all
[2:45:47] we got to do I believe they are that
[2:45:49] we're called of God but the devil just
[2:45:51] makes a puppet out of them to push them
[2:45:53] around from place to place but we need
[2:45:55] to tow the mark with him and call the
[2:45:57] scripture on his hand so I say Devil by
[2:46:00] the word of God I'm a Son of God by the
[2:46:03] word of God I'm a believer I'm a blood
[2:46:05] bought Son of God the creator of Heaven
[2:46:08] and Earth has created in me a new life
[2:46:12] and put the devil in his place how many
[2:46:14] can do it tonight won't you give a hand
[2:46:16] clap of praise to the Lord let let me
[2:46:19] tell you the truth isn't it wonderful
[2:46:21] when you come to church I feel like
[2:46:23] having Church y'all may as well let me
[2:46:24] it's the only place I know you can come
[2:46:26] in Bound and you can go out free that's
[2:46:29] what happened to the Hebrew children
[2:46:30] isn't it something when they went into
[2:46:32] the fire the same fire that burned those
[2:46:34] that judged them is the same fire that
[2:46:36] set them free they said well I'll put
[2:46:38] enough fire on them I'll make it so hot
[2:46:40] that they can't do nothing and it'll
[2:46:42] take their life but all it did was burn
[2:46:43] the one that judged them and it caused
[2:46:45] their hands to come free that they could
[2:46:47] worship their God so I say in the midst
[2:46:50] of the fire let's lift our hand and put
[2:46:52] the devil in this
[2:46:54] place we got a ride to praise God how
[2:46:57] many can do it tonight we're going to

[2:53:49] feeling cuz I don't like the devil and I
[2:53:52] don't like the effects of the devil on
[2:53:53] people you know why cuz I know what it's
[2:53:55] like to be bound I know what it was like
[2:53:58] when I couldn't raise my hand and I
[2:54:00] couldn't feel free and I couldn't
[2:54:02] worship God I was so bound up by so much
[2:54:04] Theology and every other kind of
[2:54:07] different person's opinion about it but
[2:54:09] then one day I I was out there in the
[2:54:11] woods and I was just to praying talking
[2:54:13] to the Lord and there's such a joy came
[2:54:15] on me it didn't matter who was looking
[2:54:17] and who was around nobody's opinion
[2:54:19] mattered anymore I was alone with my God
[2:54:21] and I determined in my heart that when I
[2:54:24] come to worship God I'll worship him
[2:54:26] that way I didn't I don't worship
[2:54:28] because of anybody around me it ain't
[2:54:30] because who's watching or who ain't
[2:54:32] watching it's me alone with my God and I
