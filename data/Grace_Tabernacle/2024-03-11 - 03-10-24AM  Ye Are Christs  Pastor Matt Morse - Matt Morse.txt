allowing God to use them I believe God does that amen you still believe that this morning you believe God can speak to you out of his word amen so let's just read out of Romans the 8th chapter in the first verse Paul said there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit we'll just ask the Lord to add a blessing to the reading of the word as you take your seats I want to speak this morning on a subject of you are Christ and uh he said we walk not after the flesh but after the spirit I believe there's so much power in this scripture and that that can be released upon the church I got to diging into this one little verse it's so much you can find in one verse of scripture any if you ever if you ever study I know a lot of you study the the word and and you get to digging in there and finding all the Nuggets that God has in there for us and I get to reading in this scripture and then I I I spent all week in in just a couple of words just looking at all the things that God has in there and you know there's a lot of power that can be released upon the church and and I feel like that if God has something for us we ought to they may not like you but that's okay I love you and so I'm glad to be a part of you how many loves one another how many's glad to be a a part of the church this morning and to be able to have brothers and sisters that love you and that look out for you and and when you get in trouble there's somebody that you can call on so so I'm I'm proud of that I'm I'm not ashamed to be a part of this church I'm not ashamed of any one of you I know sometimes we get ashamed of oursel but I'm not ashamed of you and I hope you're not not a shame to me but but I'm glad to be a I'm glad to be a part of God's church amen and glad to be a part of the assembly this little portion of the Bride of Jesus Christ and and and brother Wesley and I know we're not the I know we're not the only Pebble on the beach but I'm glad to be a part of the Bride of Jesus I this church that's around the world a many membered bride around the world and and and I'm so glad that I'm a part of I'm not ashamed of the message of the hour I'm not ashamed of what God has done in this hour I ain't running around hiding and and pretending to be believer but I'm glad I'm I'm proud to be a Christian I'm proud to be a believer I'm proud of all the things that God has done I like to talk about it I I like to hear him talked about and I you know we' we've seen God do so much in our church and how how many testify that what the things that you've seen God do how many say this to if I if I say something that you've saw then you go ahead and say Amen we've seen the eyes that were blind come open amen I've seen the dead that was raised and I I I I saw those that were lame that couldn't walk and and God give them strength again where they could walk again and I've seen cancer that was healed and I've seen Souls that were saved and I've seen alcoholics that were delivered and I've seen drug addicts that it looked like they were on death row and they were locked in a jail cell and looked like they had never escaped but at the spirit of God that would come down in their life and he would turn their life around and here they stand as Sons and Daughters of God worshiping God living a life that's clean from drugs and alcohol he's a deliverer he's a savior he's a Healer and I'm so glad to be a part of God's church this morning there's so much that God has done in the Church of the Living God it a it ain't just some old dead church somewhere but it's a it's a church that is moving and growing in the very word of God and I believe that God has something for the church and there there's there there's desires that God has that he wants to pour out upon the church this morning but Bram said like this he said God will raise up all kinds of things in the church if the church would just get in a condition to receive it I thought isn't that something that you want why is there healing in the church cuz the church is in the condition to receive it why is there a Revival in the church cuz the church got in a condition to receive it why why would there be Deliverance that would come in the house of God it would only be because the church got in a condition to receive it uh he said he will never build his foundation upon something that man has laid because there's no other Foundation that can be laid than that which was already laid which was Christ Jesus the son of God he's the same yesterday today and forever I isn't it something brother wesy that means if you want to see God do some mighty things today then the church would have to get in a condition to receive the things of God if you want to see the supernatural in your life then you'll have to get in a condition to receive the things of God it ain't that God's running out of things to give it ain't that God is running out of the supernatural it isn't that God is running out of Miracles it's the church had to get in a a condition to be able to receive the things of God he said it must be built on the right foundation friends I'm here to tell you this morning as we're laying a foundation but in order for a church to get in the condition to receive it had to lay the right foundation it doesn't matter if you want to see God do something special it'll have to be built on the right foundation the church if the church would have to be built that way the house of God the local assembly every part of the work of God it would have to be built on a foundation it couldn't be a foundation that was laid by a man but you won't see this Supernatural God moving in the in the Miracles of God and the blessings of God flowing upon a church that was built by by men but it would have to be built upon a foundation of Jesus Christ being the same yesterday today and forever and if you get that kind of foundation you don't have to worry about God doing his part cuz God's going to show up and he'll pour His Spirit out upon the church and every single blessing that God has will be given to you and to your life when it's established upon the foundation of Jesus Christ it has to be built on a right foundation that's what the Bible says Isaiah said I lay in Zion a foundation for a found Foundation a stone a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone and a sure Foundation if you want if you want a life of success as a Christian and you want to be able to be a a successful Christian in other words and to be able to receive the blessings of God and the spirit of God and not be uh feel like you're you're living in in depression all the time and always bound down and and barely being able to go to church but you want to be able to stand up as a rich Christian and so rich with the blessing or or the or the or the the very nature of God and the joy and the peace and the the longsuffering that comes with God then it had to be built upon a right foundation he said I lay in Zion a trid stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation Peter Peter tells us he said whenever he speaks of of Isaiah he said this was Jesus that Isaiah was talking about he was the Cornerstone of the building that God is completing in the very age that we live in how many knows what a Cornerstone is a Cornerstone it was so is so careful how it was chosen it had to be carved out it had to be shaped just right it had it had to be the right size and the right dimensions and and all the angles on it had to be just right because it was going to hold the the very the very turn of the corner of the foundation of a home or a structure that was being built so if the Cornerstone isn't right or the foundation isn't right then nothing that you ever build on top of it will ever be right because it had to be right first and Peter said he said so when when God would come he be to talk about the house that God is building and he said see God is building a spiritual house this is what God is building in this day and Jesus is the perfect Foundation the very foundation stone that God has chosen for the house that he is building today he said that those who trust in him they are living stones so every one of us are part of the same house that God is building the very thing that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world he said God is the Jesus is the foundation stone he's the Cornerstone that God is building and you are the Lively stones that God is building in this spiritual house to bring forth sacrifices of Praises unto him he is building a spiritual house and brother Wesley it's built this morning upon a right foundation how many say Amen to that it it ain't it ain't just built upon a Theology of man but it's built upon a right foundation see your Christian walk brother Adam it can't be built upon a foundation of Flesh it has to be built on the spirit Paul said who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit it had to a right foundation I thought my there's so many things that we could build this spiritual house on how many ever look at yourself it's not just it's not just the body we live in but this is God's spiritual house and it had to be built on this right foundation that's why we can't go by the flesh or or Sensations or feelings and so many times you get to talking about or talking to people about the Lord and and the spirit of God and you know I've heard people say this you know well I know that the Lord was here cuz I I felt chill bumps from the bottom of of my feet to the top of my head and oh I know the Lord must have been here because the hair was Ted up on my arms so I know when the Lord comes by the hair always tends up on my arms well friends that that that's wonderful and you know what I I I got to think about that I said you know maybe when the spirit of the Lord does come maybe the hair does stand up on your arm you know why because your body it reacts to stimulation and sometimes you feel the the presence of God and and maybe maybe you do feel a chill when you when you when you feel the presence of God but I know this we can't rely on that to be a Vindication that God is present so maybe you do feel that when God comes but when you feel that it's no sign that God is really here but but but it's it's no sign of his presence and see we can't re rely on the flesh to know that God is present we can't rely on the flesh to to build a foundation our our life as a Believer we can't rely on the flesh to know that we're filled with the Holy Ghost we can't rely on the flesh to know that everything is okay with God everybody's looking for a for a for a a a a a flesh uh uh Vindication or a Vindication in our own mind to be able to prove who we are and what we are and where we came from and and what God is going to do with us but friends don't you realize it ain't got nothing to do with the way we feel it ain't got nothing to do with the the flesh or the feeling of the flesh or the or the thoughts that go through your mind it only matters where you came from and who your father is and how he created you and and what he established you in in the hour that we live in today brother B said see it can't rely on those things he said to know the secrets of the heart see if if that ain't a sign of his presence what is a sign of his presence he said to know the secrets of the heart was a sign of the Messiah isn't that right to know the seek remember the woman at the well when Jesus came to her or to him or to her and she and she she he began to tell her the things that was going on in her life and as it began to reveal to her what was going on she said I know when the Messiah comes he would do these things see it was to know the secrets of the heart it was the sign of a messiah but said what was it he said it was a messiah sign of his presence it was a Vindication that the Messiah was present friends isn't it wonderful that we saw that same thing in the age that we live in we don't have to wonder if God is present because we've saw the sign of a messiah I know I know there's a lot of people out there today that try to duplicate that same sign and and try to imitate it and try to mimic it but friends I thank God today that I don't have to mimic the ministry of another man in order to build a Ministry for myself I'm what God made me and he was what God made him and I thank God that he he would send a messiah sign in this age in order to turn the people of God back to the word of God that we could be built on a right foundation it ain't built on flesh it ain't built on the thoughts that that go through our mind we don't and we don't have to recreate that it was God's Messiah sign that came in this hour it's once to an age that God brought brought that sign in order to turn us back to the word that we could find our our right foundation you say well what is it today you mean God ain't doing that anymore no I don't mean that God's still doing it in the Bride of Jesus Christ how does he do it according to the word of God the Bible said the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of our heart that means when you come in the house of God how many how many can testify I had a lady tell me last last uh uh a couple weeks ago she said you know when you got done preaching she said you must have been driving in the car with me and my husband because we were talking about something that nobody ever talks about and if you didn't get up there and start preaching the very thing how many can ever testify that when you come in the house of God and the the Holy Spirit begins to speak to to us through through the ministers that come in the pullit it's the very thing it's the it's that same Messiah the word of God that's working through the Bride of Jesus Christ and when you preach the very message that God has given to the church in this last age he still ministers to the hearts of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's what we need today we don't need to duplicate the sign we need to preach the message that he preached and allow the spirit of God to minister to the bride and to put her in her place amen I say amen amen that's all free amen that's what that's what we're called to do to preach the message of the hour and let God's message vindicate himself over and over again to his bride they ain't our people anyway they're God's people they ain't our bride anyway it's God's bride they ain't our children anyway it's God's children it ain't our church anyway it's God's Church it ain't our message anyway it's God's message and I say let him speak to his children this morning we don't have to do licate anything we can just be who we are we're message preachers and we took the message that God has given us in this hour and we can stand on it and be able to feed it to the children of God and it still does the same thing to them today that it did 50 years ago amen it's God's message to his children there's a reality to it said what is it it's a holy ghost meeting when the spirit of God begins to move in an assembly it does the same thing that it's always done you really realize that God has called his church to be a spiritual people isn't it something that today that that's almost a mockery for a person to be a spiritual person you you get us some sister a prayer Warrior and and and see God do something or maybe see the pillar fire or something like that people just kind of pick on them and make fun of them for the things that they see and and the things that they say because we it's it's been built up as a mockery to even be spiritual you you think you anything you watch or or or you know Hollywood or the world has been built it up that it's a strange thing or or or these spooky things or something that's moving around little Spirits or Spooks and they they've even took demon spirits and took demonology and made it a a holiday out of it on Halloween where where where it's not something to even uh be afraid of or it's just you know it's just some make believe or something like that they they've took the very reality out of even being spiritual but friends let me tell you a secret this morning there is a spiritual real there's a real spiritual real and you you let me ask you where do they get the inspiration for it you think about it there's a real spiritual realm and you know I I used to talk to people that that they they didn't go to church at all and one of the easiest ways to explain that would would what everybody listens to music and I'd tell you you know well you know if you ever listen to any songs you you notice how one song makes you feel one way and another song makes you feel the other I remember when we were in high school and in in the sports and our Old Coach had come in there and you know what he' do he' say don't nobody talk we wasn't allowed to talk before the game but they go over there and they Crank That Old jukebox up and man it it would crank out the worst music in the world but whatever it was about the music that he chose made you feel like you could run through the wall me Logan you you played back there me go in that old locker room and Welly they' had that cranking them boys they they they gritting their teeth and holding their helmets in their heads and my and and they're stomping their feet getting ready to go ready to rip the head off of the kid next that come on the other bus wearing the other color shirt why it was a spiritual realm that they were taking them into to may all all of a sudden you see that music it does does that that's why that's why David went and played before Saul whenever the demons or or Spirits would battle him he would call up on S David to come and play A Spiritual music and and something that was PE peaceful to drive evil spirits out away from him see it was if you ever watch a I got thinking about that last night I thought my isn't it something if you ever watch a scary movie I don't I'm not going to ask you to raise hands but if you ever watch a scary movie you know it wouldn't even be scary without the music can you imagine here here's a guy holding a head and you're like well that's just an actor holding a fake head it wouldn't even it wouldn't even scare you but because they put the music in there with it they they they got they they got orchestras that are that that have so well found the chords that that that that bring fear and they'll get the D you know play in that old D music and and building it up and the little creaking of the door and the door begins to Creek and you'll hear the wind blow see without sound it wouldn't even you wouldn't even it wouldn't even be scary at all but but all of a sudden you know it gets to moveing and then that old creeper comes through there I remember when I was a kid you'd be scared to death if there were if there was some scary thing because the music will get you it would get you so scared and go behind the bushes and then Scooby-Doo he pull that white sheet off of him you realize it was just the Baker from down the street but before you scared to death because because because the music that was playing see it's a it's a spiritual real it Le it's a it deals with you on a spiritual level it causes you you know some songs that make people depressed and some songs they make people happy and some song this isn't emotions it's a spiritual level music deals with on a on a spiritual realm and and you realize that whenever these that these spirits that are real and in this spiritual realm Spirits they go from one person to another do you realize you can be around somebody and you'll notice that that you'll pick up the things that they do and they say it ain't that you're just mimicking them but but but you're picking up on the spirit of another person you know they Pastor one I remember brother brother David Siler he told told us a few few years ago when he used to Pastor up in Salem that he was on a call he used to be a a medic or EMT and then on the fire department and he got a call for for uh brother brother Travis you you were there but there was a but there was a man that had committed suicide in right there in in Salem he said we went over and and then they done the suicide call and and then we went back to the station we was on our way back to the station and and somebody called in and said you know hey and gave the street address that somebody committed suicide and the dispatcher was telling them about we've already addressed that had already been there tooken care of it he said when they looked at the address it wasn't even the same address it was just one or one number different or one street over he said he something like that it was so odd because they they had took they had they had already went there and then here there was another one he said so then we went down there and they went we dress that and and what and maybe the next day or something next day or a couple days later it happened again right there in the same little area and said and and they can't figure out what it was that caused it the people wasn't related they didn't know they didn't know each other it wasn't like a a relationship ship or anything like that but what would cause it said but see you know I got thinking that you know the the the world don't have an answer for that the you matter of fact you can read the the CDC they they don't they don't have an answer they call it a suicide cluster they'll say well well when several suicides occur in a certain place or time that that that that it happens that there's no they don't have an answer to why it happens that way in fact on their own website they write it like this there is not one place that a cluster is more likely to occur they occur in a variety of locations or settings so it don't matter where you are it don't matter who you are it don't matter how rich they are or how poor they are they have no distinction to be able to find out what causes this amongst people and but friends I but I can prove to you it's a spirit because here you know when this when this Spirit comes because because uh uh whenever Jesus went down and he be to uh to minister to the the the the man the that the gadan that was that was was filled with the evil spirits and whenever he went down there and ministered to him and that that he came in the the Bible says that whenever the spirits left him they asked Jesus to give him a place to go and he sent him into the swine and the swine ran off of the cliff see so it was a spirit that caused them to do it it was a a spirit that they were Anointed with even though they may have been good people and there may be one day they sered the Lord the Bible says serve the Lord while you're in your right mind or and one day you may lose it and maybe something that happened that caused them to lose their mind and they would they go into some condition that uh that that that that they they wouldn't ordinarily be in see because it was a spirit that calls them to do it and you know I I know that they when they read this they say the worst thing is is that it's spread by talking about it so they'll take the news media and they'll say well they can't do it because the media goes to sharing stories and it causes another person to do it and they don't want the media around they said because it'll it'll trigger because it'll show the place where it took place or show grieving families or or get the talking about it and it'll trigger that in somebody else cuz they'll get to thinking about somebody else that has gone through that and then they start battling it in their own mind and and and because they because they know of somebody or or or or theyve seen somebody go through it and seen somebody grieving but but but the reality of it is is that it's just an Avenue for that Spirit to minister to another person you realize that all it is they say well we don't know what triggers it but talking about it triggers it or looking at pictures of them triggers it or seeing somebody grief triggers it but really it's just an Avenue that a spirit can minister to another person but I thought my if that's that way with a demon Spirit think about it if a demon Spirit can be shared by showing or talking about something then what about a holy spirit if a demon Spirit can be passed from one person to another by talking about something or talking about somebody grieving then how about a holy spirit this morning oh my if a demon Spirit can be passed a spirit of suicide or a spirit of depression or the spirit or these spirits that go around the world if they can be passed around by testifying of the works of the devil then how much more can we pass around the Holy Spirit by testifying of the works of almighty God wonder what happen if we start testifying of the works of God this morning quit talking about what the devil done the devil can't do one thing to anybody that God didn't allow the devil can't take nobody that God didn't allow the devil can't take nobody before their time it takes God to allow it to happen but the devil will use something and call and drag somebody into some thought or in the back of their mind that one day that'll be my end one day that'll be my friends I I don't know why I'm here this morning but one day that'll be my destruction and one day that that that's going to be my result and you won't ever had to tell anybody about it but God knows about it this morning brother and he would send a word think about it if the if the testifying of bad things would lead send that kind of spirit around what about testifying of the works of God but said we went to Finland one time he was on a missionary trip when they got out there he said we passed by some workers that was working in a field and they came up on their lunch break and they gathered up underneath the tree he said so we stopped by under the tree to testify to them of the works of God they got around and handed out some pamphlets he said we passed out a few pamphlets and had prayer and we begin to talk about the Lord and 17 people received the Holy Ghost under that tree right there just because we stopped by and to spread a little gospel truth to some hungry-heart people I think it's time we stop testifying for the things that the devil done and Testify the works of God wonder if there's any hungry-heart people here this morning that we could testify about the or to spread a little gospel truth I think that's what we ought to do this morning I think we ought to spread a little gospel truth when you're lost he's a place to find Salvation when you're hungry he's bread for your soul when you're thirsty he'll give you living water when you need shelter he'll be a refuge for you I think we ought to spread a little gospel truth brother Bram said it's a privilege to stand before one person Hallelujah it's a privilege to stand before one person and talk about the Lord Jesus isn't it a privilege he said I've noticed in my Ministry it don't matter to God whether there's a dozen or there's thousands he has the same message all the time for the people it's the grace of Jesus Christ I think I think that it don't matter if there's one or a thousand brother Wesley it's the same message if there's one or a thousand it'll bring the same result if there's one or a thousand it'll liberate you it'll free you it'll free the one it'll free the Thousand there's times in the Bible there was 3,000 Souls that was saved and many times there's just one it don't matter how many is there it I think we ought to spread a little gospel truth I think it's okay to spread a little gospel truth this morning the truth is you don't belong to the devil you belong to God I feel like preaching a little bit I think we ought to spread a little gospel truth the truth is that ain't your end the truth is that ain't where you're going the truth is that wasn't for you you you belong to God the truth is you was made in His image you wern't made in the devil's image you just made in the image of God the truth is you ain't got to look like the world you didn't come from the world you came from God it's a little gospel truth the truth is you're made for a purpose the truth is is that God's purpose never fails the truth is that you belong to God before the foundation of the world the truth is that that that there happen to be a fall in the garden and when that fall came there was a great Chasm that separated God from man but when Jesus Christ came on the earth he took that Chasm away and he brought men back together with God again that's the truth and we belong to God we go through trials and sometimes we may feel like God's forsaken us and all these things but the Bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord present when you start testifying of the things of God he comes present in a spiritual realm we're not talking about in the flesh I'm talking about the spirit of God will come present how many testify that some of you elders just sit around talk about the Lord and and and the spirit of the Lord would just come into the room I believe he's here this morning you just enter into the room and begin to minister to somebody's heart and am I you you just sit sometimes you break down and sometimes you cry sometimes you jump up and down sometimes you shout and but what it's the spirit of God that enters into the room but let me tell you this friends that when you sit and you talk about the Lord that the Lord ain't the only one that comes you remember the disciples that day when they were going out across the sea and here they had just left a great miracle that they had just saw Jesus feed these thousands of people that had gathered around some some you know estimate 10 15,000 people there the Bible said 5,000 men and plus the women and the children that were that were all gathered there to hear him Minister but he had after he had fed him he took two two fish and five loaves of bread and he broke it and fed them and after every one of them were fed by those two fish can you imagine the miracle that they saw that every time he would take another piece of fish it was God the Creator God and he would break off another piece and they' pass it on to another one and he would as he was breaking it he would hand it to the ministers and tell the ministers to to go out before the people and and and feed them the the the bread of life and make sure that that their that their bellies are full and the Bible said they all left and they were satisfied and they took up baskets of left over that's right there was enough for everybody in baskets that were left over when they were done and here the disciples as they were going out across the sea they got to talking about the things that they had just seen brother bam tells it so well in testimony on the sea he said here they were going out across the sea and as they were going there he said you could just hear John as he was as they was talking about all the things that they had seen Jesus do and maybe one said you know it was something down there at the party the other day when he went in at at at the celebration and he and he took the the water when they ran out of wine and he just turned it into wine and everybody got all the wine that there it wasn't a miracle and may maybe John he said you know he said it wasn't nothing like what we've seen today he said you know let me tell you what that meant to me he said I remember when I was a little boy and brother B illustrates it he said I remember when I was a little boy he said my mama used to tell me about the children of Israel and how they came out of Egypt and when they got out in the wilderness that that they had no food to eat and they they got to turn into God and say well there ain't nothing out here for us to eat but then God rained Mana out of heaven and every day he fed him and May and John would sit there and he said you know oh even as a little boy I always wondered how would God be able to do a thing like that how could he sustain them two million people and you know did God have an oven or something up there that he would break bread or or bake bread and feed them you know how would God do something like that but but but his mom would say well God is a Creator and he's the one that made bread he's the one that made the wheat fills and he's the one that made the Wilderness and he's the one that made the dry places he made every Mountain he made the valley he made the trees he made life he's the creator of life and he could sustain them on their Wilderness Journey he said you know I maybe that was good enough for a while but I always wondered oh if I could ever see him do it wouldn't it be something to see him as he would ring Mana Out of Heaven you know I've always long to see God do a miracle like that and I was sitting there other day and I oh it just came back to my memory whenever that little boy took his lunch bucket and he took it up there and Jesus took it in his hands and he be to break it and he took that bread and every time he' break off a piece of bread it would multiply and it would feed another group and he'd break another piece and it would multiply he'd feed another group oh don't you realize it ain't just something that my mama told me this ain't just a testimony it ain't just a story from my uh from my ancestor it ain't a story where it came from but I got to see the living reality of the creator of God the very Creator God creating brother and as they started tell the testimony of the things of God all of a sudden while they were telling the testimony lo and behold the devil was out there and he didn't want to hear it no more see when you go talking about the lord the devil shows up too oh yeah he wanted to break up the party so here the devil come and the Bible said this great wind and and great storm Came Upon them tried to sink the boat but while while it looked like the storm would sink the boat and here they were in great fear they looked out across the water and here came a spirit walking on the water and they and they got a afraid because it was a spirit it looked like something spooky and Jesus spoke to them and he said be not be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid the Bible says straight away he told him that I thought isn't that something he didn't allow him to stay in that state of fear very long but soon as it truck and they recognizing they got afraid of of the spirit of God they got afraid of the supernatural they got afraid of what was coming walking on the water but soon as the fear struck the Bible said but straight away Jesus corrected it he said be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid don't be afraid of the spirit of God don't be afraid of the move of God don't be afraid of of Jesus walking on the water what was he doing he was overcoming the storm he was overcoming the devil that looked like he would take him out and I'm getting somewhere with this but but when he came walking out on there when and Peter said oh Lord if if that be you then won't you bid me to come you remember the story and and then and Jesus said well come and Peter stepped out of the ship the Bible said he went out of the ship and he walked on the water to go to Jesus he got out of it and he walked on the water to go to Jesus you say what was it that he done Peter stepped into a spiritual realm of Faith you realize the flesh man in the realm of Flesh had no ability to ever walk on water friend you go try it and see if it ain't the truth you get all the braveness you want to and try to muster it up and go walk across Black River and every one of you going to sink every time but he stepped into a different realm Jesus invited him on the water he stepped into a spiritual realm of faith and that spiritual realm of Faith defied the laws of Flesh he stepped out of out of Flesh he stepped out of Theology and into a spiritual that's what God wants us to do this morning to step out of an intellectual understanding of God and into a spiritual realm of Faith to step to step into a spiritual realm a place where God can minister to you Amen brother see that's the only way to get to Jesus ain't that something brother Wesley the only way to get to Jesus was to step into another Realm he couldn't get to him any other way he couldn't get to him in in in the realm of flesh but he had to step into another realm that's right and notice what he done is when he stepped over into that realm of Faith he walked out and sometimes even when you make that step and and you and you start you start that that Journey when he stepped out after a little bit his faith got went down he got over the the waves and things kind of overtook him and the Bible says he began to sink but immediately Jesus reached out and took a hold of him said see he wouldn't even let him he wouldn't invite him out there to drown he wouldn't invite him out there to let him sink in the water but it was his invitation that he walked into that realm of Faith so he's not going to let him get all wrapped up in it and not know where to go or or or not know what to do with it but he took a hold of him and he established his feet firm on the water and the Bible says that then he they went back to the boat isn't it something they walked back I thought my that isn't it something that whenever Jesus took him I don't believe that Jesus dragged him back to the boat I don't think that he took him and he carried him and he picked him up and had to drag him back to the boat but he was just holding on to him and but David whenever he was there in the presence of Jesus it gave him the faith to be able to stand on the water the very thing that was meant to drown him now he was standing on it the very thing that was going to take him down now he was standing on him because Jesus had got a hold of him and it gave him the faith to walk on the very thing that would have drowned him friends don't you realize that's what's wrong with the world today the world is a drowning people we're drowning in in sorrow they drown in debt they're drowning in grief they're drowning in the things of the world they're drowning in lay all to see you but I invite you this morning to step out into a realm of faith and forget about the old flesh for a little bit and step into a realm where Jesus can take a hold of you and allow the supernatural God to move in your life come on brother a realm of Faith you can't walk by flesh a Christian can't walk by flesh but they have to walk by the spirit Amen brother I walk in a walk by the flesh people go to church they judge every every service by their flesh they judge a move of God by their flesh by by their thinking or or their feelings It's Always by the flesh but forget about the flesh for a little bit and step out into a realm of faith and let God deal with your heart he won't leave you there Bible says we don't walk by flesh by the spirit listen what Paul says he said now there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus no condemnation can I can I sto right here just a minute took me a while to get here I'm sorry no condemnation you know what condemnation is it's an expression of strong disapproval it means that to pronounce something as wrong or morally culpable to disapprove of oneself isn't that the devil oh yeah condemnation That's what Satan does he brings a strong disapproval yeah so when you look at yourself you're always you're never going to be approved of you yeah it's a strong disapproval you're never meet the standard that you would set here's how I got to live here's how here's how I got to be a Christian in order to go to heaven in order to make a Rapture I got the all I got to meet all these standards and you'll never meet the standards that you set friends I'm here to tell you it don't matter what standard you set you're never going to meet every standard because we're flesh but Paul says see it it's a strong disapproval but then Paul says but no now there's no condemnation in other words there's no more dis approval isn't that good there's no more disapproval of yourself we know we can't approve of us because of who we are we can't approve of us because you know every thought you think you can't approve of you because you know everything you've done even when nobody else knows you can't approve of you but Paul said there's a place you can get that there's no more disapproval of you is that something there's no more condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus you said well brother Matt I I don't know about you I can't put myself there you know why because we we we look at oursel I got news for you I can't put myself there either but you know what the Bible says we ain't got to because we were put there by by God that's what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 1 he said we was established in him not by our own self he said but he speaking of God which established us with you in Christ has anointed us is God so it wasn't us that put us there anyway it was God that put you there you may not be able to put yourself in Christ but it was God that put you there see it matter matters how you got there it was God somebody say that with me this morning God has established us in Christ it was God that has established us in Christ it ain't you that put you there see you can't you can't ever bring yourself there where there's no condemnation but Paul said but God has established us in Christ it was God that put you there it was God that thought that about you it was God that raised you to this place said well what does it mean to be in Christ well first you have to know who Christ is the Bible said he's a faithful and a true Witness so I got can I can I preach this to a little bit brother Ben brother Ben can you get thank you brother Ben he's my guy gives me a little time he's a faithful and true witness who who is Christ to be in Christ you have to know who he is he's a Creator how many how many knows that he's the he's the perfect realization of God he was the aen of God he was Jesus the son of God he Jesus said he was the beginning of the creation of God that's what the Lord said he was amen the beginning of the creation of God who is Christ that we could be in Christ he's the beginning of the creation you realize when most people read this brother Brown takes this in the church age book and he says you know people this is so easily misunderstood that he is the beginning of the creation of God this is misunderstood he said but those words because those words don't mean exactly as they sound to us I want you to catch this but he said because just taking them the way they sound has made some people in fact multitudes of people get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God making him lower than the godhead see in other words that God created him and when God created him well then he was a lesser creation of God and then and then everything was created from him he said then this first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatever it contains but that is not right it don't line up with the rest of the Bible the words are he is the beginner or the author of the creation of God now we know for assurity that Jesus is God how many say Amen he's the very God he is the creator John 1 and3 all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made he is the one of whom it was said in Genesis 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth he was talking about Jesus It also says in Exodus the 20th chapter in six days the Lord made the Heaven and the earth and the Sea and all them is and rest and all that them is in them is and he rested on the seventh day he said see there is no doubt that he is the creator he was the creator of a finished physical creation he said surely we can see what these words mean now they cannot to have any other interpretation would mean that God created God he said see and how could God be how could God be created when he himself is the creator say so God couldn't created God now let me tell you where this confusion comes from because people have taken the scriptures and even even brother Bram preached it in question answers on Genesis they take the scripture of John 1 and one and say in the beginning was was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God how many knows that word it was the L of God and but M takes that and and he talks about how that this logos of God how it came forth and it came from God and it spun off from God it was that life that came out and and and it created all that there ever was but without the church age book You' never be able to make this connection you would take that and you would you would prove every Baptist right and say that there was that there was a Lesser God and that Lesser God is what created in other words in heaven was God the Father it was God the son it was the Holy Ghost and there were three different ones on and then God made the other one and see You'd follow the same theology but when he goes in this church age book he actually makes this where it makes sense it shows us that that God was in heaven he was only one God but he was the Elohim God he was God of many attributes and so whenever God created him in the beginning and he said let there be and he made this logos for this word he said in the beginning was the word remember when brother M goes through this I I hate to go through this fast can I just take a minute when he goes through this and question answers on Genesis he reminds people to go back before the beginning this was the purpose of that he said he said in the beginning was the word in the beginning was the logos in the in the beginning it was God it was with God and it was God he said but what about before the beginning remember he goes back into the beginning he said there was this great Fountain of Life it was God he it was an eternal God he said but notice so whenever God the Father whenever he creates this and when it when he made the office of sunship that's why brother Brandon would preach that and say we don't believe in Eternal sunship see the church world today believes that that there's an eternal sunship in other words Jesus the the son the office of the sun was there all along but said but that's not what it was the sunship was an office of God so when he created it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't that he was making another another God but it was an office for the same God to be able to be present in and so when he made this logos and he created it it was the very same God Of Heaven that walked down in it and he Poss possessed it so it was the same Creator that's why he would say it was Jesus that made all things the Bible you go through the whole scripture you'll find it the same way Hebrews the first chapter Paul said God as sunry times and diverse manner spoke to the spoke to us unto the fathers by the prophets he said in the last days he spoke to us by his son whom he ha appointed heir of All Things by whom he also made the worlds he said he being in the brightness of his glory being the brightness of his glory the very brightness of the image of God the express image of his person in other words you wouldn't even be able to see God but you see him in that office he said upholding the things all things by the word of his power talking about Jesus who when he had by himself purged our sins he sat down on the right hand of God think about it into the Throne of God now Colossians 1 he said he delivered us from the power of Darkness he translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins he was the image of the invisible God the very thing you couldn't see God created an office that you could see said see he was amaz he was the first born of every creature and by him were all things created and by him everything that was in heaven everything that was on Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones domensions principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist so it wasn't a Lesser God that he made it was it was it was an office of God see the sunship it was an office that God had made for God to be able to dwell in and and and so we see him in the age in in the Le oysan Church the Bible says he is standing in the midst of the church this is what brother mam says about this he said now when he's standing there he's standing he stands there revealing who he is in this last age this is important to be in Christ you have to know who Christ is he said he's standing there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God said see this is another creation this has to do with the church it's a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride and as the spirit of God he came down and he created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born he said I want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to give life to a human ovam supplied by Mary that would have been sinful mankind producing a body he said that would it it would not have produced The Last adom of whom it was said that low a body hast thou the father prepared for me for the Bible said the father had prepared the body he says so it had to be God God not Mary provided the body Mary was a human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a God man he was the son of God he was of the new creation he was man and God met and joined he was the first of this new race he was the head of the new race he quotes several scriptures Colossians 1:18 he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn of the dead and all things that he might have preeminence 2 Corinthians 5 he said therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creation old things are passed away behold all things are come new amen he said there you see it couldn't be the old order of creation but it had to be a new now in Union with Christ he has become a new creation of God Amen he's talking about our relationship with God Ephesians 2 he said we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus he said see it's a new creation we're created in Christ God made a new creation he said see we're created in Christ Jesus unto good works brother said in other words we were created in Union with Christ unto good works Ephesians 4:24 Paul said and you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness so there's a new creation say how can you not how can you walk in the spirit and and not in this flesh but Paul he's showing us there's a new creation that God has made but remember said see this new creation it's not the old creation made over that's where people get it messed up that God has come and he's kind of fixed up your life and and and and made you made you a better person and kind of menend you that way he said but it ain't the old creation made over it can never be called a new creation that's exactly what the Bible said it's a new creation he said see it's another creation that's distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing with the ways of the flesh that he dealt with that's how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and Abraham's issue through Isaac or the lineage of Isaac he said but now out of the Kindred of every tribe and every nation God has purposed a new creation it ain't out of the lineage of Flesh of Abraham or or or or the F or the or the or Abraham's son he said but it's a new creation out of every nation in the world God has made a new creation and Jesus Jesus he's the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man that makes me want to Shadow over this building he was God created in the form of man and now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation but said this is the true revelation of God it's the true Revelation this was his purpose this purpose this purpose took form through election said see that is why God could look down at the last stage and all he would see all that would be over he would see himself in the middle of the church as the author of the new creation of God because by his own decree he elected members of this new creation Listen Now by God's decree he could see himself standing in the midst of the church and people worshiping him and being a part of that creation he said because he his Sovereign power is what brought it to pass his own decree elected members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will and by his omnipotence he brought it to pass how else could he know he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving Glory from his Brethren if he didn't make sure that it would happen it was God by his own decree he made a new creation in his own plan he saw you in his mind it a it ain't the old order of creation where we were laying in the midst of the Flesh and the FI of the things of the flesh he said but God made something new that would be able to all all things he knew he said all things worked out according to what he knew in order that his purpose and his good pleasure might be brought to pass am he said aren't you glad that you belong to him he made you a new creation are you hearing me somebody you see why that old flesh don't have nothing to do with it he said he made you a new creation he ain't mending up the old broken thing he made you a new creation it was a and Jesus was the firstborn among many brethren we walk not after the flesh but after the spirit spirit amen he made you this church it isn't a it isn't a church the whole church world's done everything based on emotions in the flesh but there's a new creation that God has made the Bible says you are Christ you say how are we a new creation we're a new race think about it don't that make you want to shout a new creation a new race of people a super class of people not oh if you can ever get your revelation of it this morning you ain't you ain't you ain't of the lineage of your natural father you're a new creation in God the very the very sovereignty of God is dwelling on the inside of every believer the that's what God's waiting he's waiting on you to come to this place that's why the Bible says the whole earth is groaning and waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God waiting for you to come to your position in Christ you're a new creation you're made by God the Bible says you are Christ but tell you got my picture you are Christ you're ready to go I know I I ain't got a I ain't got a longwinded spirit on me but let let me just get this he said you are Christ you are Christ I haven't preached in 10 days you are Christ and everybody got an extra hour of sleep last night did I do that backwards man you are Christ I seen this one brother her brother told me he said there was this thing online last night it said it said be sure to put your clocks up an hour or you'll be an hour and 10 man late for church in the morning like make sure you put it up an hour you going be an hour and a half late Glory oh Lord help us you are Christ you are Christ that's a scripture 1 Corinthians 3 how many how many's heard that scripture I want to read it from the Bible the Bible says and you are Christ and Christ is God's in other words you belong to him you belong how many believe that you belong to him but see there's something greater laying in this brother bram's talking about this in the church age book there's something greater than you just belonging to God see I want you to notice in this scripture it says and you are Christ right there there's apostrophe between the T and the s that apostrophe declares ownership it means that you belong to God you you're his possession but let me show you something a little bit even greater than that can you put my picture back up no it's the picture it wasn't a typo but it says you are Christ but the apostrophe getting there now you can find this word in the Bible too Christ without the the apostrophe is talking about something totally different Jesus uses this in Matthew the 24th chapter he said there shall arise many false christs in other words they were plural of Christ Jesus said it wasn't that there was false jesuses that are running around the world he said but it was false anointed ones that in the end time but notice but he didn't just leave it there that there's just false anointed ones he said but there if there's false anointed ones then there must be true anointed ones if there's a false anointed if there's false Christ then there must be true true Christ there must there must be the true anointed ones it must be a true anointing it is Christ in his church he said it's the very fullness of God in his church today he was the first born among many Brethren it was a new creation of God but ra said and in there there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church having the preeminence in the church he said oh my what what about it the anointed man has now become the anointed people that that man that was anointed that man named Jesus that you could look upon and say he was anointed man butam said but now the anointed man has became an anointed people he said oh my to bring back the anointed bride the bridegroom anointed he said how are they anointed by accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word of God he said my word is a spirit he was anointed with a word and the very thing that Eve turned down it has came back in this hour and we have accepted it you you are Christ you've accepted the anointing of God he said you're a messiah that's what the Bible said that he was the Messiah but you're little Messiah that are in the world with the same very the very same God that was in Jesus Christ that is in you today it's you in Christ and Christ in you your Messiah so what are you anointed for to do the same work that God done the very Redemptive work that was in the Bible that we're still doing in this hour I'm just now getting to my message the Holy Ghost in Christ has been reconciled by to the world today Paul said see if any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away and All Things become new and all things are of God now of those that have been reconciled us unto himself by Jesus Christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation not only that we are Christ and not only did he make us a new creation not only did he do all that for for me not only do I belong to him not only did he feel F me with his Spirit but Paul said now that same Christ that was ministering to me is now ministering through me he said God that was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing trespasses unto them but has committed unto us the word of reconciliation and now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us and we pray for you in Christ stead that you would be reconciled to God I don't know about y'all but that's sets my soul on fire he said I pray for you in Christ said when Jesus ain't here walking on the earth to pray for you Jesus ain't walking on the earth to lift you up Jesus ain't walking on the earth to get a hold of you and and to walk you through every aspect of your life he said but it's Christ in you and Christ in me that is speaking through me and in Christ said I pray for you oh friends don't you realize the same thing that Jesus done that you had the power to do it's in the body it was what was in the head has been poured out into the body of Jesus Christ and you are Christ my sad this bride church is continuing the works that Jesus done that's what Jesus said anyway it's the Bible Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also I'm say it wasn't another work he said God wants to bring the Holy Ghost in you to continue the same work that he was doing in Christ you are Christ see we're living in a time brother Adam that it's necessary for him to do it amen we're living in a Time that we need it where I don't believe that God would give you something that you didn't need that's right a't that true I'm going to I'm I'm going to wrap this up I don't believe God I want believe God would give you something that you didn't need but say see the work wasn't so needy in the days of Luther yeah isn't that good it wasn't so needy then that was that was God's church it was a little bit more needier in the days of Wesley because the world the Bible says the world get weaker and weaker and wiser and more wicked all the time see see but the Holy Spirit has been moving he said there was just a little breath of it in Luther a little blow of it in Wesley and a deeper blow of it in Pentecost but now the breath and the spirit has come the same she's uniting together bringing forth the same powerful blow of the Holy Ghost like it did back there and it's manifesting the same works that he did back there is being manifested right today the very same thing say what was it that was that was ministering in our day brother Wesley it was the it was the spirit and the Breath of God uniting together to manifest the same Works isn't it something it was Christ in a human being in the Breath of God speaking out of him and the spirit of God living in him and ministering doing the same works that God does what is it in you today the the very Church of God it's the spirit and the Breath of God uniting together ministering The Works of God the same works that God done are being done in The Bride of Jesus Christ the breath and the spirit coming together Jesus said verily I say unto you the son can do nothing unless you see the father doing it whatever the father does he shows the son the father dwelleth in me and he's the one that does the works isn't it something something in you you see but we're living in a needy hour we're living in a time of great need and you realize that the life Oh Glory to God you realize the life that is in the church it it manifests What It Is by what it desires by the needs of it you take a little mama that's pregnant you may you may not know that you may not know it for a little while maybe she can go to the doctor whatever but but she starts craving different things what is it but something that you wouldn't need I know you some of y'all laugh about the things that people eat all all kinds of funny stories that that that I've heard some of the goofiest stuff people get they'll get pickles and and and and barbecue chips and ice cream and mix them all together in a bowl and eat that's the weirdest stuff that people eat and and why why why would you eat that you never like that con am I am I talking out of my head is that not the truth they always eat weird things why why they eat weird things because there's a life in her her that has a need of something and the life that is in her although she ain't it ain't it ain't talking to her but it but it but it but it's pulling a need it's it has a desire for something and so and so now as this mama begins to speak and and she gets this desire she don't even know where it came from but she begins to speak and she says you know honey if you can go by the store maybe grab pack get a big old jar them kosher deal pickles and and uh and and some some apricot ice cream and in a in a case of Dr Pepper he's like what in the world you want with all that stuff but you know what because there's something on there's a life in her that needs something it's like the little boy that would tells a story about him chewing on the bicycle pedal he said why was he chewing on the pedal because there was something in his first bird that wasn't put there the nutrients and the things that that wasn't in his body and so he would chew on it to get that out of it to fulfill what he had need of in his life say so this is where we are and and that that because there's a desire there and you know what a good daddy will do he'll go down to the store he'll buy a case of Dr Pepper he'll get apricot ice cream he'll get a big jar of kosher deer pickles he'll hold his nose the whole way home he'll give it to her and say you mix it up on your own I don't want to have nothing to do with but he'll make sure that she has what she has need of because he wants a perfect child and he knows that there's something in there there's a life in there that's calling out for whatever's in that pickle there's a life in there that's calling out for whatever's in apricot ice cream there's a a life in there that that's calling out for whatever's in that Dr Pepper there's something in there that it needs and the daddy will do everything he can to make sure that it gets what it needs because he wants it to be born a perfect child but say that's the same way it is with the church today see God we're in a needy hour and the church has needs there's a life don't you see it this morning friends there's a life that is growing in the Church of the Living God and it it may seem strange to the world when you come preaching these things it may seem like a strange Doctrine to the Baptist or the Presbyterian or a church down the road it may seem like a strange Doctrine but it's the life that is in the church that has need of it cuz it's a it's a life that that is looking for Rapture he said Oh my he said a good daddy will do everything you can to get it he said but if that's that way with our Earthly father then what about our heavenly father the church has needs he said how much more abler is he to go get it he's a Creator now think about how able he is to prepare somebody to live like his own glorious body if we want to live there's something in us that calls us to live and there something in us that calls us to do right and then God will call somebody to the platform or the pull pit that'll preach the absolute truth he see what does that show you that if you're a real child of God you'll begin to cry out God take it from me circumcise me from it take these things away from me he said because it's needed for your heavenly home where you're going to for he's gone to prepare a place for you and you got to be the real word bride of Jesus Christ man is that something that God would send a preacher to the the platform that would go down glory to God that would go down to the store he'd go down to the store and in the very Spirit that's on the inside of you that begins to call out the things that you need from God and that'll that'll Inspire man of God to be digging in the word looking for something and God would inspire a scripture it's our heavenly father that brings the needs to the people that the life inside of them can manifest itself I believe that Amen brother I believe that he said he'll call somebody to the pull pit that'll preach the absolute truth you know you know what it is he said if he's preaching that it proves that there's life in the church glory to God it proves that there's something in there that's Desiring something it proves there's a lie if God would send an inspired word it proves there's life in you if God's ministering to you this morning it proves there's life in you and it's growing and it's reaching out it may seem strange but that's what's that's what you're feeding on you're feeding on something that your the life in your body needs you're feeding on something there's a there's a people we're not we're not like everybody else why this people this life in you is looking to Rapture this life in you it's looking for a body change you know what we do and we don't have to we don't go down to the headquarters to pick it up see that's what the whole churches do they go down the headquarters and pick up what do my church need I don't know here's the problem in the church and the bishop down there will give them what to say to their church this is what happened over here just give them that and that'll take care of them take them that little pamphlet we don't have a headquarters to go toen come on he said there's a life in there that needs something yeah God sent an Abel Minister that was to the platform that is inspired said but where would he get it we don't go to the headquarters he said I believe she's ready the final climax Yonder to bring forth a faith that will Rapture the church into glory and it's laying in the message the Lord so where will they go to get it out of the message of the hour that's why we dig into it and that's why we preach it and that's why these brothers that anointed to God come and preach this same message cuz the very thing you need for Rapture and faith and Rapture and Grace is laid in the the message of the hour we don't have a headquarters to get it from but I thank God there's still men of God that'll go back to the message of God and pull out what the church has need of today and feed God's children why he's the Creator I'm going to close with this point that he's the Creator said to bring forth it's laying in the message you realize that what was laying there what's there was laying there before you needed it right amen isn't that something Lord everything you ever have need of was laying there before you needed that's right and God would reach down into the word of God and pull out the very needs of the church the body of Christ think about it it was already there amen you know the Bible tells us a story in John the 9th chapter Bible says Jesus Came Upon A man that had been blind from his birth you remember the story and the man asked Jesus when he came by they said what did this man do to cause him to be born blind what caused this and Jesus said it wasn't no sins of his or sins of his father or mother he said but it was only that the glory of God would be revealed in him a't it something here that creator of the David was standing there with him he was looking as some music players come he was looking for for answers I thought here he I've told I've used this many times and how they would heard him he heard the voice of Jesus begin to speak but you realize what he was really hearing he was hearing the voice of the creator the one that made every man the one that formed Adam out of a dust to the ground and he heard his voes he began to speak and Jesus as he turned to the man you remember what he told him the Bible says he went down on the dust and he took some dirt out of the ground and he and he made an eyeball out of it and then he put it in the man's sockets and he said go wash in the pool at salom and the Bible says the man he went down to the pool and he washed and he came back seeing my he met the Creator and he gave him something that he was missing but butam say see but listen this he said in the beginning he said we came from the dust of the earth our bodies laid in the Earth at the beginning he said let's take a little picture of this God the Fountain of Life the logos that went out of God he brooded over the Earth he was brooding the word which means mothering or cing over the Earth he brooded over it and everything that we are was laying in the earth he said my body was laid out on this Earth before there was even a life on the earth the calcium the petroleum God is a contractor and he laid out all the bodies like he was going to build a subdivision he know we'd be here he know I'd be here before the world he know I'd be standing here before before the world was here he know you'd be sitting in the seat you are he's infinite he knows it so what are you scared about I thought my is is something that God all these bodies everything that you are was laying in this earth and here God this great contractor before he would ever put it together as he would lay and he would brw over the Earth and he would look at all that we were I thought no wonder whenever Jesus came in contact with this blind man and they would ask what did he do to cause him to be born this way I thought here he was the Creator God that was tending before him that same creator that whenever that body was being formed in the womb of his mother let me tell you how much how much God had done this on purpose friends I don't believe I don't believe it's just a coincidence Jesus said that the glory of God might be revealed in him then it was B when his body was being formed and there and and and the little legs came on the body and the arms that that Creator God would say now hold off on the eyes just for a little while and that body was born into this Earth Without Eyes in his socket and he came in one day he came walking on the earth and he met that same Creator and notice what he said he said he didn't sin to cause himself to be born this way he said but it was that the glory of God might be revealed in him and then the Bible says notice where Jesus went to get his eyes he went down to the dust to the ground the very place where the Prophet said our bodies were laying there before the foundation of the world I thought my he picked up the eyes that had been laying there before the world was ever created and he P formed an eyeball and put it in his socket and he gave him some friends you may have been born in this world you may be missing some things you may feel like you're you're missing out on what God has made you in this new creation that he made but he's God the Creator and everything that he made for you is already here it's laying in the message of the hour and I thank God that he has send somebody would be able to pull it out and give it to you in the time of need you say why am I weak this morning it's that the glory of God might be revealed in you why am I go through depression that the glory of God might be revealed in you why don't I have the faith that I ought to have that the glory of God might be revealed in you that out of the message of the hour we can take an arm and put it where the arm needs to go out of the message of the hour you can take a a hand and put it where the hand needs to go out of the message of the hour take an eyeball and put it back in the ey socket where eye needs to go the Creator God is Among Us doing the same work don't you realize when he stood in this church he said didn't you know that leot Dean Church she was blind and wretched and miserable and naked why was she born blind that the glory of God might be revealed in her Amen in the the midst of that church isn't it something come on I wish I wish I hope you see that like I do in the midst of that church that old order that old old order of things that God would make a new creation he's the Creator God Amen and put a church in the middle of Le O DEA when everything else is Fallen around and he would raise up a bride out of that age isn't it something out of the filthiest of places come the most beautiful thing that God has ever made out of the darkest place the greatest muck of the m of the earth out came the the the the the filthiest Age come the most beautiful creation friends I'm going to say them eyes that that man got was about the best eyes they had to be the prettiest eyes amen I know I ain't got time to finish this if you don't stand your feet and maybe like that little girl over in Memphis when she went out there looking for her daddy she didn't have no eyes side they came to a meeting they heard about some Miracles that had took place of somebody else they came on a bus over there to a meeting where they thousands of people that had gathered around and she lost her daddy in the crowd but BR in that meeting he came walking outside he's going out there cuz somebody had never seen they didn't even know who he was and here he was walking through the crowd he said I noticed that little blind girl and she was moving around avoiding people and I stepped over in front of her and I blocked her path and asked her you know where are you going she said well I'm looking for my daddy what are you doing here I come to the meeting what are you at this meeting for well I came looking for the Healer he said you believe all that stuff she said yeah yeah I I believe that it well there was another lady that got healed she start testifying to him there was another person got healed and I heard about them my daddy brought me down here to be healed he goes you believe all that stuff and he's kind of just picking on her a little bit just to see what she' say she said yeah I believe it after a while she got fed up with it she was serious she was on a mission and she got fed up with it and she said I'll tell you what she said you just instead of finding my daddy she said you just take me to the Healer and I'll go find my own daddy and he said oh my all of a sudden fear the lord they swirling around he he started to pray for and those standing around and they said I heard him say he stopped in the middle he said little girl he said what color eyes do you want anyhow she said I always heard that blue was a pretty color and they saw little blue streaks that came down and touched that little girl's eyes the most beautiful eyes that was ever created he's a Creator God and he's still walking among his church today he ain't no dead God he's a Creator amen it's a blind Church what does it have need of it needed I sight no wonder God would have to send a prophet he would he would give sight to the to the blind what did Jesus say that was the purpose of his ministry to make the lame walk and to give sight to the blind that the weak would be made strong and set free those were captives amen he's God the Creator he's in his church today during the same Works Messiah you are
