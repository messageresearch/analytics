[37:38] to come and and and just be encouraged

[37:46] nice just to come get a breath of fresh
[37:48] air brother Travis just to get out of
[37:49] the old factory for a few minutes and
[37:51] just come get in the presence of the
[37:52] Lord and amen let God do something for
[37:55] us I want to read out of the book of J
[37:57] Joshua the first chapter in the first
[38:00] verse the Bible says now after the death
[38:02] of Moses the servant of the Lord it came
[38:03] to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua
[38:06] the son of nun Moses's Minister saying
[38:09] Moses my servant is dead now therefore
[38:11] arise go over this Jordan thou and all
[38:14] this people unto the land which I do
[38:15] give to them even to the children of
[38:18] Israel every place that the soul of your
[38:20] foot shall tread upon that have I given
[38:23] unto you as I said unto Moses from the
[38:26] Wilderness and this Le on even under the
[38:28] Great River the river Euphrates all the
[38:30] land of the Hittites under the great sea
[38:32] toward the going down of the sun shall
[38:33] be your Coast there shall not be any man
[38:36] stand be able to stand before thee all
[38:38] the days of thy life for as I was with
[38:40] Moses so I will be with thee I will not
[38:43] fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and
[38:46] of good courage For unto this people
[38:49] Thou shalt divide for an inheritance
[38:50] this land which I swear unto their
[38:52] fathers to give them only be thou strong
[38:55] and very courageous and thou mayest
[38:57] observe to do according to all the law
[38:59] which Moses my servant commanded thee
[39:01] turn not from it to the right hand nor
[39:03] to the left that thou mayest Prosper
[39:05] wherever thou goest for this book of the
[39:08] law shall not depart out of thy mouth
[39:10] but Thou shalt meditate therein day and
[39:12] night that thou mayest observe to do
[39:14] according to all that is written therein
[39:17] for then Thou shalt make thy way
[39:19] prosperous and then Thou shalt have good
[39:22] success amen we'll just ask the Lord to
[39:24] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[39:26] word and just a real simple thought the
[39:28] Lord had put on my my heart I don't mean
[39:30] that simple in a way to demean the the
[39:33] gospel and simple not don't mean
[39:35] powerless it's just simple it's
[39:36] something that's easy to understand and
[39:39] but I want to speak tonight on the
[39:41] Damascus Authority the Damascus
[39:43] Authority I thought this was just real
[39:45] good how the Lord had laid out his
[39:47] orders to Joshua and then not only did
[39:50] he tell him what he would do and that
[39:52] that he would be prosperous and he would
[39:54] have success but then God gave him a
[39:55] weight to be able to obtain it so that's
[39:57] the way God does he don't just tell you
[39:59] to do something but he'll tell you how
[40:00] to accomplish it if there's something
[40:02] out there for you God will let you know
[40:04] what's out there and know uh what's
[40:06] available but then he'll give you a way
[40:07] to to access it and so I I believe
[40:09] that's what God does he's he he's the
[40:12] he's the uh the door opener he has the
[40:14] key to every promise and I don't believe
[40:16] he wants the church to be wondering who
[40:18] they are and what they are and what they
[40:20] have access to but I believe that we
[40:21] serve a God in this age that has given
[40:24] us an open book uh so we know as the
[40:26] Bride of Jesus Christ what we have in
[40:28] our possession and and I just I just
[40:31] love the Lord and I thank him for that
[40:32] and but I want to speak uh tonight on
[40:35] the Damascus Authority now we're
[40:36] familiar with this word uh with
[40:38] authority of course this is uh Authority
[40:41] means the power to give or to keep order
[40:44] and of course we realize that in this
[40:46] world today it don't look like there's a
[40:48] whole lot of order you we was talking
[40:50] the brothers was visiting in the back
[40:51] room about things that's go go on in the
[40:54] in the Nations and all that just seems
[40:55] like there's so many things out of C and
[40:57] out of order and uh but we realize in
[40:59] order for a society to sustain itself or
[41:02] a people to go on then there always has
[41:05] to be order there has to be some form of
[41:07] order without order there's chaos
[41:09] without order there's unrest and without
[41:11] without order you'll people ride in the
[41:13] streets they'll tear down their own
[41:14] buildings they'll burn down their own
[41:15] cities without order so there so there
[41:17] has to be order and so you ever notice
[41:20] if there's an area you know you watch
[41:22] the news sometimes and and these great
[41:24] outbreaks and things happen it's because
[41:26] there's a lack of order they and they
[41:27] they lost their Authority or the order
[41:29] uh over the over the area or the the
[41:31] city or the state or whatever and so
[41:34] then then then these you know these
[41:35] things begin to happen and so we realize
[41:38] uh that it must be that there must be
[41:40] even from uh from the time of God given
[41:42] his word that there must be order how
[41:43] many believes that say Amen the Bible
[41:45] says let all things be done decently and
[41:48] in order so I I believe that I believe
[41:50] that we're living under under that kind
[41:52] of authority and we realize that uh
[41:54] through our whole lives that we always
[41:56] we always have have authority from the
[41:58] time where little kids when you're at
[41:59] home you're living under the authority
[42:01] of your parents you can't get away from
[42:02] it little guys when you go to school
[42:04] then you're under the authority of the
[42:05] teachers you can't when you go out into
[42:07] town you're under the authority you're
[42:09] under the authority of the police I know
[42:11] whenever you're young sometimes well
[42:12] I'll tell you I just I'm just going to
[42:14] be my own boss and I'm going to get out
[42:15] from under this I'm tell you what my dad
[42:17] he's been ruling over me and I've had
[42:19] about all of it I can take and when I
[42:20] get older there ain't nobody going to
[42:21] rule but it doesn't doesn't matter how
[42:23] old you are or where you're going to
[42:24] live there's always going to be an
[42:25] authority and and always going to be
[42:28] under some kind of an authority uh if
[42:30] you want to have any kind of order at
[42:32] all in your life and I I I got to think
[42:34] about all the the ways and even even
[42:36] when you get sick you know that uh
[42:38] there's an authority for being sick you
[42:39] go down the doctor and the doctor gives
[42:41] you and what what do you say when you
[42:43] call the when you call your job and you
[42:44] tell your job well I can't come in today
[42:46] and they say well you got to come in say
[42:48] but I've been sick and I've got the
[42:50] doctor's orders you know so see the
[42:52] doctor carries an authority over a
[42:54] patient so it doesn't matter where we
[42:56] where we are or what kind kind of
[42:57] condition we're in there's always uh
[42:59] there's always an authority and even
[43:01] even in the house of God when it comes
[43:03] to the church Paul said he said obey
[43:04] them that have rule over you and submit
[43:06] yourselves for they watch for your souls
[43:09] and and they must give account to God
[43:11] that but but but be obedient that they
[43:13] may do it with joy and not with grief
[43:15] grief for it is unprofitable to you I
[43:17] know this isn't something that's
[43:18] preached a whole lot but uh but but but
[43:20] it's still the gospel and it's still in
[43:22] a world that don't like order and in a
[43:24] world that don't like Authority you know
[43:26] they they kind of skirt around around
[43:27] these kind of things but Paul said but
[43:28] obey them that have rule over you so
[43:30] they they will enjoy doing it so you
[43:32] know if if it's always grief and it's
[43:34] always chaos and it's always disorder
[43:36] and it's always uh Disobedience and
[43:38] fight and he said see well it's
[43:40] unprofitable for you because they can't
[43:42] do it with joy anymore that they're
[43:43] doing it out of grief and and and
[43:45] they're bound to do the will of God and
[43:47] so so so just just be obedient to the
[43:49] word and just be obedient to the Lord
[43:51] and and and and obey the and Obey uh uh
[43:54] the word of God see so so that that we
[43:56] can that we can uh carry on and it can
[43:59] be profitable and the ministry can be
[44:00] profitable the church and but what what
[44:02] we find out is in this word Authority
[44:05] there's something that you just to lay a
[44:06] foundation that you have to know that
[44:08] what you surrender to becomes your
[44:10] Authority how many believe that in other
[44:12] words the Bible said there was a time
[44:14] when you used to yield yourself or yield
[44:16] your members to sin but then there
[44:17] cometh a time where Paul says but now
[44:19] you yield yourself to God so no longer
[44:22] in other words for a long time you lived
[44:24] under this authority of Darkness or you
[44:26] lived under a Dominion ship uh of the
[44:29] flesh or your your your life it ruled
[44:31] over you but but but but there Comes A
[44:33] Time brother Jared whenever you whenever
[44:35] you you come to this place in Christ
[44:37] where Paul said that when Christ come he
[44:39] delivers you from the power of Darkness
[44:41] so that that word power there it means
[44:43] Authority or rule or control or dominion
[44:45] and so Paul said but now when you come
[44:47] into Christ you've been delivered from
[44:49] this power and other and he has
[44:51] translated you into the kingdom of his
[44:53] dear son so in other words where there
[44:55] was a time you were Bound by one thing
[44:57] he said but now you're under Dominion of
[44:59] another you're you may have been bound
[45:00] by sin and you may have been bound by
[45:02] darkness and you may have been bound by
[45:03] flesh he said but but we have Redemption
[45:05] through the blood of Jesus Christ even
[45:08] the Forgiveness of sins in whom he said
[45:10] who is the image of the invisible God
[45:12] the first born of every creature for by
[45:14] him were all things created that are in
[45:16] heaven and that are in Earth visible and
[45:18] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[45:20] dominions or principalities or Powers
[45:23] all things were created by Him and for
[45:25] him so Paul lays a foundation here that
[45:28] there ain't no Dominion that is over the
[45:30] Dominion of Jesus Christ there there's
[45:32] no Authority that's above the authority
[45:35] of Jesus Christ he said so he said
[45:37] before him he is before all things and
[45:40] by him all things consist and he is the
[45:42] head of the body the church who is the
[45:44] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[45:46] that in all things he might have
[45:48] preeminence in other words this word
[45:50] preeminence means in all things that
[45:52] Christ would be superior to All Things
[45:54] That means every trouble he's Superior
[45:57] over it every trial he's Superior over
[45:59] it every Spirit he's Superior over it
[46:01] every every problem that would come up
[46:03] in your life or any thought that would
[46:05] come up in your mind he said he has
[46:07] preeminence over all somebody say over
[46:09] all things he has preeminence over all
[46:11] things I I thought this is wonderful cuz
[46:13] Paul said he delivered you from the
[46:16] power of Darkness that mean God knew
[46:18] right where you were and Brother David
[46:19] Paul he went right down to where you
[46:21] were and he found you in a condition
[46:23] where you were under the authoritative
[46:25] uh or the Dominion sh of darkness and
[46:28] God delivered you out of from under that
[46:30] headship and he brought you into another
[46:32] place that he would have preeminence
[46:34] over your life and friends let me tell
[46:36] you what happens when you're delivered
[46:37] out of darkness and you're under the
[46:39] preeminence of Jesus Christ no longer
[46:41] are you bound but now you're a free man
[46:44] or a free woman in God he called you out
[46:46] of this Dominion ship of darkness and
[46:48] brought you under the authority of Jesus
[46:51] Christ and let me tell you something if
[46:52] you're taking notes you can write this
[46:53] down it may be something you read later
[46:55] that'll help you to reject the
[46:57] preeminence of Jesus Christ would be to
[46:59] subject yourself to the power of
[47:01] Darkness so see he called you out from
[47:03] under that power and gave you a new
[47:06] headship the preeminence of Jesus Christ
[47:08] but lo and behold here come people after
[47:10] they're brought out but then they don't
[47:12] want to fall under the preeminence of
[47:13] Christ but to reject the preeminence of
[47:15] Christ would be to accept or or to be
[47:17] subject to this power of Darkness but
[47:19] listen what Paul said he says so then
[47:22] let not sin reain over you in your
[47:25] mortal body in other words don't let sin
[47:27] rule as a king over your life ain't that
[47:29] good in Romans the 6th chapter he said
[47:31] don't let it rule as a king over your
[47:33] mortal body that they that you should
[47:35] obey the lust thereof don't be obedient
[47:38] to sin don't let sin rule over your body
[47:40] don't let sin rule over your flesh I
[47:42] know the weak the weak backbone
[47:44] spineless pastors there are today that
[47:46] ain't got no uh way to preach people
[47:48] past having power over the flesh that
[47:51] they won't ever preach it no more and
[47:52] just allow people to live any way they
[47:54] want to but that ain't what the Bible
[47:56] said the Bible said don't let sin have
[47:58] power over your life Paul said you ought
[48:01] to be able to rain over it don't let it
[48:02] rain in your mortal body don't obey the
[48:05] lust of the flesh but overcoming it for
[48:07] sin shall not have dominion over you for
[48:10] you're not under the law but you're
[48:12] under grace don't back down to sin don't
[48:15] go back down that old path say well
[48:17] that's just my flesh and I just got to
[48:18] allow it and I'm always going to be
[48:20] going through it and I'll always be
[48:22] condemned and every week I'll be back at
[48:23] an altar but Paul said don't let sin
[48:26] have dominion over your life you're not
[48:28] under law but you're under grace and the
[48:31] grace of God brother brother Travis the
[48:34] brace grace of God has came to bring us
[48:36] out from under the Dominion of sin I
[48:38] think it's wonderful see sin can't rule
[48:40] you because you're not under the
[48:42] authority of it it it doesn't mean that
[48:45] you're not under an authority see a lot
[48:47] of people take that too far that God has
[48:49] delivered you and he's gave you dominion
[48:51] and and now you have an authority but
[48:52] that don't mean you're not under
[48:53] something because Paul goes on to say he
[48:56] said when you were Servants of sin you
[48:58] were free from righteousness but what
[49:00] fruit in other words what benefit what
[49:02] benefit had you in these thingss whereof
[49:05] you are now ashamed in other words what
[49:07] benefit did the old life that you live
[49:09] the things that you're ashamed of doing
[49:10] now what benefit did they ever do for
[49:12] you he said they they never done no
[49:15] benefit and the end of them is death he
[49:17] said but now being made free from sin
[49:20] and become a servant to God you have a
[49:22] different kind of benefit he said now
[49:25] you have benefits and your benefits are
[49:27] under Holiness and the end of it is
[49:29] everlasting life I I thought my isn't
[49:31] that that wonderful that he didn't leave
[49:33] us he did he didn't just leave us in
[49:35] this in this place of sin where
[49:37] something would have a rule over you but
[49:38] God called you out so that you could
[49:40] have power over sin he called you out
[49:42] that you could have authority over it so
[49:44] you could put it beneath you that you
[49:45] could conquer it once and for all and
[49:47] Satan would have no place in your life
[49:49] to lead you and to rule over you my to
[49:51] to to jerk you around and and pull you
[49:53] into trouble and pull you into
[49:55] situations well I've always been that
[49:57] way you know after all that's the way my
[49:59] mama was and that's the way my grandma
[50:00] was and I can't get away from it but
[50:02] Paul said but I say to the contrary
[50:04] don't fall under the Dominion of sin
[50:06] don't don't be under the Dominion of
[50:08] unbelief and allow your flesh to to fall
[50:11] into the lust of the flesh he said but
[50:13] be free the benefits of being free is is
[50:17] unto Holiness and unto everlasting life
[50:20] see so the authority of sin leads to
[50:22] death but the authority of God leads to
[50:23] life amen that makes me want to preach a
[50:25] little bit remember what Jesus did when
[50:27] he went into the temple here come a man
[50:29] that was filled with all these unclean
[50:31] spirits and devils and and everybody
[50:33] that tried he went to many churches and
[50:35] tried to get free of it but couldn't get
[50:36] free of it he' been down and had people
[50:38] lay hands on him but they couldn't get
[50:40] free but he came into the presence of
[50:41] Jesus one day and when it came into him
[50:44] Jesus began to speak to him and the
[50:45] demon inside of him said what do we got
[50:47] to do with thee oh Jesus of Nazareth and
[50:50] the Bible said but Jesus looked at him
[50:51] and he called the unclean devil and the
[50:54] devil came out of the man and the man
[50:55] left free and the people around them
[50:58] begin to say by what Authority and what
[51:00] power has he done this why how how would
[51:03] he have the ability to do such a thing
[51:04] as this he said for with authority and
[51:07] power He commands an unclean spirit and
[51:09] they came out that same Jesus brother
[51:11] Jared with authority and power he spoke
[51:14] to the Seas he spoke to the waves and
[51:16] the waves obeyed him he spoke to the
[51:17] wind and the wind obeyed him that same
[51:19] Authority and power when he walked down
[51:21] the street one day and he found that old
[51:23] fig tree that wasn't bringing forth
[51:25] fruit he cursed it and when he came came
[51:26] back forth it was cursed and it brought
[51:28] forth and it was laying there withered
[51:30] and dead you notice that the people
[51:32] around you begin to ask how did this
[51:34] happen and the Bible says when he come
[51:37] he the the disciples said Lord how do
[51:39] you have this kind of authority he said
[51:41] for verily I say unto you whosoever
[51:43] shall say to this mountain notice when
[51:44] they asked how he had it he told them
[51:47] how to get it I thought makes me want to
[51:48] dance he said whosoever shall say unto
[51:51] this mountain be thou removed and be
[51:53] cast into the sea for you shall not
[51:55] doubt in your heart but You Shall
[51:56] Believe the things which you say shall
[51:58] come to pass you shall have whatsoever
[52:01] you saith therefore I say unto you what
[52:03] thingss soever you desire When you pray
[52:06] believe that you receive them and you
[52:07] shall have them and when you stand
[52:09] praying forgive if you have ought
[52:11] against another that your father also
[52:13] which is in heaven May forgive you of
[52:15] your trespasses for if you do not
[52:16] forgive neither will your father which
[52:18] is in heaven forgive you and then they
[52:21] come to Jerusalem and as he was walking
[52:23] in the temple the Bible said There came
[52:24] unto him Chief priests and scribes and
[52:27] elders and they said by what Authority
[52:30] Dost thou do these things and who gave
[52:33] thee this authority to do these things
[52:36] my I thought isn't it something then
[52:38] Jesus wouldn't even answer their
[52:39] question he he threw a little Parable at
[52:41] them and said well if you can answer
[52:42] that well then I'll answer this but they
[52:44] couldn't answer it but you notice that
[52:46] even the he had enough Authority that
[52:49] even the critics recognize his authority
[52:51] they didn't come and say well you ain't
[52:53] got any authority to do this they said
[52:54] what give you the authority to do it
[52:56] what gave you the authority to take that
[52:58] Spirit out of that man what gave you the
[53:00] authority to heal the blinded eyes what
[53:02] gave you the authority to make the lame
[53:04] the wall and to and to take those that
[53:06] were blind and cause them to see but
[53:08] what Authority have you done these
[53:09] things he had authority over every
[53:12] Spirit he had authority over over all
[53:14] things he have authority over all of
[53:16] creation and brother Jared even over
[53:18] life and over death he had authority
[53:20] over them for Jesus said I laid down my
[53:23] life for my sheep he said no man can
[53:25] take it from me but I lay it down myself
[53:28] I have the power to lay it down and I
[53:30] have the power to raise it up again and
[53:32] I received this commandment from my
[53:34] father he wouldn't answer them but he
[53:37] tells the disciples said I've got the
[53:39] power to do it and I received it from my
[53:41] father to see a man that surrendered his
[53:45] his flesh so much to the will of God or
[53:48] the will of the father that not even
[53:50] death could rule over him isn't that
[53:52] wonderful he Soul surrendered to the
[53:55] will of the father that not even death
[53:57] had authority over him see what you
[53:59] surrender to becomes your Authority now
[54:03] you think about it when when whenever
[54:04] you whenever you surrender to something
[54:06] not only is it this not only does it
[54:09] have authority over you but it has
[54:11] Authority in you so the only Authority
[54:13] that you have is what you surrendered to
[54:16] so in other words you can say this your
[54:17] Authority is only as great as your
[54:19] surrender if you want to write something
[54:21] else down write that down your s your
[54:23] your Authority is as great as your
[54:25] surrender so the more you can surrender
[54:28] then the more Authority that you'll have
[54:30] so as the will of God begins to unfold
[54:32] in your life brother the card of what
[54:33] will happen is you surrender to the will
[54:35] of God and the more that you surrender
[54:37] to God's will then the authority to
[54:39] exact that will becomes greater and
[54:41] greater in your life the very things
[54:43] that that hold you down and hold you
[54:45] back but because you're surrendering to
[54:47] the will of God then this Authority
[54:48] begins to rise up in you and the Very
[54:50] things that come up say you can't do
[54:51] that to me no more see I've already
[54:53] surrendered that part of me to God I've
[54:55] G that part of over to God and the
[54:57] places where where Satan would destroy
[54:59] you say well you can't destroy me there
[55:01] anymore cuz I surrendered that to God
[55:03] and well you couldn't defeat this you
[55:04] know I couldn't defeat it on my own but
[55:06] I surrendered it to God I got such an
[55:09] addiction I couldn't get over it but I
[55:11] surrendered it to God and the more you
[55:13] surrender the more Authority that you
[55:15] have and then you can take the will of
[55:17] God and let the will of God take place
[55:20] over your life you see see there's so
[55:21] many things that that we can surrender
[55:23] or give into there you there there's so
[55:25] many people people in the world they
[55:27] surrender to theologies and surrender to
[55:29] church rules and people and and but we
[55:31] find this to be the case that God is
[55:33] always leading his church he he ain't
[55:35] just leaving us out there wondering what
[55:37] we should follow and what should we we
[55:38] should we we we should get into but he
[55:40] never leaves the church without a
[55:42] witness say see whenever Jesus ascended
[55:44] into into into Glory what did he do the
[55:46] Holy Ghost came back down to the church
[55:48] and led them when Moses led the children
[55:50] of Israel he led them all the way across
[55:52] the Wilderness but at the time of
[55:53] Moses's passing he didn't leave them
[55:55] stuck in the wilderness he raised up
[55:57] another man by the name of Joshua which
[55:59] was a type of the Holy Ghost he said
[56:01] you'll take him on in you're going to
[56:02] take him across the promised land you're
[56:04] going to divide their inheritance
[56:05] everything I said to Moses is still
[56:07] going to come to pass God will just
[56:09] raise up another man to carry on carry
[56:11] on God's plans so God never leaves his
[56:13] church without a witness he notice so as
[56:16] God is is doing this here here's what as
[56:18] he begins to speak to Joshua he says
[56:20] this book of the law shall not depart
[56:23] out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate
[56:25] therein day and night that thou mayest
[56:27] observe to do according to all that is
[56:29] written therein for then shall thou make
[56:31] thy way prosperous and then shall thou
[56:33] have good success I love this portion of
[56:35] scripture because when he says Thou
[56:37] shalt meditate most people read that and
[56:39] think well that means you just think on
[56:41] those things so so Joshua you need to
[56:43] think on this day and night but that
[56:44] word meditate in the Hebrew come the HEB
[56:47] from the Hebrew word haa which means to
[56:50] utter or to speak so here God says to
[56:52] Joshua the book of the law shall not
[56:55] depart out of thy mouth what these words
[56:57] that I've spoken unto Moses they're
[56:58] going to remain in your mouth but Thou
[57:00] shalt meditate on it day and night in
[57:01] other words not Not only would he look
[57:03] at it not only would he would he read it
[57:05] but he would speak it you you shall
[57:07] utter it and you shall speak it therein
[57:09] day and night that thou mayest observe
[57:11] to do according to all that is written
[57:12] therein I thought my isn't it something
[57:14] he said and what what he done with
[57:16] Joshua is what he had already done with
[57:18] Moses he said as I was with Moses so
[57:21] shall I be with thee well then then well
[57:23] my if You' have been Joshua you could
[57:24] have asked God the question well how was
[57:26] you with Moses but see Joshua already
[57:28] knew the answer he W he walked around
[57:30] with Moses and he saw what God done with
[57:32] Moses I'm just getting a foundation he
[57:34] saw what God done with Moses he saw how
[57:37] God took a man that a man that had no
[57:39] power and a man that didn't have the
[57:41] ability to hardly speak and God took him
[57:43] down there and he so surrendered his
[57:45] life to God that he became God to the
[57:47] people that he was leading Bible say
[57:50] what did he do he veiled himself in a
[57:52] prophet notice when he veiled himself in
[57:54] Moses but said notice he said the people
[57:56] think that something had happened to him
[57:58] he was different from the rest of the
[57:59] Israelites remember here Moses used to
[58:01] be an ordinary man but he got along with
[58:03] God and something be to happen to him
[58:05] and the more he surrendered to God the
[58:07] closer to God that he became that when
[58:09] he came before the people he said he was
[58:11] different than the priest his message
[58:13] was different he was different from
[58:15] anything he was a different person and
[58:16] the people seen something had happened
[58:19] and God had deail himself in his Prophet
[58:22] to speak his words to them notice that's
[58:24] what he had done he said because Moses
[58:27] was the Living Word to the people veiled
[58:30] by the pillar of fire that makes me want
[58:31] to Shadow over this building and he was
[58:33] speaking what was to later be veiled
[58:35] behind Badger skins so here God would
[58:38] send a man Moses that brought the word
[58:40] to the people when he came down off of a
[58:42] mountain and remember he had those old
[58:44] tables of stone but in order to reveal
[58:46] it Moses had to become God to the people
[58:49] you that he he brought the Commandments
[58:52] of God and they wouldn't even be able to
[58:53] receive it my is it something that if if
[58:56] if he wouldn't have done it they would
[58:57] never they they would have they would
[58:58] have thought it was Moses but if God's
[59:00] going to reveal it he said see the word
[59:01] had to come from Moses first see Moses
[59:04] had the word they were written by God
[59:06] nobody could interpret them Moses had to
[59:08] interpret them first that's the reason
[59:10] he veiled his face is it had to be
[59:13] interpreted by him listen so Moses comes
[59:16] down and he veils his face so that the
[59:18] people would look up on him and they
[59:20] wouldn't think that it came from a man
[59:22] that they would know it came from God
[59:23] but he veiled his face and he came with
[59:25] a power of God and he spoke the word of
[59:28] God with the authority of God but he had
[59:30] a veil upon him that the people wasn't
[59:32] no longer looking at a man but they were
[59:34] looking to the god that the man served
[59:36] the very God that he was anointed by the
[59:39] God that he had met down at the pillar
[59:41] of fire that had giving him the order to
[59:43] bring the law to the people of God you
[59:45] said why was he veiled so it so it
[59:47] wasn't Moses doing the revealing God
[59:50] veiled himself so they could see the god
[59:53] in him IM is there something he veiled
[59:55] him himself so when they looked they saw
[59:58] God my God God's a wonderful God he he
[1:00:01] thought all this out before we ever even
[1:00:02] got here we are thousands of years later
[1:00:04] but God thought all this through that he
[1:00:06] would Veil his Prophet that his word
[1:00:08] could come forth out of the mouth of a
[1:00:10] prophet and you could look past the face
[1:00:12] of the man and see the God that was
[1:00:13] speaking out of him that's what kind of
[1:00:15] God that we serve said here it is you
[1:00:18] think about it this word it had to be
[1:00:19] revealed same way with this Bible we can
[1:00:21] take this Bible we can carry it around
[1:00:23] and pack it and we we can we can we can
[1:00:25] take take it and try to uh uh interpret
[1:00:27] it and everything else but my said but
[1:00:29] it's got to be revealed and in order to
[1:00:31] reveal it Moses had to become God to the
[1:00:34] people I know people I'm hting a brick
[1:00:36] wall with that but that's what the Bible
[1:00:38] said Exodus 4th chapter and he shall be
[1:00:41] thy spokesman unto the People speaking
[1:00:43] of Aaron and he shall be and even he
[1:00:46] shall be to thee instead of a mouth and
[1:00:48] you shall be to him instead of a God
[1:00:50] that's what God told Moses so you'll be
[1:00:52] a God to him and he'll be your Prophet
[1:00:54] you'll be the God he'll be he'll be the
[1:00:56] mouthpiece that's able to speak he say
[1:00:58] see so so God had to come he veiled
[1:01:00] himself in a prophet of God that he
[1:01:02] could reveal his word to his children
[1:01:04] he's making a great promise a promise of
[1:01:07] entering into this Promised Land says so
[1:01:09] there he come he had to Veil himself
[1:01:11] because God is always behind the veil
[1:01:14] how many knows that remember we took a
[1:01:15] whole series on on Elohim and how that
[1:01:17] God has always veiled himself even in
[1:01:19] the beginning all the way through the
[1:01:21] the Book of Genesis I think it's some 31
[1:01:23] times or something in the in the first
[1:01:24] few verses that the the name Elohim is
[1:01:26] mentioned in the bible we call it all
[1:01:28] kinds of things we called it Jehovah we
[1:01:30] called it God we called it uh Jehovah
[1:01:33] Shem a different ones but but many when
[1:01:35] you read through Elohim Elohim Elohim
[1:01:37] why why is it Elohim because Elohim was
[1:01:40] was was was a was was God a a
[1:01:42] self-existing one he see we can make God
[1:01:45] anything we can make the speaker God but
[1:01:47] the go but the speaker can't self- exist
[1:01:49] it can't create itself it it it's not
[1:01:51] self-existent some man had to make it
[1:01:53] and so the word God isn't good enough to
[1:01:56] call God God so the Bible said it's
[1:01:57] Elohim this was the the the Revelation
[1:02:00] that Moses had it was Elohim he he was
[1:02:02] self-existent there wasn't none other
[1:02:04] but him and when he came down and and
[1:02:06] then he can come because of Moses's
[1:02:08] Revelation he realized that God could
[1:02:10] show himself in different forms he knew
[1:02:12] when he came to Abraham he could blow up
[1:02:14] a body Out of the Dust to the ground and
[1:02:16] step in the body and walk up and eat and
[1:02:18] eat and have fellowship with Abraham he
[1:02:20] knew that God could come and set in a
[1:02:22] burning bush behind a pillar of fire and
[1:02:24] the voice of God could speak out of that
[1:02:26] fire but yet it was still the same God
[1:02:28] he knew that God could come down in the
[1:02:30] garden and create a man and walk around
[1:02:32] and have fellowship with him in whatever
[1:02:35] form why because it's Elohim it's God
[1:02:38] veiled in different forms so God is
[1:02:41] always behind a veil and notice as he
[1:02:43] comes behind this Veil you realize says
[1:02:45] see so people can come under the
[1:02:47] authority of God's prophet and that's
[1:02:49] what set them free what set them people
[1:02:52] free in the days of Moses might as well
[1:02:55] just preach it
[1:02:56] what set them free in the days of Moses
[1:02:58] because they came under the authority of
[1:02:59] a prophet of God it wasn't because they
[1:03:02] all a sudden grew some boldness or they
[1:03:04] all of a sudden had some backbone and
[1:03:06] well I'm tired of this old Taskmaster
[1:03:08] and I'm tired of the whips and I'm tired
[1:03:10] of Egypt and I'm tired of laying bricks
[1:03:12] I'll tell you what I'll get up enough C
[1:03:13] it had nothing to do with it they
[1:03:15] surrendered to the to the prophet of God
[1:03:18] and they fell under the authority of
[1:03:20] God's prophet and then the authority of
[1:03:22] God's Prophet was birthed into
[1:03:24] them when they walked the enemy couldn't
[1:03:27] touch them when they when they were
[1:03:29] hungry food fed them when they were
[1:03:31] thirsty there was water in a rock when
[1:03:34] there was when there was sickness there
[1:03:35] was a place to go to be healed of their
[1:03:37] sickness why because they came under the
[1:03:39] authority of the prophet of God see it
[1:03:41] was that Authority that delivered them
[1:03:43] from the hand of their Taskmaster under
[1:03:45] the authority of
[1:03:46] Moses God gave instruction to the people
[1:03:49] of God that's how that's how he done it
[1:03:51] through Moses I think about what you say
[1:03:53] well what was it that saved their life
[1:03:55] it when the death angel came into Egypt
[1:03:58] remember it was the Judgment of God the
[1:04:00] plagues that struck Egypt but what was
[1:04:02] it that saved their life you say well
[1:04:04] anybody say well it was the blood on the
[1:04:05] door that saved their life well that and
[1:04:06] that is true but notice but where did
[1:04:08] the blood on the door come from can we
[1:04:10] just get right to it where did where did
[1:04:11] it come from you you think when the
[1:04:13] angel when that death angel came around
[1:04:15] Egypt and says but I've been given
[1:04:17] Authority well where did the Death Angel
[1:04:18] get his authority somebody answer me it
[1:04:20] was from Moses whenever he spoke he said
[1:04:22] according to the word of God what was it
[1:04:24] God to the people and he brought
[1:04:25] judgment upon Egypt out of the mouth of
[1:04:27] a prophet he said this judgment is going
[1:04:29] to strike the land the firstborn son
[1:04:31] they're going to die in this in all the
[1:04:33] land of Egypt and whenever the death
[1:04:35] angel went out through Egypt and it came
[1:04:36] over around the land of Goan and he went
[1:04:38] up there I just see that Old Death Angel
[1:04:40] knocking on the door I'm here to to
[1:04:42] exact the authority of the Prophet Moses
[1:04:44] and maybe some Daddy he throw his
[1:04:46] shoulders back and go meet him at the
[1:04:48] door and say well I've got an authority
[1:04:50] of the same Prophet Moses and he said if
[1:04:53] I put the blood on the door then you
[1:04:54] can't enter
[1:04:56] it was the same Authority that brought
[1:04:58] judgment it's the same Authority that
[1:05:00] brought life and brought salvation and
[1:05:02] brought grace to the children of Israel
[1:05:04] the same Prophet prophet's mouth that
[1:05:06] spoke judgment over Egypt is the same
[1:05:08] prophet's mouth that brought Liberty to
[1:05:09] those people that came under the
[1:05:12] authority of a prophet of God and under
[1:05:14] the authority of Moses glory to God
[1:05:17] glory under the authority of Moses they
[1:05:19] had power over a death angel the death
[1:05:22] angel that come that nobody could stop
[1:05:25] the death angel that the armies of
[1:05:26] Israel had no power over the death angel
[1:05:29] or or that the great armies of Egypt had
[1:05:31] no power the The Magicians of Egypt had
[1:05:34] no power the great pharaohs of Egypt had
[1:05:36] no power the gods of Egypt had no power
[1:05:39] but the children of Israel had power
[1:05:41] over the death angel under the authority
[1:05:45] of a prophet
[1:05:46] Moses listen under this Authority God
[1:05:50] positioned them behind the word of God
[1:05:53] in other let me say it like this can I
[1:05:55] say it this way way God positioned them
[1:05:57] behind the word of Moses to survive
[1:06:00] judgment it was God's word but Moses
[1:06:02] still spoke it and they took the words
[1:06:05] that Moses spoke can you imagine a
[1:06:06] people rising up in that day I know I'm
[1:06:08] smacking the spirit but can you imagine
[1:06:10] a people rising up in that day and said
[1:06:12] well I'll tell you what there ain't no
[1:06:13] man going to lead us out of here God
[1:06:15] said he was going to bring us a great
[1:06:16] warrior and God and God said he was
[1:06:18] going to come with a mighty hand of
[1:06:19] judgment and God said he there ain't no
[1:06:21] one man going to have the ability to do
[1:06:24] that but it didn't matter matter there
[1:06:26] was those when they heard it something
[1:06:27] about it the supernatural was moving in
[1:06:30] his life he he done things that other
[1:06:33] people couldn't do what was it it was
[1:06:34] God veiled in
[1:06:37] flesh no man has the ability to do
[1:06:39] anything any man that's ever done
[1:06:41] something Supernatural it was God in
[1:06:43] flesh whether it be me or you or anybody
[1:06:45] else it's never us but it's God veiled
[1:06:47] in flesh say see God positioned them
[1:06:50] behind the word of Moses to survive
[1:06:53] judgment and that's what God has done
[1:06:55] today to every believer brother Jared
[1:06:58] he's given us a position behind the word
[1:07:00] of God and placed us into the body of
[1:07:03] Jesus Christ that's why we can stand
[1:07:05] before every enemy in the middle of
[1:07:07] whatever would come our way whatever the
[1:07:09] lie that the devil would tell you say
[1:07:11] well but the Bible says I've been placed
[1:07:13] in my position behind the word of God
[1:07:15] can I read it to you Paul said but now
[1:07:17] hath God set in other words he's placed
[1:07:20] the members every one of them in the
[1:07:22] body as it has pleased him so not only
[1:07:24] did he place it but Brother David he
[1:07:26] placed us in our position so not only
[1:07:29] did he Place Us in the body he put us
[1:07:30] where he wanted us I know everybody
[1:07:32] wants to move around everybody wants to
[1:07:34] be something else cuz somebody else's
[1:07:35] position looks so much greater but
[1:07:37] friends let me tell you it ain't if you
[1:07:39] was where they are they'd say well I
[1:07:40] wish I was where you are and you were I
[1:07:42] where where I am but but but but it
[1:07:44] never changes we always we always want
[1:07:46] something different he said but but not
[1:07:48] only did he Place us but he put us in
[1:07:49] our position and then when Paul preaches
[1:07:52] this he takes our Natural Body and he
[1:07:53] begins to use it as a type and saying
[1:07:55] God has some hands and God has some feet
[1:07:57] and God has some eyes and God has some
[1:07:59] elbows and and God has some some hair
[1:08:02] and God has some ears and and God has
[1:08:04] some noses and he he he begins to to
[1:08:06] describe us as this natural body but we
[1:08:08] realized when he was describing it
[1:08:10] brother Xavier he don't we we wern't
[1:08:12] really hands and feet and noses to God
[1:08:14] but we were we were we were preachers
[1:08:16] and teachers and and lay members and
[1:08:18] prayer warriors and pastors and and
[1:08:20] Prophets and apostles and and Sunday
[1:08:23] school teachers and and and and sound
[1:08:25] tech Ians and and and janitors and and
[1:08:27] whatever that God put you in the church
[1:08:29] that you'd be a help to the church maybe
[1:08:31] you got a good job somewhere and you
[1:08:32] make money and you support the church
[1:08:34] that way but God places Us in the body
[1:08:36] for the furtherance of the gospel Paul
[1:08:39] said God put us there he said but notice
[1:08:41] what he does I love this I love this
[1:08:43] about God he said God knew that Satan
[1:08:46] would try to destroy the body so look
[1:08:48] what God does because he knows how Satan
[1:08:50] is so he knows that Satan would try to
[1:08:52] destroy it and he says well just as some
[1:08:54] parts of the natural body are less
[1:08:56] desirable than others Paul says so what
[1:08:58] God done is he gave more abundant honor
[1:09:00] to the less desirable Parts I don't want
[1:09:02] to be a pinky toe in God's arm you know
[1:09:05] in in the body of Christ I I want to be
[1:09:07] a I want to be a bicep or you know I I
[1:09:09] don't I don't want to be this be said
[1:09:10] but he gave more honor more abundant
[1:09:13] honor to the Lesser so that there's no
[1:09:15] Schism in the body how many knows what a
[1:09:17] Schism is it's a division so Paul says
[1:09:20] so what God did is he gave more abundant
[1:09:23] honor to the less desirable parts of the
[1:09:26] body so what you say you may say well
[1:09:28] what what I'm doing ain't much and you
[1:09:30] know I they don't even need me at the
[1:09:31] church you know I I may as well just not
[1:09:34] even go they don't replace me anyhow
[1:09:36] they don't even want me there they they
[1:09:37] don't want to use me they you know they
[1:09:39] just kind of put me to the side but Paul
[1:09:40] said but it doesn't matter what part God
[1:09:42] put you in God put you in a position in
[1:09:44] the body of Jesus Christ he put you in a
[1:09:46] place God needs you there he wants you
[1:09:48] there he placed you there and when you
[1:09:50] don't feel like it's honorable Paul said
[1:09:52] but God gave more abundant honor to the
[1:09:54] less desired able position so that
[1:09:57] there's no division in the body in other
[1:09:59] words they're equal value what that does
[1:10:02] brother Dave it keeps you that that old
[1:10:04] spirit of jealousy that comes in well
[1:10:06] you know that one gets to do more and
[1:10:07] that one does more and they and they use
[1:10:09] more and they preach more and they sing
[1:10:11] more and they they play more and all all
[1:10:13] the things that comes in but it keeps
[1:10:14] all that jealousy out of the body
[1:10:16] because we're all equally valuable in
[1:10:18] the kingdom of God friends if I can I
[1:10:20] just say something from my heart you
[1:10:22] know if we could ever get to the place
[1:10:24] to where when you're your kids sing I
[1:10:26] say my what a wonderful job they did and
[1:10:29] when my kids sang you'd say the same
[1:10:31] thing you'd see a people on fire for God
[1:10:34] you'd see a church where the Devil
[1:10:35] Couldn't get into if you ever if you
[1:10:38] could ever get to a place to where when
[1:10:41] your kids go do something at the school
[1:10:43] that I can say man they did a great job
[1:10:44] I don't have to say well well my kid
[1:10:46] could do a lot better job than that I
[1:10:48] say well they did a great job I'm so
[1:10:49] proud of you if you could treat their
[1:10:51] kids like you do your kids and they
[1:10:52] could treat your kids like they do their
[1:10:54] kids then there wouldn't be no division
[1:10:56] in the body say see because they're all
[1:10:59] valuable they're all equal I thank God
[1:11:02] for every one of them I if you just look
[1:11:03] at I'm using the kids for an example but
[1:11:05] it goes for the parents too I've seen
[1:11:07] some sister had some uh deal posted or
[1:11:10] Sent send a picture to my wife about
[1:11:13] about something they had had built over
[1:11:15] there I thought well my whoever did that
[1:11:16] did an outstanding job I wish they'd
[1:11:18] decorate for my part but why because
[1:11:21] they they did a good job whatever
[1:11:23] happened just telling people they did a
[1:11:24] good job is is there something if if I
[1:11:27] if I missed something if I lost my mind
[1:11:29] but what happened just telling people
[1:11:30] you did a good job and my I'm proud of
[1:11:32] you for what you do and I I'm proud of
[1:11:34] the gift that God gave you and my if
[1:11:36] there's any way I could ever help you
[1:11:37] let me know and and if you can ever help
[1:11:39] me I'll certainly let you
[1:11:41] know whatever
[1:11:43] happened that's free anyway let me get
[1:11:45] back to my
[1:11:46] message he said God gave him more
[1:11:48] abundant honor to the less desirable so
[1:11:51] there would be no division in the body
[1:11:53] so when you're in a place and you're in
[1:11:55] in this position you feel like well it's
[1:11:56] not a very desirable position I ain't
[1:11:58] going to ask you to raise hands
[1:12:00] sometimes we feel that way it ain't a
[1:12:01] very desirable place I wish I was where
[1:12:04] this person is said but he give more
[1:12:06] abundant honor are you listening to the
[1:12:08] word he give more abundant honor to the
[1:12:11] less desirable position so that there's
[1:12:13] no division in the
[1:12:15] body equal value see see we're all
[1:12:18] equally valuable in the kingdom of God
[1:12:22] friends you want to see a church on fire
[1:12:23] for God and a church that's growing and
[1:12:25] moving and in a Revival you catch what
[1:12:27] Paul's preaching right here catch what
[1:12:30] he's preaching that we're all equally
[1:12:31] valuable in the body of Christ God sets
[1:12:34] people in church he's one that places us
[1:12:37] and you know what he gets us all out of
[1:12:39] some other places we all come from
[1:12:40] different backgrounds you know they're
[1:12:42] they're a lot different but they're a
[1:12:43] lot the same we all come from from
[1:12:45] something you every one of us could
[1:12:47] probably tie some things in our family
[1:12:49] back to some bad things or some drugs or
[1:12:51] some alcohol or some mistakes that
[1:12:53] somebody made or all that stuff that
[1:12:54] would come but let me tell you something
[1:12:56] about God God gets his people from the
[1:12:58] worst places possible man I get to
[1:13:00] thinking about how he done it from the
[1:13:01] he he he takes them from the worst place
[1:13:03] and he leads him right into the house of
[1:13:04] God I got a couple minutes remember
[1:13:06] remember what he done this is what this
[1:13:08] is what happened I thought about the
[1:13:09] worst one I could think of tonight it
[1:13:11] was a man by the name of apostle Paul
[1:13:13] and here that man he was a sinner and
[1:13:15] you know what he took that man that was
[1:13:17] a sinner here was a man that was lost
[1:13:19] here was a man that that was against God
[1:13:21] and God LED that man down a path to
[1:13:23] Salvation so that God could use it him
[1:13:25] you say God led him that's what God done
[1:13:27] the Bible says that Paul was on his road
[1:13:29] to Damascus let me ask you this question
[1:13:31] what caused Paul to go down the road to
[1:13:32] Damascus the Bible said he had a desire
[1:13:35] in his heart that he wanted to kill
[1:13:36] Christians or he wanted to take them and
[1:13:38] put them in jail but what put the desire
[1:13:40] in Paul's heart to go in there the Bible
[1:13:42] says he was breathing out threatenings
[1:13:44] and Slaughter against the Disciples of
[1:13:45] the Lord and he went in under the high
[1:13:47] priest and he desired of him letters to
[1:13:49] Damascus to the synagogues and he and as
[1:13:52] he journeyed he came near under Damascus
[1:13:54] and suddenly there shined around about
[1:13:56] him a light from Heaven I thought my is
[1:13:58] it something let me tell you what
[1:13:59] happened God sent him to Damascus to
[1:14:02] save Christians God sent Paul how many
[1:14:04] believes that God sent Paul to Damascus
[1:14:07] it was God's purpose for him to go to
[1:14:09] Damascus in the beginning before Paul
[1:14:11] ever took the first life before he ever
[1:14:13] took the took the first one and put him
[1:14:15] in prison before stevenh was ever stoned
[1:14:18] God had already purposed for Paul to go
[1:14:20] down the road to Damascus he purposed
[1:14:22] for him to spend time there and to
[1:14:24] preach the gospel and to find God and to
[1:14:26] be filled with the Holy Ghost and to see
[1:14:28] the supernatural happen in his life so
[1:14:31] somewhere in this Sinner's life God
[1:14:33] begins to deal with him and in this
[1:14:35] Sinner's life he goes down to the
[1:14:37] synagogue he says I need some transport
[1:14:39] papers that I can go get some Christians
[1:14:41] and in his in this Sinner's life there's
[1:14:43] some this desire caused him to go down
[1:14:45] to this road to Damascus let me tell you
[1:14:47] friends it wasn't an accident that God
[1:14:49] met him on that road it wasn't a a
[1:14:51] chance happening that God met him on
[1:14:53] that road but God planned to be be there
[1:14:55] before the foundation of the world he
[1:14:57] drove that man to get the papers and he
[1:15:00] drove him to walk down the road and
[1:15:01] something in his heart caused him to
[1:15:03] come right into contact with God here he
[1:15:06] was fighting against God and the whole
[1:15:08] time God was still leading him glory to
[1:15:10] God that's how God is that's the
[1:15:12] sovereignty of our God when you spend
[1:15:14] your life and you're fighting God I'll
[1:15:16] never go to church I ain't going to
[1:15:17] serve God I'm just going to quit I ain't
[1:15:20] going to be a Christian this ain't
[1:15:21] nothing but a bunch of nonsense but in
[1:15:23] all your fighting God brought you right
[1:15:25] here to to to see that very Supernatural
[1:15:27] lie begin to speak to your heart and say
[1:15:30] I called you from the beginning I knew
[1:15:32] you before the foundation of the world
[1:15:34] I've called you for a purpose you ain't
[1:15:35] going back into the world you're my son
[1:15:38] quit looking and comparing yourself to
[1:15:40] the rest of the world saying I got to be
[1:15:42] like them so I can be somebody I got to
[1:15:44] be like them so I can fit in you ain't
[1:15:47] ever going to fit in with them but
[1:15:49] you'll fit in here why because you're a
[1:15:52] part of the body of Jesus Christ he went
[1:15:55] down to Damascus and God brought him
[1:15:58] there listen when God put this desire in
[1:16:01] his heart I thought my a it's something
[1:16:03] that while he was yet a sinner God
[1:16:05] caused him to go the way God wanted him
[1:16:07] to go so if God can take a sinner and
[1:16:10] God can lead a sinner down a road where
[1:16:12] God wants to meet him then what do you
[1:16:14] think God can do with somebody like
[1:16:16] you a Son of God and a daughter of God
[1:16:19] that's already gave their heart to the
[1:16:20] Lord if God can lead a sinner don't you
[1:16:22] think God can't lead you and I
[1:16:25] he could lead us the Bible says he was
[1:16:27] filled with the Holy Ghost men came to
[1:16:30] take him but notice when they come to
[1:16:32] take him God spoke he said he's a chosen
[1:16:35] vessel unto me to Bear my name before
[1:16:37] the Gentiles and Kings and the children
[1:16:40] of Israel he was a messenger that was
[1:16:42] chosen by God in the first church age
[1:16:44] brother Jared he demonstrated the power
[1:16:46] of the Holy Ghost there was no other
[1:16:48] Ministry in that day that could compare
[1:16:49] to Paul's Ministry how many believe that
[1:16:51] there were no no other Ministry matter
[1:16:53] of fact there he he was a man that was
[1:16:55] that was sent from God and he had the
[1:16:57] authority of God and and Paul said and
[1:16:59] though we are an angel from heaven
[1:17:01] preach any other gospel unto you a man
[1:17:02] that had so much Authority he could say
[1:17:04] these words listen if an angel from
[1:17:07] heaven were to speak any other gospel
[1:17:10] unto you than that which I have already
[1:17:11] preached let it be a
[1:17:13] cursed a man that had enough authority
[1:17:16] to say if an angel from heaven would
[1:17:17] speak something that's different than
[1:17:19] what I've already preached let him be a
[1:17:21] cursed he said for do I now persuade men
[1:17:23] or God or do I seek to please men for if
[1:17:27] I yet please men I should not be the
[1:17:29] servant of Christ but my he puts a stamp
[1:17:32] on it right here Paul says but I certify
[1:17:35] you Brethren that the gospel which was
[1:17:37] preached of me is not after man for I
[1:17:40] neither received it of man neither was I
[1:17:42] taught it but by the revelation of Jesus
[1:17:45] Christ the in other words The Authority
[1:17:47] that I have came from God the authority
[1:17:51] that I have came on the road to Damascus
[1:17:53] The Authority that I have came from a
[1:17:55] supernatural experience when God came
[1:17:57] down and he began to speak to my heart
[1:17:59] friends don't you realize that his
[1:18:00] authority that that that came that that
[1:18:03] came from the Jews was defeated by a
[1:18:06] higher authority Paul was already had an
[1:18:08] authority he had an authority to go take
[1:18:09] Christians but that Authority that he
[1:18:11] had that man giv Authority that the Jews
[1:18:13] said you go down and you capture them
[1:18:15] and you bring them into jail but that
[1:18:16] Jewish giv Authority was overridden by a
[1:18:19] higher authority and all of a sudden
[1:18:21] that Authority that he was given by
[1:18:23] those Jews didn't mean anything to him
[1:18:24] anymore more because there was a higher
[1:18:26] authority that was leading his life but
[1:18:28] he just started chunking papers I don't
[1:18:30] want them nowhere near me why because
[1:18:32] I've given over to a higher
[1:18:34] authority you may have an authority see
[1:18:37] because of our fall in the garden we
[1:18:38] were given an authority to sin because
[1:18:41] of the fall in the garden you was given
[1:18:42] an authority the Bible said we're free
[1:18:44] moral agents we we had the ability to go
[1:18:46] out into sin you go you can serve the
[1:18:48] devil you you can do what you want to
[1:18:49] but when you come in contact with God
[1:18:52] that higher authority causes you to live
[1:18:54] by something greater then you can look
[1:18:56] back at the Devil and say them old them
[1:18:57] old papers that you gave me you know I'm
[1:18:59] a I'm a big man and I can do what I want
[1:19:01] and I'm a I'm a big girl and I can do I
[1:19:03] I'll throw all that aside and I just
[1:19:04] surrender to a higher authority and let
[1:19:06] me do the will of God he cast aside all
[1:19:09] his rights and papers all that from the
[1:19:11] council laid it aside and then he took a
[1:19:13] hold of the pillar of fire and he went
[1:19:15] on to lead the Church of God is't that
[1:19:18] wonderful how many knows this that that
[1:19:19] same Pillar of Fire is still leading the
[1:19:21] church today the pillar of fire that has
[1:19:23] it still has the the same authority over
[1:19:26] every Spirit he has the same authority
[1:19:28] over every thought it has the same
[1:19:29] authority over all of our intentions it
[1:19:31] has the authority over the desire of our
[1:19:34] flesh it's the same Authority today you
[1:19:37] think about it it it's the authority of
[1:19:39] a prophet of God and you what them
[1:19:41] people did they followed Paul's Ministry
[1:19:43] because he had an authority from God see
[1:19:45] what what does that mean that means the
[1:19:46] authority of a prophet think about it
[1:19:48] when a when a prophet of God come into
[1:19:50] the day in the age we live in brother
[1:19:52] brother David what happened is he had an
[1:19:53] authority from God God and when he spoke
[1:19:56] demons fled and when he spoke sicknesses
[1:19:58] left off of sick bodies and when he
[1:20:00] spoke flesh the the flesh surrendered to
[1:20:02] the will of God and what did he do but
[1:20:04] he restored the faith of the church back
[1:20:06] to what it was 2,000 years ago when
[1:20:08] people wonder can God should do that
[1:20:10] anymore can God still move in the
[1:20:12] Supernatural is there still anything as
[1:20:14] the Holy Ghost is there still a power of
[1:20:16] God can God still do Miracles friends
[1:20:19] don't you realize this is the debate of
[1:20:20] the church it looked like it had all
[1:20:22] been lost it had looked like it had
[1:20:24] fallen aside to where churches today
[1:20:26] they'll put men in their pull pits and
[1:20:27] they'll stand up and tell you that God
[1:20:29] can't even do it anymore cuz they don't
[1:20:31] know how to make it happen but I thank
[1:20:33] God that there was one that went down
[1:20:35] the road one day and met the angel of
[1:20:37] the Lord that said you go let my people
[1:20:39] know that the same Authority that met
[1:20:42] Moses and the same Authority that met
[1:20:44] Apostle Paul is still alive in the year
[1:20:46] of
[1:20:47] 2024 and he can still do the same work
[1:20:50] that he always
[1:20:51] done it's the authority of God you
[1:20:54] listen in the days of Moses the Bible
[1:20:56] says the Shadow King was in their Camp
[1:20:58] why he said cuz God was with them he was
[1:21:00] Healing The Sick he was doing miracles
[1:21:02] signs and wonders and the pillar of fire
[1:21:04] hung over them and Moses followed after
[1:21:06] the pillar of fire and the children of
[1:21:08] Israel followed after
[1:21:10] Moses and they went on their road to the
[1:21:12] promised land and there ain't nothing
[1:21:14] would stop them he said that Pillar of
[1:21:16] Fire is still alive today my goodness
[1:21:20] that Pillar of Fire is still alive today
[1:21:22] he's still the same yesterday to day and
[1:21:24] forever the word still lives the same
[1:21:27] light brother Carter that led Paul that
[1:21:30] same lie that that met Moses that that
[1:21:32] same lie is still leading the church
[1:21:35] today what is it that causes God to come
[1:21:38] down into a Congregation of people and
[1:21:39] minister to their hearts me and sister
[1:21:41] Vanna she was talking about the other
[1:21:43] day she said you know me and one of my
[1:21:45] friends we was talking about the
[1:21:46] strangest thing something that you would
[1:21:48] never talk about to anybody and I told
[1:21:50] her I said you know what I feel like I
[1:21:51] feel like one of those those punching
[1:21:53] bags that has sand in the bottom of it
[1:21:55] and the devil just keeps punching me and
[1:21:56] I just keep going to the ground she said
[1:21:58] if I didn't come in church the next
[1:21:59] service and you got in there preaching
[1:22:01] and the spirit of the Lord started
[1:22:02] moving and you said you know what
[1:22:04] sometimes we feel like one of them old
[1:22:06] punching bags that stands up that has
[1:22:08] sand in the bottom of it and the devil
[1:22:09] just keeps punching us and we just keep
[1:22:11] falling down but I thank God that
[1:22:12] there's something there that caused us
[1:22:14] to keep Rising back up you say well what
[1:22:17] is it it's that same Pillar of Fire the
[1:22:19] Bible says the word of God is a
[1:22:21] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:22:22] intents of our heart and you come in it
[1:22:24] ain't some man-made some madeup sermon
[1:22:27] some microwave something to give to the
[1:22:29] people of God but it's a fresh anointing
[1:22:31] from Heaven from allmighty God out of
[1:22:33] the mouth of God to speak to his
[1:22:35] children it's a Living Word we ain't
[1:22:38] serving some dead God we're serving a
[1:22:39] living God we ain't serving some some
[1:22:42] history lesson or some gospel of the
[1:22:44] past I'm talking about a God that's
[1:22:46] still alive today that still ministers
[1:22:48] to his children he gives you faith in
[1:22:50] what you believe he encourages you in
[1:22:52] your faith and say just hold the faith
[1:22:54] if you don't understand it just stick
[1:22:55] around a little while until the
[1:22:57] revelation of the words tracks your
[1:22:59] heart and God can bring you up to
[1:23:01] another level the word still
[1:23:04] lives it's leading the church today
[1:23:07] think about it what a thought the same
[1:23:10] one that called Moses same one that
[1:23:12] called B Paul is the same one that
[1:23:15] called
[1:23:16] you isn't that good you ever just think
[1:23:19] about that God come down and he spoke to
[1:23:21] Moses and he called him out by name he
[1:23:24] said I'm the god of
[1:23:26] Moses I'm the god of apostle Paul I'm
[1:23:30] the god of David
[1:23:32] mcgar see it don't kind of sounds a
[1:23:35] little different when you say your own
[1:23:36] name don't it but that's the God we
[1:23:38] serve the same one that called them is
[1:23:41] the same one that called you I'm the god
[1:23:43] of Carter Morris I'm the god that called
[1:23:46] you I've called you in this age to be
[1:23:48] able to recognize who you are what you
[1:23:52] have you realize this church today I'm
[1:23:54] going to close with
[1:23:56] this the modern church today they don't
[1:23:58] recognize what they
[1:24:00] have you think about this see I got to
[1:24:03] think about that old you know Benjamin
[1:24:06] Franklin when he went out searching for
[1:24:08] electricity remember the experiment and
[1:24:10] him and his son I believe it was they
[1:24:12] they put that old that cord up in the
[1:24:14] air and they got one cord that was wet
[1:24:16] so it would be able to carry a current
[1:24:17] and they built a kite and they were
[1:24:18] originally going to do it on top of a
[1:24:19] church but they he thought he could get
[1:24:21] the same thing out of a kite and brother
[1:24:23] but Tommy put that on that string and
[1:24:24] then he got that Silk string and tied to
[1:24:26] it and it was dry cuz he didn't want to
[1:24:27] catch a hold of the current so he went
[1:24:28] in hid behind the barn and held hold of
[1:24:30] the silk string and the other string
[1:24:31] went up had the key attached to it at
[1:24:33] the bottom and at the bottom of it there
[1:24:35] was that old Laden or or lien jar you
[1:24:37] which was like a modern-day capacitor is
[1:24:39] when they first started coming out with
[1:24:41] him it may then it was 15 years old or
[1:24:42] something before Benjamin Franklin had
[1:24:45] had his experiment and so here here he
[1:24:47] took this jar and he put and he put that
[1:24:50] that key in it and they set it out there
[1:24:51] and him and his boy and they put it
[1:24:53] right in the middle of the Thundercloud
[1:24:54] and after a little bit all of a sudden
[1:24:56] he seen the the the the the hairs or the
[1:24:58] the little thread standing up on that
[1:25:00] string he said so he knew there was some
[1:25:02] kind something static that had got a
[1:25:03] hold of it and so as it came down and it
[1:25:06] came down into that jar and then
[1:25:08] Benjamin Franklin took a hold of it and
[1:25:09] he got to telling everybody he said the
[1:25:11] lightning struck the key or something
[1:25:13] there's there's something struck the key
[1:25:14] and it's run down and it's hit the
[1:25:15] bottle and he got the he got to telling
[1:25:17] everybody I got it I got it I got it and
[1:25:20] then they said well use it use it use it
[1:25:22] well I don't know how is't that the way
[1:25:23] it is say I got it but I don't know what
[1:25:25] to do with it I got it but I don't know
[1:25:27] what it is I got it but I don't know the
[1:25:29] power of it but I got it there's
[1:25:31] something in the jar but I just don't
[1:25:32] know what to do with it see the lighting
[1:25:34] jar was full but there had to come
[1:25:36] somebody that that that would help them
[1:25:38] find out what to do with it so he said
[1:25:40] see brother say that's the way it is
[1:25:41] with people today is that God saved you
[1:25:43] but they just don't know what they had
[1:25:45] so they go around they go around saying
[1:25:47] I got it I got it I got it but we just
[1:25:49] don't know what we got but then there
[1:25:50] come another man that was that that was
[1:25:52] anointed for the hour by the name of
[1:25:54] Thomas Edison and he took that very
[1:25:56] thing and he said if there's power if
[1:25:58] there's a way to catch power then
[1:25:59] there's a way to send it and there's a
[1:26:01] way to transfer and if it'll go up and
[1:26:02] down that wire there's got to be a cable
[1:26:04] or a wire or something somewhere that
[1:26:06] you can travel that back and forth one
[1:26:08] to another and thousands of times that
[1:26:10] he tried to make that work and it failed
[1:26:12] and over and over and it failed and he
[1:26:14] tried and he failed and he tried and
[1:26:16] finally he got a hold of the right wire
[1:26:18] and but said that's the same way it is
[1:26:20] today with many of the church people
[1:26:22] they say well God saved me from sin he
[1:26:24] said certainly he did but then they say
[1:26:27] well but I don't know what I got he said
[1:26:28] but that same God that saved you from
[1:26:30] sin well then there's power in there
[1:26:32] that he can use to work on you so if he
[1:26:35] can save you if there's something in the
[1:26:37] bottle then God can do something with
[1:26:39] what's in the bottle he said so the god
[1:26:41] that saved you he's he can also give you
[1:26:43] happiness the god that saved you can
[1:26:45] give you peace the god that saved you
[1:26:47] can give you Joy the god that saved you
[1:26:48] can heal your body the god that Sav you
[1:26:50] can Rapture this church into Glory
[1:26:53] there's power laying in in the jar if
[1:26:55] you only knew how to tap into the what
[1:26:57] was in the jar said this what Thomas
[1:26:59] Edison believed the people thought he
[1:27:01] was crazy but he knew was right he knew
[1:27:02] that something told him current would
[1:27:04] travel through that wire so he kept on
[1:27:05] trying wires until he found one that the
[1:27:08] current would follow and when he did he
[1:27:10] gave the world electricity now is that
[1:27:13] something in the natural here's these
[1:27:14] men that were that were or ordained to
[1:27:17] to be able to to bring
[1:27:19] electricity it was God's purpose for us
[1:27:21] to have it and here they they were
[1:27:23] fighting to do it but in the spiritual
[1:27:24] it was the same thing he said what God
[1:27:27] was doing he said it was God going to
[1:27:29] give light to the world with his own
[1:27:31] electricity this is what happened in the
[1:27:33] days of Paul God wanted to give it to
[1:27:35] the world he said it had been there all
[1:27:37] the time it was here all the time but
[1:27:39] they just didn't know how to harness it
[1:27:41] and to make it work you realize they
[1:27:43] didn't nobody invent electricity Ben
[1:27:45] Franklin didn't invent electricity he
[1:27:46] didn't find it they knew it was there
[1:27:48] they seen lightning and storms all they
[1:27:50] did was figured out a way to channel it
[1:27:52] so that you could apply and you could
[1:27:54] use it and you could turn on a switch
[1:27:56] and you could have Li and big old uh uh
[1:27:58] oh some of them big Old Dutch made
[1:27:59] biscuits you know the the big old fluffy
[1:28:01] ones with a flow on top of them why
[1:28:03] because you got some electricity that
[1:28:05] you can cook in and make everything just
[1:28:07] right he say see but they were they had
[1:28:09] to have a way to harness it he said and
[1:28:11] now that same holy spirit that fell on
[1:28:13] the day of Pentecost that's healed the
[1:28:15] sick back there it's been in the church
[1:28:17] the whole time but the thing of it is is
[1:28:20] you don't know how to make it work for
[1:28:22] you it was there all along from the days
[1:28:24] of Jesus and the days of Paul that same
[1:28:27] Supernatural power of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:29] it's been there all the time the power
[1:28:31] to heal the sick it's been there all the
[1:28:33] time the power to raise the dead it's
[1:28:35] been there all the time the power to
[1:28:37] make a Rapture he said it's been there
[1:28:39] all along but they don't know how to
[1:28:41] make it work for you but here's the
[1:28:43] thing that makes it work is Faith to
[1:28:45] believe and when you believe and take
[1:28:47] him out his word that's the lifeline and
[1:28:50] it cannot fail my it makes me want to
[1:28:52] preach all over this building brother
[1:28:54] the Jared it was there all along when
[1:28:56] Paul met him it came under a different
[1:28:58] Authority his ministry was to introduce
[1:29:00] people introduce people to Christ and he
[1:29:03] done just that here we come down to
[1:29:05] today 2,000 years ago or 2,000 years
[1:29:07] later and that same Miracle working
[1:29:09] power that's been there all along that
[1:29:11] same Supernatural power that that was
[1:29:13] there there in the Bible days has been
[1:29:14] laying and waiting in this age for
[1:29:16] somebody to contact it and to be able to
[1:29:19] use it listen what God done so he brings
[1:29:23] that Pillar of Fire as the music players
[1:29:25] want to come brings that Pillar of Fire
[1:29:27] in this age that same Pillar of Fire
[1:29:30] that met Moses the same Pillar of Fire
[1:29:32] that met Paul here come a prophet of God
[1:29:35] that would meet that same Pillar of Fire
[1:29:36] again Brother David what would it what
[1:29:38] was the purpose of it says see well what
[1:29:40] was it when Moses came on the scene he
[1:29:42] had a revelation how many realizes that
[1:29:44] the Bible Moses didn't have a bible to
[1:29:45] read I know that's hard for people they
[1:29:48] think the Bible's just been this thing
[1:29:49] that God handed down magically to people
[1:29:51] you realize it was men that wrote it
[1:29:52] inspired by God
[1:29:54] Moses didn't have a bible to read
[1:29:56] neither did all the people before Moses
[1:29:58] but he had a revelation of God and he
[1:30:00] sat down under that Revelation and he
[1:30:02] wrote these books of the Bible then
[1:30:04] finally they could go on and somebody
[1:30:05] could have something read but up until
[1:30:07] that time it was only by Revelation it
[1:30:09] was only by somebody coming by and
[1:30:11] saying the Lord told me to tell you the
[1:30:13] Lord spoke to me and the Lord said go
[1:30:15] here it was only that that's the way God
[1:30:17] worked so see what makes it so foreign
[1:30:20] to think that God could come today and
[1:30:22] Lead his children he'll take that same
[1:30:25] word he' never preach a different gospel
[1:30:26] Paul said he wouldn't said he had
[1:30:28] preached the same thing if anybody
[1:30:29] preach something different let it be a
[1:30:30] curse it had to be the same word said
[1:30:32] but Moses done it how did he do it he
[1:30:34] met God in the form of the pillar of
[1:30:36] fire veiled in a pillar of fire when
[1:30:38] Paul met him on the road he met him in
[1:30:40] the form of a pillar of fire Veil behind
[1:30:42] a pillar of fire he said and think of it
[1:30:44] that same Pillar of Fire that come upon
[1:30:46] these men that wrote the Bible is the
[1:30:48] same Pillar of Fire here today
[1:30:50] interpreting the Bible the Bible says
[1:30:53] that there ain't no PR
[1:30:55] interpretation but if it took a prophet
[1:30:57] to write it and there's a mystery in the
[1:30:59] Bible that's what the Bible says mystery
[1:31:01] to be made plain if there's a mystery in
[1:31:04] the Bible it took a prophet to write it
[1:31:05] what do you think God would use to
[1:31:06] reveal
[1:31:08] it see say so here's God today the same
[1:31:11] Pillar of Fire so you realize it wasn't
[1:31:14] the men that wrote it to start with it
[1:31:16] wasn't Paul that had that Authority it
[1:31:18] was the pillar of fire it was the Holy
[1:31:20] Ghost in Paul that gave him that
[1:31:21] Authority it wasn't Moses that had it it
[1:31:24] wasn't William brandham that had it
[1:31:26] there was the Holy Ghost in them you
[1:31:28] said well what gives me that Authority
[1:31:30] because that same Holy Ghost is in you
[1:31:33] man isn't that something it ain't to it
[1:31:34] ain't to idolize somebody or to worship
[1:31:37] some man or some goofy stuff that people
[1:31:39] do but it's to recognize the power of
[1:31:42] God in human flesh Paul said it was the
[1:31:45] mystery he said it was Christ The
[1:31:47] Mystery of God revealed it was Christ in
[1:31:49] you what did he say it was Christ in you
[1:31:51] it was the hope of all glory that's the
[1:31:54] mystery that Paul wanted the church to
[1:31:55] see is Christ dwelling in a human being
[1:31:59] but here we are today it's that same
[1:32:00] Pillar of Fire under the authority of
[1:32:02] the Angel of the Lord preach what Paul
[1:32:05] preached by Revelation and led the
[1:32:07] church back to that same Pillar of Fire
[1:32:09] again I don't know about you but I thank
[1:32:11] God for for men that find the way I
[1:32:16] don't I don't have to look at one say
[1:32:17] well I wish I had what he had I wish I
[1:32:19] was that per you know my position ain't
[1:32:21] what that person we all have different
[1:32:23] positions
[1:32:24] but God uses them we weren't all Ben
[1:32:26] Franklin's we weren't all Thomas Edison
[1:32:30] we did all invent a light bulb but we
[1:32:32] all get to use it so I don't go and say
[1:32:36] well I would you know why they give
[1:32:37] Thomas Ed so much credit y'all can talk
[1:32:38] about him all you want to don't bother
[1:32:40] me a bit I use a light every day see it
[1:32:42] don't bother me you can say who did it
[1:32:44] that's good talk about it thank God for
[1:32:46] the men that God used thank God for the
[1:32:50] holy ghost that led the church he said
[1:32:52] it's that same pillar of fire that led
[1:32:55] the church again what is it brother Joe
[1:32:57] if you don't stand to your feet it's a
[1:32:59] Damascus
[1:33:00] Authority it's what gave Paul an
[1:33:02] authority when he was on that road that
[1:33:04] day and changed him from being the
[1:33:07] authority of the flesh into the under
[1:33:09] the authority of God it's what gives us
[1:33:11] a right that's what gives us a right to
[1:33:13] stand in the pull pit and preach the
[1:33:14] gospel but said there ain't no man has a
[1:33:16] theological degree or some doctors gree
[1:33:18] has a right behind the pull pit to claim
[1:33:19] the message of Jesus Christ until he's
[1:33:21] first met God face to face in the pillar
[1:33:23] of fire he has no right to call himself
[1:33:26] a messenger cuz all the theologians in
[1:33:27] the world couldn't explain it if you
[1:33:29] ever met him face to face that's what a
[1:33:31] man needs is to meet God meet the pillar
[1:33:35] of fire it's what gives you a right
[1:33:37] Pillar of Fire gives you a right to
[1:33:38] preach for the David it didn't matter
[1:33:40] who comes they can't take it from you
[1:33:42] they didn't give you the right the
[1:33:43] pillar of fire did it was that Pillar of
[1:33:45] Fire that gave you a right to praise God
[1:33:47] it was that same Pillar of Fire that
[1:33:49] when you come in the in the house of God
[1:33:50] and the spirit of the Lord's moving and
[1:33:51] you begin to worship God somebody look
[1:33:53] at why you being so loud why is your
[1:33:55] hands raised why why yall so rowdy but
[1:33:57] but I have a right it was given to me by
[1:33:58] the pillar of fire it's that one that's
[1:34:00] brooding over the church that's
[1:34:02] ministering to us I got a right to
[1:34:04] praise him I got a right to shout I've
[1:34:06] got a right to be in a Revival the
[1:34:08] pillar of fire has gave it to me he said
[1:34:11] what God done with it he led his
[1:34:12] children then and today he has separated
[1:34:15] us from all these old dead religions I'm
[1:34:17] speaking Across the Nation now all the
[1:34:19] dead Creeds and to what God has
[1:34:21] separated us and opened to us a new land
[1:34:23] a new message for this day what was it
[1:34:26] it was returning back to the the faith
[1:34:28] the original Faith Of God I thank God
[1:34:31] today that we have a land that we can
[1:34:33] worship God
