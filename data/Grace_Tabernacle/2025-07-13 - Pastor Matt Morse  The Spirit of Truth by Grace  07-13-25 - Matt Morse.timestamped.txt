[19:47] [Music]
[20:04] Their
[20:11] [Music]
[20:18] heads were low.
[20:22] [Music]
[20:26] As they walked along that long
[20:30] road,
[20:32] then a man appeared.
[20:36] And as he drew near,
[20:40] [Music]
[20:41] why are you so sad?
[20:44] Are things really that bad?
[20:48] [Music]
[20:49] They said, "Sir,
[20:53] have you not heard?
[20:57] You must be a stranger in this town.
[21:03] For the one who came
[21:07] in the father's name,
[21:10] [Music]
[21:12] he has been cut down. They laid his body
[21:16] in the ground.
[21:18] As they walked and talked, he began to
[21:21] explain about this Jesus and why he
[21:25] came. He opened the scriptures and began
[21:28] to teach. The preacher of preachers, he
[21:32] began to preach.
[21:35] In the wilderness, the children had
[21:37] nothing there to eat. But men up from
[21:40] heaven fell down at their feet when they
[21:43] were dry and thirsty. And a warming land
[21:46] living water came forth out of a rock in
[21:49] the sand. When the three Hebrew children
[21:52] were thrown in the flames, a fourth man
[21:54] appeared. They even called him by name.
[21:57] The man of the water, the man, they're
[22:00] all the same. And if you're still
[22:02] confused, I'll just say it real.
[22:06] It was me.
[22:09] Oh, it was me.
[22:14] I am the one who left back there on
[22:18] Calvary.
[22:20] It was me.
[22:23] [Music]
[22:36] Who do you think hung the stars in the
[22:38] sky? Who do you think made the day and
[22:42] the night? Who made the flowers? Who
[22:45] made the trees? Who made the sun and the
[22:48] moon and the seas? Who gives life to all
[22:52] who believe? Who do you think made the
[22:56] blind to see? And who made the very air
[22:59] that you breathe? who defeated death and
[23:02] won the victory.
[23:06] It was me.
[23:09] Oh, it was me.
[23:14] I am the one who died for you. Oh, on
[23:18] Calvary.
[23:21] It was me.
[23:23] [Music]
[23:26] [Applause]
[23:27] [Music]
[23:32] [Applause]
[23:36] Who do you think was the voice in the
[23:38] tree? Who do you think told the prophet
[23:41] to speak? Who created squirrels and made
[23:45] the storms to cease? And who drove his
[23:48] boys right down to their knees? Who do
[23:51] you think brought you here today? Who
[23:57] who left his throne to fellowship with
[24:00] you to make himself known to many of
[24:04] you?
[24:06] It was me.
[24:09] Oh, it was me.
[24:14] I am the one you left back there on
[24:18] Calvary.
[24:20] It was me.
[24:23] [Music]
[24:26] [Applause]
[24:42] [Music]
[24:49] I've been held by the Savior.
[24:56] I've filled fire from above.
[25:03] I've been down to the river.
[25:09] Well, I ain't the same a prodal return
[25:15] and all my hope is in Jesus.
[25:21] I thank God that yesterday is gone
[25:28] and all my sins are forgiven.

[25:54] but I've been freedom and forg.

[28:00] Cara brings her song. And all my hope is

[28:42] Oh, when I been washed by the blood
[29:17] [Music]
[29:44] and you knew it.
[29:47] Perhaps that's why you asked Abraham
[29:51] what's most important.
[29:56] Was it to see how far he'd go
[30:00] or to show him there was more to
[30:08] your glory.
[30:12] Even when you told him to lay his Isaac
[30:16] on the altar,
[30:19] you found out that he didn't love the
[30:23] promise more than you.
[30:28] And even though he believed
[30:33] that you'd provide around, he said, "Who
[30:37] will my
[30:39] as a man not to trust you?
[30:52] There is a broken world around us.
[30:56] quickly falling.
[31:00] Leo Dea is so loud we can't hear you
[31:05] calling.
[31:08] Is it Leona that's so loud?
[31:13] Or are we just too proud to receive your
[31:17] mercies
[31:19] or to bring you glory?
[31:24] Even when you tell us to lay our Isaac
[31:28] on the altar,
[31:31] will you find out that we don't love the
[31:35] promise more than you?
[31:40] Do we truly
[31:42] believe
[31:44] the provider?
[31:48] Who are we?
[31:50] Who are we not to trust?
[31:54] [Music]
[32:04] What is the Isaac in your life that you
[32:08] keep holding?
[32:11] Oh, the desires of this world will keep
[32:16] you drowning.
[32:20] If you could only see God's gifts are
[32:24] greater than your needs
[32:28] or desires.
[32:31] He is your provider.
[32:35] Even when he tells us to lay our eyes on
[32:40] the altar,
[32:43] will he find a bride who doesn't love
[32:46] the promise more than him?
[32:51] Lord, we truly
[32:54] believe
[32:56] that you'll provide around.
[33:00] We're your bride and we do completely
[33:05] trust you,
[33:08] Lord. I do. I do completely

[39:35] Oh Lord, I surrender my life.
[39:40] Oh, I give it all. All that sing that
[39:44] first verse
[39:46] [Music]
[39:51] and I know Lord
[39:54] your plan for me
[39:59] is
[40:00] right.
[40:04] And I need you
[40:07] to fulfill your purpose in my life.
[40:15] For I submit to you my king.
[40:22] Oh be my
[40:25] everything.
[40:27] Lord I'm coming to you
[40:30] again.
[40:33] Oh dear. All that you pray this morning,
[40:37] just lift your hands and surrender to
[40:39] me. Oh,

[41:16] [Music]
[41:23] [Applause]
[41:25] [Music]
[41:29] Let the worippers around.
[41:32] [Music]
[41:35] Let the sons of God sing.
[41:42] I'm surrendering my own.
[41:46] [Applause]
[41:48] I surrender to the king.
[41:52] Let the wor
[41:55] [Music]
[41:55] [Applause]
[42:00] see.
[42:04] Yes, I'm surrendering my own.
[42:11] I surrender to the king.
[42:16] Father, I hear it growing louder.
[42:19] The song of your redeemed as the bride
[42:23] of every nation is awaken and he's a
[42:28] part of that this morning. There comes
[42:31] an angle. Oh, here the praises. This is
[42:35] our song.
[42:37] We sing to our king. Let the wor.
[42:52] Yes, I'm surrendering my all.
[42:58] Oh my Lord, I surrender to the king.
[43:05] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[43:06] clap of praise this morning? How many
[43:09] say I surrender my all to the Lord Jesus
[43:12] Christ? Amen. Amen. We come to church as
[43:15] a body of believers to fellowship around
[43:18] the word of the Lord. How many
[43:20] appreciates the atmosphere in the
[43:22] building this morning? Amen. We just
[43:23] enjoy the presence of the Lord. And I
[43:26] believe that whenever the believers come
[43:28] together and and they begin to pray and
[43:32] sing songs of worship and live
[43:35] sanctified lives that it's a savor, a
[43:38] sweet smell and savor to the Lord. And I
[43:40] believe that it's something that he
[43:42] according to the scripture, he inhabits
[43:44] the praise of his people. So, I believe
[43:46] that God is here this morning to do
[43:49] abundantly more than we could ever ask
[43:51] or think. Amen. Do you believe that this
[43:52] morning? God is certainly moving amongst
[43:55] his children. And I know we could look
[43:58] at all the things that are going on in
[44:00] the world and we can be so uh uh
[44:02] depressed and we feel so bad about
[44:05] everything. But uh when you look at the
[44:07] promises of God, it doesn't do nothing
[44:09] but put a smile on your face to think of
[44:11] all that God is doing for us right now.
[44:14] Amen. He's not just a God of history,
[44:16] but he's a God of today. Amen. You
[44:18] believe that this morning? Amen.
[44:20] Somebody turn around to somebody and
[44:21] say, "He's a God of today." Amen. We
[44:24] sure love the Lord this morning. And
[44:27] just want to give a report from Brother
[44:29] Andrew. Uh he's should be flying home in
[44:32] the in a little while and had finished
[44:36] up their meetings there in the Czech
[44:37] Republic. And I know many of you had
[44:40] helped them to be able to go there. He
[44:42] said there was uh 24 young people that
[44:44] gave their heart to the Lord and that
[44:46] are being baptized uh following the
[44:48] meetings. So, we just sure appreciate
[44:50] the hand of God in those meetings. And
[44:53] just remember to continue to to pray for
[44:55] him as he gets ready to make his journey
[44:57] home. And maybe if you just have a need
[44:59] on your heart this morning, just welcome
[45:02] all of our visitors here. Just trust
[45:04] that the Lord would do something to help
[45:06] you. And may you find the grace of God.
[45:09] Amen. So, won't we just lift our hands?
[45:11] If you have a need on your heart, just
[45:14] something that was you'd like the Lord
[45:15] to do, won't we just ask him to come and
[45:18] and we just call everybody just pray in
[45:20] your own way. Gracious heavenly father,
[45:23] Lord, we just thank you, Lord, for an
[45:25] opportunity to come and just together in
[45:28] the house of God this morning. And Lord,
[45:30] we thank you, Lord, for all that you do
[45:32] for us. Lord, we thank you for this
[45:33] wonderful atmosphere of worship. And
[45:36] Lord, we recognize your presence, Lord.
[45:39] God, we are so humbled to be able to
[45:42] stand in the presence of an eternal God.
[45:44] And Lord, it causes us to look at oursel
[45:47] and realize our weaknesses and our
[45:49] inabilities. And Lord, knowing that here
[45:53] is a body of people, Lord, and many
[45:55] around the country, Lord, that would be
[45:58] watching the services, Lord, and God,
[46:00] it's your children, Lord, knowing that
[46:03] you know all that we have need of.
[46:05] Lord, we just ask you, Lord, that by
[46:08] your grace that you would come this
[46:10] morning, Lord, you would speak to your
[46:12] children. Lord, you would feed every
[46:14] soul, Lord, that we would leave this
[46:16] place knowing that we've been in your
[46:17] presence. Lord, we thank you for all you
[46:20] do, and we give you the glory for it. We
[46:21] ask you to anoint this word and bring it
[46:23] to life, Lord. You spoke this to my
[46:26] heart, Lord, and I just ask you to allow
[46:28] me to surrender this morning that you
[46:30] could speak what you would have spoken,
[46:32] Lord. We just thank you for it in the
[46:33] name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[46:37] Amen. God bless you this morning. Want
[46:39] to invite you to the scripture and uh to
[46:42] John the 16th chapter and we'll read out
[46:45] of the 13th verse and then we'll also go
[46:48] to John 14 and 16. So John 16th chapter
[46:51] and the 13th verse and give you just a a
[46:54] moment to find that.
[46:56] Amen. and just certainly want to make
[46:58] everybody welcome and our friends travel
[47:01] a long way home on vacation and come to
[47:04] visit this morning. So, God bless you.
[47:05] How many enjoyed those specials?
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just a tremendous hearing God's
[47:11] children and and the gifts of God being
[47:14] used. Amen. I I just love the atmosphere
[47:17] that is created by worship. Amen. So,
[47:20] let's just go to the word. How many
[47:22] loves the word of God? Amen.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we come to the house of
[47:25] God. Amen. to fellowship around the
[47:27] word. Amen. So we want to read John 16
[47:30] and13. Jesus how said, "How be it when
[47:33] he the spirit of truth is come, he will
[47:35] guide you into all truth, for he shall
[47:37] not speak of himself, but whatsoever he
[47:40] shall hear, that shall he speak, and he
[47:43] will show you things to come." I'd also
[47:46] like to read out of John 14 in the 16th
[47:49] verse down to the 20th verse. And Jesus
[47:53] tells us who this spirit of truth is. So
[47:55] he says when he come he will he will
[47:58] lead you and and and guide you uh but in
[48:01] in all truth but then he tells us who it
[48:04] is. He says the father he shall give you
[48:06] another comforter that he may abide with
[48:08] you forever even the spirit of truth
[48:11] whom the world cannot receive because it
[48:13] seeth him not neither knoweth him but
[48:16] you know him for he dwelleth with you
[48:18] and shall be in you. So Jesus makes a
[48:21] great connection here of speaking of him
[48:23] coming spiritually. Of course we realize
[48:25] as the Holy Ghost, but he would say it
[48:28] is he that dwelleth with you and he that
[48:31] shall be in you. So it kind of takes
[48:33] away there being two and three gods out
[48:35] there, don't it? Says so I will not
[48:37] leave you comfortless, but I will come
[48:39] to you. He just goes ahead and makes it
[48:40] plain. He said, "In a little while the
[48:42] world will see me no more, but you will
[48:44] see me because I live you shall live
[48:47] also. And at that day you shall know
[48:49] that I am in my father and you are in me
[48:53] and I am in you. And we'll just ask the
[48:55] Lord to add his blessing to the reading
[48:57] of the word this morning. And I would
[48:59] like to speak on this subject on the
[49:01] spirit of truth by grace. The spirit of
[49:04] truth uh by grace. I know the Bible
[49:07] gives us uh the many promises to the
[49:10] church and you know we've been speaking
[49:12] on those and uh uh what great precious
[49:14] promises that have been given us to us
[49:16] by the by the Lord and you know I got to
[49:18] thinking on that this week that there's
[49:20] many uh great things that God has
[49:22] promised but then uh it just seems like
[49:25] that that in this life that there's many
[49:27] great things that stand before us to
[49:29] keep us from receiving the promises of
[49:31] God. How many can testify that many
[49:33] times that uh how said how many can
[49:35] testify that I I know I'm not the only
[49:37] one that has uh uh things that stand
[49:39] before you that keep you from getting to
[49:41] where God wants you to be. But there's
[49:43] many trials that we face and many uh
[49:45] pressures and many burdens that are on
[49:47] the church. That's why it's so heavy and
[49:50] uh to come to the house of God and and
[49:52] just to be able to be free and worship
[49:54] and and to get into the service. It's
[49:56] because we're heavy by the world and all
[49:57] the things of this life. But uh you know
[49:59] what we got to do this morning? and we
[50:01] get to come in the house of God and we
[50:02] can let all that alone just for a few
[50:04] minutes and allow the spirit of the Lord
[50:06] to come and minister to our hearts and
[50:08] so so we realize there are many great
[50:10] trials and many pressures and you know I
[50:13] was thinking of the promises of God and
[50:14] you know I thought that you know there's
[50:16] many things in our life that God did not
[50:18] promise us how many knows that there was
[50:20] many promises that were not in the Bible
[50:22] he never promised us that we would have
[50:24] an easy walk he never promised us that
[50:26] we wouldn't have trials he never uh
[50:28] promised that there would be no
[50:29] temptation he never promise promised us
[50:31] there would be no pressures in this
[50:33] life. Uh God never promised us that we
[50:35] wouldn't have hardship. There's not
[50:36] those are not things that God has
[50:38] promised to the church. But uh no doubt
[50:40] we experienced all of those all of those
[50:43] things. But uh but but what he did
[50:45] promise is that he would send a spirit
[50:47] into the church that would be a
[50:49] comforter to us that would lead us uh
[50:51] that would guide us that would be a a
[50:53] guide to the church. He would help you
[50:55] overcome every trial. He would he would
[50:57] help you get past the obstacles. He
[50:59] would help you cross all the barriers.
[51:01] And I know sometimes we try by our own
[51:03] might and our own strength to overcome
[51:05] the things that we are going through in
[51:08] this life. But but the Bible tells us
[51:09] that that's not the way to overcome it
[51:11] at all. Matter of fact, Zachchariah
[51:13] talked about it. He said, "It's not by
[51:15] might nor by spirit or or by power, but
[51:18] by my spirit, sayeth the Lord." He said,
[51:20] "Who art thou, oh great mountain, before
[51:22] Zerubabel, for thou shalt become a
[51:24] plain?" Somebody say mountain, and you
[51:27] shall become a plain. So it didn't
[51:28] matter what mountain that it was. I I
[51:30] love how Zachariah asked because he
[51:32] asked the mountain to identify itself. I
[51:34] don't know what mountains that you face
[51:35] and I don't know what trials and all the
[51:38] uh the pressures that we face. But
[51:40] Zachchariah said, "Who art thou, oh
[51:41] great mountain?" In other words, uh uh
[51:43] who are you to stand before the Lord,
[51:46] but but by the spirit of God that every
[51:48] mountain would be made a plain. How many
[51:50] believe that this morning? It don't
[51:51] matter what we face. It don't matter
[51:53] what trials we go through. prove it. No
[51:55] matter what hardships that we go through
[51:57] in this life, but Zachchariah said, "Who
[51:59] art thou, oh great mountain before
[52:01] Zerubbabel, you shall become a plain and
[52:03] then and when this spirit shall come to
[52:05] the earth, he'll come by a message be
[52:08] called grace." Grace remember he said,
[52:09] "I'll call grace under." You said,
[52:11] "Well, how would it be made a plain?"
[52:13] How will the how will I overcome in this
[52:15] hour? But we'll over overcome, Brother
[52:17] Wesley, by one thing, and that's by the
[52:19] word of God that would come by a message
[52:22] of the grace of God. Can I just say it
[52:24] to this morning that for if God is going
[52:26] to come and give you a word in the hour
[52:29] that you need a word from the Lord, it
[52:31] ain't nothing more than the grace of
[52:33] God. If God gives you a word and it's in
[52:35] the hour that you need a word from the
[52:37] Lord by God coming and speaking to you,
[52:39] it don't matter if it's a word of
[52:41] correction. It don't matter if it seems
[52:43] like you're getting a little bit of a
[52:44] whooping sometimes. It don't matter if
[52:46] it's uplifting. If it's a word from the
[52:48] Lord sent to you in the hour that you
[52:50] need it. It's the grace of God that sent
[52:52] the word of God unto you. How many
[52:54] believe that? And that's what we need in
[52:56] this hour. A lot of times a person, you
[52:58] know, they'll start their walk with God
[53:00] and they'll get to a certain place and
[53:01] they can't ever go any further. They'll
[53:03] they'll come to a wall and you know, I
[53:05] know what Satan does whenever we get to
[53:07] this place is that Satan looks at our
[53:09] life and he says, "Well, you never got
[53:11] anything from God." And you know, you
[53:13] know, you may started out a walk with
[53:15] God, but Satan will come by, he'll say,
[53:17] "Well, you know, the uh the very
[53:18] experiences that you had with God, it
[53:20] was just emotional workups." And maybe
[53:22] you just got caught up in all the things
[53:24] that was going on in a revival. Maybe
[53:26] you went to a meeting and you you came
[53:28] to an altar and you had a great uh move
[53:30] of God in your life. And you know, but
[53:32] the devil will come by and well, it
[53:33] wasn't God at all. And you know, if that
[53:35] was the spirit of God after all, then
[53:37] why would you be facing all these
[53:38] trials? And if that was if that was God
[53:40] that dealt with you, then why would you
[53:42] have all this pressure? And why would
[53:44] you have these temptations? And why do
[53:46] you still struggle? And why do you have
[53:48] failure in your life? After all, if you
[53:50] if you got a hold of God and you really
[53:52] met God, that great creator, the eternal
[53:54] God, then why would you go through the
[53:56] pressures of this life? Maybe it wasn't
[53:58] God at all.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; You know, and but I want to say that
[54:02] this morning that just because that you
[54:04] have failures does not mean that your
[54:06] experience with God was not a real
[54:07] experience. Just because you went
[54:10] through hardships, it don't mean that
[54:11] you really didn't meet God a few years
[54:14] ago or a few months ago. Friends, I've
[54:16] got news for you. The the things that we
[54:17] face in this life or no or no guide to
[54:20] tell you whether or whether or not that
[54:22] you ever had an experience with God.
[54:24] Many times people come to an altar and
[54:26] they give their heart to God and and
[54:27] they and they they they have a real they
[54:29] have a real pouring out and they make a
[54:31] decision to serve God and they'll leave
[54:33] that altar that that very place that
[54:35] they met God and they'll go right back
[54:37] into the world. I don't know about
[54:38] y'all, but I've done it many times in my
[54:40] life. I I I know you've seen this many
[54:42] times, but but they'll go right back
[54:44] into the world. They'll come to an
[54:45] altar. They'll repent. And how many's
[54:47] ever experienced it? You come and and
[54:49] give your heart to God. You made a sure
[54:51] dedication. This time, I'm going to
[54:52] serve God. And and then it ain't it
[54:54] ain't very long. You're right back into
[54:55] the same mess you came out of. Right in
[54:57] the same addictions, the same problems,
[54:59] the same trials, the same pressures that
[55:02] you that you had before. And and then
[55:04] you'll come back and the devil begins to
[55:06] speak to your mind and you say, you
[55:07] know, I thought that I was forgiven and
[55:09] I I thought I was justified and I
[55:11] thought I'd came to a place with God and
[55:13] I I was baptized and you know, I thought
[55:15] everything was going to be okay after
[55:17] that and I thought the devil had let me.
[55:19] But friends, I've got news for you this
[55:21] morning. You were forgiven and you were
[55:24] justified and your sins were put in the
[55:26] sea of forgetfulness. But let me tell
[55:28] you what Jesus said about it. He said,
[55:30] "When an unclean spirit is gone out of a
[55:32] man, he walketh through dry places and
[55:34] he seeks rest and he finds none." And
[55:36] then that spirit will say, "Well, I will
[55:39] return unto my house." Ain't that
[55:41] something that the devil calls your body
[55:43] his house. He said, "So when a spirit
[55:45] leaves a man, comes to an altar, you
[55:47] give your heart to God. And when a
[55:49] spirit leaves, he said he comes back and
[55:51] he says, I will return to my," In other
[55:53] words, the devil makes a decision to go
[55:55] inhabit this place again. He said, "So
[55:57] from whence he came out and when he
[55:58] comes, he finds it's empty, swept, and
[56:00] garnished. He go then he goes and he
[56:02] takes with himself seven other spirits
[56:05] that are more wicked than himself and
[56:07] they enter in and dwell there and the
[56:10] last state of that man is worse than it
[56:13] was before." Isn't that a scary place to
[56:15] be to realize that you can come to a
[56:17] place and go so far with God? And
[56:19] brother Mark, you can come to a place of
[56:21] repentance. Isn't it something to think
[56:22] of this that you can come to a place of
[56:24] repentance and leave off worse than it
[56:26] was than the time that you came and
[56:28] repented? For the Bible says the last
[56:29] state of the man is worse than he was
[56:31] when he came. That's one of the brother
[56:32] would say. He said when the devil moves
[56:34] out, what it does is it gives God an
[56:37] opportunity to move in. He said so when
[56:39] he goes out, you have to let the Holy
[56:41] Spirit come in. You can't just leave it
[56:44] there. For if you repent of your sins
[56:46] and go on, then you're going to be worse
[56:48] off than ever. But get to the place that
[56:50] where Satan once lived and occupied.
[56:52] Isn't that a Isn't that a challenging
[56:54] thought that that if you just repent and
[56:56] go on that you're going to be worse off
[56:58] than you ever was. That takes away some
[57:00] people's doctrine. No, that's what Jesus
[57:01] was saying. If you don't get it
[57:03] inhabited with another spirit, then here
[57:05] comes that same spirit that left you
[57:07] with seven others and it'll make it
[57:09] worse off. But he said, "But get to a
[57:11] place where Satan once lived. Get it
[57:12] occupied. get it filled with the Holy
[57:15] Spirit of God and then you'll have the
[57:17] strength of God's word in you
[57:19] manifested. It'll cast out devils. You
[57:21] know, I think about that, brother
[57:22] Wesley. It makes me think of Abraham in
[57:24] the Old Testament when he when the Lord
[57:27] had called him and he told him, Abraham,
[57:29] get thee out of thy kindred and go into
[57:31] the place that I have have called you
[57:33] into a land that I will show you. You
[57:35] know, I thought it was always something
[57:37] that Abraham, that's why the Bible says
[57:39] his walk was a walk of faith is because
[57:41] Abraham did not know where this land was
[57:44] that God was leading him to. But God
[57:46] said, "Go into this land that I will
[57:48] show you." And Abraham, he begins on
[57:51] this walk and he starts walking by faith
[57:53] and he he's going into this place and
[57:55] he's listening to the promises that God
[57:58] had spoke to him. I will make thee a
[58:00] great nation and thy seed shall number
[58:02] the stars of the heaven and the sands of
[58:04] the sea. and I've called you away from
[58:06] this place and away from your family and
[58:09] out of this condition and I'm going to
[58:11] make you a great nation. He began to
[58:13] think of the the promises that God had
[58:15] given unto him and and as he starts on
[58:18] this journey, you know, he's wandering
[58:20] in the direction that God had sent him
[58:22] to. And in other words, it was just a
[58:24] general instruction that he was
[58:26] following. I I think it's just like us
[58:27] many times that we we get a conviction
[58:30] to come to the house of God or maybe
[58:31] somebody invited you to go to church and
[58:33] you know and said you know we're having
[58:35] a meeting or something you ought you
[58:36] ought to come and go to church with me
[58:38] and and then just like Abraham done we
[58:40] kind of wander in that direction and you
[58:41] know here we go here we go off well I
[58:44] you know I I don't know what it is but
[58:45] there's a conviction or something that's
[58:46] leading me to go in this direction and
[58:48] we start just wandering along in that
[58:50] direction just like Abraham was but
[58:53] while he was wandering along all of a
[58:54] sudden he comes to a certain place in
[58:57] his walk that God stops him in his
[58:59] tracks and he begins to speak to him
[59:01] again and he says to Abraham, he said,
[59:03] "Unto thy seed will I give this land."
[59:06] So, no longer was it a a land somewhere
[59:10] that I'm going to show you. No longer
[59:11] was it an unknown, but now it became a
[59:14] known to Abraham where God said, "This
[59:16] is the land that I will give you." And
[59:18] notice what Abraham done is when he
[59:20] identified that this was the possession
[59:22] that God had promised to him. The Bible
[59:24] said that Abraham built an altar in that
[59:27] land before God and he fell down and he
[59:30] be to worship the Lord. I thought, isn't
[59:32] it something to hear that as God
[59:34] appeared to him, he built an altar and
[59:36] he begin to worship and the Bible said
[59:38] and he removed from from unto a mountain
[59:40] east of Bethl and he put his tent there
[59:42] having Bethl on the west and high on the
[59:44] east and he built an altar under the
[59:46] Lord and he called upon the name of the
[59:49] Lord. Let me tell you what he did,
[59:50] brother Wesley, as he be to worship God.
[59:53] You know why? because he seen what his
[59:55] promise was and he begin to worship God.
[59:57] There's something in a man that causes
[59:58] him to build an altar. It it ain't out
[1:00:00] of greed. It ain't out of selfishness.
[1:00:02] The the what would cause him to stop and
[1:00:04] build an altar, brother Mark, and and
[1:00:06] take his hands and go to work and build
[1:00:08] something for the Lord. It was because
[1:00:10] something God was moving in his life and
[1:00:12] the promise had been identified. And you
[1:00:14] know what happened? As he began to
[1:00:15] worship the Lord and the spirit of the
[1:00:17] Lord came by and he began to minister to
[1:00:19] Abraham. He talked to Abraham and
[1:00:22] Abraham talked with God and he had a
[1:00:24] place of fellowship between him and God.
[1:00:26] It was a great time in Abraham's life.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; You know, finally he got to the place
[1:00:31] that that God had promised and finally
[1:00:33] he had found the this place that God had
[1:00:36] led him to and he finally could stand up
[1:00:38] and say, "This is it. This is where
[1:00:39] where God had brought me and my this is
[1:00:41] where I ought to establish my life and
[1:00:43] I'm going to build an altar before God
[1:00:45] right here. From now on, from this day
[1:00:47] forward, I must serve the Lord right in
[1:00:49] this place that God has sent me to in
[1:00:51] this land of promise.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; But it didn't take a few days.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says a famine came in to
[1:00:58] the land where Abraham was, in other
[1:01:01] words, that things as he got up from
[1:01:02] this altar, brother Mark, things
[1:01:05] hardships begin to come upon his life.
[1:01:07] His he couldn't take care of his family
[1:01:09] and it just felt like it felt like a
[1:01:11] famine. There wasn't no way uh uh to get
[1:01:13] over it. And so the Bible says, "And so
[1:01:16] Abraham continued on his journey to the
[1:01:18] south."
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; I mean, I preached a message on this one
[1:01:21] time on on on on heading south and how
[1:01:24] that that many times when a person comes
[1:01:26] to an altar that when they leave the
[1:01:27] altar, you always wonder what direction
[1:01:29] are they going to go. Are they going to
[1:01:30] go on and serve the Lord? Are they going
[1:01:32] to go back out into the world? The Bible
[1:01:34] says he went down south and he came to
[1:01:36] the land of Egypt. But remember said
[1:01:37] what a thing it was. He was supposed to
[1:01:39] stay in that land, but he went down into
[1:01:41] Egypt. He went to souljourn to get out
[1:01:43] of the famine only because things was a
[1:01:46] little hard up in his country. I
[1:01:47] thought, isn't that the way it is? Every
[1:01:49] person that ever comes and dedicates
[1:01:51] their life to God and from this day
[1:01:53] forward, I will serve the Lord. As for
[1:01:55] me in my house, I'm going to serve the
[1:01:57] Lord, but just let a little hardship
[1:01:59] come by and see what happens. Let a
[1:02:00] little pressure from the job or pressure
[1:02:02] from the spouse or pressure from a
[1:02:04] family member or pressure from somebody
[1:02:06] or pressure from the devil comes on her
[1:02:08] life. This is what happened to Abraham.
[1:02:10] As things got a little hard, he said
[1:02:12] when it got a little hard, notice what
[1:02:14] happened. He went down into Egypt. And
[1:02:16] then when he got to Egypt, Abraham
[1:02:18] turned into the biggest liar in Egypt.
[1:02:19] He he told him that my wife is not my
[1:02:21] wife at all. She's my sister. I He's
[1:02:23] trying to keep himself out of trouble.
[1:02:25] He got into all kinds of mess down
[1:02:27] there. And then and then the Lord had to
[1:02:29] come by and plague Pharaoh because
[1:02:31] Abraham had told him this. And he took
[1:02:34] Sarah into the house of Pharaoh. and and
[1:02:36] he had purpose in his heart to take her
[1:02:38] as his own wife. And the Lord came to
[1:02:39] Pharaoh and said, "Don't touch her.
[1:02:41] She's the wife of my my son Abraham."
[1:02:43] And and God had to come and intervene in
[1:02:45] his life. And then then they kicked him
[1:02:47] out of Egypt. He had went through all of
[1:02:49] this mess because he wouldn't stay in
[1:02:51] the land that God had given him as a
[1:02:53] promise. I thought, "M Abraham, this
[1:02:55] great father of faith, the man of faith,
[1:02:57] I'm I may as well preach." He He was the
[1:02:59] great father of faith. But even Abraham
[1:03:01] had time to doubt God whenever whenever
[1:03:03] things got a little hard that it was
[1:03:05] easier to go to the land of Egypt and
[1:03:07] find some kind of a something in Egypt
[1:03:10] to sustain him and be able to satisfy
[1:03:12] his thirst and his hunger, brother Mark,
[1:03:14] because he couldn't wait and rely upon
[1:03:16] God in the land that God had sent him
[1:03:18] to. But even Abraham, just like us, he
[1:03:20] had hardship in his life. Brother said
[1:03:22] he done exactly what God told him not to
[1:03:24] do. But notice there's something about
[1:03:26] it. Even though he had done what God
[1:03:28] told him not to do, he said, "But yet
[1:03:31] the grace of God appeared unto him."
[1:03:34] Ain't that powerful? That the grace of
[1:03:36] God went into Pharaoh's house. It was
[1:03:38] the grace of God that brought dreams to
[1:03:40] Pharaoh and said, "Don't touch that
[1:03:42] woman." It was the grace of God that
[1:03:44] caused him to to give him cattle and
[1:03:46] land and and and everything to leave out
[1:03:48] of this place. It was the grace of God
[1:03:50] that appeared to him. He said, "And
[1:03:52] anybody that's willing to repent, the
[1:03:54] grace of God still goes for you, for the
[1:03:57] grace of God is searching you out." How
[1:03:59] many believe that this morning? If you
[1:04:01] find a person, it don't matter how far
[1:04:03] you've gone. I don't care how far away
[1:04:05] from God that you've made it or how far
[1:04:07] that you've ran. If you're willing to
[1:04:09] repent, the grace of God, it still goes
[1:04:11] for you. He said it's searching for you.
[1:04:13] It's been moving about your life. It the
[1:04:15] grace of God went down into the land of
[1:04:18] Egypt and it found the house of Pharaoh.
[1:04:20] Friends, let me tell you, if the grace
[1:04:22] of God can find the mind of Pharaoh
[1:04:24] sleeping in his bed and tell him to turn
[1:04:26] Abraham's wife loose, then what do you
[1:04:28] think the grace of God can do to your
[1:04:30] life? It don't matter what holds you. It
[1:04:32] don't matter where you found yourself or
[1:04:34] what bondage that you found yourself in,
[1:04:36] but the grace of God is good enough to
[1:04:38] bring you out.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; See, that's what it's the grace of God.
[1:04:42] It's searching for you. It don't matter
[1:04:44] if you're a backslider this morning. The
[1:04:45] grace of God is still looking for you.
[1:04:47] You may as well say, "Amen."
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "If you'll just repent,
[1:04:51] God's grace is sufficient."
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; He took Abraham, good old Abraham, and
[1:04:55] he brought him back. Remember Abraham,
[1:04:57] he wasn't saved by his works. He was
[1:04:59] saved by grace. But it was God that went
[1:05:02] to Egypt and he brought Abraham back.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; You see, many times, many of us, we have
[1:05:06] great experiences with God and great
[1:05:09] moves of God in our life, and before
[1:05:10] long, we think that's all it took. My we
[1:05:12] had a great revival and everybody was
[1:05:14] shouting, came to an altar, and my
[1:05:16] everything was good. I even went down to
[1:05:18] the river and received the baptism. But
[1:05:20] the prophet said, "But what is it that
[1:05:22] caused, think of this, this this great
[1:05:23] experience?" But then they find theirel
[1:05:25] right back into the world. Well, what
[1:05:27] causes it for a man to come to this
[1:05:29] place and find himself right back where
[1:05:31] he started.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "What is what caused this this
[1:05:34] misunderstanding?" The answer is
[1:05:36] experience.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; See, we have gone by experience and not
[1:05:40] the word.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; But I think it's time that we get away
[1:05:42] with experience as our measuring line.
[1:05:44] For there is only one plum line. And
[1:05:46] it's only one rod and that is the word
[1:05:49] of God. He said, "Now watch carefully
[1:05:50] and get this. A prophet takes two
[1:05:52] scriptures and ties them together. One
[1:05:54] was Acts 2:38 where Peter said,"Repent
[1:05:57] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:05:59] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[1:06:01] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:06:02] Ghost." How many knows that scripture?
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; But then he also takes Acts 19 and2
[1:06:06] whenever Peter or or Paul asked the
[1:06:09] disciples, he said, "Have you received
[1:06:11] the Holy Ghost since you believe?" So in
[1:06:14] one place Peter said, "Repent and be
[1:06:15] baptized. You shall receive the gift of
[1:06:17] the Holy Ghost." Paul asked, "Have you
[1:06:19] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:06:21] believe?" So see this is the whole
[1:06:23] problem right here is that people they
[1:06:25] they repent of their sins. They get
[1:06:27] baptized in water, but they don't go on
[1:06:30] and receive the Holy Ghost. Said, see,
[1:06:32] you have to believe under the receiving
[1:06:35] of the spirit. Let me let me just lay it
[1:06:36] out to you. This is the problem with
[1:06:38] most people. A matter of fact, almost
[1:06:40] every person that's ever tried to start
[1:06:42] a walk with God and they wind up
[1:06:44] backsliding or or Brother Mark, they
[1:06:46] wind up going back in the world, this is
[1:06:47] the very problem is they only come so
[1:06:50] far to a place that there's not
[1:06:52] something in their life that could hold
[1:06:53] them in that which they had faith. He
[1:06:56] said, see, so they get baptized in
[1:06:57] water, but they don't go on and receive
[1:06:59] the Holy Ghost. But you have to believe
[1:07:01] under the receiving of the spirit. See,
[1:07:03] because believing on Jesus is the step
[1:07:05] in the right direction, which is toward
[1:07:08] the Holy Ghost. But believing on Jesus,
[1:07:10] that's why Paul asked this question.
[1:07:12] Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:07:14] you believe? This was believers. These
[1:07:16] were those that had been baptized. They
[1:07:18] had been baptized in water. They
[1:07:20] pronounced themselves as believers. But
[1:07:22] Paul challenged them. He said, "But have
[1:07:23] you yet received the Holy Ghost?" They
[1:07:25] said, "We didn't know that there that
[1:07:26] there was a such a thing as the Holy
[1:07:28] Ghost." He said, "See, so believing on
[1:07:30] Jesus is a step in the right direction,
[1:07:32] which is toward the Holy Ghost." But the
[1:07:34] people just stop there. They go as far
[1:07:36] as the water, then they stop. I don't I
[1:07:38] don't care where you put the stop at,
[1:07:39] but this is where this is where the
[1:07:41] trouble is is they go as far as the
[1:07:42] water and they stop. They go as far as
[1:07:45] believing and then they stop. They
[1:07:46] believe so much, then they stop. They
[1:07:48] they they they they go as far as coming
[1:07:50] to an altar, then they stop. They go as
[1:07:52] far as making a a mental commitment or
[1:07:55] or dedicating their life to God or maybe
[1:07:57] oh my but but but then they stop they
[1:08:00] just don't go on so far enough. See see
[1:08:03] but the Bible doesn't say that you
[1:08:05] receive when you believe but the Bible
[1:08:07] said have you received since you
[1:08:09] believed
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; in other words can I just say that what
[1:08:11] in literal sense it means did you having
[1:08:13] previously believed received the Holy
[1:08:15] Ghost?
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Having already believed have you
[1:08:17] received the Holy Ghost? See, so people
[1:08:20] believe, but then they stop because they
[1:08:22] don't believe on into the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:24] This is an important teaching to the
[1:08:25] church.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; This is an answer. This is a this is
[1:08:28] something that'll help every young
[1:08:29] person that ever tries to make a
[1:08:30] commitment to serve God that you don't
[1:08:32] have to go back out into the world and
[1:08:34] be used up by the devil for 20 years of
[1:08:36] your life before that you could ever
[1:08:38] come on and serve God. But you can have
[1:08:40] the greatest testimony, a greater
[1:08:41] testimony than any alcoholic or any drug
[1:08:44] addict or anybody that's ever been
[1:08:46] addicted that came to the Lord. You can
[1:08:47] have a greater testimony than they ever
[1:08:49] have. You can say, "I receive the Holy
[1:08:51] Ghost as a young man and a young woman.
[1:08:53] And God has kept me from alcohol. He's
[1:08:55] kept me from drugs. He's kept me from
[1:08:58] prostitution." You can take a hold of
[1:09:00] the Holy Ghost this morning. And it's a
[1:09:02] keeper.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; It's an important teaching to the
[1:09:05] church. Said, "You don't have to receive
[1:09:07] or you don't receive the Holy Ghost when
[1:09:08] you believe unto him having repented,
[1:09:11] but you have to go on and receive the
[1:09:12] Holy Ghost." You see, that's what's
[1:09:14] wrong with the fundamentalists. They
[1:09:16] have no power for they stop short of
[1:09:19] that Pentecostal experience.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; They stopped short of this whole. You
[1:09:22] said, "Well, what do you do?" Can I just
[1:09:23] tell you what Abraham done? The Bible
[1:09:25] said, "And then Abraham, he went on his
[1:09:28] journeys from the south even to Bethl
[1:09:31] unto the place where his tent had been
[1:09:33] at the beginning."
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; When he found himself in all of this
[1:09:37] mess after he had left the land that God
[1:09:39] had said, "This is your possession." But
[1:09:41] then he gets to this place. God, his
[1:09:43] grace comes by. He turns him back home.
[1:09:45] He says, "And he went back to the place
[1:09:47] where his tent had been at the
[1:09:48] beginning, right between Bethl and High.
[1:09:51] Right back to the very same place that
[1:09:53] he had met God before, the very same
[1:09:55] place that he had laid down on an altar
[1:09:57] and the and the place that he had had
[1:09:58] made a commitment to serve God. He had
[1:10:00] to go right back to where he was before
[1:10:03] in order to meet God there again."
[1:10:04] Friends, let me tell you something.
[1:10:06] That's where many need to go today.
[1:10:07] That's where many backsliding believers,
[1:10:09] I may as well just preach. Y'all can get
[1:10:12] after me later, but that's where many
[1:10:13] backsliding people need to find theirel
[1:10:15] this morning is back to the place that
[1:10:17] they had a revival in their heart and
[1:10:19] back to the place that there was joy in
[1:10:21] their salvation and back to the place
[1:10:23] that they had a real experience and had
[1:10:25] communion with God. He went back to
[1:10:27] where he met God, back to the land of
[1:10:29] promise to where to where God had spoke
[1:10:31] to him. And then something you realize
[1:10:33] that something had happened in his life,
[1:10:34] brother Mark. He had gone as far as he
[1:10:37] could go and he realized that I got to
[1:10:39] go back. And the Bible said, "And he
[1:10:40] went on his journeys from the south."
[1:10:43] Isn't that powerful? He went as far
[1:10:44] south as he was willing to go. And then
[1:10:46] something had to turn him around. The
[1:10:48] grace of God said, "This is as far south
[1:10:50] you can go." And he turned around and he
[1:10:52] went on his journey from the south. and
[1:10:54] turned his step in the right direction.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; I think it's time that we realize this
[1:10:58] morning that we've been heading in the
[1:10:59] wrong direction long enough. I wonder if
[1:11:01] there's somebody in your heart this
[1:11:02] morning say, "Brother Matt, I know
[1:11:04] you're talking to me, but I've been
[1:11:05] heading the wrong direction long
[1:11:07] enough." And I think it's time to turn
[1:11:08] my feet toward the toward the north and
[1:11:11] turn from the south and head back in the
[1:11:13] direction that God has called me to.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; I think it's time we turn our feet.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Ram preached a message
[1:11:20] one time called Turning Northward. And
[1:11:22] in this message, if you haven't ever
[1:11:24] heard it, he takes the story of Israel
[1:11:26] in the book of Deuteronomy and he shows
[1:11:28] how that they came through this great
[1:11:29] revival. Remember they they had came
[1:11:31] across the Red Sea and they were heading
[1:11:33] into the promised land and they and he
[1:11:35] said they could have went right into
[1:11:37] that land, but something kept them from
[1:11:39] moving forward.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; They could have walked right into that
[1:11:41] land. He said they were thinking they
[1:11:43] were almost there. They were having a
[1:11:44] great jubilee, shouting and praising
[1:11:46] God, seeing what God had done for them.
[1:11:48] And he said it had been hard to make
[1:11:50] them believe at that point that they
[1:11:51] were 40 years away from that promise.
[1:11:53] They were having a revival. God just
[1:11:55] brought them out of Egypt. They had seen
[1:11:56] great miracles take place. You realize
[1:11:58] he said, "See, they they were a long way
[1:12:00] from the full promise that he had
[1:12:02] promised them." But you realize, brother
[1:12:04] Mark, they were in a revival that was
[1:12:06] caused by the grace of God. It was a Can
[1:12:08] I just call it like this this morning?
[1:12:10] It was a grace revival. It was the grace
[1:12:12] of God that had brought them out of
[1:12:13] Egypt. It was their children had been
[1:12:15] saved by grace. The grandchildren were
[1:12:17] saved by grace. The mamas were saved by
[1:12:19] grace. The daddies, the grace of God had
[1:12:22] came in and started this grace revival
[1:12:24] in the land of Egypt amongst the
[1:12:26] children of Israel. And it had brought
[1:12:28] them out of this place across the Red
[1:12:30] Sea. And all their all the their past
[1:12:32] had been buried in the sea. And my were
[1:12:33] they not having a great time with God.
[1:12:35] They were dancing and having a jubilee
[1:12:37] and they had tambourine up and down the
[1:12:39] banks of the river. Said, "See, because
[1:12:41] grace had provided them a great thing.
[1:12:43] It was grace that had brought that
[1:12:45] provided a Passover lamb. It pro it was
[1:12:47] grace that provided a prophet. It was
[1:12:49] grace that provided the angel or the
[1:12:51] pillar of fire. It was a Passover that
[1:12:53] lamb that was for their sin. It was a
[1:12:55] prophet as a instructor. It was a pillar
[1:12:57] of fire that would be their guide. But
[1:12:59] grace had provided everything for them.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; All that they had need of had been
[1:13:03] provided by grace. But in spite of all
[1:13:06] of that, you notice what they wanted?
[1:13:07] They wanted to be like the rest of the
[1:13:09] world. Here the grace of God had brought
[1:13:11] the greatest revival that had ever
[1:13:12] struck Israel or ever struck the world.
[1:13:14] Ain't nobody ever seen a revival like it
[1:13:16] was on the other side of the Red Sea.
[1:13:18] Here they were in a great revival, but
[1:13:20] brother Tom, they wanted to be like
[1:13:21] everybody else. He said, "And in spite
[1:13:23] of all that, they wanted a law instead."
[1:13:26] I thought, "M, that's about the way
[1:13:27] people are today. They have they have to
[1:13:29] have a law to I may as well preach it
[1:13:31] anyway." But people have to have a law
[1:13:33] to live by or they can't even serve God.
[1:13:35] You take away their legalism and they
[1:13:37] can't even be Christians. They can't
[1:13:38] they can't even serve God. You don't if
[1:13:40] you don't give them a border to live by
[1:13:42] and an instruction book to live by and
[1:13:44] this is how you dress and this is how
[1:13:45] you eat and this is what you can do
[1:13:47] today and this is what you can do
[1:13:48] tomorrow. If you don't give them a
[1:13:49] handbook to live by they can't even go
[1:13:51] on and serve God. They've been built up
[1:13:53] by well well I may as well preach. But
[1:13:55] they've been built up by so much
[1:13:56] legalism they can't serve God without a
[1:13:58] law.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; This is where Israel was. They had to
[1:14:01] have a oh friends let me just tell you I
[1:14:03] know many of you come out of situations
[1:14:05] like that. old legalist, old legalist
[1:14:07] mindset that that that you can't even
[1:14:09] serve God. It's all by your works that
[1:14:11] you're saved. I know sometimes they'll
[1:14:13] say you're saved by grace, but it has
[1:14:15] nothing to do with grace. Cuz if your
[1:14:16] works mess you up, then you're lost
[1:14:18] today and you're saved tomorrow. You're
[1:14:20] lost the next day and saved the next
[1:14:21] day, but it ain't got nothing to do with
[1:14:23] salvation. It ain't based on legalism
[1:14:25] and it ain't based on your works. It's
[1:14:27] based on the grace of God
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; and your faith in that grace.
[1:14:32] take away, you know, the the people get
[1:14:34] so bound up by legalism, they don't even
[1:14:35] know that what it's like to have liberty
[1:14:37] to serve God.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Remember said that it was grace that had
[1:14:40] provided them an escape out of Egypt
[1:14:42] before they had any law. I better get
[1:14:43] out of that before I get in trouble.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Before they had any law, it was grace
[1:14:47] that provided them a way out. And then
[1:14:49] grace had provided them one of the
[1:14:51] greatest revivals they had ever seen.
[1:14:53] And in this revival, they had seen great
[1:14:55] powers of God. They seen the sunshine on
[1:14:58] them while the rest of the world was in
[1:14:59] darkness. In this revival, they seen the
[1:15:01] mighty hand of God deliver innocent
[1:15:03] people, bringing them from the bondage
[1:15:05] uh in deliverance. In this revival, they
[1:15:07] crossed over the Red Sea. They found
[1:15:09] their enemies dead behind them. Why
[1:15:11] would you want to add anything to that?
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; But these people, they were only eight
[1:15:15] or 10 days away from the full promise of
[1:15:18] God if they would have just followed the
[1:15:20] leading of the Holy Spirit.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Just a few days away from the full
[1:15:24] promise of God. If they would have just
[1:15:26] followed the leading. He said, "But the
[1:15:28] most fatal mistake, you want to hear it?
[1:15:29] The most fatal mistake that Israel ever
[1:15:31] made was in Exodus the 19th chapter."
[1:15:34] You can read about it. Bible said after
[1:15:36] after grace had provided them all these
[1:15:38] things, given them this great revival,
[1:15:40] but still yet they required a law. Isn't
[1:15:43] it something? Isn't that just the mind?
[1:15:44] It's it's human nature is to require a
[1:15:48] law to be held by and to be bound by. So
[1:15:51] they could have all these schools and
[1:15:52] theological trained ministers, all this
[1:15:54] and be like the rest of the people.
[1:15:55] That's what they wanted. that that that
[1:15:57] way they could have all that, but you
[1:15:59] know what it does? In other words, they
[1:16:00] could be like everybody else and just
[1:16:01] have something to argue about,
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Well, we see that this way and y'all see
[1:16:04] it that way and they'll just have
[1:16:06] something to to fuss and go on about. He
[1:16:08] said, "See, just enough that they could
[1:16:10] have something to be to separate them
[1:16:12] from everybody else, to break up their
[1:16:13] fellowship and break up their
[1:16:15] brotherhood. See, if you make your laws
[1:16:16] and that that'll separate you from the
[1:16:18] other folks because their laws ain't
[1:16:19] going to be the same as yours."
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; See, so it makes it separate. See, see,
[1:16:24] but instead of just going the way that
[1:16:25] God had it going, they would have been
[1:16:27] all right. But we always try to put our
[1:16:29] own ideas and their own inject our own
[1:16:31] ideas and theology into God's spirit.
[1:16:33] And it takes God's spirit away. That's
[1:16:35] the way it was in that day. And they're
[1:16:37] there, they they were on the road, but
[1:16:38] they wanted something they could do
[1:16:39] themselves. But through their fussing
[1:16:42] and carrying on, they found out that
[1:16:43] they drove the spirit of God away from
[1:16:45] them. And it was a great mistake. It was
[1:16:47] a great mistake when they done that. And
[1:16:49] it was a great mistake when we did the
[1:16:51] same thing. our fathers when the Holy
[1:16:53] Spirit first fell on Isuza Street, many
[1:16:55] parts of the world. If we would have
[1:16:56] just let it go on, the leading of the
[1:16:58] spirit and kept the world out of it and
[1:17:00] go on then to let the Holy Spirit lead,
[1:17:02] we would have done been in the promised
[1:17:04] land.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Now, isn't that a powerful thought this
[1:17:07] morning? If the if the church would just
[1:17:08] let the Holy Spirit lead the church and
[1:17:10] people would just let the Holy Spirit I
[1:17:12] know that scares people when you start
[1:17:14] talking about what do you mean we would
[1:17:15] have done been in the promised land then
[1:17:17] what about us? You know, hear that maybe
[1:17:19] 60, 70 years ago. What about all of us?
[1:17:21] Can I just say this this morning just to
[1:17:23] ease your mind? But do you realize that
[1:17:25] anybody that ever belonged to God always
[1:17:27] belong to God and will be there in the
[1:17:28] end?
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Hello somebody. If you ever belong to
[1:17:32] God, you're always going to be there.
[1:17:33] And let me tell you, it don't matter
[1:17:34] whether I'm going to hurt somebody's
[1:17:36] doctrine here, but I'm going to say it
[1:17:37] anyway. It don't matter whether or not
[1:17:39] you ever breathe the breath of life in
[1:17:40] this body. You'll still be if you ever
[1:17:42] belong to God, you'll still be there on
[1:17:44] the other side. I don't care if you ever
[1:17:46] took a breath in this natural life. when
[1:17:49] you belong to God, you'd still be there
[1:17:50] on the other side. That's why he said we
[1:17:52] could have already been in the promised
[1:17:53] land and every one of us would have been
[1:17:55] there with him.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Let me read that to you out the Bible. 1
[1:17:58] Corinthians 15, Paul said there is a
[1:18:00] natural body and there's a spiritual
[1:18:02] body. He said, "See, the first man,
[1:18:04] Adam, was a living soul. The fir and the
[1:18:06] last Adam was a quickening spirit." He
[1:18:08] says, "So we have borne the image of the
[1:18:10] earthly and we shall bear the image of
[1:18:12] the heavenly." He talks about two
[1:18:14] bodies. Remember, he said, "But he said,
[1:18:17] but what were we first?" Let me ask you
[1:18:18] this. What were we first? Which came
[1:18:20] first? Was it the body or the seed?
[1:18:22] Paul's talking about two bodies. And
[1:18:23] here he says that that body has a seed
[1:18:26] in it that came from God in the
[1:18:27] beginning.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; So, but but let me ask you this. Was it
[1:18:30] did the seed come first or did the body
[1:18:32] come first?
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; How many wants to answer it? Which came
[1:18:34] first, the body or the seed? I know
[1:18:36] because people say that, well, God put a
[1:18:38] seed in your body. I've heard people say
[1:18:40] that a bunch. You know, God placed a
[1:18:41] seed in you. Well, that's that's that
[1:18:43] that's true in a sense, but not in this
[1:18:45] body. God didn't place a seed in this
[1:18:47] body after this body came to the earth.
[1:18:49] But can I tell you what Paul said? He
[1:18:51] when he was answering the question of
[1:18:52] what I know, don't let me get on a
[1:18:54] tangent, but but the Lord I'm just going
[1:18:56] to go this way. But but but when when
[1:18:58] you when when they were asking the
[1:18:59] question of what body was raised in
[1:19:01] after the resurrection, what body we
[1:19:03] would be in, Paul said he says that when
[1:19:05] a seed goes into the ground, he says,
[1:19:07] look, when a seed goes in that, it was a
[1:19:09] body that God gave it and it goes into
[1:19:11] the ground and it don't come out of the
[1:19:13] ground in that same body that went into
[1:19:14] the ground in. He said, but that body is
[1:19:16] destroyed. It fades away, but it comes
[1:19:19] back and it manifests what God had had
[1:19:21] thought of it in the beginning. He said,
[1:19:23] "So it brings forth it brings forth
[1:19:25] grain or or wheat or whatever other
[1:19:27] grain it was." He said, "But God giveth
[1:19:29] it a body as it hath pleased him. And he
[1:19:32] gives every seed his own body.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; And all flesh is not the same flesh.
[1:19:37] There's some of fish, some of beasts,
[1:19:39] some of fishes, some of birds. There's
[1:19:40] celestial bodies, there's terrestrial
[1:19:42] bodies. But we glory of a celestial is
[1:19:44] one, the glory of a terrestrial is the
[1:19:46] other." So here he's talking about
[1:19:47] there's an earthly body, there's a
[1:19:48] heavenly body, and then Paul says, "But
[1:19:50] God gave the seed the body that pleased
[1:19:52] God." So that means the seed was there
[1:19:55] before there was ever a body. He said
[1:19:57] God gave the seed. Somebody, somebody
[1:19:58] let that sink in this morning. But God
[1:20:00] gave the seed a body. God gave the seed
[1:20:03] a body. The seed was there first. It was
[1:20:05] something that was a part of God. It was
[1:20:07] in the mind of God. And God gave that a
[1:20:09] body. I don't care if it's a celestial
[1:20:11] body or if it's a terrestrial body. I
[1:20:14] don't care if they're walking on this
[1:20:15] earth or they never walked on this
[1:20:16] earth. I know it messes up some
[1:20:18] doctrine, but the reality is if you
[1:20:20] belong to God, you always belong to God.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Said the body, see, some will go right
[1:20:25] into that body and that body is there.
[1:20:27] Now, how many believe that you have a
[1:20:28] theophony body, a celestial and a
[1:20:30] terrestrial, but said it's real genuine
[1:20:32] Christianity. He said those disciples,
[1:20:34] they were predestinated. They were
[1:20:36] ordained to eternal life. He said they
[1:20:38] couldn't explain it. They couldn't
[1:20:39] explain it no more than the rest of
[1:20:41] them. But there was something in them
[1:20:43] that had representation in heaven. That
[1:20:46] ought to make a a Methus want to shout.
[1:20:48] To think that there's something in you
[1:20:49] that's being represented in heaven.
[1:20:51] That's why Paul said there's a body that
[1:20:53] glor a celestial and a terrestrial. We
[1:20:55] glory in the one. He said we have borne
[1:20:57] the image of that earthly body. And one
[1:21:00] of these days we will bear the image of
[1:21:01] that heavenly body. We borne the image
[1:21:03] of the first man Adam that was made out
[1:21:05] of the flesh of the ground. But one day
[1:21:07] we'll bear the same image of that
[1:21:09] heavenly Adam that came in the man Jesus
[1:21:11] Christ and we'll be in that other body.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; You see, there was something in them
[1:21:16] that had representation in heaven. Ain't
[1:21:18] that wonderful? How many's got
[1:21:20] representation in heaven? There's
[1:21:21] something in you that has
[1:21:22] representation. That's what causes you
[1:21:24] to believe the word of God. That's what
[1:21:26] causes you to say amen to the word. When
[1:21:29] other people would hear the same word,
[1:21:30] it don't mean nothing to them. It don't
[1:21:32] move them. It don't cause them to want
[1:21:33] to serve God. But something in you
[1:21:35] causes you to want to serve God. What is
[1:21:37] it, brother Mark? It's your
[1:21:38] representation in heaven that you belong
[1:21:40] to God.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Said a thought that God had of them
[1:21:44] before the foundation of the world. It
[1:21:46] manifested itself here. They were
[1:21:47] connected with God and was sure that
[1:21:50] God's promise was vindicated and there
[1:21:52] ain't nothing is going to change it from
[1:21:54] them. It's real genuine Christianity.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; When you belong to God, you already
[1:21:59] belong to God. Isn't that something? How
[1:22:01] many believes in eternal life? Amen.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; How many knows what the word eternal
[1:22:04] means? It means it never had a beginning
[1:22:06] and never had an ending.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Is that something to think that God
[1:22:09] would grant to you eternal life? In
[1:22:11] other words, brother Mark, it's hard for
[1:22:12] us to understand that because we're
[1:22:14] finite beings and all everything that we
[1:22:16] think of in our human mind is origin and
[1:22:18] where this came from and it had to have
[1:22:20] a star and it had to be put together and
[1:22:22] it had but but but in reality that we
[1:22:24] were in the mind of God. God has always
[1:22:26] existed. It's something that we cannot
[1:22:28] understand with our natural mind. So
[1:22:30] rather than try to figure out how that
[1:22:31] there's always been a God and there and
[1:22:33] God has created this world and instead
[1:22:36] of trying to figure it out, just accept
[1:22:37] that you were in the mind of God before
[1:22:39] there was ever a world created. And when
[1:22:41] God made this world, he made this world
[1:22:43] for what you were in his mind to be able
[1:22:45] to walk in. He created the mountains for
[1:22:47] the mountain lovers. He created the
[1:22:49] oceans for the ocean lovers. He made it
[1:22:51] just to your liking because you were in
[1:22:53] the mind of God before God ever created
[1:22:55] a world.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; We were eternal. Yeah.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; And we have eternal life. Everyone say
[1:23:01] eternal life. It means you always was.
[1:23:03] Somebody say that. You always was.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; See, you have eternal life. There's only
[1:23:08] one form of it, and that's God. You were
[1:23:10] his attribute. He thought of you and
[1:23:12] knowed you before the foundation of the
[1:23:14] world. That's why I would tell, you
[1:23:15] know, tell some little young ladies that
[1:23:18] maybe had had a miscarriage or a baby
[1:23:20] that wasn't born and they have so much
[1:23:21] struggle with it that you never have to
[1:23:23] worry about that one time. Do you
[1:23:25] realize that an unborn child has never
[1:23:27] had any sin outside of the sin that that
[1:23:30] that that we are that we are born in of
[1:23:32] a carnal conception that we are all born
[1:23:35] uh by by that sin? Outside of that sin,
[1:23:37] see a baby has no sin no more than it
[1:23:39] was born. We're all born in sin shaped
[1:23:41] in iniquity. But that sin that we were
[1:23:43] born in, it was Jesus died at Calvary
[1:23:46] and he took away the sins of the world.
[1:23:48] Therefore, the sin because of your birth
[1:23:51] as a child, as a baby, as an unborn
[1:23:54] child, that sin was taken away at
[1:23:55] Calvary when Jesus took away the sins of
[1:23:58] the world. So, therefore, there is no
[1:24:00] baby that has ever committed a sin until
[1:24:02] they come to the age of accountability
[1:24:04] because they it was taken away by Christ
[1:24:07] at Calvary. Isn't that something to
[1:24:08] think as a as a baby or an unborn baby
[1:24:11] or or or or or or a or a baby, a young
[1:24:14] baby that it has never had anything in
[1:24:16] its life. It has never sinned in any way
[1:24:18] because because Jesus took it away at
[1:24:20] Calvary. He said the baby could have
[1:24:22] been born. It might have died before it
[1:24:24] was born. May have been died before it
[1:24:25] came to accountability, but it it but
[1:24:28] Jesus already took its sins away. So,
[1:24:29] but after it gets old enough and commits
[1:24:31] sin, well, then you've got to confess
[1:24:33] your sin and be baptized for the
[1:24:35] remission of sins. But before you get to
[1:24:37] that age, there's no remission of sins
[1:24:39] because you've never committed a sin.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Sister, you know what that means,
[1:24:42] brother Mark? You don't have to worry.
[1:24:44] That means that one of these days, and
[1:24:45] this may not mean something to
[1:24:46] everybody, but it means something to
[1:24:47] somebody. But one of these days when you
[1:24:49] get over to the other side, there's a
[1:24:51] young man or a young woman that's going
[1:24:52] to walk up to you and call you mama and
[1:24:55] call you daddy that you never met in
[1:24:57] this life. You'll spend eternity with
[1:24:59] loved ones that you never got to spend
[1:25:00] this life with.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; That's the gospel truth. Amen.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul was talking about. It
[1:25:06] was a seed that was in God before you
[1:25:08] ever walked upon this earth. Before you
[1:25:10] were ever born in this world, they'd
[1:25:11] never committed sin. They never done no
[1:25:13] wrong. And you'll spend eternity. You
[1:25:15] ain't this the few uh moments in this
[1:25:17] life ain't nothing compared to eternity.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Listen what he was preaching. The
[1:25:24] children of Israel, they had got into
[1:25:25] this place for all these years. They
[1:25:27] wandered around the wilderness, but
[1:25:28] finally God comes to Moses. Did I run
[1:25:30] out of time?
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more minutes?
[1:25:34] But when mo when God comes to Moses, he
[1:25:36] says, "Then we turned and we took our
[1:25:38] journey into the wilderness by the way
[1:25:39] of the Red Sea." And the Lord spake to
[1:25:41] me after we had compassed about Mount
[1:25:43] Seir for many days.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; In other words, they got out into this
[1:25:47] wilderness. They wandered around the
[1:25:49] wilderness for all these years. After
[1:25:51] many days, he said, "We surpassed about
[1:25:53] this mountain." And the Lord spake to me
[1:25:55] and said, "You have compassed this
[1:25:57] mountain long enough
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; but turned you northward."
[1:26:01] See, there comes a time in your life. It
[1:26:03] was time to enter into the promise.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; The wilderness wandering was over.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; It was time to commit to God. It was
[1:26:11] time to submit to the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; But just like they think about it, just
[1:26:15] like they had a promise, so do we have a
[1:26:17] promise.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; See, the problem is, but too many are
[1:26:20] trying to put down roots in somebody
[1:26:22] else's promise. Cuz I love as God gives
[1:26:25] Moses these instructions that said,
[1:26:26] "You've been going around this mountain
[1:26:27] long enough, but it's time to go
[1:26:29] northward."
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; In other words, it's time to walk into
[1:26:31] the land of promise. You you've been
[1:26:33] you've been pidding around here long
[1:26:34] enough, but it's time to go ahead and
[1:26:36] take your inheritance. But, you know,
[1:26:37] but I I find out many people that when
[1:26:39] they get to that place that that that
[1:26:41] they decide that it's time to go back. I
[1:26:43] think the problem is is that too many
[1:26:45] people are trying to put down roots in
[1:26:47] somebody else's promise.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; You know, I it's like a church I went to
[1:26:50] one time, they were getting prepared for
[1:26:52] the tribulation. And I I went in there
[1:26:53] and one of the young men's he took me
[1:26:55] back into the back room and they had
[1:26:56] what they call trip packs. I don't know
[1:26:57] if y'all ever seen one, but they're
[1:26:59] they're tribulation backpacks. They had
[1:27:00] a cool name for it. Trib packs. And so
[1:27:02] we went in there and he said, "Yeah,
[1:27:03] these are trip packs." Everybody had
[1:27:04] their name on it. I said, "Well, what's
[1:27:05] in there?" Had all kinds of stuff. Had
[1:27:06] gas masks, had MREs, ready to eat. It
[1:27:09] had had all all kinds of medicine,
[1:27:12] certain things. And everybody in the
[1:27:13] church had a backpack that they would
[1:27:14] carry during tribulation. I thought,
[1:27:16] "Man, I I you can do that all you want
[1:27:18] to, but it ain't for me." He goes, "Man,
[1:27:19] we can get you one right here." I said,
[1:27:21] "I don't need a tribulation pack because
[1:27:22] that ain't my promise." See, there are
[1:27:24] too many people trying to put down roots
[1:27:26] in somebody else's promise. That ain't
[1:27:28] my promise. That's what's happened with
[1:27:29] the world today is they built too many
[1:27:31] things in a land that is not theirs.
[1:27:33] They build up denominations to think
[1:27:35] that's our promise. Long as we have a
[1:27:36] great big church and and has a few
[1:27:38] million dollars and has great big
[1:27:40] buildings and have a has a big
[1:27:41] membership, then that's the promise that
[1:27:43] God has given to us. But that wasn't the
[1:27:44] promise that God gave to the church.
[1:27:46] That ain't our promise. If we can have a
[1:27:48] school and we can reform people and we
[1:27:50] can cause them to break off their
[1:27:52] addictions and all that. Well, that's
[1:27:53] wonderful to try to help somebody get
[1:27:55] rid of something and go through alcohol
[1:27:56] anonymous and all these things. But do
[1:27:58] you realize that ain't the promise that
[1:28:00] God has given to the church.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; That ain't our promise.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "See, but our promise is the
[1:28:05] Holy Ghost."
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Paul said it was an earnest of our
[1:28:07] inheritance. He said, "What told me?" He
[1:28:10] said, "Listen," he said, "What what?"
[1:28:12] This is what God told Israel. He said,
[1:28:13] "Command the people. You are to pass
[1:28:16] through the coast of your brethren, the
[1:28:17] children of Esau, which dwell at sea,
[1:28:19] and they'll be afraid of you. He said,
[1:28:21] but but take good heed of yourselves.
[1:28:23] Metal not with them, for I will not give
[1:28:26] you their land, not even one foot of it.
[1:28:29] So here God says, you've been going
[1:28:30] around this mountain long enough. It's
[1:28:32] time to turn northward and go inherit
[1:28:34] your promise. And then he says, and on
[1:28:36] your way, you're going to encounter some
[1:28:38] things. On this way, you're going to
[1:28:39] pass by Seir. And when you go by sear, I
[1:28:42] want you to know that that ain't your
[1:28:43] land. And not even one foot of it
[1:28:45] belongs to you. So don't meddle with
[1:28:47] them. Ignore what they have to say. And
[1:28:49] just keep going forward to your promise.
[1:28:51] No ma no matter what they say. He said,
[1:28:53] you know, you're going to be with them
[1:28:55] anyway. You're going to be in the world.
[1:28:56] And here's what God told him. He said,
[1:28:58] "Go ahead and buy something to drink. Go
[1:28:59] ahead and buy something to eat. Go ahead
[1:29:01] and be go ahead and, you know, make make
[1:29:03] sure you have provisions, but don't try
[1:29:05] to stay there. Don't try to possess the
[1:29:07] land. It don't belong to you. I've gave
[1:29:09] that to Esau for a possession.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; So carry on.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; How many knows what the name Seer means?
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; It means a rough place.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many people that would that
[1:29:19] that go through rough places that you
[1:29:21] have passed.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; On this journey northward, how many
[1:29:24] rough places do you go through in your
[1:29:25] life? But I love the the the what what
[1:29:28] the Bible told them. God said, "But
[1:29:29] don't stop there. That ain't your
[1:29:31] possession.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; You may go through through some rough
[1:29:33] patches,
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; but don't don't set up shop there. Don't
[1:29:37] put roots there because that ain't your
[1:29:38] land. Not even one foot of it, your
[1:29:40] land. You may be going through a rough
[1:29:41] place. He said, but then after they got
[1:29:43] past Seir, he said, you're going to come
[1:29:44] to the city of R. And I I want you to
[1:29:47] know when you get to the city of R.
[1:29:49] Don't distress because the Moabites,
[1:29:50] they're not they don't belong to you.
[1:29:52] That is the land I gave them as their
[1:29:54] possession. They are the children of
[1:29:55] Lot. And I gave the city of R. And that
[1:29:57] land to the children of Lot.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; So don't try to take it. It ain't your
[1:30:02] land. They're going into your promise.
[1:30:03] Amen.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Isn't this something? God is walking
[1:30:06] them through this path before they ever
[1:30:08] get there, saying, "This is what you're
[1:30:09] going to encounter." You know what R
[1:30:11] means for the mark? It's a place. It's a
[1:30:12] city, which meant it was a place that
[1:30:14] had a watchtower. It was a place that
[1:30:16] had provisions. I It was a place that
[1:30:19] had plenty of food. It was a place that
[1:30:21] had lodging. It was a great city. You
[1:30:24] realize that sometimes that when you
[1:30:25] look at all of that had to offer, it
[1:30:28] seemed like it was a good place to stop.
[1:30:31] But God gives him a warning saying, "But
[1:30:33] don't stop there." That's right.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; You're going to come to a city. I
[1:30:35] thought, "My, isn't it something? When
[1:30:37] you come to a rough place, don't stop.
[1:30:39] When you come to where life is
[1:30:40] comfortable, don't stop. If it's good or
[1:30:42] whether it's bad, don't stop. It don't
[1:30:44] matter if you're poor or whether you're
[1:30:46] rich. Don't stop. It don't matter if
[1:30:48] it's comfort or it's discomfort. Don't
[1:30:49] stop short of the promise of God. If
[1:30:52] it's going good or if everything's
[1:30:53] falling apart, don't stop short of the
[1:30:55] promise of God." Amen.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul said, "I press toward
[1:30:58] the mark of the high calling of God."
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; It's time we press into the promise
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; that you said, "Well, brother man, where
[1:31:06] is the promise to the church?" Can I
[1:31:07] read it to you?
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Joel said, "It shall come to pass
[1:31:10] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[1:31:12] upon all flesh."
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; In Acts 2:39, Peter says, "For this
[1:31:15] promise is unto you and to your
[1:31:17] children." It's the promise of the Holy
[1:31:19] Ghost. You say, "Well, wasn't that just
[1:31:20] Israel unto you and to your children?"
[1:31:23] But Peter makes plain what Joel said
[1:31:24] even after Joel said it. He said, "But
[1:31:26] it's to them that are a far off,
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; as many as the Lord our God shall call."
[1:31:32] So it wasn't just to Israel and it
[1:31:34] wasn't just to the sons of Israel, but
[1:31:35] it was to them that are a far off and as
[1:31:37] many as the Lord shall call. That means
[1:31:39] that we have a right this morning to
[1:31:41] press into our promise of God or to
[1:31:43] press into the Holy Ghost. Brother
[1:31:44] Martin, let me tell you this. That's the
[1:31:46] only time that you'll ever get to a
[1:31:48] place that that the devil can't get a
[1:31:49] hold of you no more is when you find
[1:31:51] this is what Jesus had promised to the
[1:31:53] church. When the spirit of truth shall
[1:31:55] come, he shall be your guide. When the
[1:31:57] spirit of truth shall come, he shall be
[1:31:59] your comfort. Let me tell you, that's
[1:32:00] why people live such lives that they
[1:32:02] can't just surrender to God. It's
[1:32:04] because the spirit of truth is not
[1:32:06] dwelling in the throne of their heart.
[1:32:08] Yes.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; But if you can realize it this morning
[1:32:11] that God has given us a promise, brother
[1:32:13] Mark, that promise is a token that's
[1:32:15] given to the believers.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; It's what'll take you through this land
[1:32:18] and bring you through the other side
[1:32:19] victorious.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; It's a token that that God has given to
[1:32:22] us by the blood of Jesus Christ. Just
[1:32:24] like they had a token in Egypt when they
[1:32:27] come out of Egypt and they put the blood
[1:32:28] on the door. And just like they had a
[1:32:30] token in Jericho when Rahab hung that
[1:32:32] scarlet cord out her window and all that
[1:32:35] was in her house has been saved. That
[1:32:36] same thing that you and I have today by
[1:32:38] the blood of Jesus Christ, we have a
[1:32:40] token that God has given to the church.
[1:32:42] And just as much as they were saved from
[1:32:44] it in Egypt and they were saved from it
[1:32:46] in Jericho, we are saved from that
[1:32:48] bloodbound uh covenant that God has
[1:32:50] given unto us for that. For said, see,
[1:32:53] he said they were saved each one of them
[1:32:55] and we are saved today. It's a
[1:32:56] bloodbound promise of God. The blood of
[1:32:59] Jesus Christ, Paul called it an
[1:33:00] everlasting covenant. He said, "And that
[1:33:02] bloodbound promise makes us free from
[1:33:04] sin and shame and different from the
[1:33:06] rest of the world." You don't have to
[1:33:08] dress different. Anybody can dress
[1:33:10] different. You have to be on the inside
[1:33:12] different. The life is on the inside. It
[1:33:14] ain't about dressing or wearing. The
[1:33:16] kingdom of God is not meat and drink or
[1:33:18] wearing apparel. It's the long
[1:33:19] suffering, goodness, greatness,
[1:33:21] gentleness, patience in the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; It's not about what you wear. Come on,
[1:33:27] somebody.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; That's what the legalist does. They make
[1:33:29] you a bunch of rules and as long as you
[1:33:31] dress like it and look like it and act
[1:33:33] like it, well then you're saved. And
[1:33:34] ain't never saved a single person.
[1:33:36] You'll be as lost as you ever was.
[1:33:38] You'll be the you'll be the most demonic
[1:33:40] field dressw wearing girl that there
[1:33:41] ever was outside of the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; I don't care how long your dress is.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; How long your hair is, it ain't got
[1:33:48] nothing to do with it. He said that that
[1:33:49] the kingdom of God, can I read that
[1:33:51] again? The kingdom of God is not meat
[1:33:53] and drink or wearing of apparel. It's
[1:33:54] the long-suffering, goodness,
[1:33:56] gentleness, patience in the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:58] That is the kingdom of God.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; And once you get into that,
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; well then you're heaven bound.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Once you get into that, well then you
[1:34:08] don't have to worry about people trying
[1:34:10] to dress holy and act holy.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; If you ever get people into that, you
[1:34:14] don't have to rule them with a a thumb
[1:34:16] and try to watch over them and go
[1:34:18] through their wardrobe and and stalk
[1:34:20] them on Facebook to see what they're all
[1:34:22] up to. You don't have to worry about
[1:34:23] that.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Once you get them to this,
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; say the spirit of truth will lead you
[1:34:29] and guide you
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; into all truth. You won't need no man
[1:34:32] coming by and making up a bunch of rules
[1:34:33] for you to live by. The spirit of truth
[1:34:35] will lead you and guide you. This is a
[1:34:37] promise Jesus gave to every man as many
[1:34:39] as the Lord our God shall call.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Said in them is the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; When there is a holy God on the throne
[1:34:47] of a human heart, then that's when a
[1:34:51] human heart expresses a life of
[1:34:52] holiness.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not when you change your
[1:34:55] wardrobe.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; It's when the holy God is enthroned on a
[1:34:58] human heart.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; And then that holy God will begin to
[1:35:02] express outwardly an inward work that's
[1:35:04] been done.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? That's that's
[1:35:07] that's where the legalists have missed
[1:35:09] it because they made everybody saved by
[1:35:11] their works and then they all wind up
[1:35:13] right back where they came out of
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; because they stopped there and they they
[1:35:16] they established themselves in a land
[1:35:19] that is not their land.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; That wasn't the promise. The promise was
[1:35:22] the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:23] because they stopped short of the Holy
[1:35:25] Ghost with them. They had to have
[1:35:26] legalism to rule over people. But
[1:35:28] really, what we need is people to go on
[1:35:30] in and possess the promise
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; that God has given to the church.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; So, see, when God sits in the control
[1:35:36] tower of a human heart,
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; then he can call you and he releases
[1:35:41] things out of your life. But let me tell
[1:35:42] you this, brother Mark, it wasn't just
[1:35:44] for the fathers, but it was also for the
[1:35:47] children. Is that what Joel said?
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Promise is not just for the fathers, but
[1:35:50] for the children. I thought, isn't that
[1:35:52] something? One day, Abraham's grandson,
[1:35:54] Jacob,
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; he came to the very same place that
[1:35:57] Abraham was.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he said to Jacob, "Arise,
[1:36:00] go to Bethl and dwell there." Isn't that
[1:36:02] something? The same place that Abraham
[1:36:04] had met God and had this this great
[1:36:06] experience with God. The place that God
[1:36:08] had called Abraham back to, he says,
[1:36:10] "Jacob, go to this same place."
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; And when and when Jacob come to the
[1:36:14] place, he said unto Jacob and his
[1:36:16] household, "Put away the strange gods
[1:36:18] that are among you and be clean and
[1:36:19] change your garments. Let us arise and
[1:36:21] go to Bethl. And he says, "Let us arise,
[1:36:24] go to Bethl, and make there an altar
[1:36:25] unto God who answered me in the day of
[1:36:27] my distress." Here Jacob in this great
[1:36:29] time of trouble, God says, "You go to
[1:36:32] the place that Abraham met me and I'll
[1:36:33] meet you there."
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; So, see, so he went to the same place
[1:36:37] that Abraham met said, "In the day which
[1:36:39] I went, and he gave orders to them, take
[1:36:42] away your strange gods, be clean, and
[1:36:45] change your garments. Let us arise and
[1:36:46] go to Methyl or Bethl." And they gave to
[1:36:48] Jacob all their strange gods that were
[1:36:51] in their hand and all their earrings
[1:36:52] which are in their ears. And Jacob hid
[1:36:54] them under an oak tree by Sheckchum.
[1:36:57] All the things, all the strange gods,
[1:36:59] all the things of worship, he hid them
[1:37:01] under an oak tree and they went, they
[1:37:02] built an altar in the same place Abraham
[1:37:04] did
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; that he could commit his life back to
[1:37:07] God. Let me tell you this, friends. You
[1:37:09] may not have an oak tree to hide them
[1:37:10] under, but I tell you what we have. We
[1:37:12] have the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; He's given us a place to hide
[1:37:15] everything. every strange God, every
[1:37:17] thing that you built up in your life
[1:37:19] that was between you and God, anything
[1:37:21] that would stand in the way of you
[1:37:23] having a holy life said. And when he
[1:37:25] went to that place and he got there,
[1:37:26] brother Mark, and he built an altar, you
[1:37:28] know what happened? Just what God said
[1:37:29] would happen. The Bible said, "And God
[1:37:31] appeared unto Jacob."
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; And God said unto him, "Thy name shall
[1:37:35] not be called Jacob anymore, but Israel
[1:37:37] shall be thy name." And he called his
[1:37:39] name Israel. Ain't that something? And
[1:37:41] Jacob called the name of the place where
[1:37:43] God spake with him, Bethl. I want the
[1:37:46] music players come this morning.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Said the one, isn't it something? The
[1:37:50] one Jacob, the very man that his name
[1:37:54] was changed from Jacob to Israel.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; He got his experience at the same thing,
[1:38:00] same place that his father Abraham had
[1:38:02] got his experience.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? He So Abraham, how
[1:38:06] many knows what Abraham was called in
[1:38:07] the Bible? The father of promise.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; He was the father of the promise. He was
[1:38:11] father Abraham. I thought, isn't it
[1:38:12] something that the that the that the
[1:38:14] children receive theirs at the same
[1:38:16] place that the fathers receive theirs?
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; See, they they the same place the father
[1:38:21] had his experience, the children
[1:38:22] received their experience the same
[1:38:24] place. You say, "Well, who's the father
[1:38:25] of the promise?" I remember what the
[1:38:26] Bible said. Jesus said, "I send the
[1:38:28] promise of my father upon you. Terry in
[1:38:30] the city of Jerusalem until you be
[1:38:31] endued with power from on high." Brother
[1:38:35] Mark, one day they went down there and
[1:38:36] they waited in that room. They terried,
[1:38:39] they prayed, they longed.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; And then the Bible says, "And then the
[1:38:42] spirit of God came into that place. The
[1:38:45] Holy Ghost and little licks of fire fell
[1:38:47] on every one of them.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; And they were filled with the baptism of
[1:38:50] the Holy Ghost."
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; How many realize that's who they were?
[1:38:53] That was our fathers,
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; our Pentecostal fathers. And just like
[1:38:57] Jacob was, whose name was changed to
[1:39:00] Israel, and he went right to that place
[1:39:02] of Bethl where the father of the promise
[1:39:05] had received his experience. That's what
[1:39:07] happened with the church today. We're
[1:39:09] the church of the living God. Remember
[1:39:11] what happened in this age? The prophet
[1:39:13] of God would come. Remember what the
[1:39:14] Bible said? He would come and turn the
[1:39:16] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:39:17] of their fathers. So what was it was
[1:39:19] doing? It was cause us to look back to
[1:39:21] those Pentecostal fathers. So here we
[1:39:23] stand today just like Jacob was as the
[1:39:26] church that has been called out and been
[1:39:27] given a name change. No longer said, "No
[1:39:30] longer will I call you church, but now I
[1:39:32] will call you bride." So here we stand
[1:39:34] just like it was in the Bible. Brother
[1:39:36] Mark, it's the church that has received
[1:39:37] a name change. She's called the bride of
[1:39:40] Jesus Christ. And now she goes right to
[1:39:42] the same place that the fathers of the
[1:39:44] promise received their experience. And
[1:39:45] she receives her experience
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; in an upper room
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; in an outpouring of the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; It ain't in a church. It ain't in a
[1:39:54] denomination. It ain't putting a name
[1:39:56] above a door or signing your name on a
[1:39:58] membership book. But there ain't one
[1:40:00] place that you can ever meet God, and
[1:40:01] that's at the that's at the cross of
[1:40:03] Calvary. But Mark, it's an upper room
[1:40:05] experience. It's a by the word of God
[1:40:07] according to the word that you could
[1:40:09] have the same experience that they had.
[1:40:11] You say, "Well, where where is this
[1:40:12] place? It's a place that you would tar
[1:40:15] place that they prayed and waited upon
[1:40:17] the Lord." Abraham said, "You've got to
[1:40:19] do the same thing they did on the day of
[1:40:21] Pentecost. You've got to have the same
[1:40:23] experience. You got to have the same
[1:40:24] thing they had."
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; God don't ever change his program.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; He don't change his ways. He just does
[1:40:30] the same thing all the time. Isn't that
[1:40:32] what the Bible said? Jesus Christ is the
[1:40:34] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; And if that's the way God done it back
[1:40:38] then, then isn't that the way God does
[1:40:40] it today?
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; And he's called this church back to that
[1:40:45] place
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; to have a real experience with God. And
[1:40:48] not just to stop in a revival. Not just
[1:40:50] to stop and say, "Well, I had a great
[1:40:52] move of God." Won't you stand to your
[1:40:54] feet this morning? I I had a great
[1:40:55] revival and I felt the spirit of God.
[1:40:57] Not just to stop there, but to believe
[1:41:00] on into the Holy Ghost.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Don't meddle and sear and don't meddle
[1:41:06] and are, but believe on into the Holy
[1:41:09] Ghost. See, if the Holy Spirit was the
[1:41:12] promise to those Pentecostal fathers,
[1:41:15] can I just say it like this? It was a
[1:41:17] promise to the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:19] Amen.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; He promised that you would receive
[1:41:21] power, that the spirit of truth would
[1:41:23] come. And by the grace of God, that
[1:41:26] great message of grace that we have
[1:41:27] received in this hour, for the market
[1:41:29] turned our hearts.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; You realize that the message that you've
[1:41:33] heard in this hour was no different than
[1:41:36] the voice that Jacob heard when he was
[1:41:38] in his distress and he called unto the
[1:41:40] Lord.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. And he said, "I heard the voice
[1:41:43] of God say, Jacob,
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; go to the place of Bethl
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; where your fathers were.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Go to the land that Abraham, the place
[1:41:53] where Abraham had built his altar, and I
[1:41:55] will meet you there." Realize that's the
[1:41:58] whole message. That's the the message of
[1:42:00] grace that we have heard in this hour.
[1:42:03] It was to call us to the place that our
[1:42:06] fathers had met God. to turn our hearts
[1:42:09] back to that place and say, "Go to this
[1:42:10] place. I will meet you there." Not in a
[1:42:14] great church or some man-made something,
[1:42:17] but the place where God meets his
[1:42:20] children. I wonder how many bow their
[1:42:21] heads this morning. Say, "Brother Matt,
[1:42:23] I maybe maybe maybe you maybe you've
[1:42:26] been compassing around this mountain for
[1:42:28] many days."
[1:42:30] Maybe you can say it like the Lord said
[1:42:33] to Moses, "Y'all passed around this
[1:42:36] mountain many days, but turned you
[1:42:37] northward northward." Say, "Brother
[1:42:39] Matt, you know, I've been passing about
[1:42:41] it. Seems like I've been going around in
[1:42:43] circles around." God bless you, brother.
[1:42:45] God bless you, brother. God bless you.
[1:42:46] I've been going around in circles. God
[1:42:48] bless you. Hands all over the building.
[1:42:50] Been going around this same mountain
[1:42:52] days. I just can't get past this one
[1:42:54] point or this one place.
[1:42:56] You know, it just seems like every time
[1:42:58] I start the journey, I get meddled up in
[1:43:01] something and something always pulling
[1:43:03] us aside.
[1:43:06] But I really want to come to this place.
[1:43:09] I want to receive the promise of God in
[1:43:11] my life. I want to be so sealed with the
[1:43:13] Holy Ghost that the devil wouldn't even
[1:43:15] know what to do with me.
[1:43:19] God bless you this morning. Let's just
[1:43:20] bow our heads.
[1:43:22] Gracious heavenly father,
[1:43:25] Lord, what a precious promise that you
[1:43:28] have given unto us today.
[1:43:31] Lord, knowing that within our own
[1:43:34] weakness, Lord, we could never possess.
[1:43:37] But Lord, I read your word this morning
[1:43:39] and hear that you said, "I will send the
[1:43:44] spirit of truth." The spirit of truth
[1:43:47] shall come to you.
[1:43:49] words, Lord, that would cause us to
[1:43:52] realize that it's not something that we
[1:43:55] had sought after, Lord, but it was
[1:43:57] something that sought after us,
[1:43:59] Lord. And then I read of Abraham and how
[1:44:01] that when he got into the land of Egypt
[1:44:04] and couldn't find a way out, but grace
[1:44:06] went to where he was and it called him
[1:44:09] back to the land that you gave him,
[1:44:12] Lord. how Jacob whenever you would call
[1:44:14] upon your name and in his hour of
[1:44:17] distress Lord but you would meet him and
[1:44:20] give him a place Lord an altar to go to
[1:44:25] that he could receive you Lord when I
[1:44:28] think on those things Lord I realize
[1:44:30] it's not in my own ability
[1:44:32] Lord it's just relying upon you and your
[1:44:35] grace in this hour and Lord I see hands
[1:44:38] around this building Lord that have been
[1:44:40] raised this morning God that have re
[1:44:42] that have lifted their hands to receive
[1:44:44] the grace of God. Lord, I pray that you
[1:44:47] could lead them, Lord. Lead them past
[1:44:49] every mountain, every valley, every
[1:44:51] city, Lord, that would be a distraction
[1:44:53] in their life, God, and bring them to
[1:44:55] the place of promise, Lord. Let them be
[1:44:57] so filled with the spirit of God, Lord.
[1:44:59] Let them believe on into the promise of
[1:45:01] God, Lord. Let the things of this world
[1:45:03] be cast out of their life. Lord, let
[1:45:05] such a life of holiness, Lord, be poured
[1:45:08] out of their life.
[1:45:10] Lord, we just thank you for it this
[1:45:11] morning. Lord, let us commit to you. Let
[1:45:14] us surrender to you this morning. We
[1:45:16] thank you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; I've been free.
[1:45:36] I've been delivered.
[1:45:40] Yes, I found joy.
[1:45:44] I found peace.
[1:45:47] Amazing grace
[1:45:51] and favor.
[1:45:54] And right now
[1:45:56] is the moment.
[1:45:59] Today is the day I've been changed.
[1:46:05] Yes, I've been changed.
[1:46:08] And I said, "I won't go back. I can't go
[1:46:13] back to the way it used to be before
[1:46:18] your spirit came and changed me."
[1:46:22] Well, I said I won't go back. I can't go
[1:46:27] back to the way you used to be before
[1:46:32] your spirit came and changed me. Yes,
[1:46:36] I've been changed.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; I've been changed.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; I've been healed.
[1:46:44] Yes, free
[1:46:46] and deliver.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, I found joy
[1:46:54] and peace.
[1:46:57] Amazing grace
[1:47:01] and favor.
[1:47:04] And right now is the moment.
[1:47:08] Today is the day I be changed.
[1:47:14] Yes, I'll be changed
[1:47:25] to be for your spirit came and changed
[1:47:29] me.
[1:47:31] Then I said, "I won't go back. I can't
[1:47:35] go back to the way you
[1:47:41] spirit came and changed me." Well, all
[1:47:45] my change.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; All my s
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; All my sins.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. All my sins.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; They've been forgiven.
[1:47:58] Now there's no more chain.
[1:48:02] No more
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; is all I have.
[1:48:09] This might be over
[1:48:12] and right now is the morning.
[1:48:17] Today is the day I've been changed.
[1:48:22] Yes, I've been changed.
[1:48:26] And I said I won't go back. I can't go
[1:48:30] back to the way it used to be before
[1:48:35] your spirit came and changed me.
[1:48:39] But I said I won't go back. I can't go
[1:48:44] back to the way it used to be before
[1:48:48] your spirit came and changed me.
[1:48:53] Well, all my chains,
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; all my chains,
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; all my king,
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; all my
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. All my sins,
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; they been forgiven.
[1:49:06] Now there's no more chains.
[1:49:10] No more.
[1:49:14] Yes. For my past,
[1:49:17] it is finally over.
[1:49:20] Am I now? Let me testify that this
[1:49:24] morning. Yesterday is my day. I've been
[1:49:28] changed.
[1:49:30] Yes, I been changed.
[1:49:35] And I won't go back. I can't go back to
[1:49:40] the way. That means I can't go back to
[1:49:42] it. The devil can't bring it back up in
[1:49:44] my life because it's been in the sea of
[1:49:46] God's forgetfulness. Well, I I can't go
[1:49:50] back. I can't go back to Thank you,
[1:49:53] Lord. Yes, Lord. Before your spirit came
[1:49:58] and changed me.
[1:50:01] Yes. All my shame.
[1:50:03] If you want somebody to their feet this
[1:50:05] morning,
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. All my sins,
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; they been forgiven.
[1:50:14] Now there's no more chains.
[1:50:17] Glory
[1:50:21] is all my
[1:50:35] chang.
[1:50:45] I can't go back to the way you used to
[1:50:49] be before your spirit came and changed
[1:50:53] me.
[1:50:55] Then I said, I won't go back. Can't go
[1:50:59] back to the way you used to be before
[1:51:04] your spirit came and changed me.
[1:51:11] Amen. Won't you give him a hand clap of
[1:51:13] praise this morning? Aren't you glad
[1:51:15] that God has a place to bring us to that
[1:51:18] you don't have to go back into the world
[1:51:20] again? Amen. Can we sing this? God is my
[1:51:23] everything. Amen. and he supplied all of
[1:51:25] our needs. Took every every trial that
[1:51:28] we face by the mark. He's given us the
[1:51:29] ability to overcome it. And you believe
[1:51:31] that this morning that we're saved by
[1:51:34] the grace of Jesus Christ. Our faith in
[1:51:36] the grace of God. That's what saves us.
[1:51:38] Not what church you go to. Hello,
[1:51:40] somebody.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Not what name you put on the door, but
[1:51:44] what God is living in your heart.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; That's what we believe this morning. How
[1:51:49] many believe that
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, the Bible said his name
[1:51:52] was put above every name there was.
[1:51:54] There ain't but one name that there's
[1:51:55] one intercessor between man and God. And
[1:51:57] that is the man Christ Jesus.

[1:58:00] I was covering up the secret tears. I
[1:58:04] cried.
[1:58:07] Then one day someone told me of your
[1:58:11] mercy
[1:58:14] and the love you shown on a hill called
