[43:12] righteousness and amen we've been called
[43:14] by his name isn't it an honor tonight to
[43:16] know him amen I just stand in there
[43:18] thinking a few years ago I had the
[43:20] privilege to meet the man who wrote that
[43:22] song I many of you all probably know him
[43:24] Ronnie Henson sang with the Henson for
[43:26] years and I stood there and talked to
[43:28] him for a few moments and he was just
[43:30] sharing with me about the inspiration
[43:32] and how he's heard it sung so many times
[43:34] and I couldn't help but think amen
[43:36] that's a beautiful song but it's totally
[43:38] different when a Believer sings it amen
[43:41] not a performance but from a reality
[43:43] tonight and amen you love the Lord this
[43:45] evening amen maybe we just buy our
[43:47] hearts together for a word of prayer I
[43:49] know there's many needs among us tonight

[43:53] he's moving in the midst of his church
[43:55] maybe you just have something on on your
[43:57] heart tonight I believe he sees your
[43:59] hand and I believe he's able to move on
[44:01] the face of the conditions Heavenly

[45:31] evening if you have your Bibles while

[45:42] of John amen 1 Corinthians 15 and while

[45:47] greet you all in the name of the Lord
[45:48] Jesus it's a honor to be here tonight

[45:51] opportunity to speak to you and amen
[45:53] appreciate brother Matt for allowing us
[45:55] to amen speak to you tonight from the
[45:57] word of the Lord and I know amen there's
[45:59] uh many needs among us but we know the
[46:00] Lord's among us as well and amen I know
[46:03] it's a it's a dark time but it's also a
[46:06] time of light to the Believers and amen
[46:08] we do want to just thank you all once
[46:09] again for amen all you've done to help
[46:11] us in the move and support we want to
[46:13] say God bless you all and appreciate it
[46:15] and amen is't it good to go to church on
[46:17] a Wednesday night and see so many
[46:18] Believers out amen don't have to be here
[46:21] but they want to be here and amen good
[46:23] to see you brother Samuel and Isaiah God
[46:24] bless you all amen last time I seen you
[46:27] was headed west so I guess you're headed
[46:29] back East amen sure good to see you all
[46:31] 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse
[46:34] number one Paul here writing he says
[46:37] moreover Brethren I declare unto you the
[46:40] gospel somebody say the gospel which I
[46:43] preached unto you which also you have
[46:45] received and wherein you stand by which
[46:47] also ye are saved if you keep in memory
[46:51] what I preached unto you unless you have
[46:53] believed in vain for I delivered unto
[46:56] you first of all that which I also
[46:58] received how that Christ died for our
[47:00] sins according to the scriptures and
[47:04] that he was buried and that he rose
[47:06] again the third day according to the
[47:10] scripture now that's astounding to me
[47:12] that everything he did from his birth to
[47:14] his life to his death and according to
[47:17] the scripture and his resurrection he
[47:19] did that all according to the scripture
[47:22] now in the book of St Luke the 24th
[47:24] chapter it's a very very very familiar
[47:27] reading in St Luke chapter 24 uh brother
[47:31] Brandon will use this text many times uh
[47:33] speaking on when their eyes were open
[47:35] they knew him and he refers to it many
[47:37] times in St Luke 24 and verse 30 the two
[47:40] were walking on the road to Aus and this
[47:43] is actually after Christ is raised from
[47:45] the dead and he appears to him and in
[47:48] the in the 29th verse it says but they
[47:51] constrained him saying abide with us for
[47:54] it is toward evening and the day is far
[47:56] spent and he went in to Terry with them
[47:59] and it came to pass as he set at meat
[48:01] with him he took bread and blessed it
[48:04] and break and gave to them now notice
[48:06] this and their eyes were opened and they
[48:09] knew him and he vanished out of their
[48:11] sight now watch in verse 32 and they
[48:14] said one to another did not our hearts
[48:16] burn within us while he talked with us
[48:19] by the way and while he opened to us the
[48:22] scriptures so he's just raised according
[48:25] to the scripture and now he speaking to
[48:27] them from the scripture now if the
[48:29] scripture speaks of the bridegroom I
[48:31] believe it has to speak of the Bride as
[48:33] well so in St John chapter 14 one verse
[48:36] I want to read there St John
[48:38] 14 and verse 19 brother Brandon picks
[48:42] this up and it is the rising of the Sun
[48:44] in St John
[48:45] 14:19 he says now yet a little while and
[48:48] the world seeth me no more but ye see me
[48:53] because I live ye shall live on also
[48:57] brother B said speaking to his wife
[49:00] because I live ye shall live also we ask
[49:02] the Lord this evening to add the
[49:03] blessing to the reading of his word as
[49:05] you can have your seats here amen I want
[49:07] to from those scriptures for a few
[49:09] moments if I would take a title tonight
[49:11] I want to title this walking in the
[49:13] precious light of his resurrection amen
[49:16] walking in the precious light of his
[49:18] resurrection how many amen is thankful
[49:20] tonight for the promise amen of the
[49:22] Resurrection you know just to read a few
[49:25] quotes here to lay a foundation brother
[49:26] I'm speaking and I know my redeemer
[49:28] liveth 1958 he's praying he says Dear
[49:31] God we are grateful this morning to be
[49:33] the people that is called by thy name we
[49:35] are so glad that we do not have to just
[49:38] imagine anymore amen of a great
[49:40] resurrection that is to come he said
[49:43] because it's become a reality to us as
[49:46] we read it in thy word and see that thou
[49:49] H has promised this and filled it within
[49:51] our souls amen That Jesus Lives now
[49:54] that's very astounding to me amen that
[49:57] as one reads the word concerning the
[49:59] resurrection that it actually has the
[50:01] ability to become a reality amen as you
[50:04] read about it in other words amen you're
[50:06] no longer just reading about something
[50:08] that's in the future amen but it's
[50:10] actually becoming a reality in the
[50:12] present he said we are thinking this
[50:13] morning of the many heartaches that's
[50:15] been in life and the many sadnesses that
[50:17] we went through and the experiences that
[50:20] has toring us and throwing us to The
[50:21] Winds of the earth he said how that we
[50:23] have buried our loved ones and we
[50:25] mourned at the grave he said and our
[50:27] soul just seems to almost perish within
[50:29] us amen but then we can think of today
[50:32] oh what it means that Jesus is raised
[50:35] from the dead he has spoed every Power
[50:38] of the enemy when he rose up triumphant
[50:40] he took all the Shadows away he said and
[50:43] now we walk in the precious light of his
[50:46] resurrection amen because he rose from
[50:49] the grave according to the scripture
[50:51] amen we are now walking in the precious
[50:53] light of his resurrection again he says
[50:55] I know that my My Redeemer liveth and at
[50:57] the last day he will stand upon the
[51:01] Earth though after the skin worms
[51:02] destroy this body yet in my flesh shall
[51:05] I see God I'm speaking of job he said he
[51:08] seen the resurrection would be brought
[51:10] about by a man someday the sin question
[51:13] would be settled when that righteous one
[51:15] the Son of God Amen came to die for
[51:17] Sinners there was no man on the earth at
[51:20] that time or no man sense that could
[51:22] ever Bridge the way between a holy God
[51:25] and a sinful man man but job here 4,000
[51:29] years before his coming he saw his death
[51:32] his burial and his resurrection and his
[51:34] justification that came by the
[51:37] resurrection now watch brother R does
[51:39] not just leave this on the Lord amen but
[51:41] he says and the absolute guarantee amen
[51:44] of the resurrection of the believer so
[51:46] because job saw amen that there would
[51:48] come a resurrection by the Son of God he
[51:51] could also see that whoever believed in
[51:53] him amen would also be a part of the
[51:56] Resurrection C he said then what a
[51:58] comfort it is to know amen that those
[52:00] things are true that it's not a fiction
[52:02] story let me say the gospel is not a
[52:05] fiction story amen the gospel is the
[52:07] birth it is the life it is the death it
[52:10] is the burial and it is also the
[52:12] resurrection amen of our Lord and Savior
[52:15] Jesus Christ and I want to say Amen
[52:17] there's not many gospels there's only
[52:19] one gospel amen and it is the true
[52:22] gospel and the prophet of God said if
[52:23] there is another gospel amen as Paul
[52:26] spoke spoke to one of those groups he
[52:27] said I'm so surprised amen that you are
[52:30] turned to another gospel which there is
[52:32] no other amen but a make belief gospel
[52:35] Amen to a denominational fiction amen
[52:38] turning from that good news and because
[52:41] I live ye live also and I live in you
[52:44] and the works that I do John 14 The
[52:46] Works I do amen will identify myself in
[52:49] you he says what a message amen no
[52:52] wonder we've had a dark world of
[52:54] theology amen but in the evening time
[52:57] amen there shall come light again amen
[53:00] job saw light in the morning time amen
[53:04] by the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[53:06] Christ amen but in the evening time
[53:08] brother B says there will be a
[53:10] resurrection in the evening time amen
[53:12] because I live ye live also see amen
[53:15] what a resurrection that that was amen
[53:18] but what a resurrection this is Amen to
[53:21] be quickened from the dead and to be
[53:23] made alive in Christ Jesus by God
[53:26] quickening power amen so tonight we're
[53:29] not sitting here amen looking back at
[53:31] the resurrection 2,000 years ago and
[53:34] saying what a resurrection what a move
[53:36] of God what a manifestation amen but
[53:39] because the light has returned amen we
[53:42] can say tonight amen The Same Spirit
[53:44] that raised our Lord from the dead back
[53:46] there has returned to the church by the
[53:49] message of the hour and we can say that
[53:51] the word of God Amen is not a fiction
[53:54] amen it's not a fairy tale amen the word
[53:57] of God is a resurrection power he said
[54:00] now this is not fiction this is the
[54:02] Bible it's God's truth it's his promise
[54:05] I have tried it I have tested it and I
[54:07] know you can amen take God's word and he
[54:10] will make it right with you amen he will
[54:13] bring it to pass brother said now we
[54:15] know there's going to be amen an
[54:17] absolute guarantee of a resurrection now
[54:20] brother took time to tell us amen what
[54:22] that word absolute means it means
[54:24] perfect in itself it is Unlimited in its
[54:27] power and it is primarily an ultimate
[54:30] see it's Unlimited in its power it's
[54:33] perfect in itself and it really is an
[54:35] ultimate re said therefore I think
[54:37] everybody amen should have an ultimate
[54:40] every great achievement that is ever
[54:42] been achieved there's been an absolute
[54:44] behind it see no matter what it was it
[54:46] had an absolute behind it and every
[54:49] person in order to achieve something
[54:51] amen has to First have an absolute he
[54:54] said that's the final wine back amen
[54:56] through this through that through the
[54:58] other amen till you come back to the
[55:00] absolute or the amen or the ultimate you
[55:03] cannot go on through life amen without
[55:06] having an absolute I also took time to
[55:09] look up what the word guarantee mean and
[55:11] the word guarantee is a formal promise
[55:14] amen or assurance that is typically in
[55:16] writing amen that certain conditions
[55:19] will be fulfilled it is something that
[55:21] gives a certainty amen of an outcome so
[55:24] when you have a guarantee
[55:26] you have a formal writing amen that
[55:29] something is going to happen amen and
[55:32] whatever you're in you're going to come
[55:33] out now y'all remember I spoke to you a
[55:35] few months ago on coming out of
[55:36] situations amen and how there'll be an
[55:38] outcome amen remember the definition of
[55:41] outcome just turn the words around and
[55:42] it's come out so amen whatever you're
[55:44] going through according to the word of
[55:46] the Lord you're going to come out of it
[55:48] amen because we don't just have a
[55:50] feeling you're going to come out we
[55:52] don't just have a sensation you're going
[55:53] to come out amen but we have an absolute
[55:56] guarantee Amen in the word of God now
[55:58] I'll just say this the only absolute
[56:01] guarantee that I know of Amen is the
[56:03] revealed word of God that has been
[56:06] brought to us through a Vindicated
[56:08] Prophet amen It Was Written in the Bible
[56:10] brother messages didn't come from a
[56:12] school amen it came from the Bible it
[56:15] was written in the Bible amen but then a
[56:18] prophet be to interpret it amen and the
[56:20] written word became the manifested word
[56:23] and now today the word made flesh amen
[56:26] is the manifestation of the word of God
[56:29] that's why Paul would say are Epistles
[56:32] written in our hearts you are known and
[56:34] read of all men for as much as you're
[56:36] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[56:38] Christ ministered by us amen written not
[56:41] with thinkk amen but with the spirit of
[56:43] the Living God Amen not in the tables of
[56:46] stone but in the fleshly tables of the
[56:49] heart Paul would again say in Hebrews
[56:51] 8:10 he says I will put my laws into
[56:54] their mind amen and I will will write
[56:56] them in their heart amen so God has
[56:59] chosen a covenant people in the last
[57:01] days amen who will not be a billboard
[57:04] for denomination they will not be an
[57:06] advertisement for some religious idea
[57:09] amen but they will be a people who will
[57:11] be underneath a covenant and by that
[57:14] Covenant They will receive amen the
[57:16] engrafted word which is able to save
[57:18] their soul he said therefore the man's
[57:21] spirit is Blended out amen and God comes
[57:23] in and takes over he said then they got
[57:26] Fellowship one with another and the Very
[57:28] God that created the heavens and the
[57:30] Earth that wrote his word amen is
[57:33] dwelling in you and you'll believe
[57:35] everything God wrote is the truth and
[57:38] you will accept it you will believe it
[57:40] you will hold on to it amen and you will
[57:43] have fellowship with it amen so this is
[57:45] more amen than just writings this is
[57:47] more than just Scrolls amen but this is
[57:50] inspiration because the Bible says that
[57:52] all
[57:54] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[57:57] it is profitable for Doctrine for Repro
[57:59] for correction for instruction and
[58:01] righteousness said many of the prophets
[58:03] in writing amen they did not know what
[58:05] they were writing amen they just wrote
[58:08] it down amen because it was inspiration
[58:11] see what they were doing amen is they
[58:13] were writing prophecy amen of the coming
[58:16] Messiah amen which was the one that job
[58:19] saw 4,000 years ahead of time who would
[58:22] who would bridge the gap between a holy
[58:25] God and a handful man listen the Bible
[58:27] says in John 5:46 Jesus standing there
[58:31] he said for had you believed Moses amen
[58:33] you would believe me now watch what he
[58:35] says amen for he wrote Of Me amen look
[58:39] at this word wrote it means to describe
[58:41] it means to write to commit to writing
[58:44] amen it is things amen that are not to
[58:46] be forgotten it means to write down to
[58:49] record it is used of those things which
[58:51] stand written in the sacred books of the
[58:54] Old Testament now you know the Bible is
[58:56] broken down in two parts amen the Old
[58:58] Testament amen and the New Testament if
[59:01] I can just give it to you real simple
[59:02] the Old Testament said he's coming he's
[59:05] coming he's coming and when he comes
[59:07] he'll do this when hears he'll do this
[59:09] but in the New Testament it was no
[59:11] longer saying he's coming amen it was
[59:14] now saying he was here that's why on
[59:16] tape you'll hear Brother brand reading
[59:17] Old Testament scripture and he would say
[59:19] now I'd like to back this up amen with
[59:22] the Fulfillment see because it was not
[59:24] just coming to stay in letter form it
[59:27] was coming to move into fresh form
[59:29] listen then Jesus looks at him and he
[59:32] says but if you believe not his writings
[59:34] amen then how shall you believe my words
[59:37] see Jesus was the
[59:39] manifestation amen of the words the prop
[59:42] of God said this baby down there amen an
[59:44] illegitimate birth in a cow stable amen
[59:47] how could that be this guy didn't go to
[59:49] any school he had no credentials he had
[59:51] no Fellowship card he didn't belong to
[59:53] an organization they didn't know
[59:55] anything about about him how could this
[59:57] be anything amen but it was see they
[1:00:00] failed to see it and he said the works
[1:00:02] that I do amen they testify of me what
[1:00:05] did he say go search the scriptures amen
[1:00:08] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:00:10] life and they are they that testify amen
[1:00:14] they tell you who I am he said they are
[1:00:17] my testimony amen so the scriptures amen
[1:00:20] were the testimony of Jesus Christ he
[1:00:23] said if thou don't if you don't believe
[1:00:24] me then believe The Works that I do they
[1:00:27] tell you who I am they said well we have
[1:00:29] Moses and we're going to believe Moses
[1:00:31] he said if you believe Moses amen then
[1:00:34] you would believe me amen because he
[1:00:36] wrote Of Me In other words you're going
[1:00:39] back and reading things amen that were
[1:00:41] recorded that were not to be forgotten
[1:00:44] amen but you're trying to hold on to the
[1:00:46] writings instead of walking into the
[1:00:48] Perfection or the Fulfillment of what he
[1:00:50] was writing about listen the part of God
[1:00:52] said see amen they were so dark and
[1:00:56] still they couldn't see it he said I
[1:00:58] wonder if that could repeat he said it's
[1:01:01] prophesied to you know it was prophet it
[1:01:03] was prophesied to there you say when in
[1:01:06] this day so in this day the people are
[1:01:09] going to be dark again and they're going
[1:01:11] to miss the Fulfillment of the writings
[1:01:14] of the word of God let me say it as
[1:01:15] plain as I know how amen Jesus was the
[1:01:19] scriptural light of the
[1:01:21] day the prophet of God said Jesus was
[1:01:23] all the inspired prophets Tes tonies all
[1:01:27] their prophecy amen was brought to light
[1:01:29] in his age that had been prophesied for
[1:01:32] his age he said he lit up every candle
[1:01:35] of word amen that was in the Bible and
[1:01:38] that was prophesied of him he said see a
[1:01:40] virgin shall conceive and she did he
[1:01:43] said his name Shall be Called counselor
[1:01:45] Prince of Peace the Mighty God the
[1:01:47] Everlasting father and he was he said
[1:01:50] now watch and the eyes of the blind
[1:01:52] shall see amen and they did see notice
[1:01:56] everything that was prophesied of him
[1:01:58] amen it happened when he came on the
[1:02:01] earth and everything he done could be
[1:02:03] found Amen in Jeremiah or in Zachariah
[1:02:07] amen or in Ezekiel or in Daniel Amen or
[1:02:10] In Jonah listen friends we are not
[1:02:12] following something that we pulled up
[1:02:14] out of the air we're not following some
[1:02:16] PP dream or some idea we are following a
[1:02:18] scriptural Vindicated word and it has
[1:02:21] the power Amen to lead us from the
[1:02:23] confusion of the age that we're living
[1:02:25] in into the reality of the resurrection
[1:02:28] of Jesus Christ I do not believe we have
[1:02:30] to back up off of the word of God Amen
[1:02:33] to get a victory in our life we don't
[1:02:35] have to back off of the promises of God
[1:02:38] Amen to get a holy ghost feeling there
[1:02:40] is a word and it is a powerful word it
[1:02:43] just needs somebody to recognize it's
[1:02:46] more than a writing it has become
[1:02:49] flesh now look here the scripture amen
[1:02:52] they cannot be broken in other words
[1:02:54] they must somebody say they must
[1:02:56] the scriptures must be fulfilled that's
[1:03:00] why Jesus stood there and he said Heaven
[1:03:02] and Earth shall pass away he said but my
[1:03:05] words amen they shall not pass away but
[1:03:09] said God's word is so real and that's
[1:03:11] just enough scripture right there Amen
[1:03:13] to take all the communism out of the
[1:03:15] world and convert the entire world it is
[1:03:18] an invitation Amen to Salvation it is
[1:03:21] also an invitation to Healing it is the
[1:03:24] guarantee amen of eternal life amen the
[1:03:27] scriptures are the guarantee of eternal
[1:03:31] life if you want to know whether you got
[1:03:33] eternal life or not amen don't go to
[1:03:35] some preacher amen don't go to some
[1:03:37] church amen don't go to some idea amen
[1:03:40] go to the scriptures amen and find out
[1:03:43] if the scripture Bears record with the
[1:03:45] spirit that's on the inside of your soul
[1:03:47] said see oh it means so much if it be
[1:03:51] received Amen in the light that it's
[1:03:53] wrote in so when you receive the
[1:03:56] scripture in the light it was wrote in
[1:03:58] it has more of a meaning now let me say
[1:04:01] this eternal life amen it's not a
[1:04:03] feeling amen it's not a sensation it's
[1:04:06] not an emotion amen but eternal life is
[1:04:09] a guarantee amen it's a guarantee to the
[1:04:12] believer what is it it's a written
[1:04:14] Divine promise and you can read it
[1:04:16] brother John right there brother John
[1:04:18] Amen in first John amen you can read the
[1:04:21] promise he said let therefore abide in
[1:04:23] you which you have heard from the
[1:04:25] beginning if that which you heard from
[1:04:27] the beginning shall remain in you you
[1:04:30] also shall continue in the son and in
[1:04:32] the father and this is the promise that
[1:04:35] he has promised us amen even eternal
[1:04:38] life listen this message of the hour
[1:04:41] amen has restored the Bible promise of
[1:04:44] eternal life amen back to the church
[1:04:47] when the world is trying to find a way
[1:04:49] Amen to live forever they're trying to
[1:04:51] find a way to escape their problems amen
[1:04:54] denomination has so watered down and
[1:04:56] diluted amen the reality of eternal life
[1:04:59] but in the evening time it shall be
[1:05:02] light there would be a prophet who would
[1:05:04] return to the church and he would go in
[1:05:06] the scripture and he would find a
[1:05:08] promise and say listen we're thankful to
[1:05:11] be alive and to have this great
[1:05:15] revelation of eternal life dwelling
[1:05:18] within us see we've come tonight father
[1:05:21] Amen to study that word together he said
[1:05:23] these great Hidden Mysteries that's been
[1:05:25] hid since the foundation of the world
[1:05:28] and the lamb is the only one that can
[1:05:31] reveal it to us he said so I pray that
[1:05:34] he will come among us tonight and will
[1:05:36] take a hold of his word and will reveal
[1:05:39] it to us that we might know how to be
[1:05:42] better servants to him in this end time
[1:05:45] so in other words the one who wrote the
[1:05:47] book oh Church the one who wrote the
[1:05:50] promises the one who described them and
[1:05:53] the one who had men to write about them
[1:05:55] Amen in the last days listen he didn't
[1:05:58] send amen Jeremiah to brandom Tabernacle
[1:06:01] to reveal the Mysteries he did not send
[1:06:04] Isaiah Amen to reveal the Mysteries but
[1:06:07] the lamb came down himself and begin to
[1:06:10] reveal amen the word and the secret that
[1:06:13] was in the word of God listen friends I
[1:06:15] say tonight amen the same lamb amen that
[1:06:18] is in the Book of Revelation amen the
[1:06:20] Lamb of God is right here in this
[1:06:23] building tonight in the form of a word

[1:06:33] country you are the kingdom delegat you
[1:06:36] have come from God and you got to go
[1:06:38] back to God and there's a word to carry
[1:06:40] you to where you got to

[1:06:45] now I'll say this the promises or
[1:06:48] written guarantees to the believer now

[1:06:52] I'm just thankful for one tonight I want
[1:06:54] to speak to you for a few moment on Amen
[1:06:56] is the promise of Light how many can
[1:06:59] thank God for the promise of light in
[1:07:02] Zechariah 14 in verse 6 the Bible says
[1:07:04] it's a prophecy it shall come to pass in
[1:07:07] that day that the light shall not be
[1:07:10] clear nor dark amen but it shall be one
[1:07:13] day which shall be known to the Lord not
[1:07:16] day nor night but it shall come to pass
[1:07:19] that at the evening time it shall be
[1:07:23] light amen at the evening time it shall
[1:07:26] be light how many's heard that scripture
[1:07:29] at the evening time it shall be light
[1:07:32] brother said the evening light promised
[1:07:34] amen by the prophet of God in Zechariah
[1:07:37] 14:7 May again open the true believer's
[1:07:40] eyes to the events that's taking place
[1:07:43] today amen that's proved by the
[1:07:45] prophecies that we're at the end time
[1:07:48] amen Jesus is coming he said the prophet
[1:07:51] of God said it shall be light again
[1:07:53] about the evening time the sun s o n
[1:07:56] will peep out again it shall be light he
[1:07:59] said what the same son s so n that was
[1:08:03] revealed in flesh at the morning time
[1:08:06] back there amen will be revealed again
[1:08:10] in the evening time listen friends it's
[1:08:12] the same sign the only difference is the
[1:08:15] flesh that is revealing itself through
[1:08:17] in the morning time he revealed himself
[1:08:20] to the Flesh of Jesus but in the evening
[1:08:22] time he's going to reveal himself a into
[1:08:25] the Flesh of the Bride of Jesus listen
[1:08:28] you're not just a bunch of church
[1:08:29] members you are the flesh that has been
[1:08:32] redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:35] you have been put in position by the
[1:08:37] word of God to see the promises
[1:08:39] fulfilled not in Paul's day not in
[1:08:42] Moses's day not even in brother
[1:08:44] brandom's day but right here in your day
[1:08:47] the light has a shined again yes
[1:08:51] Hallelujah the evening light is
[1:08:54] Revealing Light now can I I say this
[1:08:56] it's also prophetic
[1:08:57] light according to Isaiah 60:1 you love
[1:09:01] your Bibles let's read a minute Isaiah 6
[1:09:03] verse1 he says arise and shine amen if
[1:09:07] you got your Bible there in a PIN handy
[1:09:09] underline these next words for thy light
[1:09:11] is come not in anybody's light but arise
[1:09:16] and shine for thy light is come and the
[1:09:19] glory of the Lord is Arisen upon thee he
[1:09:23] says now for Behold The Darkness shall
[1:09:25] cover the Earth and gross Darkness to
[1:09:28] people but the Lord shall arise upon
[1:09:31] thee and His glory shall be seen upon
[1:09:34] thee brother comes along in Shalom he
[1:09:37] says now good morning and that means
[1:09:39] peace he said darkness is gathering amen
[1:09:42] but what's it gathering for to show the
[1:09:45] light so when you see Darkness Gathering
[1:09:49] it's gathering for one purpose to show
[1:09:51] the light see Isaiah 60 said that he
[1:09:53] said that's the reason I can say shalom
[1:09:57] the light has come to you oh God hey the
[1:10:00] light has come to you he said God's
[1:10:03] peace to the elected woman to the
[1:10:05] elected lady those who God before the
[1:10:08] foundation of the world Amen called out
[1:10:11] and ordained to that now watch verse
[1:10:14] three amen and the Gentiles amen shall
[1:10:17] come to thy light so the Bible says thy
[1:10:20] light is come amen which is us our light
[1:10:23] is come but now watch it says and the
[1:10:26] Gentiles shall come to the light so
[1:10:28] brother Joel it doesn't say Amen that
[1:10:31] the light shall come to the Gentiles
[1:10:33] amen but the light is going to pull the
[1:10:36] Gentiles said what is it amen the light
[1:10:38] Vindicated again is God's word so that
[1:10:42] you can see God manifested in his
[1:10:44] promise of the light of the day or the
[1:10:46] word given to this age the promises
[1:10:49] that's made for this day the promises
[1:10:52] that was said by the prophets and by
[1:10:54] Jesus and self Amen in this day see
[1:10:58] notice Hebrews 1 God in sunnd times
[1:11:00] divers manners amen spake to their
[1:11:02] fathers through the prophets but in this
[1:11:05] last day amen through his son Jesus
[1:11:08] Christ let me just go ahead and get this
[1:11:10] out in the open okay amen we're all
[1:11:12] Gentiles all right amen can we all agree
[1:11:16] on that we're all Gentiles I know I know
[1:11:18] people go and it's a big thing right now
[1:11:20] brother Bobby to do your DNA and and
[1:11:22] people come up with all kinds of DNA and
[1:11:24] God bless you but let's just settle it
[1:11:26] right now amen we've seen guys do their
[1:11:28] DNA run off on tangents and amen they
[1:11:31] got 2% Jew and 5% Jew and all of a
[1:11:33] sudden they're Moses and Elijah amen but
[1:11:35] let's come back to the Bible we're
[1:11:38] Gentiles come on we're Gentiles amen and
[1:11:41] without this light we have nothing now
[1:11:43] come on so because we're Gentiles the
[1:11:46] Bible said that this light would come
[1:11:49] but it would not come as a bul it would
[1:11:51] not come amen as just a little something
[1:11:54] but the Bible say Jesus looked at him
[1:11:56] and said I am the light of the world he
[1:11:59] said but he that followeth me amen shall
[1:12:02] not walk Amen in darkness but he shall
[1:12:05] have the light of Life see without light
[1:12:09] amen nothing can live the prophet of God
[1:12:12] said no one could deny that Israel had
[1:12:14] light they were the only people who had
[1:12:17] light as a nation it was as when Egypt
[1:12:19] was so dark that one could feel a me
[1:12:22] they could feel the darkness now listen
[1:12:24] friends that a heavy darkness when you
[1:12:26] can literally feel amen the darkness
[1:12:28] it's one thing Amen to see the darkness
[1:12:31] it's another thing to feel it he said
[1:12:33] see it was in Egypt so dark amen but in
[1:12:36] the homes of the Israelites there was
[1:12:39] light so while the whole land of Egypt
[1:12:42] was covered in darkness and it was such
[1:12:44] a great Darkness it could be felt there
[1:12:46] were some Israelite homes that had some
[1:12:49] light that was shining in there he said
[1:12:52] but now amen True light has come he said
[1:12:55] said the light of the world is Jesus
[1:12:57] Moses and the prophets they brought the
[1:13:00] light amen by the means of the scripture
[1:13:03] amen relevant to the Messiah thus Israel
[1:13:05] had light but now the Fulfillment of the
[1:13:08] light has come and what was but glowing
[1:13:11] word has now broke forth into the
[1:13:14] brightness of God and is manifested
[1:13:17] among his people in other words when
[1:13:20] Moses walked in there and read the
[1:13:22] Scrolls he was bringing light into those
[1:13:25] homes but there was a day that what he
[1:13:27] was reading about was going to become
[1:13:30] flesh and it would not be Moses carrying
[1:13:32] the Scrolls it would be the Fulfillment
[1:13:35] of what Moses was reading about would
[1:13:37] walk into every home it would walk into
[1:13:39] every life oh Church of the Living God I
[1:13:42] say lift up your Gates and welcome the
[1:13:44] true L who is the true L it's none other
[1:13:48] than the Lord Jesus Christ Hall when he
[1:13:51] walks into a life when he walks into a
[1:13:54] home when he walks into a family he
[1:13:57] literally lights up the whole entire
[1:13:59] thing sir amen watch the part of God
[1:14:02] said as the pillar of fire gave light at
[1:14:04] night and that was wonderful he said but
[1:14:07] now light and life were
[1:14:11] manifested in the fullness of the
[1:14:13] godhead bodily when the light of life is
[1:14:16] shining he says to bring that seed what
[1:14:18] could it do upon on a rock it'll do
[1:14:20] nothing what could it do upon dead
[1:14:22] substance it's not sent for dead
[1:14:24] substance The Sun Shines for a seed that
[1:14:27] is gerti to life and this Bible and his
[1:14:31] word oh God in the hour that we're
[1:14:34] living in brother Joe is shining upon
[1:14:37] those to catch the eternal life those
[1:14:41] who are predestinated to see it listen
[1:14:44] friends we are not walking around amen
[1:14:46] stumbling in darkness but there was a
[1:14:49] seed in your soul from before the
[1:14:52] foundation from before the foundation of
[1:14:55] the world Brother David there was a seed
[1:14:57] there that when light would come that
[1:15:00] seed was already eternal
[1:15:02] life now watch what a pro God said and
[1:15:05] it won't do one bit of good upon the
[1:15:07] rest them there's no life in there to
[1:15:08] come forth by the Sun or by the light
[1:15:11] now I say this this light has brought a
[1:15:15] resurrection in St Matthew chap 4:1 16
[1:15:18] the Bible says the people which sat Amen
[1:15:21] in the darkness they saw a great light
[1:15:24] and to them which sat in the region and
[1:15:28] the shadow of death amen light is sprung
[1:15:30] up I want you to catch this the people
[1:15:33] are sitting but when light comes light
[1:15:36] doesn't come in the same position
[1:15:38] they're
[1:15:39] in they are sitting in darkness but when
[1:15:42] the light comes the light Springs up now
[1:15:45] do you realize that that's a prophecy
[1:15:47] from Isaiah 9 and2 let's read it Isaiah
[1:15:49] 9 and2 it says the people amen that
[1:15:52] walked in darkness have seen a great
[1:15:55] light now listen here and they that
[1:15:57] dwell in the land of the shadow of death
[1:16:01] upon them have a light shine so now it's
[1:16:05] not just sitting in the shadow or the
[1:16:08] regions of the shadow of death amen but
[1:16:11] now the whole land is underneath the
[1:16:13] shadow of death and I say this to you
[1:16:15] friends we are living in a world that
[1:16:18] you cannot go anywhere without seeing
[1:16:20] the shadow amen of Darkness upon it you
[1:16:23] go to the White House and there's a
[1:16:25] shadow of Darkness there you go to the
[1:16:27] church house and there's a shadow of
[1:16:29] Darkness there you go to the Vatican
[1:16:31] there's a shadow of Darkness there you
[1:16:33] go to the Educational Systems there's a
[1:16:35] shadow of Darkness there go to Wall
[1:16:38] Street come on Church go wherever you
[1:16:40] want to and the land you're living in is
[1:16:43] covered in death it's covered in a
[1:16:45] shadow but the prophet of God said this
[1:16:47] he said but Matthew 4 said he would
[1:16:49] bring light to the Gentiles who were
[1:16:52] possessed and they were condemned by God
[1:16:55] in their Idols but he come as a
[1:16:59] light God the Gentiles were possessed
[1:17:03] they were possessed by idols and they
[1:17:05] were condemned by Idols but what did he
[1:17:07] say he said today the light of God is
[1:17:10] the word of God made manifest he said
[1:17:13] that's the light made
[1:17:16] manifest the light is the works of God
[1:17:19] Amen spoken by the word of God brought
[1:17:23] to life now listen and if a greater
[1:17:25] light than it was at the dawn of
[1:17:29] creation Now think about that amen the
[1:17:32] Bible says in Psalms 23:4 he says yay
[1:17:35] though I walk are you hearing me amen
[1:17:38] yay though I walk through the valley of
[1:17:41] the shadow of death he says I will fear
[1:17:44] no evil how many can say Amen to that
[1:17:47] for thou art with me thy rod and thy

[1:18:10] percent of light or it would make a
[1:18:12] Shadow so if I oh God so if in death
[1:18:16] itself is just a shadow in other words

[1:21:34] Le outa well just remember Shadrach
[1:21:37] mesach and abedo the Bible says they
[1:21:39] went up in the fiery furnace and a
[1:21:41] prophet said but there's a man there who
[1:21:44] can turn on the air well there's a man
[1:21:48] who can turn on the light and there's a
[1:21:50] man who can turn on the air in other
[1:21:55] words the rushing Mighty Wind that come
[1:21:57] down on the day of Pentecost he turned
[1:22:00] it on again and F all the
[1:22:03] breeze Church of the Living God there
[1:22:06] was a man there he's called The Fourth
[1:22:09] Man there is one today he's the only one
[1:22:12] he's got the light switch in his hand
[1:22:14] those who sat in the regions of the
[1:22:16] shadow of death great light sprung
[1:22:20] up now watch you Prophet don't reject it
[1:22:24] receive it in the name of the Lord watch
[1:22:27] a prophet he that hath an ear let him
[1:22:28] hear what the spirit is saying in the
[1:22:30] churches how tragic it is that the first
[1:22:33] age did not listen to the spirit but
[1:22:36] instead it listened to man but thank God
[1:22:39] in these last age there will be a group
[1:22:41] rise up the true bride of Christ and she
[1:22:45] will listen to the spirit and in that
[1:22:47] day of gross darkness in that day of
[1:22:51] gross Darkness there will oh God
[1:22:55] amen light will return in the day of
[1:22:59] gross Darkness light will return by the
[1:23:02] pure word and we will return to the
[1:23:05] power of Pentecost to welcome back our
[1:23:09] Lord Jesus Christ but it's always though
[1:23:12] when light comes amen people love
[1:23:16] Darkness more than they love light in St
[1:23:19] John 3:19 this is the condemnation look
[1:23:22] at this word condemnation it's a
[1:23:24] separating it's a sundering it's a trial
[1:23:27] or a contest so we can say this is the
[1:23:30] trial this is the contest that light has
[1:23:33] come into the world and Men love
[1:23:35] Darkness rather than light because their
[1:23:38] deeds were evil now watch this for
[1:23:41] everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[1:23:43] light neither cometh to the light lest
[1:23:45] his deeds should be reproved but he that
[1:23:48] doeth truth cometh to the light that his
[1:23:51] deeds may be made manifest that they are
[1:23:54] wal in God so in other words the devil
[1:23:57] now I'm going to preach for a second
[1:23:59] because the devil tells every one of us
[1:24:01] we are condemned he tells us we've gone
[1:24:03] too far we've made too many mistakes
[1:24:06] we've done too many things wrong and we
[1:24:08] are condemned and the devil stops many
[1:24:10] people from even coming to church amen
[1:24:12] by just telling them amen you're
[1:24:14] condemned so there's no need to go but
[1:24:16] let me just go ahead and say this
[1:24:17] tonight amen you didn't come Amen to a
[1:24:19] Wednesday night movie
[1:24:22] night come on you didn't come to pop not
[1:24:24] down the church house you didn't come to
[1:24:26] a to to a social Gathering you come to
[1:24:29] the house of God listen you came here
[1:24:31] tonight knowing that the word of God was
[1:24:33] going to be preached and you know that
[1:24:36] word is a sword and it's sharper and
[1:24:38] more powerful than any two-edged sword
[1:24:41] you know you come here knowing that God
[1:24:43] knows everything about you the preacher
[1:24:46] knows nothing but when that word begins
[1:24:48] to move that word has the ability Amen
[1:24:51] to separate you from the confusion and
[1:24:54] bring you into the peace it has the
[1:24:56] ability to separate you from the sin and
[1:24:59] bring you into the righteousness of God
[1:25:01] let me say this if anybody's condemned
[1:25:03] it's not you for coming to church it's
[1:25:06] the devil that tried to stop
[1:25:10] you come on church are y'all hearing me
[1:25:13] you come here tonight knowing the word
[1:25:14] of God has the ability to expose
[1:25:16] everything about our
[1:25:18] lives come on either we believe it or we
[1:25:20] don't you come here tonight knowing the
[1:25:22] word of God Amen has has the ability
[1:25:25] Amen to reveal things amen nobody knows
[1:25:28] about nothing and the preacher gets up
[1:25:29] preaching he don't know nothing and all
[1:25:31] of a sudden the word of God begins to
[1:25:33] speak right direct to you what is that
[1:25:35] that's the word that's the
[1:25:37] light that's the light and it has the
[1:25:40] ability Amen to condemn the wrong let me
[1:25:43] say this the son is the king of all
[1:25:46] lights on this Earth in the natural
[1:25:48] light he said no matter how much
[1:25:49] artificial L that we can have how many
[1:25:52] great electric Rays we can produce when
[1:25:54] that sun rises all the rest of them di
[1:25:57] out he said that's the same thing it is
[1:25:59] with the word of God when the word of
[1:26:01] God Rises all superstitions
[1:26:04] denominational fanaticisms and things
[1:26:06] spread away and it shows just exactly
[1:26:09] what it is he said the word of God made
[1:26:12] manifest it always separates amen the
[1:26:16] light from the darkness he said his word
[1:26:20] is superior over all man's words over
[1:26:23] all anything thing his word is light so
[1:26:27] when light comes it's going to expose
[1:26:30] the evil and reveal the truth Church of

[1:26:39] going to reveal you amen but it's time
[1:26:41] to look that devil in the face and
[1:26:43] remind him who you are you are a gentile
[1:26:47] who was saved by the grace of Jesus
[1:26:49] Christ and have been pulled into the
[1:26:52] light of Jesus Christ and the word
[1:26:54] you're walking underneath it's not a
[1:26:56] church light it's not a man-made light
[1:26:59] it's not an artificial light it's a word
[1:27:01] light it's a messiah light it's a
[1:27:04] Revealing Light and it has the ability
[1:27:07] Amen to uncover everything let me say
[1:27:09] this I challenge you like the prophet of
[1:27:11] God said he said light is so much more
[1:27:15] powerful it just puts the darkness
[1:27:19] out when the light begins to shine it
[1:27:22] just puts the darkness out

[1:32:06] way and by night in a pillar of fire to
[1:32:09] give them light to go by day and night
[1:32:11] listen he took not away the pillar of
[1:32:13] cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by
[1:32:17] night from before the people brother
[1:32:19] said God is light we know that Pillar of
[1:32:22] Fire can I say this to you original
[1:32:25] light is not what you see harnessed in
[1:32:26] these light bulbs that's right can I say
[1:32:29] what that is that's artificial light
[1:32:32] original light is the sun it's the fire
[1:32:36] of God oh church he said then Joseph and
[1:32:39] all them wrote went on everyone wrote
[1:32:41] back in that day but when Moses came on
[1:32:43] the scene he had the Revelation he had
[1:32:46] met the pillar of fire he said the
[1:32:49] disciples just wrote What They Se him do
[1:32:51] but Moses had the Revelation so he went
[1:32:53] down into Egypt for three years and
[1:32:55] studied and seen that the god of the Old
[1:32:58] Testament was the Jesus of the new the
[1:33:00] Revelation and he come out and said
[1:33:02] think of it the same Pillar of Fire that
[1:33:05] came upon those men that wrote the Bible
[1:33:08] is the same Pillar of Fire that is here
[1:33:10] today interpreting the Bible so there is
[1:33:13] a rri to the Bible but then brother
[1:33:15] Morgan there is an interpreting may I
[1:33:17] say to you tonight brother Bobby we are

[1:33:27] for that same what a comfort what an
[1:33:29] identification I'm so glad to be
[1:33:31] identified in that I don't know what to
[1:33:33] do I'd rather be identified in that than
[1:33:35] all the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian
[1:33:37] Lutheran all the rest of them identified
[1:33:40] in that word where the Shak glory and
[1:33:43] the Revelation
[1:33:45] lays my the pillar of fire appearing inv
[1:33:48] visibly Among Us identifying the
[1:33:50] messages right like he did on Mount Si
[1:33:53] oh this last day to see that same Pillar
[1:33:56] of Fire right Among Us speaking the same
[1:33:59] word not only that but interpret it by

[1:34:04] the
[1:34:05] truth somebody shout back at me it's the
[1:34:08] truth the message is The Truth Listen
[1:34:12] notice the same P ofier that sent Moses
[1:34:15] and to Paul that wrote the Bible is now
[1:34:18] sent to reveal
[1:34:22] it come on Grace Tabernacle let's just
[1:34:25] say what a prophet said that's the grace
[1:34:27] of God that's the unchanging God
[1:34:30] fulfilling his promises of Matthew 28
[1:34:33] Lord I'm with you always fulfill in John
[1:34:36] 14:12 the works I do you do also fulfill
[1:34:39] in Luke 1730 in the days when the son of
[1:34:41] man will be revealed see Malachi 4
[1:34:44] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:34:46] that will restore the faith of the
[1:34:49] people amen back to the original word
[1:34:53] what are you saying preacher I'm saying
[1:34:54] get your eyes off of a man and get your
[1:34:57] eyes on the Revelation and where the sh
[1:35:00] Glory lays come on you know why you're
[1:35:02] here on a Wednesday night is because
[1:35:04] you've gone beyond the outer Court
[1:35:06] you've gone beyond the inner Court
[1:35:08] you've gone into the holies of holies
[1:35:11] where the Shak glory is come on Church
[1:35:14] you all know the outer Court was
[1:35:15] controlled let me just slow down and say
[1:35:17] it to you like this the outer Court was
[1:35:19] controlled by the natural
[1:35:21] light so if the sun was and then God was
[1:35:25] blessing if there was no clouds in the
[1:35:27] sky brother Carter everything was okay
[1:35:30] but if you moved in the inner Court it
[1:35:32] was controlled by manl light because the
[1:35:34] priest had to light the candle to make
[1:35:37] sure there was light in there so in
[1:35:38] other words if you showed up in your
[1:35:40] favorite preacher wasn't
[1:35:42] preaching you didn't get your light lit
[1:35:44] you ready to go home but if you move
[1:35:47] over into the holies of holies if you
[1:35:50] move Bey on the beyond the outside light
[1:35:52] and you move be on the manl and you move
[1:35:55] over into the Eternal line it don't
[1:35:57] matter what's happening in the outer
[1:35:58] Court it don't matter if your favorite
[1:36:00] preacher here or not if the Shak glory
[1:36:03] is shining then there's a Revival in

[1:55:23] Lord as your Prophet said it come in the
[1:55:24] evening time and they've used it to try
[1:55:27] to condemn and tear down father I've
[1:55:30] seen it before Lord many a few years ago
[1:55:32] a sister there in North Carolina Lord
[1:55:35] served you for many many years but years
[1:55:38] ago Lord someone used some quotes and
[1:55:41] scriptures and really put her under a

[2:04:58] at once you know that's what that's what
[2:05:00] the Bible said he said my word will be a
[2:05:01] light unto thy feet and a lamp unto thy
[2:05:04] path a lamp unto thy feet you know
[2:05:07] sometimes it don't show a far off
[2:05:10] brother Jared sometimes it ain't it
[2:05:12] ain't five years down the road and
[2:05:13] that's what we want because we're a
[2:05:15] we're a busy people we want everything
[2:05:17] to be shown to us all at once but
[2:05:19] sometimes God just shows you a next step
[2:05:21] to take you remember the story of the
[2:05:23] old man that was trying to go home and
[2:05:26] the GU came out of the meeting and they
[2:05:27] asked him where he live he said I live
[2:05:29] just over the hill he said well how he
[2:05:31] said well well where you can't see your
[2:05:33] house he said no I can't see it from
[2:05:34] here remember he was challenging the the
[2:05:36] preaching well I just don't know if I
[2:05:38] can believe that I I don't know if I can
[2:05:40] accept that he said you know Jesus is a
[2:05:41] lie to us he said well I can't believe
[2:05:43] in heaven cuz I can't see it you know
[2:05:44] it's something that's just so far off
[2:05:46] it's hard for me to grasp it he said
[2:05:48] well do you live here he said I live
[2:05:50] over the hill he said can you see your
[2:05:51] house from here well no I can't see it
[2:05:53] you got to go through those woods and
[2:05:55] over a couple Hills before you can
[2:05:57] actually see it he said but I believe
[2:05:59] you you say it's there he said he said
[2:06:01] well if you can't see your house well
[2:06:02] how can you ever find it he said well I
[2:06:04] have a lamp he said well if you hold
[2:06:06] that lamp up real bright can you see the
[2:06:08] house with the lamp well no I can't see
[2:06:10] it he said well what do you see with the
[2:06:12] lamp he said it just shows me the path
[2:06:14] in front of me he said every step that I
[2:06:16] take is illuminated by the lamp that I
[2:06:19] have in my hand isn't that the way it is
[2:06:21] with serving God you may not see the end
[2:06:23] of the road you may not see the the big
[2:06:25] picture always but brother Jared I
