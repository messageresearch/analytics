[music] &gt;&gt; And he's a God of our future. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful? What a mighty God we serve this morning. &gt;&gt; I was thinking about that. He's sanging that song and brother Ram was telling a time where he got a telegram from brother Bossworth and he asked the telegram people said how when did they send this? He said 24 hours ago and the angel of the Lord met him out there 24 hours before the telegram ever got to him to pray for brother Bosworth. By the time brother Bosworth got the telegram or brother Brandham got the telegram. Brother Bossworth was already healed by the prayer that brother Brandham already gave. That's a mighty God we serve this morning. He's he's a God of our past. He's a God of our present. He's a God of our future. Oh, hallelujah. And I believe he's very mindful of each and every one of our needs this morning. I like to take a few things to the Lord in prayer this morning. Just remember brother David Gates. I spoke to him this morning on the phone and and um he's uh he was able to talk this morning and and [music] he's on some meds and stuff taking care of the pain. But just remember him in prayer. He asked the church body to remember him and he's he's gone through a lot of tests or hoping that the [music] that the infection ain't too much in his blood to to be sepsis. So just remember that and [music] uh he's a soldier. He's a good brother. He can have it our praise. I I couldn't help but thinking, brother Brian, that my the prayers is already going up for brother David is pushing back the line of infection as we speak. And I'm just ready to hear the testimony from him. Remember my sister, she's still in the hospital this [music] morning. McKenzie, just remember the family there. And uh also remember Xavier and Sister Jordan and the baby there. They're still down there hoping to be able to come home in a few days. Just [music] remember that sweet family in your prayer. And also it says please pray for Scott Treadway. Just [music] been told he has heart failure. We believe God can intercede in that prayer request. Also just remember him. Also prayer request for sister. So [music] we just remember that and any other needs we may have this morning. God knows every one of your needs. Can we just pray this morning? Lord Jesus God, it's just more than a song. is more than words, Lord God. But you're a mighty God this morning, Lord. And we come to worship you, not only in spirit, but in truth, Father. Lord, Lord, you said, "Ask and you shall receive, Lord. We're asking for all these requests, Lord, for our precious brother down in the hospital, Lord. We pray Lord God that you the the the mighty hand of Jehovah would go into that room Lord God and begin to turn the situation around Lord God. We know you're more than able Lord Lord God you're the one that created the heart Lord God and you're more than able intercede in Scott Treadway's [music] situation. Lord God we pray Lord God that you'd be his everpresent help in a time of trouble. Father, Lord, we pray for every request, Lord. Brother Xavier, Sister Jordan, and the baby. Lord, we just pray that you'd be there, Lord, to energize them and comfort them, strengthen them, Lord God. Lord, my sister still sitting in a hospital [music] two weeks later. Lord God, we pray, Lord God, that you'd strengthen her, Lord. Strengthen the family, Lord. We take these petitions to your throne of mercy and grace this morning, Lord, believing you're already working in their future, Lord. Lord, help this, each and every one of us that raised our hands this morning, Lord, that you'd intercede in their behalf, as we begin to turn this service into the most important part, Lord, the coming forth of your word, Lord. We pray Lord God that you'd just step the man out of aside Lord Lord and and operate that gift Lord that you placed in this man's life Lord God to be a pastor Grace tabernacle Lord we pray Lord God you give him words of eternal life Lord to speak to your precious bride this morning in Jesus Christ wonderful name. Can the bride say amen? Can the bride say praise the Lord? Come away my love. Come away [singing] my love. Come away, my love. Oh, I've waited for this day to give you your [singing] new name. Eternity awaits us. Come away, my love. There's [music] a table dressed in [singing] linen. The banquet is prepared. A host of angels gathered for the celebration. There [singing] the bride is almost [music] ready in spotless [singing] ride array. A hush falls over heaven as a groom begins [singing and music] to say, "Come away [singing] my love. Come away my love. Oh, I've waited [music] for this day. Oh, I can give you [singing] your new name. Eternity awaits [music] us. Come away. Oh, I like this last verse. Oh, I've loved you [singing] from creation [music] long before you came to me. Oh, I carried that love with me all the way to Calary. And though it [singing] wasn't over when they laid me in the tomb. Oh, I proved my love would never die. I rose again for you. Come away as our pastor would come this morning. Oh, can you lift your hands to him? Have you heard him scream this from heaven? Oh, hallelujah. Oh, I've waited for this day. Oh, I can give you your new name. Eternity [singing] [music] away from my love. Oh, come away. My love, come away, my love. I've waited for this day when I could give you your new name. [singing] Eternity [music] awaits us. Come away, my love. You're worthy of it all. Yes, [music] you're worthy of it all. Oh, from [singing] you are all things. To you are all things and you [singing and music] deserve the glory. You're [singing] worthy of it all. Yes, you're worthy of it all. Oh, [singing] for from you are all [music] things. To you are all things [music] and you deserve the glory. [singing] How many can say that this morning? Yes, Lord. You're worthy of it all. I just want you to know, Lord, how much you mean to me this morning. [music] You're worthy [singing] of it all. All my praise, [music] for from you [singing] are all things, and to you are all things. You deserve all the glory. [singing] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning? How many say he's worthy of all my praise and all the effort that I that I have and my if God never done anything else for me from this day on I could spend my life and I'd never make it up to him what he's already done. Isn't that right? I'd spend my life serving him. I can never do enough for the Lord. Amen. To to repay. I just thank God. Therefore, it's not based on our efforts and it's not based on our work. There's not enough praise that we could do that would that would make us worthy of what God has done for us. There's not enough work we could put in. There's not enough money you could give. Not enough time that you could devote to be worthy of what God has done for us. But we certainly want to give him our all this morning. Amen. How many loves the Lord? Amen. Certainly good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. And I just say it's a privilege uh to be able to stand before you uh another service to be able to speak the words of life. Amen. To take a scripture out of this Bible, this written word that has so changed my life. Amen. I count it a privilege to be able to take these words and to speak them over a congregation of people, whether there be two or 2,000. I know they're the words of life. Amen. And and it doesn't take um just a moment in the presence of God. And the right word at the right time can change anybody's situation. So we just we [music] just give ourselves to the Lord this morning. And as a speaker, I want to surrender myself to God. As a hearer, I would encourage you just to surrender to the Lord and ask God to speak to your heart. I know God is certainly more than able. He's mindful of what we have need of this morning. Maybe we just go before the Lord in a word of prayer before we open the word. And if you have something on your heart, I heard the request that brother Joe read many uh needs this morning, but maybe there's just something special you'd like for the Lord to do and [music] we just want to surrender to him. How many can do that this morning? Won't we just lift our hands to the Lord and say, "Lord, I just surrender to you. I surrender my own thoughts, my feelings, and everything that I have to you this morning and just ask you to take control of this service and [music] and to do your work amongst your children." Let's just approach him in that way. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, how we love you this morning. God, I know, Lord, that we're not worthy. And Lord, in our flesh, Lord, if we would look at each one of us, how unworthy that we feel, Lord, to even to stand in your presence. But Lord, we just thank you this morning for allowing us the opportunity again, Lord, as believers to come and gather around your throne of mercy, Lord, to take the word of of life, Lord, and God, to be able just to speak [music] it. And Lord, knowing that it'll bring life to somebody, Lord, what an encouragement that it is, Lord, that I know that there's nothing that we do for you that is done in vain, but Lord, you've called us to this place for this purpose in this hour. and Lord to speak this word that you've placed on our heart, Lord, this morning. Lord, I just ask you that it would find its resting place. And God, may we put everything else aside just for a few moments, Lord, to allow you the time to be able to speak to our hearts, Lord. And God, may we go from this place, Lord, knowing that every need has been met, every sickness has been healed. And Lord, everyone that would have a a need from you this morning, Lord, they would go from this building satisfied. Lord, we just thank you for all you do. Lord, we ask you to anoint the word of God and bring it to life this morning. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning. We certainly appreciate being in the presence of the Lord this morning. I want to read out of the book of Colossians in the third chapter. And we'll just read uh one portion of scripture. Colossians the third chapter and in the in the first verse. Colossians 3 and one. give you just a moment to get there. And I sure enjoyed that song that young man sang. And Amen. We we certainly have a hope. Amen. And in this hour, amen. And every chain that we have and everything that would have you bound, there's came one that would set you free from it. Amen. The Bible says Colossians 3:1, "If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above where Christ siteth on the right hand of God, and set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God." And I would like to take this as a title this morning as you take your seats on setting your affection on things above. Setting your affection on things above. You know, I I think it's so easy uh to look around at the natural things and to rely on natural things uh that we have in this life. It seems to be what u uh it's constantly before us. You can't go a few moments without being reminded of everything that's going on around you. And uh we're we're constantly uh uh looking at things and and there's uh you know troubled it's just troubled times. It's constant and and uh you know we've been speaking over the past few services even brother Andrew would speak the other brothers minister and it just seems along the same line and uh and speaking on the purpose of the message in this hour and and how that how that God would send in every age a word to lead the church by and uh you know I thought about that. I thought, you know, that any sincere student of the Bible uh would know that God does nothing without a purpose. How many believes that? And and I'll say this, any good student of the Bible knows that God does nothing without a prophet. That's Amos 3 and7. So, uh but but also any sincere student of the message would know that in the meetings where uh the prophet of God would speak, where this message was preached, it was thoroughly vindicated uh to be a supernatural thing. There was supernatural occurrences. there was a the presence of a supernatural being. And uh you know, I think it's quite I want to say funny, but that might not be the word, but it's an odd thing that the world believes in in in in scary spirits and they believe in spooky spirits and they believe in evil spirits and everybody uh uh can build around that and talk around that and fellowship around it. And you know, we just came through Halloween and everybody's about the spooky and things, but isn't it an odd thing that the whole world can believe in evil spirits and spooky spirits, but uh when you go to talking about the Holy Spirit, nobody wants to believe in that. I I thought, but the reality is is there really was a Holy Spirit. And there really is a Holy Spirit. And it was the person of Jesus Christ. In fact, the prophet of God would identify him uh many times in his presence to be the angel of the Lord. Of course, we being students of the Bible, we know that the angel of the Lord would be present in this age. And the reason we know that is because according to the Bible and the signs of the time that we're living in, that we are in the rapture age. How many knows that we're living in the end time? I I know sometimes the older you get and the more you hear it. I know what Satan does. He kind of to push that off like maybe it's for another age, but friends, I'm just going to say it again this morning because I think it's worthy of being reminded that we are living in the rapture age. It might not be today. It might not be tomorrow. It might not be another 50 years, but this is the age of the rapture. This is the ending of time. This is what the Bible had prophesied all through the scriptures to this age that we're living in. And so, uh, we realize that because we're living in the rapture age, that according to Revelations the second and the third chapter, as the God would send a messenger into each age, that because this is the last age, that there would be a message that would come today in this age. And the purpose of it would be to bring life back to the church again. You remember what God's sign was whenever Israel was in their exodus, brother was talking about how the last plague that came to Israel right before their departing out of Egypt, the last plague was death. He said and that's the enemy that's going to strike the church now is death spiritually speaking. Says so those who will not follow Christ and the baptism of the Holy Spirit. They will spiritually dry up and die. But I think something that was so good that that that even though we see that on every hand that before that death ever came to Egypt, brother Mark, there was an atonement that was made for that death. I thought, isn't that isn't that our God? if death was the final plague and death was the final curse that was going to come on them but before death came there came an atonement to them and you know it didn't just show up but it came in a special way there was a there was a certain way that God does things you know I thought you say well well how did it come you remember in the days of Israel that that it was actually in when the judgment came to Egypt in Exodus the 12th chapter the Bible says that that God spoke to Moses and Moses went to the children of of Egypt he said I will pass through the land of Egypt This night I will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast, and against all the gods of Egypt, I will execute judgment, for I am the Lord. It was a it was a declaration of judgment that had come upon Egypt. But you'll notice that after that declaration was made before it actually happened before so the declaration came the judgment was made but before it actually took place that same prophet that was named Moses the that spoke the plague of judgment he spoke to the children of Israel and he said unto them the Bible says Moses called the elders of Israel and he said draw out and take you a lamb according to your families a and kill the Passover and you shall take and dip it in the blood that is in the basin and strike the lentil on the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out at that door of the house until morning for the death angel is coming through the land and he's going to take the firstborn and death is tracking the land he said but don't you go out of the house but put blood upon the door for the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians and when he sees the blood upon the lentil on the two side post and the Lord will pass over your door and he will not suffer the destroyer to come in under your houses to smite you. I thought, my, isn't that a thing of God to think about this morning that even though there was a judgment that was declared, there was also by the same voice that declared judgment, declared a mercy of God. He gave an atonement. He said, "If you'll put the blood on the door, then then God will not suffer the destroyer to come into your house." I don't know about you this morning, but I claim that over my house that God would not suffer the destroyer to come into my house to destroy my household. I I think every father this morning ought to put ought to claim that this morning and say, "But God will not suffer the destroyer cuz I put the blood of God upon the door of my house that God won't suffer the destroyer to enter therein." &gt;&gt; But it was the same voice that pronounced judgment was also the voice that pronounced mercy &gt;&gt; to them. You know, I thought I thought about that. You know, we've certainly heard the voice of judgment in this hour. We've I'm I I I can remember on tape when the prophet of God said, "I indict this generation." The voice of judgment has rang loud and clear. It's not a It wasn't something that was skirted around. Brother B said he said, "Let me say this as I'm leaving tonight." He said, "This is America's hour. She has spurned it." I said this two years ago that America will never have a revival. Write it in your book and find out if it's not right or not. She is done. If God let America get by with this sinful, unbelieving, church-going bunch of hypocrites, he would have to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah and apologized to them for sinking them in order to be a just God. He said, even though the angels smoked them blind, they were in darkness feeling around a perverted spirit. And tonight, America stands in the same shape. There's nothing left but fire. I said, we've heard the voice of judgment. You say, "Well, brother Math, that was a nation but uh that rejected God." But what about the church? Well, when a prophet of God talked about the church, it wasn't much better of a case. And matter of fact, he said, "And the world has fallen apart again." He said, "But the church sits spiritually dead. She is gone. The hour has passed them. They're in a slump and hardly know what to do. One running this way and one that way. And here, every promise that God made in the Bible, every one of them is laying as good as they ever was. But it's the hour. What makes the church like this? It's because we're in the age of Leoa when she has to come this way for this is the hour for. So there ain't no getting around it. Whether it's the nation or whether it's the church, this is the hour of a spiritual plague. It's the hour of spiritual death coming upon the church. It's been plagued with death. But friends, let me tell you, because it's been plagued with death, there's also a people that would be called out of that condition. And the Bible would tell us that when they come into this great condition, you recognize in this age, brother Wesley, that they have recognized that there is a need for a spiritual revival. And now in this last day, the people around the world are a pulling. They're moving to trying to bring a revival back to America. There's many things that raise up, many great speakers. There'll be many great men that do all they can in order to restore a revival. But I got news for you. I don't want to say this to uh to hurt anybody in any way, but it ain't ever going to work cuz there'll never be another revival in America. There may be a revival among the bride. There'll be a revival among God's children, but there'll never be another nationwide revival. So, if that's your effort, it's an effort that is laid in vain because it will never come to pass. But notice what they've done is because they recognize there's a need for revival. They they try to impersonate the revival. I may as well preach this morning. But they they try to impersonate it with music and try to impersonate it with worship and have these big worship concerts and big music concerts in order to bring people into a spirit of church of church or a spirit of revival. But friends, I've got news for you this morning. Any revival that is not a word revival is no revival at all. &gt;&gt; Because a revival is a comeback. In other words, it means to take something that was once alive that has became dead and to make it live again. That's what a revival is. So in the spirit of revival, I can say this this morning that there's no life outside of the word of God. So if a revival is to restore life and there's no life outside of the word, then it can only take the word of God to bring a true revival. That means I can say this this morning that there ain't no such thing as a musical revival. There's no such thing as a worshipdriven revival. There's no such thing as a praise revival. There's no such thing as a musicdriven revival or a youth program driven revival. But the only true revival that there is comes from a restoring of God's word in the heart of every believer. That's the only way you'll ever have a revival. I I know what they say. They say, "Well, what about Paul and Silas when they were down there in the jail cell?" The Bible said they sang and they begin to pray unto God and they were singing praises. And when they praised God, there came a revival in the jail cell that shook the walls. But friends, don't miss the important part. I can say this. It wasn't singing and praying that brought a revival in the jail cell or in their time of trouble, but it was a revival that caused them to sing and to pray in their time of trouble. Let me tell you, the revival was already there. That's why they were singing when they would look at the devil and say, "You can bind my hands and you can bind my feet, but you'll never take the praise of God out of these mortal lips. YOU CAN STAY my voice. You can tie me up. YOU CAN SHACKLE ME ALL YOU WANT TO. BUT AS LONG AS THERE'S still breath in my body. THERE'S A REVIVAL IN MY HEART AND IT'S CRYING out to my God. Revival didn't come from praising. It didn't come from singing. Revival came from the word of God. For the Bible said they were thrown in the jail cell because they were preaching the word of Jesus Christ. And they were making the word known in the streets of the city. That's why they were even captured. But that revival caused them in their time of trouble. Satan, you can do what you want to, but let me tell you, a real word revival, it'll produce some worship. Amen. It'll produce some praise. It'll produce some praying. It'll produce some singing. And we might use good music, and we might use good worship. And you know what it does, brother Mark? It attracts some people, and they'll come around and they'll enjoy some good worship, but all of a sudden, the word of God will drop in their heart. And then their faith is restored because they've heard the word of God. And when their faith is restored, now a real word revival comes into their heart. And then they go out singing and praising. Well, they must have heard a good song. No, that wasn't it at all. No, they're singing because something happened in their heart. They were identified with God by the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's what we need today. A real revival, Holy Ghost revival, a spiritual revival. Remember what the Jesus said? He said they would come looking for it in the last days. He said there the kingdom of heaven will be like unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were wise. Five were foolish. But they that were foolish took their lamps and they took no oil with them. And but the wise took oil in their vessels and with their lamps. And when while the bridegroom carried, they slumbered and slept. But at midnight there was a cry made. Behold, the bridegroom cometh. &gt;&gt; Go ye out to meet him. I thought, what a cry it is. But remember said, I believe we're that we're so close to the coming of the Lord that I can say that. Behold, the bridegroom cometh. &gt;&gt; I've heard the midnight cry. I wonder how many's heard it today. I've heard the midnight cry, the bridegroom cometh. This is the hour of the rapture is at hand. He said, we're right at the time of the end. That's the hour that we're living in. But then whenever he cried, all of the virgins arose and they trimmed their lamps because the bridegroom, there was a call of the bridegroom. Go ye out to meet him. Here they had went out and they had they had brought their lamps and and some of them brought oil in their lamps, which was the spirit of God. And they they were filled with oil. And the others, they were just they were they had lamps. They just didn't have any oil with it, brother David. And they but they but they went out and when they heard that cry, they awoke out of their slumber. They said, "The bridegroom cometh. Go ye out to meet him." Now they didn't have time. So they went to scurrying around at the last moment. And they went to those that had the oil and said, "Can you give us some of your oil because we can't find our way. We we have to have oil." And the and those with the oil knew the precious how how precious that it was. They said, "You go to the store and find those that sell oil. Go buy your own oil. I can't give you my oil. It it it's what God it's what I'm going to need in order to to get where I'm going. And the Bible says, "But when they went into the marketplace to find oil, that while they were gone in the marketplace that the Lord came," he said, "And when the bridegroom came that they that were ready, they went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut. But after came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, open to us." But he said, "I don't know you." And Jesus said, "Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of Man cometh." In other words, keep oil in your lamp. He said, "You don't know the date or the hour when a son of man cometh." But said, remember, he said, "This is the hour that the sleeping virgin would come to buy oil. It's the same hour that the bridegroom would come." He said, "That's the way it is today, the denominational churches, how the that a few years ago, they wouldn't have nothing to do with any Pentecostal move. Why they would mock and make fun of it, all these different denominations, but now here they would come around and friends, we've seen it today, even greater than in that age. Is that not the movement in America today? If you want to have a great big church and a great movement, let me tell you what it is. It's a charismatic church. It's a non-denominational church. They're coming out of denominations by the thousands building these great charismatic churches, great worship centers. Say, what are they doing? They're coming to the coming to that place looking for the oil. They copy that same move of the Holy Ghost, that same move of Pentecostal speaking in tongues, trying to copy after that experience. He said, "But while they were trying to do it," he said, "they may go through all the emotions and all the isms and sensations, but the devil can impersonate all those things because they're coming in trying to buy oil, but while they're trying to find the oil, they'll never find it because the Bible said they'll never find it." Said, "But while they would come to buy it, trying to get it, the bridegroom will come, and the ones that had the oil are going to go in with him." &gt;&gt; Friends, let me tell you, we're living in an age of spiritual death. But I thank God that right among that spiritual death there sleeps a that that there there there is one of those virgins that have has oil. She she ain't just one that that is that is empty. Her lamp isn't empty, but it's filled with the Holy Ghost. It's been filled from the beginning. But but friends, we we have a a way that God has sent us an atonement that he has sent us in this hour of spiritual death. You know, I think of it just as it was in the days of Egypt. There's an atonement that has been made for death. For the same voice that declared judgment was the same voice that declared mercy. And I've heard the voice of judgment. I've heard the voice say that this nation has spurned it. And and the church world has spurned it. And there's spiritual uh spiritual death that's come upon the church. But you know what else I've heard? I've heard the voice of mercy. When he said, "Hide yourself in the Lord's pavilion." John said, "There was a bride. I saw her. She was adorned for her husband. For the bride hath made herself ready." But Abraham said, "May this be the crowning of my ministry that the bride would dress herself in the word of God." I thank God that in a time of spiritual death, but there's still a way, an atonement, a covering for the bride of Jesus Christ that she wouldn't be able to go to God empty-handed. But he gave us what we needed to cover ourselves, put on the covering of the word of God. &gt;&gt; You remember brother Bam telling the the vision or the preview of the bride. Remember he went over there, he said, "I saw all of those that would come before the come before the Lord. They were marching on and I saw that little bride as she came forth and how beautiful and a lovely lady that she was. And as she went forth and I I watched how she walked so ladylike and and he said and after that she went by then I watched the church of every age walk by as they were preview. Remember when he saw her he said a voice spoke to me and said that's the preview of the bride. He said how lovely she was. But then I saw the the the the church out of every age and every age she got worse and worse and worse. He said then it come down to the last age and I saw that go by and and and the voice spoke to me and said this was the church out of America, the USA. He said when she went by she had she had no clothes on from from her waist up. She was nude from the waist up. A little hulas skirt trying to cover herself with some gray covering. He said what a hideous sight it was as I saw her marching there. He said, "And I got so I felt so bad to think that after all of the ministry and after all of the work that had gone forth that that that this would be this way." And he said, "I saw how ugly it was and here she was marching and twisting to a a tune of rock and roll and just carry it on." He said, "And that voice cried out and said, that is the church." He said, "How awful it was to think that that was the church." He said, "It passed me by and my heart fainted. I thought if that's what's been trying to present it to Christ as the bride." He said, "Of all the efforts and things that have gone forth to bring a bride for Christ, what a vulgar and dirty and filthy looking prostitute like that to be the bride of Christ." He said, "It made me sick at my heart." He said, "But as God is my judge," he said, "that was the church from the USA." He said, "But as she passed by, the whole back part had no covering at all." He said, "I felt faint and sickly." He said, "But all of a sudden, I heard that voice again." See the same cry, the same voice of judgment was also the same voice of atonement. He said, I heard that voice again and he said the bride will come into preview again. He said and here the bride came behind her. Here the very same looking bride that had passed in the beginning. She was marching to the same tomb. She was walking the same way. She was dressed in the same garment. The same bride that came in the first days that ride in the last days. He said there she came passing by again. He said, "And then my heart jumped for joy to know that there will be a bride and she will be made of the same thing and clothed in the same thing that the one was in the beginning. For she is called. She's called of God in this hour. In an hour of spiritual death, there's one that's called to be alive. In an hour of people that are a backslid nation, there's one THAT'S CALLED TO STAND UPON THE word of God. In a in an hour when people fail to believe, there's one that's still called to be a believer. Abraham said, "I know it's the truth." He said, "If that isn't true, then every vision that I've ever had is a lie." &gt;&gt; He said, "I know it's true. I saw her in the beginning and I saw her in the end." He said, "Everyone that knows that they've been true. The filthiness of this modern church calling herself a church." But friends, let me tell you, in the age of spiritual death, we have an atonement. &gt;&gt; We have a covering. This word has become a covering unto us. But notice how they received it. See, the atonement came in the form of a message. It wasn't just any kind of a message. Watch in Egypt now. We're back to Egypt. Had it had to be a message if he if Moses is going to come and bring the children of Israel out of this condition. It had to be a message that had enough power to cause Pharaoh to let him go. &gt;&gt; So, this couldn't be a feel-good message. &gt;&gt; Couldn't be a motivational speech. He wasn't going to motivate Pharaoh into letting all of his slaves leave out of this place. It couldn't be just something that would make people feel good. It had to have enough power that God's children would follow it. It had to have enough power that the devil would be afraid of it. It had to have enough power that Pharaoh would let them loose. It had it had to be a message with power. So, it had to be a message that would shake a nation. It had to be a message that would bring deliverance to God's children. So, therefore, if it was going to come a message, it would had to be a supernatural message. &gt;&gt; You say, "Why would it have to be supernatural?" Let me tell you why. because that's all that's all that Israel knew was supernatural. Do you realize this that they were supernaturally brought into Egypt and they were supernaturally brought out. So in order to bring them out of that condition, there had to come a supernatural message. That's why they got there. Remember Abraham. God called him to sojourn into a land that wasn't his. Abraham begot Jacob. Jacob begot Isaac. Isaac or Isaac and Isaac begot Jacob, which was Israel. Jacob had 12 sons. Remember the the first son from his wife that he loved so much, Rachel. It it started out with a supernatural birth which was Joseph, Rachel wasn't able to have children. She was barren. But because of the supernatural, God touched her body. He brought forth Joseph. And Joseph being a blessed man of God. He was filled with the supernatural. He went out as a young man. He had dreams. God dealt with him on a supernatural level. His brothers hated him because the dreams that he had. Remember, he said, "I saw the sheav that were that were bound together and I saw y'all's sheav bound down to mine." And they got mad at him. And then he came back. He said, "I had another dream. There was a moon and the star, 11 stars and the sun and the moon and they all bowed down to me and even Jacob his father would say, "You mean me and your mother and all your brothers are going to bow down to you?" And they hated him because of the supernatural that took place in his life. But it had to take the supernatural in order for God's plan to be able to work. &gt;&gt; So God brought a man that was anointed and able to see dreams. And they hated him so much that they wanted to kick him out. Little did they know, they fell right into the plan of God. They took him out. They threw him in a pit. They sold him to a slave caravan. The caravan soldwed him to Piper's house. Piper's wife lied on him. He wound up in a prison. But even in the prison, the entire time he still seen dreams. He still saw visions. God still dealt with him. The supernatural was still working in his life until finally the Pharaoh had need of him. And that same very supernatural gift in his life is what saved the entire nation of Egypt. It saved the entire nation of Israel. And God took a prisoner and put him on the throne of Egypt. It was supernatural that brought them into that place. They didn't just accidentally show up. It was a supernatural gift that put him in that place. And it would take a supernatural gift that would bring them out. &gt;&gt; He was so supernatural that God took a slave and made him a ruler over Egypt. But notice after a few years that Joseph had passed away, there was nothing recorded in Egypt for many years, hundreds of years, that there's nothing recorded of God ever doing among his among his children. So there's no record of it. Went through years. They went through all these years of prosperity. Many years that they lived there, hundreds of years that they lived in bondage after the new Pharaoh came that did not know Joseph. But then it came to a time of deliverance. You think about all this time, no great supernatural move here. this great supernatural that took place to get him in here. Even after they got there, there was some great things that happened in Joseph's life and those that followed after Joseph, but there came one that didn't know him. And so then after all this time had gone by and they came to this this spiritual plague or that where there wasn't no move of God, all these things, everything it just seemed to be gone. But then then after a little while, all of a sudden after Joseph died, but Ram said, "See the supernatural, it went with Joseph." He said, "There came death." Because Joseph was a type of Christ. But notice that just before judgment came, then all of a sudden there came again God to bring his church out. And there was a message. There was a prophet. There was angels that appeared. There was a supernatural signs that took place. I thought, isn't it something that that it was a supernatural that put them there? It's a supernatural that I kind of say it like this. It was a supernatural that established the church. It was a supernatural that came to the 120 in the upper room. It was a supernatural that started it. After all those years when it seemed like the supernatural was gone and the miracles ain't gone and the things of God, it seemed like they went through all those dark ages. But then when it would come the time of deliverance, all of a sudden we have a prophet again. A message is sent to them. There's an angels that are appearing again. It ain't just some story no gone by, but the angels of God are walking amongst the children OF GOD AGAIN. THE SONS OF MEN ARE meeting the angels of God on the road and they're giving them word to be able to speak to God's children because it's the time of deliverance, &gt;&gt; the time of the rapture. &gt;&gt; The angel came, the supernatural came, the prophet came, the supernatural, can I say this this morning? The supernatural is a declaration that slavery was over, that their bondage was ending, and that freedom was here. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That's what it declared in that hour. slavery was over, their bondage was ending, and freedom was here. And I got news for you. It wasn't just for Egypt, but that's the same thing that happened for us today. That's the same way their atonement came. It's the same way our atonement came. God sent a message in this hour. It wasn't just some little message. It was a supernatural message, Brother Mark, that would declare freedom from spiritual bondage. I say this this morning that the message of Revelations 18, come out of her, my people, is an anointed message of God. It's a supernatural message. It had to HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO CALL THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST OUT OF THE church and the bondage that she WAS IN. IT HAD TO HAVE ENOUGH POWER to call her out. IT HAD TO HAVE THE POWER TO ESTABLISH HER. IT WAS AN anointing message, A SUPERNATURAL MESSAGE. IT HAD TO HAVE THE ABILITY, brother Mah, TO TELL A PEOPLE THAT SLAVERY WAS OVER AND BONDAGE WAS ENDED AND FREEDOM WAS HERE. IT HAD TO HAVE THE POWER TO DELIVER GOD'S CHILDREN. THEY'VE BEEN SO WRAPPED up by dark denominationalism and and formalism and spiritually dead. But I thank GOD THERE'S A MESSAGE THAT CAME IN THIS HOUR THAT HAD THE POWER TO DECLARE UNTO YOU THAT SLAVERY IS OVER AND BONDAGE IS ENDED AND FREEDOM IS HERE. I SAY THAT THIS MORNING, SLAVERY IS OVER AND BONDAGE IS ENDED AND FREEDOM IS HERE. I WONDER HOW MANY SAY IT THIS MORNING. I SAID SLAVERY IS OVER. BONDAGE IS ENDED AND FREEDOM IS HERE. I'M TALKING ABOUT A MESSAGE THAT HAD THE POWER TO DELIVER GOD'S CHILDREN OUT of a state of bondage. &gt;&gt; It had to be supernatural. &gt;&gt; It ain't no little thing. It's supernatural. This ain't no story book. This ain't no children's story. IT'S SUPERNATURAL. THIS AIN'T just another church or another message or or something that men try to make it UP TO BE. I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S SUPERNATURAL. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND HIS HOLY ANGELS PRESENT AMONG his church. Slavery's over. &gt;&gt; Bondage has ended. Freedom is here. That's our declaration. &gt;&gt; They waited all those years for God to fulfill his promise. &gt;&gt; Wonder how long they waited. All those years waiting for God to come fulfill his promise. They go into the marketplace scared to death. There's going to be a taskmaster there. They had to dodge all the all the Egyptians and hide from them. But maybe there was some there that said, "One of these days, I'm going to be able to walk into this place and it'll change the way I approach." And you know, when the prophet's message came to Israel, I imagine that it changed their approach when they walked around. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that few days in there when Moses is is bringing the plagues upon Egypt and God's dealing with them and the message that Moses's message has reached the ears of the Israelites here? They know that God's bringing them out. They're seeing the hand of God. They're seeing the work of God. and brother Martin now they're all all of a sudden they're walking around now that they have a new hope brother Tom that walk out I can go in the marketplace and I ain't afraid to go in the marketplace you know one of these days maybe some old Egyptian give them an ugly look they say you can look ugly all you want to but in a few days I'll never have to look at you again I know that God's going to bring me out of this place I I'll never have to look at that building I'll never have to look at that mud pit I'll never have to look at that that big old thing you made that old uh ugly city that you made me build one of these days this city will be in my rearview mirror and I'll never come back care again. &gt;&gt; God is going to destroy him. They knew one day they could walk out. You know why? Because the supernatural was a vindication to them that God was going to bring them out. &gt;&gt; Isn't it something? The supernatural came before he brought them out. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just the supernatural that brought them out. Before he brought them out, there was a season of the supernatural operating in the midst of the church. You see, so here here it would give them faith that God was going to bring them out. And friends, can I just say this this morning that when the supernatural comes, that ain't the only thing it brings is faith. &gt;&gt; It also brings out every doubter. It brings out every critic. It brings out every skeptic. It brings out every unbeliever that there ever was. You you you let you think it wasn't the same way there. Whenever somebody came around and said, "Hey, Moses is the man that God has anointed for this hour. Oh, God's c sent a prophet in this me sent a message in this age. He's going to deliver us. Moses, how's that one man going to deliver us from this great army of the Egyptians? But all I know is this the word of the Lord and I promise you there was people that went out talking to their families just like they do in this age and say, "Well, I don't know where they got that from." Matter of fact, I mean, who is that Moses anyhow? And what what makes him any better than the next man? And why would he have the ability? Why? He ain't just but one man. You know what? There was doubters there. And there was I can just hear him right now. You was raised in this slave pit. You was born in the slave pit. I'm going to die in the slave pit. I I was born building bricks. I'm going to die building bricks. You can go on and believe all that hokeyp pokey if you want to, but I know I'm just going to stay right here and keep my nose to the ground because that's what this is where God po put us and this is just our lot and we're just going to have to deal with this world and we're never going to be able to overcome it and we're never GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF IT. THIS IS JUST WHAT GOD WANTS FOR MY LIFE. THERE WAS DOUBTERS there too. But I thank God there was somebody say, "But the Bible, but the word of God said that he is going to send a messenger in this age that would bring an atonement to the children OF GOD IN A way that THEY COULD COME OUT OF THIS CONDITION." [cheering] [applause] FRIENDS, don't you realize there's a Everything has a season, drought has a season, famine has a season, bondage has a season, sickness has a season, persecution has a season, oppression has a season, GRIEF HAS A SEASON. But the same God of Joseph &gt;&gt; was the same God of Moses. &gt;&gt; The supernatural brought him in, the supernatural brought him out. And Moses said, "How will they believe me?" And God said, "I'll give you a sign." &gt;&gt; See, the supernatural would be a vindication that he was sent by God. You know what the Bible says? When Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord said to Moses and he did the signs in front of the people, can I tell you what the Bible says? Bible says the people believed. &gt;&gt; Isn't that good enough? &gt;&gt; When he did the signs in front of the people, the people believed. I thought it didn't matter how many doubters. It didn't matter how many skeptics. It didn't matter how many was fighting against Moses. The Bible says, but the people believed. I thought, thank God there's some people that when they see the sign, there was some that believe. That that's what I took there. There there still was those that held on to the faith that that when they seen the supernatural, they believed. It's the same way today. I thank God that there's some that still believe that we know that Christ when he died on Calvary. They've been waiting on him to return. But the only way to know of his return is a vindication of the supernatural. That's the only way you'll know it. That's what Paul said. He said he was once offered to bear the sins of many. And unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation. You say, "Well, who will he appear to?" I can tell you what the Bible said. He said he will appear to those that love his appearing and welcome his return. &gt;&gt; They believe the sign that they saw. Said, "We've seen the presence of a supernatural sign that has declared to us that bondage is over and has called us out of the church and into the bride of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; I wonder how many believers we have here this morning. &gt;&gt; How many fall in that category? Well, they heard the word that God said to Moses and they saw the sign. The people believed. &gt;&gt; Makes me want to preach on it. &gt;&gt; And the people believed. Isn't that good? And the people believed. But notice what Moses done to bring the people to this place. He had to take their eyes off of the power that was before them and put their eyes on something else. Here these people were born and they were raised in this condition of Egypt. And they would look at the great power of Pharaoh and the power of Egypt. What a great nation that it was. A great army, a great place that they were in bondage to. And how easy it is and even today how easy it is to look at the greatness of the pull of the world and the greatness of Leosa and the greatness of the of the world and all the things of the world and how how easy it is to get our eyes and look upon the the bondage that Satan puts us under and how it's so easy to look around and see everybody's failures and so easy to look in a mirror and see all of our own failures. Isn't it easy to see those things? But listen, when Moses would come, he says, "See, we're we're just a little people, and look how look how grand all that is out there, and we're we're just this little group of Israel. We don't have no army. We we don't have these great chariots like that. We how could we ever fight somebody like that? We're just a little people." But Moses changed their eyes from looking at the natural thing to looking to the supernatural. &gt;&gt; This is what Apostle Paul was doing. Do I got time to finish? This is what apostle Paul was doing in in the in the book of Colossians is he was actually changing the view of the church. &gt;&gt; Paul said where Christ siteth on the right hand of God. I think this is so powerful. He said if he if ye the then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ siteth on the right hand of God. I thought here when he would approach the church the first thing he does is to show them where Christ is. That he's not in a tomb. He wants to make known he's not in a tomb somewhere. He's not he's not he's not dead. He's not buried up in a grave somewhere. He said, "But first, let's just change our focus. I I know there's a lot going on in the church. And there's a lot going on in the world. Even in the Colossian and the Corinthian church, in the Ephesus church, can I go ahead and say it? In the Black Rockck Church, and the Arkansas church, in the in the India church, there there's a lot of things going on all all in the church." But Paul, he says, "But but he says," but first notice, he says, "Seek those things which are above where Christ siteth on the right hand of God." I thought he couldn't say it any better because it changes our view of the things around us and causes us to look to something else. Where where is this right hand of God and where where is this throne of God that you're speaking of? He says, "See, so he's changing the view of the church." And now Paul said, "But so set your affection on things above and not on the things of the earth." &gt;&gt; Can I say this this morning? You know, in order to set your affection on things above, you realize that to set it can't be coincidental. To set something, it can't be accidental. So when Paul says set your affection, the word set means to put or to place or to stand something in a desired place or position. So to set something, it would have to be it would have to be an intentional act. If I'm going to set something, that that that's why he would use that word. I can set that bottle there. It can't accidentally go there. If I'm to set it, I have to place it. It has to be intended. It had to has to be with purpose. Paul said, "Set your affection on things above." In other words, it ret it requires an intentional and a conscious effort in order to set your affection on these things. That means you can't go through life and say, "Well, whatever the boss says, I'm just going to let it happen. And whatever whatever mom says, I'm just going I'm just going to go through the motions. And whatever the brother Matt says, I'm just going to I'm just going to go through it and that'll be enough. And whatever whatever the church says, I that'll be enough. Whatever the the preacher says, that'll be enough." Well, friends, let me tell you that might get you by in the natural, but but but but your spiritual life demands more of you than just getting by. &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? &gt;&gt; Your spiritual life demands more of you than just getting by and just going through the motions. And Paul said you have to set your affections. &gt;&gt; It's an intentional act. It's something that you have to purposefully do. Said, that's why God brought you something that you could have faith in. You see, see why there's so many uh today that try to put faith in so many things. Abraham said, he said, "A man could even come here right now and have nail scars in his hands. He could have thorn prints and and say, "I am the Lord and any old hypocrite could do that." He said, "But the life, the Lord Jesus, the body is sitting at the right hand of the majesty. And when he comes, time is no more when that body returns to the earth." He said, "But his spirit is here." And his life is giving evidence of him being here because he said, "I'll be with you even in you unto the end of the world." So here a prophet of God would take it and show you how to look upon the right thing. It ain't to look for a man with nail scarred hands. We're not looking for somebody that has a thorn on his head. We're not looking for somebody to come by in a robe and wearing sandals and have long hair walking on the side of the road carrying a cross trying to do something for the Lord. Well, that's all wonderful and everything, but it ain't it ain't ever going that that that ain't where God is. But but he said, but he's on the right hand of God. He said, "But his spirit is here for his spirit is alive and his life is giving evidence of him being here." So God has brought us something that we could have faith in. It's not a physical body or the corporal body of Jesus, but it's the life or the spirit of God that is present among the church. Now notice this word to set your affection to set your affection actually that word affection comes from the Greek word fronel which actually which actually is the it means minded. It's the same words that's used in the scriptures. uh uh scriptures like these to set your affection on or to be carefully minded or to be likeminded to be of one mind and one accord to be of the same mind or to let this mind be in you that was in Christ all of those words was the same words so so when you say to set your affection in other words it means to set your mind I in other words brother Mark it it ain't talking about your feelings it ain't talking about the the senses because it's so easy for us to go by that it's so easy to judge things by these five by these five senses. But Paul's talking about a supernatural thing. He's talking about things above and not things on the earth. So, can I tell you a secret? Your five senses were not made for you to contact supernatural things. They weren't made for you to contact things above. That's why you can't go by your feelings. Your feelings lie to you. That's why you can't go by your emotions. Your emotions lie to you. You can't go by see, taste, feel, smell, and hear. Those things were given your natural body in order to contact this natural realm. They're made for you to make contact with the earthly things. An earthly body make contact with earthly things. But God gave you another sense outside of those five senses called faith. It's a super sense. And God gave us that sense in order to contact another realm. That's why Paul SAID WE HAD A WAY TO CONTACT GOD. GOD IS NOT UNREACHABLE. HE'S NOT JUST on a throne somewhere that you can't reach him. But a prophet of God said his spirit IS HERE WITH US. HIS LIFE IS WALKING AMONG THE CHURCH. AND THE FAITH THAT'S IN EVERY BELIEVER CAN REACH OUT AND TOUCH GOD. &gt;&gt; He gave us a sense to be able to know that God is present. It ain't by my feelings. Stop going by your feelings. I'm I may as well just preach to you THIS MORNING. STOP GOING BY YOUR FEELINGS. STOP TRYING TO GET GOOSEBUMPS TO THINK WHETHER I GOT I PRAYED ENOUGH THAT I FELT SOME GOOSEBUMPS AND NOW I GOT THROUGH WITH GOD. QUIT GOING BY YOUR FEELINGS AND GO BY YOUR FAITH AND CLAIM THE WORD OF GOD AND SPEAK God's word and pray until THE HOLY GHOST FALLS IN the room. AND THEN YOU AIN'T GOT TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE CUZ YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FEEL IT ANYHOW WHEN THE HOLY GHOST GETS a hold of you. &gt;&gt; Quit going by our feelings. &gt;&gt; It ain't a feeling gospel. &gt;&gt; It ain't a touch and a feel and a smell. &gt;&gt; It's our faith. &gt;&gt; It's not made to touch supernatural things. You see, when dealing with the supernatural, the supernatural, many times it defies our natural senses. &gt;&gt; Isn't that true? It defies our natural senses. Your natural senses I I don't mean to bear down here. &gt;&gt; Do I got a minute? &gt;&gt; Your natural senses lie to you. &gt;&gt; That's hard to understand, is it? It's hard to You mean I can feel something and it ain't real? Yes. &gt;&gt; You mean I You mean I can hear something and it wasn't real? Yes. Your natural senses will lie to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, see, so it defies our natural senses. That's what happened to the woman at the well. Remember when Jesus came there? It would defy the natural sense for somebody to tell you everything that happened in your life and how many husbands that you had and where you came. It defies the natural feeling or the natural senses. Your mind would wonder how how could you know these things immediately? What would your mind go to if if you start telling somebody what they did yesterday and what they were thinking and what they looked at and all and you start telling them all of a sudden their mind goes to how did you know that where who told you or maybe because our our our natural feelings and our natural thoughts has to have a way to make it happen. &gt;&gt; You see so it defies the natural but this lady she went beyond the natural into a supernatural. She said I know that when the Messiah comes he would do these things. In other words I don't have no answer in the natural. I have no way. There's no way you can know that. I have no way to explain it. I have no way that that that's why I don't understand people that can't accept the supernatural. Their their eyes must just be blinded to the truth because when I see it, I say there's no natural way to explain it. So, it must be supernatural. And if it's supernatural, it didn't come from the devil, but it came from God. &gt;&gt; It's supernatural. So, when a supernatural come, it blinded their eyes. His miracles and things blinded their eyes. But says the same thing today. He blinds the eyes of the carnal mind because it can't understand the things of God. &gt;&gt; Because the carnal mind is against God. The Bible says it's an enemy. The human mind is an enemy to God. He said you got to get out of your own human mind and be born a new by the Holy Spirit and get the mind of God in you and then you can believe those things. &gt;&gt; It's the only way you'll ever believe the supernatural. Paul said, "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus." And when you get the mind of God, brother Mark, then the things of God become a reality. &gt;&gt; I'm about to close. &gt;&gt; When you get the mind of God, the things of God become a reality. &gt;&gt; When you think on the things of God, it brings him near. &gt;&gt; Isn't it something that most of the time what the devil does is he causes us to focus and think on negative things. You ever notice that? You sit around by yourself long enough, you don't have to raise your hand. But I don't ain't no sense in everybody raising their hands this morning. I'll save you the trouble. But every time we sit around by oursel, why is it that negative thoughts always come? Why this happened and that happened? Why' they do that? Why' they say that? Negative thoughts always come. So, see, it ain't it ain't our fault. That's just the devil always bringing negative thoughts and trying to get you to focus on the negative and get your mind to be on negative things. But remember said he said the reason he does it, listen. He said because you cannot get anything from God with a negative thought. So what Satan is trying to do is to keep you from getting anything from God knowing that you can't get anything with a negative thought. So he brings these negative thoughts. But listen what Paul said. He gives us the way out. He says finally brethren whatsoever things are true. Whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things. &gt;&gt; Set your mind, &gt;&gt; your affections on things above. &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible tells us the story of the man blind, Barnameus. How many knows the story? You know, he was a man that was looking to be healed. Here he sat by that road for so many years of his life, decades &gt;&gt; that had gone by that he had sat there. You know, Barnameus, he wasn't born blind. He was actually blinded as a young man, whether a disease or something that had happened. But according to the way he asked for healing, they would say he wasn't born blind. He had just became blind. And in this that he when he would ask Jesus for his healing, he would ask to regain his sight. But here he would sit in Jericho as a beggar and and you know I thought about him sitting there in this place and after this sitting in this place all of his life sitting there wrapped up in that old beggar cloak and begging for a little bit and blinded in his natural eye and didn't have nothing. Didn't feel like nothing. Wasn't worth nothing. I thought as he sat there and maybe like some of us feel sometimes but you know even by his own name it would his own name would defy what he felt like you know because the the name Barameus the name bar in Hebrew means son so that tells you he's somebody and the name Tomus means valuable or honorable so so so Barardameus he was a son and he was valuable whether he felt like it or not here he was a beggar he had sat all that time sitting there as a beggar on the wayside and and brother man would tell this story of how that he was sitting there waiting and he would he would think here he was in Jericho and And he would get to thinking about Joshua and how that that that that they come by uh that day and that that great army of Israel and and they came in there where Rahab was in bondage and and he got to thinking about how that they had walked around there, that great army of Israel and how they were getting ready to come in and take this uh this great city of Jericho and said as he as he sat there and he thought about it and thought here Joshua was out there that day and he was waiting on waiting for the Lord uh to give instruction. he was getting prepared to go into battle and and he would think about that story and he said, you know, while he was thinking about it, he remembered how that he was told that while Joshua was waiting by the wall, all of a sudden there appeared a man and Joshua he drew a man with his sword drawn and Joshua pulled out his sword. He said he said, "Are you with us or are you one of our enemies? Are you for us or against us?" He said, "And all and and then he heard them say, he said, no, but I am the captain of the host of the Lord." said, "And then Joshua threw down his sword and he fell down at his feet before the Lord's captain." He said, "Here, Barnameus was sitting in Jericho and he was thinking about Joshua and thinking about the captain of the Lord's host." I thought, "Isn't it something?" He said, while he was sitting there blind, and while he was sitting there begging, he said, "Blind Barnameus started thinking." I thought I thought, "Isn't that something?" He started thinking on something else. He wasn't thinking about his condition. He stopped thinking about his natural condition. He stopped thinking about the world and the things that are going on around it. He said, "But blind Barnameus started thinking." He said he was at 500 yards from where I'm sitting right now. The captain of the Lord's host stood one day just a few hundred years ago. He said, "Oh, if I could have been back there that day and I could have made it to the tent and I in my blindness and I could have got a hold of the captain of the Lord's host, I believe I could have asked him to heal me of my blindness and he would have gave me back my sight." But the ram said, "But little did he know that while he was sitting there thinking that THAT THAT SAME CAPTAIN WAS JUST A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM HIM, he heard the testimonies of what Jesus had done." He turn he heard of the healing. He heard of the works of God. And as he was sit on there, HE SAID, "THAT'S WHAT MAKES our failures tonight." He said, "We try to place the glory of Christ way back into another age." But the Bible said he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He's just as much here in this building today as he was when he ever walked on Galilee or he ever walked in the city of Jerusalem. The Bible said, "And while he was thinking on this, all of a sudden, because he was thinking on the right thing, he called out to Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me." And the Bible said here when he would come out, don't you realize that Jesus couldn't even have heard him holler? They said there was a great many number a vast number of people around him praising and worshiping and following and begging and over by the wayside set one man that said Jesus thou son of David have mercy and the Bible SAYS BUT HIS FAITH STOPPED JESUS &gt;&gt; and he bid him to come and when he bid him to come the Bible said there that man he he he turned around and he threw his garment aside he casted away his garment and he rose and he came to Jesus. I thought, "Isn't this something as a music player's come? Isn't it something that he was sitting in that condition all this time? &gt;&gt; But he got to thinking about the right thing." &gt;&gt; Got to thinking if the captain of the Lord's host &gt;&gt; was here, &gt;&gt; he could change my situation. &gt;&gt; If the captain of the Lord's host was here, he could give me healing. If the captain of the Lord's host was here, he could give me deliverance. He He could He could He could give me a change in my body. IF THE CAPTAIN OF THE LORD'S host was here, but while he thought on that, the captain walked near. &gt;&gt; My hallelujah. Why he thought on it? The captain, he walked near and when Jesus bit him. &gt;&gt; Isn't this something he gave him an invitation? &gt;&gt; He worked himself up. Brother Brian, he thought on it so much and until he couldn't even hold himself back. He thought on it so much till finally he went from saying alms. Alms arms. That's the only thing he knew how to say. Alms. I've been a beggar 30 years. Arms. Alms. Alms. But he got under such inspiration. &gt;&gt; Thinking on the things of God. Got under such inspiration thinking about this great captain &gt;&gt; of God's army that all of a sudden his his voice changed. &gt;&gt; And out of his mouth, I don't even know if he meant to say it. Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. How do you even know what to say? But his faith reached the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you who it reached. It reached the captain &gt;&gt; and the captain heard him. And that same one, I thought, "Oh my." Jesus walked down that path before. That same captain that stood there before Joshua that said, "As I was with Moses, so shall I be with thee. You're going to go over into that land. You're not going to lose a one. You just follow exactly what I tell you to do. That same captain that gave him the order how they would take over that city of Jericho. That same captain step by step, he said bid him to come. The Bible said he threw off that beggar cloak. You know what that means? You know what a beggar cloak was? The beggar didn't have nothing. And when you read through history, it'll actually tell you that the cloak of a beggar was their most valuable material possession. It was the most valuable thing they had. It's what identified them as a beggar. It's what allowed them to sit by the wayside. It's what they used to cover up in the winter time. They didn't have nothing. They were just beggars. But it was the most valuable thing that he had. Certainly, it was something that he had spent his life using and pondering and hiding in and hiding under. But now all of a sudden, when the captain came near, under such an inspiration, his mind wasn't thinking about being a beggar tomorrow. He wasn't thinking about what would happen to his cloak if he threw it aside. No doubt there's another beggar right by him that would love to have a cloak like that. Just grab it and scurry off with it. You can't let your possessions lay in the midst of a bunch of beggars. And he laid down as the most valuable possession. He, the Bible said, he cast it aside. You know what that means? He he didn't just gently lay it. It was covering him. And he said he bid you to come. He stood up and he took his beggar garment and he threw it aside and he went on his way to find the captain that was waiting to meet him there. He wasn't going back looking for that no more. When he made it to the feet of Jesus, Jesus said, "What would you have?" said that I would receive my sight. He said, "Go thy way, son, for your faith has made you whole." Isn't it something? Jesus said, "You go your way. Go your way. It's up to you, Barameus. Go thy way." And the Bible said his eyes came open and he followed Jesus along the way. He made his way Jesus's way. So, I don't have my own way no more. I've given my life to you. I threw my old life away. I I threw my my most valuable possession away. The very thing that held me to being a beggar. THE VERY THING THAT KEPT ME ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, THAT KEPT ME FROM BEING WHO YOU WANTED ME TO BE. I LAID IT DOWN. I CAST IT ASIDE AND I MET THE CAPTAIN. I SAID, "WHEREVER YOU GO, I'LL GO. WHERE YOU STAND, I'LL STAND. WHERE YOU DIE, I'LL DIE." FOR I MET THE CAPTAIN OF THE LORD'S HOST. Won't you stand to your feet this morning? He said, "When he thought on those things, his approach changed." Oh my friends. He didn't approach Jesus as a beggar. He approached him as a free man on his way to get his inheritance. Jesus didn't ask you to come as a beggar. He asked you to come as a son of God. He didn't ask you to come begging and begging him and pleading God to give you the Holy Ghost or or to give you the spirit of God. It ain't something that you have to beg for. It's something he already paid a price. He already gave it to you before you ever asked for it. It ain't how much you beg. It's just laying the cloak aside. Lay the cloak aside. Whatever it is that hold you to this life and the things of this flesh and set your affections [music] upon the things above. But Ram said, "It's why we're thinking on him." He said, "That's the trouble of the world today. We think about everything else but him and then we wonder why we don't get blessings. You think about this. The great supernatural ministry that brother Vanham had. Can I tell you this one more thing? The great all the supernatural things that happened in his ministry. Let me show you where that came from. He said, "A few weeks ago, about three weeks ago, I sat down by some sycamore trees and I began to think, wasn't thinking about the world and the things of the world, but thinking about the things of God." He said, "And it was there when I started to think that for the first time, he came and declared his new ministry unto me." Isn't that something as simple as just sitting down and thinking on the things of God? He said, "That's what David wrote." He said, "The commandments, write his commandments on your bedpost and meditate on them day and night." That's what the church ought to do. It would keep your heart tuned in with God day and night. And that's when he appears to think. Set your affections on the things above. When I think about the Lord, how he saved [singing] me, how [music] he raised me, how he filled me with the Holy Ghost, how he healed me to the uttermost.

Don't just wait till you go to church or some convenient hour. Just keep him on your mind all the time. When you think about the Lord, think, Lord, I'm your I'm your son. I'm your daughter. Lord, you called me out of this world. Lord, you saved me. You've established me. Lord, you sent a message in this hour to to call me out. Lord Lord, you you you love me and I love you. So, don't just wait. It's the most wonderful experience you can ever have. He said, ' If you ever, I trust everybody here has experienced him that that many times. If you haven't, this would be a good day to start. Just start thinking about him and worship him in your heart. And all of a sudden, you'll feel the close fellowship of the Holy Spirit around you. And it gets so anointed until you can't hold it any longer. And you'll raise up your hands or do something. You just can't stand still. When Jesus comes by, he's the captain of the Lord's host. how he saved me, how he raised me, how he fill me with the Holy Ghost. Amen. Don't it just do it to you this morning?
