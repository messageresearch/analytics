give you the glory for all that you do Lord we thank you now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and the church says amen amen we just want to invite you to the scriptures to the Book of Exodus and we're going to read out of the 19th Chapter and we'll start right in the first verse Exodus 19 and one when you get there just say Amen just give you a moment to find that scripture sure appreciate our singers this morning and my there there's nothing like some anointed singers that go before the word and make preparation amen and amen so we just want to read Exodus the 19th Chapter and we'll read out of the first verse the Bible says in the third month when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt the same day came they Into the Wilderness of Si for they were departed from ridum and were come to the desert of Si and had pitched in the wilderness and there Israel camped before the mountain and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called him out of the mountain saying thus shall thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people and all the Earth for all the Earth is mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel and I'd like to speak this morning as you take your seats I'm going to speak on a kingdom of priests and the power of Pentecost and I also want to read out of the book of uh acts the 2 chapter and and as you're seated in the first verse second chapter in the first verse the Bible says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord and in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now I want to speak this morning use these two scriptures the kingdom of priests and the power of Pentecost of course we know this word uh Pentecost brother Bobby is a uh is a word that we're very how many's familiar with the word Pentecost I said how many's familiar with the word Pentecost just make sure we we all we all get caught on here this morning so I'm going to go really fast so if y'all can just help me just to be able to get to where I want to get to this morning uh the Lord willing so uh this word Pentecost of course we realize that this is used by many churches and organizations around the world and uh certainly that there's many that would use this title they call we call uh theirselves Pentecostals and uh but you know I believe this this morning that any any good God called Pentecostal preacher would tell you that uh just because you call yourself Pentecostal doesn't mean that you've ever been to Pentecost it uh it's just a name that a lot of people use but but I want to show this morning um that that where this word had actually came from and we realized that uh that the name Pentecost was actually a part of the Jewish feast that was celebrated at the end of the first harvest and you realized that in the in the uh the feast that the Jews take part of these are pilgrimage feasts in other words uh when God had told Moses there'll be a time that you all come back to Jerusalem or come back uh come back to worship here so these are pilgrimage feasts there three uh major pilgrimage feasts one of them was the Feast of unleaving bread or or we would call it the Passover the other was the Feast of Weeks which we call Pentecost and the other uh the Feast of booths or or or be looked as the Christians would call it the Feast of Tabernacles but uh we realize that each one of these feasts they were they were they were uh uh made after a real event that took place in The Exodus in The Exodus journey of the journey from Egypt unto unto the promised land and so I want to look this morning at this middle one at the at this word Pentecost and and we we see that that Pentecost which which was in the Jews the Feast of Weeks it came uh it came after they had left out of the Passover remember whenever the when the angel of the Lord came and the death angel came and they put the blood up their doors to leave out of Egypt and then they went the Bible says in the third month they came to the Mount Si in other words so uh they they came to this place of of worship but their their time from from from uh coming out of the Passover to mount sign and I uh it took 50 days so the name Pentecost actually thank you brother Tim the name Pentecost actually means 50th so that's where the name had came from and so we see that 50 days after they came out of Egypt and away from the Passover and then they made their way over to Mount Si brother bham also would make this connection he said you'll notice that 50 is also the amount of years that it took in order for the Jubilee to come remember when a person would go into bondage or maybe they would get into debt or they would lose their family or go into slavery and be so into a slavery that every 50th year that God had made a place that they would be able to receive all of their stuff back they would be able to get out of bondage and have Liberty isn't it something that God would never allow his children to always remain in bondage I thought it was wonderful that he he would make a time and brother BR would take this and show that in that 50th year in the time of Jubilee He said see it was the same as Pentecost it brought Liberty to the church it brought whenever you got to this place that the bondage that you were under couldn't hold you any longer so but it didn't matter what was owed or what what debt was owed or how far how far how bad it was brother Jared but whenever you came to that year uh all was made whole again so we see as as Believers today as Christian Believers we remember we remember the name Pentecost as the day that the Holy Ghost fell in the book of Acts how many know that we that that's what whenever you say Pentecost that's what we think of what happened in Acts the 2 chapter it was the the day that the Holy Ghost invaded the church and it brought the it brought the power of God back to the church again it brought power back to the body of Believers and power back to the church but but we realize that that that that power is not the only thing that Pentecost brought to the church it wasn't uh that wasn't the only thing that that entered into the church but actually Pentecost also brought a time of Holiness to God's people and I I I think whenever God would speak of the what the day of Pentecost would be you can read this in numbers the 28th chapter the Bible said in the 26th verse it said also in the day of the first fruits when you bring a new meat offering unto the Lord after your weeks be out you shall have a holy convocation now now notice after your weeks be out remember this time of Pentecost it was seven weeks of seven days so that's 49 days and then on the following day was the 50th day which made it a Pentecost so so here the Lord says after your weeks be out the day he said you shall have a holy convocation and you shall do no survi work then so here whenever God's talking about this Pentecost time whenever the day of Pentecost would come it would be a day of holy convocation in other words you'd read this where where where in translated where we can understand it it was a holy convocation was a convocation of Holiness in other words it was a declaration of Holiness it was a it was a call to Holiness so when God tells them he said but after your weeks be out and on this day of Pentecost when this day would come it it is a call of the church to come to a place of Holiness that's why that's why when you see Pentecost and Holiness together that's where it come from it was a call to H it was a call of God to call the church back to this place of Holiness so you say well brother Matt why would Pentecost be a call to Holiness well you'd have to see what happened during that time see the first the first Pentecost that we see it didn't happen in the book of Acts in the second chapter but the first Pentecost the real event that happened that the feast was made after that that that time way back in in in the The Book of Exodus on Mount Si remember it was 50 days after they came out of the Passover they come to Mount Si this is actually the first time this is where Pentecost was uh was started this is what the feast was to to commemorate was this moment standing on the base of Mount Si when they came to this place here's what God said to Moses he said You shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and be a holy nation and then Moses goes on and he begins to tell the people that we're coming to a place where we're going to be in the presence of God he's about to take them and allow them to hear the voice of God he's he's going to take them to the base of the mountain and the presence of the the Lord is going to come and he's going to have communion with the people and Moses says but before we can ever get to that place there's something that has to be done it's a call of God to sanctify yourself and Moses begins to instruct the church he said you got to clean up the church you got to you got to wash all the clothes you got to clean yourselves you got to take the filthy thoughts and things out of your mind and you when you come in the presence of God you can't have all of that and be able to stand in the presence of God so here this time of Pentecost it was a call of Holiness Moses said clean up yourselves get get ready and get prepared and and get your life and your mind right and get your mind on the things of God that we can go to the base of the mountain that God could come and have communion with the church and the Bible said and Moses brought them forth he brought the people out of the camp to meet with God and they stood at the foot of the mountain and mount SI was all together the Bible said in Mount Si it was all together on a smoke because the Lord descended upon it in Fire and the smoke ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole Mountain Quake greatly see friends a real Pentecostal experience is to be in the presence of God here's what Moses is showing the church if you want a real Pentecostal experience you got to clean your life up and you got to let all these things go and sanctify yourself and then come with me and let's step into the presence of God and have a real Pentecostal experience with God see the Pentecostal experience it was a pillar of fire it was a it was the fire of God that came down on Mount Si that day and consumed the the very lives of people I think isn't it isn't it something to be able to have an experience that way brother M said like this he said why would you want to be halfway what's the use of being a lukewarm Church hello somebody he said either be red hot or be ice cold and don't claim Pentecost unless you're going to live Pentecost there ain't no needing jumping any higher than you live because it ain't the bootleg joints that's causing the that's hurting the unbeliever it ain't the it ain't the bars that hurts the unbeliever it ain't all the the f places in the world in the whiskey store that hurts the unbeliever he said it's the people that claim to have something and still act like the world that's the real stumbling bought to the unbeliever but I thank God that God has called us to a real Pentecost I thank God that he's called us to this place of Holiness and to a place of sanctification but remember said Pentecost it is your possession so even if you don't feel like it's something that you can have or something that you can achieve here's a promise from a prophet of God he said Pentecost is your possession it it belongs to you it it belongs to you he said the Pentecostal experience is your possession you know what that tells me brother Jared that every person young or old every man every woman and child has a right to a real Pentecostal experience how many believe that he said it's your possession now notice in the Old Testament all the things that happened in the Old Testament brother remember would go through he said look what they did when they walked before God they escape the edge of a sword they come out of fiery furnaces they they they they they escape lies Den everything that they done in the Old Testament he said it was just a shadow of that real Pentecost it was a shadow of what God could really do or don't you see Church it ain't something that God was greater back in the old days it wasn't God was greater when he could take somebody out of a Li's Den or or bring somebody through a fire but the prophet of God said that was the shadow of the reality of what God's going to do in this age friends it and it's our possession it belongs to us it's what we it's what we attain uh brother Weser we strive in order to be able to attain it or to achieve it but you notice he says see the the this real Pentecost that was a shadow of Pentecost but what happened in the book of Acts this is what God was trying to bring to the church this is a a real Pentecostal experience bringing it to the church we realize that this is what the church had need of how many believe that the church needs something that can sustain the church do you believe it you you have to have something that could sustain it because the church is going to go through 2,000 years and all these ages and all these great trials and and Through the Dark Ages and all these things that the church would have to go through through these through these years these great many battles so we have to have something that could sustain the church through all of that time even David would write he said cast your burden on the Lord he said he shall sustain thee it meant something to David to be sustained he said my God is my portion it meant something to have something that could sustain you he said he's my portion he's my satisfying portion he he's something that I can hold on to he it's something that that can help me through the next day he's something that can help me through my trial he's something that can help me through the battle he's my satisfying portion and he can sustain me see David being a king of Israel no doubt David knew knew what it meant to have a God that was a sustainer he knew what it meant to have something that could sustain you it it wasn't just a few years after they had became a nation that David just a few Generations that he had became the king over Israel but David being a king no doubt he knew the history of the Kingdom hello and because he knew the history of the Kingdom he knew that God had always been a sustainer to his children oh I could just see David you know young boys many young boys that he raised and you you going to see little Solomon coming up there Oh Daddy you know I heard that one of the tutors that was telling me about our ancestors and how they came out of Egypt and and and when they come out there was this Mana that fell from heaven and and and and they always got fed throughout the day daddy what's that story all about I just see David turning to him say Well Solomon let me just tell you son God when God has always been a sustainer can I ask you like this Solomon but when you come to the table is there not always food at the table yeah Daddy there's always food at the table why why do you come to the table Solomon well I come to eat have you ever do you know where the food comes from well Daddy I never really thought about it but every time I sit down at the table there's always plenty of food have you ever went hungry Solomon no Daddy I've never went hungry you know why because he lived in the house of a king and the table was always full and when I come to the table and there's something that that will take care of me there's a sustainer there's a sustenance there's food that I can feed on it gives strength to my body it brings joy to my soul it's things that I enjoy eating and feeding on he said Solomon see that's the way it is with God it's just like you being a young man having an Earthly father that would put food on the table and make sure you had something to sustain you that's the way that God done with his children when they came out of Egypt and they had no food in their belly and they couldn't go another day and they got to murmur into God saying God I'm hungry for something son let me tell you what God done he rained Mana out of heaven and they walked out of their tents and upon the ground was food that came from God it wasn't there the night before the worms and things had eat it all up but when it came out of Heaven There was food and they fed it from the time they left out of Egypt till the time they entered into the promised land the Bible said they ate fresh Mana every day see that's what our heavenly father has done he gave them something that would sustain him see they had no place to settle down a place to grow crops but but but but he would sustain them make sure that they had something to eat and think think when they come out the very first time that it fell listen what happened the first time that Mana fell in the wilderness the Bible says and they picked it up the priest and put an armful and kept it and reserved it for the priesthood God told him to go put it in the holies of holies this will be kept and throughout throughout all the ages every day that it would go bad that'd come out and they'd eat a little bit the next morning they'd had to have fresh Mana they'd eat a little bit the next morning they'd had to have fresh Mana this is what God was doing he was making the church depend on him he wasn't letting them go build up this is the way people like to go to church people like well just have church on Sunday and they don't have nothing to do with God for the rest of the week and we come back next Sunday and try to start all over again it's like this week toe relationship that people have with God but God put but he wouldn't allow them just to have something that would just go week to week he wanted to give them something that they could feed on every day and every morning they had to get up and go out and they had gather the food that God had prepared for I thank God that he put something out that we don't have to wait a week or week down the road or next weekend in order to be able to to be sustained but God gives us something every day that we can feed upon the word of God and they went out and they trust to the Lord they couldn't build it up that's what we want to do we want to build all all up so we can depend on oursel that's way we do with our money that's way that's way we we want to build everything up in case something goes bad and that's all good but God wants us to depend upon him he wants us daily to depend on him and they went out every morning and they gathered but but but in the holies of holies there was a basket full that was kept but says see when you come into this land this is what this is what the Bible said when you come into this land I want this om of of meal to be kept in this holy place that from now on that every priest that ever comes into the priesthood that he once he would come to this holy place after he was ordained to be a priest that he had a right to go in and take a mouthful of that original Mana original Mana that fell at the beginning and so here here here God would would would put this us up so that generation after generation that every priest would be able to taste of that original manner isn't that something it wasn't just a hand me down or something that you would pass down one from another but God put the original in there that when the priest it may have been a hundred years later but when a priest was ordained to the priesthood maybe he had been longing for it and thinking about it and his mind was on it my I wonder what it was like back then in the days uh when they come across the Wilderness and they ate that Mana from Heaven that that little sweet flavor that God had given them it was created by God I wonder what was like well you're ordained to be a priest and so so look what you have access to the holies of holies and that priest could walk in and take out of that little vessel a piece of that or or a little taste of that and put it in his mouth and taste the same thing that they tasted the very first day they were on Mount Si my isn't it something the first time you eat it it's always the best you go to a new eat a new steak it's always the best the first time now that was the best I ever ate but then after a little while sometimes it grows common to you hello sometimes you know you hear the same thing over and over and it grows common to you but hear what God Said but I'm going to put it in a place that's anointed I'm going to put it in an anointed place that you can come to in a 50 years down the road and you can go in there and you can take it and eat of it and when you feed on it you'll taste just like it did that very first day I thank God we ain't eating leftovers we a we ain't eating something that's lost its flavor it ain't lost its Savor in the mouth of the believer but I thank God we have something that still got the same power in it that God put in the beginning to see the priest could go in they could feed on it so why why you said see they could eat it said well what type do we have today said this is what this is what this means to us but M said you are a royal priesthood you're a holy nation You're A peculiar people making spiritual sacrifices unto God the fruit of your lips giving thanks to his name you are a royal priesthood so see we realize he said now then on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit was calling that was our mana and so every priest back there under the Old Testament they could come back and be a priest they knew they was going to get a mouth full of the original not some manmade way to look at it but they was going to get some of the original said see on the day of Pentecost when our Mana Begin to Fall my a't that good on the day of Pentecost our Mana Begin to Fall the Holy Ghost came in like a Russian Mighty W wind and here was a bunch of little dignified people in an upper room with the door shut but they were waiting on the promise of God and when the promise of God came they fed upon that Mana brother Wesley day after day they fed upon it and I thank God he said but I'm going to put it up in a place that you can have access to it in 2024 and I thank God we ain't got to go by 2,000 years ago in order to find that Mana but I but it's right here this morning the very same thing that the church fed on in the book of Acts is the same thing that the church has access to this morning he said that's what we want tonight if this little group of people could ever get in one Accord like like they was on that night the same thing would repeat tonight right here in this building you say why because he's still a sustainer he's still our satisfying portion in other words the Holy Ghost Mana that begin to fall on the day of Pentecost he said it was sent there to sustain the church and the church was to live only by the Holy Spirit until the day we enter into the Millennium ain't that wonderful that God would give us something to feed upon the holy spirit until the day that we enter into the Millennium that's what God has sent to the church see there's something about the fire of God last week we were talking about the Earth being baptized by fire and how that it took fire to come and cleanse the Earth from sin and from sickness and disease and germs and and Peril but said it would cleanse it from everything the Sinners the devil and all his group would be included he'd be cast into the Lake of Fire but that Holy Fire from God it comes down from God out of heaven and it burns it up to make it ready for God to dwell in for God in the new world that is to come is to dwell in the earth he said see because God dwells in the human heart but he and the bride become one and they go to their new home in the new world and that same Plan of Redemption that is used to redeem the Earth is the same Plan of Redemption that is used to redeem the people that are in the earth so if God is going to clean the Earth that way then that's the way he cleans every heart he DW before before God would dwell in a place it would have to be Sanctified it would have to be a cleansed place he say see before he could dwell in it it has to be a repented heart so the heart is repented it's baptized with water the in the name of Jesus Christ it's cleansed by the blood by accepting the sacrifice through our faith he said then the Holy Fire of the Holy Ghost from God it comes down and it burns all of the desire of sin and the nature of the world out of our life hello somebody is't that wonderful to think that the fire of God could come into the life of a human being and burn the desire of sin right out of our life and then when the desire is gone that's why the Bible would say that there it is impossible for a man that is born of God to commit sin right because the desire of sin has been burned out of their life said there's nothing in him in order to commit sin because the desire is burned out you see so how how can we be a sinner and be redeemed at the same time you remember the the story of the little boy that that went out and made himself a sailboat he went and he built it and done all the work and made it so pretty where it would sell then he went out into the Stream but David he he put it in the water and little little Storm come up and winds got to blow the stream got to moving fast and the little sailboat got away from him as it went down the stream he watched as he ran after it and couldn't get didn't had no access to it and down the stream it went disappeared off into that Big River few days later weeks down the road little boy he was walking in town he walked by a pawn shop he looked up in the pawn shop and there was that little sailboat that he had made you know the pawn shop owner you know somebody had gone out through there and they' found it took it to him and he he thought well I can make some profit off of this so he took it and he set it in a shop that little boy went in there said you know that that sailboat I there was something something about it I I made that I put my I put my time I put my effort I I made it with my own hands and he and he wanted it so bad but you realize the pawn shop owner see he had rights to it because it was in his shop and he had found it and it didn't have no identifying marks it didn't have no no way to be able to tie it to somebody else it was it was something that he had he had grasped and took a hold of and and and he had legal rights to be able to keep that sailo but he put it on the shelf so the little boy said well how much do you want for it you know I you know maybe maybe a couple dollars and so the little boy went home and he be to work and he done all the chores and everything he could do to save up all the the money that he could save up and he went back down to the pawn shop and he said you know I can't have it he said how much for the SBO man said it'll be $2 and he laid all his little coins on the desk and said I want toy by that but by that sailboat and the pawn chop owner took it and he put it back in his hands and the little boy as he goes out of the pawn chop and he's holding on to it and he and he looks at it he says you know little sailboat I'm the one that made you little sailboat I'm the one that lost you he said but little Sabo I bought you back now you're twice mine cuz I made you and I bought you I lost you but I redeemed you that's what happened between us and God he's our creator he made us he formed us from his own hands and in the the the the the the the storms of this world and the and the storms of Satan has took us out of the hands of God but he said they're still mine he came down and he paid the price on the cross of Calvary and he redeemed us back to himself he said I made you I formed you I lost you but I bought you back I've redeemed you and now you're twice mine we belong to God you see how can we be how can we belong to the to the world and belong to God that sailboat it didn't belong to the pawn shop owner any longer he had no to it anymore cuz a little boy had a receipt in his hand he said he may have found it he may have had a right to it he may have had a claim on it but I got a receipt where the debt was paid see you can't be a sinner and be redeemed at the same time you're either lost or you're saved you can't be both you can't still be you can't still be bound and still be lost in sin and been redeemed by God you're either a sinner or you're redeemed so see when God redeems you you belong to him there ain't no going back the devil ain't got no rights he lost all of his rights when he redeemed you he lost his rights to you said see he redeemed Us by his blood and by his Spirit he cleanses the church and he comes to dwell in US you say who is this church that God is going to dwell in well you notice when Moses was leading them out of Israel the Bible says that they were the people of God as long as they were in bondage they remained the people of God but the Bible said and you can you can you can read when they were called out by God Stephen preaches a a fine message in Acts the seventh chapter on it he said whenever they were called out by God step calls them he said that God took them out this was Moses that was with them it was Moses that was in the church in the wilderness so Stephen says see no longer was it a people of God but it was a Church of God said he said it was a church in the wilderness it wasn't a Wilderness people it was a Wilderness Church see there so there's what the church is is the church is a called out people but said see that's what that's what we are we're called out of God we're the PE they were the people of God but we became the Church of God because we were called out and that's the same thing that has happened to the believer today when God calls you out you become a part of the church think about that's what the church is it's the called out you say well what are we called out of we're called out of everything that's in this world we're called out of every religious cult every denomination every organization every all the thoughts of man we've been called out we've been called out of the bondage of Le oosa we've been called out of sin we've been called out by the message of the hour to a place that God can have communion with his church we're the called out of God we're the Church of the Living God see the church is the called out but you know whenever the Call Comes many refuse the call of God many refuse the call of God just like they did in the days of Moses this isn't a new thing Stephen said Moses was refused by the people still yet he was sent by God he was refused they would make statements and say who made you the ruler or the judge over us Moses after all you're just a man who made made you the judge over the people to be able to speak a voice this is what this is what Steven said they who made you the ruler he said but the same God sent him to be the ruler and the deliverer by the hand of the Angel which appeared unto him in the bush man ain't that good it wasn't the hand of Moses that delivered him from bondage it wasn't his own it wasn't Moses's staff that delivered him from bondage it wasn't Moses's power that delivered him from bondage but the Bible said it was the angel that appeared unto him in the burning bush and the Hand of that angel that appeared under the prophet the hand of the angel that gave him his commission by the hand of the Angel was the people delivered by the hand of the Angel was the power of God displayed over Egypt and judgment come upon the world it was the hand of the angel that gave the prophet his commission see it wasn't the man that done it anyway it was the hand of the angel that had commissioned him to go do the work it was the hand of the angel that done every Mighty work it's the hand of the angel that that performs Miracles the Bible said he brought them out after they had showed them wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for 40 years Stephen said this is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me and him shall he hear Now watch how Steven brings this all the way from the Old Testament all the way to where we are he said see a Prophet this Prophet that was called of God by the hand of the Angel they performed Mighty Miracles but here this Prophet said there's going to come another one godas ra up a prophet the Lord your God will raise up like your brethren like unto me him shall you hear and notice when this Prophet came I know this may stumble some but it's the gospel truth that Jesus was a prophet hello somebody I know they try to put that out and the these Spirit going around today trying to tell people there was no Prophet after John the Baptist it's a lie it come from the pits of Hell the truth is he was a prophet see Moses said he's coming he'll be a prophet he come after John the Baptist he was a prophet he knew he he was God in in a man formed the very the very gift of Prophecy the gift of priesthood everything that a man could be that God ever had was in that man Jesus Christ and this Prophet when he came he told his disciples I'm going to go and prepare a place for you and I'll come again and receive you unto myself that same Jesus now watch it goes from it goes from Moses are you with me goes from Moses all the way to Jesus and now watch what Jesus does with it he said that same Jesus he said Elijah shall come and he has come already and he goes on down to the next level and says to prepare the hearts of the people that there's going to be the spirit of Elijah that comes in the last day you realize what the spirit of Elijah was to come for it was to prepare the hearts of people to receive Christ isn't that what John the Baptist done Jesus said if you'll accept it this this John the Baptist that was the spirit of Elijah he said he has come and he shall come but what did it do it in it turned the hearts of people that they could receive Christ but notice and whenever he done this see it wasn't it wasn't meant it wasn't meant to turn you to a man it was meant to turn you to Christ this is what the spirit of Elijah is to do so many today got that so warped they got their minds are so warped and it turned them after following after a man that ain't what this is about at all but it was to turn the people their hearts to be able to to be able to receive Christ it was a soften their heart isn't that what Moses done he said sanctify yourself get prepared we're going to meet God what was he doing he was trying to get the people to a place that they could stand in the presence of God again a prophet like me shall come Jesus said but there come another what's he still doing turning the hearts of people getting them prepared to be in the presence of God again all the time here he says see the spirit of Elijah notice what the spirit of Elijah done John the Baptist had a great following a great ministry but brother Joe whenever Christ entered the scene he said Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world I had the decrease that Christ can increase he he he he he's the one it ain't it ain't nothing to do with me and all those followers that were following John the Baptist is't that like many men today they want a great following they want people following after them they want people building them up and building up their great name but but but that don't that don't mean nothing to any godall man what the reality is is that whenever he got a congregation when Christ on the came on the scene he said this is that Christ that we've been waiting on this is he he said see Behold the Lamb of God he pointed to Christ and Christ called them out of that old law and he called them to leave that former that old former belief and that former law and to follow him how many how many's been called out this morning we've been called out to walk with God you said well where are we going well we ain't looking for a natural land but been we ain't trying to build Grace Tabernacle we a we ain't calling everybody to Grace Tabernacle but we're trying to lead people into a spiritual Kingdom into a place that the world has no power over you any longer in the Kingdom of the Messiah a kingdom that didn't governed by man a kingdom that is governed by a bishop a kingdom that isn't governed by a pastor but it's covered by the Holy Ghost and Christ is the king of it this Messianic Kingdom this is where we're trying to lead people into oh friends don't you realize that we're looking that that we're coming into a kingdom that is led by the Holy Ghost entering into a kingdom that is led by the spirit of God isn't that something that that that that following the call of God you think about it a church that refuses to follow after a bunch of men and and a bunch of man-made religions it's the church that people say is manf followers ain't that something the whole church world is following after a manmade religion you can't find it in the Bible anywhere you can't find a one of them you can't find the name of them anywhere in the scripture every bit of it was created by man the whole church world is following after a man-made religion and you let a church rise up That'll Walk Away from man-made religion and say I want to follow Jesus Christ and he alone and the and Satan turns it and twists it and says we're your manf followers watch how he tries to deceive the people but it ain't the man that we're following we're not following after a man neither was they it wasn't Moses that they were following it was the power of God That Came Upon Moses and the Hand of the Angel of the Lord that worked through Moses that attracted the people to them that caused them to leave their homes and forsake everything that they have and walk out in the middle of a Wilderness said what is it we're following after it's the spirit of God it's the angel of the Lord the hand of the angel that is leading the church today it's the same hand of the same Angel that's still leading God's Church to see here we come out we're following the call of God this call Brother David that brought the supernatural back to the church again sir think about what had done what was this call for in this hour it was the return of the supernatural you realize that when they left Egypt and they saw these great miracles of god this Red Sea opened up all these great things that God done the pillar fire leading them but you realize that this that that that that wasn't the first time that the supernatural was done in Israel see it had been a while but it wasn't the first time see all the way back Abraham remember remember before they ever went to Egypt Abraham when he went out he took some trained servants and went out and defeated a whole bunch of Kings you tell me how he done it if it wasn't Supernatural he didn't have an army big enough to to defeat Kings but but but but by the supernatural by the hand of the Angel of the Lord he was able to overcome what was it that when when Abraham that went up on the mountain and he was going to sacrifice his own son but something placed a ram in the thicket when he turned around and said here here a ram just happened to be caught in the thicket what hand put the ram in the thicket it it was the hand of the Angel of the Lord that gave Abraham his commission he put an angel in the thicket what was it that took elaser when he went down and he began to pray and he said Lord let the woman say when I say can I again you give me something to drink let her say that not only will I give you something but I'll also water your camels Lord that I shall know and the Bible says as soon as he stopped praying he a woman come walking by the well he said he said can you give me something to drink she said not only will I give you something to drink but I'll Water all your campbel also she what was it it was the supernatural before they ever they came into this place of Egypt what in Joseph's life his entire life was a life of Supernatural he saw Visions he he saw dreams God done many of great work in Joseph's life all the way to the time he went into Egypt and and miracles and dreams and interpretations while he was living in Egypt all of this happened and then the children of Israel came into a place of bondage after all these many miracles and Supernatural then they come to this place of bondage and notice what happened this bondage it lasted for a certain time can we call it an age an age of bondage this time period of bondage that came upon the people but at the end of this age of bondage but David come the supernatural Again by in this good it was just kind of a just seemed like it had gone away for a little while you know here this few hundred years that they had gone through that you didn't there's not a lot of Miracles that you read about when they were in this land of Egypt but here but but but then all of a sudden as this time comes the supernatural begin to return and then when it to return to Israel it it it rose up and and power come back to the church brother Jared and as they come to to come out of this place you realize it wasn't the strength of their army it wasn't the strength of a man it was the power of a supernatural God that led them out of this land of Egypt and the Bible says but in the last days God will raise up a church so let me ask you this morning here's my question what do you think this church will be if God is going to raise up a church maybe you look at it and say well you know it looked like the church was down it look they went through the Dark Ages they certainly went through a period where it looked like the fire of God had gone out but what do you think's going to happen in the end time the Bible says I will restore sayeth the Lord and so when God come in this end time he's going to raise up a church in this last day's Church he'll raise up a church that has the same power that that first church had it'll be raised up a powerful Church it'll be raised up a supernatural Church it ain't going to be a powerless church I know what the devil tries to tell you that the church has lost its power you know why he does that cuz a lot of times you don't fight back in the middle of a battle and so the enemy says well you ain't got no power you're afraid to fight back won't you stand up and fight you're afraid to fight back but let me tell you a secret while we're here silence is no sign that that you have no power the children of Israel never moved until God LED them to move just because you don't fight back it don't it it's not a sign of weakness the Bible says vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord so because you don't fight back it don't make you to weak matter of fact it's a power that causes you to be able to stand and rely upon God but you me tell you what we do as Believers I I may as well preach it on here but we wait on the Lord you say what do you mean we wait we don't get ahead of God you a't get in trouble get ahead of God you a't get in trouble go solve your problems get ahead of God but we wait on the Lord because God knows all things waiting on God let me tell you when you're waiting on God it's not a sign of weakness when you're waiting on God it's not a sign of fear when you're waiting on God it's an act of courage to wait upon the Lord and allow God to move in the way he wants to but you think about this Israel they never fought until God said so you think but even when they're waiting on God listen what God says I I I love this can I read it do I have just a few minutes Deuteronomy 7 he said and thou shalt not be afraid of them for the Lord thy God is among you and he's Mighty and terrible God tells his people don't be afraid of them we're waiting we don't know what's about to happen there's a battle I know that we have to fight but don't be afraid of them for the Lord is among you and he's Mighty and terrible the whole time the enemy is still there they're thriving they're growing having children raising up an army but God says just wait but don't be afraid of them when you see them for the Lord your God is among you what's he doing he's building up faith God is among you he's fighting your battles you listen he covers every angle you know what God said he said don't go in there in a hurry and try to solve this yourself this is a word from the Lord don't go in want to hurry and try to solve this yourself but wait on the Lord because if you run them out the Beast of the field will take over you won't have the ability to be able to protect the land and the Beast of the field will take over and it'll destroy all of your livestock it'll kill you out so don't go in a hurry wait on the Lord he said and when the battle comes I'll send in Hornets to drive them out from before you and then you shall go in and take what belongs to you see there ain't no sense in getting in a hurry wait on the Lord he covers every angle you see so when we're waiting on God we're not we we're waiting on the Lord to come and see before they would ever go to the promised land notice what God gives here they're they're getting prepared and they're about to go to this place but the Bible says but when the Lord shall bring thee into the land when you go to possess it and has cast out all the nations before thee did you hear it when you go to the land of Bessa and he has cast out the Nations before thee you say well they were still there they were cast out but I still seen them but God said they was cast out but they were still Giants but God said they was cast out he said he has cast him out before you that means whenever you face him they're not going to be able to stand said he has cast him out before you you said yeah brother but Israel had a big army no wonder that that that that would happen you know after all there was two million there was two million men that was in that great Army you know there there was a great many of them but listen what the Bible says he said but when he's cast him out before you the Hittites and gites and amorites and Canaanites and perizzites and hivites and jebusites Seven Nations that are greater and mightier than thou right listen listen they weren't greater than the ones they were going to fight the Bible says every one of those nations were greater and mightier than the children of Israel but God said but when you go to possess it I'll cast them out before you they're bigger enemy but when you go to possess it I'll cast them out before you I'm not going to be able to overtake them but when you go to possess it I'll cast them out before you friends don't you realize God didn't choose them to be victorious because of their power he didn't choose them to be victorious because of their skill or because of how many there was and God didn't choose you because your strength or because of your power or because of your widths or your mind it had nothing to do with you but the Bible says he chose them he said I didn't choose you because you were greater or because you were more people because you're the fewest of all I didn't choose you because you were big I didn't choose you because you were strong he said but I want you to let the people know that I chose you because I loved you I chose you because I love you and I'll drive your enemy out before you God taking a way for the children of God to possess the promise that he had given to them he said know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God he's faithful which keepeth the Covenant of Mercy to them that love him and keeps his Commandments but listen the whole promise of God it was a victory this whole promise it was a victory there's coming a victory when you get to this land of possession this is way before they ever entered into this land or came to the came to the Border but when you get there I'll drive them out when you get there you'll overcome when you get there the enemy will be be gone when you get there the Hornets are going to come I'm going to push them out years before they ever come to the battle but then there Comes A Time For The Carter of possession see they had this promise the whole time that when we come to this battle can you imagine the faith they had going over there my God said when we get there he's going to drive them out we're going to whoop them they that devil ain't got a chance you just wait till I get out you just bring on the battle devil you just wait till I get him right in my sides boy I'm going to wear him out see it was the promise but then when it came the time to take the possession of it they sent the spies in to spy out the land the majority of the people heard a negative report from 10 spies only two of them came back and said they could still take it they forgot the promise of God and they looked at all the things that was going on and 10 of them come back and said this is impossible task we ain't going to be I don't I don't know where y'all getting this Theory but we're going to be able to take this we can't get a the there's Giants in this land we can't take it but then there was two that was not looking at the things that was going on in the land they wern't looking at the Giants and the impossibility of the task but they looked at the promise of God he said but the word says we'll take it and we're going to take it Caleb said I may be old man but I'm going to get my Mountain said it belongs to me God has promised us our possession but you notice notice what God does when they saw how great the battle was they actually were distressed they got in fear they were perplexed about it is that the way we do when we've had a promise of God the Bible says in the last days perilous times shall come it's been a promise all along but then when perilous time comes people lose Faith they stop they stop serving God they they they they turn their back I this is impossible I I don't see how there could be a Rapture anyway while the world look at the condition of the world how can it get any worse than this I think it's going to go on forever and it's never going to end but the Bible said here's a promise it's coming to this time and at this time many will turn away and they'll turn their their back on God you see perilous times have come people get scared and when the when the when the promise is fulfilled when it comes to the time of possession here here they're they're supposed to be holding on to a promise and people turned their back on God and they left the they left the word and then the devil tries to tell you you're going to follow right along with them but I think there ought to be a spy to raise up and say but God said he said that this will happen he said we'd come to this land he said there'd be perilous times he said people would turn their back he said there'd be scoffers he said there' be Skeptics he said there'd be persecutors but he said we'll still overcome there got to be somebody that'll take the word of God and stand on the promise of God in this age in the last days there had to be somebody that would say but the Lord will surely Deliver Us you watch it doubt and fear entered their hearts until most of them had lost all their faith their ability to be able to enter in but notice what God does here they're on the brink of their possession can I hurry come on please they're on the brink of their possession they're on the they're on the border after all these years of holding on to a promise of God here they're on the brink of possession and the Bible says at this time at the time of possession can I say it like like this at the time of inheritance here they're on the the brink of this inheritance listen what the Bible says when you go out to the battle against your enemies and you see horses and chariots and people more than you be not afraid of them for the Lord thy God is with thee which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt here God puts that the enemy is going to be great it'll be big it'll it'll it'll seem impossible it'll be a impossible task but don't be afraid of them for the god that brought you out of the land of Egypt show be with you and it shall be when you come now under the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people and say unto them here oh Israel you approach this day un battle against your enemy let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble neither be terrified because of them for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight with you against your enemies and to save you man ain't that good at the time of the greatest battles that we ever face the greatest battle here the time to be able to B possess something don't you realize why Satan fights you and these young people why he fights these young people because they're at this time of possession at a time of inheritance on the on the brink of a possession of of the of the promise of God in this hour the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Satan would fight it any young believer that could testify any any any of the saints that could testify this morning that when it come to that time of receiving the Holy Ghost it was the greatest battle you ever fought to turn how manyan testify there great battle go ahead and lift your hand let somebody see all over the building it was a time of great battle in your flesh because you're wanting to receive a promise of God that's when Satan Wars on you the most when you're trying to move further with God Satan's Waring against you it's a sign that that he's afraid of what you're going to what you're going to get say see but they come to this place the greatest battle they ever would face and notice what God done the Bible said but the priest would come and speak unto them isn't that wonderful here in the middle of a great battle this is the promise of God that I'm going to send a minister to speak to you in the time when you feel like that you cannot you can't go another step further I'm going to send a minister to speak to you this is what God told Moses to do because I know it's going to be a battle and they're going to need faith and they're they're going to need the the ability to take that next step why they wouldn't take a step over into that land he said but I'm going to send a minister to preach to you and that Minister he's going to say you approach this day unto battle against your enemy but don't let your heart fail don't tremble fear not neither be ter IED because of them for the Lord your God goes with you to fight with you for you against your enemies and he will save you I'm going to send a minister to tell you that in the time of a battle fear not do not tremble fear not brother Morgan don't tremble for I will go before you I will fight for you and I'll save you you see what the minister was for brother Jared the minister was sent to preach the prophet promise of God he was sent to preach it wasn't to preach fear and confusion I I know I've about run out of time but there's all kinds of things that people preach today but that ain't what a god- calleded minister supposed to do he's supposed to preach the promise of God he's supposed to bring the faith of God to the people and to let them know who God is and the promise that God has given to the church and to lead the church into their possession that's what a God called preacher is supposed to do to lead you into the promise that God has given unto you brother said you mark my word he said there's Great Men on the road to this world there's great powers on the road to this world and it'll be a people that'll call out of people ain't that something great men of power you say what power it's a godall people led by the spirit of God Leading the People out of all these things they lead them out of bickerin and confusions lead them back to Faith and back to the power of God he said but thank God in the last age there will be a group rise up the true Bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit of God and in that day of gross Darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ isn't that a promise for the church today that in that last day in that last age we will return to the power of Pentecost and welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ you got to think about this Pentecost as the musicians to come you realize that this Pentecost or this this this age of the Holy Ghost it's not it's not just a word but it's actually an age the Pentecost Pentecost is an age it was the time of the Holy Ghost but said see at the end of each age another age would come ushering in a new age remember at the end of at the end of just skipped to the at the end of sanctification the Pentecostal age had ushered in so Pentecost came in and then it ushered in the baptism of the Holy Ghost you say what was it it was the same thing that happened on the book of Acts and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were in one Accord in one place and they appeared un them like clothing tongues as fire it set on them they were filled with the Holy Ghost and they spoke with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance a't that something I know what the world took it and twisted up but when you receive the Holy Ghost then you'll you'll speak with tongues so the church World they go around and bang people on the chin and all this stuff when they come up to the altar I've been to Pentecostal churches I've been sitting in the back and a good friend of mine he's a Pentecostal pastor and we went to a big meeting out in Texas one time and I was over in that area he said won't you come hear me preach I said okay I will I went by and the poor sincere people back there in the in the back and really needing something from the Lord come up the altar ladies up there banging him on the chin trying to get them to speaking tongues and nonsense I thought the sad thing is that they sincerely needed something from the Lord there really was something in their heart they were they were longing for something but they thought well if I can't get them to speak in tongues well they never got nothing you see how it got all twisted but that wasn't what that was you see in the book of Acts you say well that's what the book of Acts says they came out and spoke with in other tongues but listen what the Bible says at that time can I finish this at that time in Jerusalem was a devout men out of every nation under the heaven I won't read them all but every nation was represented in Jerusalem and the Bible said when when this it was noise abroad that the multitude came together and they were confounded when they come out of the upper room and they were speaking in unknown tongues the Bible said they were confounded because every man heard them speak in his own language and they were amazed and they marveled and they said one to another are these not all which speak galileans then how do we hear every man in our own tongue where wherein that we were born in other words we do hear the them speak in our tongues what were they hearing they were hearing the Bible says they heard them speak of the wonderful works of God isn't it something so the miracle of Pentecost it wasn't that they spoke in tongues like the world has made it the miracle of Pentecost is that every man heard in his own language the wonderful works of God the works of God and here they were each one represented in this whole body of people and they heard when they come out of the upper room some was speaking in Persian someone speaking in the me someone speaking in in Galilean someone they were all speaking a different language testifying of the wonderful works of God I thought my a it something to hear the Bible said because God had told them that the repentance and the remission of sins should be preached in my name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem this is what Jesus told the disciples so when they come out of the upper room they fulfill the commission of Jesus by testifying everyone in his own language everyone heard in his own language and right there beginning at Jerusalem the Gospel of Jesus Christ be began to be preached it's no wonder they spoke with tongues they were fulfilling the words of Jesus the message you think about this message it was being preached for the first time out of the mouth of 120 Holy Ghost filled men and women declaring the resurrection of Jesus Christ and brother maram said see it had to be testified in every language of the resurrection of Christ so it would go to all the world right there and these carriers here these people in here worshippers would go back into their own country I isn't that something brother Jared it was worshippers that went to preach and to spread the message before there was ever a so one he said these worshippers my makes me want to shout these worshippers spread the gospel these worshippers they would go back to their own country before a soul was one before a minister ever preached before there was a sermon that was ever preached they were first worshippers you see before you say I want to do something for God I'm going to preach I I'm going to do but before you can ever be a preacher you must first be a worshipper I want to be a deacon I I want to serve the Lord I want to I want to help and House of God I want God to accept my My Sacrifice but before you can do anything from God for God you must first be a worshipper see that worship is how you recognize the deity of Jesus Christ you remember when Jesus was just a child the Bible said and the three wise men when they found him they fell down before him and worship him even as a child and they open their Treasures the Bible said they opened their treasures and they gave him frankincense and gold and myrr gold think about it which represented deity and frankincense which is our service or sacrifice that a preach would make myr which was used in death the B said see it showed that deity would be put to death that he might redeem a fallen man but they came to worship Him think of it to recognize his deity they come to worship Him and the Bible says and they opened their treasures and gave to him glory you say brother M I don't have gold I have no frankincense I have no myrr I really have no gold to give what can I give to God let me tell you what you can do there's a deity in you that you can offer God you believe that there's a sacrifice there's a service and and time that you have sacrifices that you can offer unto God and there's even a death of the flesh that you can offer unto him say see you may not have gold and frankincense and myrr but brother B said I want to offer myself to God and all that I have in myself that God will give me in this life I want to dedicate it to him aresh upon the manger of the word that is in my heart I worship Him may you stand to your feet this morning you say brother man mat I want to give it to him all that I have in my life and frankincense and golden myr Lord let me die out to this flesh Lord let me give all that I have to you don't you realize friends that before you could ever do a service for God you must first become a worshipper every great man in the scripture before he done something from God Moses when he came into the presence of God Brother David he took off his shoes to show his humility in the presence of almighty God Solomon the great king of Israel he built a pull pit among all of his people he a great and mighty king when they come in before Solomon they would nap bow down on their knees because Solomon was the greatest King that had ever lived but in the presence of the people you know what Solomon done the Bible said he made a pull pit and he knelt down on his knees and he lifted his hands in the air and he said I want my people to know that there's a God that is greater than I and I worship him and all that I have and all that I gain in this Kingdom I give it back to him I belong to him he made me he's greater than I Great Men worship God Great Men great women what identifies them as great they worship God they're worshippers before they ever do anything great David was a great king he said I'll bless the Lord at all times I'll praise him with my mouth he's a worshipper I'm going to be a preacher first be a worshipper who wants to hear a preacher that ain't a worshipper who wants to hear a testimony from a person that's not a worshipper I want a true worshipper if you're going to speak and Lead God's people and help and sing you say I want to sing in the church you first be a worshipper I want to use my gift be a worshiper and give everything to God and then let God use you let him use what you what you give him we don't have a lot to offer anyway but in the hands of the Angel it becomes a mighty power Lord I give it to you use it for your glory Lord my strength I give to you use it for your glory Lord my my my time my money my effort Lord I give it to you use it for your glory you've gave it to me I give it all back to you this morning is there a worshipper here and say Lord I give to you I may be down I may be going through some trials but Lord I come to worship you this morning we're worshippers Great Men the disciples they worshiped him said well that kind of leavs me out no it don't sister when they came out of the Tomb when they come out of the Tomb you remember the little sisters that went down to find him the Bible says when they came into his presence they fell down and worshiped him and he received their worship when they when they came to the multitude coming down out of the Mount of Olives the whole multitude worshiping see the the the the men did it the women done it the multitude the congregation done it that includes everybody there ain't not one of us left out they worship god brother Bram said this is what it is he said in the old days you'd lay your hands on that sacrifice knowing you're were a sinner he said and it identified the worshipper with his sacrifice and the priest came and he killed it and he caught the blood and the worshipper sincerely know one he said that's what God required of him he worshiped he he could he could go back to God cuz he knew he had met God's requirements said but what's your requirement this morning if God gave them a requirement then our requirement is to worship him it's to give the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving from our lips it's our requir M to lift our hand to God it's our requirement you think oh oh the pride that people have that a King Solomon that was the greatest and most wealthy man in the world would kneel down on his knees before a Congregation of people and say I give my all to God can you imagine how the pride must have left him to think if a king could go down on his knees before God and how much how much more ought I worship Him might I just give him my all it's Pentecost it's a call to worship it's a call to Holiness it's a call uh to come back to God you say what about us today that's our requirement we don't have a we don't have a lamb to lay our hands on Brother David but we can put our hands on the sacrifice place our hands on the sacrifice that's already been made and the Bible said the worshipper is identified with the sacrifice that he's touching don't you see it friends put your hands on the right thing put your hands on the clean thing hello somebody take your hands off the unclean clean and put it on the clean it's a call to Holiness take it off don't don't touch the filthy things the things of the world leave them alone and put your hand up on the sacrifice again and worship Him worship Him Lord I give it to you worship him back to the sacrifice let the power of Pentecost fall upon you again listen what Peter said he said you pilgrims and strangers you gentile people he took all of what Moses taught he said but you are a chosen generation these pilgrims and strangers that we become he said but you they've become a royal priesthood and a holy nation You're A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called called you out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light in times past you were not a people but you are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now you have obtained mercy no wonder we freely give it's the mercy of God that called us out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light that's why I can lift my hands this morning brother Jared that's why I can lift my hands say Lord I love you Lord I I I give praise unto thy name it's your mercy Lord that came to me when I didn't deserve it Lord you called me in my in the selfishness of My Flesh but you called me back to Pentecost again you called me to have an an experience with you Lord you brought me to this place and I come to Worship You amen won't you bow your heads and close your eyes this

you just look at the men look at the stories the stories the scriptures is just something of old or does it still mean something to you it's a call to worship as a pastor this morning I lift my hand said Lord I I hear the call God before our congregation here this morning God I pray Lord that you would help me to be an example of what a true worshipper is God let my life be a life of Holiness Lord let me be a real a real test testimony of Pentecost God may we display the life of Jesus Christ Lord God each mother Lord May there be a testimony God every father every man and woman God we come
