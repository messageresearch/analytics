[42:54] Somebody Like Me Maybe that's unworthy
[42:56] to be here
[42:58] but if he could speak then there's not a
[43:00] not a demon in hell that could stand in
[43:02] the way of of what he says tonight you
[43:04] believe that and so without without ad

[47:35] would be of all men most hopeless and I
[47:37] would be I I would be a man that would

[47:42] saw me in my darkest hour and he chose
[47:44] to come to me I didn't come looking for
[47:46] him but he came looking for me can you
[47:48] say Amen tonight well that's not in my
[47:50] sermon or my notes but we'll just get
[47:52] right on into it tonight and if you have
[47:54] your Bibles it's numbers 20 and verse S
[47:57] I want to say uh I want to thank brother
[47:59] Matt for the opportunity to stand here
[48:01] tonight and the confidence to allow
[48:03] allow me to be here this evening and I
[48:05] sure appreciate all of your fellowship
[48:07] uh for the meetings and stuff that yall
[48:08] Put on We we enjoy it and uh we also
[48:11] appreciate when you come and fellowship
[48:12] with us so we kind of feel like this is
[48:14] our sister church and so uh we we love
[48:17] you all and I know that you all love us
[48:19] too so we we really do appreciate that
[48:22] and a place to come and and have
[48:23] meetings with people that will just just
[48:25] have church you know that's that's fun
[48:27] to come and just have church and them
[48:28] tent meetings I tell you what you know I
[48:31] don't know your plans but I hope you
[48:32] don't quit having them because I really
[48:33] like those tent meetings and and so put
[48:36] a little pressure on your pastor there
[48:37] for that one Numbers Chapter 20 and
[48:40] verse 7 and the Lord spake unto Moses
[48:42] saying take the rod and gather thou the
[48:45] assembly together thou and Aaron thy
[48:47] brother and speak ye unto the rock
[48:49] before their eyes and it shall give
[48:52] forth his water and thou shalt bring
[48:54] forth to them water out of the rocks so
[48:58] Thou shalt give the congregation and
[49:00] their beasts drink and one more that I
[49:03] didn't give you brother up there is
[49:05] Matthew it's Matthew chapter 8 and we're
[49:08] going to start with verse
[49:11] five Matthew chapter 8 and verse
[49:16] 5 and when Jesus was entered into
[49:19] capernium there came unto him a
[49:21] centurion beseeching him and saying Lord
[49:24] my servant lith at home sick of the
[49:26] Paul's
[49:27] grievously tormented and Jesus saith
[49:29] unto him I will come and heal him and
[49:32] the Centurion answered and said Lord I'm
[49:34] not worthy that thou should come under
[49:36] my roof but speak the word only and my
[49:39] servant shall be healed you may be
[49:41] seated this evening may the Lord add His
[49:43] blessings to the reading of the word
[49:45] just in the thoughts here this evening
[49:47] if I could have a thought I would call
[49:49] it on the authority of the word of the
[49:50] Lord on the authority of the word of God
[49:53] and I would just say it like this you
[49:54] know there's a difference in power and
[49:56] authority we've been given Authority uh
[49:58] by by by a supernatural power in this
[50:01] day but we don't have so much power in
[50:03] ourselves you know if you're looking to
[50:05] me for power I may not have any power
[50:06] brother Mark but we have an authority to
[50:08] speak because of the word that we've
[50:10] been given and so you know you can you
[50:13] could have the you can have the power to
[50:14] go beat down a door but if you don't
[50:16] have if you don't have the key then you
[50:17] don't have the authority to be there but
[50:19] if you have been given the key then you
[50:21] can possess what's in behind the door
[50:23] why is that because you've been given
[50:25] authority to go into the Promises of God
[50:27] so if you have the key and I believe we
[50:29] have the key this evening I believe
[50:31] believe I believe we've been given a key
[50:33] I believe we have everything we need to
[50:35] make a Rapture I believe we have a key
[50:37] to open every door if it's a if it's a
[50:39] door that's been locked by sickness just
[50:41] put the key in of faith and open that
[50:43] door and there's healing on the other
[50:44] side of the door so what you have is
[50:46] authority to speak the word and go
[50:49] forward nothing can stop you no door can
[50:51] stop you because you have the key no
[50:53] nothing can stop you that Satan would
[50:55] put in your way no chain can stop you
[50:58] there there's nothing can stop you why
[50:59] because you've been given Authority you
[51:01] are a people of authority well can
[51:03] somebody say Amen you have authority
[51:05] tonight it is not it is not a power that
[51:08] has come from a man but it is a power
[51:10] that come from God that has given us
[51:11] Authority and brother Brandon would say
[51:13] it like this just to lay a background he
[51:15] said as a mortal being knowing that I
[51:17] have no power within myself that's a
[51:19] prophet speaking I have no power I don't
[51:22] have power to stop you I don't have
[51:23] power to make any of these we these
[51:25] women clean up I don't have power to
[51:27] make these men clean up that's listening
[51:28] to this tape or wherever I have no way
[51:30] of making them clean up I'm powerless
[51:33] but I do have the authority of God's
[51:35] word as a servant to preach it and I'm
[51:38] Duty bound to that Authority can you say
[51:40] Amen neither this policeman out here he
[51:42] tells a story the little policeman he
[51:43] don't have power to stop the car but
[51:45] that badge gave him an authority to put
[51:47] his hand up and stop the car didn't M no
[51:49] matter how big that devil is that's
[51:51] coming after you the word of God has
[51:53] given you an authority to to put your
[51:55] back put your hand up and say you know
[51:56] what you may come against me but you
[51:58] cannot Prosper because no weapon formed
[52:01] against me can prosper you say how can
[52:04] you say that on the authority of the
[52:06] word of God everything that's in the
[52:08] Bible everything that's in this message
[52:10] that's my authority to
[52:12] speak it's not good enough just to say
[52:15] well it was good for brother Brandon
[52:16] it's not good enough to say well it's
[52:18] good enough for the Bible days no it's
[52:19] got to be it's got to be a present day
[52:21] Authority it's got to be something for
[52:23] the people today we are living in a bad
[52:25] time we are living in an age where the
[52:27] world is in chaos but for the bride you
[52:30] have an authority to overcome in this
[52:33] hour that we're living in you don't have
[52:35] to worry about where your meals are
[52:36] coming from because he promised to feed
[52:38] you you don't have to worry about where
[52:40] your healing is coming from because he
[52:41] promised in his word do you realize who
[52:44] you are you are a people of Promise
[52:46] living in a land of promise and you have
[52:48] authority you know them grapes were for
[52:50] everybody but they were for the ones
[52:52] that would go over and when the Giants
[52:54] were in their way they didn't care about
[52:55] no Giants they wanted to benefit from
[52:57] the fruits of the land why because they
[52:59] knew that if they were marching in God's
[53:02] in God's Army then God would go before
[53:04] him no giant could stop him well come on
[53:06] somebody nothing can stop the Church of
[53:09] God nothing can stop this bride because
[53:12] we have been given authority to overcome
[53:14] every devil and every sickness and every
[53:17] disease everything that would come
[53:19] against us chains may be put on you
[53:21] tonight but you have the authority to
[53:23] speak and those chains will fall off of
[53:25] you
[53:27] well if a certain preacher would come by
[53:28] or if a certain person would come by no
[53:30] you have the authority to speak I'm not
[53:33] worthy that would you would come under
[53:34] my roof but I know you would Jesus said
[53:37] I'll come and heal you no but I'm not
[53:39] even worthy that you would come under my
[53:40] roof but I know you're good and you'll
[53:43] do it anyway he don't have to show up in
[53:45] this service tonight but he did it
[53:47] anyway I'm not worthy that he would come
[53:50] and and let me stand before you people
[53:52] but he but he put me here to speak the
[53:54] word of God to you and that word is an
[53:57] authority that if you have a problem
[53:59] here tonight just grab a hold of that
[54:01] word and you can leave free you can
[54:03] leave healed you can leave perfectly
[54:05] whole and a total Deliverance is yours
[54:08] tonight everything you need is in this
[54:10] message how many beli that tonight
[54:12] everything you need every everything you
[54:15] need to make a Rapture is already here
[54:19] I'm not waiting on a I'm not waiting on
[54:21] the prophet to come back I'm not waiting
[54:22] on nothing else to happen I know what I
[54:24] know in whom I have believed and he is
[54:26] more than able to keep that which he has
[54:29] promised he's more than
[54:32] able when he told Moses he said speak to
[54:35] the Rock don't Smite it he said that
[54:37] meant speak don't Smite it you see
[54:40] you've got to obey what he says do no
[54:44] man can do nothing in himself he's got
[54:46] to hear it first from God yes sir you
[54:48] can't do this on your own if you're
[54:50] trying to make it on your own you're
[54:51] just I tell you what you're just another
[54:53] sinner that's trying to make it on their
[54:55] own you're just another person trying to
[54:56] make it on your own works but it's by
[54:58] grace that you're here tonight and by
[55:00] Grace he showed you a message that in
[55:03] this message is the
[55:05] potential for all things but you've got
[55:08] to accept it you've been pardoned you've
[55:10] been given the land you you've been made
[55:12] free but you've got to come and accept
[55:14] it as your Authority here tonight yes
[55:17] sir well can the church say Amen brother
[55:20] Bram says like this I just want to lay
[55:22] this background before I lose my all my
[55:24] time the days that he brought Israel out
[55:26] he had one man and that was Moses and
[55:28] brother R says he always deals with one
[55:30] man how many knows that to be true he
[55:32] said there was daythan and many others
[55:34] that tried to think well they had the
[55:35] same Authority and so forth he said you
[55:37] know what happened to them the days of
[55:39] the coming of the Lord the days of John
[55:40] the Baptist and the different ones he
[55:42] has one individual he works with and he
[55:44] deals with us today as one individual
[55:47] and not as a group well so when you look
[55:49] around say well the church has got
[55:50] problems no no no what about
[55:53] you see we've got to O overcome as an
[55:55] individual
[55:56] it's good to see the church on fire but
[55:58] when you are getting cold it's nice to
[56:01] sit in a church where the fires are
[56:02] glowing and it's hot but if you're cold
[56:06] then you need a checkup tonight it's not
[56:08] about what I tell you what I love to go
[56:10] into a church that's on Revival it's in
[56:12] Revival but let me tell you something
[56:13] don't look at them and say well I'm
[56:15] going to get warmed off of their their
[56:17] Revival I'm going to get war no no no
[56:18] you got to have a Revival yourself
[56:21] you've got to recognize the word has
[56:22] come for you individually
[56:26] you have no authority to go in on
[56:27] somebody else's experience but you have
[56:30] authority when you met God I tell you
[56:33] Moses had no authority to go into Egypt
[56:36] and Conquer Pharaoh he had no authority
[56:38] to go down there he had no Authority at
[56:40] all until he heard a
[56:42] voice he heard a voice that said go down
[56:44] there and I'll be with you and take care
[56:47] and and let me tell you something when
[56:48] you stay in the will of God then you
[56:51] have authority can somebody say Amen you
[56:54] have authority to overcome every
[56:56] obstacle that would come against you and
[56:58] so what I would say tonight it is even
[57:00] though Moses was 80 years old even
[57:02] though Moses didn't look like he had any
[57:03] power even though Moses didn't look like
[57:05] he had any Authority he was given a
[57:08] god-given Authority by a voice that he
[57:10] heard well I wish somebody to hear me
[57:12] tonight he had heard a voice and he
[57:14] didn't just say well the voice is in the
[57:16] wilderness go talk to him sir and he'll
[57:18] speak for me no now Moses had something
[57:21] to
[57:22] do there's too many of us living in the
[57:24] past too many of us wait when brother
[57:25] Brandon
[57:26] if brother Brandon was here brother
[57:28] brand no no no he's given you the
[57:30] authority he's given you a voice you are
[57:33] the final voice to the final
[57:36] age you've been given that Authority
[57:39] we're not waiting on something else to
[57:40] give us Authority The Authority is here
[57:42] the word has come the open book's here
[57:45] eat the book and speak the words of Life
[57:47] over your family speak it over your
[57:49] children well I wish somebody preach
[57:50] with me tonight you have the authority
[57:52] to
[57:53] speak it's not about me it's not about
[57:56] you brother Matt don't have the
[57:57] authority to build a church here but but
[57:59] not not on his own but God told him to
[58:02] do it and under that Authority he don't
[58:05] have to worry about the winds blowing
[58:06] this way and the winds blowing that way
[58:08] if you're under the authority of the
[58:10] word of God you can go forward you don't
[58:14] have to fear you don't have to worry
[58:17] because God said
[58:18] so how many believes that
[58:21] tonight brother R says it like this he
[58:24] says he says let me get down here he
[58:27] said all that was in God was poured out
[58:29] into Christ all that was in Christ was
[58:31] emptied out into the believer the church
[58:34] God is with you he said Lo I'm with you
[58:36] always even to the end of the world
[58:37] that's the Declaration of God's word and
[58:40] that's what the Bible says and brother
[58:42] brand says that's what I believe so you
[58:44] say I'm walking this alone you're never
[58:46] alone you can be by yourself and you're
[58:48] never alone if you're a Believer and
[58:50] you've accepted this end time message
[58:52] and and you've and you've experienced
[58:53] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you've
[58:55] had the Seal of God on your life listen
[58:57] you're not alone and you're stronger
[58:59] than any army in the world even by
[59:03] yourself well I need somebody with me I
[59:05] need somebody on my side God's on your
[59:07] side you don't have to fear imagine
[59:11] Moses going down there they've got the
[59:13] finest armies they've got chariots and
[59:16] he's walking down there with a
[59:18] stick does that look like I tell you
[59:20] what that makes no sense to this world
[59:23] that makes no sense to me in my carnal
[59:25] mind that makes makes no sense to any of
[59:27] you in your carnal mind but because you
[59:28] heard the word and you believe the word
[59:31] then you know all things are possible
[59:34] with God so you know it wasn't an old
[59:36] 80-year-old man walking down there but
[59:38] God was in that man God was using that
[59:41] man and you may not have the strength to
[59:43] walk out that door tonight but God is
[59:45] with you withs soever thou goest
[59:48] everywhere The Souls of your feet with
[59:50] tread God is there and he is always with
[59:53] you brother B uses it and Matthew 28 he
[59:57] quotes 28 Matthew 28:20 teaching them to
[1:00:00] observe all things after the commission
[1:00:01] whatsoever I have commanded you and lo
[1:00:03] I'm with you always even unto the end of
[1:00:04] the world the end of the world is not
[1:00:05] here so he's still with
[1:00:08] you I tell you what we we get out of the
[1:00:11] word and we get out from under our
[1:00:12] Authority and that's when bad things
[1:00:14] start to happen to us I'm not talking
[1:00:16] about I'm not talking about people
[1:00:17] saying well you're a secret sinner no
[1:00:19] I'm saying you have no you have no
[1:00:20] ability to have faith because you have
[1:00:23] no word to back you up but when the word
[1:00:25] backs you up you can stand there and say
[1:00:28] you know what you can say what you want
[1:00:30] to you can call me a Holy Roller you can
[1:00:32] call me a fanatic you can call me
[1:00:34] anything but when the roll is Called Up
[1:00:37] Yonder call me
[1:00:39] gone why because I ain't going to be
[1:00:41] here to worry about no tribulation time
[1:00:43] I ain't going to be here to worry about
[1:00:45] I I I tell you what I'm not stalking up
[1:00:47] I'm not getting ready for no tribulation
[1:00:49] because I have no intentions on being
[1:00:51] here in the tribulation because a
[1:00:53] prophet said well a prophet said and
[1:00:56] that's my authority he said before one
[1:00:58] drop of fire could fall then we have to
[1:01:01] be gone and before one bomb could be
[1:01:03] released he said we'll be caught up we
[1:01:05] we may be looking back down at it
[1:01:07] happening but we will not be here to go
[1:01:09] through the fires of
[1:01:11] tribulation you might as well kick that
[1:01:13] devil while you're here because if the
[1:01:15] devil's telling you I may have to go
[1:01:16] through a tribulation buddy know that's
[1:01:18] wrong that's absolutely false you don't
[1:01:21] need to why would you ever take that why
[1:01:23] would you take that as your absolute why
[1:01:25] would why would you take that as your
[1:01:26] word why would you believe something
[1:01:28] like that when the Bible says you have a
[1:01:31] promise when the when the Bible speaks
[1:01:33] about a second coming when the Bible
[1:01:35] speaks about a coming about a body
[1:01:37] change when the prophet would come and
[1:01:39] say in the moment in the twinkling of an
[1:01:41] eye we'll be caught up that's what I
[1:01:44] want to believe why because it's in the
[1:01:46] word I have authority to believe that
[1:01:48] and there's going to be a generation I
[1:01:50] don't believe it's going to be long I
[1:01:51] believe it's going to be a young
[1:01:52] generation of people here tonight and
[1:01:54] maybe some old ones too that will not
[1:01:56] taste death but you'll see the coming of
[1:01:57] the
[1:01:58] Lord you ain't got to worry about death
[1:02:01] anyway because death is just a changing
[1:02:03] of that body anyway one way or another
[1:02:06] we're all going to have a body change if
[1:02:08] you're in Christ you well I wish
[1:02:10] somebody would say Amen now if you're in
[1:02:13] Christ there is nothing can stop you
[1:02:16] from a body
[1:02:17] change it's your Authority that's your
[1:02:20] word Authority brother Mark that's your
[1:02:22] word Authority you ain't always got to
[1:02:23] look like that it's your word Authority
[1:02:25] that you're going to have a body
[1:02:29] change some of us are ready a little
[1:02:31] quicker than others right some of us are
[1:02:33] like Lord come quickly because I can't
[1:02:36] live in this body forever I told my
[1:02:38] brother that the other day I had to pick
[1:02:39] on you cuz he wasn't sitting there but I
[1:02:41] said when you start looking like Ben and
[1:02:42] I you're ready for a body
[1:02:45] change well we're all ready because on
[1:02:48] your best days on your best days you're
[1:02:51] in a body of Flesh fighting three kinds
[1:02:54] of Believers or the Believers fighting
[1:02:56] the other two or the unbeliever I'll
[1:02:58] tell you what it's just it's just a rat
[1:03:00] race it's just the the you know the
[1:03:02] wheels are spinning but the hamster's
[1:03:03] dead it's just it's just like a vicious
[1:03:05] circle you just keep going and and all
[1:03:08] you can think is this think about it
[1:03:10] think about it on your best
[1:03:12] day brother Matt you're worth about 84
[1:03:14] cents because you weigh about 150
[1:03:17] PBS I'm I'm worth more than brother
[1:03:22] Matt but on your best day that's all you
[1:03:24] are I'm talking about the flesh man
[1:03:28] that's all you are that's all I am is
[1:03:31] flesh but God doesn't even see you like
[1:03:34] that what God sees is a is a Perfection
[1:03:39] well can you say am man because he's
[1:03:40] looking at a sinful nature but he's
[1:03:42] looking at it through the blood and he
[1:03:44] sees Perfection over your
[1:03:47] life I have authority to be perfected
[1:03:51] under the word of the
[1:03:53] hour well I hope you're following me so
[1:03:55] far
[1:03:56] I want to I want to get I want to get
[1:03:58] where I'm going Lord help me Jesus had
[1:04:00] all the fine qualities of God in him do
[1:04:01] you believe it can you say amen he had
[1:04:04] powers upon Powers but when he met Satan
[1:04:06] he never used his
[1:04:08] power listen to me he never used his
[1:04:10] power he give an example for the weakest
[1:04:13] of
[1:04:16] Christians the weakest I'm not going to
[1:04:18] ask you who the weakest is because on
[1:04:20] some days it might be
[1:04:22] me on some days it might be you on some
[1:04:26] days you just have a bad day but on that
[1:04:29] day Jesus gave you an example of how to
[1:04:32] overcome the
[1:04:33] devil when he met Satan he said it is
[1:04:37] written man shall not live by bread
[1:04:39] alone but by every word somebody say
[1:04:42] every word every word that proceeds out
[1:04:44] of the mouth of God the weakest
[1:04:46] Christian can take that stand and hold
[1:04:48] it he said sure God's in his word every
[1:04:51] time when he would meet the enemy he
[1:04:52] said it is written I believe he had
[1:04:54] power to do it yes sir he had power to
[1:04:56] defeat Satan he had power to just cast
[1:04:59] him down right there but he had
[1:05:01] authority to just speak the
[1:05:03] word he didn't have to use his own power
[1:05:06] because he knew you needed an example
[1:05:09] and you may not feel very powerful but
[1:05:11] you have the authority the same
[1:05:14] Authority that he
[1:05:17] had the weakest Christian can take that
[1:05:19] stand and hold it I claim that for
[1:05:21] myself on my weakest days I can take my
[1:05:24] stand just like Jesus did Satan may be
[1:05:26] tempting me Satan may be coming against
[1:05:28] me but I can stand there and say it is
[1:05:30] written I Heard a Voice I Heard a Voice
[1:05:34] I've read the word I know it's not just
[1:05:36] a theological understanding but what it
[1:05:38] is it came from the Throne of God into
[1:05:41] my heart and it ignited something on the
[1:05:43] inside of me that cannot be burned out
[1:05:46] it can't be taken away because I am part
[1:05:48] of him and he is well come on somebody
[1:05:51] it don't matter what the devil says he
[1:05:53] can't change my mind because my mind
[1:05:56] can't listen my mind ain't what got me
[1:05:57] here but something on the inside I can't
[1:06:00] help but be who I am you can't help us
[1:06:03] sit here in a message Church why because
[1:06:06] the devil might tell you well you can
[1:06:07] get you know you can have you can have a
[1:06:09] good service at the at the Pentecostal
[1:06:10] Church well you might have a good
[1:06:12] service but listen there's no hope for a
[1:06:14] Rapture because they're not under the
[1:06:16] end time
[1:06:17] light I'm not trying to hurt nobody's
[1:06:19] feelings here tonight is this okay but I
[1:06:21] want to tell you something you have
[1:06:22] something nobody else has got you have
[1:06:25] something something the world don't have
[1:06:26] you have something the best church out
[1:06:28] there in the denominations has no clue
[1:06:31] about this ain't just another
[1:06:33] Pentecostal move it's a word move and
[1:06:36] this revival cannot
[1:06:38] die there's a Revival of cycle and death
[1:06:41] cycle and death there's a church raised
[1:06:43] up and die but you know when this church
[1:06:45] was built it wasn't built on how good
[1:06:46] you feel it was built on the word of God
[1:06:49] and the word of God will go across this
[1:06:51] Pulpit every time there's a
[1:06:53] service well the church how appreciate
[1:06:56] having a pastor who don't want nothing
[1:06:57] up here but the word of
[1:06:59] God you ought to appreciate a man who
[1:07:02] says I don't want no Tommy rot in my
[1:07:03] Pulpit I want the word
[1:07:06] preached actually love the word of God
[1:07:09] it will cause a Revival in
[1:07:12] you see this is not an emotional Revival
[1:07:16] it it's not just a worked up feeling we
[1:07:18] don't I tell you what you're just as
[1:07:19] loud or maybe louder when the preacher
[1:07:21] preaching as you are when the singers
[1:07:23] are singing and I like to see that it's
[1:07:25] okay it's good to shout it's good to
[1:07:27] praise when the singer you need to we
[1:07:29] need to praise we need to get ready for
[1:07:31] battle but when the word's going forth
[1:07:33] when I can see people responding to that
[1:07:34] word it shows you've been you you've
[1:07:37] actually been in tune with the word of
[1:07:38] God you know when the word is being
[1:07:40] preached and it's moving upon your heart
[1:07:43] well come on somebody there's something
[1:07:45] on the inside of you that cannot be
[1:07:47] moved by the Fashions of the world
[1:07:50] there's something on the inside of you
[1:07:52] that cannot be burned out by just
[1:07:53] another Pentecostal move but this is a
[1:07:56] word Revival and you've been blessed to
[1:07:58] be a part of it I've been blessed to be
[1:08:01] a part of it this is this is that this
[1:08:05] is the restoration time this is the time
[1:08:07] of well I'm getting off my notes but can
[1:08:09] I go here this is the time where all
[1:08:12] things are to be
[1:08:13] fulfilled and if all things are to be
[1:08:16] fulfilled then there's got to be a
[1:08:19] bride and our Authority comes from the
[1:08:22] word this bride will not go listen
[1:08:25] brother had the vision and and one of
[1:08:26] them tried to get out of step and he
[1:08:28] cried get back in Step I want to say
[1:08:31] tonight stay in line with the word of
[1:08:32] God the devil's going to try to get you
[1:08:34] out of step and if you did happen to get
[1:08:37] out of Step that don't mean you're not
[1:08:38] bride but you you you would heed a
[1:08:41] prophet's warning and would get back in
[1:08:43] line when he screamed out you see it's
[1:08:46] like this if if you're in the Army and
[1:08:48] they tell you to March a certain way and
[1:08:50] you get out of line you may get yelled
[1:08:51] at you know you might get in trouble but
[1:08:53] that don't mean you're automatically
[1:08:54] just kicked out of of the army he's just
[1:08:56] trying to train you for when the enemy
[1:08:59] comes well I wish you'd hear me tonight
[1:09:01] he's training you for war he's training
[1:09:03] you for battle but here's the difference
[1:09:06] it's not just a worldly battle it's not
[1:09:08] just a worldly War he already knows the
[1:09:10] outcome he just wants some
[1:09:13] participants that are not going to just
[1:09:15] get thrown over here and toss this way
[1:09:18] and toss that way every wind of
[1:09:20] doctrine's going to come it's going to
[1:09:22] come against you every weapon's going to
[1:09:25] be formed but under the authority that
[1:09:28] has been given in this hour nothing can
[1:09:30] harm
[1:09:32] you nothing I'll prove it to you by a
[1:09:36] quote let me get on down here I got to
[1:09:38] skip some stuff brother Matt I'm gonna
[1:09:39] get myself in trouble brother talks
[1:09:41] about the the Centurion we read about at
[1:09:43] the beginning he said that Centurion
[1:09:45] knew that he was the son of God every
[1:09:47] sickness and every demon was under him
[1:09:48] and all he had to do is just speak the
[1:09:49] word not pray or or the Centurion knew
[1:09:51] that Jesus was all he had to do was just
[1:09:53] speak the word he didn't have to even
[1:09:54] come to his house he didn't have to show
[1:09:56] up in service aren't you glad he does
[1:09:59] because he's good but he doesn't have to
[1:10:02] we're not worthy of it brother brandom
[1:10:04] said and it would be done every demon
[1:10:07] would have to obey him he said you
[1:10:08] believe that tonight I can say Amen
[1:10:11] every demon will obey
[1:10:13] God it has to everything obeys God
[1:10:19] and this is what I like it'll obey you
[1:10:23] if you have faith amen
[1:10:25] Joshua stopped the son is that true
[1:10:28] somebody said all things are possible
[1:10:29] with God nothing's impossible but all
[1:10:31] things are possible to you also am
[1:10:35] nothing's impossible to them that
[1:10:36] believe all things are possible he
[1:10:38] brought it right down and made you if
[1:10:40] you just know who God was well I'm
[1:10:42] afraid that the church doesn't know
[1:10:44] their
[1:10:45] Authority if you knew your Authority
[1:10:49] then nothing is impossible to you well
[1:10:52] that ought to make somebody shout
[1:10:54] nothing's impossible well I prayed and I
[1:10:57] didn't get an answer nothing's
[1:10:58] impossible with you quit letting the
[1:11:00] devil tell you that God's not answering
[1:11:02] he is answering
[1:11:05] prayers he may not come when you want
[1:11:07] him but he's always on
[1:11:09] time you think God wouldn't answering
[1:11:12] wasn't answering the prayer of Abraham
[1:11:13] and Sarah all them years yes he was he
[1:11:15] knew exactly when it would come to pass
[1:11:17] he was just trying their faith and that
[1:11:19] trial of your faith is more precious
[1:11:21] than gold amen that's what the Bible
[1:11:23] teaches us it's more precious but we
[1:11:25] want everything right now you know we
[1:11:27] want everything at our fingertips and
[1:11:28] well hey that's okay that's human nature
[1:11:30] but don't let that human nature stop you
[1:11:32] from getting a blessing from God under
[1:11:35] the authority of the word it it it God
[1:11:38] does not God does not respond to our
[1:11:40] time God does not move in our time clock
[1:11:42] he doesn't he doesn't have a work day
[1:11:44] like we do because he he's he's always
[1:11:47] on the job and to him he knows the exact
[1:11:49] day when that body will be changed and
[1:11:53] he knows you have no reason to worry
[1:11:55] about it not a reason at all but yet our
[1:11:58] human our human worries get in the way
[1:12:02] our jobs get in the way our our own
[1:12:04] understanding sometimes well well
[1:12:06] brother brandom how does that make sense
[1:12:07] well I'll tell you what why don't we
[1:12:08] quit questioning a Vindicated
[1:12:11] prophet he was Vindicated not
[1:12:15] me well you can say am man or owe me but
[1:12:19] that's true anyhow because God saw fit
[1:12:22] to bring somebody to show you the light
[1:12:24] in this hour and show a bride how to
[1:12:28] walk with authority because if you're
[1:12:30] walking in the word nothing can stop
[1:12:34] you brother goes on like this he says I
[1:12:37] have no power to heal that's a prophet
[1:12:40] now I have no power to heal I have
[1:12:43] authority when I receive it from God to
[1:12:47] pronounce something that God has done
[1:12:49] and he actually references Samson here
[1:12:52] and he says as long as he could feel
[1:12:53] those locks hanging around his shoulders
[1:12:55] it was all right he said when I see him
[1:12:58] moving Among Us like this I know he's
[1:13:01] here don't
[1:13:02] you did you know that when you get in
[1:13:04] the presence of the Lord a lot of your
[1:13:06] worry just happens to fall away and when
[1:13:09] you get in the when you've had a bad
[1:13:10] winds day it's a good idea to go to
[1:13:13] church you should go anyway but if
[1:13:15] you've had a bad day you really need to
[1:13:16] go because you get in the presence of
[1:13:19] God and it just seems to lift you up a
[1:13:21] little higher than the things of the
[1:13:23] world on Sunday morning when the kids
[1:13:25] are screaming on the way to church and
[1:13:27] you're like Lord am I ever going to make
[1:13:28] it there with my with my mind am I going
[1:13:31] to go insane on the way to church I've
[1:13:32] got four kids I know all about it but
[1:13:34] listen to me listen God knows what you
[1:13:38] had need of before you got there and
[1:13:41] he's already got the service prepared to
[1:13:43] meet your
[1:13:44] need well the service met something no
[1:13:47] no he met every need or he's not God oh
[1:13:51] the service might have been for one no
[1:13:52] it was for everyone that was here amen
[1:13:57] you say it wasn't well don't question
[1:13:59] God did he bring you here did he show up
[1:14:02] then he wants you here for a purpose
[1:14:04] this is not just another gathering this
[1:14:06] is not just another get together but
[1:14:08] this is a god ordained time this is a
[1:14:11] season that God saw you sitting right
[1:14:13] where you're sitting God knew what you
[1:14:15] needed God knew what I needed God knew
[1:14:17] what the church needed and he put men in
[1:14:20] the church it ain't always the flashiest
[1:14:22] it ain't always the best it ain't always
[1:14:24] what you would pick but God chose the
[1:14:26] man Moses may not have been what what
[1:14:28] what man would choose but God chose
[1:14:32] Moses there's a lot of men that man
[1:14:35] would have chose brother brandom may not
[1:14:38] have been chosen by the modern clergy of
[1:14:40] his day because he couldn't hardly speak
[1:14:43] and he didn't have a good education but
[1:14:45] aren't you glad God chose somebody that
[1:14:47] we could understand aren't you glad that
[1:14:49] God chose somebody that wasn't so big
[1:14:52] and so great that that we that we never
[1:14:54] thought we could attain that Lev no no
[1:14:56] God brought God God used somebody just
[1:14:59] like you and I that could speak like us
[1:15:02] that could that could stumble just like
[1:15:04] we do brother Mark he wanted to use that
[1:15:07] because it's God in Simplicity revealing
[1:15:10] himself again just like he always did
[1:15:13] see if God would have used a a man of
[1:15:15] good clergy then he would have went
[1:15:16] against the program he've always had you
[1:15:19] realize he used Moses he used Elijah he
[1:15:21] used John the Baptist these were not men
[1:15:24] that come in well dressed in the
[1:15:25] synagogues no these were these were
[1:15:27] rugged men these were these were
[1:15:28] different kind of men these were not men
[1:15:30] that the world would choose but God has
[1:15:32] always chosen those things to confound
[1:15:35] the wise why because he works in ways
[1:15:38] you don't understand with your carnal
[1:15:40] mind he works in ways I don't understand
[1:15:42] with my carnal mind but what he does is
[1:15:45] always works out things for your good
[1:15:48] and for my good it doesn't matter what
[1:15:50] what bad is going on in your life well
[1:15:51] it does matter and we we worry about
[1:15:53] that as humans and we think well you
[1:15:55] know as a pastor brother Matt May sit
[1:15:57] back there and think well I know this
[1:15:58] one's going through that and this one's
[1:16:00] going through that I know my my brother
[1:16:01] does that he's sitting there like Lord I
[1:16:03] wish I could help this person but did
[1:16:05] you know that person and it's hard to
[1:16:07] tell them maybe you can't tell them but
[1:16:09] they're going through that for their own
[1:16:13] good I don't go here so I can get away
[1:16:15] with that I don't know what you're going
[1:16:17] through but it's for your good how can I
[1:16:20] say that because under the authority of
[1:16:21] the word I can say all things work
[1:16:24] together for the good good for the
[1:16:26] perfecting of your body listen we got to
[1:16:28] go through things on this Earth because
[1:16:30] we're trying to get somewhere don't be
[1:16:33] distracted by what's trying to hold you
[1:16:35] on this earth when there's a whole
[1:16:36] heavenlies to fly into there's promises
[1:16:42] everywhere but the devil wants to keep
[1:16:44] your focus here always looking down look
[1:16:46] up your Redemption draw
[1:16:49] nigh that's what I'm looking for that's
[1:16:51] where I'm going
[1:16:56] Samson just had to feel those locks do I
[1:16:59] still have the power of God with me he
[1:17:01] just had to go back and say yeah I still
[1:17:04] got the
[1:17:05] word I've still got it I may be chained
[1:17:08] between these pillars there may be
[1:17:10] thousands over here mocking me there may
[1:17:13] be thousands telling me you can't Pastor
[1:17:16] there may be thousands telling me that
[1:17:17] church will never never survive there
[1:17:20] may be thousands telling you brother
[1:17:21] Matt that you can never reach the loss
[1:17:23] there may be thousands telling you you
[1:17:25] can't overcome that sickness of cancer
[1:17:27] there may be thousands well come on now
[1:17:29] the devil's going to be telling you all
[1:17:30] kinds of Lies but all you got to do is
[1:17:33] feel that strength of the word come upon
[1:17:35] you and one time all you got to do is
[1:17:37] say Lord let these enemy be enemies be
[1:17:39] Avenged before my eyes let me tell you
[1:17:41] something did you know that Samson as
[1:17:44] one man could defeat defeat Mighty
[1:17:47] armies if God could use Samson in a
[1:17:50] backsliding condition all he had to do
[1:17:52] was say Lord are you still here do you
[1:17:55] remember me I'm in a bad place the Lord
[1:17:58] had already been there to work it out
[1:18:00] the strength had already started growing
[1:18:01] even before he recognized it there's
[1:18:04] more strength in you than you know
[1:18:06] that's
[1:18:07] right I'm a weak Christian no you're not
[1:18:10] that's the devil telling you I I'm
[1:18:12] nothing in the church that's the devil
[1:18:14] talking to you you have a position and
[1:18:16] if that position is sitting there saying
[1:18:18] Amen to the word of God stay faithful to
[1:18:20] that post stay in the house of God don't
[1:18:22] let the I'll tell you what the devil
[1:18:24] will never never make you go to
[1:18:27] church and if he does he's going to tell
[1:18:29] you to sit there and not
[1:18:31] participate so if you're here tonight
[1:18:34] you went against the devil just to be
[1:18:35] here yes sir and if you resisted the
[1:18:37] devil then guess what my Bible says he
[1:18:39] will flee far from you so is it a
[1:18:42] benefit just going to church yes sir
[1:18:45] because you've defeated the devil you've
[1:18:47] went against the devil just to be here
[1:18:51] tonight well that's just Bible let me
[1:18:53] tell you something that is the word
[1:18:55] Authority I'm talking about you can
[1:18:57] claim every scripture as
[1:19:00] yours by his stripes I am healed by his
[1:19:03] stripes I am healed by well you can say
[1:19:06] that about yourself by his stripes I
[1:19:08] have overcome
[1:19:10] depression by his stripes I have come O
[1:19:13] overcome
[1:19:14] anxiety you say what's my anxiety quit
[1:19:17] claiming that
[1:19:18] nonsense start overcoming it by his
[1:19:21] stripes I don't have to have
[1:19:22] anxiety because he died I don't have to
[1:19:25] live I don't have to live like the
[1:19:29] world you realize it's all him but he's
[1:19:32] living through
[1:19:34] you time is running but here we go can I
[1:19:37] go to the church AE book I told you I
[1:19:39] would brother BR said notice the harmony
[1:19:41] of the father and the son Jesus never
[1:19:43] did anything until it was first showed
[1:19:44] him by the father he references John
[1:19:46] 5:19 this harmony is now to exist
[1:19:49] between the groom and his bride
[1:19:54] you need to recognize who you are you
[1:19:57] are to have the same Harmony that Jesus
[1:20:00] had with the
[1:20:03] father I'm not I'm not saying that
[1:20:05] you're Jesus individually but you are a
[1:20:06] part of that body that's on earth now
[1:20:09] let me go a little farther here he shows
[1:20:12] her his Word of Life she receives it she
[1:20:16] never doubts it now I read that and can
[1:20:20] I tell you what happened I doubted it
[1:20:23] because my mind said how's that possible
[1:20:26] but something on the inside said a
[1:20:27] prophet said it I don't ever doubt the
[1:20:29] word you can call me a doubter if you
[1:20:31] want
[1:20:33] to I tell you what this body ain't going
[1:20:35] anyway it ain't saved anyway but but
[1:20:38] what's on the inside will never doubt
[1:20:41] this
[1:20:42] word I don't care how low in sin you've
[1:20:45] been there's a reason you're back
[1:20:47] because something on the inside never
[1:20:49] doubted that's a lot to swallow but
[1:20:51] there it is brother R said the word is
[1:20:53] in the bride as it was in Mary the bride
[1:20:57] has the mind of Christ for she knows
[1:21:00] what he wants done with the word she
[1:21:02] performs the command of the
[1:21:04] word in his name for she has thus sayith
[1:21:10] the
[1:21:11] Lord amen well I wish somebody think
[1:21:13] about that for a minute oh yeah you have
[1:21:16] thus sayith the Lord or you keep
[1:21:18] still but what is thus sayith the lord
[1:21:20] it's not just something you would speak
[1:21:22] say well this is going to happen I'm
[1:21:23] going to start speaking this and
[1:21:25] speaking Financial Peace and that's not
[1:21:27] thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the
[1:21:28] Lord is what God has already said if you
[1:21:31] read this Bible you can speak that as
[1:21:33] thus sayith the Lord because that is
[1:21:35] God's word and he's using your lips to
[1:21:37] speak
[1:21:38] it you have thus sayith the Lord a
[1:21:41] prophet would come with a Vindication he
[1:21:42] would come with an open book and if
[1:21:44] youve received the open book and the
[1:21:45] opening of the word in your day then you
[1:21:47] can have that same Authority because you
[1:21:49] can speak the word in its full potential
[1:21:52] because you know what the Bible says
[1:21:55] well I hope somebody knows what I'm
[1:21:56] talking about you know what the Bible
[1:21:58] says that denominational man or woman
[1:22:00] May read the same Bible you read and
[1:22:02] they can read it from Genesis to
[1:22:04] Revelation my grandpa was a man who I
[1:22:06] got his or my brother got his Bible when
[1:22:08] he passed away and and he's got that
[1:22:09] Bible and he's got it marked on every
[1:22:11] scripture that he read and some of them
[1:22:12] two or three times but the man never
[1:22:14] could see the message of the hour but
[1:22:15] can I tell you something it wasn't for
[1:22:17] him he was a westling he come up under
[1:22:19] that generation he was he could never
[1:22:21] see the light of this day but let me
[1:22:23] tell you something you have been
[1:22:25] privileged to see the message that
[1:22:27] you've seen and you found it to be a
[1:22:29] word
[1:22:30] message this is not outside the Bible
[1:22:33] this message came with the authority of
[1:22:35] the word in
[1:22:36] [Applause]
[1:22:37] it you really think God would stand
[1:22:39] there night after night and confirm a
[1:22:41] lie no sir he was standing there
[1:22:43] confirming the word to be true that was
[1:22:45] coming from his
[1:22:48] messenger and now we see brother B says
[1:22:50] at Thy word Lord I let down the net 1954
[1:22:52] he says we see in the Bible that Jesus
[1:22:54] Christ the son of God when he came to
[1:22:56] the Earth he came to rid sin and
[1:22:57] sickness and divorce it oh aren't you
[1:22:59] glad of that he's divorced your sin and
[1:23:01] sickness he put it
[1:23:03] away forever from his people put it away
[1:23:06] forever from his people and claim that
[1:23:08] he would return again and he will but in
[1:23:12] his absence yeah he gave his church the
[1:23:15] same Authority amen that he had amen
[1:23:19] thank you Lord I don't have much time
[1:23:20] left but I want to get to this right
[1:23:22] here when Jesus was standing at the
[1:23:24] grave of Lazarus he wept like a man is
[1:23:26] that
[1:23:27] right you're going to grieve over your
[1:23:29] loved ones if they would pass on before
[1:23:31] before the Rapture that's part of it you
[1:23:34] can't help it but there's something on
[1:23:37] the inside of you that knows that if
[1:23:39] that body lays down then there's already
[1:23:41] another one that's raised up we don't
[1:23:44] grieve as those that have no hope
[1:23:46] because we know what's waiting for us
[1:23:49] brother the Joe we have to have that
[1:23:51] hope that's what we hold on to when you
[1:23:54] lose a loved one you don't want to be
[1:23:55] just another person in the world say
[1:23:56] well I'll never see him again no we have
[1:23:58] a hope of a better
[1:24:02] tomorrow brother brand talks about this
[1:24:04] and I'm going to hurry through this so
[1:24:06] try to stay with me here for a minute he
[1:24:07] said Revelations 10:7 he talks about
[1:24:09] that the the messenger when he shall
[1:24:11] begin to sound the mysteries of God
[1:24:12] shall be finished as he ha declared to
[1:24:14] his servants the prophets there it is he
[1:24:16] is sending a Vindicated Prophet he's
[1:24:18] sending a prophet after almost 2,000
[1:24:20] years he's sending someone who is far
[1:24:22] from the organization can you say Amen
[1:24:24] aren't you glad of that but he said
[1:24:25] he'll have thus sayith the Lord and
[1:24:27] speak for God I'm skipping through this
[1:24:29] this is in the church age book and
[1:24:30] brother and leat see in church age he
[1:24:32] said and speak for God he will be God's
[1:24:34] mouthpiece a he as it is declared in
[1:24:37] Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the
[1:24:39] children back to the fathers not back to
[1:24:40] 1906 but all the way back to like it was
[1:24:43] at original Pentecost how many
[1:24:44] understand that to be true and he says
[1:24:46] and he will restore the truth as they
[1:24:48] had it just what Paul preached just what
[1:24:51] Paul this is not something new this is
[1:24:52] what Paul preached we are the original
[1:24:55] Apostolic
[1:24:57] Pentecostals a lot of people can put it
[1:24:59] on their Church times but we are them we
[1:25:01] are the real Apostolic Pentecostals we
[1:25:03] didn't just come up with a name we're
[1:25:05] living
[1:25:07] it we didn't we didn't go to 1906 and
[1:25:10] stop we're coming all the way into the
[1:25:12] astronaut age we're coming all the way
[1:25:14] into a translation age we are she that
[1:25:17] would go all the way in a
[1:25:19] Rapture brother BR said he'll he will
[1:25:21] bring back the elect of the last day and
[1:25:23] they will hear a vindication Prophet
[1:25:25] give the exact truth as it was with Paul
[1:25:27] he will restore the truth as they had it
[1:25:29] aren't you glad of it and and those
[1:25:31] elect with him in that day will be the
[1:25:33] ones who truly manifest the Lord and be
[1:25:37] his body and his
[1:25:41] voice it's a voice of authority and it's
[1:25:44] in
[1:25:45] you that might have been hard for you
[1:25:47] but listen you have you you are the body
[1:25:50] of Christ on the earth now can you say
[1:25:52] Amen to that brother B said you will be
[1:25:53] his body body and his
[1:25:56] voice we're going to get to something
[1:25:57] here in a second I hope you listen
[1:26:00] brother said you see it he said it in
[1:26:02] the Lutheran days the lutherans spoke
[1:26:05] for
[1:26:05] Luther in the Wesleyan days and I'm
[1:26:08] skipping some of this so go back and
[1:26:09] read it if you want to he said the Lu in
[1:26:11] the Wesleyan days the Wesleyan spoke for
[1:26:14] Wesley he said and then when the
[1:26:16] Methodist failed God raised up others
[1:26:18] and so has it gone on this is the part I
[1:26:20] want you to get because he's bringing it
[1:26:21] to our
[1:26:22] day he said there is again another
[1:26:25] people in the land
[1:26:27] amen I would I wish we could stay right
[1:26:30] there and preach on the land for a
[1:26:31] minute but we won't there's again
[1:26:33] another people in the land who under
[1:26:35] their messenger I've received the
[1:26:37] message how about you will be the final
[1:26:40] voice you all know this quote to the
[1:26:43] final
[1:26:44] age and he said the church is no longer
[1:26:46] the mouthpiece because God has turned on
[1:26:48] the church and and and and he said it is
[1:26:51] its own mouthpiece they're speaking
[1:26:52] their own words now they've left off the
[1:26:54] voice of God it's a strange thing to him
[1:26:58] but he said he said he said God is
[1:27:00] turning on her and he will confound her
[1:27:02] through the prophet and the bride for
[1:27:03] the voice of God will be in her when
[1:27:07] you're waiting on the voice of God to
[1:27:08] come from a man listen what what you're
[1:27:10] doing is you're saying God is not true
[1:27:12] because you have the voice of God in you
[1:27:15] where is the voice of God it's in you
[1:27:17] when you speak the word that is God
[1:27:21] speaking you say is that true yes that
[1:27:24] doesn't diminish a prophet's
[1:27:27] voice at all we only know who we are
[1:27:30] because of a prophet's
[1:27:32] voice so I'm not trying to take anything
[1:27:34] away from the message but somebody's got
[1:27:35] to live out the message it's not good
[1:27:38] enough to say well I hear I heard all
[1:27:39] the tapes but I can't live it no the
[1:27:41] bride can live
[1:27:43] it I know the world can't live it I'm
[1:27:45] not worried about them living it I know
[1:27:47] this world's going down I'm not
[1:27:49] discouraged by politics because it has
[1:27:52] no bearing on my Eternal my eternal home
[1:27:56] but what it does is it may discourage
[1:27:58] the world and it may discourage the make
[1:28:00] believer and the unbeliever well he's
[1:28:03] never coming back anyway it's just
[1:28:04] getting so bad if they could really see
[1:28:07] the word they know it's got to get this
[1:28:08] bad it's got to be in total chaos before
[1:28:12] the destruction be can come but the
[1:28:14] bride knows that she has Heard a Voice
[1:28:17] from heaven and that voice will catch
[1:28:19] her up out of here but it's not just the
[1:28:21] voice that's going to come back and
[1:28:22] catch her up the voice is is
[1:28:26] here you're speaking just like he
[1:28:30] spoke brother brandom could not say
[1:28:31] anything but what Paul spoke neither can
[1:28:36] we you say well I you know I'm outside
[1:28:38] the word well if you're outside the word
[1:28:39] you're outside of the authority of God
[1:28:41] you are no longer under the authority of
[1:28:43] God but as long as I'm under the
[1:28:46] authority that I have no fear because
[1:28:49] this message listen this message has
[1:28:52] come to change my body this message has
[1:28:54] came has come to give me hope that is so
[1:28:57] much greater than anything in any of the
[1:28:59] ages they did they didn't know the
[1:29:01] Mysteries they didn't understand who
[1:29:03] they were they they could see a little
[1:29:05] bit of light here and a little bit of
[1:29:07] light there but we're living in a dark
[1:29:08] time and the light has shown so bright
[1:29:10] in this age because we see the world in
[1:29:13] this darkness and we see the contrast of
[1:29:15] the Bride she's different than the world
[1:29:17] she lives different talks different what
[1:29:20] why because she's got a voice in her
[1:29:21] that's speak in life the world speaking
[1:29:24] gloom and doom but you're speaking life
[1:29:26] because God's speaking through
[1:29:28] [Applause]
[1:29:31] you let me get on down here brother Ram
[1:29:33] said they were waiting talk about the
[1:29:35] upper room they were waiting on
[1:29:36] something too he said they wasn't
[1:29:38] presuming right that they had anything
[1:29:40] they were waiting until the scripture
[1:29:41] was made manifest see they were under
[1:29:43] authority of the word of God they knew
[1:29:45] it was coming because the word said it
[1:29:48] would come stay with me just a little
[1:29:50] longer will you do it I'm not near an
[1:29:52] hour yet you're okay don't look at your
[1:29:54] watches yet we're good we're doing okay
[1:29:56] on time so far there's no clock back
[1:29:58] there I got one right here we're good
[1:30:00] brother Ram said like
[1:30:02] this he said after hearing that the
[1:30:04] blood of Jesus so thoroughly cleanses
[1:30:07] that there's no more nothing that that
[1:30:09] complete there's no more nothing that
[1:30:11] the complete word of God Rest within
[1:30:13] them I'm them are you part of them all
[1:30:16] right the complete word of God that the
[1:30:19] very command of their own voice is
[1:30:22] creative power amen
[1:30:25] I hope this is okay is this all
[1:30:27] right because in them is the Holy Ghost
[1:30:30] there's the key without the Holy Ghost
[1:30:33] you can't speak as the voice of God but
[1:30:36] if you have the Holy Ghost that's
[1:30:38] important young people you're not going
[1:30:40] to make it in on your dads or your moms
[1:30:43] or your grandparents you're not going to
[1:30:45] make it in on their experience you're
[1:30:46] not going to make it in on their
[1:30:47] salvation you're not going to make it in
[1:30:49] on their Holy Ghost you're not going to
[1:30:51] make it in because you felt good at
[1:30:52] Youth Camp but you're going to make it
[1:30:54] in because you have experienced a change
[1:30:57] in your body it is a birth that has to
[1:31:00] take place and yes it's a mess yes it's
[1:31:03] bad yes it it may you may have to get
[1:31:05] down at that altar maybe it doesn't
[1:31:06] happen the first time but don't stop
[1:31:08] trying to receive that Holy Ghost
[1:31:10] because God knows when you really mean
[1:31:12] business with him he's there willing and
[1:31:14] able to fill you with the Holy
[1:31:17] Ghost he knows you need it you can't
[1:31:20] make it without it and when you receive
[1:31:22] that you can speak words of life because
[1:31:25] then the the the the very life of God
[1:31:28] comes into the believer that's what a
[1:31:30] prophet teaches us we don't have to
[1:31:32] worry yes sir well I tell you what I
[1:31:34] wish I could say that again I feel like
[1:31:36] saying it again you don't have to worry
[1:31:38] you're worried about your kids you're
[1:31:39] worried about your church you're worried
[1:31:41] about your job you don't have to worry
[1:31:43] this is all temporary anyway I know that
[1:31:46] when I'm gone my kids are going with me
[1:31:48] I don't care what the devil tries to
[1:31:50] make them look
[1:31:51] like well the devil the devil's taking
[1:31:53] my kids out it don't matter keep that
[1:31:55] Faith over them keep that token over
[1:31:57] them they're coming
[1:32:01] back that's the faith you got to have
[1:32:03] and if the spirit of Christ is in you
[1:32:06] you may get discouraged at the grave of
[1:32:09] Lazarus when it looks like your best
[1:32:11] friend's
[1:32:13] died and you may not be able to call a
[1:32:15] man back that's been dead four days but
[1:32:18] see the difference is that body that he
[1:32:22] raised was just to show you that when
[1:32:25] you go down and your body is in
[1:32:27] corruption the very same Spirit that's
[1:32:30] in you will Quicken that body
[1:32:34] again a prophet don't have to come and
[1:32:37] raise me from the dead because the
[1:32:38] quickening power is already here the
[1:32:41] word is already here I've ate the book
[1:32:44] the word is in me and when that morning
[1:32:47] comes should I go by way of the Grave
[1:32:49] I'll be the first to get up why because
[1:32:52] on that great Resurrection morning
[1:32:53] morning that there's going to be
[1:32:55] something on the inside of the Bride I
[1:32:57] don't care how long they've been laying
[1:32:59] there there's going to be a voice of
[1:33:00] Resurrection that's going to raise them
[1:33:02] from the dead oh you can't keep a bride
[1:33:05] in the ground you can't keep us in the
[1:33:07] ground you well you can't keep us dead
[1:33:10] you can't keep us quiet because we know
[1:33:12] who we are I tell you what death can't
[1:33:15] defeat you death can't take you out well
[1:33:18] my grandparents went by I don't care
[1:33:20] what I don't care who died they ain't
[1:33:22] dead a Christian cannot
[1:33:25] die because this power is on the inside
[1:33:28] of you and this power cannot
[1:33:32] die I'm bringing it down but look look
[1:33:35] what Jesus says here Jesus said no man
[1:33:38] can come to me except my father has draw
[1:33:39] him and all that my father hath given me
[1:33:42] they will
[1:33:43] come they will that's right we don't
[1:33:46] have to worry about them they will my
[1:33:49] sheep my doves they hear my voice a
[1:33:51] stranger they will not follow and what
[1:33:53] is the voice of God is the word of
[1:33:55] God so when your pastor is standing
[1:33:58] behind this pulpit and reading and
[1:34:01] preaching under the anointing the word
[1:34:03] of God that is the voice of God to
[1:34:07] you oh that's hard just why that's what
[1:34:10] a prophet said what is the voice of God
[1:34:13] the word of God so if I'm reading this
[1:34:15] Bible that is the voice of God to you if
[1:34:19] I'm reading the quotes of the message of
[1:34:20] the hour that is the voice of God to you
[1:34:23] if God would come down here tonight and
[1:34:25] say that you're healed you are that is
[1:34:28] the voice of God to you that's not
[1:34:30] something I said he already said it and
[1:34:33] I'm just here to say what he said I'm
[1:34:35] not just a parent but it's been Quicken
[1:34:37] to me I know it's right I know it's real
[1:34:40] I know the word of God is right and
[1:34:42] there's nothing in this nothing in this
[1:34:44] world can stop me from receiving the
[1:34:46] prize at the end of the
[1:34:49] race sir here's a distraction there's a
[1:34:52] distraction here's something over here
[1:34:54] oh here's some there's going to be drama
[1:34:55] come up around you oh it's going to try
[1:34:57] to stop you but the bride of Christ will
[1:34:59] run with
[1:35:01] patience they won't stop why because
[1:35:03] they have authority to overlook that
[1:35:05] distraction and Overlook that
[1:35:07] distraction and Overlook that trouble
[1:35:09] why yes it's a trouble yes you may have
[1:35:12] something in your road that looks like a
[1:35:13] roadblock but you've been given the key
[1:35:16] to possess the Rapture by the authority
[1:35:19] of the voice of God in
[1:35:22] you you recognize who you are and all
[1:35:24] devils in hell can't stop you you
[1:35:27] recognize who you are and it's time for
[1:35:29] body change you recognize who you are I
[1:35:32] tell you what we don't need to know who
[1:35:33] anybody else is know who you are well
[1:35:36] it's brother Joel this or his brother no
[1:35:38] you don't worry about me worry about who
[1:35:40] you are I don't have to worry about
[1:35:41] brother Matt or brother Mark listen
[1:35:43] these are men of God I can say that but
[1:35:44] listen you know what I can fail
[1:35:48] you men can fail you and often times
[1:35:51] will
[1:35:54] yeah but but listen the word that he's
[1:35:56] speaking won't
[1:35:59] fail if he's speaking the word of God
[1:36:01] and you know the voice of God why
[1:36:03] because you've I believe brother Andrew
[1:36:05] said this and I don't mean to quote him
[1:36:07] but you familiarized yourself with the
[1:36:08] word of God so you know when the word of
[1:36:10] God's being preached that's why we we
[1:36:12] ain't trying to take tapes out of your
[1:36:14] home you need to be hearing the tapes we
[1:36:16] ain't trying to take the Bibles out of
[1:36:17] your homes you need to be reading the
[1:36:18] Bibles you need to do it now more than
[1:36:21] ever it's your food it's your daily
[1:36:23] bread it's what you need it's everything
[1:36:25] to you but when you come to the house of
[1:36:27] God don't come with a critical spirit
[1:36:30] that says well I I don't know that
[1:36:31] really brother Brandon meant it that way
[1:36:33] if I read a quote to you out of the
[1:36:34] message I tell you what I may not
[1:36:36] understand it either but if he said it
[1:36:38] I'm going to stake my soul on
[1:36:41] it because I believe the word of God and
[1:36:44] I don't have time to pick and choose
[1:36:46] what I what I want to believe I just
[1:36:48] want to believe what he said and well
[1:36:50] God help me if if that if that's wrong
[1:36:52] God forgive me for a Vindicated Prophet
[1:36:55] if that's wrong to believe the Bible God
[1:36:57] forgive me for believing a Vindicated
[1:36:58] word in our hour but I say God will back
[1:37:01] us up at the day God will back us up at
[1:37:04] that day when you stand there and
[1:37:05] there's been many go before you and I'll
[1:37:07] tell you what there's been many went on
[1:37:09] a different ages and they were longing
[1:37:11] to be in the age you're in because you
[1:37:13] have you will never taste death you will
[1:37:16] see I tell you what you'll see your
[1:37:17] loved ones coming in what a supernatural
[1:37:19] time that is coming for the bride and I
[1:37:22] believe we're entering in there right
[1:37:23] now we don't have to give up hope on our
[1:37:25] loved ones I don't care how far gone
[1:37:28] they look I don't care how bad they look
[1:37:30] I say hold on to the faith that God has
[1:37:32] given you speak the word over your
[1:37:34] children speak the word over your
[1:37:36] sickness speak the word because in you
[1:37:39] is the potential to speak the voice of
[1:37:41] God because you can speak and Devils
[1:37:44] will
[1:37:46] tremble because it's not you speaking
[1:37:49] it's not you speaking it's the voice of
[1:37:51] God if if it was just your voice voice
[1:37:53] the devil wouldn't be scared a bit I can
[1:37:56] I can say boo devil but if that's just
[1:37:57] me but he knows there's something on the
[1:37:59] inside of me that means it he knows that
[1:38:02] I'm not going to take a backseat to what
[1:38:05] the devil
[1:38:06] has I tell you what some of you some Of
[1:38:09] You' been out in the world some of you
[1:38:11] know how bad it can get some of you know
[1:38:13] how far in sin you can get because
[1:38:16] you've let down your guard and you just
[1:38:17] drift and you drift and you drift that's
[1:38:20] right and then when you come back you
[1:38:22] get on fire the Lord and then after a
[1:38:25] while the devil says well wasn't you
[1:38:27] know you it wasn't really that bad out
[1:38:29] there it wasn't really that miserable
[1:38:30] out there he wants to get you right back
[1:38:33] in that miserable pit you were already
[1:38:35] in but did you know what that's the time
[1:38:38] to kick that devil in the teeth that's
[1:38:41] the time to get in church and say you
[1:38:42] know what I'm going to shout a little
[1:38:44] extra just so the devil knows whose side
[1:38:46] I'm
[1:38:49] on I feel cold I feel like the spirit
[1:38:52] has Departed getting church and I tell
[1:38:55] you what devil you may have me held back
[1:38:58] from receiving my full potential in this
[1:39:00] service but I'm going to praise God
[1:39:02] anyway it's not what I deserve but he
[1:39:05] deserves the glory he deserves the honor
[1:39:08] he deserves my praise I I tell you what
[1:39:11] I don't have to feel like praising him
[1:39:13] to praise him because he gave me
[1:39:15] authority to speak over my life over my
[1:39:20] family can I have five minutes
[1:39:25] brother random says this and it's in a
[1:39:26] prayer but I'll just read it to you he
[1:39:29] talks about Moses he said he said oh God
[1:39:31] how I could think when the church was on
[1:39:34] the move when Moses got a little scared
[1:39:35] down there at the Red Sea he be to cry
[1:39:36] to the Lord and the Lord said why are
[1:39:39] you crying to me what are you crying to
[1:39:41] me for speak and go
[1:39:44] forward why cry why worry speak because
[1:39:49] you have the words in your mouth that's
[1:39:51] right you ate the book you have the
[1:39:54] words of eternal life coming out of your
[1:39:57] mouth oh you don't I tell you what we
[1:39:59] just got to know who we are church we
[1:40:01] just got to know that we're not in this
[1:40:03] alone that when we speak we're speaking
[1:40:05] like the Oracles of God we we are
[1:40:06] speaking as God why listen because we
[1:40:09] are the body we don't make up I don't
[1:40:11] make up the entire body but if you get
[1:40:13] rid of me then the body's missing a
[1:40:15] piece I may be the most insignificant
[1:40:17] piece of the body but I'm still part of
[1:40:20] the body and I'm GNA claim that until
[1:40:22] the day I die
[1:40:24] I'm going to claim that until the body
[1:40:25] change why because I'm not going to take
[1:40:27] what the devil tells me you ain't you
[1:40:29] know you're not you don't deserve to be
[1:40:30] up there I know I'm I know I'm not
[1:40:32] worthy but I know who is worthy and his
[1:40:36] blood has covered
[1:40:40] me brother said Lord God today I come in
[1:40:42] the name of the Lord Jesus I come
[1:40:44] yielding this sword of Faith claiming
[1:40:46] the Oneness of God and man by the Holy
[1:40:50] Ghost that's my point I want to get to
[1:40:52] you tonight he's claiming
[1:40:55] you he's claiming you to to be one with
[1:40:58] God through the baptism of the Holy
[1:41:00] Ghost if you don't have it then you're
[1:41:03] never going to be one with God tonight's
[1:41:05] your night if you need it tonight's your
[1:41:08] night you don't have to wait till the
[1:41:10] next Revival oh come on
[1:41:12] church when your pastor standing here
[1:41:14] that's just as good a time to receive
[1:41:15] the Holy Ghost as the meeting you have
[1:41:17] at the end of the year I tell you what
[1:41:19] he has just as much authority to speak
[1:41:21] over you as any man that he would call
[1:41:22] into in this
[1:41:24] Pulpit I know that I listen I'm not
[1:41:26] bragging on us I'm not bragging on us
[1:41:28] for speaking I'm bragging on him because
[1:41:30] it's his voice speaking through a body
[1:41:34] I'm not saying that I am God but I have
[1:41:38] the attributes in me of God I know I
[1:41:41] have the flesh too if you're looking at
[1:41:42] this you're looking at the wrong thing
[1:41:44] if you're looking at this you're looking
[1:41:45] at failures and mistakes you're looking
[1:41:47] at someone who who could fail you
[1:41:49] tomorrow but on the inside of me is the
[1:41:52] Holy Ghost that is going to hold me
[1:41:55] because I've been sealed I've been
[1:41:57] sealed to the day of my Redemption

[2:03:58] Jesus Christ isn't it a powerful thing
[2:04:01] let me tell you I I appreciate what that
[2:04:03] brother said that the devil the devil
[2:04:05] tries to put things on us but you
[2:04:07] realize that there ain't no Authority in
[2:04:09] the world that didn't come from God the
[2:04:12] Bible said all authority come from God
[2:04:14] that means any Authority that the devil
[2:04:16] thinks he has it came from God first and
[2:04:19] he gave you the authority over all
[2:04:20] things a't that wonderful how many say
[2:04:23] praise the Lord tonight man I know
[2:04:26] appreciate our brother coming and
[2:04:28] pouring his heart out to the
[2:04:30] Lord I know God spoke to many hearts
[2:04:35] tonight I know you y'all think it's
[2:04:38] funny when pastors say this but many
[2:04:40] conversations that I've had that brother
[2:04:43] repeated things that you talk to people
[2:04:45] about and I know he made a statement
[2:04:47] don't let the devil use that he made a
[2:04:49] statement where he said I told you I was
[2:04:50] going to read something the church CH
[2:04:52] book don't take that and think he was
[2:04:53] telling me about his message or I was
[2:04:54] talking to him I never talk one word to
[2:04:56] him we were sitting in the back and I
[2:04:58] said something about our church and how
[2:04:59] that we love the church age book where
[2:05:01] we you know the church when we first
[2:05:02] started we went through the church age
[2:05:04] book A lot it was a lot of teaching he
[2:05:05] said well I have a quote in the church
[2:05:07] age book tonight I'm glad to know
[2:05:08] somebody's okay to read it that's why he
[2:05:10] said that so he didn't sit back there
[2:05:11] and tell me that and I certainly didn't
[2:05:13] sit back here and talk to him but the
[2:05:15] Lord spoke to our hearts tonight he used
[2:05:17] our brother a surrendered vessel as an
[2:05:19] authority of the word of God over our
[2:05:21] Liv Liv to tell you keep pressing the
[2:05:23] battle God's got it all in
[2:05:26] control God put us in our place he gave
[2:05:28] every one of us our position and some
[2:05:30] seemed great and some seem lesser how
[2:05:33] many remember me preaching that the
[2:05:34] other day but he made the he made more
[2:05:36] valuable the ones that seem less
[2:05:38] desirable gave them more value that's
[2:05:41] what God says to us tonight isn't it
[2:05:43] wonderful we all have a place in the the
[2:05:45] word of God it's sure good to have
[2:05:47] sister Lillian back been sick I'm glad
[2:05:50] to see her feeling better
