[54:55] uh from from down there is even coming
[54:57] up for our meeting uh in uh next week so
[55:00] just continue to be praying for that
[55:02] look forward to it so we want to invite
[55:04] you to Galatians the 4th chapter and
[55:06] we're going to read out of the fourth
[55:08] verse and we'll read down to the seventh
[55:10] verse the Bible says but when the
[55:11] fullness of the time was come God sent
[55:13] forth his son made of a woman made under
[55:16] the law to redeem them that were under
[55:18] the law that we might receive the
[55:20] adoption of sons and because you are
[55:23] Sons God has sent forth the spirit of
[55:26] the son in our hearts crying Abba Father
[55:31] wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but
[55:33] a son and if you're a son then you're an
[55:36] heir of God through Christ amen would us
[55:39] ask the Lord to add his Blessing how
[55:40] many say Amen to that if you're a son
[55:42] that you are an heir of God through
[55:44] Christ and this morning I want to speak
[55:45] on Kingdom children we've been speaking
[55:48] on this series on a kingdom series and
[55:50] uh but I I want to take this scripture
[55:52] here in Galatians 4 uh in the adoption
[55:55] series how many listen to that adoption
[55:57] series uh lately and um well well God
[56:00] bless you so maybe with something we
[56:02] ought to get get a hold of it especially
[56:04] in what we've been speaking on in this
[56:06] uh Kingdom uh series over the past few
[56:09] weeks but it may have been a while but I
[56:10] know SE how many's heard it at some
[56:12] point okay that's more like it several
[56:14] has heard it but in the adoption series
[56:16] but BR would take this scripture in
[56:17] Galatians 4 and tie it to Romans the 8th
[56:19] chapter and say where the earnest that
[56:22] says where the earnest expectation of
[56:23] the creature waiteth for the
[56:25] manifestation of the sons of God he said
[56:27] I want to point this point this out that
[56:29] God is trying to place his church in a
[56:31] position he's trying uh to manifest
[56:33] himself and getting one that he can work
[56:35] through like this so he can say that my
[56:38] spirit flows freely through him there
[56:40] there is somebody that I can work
[56:41] through that's what God is trying to do
[56:43] he's trying to get a people in a
[56:45] position that he can work through them
[56:46] so he'll get one over in one place and
[56:49] one over in another and maybe uh one
[56:51] over in another place and and God is is
[56:53] literally taking the Sons and Daughters
[56:55] of God and placing them in a position
[56:57] that he can flow through them God do you
[56:59] realize that God God wants to use you
[57:01] somebody say that God wants to use me
[57:03] amen he he wants to use you and so he
[57:05] has to get them in a place and but said
[57:07] so here's what's happening it's adoption
[57:09] placing and manifesting this is the
[57:11] three things that is going on in the
[57:13] church it's adoption and then God
[57:15] placing and then manifesting the life of
[57:17] Jesus Christ now I know uh many of you
[57:19] since it's been a while since we've
[57:20] heard the adoption series but uh but but
[57:22] on uh adoption uh it's it's what it's
[57:25] it's
[57:26] it's what the way the prophet explains
[57:29] it is a way that in the old days when a
[57:31] son would be raised up by his father and
[57:33] the son was set under a tutor and for so
[57:35] long of his life as a young man he would
[57:37] be trained by a tutor the ways of the
[57:39] father and so even though he was a son
[57:41] all along and although he he he was he
[57:43] was born of his father and all of those
[57:46] things but there would come a time in
[57:47] his life that he would actually have the
[57:50] will of the father it would be so taught
[57:52] into him that that the will of the
[57:54] father would be a part of him and he
[57:55] would come in the father would put his
[57:57] stamp of approval on him and then he
[57:58] could go and he could he could take the
[58:00] checkbook he could take Daddy's
[58:01] checkbook I don't know how many of y'all
[58:02] would give your kid a checkbook but but
[58:04] but there Comes A Time in his life that
[58:06] you could he could take Daddy's
[58:07] checkbook and he' go to town and he
[58:09] wouldn't write hot checks and squander
[58:11] and buy all the every all the toys in
[58:13] the toy aisle and Walmart he'd be he
[58:15] would do what the father would do with
[58:17] it so he explains of how that when we
[58:19] come to this stage of adoption is
[58:20] whenever the power of God actually comes
[58:23] to the church because it's something
[58:25] that God can trust you with with it's
[58:26] not something that you would abuse you
[58:28] realize that God isn't going to give you
[58:30] some uh uh some power that you could go
[58:32] go abuse you know people you know
[58:34] driving down the road we would abuse it
[58:35] if you had the power to speak people out
[58:37] of existence every Monday morning you'd
[58:39] speak somebody out of existence you
[58:41] driving down the road and they pull out
[58:42] in front of you and and and red Buick be
[58:44] gone I mean it would any grandma that
[58:46] ever drove y'all don't laugh it's the
[58:48] truth but but but God he gives you power
[58:51] knowing that you would use it correctly
[58:53] and so here here we're coming to this
[58:55] age of adop and this is what God is
[58:57] doing you realize that adoption is what
[58:59] God is relying on in order for the
[59:01] church to manifest Christ in know see we
[59:03] have to come to this place in order for
[59:05] God to use us and the Bible tells us the
[59:07] channel that God would use to bring the
[59:10] church to this place of spiritual
[59:11] adoption and now I'm going to make this
[59:13] statement but I believe that God's word
[59:15] was meant to live how many believe that
[59:16] say amen I believe his word was meant to
[59:19] live you say well how can it live John
[59:21] said in the beginning was the word and
[59:23] the Word was with God and the Word was
[59:25] God and then the the word was made flesh
[59:27] and dwelt Among Us I always thought that
[59:28] was a powerful scripture because he said
[59:31] the word became flesh you know I thought
[59:33] how can a word have flesh how can a word
[59:36] have legs how can a word have feet how
[59:38] can a word have hands how can how can a
[59:41] word live the Bible said the word became
[59:43] flesh in other words the word became
[59:45] alive the word could breathe it could
[59:47] talk it could feel it had compassion it
[59:49] it had emotions it could weep and you
[59:51] say well how could the word come alive
[59:53] well it can only come alive One Way Paul
[59:56] preaches it he said the letter kth but
[59:58] the spirit gives life you say well I've
[1:00:00] got the word I've got the Bible I know
[1:00:02] the whole world that we got the same
[1:00:04] Bible so our church is good enough we
[1:00:06] preach out the same Bible we've got the
[1:00:07] same word we can quote it just like
[1:00:09] everybody else but do you realize that
[1:00:12] just having the word is not enough it
[1:00:14] wouldn't matter of fact I can prove it
[1:00:16] to you cu the past 2,000 years the
[1:00:18] church world has had the same Bible the
[1:00:21] same letters from the same Apostles the
[1:00:23] same word and the only thing it done is
[1:00:25] created denominations and caused
[1:00:27] division between people caused families
[1:00:29] to separate it it it broke things apart
[1:00:31] it didn't bring Unity it didn't bring
[1:00:33] people together the same Bible same
[1:00:35] scriptures all the things they had but
[1:00:37] all it did was build walls it builds
[1:00:39] barriers it separates Fellowship because
[1:00:42] that's what the word would do by itself
[1:00:44] because no one could interpret it they
[1:00:46] don't understand it and one sees it one
[1:00:48] way and one sees it another so so it
[1:00:50] causes separation and it causes Division
[1:00:53] and it comes down and then the power of
[1:00:55] God's Not in it and though so then
[1:00:57] people would say well they'll deny the
[1:00:58] power of it because they don't see God
[1:01:00] working anymore out of his word but you
[1:01:02] realize it was used for all these things
[1:01:04] and it's been used for wrong I'm going
[1:01:05] to tell you this this morning before I
[1:01:07] even get started the word of God has
[1:01:09] been used wrongly by many men it's been
[1:01:11] used wrong it's been used to control
[1:01:13] people it's been used to bind people
[1:01:15] it's been used uh to to to to cause
[1:01:17] people to uh to come under subjection to
[1:01:20] you it's been called uh used to rule
[1:01:22] over people it's been used for fame it's
[1:01:24] been used to to build great Kingdom
[1:01:26] but but but in all of the things that
[1:01:28] it's been used for still yet it had no
[1:01:30] life in it at all but then that same
[1:01:32] word brother Wesley when it was anointed
[1:01:35] by the spirit of God it become a great
[1:01:37] power here's what brother BR said he
[1:01:39] said Christ never sent me to build an
[1:01:41] organization he said he sent me to build
[1:01:43] individuals to the stature of Jesus
[1:01:46] Christ that they might be the PowerHouse
[1:01:49] and the dwelling place of the spirit of
[1:01:51] God by his word so by the word of God
[1:01:54] the spirit would dwell in you and you
[1:01:57] would become a Powerhouse I don't know
[1:01:58] about you but I I I see some powerhouses
[1:02:01] here this morning that's what God
[1:02:03] intends for you he don't intend for us
[1:02:04] just to be some Christians that that
[1:02:06] come in the church and just sit through
[1:02:08] some services and just get by from one
[1:02:10] week to another he said but it's in my
[1:02:12] intention to bring the spirit of God
[1:02:15] upon the word of God that's in the
[1:02:17] hearts of the Believers and cause them
[1:02:19] to be a spiritual Powerhouse in the age
[1:02:21] that we're living in I want to know how
[1:02:22] many sitting here this morning is there
[1:02:24] a Powerhouse here this morning morning
[1:02:26] is there I I know you may not feel like
[1:02:28] it but just speak it by faith this
[1:02:29] morning and say brother Matt I'm a
[1:02:31] spiritual Powerhouse let me tell you
[1:02:32] what a Powerhouse is a Powerhouse is a
[1:02:35] person of great energy strength and
[1:02:37] power so you know what he done when he
[1:02:39] brought his word the spirit of God it
[1:02:41] anointed the word it made you strong and
[1:02:43] energetic it made you a powerful
[1:02:45] believer that's what we see this morning
[1:02:47] brother Mark there's some spiritual
[1:02:49] powerhouses I know some of them don't
[1:02:50] know what they are but I know that's
[1:02:51] what I am this morning he made me a
[1:02:53] spiritual Powerhouse he took me from
[1:02:55] serving the devil and he caused me to
[1:02:57] serve God he took me from serving the
[1:02:59] world oh you put that same person in a
[1:03:01] barroom they'll shout and dance and do
[1:03:03] all kinds of goofy stuff but you put
[1:03:05] them in the house of God and they sit
[1:03:06] there why they hadn't been made a
[1:03:08] Powerhouse yet but I thank God there's
[1:03:10] somebody that the spirit of God has
[1:03:12] gotten a hold of and it ain't when they
[1:03:13] got a microphone it's all the time it
[1:03:16] made a spiritual Powerhouse out of them
[1:03:18] and they they're energetic and and
[1:03:20] strong and they're a powerful believer
[1:03:22] he gave us a power let me tell you
[1:03:23] something about this power that God has
[1:03:25] has given the church this morning it
[1:03:27] ain't like the powers of the world the
[1:03:29] power that God give you is a Perpetual
[1:03:32] power now I know you know if you if you
[1:03:33] study in the world you'll find this this
[1:03:35] is something that don't exist this is
[1:03:37] what all the science Elon Musk he love
[1:03:39] to to to to get a hold of something like
[1:03:41] this but it's impossible to do because
[1:03:43] in in order according to the laws of
[1:03:45] physics everything has to have an energy
[1:03:47] in order to cause it to have power so a
[1:03:50] Perpetual power it would be something
[1:03:52] that would that that would have power
[1:03:54] that didn't need an outside source to
[1:03:56] cause it to be able to produce power it
[1:03:58] don't need any outside energy so in
[1:04:00] other words it works infinitely without
[1:04:03] any external energy so that means if you
[1:04:05] would take a let's say you took a you
[1:04:07] know the little ball and you and you and
[1:04:09] you spun it around it tapped the other
[1:04:10] ball and it spun around and tapped it
[1:04:12] and it spun around and tapped it and it
[1:04:14] went on forever and ever see that would
[1:04:16] be a Perpetual power you see because
[1:04:18] there wasn't no outside energy but it
[1:04:20] will never do that because of the laws
[1:04:21] of physics and the law of gravity and
[1:04:24] all and the laws of friction and all the
[1:04:25] laws that come in in play eventually
[1:04:28] it's going to run out unless you would
[1:04:30] come in with an external power and you
[1:04:32] would cause it to go again see so
[1:04:34] Perpetual power is something that the
[1:04:36] world has never been able to do science
[1:04:38] has never been able to do it but when it
[1:04:40] comes to the believer God done that in
[1:04:43] you now is't there something that there
[1:04:45] something that is impossible in the
[1:04:47] world Brother David but God done it in
[1:04:49] the heart of every believer you say well
[1:04:51] how how in the world do we have a
[1:04:52] Perpetual power let me tell you how God
[1:04:54] did it first off he spoke a word and the
[1:04:56] Bible says faith comes by what by
[1:04:58] hearing of the word of God and then
[1:05:01] faith is what brings power to your life
[1:05:04] and you know what happens whenever power
[1:05:05] comes to your life you speak the word of
[1:05:08] God and then it's made manifest isn't it
[1:05:10] something now you you see what happens
[1:05:11] and because you speak it Faith by faith
[1:05:14] uh when you hear it it brings faith and
[1:05:17] Faith brings power and it causes you to
[1:05:19] speak it and when you speak it you hear
[1:05:21] it and it brings faith and Faith brings
[1:05:23] power and it causes you to speak it and
[1:05:25] you hear it it brings faith and Faith
[1:05:27] brings power and power causes you to
[1:05:29] speak it and there ain't nothing on the
[1:05:31] outside that has to come in to to to
[1:05:34] work you up there ain't nobody has to
[1:05:35] get a microphone and get you worked up
[1:05:38] this morning because there's something
[1:05:39] on the inside of you that is always
[1:05:41] working and it hears and it speaks and
[1:05:43] it and it has faith and it brings power
[1:05:46] and it's constantly why because it's a
[1:05:48] Perpetual power that's on the inside of
[1:05:50] every believer but said this is what we
[1:05:52] are he said everything that you have
[1:05:54] need of in this earth journey is in you
[1:05:57] when you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:59] Ghost all the healing you ever need it's
[1:06:01] already in you glory to God all the
[1:06:03] rejoicing you ever need it's already in
[1:06:06] you all the power you ever need
[1:06:08] everything that you have need of is in
[1:06:10] you when Christ is in you it's a
[1:06:13] Perpetual power brother Jared everything
[1:06:15] you have need of is in you when Christ
[1:06:17] is in you see that's what he gives us a
[1:06:19] power source and brother Wesley this
[1:06:21] power source is an eternal source that
[1:06:23] never gets old it's a it's a perfect
[1:06:25] Source it if you add to it it it don't
[1:06:28] work if you take away from it it don't
[1:06:30] work the way God gave it to us it's
[1:06:31] perfect the way God made it it's a
[1:06:33] perfect power source that's what this
[1:06:35] message was given for it was given to
[1:06:37] take a church that had lost its power
[1:06:39] and to bring it back into the power of
[1:06:41] God you see where we are in this age you
[1:06:44] realize that that this is what God was
[1:06:45] wanting to do is to bring the church
[1:06:48] back to the Bible days to bring the
[1:06:50] power of God back to the church again
[1:06:52] see the church had lost its power can I
[1:06:54] say that you know why it got formal it
[1:06:57] got cold it lost its power it LO it lost
[1:07:00] the spirit of God and then here God
[1:07:02] would come in this last stage he said
[1:07:03] but I won't leave it that way I'm not
[1:07:05] going to leave it lukewarm I'm not going
[1:07:07] to leave it powerless but God come in
[1:07:09] the last day in order to restore the
[1:07:12] church back to its former glory or back
[1:07:14] to its former power back to the upper
[1:07:17] room back to the pillar of fire back to
[1:07:19] a move of God again you say well how and
[1:07:22] not by hyping it up and not by ping it
[1:07:24] up but by the spirit spirit of God that
[1:07:26] give life to the word of God and brings
[1:07:28] power back to the church this is what
[1:07:31] God wanted to see power restored back to
[1:07:34] the church again now watch Jesus when he
[1:07:37] was entering into this capernium one day
[1:07:40] the Bible says the Centurion you
[1:07:42] remember the story The Centurion comes
[1:07:43] to him and he says my servant is at home
[1:07:46] sick and he's tormented and Jesus said
[1:07:48] unto him I will come and heal him but
[1:07:50] the Centurion answered and he said Lord
[1:07:52] I'm not worthy that thou should come
[1:07:54] under my roof
[1:07:56] but speak the word only and my servant
[1:07:57] shall be healed for I'm a man under
[1:08:00] Authority I have soldiers that work
[1:08:02] under me when I tell one to come he
[1:08:03] comes if I tell one to go he goes I
[1:08:06] understand a position of authority and
[1:08:08] notice what Jesus's response was he said
[1:08:11] I say unto you I have not found so great
[1:08:14] faith not in all of Israel right but I
[1:08:17] say unto you that many shall come from
[1:08:19] the East and West and shall sit down
[1:08:20] with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the
[1:08:23] Kingdom of Heaven but the children of
[1:08:24] the Kingdom shall be cast out in the
[1:08:26] outer Darkness where there shall be
[1:08:28] weeping and nashing of teeth now notice
[1:08:30] this term that he uses the children of
[1:08:32] the Kingdom now notice when Jesus is
[1:08:34] speaking this watch what he's referring
[1:08:36] to see we use this term children of God
[1:08:38] or child of God how many how many
[1:08:40] believes they a child of God we use this
[1:08:42] term children of God or children of the
[1:08:44] Kingdom or a child of the Kingdom But
[1:08:46] realize there's many definitions or
[1:08:48] theological definitions of what a child
[1:08:49] of God is one place would say that well
[1:08:51] we're all children of God since we're
[1:08:53] created in God's image and another place
[1:08:55] would say well that we're that any
[1:08:58] living believer is a Son of God because
[1:09:00] you're a Believer and you're alive
[1:09:01] therefore you're a Son of God but notice
[1:09:03] what the Bible says in John 1 he said he
[1:09:05] was in the world and the world was made
[1:09:07] by him but the world knew him not he
[1:09:10] came unto his own and his own received
[1:09:12] him not but as many as received him
[1:09:15] notice it wasn't just believing but it
[1:09:17] was receiving said any as many as
[1:09:19] received him to them gave he power to
[1:09:22] become the sons of God even to them that
[1:09:25] believe on his name see so they they
[1:09:28] believed him they received him and they
[1:09:30] were given power to become a Son of God
[1:09:32] you notice that believing it gave them a
[1:09:34] power to become a son but it didn't make
[1:09:36] them Sons he said he just gave them
[1:09:38] power to be it takes a power in order to
[1:09:41] find your position it takes a power to
[1:09:43] get in your place he said it give you a
[1:09:44] power to become the sons of God but then
[1:09:46] the next verse John finishes he said
[1:09:48] which were born not of blood nor of the
[1:09:51] will of Flesh nor of the will of man but
[1:09:53] we were born of God
[1:09:56] see so in other words in order to be a
[1:09:58] Son of God it takes a birth how you know
[1:10:00] you think about it how how are you what
[1:10:02] you are how are you a Morse Carter he
[1:10:05] was born a Morse he can't help it who
[1:10:07] his daddy is that's who he was born to
[1:10:09] he's a Morse so he can't change it
[1:10:10] neither can you and shakina was she was
[1:10:13] born of Reynolds wesy you was born of
[1:10:15] hams Travis you was born a kisser
[1:10:17] because of your birth it made you what
[1:10:19] you are so see so that's the way it is
[1:10:21] brother said that's the way to become a
[1:10:23] child of God just like you became a a
[1:10:25] child of your father because you was
[1:10:27] born of your father it made you a child
[1:10:28] of your father well that's the way it
[1:10:30] that's what it takes to be a child of
[1:10:32] God it takes being born by the spirit of
[1:10:34] God into the Church of the Living God so
[1:10:37] you want to be a part of God's church
[1:10:38] and be a child of God it takes being
[1:10:40] born by the spirit of God so you notice
[1:10:42] when Jesus uses this term Children of
[1:10:44] the Kingdom he's actually referring to
[1:10:46] the Natural lineage of Abraham or Israel
[1:10:49] now I I don't believe that Jesus used
[1:10:50] Idle Words I don't I I don't believe
[1:10:52] that that I believe that he fulfilled
[1:10:54] scripture how many believe that I
[1:10:55] believe that whatever he said was a
[1:10:57] fulfillment of what took place in the
[1:10:59] Old Testament every prophecy that
[1:11:00] pertaineth to him he fulfilled it every
[1:11:03] everything that was concerning him he
[1:11:05] fulfilled it he knew what he was saying
[1:11:06] he knew the law and the prophets he
[1:11:08] certainly knew he he no doubt he could
[1:11:10] quote Malachi he remember whenever the
[1:11:12] Bible said he knew it remember when they
[1:11:13] came to him and they said shouldn't
[1:11:15] Elijah first come he said well certainly
[1:11:17] he shall first come and he has come and
[1:11:19] he will come see he knew what Malachi
[1:11:21] had prophesied he knew he knew that he
[1:11:23] would come so I'm going to say if he
[1:11:24] knew Malachi 3 then he knew Malachi 1
[1:11:27] see cuz there was no ones twos and
[1:11:29] threes and fours back then it was just a
[1:11:30] letter from a prophet and so if he knew
[1:11:33] the prophet Malachi then Jesus certainly
[1:11:35] knew that God had spoken through Malachi
[1:11:37] when he said who is there among you that
[1:11:40] would shut the doors for nothing neither
[1:11:42] do you Kindle a fire for nothing in
[1:11:44] other words is there not a priest among
[1:11:46] you that would go and make a sacrifice
[1:11:48] earnestly is there somebody that would
[1:11:50] make a sacrifice that that that would
[1:11:52] have an Earnest sacrifice or a sincere
[1:11:54] sacrifice said that you don't just do it
[1:11:56] for no reason or just because it's a law
[1:11:59] is there is there not one among you this
[1:12:00] is what God is crying out this is
[1:12:02] hundreds of years before Jesus ever
[1:12:04] walked upon the Earth Malachi's
[1:12:06] prophesying of the condition of Israel
[1:12:08] saying is there not a priest among you
[1:12:10] that would make a sacrifice that is a
[1:12:12] worthy sacrifice is there not a priest
[1:12:14] among you that would make a sacrifice
[1:12:16] for a reason is there not somebody among
[1:12:18] you that would come to the house of God
[1:12:20] on purpose is there not somebody among
[1:12:21] you that would come here and worship God
[1:12:24] that would have a reason is there
[1:12:25] Earnest sacrifice that is still is still
[1:12:28] there is there not just one he was
[1:12:29] calling for one priest that would make
[1:12:32] an Earnest sacrifice before God he saw
[1:12:34] the condition of a Nation the coldness
[1:12:36] that had crept in he said is there one
[1:12:38] that would make an Earnest sacrifice
[1:12:40] listen what God said he said for I have
[1:12:42] no pleasure in you says the Lord of
[1:12:44] hosts neither will I accept an offering
[1:12:47] at your hand because it was an Earnest I
[1:12:50] won't even accept the offering that you
[1:12:51] make so all these years Brother David
[1:12:54] they went out and they made offer and it
[1:12:55] wasn't even accepted by God out of the
[1:12:57] mouth of his own Prophet saying I won't
[1:12:59] accept it it's not an Earnest sacrifice
[1:13:01] I'm not going to accept it you can go
[1:13:02] through the motion if you want to but
[1:13:04] I'm not going to accept it because it
[1:13:06] wasn't an Earnest sacrifice but listen
[1:13:07] what God said it wasn't going to be the
[1:13:09] end it wasn't that God was just going to
[1:13:11] go give up and give up on people he said
[1:13:13] but for from the rising of the sun even
[1:13:16] to the going down of the same my name
[1:13:19] shall be great among the Gentiles and
[1:13:21] every place incense shall be offered
[1:13:23] unto my name in every place incense
[1:13:27] shall be offered unto my name in every
[1:13:30] nation in every place in the world my
[1:13:32] name would be great isn't that a
[1:13:34] wonderful thought it would be a pure
[1:13:35] offering he said every place incense
[1:13:38] would be burned it' be a pure offering
[1:13:39] unto me for my name shall be great
[1:13:42] amongst the Heathen sayeth the Lord my
[1:13:44] that's something Malachi was prophesying
[1:13:46] that God that the the very God that was
[1:13:48] only known by the Jews the one that
[1:13:50] wasn't worshiped by the heathens he
[1:13:51] wasn't worshiped by the Gentiles he
[1:13:53] wasn't worshiped by the people of the
[1:13:55] world but Malachi prophesied that that
[1:13:57] very same God that one day that there
[1:14:00] would be a gentile people out of every
[1:14:02] nation and his name would be great among
[1:14:05] them I don't know about you but I think
[1:14:07] we're a fulfillment of that this morning
[1:14:09] that that that we're a nation and in
[1:14:11] this nation there's a gentile people and
[1:14:13] I don't know about you but his name is
[1:14:15] great in my mouth I say in this nation
[1:14:17] let his name be great in all the nations
[1:14:20] of the world his name has become great
[1:14:22] when they would turning down but his
[1:14:24] name was great say why because there was
[1:14:26] a people that God would call it was
[1:14:28] prophesied that it would come to him you
[1:14:29] think about what Israel was waiting on
[1:14:31] they thought he would come in great
[1:14:33] power of judgment and because he would
[1:14:35] come this is how they took this
[1:14:36] scripture brother Jared God G or this
[1:14:39] this Messiah this Christ would come in
[1:14:41] this great power of judgment and because
[1:14:43] he would bring such a great judgment
[1:14:45] upon the world that that he would lift
[1:14:47] Israel he would destroy all their
[1:14:49] enemies and because this great king of
[1:14:51] judgment would come the nations would
[1:14:52] fear him and he would be a great name
[1:14:55] among their Nation this is what they
[1:14:57] were looking for this great judge but
[1:14:58] you realize that that's not what made
[1:15:00] his name great it wasn't the coming of a
[1:15:03] judge that made his name great it was
[1:15:05] the coming of a savior that made it
[1:15:07] exact opposite of what they were looking
[1:15:08] for the coming of a judge that would
[1:15:11] caus them to have reverence toward him
[1:15:12] but that ain't what it took it was the
[1:15:14] coming of a savior that caused this day
[1:15:16] do you realize the day that we're living
[1:15:17] in that there's Believers in every
[1:15:19] nation in this world it don't matter
[1:15:21] what nation you go to there's a gentile
[1:15:23] people that the name of Jesus Christ is
[1:15:25] great in their mouth it's a fulfillment
[1:15:27] of Malachi 1 brother Mark and I'm glad
[1:15:30] to be able to say I'm a part of it it
[1:15:32] wasn't the coming of a judge that made
[1:15:33] me serve him it ain't the coming of a
[1:15:35] judge that made him great before my eyes
[1:15:37] but it was the coming of a savior that
[1:15:40] came down and picked us up out of a my
[1:15:42] clay and said I won't leave you in that
[1:15:44] place I don't come to tread you down but
[1:15:46] I come to lift you up and because he
[1:15:48] lifted us it made his name
[1:15:51] great becoming of a savior made great
[1:15:54] his name the coming of a savior it gave
[1:15:56] hope to those that were hopeless the
[1:15:58] coming of a savior it saved those that
[1:16:01] were lost the coming of a savior it's
[1:16:03] what it's what brought healing to the
[1:16:04] sick the hope to the weary and it's what
[1:16:07] brought power back to the church the
[1:16:09] coming of a savior and the Bible said
[1:16:11] and unto you that fear my name shall the
[1:16:14] son of righteousness arise with healing
[1:16:15] in his wings and you shall go forth and
[1:16:18] grow up as calves in the stall and shall
[1:16:20] tread down the wicked it would brought
[1:16:22] power back to the church listen what
[1:16:25] what Paul's message was he said see this
[1:16:27] Blessing of Abraham it would come on the
[1:16:30] Gentiles through Jesus Christ this is
[1:16:32] where Paul would take these scriptures
[1:16:33] of Malachi and the life of Jesus and he
[1:16:36] would he would apply it into the
[1:16:37] doctrine of the church today said The
[1:16:39] Blessing of Abraham might come on the
[1:16:40] Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we
[1:16:42] might receive the promise of the spirit
[1:16:44] this was Abraham's promise that we might
[1:16:47] receive the promise of the spirit
[1:16:48] through faith now to Abraham and his
[1:16:50] seed were the promises made but notice
[1:16:53] Paul points this out that God God never
[1:16:55] said to Abraham into to thy seeds plural
[1:16:58] he said but to thy seed singular he said
[1:17:00] so what he was speaking of his seed
[1:17:03] which was Christ he say so his seed
[1:17:05] would be able to inherit the promise so
[1:17:08] all of those that are in Christ or all
[1:17:09] those that Christ is in see that's where
[1:17:11] the promise would be inherited he said
[1:17:13] so I say this and then Paul proves this
[1:17:16] scripture he proves to us he said see
[1:17:18] how could the Covenant that God made
[1:17:19] with Abraham before he said before the
[1:17:22] law the law came 4 30 years after the
[1:17:26] Covenant was confirmed to Abraham say
[1:17:28] see so remember when God went up on the
[1:17:30] mountain with Abraham and he took and he
[1:17:31] made the sacrifice remember God came
[1:17:33] down and he divided it and he made a
[1:17:35] covenant remember he put him in a sleeve
[1:17:36] and he confirmed the Covenant that he
[1:17:38] made from him that his seed would
[1:17:39] receive the promise of God say see so
[1:17:41] This Promise came to him it was
[1:17:43] confirmed to him but at that time there
[1:17:45] was no law 430 years later because of
[1:17:49] the transgressions of people then God
[1:17:51] brought the law into the church he said
[1:17:53] see now he said how how can this law
[1:17:55] that came 430 years later disano the
[1:17:59] promise that God had already made 430
[1:18:01] years before see so God confirmed it
[1:18:03] when there was no law God God confirmed
[1:18:06] it when that law didn't exist he said so
[1:18:08] it couldn't all La it could how could it
[1:18:09] make it a none effect he said see how in
[1:18:11] other words how could the law come and
[1:18:14] take the Covenant away and cause the
[1:18:16] Covenant to come by something else he
[1:18:17] said see so by so the inheritance if it
[1:18:20] be of the law then it's no more of the
[1:18:23] promise right and God gave it to Abraham
[1:18:26] by a promise I don't know about y'all
[1:18:28] but I think that's good he said see so
[1:18:30] if the inheritance be of the law it
[1:18:32] couldn't be of both you can't get it
[1:18:34] from one way and then get it from
[1:18:35] another so if it be of the law then it
[1:18:37] couldn't be by promise and if it's by
[1:18:38] promise then it couldn't be by the law
[1:18:41] he said see God gave it to Abraham by
[1:18:43] promise he said then why do we serve the
[1:18:45] law it was added because of
[1:18:47] transgressions until the seed would come
[1:18:49] to whom the promise was made isn't that
[1:18:51] a powerful scripture it was added until
[1:18:53] that seed which was Christ would come to
[1:18:56] whom the promise was made so here we are
[1:18:59] this seed of God it would come that that
[1:19:01] law was there until that seed would come
[1:19:03] until Christ be born in you and then no
[1:19:05] longer are we living by a law it's not a
[1:19:07] a book of rules it's not under a tutor
[1:19:10] but it's the spirit or the life of Jesus
[1:19:12] Christ that's living in you that that
[1:19:14] allows you to be able to walk and serve
[1:19:16] God and do the things of God and the
[1:19:17] will of God so we don't have to serve
[1:19:19] him by law I serve him because of the
[1:19:21] seed that is on the inside of me so see
[1:19:24] it's the life of of Christ said see so
[1:19:26] the law it's not against the promises of
[1:19:28] God he said if there had been a law
[1:19:30] given which could have given life then
[1:19:31] righteousness would have been by the law
[1:19:33] but the scripture concluded all that
[1:19:36] were under sin that the Promise by faith
[1:19:38] of Jesus Christ might be given to them
[1:19:41] that believe so see so before Faith came
[1:19:44] we were kept under the law you see your
[1:19:45] tutor before Faith came we were kept
[1:19:48] under the law we were we were closed
[1:19:50] from Faith which would afterwards be
[1:19:52] revealed wherefore the law was our
[1:19:54] school Master to bring us unto Christ
[1:19:56] that we might be justified by faith but
[1:19:59] after faith has come we are no longer
[1:20:02] under the school Master for you are the
[1:20:04] children of God by faith in Jesus Christ
[1:20:08] isn't that good When Faith came it made
[1:20:11] you a child of God by our faith in
[1:20:13] Christ it ain't by our law it ain't by
[1:20:15] our lineage it ain't by our natural
[1:20:17] birth you realize this is what Jesus was
[1:20:18] telling this Centurion he said I have
[1:20:21] not found so great a faith in all of
[1:20:23] Israel here he walked among his people
[1:20:26] all this time but I never seen this kind
[1:20:28] of Faith he was waiting on this
[1:20:30] scripture to come to fulfillment that
[1:20:32] prophecy of Malachi to come to
[1:20:34] fulfillment he said see it be I have not
[1:20:36] found so great a faith in all of Israel
[1:20:38] and because of his faith the Bible says
[1:20:40] his servant was healed that selfs hour
[1:20:42] nobody laid hands on him he didn't go
[1:20:44] down there to where he was he said but
[1:20:45] you're because of your faith he realized
[1:20:47] that the power of the spoken word had
[1:20:49] power to raise him up and he was raised
[1:20:51] up that self same hour Jesus said I say
[1:20:53] unto you many shall come to the East and
[1:20:55] the West notice what he's telling them
[1:20:56] many shall come from the East and the
[1:20:57] West to use this this Centurion this
[1:21:00] Gentile as an example he said and they
[1:21:02] will sit down with Abraham and Isaac and
[1:21:04] Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven in other
[1:21:06] words around the nations of the world
[1:21:08] many shall come they'll become come from
[1:21:10] Sudan there'll be some from the United
[1:21:12] States there'll be some from Canada
[1:21:14] there'll be some from from Colombia
[1:21:16] there'll be some from Guyana there'll be
[1:21:18] some from India from all the nations of
[1:21:19] the world from the East and the west and
[1:21:22] they'll come and sit down with Abraham
[1:21:23] and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of
[1:21:25] Heaven but the children of the Kingdom
[1:21:27] those that were born of this Kingdom
[1:21:29] they'll be cast into outer Darkness see
[1:21:31] what Jesus shows us if you're born of
[1:21:33] the if you're just a children of the
[1:21:34] natural Kingdom then you have no hope
[1:21:37] but if you're a children of the Heavenly
[1:21:39] Kingdom then you can receive the promise
[1:21:40] of God but Abraham said see here's what
[1:21:42] a child of God is a child of God is the
[1:21:45] Seed of Abraham how many believes that
[1:21:47] somebody say that with me a child of God
[1:21:50] is the Seed of Abraham you know what
[1:21:52] that means if you're a Seed of Abraham
[1:21:54] you'll have the the characteristics of
[1:21:55] your father and then you know what
[1:21:57] Abraham done he walked and he called
[1:21:59] things that were not as they were he
[1:22:01] walked and he said they said well there
[1:22:02] ain't nothing there Abraham said there
[1:22:04] is something there there's a city and it
[1:22:06] wasn't made by man it was made by God it
[1:22:08] would call things when you have a
[1:22:09] sickness in your body but because of
[1:22:11] that Seed of Abraham that is in you you
[1:22:13] can look at the symptom and say I'm not
[1:22:15] going to believe the symptom I'm going
[1:22:16] to do like Abraham does and I'm going to
[1:22:18] call it I'm going to call me well I'm
[1:22:19] going to call it healing I'm going to
[1:22:21] call the Lost saved I'm going to call
[1:22:23] those that are bound I'm going to call
[1:22:24] them free because there's something in
[1:22:26] me that cus things that aren't as though
[1:22:28] they were it's the Seed of
[1:22:30] Abraham and if you the child of God is
[1:22:33] the Seed of Abraham says so we walk by
[1:22:35] faith we don't walk by sight we don't
[1:22:37] walk by symptoms we walk by faith isn't
[1:22:39] it something friends just you you can
[1:22:41] just feel this coming in this building
[1:22:42] right now that when you see a faith of
[1:22:45] people begin to build up and real and
[1:22:47] realize what God is doing with them it
[1:22:48] it it builds our faith and all a sudden
[1:22:50] you can look at things and look at
[1:22:51] situations and things that seem hopeless
[1:22:54] and the very thing that used to seem
[1:22:56] hopeless that would never happen the the
[1:22:58] people you know you got loved ones that
[1:22:59] are lost and you want to see them serve
[1:23:01] God and it seems like a hopeless case
[1:23:03] but when faith comes into the building
[1:23:04] all of a sudden that thing that was
[1:23:06] hopeless don't seem so hopeless anymore
[1:23:08] because it's God he's building there's a
[1:23:10] power in you he's waiting on you to take
[1:23:12] it and find your position and to release
[1:23:14] that power upon this world and speak the
[1:23:16] the very word of God by the power of the
[1:23:18] spirit and allow it to go to word then
[1:23:20] God can look back at you and say there's
[1:23:22] one I can work through there's one I can
[1:23:24] speak through there there's one I can
[1:23:26] use you see God ain't going to come and
[1:23:28] speak with an audible voice and call a
[1:23:30] person out of sin and call a person out
[1:23:32] of darkness and set them on a church pew
[1:23:34] but what God's waiting on is you and I
[1:23:36] to be able to speak and say in the name
[1:23:38] of Jesus Christ I'm going you're going
[1:23:40] to be delivered of that in the name of
[1:23:41] Jesus you'll be healed of that in the
[1:23:43] name of Jesus you're going to give your
[1:23:45] heart to God and you're going to serve
[1:23:46] him all the days of your life I claim
[1:23:48] you in the name of Jesus Christ he's
[1:23:50] waiting on a son or a daughter of God to
[1:23:53] come into their position and take the
[1:23:54] very word of God by the spirit of God
[1:23:57] and claim the things that God has
[1:23:59] desired in his own heart he's waiting on
[1:24:01] you to manifest him to see Abra we're
[1:24:05] Abraham's seed we call things as no as
[1:24:08] though they were not as though they were
[1:24:09] this is what God says so we just keep
[1:24:11] moving on in a sign of adversity we move
[1:24:14] on in a sign of circumstance we just
[1:24:15] keep moving on because we're Abra we're
[1:24:17] Abraham's seed but notice not only does
[1:24:20] God show us what a real child of God is
[1:24:23] brother Wesley you're a real child of
[1:24:25] the Kingdom but he gives us an
[1:24:26] identifier to know that we are that
[1:24:28] isn't that good God gives you a checkup
[1:24:31] so I know that I've I know I've met that
[1:24:33] place how many wants to hear some of
[1:24:34] them I know I know I've made it to that
[1:24:36] place here here's what the Bible says
[1:24:38] the Bible says he chastens those he's
[1:24:39] love he loves he said see if you cannot
[1:24:42] stand chastisement of God the scripture
[1:24:44] are lining you up say I don't want to
[1:24:46] hear that stuff I don't want to be
[1:24:47] corrected I don't want to be corrected
[1:24:48] by the scripture if you can't stand to
[1:24:50] hear it he said it's a sure evidence
[1:24:52] that you are not a child of God
[1:24:55] if you can't stand correction you can't
[1:24:57] stand chastisement you can't take the
[1:24:59] word of God corrected you it's a sure
[1:25:00] evidence that you are not a child of God
[1:25:04] because a real child of God would be
[1:25:06] hungering and thirsting after the word
[1:25:08] of God a real child of God even whenever
[1:25:11] it hurts they say come on preacher just
[1:25:13] pour it on it's the truth when the word
[1:25:14] of God's going forth just come on May I
[1:25:17] know I shouldn't be that I know I
[1:25:18] shouldn't be in this condition I know I
[1:25:20] know I shouldn't be in this shape a real
[1:25:21] child of God they just say Bring It On
[1:25:23] just keep saying why because they're
[1:25:25] hungering and thirsting you say why are
[1:25:27] they hungering and thirsting because
[1:25:28] they're they're a child of God you
[1:25:30] realize as a child of God you have a
[1:25:32] body on this Earth I may as well preach
[1:25:34] it but you have a body on this Earth and
[1:25:36] then you have a body that's representing
[1:25:37] you in glory and so this heavenly body
[1:25:40] is pulling this Earthly body into
[1:25:41] subjection it's calling you and it's
[1:25:43] pulling you into this life to be able to
[1:25:46] serve God and to be able to be a
[1:25:47] Christian and be a believer it's pulling
[1:25:49] you to become that and the world is
[1:25:51] pulling you down this old flesh is
[1:25:53] pulling you down and to be able to serve
[1:25:55] the devil and be able to serve the world
[1:25:57] and all the things that the world has
[1:25:59] but then this other body it's pulling
[1:26:00] you up so what it what let me ask you
[1:26:02] this this morning what is this fleshly
[1:26:04] body representing is it representing the
[1:26:06] world or is it representing that body in
[1:26:08] heaven let me tell you it may be a
[1:26:10] struggle but I thank God there's
[1:26:12] something that is pulling us it may it
[1:26:14] may be a trial but there's something
[1:26:15] that is drawing you how how come every
[1:26:17] time you come in the house of God he
[1:26:19] pulls on you and he pulls at your heart
[1:26:22] he's trying to draw you into this place
[1:26:24] into this heavenly body that God has
[1:26:26] created you say see he's made you you're
[1:26:28] hungering and thirsting after that
[1:26:30] because that body is drawing you said
[1:26:32] what are you what what what are we using
[1:26:34] this body for see that's the body we
[1:26:35] should be so what are we using this one
[1:26:37] for are we using it to serve the devil
[1:26:39] hello somebody are we using it to
[1:26:41] glorify the devil or are you going to
[1:26:43] use it to glorify God this body is the
[1:26:45] one that everybody sees are you using it
[1:26:47] to testify of Jesus Christ are you using
[1:26:49] it to testify The Works of the devil
[1:26:51] what are you using this body for
[1:26:54] see this is the body this terrestial
[1:26:57] body the one that we see see what are
[1:26:59] you using it for is it looking towards
[1:27:02] heaven is there something up there that
[1:27:04] is drawing you is it trying to to mimic
[1:27:07] that is it trying to grow into that you
[1:27:10] say well brother Matt I I know I'm going
[1:27:12] to get myself in trouble but I'm a
[1:27:14] pastor I got a pastor you say well I was
[1:27:17] baptized so that you know I did
[1:27:19] everything I was supposed to do I was
[1:27:20] baptized in the water and boy I got it
[1:27:23] right but remember said you can be
[1:27:25] baptized in the water and deny the word
[1:27:27] and you're an illegitimate because your
[1:27:29] birth wasn't
[1:27:30] correct say see so a real baptism would
[1:27:33] cause you to receive the word of God it
[1:27:36] cause you to say amen amen means so be
[1:27:38] it a real baptism it causes you to
[1:27:41] receive the word of God it don't it
[1:27:42] don't reject it it don't push it out it
[1:27:44] you know even Oh Glory it it don't push
[1:27:47] it out it has a desire to hear God's
[1:27:49] word it has a desire to be right it has
[1:27:51] a desire to be corrected it has a it has
[1:27:54] the desire to walk in line with the word
[1:27:56] of God why because it's trying to get
[1:27:58] back to that body that one that was
[1:28:01] bypassed it's trying to get to that it's
[1:28:03] trying to manifest that life you realize
[1:28:05] you may grow up in the wrong influence
[1:28:07] and grow up with you know the friends
[1:28:09] and stuff in school and they they do all
[1:28:11] kinds of things but all of a sudden God
[1:28:13] calls you and whenever he calls you but
[1:28:15] J he calls you out of this world because
[1:28:17] he wants you to be something else there
[1:28:18] there's something isn't it something
[1:28:19] that God before the foundation of the
[1:28:21] world he made you and he created you and
[1:28:23] he had you in his mind they may go down
[1:28:25] whatever path they're going to go down
[1:28:26] but you don't have to go down that path
[1:28:28] because God has made you something
[1:28:30] different and he's calling you drawing
[1:28:32] you back to that body said see so we
[1:28:35] claim if you claim to believe him and
[1:28:36] den and deny his word it's an
[1:28:38] illegitimate son he said but my actions
[1:28:40] and the Vindication of God's word in my
[1:28:42] life shows whether I'm a Child of God or
[1:28:44] not my
[1:28:46] actions think about it I know people
[1:28:49] don't like to hear this because they
[1:28:50] like Grace and it don't matter what you
[1:28:51] do you're you're a Son of God but my
[1:28:54] actions and the Vindication of God's
[1:28:56] word in my life you know what that means
[1:28:58] that God's word has changed me it's been
[1:29:01] Vindicated it's changed me it's I I know
[1:29:03] it to be the truth I I accept it to be
[1:29:05] the truth that's what determines whether
[1:29:08] I'm a Child of God or not let me tell
[1:29:10] you what children of God do God's
[1:29:12] children they obey the father that's
[1:29:14] what a good that's what a good child
[1:29:16] does if not whether you're not Wesley's
[1:29:18] child if you're Wesley's child you obey
[1:29:20] the father I know some children don't
[1:29:22] obey the father but wesle children they
[1:29:24] obey the father but our children they
[1:29:27] should obey their father in a household
[1:29:30] the family comes under subjection to the
[1:29:32] Father the father he's the head of the
[1:29:34] household and so because they're subject
[1:29:36] to the father says see we live if you're
[1:29:38] living in this natural house it's the
[1:29:40] natural father and the and the and the
[1:29:42] father's rules they're the rules and
[1:29:43] whatever the father says that's what it
[1:29:45] says I mean it don't matter how many
[1:29:46] times you say why or why can't me and
[1:29:48] you know I don't know I don't know how
[1:29:50] y'all Oh Glory I don't know how y'all's
[1:29:51] kids are but stomping and throwing fits
[1:29:53] and my my kids it never got them
[1:29:54] anything it never it got it got them
[1:29:56] something all right but it sure wasn't
[1:29:57] it sure wasn't a sucker you know that's
[1:29:59] what people today they want to quet
[1:30:01] their kids down they'll put a sucker in
[1:30:02] their mouth so they'll be quiet and
[1:30:04] they're stomping around I watched a kid
[1:30:05] the other day in the store and he told
[1:30:07] his mom I mean he told his mom I I w't
[1:30:10] even repeat it but but anyway she did it
[1:30:12] he he put her right in her place and he
[1:30:13] was about 5 years old and she he put her
[1:30:15] right in her place and she gave him his
[1:30:16] cell phone he went and sat down in the
[1:30:18] corner and watched whatever he wanted to
[1:30:19] watch until she got done shopping I
[1:30:20] thought man I'll tell you what have you
[1:30:22] that kid ain't mine glory to
[1:30:26] God but they obey the father praise the
[1:30:29] Lord and they should be obedient to the
[1:30:31] father he said see so that's the way it
[1:30:32] is in a natural house but how about in
[1:30:34] the house of God you see in the house of
[1:30:37] God we live by the word of God the Bible
[1:30:39] says every word that proceedeth out of
[1:30:41] the mouth of God and any other word we
[1:30:43] wouldn't even we wouldn't accept it we'
[1:30:45] call it a fraud we want because it's
[1:30:47] only God's word say see so the family of
[1:30:49] God obeys the order of the father of the
[1:30:51] family and you know what the Bible said
[1:30:52] he was he said he was the father he was
[1:30:54] the governor the king the Emanuel the
[1:30:57] first and the last the Prince of Peace
[1:30:58] the Mighty God the Everlasting father
[1:31:01] and every one of his children obey every
[1:31:03] word to the order because they're a part
[1:31:06] of him we obey we're obedient because
[1:31:10] we're Children of the father see but
[1:31:12] also being a CH a child of God it comes
[1:31:15] with privileges see to be a to be a
[1:31:17] child of God we get to Feast at the
[1:31:19] father's
[1:31:20] table ain't that good when you have need
[1:31:22] of something you got a father that owns
[1:31:24] a cattle on a thousand hills he can
[1:31:25] always meet your needs isn't it
[1:31:27] something I don't know about y'all but
[1:31:29] it something about having a rich daddy
[1:31:31] Glory I'm going tell you it's it's a
[1:31:32] good feeling to know that he can take
[1:31:34] care of you and brother Mark it don't
[1:31:36] matter when you get in trouble he's got
[1:31:37] he's got he's got the fix for it you can
[1:31:39] you can get yourself in the middle of a
[1:31:40] mess he knows every lawyer he knows
[1:31:43] every doctor he knows every judge he
[1:31:45] knows every jury member he's got control
[1:31:47] over every bit of it the Bible said he's
[1:31:49] the one that puts in power over all the
[1:31:51] kingdoms of this world that's my
[1:31:53] heavenly father father and because he's
[1:31:55] my father it comes with
[1:31:58] privileges he's a just God brother heart
[1:32:01] but he he's a God that it's a merciful
[1:32:03] god but the wesy preach singing about
[1:32:05] him he's a god of Mercy you remember you
[1:32:08] remember how the the story about the
[1:32:10] little girl that went in she got her a
[1:32:11] speeding ticket reckless driving and
[1:32:14] then she came up there and she says well
[1:32:15] you got to go to court and you know they
[1:32:17] she may have even had to spend the night
[1:32:18] in jail she's out there just driving
[1:32:20] crazy so she comes up there and they
[1:32:22] said well um to come to the courtroom
[1:32:24] and loger brings her in she goes and lo
[1:32:26] and behold the judge was her own daddy
[1:32:28] she walked in there and said well this
[1:32:30] this will be a piece of cake that's my
[1:32:31] dad that's the judge you know what he is
[1:32:33] he's a just judge so whenever she came
[1:32:36] in and she pleaded her case well you
[1:32:38] know I I wasn't really paying attention
[1:32:40] but you know I was talking on the phone
[1:32:41] to my friend and you know how how kids
[1:32:43] do and you know I got to go a little
[1:32:44] fast I didn't mean to and her daddy
[1:32:46] looked down at her he said you're
[1:32:48] guilty she thought he had set her free
[1:32:50] you're guilty see because he's a just
[1:32:52] father and he called her guilty but
[1:32:55] after she was guilty she said now you go
[1:32:57] over there to the bayith table and take
[1:32:59] care of your debt you got to find so the
[1:33:01] girl walks over and then the daddy takes
[1:33:03] up he gets down he takes his robe off
[1:33:05] and he walks off the bench he walks over
[1:33:07] the B table and he takes his checkbook
[1:33:09] out and he writes a check for the fine
[1:33:10] and pays it see he's a just God but he's
[1:33:13] still your father see he's not he's not
[1:33:16] changing the rules for you he's not
[1:33:18] bending the rules for you trying to make
[1:33:20] us illegitimate children but he's a just
[1:33:22] God but he's still your father he's a
[1:33:24] merciful god even whenever we're found
[1:33:25] guilty he says you're guilty by law
[1:33:27] you're found guilty the I I made the law
[1:33:30] and you're found guilty but I'll have
[1:33:32] mercy upon you I I'll save you I'll I'll
[1:33:34] pay the price and make sure that that's
[1:33:36] what he done on the cross of Calvary
[1:33:38] brother Wesley paid the price that we'd
[1:33:39] be able to stand before a just judge and
[1:33:42] the debt would be paid he's our father
[1:33:44] it comes with privileges he's a place of
[1:33:47] Refuge the children of God they're
[1:33:49] protected they have a they have an
[1:33:52] ability to sense the enemy brother said
[1:33:54] this what the spirit of God does he said
[1:33:56] there's something about a child of God
[1:33:57] when you're born by the spirit of God
[1:33:59] and receive the holy spirit that you can
[1:34:00] sense the enemy just like a deer you
[1:34:03] ever noticed a deer out in the woods and
[1:34:05] it's just something about them you don't
[1:34:06] have to make a noise or nothing but
[1:34:08] there's something about them that are so
[1:34:09] finicky whenever they sense that
[1:34:11] something's there there's something
[1:34:12] about their nature so that's the way a
[1:34:14] Son of God is that you have the ability
[1:34:16] to sense the enemy that's the Holy Ghost
[1:34:18] in you that tells you that something
[1:34:20] just ain't right you go to you you hear
[1:34:22] something's preacher that just ain't
[1:34:23] right it don't it don't you ever done
[1:34:25] that it just don't feel right it don't
[1:34:27] there's something in you it just don't
[1:34:28] it just a't what is it's it's it's
[1:34:30] trying it's something that senses the
[1:34:32] enemy you realize that Satan is always
[1:34:34] trying to come in he's trying to to
[1:34:35] destroy you and trying to lead us astray
[1:34:37] said but God gave us something that
[1:34:39] could sense him when he comes you you
[1:34:40] believe that you see Satan he's trying
[1:34:42] to sneak into the church that's what
[1:34:43] he's doing this morning he's trying to
[1:34:45] sneak into the church around the world
[1:34:47] and take the life of God out of the
[1:34:49] church he's trying to take the spirit of
[1:34:51] God out of the church but friends I've
[1:34:52] got news for you is not going to succeed
[1:34:55] at it because we are children of God how
[1:34:59] many says that with me we are children
[1:35:00] of God somebody say I'm a child of God
[1:35:03] and because I'm a Child of God then
[1:35:05] there's something in me that's calling
[1:35:07] out for the supernatural there there's
[1:35:08] something in me that senses what Satan's
[1:35:11] trying to do and he's trying to bring
[1:35:12] coldness into my life he's trying to
[1:35:14] bring coldness into the Church of the
[1:35:16] Living God but I am a child of God I'm a
[1:35:19] Son of God and I've got a right by by
[1:35:22] the power of God to came against what
[1:35:24] Satan is trying to do and say Satan you
[1:35:26] can't take another one you can't bring
[1:35:28] coldness into their life you can't take
[1:35:30] the Revival out of their heart you can't
[1:35:32] drag them back into the world you won't
[1:35:34] drag them back into a barroom or
[1:35:36] something because I am a child of God
[1:35:38] and I've got a right to stand upon his
[1:35:40] word there's something calling out for
[1:35:42] the supernatural it's calling out it
[1:35:44] won't stand by and let Satan come in and
[1:35:47] Rob us of our Victory I won't let Satan
[1:35:49] rob me of my Revival I ain't going to
[1:35:51] let him take the dancing and the spirit
[1:35:53] out of the the church I ain't going to
[1:35:54] let him take the shouting out of the
[1:35:56] church or singing in the spirit out of
[1:35:58] the church because I am a child of
[1:36:01] God and I sense what the devil's trying
[1:36:04] to do I sense the coldness that he's
[1:36:06] trying when he tries to bring it in my
[1:36:08] life but something in me comes rising up
[1:36:10] and says Satan you're a liar I'm a child
[1:36:12] of God and I'm going to serve him anyway
[1:36:14] when you come to the house of God and
[1:36:16] all of a sudden you well I just can't
[1:36:18] worship God like I used to you say I
[1:36:20] sense what the devil's trying to do and
[1:36:22] say Satan you're Li I'm a daughter of
[1:36:24] God I'm a child of God and I'm going to
[1:36:27] worship God like I
[1:36:29] should I'm going to worship him like I
[1:36:31] should why I'm going to stand on his
[1:36:33] promises I'm going to stand for what's
[1:36:35] right I'm going to stand for truth why
[1:36:38] because I've been identified with Jesus
[1:36:40] Christ I've been identified with by new
[1:36:43] birth I wonder how many this morning can
[1:36:45] say I identify with the Holy Ghost I can
[1:36:49] identify with the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:51] Ghost I can identify with laying hands
[1:36:53] on the sick and them recovering I
[1:36:55] identify with a move of God in the
[1:36:57] church I identify with spiritual worship
[1:37:00] I identify with people dancing in the
[1:37:02] spirit I identify with people shouting I
[1:37:04] identify with people saying amen I
[1:37:06] identify with the move of God and I'm
[1:37:09] proud to say it I identify with it
[1:37:12] because I believe it's God's will I
[1:37:14] identify it's the spirit of God that
[1:37:16] gives life to the word of God I know
[1:37:18] some some aren't convinced yet you but
[1:37:21] you know they they say well I want God
[1:37:23] to use me I want to be filled with the
[1:37:24] power of God but they're not convinced
[1:37:26] of who they are I want God to use me but
[1:37:29] you realize in order for you to be
[1:37:30] convinced of who you are then you first
[1:37:32] must first be convinced of who God is
[1:37:35] see how can you be a child of God you
[1:37:37] don't ain't even convinced who God is
[1:37:39] when need to be convinced first of who
[1:37:41] God is convinced that God is real isn't
[1:37:44] this what you think about what this the
[1:37:46] world this is what the whole world says
[1:37:47] you convince me then I'll be a believer
[1:37:50] convince me God's real then I'll then
[1:37:51] I'll serve him you convince me to
[1:37:53] believe that message then I'll believe
[1:37:54] it you convince me see brother B said
[1:37:56] but they but they've got to be convinced
[1:37:58] first he said but the problem is there's
[1:38:00] only one convincing thing it's the
[1:38:02] gospel being identified in you see
[1:38:05] that's the only thing that'll ever
[1:38:06] really convince you is when the gospel's
[1:38:07] identified in you it takes a real
[1:38:09] identity it takes the the the
[1:38:11] manifestation or the identity of the
[1:38:13] Gospel of Jesus Christ being identified
[1:38:15] in you that's what convinces you you
[1:38:17] know let me let me explain that what it
[1:38:19] what it means is that whenever the
[1:38:20] gospel comes into you and it it changes
[1:38:22] your nature then you're convinced
[1:38:25] because you know what you used to be are
[1:38:28] you hearing me so it's not what God can
[1:38:30] do it's what God did and so therefore
[1:38:33] I'm convinced that God can do it nobody
[1:38:35] can make me doubt I'm convinced that God
[1:38:37] can take a life and and change it I'm
[1:38:39] convinced that God can take a drug
[1:38:41] addict and take the desire to do drugs
[1:38:43] out of their life I'm convinced that God
[1:38:45] can take an is there somebody convinced
[1:38:46] this morning why because the gospel's
[1:38:48] been identified in you I'm convinced
[1:38:50] that God can take an alcoholic when you
[1:38:52] couldn't go to bed without drinking a
[1:38:54] bunch of alcohol and then pass out and
[1:38:56] you called that a good night's rest but
[1:38:58] whenever God can take that out of your
[1:38:59] life and now you can't stand the smell
[1:39:01] of it without throwing up it convinces
[1:39:03] you because it's the gospel that has
[1:39:05] been identified in you and when he
[1:39:08] identifies in you then you become
[1:39:10] convinced say see so not only do we want
[1:39:13] to be identified with the gospel brother
[1:39:14] Mark but we need the gospel to be
[1:39:16] identified in us we need it to be
[1:39:18] identified in us I want to be
[1:39:20] identifiable by the Gospel of Jesus
[1:39:22] Christ I want to be identified by when
[1:39:24] people come by and say that's a child of
[1:39:26] God right there that's a daughter of God
[1:39:28] right that's a Son of God because I want
[1:39:30] the gospel to be identified in me it
[1:39:33] must become your identity who you are in
[1:39:36] other words the only way it can become
[1:39:37] who you are you you need to Bear the
[1:39:39] characteristics of it you become become
[1:39:41] the nature of it and see once once you
[1:39:43] see the gospel identified in you well
[1:39:46] then you can truly be convinced of who
[1:39:47] God is a personal experience not just
[1:39:50] some emotional workup like people try to
[1:39:52] work people into it but a real personal
[1:39:54] experience and the gospel being
[1:39:55] identified in you that's what the
[1:39:57] world's
[1:39:58] missing that's what they're missing is a
[1:40:00] real gospel identified in a person's
[1:40:03] life but that's what we need a personal
[1:40:06] experience you know it's so sad you look
[1:40:09] around this world today and people they
[1:40:11] just wander in and out of
[1:40:12] church they just wander in wonderand out
[1:40:15] you ever see somebody wandering it's a
[1:40:17] sad thing to see somebody in that
[1:40:19] condition in the natural to see you know
[1:40:23] maybe Amnesia or something that would
[1:40:24] come and they forget who they are and
[1:40:27] they they lose that identity and it's a
[1:40:29] sad thing to see but friends let me tell
[1:40:30] you something the the the the natural
[1:40:33] Amnesia I would much rather see a person
[1:40:36] in that condition than a person with
[1:40:37] spiritual Amnesia see a person with that
[1:40:40] natural Amnesia There's Hope in a few
[1:40:42] days they're going to have a new body
[1:40:43] all that'll pass away from them they
[1:40:45] won't be in that condition any longer
[1:40:47] their mind will come back they'll be in
[1:40:49] in Perfection this is this is the hope
[1:40:51] of the Natural Body no matter what the
[1:40:52] sick is in a natural body but you think
[1:40:55] a person that is lost spiritually and
[1:40:56] they're wandering there is no hope there
[1:40:59] they they if they died in that condition
[1:41:00] they'd be lost they they got to be able
[1:41:02] to come out of it so it's just a sad
[1:41:04] thing that people just wander around
[1:41:06] they wander in and out they wander in
[1:41:08] church they wander into a pray line they
[1:41:09] wander out of a prayer line they
[1:41:11] wonderand they're just kind of wandering
[1:41:12] around you ever seen about they they
[1:41:13] they they they don't they they they
[1:41:15] don't know what they believe they don't
[1:41:16] know who they are they have no identity
[1:41:18] they're just wandering wandering around
[1:41:19] I wonder I wonder if God can I wonder if
[1:41:22] God will I wonder it just wonders and
[1:41:24] wonders you realize what what it means
[1:41:26] to wonder it means to walk aimlessly in
[1:41:28] other words it means they have no
[1:41:30] Direction they're just wondering
[1:41:32] wonderand to church on Sunday wonderand
[1:41:34] out of church Wonder to church on
[1:41:36] Wednesday wonderand out of church but
[1:41:37] you realize that God he didn't call us
[1:41:40] to wander he didn't call us to wander
[1:41:43] around brother Mark and just wander in
[1:41:44] and out but he called us to a place of
[1:41:46] perfection he called us to a stature of
[1:41:49] a perfect man you know you know what the
[1:41:50] Bible said he called us from the
[1:41:52] foundation of Faith to the Capstone of
[1:41:54] love that's what God wants in you it's
[1:41:56] the stature of a perfect man and he's
[1:41:58] called you to this place of perfection
[1:42:00] all the way to perfect love where that
[1:42:01] you're not that you're not just people
[1:42:03] don't have to you know most people
[1:42:04] people are walking around wondering
[1:42:06] people walking about them are wondering
[1:42:07] too they're wondering who they are and
[1:42:09] why they come to church and what what
[1:42:11] they believe and are they a Christian
[1:42:12] some days they look like it some days
[1:42:14] they don't it makes other people wonder
[1:42:15] too but God didn't call us to wonder he
[1:42:18] called us to be perfect he called us to
[1:42:21] be in that's what the Bible said he says
[1:42:22] Be you therefore perfect even as your
[1:42:24] father in Heaven is perfect you said
[1:42:26] well I'll never be that but let me ask
[1:42:29] you this question this morning I know
[1:42:30] we're about to wrap up let me ask you
[1:42:32] this has God changed you in any way
[1:42:34] somebody raise your hand if you know
[1:42:36] that God has changed you I want to see
[1:42:39] look around okay I don't see a hand that
[1:42:41] isn't up God has changed you in some way
[1:42:43] you really believe that now let me ask
[1:42:45] you this if God has changed you do you
[1:42:47] not think he can keep changing
[1:42:50] you isn't it something it's an odd thing
[1:42:53] thing that I want you to get past this
[1:42:54] morning that people think that when God
[1:42:56] changes you he just changed you enough
[1:42:59] to get you on a church pew and now
[1:43:01] you're here this morning so now you
[1:43:03] wander around but that ain't what God
[1:43:05] called you to he didn't change you you
[1:43:07] think about it he didn't change you just
[1:43:09] enough to sit on a Pew he didn't change
[1:43:11] you just enough to come to church on
[1:43:13] Sunday he didn't change you just enough
[1:43:14] to be dedicated on a Wednesday night he
[1:43:16] didn't change you just to come to the
[1:43:18] house of God and go home and be a a
[1:43:20] dedicated Church goer he didn't change
[1:43:22] you but listen listen what the Bible
[1:43:23] says he said as we beheld the glory of
[1:43:26] God we are changed into the same image
[1:43:28] from Glory unto Glory even by the spirit
[1:43:31] of God so God is changing you he's not
[1:43:34] he's constantly changing you and if God
[1:43:36] has ever changed you if he's brought you
[1:43:38] this far then he's going to keep
[1:43:39] changing you he didn't bring you this
[1:43:41] far just to leave you on a church pew
[1:43:43] and say well I made it now now what but
[1:43:45] he's constantly changing you and the
[1:43:47] work that God done in you ain't nothing
[1:43:49] compared to the work that God is going
[1:43:51] to do in you he's con ly changing you
[1:43:54] and growing you and building you and
[1:43:56] making you into His Image the Bible said
[1:43:58] from Glory un Glory he's changing us
[1:44:00] into the image that we behold you see he
[1:44:03] changes us he's in you even when you
[1:44:06] don't see him by Spirit you realize that
[1:44:10] we don't let our flesh rule over us
[1:44:11] because he's in us it's Christ that is
[1:44:13] in you remember the Bible says we're
[1:44:15] made up of Body Soul and Spirit we're
[1:44:16] trium beings whenever a person dies they
[1:44:19] gave up the ghost remember the spirit
[1:44:20] would leave them and what God does he
[1:44:23] came down in the spirit to dwell inside
[1:44:25] of a man and so now that spirit of God
[1:44:27] is in you even whenever sometimes it
[1:44:30] seems like it ain't sometimes we get
[1:44:32] backslid sometimes we get a little cold
[1:44:34] and indifferent it it just seems like it
[1:44:36] isn't there we go through we go through
[1:44:38] so much trouble sometimes but the SK
[1:44:41] isn't it something to think that the
[1:44:42] spirit of God is so close I know this is
[1:44:44] something you've heard before but the
[1:44:45] Lord put it on my heart that the spirit
[1:44:47] of God is so close but yet sometimes it
[1:44:50] seems so far
[1:44:51] away isn't that something if I told you
[1:44:53] to go get your arm it'd be easy to get
[1:44:55] well I got it but the spirit of God even
[1:44:58] though it's dwelling in you it seems
[1:45:00] like that we're praying for God to come
[1:45:01] down off a mountain somewhere and come
[1:45:04] back send a prophet off a mountain
[1:45:05] somewhere and bring the spirit of God
[1:45:07] back to us it we we get in that
[1:45:09] condition you say what it what is it
[1:45:10] it's a mind it's a mind battle it's your
[1:45:13] mind that's blocking you from what's
[1:45:15] really already there to see CU it's
[1:45:17] already in you the power that you need
[1:45:18] is in you Christ is in you see so when
[1:45:20] you call on him what you have need of
[1:45:22] he's waiting he he's there but he's not
[1:45:24] forceful he's not he's not he he's still
[1:45:27] a gentleman he he's still trying to lead
[1:45:29] you but he's waiting on you to call on
[1:45:31] him isn't it something for Christ to be
[1:45:33] in you say how can that be that Christ
[1:45:34] is in you yet he's wait I always thought
[1:45:36] it was such a paradox that he was here
[1:45:38] the whole time and he was an OM
[1:45:41] omnipresent God yet he would wait on you
[1:45:43] to call him on the scene I always
[1:45:44] thought what a paradox that is but he's
[1:45:46] in you but he's waiting on you to call
[1:45:48] him why it's it's like the disciples was
[1:45:50] that day in the boat the Bible said they
[1:45:51] went out across the boat and as they
[1:45:53] crossed the sea the wav the waves begin
[1:45:55] to uh overtake the boat and it begin to
[1:45:58] torment them and the wind was tormenting
[1:45:59] them and brother Mark as the waves got
[1:46:01] great they said but Jesus was asleep in
[1:46:03] the boat and finally somebody said why
[1:46:06] don't we go wake Jesus and let him Cal
[1:46:09] the storm you see that's what brother
[1:46:11] said that's what we have to do is we
[1:46:12] have to wake the Jesus that is in US you
[1:46:15] have to call him on the scene it ain't
[1:46:17] that God has gone off somewhere and and
[1:46:19] he's gone away and he ain't here and he
[1:46:21] don't have nothing to do with you but
[1:46:22] sometimes times you just have to awake
[1:46:23] the Jesus that is in you and call him on
[1:46:26] the scene you say well how do you awake
[1:46:27] him he said you awake him by believing
[1:46:29] his word and Faith brings him on the
[1:46:31] scene and that's what brings him that's
[1:46:33] what brings him down says see so when
[1:46:35] then you call on him to confirm his word
[1:46:37] and you don't doubt it in your heart you
[1:46:39] don't fear you don't do it you just
[1:46:41] believe him as it is written and you let
[1:46:43] it be done and God will prove to you
[1:46:45] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:46:48] today and forever I wonder how many this
[1:46:51] morning can say but mat that's what we
[1:46:52] need to do I want to awake him let me
[1:46:54] just believe his word by believing his
[1:46:56] word it awakens the Christ that is in
[1:46:59] you let me tell you it builds faith in
[1:47:00] you that's why all of a sudden when you
[1:47:02] were down in the dumps oh you you got a
[1:47:03] little bit of a smile and something
[1:47:05] begins to build up what's happening it's
[1:47:07] that that Christ in you that is becoming
[1:47:09] awake you're Awakening by believing his
[1:47:11] word saying I don't have to be down I
[1:47:13] don't have to be tormented I don't have
[1:47:15] to be sick I don't have to be beat up I
[1:47:17] don't have to go through I I I got a
[1:47:18] right to be free I got a right to
[1:47:20] Victory I got a right to have joy I got
[1:47:22] a right to have peace in my life and by
[1:47:24] believing the word of God it awakens the
[1:47:26] Christ that is in you and all of a
[1:47:29] sudden it changes the circumstance you
[1:47:31] live in as a music players would come
[1:47:32] this morning say see that's what we're
[1:47:34] doing we're calling him on the scene an
[1:47:36] invisible God many people they're
[1:47:39] looking to a god that they can see but
[1:47:41] do you realize if you could see him this
[1:47:42] morning it wouldn't even be true if a
[1:47:46] man walked on this platform with a crown
[1:47:47] of thorns and nail scars in his hands
[1:47:50] and walked up here and appeared before
[1:47:52] you I would rebuke it because the Bible
[1:47:54] says he wouldn't be here he wouldn't be
[1:47:56] here during this age he won't be
[1:47:58] appeared in this time until this Earth
[1:48:00] is burned over he'll never step a foot
[1:48:01] on it in that Natural Body it wouldn't
[1:48:04] even be right it's not even scriptural
[1:48:06] any Hollywood actor could do that any
[1:48:08] little Hollywood magician can make it
[1:48:10] appear like here's a man with a crown of
[1:48:12] thorns you see if you're looking for
[1:48:13] that to be convinced you'll never be
[1:48:16] convinced because Satan's done built up
[1:48:18] enough things to keep it from convincing
[1:48:19] you well that's just an actor that's
[1:48:21] just trickery that's just lighting he's
[1:48:25] done built up enough to that you
[1:48:26] wouldn't even believe it but God had to
[1:48:28] do something that would convince you
[1:48:30] said how would he convince you he would
[1:48:32] bring his Spirit Into You The Gospel as
[1:48:36] it was preached and allowed to enter
[1:48:37] into your life and that gospel would
[1:48:40] make you identified as a Believer it
[1:48:43] would change your identity and that
[1:48:45] would convince you of who you are a son
[1:48:49] and a daughter of God see to see him his
[1:48:52] works said his gospel is
[1:48:54] preached he wants to see it he wants to
[1:48:57] see the same works that was in Jesus
[1:49:00] manifested in
[1:49:02] you this is what God Is Waiting on Jesus
[1:49:05] said the works that I do shall you do
[1:49:06] also these signs shall follow them that
[1:49:09] believe let Christ be awakened in
[1:49:12] you oh son and daughter of God oh child
[1:49:16] of God let Christ be awakened in you let
[1:49:21] him be awakened in your your worship let
[1:49:24] didn't be awakened in your going to
[1:49:26] church let didn't be awakened in your in
[1:49:29] your everyday life when you go to work
[1:49:31] let Christ be awakened in you be
[1:49:33] identified by the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:49:37] let the gospel be identified in you
[1:49:40] don't just stop brother Wesley just
[1:49:42] filling up a Pew that's not what we want
[1:49:44] but I want to be identified as a child
[1:49:46] of God won't you stand to your feet this
[1:49:48] morning how many say brother Matt that's
[1:49:50] the desire of my heart
[1:49:53] let him be awakened in me let me be
[1:49:55] identified with him and him be
[1:49:57] identified with
[1:49:58] me our identity has
[1:50:02] changed don't
[1:50:04] stop don't feel a
[1:50:07] Pew don't feel a Pew go all the way run
[1:50:12] the race that is set before you go all
[1:50:14] the
[1:50:16] way Paul said lay aside every weight and
[1:50:19] run the race every weight and sin that
[1:50:22] easily besets us and run with patience
[1:50:25] the race that is set before
[1:50:26] us and you know what he said he said and
[1:50:28] in this there is a cloud of
[1:50:31] witnesses a great cloud of
[1:50:34] witnesses that have gone before us so
[1:50:36] therefore run your race you know what I
[1:50:39] thought about when I read that I
[1:50:40] remember whenever I was a young man I
[1:50:42] was about the ninth grade and you know I
[1:50:46] I I was pretty fast for the kids my age
[1:50:48] but when they put us in the track team
[1:50:49] we got in there and all the kids were
[1:50:51] Juniors and seniors and may you you
[1:50:52] couldn't keep up with those guys I
[1:50:54] remember going out there and well they
[1:50:56] just they just they just beat your socks
[1:50:58] off so the coach come out one day he
[1:51:00] said well here's what we're going to do
[1:51:02] he said today we're going to learn how
[1:51:03] to run the mile some of you got to run
[1:51:05] the mile some of you going to run the
[1:51:06] 440 or relay some of you's going to run
[1:51:09] the 40 yard dash some's running the 100
[1:51:11] yard dash some of you big boys you're
[1:51:13] going to do the shot put everybody had
[1:51:15] to have a position when we came into
[1:51:17] this race said I want youall line up on
[1:51:19] the track and then Coach gave us some
[1:51:21] advice he said now face yourself you
[1:51:23] don't want to lose all your energy at
[1:51:24] the beginning I don't know a lot about
[1:51:26] running the mile but you'll figure it
[1:51:27] out but if you get wore out your time
[1:51:29] will go down and I lined up with all
[1:51:31] them seniors and juniors and thought man
[1:51:33] here we go again but see what they
[1:51:35] didn't have at their house they lived in
[1:51:37] the city what they didn't have at their
[1:51:38] house they didn't have Village Creek and
[1:51:40] this 40 acres of pasture that was around
[1:51:43] Village Creek and the farmers had come
[1:51:45] and they made this dirt path this little
[1:51:47] Levy all the way around it where they
[1:51:48] drive their tractors around and we go
[1:51:50] out there all the time as kids and I
[1:51:51] used to love to run around that and if I
[1:51:53] ever got started I go I run all the way
[1:51:55] around that whole thing and I I don't
[1:51:56] know how far it was I never measured it
[1:51:58] but it was a pretty good it was a pretty
[1:51:59] good field it had to be a mile 40 acres
[1:52:02] so quarter quarter mile around each each
[1:52:05] segment so I I run around it all the
[1:52:07] time why I didn't know what I was
[1:52:08] training for so I come out there during
[1:52:10] that race and you know he said run with
[1:52:12] run run it and and you know just be you
[1:52:14] know pace yourself we got out there
[1:52:16] running and man they they let the gun go
[1:52:19] the whistle blow and them boys took off
[1:52:20] out there and brother Tom I got in
[1:52:22] behind them and I knew right fast if I
[1:52:24] ran at the pace they were running I
[1:52:25] would never be able to make it to the
[1:52:26] end so I just backed off like well I
[1:52:29] just can't beat them I was just a kid I
[1:52:31] can't beat them they beat me every time
[1:52:32] I raced them so it was no TR mess with
[1:52:35] trying to do it now so I just kept
[1:52:36] running by the about the second lap I
[1:52:39] still remember this like it was
[1:52:40] yesterday cuz it was a big thing for me
[1:52:41] cuz I always lost against them about the
[1:52:43] second lap they were half a track ahead
[1:52:46] of me two boys they were half a track
[1:52:49] and I looked all me I'm jogging down the
[1:52:51] track and look over there like and there
[1:52:52] ain't no way I mean how in the world are
[1:52:55] they that fast I mean what did God give
[1:52:57] them he didn't give me and I looked at
[1:52:59] their legs and looked at mine I figured
[1:53:00] it out but there are half a track ahead
[1:53:03] of me but brother Mark I just kept on
[1:53:05] kept on going kept my pace and we came
[1:53:08] around the end of that lap and I was a
[1:53:10] little bit closer started on the third
[1:53:13] lap and got about halfway around it and
[1:53:15] I was only about a 100 yards behind them
[1:53:17] and right whenever we got to the end of
[1:53:19] that third lap I thought that I had lost
[1:53:22] account of the laps and they had all
[1:53:25] made it before me and I thought because
[1:53:28] I was the only one still running that I
[1:53:30] had lost count of the laps but I still
[1:53:32] had some left in the tank so I thought
[1:53:34] I'm just going to make another lap but
[1:53:36] really they had all run out of steam and
[1:53:38] all those sprinters a third lap right
[1:53:41] when we started at the Finish Line they
[1:53:42] beat me and then I passed them and I was
[1:53:44] I was almost 3/4 of a track ahead of
[1:53:46] them I turned it on and ran around that
[1:53:48] track as free as I could I said well
[1:53:50] they may have made it but I'm going to
[1:53:51] make this in the best I could no coach
[1:53:52] he got the hollering that's the best
[1:53:54] mile I've ever seen you beat all of them
[1:53:56] they're seniors how'd you beat them I
[1:53:58] didn't know I thought they I I thought
[1:54:00] we ran more said no they they just ran
[1:54:02] out of steam you know I went on the
[1:54:05] track team and we ran and we'd go out
[1:54:07] there and run in that in that race on
[1:54:09] the track and you know what the be the
[1:54:10] best part is after you had run all these
[1:54:12] races then they put you in the relays
[1:54:13] and before long you run so many races it
[1:54:15] was you was tired by the time you got to
[1:54:17] the mile but there was something about
[1:54:19] when you come out down that last eighth
[1:54:20] of a mile and all your friends were
[1:54:22] sitting over there in the bleachers and
[1:54:24] they started hollering at you in all the
[1:54:26] schools and they had all their colors
[1:54:28] and here all your friends they got to
[1:54:29] holler it saying go Matt go give it all
[1:54:31] you got don't quit Matt go you can make
[1:54:33] it go make it to the Finish Line pass
[1:54:35] him don't let him catch you go Matt go
[1:54:38] there something about your friends
[1:54:39] encouraging you that would give you
[1:54:41] another step it would give you another
[1:54:43] boost it when you felt like giving up
[1:54:45] that would it was it would it would put
[1:54:47] something in the tank I I have an
[1:54:48] experience of that it put something else
[1:54:50] in the tank it made you run a little bit
[1:54:52] when you couldn't even feel your legs no
[1:54:53] more and you thought you was going to
[1:54:54] fall down but you just trusted by faith
[1:54:56] they were still there and you kept
[1:54:58] running gave everything that you had
[1:55:00] because there was a encouragement listen
[1:55:02] what Paul says he said run this race he
[1:55:05] said for there's a cloud of witnesses I
[1:55:07] thought isn't that something that here
[1:55:09] we had those witnesses that have gone on
[1:55:11] before us you realize what the Bible
[1:55:12] said he said Christ in you is the hope
[1:55:14] of all glory those prophets that have
[1:55:16] gone on before you they're W they're
[1:55:18] they're crying they're cheering You On
[1:55:20] th those that have died and gone on
[1:55:21] before you they're cheering your own
[1:55:23] they're the witnesses they're they're
[1:55:24] not they're not just Witnesses in Paul's
[1:55:26] day but brother Mark they're sitting
[1:55:27] there like Apostle Paul and Malachi and
[1:55:29] those prophets of old and Ezekiel and
[1:55:31] Daniel and they're looking over the
[1:55:33] banister today and they're crying out to
[1:55:35] the Bride of Jesus Christ in this age
[1:55:37] saying come on don't quit you can go
[1:55:39] another mile we prophesied about you we
[1:55:42] call we we put all of our faith knowing
[1:55:44] that you was going to make it to the end
[1:55:46] bring it home you're the last leg bring
[1:55:49] it home don't give up don't lay down
[1:55:52] don't quit don't don't quit now it ain't
[1:55:54] too heavy bring it home we gave our life
[1:55:58] for it carry it through we laid our life
[1:56:01] down they died at the tips of Roman
[1:56:04] Spears they were burned at the steak
[1:56:07] they were dumped hot oil on them and
[1:56:08] tart and feathered for this gospel and
[1:56:11] now they're crying out to you saying
[1:56:12] bring it home I wonder if there's
[1:56:15] somebody that's identified with the
[1:56:17] Gospel of Jesus Christ what an
[1:56:20] encouragement it is don't let me quit on
[1:56:22] the last leg let me bring it through let
[1:56:26] me manifest the life of Jesus Christ let
[1:56:28] me be a real son and daughter of God let
[1:56:30] me be identified in this world that
[1:56:32] there's still in the middle of Le oosa
[1:56:34] if the whole world wants to turn around
[1:56:36] let there still be a son and daughter of
[1:56:38] God in Black Rock Arkansas that'll stand
[1:56:40] for the Gospel of Jesus
[1:56:42] Christ bring it
[1:56:45] home bring it
[1:56:48] home don't quit don't give up bring it
[1:56:51] home
[1:56:56] they prophesied of you you're our
[1:56:59] hope bring it
[1:57:01] home may you bow your heads with me this
[1:57:04] [Music]
[1:57:07] morning a word of encouragement to every
[1:57:12] believer my you think about what we have
[1:57:14] a opportunity to be hear meetings coming
[1:57:18] up on Wednesday and tent meeting and so
[1:57:21] many people they need a they need a
[1:57:24] touch from God they need a real
[1:57:26] experience they don't need just need to
[1:57:28] come to a church and feel good they need
[1:57:31] a real experience they need a new
[1:57:33] birth here we have an opportunity to
[1:57:36] make an atmosphere for that to
[1:57:38] happen that the very God Of Heaven can
[1:57:42] come down and take a life and change it
[1:57:45] and dwell in it an old filthy dirty life
[1:57:49] that God would change it that's the
[1:57:52] opportunity that we
[1:57:54] have I wonder how many you lift your
[1:57:56] hands this morning and say Lord let me
[1:57:58] be present let me be

[1:58:08] me be a real testimony of the life of
[1:58:11] Jesus Christ I don't want to make
[1:58:13] excuses you know friends it's easy we
[1:58:16] could all make excuses of what other
[1:58:17] people did and why we are where we are
[1:58:19] how we got in this condition and what
[1:58:21] the other Church did did what the other
[1:58:23] Pastor did and what these other people
[1:58:24] said we could all make excuses but we
[1:58:27] didn't come to make excuses this morning
