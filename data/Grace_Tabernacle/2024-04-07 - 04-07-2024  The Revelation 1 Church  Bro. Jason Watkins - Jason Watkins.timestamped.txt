[44:12] South Carolina they were just
[44:15] like and I and I saw it and I said hey
[44:19] say what you want to about the south
[44:22] that nobody retires and moves up
[44:26] north
[44:27] just
[44:29] saying and uh they did what you did they
[44:32] laughed and we got a good laugh and that
[44:33] broke the ice and so I appreciated the
[44:36] Lord of lovely lovely people amen we got
[44:40] a family that goes to our church been
[44:42] there for about 15 years and he comes
[44:44] from the north and he wears a big
[44:46] t-shirt around and says I wasn't born in
[44:48] the South but I got here as quick as I
[44:52] could praise the Lord uh I I just
[44:55] counted a great privilege to be here and
[44:58] um known uh brother Matt uh for many
[45:02] years but we've never had a tremendous
[45:05] amount of Fellowship together so amen I
[45:09] I really deeply appreciated the almost
[45:12] instantaneous invitation I received to
[45:14] minister this morning amen and felt good
[45:17] in my heart to do it I know a lot of
[45:18] people in this area got a lot of many
[45:20] many friends amen so we just want to
[45:23] give our uh attention to the word for
[45:26] just a little little bit I'm not a
[45:28] marathon preacher but uh I told Brother
[45:31] Matt usually when I go somewhere uh and
[45:34] it's a Sunday morning I just imagine I'm
[45:36] home and uh so brother Matt said that's
[45:39] perfectly fine so would that be okay if
[45:41] I just imagine I'm home among home folk
[45:44] amen we're going to invite you to stand
[45:46] and turn into the Book of Revelation I
[45:47] apologize for not bringing my Bible I
[45:50] have a travel size Bible but I was
[45:53] trying to get by with just one little
[45:55] carry-on bag and trying to close it I
[45:57] just I I couldn't tell if I couldn't fit
[46:00] it or I didn't want to crush it so I
[46:02] said well I'll just take my iPad and
[46:06] we'll read uh read from
[46:09] that excuse
[46:12] me in uh in Revelation chapter
[46:17] 1 I want to read the first eight verses
[46:20] and I uh then we're going to turn back
[46:23] into the Old Testament for a brief
[46:25] reading amen if that microphone is
[46:28] that's I don't know if that's moving on
[46:29] my face or what uhuh should I bend it
[46:32] out a little bit maybe like that uh okay
[46:35] you might have to adjust
[46:54] okay no amen praise the Lord here all
[46:58] right amen I was preaching um that
[47:01] brother Blue's Church way out in the
[47:03] country it's an all black church and
[47:05] their microphone just went put it was
[47:09] done gone gave up the ghost went to a
[47:11] better world and they didn't have a
[47:14] backup system I said well hey I've
[47:16] preached this message on six of seven
[47:18] continents I preached plenty of times
[47:20] without a microphone I'll just preach
[47:21] without one now you got to preach really
[47:24] loud to to be louder than black folks
[47:27] and I really had to thunder it out there
[47:31] amen praise the Lord because they were
[47:33] running up at the at the helping me
[47:35] helping me and so um we we preached the
[47:38] whole sermon amen my voice knew it when
[47:41] I was finished but we got through it
[47:43] amen so if worse comes to worse we'll
[47:45] just shut it down or switch mics or
[47:47] whatever uh the AV men AV men are funny
[47:51] and particular and you can't they got to
[47:54] be right amen amen thank you s oh use
[47:58] this
[48:04] one all right praise the Lord oh even
[48:06] that sounds better for me praise God all
[48:10] right God bless you Revelation chapter
[48:12] one I want to speak to you this morning
[48:16] um on a on a thought that I've taught on
[48:19] and ministered on many times but always
[48:21] it seems in a different way and I never
[48:24] cease to be astonished at how many
[48:26] different directions the Lord will take
[48:28] me just starting with this scripture
[48:30] reading Revelation chapter 1 brother
[48:34] Brandon preached quite a bit out of the
[48:36] Book of Revelation I believe the Book of
[48:38] Revelation is the bride's book and uh I
[48:41] believe it's uh its Mysteries are for
[48:43] the Bride of this hour and brother
[48:45] brandham taught on it
[48:47] extensively um perhaps as much or more
[48:50] than any other book in the Bible and you
[48:52] don't hear uh Paul quoting from it
[48:55] because the apostle was already gone by
[48:57] the time it comes back um by the time
[49:00] John arrives back with it and so I
[49:03] believe it is um a book for the Bride of
[49:06] the end time now the the really the way
[49:08] that I know that is because when brother
[49:12] brandham went through it and when we
[49:14] read it with correct understanding it
[49:17] matches and dub tals everything Paul
[49:19] taught us amen and there's not anything
[49:23] in the message not not anything not a
[49:26] single teaching that brother brandham
[49:28] did not establish on the apostles Paul's
[49:31] Doctrine amen and so there's no doctrine
[49:34] that we have that is not established in
[49:37] Paul's writings and so I think that
[49:40] that's God's special way of doing it he
[49:42] bookends his ages with prophets puts one
[49:46] in the alpha church and puts another one
[49:47] in the Omega church amen are you
[49:50] thankful for God sending a
[49:52] prophet amen might say a little bit more
[49:55] about that as we go along
[49:57] Revelation 1 we'll read while you're
[49:59] standing verse one the revelation of
[50:03] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[50:06] show unto his servants things which must
[50:10] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[50:13] signified it by his Angel unto his
[50:15] servant John who bear record of the word
[50:19] of God and of the testimony of Jesus
[50:21] Christ and of all things that he saw
[50:24] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[50:27] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[50:30] those things which are written therein
[50:32] for the time is at hand John to the
[50:35] seven churches which are in Asia Grace
[50:37] be unto you and peace from him which is
[50:40] and which was which is to come and from
[50:43] the seven spirits which are before his
[50:45] throne and from Jesus Christ who is the
[50:48] faithful witness and the first begotten
[50:50] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[50:52] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[50:55] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[50:58] and hath made us Kings and Priests unto
[51:00] God and his father to him be glory and
[51:03] Dominion forever and ever amen behold he
[51:07] cometh with clouds and every eye shall
[51:10] see him and they also which pierced him
[51:13] and all the kindreds of the Earth shall
[51:15] wail because of him even so amen I am
[51:19] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[51:22] ending saeth the Lord which is and which
[51:25] was and which is to come the
[51:28] almighty let's pray Master we thank you
[51:32] for your word now there's as the as we
[51:35] read Lord there is a blessing in reading

[52:14] we are and we ask for you to take
[52:16] control of the service in Jesus name
[52:19] amen God bless you friends you can be
[52:25] seated
[52:37] while you're seated I want you to turn
[52:39] with me also to Second
[52:42] chonicles uh verse
[52:52] three I'm sorry chapter 2 second Cor
[52:56] chicles chap
[53:00] 2 and let's read from verse
[53:07] one and Solomon determined to build a
[53:10] house for the name of the Lord and a
[53:13] house for his kingdom and Solomon told
[53:17] out three
[53:18] score and 10,000 men to Bear burdens and
[53:22] four score th000 to heue in the mountain
[53:25] and 3,000 and 600 to oversee them and
[53:29] Solomon sent to heram the king of Tyrus
[53:32] saying as thou D deal with David my
[53:35] father and did send him Cedars to build
[53:38] him a house to dwell therein even so
[53:41] deal with me behold I build a house to
[53:46] the name of the Lord my God to dedicate
[53:49] it to him and to burn before him sweet
[53:52] incense and for the continual shoe bread
[53:55] and for the burn offering brings morning
[53:57] and evening on the sabbaths and on the
[53:59] new moons and on the solemn Feast of the
[54:02] Lord Our God this is an ordinance
[54:05] forever to Israel and the house which I
[54:09] build is great for Great Is Our God
[54:12] above all gods but who is able to build
[54:15] him a house seeing the heaven and Heaven
[54:19] of Heavens cannot contain him who am I
[54:23] then that I should build him a house
[54:26] save only to burn sacrifice before him
[54:29] send me now therefore a man cunning to
[54:33] work in gold and in silver and in brass
[54:36] and in iron and in purple and crimson
[54:39] and blue and that can skill to grave
[54:42] with the cunning men that are with me in
[54:44] Judah and in Jerusalem whom David my
[54:48] father did
[54:50] provide amen praise the
[54:54] Lord now this is an amazing
[54:57] undertaking that Solomon is attempting
[55:01] and he's been commissioned uh to build
[55:04] it by God we know that David desired to
[55:07] build a
[55:08] house excuse me unto the Lord and I
[55:12] apologize for my voice sometimes the U
[55:15] my morning voice is a little rough but
[55:17] I'll get it preached out and it won't
[55:18] bother me at all I promise you I just
[55:20] don't want it to bother you amen I'll
[55:22] preach right through it and blow it out
[55:24] nice and clean amen praise the Lord Lord
[55:27] so Solomon now in building this house
[55:32] you know he's given a commission and the
[55:34] little bit of the backstory to Solomon
[55:37] ending up as the chief builder of course
[55:40] he's the son of David and so David in
[55:43] the fatherhood Solomon in the sunship so
[55:45] you're this is why Jesus Christ was
[55:48] called the son of David because you
[55:49] understand the type he at being the Son
[55:52] of God and you find that David desired
[55:55] actually to build it Solomon is
[55:57] completing the desire of his father when
[56:00] Jesus came he said he was here to do the
[56:03] will of the father he said it's written
[56:05] in the Scrolls concerning me I have come
[56:08] to do thy will oh Lord he lived his
[56:11] whole life to serve the father he said
[56:13] Son does nothing but what he sees the
[56:16] father doing that doeth the son likewise
[56:19] this was a pattern that would exist in
[56:21] the church because Jesus was a prototype
[56:24] of a brand new type of human being
[56:26] born of the word of God he's the
[56:28] beginning of a new creation a brand new
[56:31] type of person and now God is going
[56:34] through Christ to continue the ministry
[56:37] of the son of man into a word body that
[56:40] fills up the Earth and this is exactly
[56:43] why brother brandham could talk about
[56:44] the bride and say that she's the word
[56:48] again made flesh dwelling in the earth
[56:50] that's the ministry of the son of man
[56:53] don't confuse the office of Son of Man
[56:56] man with the ministry of Son of Man the
[56:58] office of son of man is always a prophet
[57:01] that's why Jesus called himself son of
[57:03] man he came as a prophet prophets were
[57:05] eagles they came as as a son of man
[57:08] prophesy son of man that he would say in
[57:10] the Old Testament this is exactly why
[57:12] brother Brandon would refer to Jeremiah
[57:14] and say Jeremiah was Christ now he
[57:16] wasn't Jesus of Nazareth but he was the
[57:19] word coming through a man in flesh and
[57:22] that was the ministry of the son of man
[57:25] the the the M the office of son of man
[57:28] is important because you need a prophet
[57:32] in order to conduct you into the
[57:33] presence of God you can Benny Hinn can
[57:37] conduct you in under the anointing of
[57:39] God you can go to one of those meetings
[57:41] and you can actually feel this was a
[57:43] great mystery that brother Brandon
[57:45] preached that turned the theological
[57:46] World on its ear when he said it's
[57:49] absolutely a true anointing falling on a
[57:51] false
[57:52] vessel but he he was taught that by the
[57:55] Lord when he saw how that the remember
[57:59] the vision he said he I saw the wheat
[58:01] and it was panting for water and the
[58:04] weed beside it was panting for water and
[58:06] the rains came and the wheat and the
[58:09] weed raised up and said praise the Lord
[58:11] praise the Lord praise the Lord because
[58:13] the rain falls on the just and the
[58:16] unjust and so we realize then that
[58:20] excuse me that th that it's not just the
[58:24] anointing that we want to be taken into
[58:27] you can you can you don't even have to
[58:29] be a Christian to be blessed of God by
[58:31] following the word you can pay your
[58:34] tithes and offerings even as a sinner
[58:36] and God will bless you I know Sinners
[58:39] who have learned that secret businessmen
[58:42] who give under the cause of the gospel
[58:44] and God blesses them you can be healed
[58:47] even if you're not a Christian they ask
[58:49] brother Brandon do you have to be a
[58:51] Christian if you if you want to be
[58:52] healed and brother Brandon says no you
[58:54] don't have to be a Christian if you want
[58:56] to be healed but you you need to be a
[58:59] Christian if you want to stay healed see
[59:02] he said bring me a crossy child he said
[59:05] I'll straighten their eyes just by
[59:06] staring at them but of course as soon as
[59:09] they get outside the eyes will go right
[59:11] back cross again because they're just
[59:13] under that anointing I saw you know my
[59:16] drive here today I was finally ready to
[59:18] see a different name I'm glad I saw
[59:20] Grace Tabernacle because I keep seeing
[59:22] Faith Tabernacle and Faith Assembly and
[59:24] Faith this and faith that and I thought
[59:26] you know it's I I I I I I admire them
[59:31] for naming their church that and there's
[59:33] no doubt churches in the message that
[59:35] have that name but I I I know there's a
[59:38] difference between human faith and
[59:40] revealed faith and I know that the
[59:42] revealed faith is a person that the
[59:45] message of the hour is not books and
[59:47] tapes and quotes it's a
[59:49] person it's the person of the Lord Jesus
[59:52] Christ and so this is why we are not a
[59:55] denomination this is why that when you
[59:57] come to Christ you come to a bleeding
[1:00:00] word and so this is the ability of a
[1:00:02] prophet to take you into the presence of
[1:00:06] God you you remember that in the Old
[1:00:08] Testament just to give you a quick
[1:00:10] example you find that Aaron who had a
[1:00:14] Divine call amen he had thus sayith the
[1:00:16] Lord he was a priest he was in in the he
[1:00:19] was the tribe he was the high priest God
[1:00:21] he had a Divine commission but yet if
[1:00:24] Aaron went into the presence of the
[1:00:27] shikina if he went into the presence of
[1:00:29] the pillar of fire without blood he died
[1:00:34] see he had to have blood and His Garment
[1:00:37] had to be correct he had to be washed
[1:00:39] and clean and everything had to be
[1:00:41] exactly right or he perished but you'll
[1:00:44] notice that Moses went up the mountain
[1:00:46] and went in and out of the shikina glory
[1:00:49] never took a lamb never took a sacrifice
[1:00:51] never took blood never wore robes never
[1:00:54] had pomegranates or Bells because we
[1:00:57] realize that that that Moses as a
[1:00:59] prophet as a son of man the ministry the
[1:01:03] office of son of man is a Ministry of
[1:01:06] atonement and so so you you can you can
[1:01:09] have Ministry that can take you into the
[1:01:11] anointing of Christ but it takes a
[1:01:14] prophet's Ministry to conduct you into
[1:01:17] the presence of Christ because you have
[1:01:19] to have a blood sacrifice and this
[1:01:23] message is a bleeding word sacrifice
[1:01:26] Hallelujah so when you go into his
[1:01:28] presence you don't look at your own
[1:01:30] faults and your own mistakes you look at
[1:01:32] a blood atonement because you have
[1:01:34] believed and received the Living
[1:01:40] God so you find in fact is later on you
[1:01:44] find that God tells Moses says go down
[1:01:47] and tell the people don't touch the
[1:01:48] mountain don't break through unto me
[1:01:51] because otherwise I would have to
[1:01:52] slaughter them and that's his people he
[1:01:53] loved them God loved them but but he
[1:01:56] couldn't dwell he even told he even told
[1:01:58] Moses he said I can't dwell among the
[1:02:00] people cuz I would kill everybody see
[1:02:02] because I I I'm a holy God and they're
[1:02:04] stiff necked and they're rebellious and
[1:02:06] they sin he said I can't dwell among
[1:02:08] them so I'll send my angel and he will
[1:02:11] dwell among you see so it's God in a
[1:02:13] different form that and so Christ wasn't
[1:02:16] a second person he was the same person
[1:02:19] see so when you find David standing
[1:02:22] there Desiring to build a house unto God
[1:02:26] what was the purpose of the house so
[1:02:28] that God had a place where he could come
[1:02:31] and Men could come and they could have
[1:02:33] restored fellowship and so brother and
[1:02:35] so this is why Peter said you are a
[1:02:38] tabernacle you're a living Tabernacle
[1:02:40] and brother Brandon would preach that
[1:02:42] you're the living Tabernacle of the
[1:02:44] living God's presence and we're built up
[1:02:47] we're Lively Stones built up oh I going
[1:02:50] to tell you something friends it's
[1:02:51] wonderful to know the Living God it's
[1:02:54] wonderful to have have him living inside
[1:02:57] of you and so we we find that that he
[1:03:00] says to Moses tell him don't break
[1:03:03] through and the and Moses said Lord
[1:03:05] nobody can get up here we build a fence
[1:03:07] trust me uh I've got everybody at their
[1:03:09] post the deacons aren't going to let
[1:03:11] anybody break through and he says Moses
[1:03:13] go down go down and warn them again and
[1:03:17] this is the warning that denominational
[1:03:19] systems are not heeding and they're
[1:03:21] trying to break into the presence of God
[1:03:24] without a bleeding sacrifice
[1:03:26] and what does it do it's bringing
[1:03:28] spiritual death to them instead of
[1:03:30] life so he says go down Moses and warn
[1:03:34] them again not to try to break through
[1:03:36] to my presence and Moses turns to go
[1:03:39] down and he says Moses when you come
[1:03:41] back bring Aaron with you and when he
[1:03:44] brought Aaron with him they didn't bring
[1:03:45] a lamb they didn't bring a dove they
[1:03:47] didn't bring blood they didn't bring
[1:03:48] robes they didn't bring anything but
[1:03:50] Aaron was with Moses and he was standing
[1:03:53] under the umbrella Hallelujah
[1:03:56] standing under an
[1:03:58] atonement that's the that's the safety
[1:04:01] that's the privilege that you have to
[1:04:03] come boldly into the throne room of
[1:04:07] God this is where John was privileged to
[1:04:10] come to come boldly and so he had a he
[1:04:15] had a true Faith you know you can you
[1:04:17] can see people how that you know I I I
[1:04:20] was talking to a man and he was from a
[1:04:22] uh an Evangelical movement he was very
[1:04:25] familiar with the the message in fact is
[1:04:27] quite familiar with it his dad had been
[1:04:29] a message Minister for years and so he's
[1:04:32] now following this evangelist in his
[1:04:34] Lear Jets around the world and he says
[1:04:37] to me he says he says Miracles were just
[1:04:39] happen like popcorn and I said well of
[1:04:41] course I said it it operates off of
[1:04:43] Faith the disciples were casting out
[1:04:45] Devils before they were born again the
[1:04:48] disciples were casting out Devils just
[1:04:50] because Jesus told them they could and
[1:04:52] they believed in and it worked I said
[1:04:55] but then they came up upon a devil they
[1:04:57] couldn't move and they asked Jesus why
[1:04:58] he said well because this devil only
[1:05:00] comes out it's your unbelief you haven't
[1:05:03] been converted yet I'm here to tell you
[1:05:04] the power they had after the upper room
[1:05:06] was far superior to the power they had
[1:05:09] prior to the upper
[1:05:11] room so it's not unusual it's it's faith
[1:05:15] and it moves and so but but it's
[1:05:17] different when it's a revealed Faith
[1:05:18] it's beyond just human faith and so it's
[1:05:22] going to take that revealed Faith to get
[1:05:24] us in into the rapture this was this was
[1:05:27] the faith that God was bringing to John
[1:05:29] on the aisle of patmas a revealed faith
[1:05:32] when I read the first chapter of the
[1:05:35] Book of Revelation I cannot wrap my mind
[1:05:39] around somebody thinking that Jesus was
[1:05:42] someone other than almighty God when I
[1:05:44] read those words I say how do you
[1:05:47] conclude after you read this description
[1:05:50] of him he's the alpha he's the Omega
[1:05:53] he's the beginning he's the ending he's
[1:05:54] the first he's the last I mean my
[1:05:57] goodness how many Thrones did John see
[1:06:00] one how many did he see Seated on the
[1:06:02] throne one I mean how I that that's
[1:06:07] computable to me I see one on the throne
[1:06:09] there's one Hallelujah I find out that
[1:06:13] this one talking to John is the first
[1:06:15] and the last he's the beginning and the
[1:06:17] end the Bible in the Old Testament calls
[1:06:19] him the Everlasting
[1:06:20] [Music]
[1:06:22] father so I I am astonished that people
[1:06:25] Come Away with a a misunderstanding of
[1:06:28] who Christ was this was the this was the
[1:06:31] restoration under the of the open door
[1:06:33] that began at the end of the sixth age
[1:06:35] moving into that's why brother brandham
[1:06:37] said the Le to age in some respects
[1:06:39] could almost be considered an extension
[1:06:42] of the Philadelphian age after Wesley
[1:06:44] dies in the 1700s he sets an Open Door
[1:06:47] otherwise Wesley would have caught that
[1:06:48] being an angel he sets an Open Door
[1:06:51] which is a revelation of Christ and
[1:06:53] there's going to begin the restor ation
[1:06:56] of the deity of Jesus Christ and you get
[1:06:58] men in the end of the 1800s getting
[1:07:00] ready to go into the 20th century you
[1:07:02] get men like parum and lake and Grant
[1:07:04] and Seymour and and all of those isua
[1:07:07] Street fathers they were beginning to
[1:07:09] catch a revelation of the deity of Jesus
[1:07:11] Christ and they begin to baptize in Acts
[1:07:13] 238 they begin to believe that he was
[1:07:15] the same one God and so it was a it was
[1:07:19] a growing Revelation and and that's why
[1:07:21] when brother Brandon would come along he
[1:07:23] would say I'm I'm like one born out out
[1:07:25] a season by the time he gets there the
[1:07:27] church is already straying and it's all
[1:07:30] just like the early church it it's
[1:07:31] already straying and and he he's trying
[1:07:34] to set it back in order he's trying to
[1:07:35] say we're all one he's trying to restore
[1:07:37] Fellowship but that eventually that
[1:07:40] church would put Christ out and and and
[1:07:43] a prophet would have to come under an
[1:07:45] anointing of Malachi 4 and say now I
[1:07:48] indict this generation for the second
[1:07:50] crucifixion of Jesus Christ and I do so
[1:07:54] in the presence of the
[1:07:56] judge see so so you you you have this
[1:08:01] amazing Revelation that's being poured
[1:08:03] out and there here John begins brother
[1:08:07] Brandon when he's teaching on it when he
[1:08:08] he teaches a lot on it and I don't have
[1:08:10] time to read all the quotes today but
[1:08:12] but you can catch brother bram's
[1:08:14] teaching on Revelations you know 1 two
[1:08:16] and three and four and five and he he he
[1:08:18] he takes a lot of time teaching on those
[1:08:20] subjects he goes through and teaches you
[1:08:23] know we talk about the ages we talk
[1:08:24] about the SE he taught on the trumpets a
[1:08:26] lot of people think he didn't teach on
[1:08:27] the trumpets because they said well he
[1:08:29] only taught Feast of trumpets that's
[1:08:31] actually not accurate he just didn't
[1:08:33] title it the trumpets but he actually
[1:08:35] preached on all seven trumpets
[1:08:36] individually and and and preaches takes
[1:08:39] a whole week to preach on it and comes
[1:08:41] to the end of it and says now I think by
[1:08:43] now you've got a better understanding of
[1:08:46] those trumpets and if you read the
[1:08:47] sermons you do you have a tremendous
[1:08:49] understanding of it so I don't have time
[1:08:51] to get all in the weeds to that I don't
[1:08:52] mean to call it in the weeds
[1:08:54] but
[1:09:25] where wi the first begotten of the Dead
[1:09:26] the prince of the kings of the earth
[1:09:28] unto him that loved us and washed us
[1:09:29] from our sins in his own blood and
[1:09:31] brother brandham now says now that first
[1:09:34] five verses there should be no mistake
[1:09:37] who's doing the talking it's absolutely
[1:09:41] Jesus Christ it's none other than the
[1:09:44] Lord Jesus Christ himself who is now
[1:09:47] coming because now he has he's been he's
[1:09:50] been now he went back to being a pillar
[1:09:52] of fire and he now he understands all
[1:09:55] things brother brandham talks about in
[1:09:57] his Earthly Ministry there were things
[1:09:58] he didn't understand that he didn't know
[1:10:00] that's right off the tape don't hurl
[1:10:02] something at me and Jesus talks about
[1:10:04] that they ask him certain questions and
[1:10:06] he says only the father knows that and
[1:10:08] brother brandham says there were things
[1:10:09] he didn't know in his Earthly time said
[1:10:13] but then when he ascended on high and he
[1:10:16] went back he said I come from God I go
[1:10:18] back to God he went back to the pillar
[1:10:20] of fire and see that's why brother
[1:10:22] brandham explains that he says see talk
[1:10:25] about in MDC he said he knowed all
[1:10:27] things he said but you bypassed that see
[1:10:30] you come like me you come like Adam you
[1:10:32] went from thought to flesh and so Christ
[1:10:35] in his in in his flesh uh he actually
[1:10:38] goes and receives a great Revelation
[1:10:40] they want to know about the coming he
[1:10:42] doesn't know he tells them he doesn't
[1:10:43] know there's certain things they ask him
[1:10:45] he doesn't know the answer he tells them
[1:10:47] I don't know and brother Brandon points
[1:10:49] that out many many times on tape and and
[1:10:52] so you know it's it it's it's amazing
[1:10:54] that when comes back he now brings a
[1:10:58] complete revelation of the deity of
[1:11:01] Christ in these first five verses this
[1:11:04] is how brother brandham taught it you're
[1:11:05] welcome to go and check it out yourself
[1:11:07] that that that once he comes to the end
[1:11:09] of the fifth verse now he's going to
[1:11:12] bring a great mystery to the church
[1:11:14] beginning in verse 6 and hath made us
[1:11:17] Kings and Priests unto God and his
[1:11:19] father to him be glory and Dominion
[1:11:21] forever and ever and so be look it
[1:11:24] behold he cometh with CLS and every eye
[1:11:26] shall see him now watch this is not the
[1:11:28] secret Rapture because every eye shall
[1:11:31] see him and they also which pierced him
[1:11:34] and all the kindreds of the Earth shall
[1:11:37] whail not re can you imagine that you
[1:11:40] would could you imagine here today that
[1:11:43] you would see Jesus and you wouldn't
[1:11:45] Rejoice you'd
[1:11:47] wail can you IM get your mind wrapped
[1:11:49] around that but yet we realize that he's
[1:11:52] prophesying all the way to ur my day to
[1:11:56] the end time that there that now this
[1:11:58] Revelation is going to come back to the
[1:12:01] church at the end time that you also are
[1:12:04] Kings and Priests you also are part of
[1:12:06] God you also are part of the word you
[1:12:09] also are have a portion in God's plan
[1:12:14] and the world is moving off into
[1:12:15] judgment and when he comes back it's
[1:12:18] Revelation 19 the bride is with him
[1:12:20] riding white horses and every eye shall
[1:12:22] see him and they don't Rejoice they wait
[1:12:25] they're afraid they're terrified because
[1:12:27] they know they've missed
[1:12:30] it I'm glad on that Resurrection morning
[1:12:33] I'll know I've made it you'll know
[1:12:35] you've made it
[1:12:37] hallelujah oh
[1:12:39] [Applause]
[1:12:54] my
[1:13:15] I didn't say it he said it that you're
[1:13:18] part of God's godhead that's a strong
[1:13:21] statement no wonder he could say she is
[1:13:24] him
[1:13:25] now see he's not saying she's literally
[1:13:27] him I didn't die for you you don't
[1:13:30] baptize in my name you you don't you
[1:13:32] don't pray to me but she is him she's
[1:13:36] not literally him she's Mrs Jesus she's
[1:13:38] the
[1:13:39] continuation acts I mean Hebrews 138 is
[1:13:43] the key she's not literally him she's
[1:13:46] the same as him whenever he comes he's
[1:13:49] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:13:53] that's how you know what is the truth
[1:13:55] because it reproduces the same life and
[1:13:59] the same power and demonstration of the
[1:14:01] Holy
[1:14:02] Ghost
[1:14:04] Hallelujah so so when you see brother
[1:14:06] brandom teach on these things he's
[1:14:08] taking it back to scripture people who
[1:14:10] don't follow brother brandham listen
[1:14:12] when next time you listen to a tape just
[1:14:13] remember brother
[1:14:19] BR don't understand the missing element
[1:14:23] and the missing element was expression
[1:14:25] Jesus was the express image see and this
[1:14:29] is why this is exactly why brother
[1:14:31] Brandon would come and he would take a
[1:14:33] sermon Christ is the mystery of God
[1:14:39] revealed and he would say now he would
[1:14:41] he would describe it like this and he
[1:14:43] would say now he he has in in one place
[1:14:48] where he talks about how that he he
[1:14:50] doesn't reveal this great secret of his
[1:14:52] coming and he says and it's a good thing
[1:14:54] he has
[1:14:55] and then in the very next sentence he
[1:14:57] said he has revealed it in the lives of
[1:15:01] all the people all down Through the Ages
[1:15:04] see so it's he said now he said now
[1:15:07] tonight we're going to look at it and
[1:15:09] see exactly what it is and when you hear
[1:15:12] the sermon you realize the whole thing
[1:15:15] is expression he says God has has only
[1:15:18] had one goal one goal in all the Bible
[1:15:23] and he says and tonight we're going to
[1:15:25] to look at what that one goal is now he
[1:15:27] cut he he unfolds it in a three-fold way
[1:15:30] we know that unfolds it in a three-fold
[1:15:32] way but but his he has one goal and
[1:15:35] that's expression and he says and he
[1:15:37] showed it in the lives of all the people
[1:15:41] in the scriptures no wonder Jeremiah was
[1:15:44] Christ no wonder David could stand there
[1:15:48] and look out his window and a and a deep
[1:15:52] began to call to the deep and he he said
[1:15:55] behold I live in a house of Cedar but my
[1:15:58] but my God lives in a tent of skins and
[1:16:02] he says I want to build a house unto the
[1:16:05] Lord God and Nathan the prophet standing
[1:16:07] there and says David the lord loves you
[1:16:09] you're the apple of his eye you're in
[1:16:10] his heart do all that's in your heart
[1:16:12] for the Lord is with you later brother
[1:16:14] brandham says the Lord comes to the
[1:16:16] prophet and says now go back to David
[1:16:18] what you told him wasn't wrong but it
[1:16:20] can't go like he thinks because go and
[1:16:23] tell him David you can't build me a
[1:16:26] house now when you read the story out of
[1:16:28] First Kings you you don't or out of
[1:16:30] second uh Second Kings I think you don't
[1:16:32] it doesn't tell you why that David can't
[1:16:34] do it you have to Samuel didn't record
[1:16:36] that but when you go to the Chronicles
[1:16:40] when Ezra is writing the chonicles he
[1:16:42] records actually why David couldn't do
[1:16:45] it and the reason was is because he had
[1:16:47] been a bloody man he had killed too many
[1:16:50] people he had been a man of war a man of
[1:16:53] Vengeance a man of judgment and so David
[1:16:57] is what is David expressing David is the
[1:17:00] deep is calling to the Deep David is the
[1:17:02] father he's in the fatherhood and he has
[1:17:06] a desire to have a tabernacle where
[1:17:08] where communion can take place again oh
[1:17:12] Hallelujah where Fellowship that had
[1:17:13] been lost in the garden can be restored
[1:17:17] because that's what the father wanted
[1:17:19] but he says to David David you're like
[1:17:21] me you've killed lots of people you've
[1:17:23] been of judgment you've been of
[1:17:24] Vengeance your sword is bloody you can't
[1:17:27] build it but I'll raise up your
[1:17:30] son and I'll call his name peace
[1:17:33] Hallelujah and he it is who will build a
[1:17:36] temple and Christ the son of David is
[1:17:39] now a tabernacle where God and man are
[1:17:42] united
[1:17:46] again so then now we become the
[1:17:50] continuation of that exact same creation
[1:17:53] you get me
[1:17:55] you're you're with me you see the how
[1:17:57] we're unfolding this so so David is
[1:18:02] expressing the desire of God now here
[1:18:04] comes
[1:18:06] Solomon and what David is allowed to
[1:18:10] do is he's allowed to assemble all the
[1:18:13] parts all the pieces all the quarried
[1:18:18] all the wood all the trees but Solomon
[1:18:20] gets there and says my goodness my
[1:18:23] father has divided all the elements to
[1:18:26] build the temple but I don't know how to
[1:18:29] put it together now watch now he's now
[1:18:32] he's expressing the humanity see here's
[1:18:34] Christ even in his own Humanity there's
[1:18:37] certain things that he doesn't even have
[1:18:40] he's not privy to certain things until
[1:18:42] he goes back to the pillar of fire and
[1:18:45] now he knows all things and now he can
[1:18:47] bring the Revelation to John it's hard
[1:18:49] it's difficult to absorb and very hard
[1:18:52] to get our mind around the fact that you
[1:18:56] today because of the end time message
[1:18:58] which is a restoration of the whole mind
[1:19:00] of Christ that you today in your Earthly
[1:19:05] Journey understand more of the plan of
[1:19:08] God than Jesus actually did during his
[1:19:10] Earthly Journey things that he was
[1:19:13] unclear on you've already had the clear
[1:19:15] he's clear about it now because now he
[1:19:18] it is humanity went back to God and now
[1:19:21] that Revelation is brought to the church
[1:19:23] he brings it to John to give to the
[1:19:26] churches oh Hallelujah friends no wonder
[1:19:29] we need a message people say we don't
[1:19:31] need a message what how in the world are
[1:19:33] you ever going to know God without this
[1:19:37] message this thing isn't just a a
[1:19:39] retelling of a historical event from
[1:19:41] 2,000 years ago the world loves that
[1:19:44] story they're willing to worship that
[1:19:46] Jesus but Paul said my fear is that
[1:19:49] you'll worship another Jesus that I have
[1:19:52] not preached about and that's what the
[1:19:54] whole people say oh I just want Jesus I
[1:19:56] don't need a I don't need the message I
[1:19:58] don't need a prophet I just want Jesus I
[1:20:01] just say which
[1:20:02] one they say oh well there's only one I
[1:20:04] said not according to St Paul Paul was
[1:20:06] worried you'd worship another Jesus of
[1:20:10] manmade theology man-made invention
[1:20:14] organized human human Rel uh human
[1:20:18] organization and that's not Jesus and in
[1:20:21] fact his that that's the SE that's the
[1:20:24] secret that brother brandom said that
[1:20:25] will lead you to the mark of the beast
[1:20:29] and when you actually see Jesus you
[1:20:31] won't be rejoicing you'll be wailing
[1:20:34] because you realize you crucified Christ
[1:20:37] when you crucified the word because he
[1:20:40] was the
[1:20:42] word you believe it because you're a
[1:20:44] part of the
[1:20:46] word it's it's it's native to you the
[1:20:49] the truth is native to you it's it's
[1:20:52] that nature in the gene of God it wasn't
[1:20:54] the nature you were born with you were
[1:20:55] born with a fallen nature Paul taught us
[1:20:58] that we all at one time had our
[1:21:01] conversation in the lust of the flesh
[1:21:03] the things of the world and we were by
[1:21:04] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[1:21:07] others but I'll submit to you today that
[1:21:10] wasn't your original
[1:21:12] nature that's the nature you were
[1:21:14] trapped under your original nature was
[1:21:16] Zoe life and when an eagle screamed you
[1:21:20] responded why why do you believe because
[1:21:22] you can't not
[1:21:25] that's my favorite double negative I
[1:21:28] can't not believe Hallelujah so why you
[1:21:31] believe because I'm a
[1:21:33] Believer why do you say Amen to the word
[1:21:35] well there's parts of it I don't
[1:21:37] understand but there's some guy inside
[1:21:38] of me screaming amen amen amen amen
[1:21:41] there's an amen man inside of me do you
[1:21:45] have an amen man inside of
[1:21:48] [Applause]
[1:21:52] you so he comes here and he says you
[1:21:55] know he so Solomon now is saying you
[1:21:59] know send me therefore man showing this
[1:22:02] human Frailty you know it's it's good to
[1:22:05] always remember
[1:22:07] that that when you because a lot of
[1:22:10] times people get confused on the godhead
[1:22:11] and it's it's the very first thing that
[1:22:13] the gnostics began to attack in the
[1:22:15] early days of the early church that was
[1:22:17] one of the first things they begin to
[1:22:19] try to disconnect they tried to separate
[1:22:22] Jesus from the word and because if they
[1:22:25] can do that then it's an easy thing to
[1:22:26] get you to a trinitarian ideology or get
[1:22:29] you to miss the word or get you to
[1:22:30] accept some organized religion so they
[1:22:33] started the gnosticism the gnostics
[1:22:35] started attacking it and so that's why
[1:22:37] you know even in our own message ranks
[1:22:39] and we you had you had you know you got
[1:22:41] deity camps and you've got two Soul
[1:22:43] camps and you've got the and and all
[1:22:46] that is is re it's just reheated
[1:22:49] gnosticism if you understood the church
[1:22:51] history it's just reheated gnosticism is
[1:22:53] all it is and so they' they've been
[1:22:55] attacking the deity because if you can't
[1:22:58] understand the relationship between
[1:23:00] Christ and the father you're never going
[1:23:02] to understand your relationship between
[1:23:04] yourself and the word and that's why
[1:23:06] it's an expression and so so we find out
[1:23:09] that that that you know
[1:23:12] when when you get a trinitarian the
[1:23:14] problem is that when they come they
[1:23:17] because they don't understand expression
[1:23:19] that in their formula they divide God
[1:23:23] into three persons
[1:23:25] now of course you get the argument these
[1:23:27] days and I had one man say it to me one
[1:23:29] time I was trying not to laugh but he
[1:23:31] was a doctor of divinity and he says uh
[1:23:34] the Trinity the Trinity is an uh what
[1:23:37] was the word he used a real fancy Dr
[1:23:39] Divinity word um it's a it's a
[1:23:43] non-negotiable the Trinity is a
[1:23:45] non-negotiable you believe it to go to
[1:23:47] hell and I said William Bram he said
[1:23:50] William bram's in hell today because he
[1:23:52] didn't believe in the Trinity and all
[1:23:54] the the people are in hell today cuz
[1:23:56] they follow him they don't believe in
[1:23:57] the Trinity I said and he said that on
[1:24:00] the air on his radio show and and well
[1:24:04] that was just a little more than I could
[1:24:05] take brother Matt so I called him up on
[1:24:07] his
[1:24:08] show and I
[1:24:11] said that's an interesting thing you
[1:24:13] said about William brandham that's right
[1:24:14] I said I stand by it I said well I'm
[1:24:17] trying to figure out you said that that
[1:24:19] William brandham didn't believe in the
[1:24:21] Trinity he said that's correct and I
[1:24:22] said well who who told you that
[1:24:25] he said well he said I I said you ever
[1:24:27] in his meetings no you ever follow his
[1:24:30] teachings no I said well I have for all
[1:24:31] my life I said I've preached I preached
[1:24:34] this message I started preaching it as a
[1:24:36] teenager I said I've preached it all
[1:24:37] around the world and I said I can tell
[1:24:39] you right now he certainly did believe
[1:24:41] in the Trinity you're completely Mis
[1:24:44] misinformed and boy you told about
[1:24:45] somebody get nervous cuz now he said
[1:24:48] this to millions of people over the air
[1:24:50] and he said well I I I I I well I I I
[1:24:53] was told you know by my asso I said well
[1:24:55] they misinformed you pal I said he
[1:24:58] certainly believed in the Trinity I said
[1:25:00] now and I waited for just a little bit
[1:25:02] of effect you know you like to twist it
[1:25:03] a little bit and so I you might not but
[1:25:07] I
[1:25:09] do and so uh I said now he didn't
[1:25:13] believe in the Catholic version of the
[1:25:15] Trinity but he certainly believed in the
[1:25:17] Bible version of the Trinity he said
[1:25:20] what's the difference I said well the
[1:25:21] Catholic version is three persons in one
[1:25:24] God the Bible version is one God in
[1:25:27] three offices and I said he believed
[1:25:30] that his entire Ministry and brought a
[1:25:32] great revelation of
[1:25:37] it you see the the problem is that they
[1:25:40] that they don't understand the key is
[1:25:43] expression this is what Paul taught us
[1:25:45] is what brother brandham was teaching us
[1:25:47] in Christ as the mystery of God revealed
[1:25:49] and so so we find that that that the
[1:25:53] trinitarian and it's in interesting you
[1:25:54] know and he he says that if you don't
[1:25:57] believe in the Trinity you can't go to
[1:25:59] heaven and I'm like well okay first of
[1:26:01] all I'm not sure if you were sleep in
[1:26:02] history class I know you went to Dallas
[1:26:04] Theological Seminary but the first of
[1:26:08] the first writings of the Trinity wasn't
[1:26:10] actually a trinity because it didn't
[1:26:11] even include the ghost they didn't think
[1:26:13] he was a person at all it was just
[1:26:14] between the Son and the father and it
[1:26:16] took hundreds of years just to get to
[1:26:18] that and then many more hundred of years
[1:26:20] to they said oh we better include the
[1:26:22] the Holy Ghost too he's also now they
[1:26:24] got a third one seem like every time you
[1:26:26] you you come to a new understanding they
[1:26:28] want to add another person to the
[1:26:30] godhead and so we we realize that that
[1:26:34] in that that the the formula of the
[1:26:36] trinitarian is that it chops God into
[1:26:39] three individual persons and that's
[1:26:41] wrong that's that's ancient Babylonian
[1:26:44] polytheism hot proved that and but then
[1:26:48] you say well then the Oneness well the
[1:26:50] problem with the Oneness is they see it
[1:26:51] as Jesus only they they they don't they
[1:26:55] the Oneness don't see his body his bride
[1:26:59] his church as a part of it it's just
[1:27:02] Jesus only but the the real truth is is
[1:27:06] is right down the middle you say oh it's
[1:27:08] two no brother REM says in Paradox as
[1:27:10] soon as you figure out it's two you've
[1:27:11] also missed it it's not two Lords that's
[1:27:15] not correct so what we find because
[1:27:17] they're missing expression also and
[1:27:20] that's gnosticism also because they
[1:27:22] wanted to diminish the deity of the
[1:27:25] Flesh of Jesus Christ by even denying
[1:27:27] that he came in the flesh because look
[1:27:30] if the gnostics could prove that Jesus
[1:27:33] actually what they taught was that he
[1:27:35] was maybe like an angel appearing as a
[1:27:38] human or he was some Supernatural
[1:27:41] Apparition and the reason that they
[1:27:43] wanted to believe that according to
[1:27:44] irenius who let them have it man no
[1:27:47] wonder brother brandham picked irenius
[1:27:49] as the second Church age messenger that
[1:27:51] dude was nasty I mean he called right to
[1:27:54] their face you're the Sons of Satan he
[1:27:57] didn't pull it he punches you're the
[1:27:59] Sons of Satan and and and I mean this is
[1:28:02] exactly why John is writing to all the
[1:28:05] churches we must we whoever will not
[1:28:09] confess that Jesus is coming the flesh
[1:28:11] is Antichrist John's fighting gnosticism
[1:28:15] already in the church the spirit of
[1:28:17] antichrist does already work in the
[1:28:19] churches and the other Apostles are
[1:28:21] writing letters to the churches we need
[1:28:23] to earn earnestly content for the faith
[1:28:25] once delivered I'm glad this message is
[1:28:29] the faith once
[1:28:30] delivered it brings back the presence of
[1:28:33] God it brings back the power of God it
[1:28:35] brings back the body of Christ in the
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:40] earth and so they don't they don't the
[1:28:42] Oneness don't see his body his bride his
[1:28:45] church and this is why brother brandham
[1:28:46] would call us actually part of his
[1:28:48] godhead because they're missing
[1:28:50] expression you know when you let me just
[1:28:52] let me just help you with this before I
[1:28:53] move on I got to watch my time but but
[1:28:57] listen when you when you read in the
[1:29:01] gospels and you're reading passages that
[1:29:04] deal with really really sharply about
[1:29:07] the humanity of Jesus he's standing in
[1:29:11] the water and a voices speaking out of
[1:29:13] the atmospheres out of the heavens it
[1:29:15] says in the King James and brother
[1:29:17] brandham finds that amusing that people
[1:29:19] would try to say oh well see voice was
[1:29:22] speaking from heaven and brother Ram
[1:29:23] said friend there's Heavens between you
[1:29:24] and me it's just atmospheres a voice
[1:29:28] spoke out of the atmosphere didn't mean
[1:29:30] that a voice was speaking somewhere on
[1:29:31] ala centor echoing shouting down to the
[1:29:34] Earth that's silly and and and and so so
[1:29:37] we find out that you you get those kinds
[1:29:39] of times you get times where Jesus is
[1:29:41] weeping where Jesus is saying physician
[1:29:43] heal thyself and he can get sick and he
[1:29:45] can have a headache and you get all of
[1:29:47] these different times where he people
[1:29:49] say oh he's praying and they would ask
[1:29:51] brother Brandon well who's he praying to
[1:29:53] and brother Brandon would say well who
[1:29:54] do you pray to you're praying to the God
[1:29:56] within you yes you have the you have him
[1:29:59] in you yes I thought you said he was in
[1:30:00] heaven uh wait yeah the whole thing
[1:30:05] becomes a log Jam see and the whole
[1:30:07] reason that they get jammed up is
[1:30:09] because they're looking at it in a
[1:30:11] humanistic way and they're ignoring
[1:30:12] expression the whole thing is about
[1:30:14] expression it's about you becoming the
[1:30:17] living Tabernacle of the living God's
[1:30:19] presence that's the hidden Mana the
[1:30:21] hidden Mana is all the way through the
[1:30:23] ceaseless ET ities the Eternal unfolding
[1:30:26] the revelation of Jesus Christ it's
[1:30:28] unfolding in you right now it's going to
[1:30:31] soon bring the sleeping Saints for
[1:30:34] hundreds of years when the when the when
[1:30:36] this church will experience a refilling
[1:30:38] of the Holy
[1:30:40] Ghost the Dynamics of this church will
[1:30:42] be a refilling of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:30:45] Saints for hundreds of years will come
[1:30:47] up out of the ground and we which are
[1:30:49] alive and remain shall be changed in a
[1:30:52] moment
[1:30:54] and so I was I was saying to a group of
[1:30:56] Bible study one time I was teaching a
[1:30:58] Bible study I said listen just remember
[1:31:01] when you're reading the the parts of the
[1:31:05] gospels that that are dealing very
[1:31:07] closely with the humanity side of Christ
[1:31:11] you say well was he God or was he a man
[1:31:16] yeah I mean which one was he
[1:31:19] mhm well God or man
[1:31:22] correct
[1:31:25] see when when brother now you're getting
[1:31:27] it when brother Brenham is describing
[1:31:29] him he Compares him to Solomon he says
[1:31:31] see just like Solomon was the son of
[1:31:33] David but brother brandham goes on to
[1:31:36] say he said now he was not exactly like
[1:31:40] Solomon he says because Solomon was just
[1:31:43] a
[1:31:44] man said but Jesus was a
[1:31:48] man
[1:31:50] plus comma he was the god man
[1:31:54] man told you he's a brand new type of
[1:31:57] human he's a prototype for a coming
[1:31:59] Kingdom of the increase of his kingdom
[1:32:02] there shall be no end see the UN brother
[1:32:06] Braham said how else are you going to
[1:32:08] make the scripture The unsearchable
[1:32:09] Riches of his glory it's in the hidden
[1:32:12] Mana it's in the ages to come see
[1:32:14] brother Ram said they had a an
[1:32:17] application of it in the ages I'm
[1:32:18] getting ahead of myself they had an
[1:32:20] application of it in the ages but it's
[1:32:22] also an eternal application
[1:32:24] the hidden Mana is an eternal
[1:32:25] application so let me finish this point
[1:32:27] before I jump to that so so at times
[1:32:31] you're reading about the humanity side
[1:32:33] of Christ now he's don't think of him as
[1:32:36] 50% man and 50% God that's not correct
[1:32:39] he's a 100% a man and he's 100% God he's
[1:32:44] the God man you get me see so so when
[1:32:49] you're reading passages that deal so
[1:32:52] closely with his Humanity listen church
[1:32:55] that's not to confuse you that's to
[1:32:59] Blind the
[1:33:00] world that's never to confuse his family
[1:33:03] he sent us prophets and apostles to
[1:33:05] establish the doctrine that the Lord is
[1:33:08] one and that and that Christ is a
[1:33:11] further expression he was a he was that
[1:33:13] great Fountain and then he became the
[1:33:16] pillar of fire and then he became MDC
[1:33:18] and then you don't hear no more of MDC
[1:33:20] because he became Jesus Christ he was
[1:33:22] the pillar of Fire that led the children
[1:33:24] of Israel A Cloud by day a fire by night
[1:33:27] he's the same one that appeared in
[1:33:29] Houston Texas in a pillar of fire over a
[1:33:31] prophet's head amen he's the same one
[1:33:34] that opened the seals he's the same one
[1:33:36] that lives in you what is it you're the
[1:33:38] living Tabernacle of the living God's
[1:33:43] presence so when you read when you're
[1:33:46] reading his Humanity just remember that
[1:33:50] didn't come to confuse you that when
[1:33:53] you're reading his Humanity that is for
[1:33:56] you a blueprint or a road map when it
[1:34:00] would be your turn to be the word made
[1:34:05] flesh you get me it's a blueprint it's a
[1:34:09] road map it's a schematic it's it's it's
[1:34:12] plans and specs Builders know what that
[1:34:14] is that's what it is when you're reading
[1:34:16] in the gospels about his Humanity it's
[1:34:18] not to confuse you it's to inform your
[1:34:20] thinking so that you understand how God
[1:34:23] wants a human to act when he's indwell
[1:34:26] by the Holy Ghost it's Hallelujah
[1:34:28] friends you're the continuation of it
[1:34:32] that's what the ministry of the son of
[1:34:33] man came to bring in this world the
[1:34:36] continuation that's why the seals were
[1:34:38] open to bring back the token to bring
[1:34:40] back the abstract to bring back the
[1:34:42] living fullness to bring back a body a a
[1:34:46] body that she is him a final voice to
[1:34:50] the final
[1:34:52] age see there's no way to get there
[1:34:55] without without a prophet first you
[1:34:56] can't get a bleeding word for his
[1:34:58] presence that the scriptures replete
[1:35:01] with examples of that you can't you
[1:35:03] can't even you you you there's no way to
[1:35:05] have
[1:35:06] reconciliation without blood and because
[1:35:09] we're to participate I mean that's
[1:35:12] that's the that's the
[1:35:14] sixfold purpose six purposes of
[1:35:18] Gabriel's visit to Daniel to to bring
[1:35:22] reconciliation amen and and that's part
[1:35:24] of the process and this is exactly why
[1:35:27] that Jesus would say that you're part
[1:35:30] now look how you're part of it whosoever
[1:35:32] sins John 20 whosoever sins you retain
[1:35:36] or remit they are remitted or they are
[1:35:39] retained now we don't have a Catholic
[1:35:41] version of that where we put on a robe
[1:35:43] and get in a confessional Booth frankly
[1:35:45] your pastor doesn't want to hear your
[1:35:48] sins he if you try to tell him your sins
[1:35:50] he'll say go tell it to somebody who can
[1:35:52] do something about it
[1:35:54] I can't forgive it or omit it but there
[1:35:56] is one who can do both Hallelujah Go
[1:35:59] Tell it to Jesus see and so so we find
[1:36:04] that that we we can see we're a part of
[1:36:06] that we can see that we have a a part in
[1:36:09] the Kingdom of Christ we can see that
[1:36:11] we're a final voice to the final Age We
[1:36:14] you can see that we are partaking in the
[1:36:17] you know in and not only remitting sins
[1:36:19] but finding the last seed to find the
[1:36:22] last seed only one can do that as Christ
[1:36:24] but how's he doing it through you
[1:36:26] brother brandham dealt with this in the
[1:36:28] fourth seal when he he actually takes in
[1:36:30] one paragraph and mingles the church the
[1:36:32] Gentile church and Moses and Elijah to
[1:36:35] the Jews and in one paragraph he starts
[1:36:38] talking about you know they can close
[1:36:40] the heavens they can control nature
[1:36:42] whatever they say now it's not clear in
[1:36:44] the fourth seal but in the Sixth Seal he
[1:36:46] D circles back to that and says now
[1:36:49] that's Moses and Elijah but in the
[1:36:51] fourth seal the beginning of that
[1:36:53] paragraph starts about wait till that
[1:36:55] seven Thunder Group arise who can hand
[1:36:58] the word not handle the word but hand
[1:37:01] the word who you are the hand you are
[1:37:03] the expression you are the extension of
[1:37:06] almighty God and he's blending them
[1:37:09] together now that makes perfect sense to
[1:37:11] me because we know that when the bride
[1:37:13] goes up then the the eagle anointing
[1:37:15] lifts up in the atmosphere it flies East
[1:37:18] it picks up Moses and Elijah and it
[1:37:20] takes this same message of Christ the
[1:37:23] deity of Christ and takes it to the
[1:37:25] 144,000 they receive the Holy Ghost they
[1:37:28] receive the message they receive a new
[1:37:30] birth that's why they're in the
[1:37:32] Millennium so it makes sense to me it's
[1:37:34] all part and partial of the same thing
[1:37:37] only God working through Gentiles and
[1:37:39] working through
[1:37:40] [Music]
[1:37:42] Jews I my iPad went off a long time ago
[1:37:45] I don't have any notes showing but I'm
[1:37:46] just this is
[1:37:47] okay so so we find then that this whole
[1:37:52] concept now
[1:37:54] uh when when he's coming back and he's
[1:37:56] he's making you a part of it you're
[1:37:59] literally a part of the end time word
[1:38:01] you're literally a part of the end time
[1:38:02] plan in your life in your daily walking
[1:38:06] talking life this isn't somewhere some
[1:38:09] just some theory in the misty blue this
[1:38:11] is supposed to live behind
[1:38:15] skin see this is the hidden Mana you
[1:38:17] can't there's no way to get a bleeding
[1:38:19] word outside of a Ministry of the son of
[1:38:21] man there's no way to get the hidden
[1:38:23] Mana outside of that because brother
[1:38:25] brandham showed us that if you notice in
[1:38:27] the Bible that the hidden Mana is to the
[1:38:33] angel it's not given to the people it's
[1:38:36] given to the angel and brother brandham
[1:38:39] says it's a little higher understanding
[1:38:42] of him and it's given to the messenger
[1:38:46] who then turns and feeds it to the
[1:38:48] people you understand the revelation of
[1:38:51] the Hidden Mana the thing that's going
[1:38:53] to change your body you can't study and
[1:38:55] go to Bible school and get the hidden
[1:38:58] Mana it only came you say I don't I
[1:39:01] don't believe in a messenger I believe I
[1:39:03] can get Christ good luck with that
[1:39:06] because I'm here to tell you the hidden
[1:39:07] Mana it's hidden it's hidden only Aaron
[1:39:12] could go in there it was in a golden pot
[1:39:15] it only came to one ordained man that's
[1:39:18] why you're in the order of MDC because
[1:39:20] you're behind the veil you're in the
[1:39:24] presence of the shikina you're feasting
[1:39:26] on the hidden mana and whoever won't
[1:39:29] come in with you can't get
[1:39:33] it you
[1:39:35] understand so it's it's what's you're
[1:39:37] eating your way to a body
[1:39:41] change this is why Divine Healing Works
[1:39:43] brother brandham said in the inner Veil
[1:39:45] which I think they later titled to why
[1:39:47] people are so tossed about brother
[1:39:49] Brandon preaches there and he says if
[1:39:52] you're sick who you got who's who's
[1:39:55] who's got a sickness in the body today
[1:39:56] of any kind you got anything the devil's
[1:39:58] bothering you physically on praise the
[1:40:00] Lord mostly healthy church God bless you
[1:40:02] brother brother Matt power of God must
[1:40:04] move here brother brandham says if
[1:40:07] you're sick he said just reach around
[1:40:09] into that golden pot pull you out some
[1:40:12] of that hidden Mana start eating on it
[1:40:15] pull up the word of God by his stripes
[1:40:17] I'm Healed Hallelujah by those wounds oh
[1:40:21] the devil would like to take back those
[1:40:22] wounds it's too late he can't reverse
[1:40:25] time thanks be to God he already
[1:40:28] suffered he already died he already Rose
[1:40:32] he already ascended he already sent back
[1:40:35] his life I got it you got it the devil
[1:40:38] is already it's already too late I tell
[1:40:42] him that all the time sorry it's already
[1:40:44] you're already too
[1:40:47] late if you arrived right now you arrive
[1:40:50] it's already too late I've already been
[1:40:52] sealed in
[1:40:54] hey you can't stop it nothing can
[1:40:58] separate me from the love of God even I
[1:41:00] can't separate
[1:41:02] me in Christ
[1:41:05] Jesus so so we find then that Solomon is
[1:41:09] going to build him this this Tabernacle
[1:41:12] of the living God's Dwelling Place a
[1:41:15] place where God and man can be in
[1:41:17] fellowship and so so quite naturally
[1:41:20] then Satan realizing
[1:41:23] according to the scripture who he
[1:41:25] happens to believe brother brandham said
[1:41:27] he
[1:41:29] believes oh he's a Believer he goes
[1:41:32] church one of the most
[1:41:33] faithful said he believes see said he
[1:41:37] knows what God he knows the will of God
[1:41:40] he just refuses to do
[1:41:42] it he said Satan believes that's direct
[1:41:44] quote he said but he's not born again
[1:41:47] he's not born again he believed say oh
[1:41:49] if you just believe he said the devil
[1:41:50] believes the Apostle says that you
[1:41:52] believe even one God says so does the
[1:41:54] devil you fear and tremble so does the
[1:41:56] devil you do well the devil does the
[1:41:58] same thing see so so you so we find out
[1:42:02] then then that he he realizes that that
[1:42:05] just believing just a a a belief in a
[1:42:08] 2,000 year ago historical event that's
[1:42:12] one thing but do you receive him now I
[1:42:16] had a a man who said to me he' preached
[1:42:18] the message for 10 years walked away and
[1:42:21] he says I all I need is Calvary
[1:42:24] I said really that's
[1:42:26] interesting all you need is Calvary M
[1:42:28] yeah that's it uh what about the
[1:42:31] resurrection oh well yeah yeah I need
[1:42:34] that too yeah and uh the Ascension uh
[1:42:37] yeah okay yeah I need that too yeah okay
[1:42:40] keep coming uh the Holy Ghost well I've
[1:42:43] got it when I believe so does a
[1:42:45] devil I said okay
[1:42:48] stop I said go with me just let I'm I'm
[1:42:53] going to tell you a story and just go
[1:42:54] with me vicariously just imagine you're
[1:42:56] reading a book and you're reading about
[1:42:58] that day on Calvary and there's John
[1:43:01] there's Mary there's Christ on the cross
[1:43:04] and I said and you're standing there oh
[1:43:06] I like that he said good good you like
[1:43:08] that okay I said and uh you're you're a
[1:43:11] believer in him yeah absolutely you
[1:43:14] believe completely absolutely and I said
[1:43:16] would he be your lord
[1:43:18] absolutely what would would you have
[1:43:21] 100% of faith in him absolutely that
[1:43:23] he's that that he's forgiven your sins
[1:43:26] and you're going to heaven
[1:43:27] absolutely I said all right now that's
[1:43:30] not bad the thief on the cross held that
[1:43:32] and he made it to Paradise I said but
[1:43:35] now let's go on down the road a little
[1:43:36] bit kind of like Apollos did now let's
[1:43:39] imagine that you start going around
[1:43:40] after his resurrection Ascension he
[1:43:42] sends his Spirit back into the church
[1:43:44] you hear about the upper room and you go
[1:43:46] around Peter and John and James you hear
[1:43:48] them start preaching and you sit in the
[1:43:50] audience like a Critic and go nah mm-
[1:43:53] nah you know I just need Jesus I don't
[1:43:56] need Peter oh you're a good guy I don't
[1:43:58] need your Doctrine John thank you you're
[1:44:00] sweet and loving but I I I was I was I I
[1:44:03] just want Jesus I said do you I said at
[1:44:07] the day of judgment do you think Jesus
[1:44:09] is going to let you into his kingdom
[1:44:11] because you said I just believe Jesus
[1:44:13] but you rejected his
[1:44:15] Apostles you think you could believe
[1:44:17] Jesus and re do you think you would
[1:44:18] really believe him and then reject his
[1:44:20] Apostles first of all you wouldn't the
[1:44:23] the fact that you received his Apostles
[1:44:24] and Prophets proved you were a
[1:44:27] Believer amen there are lots of people
[1:44:30] who believed him when he was having
[1:44:31] running a social services program but as
[1:44:33] soon as he started calling their their
[1:44:35] kind old priest a devil then they didn't
[1:44:38] walk with him anymore I'm going tell you
[1:44:40] something friends my faith far exceeds
[1:44:42] my understanding I know whom I have
[1:44:45] believed I know whom I have believed I
[1:44:48] know what he's done in my
[1:44:52] life so it's Satan's job then to
[1:44:55] interrupt the process of you becoming
[1:44:57] the Tabernacle of the living God's
[1:44:59] presence and how does he do that he
[1:45:01] comes into our lives and he he
[1:45:04] contaminates man I sure need one quote
[1:45:07] if I could get to it uh no that's not
[1:45:13] it here's oh here it is the very one all
[1:45:16] right what is the Holy Ghost you like
[1:45:19] it now we know that when a body is
[1:45:23] healed that makes us all happy because
[1:45:26] we know that it definitely shows that
[1:45:28] our God heals the sick glad for that but
[1:45:31] that sick person if they live long
[1:45:34] enough will perhaps be sick again maybe
[1:45:36] with the same disease they were healed
[1:45:38] of and that doesn't take away
[1:45:41] healing so you could be healed today get
[1:45:44] sick of it again next week or next year
[1:45:47] and would that mean that God is a liar
[1:45:49] no it just means you're in a body that's
[1:45:51] of Flesh that's dying
[1:45:54] see the doctor will give you medicine
[1:45:56] for pneumonia and maybe two days later
[1:45:59] you'll die with pneumonia after he's
[1:46:01] pronounced them well it reoccurs again
[1:46:04] watch this but when the soul is healed
[1:46:08] you have then in you eternal
[1:46:11] life now you've passed from Death to
[1:46:15] life you can never come into the
[1:46:17] Judgment see you're you're now you're
[1:46:20] part of the first resurrection according
[1:46:22] to St John
[1:46:23] 524 so but now watch what brother
[1:46:26] brandham goes on to say and I believe
[1:46:29] that we are so close to the coming of
[1:46:31] the Lord Jesus that it behooves us to do
[1:46:35] all that we can possibly do to bring
[1:46:38] every soul to the kingdom and I love
[1:46:42] this one brother Matt and to bring the
[1:46:44] kingdom to the
[1:46:46] people but watch what he says that we
[1:46:49] might be healed of our spirits I believe
[1:46:53] that the body of Jesus is the sickest
[1:46:57] body that I know of that is the body
[1:47:00] spiritual body of Christ on Earth is
[1:47:03] very sick now he's just admitted that
[1:47:07] it's a born again person that they've
[1:47:09] been born again in the soul but they're
[1:47:12] still very sick and that sickness is in
[1:47:15] their spirit because you're a triun in
[1:47:17] being the sickness might be in your body
[1:47:20] the sickness might be in your spirit the
[1:47:22] sickness might be in your soul when
[1:47:24] you're born again your soul is healed
[1:47:27] eternally the new birth is healing of
[1:47:30] the Soul amen and because it's life
[1:47:33] healing is life and that's why brother
[1:47:35] Ram said it's just God giving you a
[1:47:36] little part of the resurrection and it
[1:47:38] heals your body it affects you the body
[1:47:40] and generates new cells and Bones get
[1:47:42] healed and Cancers vanish we just had a
[1:47:44] sister in our church had a had a very uh
[1:47:47] concerning very large um tumor on her
[1:47:50] breast and she come up for prayer and I
[1:47:53] knew the devil was just trying to fill
[1:47:54] her full of fear and so I I prayed two
[1:47:57] ways out loud I prayed first of all that
[1:48:00] that the Holy Spirit would condemn the
[1:48:02] enemy that I was praying against him and
[1:48:04] the second thing I prayed is that her
[1:48:06] faith would be strong to not fear or
[1:48:08] doubt she went to the doctor to get a
[1:48:11] biopsy when they went to give the biopsy
[1:48:14] right in front of the doctors right in
[1:48:15] front of their images right in front of
[1:48:17] their screens it
[1:48:18] vanished and they couldn't find a trace
[1:48:21] of it and they were
[1:48:24] astonished the doctors were amazed it's
[1:48:27] gone we don't even see a a casing we
[1:48:30] don't see anything it's just
[1:48:33] gone God still moves God still
[1:48:38] heals and so so we realize then that
[1:48:41] sometimes the devil puts things in our
[1:48:43] lives and I I heard a good friend of
[1:48:45] mine who is a fisherman of course we're
[1:48:47] all fishermen of men he's a minister but
[1:48:49] you know you know brother Bram talked
[1:48:51] about John talked about snakes and
[1:48:53] scorpions and serpent because that's
[1:48:54] what he saw in the wilderness David
[1:48:55] talked about Still Still Water and
[1:48:58] things like this cuz he saw that in in
[1:48:59] the wilderness and so this buddy of mine
[1:49:01] he he's he's a big time fisherman
[1:49:04] although he says he don't hardly get to
[1:49:05] do it anymore I'm not sure I believe him
[1:49:07] but but he he was talking about you know
[1:49:09] there's nothing worse going fishing and
[1:49:11] get a hook in you man it's painful and
[1:49:15] you somebody just wants to pull it out
[1:49:16] you got to go wait oh wait hold on this
[1:49:18] got to there's a certain way that's got
[1:49:20] to come out you understand fish hooks
[1:49:22] science it it goes in easy it doesn't
[1:49:25] come out easy and so we find then a lot
[1:49:28] of times that what does the devil do you
[1:49:31] know he he begins
[1:49:34] to watch us brother brandom says he can
[1:49:36] see a child when it's born he can I
[1:49:38] don't know fully know how brother
[1:49:40] Brandon was ambiguous a little bit we
[1:49:41] can't go beyond what he taught us but
[1:49:43] somehow the devil knows you know the
[1:49:45] Bible says he's wiser than Daniel and he
[1:49:48] can see gifts and he's a he knows who to
[1:49:50] be afraid of and he starts watching and
[1:49:52] he says a lot of times brother brandham
[1:49:53] says see he was trying to kill that that
[1:49:55] child prematurely cuz down the road
[1:49:58] God's got to work for it the devil knows
[1:49:59] it and see so he know he knew someday
[1:50:02] you'd be a believer he knew he he knew
[1:50:04] that he wanted to try to keep you in a
[1:50:06] barroom or keep you wherever your
[1:50:08] denomination was a barroom or a church
[1:50:10] or wherever your denomination was it was
[1:50:12] all just organized the Satan was still
[1:50:15] the god of it you understand and so he
[1:50:18] spends his whole life trying to keep you
[1:50:21] away from the living presence of God and
[1:50:24] and he en he kind of writes you know he
[1:50:27] ensures that even if you do get there
[1:50:29] and he loses control of you into the
[1:50:32] Holy Ghost he'll still keep hooks in
[1:50:34] your
[1:50:35] spirit and people deal with that kind of
[1:50:38] stuff they deal with besetting sins they
[1:50:40] can't get over they deal with things in
[1:50:43] their psychology they I'm not a
[1:50:44] psychology preacher I believe in the
[1:50:46] power of God but I but brother brandham
[1:50:48] taught on these things and this is just
[1:50:50] one quote of many hundreds where he
[1:50:52] talks talks about he says you know the
[1:50:54] your soul is one thing your body is one
[1:50:56] thing but now we need healed of our
[1:50:57] Spirits because the church is
[1:51:00] sick what is he trying to do he's trying
[1:51:03] to make you an ineffective Temple he's
[1:51:06] trying to make you an ineffective
[1:51:08] Tabernacle that happen it happens in
[1:51:09] marriages it happens in homes it's okay
[1:51:12] brother Matt it happens in home I'm a
[1:51:14] pastor this is what I do it happens in
[1:51:16] homes it happens in
[1:51:18] marriages men get raised under a certain
[1:51:21] ideology from their parents parents or
[1:51:23] or maybe Society puts a certain kind of
[1:51:26] thinking on a man puts a certain kind of
[1:51:28] society puts a certain kind of thinking
[1:51:31] down the life you can't if i wife I'm a
[1:51:33] Believer and you really are but I really
[1:51:35] am and you really are but I've had an
[1:51:37] experience you really have but I got the
[1:51:39] Holy Ghost I I love the Lord and you
[1:51:40] really do then then why can't I beat
[1:51:43] this thing why can't I get over it why
[1:51:44] do I have this problem why do I deal
[1:51:46] with anger why do I deal with
[1:51:47] unforgiveness why do I deal with lust
[1:51:49] why do I deal I don't know what your
[1:51:51] problem is today but I know the the one
[1:51:53] who can fix it is
[1:51:55] here
[1:51:59] hallelujah sometimes friends just want
[1:52:02] to say just get personal with you just
[1:52:04] for a
[1:52:05] moment sometimes you know when when the
[1:52:08] I I find when I'm dealing with with
[1:52:11] marriages and I can see that they both
[1:52:13] love the Lord that's not in question the
[1:52:15] problem's not in their soul the
[1:52:17] problem's not in their body problems in
[1:52:19] their Spirit there's something there I
[1:52:21] can I find sometimes that that teenagers
[1:52:24] have problems and you know who put the
[1:52:26] hooks in them their parents who had
[1:52:28] hooks in them who got put in it by
[1:52:30] people with hooks in
[1:52:32] them you have friends that put hooks in
[1:52:35] us as you're growing up afflicted by the
[1:52:37] influence of brother brandom said
[1:52:38] afflicted by the influence of wrong
[1:52:41] people who had wrong motives who did
[1:52:44] wrong things things that trapped Us in
[1:52:47] Wicked vices and they keep manifesting
[1:52:49] themselves as besetting sins that's why
[1:52:51] Paul said lay aside those things See You
[1:52:54] Can't Be an Effective Temple You Can't
[1:52:56] Be an Effective uh Champion for the Lord
[1:52:59] You Can't Be an Effective Soldier he's
[1:53:01] not just here to heal your soul and your
[1:53:03] body he wants to release your mind to
[1:53:06] believe every
[1:53:08] [Applause]
[1:53:13] word sometimes hooks get in and I and
[1:53:17] I'm just I'm just going to be careful
[1:53:18] here I know I'm in in another man's pull
[1:53:21] pit and and I don't say this with any
[1:53:22] regard to anything here I don't know
[1:53:24] anything about anything here I just want
[1:53:27] to say what the Lord put on my heart
[1:53:29] sometimes people get hooks in their
[1:53:31] Spirit from former
[1:53:35] pastors who had hooks in them who got
[1:53:38] them put in there by their former their
[1:53:40] former and their former and you see
[1:53:43] Satan is just constantly putting hooks
[1:53:44] in us and that way if he loses control
[1:53:47] of your soul he he still has that hook
[1:53:50] and he's trying to trying to keep you
[1:53:52] you from being the kind of a temple that
[1:53:55] God needs you to
[1:53:57] be people sometimes who assaulted us or
[1:54:02] evily mistreated us and they had hooks
[1:54:05] in them also you know sometimes assaults
[1:54:08] and offenses that were committed against
[1:54:11] our minds or against our bodies and now
[1:54:14] we are assaulted and and the offenses
[1:54:17] and the hooks have trapped Us in
[1:54:21] unforgiveness
[1:54:23] and you wonder why can't I get this
[1:54:24] thing out of my life you never will with
[1:54:27] that
[1:54:28] unforgiveness cuz that's a hook Satan
[1:54:32] has sunk a triple hook deep into your
[1:54:35] spirit and listen there's only two
[1:54:37] unpardonable sins I know you think
[1:54:40] there's one there's two the one is to
[1:54:42] blaspheme the Holy Ghost there's no
[1:54:44] coming back from that but the other one
[1:54:47] is the refusal to
[1:54:50] forgive Jesus said you're hly father
[1:54:53] will not forgive you of your trespasses
[1:54:56] if you don't forgive others of
[1:55:01] theirs sometimes we get these Hooks and
[1:55:04] we we live in unforgiveness we live in
[1:55:07] besetting sins we live in weaknesses we
[1:55:09] don't
[1:55:11] understand sometimes that we get hooks
[1:55:13] put in our spirit you know and and then
[1:55:16] sometimes if we're not
[1:55:18] careful we put hooks in other people who
[1:55:20] we love
[1:55:24] you're getting quiet that's
[1:55:27] fine it's a serious matter
