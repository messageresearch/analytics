he's my God he's my father he's my well my way he's my truth hallelujah you love him tonight like to also turn your focus to Ezekiel chapter 37 this was a time that the kingdom has been depleted through the years of captivity once a blessed and prosperity group and Nation but was walking around in a place of dryness and the first verse it said the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of a valley which is full of Dry Bones full of Bones what a scene as he caused me to pass by them round about behold there were very many in the open Valley Lo they were very dry and he said to me son of man can these bones live and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest am been the same God that could took a few elements of this Earth and sister Sandy and step into a body he's God Amen to Ezekiel it made have been impossible amen but he said God only you knowest you're the Creator God with you that with man it may seem impossible but with you nothing is impossible amen he's looking at a valley full of dry bones no hope no wealth no Prosperity amen no action no life amen no praise no worship no shouting no screaming no Revival and he said Can these bones live again and his response said Lord only you know us you're the great Creator there's no one greater than you you can create a body and step into it you're the resurrected in life Hallelujah my could you imagine a Lazarus was a dried up bone he was laying out there with no hope with no life but Tim he was Dy there was no hope it was impossible situation the skin worms was taken over his body but brother pH amen when the everyone was moaning and everyone's morning rather amen because of the loss of a loved one amen Jesus was on a journey back home amen but sister Joy he was 4 days late but time didn't matter amen El Lazarus could not Escape The Blessing amen God already knew amen before the foundation of the world the condition Lazarus was being in he was wrapped in death clothes he was tightened up with death amen there was no life in his body he was a dry bone but no even Jesus came by and scream out Lazarus come forth regardless of the situation regardless he's been dead for 4 days and his nose is sunken in his eyes are decayed the skin on were having the way with that body but when Jesus came back when Jesus spoke Resurrection when Jesus spoke Life Death could not hold it any longer death sister Debbie death couldn't keep Lazarus and from his Blessing Lazarus come forth and that dry bone with no life in it Only You Only God Only You knowest hallelujah amen brother Morgan I don't think Jesus was worried about how long he's been there I don't think Jesus was worried about how long you've been in that situation I don't think Jesus is interested that the woman at the well had five husbands and the one that was she was living with wasn't her own amen but that this one thing had in mind she had representation this world is not a home amen then she was just a passing through Hallelujah he couldn't escape it brother Bobby he was dead in a tomb but he couldn't escape it a been death clothes wrapped around his body but he couldn't escape it he was dry with no hope but he couldn't escape it brother Hallelujah only thou knowest Lord and again he said unto me prophesy the fourth verse upon these bones and say unto them listen to these words oh you dry bones hear the word of the Lord Faith cometh by hearing hearing he knew the power of hearing the word but Travis it might not move everybody but there is an elected in every age in every season aen that can't escape it the chicken in the barnyard couldn't escape it you trapped in lady because of a fall you came by by a birth of sin shaped in iniquity came to this world speaking lies but it could not hold you forever Hallelujah hear the word of the Lord it can change you you may seem dry you may seem hopeless but I challenge tonight oh you dry bones hear the word of the Lord and the fifth verse says thus sayith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you I will cause life to come into you and you shall live amen sister didn't he didn't care how long they been there he didn't care how dry they've been it didn't matter how long the sun has baked them didn't matter how long they've been in lady oia cuz you remember God he knows all things he's been in our past he's wor he's living in our present hello somebody he's working in our future he's got it all in control and he's telling them as say the Lord I'm going to put life in them I'm going to breathe into them they're going to become a living Soul they're going to come back to life again because they once was a great army they was once shouting the victory they was once overcoming their adversary but of a such a condition that hid the land but he says breath shall enter into them and they shall live be quickened be restored back to life what a message of Hope a message of Deliverance a message of Resurrection amen and the sixth verse says I will lay sen news upon you and I'll bring up flesh upon you I'll cover you with skin and I'm going to put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord I'm going to place sen you upon you I'm going to connect muscles to bones every Bone's going to come back in this rightful position I'm going to put skin upon you I'm going to fill you up with life I'm going to give you the ability to overcome I'm going to give you the ability to become exceeding great Army the seven verse says so I prophesied as I was commanded and I prophesied and there was a noise all right now now we're going somewhere now there's some great noise taking place it's not a quiet place any longer that you can hear a pin drop amen bone begin to come to Bone it sound like a bone yard Revival that Bones have been scattered abroad in an open field dry with no hope but I'm going to restore say the Lord I'm going to bring back my spirit amen in the midst of Chaos in the midst of Darkness of lady oia but in the evening time there shall be light it might have been some Tred up bones but there's been a message of Hope a message of Resurrection a message of life a message of Grace there was some noise and behold shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone there was some noise there was some worship and when I beheld lo the Senus and the flesh Came Upon them and their skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then they said unto me prophesy unto the wind son of man say unto the wind thus sayi the Lord God come for the Four Winds oh breath breathe upon these slame that they may live Hallelujah remember am been the rising of the sun brother Brown says amen it didn't come to quick and sister Lord didn't come to quick in all life didn't come to quick in all rocks it didn't come quick in all dirt but sister Eve it came to Quicken that portion of Earth Earth or dirt amen that is in housing amen something that the world didn't give and the world can never take it away for God plac it there amen it came from God Amen and it's impossible for it not to return that's the return Ministry that I believe tonight that brother being that we're going back where we came from this world is definitely not a home Hallelujah and they shall live and he commanded me and breath came into them and they lived and they stood upon their feet Hallelujah there's life into them now there's been a great Revival now they're standing upon their feet and as an exceeding great army they couldn't escape the blessing then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say oh bones are dried and our hope is lost and we cut off from our parts therefore prophesy and sayto them thus say the Lord God behold oh my people I will open up your Graves Hallelujah I'll open up your Graves oh you people I brought you up out of your Graves he not only said I'm

you remember the story brother Brown said that he droke into a dream Heen he was dreaming that he told his boss told him go top of the mountain top of the hill cut down a tree breaking down the camp
