[45:59] atmosphere like that it was an
[46:01] atmosphere created by a body of
[46:03] Believers amen and I believe that God is
[46:06] that kind of a God I believe if you'll
[46:08] make room for God God will do things
[46:10] that you never uh thought or even
[46:12] imagined could happen he he's a kind of
[46:14] God that can fix families and take
[46:16] broken homes and put them back together
[46:18] and he can change our minds you can come
[46:20] in one way and leave out a whole
[46:21] different way brother Mark that's why I
[46:23] preach I like to see God do that I like
[46:26] to see him change situations and he can
[46:29] take a person that ain't have no food on
[46:31] the table and he can put food on the
[46:32] table and he can make your cup run over
[46:35] amen that's the kind of God that he is
[46:37] you can come in sick and you can leave
[46:39] well and you can come in you can come in
[46:42] sad and you can leave happy and that's
[46:44] the kind of God that we serve amen do

[47:24] one verse of scripture and take just

[47:40] first chapter and just give you a moment
[47:42] to get there and when you get there just
[47:45] say Amen let everybody get caught up
[47:51] and Isaiah 53 And1 and the Bible says
[47:55] who hath believed received our report
[47:58] how many say
[47:59] Amen to whom is the arm of the Lord
[48:05] revealed whom hath re believed our
[48:08] report and to whom is the arm of the
[48:11] Lord revealed and we just ask the Lord
[48:12] to add His blessings to the reading of
[48:14] the word and you can be seated this
[48:16] morning I want to speak on a subject of
[48:19] Believing by Revelation Believing by
[48:23] Revelation I know this is uh how set up
[48:26] half night last night I had trouble uh
[48:28] sleeping and resting and got to looking
[48:31] at the you know the the reports going on
[48:34] around the world and the war that's
[48:36] going on in Israel and all just seems
[48:39] like other nations getting involved and
[48:42] and saying well for now it's this but it
[48:44] ain't no telling what it'll be like
[48:45] tomorrow whenever you get up and I
[48:47] thought you know just the the confusion
[48:49] that there is among the people brother
[48:51] Mark but all that tells us as a body of
[48:53] Believers is every day we're one day
[48:55] closer amen I believe one of these
[48:57] mornings it'll be the last morning that
[48:59] we'll have to uh face this life and the
[49:02] labor and all the effort that we that we
[49:04] put in it'll all be it'll all be left
[49:06] behind and there'll be a great reward
[49:08] that follows it amen how many believe
[49:10] that this morning I still believe it I
[49:12] believe that one day that uh that we're
[49:14] living in the age of the Rapture I
[49:15] believe that this is the time that the
[49:17] church would depart and and I believe
[49:19] that we were called for that purpose to
[49:21] be a part of it and I don't know about
[49:22] you but I don't plan on missing it I
[49:24] believe that God called me and he opened
[49:26] it to me and open it to my heart and how
[49:28] many believes that say amen amen we
[49:30] we're waiting on that day amen so we we
[49:33] come to the house of God and we we look
[49:35] for the Lord and look for the hand of
[49:37] God and everything that we do and and
[49:39] you know I thought it's just something
[49:40] odd when you get to reading about all
[49:42] the things going on in this world and
[49:44] brother Mark the world is looking for
[49:45] leadership they're looking to be led and
[49:48] uh political leaders are looking to
[49:50] bring in new leaders and maybe this one
[49:52] will come and they'll fix everything and
[49:54] and once they get in office and that'll
[49:55] fix all the problems in the country and
[49:57] that'll solve the economies and that'll
[49:59] solve the interest rates and that'll
[50:01] change the gas prices and that'll make
[50:03] life easier at home and and I thought
[50:05] you know the the world ain't the only
[50:06] thing that needs good leaders but the
[50:08] church needs good leaders too and they
[50:10] need good pastors and good ministers and
[50:13] evangelists and God called men that'll
[50:15] lead by example and and you know that
[50:17] ain't all of it but families need good
[50:18] leaders too they need good good Fathers
[50:20] and good Mothers that'll uh that'll be
[50:23] Christian men and women that'll serve
[50:24] the Lord and be be able to lead their
[50:26] homes and you know when I thought about
[50:28] that leadership I found out that the
[50:30] only way to have a good leadership is to
[50:33] have the leadership of God and brother
[50:34] Jared I believe this I believe that a
[50:36] father and a mother that is Led of God
[50:38] will lead a successful home I believe a
[50:41] pastor that is Led of God or a church
[50:43] that is Led of God will have a
[50:44] successful church and I believe if you
[50:46] ever had a nation that had had a
[50:48] president that was led of God that you
[50:50] would have a successful Nation the key
[50:52] is is that we must have the leadership
[50:54] of God how many believe that that's what
[50:56] Jesus said he said follow me I could
[50:59] preach a whole message this morning on
[51:00] them words just follow me he said see
[51:03] God he he came as our leader he said get
[51:05] rid of everything you got and follow me
[51:07] that's the only way butram said it's the
[51:09] only way to have eternal life that was a
[51:11] decision that God made and he'll never
[51:13] change it he said we must follow him you
[51:15] say well brother Matt what is the
[51:16] leadership of God today he said the
[51:19] leadership of God is to follow the
[51:21] Vindicated word of the hour by the Holy
[51:23] Ghost so this is what God is calling us
[51:26] to do today and I know we look through
[51:27] the scripture and we look for example
[51:29] and we look for leading and we look for
[51:31] Direction but the prophet of God said
[51:33] here's why so many missed the direction
[51:34] of God is because the leadership of God
[51:37] is to follow the Vindicated word of God
[51:39] so you know what that tells me brother
[51:41] Jared that when God sends a word that
[51:43] word is going to lead his children that
[51:45] God will vindicate that word and the
[51:47] reason he vindicates it is to counter
[51:49] any doubt or criticism that Satan is
[51:51] going to bring against it so God would
[51:53] send a word and if God's going to send a
[51:55] word to lead you brother the co you
[51:56] don't have to wander around and wonder
[51:58] if it was the word of God because God
[52:00] vindicates it in a way that you know it
[52:02] was God then it becomes to the believer
[52:04] something that is unquestionable it
[52:05] becomes a foundation of their faith it
[52:08] becomes something that they can build on
[52:09] and establish their their life on and
[52:11] they they don't they don't have to W
[52:13] wander around and question and and try
[52:15] to figure out which way to go but I
[52:17] believe this hour that we have the
[52:19] leadership of almighty God I believe in
[52:21] this hour that we have a word that God
[52:23] has sent to us that was Vindicated by
[52:26] God brother Marsh so therefore all we
[52:27] have to do is just believe it we saw the
[52:29] Vindication of it we believe it and we
[52:31] follow the word of God and I believe
[52:33] what the Bible says the Bible says that
[52:34] God has a message in every age how many
[52:36] believes that say Amen it's always been
[52:39] that way and what God does is he anoints
[52:41] men as prophets and pastors and teachers
[52:43] and evangelists according to Apostle
[52:45] Paul and and he brings the word of God
[52:48] to the people and let me tell you what
[52:49] God does he don't just speak a word and
[52:51] leave it there for a hundred years but I
[52:53] believe that God brings a word that is
[52:55] relevant to today it ain't just some
[52:57] it's not an old message it ain't a
[52:59] message for some other day but in every
[53:01] day that there ever has been a day God
[53:03] has has a me had has a message for the
[53:05] day that we're living in I believe that
[53:07] God has a message today I believe he has
[53:09] something to say to his people I believe
[53:11] he has a purpose for you I believe he
[53:13] has a goal for the church I believe that
[53:15] God has a direction for the Church of
[53:16] the Living God I believe that God has a
[53:18] leading for the church today so we don't
[53:20] have to wander we don't we don't have to
[53:23] uh uh to be wishy-washy but I believe we
[53:25] got something that we can stand on today
[53:27] to be able to see us through in the hour
[53:29] that we live in it's God's word today
[53:32] and brother B said but God's word today
[53:34] if it's going to come and God's going to
[53:35] bring a word for every age well the word
[53:38] that he would bring to this age he said
[53:40] it would be brought to us in Revelation
[53:43] from the hand of God by Vindication so
[53:46] that means whatever it is that you have
[53:47] need of this morning brother Mark that
[53:49] it'll be brought to you by Revelation
[53:51] how many believes that so that means if
[53:52] you need healing healing is brought by
[53:54] Revelation if you need salvation it'll
[53:57] only come to you by Revelation if you
[53:59] need if you want to go in the Rapture
[54:00] the it it'll only come to you by
[54:02] Revelation see it's brought by
[54:03] Revelation see this word revelation
[54:06] brother brother uh Jared it comes from a
[54:08] Greek word which is apocalypsis and what
[54:10] that word means it means to the removal
[54:13] of a veil or the uncovering of something
[54:15] that once was covered so if God is going
[54:17] to come by Revelation in this hour that
[54:20] means he's going to take something that
[54:21] was veiled and he would unveil it or
[54:23] maybe something and let me tell you
[54:24] something about Revelation it could be
[54:26] something that you've looked at your
[54:28] entire life and then one day the the the
[54:30] page is turned or the veil is removed
[54:33] and now you look at the same thing and
[54:34] brother Cody it looks different it it
[54:37] has a different meaning it has a it has
[54:39] a connection that it's never had see
[54:41] that's a revelation so so if it can be
[54:43] uncovered that means there was a time it
[54:45] was covered if it could be unveiled
[54:47] there was a time it was veiled that's
[54:48] why Jesus would say this he said I thank
[54:51] thee father for you have hid these
[54:53] things from the eyes of the wise and
[54:54] prudent but you have Reve fild them unto
[54:57] babes that would receive I believe
[54:59] that's what God does I believe that
[55:01] Through the Ages and Through the Bible
[55:03] there's been so many things brother Mark
[55:05] that were hidden and there's so many
[55:06] things that were buried up and you know
[55:08] what God does is at the right time at
[55:10] the time at the time when it's needed I
[55:13] I think God is just a super god that
[55:15] he's the kind of God that he can lay a
[55:17] seed but the mark for thousands of years
[55:19] and 2,000 years or or 3,000 years that
[55:22] God could lay a seed and allow it to
[55:24] remain dormant but at the time the very
[55:26] time that it's needed that God can take
[55:29] that seed and he can he can put it in
[55:31] the ground and he can bring it to pass
[55:32] and he can bring it to life what is it
[55:34] it's the unveiling becoming veiled it's
[55:37] the UN or the covered becoming uncovered
[55:39] and I believe that God will reveal
[55:41] everything that we have need of I I
[55:43] don't believe there's one Revelation
[55:44] that God don't want you to have if if
[55:46] it's time of the Rapture God will give
[55:48] you a revelation of it if it's time for
[55:50] you a body change God will give you a
[55:51] revelation of it he won't leave you
[55:53] wandering in the wilderness but he will
[55:55] reveal it to you you that you could have
[55:57] everything that you have need of in this
[55:59] hour I believe that's what kind of God
[56:01] that we serve but said the importance of
[56:03] Revelation by the spirit to a True
[56:05] Believer can never be overemphasized he
[56:08] said Revelation means more to you than
[56:10] perhaps you realize and I'm not talking
[56:12] about the Book of Revelation but I'm
[56:14] talking about all Revelation it is
[56:16] tremendously important to the church I'm
[56:19] trying to I'm trying to establish
[56:20] something here this morning but
[56:22] Revelation is important to you
[56:24] Revelation matters to you it is
[56:26] tremendously important to the church you
[56:28] realize you say well why is it so
[56:29] important it's because Revelation is
[56:31] what the church is built on you remember
[56:33] whenever whenever Jesus spoke to Peter
[56:35] and he came and he said Peter who does
[56:37] men say that I am he said some says
[56:39] you're Elijah some says you're one of
[56:41] the prophets some you know a great man
[56:43] of God he said but Peter who do you say
[56:45] that I am he said I say you're the
[56:47] Christ you're the son of the Living God
[56:49] Jesus said Peter flesh and blood has not
[56:51] revealed this unto you but my Father in
[56:54] Heaven hath revealed this unto you he
[56:57] said and and and Upon This Rock I will
[56:59] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[57:02] shall not Prevail against it I thought
[57:03] isn't it something he said that see
[57:05] Peter had a revelation that the rest of
[57:07] the world didn't have and Jesus said but
[57:09] Upon This Rock I'll build my church I
[57:11] know what the world has done is they
[57:13] took that and they put a question mark
[57:15] by it that's what they do that's what
[57:16] the devil always does with the word of
[57:18] God when God would speak something he'll
[57:20] put a question mark but I thank God that
[57:22] we have a prophet in this age that can
[57:23] come and take the question mark off of
[57:25] the Bible You' be able to see it and
[57:27] have the answer we're not a people that
[57:29] is wondering and question brother Mar
[57:31] but we're a people with the answer today
[57:33] he said see what the the the church
[57:35] world is asking upon what rock is the
[57:37] church built on but you know many would
[57:39] say well it was built on Peter and they
[57:41] established a church on Peter and how
[57:43] that he started the Roman Catholic
[57:45] church and how all this came from him
[57:46] him being the first piece or priest but
[57:49] but you realize that it couldn't have
[57:50] been built on Peter I love how brother
[57:52] Ram said it he said because he said it
[57:53] couldn't been built on the man because
[57:55] later the backslid see God would never
[57:58] build his church on a man cuz the man's
[58:00] always going to fail the man's always
[58:02] going to fall he'll make mistakes he'll
[58:04] so so God couldn't he couldn't rely upon
[58:06] a man to build his church on well then
[58:08] the other group they took it and said
[58:10] well it was the confession that he made
[58:12] because it was the confession that
[58:13] Christ was the son of God but AB even
[58:15] took that he said you know he said that
[58:17] wasn't even it because anybody can
[58:20] confess Jesus was the son of God they
[58:22] could have heard Peter say it and they
[58:23] could go out and say well Peter said he
[58:25] was the son of God so by that confession
[58:27] I say he's the son of God therefore
[58:29] that's what the church is built on he
[58:30] said but no that wasn't it he said but
[58:32] what it was it was Peter's confession of
[58:35] the revelation of Jes of who Jesus
[58:38] Christ was that's the church so see it
[58:41] wasn't just a confession but it was a
[58:43] confession of a revelation are you with
[58:45] me you know you know the church world
[58:47] says well it's just based on her
[58:49] confession if you'll just repeat after
[58:50] me if you'll just say Jesus Jesus Jesus
[58:53] well then you're going to be saved after
[58:55] all Romans the chapter Paul said if Thou
[58:57] shalt confess the Lord Jesus then Thou
[58:59] shalt be saved but friends I've got news
[59:01] for you this morning you can say Jesus
[59:04] all you want to and it'll never save you
[59:06] you could say Jesus you could you could
[59:08] get up every morning and you could spend
[59:09] 24 hours a day and you could speak the
[59:11] name of Jesus although I do believe that
[59:14] if you speak out of sincerity the name
[59:16] of Jesus it'll bring him near but it but
[59:18] never has just saying the name of Jesus
[59:20] or confessing that name out of your
[59:22] mouth CA salvation to come but listen
[59:24] what Paul said he said you should he
[59:26] said but if you'll confess with your
[59:27] mouth the Lord Jesus and you'd believe
[59:30] in your heart that God has raised him
[59:32] from the dead then thou shall be saved
[59:34] for with the heart a man believeth under
[59:36] righteousness and with the mouth
[59:37] confession is made unto salvation in the
[59:40] Amplified Bible can I read out of this
[59:42] he says but what does it say the word
[59:44] which was God's message God's message is
[59:47] near you and on your lips and in your
[59:49] heart that is the word the message of
[59:52] God the message of Faith which we preach
[59:55] and if you a a knowledge and confess
[59:57] with your lips that Jesus is Lord and in
[59:59] your heart you believe or you trust or
[1:00:01] you rely on that truth that God has
[1:00:03] raised him from the dead then you'll be
[1:00:05] saved for with a heart a person believes
[1:00:07] and and and is Justified he's declared
[1:00:10] righteous and with the mouth he
[1:00:11] confesses and he declares openly and he
[1:00:14] speaks freely of his faith and confirms
[1:00:16] his own salvation I thought isn't it
[1:00:18] isn't that something good but but the
[1:00:20] but but when you read this word confess
[1:00:22] brother Mah it's more than just saying a
[1:00:24] word this is what the church world has
[1:00:25] done they've took that word and said you
[1:00:27] just confess Jesus and you're going to
[1:00:28] be saved but but there there even
[1:00:30] there's a deeper meaning see this word
[1:00:32] confess it's not the same word confess
[1:00:35] that you read throughout the scripture
[1:00:36] there's many other times that in our
[1:00:38] English Bible we read confess but it has
[1:00:40] a little bit different meaning but this
[1:00:42] word confess it has even a deeper
[1:00:44] meaning it comes from the Greek word
[1:00:46] homio and when you read this word homio
[1:00:49] it means to agree on something but the
[1:00:51] but the the the main meaning is to speak
[1:00:54] the same thing as so listen what Paul
[1:00:56] said if Thou shalt confess the Lord
[1:00:59] Jesus in other words if Thou shalt speak
[1:01:01] the same thing as you hearing me so here
[1:01:04] Jesus would bring a message and Jesus
[1:01:06] would speak a word and Jesus would bring
[1:01:08] something to the believer and Paul said
[1:01:10] if Thou shalt confess the Lord Jesus it
[1:01:12] don't just mean to speak it it don't
[1:01:14] just mean to agree it but that you would
[1:01:15] speak the same thing so your confession
[1:01:18] is speaking the very thing that Jesus
[1:01:20] were that he was and all that he was and
[1:01:22] all that he would he would speak and you
[1:01:24] you realize that this is scripture when
[1:01:26] you go through the Bible you'll find
[1:01:27] this to be the case that the Bible tells
[1:01:29] us there is coming a time in the end
[1:01:31] time that the bride's message would be
[1:01:34] perfectly lined up with the spirit of
[1:01:35] God how many knows that to be true
[1:01:37] Revelations 22:17 it says and the spirit
[1:01:40] and the bride say come see so what it
[1:01:42] shows you is the bride's message and the
[1:01:45] spirit would be the exact same thing so
[1:01:47] it tells us that the calling out in this
[1:01:49] last AG is not the message of a man it's
[1:01:51] not just one man's message it's not and
[1:01:54] it's not just the spirit just speaking
[1:01:56] out in the wilderness somewhere but it's
[1:01:58] the spirit of God through the voice of
[1:02:00] the Bride saying come oh listen friends
[1:02:03] it's the very message of God through the
[1:02:05] voice of the Bride of Jesus Christ but
[1:02:07] said see when the prophet appears in
[1:02:09] this last AG this is the church age book
[1:02:11] he said what he says would be from God
[1:02:13] and the bride will say the same thing
[1:02:15] and the spirit and the prophet and the
[1:02:17] bride will be saying the same and what
[1:02:19] they will say will have already been
[1:02:21] said in his word and they are saying it
[1:02:24] now come out from among her now and be
[1:02:27] you separate see the cry has gone out
[1:02:29] the cry is going out how long will the
[1:02:32] voice cry we don't know but one thing we
[1:02:34] do know is it won't be long because this
[1:02:37] is the last Age Now isn't that something
[1:02:39] that the message of the Bride is the
[1:02:41] same message that the prophet spoke the
[1:02:43] message of the Bride is the same message
[1:02:45] of the spirit brother Mar it agrees with
[1:02:48] what Jesus said so our confession is not
[1:02:50] just something that we're saying out of
[1:02:52] our mouth our confession is not just
[1:02:54] something we're speaking to or were
[1:02:56] quoting something they were memorizing
[1:02:57] some scripture but it's speaking the
[1:02:59] same thing that Jesus spoke so the very
[1:03:01] meaning that he had in it the bride is
[1:03:03] confessing it so when we preach it's the
[1:03:05] confession of a revelation that Jesus
[1:03:07] had it's no wonder the prophet said that
[1:03:10] the very words that's laying in the
[1:03:11] Bible are the thoughts of God In seed
[1:03:13] form and if it was ever received in the
[1:03:15] believer and spoke by the same thought
[1:03:17] that materialized the Bible it would
[1:03:19] bring it to pass because it's a
[1:03:21] confession of a revelation oh friends it
[1:03:24] ain't just saying something but it's
[1:03:25] getting a revelation see you think a man
[1:03:27] hears the word think about this when a
[1:03:29] man Hears A word of God and by
[1:03:32] Revelation he accepts that word to be
[1:03:34] true and by his mouth he confesses the
[1:03:37] that he confesses his own salvation has
[1:03:39] come from the word that was revealed to
[1:03:41] him because his Revelation was the same
[1:03:44] Revelation that Jesus had he confessed
[1:03:47] his Revelation to be true then his
[1:03:50] confession confirms his Revelation isn't
[1:03:53] that wonderful his confession not only
[1:03:55] does it conf confirm the Revelation but
[1:03:56] it confirms that man's salvation because
[1:03:59] he's confessing a revelation that Jesus
[1:04:01] had well let me tell you this friends I
[1:04:03] I believe this this morning that as you
[1:04:05] grow in Revelation then your confession
[1:04:08] becomes greater as you grow in
[1:04:10] Revelation then all the sudden the
[1:04:12] confession I know there's a lot of
[1:04:13] people going out quoting a lot of
[1:04:14] scripture there's a that's where most of
[1:04:16] the most of the uh uh the the church
[1:04:18] world gets in trouble by by convincing
[1:04:20] people that if you'll just quote some
[1:04:22] scripture then everything's going to be
[1:04:23] okay and and and God will come on the
[1:04:25] scen and and and you're going to receive
[1:04:27] healing it's what CA people not to
[1:04:28] believe in Divine Healing is that
[1:04:30] they'll quote the scripture and they'll
[1:04:31] never receive healing or they'll or
[1:04:33] nothing ever happens like like they
[1:04:35] thought it would happen but you realize
[1:04:37] it's more than confession see so so when
[1:04:40] you get a greater Revelation brother
[1:04:41] Mark your confession becomes greater
[1:04:43] when your Revelation gets greater then
[1:04:45] your confession all of a sudden it ain't
[1:04:46] a powerless confession any longer but
[1:04:49] because of the Revelation that you have
[1:04:51] then that confession has power and
[1:04:53] because you're Revelation then the
[1:04:54] confession has an Authority behind it
[1:04:57] and then we're able to overcome by our
[1:04:59] confession because we have a revelation
[1:05:01] to back it up see it ain't just a bunch
[1:05:03] of people saying a bunch of ramblings or
[1:05:05] or babblings or repeating a bunch of
[1:05:07] prayers or or something like that but I
[1:05:09] thank God that we've been sent a
[1:05:10] revelation in this hour and by
[1:05:12] revelation we would have a place to
[1:05:14] stand and with authority we could
[1:05:16] confess over our sickness and confess
[1:05:18] over our failure and confess to the
[1:05:21] devil that would hinder you and the
[1:05:22] devil would have to flee because we're
[1:05:24] confessing the revelation of Jesus
[1:05:27] Christ oh let me tell you friends many
[1:05:29] confess but they never see the fruit of
[1:05:32] their confession how many say Amen to
[1:05:34] that many confess but they never see
[1:05:36] fruit of their confession why is it it's
[1:05:38] because they don't have the right
[1:05:40] Revelation see the fruit of your
[1:05:41] confession will only come by Revelation
[1:05:44] you may have confession but it'll never
[1:05:46] bear fruit without a revelation behind
[1:05:48] it see if a person will get the right
[1:05:50] Revelation and then you'll confess it
[1:05:52] then your confession will release the
[1:05:54] power that lies with within that
[1:05:56] Revelation isn't that good it isn't the
[1:05:58] the power isn't in the confession as
[1:06:00] much as it's in the Revelation and by
[1:06:02] confessing that Revelation it'll bring
[1:06:04] power to your life let me ask you this
[1:06:06] what good would it do to confess
[1:06:08] something that was powerless what good
[1:06:10] would it do if you you can get all kinds
[1:06:11] of Revelations man man can give you all
[1:06:13] kinds of Revelations but but if it has
[1:06:15] no power you can go out confess it it'll
[1:06:17] never do anything but friends I've got
[1:06:18] news for you it's my purpose that every
[1:06:21] believer would have a conf or have a
[1:06:22] revelation that their confession would
[1:06:25] have power by behind it that's my that's
[1:06:27] my purpose is that that we wouldn't just
[1:06:29] be some some getter by Christians that
[1:06:31] barely got by one day to the next and
[1:06:33] can barely can barely get out of bed to
[1:06:35] be a Christian today but I believe that
[1:06:36] the Believers ought to have enough
[1:06:38] Revelation that when they get out they
[1:06:40] can look the devil in the eye and they
[1:06:41] could confess the word of God and put
[1:06:43] the devil in his place it might be a
[1:06:46] great confession but see if you have the
[1:06:47] wrong Revelation the confession don't do
[1:06:49] no good it's a powerless Revelation so
[1:06:52] when we have what we need is we need a
[1:06:53] revelation of something that has power
[1:06:56] behind it so if our confession is
[1:06:58] confessing in Revelation let's have a
[1:06:59] revelation of something that'll have a
[1:07:01] little bit of power some something that
[1:07:03] that will charge us something that will
[1:07:04] move situations something that'll drive
[1:07:06] the devil out of the building we need a
[1:07:08] revelation of something with power
[1:07:10] that's why brother B said he said but
[1:07:12] there's nothing of such prevailing power
[1:07:15] as the revelation of the word of God so
[1:07:17] friends I challenge you this morning
[1:07:19] that if you're going to get a revelation
[1:07:21] get a revelation of God's word if you're
[1:07:23] going to have a revelation don't take
[1:07:24] the revelation of some Seminary or the
[1:07:27] revelation of some denomination
[1:07:28] somewhere but take a revelation that
[1:07:30] come right out of the word of God out of
[1:07:32] the mouth of a prophet of God and let
[1:07:34] that Revelation strike your heart that
[1:07:37] your confession would have power in it
[1:07:40] let me tell you when you start speaking
[1:07:41] then but the mark things begin to change
[1:07:44] but said that's what we need that's the
[1:07:46] same thing with Divine Healing he said
[1:07:47] people try to get all worked up to try
[1:07:49] to make it happen and nothing ever
[1:07:50] happens think about it they'll go
[1:07:52] confessing and saying nothing ever
[1:07:54] happens he said they but they're going
[1:07:55] Plum over the top of it and they leave
[1:07:57] it right behind them he said but what
[1:07:59] you do is you go out there and get
[1:08:00] excited trying to reach for something
[1:08:02] when it's right there by you all along
[1:08:04] just simple say thank you Father you
[1:08:07] promised it to me and now I receive it
[1:08:10] a't that a simple word it ain't no big
[1:08:11] work up he said it's just simple say
[1:08:14] thank you Father you promised it to me I
[1:08:16] now receive it how many can say that
[1:08:17] this morning thank you Father you
[1:08:19] promised it to me I now receive it see
[1:08:22] how easy that is that's a confession
[1:08:24] thank you Father you promised it to me I
[1:08:26] now receive it he said but notice Watch
[1:08:28] What Happens you see whenever you said
[1:08:30] that some of you when you said it think
[1:08:32] maybe you have a situation or something
[1:08:34] going on in your in your family or
[1:08:36] something going on in your life that you
[1:08:37] thought of whenever you said that thank
[1:08:39] you Father you promised it to me I now
[1:08:41] receive it but notice what the devil
[1:08:42] does is because that's been going on so
[1:08:44] long he'll come by and say well you're
[1:08:46] just lying about that and you're you
[1:08:48] know you don't even believe that and
[1:08:49] here you're confessing something you
[1:08:51] don't believe and and you don't have a
[1:08:52] revelation of that so so it ain't never
[1:08:54] going to happen any but you know what
[1:08:56] you do you say thank you Father you
[1:08:58] promised it I now receive it see there
[1:09:00] ain't no sense in getting all worked up
[1:09:01] about it it's just speak something by
[1:09:03] confession but says here's what'll
[1:09:05] happen see the devil makes you think
[1:09:06] you're lying but you realize the one
[1:09:08] that makes you think you're lying he's
[1:09:10] the father of Lies it ain't you that's
[1:09:12] lying it ain't God that's lying it's the
[1:09:14] devil that's lying so it's like that
[1:09:16] little Chloe when she gave her testimony
[1:09:18] she's thanking God for her healing went
[1:09:20] back to the doctor and it was worse than
[1:09:22] it was whenever she got prayed for but
[1:09:24] you know what she done she kept
[1:09:25] confessing or healing and went back to
[1:09:27] the doctor and finally on the next visit
[1:09:29] he said there ain't nothing there anyhow
[1:09:31] I thank God that somebody would have
[1:09:33] enough confession to confess something
[1:09:35] when the symptom gets worse you say
[1:09:37] thank you Father you promised it I now
[1:09:39] believe it the devil says you're lying
[1:09:41] it's worse than it was before thank you
[1:09:43] Father you promised it I now believe it
[1:09:46] let me tell you what'll happen brother B
[1:09:48] said you you may not even believe it he
[1:09:50] said but you just keep saying it until
[1:09:52] you do believe it Hallelujah he said you
[1:09:55] keep saying it until you do believe it
[1:09:58] you keep saying it over I thank you Lord
[1:10:00] for my healing I thank you Lord for my
[1:10:02] salvation I don't care what you're going
[1:10:04] through this morning I thank you Lord
[1:10:06] for deliverance I thank you Lord for
[1:10:08] salvation of my son Lord I Thank you for
[1:10:10] the Salvation of my daughter I thank you
[1:10:13] H for sending the Holy Ghost to where
[1:10:14] she is and minister to her heart Lord I
[1:10:17] Thank you for picking her up when she's
[1:10:18] down I thank you for bringing her to
[1:10:20] church I thank you for sitting her
[1:10:21] beside me I thank you for bringing her
[1:10:23] to an altar the devil tell you your ly
[1:10:25] you keep confessing
[1:10:27] it he said you keep saying it until you
[1:10:30] do believe it he said why because the
[1:10:31] Bible said he's the high priest of our
[1:10:34] confession I believe that he's the high
[1:10:37] priest of our confession he says that
[1:10:39] that's Hebrews the third chapter he
[1:10:41] can't do one thing for you he can't make
[1:10:43] an intercession until first you you
[1:10:45] confess that it's done isn't that
[1:10:46] scriptural he's the high priest of our
[1:10:48] confession and then he can only act when
[1:10:50] we confess see so brother Wesley you're
[1:10:53] going to get a revelation that God God's
[1:10:55] word is true and then confess that
[1:10:58] Revelation see the step that people Miss
[1:11:00] it's all confession but get a revelation
[1:11:02] confess that Revelation and by
[1:11:04] confession you'll bring it to past my
[1:11:07] isn't it something see Revelation brings
[1:11:09] an authority to your confession you
[1:11:11] remember when Jesus when Jesus went down
[1:11:13] that day and he spoke to the Fig Tree
[1:11:16] and whenever he came back the Fig Tree
[1:11:18] was withered and the disciples begin to
[1:11:20] ask him this question brother Travis
[1:11:22] they said well how what kind of
[1:11:24] authority this was you know when you
[1:11:25] came by and you just spoke a word to
[1:11:27] this fig tree now we come back and it's
[1:11:29] all dried up how did this happen and
[1:11:31] notice how Jesus answered them he said
[1:11:33] he said have faith in God for verily I
[1:11:36] say unto you that whosoever shall say un
[1:11:38] this mountain be thou removed and cast
[1:11:41] into the sea and shall not doubt on his
[1:11:43] heart but Shall Believe those things
[1:11:44] which he saith shall come to pass he
[1:11:46] shall have whatever he says therefore I
[1:11:50] say unto you that what things you desire
[1:11:52] When you pray believe that you receive
[1:11:54] them and you shall have them see they
[1:11:56] were asking by what Authority how how
[1:11:59] did this happen and he gives them an
[1:12:00] answer he says whatever whosoever shall
[1:12:02] say to this mountain believe when you
[1:12:04] pray and you shall receive them even the
[1:12:06] Pharisees brother Mark would gather
[1:12:08] around and begin to ask him by what
[1:12:10] Authority does he do these things by
[1:12:12] what Authority does he have this ability
[1:12:14] you know as the testimonies begin to
[1:12:16] grow this was the great question by what
[1:12:18] Authority but you realize that Jesus but
[1:12:21] Jesus gave you as a Believer a
[1:12:23] scriptural authority over the devil how
[1:12:25] many believe that can you say that with
[1:12:27] me that Jesus gave me as a Believer
[1:12:30] scriptural authority over the devil you
[1:12:33] believe that Jesus gave me scriptural
[1:12:35] authority over the devil that's the
[1:12:36] question the devil will ask you when you
[1:12:38] go to confessing something by what
[1:12:40] Authority do you confess this by what
[1:12:42] Authority you're not a preacher after
[1:12:43] all by what Authority you you ain't you
[1:12:45] you ain't a deacon in the church after
[1:12:47] all by what Authority do you have this
[1:12:49] but friends you say because God has gave
[1:12:51] me scriptural authority over the devil I
[1:12:54] believe that he gave you a scriptural
[1:12:56] authority Jesus said when you say to
[1:12:58] this mountain be thou removed and cast
[1:13:01] into the sea and don't doubt in your
[1:13:02] heart and be you believe what you ask
[1:13:04] for it shall come to pass whatever thing
[1:13:07] you desire When you pray believe that
[1:13:09] you receive them take the devil back to
[1:13:10] there when he says you ain't got a right
[1:13:12] to say that brother Tom you say well but
[1:13:15] but the Bible says but but whatever I
[1:13:17] say to this mountain it'll be removed
[1:13:19] and the things I desire in my heart
[1:13:21] it'll be given unto me because I believe
[1:13:23] I'm going to receive it see we have a
[1:13:25] scriptural authority over I know I know
[1:13:27] what I know what happens whenever God
[1:13:28] gives you an authority I know people
[1:13:30] abuse it I know you know people take it
[1:13:32] they use it the wrong way but God didn't
[1:13:34] give you an authority to abuse your
[1:13:36] brother he didn't give you an authority
[1:13:37] to abuse your wife we have a scriptural
[1:13:39] Authority the Bible says that men were
[1:13:41] made in the image of God and have
[1:13:43] dominion over the earth I believe that
[1:13:44] we have authority but but but it wasn't
[1:13:46] to be misused it wasn't to be used
[1:13:48] wrongly and so men take a hold of that
[1:13:50] and they'll take a hold of some
[1:13:51] scriptures and I'm going to get myself
[1:13:53] in trouble but they'll they'll get a
[1:13:54] little bold and they'll say well I I'll
[1:13:56] tell you what I'll put my wife on her
[1:13:57] place and I I'll have authority over her
[1:13:59] cuz they can't get nobody else to do it
[1:14:01] they want they'll try to abuse your
[1:14:03] authority over their wife or you'll take
[1:14:05] pastors and they'll abuse their
[1:14:06] authority over the people of God or over
[1:14:08] the Church of God but let me tell you
[1:14:10] friends but that way that ain't what the
[1:14:12] the authority was given for it was to
[1:14:14] have authority over the
[1:14:16] devil that's what it was for he said
[1:14:18] I'll give you a scriptural authority
[1:14:20] over the devil let me tell you I know
[1:14:22] y'all some of y'all looking at me like
[1:14:23] I'm funny but I me tell you where
[1:14:24] Apostle Paul said there he Apostle Paul
[1:14:26] was a man of great Authority he was an
[1:14:28] apostle of God he was the leader of the
[1:14:30] Gentiles he was a prophet of God and
[1:14:32] that man of great power the Devils
[1:14:34] feared him he was an apostle he was a
[1:14:36] Setter in order and Paul said he said I
[1:14:38] have an abundant he said though I have
[1:14:40] abundant boldness in Christ to charge
[1:14:43] you to do what is fitting and required
[1:14:45] of your duty to do in other words I've
[1:14:46] got an abundant boldness in Christ I can
[1:14:49] tell you what to
[1:14:50] do he said but for the Love's sake I
[1:14:53] prefer to appeal to you
[1:14:56] you is't that good I could boss you
[1:14:59] around he said but for Love's sake I
[1:15:01] prefer to appeal to you the love of God
[1:15:04] as an ambassador of Jesus Christ an old
[1:15:07] man now a prisoner in his sake he notice
[1:15:09] what he was telling us what an example
[1:15:10] that we have in Apostle Paul see we're
[1:15:12] not when God gives you a scriptural
[1:15:14] Authority it ain't to be abused and used
[1:15:16] on one another but when he gives you a
[1:15:18] scriptural Authority it's the boldness
[1:15:20] not to rule each other but to rule over
[1:15:22] the devil you see how people get that so
[1:15:25] mixed up I'm going to get myself in
[1:15:27] trouble but that's what God gave us an
[1:15:29] authority for to rule over the devil and
[1:15:31] let me tell you what brother Mark the
[1:15:33] devil recognizes the authority of Jesus
[1:15:35] how many believes that he recognizes it
[1:15:37] I can go go through the scripture and I
[1:15:39] got a 15 different directions I could go
[1:15:41] this morning but whenever you go in the
[1:15:42] scripture the Bible says in the
[1:15:44] synagogue there was a man which had a
[1:15:46] spirit of an unclean devil and the and
[1:15:48] he cried out with a loud voice and he
[1:15:50] said let us alone what are we to do with
[1:15:51] thee oh Jesus of Nazareth Art Thou come
[1:15:53] to destroy us I know who you are the
[1:15:56] Holy One Of God even the devil
[1:15:58] recognized who he was and he had an
[1:16:01] authority over him and the Bible says
[1:16:03] Jesus rebuked him said hold thy peace
[1:16:05] and come out of him and when the devil
[1:16:06] had thrown out of the midst of him he
[1:16:08] came out and heard him not and you
[1:16:09] remember what they said brother Wesley
[1:16:11] they said they were all amazed and they
[1:16:13] spake among themselves saying what a
[1:16:16] word is this for with authority and
[1:16:18] power he commandeth the unclean spirits
[1:16:21] and they came out of the man see Jesus
[1:16:24] had a authority over the devil and
[1:16:26] brother Mark let me tell you something
[1:16:28] he had authority over him then and he
[1:16:30] has authority over him now it ain't
[1:16:32] something for 2,000 years ago it wasn't
[1:16:34] something that was just written in the
[1:16:36] Bible it ain't a history lesson but the
[1:16:38] same Jesus that user his authority over
[1:16:41] the devil before he went to the cross of
[1:16:43] Calvary is the same Jesus that stands
[1:16:45] here this morning that has the same
[1:16:47] authority over the same devil he can
[1:16:49] still put him in his
[1:16:52] place let me tell you what happened when
[1:16:54] Peter caught that Revelation he went
[1:16:56] down to the gate beautiful him and John
[1:16:58] and there a man set that was lame and he
[1:17:00] said and he was begging arms and Peter
[1:17:01] said Silver and Gold Have I None but
[1:17:03] such as I have I give unto thee in the
[1:17:05] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up
[1:17:08] and walk see the name of Jesus it still
[1:17:11] has authority over the devil it had it
[1:17:13] out of the mouth of Peter it had it out
[1:17:15] of the mouth of John it had it out of
[1:17:16] the mouth of Paul it had it out of the
[1:17:18] mouth of William Brown and it still has
[1:17:20] it out of the mouth of every believer
[1:17:22] sitting here this morning the name of
[1:17:23] Jesus has a authority over the devil I
[1:17:27] believe that this morning he has
[1:17:29] authority over the devil you realize
[1:17:31] that Jesus has always had authority over
[1:17:34] him you realize that when Jesus came to
[1:17:37] do his work upon the Earth brother
[1:17:38] Wesley that that he didn't that that
[1:17:41] that whenever he went to the cross of
[1:17:42] Calvary before he even went to the Cross
[1:17:44] he already had Authority he could have
[1:17:47] called Angels an army of angels to come
[1:17:50] and to save him off a calvary's cross
[1:17:53] could have wiped all of Jerusalem him
[1:17:55] off the map at the at just one word that
[1:17:57] he spoke he already had authority over
[1:18:00] the devil can you think about that he
[1:18:02] went to the cross of Calvary willingly
[1:18:04] he already had Authority he went to and
[1:18:06] gave his own life willingly brother
[1:18:08] marah he already had Authority you say
[1:18:10] what was he doing here was a man the
[1:18:11] Bible says he made himself of no
[1:18:13] reputation and he took upon himself as
[1:18:15] the form of a servant and he was made in
[1:18:17] the likeness of men and being found
[1:18:20] fashioned as a man he humbled himself
[1:18:21] and became obedient unto death even the
[1:18:24] death of the cross thought isn't that
[1:18:25] wonderful that when God made you Brother
[1:18:27] David he made you as a as a man in the
[1:18:30] image of God and then because man when
[1:18:32] he came and he was made in the image of
[1:18:34] God that man fell God and he broke his
[1:18:36] Covenant with God and now we see the
[1:18:38] Bible says but here God would come again
[1:18:40] in the form of a servant and God would
[1:18:42] come in the form of a man where he made
[1:18:45] man in the form of God now the Bible
[1:18:46] says but now God fashioned himself in
[1:18:49] the form of a man that he could come and
[1:18:51] save man and give them back the very
[1:18:53] thing that they had lost in the garden
[1:18:56] he says so God he made himself and
[1:18:58] became obedient unto death the death of
[1:19:00] the Cross wherefore God has exalted him
[1:19:03] and given him a name which is above
[1:19:05] every name somebody say Amen a name
[1:19:07] above every name that at the name of
[1:19:09] Jesus every knee should bow it don't
[1:19:12] matter if it was things in heaven it
[1:19:14] didn't matter if it was things on earth
[1:19:16] the Bible said or even things under the
[1:19:18] Earth at the name of Jesus every knee
[1:19:21] would bow friends let me tell you a
[1:19:22] secret this morning let me just get to
[1:19:24] it that God he didn't go to Calvary so
[1:19:27] he could have authority over the devil
[1:19:29] he went to Calvary that you would have
[1:19:31] authority over the devil and he passed
[1:19:33] it down from generation to generation
[1:19:35] that we would be able to stand here this
[1:19:37] morning and still have authority over
[1:19:39] the same devil that same devil that took
[1:19:42] him up to calvary's cross the same devil
[1:19:44] that anointed the Pharisees not to
[1:19:46] believe his word that same devil you
[1:19:48] have authority over in this morning by
[1:19:50] the name of Jesus
[1:19:52] Christ that's why the prophet God would
[1:19:55] stand in a meeting and he would say
[1:19:57] Satan through your
[1:19:58] education I'm running out of time he
[1:20:00] would say Satan through your education
[1:20:02] and through the systems of the world
[1:20:04] you've blinded the people for years but
[1:20:07] you're exposed amen somebody say that
[1:20:09] this morning you're exposed on somebody
[1:20:12] just go ahead and say it you're exposed
[1:20:14] you're exposed devil he said see you
[1:20:16] blinded the people for years but you're
[1:20:18] exposed that makes me feel good I love
[1:20:20] exposing the devil I think we ought just
[1:20:22] get it all out there let you know what's
[1:20:24] been trouble in your home it wasn't it
[1:20:26] ain't because you're trying to go to
[1:20:27] church and your wife's upset about it
[1:20:29] it's the Devil he's exposed see it's the
[1:20:31] devil that don't want you going to
[1:20:32] church it's the devil that want your
[1:20:34] family broke up it's the devil that
[1:20:35] wants you to fall it's the devil that
[1:20:37] wants you to give up on God it's the
[1:20:39] devil that want you to be back it's the
[1:20:41] devil that don't want you to be a
[1:20:42] believer it ain't got nothing to do with
[1:20:44] your husband or your wife it's the devil
[1:20:46] I think it's time to expose him this
[1:20:48] morning God didn't make you sick it's
[1:20:51] the devil that done it God didn't make
[1:20:53] your Oh Glory
[1:20:55] God didn't make your husband do that
[1:20:56] it's the devil that does it I know we
[1:20:58] put a lot of blame on him but it's the
[1:21:00] truth he deserves all the blame you can
[1:21:01] put on him he's a stinking lying devil
[1:21:05] amen I feel good this morning he's a
[1:21:06] liar it's the devil that done it so see
[1:21:10] he he he said to you've blinded people
[1:21:12] through education the systems of the
[1:21:14] world but you're exposed we do not
[1:21:17] accept you can you say that we don't
[1:21:18] accept you speak that to the devil we
[1:21:21] don't accept you we claim that you was
[1:21:23] defeated at Calvary how many say that
[1:21:25] with me you were defeated at Calvary we
[1:21:28] me well and go tell him this morning
[1:21:29] driving Plum out of the building I claim
[1:21:31] you were defeated at Calvary I don't
[1:21:34] accept you you were defeated at Calvary
[1:21:36] when Christ died and he rose again you
[1:21:39] were stripped of every Power that you
[1:21:40] had you have no power left you're just
[1:21:42] to blood and we're calling on the blood
[1:21:45] in the name of Jesus Christ by the
[1:21:47] authority of the angel of God who has
[1:21:49] charged us in this meeting this morning
[1:21:52] you come out of the people and all you
[1:21:54] spirits diseases and leave the people
[1:21:56] alone in the name of Jesus Christ I
[1:21:59] thank God this morning that we have a
[1:22:01] scriptural authority over the devil I
[1:22:03] said he's been exposed won somebody
[1:22:05] expose him this morning say Satan you
[1:22:07] ain't nothing but a blood you lost your
[1:22:09] power on calvary's Cross when Jesus died
[1:22:12] and he rose again and he raised in power
[1:22:15] and gave me power and victory over you
[1:22:17] this morning you ain't nothing but a
[1:22:19] blood and I rebuke you in the name of
[1:22:21] Jesus Christ I rebuke the spirit of
[1:22:24] depression in the name of Jesus Christ I
[1:22:26] rebuke the spirit of pornography in the
[1:22:28] name of Jesus Christ I rebuke that
[1:22:30] spirit that Lon Spirit In The Name of
[1:22:33] Jesus Christ you have no authority over
[1:22:35] the Sons and Daughters of God I expose
[1:22:39] you in the name of Jesus
[1:22:42] Christ that's the confession of the
[1:22:45] Bride of Jesus Christ to say the same
[1:22:48] thing that Jesus spoke how many believes
[1:22:51] that brother M had that Authority tens
[1:22:53] of thousands thousands of times of
[1:22:55] people that were healed in his meeting
[1:22:57] many many would take and they would put
[1:22:59] it on that man and say well it's because
[1:23:01] of that man but you realize that he
[1:23:03] never kept that on himself but I love
[1:23:06] what a prophet said isn't it something
[1:23:07] that most of us we look and and it's a
[1:23:09] good thing every one of us well I wish
[1:23:11] I'd have been in brother B's meetings I
[1:23:13] wish I could have seen that I W and I do
[1:23:15] too I wish it wouldn't have been
[1:23:17] something brother Mark to see that gift
[1:23:19] of discernment operating in that way and
[1:23:21] and the in the testimonies of the people
[1:23:22] that witnessed it as the years go on
[1:23:25] those those testimonies or or those
[1:23:27] people would would die off with the old
[1:23:28] age and and before long there won't even
[1:23:30] be a person that was ever in his meeting
[1:23:32] that was they still alive is if the
[1:23:34] Rapture don't go before that time
[1:23:37] brother Wesley it's a it's a longing in
[1:23:39] my heart but let me tell you a secret
[1:23:41] that brother man he never he never kept
[1:23:42] that Authority that God gave him listen
[1:23:45] to this say see the church is going to
[1:23:47] be without the man but it'll never be
[1:23:49] without God the church whenever Paul was
[1:23:52] Pro was was was leading the Ephesian
[1:23:55] Church there came a time when the
[1:23:56] Ephesian church had to go on and Paul
[1:23:58] wasn't there no more they could they
[1:24:00] couldn't call him up and ask for ad
[1:24:02] advice I I don't know how they' have
[1:24:03] called him but they couldn't have sent a
[1:24:04] runner down there and asked for his
[1:24:06] advice he had never been able to offer
[1:24:07] it brother Mark because the man the body
[1:24:10] flesh of that man would fade away but
[1:24:12] listen to what brother maram said see he
[1:24:14] didn't keep that Authority I believe he
[1:24:15] had a great Authority how many believes
[1:24:16] that think of that Authority that he had
[1:24:19] over the devil when you listen to the
[1:24:21] those messages and how powerful that it
[1:24:22] is that Spirit you you'd hear an
[1:24:24] audience of people and you say well I
[1:24:26] wasn't there but let me tell you friends
[1:24:27] I rely on the jury of my peers we
[1:24:29] convict a man to death with 12
[1:24:31] people and in that's our country we can
[1:24:34] we can convict a man to death with 12
[1:24:36] people agreeing on one thing and saying
[1:24:38] yeah they did it and we rely on the jury
[1:24:39] of our peers to say that's what happened
[1:24:41] but let me tell you friends we had
[1:24:43] thousands of jury of a jury of our peers
[1:24:46] that sat in brother Bam's meetings that
[1:24:47] said that that ain't nothing but the
[1:24:49] truth is that what I say is that trueth
[1:24:51] that ain't nothing but the truth so
[1:24:52] don't you think you're going to come to
[1:24:53] me some 50 years later and go againsts
[1:24:56] what the jury said that mean thousands
[1:24:58] of jury members that sat in his meetings
[1:25:00] and said that ain't nothing but the
[1:25:01] angel of the Lord and everything he said
[1:25:03] it came to pass just like he said it was
[1:25:06] so the ver the verdict is already out
[1:25:07] I'm not here to debate the verdict the
[1:25:09] verdict is out I'm not here to call
[1:25:10] another jury you can't with you can't
[1:25:12] call the case again it's already been
[1:25:14] done but but but the verdicts already
[1:25:16] been and the jury of our peers confirmed
[1:25:19] it to be so the prophecy come to pass
[1:25:22] what see there was a great power in his
[1:25:23] ministry but I love this to see if there
[1:25:25] was a power in his ministry and
[1:25:27] Authority that he had listen what
[1:25:28] brother said in the message
[1:25:29] identification he said if there be a
[1:25:31] pastor here this morning that believes
[1:25:33] in praying for the sick I don't want to
[1:25:35] leave you people thinking that I'm
[1:25:37] standing up here as an evangelist and
[1:25:39] with a gift of discernment in this
[1:25:40] prophetic hour that we're living in I
[1:25:42] don't want to make you think that your
[1:25:44] pastor ain't just as much as anybody
[1:25:46] else he's a servant of Christ with the
[1:25:48] same Authority that I have or anybody
[1:25:51] else has because our Authority is in
[1:25:54] Jesus Christ you know what that Oh Glory
[1:25:56] that makes me feel good this morning you
[1:25:58] know why cuz here a prophet of God that
[1:26:00] had the authority of Jesus Christ that
[1:26:02] ain't the only one that has it but he
[1:26:04] your pastor has it just like anybody
[1:26:06] else has it the Evangelist has it the
[1:26:08] minister has it let me tell you that
[1:26:10] ought to make every Pastor stand in this
[1:26:12] position with confidence this morning to
[1:26:14] know that he has authority over the
[1:26:16] devil it ought to make every evangelist
[1:26:18] stand his position this morning and and
[1:26:20] have the authority over the devil every
[1:26:22] gospel preacher to have authority over
[1:26:24] the devil but brother Mark that ain't
[1:26:25] the end of it it ought to make every
[1:26:27] believer every mother every father every
[1:26:30] son and every daughter of God anybody
[1:26:32] else that is a believer that that has a
[1:26:34] revelation of God's word but a mark
[1:26:36] they've been given authority over the
[1:26:38] devil this morning every holy ghost
[1:26:40] filled mother has authority over the
[1:26:42] devil every holy ghost filled father has
[1:26:44] authority over the devil every holy
[1:26:46] ghost filled young man or young woman
[1:26:48] has authority over the devil so when he
[1:26:50] torment you and he tempts you and he
[1:26:52] comes by in the Midnight Hour but Mark I
[1:26:54] say stand up and look the devil in the
[1:26:56] eye and say at the name of Jesus Christ
[1:26:59] I rebuke you
[1:27:01] devil give him his leave we have a
[1:27:04] scriptural Authority I believe that I'm
[1:27:06] going to hurry the bride I believe what
[1:27:08] the bride should be she should be what
[1:27:10] the word says about her how many believe
[1:27:12] that I believe that's what the purpose
[1:27:14] of the message was it was to redeem a a
[1:27:17] bride and call her back to her position
[1:27:19] in Christ what man had lost you see the
[1:27:21] whole big picture brother the jar what
[1:27:23] man had lost here God would come just
[1:27:25] before the rapturing of the church and
[1:27:26] he would put the church back in its
[1:27:28] position isn't that wonderful that God
[1:27:31] would think enough about you look how
[1:27:33] much you mean to God that he would put
[1:27:34] you in this age an age that that was the
[1:27:36] worst age there ever was but he but he
[1:27:39] knew that brother Travis that you would
[1:27:40] be able to withstand this age and he'
[1:27:42] bring a revelation he knew you'd catch
[1:27:44] that Revelation and it would put you
[1:27:46] right back in your position that God has
[1:27:48] called you to you believe that this
[1:27:50] morning I believe that with a bride that
[1:27:52] the bride ought to be what God says
[1:27:53] about her
[1:27:54] that's what that's what God wants with
[1:27:56] you is is to be what his word says you
[1:27:59] are God don't want you to be lesser he
[1:28:01] wants you to be greater he wants you to
[1:28:04] be what the word says you are you
[1:28:05] realize this a you you you you find out
[1:28:08] that from the from from Genesis all the
[1:28:10] way to the Book of Revelation you'll
[1:28:11] find out there's only one reason for
[1:28:13] God's displeasure and that was for
[1:28:14] people leaving the word and then there
[1:28:16] ain't but one remedy for it to regain
[1:28:19] God's favor that's to get back to the
[1:28:21] word see sometimes we get off and
[1:28:23] sometimes we we we go down we go down
[1:28:25] Wild Goose chases and sometimes people
[1:28:27] get a little bit lost and they'll leave
[1:28:29] the word of God but here God would come
[1:28:30] in this last day brother Wesley for the
[1:28:33] purpose of bringing a people back to the
[1:28:34] word of God to regain the favor of God B
[1:28:38] said it like this he says see the church
[1:28:40] is built upon divine revelation not just
[1:28:43] any Revelation but the revelation of
[1:28:44] Jesus Christ in this hour not what he
[1:28:47] was in another hour but what he is now
[1:28:49] the Bible expresses it's growing in the
[1:28:51] bride to the full stature you realize
[1:28:53] the Church world the church world is
[1:28:55] looking for a Christ that's 2,000 years
[1:28:58] old they're looking for a Jesus that was
[1:29:01] 2,000 years ago and that's why they fail
[1:29:03] to see him today can I finish up with
[1:29:05] this but listen what Jesus said in John
[1:29:08] the the 12th chapter he said except a
[1:29:10] corn of wheat would go into the ground
[1:29:12] and die it abideth alone but if it die
[1:29:15] if it dies it bringeth forth much
[1:29:18] fruit you notice this is think about
[1:29:20] what he what he's saying it would go
[1:29:22] into the ground and die it would bring
[1:29:24] forth much fruit you realize this when
[1:29:25] Jesus makes this statement he had just
[1:29:27] came to Bethany to go have supper with
[1:29:30] Lazarus that just a few days ago was
[1:29:33] laying in a tomb and he raised him from
[1:29:35] the dead so then Jesus comes in just a
[1:29:38] few days before the Passover feast and
[1:29:40] he comes into bethan he sits down and
[1:29:42] he's going to have dinner with Lazarus
[1:29:43] and the Bible says many of the Jews came
[1:29:45] to the dinner because not they wanted to
[1:29:47] see Jesus but but they also wanted to
[1:29:48] see Lazarus because they heard the
[1:29:50] testimony of how that he was raised from
[1:29:52] the dead so it caed this great the this
[1:29:54] great uh movement that was going on
[1:29:56] around the the resurrection of Lazarus
[1:29:58] and so here the here they're coming oh
[1:30:01] just something to me that they're coming
[1:30:02] and they're gathering around a testimony
[1:30:04] of Resurrection look what's drawing the
[1:30:06] people together it's the it's the talk
[1:30:08] of Resurrection it's the talk talk of a
[1:30:10] of a Dead coming back to life and so
[1:30:12] they come and and and brother Mark they
[1:30:14] came so many to see this testimony the
[1:30:16] Bible said that even the Pharisees got
[1:30:19] together and they and they tried to
[1:30:21] think of ways that they could kill
[1:30:22] Lazarus what a foolish thought I wonder
[1:30:24] if how many of them are sitting in there
[1:30:26] when they sit around the council said
[1:30:27] I'll tell you what this Lazarus is
[1:30:28] causing too much problem because you
[1:30:30] know after all he raised from the dead
[1:30:32] and yeah I know the corner and the
[1:30:33] Corner's report was accurate he was
[1:30:35] certainly dead he had no pul he laid in
[1:30:37] there four days I mean it it was a long
[1:30:39] time before he came out he wasn't
[1:30:40] breathing it's a true testimony and one
[1:30:42] of them said well I got an idea why
[1:30:44] don't we just put him to death I wonder
[1:30:45] if one of them sitting behind said I
[1:30:47] don't know if that'll work or not you
[1:30:49] know just a few days ago he was already
[1:30:51] there but the Bible says but they
[1:30:52] thought together to put Lazarus to death
[1:30:55] to end the testimony I I thought my but
[1:30:57] it wouldn't matter anyway brother Wesley
[1:30:59] but while they were thinking on these
[1:31:00] things the Bible says here here they
[1:31:03] would make this plot and and because of
[1:31:05] the the many of the Jews they went away
[1:31:07] and the Pharisees said here's the
[1:31:08] problem that there's so many of our Jews
[1:31:10] that are leaving the synagogues and
[1:31:11] they're going to follow after this Jesus
[1:31:13] because of the mighty works that he's
[1:31:15] done and the next day much people came
[1:31:17] to the feast the Bible said when they
[1:31:18] heard Jesus was coming they took fig
[1:31:20] leaves or or or branches of palm trees
[1:31:22] and they and they went out and they met
[1:31:24] him and they cried Hosanna blessed be
[1:31:26] the king of Israel that cometh in the
[1:31:28] name of the Lord they gave him a great
[1:31:29] welcome because he was coming into town
[1:31:32] the Pharisees looked out at him and they
[1:31:33] said it looks like the whole world is
[1:31:36] going to follow him this was their
[1:31:38] concern it looked like everybody is
[1:31:40] going to follow him and I I love this
[1:31:42] because then the Bible says but then
[1:31:45] there was some Greeks that came to
[1:31:46] Phillip and the Greeks said requesting
[1:31:48] him he said sir we would see Jesus is't
[1:31:52] that something that's what many are
[1:31:53] looking for today Sirah we we would see
[1:31:56] Jesus and notice but then whenever they
[1:31:58] came and asked him this and then Phillip
[1:32:00] and and Andrew they went to Jesus and
[1:32:02] told him there's some there's some
[1:32:03] Greeks out there and they want to they
[1:32:04] want to see you and the Bible says and
[1:32:06] then Jesus answered them saying the hour
[1:32:08] is come that the son of man should be
[1:32:10] glorified in other words this is a time
[1:32:11] that this flesh that that that this
[1:32:13] ministry of this flesh will no longer be
[1:32:15] it's coming the time of it fading away
[1:32:17] this is the purpose of my coming but
[1:32:20] here he is prophesying that he's going
[1:32:21] to go into a grave and he'll come back
[1:32:23] and a glorified body and one day he'll
[1:32:25] Ascend so so he's actually prophesying
[1:32:27] of his own death and burial and
[1:32:29] Resurrection he said the hour has come
[1:32:31] that the son of man would be glorified
[1:32:33] notice and when he says this he says but
[1:32:35] verily I say unto you except a corn of
[1:32:37] wheat would fall into the ground it and
[1:32:40] die it abideth alone but if it die it'll
[1:32:42] bring forth much fruit so not only is he
[1:32:45] prophesying but he's accepting it he
[1:32:47] said why why would I say would say well
[1:32:49] let this uh uh apart from me but but
[1:32:51] this was for the purpose that I came
[1:32:52] into this world so he's prophesying of
[1:32:55] his death and burrow and Resurrection in
[1:32:57] other words he's testifying that this
[1:32:58] would be his purpose he said for this
[1:33:00] cause I came into this hour and then he
[1:33:02] speaks and he says father glorify thy
[1:33:04] name and the Bible said and there came a
[1:33:06] voice out of heaven and said I have both
[1:33:08] glorified it and I will glorify it again
[1:33:11] so in other words you have seen it
[1:33:13] you've seen a mighty work of the Messiah
[1:33:15] you've seen the signs of the Messiah but
[1:33:17] that ain't all but you're going to see
[1:33:19] it again he said I have glorified it but
[1:33:21] you're going to you're going to glorify
[1:33:23] it again now watch watch this very
[1:33:24] closely did you catch this that when the
[1:33:27] Greek we crested to see them how many
[1:33:28] knows what a Greek was I got I got just
[1:33:30] a minute how many it's only it ain't
[1:33:31] even 12:30 but but but the Greek was the
[1:33:34] gentile people you go back in the Bible
[1:33:36] from the days of the flooding of Noah
[1:33:38] there came three races of people off the
[1:33:39] ark it was ham sham and it was the
[1:33:41] Samaritan the Jews and the Gentiles that
[1:33:44] which is which is what we're of and so
[1:33:46] we see that the Bible would tell us of
[1:33:48] these three races that the gentile
[1:33:50] people had never saw the Messiah sign
[1:33:52] you remember this sign now now notice
[1:33:54] there's a there's a powerful point I
[1:33:55] don't have time to preach it this
[1:33:56] morning but there's a powerful point but
[1:33:58] makes here he says the reason they
[1:34:00] didn't see it is because they weren't
[1:34:01] looking for it so the Gentile had never
[1:34:04] seen this Messiah sign but notice the
[1:34:06] Samaritan and the Jews the other two
[1:34:09] races they had been represented and
[1:34:11] seeing the sign of the Messiah because
[1:34:13] scripturally these two races of people
[1:34:16] had been taught that he was coming and
[1:34:18] so because it was prophesied and they
[1:34:20] were taught that they would see the
[1:34:21] Messiah and and by their prophets they
[1:34:23] follow the message of their prophets
[1:34:25] that they would that how they would
[1:34:26] recognize him then they saw that Messiah
[1:34:28] sign we we see it in two stories one of
[1:34:30] them was the woman at the well remember
[1:34:31] Jesus said I have needs to go by Samaria
[1:34:33] there was a Samaritan woman when he went
[1:34:35] to talk to her notied the sign of the
[1:34:37] Messiah is because he told her he said I
[1:34:40] I just hurry through it but but he told
[1:34:41] her he said woman go get your husband
[1:34:43] she said I have no husband he said
[1:34:45] you've spoken true because you've had
[1:34:47] five husbands and the one you're with
[1:34:49] now is not your own and she said I've
[1:34:52] heard that when the Messiah comes he
[1:34:54] would do these things he said I am he
[1:34:56] that speaks unto thee she went into town
[1:34:58] the Bible said saying come and see a man
[1:35:00] that told me all the things that I've
[1:35:02] ever done so see it was a Samaritan that
[1:35:04] seen a messiah sign now notice it again
[1:35:07] there was a man by the name of Nathaniel
[1:35:09] that was a Jewish man remember whenever
[1:35:10] Jesus called philli and Philip went out
[1:35:12] and he and he called his brothers he
[1:35:14] went down to Nathaniel and and he's
[1:35:16] called Nathaniel he said come we found
[1:35:17] the Messiah the one we've been waiting
[1:35:19] on see they were looking for him to come
[1:35:21] they've been prophesied they they beli
[1:35:23] the proph and so when Nathaniel went to
[1:35:25] meet Jesus and he was a long way off
[1:35:27] Jesus said behold an Israelite whom
[1:35:29] there is no whom there is no G in other
[1:35:32] words an Israelite that there is no
[1:35:33] deceit and Nathaniel said unto him he
[1:35:35] said when did you know me and Jesus said
[1:35:38] before Philip called you when you were
[1:35:40] sitting under the Fig Tree I saw you and
[1:35:42] Nathaniel answered him and said Rabbi
[1:35:45] you are the Son of God and the king of
[1:35:47] Israel and Jesus said because I said you
[1:35:49] were under a fig tree you believe you
[1:35:51] will see greater things than these see
[1:35:53] he saw the Messiah sign he saw things
[1:35:56] that and knew things about his life that
[1:35:59] that he didn't put there he he knew
[1:36:01] things about his life that he didn't
[1:36:02] tell him when did you know me how did
[1:36:04] you know this was going on the same
[1:36:05] thing that happened to the woman at the
[1:36:07] well how did you know my five husbands
[1:36:09] how how did you know about the back part
[1:36:10] of my life how how would you know all
[1:36:12] the things that I've ever done but
[1:36:13] because he saw what she had done she
[1:36:16] identified it as a sign of the Messiah I
[1:36:18] hope you hear me this morning we're not
[1:36:20] talking about it was just some ordinary
[1:36:22] man that was sitting by the well but it
[1:36:24] was a sign of the Messiah and because
[1:36:26] the Samaritan was looking for the
[1:36:27] Messiah she recognized the sign when she
[1:36:30] saw it because the Jew was looking for
[1:36:32] the Messiah he recognized the sign
[1:36:34] whenever he saw it see they recognized
[1:36:37] it was a messiah sign but then then the
[1:36:39] Bible says but then the Greeks came to
[1:36:41] see him see now the Gentile comes and
[1:36:44] what Jesus says when there when the
[1:36:46] Gentile comes to see him isn't it
[1:36:47] something that that's whenever he said
[1:36:49] the hour has come the son of man should
[1:36:51] be glorified this is the end of it
[1:36:54] if the Gentiles coming to seek it's the
[1:36:55] end of it see because the Gentiles
[1:36:57] started asking questions and Jesus knew
[1:36:59] that it wasn't time for that listen to
[1:37:02] me for a minute he knew that it wasn't
[1:37:03] time that that that that sign had never
[1:37:05] been performed on a gentile but just as
[1:37:08] the Jews and the Samaritans would have
[1:37:10] hundreds of years by The Mark of
[1:37:12] prophecies that was building up for them
[1:37:14] to have what they what what what they
[1:37:16] would would need in order to search for
[1:37:18] Christ whenever he came then here Jesus
[1:37:20] would prophesy that the Gentile would
[1:37:22] have the same thing thing so in other
[1:37:24] words what would we what that one day
[1:37:26] the gentile people would be looking for
[1:37:28] a messiah the thing they never done
[1:37:29] 2,000 years ago that race of people
[1:37:31] wasn't looking for a messiah 2,000 years
[1:37:33] ago but then but after Christ had went
[1:37:35] into the grave and he raised from the
[1:37:37] dead you realize that that they came to
[1:37:39] him and they looked to him because of
[1:37:41] the prophecies that they had but do you
[1:37:43] realize that when we come this age and
[1:37:45] we're looking for a messiah nobody saw
[1:37:46] that Messiah sign for 2,000 years there
[1:37:49] ain't a gentile ever saw it until the
[1:37:51] age that we live in today that's the age
[1:37:54] that's the age of the revealing listen
[1:37:56] he says see when the Messiah would come
[1:37:58] they would look for it we're not looking
[1:38:00] at the same prophecies that the Jews had
[1:38:02] I know I run out of time but we're not
[1:38:04] looking at the same prophecies they had
[1:38:06] do you realize that the gentile people
[1:38:07] I'm I feel good cuz I know where I'm
[1:38:09] going but the gentile people brother
[1:38:11] Mark we're not looking at Isaiah Behold
[1:38:13] a virgin shall conceive because she
[1:38:15] already did we're not looking at the
[1:38:17] prophecy he was wounded for our
[1:38:19] transgression because he already was
[1:38:21] we're not looking at the prophecy of M
[1:38:23] that out of Bethlehem that become a
[1:38:25] ruler over Israel we're not looking for
[1:38:27] the prophecy of Psalms when David said
[1:38:29] he would say my God why hast Thou
[1:38:31] forsaken me you realize friends we're
[1:38:33] not looking for him to die on a cross
[1:38:35] we're not looking for him to be born in
[1:38:37] a manger we're not looking for a Star to
[1:38:39] announce his birth our prophecies aren't
[1:38:41] the same thing it's not the same
[1:38:43] prophecy see if you're still looking to
[1:38:45] see him in that way you'll never see him
[1:38:48] you see where the church world has
[1:38:49] missed Christ because they take them
[1:38:51] same prophecies and they preach them to
[1:38:52] their people and that's all they ever
[1:38:54] that's as far as they ever go and so
[1:38:56] they look for that same Jesus that
[1:38:57] walked on Nazareth that had a crown of
[1:38:59] thorns on his head and Nails cars in his
[1:39:01] hands and they and they and they'll
[1:39:02] they'll get people up in front of their
[1:39:03] Church testifying I think I seen him the
[1:39:05] other day walking down the street I I
[1:39:07] heard a great Revival one time in
[1:39:08] another country they said Jesus was
[1:39:10] walking amongst them I said well it
[1:39:11] ain't no Revival that God said because
[1:39:13] Jesus wouldn't be walking out there it'd
[1:39:16] be a false Christ because he wouldn't
[1:39:17] come up on this Earth until it was
[1:39:19] already burned over he wouldn't even
[1:39:20] step a foot on it so listen said ain't
[1:39:23] the same prophecy brother Mark that's
[1:39:25] why they miss Jesus is because they're
[1:39:27] looking at the wrong prophecy but I
[1:39:28] thank God that there's some people like
[1:39:30] the woman at the well and there's some
[1:39:32] people like Nathaniel was that looked at
[1:39:34] the prophecies that was concerning their
[1:39:35] age see our it started in Paul's
[1:39:37] Ministry when Paul went out as a
[1:39:39] messenger of the Gentile and he be to
[1:39:41] talk about I I the same Jesus that was
[1:39:44] sent to the Jews but now he's coming to
[1:39:45] the gentile people and then Luke after
[1:39:48] Paul's Ministry then Luke begins to
[1:39:50] write about it and we find Luke 17:30
[1:39:52] then John goes to the of patmas in
[1:39:54] Revelations 10:7 and he begins to write
[1:39:56] about it what it's prophecies concerning
[1:39:58] Christ in the age that we live in see if
[1:40:01] people don't if they if they it ain't
[1:40:03] preached to them there's no revelation
[1:40:05] of it then they fail to see Christ in
[1:40:07] their age see we're not looking for nail
[1:40:09] scarred hands we're looking for the word
[1:40:12] to be made manifest isn't that what
[1:40:13] Jesus said this is the Christ that we
[1:40:15] would see today the Bible says in the
[1:40:17] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:40:19] with God and the Word was God then the
[1:40:22] word was made flesh and then that seed
[1:40:24] by the market went into the ground and
[1:40:26] it came back in the form of the Holy
[1:40:28] Ghost it fell upon them in the upper
[1:40:30] room and you know what they did they
[1:40:31] done the same things that Jesus done
[1:40:33] whenever he was walking upon the Earth
[1:40:35] they did the same works then the church
[1:40:38] went through this phase brother Mark
[1:40:40] where where many would give their lives
[1:40:41] and and and the martyrs would come and
[1:40:44] and it looked like the entire church had
[1:40:45] lost its power and it had died and and
[1:40:48] spiritually the church had failed but
[1:40:50] notice when a prophet would come he
[1:40:51] would say but that wasn't the end of it
[1:40:53] listen friends pointing people back to
[1:40:55] Christ this is important that wasn't the
[1:40:57] end of it he said because Jesus said if
[1:40:58] a corn of wheat of Christ had to fall on
[1:41:00] the ground then so would the bride have
[1:41:02] to fall on the ground through the Dark
[1:41:03] Ages so don't let it make you lose
[1:41:05] confidence in God that God had forgotten
[1:41:07] his people or let him go through that
[1:41:09] but any grain that goes in the ground it
[1:41:11] must die or it can't reproduce itself
[1:41:13] and that great church that had
[1:41:14] established on the day of Pentecost by
[1:41:16] sending the Holy Ghost it had to suffer
[1:41:18] martydom to go into the dirt into the
[1:41:19] Earth in the Dark Age and bring forth
[1:41:21] again the age of Luther and in the full
[1:41:24] stature of the Bride of Jesus Christ for
[1:41:26] this last day so the church through the
[1:41:27] Dark Ages you can read the history of
[1:41:29] the church every historian will tell
[1:41:31] tell you pretty much the same history
[1:41:32] that it went into the Dark Ages and it
[1:41:34] seemed to die off but now in the last
[1:41:36] day the Revival came back to the church
[1:41:38] and Martin Luther he went to the Roman
[1:41:40] Catholic church and he posted something
[1:41:41] on the door the thesis on the door and
[1:41:43] said this ain't nothing but a den of
[1:41:45] Thieves it Ain it ain't nothing but a
[1:41:46] house of devils and he went out in that
[1:41:48] great movement and Revival begin to
[1:41:50] strike the the world again what was was
[1:41:53] it it was the it was the resurrection of
[1:41:55] the Church of God in other words I I
[1:41:57] could say it like this it was the
[1:41:58] resurrection of the Resurrection see
[1:42:01] Jesus he had already resurrected they
[1:42:03] had already seen him in power but now in
[1:42:05] this age we' saw a resurrection of that
[1:42:07] power of Resurrection we've seen the
[1:42:08] same thing you see now so God came in
[1:42:11] this age and he showed that same Messiah
[1:42:14] sign to turn the hearts of people back
[1:42:17] to the word of God are y'all seeing that
[1:42:20] so that's what God would have to do he
[1:42:21] would turn it was our turn as a gentile
[1:42:23] people to see the Messiah sign but he
[1:42:26] see he brought it to turn the hearts of
[1:42:28] people back to the word of God and the
[1:42:31] Bible says you know what happened many
[1:42:33] believed on him but you know what many
[1:42:35] saw the same sign and didn't
[1:42:37] believe but you realize that same thing
[1:42:39] happened in John 12 Bible says but
[1:42:41] though he had done so many miracles
[1:42:42] before them yet they believe not on him
[1:42:46] they that the saying of Isaiah the
[1:42:48] prophet might be fulfilled which he
[1:42:50] spoke Lord who hath believed our report
[1:42:53] and to whom hath the arm of the Lord
[1:42:55] been
[1:42:56] revealed whom hath believed our report
[1:42:59] and whom ha the arm of the Lord been
[1:43:02] revealed who would believe a a messiah
[1:43:05] sign you say well who would believe it
[1:43:08] would' be those that were called to
[1:43:10] believe it it would be those that were
[1:43:12] ordained to believe it it was those that
[1:43:15] were seeking after it do you realize the
[1:43:18] the the the difference between that
[1:43:19] little woman at the well and all the
[1:43:21] rest of the women that wandered around
[1:43:22] and Samaria she she was different she
[1:43:25] was ordained Jesus said I have a need to
[1:43:28] go by there he said what would made her
[1:43:30] different than everybody else he knew
[1:43:32] he's an eternal God he knows all things
[1:43:35] he knows every thought he know what You'
[1:43:36] do he know the decisions you'd make he
[1:43:38] knows the choices you'd make although
[1:43:39] he'll allow you to make mistakes he
[1:43:40] knows the mistakes you're going to make
[1:43:43] because he's an eternal God said but he
[1:43:45] had a need to go by there I thought
[1:43:47] isn't it something that in our age but
[1:43:49] Mark that we would see that Messiah sign
[1:43:51] I'm closing we you would see that
[1:43:53] Messiah sign as a gentile people brother
[1:43:56] Wesley it would it would cause a people
[1:43:59] to become Believers it would take the
[1:44:01] word of God and he would take the
[1:44:03] mysteries of God and reveal them to a
[1:44:04] people in such a way that you would be
[1:44:06] able to believe God's word again and all
[1:44:09] of a sudden the things if you if you if
[1:44:11] you had the time to go through every
[1:44:12] church but the things that the churches
[1:44:14] have taken out of the Bible and saying
[1:44:16] that's for another day and that's for a
[1:44:17] day gone by and that was for the
[1:44:19] disciples and that was for the things
[1:44:20] that they took out here that God would
[1:44:22] send them man that was so anointed of
[1:44:24] God to say that didn't that wasn't meant
[1:44:26] to be taken out of the Bible it was
[1:44:28] meant to be revealed and meant to be
[1:44:29] believed and he would take it and he
[1:44:31] would prove it by that same Messiah sign
[1:44:33] that a people would believe the
[1:44:34] revelation of God's
[1:44:36] word brother Mark they would see the
[1:44:38] Messiah sign I thought it was something
[1:44:41] you know one night one night at a
[1:44:43] Revival meeting if the music player want
[1:44:45] to come one night at a Revival meeting
[1:44:47] there was a there was a woman that came
[1:44:49] up for for prayer or or or had came to
[1:44:52] the meeting and and she had her sister
[1:44:54] that was laying on her deathbed she had
[1:44:56] cancer in her stomach and had got into
[1:44:58] such a bad place that that they had left
[1:45:00] her bedridden the doctors couldn't do
[1:45:02] nothing for her so they they let send
[1:45:04] her home to die didn't even couldn't
[1:45:06] even get out of the bed to use a
[1:45:08] bathroom or nothing there she was she
[1:45:09] was just so ate up with
[1:45:11] cancer and in this meeting here this
[1:45:13] woman had came and in the audience the
[1:45:16] audience about 1500 people gathered in
[1:45:18] this audience here brother Bram was
[1:45:20] standing in this in this place and he
[1:45:22] called calls the woman out by name here
[1:45:25] she's in the audience has this no doubt
[1:45:27] on her heart and notice whenever he
[1:45:28] calls her out he says you left home
[1:45:30] tonight you put a little white
[1:45:32] handkerchief in your pocket and you got
[1:45:34] it off a marble top dresser and it's got
[1:45:37] a little blue working in the corner of
[1:45:38] it and you got a sister and he told her
[1:45:41] a sister's name that's dying with cancer
[1:45:43] he said if you'll go take that
[1:45:44] handkerchief and you'll put it on your
[1:45:46] sister thus sayith the Lord she shall
[1:45:48] live what is it friends it wasn't no
[1:45:52] different than the same sign that Jesus
[1:45:54] showed think about it you going to take
[1:45:57] that handkerchief they had the blue
[1:45:58] markings on it what could show a man the
[1:46:01] a handkerchief laying on somebody's
[1:46:02] marble toop dresser with blue markings
[1:46:04] on the edge of it and say go take that
[1:46:06] and lay it on your sister and she'll
[1:46:08] receive her healing you know what
[1:46:09] happened brother Mark she she took it
[1:46:11] and she took that uh handkerchief and
[1:46:13] she went back to her sister's house and
[1:46:15] she laid it on her sister and you know
[1:46:16] what the report said that the that that
[1:46:18] she that the shout got sooud in there
[1:46:20] when she received her healing they went
[1:46:22] to shouting and pra the Lord so loud
[1:46:23] that the neighbors that were far off
[1:46:25] they heard the test or the the shouting
[1:46:27] that was going on and they thought they
[1:46:29] thought they thought there was some kind
[1:46:30] of thing going on there and the neighbor
[1:46:33] said well you know what I think the
[1:46:34] woman must have died there's some
[1:46:36] commotion going on at her house and you
[1:46:38] realize that brother Mark that when this
[1:46:40] happened that one of those neighbors
[1:46:41] didn't believe in God but he heard the
[1:46:44] commotion going on he didn't believe in
[1:46:46] God he he didn't believe in Jesus he
[1:46:48] certainly didn't believe in no Messiah
[1:46:50] but God began to deal with his heart so
[1:46:53] he goes down the next day and when he
[1:46:55] goes down they find they find out that
[1:46:57] the woman she wasn't dead but she was
[1:46:58] healed he went in they found her sitting
[1:47:00] there eating breakfast but you know what
[1:47:03] that man went off that man that was an
[1:47:04] unbeliever and he didn't believe in God
[1:47:06] and brother Wesley the Lord began to
[1:47:08] deal with his heart and as he dealt with
[1:47:10] his heart he put it on his heart a
[1:47:11] longing here was a man I thought isn't
[1:47:13] it something a man that was a admitted
[1:47:16] unbeliever an admitted atheist he was an
[1:47:19] admitted Infidel but God would deal with
[1:47:21] his heart and something in his heart
[1:47:23] said I would like to meet the man that
[1:47:26] stood in the pull pit in front of 1500
[1:47:28] people and said go take the handkerchief
[1:47:31] that you took off your dresser and go
[1:47:33] put it on your sister and the Lord's
[1:47:34] going to heal her and God healed her
[1:47:37] that same man had testified he had seen
[1:47:38] the woman in her dead State he had seen
[1:47:41] her when she was laying there sick he
[1:47:43] had seen her there him and his own wife
[1:47:44] had gone down to her house and changed
[1:47:46] the sheets on her bed while she was
[1:47:47] laying there dying and that same man had
[1:47:49] witnessed the next morning when she was
[1:47:51] sitting there eating breakfast and for
[1:47:53] the months that followed he went every
[1:47:55] day that that man he knew the woman the
[1:47:57] testimony that surrounded her life and
[1:47:59] admittedly still yet I'm an unbeliever
[1:48:02] but some desire in his
[1:48:04] heart would say I'd like to meet that
[1:48:07] man if there ever was a preacher I ever
[1:48:09] would want to meet it'd be that one if
[1:48:12] there was a true one it'd be that one I
[1:48:14] thought isn't it something that God
[1:48:15] would see the desire of an unbeliever he
[1:48:18] would see he would put a desire in the
[1:48:20] heart of an unbeliever you me tell you
[1:48:21] why because unbeliever was predestinated
[1:48:24] by God you know I know a lot of people
[1:48:26] get this mixed up and they say well you
[1:48:27] know there's three kinds of Believers in
[1:48:29] every Church there's Believers and make
[1:48:31] Believers and then there's unbelievers
[1:48:32] then they'll pick themselves out as the
[1:48:34] Believers and say well that one's an
[1:48:35] unbeliever and that one's a make
[1:48:36] believer and they'll they'll just
[1:48:37] they'll just assign everybody a position
[1:48:40] but let me tell you a secret friends
[1:48:41] I've been all three of them hello
[1:48:43] somebody there was a time when I was a
[1:48:46] mate believer and there was a time when
[1:48:47] I was an unbeliever but I thank God
[1:48:49] today that he made a Believer out of me
[1:48:52] God God saw a man that was an
[1:48:54] unbeliever but he put a desire in his
[1:48:56] heart why because he was predestinated
[1:48:59] of God and all these years are G by here
[1:49:00] was a man 76 years old brother Mar an
[1:49:03] unbeliever and then one day here a
[1:49:07] couple Brothers was going on a hunting
[1:49:10] trip brother B was traing with his buddy
[1:49:13] brother Banks Woods he said you know he
[1:49:15] said I heard there's some squirrels down
[1:49:16] here down in this holler they went down
[1:49:18] there and he she he pulled up and hear
[1:49:20] that man I thought no doubt his wife had
[1:49:22] prayed many days for his salvation his
[1:49:25] friend that was sitting there under the
[1:49:26] tree with him no doubt he had prayed
[1:49:27] many days for his salvation his friend
[1:49:29] he was visiting with he was a
[1:49:30] Believer and all of a sudden they're
[1:49:32] sitting under a tree and the Very desire
[1:49:35] that was in his heart came pulling up in
[1:49:36] his driveway from another state that he
[1:49:39] lived in he came pulling up in this
[1:49:41] man's driveway and he got out and said
[1:49:44] sir you know the the brothers with him
[1:49:46] he said sir you know I I I'm looking to
[1:49:49] go squirrel hunting and then brother BR
[1:49:51] was in the car he got out of the car he
[1:49:54] said well who's this he said well this
[1:49:55] is my pastor he said you mean you got
[1:49:57] soow down you had to pack a preacher
[1:49:58] around with you he said I guess y'all
[1:50:01] know he said I'm an Infidel I'm an
[1:50:03] unbeliever he said I know you preachers
[1:50:06] y'all are all baring barking up the
[1:50:07] wrong tree I don't believe in that kind
[1:50:09] of stuff I'm 76 years old and I've never
[1:50:11] seen no God I've never seen an angel of
[1:50:14] God therefore it don't exist you see the
[1:50:17] difference he was looking for God in the
[1:50:19] wrong way he was looking for Jesus from
[1:50:22] th000 years ago he was looking for an
[1:50:24] angel to come walking amongst him
[1:50:26] brother Mark but he said I've never seen
[1:50:29] God there must not be one I don't
[1:50:30] believe in that but you realize that why
[1:50:33] he said he didn't believe it that here
[1:50:36] but BR he said he said you know he said
[1:50:38] there is one preacher I'd like to meet
[1:50:41] though and he begin to tell him the
[1:50:43] testimony of that girl that was healed
[1:50:46] he said she was my neighbor and this is
[1:50:48] what happened to her and he told the
[1:50:49] told the testimony of it and as he told
[1:50:52] it all of a sudden he was he he was
[1:50:55] brother Mark I thought you know he was
[1:50:56] something like those like those Gentiles
[1:50:59] that went to see Jesus he said I'd like
[1:51:02] to meet the man isn't that something sir
[1:51:04] we would see Jesus I'd like to meet the
[1:51:06] man that could say that he said you know
[1:51:10] he said what would you want to meet him
[1:51:11] for he said well he said I'd like to ask
[1:51:13] him a few questions you know sometimes
[1:51:16] that's just what it takes to see Jesus
[1:51:18] you realize that when the Gentiles asked
[1:51:20] they asked Phillip and Philip went to
[1:51:22] Jesus Jesus but said see isn't it
[1:51:24] something he said sometimes it just
[1:51:26] takes a servant to bring you into his
[1:51:29] presence here for 76 years this man had
[1:51:32] looked for Jesus but couldn't find him
[1:51:35] but a servant of the Lord came up and
[1:51:37] brought him into his presence isn't it
[1:51:40] something brother Wesley here he was
[1:51:41] sitting under that tree and he came he
[1:51:44] said you know I'd like to talk to him he
[1:51:46] said I want to ask him some questions I
[1:51:47] want to know how he knew that woman up
[1:51:50] there and I want to know how that he
[1:51:52] knew he had never been in this country
[1:51:54] before how do he know she was dying with
[1:51:56] cancer how did he know that she was
[1:51:58] going to be healed how do he know what
[1:52:00] her name was how did he know who her
[1:52:02] sister was how did he know she was going
[1:52:04] to get well when the handkerchief was
[1:52:05] put on her how did he know that her
[1:52:07] sister had a handkerchief laying on her
[1:52:09] dresser there's some questions I would
[1:52:11] like to ask him he said I'd like to talk
[1:52:14] to him when I see him I want to ask him
[1:52:16] these questions you know what brother
[1:52:18] Mark one of the most powerful stories
[1:52:19] I've ever heard in my life brother B
[1:52:22] down he there was an apple laid on the
[1:52:24] ground he picked that Apple up he said
[1:52:26] you mind if I have one of these apples
[1:52:27] he said sure you can have one the yellow
[1:52:29] jackets eat them all
[1:52:31] anyway he said you know sir he said can
[1:52:33] I ask you a question he said there ain't
[1:52:35] even a a sign of frost anywhere it's
[1:52:37] still warm out he said but wonder why
[1:52:40] all the leaves are falling off his tree
[1:52:42] well that man he was proud of his apple
[1:52:43] tree he planted it 40 years
[1:52:45] ago he said well he said that's because
[1:52:48] the sap that's in the tree the life left
[1:52:51] the leaf he said 'well where did it go
[1:52:54] the man saidwell it goes down in the
[1:52:55] root of the tree he said see because we
[1:52:58] have Winters up here I don't know if you
[1:52:59] ain't from around here but we have
[1:53:01] Winters up here that go - 20° below zero
[1:53:04] he said if that if this tree ever got in
[1:53:06] that kind of winter it'd kill it it
[1:53:07] never bring forth fruit again he said so
[1:53:09] the life leaves out of it the sap goes
[1:53:11] down into the root he said and then in
[1:53:12] the springtime the Sap's going to come
[1:53:14] back and it'll bring new life listen
[1:53:16] what he's doing he's testifying of the
[1:53:19] Resurrection if a corn of wheat would
[1:53:22] fall into the ground it would abideth
[1:53:24] alone but if it die it'll bring forth
[1:53:25] much fruit here a man that's an
[1:53:27] unbeliever is preaching a sermon he's
[1:53:30] testifying of the resurrection and what
[1:53:32] he's what he's doing brother Joe is he's
[1:53:34] actually testifying of the very thing
[1:53:36] that Jesus said would
[1:53:37] happen it would abide alone but now
[1:53:40] it'll bring forth fruit he said if
[1:53:42] that's what happened he says he explains
[1:53:44] it and brother B turned and looked at
[1:53:47] him he says you know I think it's
[1:53:48] something he said if you put a old
[1:53:50] wooden bucket full of water you set it
[1:53:51] on that on that fence post he said that
[1:53:54] water never goes down in the
[1:53:56] bottom he said but let me ask you he
[1:53:59] said what kind of intelligence tells
[1:54:01] that before the frost Falls you better
[1:54:03] get out of here and run down the route
[1:54:04] and hide if you don't you're going to
[1:54:06] die he said what intelligence tells that
[1:54:08] sap to do that the man says well I I
[1:54:11] don't know just nature I guess but said
[1:54:13] well I'll tell you what he said we're
[1:54:14] going to go hunting he said but when I
[1:54:16] come back you tell me what intelligence
[1:54:18] tells the sap in that tree to go out and
[1:54:21] to go back in the root and died in the
[1:54:22] spring to come back again and when you
[1:54:24] tell me that I'll tell you what
[1:54:26] intelligence told me that that woman was
[1:54:28] going to be
[1:54:30] healed that man said oh no you you're
[1:54:33] that man he said yes sir I'm brother
[1:54:35] brandham I was the one that had the
[1:54:36] meeting said my you don't you don't look
[1:54:38] like a preacher you know why cuz he was
[1:54:40] looking for Jesus in the wrong way but
[1:54:42] it was the life of Jesus Christ
[1:54:44] manifested here he was testifying
[1:54:46] brother Mark of a messiah sign and
[1:54:48] didn't even see it an Infidel an
[1:54:51] unbeliever but God would put a desire in
[1:54:53] his heart to change it brother bam LED
[1:54:56] that man to the Lord a few months later
[1:54:58] his wife said he died and when he died
[1:55:00] he was praising the Lord when he died he
[1:55:02] served the Lord from that day forward
[1:55:04] why because he saw a messiah sign I
[1:55:07] thought isn't it something that God of
[1:55:08] all the I thought man of all the things
[1:55:11] that that he had seen but the very
[1:55:13] nature of a tree declared unto him that
[1:55:15] there was a God he planted it 40 years
[1:55:18] ago if you don't stand to your feet
[1:55:20] something that he planted 40 years ago
[1:55:22] he saw that seed brother Joe for 40
[1:55:24] years he saw it go into the ground he
[1:55:26] saw it bring forth life he saw it mature
[1:55:29] and every year he's seen it die and he
[1:55:31] seen it come back again in the spring
[1:55:33] but he never saw God he seen the death
[1:55:36] and the bual and the resurrection but he
[1:55:38] never saw God he seen the testimony but
[1:55:41] he never saw God but then one day that
[1:55:44] same God that same Messiah it wasn't the
[1:55:47] man but it was the god in the man the
[1:55:51] sign of the Messiah
[1:55:52] he stood in his midst and tonning the
[1:55:54] Very testimony of Jesus Christ I thought
[1:55:57] my a't it something here a man had
[1:55:59] searched for something for 76 years and
[1:56:02] in 15 minutes a servant of the Lord led
[1:56:05] him into his presence it don't take that
[1:56:08] long years of his life brother Tom he
[1:56:11] had searched for him the sign of the
[1:56:14] Messiah I know when the Messiah come he
[1:56:16] would do these things I heard what the
[1:56:18] scripture says but I've never saw it
[1:56:21] they're looking forth their wrong way
[1:56:23] but it took a servant to lead him into
[1:56:26] his presence brother Mark and the very
[1:56:28] thing that had been sitting in front of
[1:56:30] him all along a hidden thing become
[1:56:33] revealed I pray that that's what happens
[1:56:35] to every one of you this morning said
[1:56:37] we're not living in the days of Jesus
[1:56:40] walking on the shores of Galilee but
[1:56:42] we're living in Le oosa we're Liv living
[1:56:45] in the age of the Rapture we're living
[1:56:46] in the age of Malachi 4 and the age of
[1:56:48] Revelations 10:7 that's the age that
[1:56:50] we're living in and I pray to God that
[1:56:52] you would that would be revealed unto
[1:56:53] you the sign of the Messiah in this age
[1:56:56] that that same Jesus is doing the same
[1:56:59] works and if he done it then brother
[1:57:01] Bobby he's still doing it today to do
[1:57:03] what to give power to the believer that
[1:57:05] you would have a revelation of God's
[1:57:07] word for the hour that you live in and
[1:57:09] you'll be able to stand in the face of
[1:57:11] the devil and be able to confess your
[1:57:13] Revelation and have victory in this hour
[1:57:16] that's the desire of my heart this
[1:57:18] morning how many raise your hand say
[1:57:21] brother mat that's what I want want Lord
[1:57:23] give me enough Revelation that my
[1:57:25] confession would change show me Lord if
[1:57:28] there's something that's hidden Lord
[1:57:29] reveal it unto me isn't it something
[1:57:31] it's always about Revelation say well
[1:57:33] brother Matt I've never saw that before
[1:57:35] when neither had anybody until they saw
[1:57:36] it I never seen that in the scripture
[1:57:39] before well neither did anybody else
[1:57:40] till they saw it the first time but God
[1:57:43] laid it there and there comes a time in
[1:57:45] our life that it's revealed under each
[1:57:46] one of us we're ordained to be Believers
[1:57:49] you're ordained to be in this age you're
[1:57:51] ordained to be here this morning I don't
[1:57:52] believe that you're here by accident I
[1:57:54] don't believe it's a coincidence that
[1:57:55] God brought you here this morning but I
[1:57:57] I believe he brought us in this place to
[1:57:59] see that very sign and to have that
[1:58:02] Revelation and to have a confession that
[1:58:04] would have power over the devil you say
[1:58:06] brother Matt I pray you you'd remember
[1:58:08] me this morning that I'd have that kind
[1:58:10] of a revelation amen Lord seize our
[1:58:12] hands this morning Lord give me a a
[1:58:14] solid Revelation Lord give me something
[1:58:16] sound a foundation that I could stand
[1:58:18] upon this morning as we bow our heads
[1:58:20] gracious Heavenly Father
[1:58:23] Lord I pray Lord this morning God that
[1:58:26] something that would have been said Lord
[1:58:28] that God would be a help to the church
[1:58:32] God knowing that in this hour lord it's
[1:58:34] an hour of great Revelation Lord God
[1:58:37] it's not we a church that's looking to
[1:58:39] days gone by but Lord what we want to
[1:58:42] see is the Jesus of this hour God I
[1:58:45] recognize him Lord as your Prophet would
[1:58:47] speak that he's not some dead God but
[1:58:49] but the resurrection has came again
[1:58:52] the very power of the Resurrection is
[1:58:54] living in the church today Lord I pray
[1:58:56] Lord that that same power be witnessed
[1:58:59] this morning Lord I pray it'd be in the
[1:59:01] heart of every believer Lord I pray you
[1:59:02] would open their hearts and and Reveal
[1:59:04] Your word to them Lord let there be such
[1:59:06] a strength in the revelation God that
[1:59:08] they would be able to confess your word
[1:59:10] Lord they would be able to stand in the
[1:59:12] face of the devil lord whenever he would
[1:59:14] come by and those unbelieving spirits
[1:59:15] and C critical Spirits would come by
[1:59:17] their house they'd be able to stand and
[1:59:19] say but by the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:21] God has given me a revelation to put you
[1:59:23] in your place and you've been exposed in
[1:59:26] this hour God I pray you would secure
[1:59:28] that in every heart God you would open
[1:59:30] their eyes Lord those that are blinded
[1:59:32] Lord that their eyes would be open Lord
[1:59:34] let their heart be open to the word of
[1:59:36] God and let the revelation of the hour
[1:59:38] strike every heart God may we search the
[1:59:40] scriptures Lord Lord may we search our
[1:59:43] hearts and discern truth Lord as a body
[1:59:46] of Believers that we would take our
