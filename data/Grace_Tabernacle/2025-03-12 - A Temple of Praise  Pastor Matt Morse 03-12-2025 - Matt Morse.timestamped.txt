[39:25] amen so let's read uh acts the 17th
[39:27] chapter the 22nd verse the Bible said
[39:29] then Paul stood in the midst of Mars's
[39:31] Hill and he said you men of Athens I
[39:34] perceive that in all things you are too
[39:36] superstitious for as I passed by and
[39:39] beheld your devotions I found an altar
[39:41] with this inscription to the unknown God
[39:44] whom therefore you ignorantly worship
[39:46] Him declare I unto you God that made the
[39:50] world and all things therein seeing that
[39:52] he is the Lord of Heaven and the Earth
[39:55] dwelleth not in temples made with hand
[39:58] neither is he worshiped with men's hands
[40:00] as though he needed anything seeing he
[40:02] giveth to all life and breath and all
[40:05] things and hath made of one blood all
[40:07] nations of men for to dwell on the face
[40:10] of the Earth and hath determined the
[40:12] times before appointed in the bounds of
[40:15] their habitation that they should seek
[40:17] the Lord and H if happily they might
[40:20] feel after him and find him though he be
[40:23] not far from every one of us for in him
[40:26] we live and move and have our being as
[40:29] certain also of your own poets have said
[40:33] for we are also his offspring and I want
[40:36] to speak to you tonight as you take your
[40:38] seats on a Temple of Praise a Temple of
[40:42] Praise now uh here Apostle Paul I know
[40:45] this is a very common uh portion of
[40:47] scripture we have read this many times
[40:49] over the years and uh but we realize
[40:52] that Paul here when he come to this
[40:54] place he was uh on his second missionary
[40:56] journey jne he had arrived in Athens and
[40:59] he was awaiting uh Silas and Timothy to
[41:02] come and join him to continue uh on
[41:04] their missionary trip and uh as he was
[41:06] waiting uh for this here in in Athens
[41:09] here this uh this town that was known
[41:11] for its diversity of philos philosophers
[41:14] and and religions and so here was a uh
[41:17] it was a a great uh town of this nature
[41:20] and and but while he was waiting and
[41:22] maybe he was sitting up in a hotel or
[41:24] wherever Paul was dwelling at but here
[41:26] he was waiting and looking across Athens
[41:29] and he noticed that everywhere he looked
[41:30] there was idolatry when he went to the
[41:32] market there was idolatry in the Market
[41:34] at the at the eating place it was
[41:35] idolatry in the synagogue it was
[41:37] idolatry and I thought here was a man
[41:39] that was an apostle and he was waiting
[41:41] to go on a missionary trip here here he
[41:43] was in here he was in Paul's mode and
[41:45] but in Paul's mode he noticed all the
[41:47] idolatry and so something the Bible says
[41:49] something be to steer at Paul's heart
[41:51] and so he went out into the market and
[41:53] he got to talking to him about Jesus and
[41:55] about the resurrection and and and then
[41:57] he went to the synagogue and the Bible
[41:58] said anybody he could get to talk to him
[42:00] about and Paul would tell him about the
[42:02] Lord and how that he had went and he was
[42:04] crucified and resurrected and you know
[42:06] after a little while in this place as
[42:08] Paul would speak of the Resurrection uh
[42:11] to the men of Athens it it was a strange
[42:13] Doctrine to hear about somebody
[42:15] resurrecting from the dead and and and
[42:17] so as they would hear this they they
[42:19] begin to think about Paul and say well
[42:21] he he maybe he's a man that brings that
[42:23] besets strange doctrines and maybe he's
[42:25] just here to stir up strange things or
[42:27] introduce uh the the these strange
[42:30] things and so they took him up to the
[42:32] mountain of aragos or or or uh in the
[42:35] Greek it was Ari arios pagos which was
[42:38] the hill of Aries I don't know how many
[42:40] ever studied in Greek mythology but in
[42:42] Greek mythology this place of of the
[42:45] hill of Aris was actually uh uh said to
[42:48] be you know Aries which was the god of
[42:50] war in Greek mythologies it was said to
[42:51] be the place that Aris was put on trial
[42:54] because he murdered Poseidon's son
[42:56] remember because was um he had he had
[42:58] done a very foul act and and so in their
[43:01] in their mythology but there was a foul
[43:03] act that had taken place and so he had
[43:04] gone down and murdered him because of
[43:06] the act that he had done and and and so
[43:08] they put him on trial at the hill of
[43:10] Aries and so uh this isit you know
[43:12] through this time this was a great uh
[43:14] place in the land of Athens it was uh uh
[43:17] this this this hill or as the Romans
[43:20] would call it Mars's Hill instead of
[43:21] Aris it was Mars but uh but but this
[43:24] hill was a place that would be put on
[43:26] trial of anybody that had any religious
[43:28] crime and so it was for religious
[43:30] purposes there was a great altar there
[43:32] there was a temple there it was a it was
[43:34] a place so if someone would to come in
[43:37] and and they would commit something that
[43:39] crime based on religion this is where
[43:41] the wise men or the philosophers would
[43:42] take them up to the top of this place to
[43:44] try them and put them on trial after all
[43:46] this is a place where the gods had came
[43:48] and and so it it was a it was a great
[43:51] Temple grounds it was a it was a a a
[43:53] sacred place to the men of Athens and
[43:55] this uh this is the place they took Paul
[43:57] to which would be known as one of the
[43:59] greatest sermons that Paul ever preached
[44:02] it was the AR rapo sermon and so here
[44:05] when Paul would come up here and they
[44:07] would he would walk in I could just see
[44:08] Paul being led to this place and knowing
[44:10] the history of Athens and the history of
[44:13] of of of this mythology and here here
[44:15] Paul being a man that had been looking
[44:17] at all this idolatry and they leading
[44:19] him up on this mountain and and so he
[44:20] goes and he walks past this Altar and it
[44:22] says to the unknown God and all this is
[44:24] steering up in Apostle Paul's heart and
[44:26] here he's like man I'm I'm about to
[44:28] bring a revelation to these folks
[44:30] they're they're missing the reality of
[44:31] what a God really is and here we're
[44:33] talking about a myth and a mythology and
[44:35] a God that that that's never uh that no
[44:38] one's ever had any contact with and and
[44:40] so when Paul gets to this place he
[44:42] begins to speak to them this message and
[44:45] he starts to tell them that the real
[44:46] Temple is a temple that's not B made by
[44:49] the hands of men and so he and he
[44:51] answers the question that God had asked
[44:54] through the prophet Isaiah when he said
[44:55] the heaven is my throne and the Earth is
[44:57] my foot stol but where is the house that
[45:00] you build unto me and where is my place
[45:02] of rest Paul began to answer this
[45:04] question that there is a God and God is
[45:06] looking for a dwelling place and God
[45:08] wants to dwell among his children and
[45:10] God wants to be among his people but God
[45:13] ask where is this place that you're
[45:15] going to build me where's the house that
[45:17] you'll build me where's the place of my
[45:18] rest and you realize that that
[45:20] throughout the Bible since the time that
[45:22] God had asked this very question there's
[45:24] been many temples throughout the
[45:26] scripture we you can read about it in
[45:28] the in in the book of uh of Exodus and
[45:31] Moses when they went out into the
[45:32] Wilderness they built a Tabernacle in
[45:34] the wilderness which was for the purpose
[45:37] of being a temple to God in other words
[45:39] it was the place where God could come
[45:41] and dwell amongst his people but then
[45:43] they built the temple of Solomon
[45:45] remember Solomon built the Great temple
[45:46] then it was torn down and they built
[45:48] another Temple there but but these
[45:50] temples that God made was meant to be a
[45:53] place of worship a temple was a place of
[45:55] sacrifice it was a place to bring praise
[45:57] unto God so the temple of God is a
[46:00] Dwelling Place of the Holy Ghost can I
[46:02] say it like that and so when Paul would
[46:04] begin to speak he would talk about this
[46:06] temple of God and how that there's
[46:08] always been a temple and God had
[46:09] required a place of fellowship with man
[46:12] and Paul said in 1 Corinthians he said
[46:14] but know you not that you are the temple
[46:17] of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in
[46:20] you for If any man defile the temple of
[46:22] God then him shall God destroy for the
[46:24] temple of God is Holy which Temple you
[46:27] are somebody say Amen see you're the
[46:29] temple of God I know sometimes it's hard
[46:31] to come to that place to to to realize
[46:33] that we're a temple of worship or we're
[46:35] a Temple of Praise or a temple of God
[46:38] sometimes it's hard to look at oursel
[46:39] that way because when we look in the
[46:41] mirror we see this flesh and the and the
[46:43] in the failing of it but here Paul says
[46:45] but know you not that you are a temple
[46:47] of God you're the very thing that God
[46:49] had had in his mind the place of worship
[46:52] the the place of fellowship and you know
[46:54] because of the nature of our existence
[46:57] sometimes we are bound with within the
[46:58] framework of our own creation and we're
[47:01] we're limited to be able to see the
[47:02] things of God in this way although
[47:04] although although that there's something
[47:05] that is calling us even brother Mark do
[47:07] you realize that we're living in this
[47:09] world and because we're Bound in this
[47:11] existence but and and there's something
[47:13] calling us into another world but
[47:15] sometimes we just can't can't seem to
[47:17] get out of the one that we're in hello
[47:19] somebody sometimes we can't seem to get
[47:21] past this uh this world that we're in
[47:23] even though there's something that's
[47:24] pulling us and something that is drawing
[47:26] us that's what Peter said he said you
[47:28] are a chosen people that was called out
[47:30] of darkness in other words you've been
[47:32] pulled out of it it's a draw out of it
[47:34] something to bring you into another
[47:37] realm this is what Paul was speaking of
[47:39] he said through faith we understand that
[47:41] the worlds were framed by the word of
[47:44] God now notice he says worlds plural the
[47:46] worlds were framed by the word of God
[47:49] now I don't believe that Paul was
[47:50] speaking of Worlds like there was
[47:52] multiple Earths he wasn't talking about
[47:53] that there's Earth here and Earth there
[47:55] and they were all created by the or
[47:57] framed by the word of God but he wasn't
[47:59] speaking of multiple Earths but he was
[48:00] speaking of a world that you can see and
[48:03] an Unseen World he said see there's
[48:05] worlds a matter of fact Paul would say
[48:07] the things that are seen are not made of
[48:09] things which do appear what a paradox
[48:12] this is it's incredible brother the mark
[48:14] but it's true it's something that no man
[48:16] can explain but it's out of the Realms
[48:18] of the of the knowledge of humanity but
[48:20] yet it's a true thing the things that we
[48:22] see were made made by things that which
[48:25] we cannot see the scen was made by the
[48:27] Unseen in other words the world he said
[48:30] the world was made by the word of God
[48:31] and I got news for you it's the only
[48:33] thing that's keeping the world together
[48:35] is the word of God so the scene was made
[48:37] by the Unseen so what that tells us is
[48:39] that what you can't see is far greater
[48:42] than what you can see so if in this
[48:45] world see we are limited by the
[48:47] boundaries or the framework of this
[48:49] world and so we're limited by our
[48:50] thinking and we're limited by our
[48:52] teaching and the knowledge that we have
[48:54] we're limited by the boundaries of human
[48:56] ability we're limited by the boundaries
[48:58] of our creation but do you realize that
[49:01] though we're limited by these boundaries
[49:03] but beyond those boundaries brother Tom
[49:05] is a greater life this is what Paul is
[49:08] preaching about that here there's a
[49:09] boundary this is all you can see this is
[49:11] why you don't know what's going on but
[49:13] beyond this there's something that is
[49:15] calling you to a greater life beyond
[49:17] this there's another life it's something
[49:19] outside that's calling you it's a
[49:21] greater life a greater world it's a
[49:23] greater creation brother Mark than what
[49:25] we're than what we face in this life and
[49:27] it's calling you to this other world you
[49:29] know I I think about an unborn child and
[49:33] how he was in how he's in the womb of
[49:35] his mother and how I know the world
[49:37] today make up all this nonsense about
[49:39] it's not not alive and all this stuff
[49:41] until a baby's born but that's I'm not
[49:43] going to get into it but that's a lie of
[49:44] the devil the reality is is that you can
[49:47] take a child in the womb of its mother
[49:48] and you know in five weeks from the time
[49:51] of its conception the neural tube in a
[49:53] child is formed that's where his brain
[49:55] and his spinal cord comes from and here
[49:57] in the first five weeks this begins to
[49:59] form in the womb of a mother and then in
[50:02] in the sixth week he develops a
[50:04] heartbeat in the in in in the eighth
[50:06] week then uh the sensory receptors on
[50:09] his face and their mouth and and all of
[50:11] that begins to be developed where a
[50:13] child in just in just eight weeks from
[50:15] the time of conception can start feeling
[50:17] things and then those sensory uh those
[50:19] sensory receptors that they go from the
[50:20] mouth and then into the hands and the
[50:22] feet and they start feeling little
[50:24] things and and then after a few weeks 16
[50:27] weeks he can hear sounds 18 weeks they
[50:29] start to respond to the sounds of an
[50:31] outside world in 20 weeks they hear and
[50:35] they begin to react to familiar sounds
[50:37] within 24 weeks a child in the womb is
[50:39] reacting to specific voices so it knows
[50:42] it's it's able to differentiate the
[50:44] voice of a mother and the voice of a
[50:46] father or The Voice or something that
[50:49] they come in C in just 24 weeks even in
[50:51] their womb they react to these specific
[50:53] voices and then they begin to feel the
[50:56] effects of the outside world they can
[50:58] feel pain they react to pain they move
[51:01] uh they they they move and they're
[51:03] affected by an outside world you masas
[51:04] that's ever carryed babies could testify
[51:06] that when you get in a certain position
[51:08] and baby gets uncomfortable they begin
[51:10] to move why they're jostling for
[51:11] position they're they're trying to
[51:13] trying to make some room because they
[51:14] feel the effects of an outside world
[51:17] they they hear sounds of an outside
[51:18] world they they react to an outside
[51:21] world they move because of an outside
[51:23] world but even though they feel the
[51:24] effects of an outside world and even
[51:26] even though they hear sounds of an
[51:28] outside world still yet they are bound
[51:30] by their habitation so here they want to
[51:33] move and maybe they're trying to get
[51:35] comfortable but because of the
[51:36] boundaries of their habitation they
[51:38] can't move their hands can't move very
[51:40] far their feet can't move I know some of
[51:42] y'all masas are are are carrying some of
[51:44] them around right now I know Vanna bless
[51:45] her heart she's got two at 24 weeks they
[51:47] started a fight club in there I'm sure
[51:49] but the they're trying to trying trying
[51:51] to see who's going to be the best but
[51:53] she's got she's got twins coming but but
[51:55] but but they to this place that they're
[51:57] Bound by habitation and and so it don't
[52:00] matter how uncomfortable it is or maybe
[52:02] there's something that they hear there's
[52:03] something that's calling them there's
[52:05] something that that that that caused
[52:06] them to be to begin to react but they
[52:08] really don't know what to do with it
[52:10] they don't have the knowledge of it yet
[52:12] they're still bound up in darkness in
[52:13] the womb of their mother Bound by the
[52:15] limits of habitation but then all of a
[52:17] sudden they come to a place of a birth
[52:20] oh Hallelujah and when they come to a
[52:22] birth Brother David what happens is that
[52:24] Unseen World becomes reality that Unseen
[52:28] World it comes alive and now those same
[52:30] sounds have images and th those muffled
[52:33] voices become clear and although they
[52:35] may not understand it all but I know
[52:37] this that a newborn baby certainly sees
[52:40] things differently than it did when it
[52:41] was in the womb of its mother and let me
[52:43] tell you what else its arms and its legs
[52:46] have a little more freedom it's fre it
[52:48] moves out a little more it starts
[52:49] pinching at your face and those little
[52:51] fingernails they Claw at you and grab
[52:53] your grab your nose and and you why
[52:55] because they can move a little bit more
[52:56] freely cuz they're outside of the
[52:58] boundaries of their former habitation
[53:00] you me tell you what happens brother
[53:02] tomorrow they begin to feed and they
[53:03] grow and the more they eat the more they
[53:05] grow they gain knowledge they start to
[53:07] crawl then to walk then to run unless it
[53:10] was Malachi he scoot crawl or scoot
[53:12] walked and ran but but but they they
[53:14] they all they're growing and eating and
[53:16] feeding and and for the first six months
[53:18] you're trying to to teach them the
[53:20] language you're you're trying to teach
[53:21] them how to speak and do you realize in
[53:23] the my may as well preach anyway but do
[53:25] you realize in the first few years of a
[53:27] child's life that you can teach them any
[53:29] language and they they tell you if you
[53:30] want to have a child that learns several
[53:32] languages the best time to do it is when
[53:33] they're a baby that they can learn the
[53:35] language I thought why why why in the
[53:37] world will we hide it from them what we
[53:39] believe and why will we hide it from
[53:40] them and say Well they're not big enough
[53:42] for it so we need to scale the message
[53:44] down where it's something that that they
[53:45] can comprehend but I say if we're going
[53:47] to learn the language let's go ahead and
[53:48] learn the language you're Sons and
[53:50] Daughters of God you've been bought by
[53:52] the blood of Jesus Christ you were
[53:53] bought into this world called of God
[53:55] sent here for a purpose they begin to
[53:58] learn the language and they get and as
[54:00] they you know you spend six months
[54:02] trying to teach a kid to say his first
[54:03] word spend the next 18 years trying to
[54:06] get it to quit
[54:07] talking but but you're trying to they're
[54:09] they're growing you realize that not
[54:12] that that you know it's not that they
[54:13] weren't living before but Mar they were
[54:15] very much alive everything we know about
[54:17] Humanity says that child was alive in
[54:19] the womb but it was confined by a
[54:22] boundary but a birth takes you beyond
[54:25] the boundary that can find you it brings
[54:28] you into a whole new world a world that
[54:31] is beyond the limitations of our former
[54:34] existence it's what a birth does it
[54:36] brings you oh my you remember you
[54:37] remember the story about the farmer that
[54:39] went up in the mountains but the market
[54:41] came in there and he found that old
[54:42] Eagle egg he took it down he said I
[54:44] think I'll just take this and put it at
[54:45] my farm and he put it down there in the
[54:47] in the in the the Barnard in the chicken
[54:50] ceop after a little while that little
[54:52] that little egg hatches and here that
[54:54] little Eagle hops out of there with all
[54:55] his little Breen sister chickens and my
[54:57] they they they went hopping around the
[54:59] Barnard and you know what he did brother
[55:00] Mark he ate the same stuff they ate and
[55:03] he went around the Barnard and whatever
[55:04] stuff they threw out on the ground he
[55:06] would eat it right off the ground he
[55:07] didn't care because after all he was a
[55:09] chicken he was hashed under a chicken he
[55:11] walked around with chickens and you know
[55:12] but you know after a little while he
[55:14] lost the appetite for that barnyard food
[55:17] see he was raised up in a barnyard
[55:19] atmosphere you may as well preach it he
[55:20] was raised up in a barnyard atmosphere
[55:22] but after a little while the Barnyard
[55:24] food wasn't good enough for him and so
[55:26] he begin to have it his pallet begin to
[55:28] change he had a desire for something
[55:30] greater he he had a desire for meat and
[55:32] maybe his Mama come out there Mama chick
[55:34] and say you know why why won't you eat
[55:35] on that no more well I just don't have
[55:37] an appetite for it anymore well it ought
[55:39] to be good enough it used to be good
[55:40] enough for you you're getting too big
[55:42] lately all a sudden it ain't good enough
[55:44] for you you know who you think you are
[55:45] maybe you're trying to be too spiritual
[55:47] and you're you're trying to be too this
[55:49] because it ain't good enough for you but
[55:51] something on the inside of him said I
[55:52] got to have meat and I may not can eat
[55:54] on this chicken food any longer matter
[55:56] of fact brothers and sisters got to
[55:58] looking pretty good to him you know they
[56:00] cuz his appetite begin to change and
[56:02] then one day that mother Eagle comes
[56:04] flying over the Barnyard and she begins
[56:06] to cry out and when she cries out
[56:09] something on the inside of that eagle
[56:10] all of a sudden he begin to realized
[56:12] that that's why I've never fit in where
[56:14] I was born that's why I never felt like
[56:16] I was a part you know because something
[56:18] was drawing him whenever the mother
[56:20] Eagle begin to call and oh all the
[56:22] chickens you know what happens when Mama
[56:23] Eagle calls the chicken scatter back
[56:25] into the chicken they went to hide and
[56:27] duck back in there where nobody could
[56:28] see them but out on the out in the front
[56:30] yard here the eagle was looking to see
[56:32] where the scream was coming from and by
[56:34] the chickens was running he went after
[56:36] oh I could just see his mama coming out
[56:38] there hauling at him drumstick get back
[56:40] in here you're you're going to get ate
[56:41] out there why you about you got to come
[56:43] back but something on the inside of him
[56:46] I can't I gave him a name but something
[56:47] on the inside of him said I'm not a
[56:49] chicken something on the inside of him
[56:52] heard a call it was a and it be to
[56:55] respond
[56:56] to the the the the call that was being
[56:58] made and he stepped out and after he he
[57:01] heard it for a little while he jumped up
[57:02] on the rail got up on the top of the
[57:04] fence and hear that Mama Eagle was
[57:06] saying just let hold them wings out and
[57:08] let the wind soore underneath them won't
[57:10] you feel don't you notice look at them
[57:12] chicken wings they don't look like your
[57:13] wings but hold them out there and see
[57:15] what happens and oh that eagle begin to
[57:17] spread his wings and he flapped a few
[57:19] flats and before long he was soaring in
[57:21] the heavens but Mark you know what
[57:23] happened he had a changeing atmosphere
[57:26] he came out of the Barnyard and went
[57:28] flying to where he was moving from one
[57:30] atmosphere into another you see he was
[57:33] limited by the boundaries of his
[57:34] habitation until he heard a call that
[57:37] said you wasn't made for a barnyard you
[57:39] ain't made for a chicken pin but you're
[57:41] made to soar in the heavens and he heard
[57:44] the call no longer limited by the
[57:46] boundaries but God has given me
[57:48] something that could take me out of this
[57:50] atmosphere and put me into another oh my
[57:52] can you realize that even the day he was
[57:55] born he was equipped with what it would
[57:56] take to take him into a higher high the
[57:59] day he was born he was equipped with
[58:01] what would sore into another atmosphere
[58:04] but he came he had to come to a place of
[58:06] realizing that he would not he wasn't
[58:07] supposed to be down there then he that's
[58:10] what that was for that's why I never fit
[58:12] in that's why my appetite's the way it
[58:14] is that's what them big old ugly Wings
[58:16] is for that's why I have a beak like
[58:18] that I'm a meat
[58:20] eater that's why I had eye trouble all
[58:22] the time every time he look you know the
[58:24] the eyes of an egro are so much much
[58:26] different than a chicken that's why his
[58:28] eyes he was sitting there on the ground
[58:29] they're they're looking at all them
[58:30] little them little bugs and stuff they
[58:32] can focus right on them mom I'm having
[58:33] trouble I my eyes they're troubled I
[58:36] can't see the bugs but I can see a far
[58:39] off finally he just had to go back and
[58:41] tell her I've got eye trouble you do
[58:44] yeah I can't see myself being a chicken
[58:48] anymore I'm an
[58:50] eagle said see he moved into another
[58:53] atmosphere said that's the way it is
[58:55] with us
[58:56] attributes of God In seed form born and
[58:59] raised in the world but one day you get
[59:01] in the right atmosphere and then you
[59:03] come to life you realize that I I you
[59:07] you know that men that we live in three
[59:09] dimensions this is a seven there's seven
[59:11] dimensions but only three of them that
[59:12] we live in you think about man the we
[59:15] live in the dimensions of light and
[59:17] matter and time but says see see in
[59:20] showed how that these were the
[59:21] dimensions we live and this Corporal
[59:23] body that we live in is in contact with
[59:25] those three Dimension see taste feel
[59:27] smelling here that contact light
[59:29] mattering time we see it's it's things
[59:31] that we can see and we can affect but
[59:33] even though we don't see it even science
[59:36] today shows us that there's a dimension
[59:39] greater than the dimensions that we can
[59:40] see the ones that we can see and taste
[59:43] and feel you know when I was a young
[59:45] when I was just a young man I remember
[59:46] when they had the cups and they' put a
[59:48] string on a cup and you'd put it out
[59:49] there in the fort with your buddy and
[59:51] he'd have the other cup and you could
[59:52] talk to him and he could talk back and
[59:54] you know you could kind of understand
[59:56] understand it cuz it kind well the
[59:57] vibration of your voice it followed down
[59:59] the string and although that's still
[1:00:00] incomprehensible but nevertheless it
[1:00:02] follow it follows down the string and
[1:00:05] and your buddy could hear what you're
[1:00:06] saying in the cup and if he couldn't
[1:00:07] hear you he'd say turn it up and you'd
[1:00:09] just turn it up and then he could hear
[1:00:11] what you were saying out there we done
[1:00:12] done this all the time but after a
[1:00:14] little while then we you know you go in
[1:00:15] the house mama's got a a phone and you
[1:00:18] you know you if you you talk on it and
[1:00:20] if you want to talk to one of your
[1:00:21] friends privately we had about a 50ft
[1:00:23] cord extension on our phone so we could
[1:00:25] go we thought we we were living it up we
[1:00:26] can go in any room in the house with our
[1:00:28] phone you know cuz we had that long
[1:00:29] extension you know and and I didn't take
[1:00:31] it out my bedroom window I could talk
[1:00:33] out on there because it had the core but
[1:00:34] even in that you would think that maybe
[1:00:37] the sound somehow is traveling through
[1:00:39] these wires and you know even in in
[1:00:41] elementary you may not understand it but
[1:00:43] you know you could kind of get it
[1:00:45] because sounds after all it's traveling
[1:00:47] through the cord so somehow they can
[1:00:48] hear it on the other end because it's
[1:00:49] going through the court but then after a
[1:00:52] little while we got in high school and
[1:00:53] all of a sudden then they came out with
[1:00:55] wireless cell phones and now they're
[1:00:57] talking to people that lived in other
[1:00:59] states and other countries and here when
[1:01:01] You' take that phone and you would talk
[1:01:03] to somebody it's still it still
[1:01:04] fascinates me of how that you can say a
[1:01:07] word to on on this end of a phone and
[1:01:09] that word that you cannot see it leave
[1:01:12] but it goes to a satellite that's up in
[1:01:14] there outside of this atmosphere and
[1:01:15] that satellite sends it back down to a
[1:01:18] receiver that another person has and
[1:01:19] they hear it the exact same way that you
[1:01:22] said it see even science shows it that
[1:01:24] there's an unseen there's something
[1:01:26] unseen but it's traveling it's always
[1:01:28] been here but science has just came over
[1:01:31] the last few years in contact that we
[1:01:33] could contact with this other dimension
[1:01:35] so but says see that's the fourth
[1:01:37] dimension now now we we know that we
[1:01:39] don't understand the mechanics of it but
[1:01:41] science proved to us that there was a
[1:01:43] dimension outside of what we could see
[1:01:45] we use it every day it's even far
[1:01:47] greater today to think that you could
[1:01:48] take images I you would never dream that
[1:01:50] you could take an image and send a
[1:01:52] picture and it would bounce off a
[1:01:53] satellite and the picture would land in
[1:01:54] somebody else's purse I mean you it's
[1:01:57] hard to understand brother Mark but
[1:01:59] science has tapped into another
[1:02:01] dimension and so here this is traveling
[1:02:03] they figured out how to send and how to
[1:02:05] receive through that it's going through
[1:02:06] this room right now do you realize it
[1:02:08] you can't see it but it's I know you've
[1:02:10] heard this illustration many times but
[1:02:11] it's going through this room right now
[1:02:13] so we live in a dimensional world even
[1:02:15] even on further in The Fifth Dimension
[1:02:17] it was the place where I may I may as
[1:02:20] well may as well tell them all while
[1:02:21] we're here but but The Fifth Dimension
[1:02:23] it was the place where a sinner that's
[1:02:25] not that never uh that or an unbeliever
[1:02:27] goes after he dies and and and and he
[1:02:29] would go to this place that he was he
[1:02:31] was an unconverted man he would go to
[1:02:33] this place in The Fifth Dimension and
[1:02:35] brother man would say it was a place
[1:02:36] that were where where they couldn't come
[1:02:38] back to the Earth because their their
[1:02:40] time was spent upon the Earth but they
[1:02:42] couldn't go into the presence of God
[1:02:43] because they would have to go through
[1:02:45] judgment first so here because they were
[1:02:47] unconverted they go into this place of
[1:02:49] The Fifth Dimension he said honestly
[1:02:51] it's like a nightmare it's like when you
[1:02:52] when you can't be asleep and you're not
[1:02:54] awake and you're constantly and you're
[1:02:56] in a great Nightmare and it's a terrible
[1:02:58] way but that's where they spend the time
[1:03:00] until the time of Resurrection they
[1:03:02] spend their life in a nightmare and
[1:03:03] unconverted man but then a Christian
[1:03:05] when a Christian dies he goes into the
[1:03:07] sixth Dimension which is which is a
[1:03:09] place that is right under the altar of
[1:03:11] God under the presence of God and and
[1:03:13] and and that's where he lays at rest
[1:03:15] until the time until the until the time
[1:03:17] of of his coming and so matter of fact
[1:03:19] brother R would say when he had the when
[1:03:21] he went beyond the curtain of time he
[1:03:22] said I believe that's where I was in the
[1:03:24] sixth Dimension and I I was looking back
[1:03:26] at my own body and then of course the
[1:03:28] seventh Dimension is the place where God
[1:03:30] is so you see here we are a dimensional
[1:03:33] people and there we're living in
[1:03:35] Dimensions but we can't always see the
[1:03:37] dimensions that's going on around us we
[1:03:39] can't see the radio waves we can't even
[1:03:41] see the fourth dimension our little
[1:03:42] frail human bodies can't see past the
[1:03:45] first three but what's being affected by
[1:03:47] our own senses or our natural senses but
[1:03:49] here the prophet of God would come and
[1:03:51] preach a super sense and preach about
[1:03:53] faith being another sense and here that
[1:03:55] God has given us a sense to contact
[1:03:58] another world or contact another realm
[1:04:00] just like we have radio waves that can
[1:04:02] contact in the fourth dimension here God
[1:04:04] has given us a way called Faith to be
[1:04:06] able to contact that other dimension
[1:04:08] where God is that's that's how he deals
[1:04:10] with us and let me let me tell you what
[1:04:12] it is it's an unseen that's calling us
[1:04:14] into another atmosphere and I've got
[1:04:16] news for you tonight it ain't up in the
[1:04:17] cloud somewhere it ain't in outer space
[1:04:20] it's just the influence of another
[1:04:21] dimension right here where we stand
[1:04:23] that's why oh let me tell you what it is
[1:04:25] I I I I remember my my my young son one
[1:04:27] day when I was I was actually uh in a
[1:04:29] shopping mall whenever whenever the lord
[1:04:31] gave me this Revelation out of the mouth
[1:04:33] of a 5-year-old child here I was sitting
[1:04:35] in the in in the mall we was we was gone
[1:04:37] preaching and we were walking in the
[1:04:39] mall spending time between the the the
[1:04:41] services or whatever and and here uh
[1:04:43] Salem goes up and there's there's a
[1:04:45] place in the mall that sew doors and so
[1:04:47] they had the doors just sitting there on
[1:04:48] display and so he was going opening the
[1:04:51] door walking through shutting the door
[1:04:52] opening the door walking through
[1:04:54] shutting the door I'm just sitting on
[1:04:55] the bench talking on the phone and
[1:04:56] watched them go in and out you know
[1:04:57] through this door back and forth playing
[1:04:59] with it he said dad you got to come you
[1:05:00] got to come and try this so I went over
[1:05:03] there said okay buddy let's do it let's
[1:05:05] go through I said what are we doing he
[1:05:06] said you got to go through and so he
[1:05:08] opens the door I said but what is it he
[1:05:09] said it's a dimension Ator I said well
[1:05:12] what's that he said well when you walk
[1:05:13] through you're going to be in another
[1:05:15] dimension and I thought my out of the
[1:05:17] mouth of a child something that seems so
[1:05:20] far-fetched that here he would say just
[1:05:24] step through and you're in another
[1:05:26] dimension I thought Lord isn't that the
[1:05:27] way it is that even while you're sitting
[1:05:30] in your seat and all the things that are
[1:05:32] going on around you it ain't some place
[1:05:34] that you have to go out somewhere to be
[1:05:35] able to find God maybe you're sitting at
[1:05:37] home and going through something or in
[1:05:39] the car riding but all it is is a step
[1:05:41] into out of one dimension into another
[1:05:44] said see he's calling us into another
[1:05:46] atmosphere this is the call of God but
[1:05:48] remember said that's what he he what he
[1:05:49] wants is to get us into that right
[1:05:51] atmosphere he said see he knew who we
[1:05:53] were in the beginning some million years
[1:05:55] years ago that God knew who you were
[1:05:57] whenever he he he he said in the
[1:05:59] beginning that you're going to be my
[1:06:00] servant and here you was born in sin and
[1:06:03] you was shaped in iniquity and here
[1:06:04] because you were Immortal and maybe
[1:06:06] something happened you got a little
[1:06:08] religious feeling and you went down toh
[1:06:09] to a church somewhere but but then all
[1:06:12] of a sudden you get under the atmosphere
[1:06:14] of God one time and you're bound to
[1:06:16] recognize who your father is he said
[1:06:19] just like that eagle recognized who his
[1:06:21] mother was you got to realize it because
[1:06:23] he's your father see he's God's
[1:06:25] attribute that's become a word speaking
[1:06:27] of you you're God's attribute that's
[1:06:28] become a word spoken and then the Holy
[1:06:31] Spirit seeks that word out so God spoke
[1:06:33] a word you are you the attribute of God
[1:06:35] he spoke it which was you you came into
[1:06:38] existence and here then God comes by the
[1:06:40] power of the Holy Ghost when you're born
[1:06:42] into this world the holy spirit's
[1:06:43] brooding over the Earth he's finding
[1:06:45] that attribute of God that is born into
[1:06:47] this world shaped in sin and all and
[1:06:49] speaking lies and all these things that
[1:06:51] said about a a newborn birth but here
[1:06:54] when the Holy Spirit comes he begin to
[1:06:55] draw him and he's calling him or her to
[1:06:58] give them everlasting life he said and
[1:07:00] he brings them into the presence of God
[1:07:02] and God's word so what are they doing
[1:07:04] they're growing in the atmosphere of God
[1:07:07] and brother Mark what happens is our
[1:07:08] expectations begin to change because
[1:07:10] we're in another atmosphere he said
[1:07:12] that's what we need today is we need a
[1:07:13] holy ghost atmosphere an atmosphere
[1:07:16] where the power of God is moving in one
[1:07:18] Accord in one place gathered together
[1:07:20] under an atmosphere expecting God to
[1:07:23] move down and do signs and wonders let's
[1:07:25] move oursel out up into that bracket
[1:07:28] step up and faith and move out of these
[1:07:30] three dimensions up into the next ones
[1:07:33] it's a call of God to his children to
[1:07:35] live in a higher Place Another
[1:07:38] atmosphere we've been called into an
[1:07:40] atmosphere where the seed of God can be
[1:07:42] manifested you say a seed well certainly
[1:07:44] you realize every living thing it
[1:07:46] started in seed form here in the in the
[1:07:49] Book of Genesis says see 6,000 years he
[1:07:52] had planted all these wonderful seeds
[1:07:54] and everything was perfect it was good
[1:07:55] he commanded each one of those seeds
[1:07:57] that they would transform themselves
[1:07:58] into the plant of which kind of a life
[1:08:00] that the word of God had spoken in them
[1:08:02] should be so if it was an oak tree it
[1:08:04] would bring forth an oak if it was a
[1:08:06] palm tree it would bring forth a palm do
[1:08:08] you realize it's no different from for
[1:08:09] God to gr an oak tree it is to create a
[1:08:12] man it ain't no harder for God to create
[1:08:15] a a plan or to create a man it's
[1:08:17] biology here he said see so if it's an
[1:08:19] oak tree he brought forth an oak a palm
[1:08:21] brought forth a palm because the great
[1:08:23] Creator had just sent forth his word
[1:08:26] word and the word seed was there before
[1:08:29] the real seed was ever formed and then
[1:08:32] the word formed the seed and he made the
[1:08:35] world out of things which does not
[1:08:36] appear he made the world by his word he
[1:08:39] spoke everything into existence see
[1:08:41] that's why there's power in Prophecy
[1:08:44] that's why there's power in the word of
[1:08:46] God that's why there's power in the
[1:08:47] preaching of the word because the word
[1:08:49] forms seeds hello the word forms seeds
[1:08:53] it takes the word to form it it takes
[1:08:55] the word word to Quicken it it takes the
[1:08:57] word to water it it takes the word to
[1:08:59] bring it to life it takes the word for
[1:09:01] it to manifest itself it takes the word
[1:09:03] to resurrect it in the end it's the word
[1:09:05] of God that's in control all the time
[1:09:08] that's why this this this new believer
[1:09:10] or True Believer he's never satisfied
[1:09:13] with his old life he's never he's never
[1:09:15] satisfied with it because there's always
[1:09:17] something that is drawing him to a
[1:09:19] higher Place how many testify about that
[1:09:21] why you never satisfied in the world
[1:09:24] brother Jared tell us why you were never
[1:09:25] satisfied in in in the old life that you
[1:09:28] come out of why why was your family
[1:09:30] Never Satisfied in that place because
[1:09:31] there was something calling you you know
[1:09:33] I used to wonder that I used to look
[1:09:35] around and say well these other people
[1:09:36] they live out in the world and they seem
[1:09:38] to be happy as they can be they got
[1:09:40] millions of dollars they got helicopters
[1:09:41] I wish I had a helicopter they they have
[1:09:43] all these nice things how you they they
[1:09:45] seem to be happy but I was never
[1:09:47] satisfied no matter what I had you know
[1:09:50] why because something in you won't allow
[1:09:52] you to be satisfied with the world you
[1:09:54] can't you can't quench it with money you
[1:09:56] could give yourself a billion dollars
[1:09:57] you'd want a billion more you'd never
[1:09:59] end and you'd never be satisfied with it
[1:10:01] if you're not satisfied with this world
[1:10:03] you'll never be satisfied this this
[1:10:04] world no matter how much of the world
[1:10:06] you can get it'll never satisfy you it C
[1:10:09] it takes something else so see it's a
[1:10:11] it's a higher calling something drawing
[1:10:13] us to a higher place and see most of the
[1:10:17] time when people think of that well if
[1:10:18] I'm being draw to a higher Place well
[1:10:20] then you know why is it so hard but just
[1:10:22] because there there's a call in your
[1:10:24] life for a with draw doesn't mean that
[1:10:26] there's not a hindrance matter of fact
[1:10:28] it's the exact opposite see to pull
[1:10:30] means to exert a force on something to
[1:10:32] bring it unto oneself that's what pull
[1:10:35] means so a draw it's to bring it to
[1:10:37] oneself in other words you couldn't have
[1:10:39] a pull if there wasn't a resistance you
[1:10:42] couldn't have a draw if there wasn't a
[1:10:43] resistance there would be there would be
[1:10:45] no there would be no it wouldn't be a
[1:10:46] pull it would just it would just move
[1:10:47] that way but because there is a
[1:10:49] resistance that's the need of a pull see
[1:10:51] so but whenever God's pulling on you and
[1:10:53] there's resistance and here he's tugging
[1:10:55] at your heart and there's a hindrance I
[1:10:57] may as well preach there but but there's
[1:10:59] a hindrance there's things that are
[1:11:00] getting in your way all it just seems
[1:11:01] like all the way down the road you know
[1:11:03] God's pulling on you you're and every
[1:11:04] time he's pulling on you you keep
[1:11:06] bumping into one thing or another why
[1:11:07] because there's a pull on your life and
[1:11:09] and just because there's a pull don't
[1:11:11] mean there's hindrances there there's
[1:11:12] many hindrances there's always a
[1:11:14] hindrance that's why God has to pull us
[1:11:17] you remember with the sanan woman when
[1:11:18] she went to meet Jesus here she had a
[1:11:20] daughter that was dying of epilepsy and
[1:11:22] all these fists brother Mark when she
[1:11:24] went to find Jesus every time she turned
[1:11:26] there was another hindrance here was
[1:11:28] somebody you know you're a Greek woman
[1:11:29] you're going to meet a Jewish man why
[1:11:31] you can't have no part to do with the
[1:11:32] Jews but you know what she didn't let
[1:11:34] the hindrance stop her she kept on
[1:11:36] walking another another step maybe she
[1:11:38] went around the corner they said when
[1:11:39] you get to meet him he's not going to be
[1:11:40] able to heal your child anyway but you
[1:11:42] know what she did she went right around
[1:11:44] the hindrance and took another step you
[1:11:45] know after all the days of Miracles has
[1:11:47] passed and how can you receive healing
[1:11:49] all that's over you know what she did
[1:11:51] she stepped right around it and she took
[1:11:53] another step it didn't matter what
[1:11:54] hindrance came came her way there was a
[1:11:56] pull that was bringing her to Jesus
[1:11:58] Christ but said it was a pull in her
[1:12:01] that was causing her to come to him it
[1:12:03] didn't she didn't place it there it was
[1:12:05] something in her faith that caused her
[1:12:07] to believe Beyond her own ability it was
[1:12:09] something in the Unseen that looked
[1:12:11] beyond the scene thing that said if I
[1:12:13] could ever get to Jesus then my daughter
[1:12:15] would receive her healing he said she
[1:12:18] went past every crit oh friends don't
[1:12:19] you realize we got critics today your
[1:12:21] family they might forsake you they may
[1:12:23] tell you you're going to be an outcast
[1:12:25] if you live that kind of life but let me
[1:12:26] tell you what if you get all the way to
[1:12:28] him and it don't even work anyway what
[1:12:30] if you put forth all your effort and
[1:12:32] down the road you can't even serve God
[1:12:34] what if you fall right back on your face
[1:12:36] again it's somebody trying to hinder you
[1:12:38] from getting to the place that God wants
[1:12:40] you to be but he said it didn't matter
[1:12:42] cuz something was pulling her to Jesus I
[1:12:45] say it don't matter what hindrance
[1:12:47] stands in our way there's something
[1:12:49] that's drawn us oh don't don't matter I
[1:12:51] say let the hindrance come there's no
[1:12:53] hindrance that'll ever prevail against
[1:12:55] the Son of God that's being drawn to his
[1:12:58] maker there's a pull in our life that is
[1:13:01] pulling us to God he said she she had
[1:13:03] many hindrances he said but her faith
[1:13:05] didn't have any Glory she had many
[1:13:08] hindrances but her faith didn't have any
[1:13:10] cuz Faith knows no hindrance you may
[1:13:13] have hindrances but if you got faith
[1:13:15] then it knows no defeat there's no
[1:13:17] hindrance that can stand in the way of
[1:13:20] Faith he said oh people if you could get
[1:13:21] a hold of that in your heart and that
[1:13:23] God is here to give you the desire of
[1:13:25] your heart and he'll meet and you will
[1:13:27] meet his conditions that nothing can
[1:13:29] stand in your way you said what
[1:13:31] condition he wants a sacrifice that is
[1:13:34] acceptable to God isn't that the
[1:13:37] condition that he made in the beginning
[1:13:38] you remember Cain and Abel they made
[1:13:40] sacrifices to be acceptable to God they
[1:13:42] wanted a meeting place with God Cain
[1:13:44] made one Abel made one God accepted
[1:13:47] Abel's and he rejected Cain's you
[1:13:49] realize that here what God shows us is
[1:13:52] that for a sacrifice has to meet a
[1:13:53] requirement in order for God to accept
[1:13:55] it right so here from the very beginning
[1:13:58] you realize that not they weren't all
[1:13:59] accepted by God when God came down in
[1:14:01] the garden here after the fall that took
[1:14:03] place in the garden that God went down
[1:14:05] and in this in the the condition that
[1:14:08] that man was in that here that God went
[1:14:10] down and he took a lamb and he slew the
[1:14:12] Lamb on their behalf and God actually
[1:14:15] set something in place that that to show
[1:14:18] that here was a meeting place with God
[1:14:20] and it was carried on through through
[1:14:22] Adam and Eve and it was taught to their
[1:14:24] children and and because of the
[1:14:25] Revelation that Abel had it caused him
[1:14:28] to go and sacrifice a lamb rather than
[1:14:30] sacrifice that that Cain made remember
[1:14:32] he went out made a beautiful Altar and
[1:14:35] and he prepared it in just such a way
[1:14:37] and I know that that's good enough for
[1:14:38] God to accept after all it's it's the
[1:14:40] work of my hands you know I I I I sure I
[1:14:43] raised all those crops myself and I made
[1:14:45] the best plants I could and he put it
[1:14:46] all out there on the altar so that God
[1:14:48] would accept it but you know what
[1:14:49] brother Mark it wasn't good enough for
[1:14:51] God but Abel he took a lamb and he tied
[1:14:53] an old rope around his neck like a grap
[1:14:55] Vine and he drug it down to an altar and
[1:14:57] that poor little lamb crying and
[1:14:59] bleeding out if one of us was looking at
[1:15:01] it from the outside you would wonder
[1:15:03] well you know that that why wouldn't God
[1:15:05] accept this one after all that was what
[1:15:06] an ugly sacrifice that it was but he
[1:15:08] drug it out there and took it and laid
[1:15:10] it upon an altar and took an old Flint
[1:15:12] Rock and he beat at its neck until the
[1:15:14] blood was peeling out everywhere and
[1:15:16] when God looked down upon Abel's
[1:15:18] sacrifice it was pleasing unto God and
[1:15:22] God accepted his sacrifice because that
[1:15:23] was the standard that God had said but
[1:15:26] said see that's what God done he
[1:15:28] provided a meeting place with man he
[1:15:30] said there's only one place that God
[1:15:31] will ever fellowship with man and that's
[1:15:33] under the blood of the sacrifice he will
[1:15:35] never meet with a man nowhere else but
[1:15:38] but under the blood and when you turn
[1:15:39] the blood down your meeting place with
[1:15:41] God has been taken away I love this cuz
[1:15:43] God has to have an acceptable sacrifice
[1:15:45] he said but notice where you'll find it
[1:15:47] he made his decision in the Garden of
[1:15:48] Eden man would only worship him under
[1:15:50] the shed blood of the sacrifice and
[1:15:52] that's the only place that God ever met
[1:15:54] with man then and it's the only place he
[1:15:56] meets with man today is under the shed
[1:15:58] blood of the sacrifice it don't matter
[1:16:00] what you are it don't matter where you
[1:16:01] come from if you come from a Methodist
[1:16:03] or Baptist or or Pentecost or
[1:16:05] Presbyterian he said you can forget all
[1:16:07] your differences or whatever it might be
[1:16:09] but if you will come under the shed
[1:16:11] blood God will meet both of us there
[1:16:14] that's where we can all meet in
[1:16:15] Fellowship on the same grounds it's
[1:16:17] under the shed blood of Jesus Christ
[1:16:19] under the shed the bleeding word of God
[1:16:21] this is the place or the dwelling place
[1:16:23] or meeting place of God he said he won't
[1:16:25] meet you because you're a Methodist he
[1:16:27] won't meet you because you're a
[1:16:28] Pentecostal he won't can I just say it
[1:16:30] like this he won't meet you because you
[1:16:31] go to Grace Tabernacle he won't meet you
[1:16:33] because you pay more en TI than the next
[1:16:35] guy he won't meet you cuz you cuz you
[1:16:37] because you're the you're the best ker
[1:16:38] you're there the most that's not the
[1:16:40] grounds that God is meeting us on
[1:16:42] although we're rewarded for all that we
[1:16:43] do but that ain't the meeting place with
[1:16:45] God he said the meeting place he'll meet
[1:16:48] with you is under one condition and
[1:16:49] that's under the shed blood when your
[1:16:51] sins have been confessed and expelled in
[1:16:54] his presence by the blood and the blood
[1:16:56] is always before him and therefore he
[1:16:58] can only see you through that shed blood
[1:17:01] that's the only way your sacrifice has
[1:17:03] ever accepted Yours Mine and everybody
[1:17:06] else's isn't that wonderful to think the
[1:17:09] same blood that he looks at me through
[1:17:10] is the same blood he looks at you
[1:17:12] through it don't matter what your sin or
[1:17:14] what's your past or failures people get
[1:17:16] so focused on the wrong thing he's
[1:17:17] looking at us through the exact same
[1:17:19] blood that was shed on the cross of
[1:17:22] makes me want to shout all over this
[1:17:23] building the good and the bad and the
[1:17:25] Ugly he sees it all the same he sees red
[1:17:30] through the blood so that's the only way
[1:17:32] it'll be accepted see in order for a
[1:17:34] sacrifice to be accepted has to be the
[1:17:36] right sacrifice I preached a message on
[1:17:38] this right people right place right
[1:17:39] sacrifice remember in the Old Testament
[1:17:41] that that that it had to be at an altar
[1:17:43] it had to be at the right Temple where a
[1:17:45] sacrifice was made it couldn't just be
[1:17:47] out there on any grounds but they had to
[1:17:49] have a temple where the priest could go
[1:17:50] into the temple and make a sacrifice
[1:17:52] unto God a priest or or one that that
[1:17:54] was commanded to do it a prophet would
[1:17:56] be commanded you remember even even Saul
[1:17:59] he actually lost his kingdom because he
[1:18:01] went out of the will of God and made a
[1:18:02] sacrifice on his own remember whenever
[1:18:04] God came to Samuel he said I'm going to
[1:18:06] come and I'll tell you what to do so
[1:18:08] wait seven days and then you're going to
[1:18:09] make a peace offering unto me and so
[1:18:11] when he came to uh uh Saul had hurt he
[1:18:13] got anxious and got tired of waiting so
[1:18:15] Saul went out and made the sacrifice
[1:18:16] anyway waiting on the word of the Lord
[1:18:18] so when Samuel came he gave him the word
[1:18:19] of the Lord he said you would have ra
[1:18:21] your your family would have raised and
[1:18:23] been over this nation for out all the
[1:18:25] time but because you've disobeyed the
[1:18:27] word of the Lord now I'm going to raise
[1:18:28] up somebody else that's according to my
[1:18:30] own heart he lost his kingdom because he
[1:18:32] went made a sacrifice that wasn't
[1:18:34] acceptable to God it was offered but it
[1:18:36] wasn't accepted see so it takes the
[1:18:37] right person to make a sacrifice the
[1:18:39] right people it had to be a priest it
[1:18:41] had to had to be the one that was set in
[1:18:43] that place it had to be in the right
[1:18:44] place he had to go down to the Templar
[1:18:46] to the altar to make the sacrifice and
[1:18:48] so here we see that that that that they
[1:18:50] had it had to be something that was
[1:18:52] accepted by God but notice what John
[1:18:54] says in the book of Revelation he said
[1:18:55] Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness
[1:18:58] and the first begotten of the dead and
[1:18:59] the prince of the kings of the earth
[1:19:01] unto him that loved us and washed us
[1:19:03] from our sins in his own blood he has
[1:19:06] made us Kings and Priests unto God and
[1:19:11] glory and Dominion forever and ever in
[1:19:13] other words he made you a king to have
[1:19:15] dominion and a priest to make a
[1:19:17] sacrifice you know what a king has
[1:19:19] dominion over over the Natural Things a
[1:19:21] priest has dominion over the spiritual
[1:19:23] things so Peter said or John said so God
[1:19:26] has made us Kings and Priests that means
[1:19:28] you have dominion over the natural and
[1:19:29] you have dominion over the spiritual you
[1:19:31] have dominion over the flesh so it it
[1:19:33] ain't we don't have to bow down to
[1:19:34] nobody he made you a king and a priest
[1:19:36] that you could be the ruler over this
[1:19:38] own Temple that God has created in you
[1:19:41] you're the king and the priest you you
[1:19:43] put out what don't belong there you
[1:19:45] allow in what you want to allow in
[1:19:47] you're the ruler of your own kingdom
[1:19:49] you're the king over your own Temple say
[1:19:52] so you allow in there what you want says
[1:19:54] these made us Dominion you know what
[1:19:55] that means that nothing can hinder you
[1:19:58] brother Mark from entering this Temple
[1:20:00] of Praise nothing can hinder you there's
[1:20:03] no hindrance that's great enough that
[1:20:05] can keep you from his presence he said
[1:20:07] know you not that you are a temple of
[1:20:10] God wherever you are can I add that in
[1:20:14] wherever you are you are a temple of God
[1:20:18] no matter where you go you are a temple
[1:20:20] of God Paul asked this question do you
[1:20:23] not know who you are do you know that
[1:20:25] you're a temple and in this temple of
[1:20:27] God that you have a right to make a
[1:20:29] sacrifice you remember where the altar
[1:20:31] is that's why the Bible would say the
[1:20:32] altar was on the on the heart in the
[1:20:34] heart of a man that was the Throne of
[1:20:36] God here here in this temple of God here
[1:20:39] lays a heart brother marah that is an
[1:20:41] altar of God what a that that you can
[1:20:43] make a sacrifice upon God's altar in
[1:20:45] God's Temple that's why you can kneel
[1:20:47] down wherever you are and you begin to
[1:20:49] speak to God it ain't some some magic
[1:20:51] place that you have to go to but in that
[1:20:53] temple of God in the altar of a man's
[1:20:55] heart it's the place where God dwells oh
[1:20:57] my is it wonderful God is building a
[1:21:00] building he's building a place of praise
[1:21:02] and thanksgiving he's building a praise
[1:21:04] that you can come and meet God under the
[1:21:06] blood of the sacrifice it was the
[1:21:08] sacrifice on the cross of Calvary when
[1:21:10] Jesus said forgive them for they know
[1:21:11] not what they do he was sanctifying the
[1:21:14] altar that is in your heart by the blood
[1:21:16] of Jesus Christ that you might make a
[1:21:18] sacrifice unto God on a Sanctified altar
[1:21:21] amen the only place that God would ever
[1:21:23] accept a sacrif
[1:21:25] it was in a Sanctified place oh my God's
[1:21:28] Building a building you say where's he
[1:21:30] building in every one of you this is
[1:21:32] God's Building this is what he's looking
[1:21:33] at it's his building it's his temples
[1:21:35] that is around the world Peter said you
[1:21:37] are Lively stones and you're built up a
[1:21:40] spiritual house you're a holy priesthood
[1:21:42] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[1:21:45] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ amen
[1:21:48] you're a temple of God giving praise
[1:21:50] unto God upon the altar of God in the
[1:21:54] presence of of God a Sanctified altar in
[1:21:56] the heart of every believer a Temple of
[1:21:59] Praise he said we're expecting God to do
[1:22:02] something for us he said he can't do
[1:22:04] nothing for us if we're all drooping
[1:22:06] around like something half dead he said
[1:22:09] but God wants a lively Church hello
[1:22:11] somebody go ahead God wants a lively
[1:22:15] church he wants the members in there to
[1:22:17] be Lively Stones built up in the house
[1:22:19] of Faith believe him and accept him and
[1:22:22] taking him at his word not just noise
[1:22:26] not just noise he ain't just wanting a a
[1:22:28] loud church a bunch of Pentecostalism
[1:22:30] but you remember what he told Aaron go
[1:22:32] sanctify the altar he wants a lively
[1:22:34] church that has a sacrifice that's made
[1:22:36] on a Sanctified altar so when a man that
[1:22:38] is Sanctified in the presence of God I I
[1:22:40] may as well just give it to you I'm
[1:22:41] closing sister you want to come I may as
[1:22:43] well may as well tell you a man that's
[1:22:45] Sanctified in his heart has a right to
[1:22:46] worship God when your heart is
[1:22:49] Sanctified before God you you repented
[1:22:51] of your sins and you and you you came
[1:22:53] and down to an altar you knelt down you
[1:22:55] gave that to God and here God has
[1:22:57] Sanctified your heart you poured
[1:22:58] everything out to God you got a right to
[1:23:00] scream as loud as you want to scream you
[1:23:02] can shout as loud as you want to shout
[1:23:04] you can run as fast as you can run you
[1:23:06] can dance all over this building you can
[1:23:08] run up and down those pews if you want
[1:23:10] to because the altar has been Sanctified
[1:23:13] before God and it's an acceptable
[1:23:15] sacrifice to
[1:23:16] him you're a Temple of
[1:23:19] Praise Paul said I beseech you Brethren
[1:23:23] present your body as a living s
[1:23:24] sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God
[1:23:26] it's your reasonable surface be not
[1:23:29] conformed to this world but be
[1:23:31] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:23:33] that you may prove what is good and
[1:23:35] acceptable in the perfect will of God be
[1:23:37] not conformed you know what that means
[1:23:39] to conform means to
[1:23:41] Fashion after a former
[1:23:44] thing he said be not conformed to this
[1:23:48] former be not conformed to the world
[1:23:51] it's the former these old Dimensions
[1:23:53] that we used to droop around him he said
[1:23:56] don't conform to that you know where
[1:23:58] that word came from in the scripture in
[1:24:00] that in that Greek Roman
[1:24:02] World conformity in society was was a
[1:24:06] major
[1:24:08] influence in order to be anything in
[1:24:10] society you had to conform in society
[1:24:14] that's what that's what made you fit in
[1:24:15] the prestige and all this it was very
[1:24:17] highly valued so the concept of
[1:24:20] conforming to the image or pattering
[1:24:22] after something it was something that
[1:24:23] was well understood in this culture
[1:24:24] because everybody in the society
[1:24:26] patterned after something they were
[1:24:28] pattering after this one or pattern
[1:24:30] after this group or whatever part of
[1:24:32] soed that they came from so in the New
[1:24:34] Testament here when Paul would come out
[1:24:36] to speak this this word conform was
[1:24:38] something that they were very accustomed
[1:24:39] to but he uses this to contrast this
[1:24:43] temporary and external nature of worldly
[1:24:47] Conformity so he's contrasted saying
[1:24:49] don't conform to this world he's showing
[1:24:52] you that there's something else that you
[1:24:54] can follow after but instead of
[1:24:57] conforming to the external nature of
[1:25:00] this world but but but
[1:25:03] transform to this internal work that God
[1:25:07] is doing in your
[1:25:08] life see here he's looking on the
[1:25:11] outside what you can see he said don't
[1:25:14] conform to what you can see but be
[1:25:17] transformed to what you can't see the
[1:25:20] transformative power of an internal work
[1:25:22] of God in a believer's life this is what
[1:25:25] Paul was preaching be
[1:25:27] transformed no longer are we confined by
[1:25:29] the limitations of an outside world I
[1:25:31] know what the world does if you want to
[1:25:32] stand your feet the world looks at
[1:25:34] Christians and say you got to get
[1:25:36] outside of the boundaries of
[1:25:37] Christianity because you're
[1:25:40] bound but a real believer looks at the
[1:25:42] world and says you need to get outside
[1:25:44] of the boundaries of the world because
[1:25:46] you're bound isn't it something to come
[1:25:48] out of the boundaries of Christianity
[1:25:50] you'd be right back in the three
[1:25:52] dimensions you came out of never be able
[1:25:54] to partake of another
[1:25:56] world the Unseen but here real
[1:25:59] Christianity brother Mark it's calling
[1:26:01] us outside of what the world can even
[1:26:03] see something far beyond our
[1:26:06] understanding it's an unseen calling to
[1:26:09] the scene I know Satan he's a perverter
[1:26:12] he says going to church is going to hold
[1:26:14] you back you can't be nothing you can't
[1:26:16] you can't you can't get a good job you
[1:26:19] can't get no degree and can't you can't
[1:26:20] be a teacher if you be a if you go to
[1:26:22] church all that lies that the devil
[1:26:24] tells you oh that's a lie that you can't
[1:26:27] you got to you got to be a nobody if
[1:26:29] you're if you're going it just made this
[1:26:31] into where you know you young people you
[1:26:34] know if you serve god well there went
[1:26:35] all the
[1:26:37] fun there when all the
[1:26:39] fun my my kids are spoiled I'll admit it
[1:26:44] but you ask them how much fun and any of
[1:26:46] any of their friends or cousins or
[1:26:48] that's been been around us in my life
[1:26:50] since I've had children how much fun it
[1:26:53] is we have fun with our kids and I think
[1:26:56] it's important to
[1:26:57] do and being a Christian don't take away
[1:27:00] fun that's a lie of the devil I'm just
[1:27:01] giving you some free pastoring it's a
[1:27:04] lie of the devil you know what they do
[1:27:06] they go out to the lake they go out and
[1:27:07] they they have fun they like to they
[1:27:09] like to ski they go ski down the
[1:27:10] mountain they like to hunt they go shoot

[1:27:18] drunk and all the things that the world
[1:27:20] has to offer that the world costs
[1:27:22] fun but real just true pure fun what
[1:27:25] Christian what what what anything about
[1:27:28] serving God took away kids having being
[1:27:30] able to enjoy their life they enjoy it
[1:27:33] and they enjoy being Christians and they
[1:27:35] enjoy serving God and they enjoy the
[1:27:36] Liberties of being Sons and Daughters of
[1:27:38] God and being told that you're not you
[1:27:40] ain't from this world that's why you're
[1:27:42] different but it didn't take away being
[1:27:45] able to enjoy being a
[1:27:47] child it's a lie that that was a
[1:27:50] perverter can I just say it like this
