[12:52] So I said thanks
[12:55] for loving me.
[12:57] For you have set
[13:00] my spirit free.
[13:02] Well, I'm not one
[13:05] I used to be.
[13:07] So I say thank you, Lord. All put your

[13:54] for loving me.
[13:56] For you have set, oh my spirit free."
[14:01] Well, I'm not one I used to be.
[14:06] So I said, "Thank you, Lord, for loving
[14:09] me."
[14:11] Oh, my empty heart was heavy and no one
[14:15] even cared. My life was full of misery
[14:19] and no one else would share. My spirit
[14:22] was in prison and I could not find the
[14:25] key. Oh, but he opened up my heart by
[14:28] loving me. Oh, so I set thanks
[14:33] for loving me.

[14:40] Well, I'm not one I used to be. Oh, so I
[14:46] said, "Thank you, Lord." Oh, let's sing
[14:48] that second verse once more. Oh, my
[14:51] empty heart was heavy and no one even
[14:54] cared. My life was full of misery and no
[14:58] one else would change. My spirit was in

[15:24] Oh, I said thanks.
[15:26] I'll sing it once more. For so I set
[15:30] thanks
[15:31] for loving me
[15:34] for you have set. Oh my spirit free.
[15:39] Well, I'm not what
[15:41] I used to be.
[15:44] So I say thank you Lord for loving me.

[15:50] morning.
[15:55] [Music]
[16:04] Joseph lived a life
[16:09] of hurt and hatred.
[16:16] Even his old family brought him pain.
[16:23] [Music]
[16:28] When his brother's thought he would
[16:32] surely seek reveal,
[16:37] he said, "I have seen God's purpose now
[16:42] made plain
[16:46] [Music]
[16:53] of Jehovah.
[16:59] I look back and see.
[17:03] He was always
[17:05] leading me.
[17:11] What was made for evil, God has used to
[17:18] show me his great love. I now understand
[17:25] the tender hand
[17:28] of Jehovah.
[17:30] [Music]
[17:36] Many Jews were killed
[17:40] and saw a sunder.
[17:43] [Music]
[17:45] Oh, it seemed that God had left
[17:51] his very own.
[17:56] Oh, but through it all,
[18:00] God had a plan.
[18:04] Little did they know
[18:08] he'd bring all his children, all his
[18:12] children back home.
[18:20] Oh, how
[18:22] can I deny
[18:25] his hand of mercy?
[18:27] [Music]
[18:29] Oh,
[18:32] when troubles come
[18:34] without
[18:36] a reason why,
[18:40] I
[18:42] just lift my hands and say
[18:48] everything
[18:49] is for my good. He has all the answers.
[18:57] all the answers
[18:59] to my life.
[19:03] It was the tender hand
[19:07] [Music]
[19:10] of Jehovah.
[19:14] I can look back and see
[19:19] he was all
[19:21] leading me.
[19:23] [Music]
[19:26] What was made for evil God has used.
[19:33] Show me his great love. I now understand
[19:40] the tender hand of Jehovah.
[19:48] and
[19:51] for evil God is used. Show me his great
[19:59] love. I'll understand
[20:03] the tender hand of Jehovah.
[20:10] [Music]

[20:28] thankful? He's working all things for
[20:30] your good. The Bible says all things
[20:32] work together for the good. I heard it
[20:34] once said he didn't say everything would
[20:36] be good, but he said it would work for
[20:37] the good. So, let's just thank him this
[20:40] morning. Oh, thanks. Oh, thanks. Oh, I
[20:45] give you thanks for all you have done.
[20:52] Oh, and I am so blessed. My soul has

[21:17] rest. Oh Lord, oh I give Oh, sing it
[21:22] once more. Oh, and thanks. Yes, thanks.

[44:12] astray, but he never gave up on us. But
[44:14] David said, "Surely goodness and mercy
[44:16] shall follow me all the days of my

[47:50] my Jesus.

[48:36] morning? Amen. And I wonder how many
[48:38] witnesses do we have here today that his
[48:41] goodness and mercyy's never left you.
[48:43] Amen. It's never failed you. Amen. He's
[48:46] been he's been with you in the dark
[48:48] times, on the mountains and in the
[48:51] valleys. Amen. He's the never failing
[48:53] God. There's one thing we know this
[48:56] morning. His word is true. And we're
[48:58] gathered here today as witnesses of the
[48:59] power of his word this morning. And I
[49:02] know there may be a a lot of things
[49:04] going on in our lives and situations we
[49:06] may be facing, but if we can just open
[49:08] up our hearts and give him praise and
[49:10] begin to worship him. Amen. I know a
[49:12] praise and a worship from a believer go
[49:14] a long way this morning. Amen. This
[49:16] morning, let's just bow our hearts
[49:17] together for a word of prayer as we
[49:19] approach him. Heavenly Father, Lord, as
[49:22] your believers have gathered here on
[49:24] this resurrection Sunday morning, this
[49:26] beautiful Sunday that you've given us,
[49:28] Father, Lord, we've not gathered here
[49:30] out of form or fashion. We've not
[49:32] gathered here out of tradition or
[49:34] ritual, Lord, but we've gathered here
[49:36] because there is a deep calling to the
[49:38] deep. And Lord, our prophet has taught
[49:40] us that before there was a deep calling
[49:42] to the deep, there had to be a deep to
[49:44] respond. And Lord, I believe this
[49:46] morning that these are your eagllets,
[49:48] Father, your believers that have
[49:50] gathered around the carcass this
[49:51] morning. Uh Lord, we've not gathered
[49:53] here to be seen or to be heard, but
[49:55] Lord, we've gathered to draw closer to
[49:57] you. And Lord, that we may receive
[49:59] something from your word that would be
[50:01] of benefit to our lives this morning.
[50:03] Now, Father, if there's a desire in our
[50:05] hearts today for more of you, I am a
[50:07] firm believer, Lord, that there is more
[50:10] of you for us to receive this morning.
[50:12] Father, I pray a special blessing today
[50:14] upon all the fathers in this building,
[50:17] Lord. Father, you see the stands they've
[50:19] made and had to take, Lord, for your
[50:21] word. And Lord, you see the pressures
[50:23] and the responsibilities, oh God, that
[50:25] lay upon their shoulders. But Lord,
[50:27] they're standing for you and standing
[50:29] for their families and for this word. I
[50:31] pray today, oh God, they would receive a
[50:33] special blessing from your presence
[50:35] today. Lord, I pray as we open your word
[50:37] this morning, may you send the spirit of
[50:39] wisdom and revelation into the building.
[50:42] May you drive out every spirit that's
[50:44] unlike the Holy Spirit. Lord, may the
[50:46] great influence of the Almighty God come
[50:48] in this building today. Lord, you see
[50:50] empty vessels here today, Father. May
[50:52] they be filled, oh God. Lord, I pray for
[50:55] those that are facing battles, Lord, and
[50:57] in situations this morning. Lord, may
[51:00] that great delivering angel sweep
[51:01] through the building today, oh God, with
[51:03] direction, Father. Lord, with
[51:05] deliverance this morning for those sick
[51:07] in their bodies and unable to be here,
[51:09] Lord, maybe some at home listening. I
[51:11] pray the angel of God would pass through
[51:13] their living room, Lord. Father, may the
[51:15] anointing settle down over their bodies,
[51:17] Lord, and break the power of that
[51:19] sickness, oh God. Lord, I pray for those
[51:22] that have lost desire and lost the
[51:23] ambition, Lord. I pray this morning you
[51:26] would stir up their minds by the way of
[51:28] remembrance, oh God. And Lord, may they
[51:30] return to the fold, Father. Lord, this
[51:32] morning we ask you to forgive us of our
[51:34] failures and our shortcomings, oh God.
[51:37] Lord, hide us behind the cross of
[51:39] Calvary this morning. And may your
[51:41] blood, that powerful blood, may it flow
[51:44] through this building today, dear God,
[51:46] touching hearts and lives. And Lord,
[51:48] we'll be sure to give thee all the
[51:49] praise, all the honor, and all the glory
[51:52] in the wonderful name of our Lord and
[51:54] Savior Jesus Christ. We pray and all the
[51:57] believers says, "Amen." And amen. God
[52:01] bless you this morning. How many is
[52:02] happy to be in the house of God? Amen.
[52:05] on a on a Sunday morning. We do want to
[52:07] say God bless you this morning and happy
[52:09] Father's Day to all you fathers. I know
[52:11] it's already been said, but we we just
[52:13] want to say it once again. May God
[52:15] richly bless you and your families and
[52:17] Amen. Haven't it just been a wonderful
[52:19] song service this morning and the
[52:21] presence of the Lord just moving. We
[52:23] sure enjoyed that song service and Amen.
[52:26] that choir. Wasn't that powerful? Amen.
[52:28] Let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[52:29] praise this morning. I sure appreciate
[52:31] our sister Vanna working with the young
[52:34] people and amen to see those talents and
[52:37] gifts being cultivated in the presence
[52:38] of God is it is a real a real honor and
[52:41] a real privilege to behold that and amen
[52:43] this morning if you have your Bibles we
[52:45] want to go to the book of Exodus the
[52:46] 12th chapter. Amen. I sure enjoyed
[52:49] getting to watch that beautiful baby
[52:51] dedication this morning. Brother Joel,
[52:52] God bless you and your family. And I was
[52:54] just sitting back there reminiscing a
[52:56] minute when he was dedicating that baby
[52:58] and thinking about the first times we
[53:00] met and how the Lord went and got a hold
[53:02] of brother Tim and filled him with the
[53:04] Holy Ghost and what a masterpiece he
[53:06] made out of that family and then to be
[53:08] standing here today and see him
[53:09] dedicating that baby we I tell you God
[53:11] has been good. Amen. Amen. Sometimes I
[53:15] get to reminisce in a minute and
[53:17] thinking about standing over at the
[53:18] Reynolds house and Amen. One of these
[53:20] days we're going to have to make some
[53:20] more brownies and Amen. That's an inside
[53:23] joke we'll leave for another time. Amen.
[53:26] But we we sure love the Reynolds this
[53:28] morning and see the blessings of God
[53:29] there. And Amen. is it just good to be a
[53:31] Christian this morning. Amen. The book
[53:34] of Exodus the 12th chapter. We want to
[53:36] look in the 12th verse.
[53:38] It's a very very familiar reading.
[53:42] Moses here writing. He says, "Now, for I
[53:44] will pass through the land of Egypt." I
[53:46] believe Moses here's prophesying on
[53:49] behalf of the Lord. He says, "For I will
[53:50] pass through the land of Egypt this
[53:53] night, and will smite all the firstborn
[53:56] in the land of Egypt, both man and
[53:59] beast, and against all the gods of
[54:01] Egypt. I will execute judgment. I am the
[54:05] Lord." But the blood shall be for a
[54:09] token upon the blood shall be to you for
[54:13] a token upon the houses where you are.
[54:16] And when I see the blood, I will pass
[54:19] over you. So he's going to pass through
[54:22] the land. But when he sees the blood, he
[54:26] will pass over you. And the plague shall
[54:28] not be up on you to destroy you when I
[54:32] smite the land of Egypt. Now in the book
[54:35] of Hebrews, the 11th chapter, Hebrews
[54:38] chap 11, I want to pull one verse out of
[54:40] Hebrews 11 and verse 31. Um it's a very
[54:44] very familiar chapter. We know it as the
[54:47] faith chapter as the heroes of faith.
[54:49] The honor role of the heroes of faith.
[54:52] And in the 31st verse of Hebrews 11,
[54:55] Paul here writing, he says, "Now by
[54:58] faith," how many knows faith is a
[54:59] revelation.
[55:01] By faith the harlot Rahab perished not
[55:05] with them that believe not when she had
[55:09] received the spies with peace. Can I say
[55:12] it like this? By revelation, the harlot
[55:16] Rahab perished not with them that
[55:18] believe not when she had received the
[55:21] spies with peace. Amen. We ask the Lord
[55:24] this morning to add the blessing to the
[55:25] reading of his word. As you can have
[55:27] your seats here today, I want to uh by
[55:29] the help of the Lord this morning, if I
[55:30] would take a title, I want to speak to
[55:32] you on this under the influence of the
[55:35] token message. Under the influence of
[55:38] the token message. And maybe if I would
[55:41] uh pull something out of that, I maybe
[55:43] uh subtitle it or take a context out of
[55:45] that. I want to talk to you on Rahab the
[55:48] influencer. Rahab the influencer. And
[55:51] you know, uh there's only the only way
[55:53] that something can actually influence
[55:55] you. Amen. Is you've got to come under
[55:57] it. Now, in the message, the toolken
[55:59] 1963, brother Bramman says, don't just
[56:02] come this far and say, I believe the
[56:04] message. Amen. But you obey the
[56:06] messenger and come into Christ. You say,
[56:09] "Well, I believe every word," said
[56:11] Brother Brandham. Amen. That's good, but
[56:13] that's just being able to read. He said,
[56:16] "But you take the message and take it
[56:19] into your heart that you must have the
[56:21] token, the very life that was in Christ,
[56:25] amen, be in you. When I see the blood, I
[56:29] will pass over you." In the another
[56:31] place in the message, the toolken, he
[56:33] says, "We're not come together to talk
[56:35] about the message." Amen. We are come
[56:38] together to get in the message and the
[56:41] message is Christ. He is the word. Amen.
[56:44] God bless you, brother Harvey. Good to
[56:46] see you. Amen. Amen. God bless you all
[56:48] this morning. And the message is Christ.
[56:50] Amen. Now, he is the word. That's right.
[56:53] Amen. We're to get into it. We're to get
[56:56] beneath it. Amen. Now, watch this. The
[56:58] message is Christ. He is the word. Amen.
[57:02] That's right. We're to get into it.
[57:04] We're to get beneath it. Amen. That's
[57:06] what we're supposed to do now. Amen. I
[57:08] find it very amazing that the age we're
[57:10] living in. Amen. We're living in an age
[57:13] that is full of influences. There's
[57:15] influences on every corner. Everywhere
[57:17] you look, there's influences. And the
[57:19] and the age we're living in, Amen.
[57:21] Actually, people have been called
[57:23] influencers. So, it's not just an age of
[57:26] influences, but now, amen, the world is
[57:29] full of influencers. And I I took time
[57:31] to look up what an influencer is. It's a
[57:34] person who is able to generate interest
[57:36] in something. Amen. It's someone who's
[57:39] able to use their abilities to in to
[57:42] encourage somebody. Amen. To have
[57:44] interest in something. Now, I find it
[57:46] very amazing that influence is a
[57:49] powerful thing. Amen. When you look here
[57:51] at the definition, I found three def uh
[57:54] different definitions of the word
[57:55] influence. One is the capacity to have
[57:58] an effect on the character on the
[58:00] development or the behavior of someone
[58:02] or something. Amen. Or the effect
[58:05] itself. Amen. Influence is the power to
[58:08] shape. Amen. The influence is the power
[58:11] to shape. Another one. Influence is the
[58:14] process of producing modifications.
[58:17] Amen. Especially when slow or permanent.
[58:20] Amen. To exert or maintain a mental
[58:23] Amen. or moral power up on or over
[58:26] others. Another one, influence is the
[58:29] flowing into of power. So, amen, there's
[58:32] a direct connection between influence
[58:34] and power. Amen. Whether in the form of
[58:37] motive or ability. Now, you all that
[58:39] study the message, you know that brother
[58:41] Brown preaches several messages on
[58:43] influence. He'll he'll call it influence
[58:45] of another. Amen. Influences or
[58:47] influence. And he'll take it. Amen. From
[58:49] Isaiah 6 and verse 1 to8. Amen. where
[58:52] Isaiah had gotten his eyes off of the
[58:54] Lord and he's got his eyes over on
[58:57] Uzziah. Amen. But then there came angels
[59:00] into the atmosphere and the Bible said
[59:02] that which way they did cover their face
[59:04] which meant humil or reverence and then
[59:06] which twain they covered their feet
[59:08] which meant reverence. Amen. And which
[59:10] way they did fly. Amen. And which meant
[59:12] action showing Amen. how that uh Uzziah
[59:16] had become an influence over Isaiah.
[59:19] Amen. But it was not God's God's desire,
[59:23] amen, for Uzziah to be Isaiah's
[59:25] influence. Amen. It was God's desire for
[59:28] himself, Amen, to be the influence over
[59:30] Isaiah. And the prophet of God said, you
[59:32] know, we might not want to believe this.
[59:35] Amen. But everything we do, Amen, we are
[59:38] influencing someone else. Amen. Do you
[59:40] realize this morning, you're influencing
[59:42] someone else? Amen. Amen. Right here in
[59:44] this building, the way you're conducting
[59:46] yourselves and Amen. the way you're
[59:48] worshiping and the way you're praising
[59:49] God. Amen. Is influencing someone around
[59:52] you. Somebody, amen, is looking at you
[59:55] this morning. I'll say this. Amen. We
[59:57] need influential Christians. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:00] That are influenced by the word of God.
[1:00:02] The prophet of God said, "Call men or
[1:00:04] women for an influence." Amen. To the
[1:00:07] elected church for the last days. Amen.
[1:00:09] Is what we need. Amen. God give it to
[1:00:12] us. They'll be here. Amen. They're going
[1:00:14] to be. Now I find it amazing that
[1:00:17] influence actually has the power, amen,
[1:00:20] to convert someone, amen, from unbelief
[1:00:23] unto faith. It has the power, amen, to
[1:00:25] convert someone from sin unto
[1:00:27] righteousness. In the book of St. Luke
[1:00:29] chapter 1, the Bible, uh, in the third
[1:00:32] verse, speaking of a man named
[1:00:34] Theophilles, it said, "It seemed good to
[1:00:36] me also, having had perfect
[1:00:37] understanding, amen, of all the things
[1:00:40] from the very first, amen, to write unto
[1:00:42] thee in order, amen, most excellent
[1:00:45] Theophilus." Now, I took time to look up
[1:00:47] the meaning of the word Theophilles,
[1:00:49] that name. Amen. And it actually means
[1:00:52] friend of God. Amen. Now, Theophilus was
[1:00:54] the person that Luke, amen, addressed
[1:00:57] his gospel in the book of Acts 2. Amen.
[1:01:00] I find this amazing. He was a He was
[1:01:02] probably an official of high rank. Amen.
[1:01:05] He was a gentile of rank and
[1:01:07] consideration. But I want you to notice
[1:01:09] what happened. He came under the
[1:01:11] influence of Luke, Amen, or Paul at Rome
[1:01:15] and was converted to the Christian
[1:01:17] faith. Amen. When when Theophilos came
[1:01:20] underneath the influence, Amen. of of
[1:01:22] Luke or Paul at Rome. Amen. He was
[1:01:25] converted to the Christian faith. I want
[1:01:27] to say, amen, that Paul or Luke, Amen,
[1:01:30] whomever it was, must have been some
[1:01:32] salt. Amen. Amen. They must have been
[1:01:35] more than just intellectual believers
[1:01:36] and they must have had more than just a
[1:01:38] head knowledge. But somewhere they must
[1:01:41] have met the God of Abraham and had come
[1:01:43] in contact with him and had become a
[1:01:46] representative of his on the earth. Now
[1:01:48] you all that read the Bible, you know
[1:01:50] Matthew 5:13 says, "Amen, that ye are
[1:01:53] the salt of the earth." Amen. But if the
[1:01:56] salt has lost its savor, amen, wherewith
[1:01:59] it shall be salted, it is then for good
[1:02:01] for nothing. Amen. But to be cast out
[1:02:04] and to be trotten under the foot of man.
[1:02:07] When you look there at that word salt,
[1:02:09] it is a symbol of lasting concord
[1:02:12] because it protects food, amen, from
[1:02:15] putriication
[1:02:16] and preserves it unchanged. Amen. I'll
[1:02:19] say what a prophet said. We must be
[1:02:22] salty and the world will be thirsty. He
[1:02:25] said, you're the salt of the earth.
[1:02:27] Amen. But if the salt has only got a
[1:02:30] look and not a savor, it is henceforth
[1:02:33] good for nothing. Amen. But to be
[1:02:35] laughed at. another place. We are the
[1:02:37] salt of the earth. And if the salt is
[1:02:39] still got its savor in it, amen, and
[1:02:42] contacts, it's a saver. But if the salt
[1:02:45] has lost its strength, amen, if our
[1:02:47] testimonies are so irregular and one day
[1:02:50] we're up and the next day we're down and
[1:02:52] this way we're believing and the next
[1:02:54] day we're not. Amen. How can a sinner,
[1:02:57] amen, find anything from us? Amen. We
[1:03:00] must take our stand for God and there
[1:03:03] remain until death sets us free. I'll
[1:03:06] say this, the strength of the salt,
[1:03:08] Amen, is the power of the resurrection.
[1:03:11] Amen. The prophet said the life that
[1:03:13] Jesus gave. Amen. What is the strength?
[1:03:16] Amen. Of the Holy Spirit should be in
[1:03:18] every member of the church. Amen. What
[1:03:20] do you mean strength? Amen. The power of
[1:03:23] the resurrection. The life that Jesus
[1:03:26] gave for the church should be operating
[1:03:29] in every member of the bodies. Amen. And
[1:03:32] if the church gets that burden on their
[1:03:34] heart, amen, to contact someone. Amen.
[1:03:37] To get someone saved. Amen. Then the
[1:03:40] strength is coming back into the church
[1:03:43] again and into the people. Amen. So the
[1:03:47] strength of God is not to just be in the
[1:03:49] preacher. It's not to just be in the
[1:03:51] song leader or the musicians or the
[1:03:54] deacon. But the strength of God is to be
[1:03:56] flowing through every member, amen, of
[1:03:59] the church of the living God. Now I'll
[1:04:01] just say this. Our influence, Amen, is
[1:04:04] supposed to change the world. Amen. And
[1:04:06] not the world's influence change the
[1:04:08] church. The prophet said, "Ye are the
[1:04:10] salt of the earth." Amen. I'm afraid
[1:04:13] that's what happened to the church.
[1:04:14] Amen. It's lost its sweetness. Amen.
[1:04:17] Amen. Now, let's just preach this
[1:04:18] morning. Amen. It's lost its love. It's
[1:04:21] lost its influence. Amen. To bring
[1:04:23] sinners to you. Amen. Just taking in a
[1:04:25] bunch of members and baptizing them and
[1:04:28] let them live in the world. Amen. And
[1:04:31] their influence has corrupted the
[1:04:33] church. Amen. I'm all about witnessing
[1:04:35] and I'm all about outreach. I I'll do it
[1:04:37] any day and every day. But listen, this
[1:04:40] message is not just sent, amen, to fill
[1:04:42] up a building. It's not just sent to put
[1:04:45] a bunch of people on pews and amen, just
[1:04:47] put the name of Jesus over their life.
[1:04:49] Amen. It's sent to change a man, amen,
[1:04:52] from the top of his head, amen, to the
[1:04:54] sole of his feet. And if we really
[1:04:56] believe this message, then we believe
[1:04:58] this message still has the ability,
[1:05:00] amen, to take sin and to take
[1:05:02] ungodliness and to take perversion,
[1:05:05] amen, out of the hearts and lives of his
[1:05:06] children. Listen, I'll say this and I'll
[1:05:08] go down dying saying it. Amen. Worldly
[1:05:11] influences, amen, does not belong in the
[1:05:14] church of God. And I'll go a step
[1:05:16] further and say denominational
[1:05:18] influences, amen, does not belong in the
[1:05:21] church of God. Amen. When salt loses its
[1:05:23] savor, Amen. It becomes sand. Amen. The
[1:05:27] product of God said that the main thing
[1:05:29] being influence, Amen. Not by what great
[1:05:31] numbers we are. Amen. by but what a
[1:05:34] great God that we're representing and
[1:05:36] the kind of life that's in us amen by
[1:05:39] him will influence others. He said,
[1:05:42] "See, how can how how can a Christian
[1:05:44] and when we lose our influence as a
[1:05:46] father, Amen, as a mother, as a
[1:05:49] Christian, as a businessman, as a
[1:05:51] minister, when we lose our influence
[1:05:53] with people." Amen. Now, we can be very
[1:05:56] popular in the line of the world and go
[1:05:59] along with the world. But I mean as what
[1:06:01] we represent. Amen. We represent Christ.
[1:06:07] Amen. We lose our influence. I'm going
[1:06:09] to say what a prophet said. How can we
[1:06:11] blend in with the day when God is so
[1:06:14] against the day? Amen. How can we blend
[1:06:18] in with the day when God is so against
[1:06:21] the day? I'll say this, a child of God,
[1:06:24] amen, is not sent to fit in or to blend
[1:06:27] in. But a child of God is sent, amen, by
[1:06:31] God into this age, amen, to stand out as
[1:06:35] a representative of the literal life of
[1:06:38] Jesus Christ. Listen, I know it may not
[1:06:40] be popular, but but you hear my heart
[1:06:43] this morning. Amen. Everything that's
[1:06:45] popular is not always right. And
[1:06:47] everything that's right is not always
[1:06:50] popular. I remember as a kid in school,
[1:06:52] the Lord called me to preach at a very
[1:06:54] young age. And amen, back in them days,
[1:06:56] I really didn't care about arithmetic or
[1:06:58] English or none of that. Amen. I was on
[1:07:00] fire to preach the gospel. And I was
[1:07:01] sitting in the English class one day and
[1:07:03] the teacher had a poster on the wall and
[1:07:05] she was teaching and I was staring at
[1:07:07] that poster. Brother Matt had had a
[1:07:09] bunch of fish and they were all swimming
[1:07:11] downstream, but it had one fish that was
[1:07:13] streaming upstream. Swimming upstream.
[1:07:15] She looked at me. She said, "Why are you
[1:07:17] looking at that?" I said, "Oh, never
[1:07:18] mind me. I'm just getting a sermon out
[1:07:19] of that." She said, "What do you mean?"
[1:07:21] I said, "Well, the sign says, "Whatever
[1:07:23] is popular is not always right. But
[1:07:26] whatever is right is not always popular.
[1:07:28] And though there'll be a hundred
[1:07:30] churches going one direction, if we
[1:07:32] believe that God is God and we believe
[1:07:34] his word is true, we say, "Well, if I
[1:07:37] turn and go upstream,
[1:07:39] I'm going to stand out. I would rather
[1:07:41] stand out on this earth, amen, for the
[1:07:43] power of Jesus Christ than to fit in
[1:07:45] with every ungodly devil and spirit that
[1:07:47] has crawled up out of hell." I'll say
[1:07:49] what a prophet said as a believer, amen,
[1:07:52] we are his point of contact, amen, on
[1:07:55] the earth now. Amen. The message of the
[1:07:58] hour. Amen. It must be on display in our
[1:08:02] flesh. Amen. Paul said, "Ye are our
[1:08:04] epistle written in our hearts. You are
[1:08:06] known and you are read of all men."
[1:08:10] For as much as ye are manifestly
[1:08:12] declared to be the epistle of Christ,
[1:08:15] amen, ministered by us, written not with
[1:08:18] ink, but with the spirit of the living
[1:08:20] God. Amen. Not in tables of stone, but
[1:08:24] in the fleshly tables of the heart.
[1:08:27] Brother said, God didn't put you here,
[1:08:30] amen, to work in a factory just alone.
[1:08:32] But he put you here as a testimony, a
[1:08:35] written epistle read of all men to live
[1:08:38] an honorable and a decent life and a hid
[1:08:41] consecrated life with God. So that men
[1:08:44] would know, amen, that Jesus Christ
[1:08:47] still lives and reigns. Amen. Think
[1:08:50] about that. He said, "If you are the
[1:08:52] salt of the earth, then you've got to
[1:08:54] live such a life." Amen. A written
[1:08:56] epistle. Amen. Till all men know what
[1:08:59] you are. Another place that we should
[1:09:01] live the right kind of a life. Because
[1:09:04] you see, there's so many people that
[1:09:07] will never take time to read the Bible.
[1:09:09] Amen. But they will read you. That's a
[1:09:13] powerful one. They will never read the
[1:09:15] Bible, but they will read you. Amen. So
[1:09:18] that tells me you are, amen, a written
[1:09:21] Bible. Amen. Reflecting the life of
[1:09:24] Jesus Christ. He said that is your life.
[1:09:27] It must read so loud to the public until
[1:09:30] your testimony. Amen. If it's contrary
[1:09:33] to your life, Amen. It is without any
[1:09:36] effect. Amen. If your testimony is
[1:09:39] contrary to your life, it is without any
[1:09:42] effect. He said, "So just keep on mind
[1:09:45] that we're bringing influences every
[1:09:48] day. And the life that you live, Amen,
[1:09:51] proves what's on the inside of you. You
[1:09:54] cannot change that." See, now listen
[1:09:56] what a prophet said. Every person, amen,
[1:09:59] reflects outside, amen, what he is
[1:10:02] inside. Amen. So somebody take that
[1:10:05] scripture and say, "Well, Amen. God
[1:10:07] don't care about the outside. Amen. He
[1:10:09] looks on the inside." Well, that's the
[1:10:11] truth when you're choosing a king. Amen.
[1:10:14] But you can't take that all the way and
[1:10:15] dismiss holiness. Amen. Because Paul
[1:10:18] said, "Amen. Holiness without." Amen. No
[1:10:21] man shall see the Lord. And I know it
[1:10:23] ain't popular no more. Amen. To open
[1:10:25] this blessed book and to take a sermon
[1:10:28] on holiness. Amen. But you're looking at
[1:10:30] one preacher that's not a hire. You
[1:10:32] didn't hire me, so you can't fire me.
[1:10:34] I've been called of God to say what a
[1:10:36] prophet said. And if we're going to
[1:10:38] claim to be message believers, if we're
[1:10:40] going to claim to be the children of
[1:10:41] God, I think there ought to be a life on
[1:10:44] the inside of our souls that ought to be
[1:10:46] bearing witness on the outside that we
[1:10:48] have passed from the realms of
[1:10:50] worldlyism and from the realms of
[1:10:52] Hollywood into the realm of almighty God
[1:10:55] where the Holy Ghost can find a place.
[1:10:57] Amen. To influence sinners and to
[1:11:00] influence unbelievers.
[1:11:02] Yes, sir. You say, "What are you getting
[1:11:03] at?" I'll say what I'm getting at. The
[1:11:05] beauty of the church, amen, is not the
[1:11:07] building.
[1:11:09] Come on, folks. It's Sunday morning. We
[1:11:11] might as well preach. Amen. You got up
[1:11:13] out of bed and got ready, so we might as
[1:11:14] well have church. The beauty of the
[1:11:16] church, Amen, is not the building. Amen.
[1:11:20] I don't want to I don't want to make you
[1:11:21] mad, but the beauty of the church is not
[1:11:23] the carpet and it's not the pews and
[1:11:26] Amen. It's not the abilities. The beauty
[1:11:29] of the church is the character of the
[1:11:32] people. I love how the prophet of God
[1:11:34] will talk about in in the 1960s. He
[1:11:36] said, "There I was preaching here the
[1:11:38] other day in the tabernacle." And he
[1:11:40] said, "I was going through town and I
[1:11:41] stopped down here at the restaurant and
[1:11:43] I stopped over here at the motel." And
[1:11:45] he said, "All the owners were
[1:11:47] commenting, amen, on the people that
[1:11:49] were coming to town for my meetings." He
[1:11:52] said they were talking about how they
[1:11:54] all filled up their restaurants and they
[1:11:56] booked all their hotels. And brother
[1:11:58] said, I asked him, I said, "Well, I'm
[1:12:00] sorry. that's probably costing you
[1:12:01] money, isn't it? He said, "No, brother
[1:12:03] Brandon." He said, "We're honored to
[1:12:05] have your people here." He said,
[1:12:06] "Because the testimony they carry."
[1:12:09] Amen. He said, "They don't leave nothing
[1:12:10] undone." And oh my well, we might as
[1:12:13] well just preach. And oh, he said, "They
[1:12:15] take care of things." And he said,
[1:12:16] "They're responsible." Re said, "Oh, to
[1:12:19] me, Amen. You're the salt of the earth."
[1:12:22] He said, "I'm so grateful to know that I
[1:12:24] have the privilege of preaching to
[1:12:26] people that even sinners." Now, I don't
[1:12:28] say these people are sinners, but I mean
[1:12:30] people that business and so forth can
[1:12:33] say you're a nice people and they
[1:12:35] appreciate you in their business and
[1:12:37] around their places. You know, that's
[1:12:39] being salty. Amen. I appreciate that
[1:12:42] your behavior. Amen. The way you take
[1:12:45] care of things. Amen. Now, listen. It
[1:12:47] does not say, Brother David, that the
[1:12:49] owner said, "Man, your people was down
[1:12:51] here and they left a hundred books in
[1:12:53] our hotel rooms and they filled up our
[1:12:55] restaurant tables with witnessing
[1:12:56] cards." The the prophet said, "I might
[1:13:00] as well preach." Amen. The prophet said,
[1:13:02] "The way they were conducting themselves
[1:13:04] and the way they were living was a
[1:13:06] testimony of the message that you're
[1:13:09] preaching." Listen, friends, it's time,
[1:13:11] amen, to make sure that our lives, amen,
[1:13:14] are matching our testimony. You say,
[1:13:17] "Well, Brother Andrew, I made a mistake
[1:13:18] and I made I'm not talking about that.
[1:13:20] I'm talking about when the dust settles
[1:13:23] and the smoke clears. Let's make sure
[1:13:25] we've got more than just a good feeling
[1:13:27] on Sunday morning. Let's make sure we
[1:13:29] got more than just a goosebump at a
[1:13:31] convention. Let's make sure that on the
[1:13:34] depths of our soul has come the seal of
[1:13:37] the almighty God. We don't belong to
[1:13:40] this world. Therefore, we don't walk
[1:13:41] like this world. We don't talk like this
[1:13:44] world. We don't look like this world. We
[1:13:46] have come from another dimension. We are
[1:13:49] sons and daughters of God.
[1:13:52] Yes, sir. You say, "Well, I got
[1:13:54] influence." Well, let me say this. The
[1:13:55] prophet of God breaks it down very
[1:13:57] beautiful. He said, "Influences come
[1:13:59] from somewhere." Y'all know that. Amen.
[1:14:02] Influences has a source. The prophet of
[1:14:05] God said, "Listen," he said, "the way
[1:14:07] you're either influenced, you mortal
[1:14:08] beings, you're either influenced from
[1:14:10] this away or from that away." Now, can I
[1:14:14] preach a minute? You cannot be here a
[1:14:17] spiritual being,
[1:14:19] sinner or saint, without having an
[1:14:22] influence from the underworld or from
[1:14:25] the above world. So influence is coming
[1:14:29] from the underworld. Let's just get it
[1:14:31] out there. Hell
[1:14:33] or from the above world, which is
[1:14:36] heaven. He said if you're influenced
[1:14:38] from here, then you're from above. See,
[1:14:41] your celestial body is waiting up here.
[1:14:44] But if you're wicked and hypocritical
[1:14:46] and indifferent, then your celestial
[1:14:49] body is down here. Regardless of how
[1:14:52] much, Amen. that you think it's up there
[1:14:55] because the fruit that you bear before
[1:14:57] people proves where you're from. So you
[1:15:01] are here what you are somewhere else.
[1:15:04] Your life, what you live here is just
[1:15:07] reflecting what your inheritance is when
[1:15:10] you leave here. How many knows a prophet
[1:15:12] said that when a person dies, amen, it
[1:15:15] doesn't change what you are. It only
[1:15:18] changes your dwelling place. Now listen,
[1:15:20] the prophet of God said, "So what's
[1:15:22] happened is the lid has come off of hell
[1:15:25] and demon powers are streaming up, amen,
[1:15:29] out of the influence of hell." And he
[1:15:31] said, "The whole air has become
[1:15:33] contaminated with the powers of the
[1:15:36] underworld, with the powers of
[1:15:38] darkness." Another place he said the
[1:15:40] sinner, amen, is influenced by a spirit.
[1:15:43] Amen. Because he has a spirit and the
[1:15:47] wrong influence and the right gives
[1:15:49] influence. And those who are dominated,
[1:15:51] amen, with blackness and separation are
[1:15:54] dominated from the underworld of devils.
[1:15:58] So there is an above world and there is
[1:16:00] an underworld. And the prophet of God
[1:16:03] said, you're caught in between. And the
[1:16:05] life that you're living is declaring
[1:16:08] where your influence is coming from.
[1:16:10] Now, come on, somebody say, "Well, Amen.
[1:16:12] I don't think influence really can
[1:16:13] affect somebody." Oh, it will. Amen.
[1:16:15] Amen. We got a bunch of teenagers around
[1:16:17] here. Amen. You just start listening to
[1:16:19] something and before long, we don't have
[1:16:22] to ask.
[1:16:23] Come on, y'all might as well loosen up.
[1:16:25] I'm going to preach. Amen. You take a
[1:16:27] boy and he gets to he gets to listen to
[1:16:28] country music and and feeding on country
[1:16:30] music. Amen. boy ain't never wore a pair
[1:16:32] of boots in his life, but all of a
[1:16:34] sudden he's got boots and a cowboy hat.
[1:16:36] He's walking around 10 feet tall. Amen.
[1:16:39] Because he's under the influence of what
[1:16:41] he's listening to. You take a kid
[1:16:43] listening to rap music. Amen. All of a
[1:16:45] sudden, they start looking like it,
[1:16:46] acting like it, and talking like it
[1:16:48] because it's the influence that they're
[1:16:50] under. You take a girl, amen, that
[1:16:53] starts flirting with the world and
[1:16:54] looking at Hollywood before long makeup
[1:16:56] starts coming back and before long
[1:16:58] splits and short dresses. Come on,
[1:17:00] church. We might as well preach. Amen.
[1:17:02] Start coming back. Amen. Because the lid
[1:17:05] has come off of hell. And the only thing
[1:17:07] standing between you and the angel of
[1:17:10] destruction is the fact that God has
[1:17:13] sent a token message in this hour that
[1:17:15] will separate you from the influence of
[1:17:18] the world and will place you as a son
[1:17:20] and daughter of almighty God. Now, amen.
[1:17:24] I just got to say what the prophet said.
[1:17:26] Amen. I was listening to this a while
[1:17:27] back. Remember said there I was. He said
[1:17:29] as a little boy, he said I got hurt. And
[1:17:31] he said I went into the regions of the
[1:17:33] lost. And he said I saw hell. Remember
[1:17:35] that?
[1:17:36] He said they were crying, they were
[1:17:38] weeping, they were whailing, there was
[1:17:40] nashing of teeth. He said I looked and
[1:17:42] there was no mama there. He said I
[1:17:44] looked, there was no daddy there. He
[1:17:46] said I looked and the worst of it all,
[1:17:48] Amen, was there was no God there. He
[1:17:50] said, now what I saw, Amen, I saw the
[1:17:53] very influence of hell upon the people
[1:17:57] that was in it. He said, "When I got out
[1:17:59] of there," he said, "God, don't ever let
[1:18:02] me go back to that place." Now, I know
[1:18:04] it's not popular no more, amen, to
[1:18:06] preach on this, amen, but somewhere or
[1:18:08] another, we got to let the rubber hit
[1:18:10] the road. And remember, there's only two
[1:18:12] destinations. There's not a purgatory.
[1:18:15] There's a heaven to gain, and there's a
[1:18:17] hell to shun. Listen. And anybody that
[1:18:20] says anything different is not saying
[1:18:22] what this Bible said. This Bible said it
[1:18:24] is appointed unto man once to die. and
[1:18:28] after that the judgment. Listen, I thank
[1:18:30] God this morning that we can gather
[1:18:32] together in a church of the living God
[1:18:35] and can feel the influence, oh the sweet
[1:18:38] influences of the presence of almighty
[1:18:40] God. And somebody sitting right here
[1:18:42] this morning could receive something
[1:18:44] from God that would change your eternal
[1:18:47] destination, that would change you from
[1:18:49] a path of destruction. It would change
[1:18:51] you from a path of perversion. It would
[1:18:54] change you from a path that was leading
[1:18:56] to that place that a prophet said
[1:18:57] whatever you do don't go there.
[1:19:01] Now I love it because he makes it very
[1:19:02] plain. He says now you wonder what I saw
[1:19:05] there. He said I come back and he said
[1:19:09] there I was standing in JC Penney
[1:19:12] and he said there were people walking
[1:19:14] around and he said some of them had
[1:19:15] purple eyes and some of them had blue
[1:19:17] eyes and he said they had all kinds of
[1:19:19] colors on their eye. He said, "But while
[1:19:21] I was looking at him," he said, "I heard
[1:19:23] a voice say, "Amen. This is what you
[1:19:25] already saw." He said, "Now here I was
[1:19:29] back in hell again." Now, come on,
[1:19:32] church. He was not in the pits of hell.
[1:19:35] He was standing in JC Penney.
[1:19:40] Now, I I know I know some of you
[1:19:42] brothers might get that credit card bill
[1:19:44] and think that place is from the pits of
[1:19:45] hell after your wife went shopping. And
[1:19:49] it's always amazed me. You you buy
[1:19:51] something, Brother Joe, and they tell
[1:19:52] you, you say $562, you know, well, I
[1:19:55] never was planning on spending the $562.
[1:20:00] Another sermon for another day. But
[1:20:02] they're standing there and he's looking
[1:20:04] and it's literally in hell. But he's not
[1:20:08] in hell to see hell. Hell's influence
[1:20:11] has taken on flesh. Let me say this. We
[1:20:14] are influenced by the environment that
[1:20:16] we live in. Brother said, "See like you
[1:20:18] live in the desert." Amen. It has an
[1:20:21] influence on your body. You see what it
[1:20:23] was when we become a Christian. Amen.
[1:20:25] The influence environment influences us.
[1:20:28] He said, "Now you just keep holding
[1:20:29] around with that kind of environment.
[1:20:32] It'll influence you and the first thing
[1:20:34] you know, you become a part of that
[1:20:37] environment." He said, "What happens is
[1:20:40] you just go right into it." He said just
[1:20:42] like a good clean man that's clean and
[1:20:45] moral but he begins to associate with a
[1:20:47] bunch of people who's not. He said see
[1:20:50] you take up oh God you take up the
[1:20:53] spirit of that. Listen you take up the
[1:20:56] spirit and everything is governed by a
[1:20:59] spirit.
[1:21:02] Now that's why the prophet said we are
[1:21:04] to discern and to try the spirits. Now I
[1:21:07] just got to say this. I believe as
[1:21:09] believers that our influence should not
[1:21:12] be coming from the underworld. I don't
[1:21:14] believe, amen, that our girls should be
[1:21:16] looking like JC Penney. What a prophet
[1:21:19] seen there. I don't think our boys
[1:21:21] should be looking like Hollywood stars.
[1:21:23] I believe the believer's influence is
[1:21:26] the word. The prophet of God said, "Let
[1:21:29] nothing be influence us but the word of
[1:21:31] God." See, amen. That is our influence.
[1:21:35] I want to say this. Whatever is
[1:21:37] influencing you has the preeminence of
[1:21:40] you, it has consumed you. Amen. But I'll
[1:21:44] say what the Bible said in Colossians
[1:21:46] 1:18, that Christ is the head of the
[1:21:48] body, the church, who is the beginning,
[1:21:51] who is the firstborn from the dead, that
[1:21:54] in all things he might have the
[1:21:56] preeminence. in the message to token
[1:21:59] 1963 he said I believe that we're now at
[1:22:02] the time that the word should have
[1:22:05] preeminence I believe that the time to
[1:22:08] lay aside our creeds and lay aside our
[1:22:11] thoughts and come back to the word I'll
[1:22:15] say this it's not just coming back to
[1:22:18] the Bible it's not just coming back and
[1:22:20] carrying the Bible it's coming to the
[1:22:22] revelation of the word which the
[1:22:25] revelation of the Word should take the
[1:22:28] preeminence in the body. Let me say
[1:22:30] this. Revelation is not education. Amen.
[1:22:33] Revelation is not head knowledge.
[1:22:35] Revelation is not a bunch of ideas put
[1:22:38] together. Revelation is spiritfilled
[1:22:41] truth. Brother said it very beautiful.
[1:22:44] He said, "Now here's what I want to tell
[1:22:45] you. The spirit of God makes the
[1:22:48] difference."
[1:22:50] How many agrees? Amen. The spirit of God
[1:22:53] makes the difference. He said, "Now the
[1:22:55] church without the spirit, amen, is
[1:22:58] nothing but the world with God's name
[1:23:01] attached to it." That's why Paul said in
[1:23:03] Ephesians 5:18, he said, "Be not drunk
[1:23:06] with wine wherein is excess, but be
[1:23:09] filled with the spirit." Rebraham said,
[1:23:11] "Look why it's no wonder that
[1:23:13] Christianity is at one of its lowest es.
[1:23:17] the influence that the church people has
[1:23:20] placed upon the men that hasn't received
[1:23:23] Christ. Men wants to maintain their
[1:23:25] testimony and then live any way they
[1:23:28] want to. Amen. But that's the reason
[1:23:30] here a prophet that's the reason brother
[1:23:32] Brian that the Holy Spirit is such a
[1:23:36] must, a definite must in this day
[1:23:40] because it's the one that lives your
[1:23:42] life. You don't live it yourself. It's
[1:23:45] Christ in you. Then after you receive
[1:23:48] the Holy Spirit, if he doesn't have the
[1:23:51] preeminence in your life, then you just
[1:23:53] remember you haven't received the Holy
[1:23:57] Ghost. Cuz if he is in you, are you
[1:23:59] hearing me? Then he will live his own
[1:24:02] life. You're no more your own. When the
[1:24:06] Holy Ghost comes in, the Holy Ghost
[1:24:09] takes the preeminence in your life and
[1:24:12] you're no more your own. He said, "See,
[1:24:15] you are dead and your life is hidden God
[1:24:17] through Christ and you are sealed, amen,
[1:24:20] by the Holy Ghost. So there is no way at
[1:24:23] all for you to be yourself more what you
[1:24:27] were." Oh, glory. If a man ever gets the
[1:24:31] Holy Ghost, he no longer desires, Amen.
[1:24:35] to be what he was because there's been a
[1:24:38] change on the control tower of his soul.
[1:24:41] You say, "What is the Holy Ghost? Is it
[1:24:44] a shout? Is it a goosebump? Is it a good
[1:24:47] feeling? Is it a dance? The Holy Ghost
[1:24:50] is the influence of God that moves in
[1:24:52] the soul of a man and feels every fiber
[1:24:55] of his being and begins to guide him and
[1:24:59] govern him.
[1:25:01] Now, I know it's an age where nobody
[1:25:03] wants governors.
[1:25:05] Nobody wants nothing to check them.
[1:25:07] Nobody wants nobody to say anything
[1:25:09] about anything, you know. Amen. We just
[1:25:10] all got to we just all got to stay. No,
[1:25:13] we got to stand on the principles of the
[1:25:14] word of God. And the prophet of God
[1:25:16] said, "The Holy Spirit is the efficient
[1:25:19] source of any power, affection," Amen.
[1:25:23] emotion or desire. Now, I want to say
[1:25:25] this. Amen. God puts the desire there.
[1:25:28] Ain't that powerful? Amen. God puts the
[1:25:31] desire there. And when God puts that
[1:25:33] desire there, Brother Tom, he has a
[1:25:36] motive in putting it there. And he has
[1:25:39] the ability to produce it. I want to say
[1:25:42] this. The Apostle Paul says it like
[1:25:44] this. He says, "I keep under my body and
[1:25:48] bring it into subjection, lest by any
[1:25:50] means when I have preached to others
[1:25:53] that I myself should be a cast away."
[1:25:56] But remember said, "Especially after you
[1:25:58] have said and made your confession that
[1:26:00] you are a Christian," Amen. the people
[1:26:03] will want you that much more closer.
[1:26:07] Oh, mercy. And then that gives an
[1:26:10] influence to the people that's around
[1:26:12] about you. And we should watch what we
[1:26:15] do.
[1:26:18] We should watch what we say
[1:26:21] because if we produce the wrong
[1:26:23] influence, then we bring reproach not so
[1:26:26] much upon ourselves but upon what we
[1:26:29] claim to be, which is Christians. We
[1:26:32] bring it up on Christ. And no one if we
[1:26:34] would think you would never want to
[1:26:36] bring reproach upon Christ. But the
[1:26:39] wrong act at the wrong time will
[1:26:42] certainly cause a wrong reflection
[1:26:45] towards the person that's watching you.
[1:26:48] And everybody is watched especially when
[1:26:51] you profess to be a Christian. Now I
[1:26:54] want to say something very openly here.
[1:26:56] Amen. We're everyone human and we've
[1:26:59] everyone made mistakes and we've
[1:27:01] everyone got faults and failures. But I
[1:27:03] want to say this, the message of the
[1:27:05] hour, it must be more than a head
[1:27:07] knowledge. It must be a revelation. I'll
[1:27:11] say this, Satan don't mind you. Amen.
[1:27:14] Having the message. He does not want the
[1:27:17] message having an effect in and through
[1:27:19] you. Amen. That's why, Amen. the devil
[1:27:22] does everything he can, amen, to point
[1:27:25] out every fault and to show every
[1:27:27] mistake and to bring every little
[1:27:29] problem into our sight in the church is
[1:27:32] because the devil knows that Grace
[1:27:34] Tabernacle is not here just to be
[1:27:37] another church. We're not here just to
[1:27:39] be another building. But Jesus Christ,
[1:27:41] who is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:27:45] forever, has raised this church up to be
[1:27:48] an influence, to be a place where he can
[1:27:51] work through, where he can manifest
[1:27:53] himself through. And if the devil can
[1:27:55] get us under the wrong influence, now
[1:27:58] I'm going to say something, okay? Amen.
[1:28:00] What we say ought to be seasoned with
[1:28:02] the Holy Spirit.
[1:28:06] Now, I've seen people and all they do is
[1:28:08] talk about every problem in the church
[1:28:10] and everybody that done everything and
[1:28:11] every little funny thing and
[1:28:14] come on. I I've seen I've seen with my
[1:28:16] own eyes. I've seen people everything
[1:28:18] they talk about God is always connected
[1:28:20] to some little joke or some little humor
[1:28:22] or some little funny something. And now
[1:28:24] they got teenagers that ain't got a bit
[1:28:27] of interest in the house of God because
[1:28:29] all they know about church is the funny
[1:28:31] way brother so and so did this and the
[1:28:33] silly way somebody did that and the way
[1:28:35] somebody offended somebody. Hey, but
[1:28:38] listen. Amen. The Come on, church. It's
[1:28:40] not the worm on the outside that
[1:28:42] destroys the apple. It's the worm on the
[1:28:45] inside that destroys its own apple. And
[1:28:48] I pray God send the Holy Ghost into
[1:28:50] every one of our souls from the pulpit
[1:28:52] to the back door and send the Holy Ghost
[1:28:55] bridal upon our tongues. And let the
[1:28:57] Holy Ghost bridle the things we say.
[1:28:59] Come on. I know. Amen. Somebody said,
[1:29:01] "Well, ain't nobody going to check what
[1:29:02] I'm going to say." I say we need a
[1:29:04] filter back in every one of our mouths.
[1:29:07] Amen. Back in every one of our young
[1:29:08] people that we filter what we say before
[1:29:10] we say it because it's having an
[1:29:12] influence.
[1:29:14] Well, you might as well preach. I'm
[1:29:16] going to preach. Amen. It's having an
[1:29:18] influence and we've everyone made
[1:29:20] mistakes. Amen. We've everyone fell
[1:29:22] short. But somewhere or another, if
[1:29:24] we're going to keep building, if we're
[1:29:26] going to keep growing, Amen. Quit
[1:29:28] letting everything everybody hears about
[1:29:29] your church be some funny something or
[1:29:32] or somebody. Amen. I say throw all that
[1:29:34] away and bring back the sincerity and
[1:29:37] the truth and the joy in serving God.
[1:29:41] Yes, sir. Amen. I'll tell you what,
[1:29:42] Grace Tabernacle, we got a beautiful
[1:29:44] building. We got a beautiful sign out
[1:29:46] there. We got a beautiful group of
[1:29:48] people sitting here. But the best
[1:29:50] influence of this church is not that
[1:29:52] sign on the road.
[1:29:55] Come on, church. Brother said there was
[1:29:57] a boy come in the barroom one day and he
[1:29:59] told the bartender, he said, "Sir," he
[1:30:02] said, "you're your sign is down."
[1:30:04] Brother said, the bartender said, "Thank
[1:30:06] you." So he went out there, bro, Peter,
[1:30:08] he took his he took his apron up and he
[1:30:10] dusted the bar sign off. He come back in
[1:30:12] there. He said, "No, boy." He said, "My
[1:30:15] sign's fine." He said, "Just had a
[1:30:17] little dust on it." But boy said, "I'm
[1:30:19] sorry, sir." Amen. I didn't mean that
[1:30:21] sign. I meant your best sign. He said,
[1:30:23] "Well, that's the best sign I got." He
[1:30:26] said, "No, sir." He said, "The best sign
[1:30:28] you got is the drunk that's laying down
[1:30:31] there in the gutter because he's under
[1:30:33] the influence of what you're selling on
[1:30:35] the inside." And when we see a man under
[1:30:38] the influence of the Holy Spirit until
[1:30:41] his life is burning with an
[1:30:42] old-fashioned Pentecostal fire, that's
[1:30:45] the best sign ever. Let God save the man
[1:30:48] when he will serve. It's the best sign.
[1:30:52] Oh, I say God. Amen. Let every one of
[1:30:54] our signs become more than just church
[1:30:57] signs. Let them become the best signs.
[1:30:59] Let our young people be the best signs
[1:31:02] of Grace Tabernacle. Let our marriages,
[1:31:04] let our families, let our preachers, let
[1:31:07] our Hallelujah. Let our musicians be the
[1:31:11] best sign of the church of the living
[1:31:13] God.
[1:31:14] You say, "What are you talking about?
[1:31:16] The best sign of the message?" I'll tell
[1:31:18] you what the best sign of the message is
[1:31:20] is a believer under the influence of
[1:31:23] what it speaks of.
[1:31:27] This okay, pastor. uh the believer under
[1:31:31] the influence.
[1:31:34] Now you say, "What is the message?" I'll
[1:31:36] say this. It ain't a bunch of preachers
[1:31:41] and it ain't a bunch of personalities
[1:31:43] and it ain't a bunch of better eyes and
[1:31:45] little 's. The message is an
[1:31:48] announcement from God that he is
[1:31:50] fulfilling his word. I love what Peter
[1:31:53] said in Acts two. Brother, brother
[1:31:55] brother Maddie stood up with the 11 and
[1:31:58] he lifted up his voice and he said unto
[1:32:01] them, "Ye men of Judah and all who dwell
[1:32:03] at Jerusalem, be this known unto you and
[1:32:06] hearken to my words. For these are not
[1:32:11] drunk," oh God, for these are not drunk
[1:32:16] as ye suppose, seeing it is, but the
[1:32:19] third hour of the day. Can I say this?
[1:32:23] But this is that.
[1:32:26] Somebody say, "This
[1:32:28] is that which was spoken by the prophet
[1:32:33] Joel." But remember said, "This is that
[1:32:35] which was spoken of." See, right back to
[1:32:38] the word again, showing that the spirit
[1:32:42] is still word and the word is still
[1:32:45] spirit, the word of God. So folks, the
[1:32:48] message is more than just a bunch of
[1:32:50] preachers. It's more than just people
[1:32:52] wearing suits and ties and a bunch of
[1:32:55] religious folks. And y'all heard me say
[1:32:57] it before. I'm gonna say it again. I'm
[1:32:59] done with religion.
[1:33:01] I'm done with religion. And I'm done
[1:33:03] with religious spirits are some of the
[1:33:05] most evil, most corrupt spirits you'll
[1:33:07] ever meet. I don't want a religion. I
[1:33:10] want a revelation. Because religion
[1:33:12] produces division. And religion produces
[1:33:15] respective persons. And religion
[1:33:17] produces big eyes's and little 's. You
[1:33:20] don't know what I know and you ain't
[1:33:22] done what I done. But you know what
[1:33:23] Revelation does? It gets everybody drunk
[1:33:26] the same way.
[1:33:28] Glory. The Bible said in Revelation 6, I
[1:33:32] heard a voice when the third seal was
[1:33:34] open, and that voice said, "See thou,
[1:33:37] hurt not the oil."
[1:33:40] Hurt not the oil and hurt not the wine.
[1:33:43] Amen. Now, somebody say, "Goodness
[1:33:46] gracious, a preacher preaching about
[1:33:49] oil." Well, that's one thing, but you
[1:33:52] start talking about wine.
[1:33:56] Yeah, that fix a lot of our problems is
[1:33:58] some wine.
[1:34:01] But not the kind you pay $1,000 for to
[1:34:03] put in your refrigerator and drink when
[1:34:05] your so-called stomach hurts.
[1:34:09] Come on, somebody. Amen. The wine of the
[1:34:12] word of God. Oil represents the Holy
[1:34:15] Ghost and wine represents the
[1:34:17] stimulation of the revelation. He said
[1:34:20] when the truth of the promised word of
[1:34:22] God has been truly revealed to his
[1:34:24] saints that's filled with oil, they get
[1:34:27] stimulated. Amen. Wine is a stimulation.
[1:34:32] Glory. I feel it right now. Stimulated
[1:34:35] with joy and shouts. And when it does,
[1:34:38] it has the same effect upon them that
[1:34:41] wine does upon a natural man. Because
[1:34:44] when the revelation has been given of
[1:34:47] the truth of God and the true believer
[1:34:50] filled with oil and the revelation is
[1:34:52] revealed, the stimulation
[1:34:56] becomes so great that he makes him save
[1:35:00] himself unnormally.
[1:35:04] Well, glory to God. He said, "See, and
[1:35:07] that's what's the matter with them now.
[1:35:10] It's making them behave theirel
[1:35:15] unseemingly."
[1:35:17] Y'all remember Brother David Siler's
[1:35:18] sermon? We need a drunk church.
[1:35:22] Come on. I know we're trying to fix a
[1:35:24] lot of problems, but the way to fix it
[1:35:25] is get everybody drunk.
[1:35:29] Glory to God. Get everybody drunk again.
[1:35:32] And you get somebody drunk. Brother
[1:35:33] Harvey, they love everybody. Yeah. Come
[1:35:36] on. You want to fix your little ill
[1:35:38] feelings between you and somebody else?
[1:35:40] Get drunk one time and it'll fix that
[1:35:42] ill feeling.
[1:35:44] Well, glory to God. I'm going to preach
[1:35:46] or bust. Amen. You can't shout no more.
[1:35:48] Amen. Get drunk. You've been sober too
[1:35:50] long. You've been sober long enough to
[1:35:53] see everybody's problem and everybody's
[1:35:55] mistake. But what you need to do is
[1:35:57] somebody pass the bottle again in the
[1:36:00] house of God and get drunk on the word
[1:36:02] of God.
[1:36:05] Y'all know what a drunk man does? A
[1:36:07] drunk man gets drunk and starts thinking
[1:36:08] he can do things that nobody else knows
[1:36:10] he or thinks he can do.
[1:36:12] Y'all have heard me tell it before. I
[1:36:14] was a I was a little kid, brother
[1:36:16] brother Frank. I was a little kid. I
[1:36:17] don't know how old I was, but my
[1:36:18] great-grandfather picked me up from
[1:36:19] school and he there was a there was
[1:36:21] liquor store right across from the
[1:36:22] elementary school. Good combination,
[1:36:24] right? So, we're sitting there in the
[1:36:26] truck one day and he said, "Man, that's
[1:36:28] crazy. They got a liquor store there."
[1:36:30] And brother Jonah, there was a little
[1:36:31] old woman. She was all about 5' three or
[1:36:33] 4 foot three. I mean, she was little
[1:36:35] nothing. And she about as big as I don't
[1:36:38] know what, probably a toothpick. And
[1:36:40] brother Mash, she come out there
[1:36:42] carrying two big old banks and she's
[1:36:44] walking like this. And I never will
[1:36:46] forget it. My granddaddy looked over at
[1:36:48] me. He said, "I'll tell you what she
[1:36:49] going to do, son. She going to go home
[1:36:51] and drink all that and she going to get
[1:36:53] so drunk she'll lay in the floor and
[1:36:55] she'll stare at that wall and say, "I'll
[1:36:57] climb it if it takes me all night.
[1:37:01] Now you're laughing at that. Amen. But
[1:37:04] you know what? That could fix some
[1:37:05] problems in this church. Just let it be
[1:37:07] spiritual wine.
[1:37:09] Come out carrying two bags. The Old
[1:37:12] Testament and the New Testament. Come
[1:37:14] out carrying the promises of God. And
[1:37:16] look at every devil and say, "I'll whip
[1:37:19] you if it's the last thing I do. I'll
[1:37:21] whip that perversion. I'll whip that
[1:37:23] alcohol. I'll whip that pornography.
[1:37:26] I'll whip that drug. I'll whip that
[1:37:28] lust. I'll whip that cigarette. I'll
[1:37:30] whip that devil. I'll whip that
[1:37:32] depression. I'll whip that complex. I'll
[1:37:35] whip that suicidal devil. I'll whip that
[1:37:37] old ungodly, anxiety, nervous devil that
[1:37:40] has crawled up out of the pits of hell.
[1:37:42] If it's the last thing I do, I have been
[1:37:44] anointed under the influence of the word
[1:37:47] of God.
[1:37:49] Hallelujah. The world is under the
[1:37:52] influence of darkness, but the bride
[1:37:57] is under the influence of light.
[1:38:02] Now, get get drunk. Not only do you love
[1:38:06] everybody, but you start claiming stuff.
[1:38:10] Y'all have heard this before.
[1:38:13] Get a man drunk in somebody else's
[1:38:14] house. That's my pickup.
[1:38:19] That's my refrigerator.
[1:38:21] That's my gun.
[1:38:24] That's my television that shouldn't be
[1:38:25] there.
[1:38:29] Well, they going quiet on that one.
[1:38:32] Come on. Amen. He starts claiming stuff
[1:38:36] because he's underneath the influence.
[1:38:38] He's under an intoxication. Oh, church
[1:38:41] of the living God. What would happen if
[1:38:44] we would get so drunk on the Holy Ghost
[1:38:46] that we would start claiming our
[1:38:47] children and we would start claiming our
[1:38:49] families and we would start claiming our
[1:38:51] revival and we would start claiming
[1:38:53] peace and joy. What would happen in this
[1:38:55] church if we would get so drunk? We
[1:38:57] would start claiming restoration for
[1:39:00] every person.
[1:39:02] Hallelujah. I'm not backing up to that
[1:39:03] devil. What would happen if we would get
[1:39:06] so influenced on the message of the hour
[1:39:09] that we would begin to incl.
[1:39:13] Now, I'll just say this. The message is
[1:39:16] here.
[1:39:17] We're not looking for a message. We have
[1:39:20] a message. I I'll say this. And the
[1:39:22] message is the revelation.
[1:39:26] The Holy Ghost is the oil and the wine
[1:39:30] is here to stimulate the believer. Now,
[1:39:33] I know sometimes we say things and maybe
[1:39:35] some of you here this morning are not
[1:39:36] familiar with maybe the some of the
[1:39:37] things I'm saying and that's okay. But
[1:39:39] we say things about about a prophet and
[1:39:41] about about brother Brandham and things
[1:39:43] about that. I want to say this and many
[1:39:45] times because of the influence from the
[1:39:47] underworld, people have began to label
[1:39:50] us a cult or they've labeled us a bunch
[1:39:52] of man followers or then they'll call
[1:39:54] you brandites or all these other things.
[1:39:56] And let me just say this, I'm not a
[1:39:58] brand. I'm a Christian.
[1:40:01] Hello. I'm a son of God. I'm a child of
[1:40:03] God. I'm not following a bunch of a
[1:40:06] bunch of personalities. I'm following
[1:40:08] the word revealed by a prophet. You say,
[1:40:10] "Now, have you got scripture on that?" I
[1:40:12] do. It's Acts the third or Amos the
[1:40:13] third chapter. Surely the Lord God will
[1:40:16] do nothing except he revealed his
[1:40:19] secrets unto his servants, the prophets.
[1:40:21] So, and I'll just say this rather than
[1:40:23] rather than living with all these
[1:40:25] questions. Amen. Sometime find somebody
[1:40:27] and just sit down and talk to them and
[1:40:29] say, "What do you mean by this?" And
[1:40:30] what do you mean by that? Amen. And whip
[1:40:32] that devil is trying to influence you to
[1:40:34] believe that this message is a bunch of
[1:40:36] cultist ideas and let him show you that
[1:40:39] it's coming from the Bible.
[1:40:42] Now, I don't have time this morning.
[1:40:43] Amen. Amen. To go through all the
[1:40:45] scriptures, but I just want to use this
[1:40:47] one this morning because we we have an
[1:40:49] event. I don't know if you can put that
[1:40:50] first picture up. Amen. We have an event
[1:40:53] that we talk about often. Amen. That
[1:40:55] happened in 1933 on the Ohio River. And
[1:40:58] there you will see that brother Brandham
[1:41:00] is baptizing people on the Ohio River in
[1:41:03] 1933. Now this is actually not the 17th
[1:41:07] person. Brother David, I found it
[1:41:09] amazing. This actually happened just a
[1:41:12] few days ago in 1933. On June the 11th,
[1:41:15] 1933, the prophet of God was baptizing
[1:41:18] the 17th person. And the person he was
[1:41:21] going to baptize was a man named Edward
[1:41:23] Calvin. Now that's not Edward. I believe
[1:41:25] that's a sister there. But he's about to
[1:41:27] baptize them. And and and there's news
[1:41:30] articles that show that there were
[1:41:32] thousands of believers, hundreds and
[1:41:33] thousands of believers standing at the
[1:41:36] foot of Spring Street. I've been there.
[1:41:37] You've probably been there yourself. You
[1:41:39] can drive right down there to the foot
[1:41:40] of Spring Street in Jeffersonville.
[1:41:42] There's the Ohio River. And they're
[1:41:43] baptizing. And Brother said like this.
[1:41:46] He said, "All of a sudden, that light
[1:41:47] came out of the skies as a pillar of
[1:41:50] fire." Brother Matt preached a beautiful
[1:41:51] sermon today on the pillar of fire. If
[1:41:52] you ain't heard it, go listen to it.
[1:41:54] Amen. the pillar of fire comes down. And
[1:41:56] he said there were some that ran. And he
[1:41:59] said there were some that stayed. Now I
[1:42:01] love this, brother Joel, because the
[1:42:03] ones that ran did not hear what the
[1:42:06] pillar of fire said. He said, "But those
[1:42:09] that stayed heard what it said." And
[1:42:12] here's what it said. As John the Baptist
[1:42:14] was sent to forerun the first coming of
[1:42:17] Christ, your message will forrun the
[1:42:20] second coming of Christ. Now, somebody
[1:42:22] say, "Amen. That's not scriptural. You
[1:42:24] cannot prove by the Bible that a pillar
[1:42:26] of fire come out of the skies and had a
[1:42:29] voice and spoke to a man on the river.
[1:42:31] But in Deuteronomy the 4th chapter and
[1:42:33] the 36th verse, it says, "Out of heaven
[1:42:37] he made thee to hear his voice that he
[1:42:39] might instruct thee, and upon earth he
[1:42:42] showed thee his great fire." Listen. And
[1:42:46] thou heardest his words.
[1:42:49] Oh, church. Thou heardest his words.
[1:42:52] Brother Bobby, out of the midst of the
[1:42:55] fire. Now, the prophet God said,
[1:42:57] "Listen, before I adjure you before
[1:42:59] Christ and you hold not your peace, but
[1:43:01] if you were spiritual, you would
[1:43:02] understand." Don't you know the very
[1:43:05] first thing he said down there on the
[1:43:07] river? Don't you remember what he said
[1:43:10] as John the Baptist was sent to forerun
[1:43:13] the first coming of Christ? Your
[1:43:15] message. Now, somebody say message. Yes,
[1:43:19] it's the message that will forrun the
[1:43:22] second coming of Christ. That's what the
[1:43:25] angel of the Lord said. Now, notice as
[1:43:28] John the Baptist, you all that have read
[1:43:30] the books, you've heard the people that
[1:43:31] was standing there hearing it and
[1:43:33] everything else. When that angel itself
[1:43:35] spoke that message as John the Baptist
[1:43:38] was sent to forerrun the first coming of
[1:43:42] Christ, you're sent with this message
[1:43:45] which will forrun the second coming of
[1:43:48] Christ. He said now the message he said
[1:43:51] and I believe that I have the message of
[1:43:55] the day. I believe that it is the light
[1:43:57] of the day and I believe it's pointing
[1:44:00] to that time coming. You see, I believe
[1:44:03] that the message that he said down
[1:44:05] there, it's the message that you have.
[1:44:08] So this morning, folks, we're not
[1:44:11] looking for a message. We're not looking
[1:44:14] for a message. As a matter of fact, we
[1:44:17] have a message.
[1:44:22] It's a vindicated message. Can I tell
[1:44:24] you something? It's the token message.
[1:44:28] Can I tell you something? It didn't come
[1:44:30] from the underworld, brother Charles. It
[1:44:32] come from the above world. It didn't say
[1:44:35] up out of hell came a light and spoke.
[1:44:38] It said out of heaven came a pillar of
[1:44:40] fire and it said these words. As John
[1:44:43] the Baptist was sent to forrun the first
[1:44:45] coming, your message will forrun the
[1:44:48] second coming. Oh, can I say this this
[1:44:50] morning? We ought to be eating this
[1:44:52] message. We ought to be endeavoring in
[1:44:54] this message because it's the token
[1:44:57] message.
[1:45:00] Now, Exodus 12 says this, "I will pass
[1:45:03] through the land of Egypt this night,
[1:45:06] and I will smite all the firstborn in
[1:45:08] the land of Egypt, both man and beast,
[1:45:12] and against all the gods of Egypt, I
[1:45:16] will execute judgment. I am the Lord."
[1:45:20] Now, listen to this. And the blood shall
[1:45:23] be to you for a token upon the houses
[1:45:27] where you are. Now, can I say what the
[1:45:29] Bible says? And when I see the blood,
[1:45:36] I will pass over you, and the plague
[1:45:40] shall not be upon you to destroy you
[1:45:43] when I smacked the land of Egypt. Look
[1:45:47] at this word token. It's a sign. It's a
[1:45:50] signal. It's a distinguishing mark. It's
[1:45:53] a banner. It's a remembrance. It's a
[1:45:55] warning. It's an in sign. It's a
[1:45:58] miracle. It's a proof. The prophet of
[1:46:00] God said, "What is a token? It's a sign
[1:46:03] of a fair price that has been paid." He
[1:46:07] said, "Now, Israel lamb slain was
[1:46:09] Jehovah's required token. It must be the
[1:46:12] blood." And God made a token and give it
[1:46:16] to Israel. Listen. and no other token
[1:46:20] will work.
[1:46:23] See, it cannot be recognized. Now, I
[1:46:25] love what the prophet says. He said, "To
[1:46:27] the world, the token is foolishness,
[1:46:31] but to God, brother Don, it's the only
[1:46:34] way." He said, "Then you are a possessor
[1:46:37] of the token which gives you the
[1:46:40] privilege of a free pass. When I see the
[1:46:44] blood, I will pass over you." What a
[1:46:47] time, what a privilege to know that you
[1:46:50] pack within you the past. Oh God, when
[1:46:54] you pack within you the past, he said,
[1:46:57] no matter how much righteous they was,
[1:47:00] how good they was, how much education
[1:47:02] they had, how they dressed, the token
[1:47:05] was the only thing. He said, now see,
[1:47:08] the blood was the token. Listen, the
[1:47:12] blood of the animal was the token in
[1:47:15] Israel's day, but the animal didn't have
[1:47:17] a soul.
[1:47:20] So, he could not come back upon the
[1:47:22] worshipper. But the prophet of God says,
[1:47:25] "But today, the token now is the
[1:47:28] baptism."
[1:47:32] Today, the token now is the baptism of
[1:47:36] the Holy Spirit. Listen. And the token
[1:47:39] must be on display. Now the token which
[1:47:44] is the life that was in Christ is now in
[1:47:47] those who are under the token. Now I
[1:47:52] want to say this to you because somebody
[1:47:53] might say why do you all emphasize so
[1:47:55] heavy on a message? Well the father of
[1:47:58] God said this. He said this is the
[1:48:00] evening time of the age. Amen. This is
[1:48:03] the evening time for the church. This is
[1:48:05] the evening time for me. Listen, this is
[1:48:08] the evening time of my message. I'm
[1:48:12] dying. I'm going. I'm moving out in the
[1:48:15] evening time of the gospel. And we've
[1:48:17] come up through justification and so
[1:48:19] forth. But this is the time that the
[1:48:23] token has to be applied. Now listen,
[1:48:26] animal blood couldn't come back upon the
[1:48:28] worshipper because the animal life did
[1:48:31] not have a soul.
[1:48:33] But now in this glorious place under
[1:48:37] this covenant, there is a difference
[1:48:39] between the blood and the life. The
[1:48:41] token for the believer today is the Holy
[1:48:45] Ghost. It's not a blood. It's not a
[1:48:48] chemistry. It's the Holy Spirit of God.
[1:48:51] That is the token that God requires for
[1:48:55] the church today. Listen. So the token
[1:48:58] which is the Holy Ghost is our
[1:49:01] identification. Oh, he says, "What a
[1:49:04] positive token." Amen. Now listen, what
[1:49:08] a positive token. He said, "There cannot
[1:49:11] be any more token if you could catch the
[1:49:14] thought of it. If I had the power this
[1:49:16] morning with words to express and place
[1:49:20] into your soul, on the inside of you,
[1:49:22] not your ears, but your soul, and you
[1:49:25] could see the guarantee of it." Amen. Oh
[1:49:30] church of the living God, this token is
[1:49:32] the bringing of a guarantee into the
[1:49:36] soul of a believer that when the death
[1:49:38] angel which is coming right now begins
[1:49:41] to pass through the land, there will be
[1:49:44] a people who is underneath the blood and
[1:49:47] the angel of death cannot cross over
[1:49:50] that blood.
[1:49:53] You would see the guarantee of it. Now,
[1:49:56] now can I preach a second?
[1:49:59] Is that okay?
[1:50:02] You would see it. You would see the
[1:50:05] guarantee of it.
[1:50:09] Can I say it? It would make you so
[1:50:12] relaxed.
[1:50:16] I don't think we got a problem with
[1:50:18] that.
[1:50:20] It's an age of relaxation. Yeah,
[1:50:24] under the token, brother Brian, it would
[1:50:26] make you so relaxed.
[1:50:29] But can I tell y'all something? There's
[1:50:31] a big difference in being relaxed and
[1:50:33] being lazy.
[1:50:37] So, I ask y'all if I could preach a
[1:50:39] second. There's a big difference in
[1:50:41] being relaxed
[1:50:44] and being lazy. You say, "There ain't a
[1:50:46] big difference." I took time to look it
[1:50:47] up. Relaxation and laziness, while both
[1:50:50] involving reduced activity, differ
[1:50:54] significantly in their nature and
[1:50:56] purpose. Relaxation is a state of
[1:50:59] restfulness, often actively chosen to
[1:51:02] recharge and recover from effort. While
[1:51:05] laziness is characterized,
[1:51:11] by a lack of motivation, all right, and
[1:51:14] unwillingness to exert effort even when
[1:51:17] tasks need to be done.
[1:51:21] Essentially, relaxation is a temporary
[1:51:24] state that can be beneficial while
[1:51:28] laziness is a more persistent pattern.
[1:51:35] of avoiding work or responsibility.
[1:51:41] Now I'm this close to it. I might as
[1:51:43] well preach.
[1:51:47] It's Father's Day.
[1:51:53] [Applause]
[1:51:56] Can I preach?
[1:51:59] They be glad their dad don't have the
[1:52:00] work effort they got.
[1:52:03] starve to death.
[1:52:06] [Music]
[1:52:07] Come on, folks. Video games till 12:00
[1:52:09] at night and 2 and 3 in the morning and
[1:52:11] texting. And
[1:52:13] come on, somebody. Amen. Face involved
[1:52:16] in everything.
[1:52:18] Well, we might as well preach it Sunday
[1:52:20] morning. Sleep half the day awake. Wake
[1:52:22] up at 3:00 and try to mow the yard. Come
[1:52:24] on now.
[1:52:26] Come on. Where would your family be if
[1:52:29] your daddy acted like that? I there
[1:52:31] you'd be. You'd be down there in the
[1:52:32] poverty line trying to find something to
[1:52:34] eat. Well, we're in the message and
[1:52:37] we're spiritual. Listen, the message
[1:52:39] didn't come to make us lazy. That
[1:52:41] devil's already been through the land
[1:52:42] and it didn't work. It was called 1977
[1:52:46] and the Lord is coming. So, let's sell
[1:52:48] everything we got. Let's quit our jobs,
[1:52:50] spend our 401ks because the Lord is
[1:52:52] coming in 1977. But I'll tell you what a
[1:52:55] prophet said. He said, "Is this okay? If
[1:52:58] you have the real revelation of the Holy
[1:53:00] Ghost in your soul, he said you'll be
[1:53:02] planting your potatoes on the morning of
[1:53:05] the rapture. He said, "And when the
[1:53:06] rapture happens, you will drop the hole
[1:53:09] and you'll take off with the Lord." This
[1:53:12] token message did not come to make a
[1:53:15] bunch of lazy church members just floss
[1:53:19] up in the clouds and don't have no
[1:53:21] ambition.
[1:53:22] Well, we might as well preach. It's time
[1:53:24] to be real displays of what character
[1:53:27] is.
[1:53:29] Come on. Well, brother Andrew, I don't
[1:53:31] think it matters. Amen. Amen. I tell you
[1:53:33] what don't matter, Amen. is your opinion
[1:53:35] and mine. But what does matter is the
[1:53:37] word.
[1:53:40] Yes, sir. Now, can I go on a step
[1:53:43] further?
[1:53:44] Laziness.
[1:53:46] And when it's in the natural.
[1:53:50] Oh, God. I
[1:53:52] have to pick this up later.
[1:53:55] When it's in the natural, it'll
[1:53:57] eventually show up in the spiritual.
[1:54:00] Yes, sir.
[1:54:02] When everything's left undone in the
[1:54:04] natural. Yes, sir.
[1:54:07] Before long, it's going to show up.
[1:54:10] I'm not going to preach all day. I may
[1:54:13] need bodyguard. Brother Morgan, you be
[1:54:14] my bodyguard today.
[1:54:16] Eventually, it's going to show up in the
[1:54:18] spiritual. Look at this. To choose now,
[1:54:21] now come on. You don't just become lazy.
[1:54:23] You choose it.
[1:54:25] [Music]
[1:54:28] To choose laziness is to escape.
[1:54:34] Oh God, I'm getting in trouble. Sure as
[1:54:37] the world. To choose laziness is to
[1:54:40] escape and give in to sympathy.
[1:54:47] Well, poor pitiful me.
[1:54:51] If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't
[1:54:53] have no luck at all. And if anything bad
[1:54:56] was going to happen to anybody, it's
[1:54:59] going to happen to me.
[1:55:02] [Applause]
[1:55:04] Are you going to church? Ain't no use in
[1:55:07] going because everything is going wrong
[1:55:09] and every problem and everything's
[1:55:11] getting better and I think I'm just
[1:55:12] gonna stay at home in bed in my pajamas
[1:55:15] and sleep till three o'clock and get up.
[1:55:17] Funny people can't go to church but
[1:55:19] they're ready to fellowship around 2:00.
[1:55:22] God, I guess it's the evangelist coming
[1:55:24] out. I don't know. Are you hearing me?
[1:55:27] You chose that lazy spirit and you just
[1:55:30] gave into it. But listen, relax means to
[1:55:33] rest, but actively engage. So if you're
[1:55:37] lazy, you just give into the excuse.
[1:55:39] Well, my daddy was this way and my
[1:55:41] grandpa was this way and my great great
[1:55:43] grandpa and great great great great
[1:55:44] great all the way back to Geronimo was
[1:55:47] this way. And because they were that
[1:55:48] way, I guess I'll be this way. I refuse
[1:55:52] to allow this token message to become a
[1:55:55] lazy message in the church of the living
[1:55:57] God. I don't care what your great
[1:55:59] grandpa was. I don't care what your
[1:56:01] great grandma was. If there's a gene
[1:56:03] seat of God in your soul, God has given
[1:56:05] you a sword and he's given you the
[1:56:07] strength and he's given you the ability
[1:56:09] to rise up and rebuke that lazy devil
[1:56:13] and start fighting back for the promises
[1:56:15] of God.
[1:56:18] Well, somebody shout, "Amen."
[1:56:21] It's a lazy devil to lay down and say,
[1:56:23] "Well, we got the message." And
[1:56:31] I'm just going to close right here.
[1:56:34] Brother Ben gets up here. Everybody
[1:56:36] happy to be in church tonight?
[1:56:40] Yeah.
[1:56:45] Brother Ben, God done anything for
[1:56:46] anybody?
[1:56:48] Yeah.
[1:56:51] Brother Matt gets up here. Ain't God
[1:56:52] good?
[1:56:54] [Applause]
[1:56:58] Come on. Y'all pray for me. I'll hold
[1:57:00] out.
[1:57:04] Now, come on, folks. I'm not talking
[1:57:06] about a message. I'm talking about a
[1:57:08] token message. And you can't be lazy
[1:57:11] with this token. There's never one time
[1:57:13] you got a reason not to give God praise.
[1:57:16] I don't care how bad things are. I don't
[1:57:18] care what devils you face. I don't care
[1:57:20] what spirits have come against you. If
[1:57:22] you got a breath in your body and you
[1:57:25] got a soul with a seed on the inside of
[1:57:27] it, I don't care how dark the midnight
[1:57:29] may be. I want to prophesy the word of
[1:57:32] the Lord. It may be dark and crying may
[1:57:35] be enduring for the night, but joy is
[1:57:38] going to come in the morning.
[1:57:41] I say it's time to kick out that lazy
[1:57:43] spirit. It's time to kick it out of our
[1:57:45] natural lives.
[1:57:48] Come on. We got boys running around
[1:57:49] wanting to get married, don't even have
[1:57:51] jobs. It's time to kick it out. Amen.
[1:57:53] Amen. I want to be this and I want to be
[1:57:55] successful and don't want to spend any
[1:57:57] time in the things of God. It's time to
[1:57:59] kick out them lazy devils. It's time to
[1:58:02] kick them out naturally.
[1:58:05] And it's time to kick them out
[1:58:06] spiritually. And it's time to lose the
[1:58:08] spirit of rebellion when somebody has
[1:58:11] grace to tell you where you're wrong.
[1:58:17] You may want me to leave for another two
[1:58:18] weeks.
[1:58:23] Now, I'm going to close on this.
[1:58:29] Say, "Glory to God."
[1:58:35] You say, "You're just trying to be
[1:58:37] mean." No, I'm trying to be helpful.
[1:58:41] Time to get some spiritual ambition. Not
[1:58:44] just natural, but some spiritual. If you
[1:58:46] get it in the natural, you're going to
[1:58:48] get in the spiritual.
[1:58:52] Now, there was a father in Israel,
[1:58:58] and there was a firstborn son in Israel.
[1:59:03] And there was a prophet, Moses in
[1:59:05] Israel, who said,
[1:59:08] "The death angel's coming."
[1:59:11] Now you say, "Brother Andrew, our young
[1:59:13] people don't need this kind of
[1:59:14] preaching." Well, I beg to differ with
[1:59:16] you.
[1:59:18] Cuz our young boys are going to grow up
[1:59:20] and be the leaders of the churches.
[1:59:23] We got young girls sitting right here
[1:59:25] that no doubt will be preachers wives or
[1:59:26] will be Sunday school teachers. Come on.
[1:59:29] I don't believe you're the church of
[1:59:30] tomorrow. I believe you're the church of
[1:59:33] today. That's why I believe in investing
[1:59:35] the word into this generation.
[1:59:39] So, here's the father. Here's the
[1:59:41] firstborn son.
[1:59:43] And here's and I got it right here. I'm
[1:59:45] not going to read it to you. I'm going
[1:59:46] to preach it to you. And here's the
[1:59:47] death angel. And he's going to come
[1:59:50] through the land. But they heard a
[1:59:53] prophet Moses's message.
[1:59:56] And Moses said these words. He said,
[1:59:59] "When the death angel comes, you take
[2:00:01] that blood, Brother Harvey, from that
[2:00:04] lamb and you put it above the door and
[2:00:06] you put it on the sides of the door. And
[2:00:09] when that death angel comes through your
[2:00:11] neighborhood,
[2:00:13] Brother Dave Paul, it's a powerful
[2:00:15] thing. When that death angel comes
[2:00:17] through your neighborhood, when the
[2:00:18] death angel sees that you put forth some
[2:00:21] effort,
[2:00:26] when that death angel sees that you
[2:00:29] didn't just have the blood, but you
[2:00:31] applied the blood, when that death angel
[2:00:35] sees the blood, he's going to pass over
[2:00:38] your house because of what you're under.
[2:00:42] Brother said like this. He said, "Only
[2:00:45] thing they had was the promise of the
[2:00:48] prophet Moses's words." Now, now I just
[2:00:50] got to illustrate it to you the way
[2:00:51] Brother Bram does it. He says it like
[2:00:53] this, Brother Brian. He says, "The mamas
[2:00:55] are out in the road and they're
[2:00:56] screaming because their babies are
[2:00:58] dead." He said, "There's there's death
[2:01:01] all over the land. It's laying in the
[2:01:03] streets. It's laying in the houses and
[2:01:06] there's a little boy in there and the
[2:01:08] whole house can hear the screams of the
[2:01:12] death angel. Yeah, I I'll pick this up
[2:01:15] next time. They can hear the screams of
[2:01:17] the deaf angel. But listen what the
[2:01:19] prophet says. He says, "And the little
[2:01:21] boy runs over to his daddy
[2:01:25] and his daddy is sitting there reading
[2:01:27] the scriptures."
[2:01:31] Now, he wasn't scrolling or he'd have
[2:01:34] been lazy.
[2:01:37] Oh, God. He was reading the scriptures.
[2:01:41] And when that little boy said, "Daddy,
[2:01:43] my best friend just died." Daddy, little
[2:01:47] Johnny down the road just died. Daddy,
[2:01:50] do you see all the death in the land and
[2:01:52] you're just sitting there reading the
[2:01:53] scripture? He said, "Yes, because I
[2:01:56] believed what the prophet Moses told
[2:01:58] us." He told us if we would take the
[2:02:01] blood and put it over that door. He
[2:02:03] said, "Daddy, can you go check again?"
[2:02:05] He said, "Son, I don't need to go check
[2:02:08] again because I know the blood is over
[2:02:11] the door." He said, "Daddy, what if it
[2:02:13] rains?" He said, "The rain won't affect
[2:02:15] this blood." He said, "Daddy, what if a
[2:02:18] storm comes through and the wind blows?"
[2:02:20] He said, "The wind won't affect this
[2:02:22] blood."
[2:02:25] Hallelujah. He said, "Daddy, are you
[2:02:27] sure?" He said, "Son, I'm sure." He
[2:02:29] said, "Did you get somebody else to put
[2:02:31] it there? Did you get the pastor to do
[2:02:33] all the studying? Did you get the pastor
[2:02:35] to do all the reading? Did you get the
[2:02:37] pastor to do all the praying? Did you
[2:02:39] get the song leader to do all the
[2:02:41] worshiping? No, son. I did it myself.
[2:02:46] I did it myself. I've put the blood
[2:02:48] above the door myself. And I know
[2:02:53] I know when the death angel comes, it's
[2:02:56] going to pass over us.
[2:03:01] Let me say this to you. It's one thing
[2:03:04] to have the blood.
[2:03:06] It's another thing to apply it. Can I
[2:03:09] just get it out there and say it? It's
[2:03:11] one thing to have the message.
[2:03:14] It's another thing to apply it.
[2:03:20] Brother Ram said there was a man
[2:03:21] standing down there kind of kicked back.
[2:03:24] I believe Moses. I believe Jehovah.
[2:03:27] I believe the message.
[2:03:31] I believe that message. Bless God. But I
[2:03:33] can tell you when it happened and where
[2:03:34] I was when it
[2:03:37] said problem was the blood wasn't on his
[2:03:39] door. Come on. He said the true evidence
[2:03:42] you believe the message is when you put
[2:03:45] forth the effort.
[2:03:49] Y'all know obedience takes effort,
[2:03:50] right?
[2:03:53] When you put forth the effort and apply
[2:03:56] the blood. Listen, I want to say this
[2:03:58] very plainly this morning. You after
[2:04:01] somebody. I'm after nobody but the
[2:04:03] devil.
[2:04:05] But I think it's time to kick out the
[2:04:08] lazy spirit with the message of the
[2:04:10] hour. I think it's past time. Well,
[2:04:14] brother Andrew, I come out of this
[2:04:15] church and I come out of this situation.
[2:04:17] They taught things this way and it was
[2:04:18] this way and everything was it's time to
[2:04:20] come out of the lazy excuses.
[2:04:26] Now, brother Re said that had a lot of
[2:04:28] messages, but this was the message of
[2:04:33] the hour.
[2:04:35] Apply the blood. Amen. Now, I'll say
[2:04:40] this to you.
[2:04:42] In this hour we're living, it's going to
[2:04:44] take more than just a couple services a
[2:04:47] week. Yes, sir.
[2:04:49] It's going to take more than just a good
[2:04:52] shouting time at youth camp.
[2:04:54] It's going to take more than just a good
[2:04:55] convention every now and again. It's
[2:04:58] going to take the token.
[2:05:01] And it's going to take somebody coming
[2:05:03] under the influence.
[2:05:06] You say, "Brother Andrew, I don't I
[2:05:07] don't know how in the world I can change
[2:05:09] these situations. I don't know how in
[2:05:10] the world I can fix all these problems."
[2:05:13] And maybe you're sitting here and the
[2:05:14] words got near your near something this
[2:05:16] morning and you're sitting there and
[2:05:17] you're saying, "Brother Andrew, I I
[2:05:19] don't know. I can't fix it. I'm I'm this
[2:05:21] is the way it's been and my daddy
[2:05:24] battled this and my mama battled this
[2:05:26] and I'm I'm slowing down here on purpose
[2:05:29] because because we're living in an age
[2:05:31] where everybody has an excuse.
[2:05:34] It's an age where everybody that don't
[2:05:36] want to do something just don't do it,
[2:05:39] Sister Cindy. And then they want to
[2:05:40] change you for believing the way you
[2:05:43] believe. And because it's an age of
[2:05:45] excuses.
[2:05:47] It's an age of laziness. It's an age
[2:05:50] where it's easier just to give in and
[2:05:51] get everybody to feel sorry for you than
[2:05:54] to stand up and fight back against the
[2:05:57] demons that's trying to destroy you.
[2:06:03] Can I say this to you? Brother said like
[2:06:05] this. He said this. He said, "I was over
[2:06:06] in Germany." He said, "I was over there
[2:06:08] preaching." He said, "I was in a war
[2:06:11] torn country." He said, "They were
[2:06:13] shooting at each other. They were
[2:06:15] fighting. I don't have time. You can
[2:06:17] listen to it in the tape, the
[2:06:18] supernatural." But he said, "I'm there
[2:06:20] and I'm preaching." And he said, "It's
[2:06:21] real cold and it's real indifferent."
[2:06:24] And he said, "The atmosphere is real
[2:06:25] hard." He said, "It's really" He said,
[2:06:27] "It's a real it's a real uh uh starchy,
[2:06:30] stiff, not really believing in the
[2:06:32] supernatural, the movement of God and
[2:06:33] things." He said, "I'm in this
[2:06:34] atmosphere." And he said, "Nothing's
[2:06:36] breaking in the meetings." He said, "But
[2:06:39] the supernatural came in the building."
[2:06:43] Oh, God. Brother Brian. He said, "The
[2:06:46] supernatural came in the building." And
[2:06:48] he said there was a little girl there
[2:06:50] and he said the spirit of God moved over
[2:06:53] her heart and she was instantly healed.
[2:06:56] He said when she was healed, he said the
[2:06:59] power of God dropped into the building.
[2:07:02] I want you to catch this. He said,
[2:07:03] "Here's a nation under political
[2:07:06] influence." He said, "It's hard. It's
[2:07:09] cold, Brother Wesley. They're shooting
[2:07:11] at each other. They're fighting each
[2:07:13] other." He said, "Under that political
[2:07:15] influence." He said, "They're enemies."
[2:07:18] He said, "But when the power of God come
[2:07:21] across the platform and healed that
[2:07:23] little girl," he said there was a
[2:07:25] heavenly influence.
[2:07:28] He said that filled the entire building.
[2:07:31] He said, "When that heavenly influence
[2:07:33] filled the building," he said, "All of a
[2:07:35] sudden, the presence of God," Brother
[2:07:36] Harvey, it paralyzed every devil, it
[2:07:40] paralyzed every demon. And he said, "I
[2:07:43] turned and looked and he said, under
[2:07:45] that influence of the heavenly
[2:07:47] atmosphere," he said, "people that just
[2:07:49] a few minutes ago would have been
[2:07:51] shooting at each other from a political
[2:07:53] influence from the underworld," he said,
[2:07:55] now had their arms around each other and
[2:07:58] they were praising God. You say,
[2:08:00] "Preacher, what are you getting at?" I'm
[2:08:02] saying this. It's time to get under the
[2:08:04] influence of the token message and let
[2:08:07] it paralyze every excuse. Let it
[2:08:09] paralyze every voice of the enemy and
[2:08:11] give you a liberty to believe God is
[2:08:14] greater.
[2:08:15] Won't you stand to your feet this
[2:08:17] morning?
[2:08:21] You said, "Brother Andrew,
[2:08:24] surely surely this can't be. Surely,
[2:08:30] surely, surely we can't get lazy with
[2:08:33] the message. Surely, surely, Brother
[2:08:37] Andrew, as much as as much as we know
[2:08:40] and as much as we've got and as much
[2:08:42] revelation has been revealed, surely we
[2:08:45] can't get lazy with it. Where much is
[2:08:48] getting,
[2:08:52] much is required. Listen,
[2:08:57] I'll sit from the depths of my heart
[2:09:00] with love in my soul and confidence
[2:09:02] behind what I'm saying.
[2:09:05] We start making excuses. Well, it's okay
[2:09:07] to do this and it's okay to do that and
[2:09:09] it's okay to cut this corner and this is
[2:09:11] okay because, you know, so and so was
[2:09:13] unbalanced on that and this is okay
[2:09:15] because so and so is I just just be
[2:09:17] honest with you. We're getting lazy.
[2:09:19] Amen. We're getting lazy with the
[2:09:21] message. Amen. when things start coming
[2:09:24] back in that you can read hundreds of
[2:09:26] quotes a prophet of God taught against
[2:09:28] or get lazy with the message but I don't
[2:09:32] want to be lazy
[2:09:34] I want to be relaxed
[2:09:37] I want to be relaxed
[2:09:40] you love him this morning
[2:09:42] how many can say Lord I want to be
[2:09:44] relaxed
[2:09:45] I don't want to be lazy
[2:09:48] I want to pursue the things of God
[2:09:51] I want to be an eagle
[2:09:53] You know what the prophet of God said? I
[2:09:54] I've got a quote on it. I didn't read it
[2:09:55] to you, but he said he said this age, he
[2:09:58] said the hawks, he said they gotten soft
[2:10:01] and they got lazy. He said they quit
[2:10:04] hunting for that for that meat. They
[2:10:06] quit hunting for that fresh kill. They
[2:10:08] quit hunting in the message and they
[2:10:10] just got a little lazy, you know. But I
[2:10:13] don't want to be lazy. I want to be
[2:10:15] relaxed.
[2:10:18] Lord, I want that rest of the Holy
[2:10:20] Spirit in my soul.
[2:10:23] Now listen,
[2:10:25] I'll say this.
[2:10:27] I believe we got the cream of crop when
[2:10:28] it comes to young people.
[2:10:32] Anybody agree with me?
[2:10:35] I tell you one thing. Some of these
[2:10:36] young people have been through things
[2:10:37] that elders have not even faced.
[2:10:43] Can I just say it? Seen things around
[2:10:45] the message people should never see.
[2:10:49] heard and fought and battled things that
[2:10:50] people should never have to face,
[2:10:53] but they're in the house of God
[2:10:56] and they're praising God. And because
[2:10:59] somewhere there's a little flaw or a
[2:11:01] little error or a little area that there
[2:11:03] can be some room on, how about we
[2:11:05] invest,
[2:11:08] folks? It's getting quiet here. I don't
[2:11:10] know why.
[2:11:11] How about we invest in those areas?
[2:11:15] Somebody say, "Well, I seen so and so
[2:11:16] doing this, and I seen so and so doing
[2:11:18] that, and I seen so and so looking like
[2:11:21] this, and let's just throw them away."
[2:11:24] No. Why don't we go pick them up and
[2:11:26] invest in them?
[2:11:29] Why don't we take some time and say,
[2:11:31] "Here, here's what a prophet said. And
[2:11:34] the potentials is in you to manifest
[2:11:36] this."
[2:11:39] Listen, I don't believe I don't believe
[2:11:42] this message come to make us lazy. I
[2:11:44] believe it come to make us relaxed.
[2:11:47] Maybe maybe Wednesday I'll get on Rahab
[2:11:49] the influencer.
[2:11:51] But I believe it's time to apply the
[2:11:53] token. Can I tell you what a prophet
[2:11:55] said? He said, "You asked me, brother
[2:11:58] Brandham, how do you apply the token?"
[2:12:00] He said, "I'm going to tell you." Are
[2:12:02] you ready for it? He said, "Clean out
[2:12:04] the houses." Yes, sir. Clean out the
[2:12:07] closets.
[2:12:09] Clean off the tables. Kick out things
[2:12:11] that's ungodly. And he said, "Apply the
[2:12:14] token over that home."
[2:12:18] Listen, the death angels in the land.
[2:12:21] Spiritual death is striking.
[2:12:23] But there's a message and it's a message
[2:12:26] of power. It's a message of authority.
[2:12:29] Friends, I don't know about you this
[2:12:31] morning. I want to run to the token
[2:12:32] message. I wonder this morning, ever
[2:12:34] head bowed, ever eye closed. No one
[2:12:37] looking around.
[2:12:39] I wonder if there'll be one here this
[2:12:40] morning can say, "Lord, I hear your word
[2:12:43] speaking to me.
[2:12:45] There's areas I've gotten
[2:12:48] I've gotten lazy in.
[2:12:51] There's areas I've I thought I was
[2:12:54] relaxed,
[2:12:55] but I really wasn't relaxed. I was lazy.
[2:12:59] I let hurts and I let I let failures and
[2:13:02] I let disappointments take the very
[2:13:05] courage of God out of my soul and out of
[2:13:07] my spirit.
[2:13:08] But this morning, Lord, this morning, I
[2:13:11] want that blood to be applied to my
[2:13:13] life.
[2:13:15] I don't want to live under the influence
[2:13:17] of the underworld any longer. I don't
[2:13:20] want to live under the influence
[2:13:22] of Leodysia any longer
[2:13:25] this morning. Lord, I want to come
[2:13:28] underneath the influence of this token
[2:13:29] message. Change me, oh God.
[2:13:33] Listen, I know this morning, I know
[2:13:36] there's been hurts and there's been letd
[2:13:38] downs and there's been all kinds of
[2:13:40] things, but friends, I wish I had the
[2:13:42] ability this morning, as the prophet
[2:13:44] said, he said, "I wish I had the ability
[2:13:47] to place into you the guarantee of this
[2:13:50] token,
[2:13:51] not just in your ears this morning." And
[2:13:54] as a as a minister, as a man of God
[2:13:56] standing here this morning, I wish I had
[2:13:58] the ability, but I rely upon the spirit
[2:14:01] this morning. I wish I had the ability
[2:14:04] to know these things were being placed
[2:14:06] beyond just your ears, but they were
[2:14:08] being placed into your soul
[2:14:11] this morning, friends. The Holy Spirit
[2:14:14] is in this building.
[2:14:16] If you strayed, if you've gotten lazy
[2:14:19] with your walk with God, if you've made
[2:14:21] a mistake and you've made a failure and
[2:14:23] you've made a shortcoming,
[2:14:26] do not lay down in the laziness of that
[2:14:29] and give into that empathy and give into
[2:14:31] that excuse.
[2:14:33] There's a blood here this morning and
[2:14:36] there's power in that blood. There's
[2:14:39] strength in that blood this morning.
[2:14:41] Almighty God, all across this building
[2:14:44] this morning,
[2:14:46] honest hearts and sincere hearts are
[2:14:48] being opened before you this morning.
[2:14:51] And Father, I know in a service like
[2:14:53] this this morning that the enemy would
[2:14:55] love to come in and manipulate the way
[2:14:58] the believers would hear things said or
[2:15:00] twist things this morning. But Father,
[2:15:03] you know from my heart that I've said
[2:15:04] these things not out of prejudice, but
[2:15:08] as your prophet said, I've said it for
[2:15:09] the cause of truth. Now, Lord, this
[2:15:12] morning, I know we're living in an age
[2:15:13] where the prophet of God said identities
[2:15:16] are being changed. He said the the
[2:15:19] eagles are being tried to reduce down to
[2:15:22] just hawks and soft and lazy
[2:15:24] compromising.
[2:15:26] But this morning, Lord, I believe the
[2:15:27] token message is calling a challenge to
[2:15:29] the church this morning.
[2:15:32] Father, we don't just want to be
[2:15:33] challenged in our doctrine. And Lord, we
[2:15:35] don't just want to be strong in our
[2:15:37] ability to shout or dance or rejoice.
[2:15:40] But Father, the character of the church,
[2:15:43] the beauty of the church is the
[2:15:45] character of the people that make it up.
[2:15:47] Now this morning, Lord, we're not
[2:15:49] standing here with just fly by night,
[2:15:52] haphazard people. Lord, I'm standing in
[2:15:54] front of warriors this morning. I'm
[2:15:57] standing before sons and daughters of
[2:15:58] yours that have been purchased by your
[2:16:00] blood. But Lord, we're ever one from the
[2:16:03] pulpit to the back door, from the eldest
[2:16:06] to the youngest. Lord, this morning,
[2:16:08] we're ever won in a battle, Lord. It's a
[2:16:11] battle to stay on fire. It's a It's a
[2:16:13] battle to press against the enemy. It's
[2:16:15] a battle to fight against the mind
[2:16:17] battles, Lord. It's a it's an age, Lord,
[2:16:20] where mamas and daddies are are waring
[2:16:22] like never before against the influences
[2:16:24] of the underworld that are trying to
[2:16:26] captivate the lives of their children,
[2:16:28] Lord. Oh God, it's an age where
[2:16:30] marriages are fighting to save life,
[2:16:33] Lord. It's an age where where churches
[2:16:35] are fighting, Lord, and they're
[2:16:37] fighting, Lord, just to stay above the
[2:16:39] pressures.
[2:16:41] But Lord, this morning, I'm so thankful
[2:16:43] to be identified with a group of
[2:16:44] believers like right here at Grace
[2:16:46] Tabernacle. Lord, we're fighting, but
[2:16:49] we're not giving in. Lord, Lord, the
[2:16:51] influences of hell are streaming through
[2:16:54] this land and they're taking over. But
[2:16:56] Lord, I'm so thankful there's some mamas
[2:16:58] and daddies here this morning. Lord, on
[2:17:01] this Father's Day, I'm so thankful
[2:17:03] there's some Holy Ghost fililled fathers
[2:17:04] in this building, Lord, that are not
[2:17:06] laying down to the pressures of the age
[2:17:08] and laying down to the voices of of of
[2:17:11] manipulation and the voices of criticism
[2:17:13] from the underworld, but Lord, they're
[2:17:16] taking their stand as the as the head of
[2:17:18] the home, as the protector, as the
[2:17:20] provider, as the as the spiritual leader
[2:17:22] of that home, and they're standing there
[2:17:24] between that family and the outside
[2:17:26] world and those influences, and they're
[2:17:28] saying the world will have no influence
[2:17:30] in my home. Oh God, I pray this morning
[2:17:34] you would restore the strength of every
[2:17:35] father here today, Lord. Father, I pray
[2:17:38] for every mother, Lord, as as that fifth
[2:17:41] gospel, Lord. fathers are standing
[2:17:43] between their their their kids and that
[2:17:45] and that influences oh God Lord when the
[2:17:49] influencers have come into families into
[2:17:51] homes and Lord that that don't even know
[2:17:53] they're there until they start showing
[2:17:55] up in in character and in in in language
[2:17:58] and the way that things are being said
[2:17:59] and done. Oh God, this morning,
[2:18:03] may this be the day, Father.
[2:18:06] May this be the day that the token
[2:18:09] message
[2:18:10] be applied to every home,
[2:18:13] be put over every family
[2:18:16] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:18:19] In the name of Jesus Christ, I wonder
[2:18:22] this morning with every head bowed,
[2:18:23] every eye closed, no one looking around,
[2:18:27] just you and the Lord right now, I
[2:18:30] wonder if you could just zip your hands
[2:18:31] up and say, "Lord,
[2:18:33] remember me. I hear your word speaking
[2:18:36] to me this morning.
[2:18:39] I hear your word challenging me this
[2:18:41] morning."
[2:18:43] Now I I can stand here today and from my
[2:18:45] heart I can say the Lord is gracious.
[2:18:49] The Lord is merciful.
[2:18:52] He loves us enough this morning to come
[2:18:53] by our way and speak these things to our
[2:18:56] hearts. Now the prophet of God said it
[2:18:59] this way. He said, "I have delivered it
[2:19:01] unto you. Now what will you do with it?"
[2:19:05] My brother, my sister, this morning as
[2:19:07] the Holy Spirit is settled over this
[2:19:08] building. I've delivered the things that
[2:19:11] God laid upon my heart. Now, what will
[2:19:14] you do with it?
[2:19:16] Will it be another service? Will it be
[2:19:19] another sermon for brother Andrew?
[2:19:22] Or will it be a challenge?
[2:19:25] Will it be a will it be a will it be a a
[2:19:27] shaking to say, "Lord, I thank you for
[2:19:30] loving me enough to shake this old leoty
[2:19:33] and laziness off. I don't want to get
[2:19:36] lazy with this word,
[2:19:39] Lord. Lord, I don't want to get lazy
[2:19:40] with my prayer life. Lord, I don't want
[2:19:42] to get lazy with my study. Lord, I say
[2:19:45] to you parents here this morning, God
[2:19:47] bless you. You fight through hell to
[2:19:50] bring them babies to church and you you
[2:19:52] fight through all kinds of pressures. I
[2:19:54] see him here on Wednesdays fighting the
[2:19:56] devil to get here. But I say, God bless
[2:19:58] you. I say, God bless you. though it
[2:20:00] takes a long time to get ready and all
[2:20:02] kinds of things going wrong and all
[2:20:04] kinds of problems, but you fight through
[2:20:06] it and find yourself in the house of
[2:20:07] God, you're influencing church
[2:20:09] attendance and those babies. And I say,
[2:20:12] God bless you this morning.
[2:20:14] I say, God bless you fathers here today
[2:20:17] that when something goes wrong, you
[2:20:18] don't just lay down and say, "We ain't
[2:20:20] going to church." But you influence your
[2:20:23] kids to know that no matter how bad
[2:20:25] things are, if we can just get in the
[2:20:27] house of God and get in his presence,
[2:20:29] things will change. I say, God bless
[2:20:32] you, young people. All hell against you,
[2:20:35] the lid of hell come off and demon power
[2:20:38] streaming up on you, but yet you still
[2:20:41] rise up and find yourself in the house
[2:20:44] of God. No doubt, stand up here and and
[2:20:47] sing and the devil battling your mind. I
[2:20:50] say God bless you. I say God bless you
[2:20:52] this morning.
[2:20:55] I give myself away.
[2:21:00] [Music]
[2:21:03] I give myself away.
[2:21:07] You can use me.
[2:21:14] How many this morning say, "Lord, I give
[2:21:15] myself away to you.
[2:21:18] [Music]
[2:21:19] Give myself
[2:21:22] so you
[2:21:24] can use me. Here I am. Here I am. Here I
[2:21:32] standord
[2:21:35] my life
[2:21:38] is in your hands.
[2:21:42] Lord.
[2:21:46] How many is wrong in this morning?
[2:21:48] to see the desires of God
[2:21:52] revealed.
[2:21:57] [Music]
[2:21:59] Oh yes.
[2:22:02] I mean this morning I say, "Lord, I'm
[2:22:03] sorry.
[2:22:05] Forgive me this morning, Lord.
[2:22:09] I can raise my hands.
[2:22:11] I can say, "Lord, forgive me for areas
[2:22:13] that I've gotten lazy." And Lord,
[2:22:17] I don't want to be a lazy Christian.
[2:22:21] I want to be a relaxed Christian.
[2:22:24] Hallelujah.
[2:22:26] Oh, yes.
[2:22:29] Oh, take my heart. How many gifts it to
[2:22:32] him this morning?
[2:22:37] The living
[2:22:43] Oh my dreams.
[2:22:46] What about it this morning? All my
[2:22:49] plans,
[2:22:51] Lord, I place them.
[2:22:54] I place them in your hands.
[2:22:56] [Music]
[2:22:58] I
[2:23:02] give myself away.
[2:23:05] I give myself away. Oh yes.
[2:23:13] I give myself away. Give myself away.
[2:23:18] Oh yes.
[2:23:22] [Music]
[2:23:29] How many can from the depths of your
[2:23:31] soul this morning say, "I want to be the
[2:23:32] best.
[2:23:36] I want to be the best.
[2:23:39] I give myself to you.
[2:23:42] [Music]
[2:23:46] All this
[2:23:49] I belong.
[2:23:51] I give myself
[2:23:55] to you."
[2:23:57] You know this morning, you know, Brother
[2:23:59] Bram actually tells us something. He
[2:24:01] says,
[2:24:03] he says he went in there one day and I
[2:24:04] think it's Billy Paul actually gives a
[2:24:06] testimony.
[2:24:07] Speaking this morning on the best sign
[2:24:09] of the church. He said, I walked in
[2:24:11] there one morning. He said,
[2:24:13] Billy Paul tells the testimony. He said,
[2:24:15] "Daddy looked at me. He said, now
[2:24:16] Billy," he said, "Whatever you going to
[2:24:19] be in life, be the best at it." He said,
[2:24:23] "Whatever you're going to be, be the
[2:24:24] best at it." Now, kind of comical, but
[2:24:27] he said this, Brother Joe. He said,
[2:24:28] "Daddy," looked at me and he said,
[2:24:30] "Billy, if you're going to be a bum," he
[2:24:32] said, "Be the best one there ever was."
[2:24:35] He said, "Daddy, how in the world am I
[2:24:36] going to do that?" He said, "Billy,
[2:24:38] don't strike a lick at nothing." Said,
[2:24:40] "Be the best bum there ever was." He
[2:24:43] said, "But if you're going to be a
[2:24:44] Christian," he said, "Be the best
[2:24:46] Christian there ever was." In other
[2:24:49] words, whatever you do, put all your
[2:24:52] heart into it. Make it the best.
[2:24:56] That bartender down there is going to
[2:24:57] have a sign. Forget that neon sign. Let
[2:25:00] that man that got under the influence of
[2:25:02] what he was selling be the best sign.
[2:25:04] How many this morning can say, Lord, I
[2:25:06] want to be the best sign of this church.
[2:25:09] I claim it this morning for my life. I
[2:25:11] want to be the best sign of this church.
[2:25:14] I want people to see me spiritually
[2:25:17] drunk influenced and intoxicated. When I
[2:25:21] say something about this assembly, I
[2:25:23] want to talk about the powerful things
[2:25:25] that God has done and the miraculous
[2:25:27] things. Listen, it's time to apply the
[2:25:30] token. It's time to apply the token this
[2:25:33] morning. God bless you today. I pray
[2:25:36] something's been said to help you, to
[2:25:38] bless you. Amen. Amen. I
[2:25:42] Lord willing, we'll pick it up
[2:25:43] Wednesday. You love him this morning.
[2:25:46] Amen. Let's sing it as our pastor comes.
[2:25:53] Just place your life in his hands today.
[2:25:55] Friends,
[2:25:58] I challenge you. Go home and
[2:26:01] break open your Bible.

[2:26:11] in Jesus name.

[2:31:31] [Music]
[2:31:34] Lord.
[2:31:37] I believe
[2:31:46] he's in the house.
[2:31:49] Death has to flee.
[2:31:52] And now there is a life
[2:31:56] where darkness used to be.
[2:32:00] Now there is hope.
[2:32:03] There's no more doubt.
[2:32:06] So I'll praise his name.
[2:32:10] Praise his name.
[2:32:13] He's in the house.
[2:32:17] house.
[2:32:19] Little girl was lying there. People all
[2:32:23] were weeping.
[2:32:25] They just laughed at Jesus when he said
[2:32:29] she's only sleeping.
[2:32:32] Then he took her by the hand. She began
[2:32:36] to live again.
[2:32:39] Some began to praise the Lord. Others
[2:32:43] begin to say,
[2:32:45] "He's in the house.
[2:32:49] Death has to flee.
[2:32:52] Now there is light
[2:32:55] where darkness used to be.
[2:32:59] Now there is hope
[2:33:02] and there's no more doubt.
[2:33:05] So I'll praise his name.
[2:33:09] Praise his name.
[2:33:12] He's in the house
[2:33:16] and death has to flee.
[2:33:19] Now there is life
[2:33:22] where darkness used to be.
[2:33:26] Now there is hope
[2:33:29] and there's no more doubt.
[2:33:33] Praise his name.
[2:33:36] I'll praise his name.
[2:33:39] He's in the house.
[2:33:45] You're like that little girl who didn't
[2:33:48] know our sins.
[2:33:52] Jesus touched this heart of mine and
[2:33:55] gave me life again.
[2:33:59] I am just a house of clay. Amen. Ever
[2:34:03] since that blessed day,
[2:34:06] there's a light that shines on me.
[2:34:09] All the world to see.
[2:34:13] He's in the house.
[2:34:16] Death has to flee.
[2:34:19] Now there is light
[2:34:22] where darkness used to be.
[2:34:26] Now there is hope.
[2:34:30] There's no doubt.
[2:34:33] Praise his name.
[2:34:36] Praise his name.
[2:34:40] He's in the house.
[2:34:44] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[2:34:45] clap of praise this morning?
[2:34:49] How many say he's worthy to be praised?
[2:34:52] Amen. How many enjoyed that message this
[2:34:54] morning? What a great Father's Day
[2:34:57] message. So, how many enjoyed that? Was
[2:34:59] it a blessing to you this morning
[2:35:05] for the Lord to come by and speak to our
[2:35:07] hearts? And I know it's was drawn late
[2:35:10] this morning and just want to allow
[2:35:12] everybody to be able to go and have
[2:35:15] fellowship and I know maybe have some
[2:35:17] things planned today and also want to
[2:35:22] remember our youth as we're going on our
[2:35:25] trip uh in the morning. Be back on
[2:35:27] Wednesday. So you'll keep all of those
[2:35:30] that's traveling your prayer. I think we
[2:35:32] have six a little over 60 people that
[2:35:34] are going on the youth trip. So we're
[2:35:37] going to have a wonderful time and
[2:35:38] looking forward to fellowshipping and
[2:35:41] all that with the with the young kids.
[2:35:43] So um I just just want to say this
[2:35:45] tonight and or or the this this
[2:35:48] afternoon and and really appreciate what
[2:35:52] brother Andrew had to say. I appreciate
[2:35:54] his stand on the message and and you
[2:35:57] know I want to maybe kind of leave you
[2:36:00] this as a parting thought and I know
[2:36:02] there may be some that you know invited
[2:36:05] different family members and things that
[2:36:07] are come but this this uh message of
[2:36:10] brother Andrew is preaching this morning
[2:36:12] has changed my life. It's changed my uh
[2:36:14] my family. It took us uh from being lost
[2:36:18] and serving the world and had no
[2:36:21] direction to serve God. and it turned my
[2:36:23] life around and brought me back to the
[2:36:25] Bible and I believe that's what its
[2:36:27] intention was. Even even the prophet
[2:36:29] would say himself, he said the purpose
[2:36:31] of this message is one thing. It's
[2:36:33] redemption and I believe it it's
[2:36:35] fulfilled its purpose. I wonder how many
[2:36:36] is a testimony of that today. It's the
[2:36:39] the purchased blood of Jesus Christ. I
[2:36:42] can give you a real short version to
[2:36:43] take with you in parting words is is
[2:36:46] that the very the very thing that it
[2:36:50] does is what it's always done since the
[2:36:52] time that Jesus first spoke these words
[2:36:54] out of his mouth that every disciple
[2:36:56] that picked up that message that Jesus
[2:36:58] spoke and they carried it on from age to
[2:37:00] age. It's always had the same power. Uh
[2:37:03] sometimes that men have taken it
[2:37:05] different directions and uh and not uh
[2:37:07] not applied today. But uh what we have
[2:37:10] today is a resurrection of Hebrews in
[2:37:12] 13:8, a vindication of this Bible. We
[2:37:15] still we still stand on it and uh we
[2:37:18] that's that's what we follow. That's
[2:37:20] what we live for. And we've seen the
[2:37:22] Bible resurrected in this day. And we
[2:37:24] certainly appreciate that. And and
[2:37:27] appreciate that God would send a prophet
[2:37:28] this age to be able to stand in front of
[2:37:31] men and hold a Bible up and say, "This
[2:37:33] is what we believe." And you guys can go
[2:37:35] do whatever y'all want. You can build
[2:37:37] every church and the following of every
[2:37:39] man that they have built today. Make
[2:37:41] great followings of men by the millions.
[2:37:44] Uh they've made great followings. But
[2:37:45] there was one man that would stand and
[2:37:47] say, "But we're not going to follow
[2:37:48] after a man. We're going to follow after
[2:37:49] the word of God." And only a God, a God-
[2:37:52] called prophet can take a point to Jesus
[2:37:55] Christ and not to a church or to
[2:37:57] something that was established by men.
[2:37:59] And I thank God for God called men. And
[2:38:01] I want you to take this with you today.
[2:38:03] Don't ever let Satan in your mind
[2:38:05] separate men from the word of God that
[2:38:08] that that God has sent. I know how he
[2:38:10] does and and he makes it well well the
[2:38:12] Bible is this or the Bible says that.
[2:38:14] But you realize that that whole Bible
[2:38:16] that we read read was written by men
[2:38:18] that was anointed by the Holy Ghost. And
[2:38:20] you know I I heard a guy quote that to
[2:38:22] me one time. He said, "Well, you know,
[2:38:23] the book of Revelation says that any man
[2:38:25] that would add to or take away his part
[2:38:26] would be taken out of the book of life."
[2:38:28] I said, "That's absolutely true." But do
[2:38:30] you realize the man that wrote that in
[2:38:32] the uh the revelation that John had when
[2:38:34] that was written, it wasn't placed in
[2:38:36] the New Testament until 400 years later.
[2:38:39] So what do you say to them 400 years of
[2:38:41] people that lived and served God and and
[2:38:43] they had the letters from Paul and the
[2:38:45] letters from uh from Luke and the book
[2:38:47] of Acts. It was only 400 years before it
[2:38:50] was ever put in a book form. It was men
[2:38:53] anointed by the Holy Ghost that were
[2:38:54] writing to the church and that were
[2:38:56] leading the church. And God still does
[2:38:58] that today. You say, "Well, Brother
[2:38:59] Matt, how do how do you how do you know
[2:39:01] that it is a man of God?" Well, I'll
[2:39:03] tell you how it is. It'll follow the
[2:39:05] same Holy Ghost that wrote the Bible.
[2:39:07] It'll follow just in line with it
[2:39:09] perfectly. So, that's how you keep the
[2:39:11] difference out of knowing that some man
[2:39:13] would raise up and preach some false
[2:39:15] thing to the church. But any true man of
[2:39:17] God will preach that same Bible. What
[2:39:19] the same Holy Ghost has spoke then,
[2:39:20] he'll still speak it today. But God
[2:39:22] still uses men. And just because you
[2:39:25] didn't see a pillar of fire don't mean
[2:39:26] the pillar of fire wasn't there. Can I
[2:39:29] ask you that? How many was there in 1933
[2:39:31] that witnessed that pillar of fire that
[2:39:32] brother Andrew was talking about this
[2:39:34] morning? Is there any w eyewitnesses
[2:39:36] here this morning? There ain't any
[2:39:38] there. But how many believe it was
[2:39:40] there? I believe that.
[2:39:43] You say, "Well, I I don't know about
[2:39:45] that." Well, let me ask let me challenge
[2:39:47] any Christian this morning. How many was
[2:39:49] there when Apostle Paul went down that
[2:39:51] road and he said, "A pillow of fire
[2:39:52] appeared before me and it blinded my
[2:39:55] eyes?" How many eyewitnesses do we have
[2:39:56] that saw it? But how many believe it was
[2:39:59] there? Amen. I believe that. I believe
[2:40:02] we're real. That's what makes us real
[2:40:04] believers. That's why we we operate by
[2:40:07] faith. I believe that the same God of
[2:40:10] yesterday is the same God today. And
[2:40:12] he's still doing the supernatural.
[2:40:14] That's what we have. We're a bunch of
[2:40:16] message believing Bible believing
[2:40:18] people. The message is the Bible. It is
[2:40:21] the word of God. Amen. You love the
[2:40:23] Lord. Amen. And it's our it's our guide
[2:40:25] today to point us back to the word.
[2:40:28] Amen. You you believe that? Amen. Let's
[2:40:31] just bow our heads together. Gracious
[2:40:32] heavenly father, we thank you, Lord, for
[2:40:34] this time to come together, Lord. And we
[2:40:36] thank you for the word that has been
[2:40:38] sent. Lord, we say amen to the word of
[2:40:41] God. I thank you for our brother just
[2:40:43] pouring his heart out. And Lord, I ask
[2:40:45] you that you would bless him and his
[2:40:47] family, Lord, as we go from this place.
[2:40:49] Give him strength in his body, Lord. I
[2:40:52] pray that you would bless each one
[2:40:53] today, Lord. And we've come to this
[2:40:55] service, Lord. We just have one service
[2:40:57] and we dedicate it so much to you. And
[2:40:59] Lord, I pray you would bless each one,
[2:41:01] God. May something that has been said,
[2:41:03] Lord, be a blessing to them, Lord. That
[2:41:05] they could take it and it would change
[2:41:06] their life today that would cause us to
[2:41:09] look to you, the Lord Jesus Christ, the
[2:41:11] author and the finisher of our faith,
[2:41:13] God. May something had been said that
[2:41:15] would draw us closer to you. May we fall
[2:41:16] in love with you, Lord, greater than we
[2:41:18] ever have. That we could stand and serve
[2:41:20] you as real men and women of the gospel,
[2:41:23] real disciples of Jesus Christ. Lord, we
[2:41:25] ask you as we go from this place, bring
[2:41:27] us back safely now. In the name of Jesus
[2:41:29] Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless
[2:41:33] you as you go. Can you say, "God is
[2:41:36] everything."
[2:41:39] Well, God is my everything.
[2:41:45] God is my everything.
[2:41:49] He's my hope for tomorrow.
[2:41:53] He's my joy
[2:41:56] in sorrow.
[2:41:58] He's my rock
[2:42:00] in a wey land. He's my shelter in a time
[2:42:05] of storm.
[2:42:08] God is
[2:42:10] God is
[2:42:12] my everything.
[2:42:17] Well, God is
[2:42:20] my everything. Well, God is
[2:42:25] my everything. He's my joy.
[2:42:29] [Music]
[2:42:31] Yes, he's my hope.
[2:42:36] He's my rock. He's a rock in a win. He's
[2:42:41] my shelter in a time of storm. I say God
[2:42:46] is God is God is
[2:42:51] my everything.
[2:42:54] I want you to know God is God is my
[2:42:58] everything. I'll say my God is God is
