prayer and he is so good too amen can you sing it with all your heart tonight well God is so good my God is so good amen God bless you tonight we greet you in the name of the Lord while you're standing with us we're going to go to the Book of Matthew chapter 24 Matthew chapter 24 we're going to look at verse verse one tonight what I'd like to do with the help of the Lord is pick up on a subject that we've been speaking on at our assembly for the last I guess the last couple years um we've been speaking on the seventh seal and I've gotten over to uh the middle of this message on the seventh seal and and started into um brother R's thought line on Matthew chapter 24 so we'll just drop into that for a few minutes tonight maybe something just to try to help you Matthew 24: one and Jesus went out of the and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple and Jesus said unto them see you not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon one another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat upon Mount olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us tell us when these things shall be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world again verse three as he sat upon Mount olives so Matthew 24: 1 and 2 actually took place in ad30 on Tuesday morning and then in that afternoon that Tuesday afternoon they go to mount olives and the Bible says as he sat upon the Mount of Olives disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world so's in prison now 1963 just a pick up this subject says there will be a Ministry that'll show great wonders Joel said so as Jesus first preached and was rejected that same ministry will have to repeat again what if that could be the third pull Jesus's Ministry when he was Healing The Sick he was wonderful that young prophet of Galilee why he makes the blind to seea even raised the dead but one day he turned around and he said you generation of vipers you make the outside of the platter clean you appear to be holy but the inside of you the inside of you you're nothing but a bunch of snakes oh when that prophecy went forth condemning that organization didn't it change they turned against him that's right and finally by rejecting him they crucified him I'd like to use that for a subject tonight and speak on the sign of his coming let's just by our hearts heavenly father thank you tonight for the reading of the word I pray Lord that you would just help me now Lord as you Lord shove my Humanity aside and Lord may you just anoint us tonight to be able to look into your word you see every need that is represented in this place tonight and I just pray Lord that you would come and minister to the heart of your people Lord we're living in a day where Revelation is so important and your Prophet tells us we should pray for revelation more than anything else so tonight Lord when we look into these things I pray Lord Make It Real to us may our eyes be illuminated I ask now father use us For Your Glory we'll be so careful to give you the praise in the name of Jesus Christ and everybody said amen God bless you tonight you can be seated we know when it comes to Matthew chapter 24 that Matthew 24 is dealing with the subject of the coming of the Lord and Jesus is telling his disciples as he comes to this place in Matthew 24 as as the prophet picks it up in the six seal on Matthew 24 and we know that all Seven Seals lays in Matthew 24 whenever the prophet preaches the Seven Seals and then he finally gets down to the Sixth Seal which is speaking about the tribulation period he actually takes in that message and goes back to Matthew 24 and he shows how that the seals lays in Matthew 24 but the problem is no other teacher in the world has ever took the Seven Seals from Matthew 24 many of theologians preach the seven seal from Matthew 24 or the coming of the Lord but they don't tie the rest of the seals in there but when it comes to the end time ministry this message come to be able to make the Bible a new book to us to illuminate what already lays within the word so Matthew 24 is going to actually deal with his coming so when Jesus comes to this Temple and he's actually walking through the temple he shows them the buildings that are in this Temple no doubt the temple was beautiful as they come through it now remember this is the first temple that they're looking at no doubt that it's beautiful uh it's an incredible sight to be able to behold people from all over Israel they would come keeping the Feast of the Lord they would come into that Temple to be able to Worship in that Temple they would bring their sacrifices in to be able to worship and the temple was a beautiful attraction as far as looking at it from the outside appearance it was a beautiful place that they had built they've taken so many resources to be able to build this to make it so so big and so beautiful and we know that the temple is the temple being built from the tle Tabernacle in the wilderness to Solomon's Temple now to this Temple it would be built by three courts pattern it would be the outer courts the inner courts and then the holies of holies and you would think where would they get this mentality to be able to build this kind of a temple well if you'll remember back in the book of Exodus that Moses was actually caught up by Vision into the heavens as Paul tells us in the book of Hebrews that he actually saw in heaven exactly what God wanted upon the Earth so Moses saw the pattern of a three-fold Tabernacle in the heavens and that's what God wants upon the Earth and I'll say this not only does God want that in the natural Tabernacle in the wilderness and Solomon's Temple and this Temple but when it come to your temple you would be built up of the same way you'd have an outer Court an inner court and then you would have a soul so when it come to this Temple it was an attraction amongst Jerusalem and the people would have to take and make their Voyage down and their pilgrimage down to where the Tabernacle is and they was using the beauty beuty of this Temple let think about it they was using the beauty of this Temple to be able to validate how great that they was they was using the outside appearance to be able to validate how spiritual they are how much understanding they are and they was using the temple itself as an identity that if we've got this kind of a temple then God must be with us and if you don't believe that God is with us look how big our temples are look how big our churches are look how many programs we got we got all types of schools all kinds of programs we built things anybody follow me tonight look at our Temple and by looking at our temples you can tell that God must be with us or we wouldn't have these kind of temples so they're showing him I'm going to use that tonight to be able to paraphrase back and forth so they're using the temple showing what is taking place spiritually in their lives by looking at what they possess naturally so they're looking at the outside to be able to identify truly God must be among us or we wouldn't have what we have and so when they come to Matthew 24 Jesus comes there and they're looking at the temple and then he comes out in Matthew 241 and he shows them the buildings that are around the temple and Jesus is going to let the disciples know he's telling them do not allow this attraction to be a distraction don't allow the temporary to be able to take your eyes off of what God really wants you to see don't allow the temples and I'll say this today in this age don't allow the structures don't allow the numbers don't allow the members to distract us from really what God is doing in this hour and Jesus is letting them know don't allow it to be this attraction to become a distraction and the temple that you're looking at think about this Temple that you're looking at it's got so much Beauty that's all the way around it but I want to tell you it's only a temporary building the mortar listen the mortar is temporary the blocks are only going to be temporary the building itself won't even last as a matter of fact th coming a day these stones that you're looking at right here and no doubt they was gigantic Stone they won't be one left upon another and the things that are around you are only temporary and he's letting them know don't get your eyes up on that don't allow that to be the attraction to think that that's a measuring stick for spirituality don't allow that to come to your mind to think that if you got this then truly God must be among us get your eyes off of temporary Tabernacles get your eyes off of temporary things get your eyes off of your temporary Temple and your temporary mortar and your temporary don't get your eyes up on that don't get your eyes on your flesh it'll be a distraction from the real attraction that is inside of your soul Hallelujah so get your eyes off of temporary things because I want to announce to you as Jesus would show them the day of the Lord is coming now whenever you see that phrase in the Bible every time you see that phrase it's speaking about the day of judgment or the tribulation period that's going to come upon the Earth so you read it through the Old Testament talks about the day of the Lord Malachi picks it up behold I'll send you Elijah to the prophet for the great and wonderful day of the Lord it's speaking about the time of judgment so Jesus is telling them don't get your eyes on this judgment's coming get your eyes on the word and get your eyes on Truth get your eyes on what God's doing oh my and I want to tell you that same spirit that was upon the people of that day is the same spirit that is right here in Le Osa tonight tonight they've got their eyes upon the wrong thing the Asen the Pharisees the herodians they could not see the word being manifested right in front of them so whenever they did not have the ability to scripturally identify the word coming to fulfillment they simply turned it down and they rejected it and they said he's just another preacher he's another man like John the Baptist he got his head cut off this man will be here for a few days and he's gone but look at our Temple our Temple's going to be here whenever this man is gone just like when John's gone this Temple's going to be staying here and Jesus says don't get your eyes on it boys I'm telling you that's not the attraction that's a distraction from the real Temple can you imagine the temple of God was walking around in shoe leather and they're looking at the wrong Temple they got their eyes on the brick but listen they should have had their eyes upon the real Temple that was standing in front of them and the real Temple that was standing there fulfilling the word they rejected him whenever he came they rejected truth yes now let me say it like this and I'm tying this with our day they knew the law by education they knew it by intellectual conception but they could not see the Fulfillment of it by Revelation so I tell you what's more important education or Revelation what's more important being educated or being real I have nothing against education and I'll just tell you tonight I don't believe brother Ram had anything against education where brother Ram stood against education was is when man tried to use their education to find God that's when the prophet condemed education but as long as we're here we're going to have to go to college and learn things to be able to get by but listen the first time we try to use that education to identify where God is or try to identify how great God is that's when that IDE education becomes a distraction from the attraction lord well that just felt good that just fell right out of Heaven amen don't allow to become a distraction so now watch what's taking place the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and Jesus's time upon the Earth is coming to an end so he's coming as we understand SP spiritually he's coming to the place of the third pool of his ministry which is the time of rejection now remember every Ministry Noah's Ministry Jesus's Ministry this ministry today the revealing of the son of man every Ministry that has a third pull will actually do the same thing there will be a rejection of that Ministry so because of the blindness of these people and it overwhelms me because after all the signs that was done all the Wonders that was performed all the Miracles the supernatural that was done over and over again the things that had been done it was all of that was was not enough to get their attention the blind coming open the dumb speaking and the lame walking you would think they could identify Isaiah's prophecy but they're so spiritually blind that they cannot even see the Fulfillment of the word taking place right in front of them the religious people of that day had rejected Jesus's message and now he comes to the third pool of his ministry and that third pool is coming into effect now notice that Jesus is going to warn them he's going first of all he's going to give them opportunity he's going to give them chance after chance after chance after chance after chance after chance and no matter how many signs is done how many miracles is done they're going to walk right away they're going to call him be Els above they're going to call him a devil and so Jesus warns them of Prophecy he warns them of something that is fixing to take place and he's letting them know judgment's fixing to strick this Temple that judgment destruction is coming among them what's he speaking of ad70 with the Roman general Titus was going to come in he's letting them know you're not safe in this Temple you're not safe right here in Jerusalem judgment's coming to this place make sure that you flight not being the winner make sure that you leave here don't get caught in these walls make sure that you're not with suckling child at that time don't be like judgment is coming he's trying to warn them of a prophecy of 70 years that's fixing a take place and he's trying to let them know don't be caught up looking at this Temple make sure you're ready to escape do I even have to say it make sure you're ready to escape he's telling them judgment's coming so they rejected his ministry they have concluded by education that he is false and when they rejected his message Jesus has got to pronounce judgment upon that land right now watch Jesus's message was sent to liberate the elect right and to condemn the systems of that day now watch the third pull it comes to do something for the elect but it comes to condemn the systems of that day the religious systems must be judged the religious systems must be condemned and the religious systems is a cursed system so Jesus's ministry under the third pool because they are spurning the mercy of God away he must come because of the rejection of the message of Grace the message of Salvation the message of the light they're turning it down and Jesus said they love the darkness more than they do the light and because of that judgment's going to be pronounced this is not Jesus being mean this is not Jesus with some type of hate oh no he don't want to pronounce judgment but judgment only comes after Mercy is rejected only after Mercy has become Stern as judgment come from the mouth of Jesus you see the same thing has happened in this day only after Mercy has been poured out over and over again they reject Jesus the same way they did there they do it here now they called him all kinds of names they refused to be identified with him don't you see the parallel of this age in so much that the Bible tells us in the Book of Revelation chapter 3 that Jesus was put outside the church and he was knock and trying to get back in why did he get put out they failed to recognize he was among them they called it middle telepathy they called it all some type of a spirit of a man they called him always a stargazer and he just reads mine but I want to tell you they missed it the same way that these Pharisees missed it it was more than that Jesus had come in and the son of the Messiah was being produced and they didn't even recognize who he is and the final pull of his ministry was their last opportunity oh listen to that the final pull of his ministry was their last opportunity the thing that they should have recognized quicker than anybody else they failed to see it Jesus come to be a redeemer he come to be their savior he come to be the Messiah he come to be the king but he came to his own and his own received it not think about this for 30 years for 30 years this man's alive but he don't even start his ministry until he's 33 a Ministry that lasts three years we talk about Jesus we read the story do you really understand the man only preached for three years three years and remember when he started preaching is when John the Baptist went to prison that was a sign and the Bible said when he saw that that was the sign that he was to go forth so he is going to preach for three years watch this three years his ministry is going to be there it'll start it'll begin and it'll end within three years three years the foundation of everything that we believed is within three years every events tied to this coming the entire Old Testament pointed to this moment now watch it's only a couple of days Matthew 24 it's only a few days before he's arrested he's fixing to be arrested he's fixing to be he's fixing to take and be beaten to be whip but notice just before just before the final rejection and the crucifixion you get to Matthew 24 Matthew 21 Matthew 22 and Matthew 23 is the last of the public Ministry of Jesus it's the ending of his public Ministry and let me just say it like this first Paul and second PS come to the end so it ends with Matthew 23 Matthew 23 is Jesus if you read Matthew 23 Jesus is condemning the systems he's coming against the Pharisees coming against the systems of that day it's the ending of his public Ministry because Matthew 24 he's going to go to mount olives actually leaves the temple and he's going to go to mount olives do you know what the Bible said he did when he went to mount oliv his disciples took him apart privately privately not publicly privately so whatever Jesus is going to tell them it's not going to be a public Ministry but notice under the third pool privately privately not a public show it's not something everybody's going to see but he takes them to the mountain privately and he reveals to them the entire book of The Seven Seals now they didn't understand it but Jesus preached the entirety of the mystery of the seals underneath his private Ministry of the third poor after he had become rejected it is astounding when the Lord showed me this the how that Matthew 21 22 23 and 24 so ties together to the ministry of the son of man in this day do you understand that same time has happened in the day that we're living in after a man comes off of the mountain which was an attraction he comes back that watch he Jesus was on that mount Olivas he comes down goes to the Temple goes back up on Mount olives and I want to tell you friends that's exactly what has happened in this hour a mighty Angel has descended under Revelation 10 1-7 he come down off the mountain went back East preached the revelation of the Seven Seals which is the third pool to the elect which is the opening of The Seven Thunders that God would issue forth to wake the bride up how privately privately so he goes to mount olives to preach to his elect the masses are not gathered he doesn't have people it's not the lame coming it's not the blind coming it's only his elect that is listen those who has followed his message so they've received first pull and second pull but he gathers them together to reveal the third pull which is Matthew 24 the revealing of the Seven Seals notice in the anointed ones at the end time the prophet picks this thought up on on the third pool and he said first pull healing second pull prophesying third pull opening of the word the Mysteries revealed so the third pull then is the Mysteries he said remember you that spiritual he said you should have caught that the other day do you realize Matthew 24 and 25 deals with end time prophecy it's the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven because Matthew 22 24 and 25 has nobody else speaking it's written and read Hallelujah because Jesus is going to answer the three questions that came to the disciples When shall these things be what is the sign of thy coming and what is the sign of the end of the world he's going to answer all pre questions but notice it wasn't going to be given just to everybody it ain't going to be just given to anybody but it's to those who is a part of the initiated who's received the revelation of the hour who has not rejected his ministry who's not rejected his message listen the Pharisees ain't there the Sadducees ain't there but he Reveals His secrets to his elect only notice s in prison the third PO he said while I was under that I thought this what day are we living in watch this question what day are we living in could this be the third pool I've got some notes here I want you to watch his notes he says I've got some notes Here well I'd like to know what his note says and his note says watch where he goes and Jesus we find out Jesus in his ministry after he preached to the people after his public Ministry now we're going to be real scriptural on this after Jesus had finished his ministry his ministry was rejected by the people now notice after after the time where he offers dispensation of mercy and mercy and opportunity upon opportunity but when he comes to the end of his M public Ministry now it's going to be a private Ministry because only the elect is going to have ears to hear what the spirit is saying to the church he could have preached it they would have never have caught it but it's only to those that's got an ear to hear what the mystery is being revealed and he said Jesus finished his ministry was rejected by the people watch his next statement now you'll read between the lines you'll read between the lines and draw your own conception I just like the word he used draw your own conception remember what I told you at first after he had preached notice he says Jesus had clearly came identified himself after he preached he clearly came and identified himself self and he prophesied and after the days of his prophecy through those scripturally identified and the church said though scripturally I he wasn't trying to hide from them he wasn't trying to pull the W over their eyes he scripturally was identified among them and they couldn't see it the same way they can't see Malachi 4 the same way they can't see Revelation 101 they cannot see it because they're blind even though it's scripturally identified amen those script identified the people rejected him that's right and he preached then he preached then after they rejected him here oh God could it be friends could it be those that reject this gospel think about it those that turn it down and they go to organization denomination all types of things put their names on church books what are they prisoners Souls in prison I hope you're seeing so Matthew 21 now watch let's get to 21 2223 Matthew 21 takes place at the end of his ministry now watch brother said he scripturally identified himself well let's just find out where he did so he comes to Matthew 21 it takes place at the end of his ministry the prophet picks this thought up at the end of his ministry and watch the attraction on the mountain yeah so he picks up the attraction on this mountain Mount olives and he's going to identify the attraction on Mount Sunset so he's dealing with the attraction on the mountain now look it is the end of his public Ministry and Jesus in Matthew 21 he's coming to fulfill the Old Testament scripture of Zechariah 99 now catch this I want you to understand Zechariah 9:9 prophesied Zechariah prophesied of both advents of the coming of the Lord not only did Zechariah prophesy about both advents Malachi prophesied about both advents so he prophesied of the first coming of Christ and he prophesied of the second coming of Christ so Zechariah 9:9 is the prophecy of the coming of the Messiah the king that he's going to come to Jerusalem and then he prophesied the second one in Zechariah 14 where he said in the evening time there shall be light so the only other Prophet to do that's Malachi so he prophesies of both comings remember Malachi said behold I sent my messenger before my face he prophesied of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord first coming of the Elijah Ministry and the last coming of the Elijah Ministry Now watch how this unfolds Zachariah speaks of a time that the king is going to become identified publicly among the people he's going to be identified publicly among the people so Isaiah actually preaches or Zechariah actually declares this 487 years before it happens Zachariah prophesies of his coming do you know what that means Zachariah will be dead several years before his prophecy comes to pass and I wonder how many people called Zachariah a false prophet because his prophecy still lingered Zachariah speaks of a Time that the king's going to come and he says it like this in verse n what the way this prophecy is written Rejoice greatly oh Daughters of Zion now watch who he is speaking to Rejoice you Daughters of Zion shout Daughters of Jerusalem notice he's calling them daughters which means they're The Offspring they're the progeny and he called them the progeny watch you're not the proy of a Pharisee you're not the progy of a sadducee you're the prophecy of Zachariah you are the you are the progeny of Zion you're the progeny of Jerusalem hallelujah amen you've got opportunity you're in the right place you're in the right land you're in the right place for the visitation you've got opportunity so the seed of Jerusalem is in the right place all thanks spiritually friends don't you realize that you had to be in the right place you wonder how you come to this message and you may chalk it up oh it's Daddy's idea Grandpa's idea I want to tell you it's God's idea you may be the seed of somebody that has believed it and left it but you're still standing on because God pricked your heart oh deer giant lome listen to what he says Behold thy King look how personal thy King cometh unto thee he is just having salvation lowly riding upon an ass and upon a cold and the fall of an ass remember he's on Mount olives but now watch now he's got to descend off of the mountain he's got to descend oh listen if he's going to fulfill Zechariah 9 the King has got to descend into Jerusalem listen what I'm telling you he cannot remain in heaven he cannot remain on the mountain that the king in order to be the king of salv to be the deliverer to be their salvation he can't remain in the in the heavens he's got to descend into Jerusalem I want to tell Jesus had to come down and become a man he had to come all the way down and become a human being he could not remain in the heavens he had to descend off the mount and when he does Zachariah is telling us telling the people when you see that you're King is there yes sir that's your king oh let me just say it that's not just another Cloud that's not just another picture that's not just a Prophet come on somebody I'm talking about your King's coming when you see him to send in the form of a cloud that's the sign of his coming to let you know that's not just another Cloud that's not just water vapor gathered together that's seven angels Hallelujah that's seven angels that has gathered together that's the one that's going to bring Deliverance that's the one that's going to bring Salvation in other words he's descending unto you and he's bringing something with him he's going to bring something with him he's going to bring secrets that no other age has known he's going to sound with seven Thunders that nobody's going to understand but the elect in the last days and at the end of his ministry watch here he comes to fulfill Zechariah 9 remember Matthew tells us Matthew 24 21 and4 watch what he says and all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet do you realize what Jesus was doing watch the sign of his coming what Jesus was doing he was fulfilling the spoken word of Isa of of Zachariah so in order to come to this day he must fulfill the spoken word and when the spoken word is fulfilled notice when is it going to happen at the end of his ministry under the third pool Matthew 21:5 it's going to fulfill that which was spoken by the prophet saying tell the daughter of Zion tell her you can't tell her unless somebody's caught it tell the daughter of Zion Behold thy King comth Jesus even believed in Preachers tell them the do tell the daughter of Zion tell The Offspring of Jerusalem tell the sea tell the progeny tell them that there are Kings coming under thee how's he coming he's coming meek sitting upon an ass and upon the coat of the fo of an ass and let me say this those days of him riding into Jerusalem and Matthew 21 those are days of Mercy those are days of light that is days of opportunity upon opportunity all they had to do was come out and bow this was a public offering to the people he was offering himself as the king to the people and he's given them opportunity to be able to receive the word he descended listen he didn't descend P down into Egypt that ain't where he descended to he didn't descend up into Ethiopia notice where he went he went right to where they're at I believe this America will burn hotter than any other Nation do you know why because God revealed himself right here in this nation right here the people that had more op there ain't no language barrier you don't have to get it through an interpreter and I want to tell you I believe that the ashes of America will burn harder than the ashes of solom and gamorra because of the works that is been done right here in our nation it descend right into the religious Capital the religious headquarters of the world here comes the King right into headquarters and when he came in listen to this verse eight a very great multitude spread their garments in the way praise God they cut down branches from the trees and stro them in the way now watch there's an anointing that's coming with you and the anointing is following the word the anointing is following the king the anointing is following the word and there was some people that was there that did not reject him that did not turn him down but they got under the anointing of the hour and they begin to scream and they begin to holler and they begin to cut down branches from the trees they was moved to worship there was an anointing to worship among them and the Bible says in the multitudes that went before that followed crying sing Listen what they're saying hosana hosana to the son of David blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord look what they say hosana to the highest hosana is not only a term of adoration but do you realize hosana was originally an appeal for a deliver to come and help them listen so when he comes off the mountain they're crying this is him they're appealing to a King this is him they're saying hosan deliver savior salvation helper hosana to the highest Lord come Deliver us they are crying and they're appealing to God and they're letting him know what's going on they're fulfilling their part Jesus is fulfilling his part and the daughters of Zion are fulfilling their part I want to say not only has the son of man done his part not only has the king done his part but God seen you saying amen he seen you Clapping Your Hands he seen you rejoicing because the daughters of Zion spiritually is the bride and we must Rejoice notice verse 10 and when he come into Jerusalem watch how this is so twofold all the city was moved all the city in other words you couldn't sit and not know something's going on you couldn't sit in your closet and hide from it something's going on not just some of the city all the city was moved I want to tell you the Revival that struck this nation you couldn't hide from it you couldn't run from it you couldn't cross the sea get away from it it was a universal Revival and he said the all the city was moov saying who is this who is this look at the question who is this the people that knew the word is asking who the people that studied the Torah they should have recognized what's taking place but they're not seeing it so they say who who is this but I want to tell you somebody's catching it somebody's catching it do you realize the Bible said they was moved in that word literally means it caused a tremble in that City it caused it to shake to agitate the mind so before there's a physical earthquake there's going to be a spiritual one Hallelujah anybody hearing what I'm saying before there's physical earthquakes it takes place under the Sixth Seal the seventh seal is going to produce a supernatural spiritual earthquake to awaken the bride up so it shakes Jerusalem Jesus come riding in a spiritual awakening is going on there's an announcement that's taking place that's what I want to say there's an announcement that's taking place a declaration is being made in so much that it stirred the minds of the people that they had to forsake everything else and say who is this Matthew 21:11 and the multitude said said this is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee now watch what he does he comes from Jerusalem he goes straight to the headquarters and then after he gets done with headquarters he goes to the temple watch the Bible Jesus the prophet Azar verse 12 and Jesus went into the temple of God watch what he's gonna do so he comes off the mountain by Str the Palm leaves in front of him and Jesus goes straight to the temple so the temple is going to the temple the word is going to the temple he's been delivered there by a cult somebody's packing this word in it's being carried in it's been adorned it's being worshiped rejoicing why it comes in and he goes straight to the temple and the Bible said in verse 12 and when he went into the temple of God he cast out watch what the word does he cast out all of them that sold and bought in the temple over through the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves now watch he comes in at Passover that's why they're up there selling doves he comes in at Passover he comes to the temple listen to that here is the Passover Lamb coming to the temple at the temple coming to the temple during the time the Passover Lamb is coming during the time of Passover and when he comes into the temple it's a mess there's no sanctity I'm preaching everybody right now the temple must be a place of sanctity there's no Godly reference there's no Godly fear think about it listen they're only there at a tradition it's not heartfelt I'm preaching to somebody it's we we do not go out of obligation we do not go out of Duty if we want to get something from God it must be heartfelt religion it's not a duty let me tell you it's not a duty it's a feast it's a feast where we come and D [Applause] at Jesus is not going to this Temple out of tradition he's going to fulfill the word and he's got a bunch of people as he comes to the outer Court they've got they got is full of doves they're just going through the motions this is just another Passover I'm preaching to you right now let me just say it's just another service just another Sermon Just Another Wednesday night what if it's more than that what if it's an Awakening what if it's a declaration what if the king comes into this place tonight but here's the S Pharisees and Sadducees the scenes are sitting there they're only going through the rituals there's no sincerity of being there they're only going through the the motions and when he gets there the temple found the temple out of order preach with me somebody he found their worship out of order I'm talking about when the when the seals come open when he comes off the mount when the attraction of the mountain comes in he's going to put the church in order come on son he's going to find the church he going to find it in a mess he's going to find it with no sincerity he's going to find it with no heartfelt relig and he found the Tabernacle out of order their worships out of order the temple out of order don't miss that don't miss that don't miss that you yourself don't miss that their temples was corrupt and it made listen because their temples was corrupt it made the temple corrupt thank you Lord you know what they was doing they had three courts in the temple they set up and just before the altar of sacrifice where you would bring your altar they're set up in the temple and they're selling doves do you know why they were getting they were listen they want to sell the people something to offer God I'm going to say that again they're going to buy an offering do you realize that is something that they tried to offer that to David one day and David after all the mess that he went through he went up there and they said David David said I would love to sacrifice something to God but Ain't Got No sacrifice and all of a sudden a buddy H said don't you worry about it David I'll give you something to answer to give to God he said how dare you I would never go before God and offer him something that didn't come from my own household I would dare to do that I don't want to offer something just because it's offering I want to give him something that belongs to me I want to give a heartfelt offering don't put your offering in the plate just to do your duty make it heartfelt don't put your ti just to pay your ties you take it to God say God you promise it not put my my ti in there that you'd open up the windows of heaven and you pour out a blessing upon me that I can't even contain when you pay your ties you're challenging God and either he'll keep his word or he won't and if he won't let's go find something else to do people just throw money around like it's nothing I want to tell you you're challenging God Lord I'm taking care of your temple and Lord I'm going to challenge you you this is what you told me you would do if you would ever get a revelation that you wouldn't care about paying TI that's praise the Lord am he told me to say that oh you didn't okay can you imagine he comes into this Temple they got the table set up they're just offering you know what they was doing they getting ready for the Passover yeah and they made the temple a place of convenience with no no self-sacrifice God those are heavy words no dedication you don't have to take your best and give it to God you don't have to take your best from your flock just buy your way in the do you see that Catholicism Spirit right there do you see that Catholicism Spirit just buy your way into it just pay your way in you got somebody in purgatory just pay your way out that's a lie I want to tell you Purgatory is a lie that came from hell there ain't no Hotel Between Heaven and Hell I don't care how much they say it is they're only coming in and giving offering they was allowing the listen there was prelates that was coming and they was allowing the prelates to be able to exchange their coins it's not personal it don't mean nothing are you hearing me it's not a personal experience it's an obligation just by lamb any lamb will do just go to church any church will do God never told him to do that in the law you know what the law says be thou set apart in other words it's got to be personal don't just take any lamb take the lamb that you got and give it to the Lord and here he comes to this Temple let me go he's here he comes to this Temple and he finds the temple corrupt and they're exchanging coins for the prelates and the people coming from the other countries around and they was giving them the correct coin of Judea so they was spend the coin of Judea and they were selling them something to offer right and Jesus walks in and he sees this mess going on he goes into their churches and he ask them are you a Christian I have you know I'm Baptist you a Christian I have you know I'm Methodist and when he hears this he's offended at it so when Jesus went into the temple he purged it yes he did and when he purged it it caused a spiritual earthquake in the land it shook the religious order of that day day he turned the tables over let me just put it like this cuz a lot of people don't like this sweet kind loving precious gentle forgiving Jesus picks up a whip you ever hear some preachers preach it they preach it greasy Easy Greasy always just sweet love kind and just lovable teddy bear Jesus I want to tell there's two sides of that story story he is just as much God in judgment and in Justice he's just as much God in mercy and forgiveness as he is and judgment how many knows the Judgment of God is just as awesome as the mercy of God I know why if you don't say Amen to it you don't understand it say Amen if you really understood that God's Great no matter which side it's on and in this case if you're the elect you don't have to worry about the other side you're standing with him and that's awesome you realize Jesus picking up up the Whip and running them out is an act of mercy God correcting people is an act of Mercy but people don't want to be corrected you let a preacher stand up print correct people the way they dress they come to the church and dress like they would out in the bar somewhere they need to be corrected who else is going to do it come on well I'm going to leave it up to Mama what a mama don't say it listen where does judgment begin at in the house of the Lord where did judgment begin at when Jesus walked into the Temple that's where judgment began at that's why you get people living loose and thinking that anything goes anything don't go sorry that's an act of Mercy they corrupted the temple and if your Temple's corrupt you're going to corrupt this Temple their temples was corrupted their worship was corrupted it was no longer holy it's no longer Sanctified he was trying to purge their hearts and turn them from their wickedness and give them an opportunity of Mercy what a decoration think about it his last act in his ministry he turns the tables upside down I'll tell you what I believe he was doing he was purging the floor of the Garner notice what happened let me quit right here he gets the temple clean he gets the thieves run out right he gets rid of all these doves in here nothing nothing wrong with the doves just the way the doves was presented notice what he did he run everything out and after the temple gets clean after the temple is purged after the word is put in its place and Jesus is standing in the middle of the temple all right all of a sudden here comes the supernatural right back into the temple and the Bible said in verse 14 and the Blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them you see what Worship in order does do you see what sanctity does you see what Holiness does you see what order Church order does all of a sudden here come listen that tells me the lame must have not been there because they know God wasn't in there but listen the blind mustn't in there because they know God wasn't in there but I want to tell once the money changers got pushed out here comes the word back into the temple and here comes healing Here Comes Deliverance Here Comes salvation here comes the Supernatural and the blind the lamb came to him in the temple and he healed them verse 15 and when the chief priest and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children the children crying in the temple ain't that something they're not crying before it gets clean but after the spirit of God falls in the children are crying in the temple you know what that tells me something must have been going on in that church I'm talking about from the time he turns the tables over and runs everybody out all of a sudden Jesus walks in here come some little ones that was up there in the temple here they come gathered around the temple and whenever they seen the Blind and the lame start getting healed they go to cry and the children were crying in the temple saying hosana to the son of David and the Pharisees the Sadducees can I say it BST Methodist Presbyterian they see the Miracles they see the signs they see all the Wonders and what they do get mad and the Bible said and they were so or displeased you know why because these children are crying because they're seeing fulfillment they're seeing an attraction coming off the mountain the children was crying in the temple The Offspring oh can I say it can I really say it they finally got a church that's clean they finally got a pull pit that's clean send it inwhere you want to when you get a clean pull pit you're going to have a clean church you get a corrupt pull pit you got a corrupt church when you got a pull pit that anything goes behind the pull pit anything goes in the congregation but when you get sanctity and Holiness and sincerity and blessings will come Deliverance will come salvation will come the children will come back Mas will come back daughters will come back will come in drunkers will come [Applause] in yeah said it ain't taking it back you get the temple Purge and you watch the spirit of God fall here come young people here come young people that was told they'd send their day of Grace away here come children shouting crying hosan to the highest deliverer you know what they're calling for a total deliverance and when the priest heard this yeah they were sore displeased you know why they didn't like the noise in the church they didn't like the worship I want to say this if you don't like Worship in the church something's wrong with your experience I'm not telling you all of us has got to act the same way or act like me God knows he don't want nobody else doing that but there's something about the element of the supernatural when it moves on people it stimulates the nerve remember the prophet saying it takes something to stimulate the nerve and I want to tell the ultimate stimulation Falls among them and the listen they didn't like the noise and the reason they didn't like the noise is because they didn't know who he was they did not see who he was what's the attraction what was the matter with those scribes what was the matter with those priests what was the matter with those religious people this was wrote 487 years before it happened by Vindicated Prophet was already put in the writings called the Bible the Scrolls of the the Old Testament why why couldn't they see that that's prophecy being fulfilled the same reason they can't see it today they had took the word of God and made it a n effect to the People by teaching for well this is the way we always done it this is the way we always done listen I don't care the way you've always done it I want to do it the way the word says to do it well Grandpa bless God I don't care what grandpa I want to do what the word says amen we are not called to be like any other church every church is Sovereign within itself we want to be Sovereign under the leadership of the Holy Spirit you know why because we want Liberty in the house of God and that was the problem whenever he come in they didn't have their order no more he run them out and he took the word of God and they made it a none effect to the People by teaching for traditions for Doctrine they made their tradition of Doctrine they was blinded by it and they Twisted the word they distorted the picture and Jesus was trying to offer them Mercy to wake them up and he's trying to pry their eyes open preaching as hard as he can his last sermon his last message their last opportunity and they are mad and Jesus's replies this and he said unto them hearest thou what these say look what he's doing he's pointing to those that are fulfilling their part of the word he could have said don't you know who I am but he looks at the prophet's prophecy and he says do you hear what these people are saying do you hear listen at them do you hear what they're saying listen at what they're saying listen to what they're preaching open up your ears in other words do you hear do you have an ear to hear listen to this and Jesus said yay have you never read out of the mouth of babes and suckings thou H has perfected praise you know what Jesus is doing he's quoting the psalmist David and he's cuz David foretold that the king's going to come and David said when this would H David tells us when this would happen he tells us what's going to take place and he said when he comes in they're going to Rejoice he's going to tell them listen let me close the psalmist tells us why they're rejoicing and I want to tell you why Psalms 8 And1 oh Lord excellent is thy name in all the Earth who has set the glory above the heavens out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou listen to this hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies in other words out the M because of the enemy there's going to be strength that's going to come that thou mightest steal the enemy and the Avenger right you know what that word still means it literally means he's going to destroy exterminate completely remove your enemies that's before you he's going to be your another other words he will exterminate anything that comes and I want to say this they needed an exterminator because they had all kinds of things that was in their life but when the word come in it drove the enemy from their life he literally stealed the enemy in their midst in other words when they recognize the deliverer when they recognize the savior they will never come into the punishment that listen they'll never have Vengeance against them they'll never have recompense against them he will stop the Judgment against against them and when you recognize him he stops the Judgment in your life and when the children got to crime they realize this is the one that David spoke about this is one Zechariah in other words I don't have to go to judgment because I me the the deliverer you're going to escape the Judgment he's going to steal the enemy let's stand our feet Hallelujah that thou mightest steal the enemy and the Avenger verse five for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with glory and honor the mystery of redemption was God's condens think about it these people that was rejoicing seen the mystery of who Jesus was and the Bible said thou mest him to have dominion over all the works of thy hands and thou Hast put all things under his no wonder they was rejoicing because those who receive him is the ones that calls out his name and begins to worship and they said blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord which is what he said he reveal himself by I'll come in that name so here they are fulfilling their part that Deliverance salvation re all that's coming he put all things under his feet which tells them when you come in into this Temple your Temple's going to get purged watch and judgment's going to pass you by that ought to make anybody rejoice when you know who he is he exterminated the enemy and put all things under their feet oh friends what day are we living in has he not done the same thing in this day whenever he come right into our temples and the Revelation strikes you what did the prophet say when you recognize this message is Eagle food you heard from your theophany which tells us that you had to have one there to be able to recognize it what's taking place the same thing that happened in Mary and invisible Union happened what's happening in the bride when the third pull the Mysteries revealed comes to the bride it reveals who she is she goes to
